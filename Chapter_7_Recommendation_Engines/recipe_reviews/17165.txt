One of the best cookies EVER. Made them for Xmas to bring to school. They sat untouched compared to all the extravagant other cookies, but I forced people to try them. The result: my friend held two cookies in each hand literally SHOVING them in his mouth because they all got eaten in five minutes; there was a mad rush to get them and needless to say I brought none back home. Only problem with the recipe I can see is that the dough is very sticky and hard to form in balls. My suggestion is to drop the dough directly into the sugar and then form the balls as the sugar coats the dough and allows you to roll it. Also, I used a tablespoon of orange juice instead of water to bring out the ginger flavor and it worked extremely well.

These cookies are delicious!!  They are also easy to make but you need to let the mix sit for a good 40-50 minutes before rolling into cookie form, otherwise you'll just be playing with a big gooey mess.  I wish I knew that before I got my hands in it.

these cookies are very tasty, granted, yes.  however, i was terribly annoyed to find that i had big gingerbread balls because of the directive:  lightly flatten cookie.  you need to really flatten the cookie out to get a result like that in the photo.  i would make them again, and will really squash em down.

If I could have rated these 10 stars, I would have. These cookies were autumn/winter perfection! Moist and chewy all the way through. I made mine smaller, rolling the dough into about 3/4 inch balls. They came out the size of a ginger snap. I made the first batch to give as a gift, but they disappeared before I could give them away. Now I have to make another batch tonight. Thank you for a recipe I'll use for years to come. 

*edit*
On the second batch I took the advice of another reviewer and used orange juice instead of water. I didn't think it would make that much of a difference, but the subtle change MADE these cookies. My boyfriend considers himself a cookie connoisseur (and a picky one to boot) and he says these are the best cookies he's ever eaten - bar none.

Wow!  These are the best cookies ever!  They came out looking great - tasted even better!  Like others, I also put the dough into the freezer for about 30 minutes.  It makes a HUGE difference.  I baked mine for 10 minutes - they still stayed moist.  I am planning to give these cookies as gifts for Christmas.  Thanks for the great recipe!

**Unfortunately, these cookies didn't last long enough to give away as gifts.  So I made another batch - this time I used fresh grated ginger, and instead of water for the liquid, I used Brandy-Orange Liqueur.  What a difference!  A nice taste for the holidays.  Next time, I'll try Grand Marnier, Cointreau, Spiced Rum, etc....the possibilities are endless!  Thanks again for the great recipe!

Oh, my gosh...  These are so good!  The spices balance out nicely.  We usually go for chocolate chip cookies, but even my picky 7-year-old son loves these.  I doubled the recipe and used 1 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of margarine to get the buttery taste.  Instead of water, I followed other reviewers' advice and used fresh orange juice.  However, I'm not sure the juice made any difference.  Before measuring the molasses, I sprayed the measuring cup with cooking spray so the molasses would slide out easily.  I rolled the dough into 1-inch balls to yield more cookies.  I will definitely use this recipe again very soon.

I made these cookies and followed the recipe exactly.  My cookies tasted delicious but were flat.  I re-made this recipe the next day, using 5 T of brown sugar instead of molasses and added no water.  The cookies were able to be formed into balls immediately after mixing, no refrigeration necessary as other reviews have said.  My second batch came out big, soft, and looking just like the picture.

I made these cookies for a cookie exchange.  They were a big hit and people wouldn't stop eating them.  My husband probably ate three dozen by himself.  When rolling them into balls, spray cooking spray on your hands to keep them from sticking.

This recipe delivers...soft, fantastic ginger cookies.  This is my first attempt ever at making ginger cookies and I am so happy with this recipe that it is already in my collection of favorites.  


I wanted to add...I froze a few and then put a scoop of vanilla ice cream between two for the most incredible ice cream cookie sandwich.  They remind me of the ones found during the holidays in the shape of gingerbread men...I think Perry's makes them.

I modified it a bit by using 2 1/2 c. flour to help with the stickiness of the dough-placing it in the refrigerator for an hour or the freezer for 15 min. also helps.  I also increased the spices slightly, used 1 1/2 tsp of baking soda, added 1 TBSP vanilla and used brown sugar instead of white.  I also used 6 TBSP butter and 6 TBSP of light butter because I didn't realize I was out of regular butter until I started the recipe.

These are so good that you won't even need that air tight container LOL...Thank you Amy for this great recipe!

I just finished making these for Thanksgiving.  I followed the directions exactly and they came out perfect.  I did put the batter in the fridge for one hour, doing that made them easier to work with.  O.k., the only complaint I have (and it is totally a taste preference)was that rolling them in sugar was a little overkill for me.  They tasted very sweet (but really good). The sugar leaves an after taste.  Hopefully by tomorrow the flavors will have mellowed out a little. I will make these again and will nix the rolling in the sugar.

Update: On Thankgiving and the next day after these tasted better than when I first made them.  I did have some comments on them being slightly sweet. I might just sprinkle some sugar on top rather than rolling the balls in sugar because these cookies are sooo good! Oh, and try putting some cool whip between two cookies, this makes a yummy cookie sandwich!

Yes, these are good and turn out perfectly, but I don't think they're as extraordinary as other reviewers seem to. This is a basic gingersnap recipe, found in nearly every cookbook, so there's nothing unique about it. For best flavor use butter, and chill your dough till semi-firm, about an hour, to make handling easier and to prevent them from spreading too much. I made mine a little bigger using a small ice cream scoop so they all turned out the same size, and "underbaked" them a bit to ensure a soft cookie. An easy cookie to make--perfect for the novice baker!

These cookies are absolutely delicious! I follow the recipe exactly as stated - and got exactly the results stated. This is by far the best recipe for cookies I have found on this site. If you haven't made these yet - make them - and add them to the top of your favorites list! 

On half of my cookies, I drizzled them with orange glaze to really bring out that ginger flavor. I just melted 1/2 cup of butter in a sauce pan, mixed in a cup of powdered sugar with 1/4 teaspoon grated orange rind and thinned it down with orange juice until it was the right consistency to drizzle (about 4 teaspoons of orange juice)

I am an avid baker and have been baking for many many years. I make over 4,000 cookies at Christmas time....and wanted to let everyone know that these cookies are definitely worth making and adding to your recipe collection.  I made them the other night for my son to take away to wrestling camp, and they were eating them as quickly as I could make them. I had to shoo everyone out of the kitchen so I could finish.  They were even eating the dough before I could get them baked! To overcome the problem of the dough being too soft to roll, all you have to do is refrigerate the dough for a few hours.  I had no problem rolling them once the dough was chilled. I used all butter instead of margarine. Hope this helps.

Made these first in 2010 when I asked my (at the time) husband if he had any baking requests for the holidays and to my surprise he asked for a ginger cookie. Reluctantly I agreed because I had never made them before and personally didn't care for them. Knowing I preferred soft, chewy cookies in general, I sought out for the perfect recipe and....I FOUND IT!  He loved them and couldn’t get enough of them and this recipe totally changed my impression of ginger cookies. I took them to a party and people were eating out of one hand and holding reserves in the other!  They were a hit!  I also used the 'sugar cookie frosting' recipe from this site. I would say cut the recipe in half because it makes entirely too much! Also, I spread some of the icing on the bottom of one cookie and coupled it with another one to make a sandwich out of it! YUUUUMMUMMY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

 ADJUSTMENTS:  Used butter instead of margarine. Per another review, used fresh squeezed orange juice insted of water.Sprayed the measuring cup with oil before measuring molasses so it would slide out easily.  Placed the dough in the freezer for 30 minutes (per the recommendation of previous reviews) before forming into balls. I used a melon-baller, made smaller cookies and baked for 7 to 8 minutes to assure a soft, chewy texture. Take my word for it...you CANNOT go wrong with this cookie!

SCRUMPTIOUS!  I glazed them with the "Sugar Cookie Glaze"  drizzled over the top flavored with orange extract to compliment the ginger nicely, and lightly sprinkled with cinnamon... Great recipe Thank you

*Won 3rd place in a big dessert competition... not too shaby when it went up against favs...like cheesecake and such... I don't think I've ever received so many compliments on a cookie.  The glaze definately made it heavenly though...

EXCELLENT. I love these cookies so much that this has become my all-purpose cookie recipe. If you leave out the spices, add an extra teaspoon of vanilla, and substitute pancake syrup (or corn syrup) for the molasses, you can use this recipe for anything. I've made lemon (add the zest of one lemon), chocolate chip (add 2 cups chocolate chips), and sugar cookies (sub half water, half corn syrup for molasses and add 2 tsp. vanilla) using this recipe with great success.

Simply the best soft ginger cookie I've ever tasted.  I put dough in tightly covered container and refrigerated overnight.  I believe the secret to making these perfect cookies is to be sure and flatten the dough balls before baking and bake just 8 minutes as suggested, even though cookies will not look "done".  I also used orange juice as the liquid.  This is now our favorite ginger cookie recipe!  I also plan on putting 2 cookies together with my whoopie pie filling to create another treat we all enjoy.

My cookies came out melt-in-you-mouth awesome. I also did not have the sticky batter problem. I used a hand mixer to beat the sugar, butter, egg, and water until creamy. Maybe that was why.
I did not alter a thing and found the recipe perfect. (I have eaten two while writing this). Also, I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar and the taste is out of this world!

I followed the recipe, but cut the cookies into gingerbread men. The men were difficult to get onto the baking sheet after cutting them because the batter is very, very sticky! The cookies were very delicious, although they weren't as soft as I expected. So if you plan on cutting them into gingerbread men and want them to remain soft, make sure your men are pretty thick-maybe 1/3 inch instead of 1/4. I cooked them for about 8 minutes and they came out perfectly.

Wonderful cookies!  Before I made these, I read probably 1/2 the reviews and tips. I decided to make it with extra ginger.. simply divine! 
I saw in a few reviews that they added more flour, or they omitted the water (liquid) altogether.. I don't recommend this. You can add 1 Tbsp of liquid to any cookie recipe if you want it to be softer/chewier. This is the trick for any cookie recipe. 
Another tip, I took out the very first batch exactly at 10 mins, but they were falling apart as I was transferring it to the rack, so I carefully put them back on the baking sheet and waited for the batch that was in the oven to finish baking (14 mins is best for me) then I placed it back in the oven and it rose up again and after 5 mins it was perfect. 
For the extra sugar sprinkling, I dipped the bottom of the dough ball in sugar; placed it on the sheet, then I dipped my fingers in the sugar and flattened the tops halfway. I also found that you must cool completely before you put in a jar or they will fall apart and mush up. 
Thank you for this awesome recipe!

REVIEW #2 - 
First review is below.  New alterations: Used all KA WW flour, 1/2C butter, 3T water (to make up for the first 2 changes)  2 rounded T ginger, 3/4t black pepper. Measured 1T balls.  Rolled in sugar/ginger.  Baked 14 min on a cold stone.  They had big, deep cracks across the top, (first batch cooked 9 min & they looked done, but the middle was super raw, and didn't finish firming up on the stone) would be less time on a metal pan.  Cooled 5min on stone.  WONDERFUL!  Didn't spread much (due to less butter), but rose up nice and fluffy. The tops fell while cooling, and were nice and flat - just like the other photos.  Ooooh... my pregnant tummy approves!

REVIEW #1 - 
I made these for a friend of mine who is pregnant.  I was trying to replicate a super-spicy ginger cookie that actually helps with her morning sickness!!  I ADDED 5 t. of EXTRA ginger and 3/4 t. fresh black pepper to make them spicy enough.  They are AMAZING!!  I made them tiny, because she needs tiny snacks throughout the day.  They are soft in the middle and slightly crisp on the outside.  I rolled them in 1/2C sugar mixed with 2t. ginger.  Excellent recipe!!

This is not the easiest recipe and almost scary to make.  It does not look like it will come together but it does.  The batter is sticky but the cookies would not come out as fabulous if it wasn't.  I just pour sugar in a bowl for the coating process and even coated the bottom of the pub glass I used to smash them down with.  I made this for work and everyone loved them.  Messy recipe with wonderful results.

This is a great ginger cookie recipe. They are soft and delicious. The only thing I did different was use butter instead of margarine.

I've never made Ginger cookies so thought I'd give it a try. I made 2 batches this wknd. They are awesome! I did a few changes based on preference and others reviews: fresh orange juice instead of water, brown sugar instead of white, 1/2 butter & 1/2 butter flavored crisco instead margarine, nutmeg instead of cloves. Chilled dough and pressed with fork. Cooked for 7 min. They are PERFECT. I also made icecream sandwiches with them and wrapped in foil.  Filled the freezer.  Soooooo Goooood!  Thanks for a great recipe  :+)  UPDATE: made these many times, this time with all butter flavored crisco, all brown sugar and same subs as before. Rolled small balls in cinnamon sugar and placed on parchment paper, didn't flatten them out, cooked for 8 minutes. They are perfect size and taste awesome!

Very Good. These cookies are like soft gingersnaps! =P  *TIP* Be sure to make them plenty small, because they flatten out a lot. (I used a stick of butter instead of the margarine) These are extremely sweet. I would decrease the amount of sugar to 3/4 cup at least, but I love the flavor of the molasses. These are a nice change from your typical chocolate chip cookie ~ and SO GOOD! (Great for the holidays!!)
*TIP* Be careful not to overbake these!!! Unless you want *crunchy* ginger cookies! It is very easy to overbake them and make them crunchy. I had one batch come out soft (my preference) and the other batch come out crispy.

These are great!!! I used 1/4 c shortening and 1/2 c butter instead of the margarine. I also used 1/2 c white sugar and 1/2 c light brown sugar instead of 1 c white sugar. The dough is soft and hard to work with, but the cookies still come out round and taste great.

Ditto to all the other rave reviews.  Found this recipe on AR several years ago and have been making these wonderful cookies since.  There is no need to add additional flour to this recipe.  If your dough is too soft or sticky to roll, put it in the fridge til it firms up.  Use the bottom of a glass to flatten slightly.  Perfect every time.

These cookies are absolutely delicious.   I did have to bake them for the full 10 minutes.  The person before me that suggested you drop spoonfuls of the dough in the sugar and roll it into balls there is correct.  That is what I did.  Thank you for posting this.  They fairly flew off the platter.  :-)

these are fantastic! Crispy outside and soft inside.  Worth the time and effect! A couple tips *use real butter *do not over soften the butter, that will help with them not spreading so much and the dough won't be nearly as soft.  *place dough in freezer for 20 minutes *bake exactly 8 minutes (they will look underbaked, don't worry)  *lastly, let them cool on the pan for 5 minutes.  If you remove them too soon they will fall apart.  *Them let them cool on a paper sack.  The sack will trap any excess butter to make sure they aren't too greasy.

Well, I feel rather sheepish given the glowing reviews and the fact that I consider myself to be rather good in the kitchen.  My cookies came out hard – just like regular ginger snaps.  I followed the recipe exactly and baked the first batch for 10 min and the second for 8.  However, I think I do know what the issue was.  All the reviews stated that the dough was very sticky and hard to work with – mine was just perfect to work with.  I live at a rather high elevation of 1083 metres (3556 feet) and the climate is very dry.  Next time I’ll add more water or OJ and look at the consitency more closely.

I love these cookies.  I do make a few changes though - I always add some cardamom to the batter, for a little extra spice.  I also keep the batter in the fridge unless I'm actually scooping out cookies.  I don't flatten them, either.  They come out fluffy and perfect, every time.

Awesome cookie! A touch sweet for me, I'd cut down the sugar a tad next time. And I'm going to try icing them with cream cheese frosting next time too.

***Edit*** If you have trouble with the dough being too sticky to roll, spray a little cooking spray on one hand, rub both hands together and you should have no problem rolling the dough into balls.  
What a great ginger cookie recipe.  In my opinion, it has just the right combination of ginger, cinnamon and cloves.  These cookies will puff up in the oven and make you think the end result is going to be a big soft (cake-like) cookie.  Not so!  After the proper length of baking time (mine needed the full 10 minutes) they will flatten, crinkle up a bit and end up being soft and chewy.  There's no need to flatten these on your cookie sheets before baking as they do that on their own without any help.

This recipe is like the one that my dear grandfather used to make, and I could never get enough of his cookies:)  Old fashioned, wonderful taste and chewy.  I have been searching for a recipe like this and have finally found it.  I plan on making these as christmas gifts and attaching the recipe to the tin. I too used the orange juice instead of the water. I used real organic butter, organic flour, sugar and pastured egg.  I also used my saigon cinnamon for a very unique taste:) I believe in using the best quality spices, as it does make a huge difference.  Enjoy these while you can, as they will not last long around your home.

I didn't like ginger cookies until I tried these!  Just the right amount of sweet and spice.  The tip to slightly flatten the balls of dough is great, they end up looking store-bought but taste homemade.

After reading reviews I thought I would chime in with some advice about flat cookies. 
-use bread or unbleached flour. 
-use parchment paper
 -ALWAYS USE COLD DOUGH 
-NO dough on warm or hot cookie sheets 
-Using baking soda/powder that isn't fresh can make your cookies flunk, as can peeking at them by opening oven door repeatedly.
-DO NOT over-mix in the creaming process. The friction WILL cause too much heat and flunk the cookies while baking.
-If dough feels too "gooshy", add flour until it feels "springier".
-During creaming, butter/margarine MUST BE COLD.
-Adding even a "tad" too much of baking soda will flunk them.
-And last...if doubling, tripling etc the recipe, you MUST measure ingredients by WEIGHT, not simply by doubling or tripling the original ingredients. VERY IMPORTANT.
Fresh, well measured and cold ingredients will help all cookies to be better tasting and better looking. Hope this helped a little.

DO NOT DOUBLE THEY COME OUT LIKE WATER AND IT DOES NOT GIVE YOU THE PROPER WAY TO ADD EVERYTHING.IT ONLY WILL TELL YOU TO ADD ONE CUP OF SUGAR TO THE MARGARINE WHEN YOU SHOULD ADD BOTH...THE ONLY WAY TO DO THESE WHEN DOUBLE IS TO REFRIGERATE THE DOUGH OVERNIGHT

I followed the directions (not the ingredients) perfectly (butter instead of margarine, half brown sugar and half white, orange juice instead of water and did not use salt) and these came out perfect!  I didn't even need to squish them at all before baking.  They flattened to the perfect thickness and were soft and delicious.  I'm not even a big fan of ginger cookies, but I ate two third of the batch I made :-)

Ok I am seriously MAD. I don't get it. I am an experienced...GOOD cook. I have never had cookies fail like this. What is the deal? These cookies turned out terrible! The batter was unbelievably yummy, but it was very difficult to make the dough into balls even after chilling it in the fridge for 20 min and putting flour on my hands before every cookie.  I know that I followed the recipe exactly. Before the time was even up, at like 7 min, these cookies were not done on top and burnt on the bottom and stuck to the cookie sheet! My oven doesn't overcook things usually? They were flat as heck...so those that said they needed to totally flatten them, I don't understand. The margarine I used was not melted, but the consistency/look of the finished cookies looked like it..bubbly, flat looking. I'm THINKING this recipe should have called for real butter? Sigh.

This was the best ginger cookie I've ever had!  Perfectly soft and tasty. The dough was a little sticky to work with and I almost added more flour, but I used spoons to make the balls and roll them in the sugar.  It worked great and I'm glad I didn't add the extra flour because they turned out perfect!  Next time, I may put the dough in the fridge for a bit to make it easier to work with, but the spoons worked really well.

Delish. My tip: store extras in the freezer, and for a snack, put a slab of vanilla ice cream between two cookies for an ice cream sandwich. Yum!

Like a lot of people, I used orange juice instead of water.  Unlike another reviewer, I did NOT have to flatten them.  They flattened like pancakes.  Maybe it has to do with the altitude...  When I did slightly flatten them, they turned out like gingersnaps you would buy at the store.  (Only soft)  :)

If you freeze the dough it makes it VERY easy to handle.



They are so delicious!  

Ok, I have to update this.  I made them again.  The first time I made them with crisco instead of margarine.  They came out flat and chewy.  DELICIOUS.  The second time, I tried it with margarine and they COMPLETELY stuck to the airbake cookie sheet.  Something I've NEVER experienced.  BUT they came out puffy and VERY SOFT.  (Just broken from scraping them off the sheet)  Also, I tried them with the crisco and a little bit of brown sugar because I ran out of white, and they were TOO SWEET.  Stick with the white sugar.  I put the sugar cookie glaze on them with orange extract, but I definitely think they're better on their own.

ALSO, the dough was MUCH more manageable with CRISCO rather than margarine - which to ME, is WORTH it.  Hope this helps someone!

Outstanding!  I actually make these cookies quite small (about the size of a silver dollar) and bake them for only five minutes.  They are ideal to serve with a pumpkin-cream cheese dip.  These wonderful cookies have now become a favorite with me as well as many friends. Thanks for sharing this fabulous recipe.

These cookies stay fresh and soft for over a week in the cookie jar. Great to eat with a warm cup of tea.

I am a pastry chef at a college.  Since me make over 1400 cookies a day for students, I was looking for a recipe that would really "wow" them.  My bakers and I re-calculated the recipe to about 740 cookies.  We ran them through our cookie machine and they dropped beautifully.  We sugared them and baked them in our large oven.  We received more compliments on this cookie than any other we've done. THe taste, texture and shelf life of this cooke are great!  We even ran out of some molasses and substituted the rest with Sorhgum syrup and they still were really tasty.  We will definitely put this on our rotating menu.

Amazing!!  The spice blend is perfect, and the cookies are soft and chewy. (except the last batch that I forgot to turn on the timer, they are more like ginger snaps, and they are delicious too:)

I made these cookies tonight because I was in the mood to bake cookies and didn't have chocolate chips or oatmeal in the house to make my usual cookies. I am so glad I stumbled upon this recipe!!!! I followed the recipe exactly, except I used butter instead of margarine. These are my new favorite cookie! I made 2 dozen and I swear 4 of us ate 15 cookies already and it's only been a couple of hours since I took them out of the oven! They have the PERFECT texture, soft and chewy on the inside with a nice crisp edge. The flavor is phenomenal! I might even add a little extra spice next time to really spice it up. My dough was sticky and I was a little concerned about it at first, but they turned out beautiful! I didn't quite roll them into balls because of the stickiness, but that didn't seem to matter. They do spread a lot so make sure you leave plenty of room between each cookie. I'm putting this recipe in my book of all time favorites that I'm putting together for when my children are grown.

Boy, these 5 star ratings are getting kind of boring!!  LOL!  Honestly, these deserve all "the best" ratings!  I have to admit that I did substitute brown sugar for the white (thought they would be even more moist), but other than that, stayed with the recipe.  I felt the spices were right on and they turned out nice and spicy.  Would highly recommend these!

TIP: Instead of margarine, try 1/2 cup butter. Also, decrease the amount of sugar to 3/4 cup. Throw in a few extra tablespoons of flour. I just made these 3 adjustments to the posted recipe and my cookies look exactly like the picture. Not flat at all. They are fabulous!

I have made this recipe for years at Christmas.  I do not add the water to the dough making easier to handle.  For an extra treat I frost them with a lemon frosting.  My family loves these.
Frosting: 
2 c. powdered sugar,
1/2 c. butter, softened, 
3 T lemon juice

I've been making this recipe at holiday time for the past two years--always with rave reviews. They are delicious and stay moist for a few days. I usually bake them as much as a month ahead of the holidays and freeze them, first wrapping them in press-and-seal wrap, then putting them in a freezer bag. Let them defrost on your counter and they taste like they did the first day!

This was the worst cookie I've ever tried to make.  The cookies didn't rise at all, and I even cooked it for 15 min and it was still not done.  Maybe instead of baking soda, it should be baking powder?  I'm not going to try the recipe again to find out.  I am changing my stars to a 4.  I only had to add about another 3/4 of a cup of flour and they turned out fine.

I made these cookies for christmas last year as gifts to co-workers and although I'm not a big fan of gingerbreadman cookies, I got rave reviews.  A lot of my co-workers requested this recipe.  A "must have" if you like gingerbread cookies.

Clearly something went wrong here. While my cookies tasted great, they were as flat as can be, greasy, and floppy (not set). All of these negative factors outweigh the good flavor. I reviewed the directions, and I don't see that I did anything wrong. I want thick, soft cookies with crackles on top like I see in the photos!

These are absolutely the best cookies! Chill the dough for at least an hour and it will not be so sticky.  I also doubled up on the spices, used butter instead of margarine and melted the butter.  This gives the desired flat look with the cracks instead of a puffy cookie.

There is no way to describe how perfect these cookies are. Everyone who had them raved about them. I used orange juice as some other reviewers had suggested. I doubled the recipe and I do think I would have halved the cloves if they were for personal use, but I am not big on their flavor. I drizzled a mix of powdered sugar, milk and almond extract over them after they cooled.  I will definitely be adding these to my holiday baking list!!!

YUMMO! Best cookie ever! I used butter because that is all I had. I rolled into balls, then rolled into sugar and then slightly flattened with a cup. They spread and were very thin. So the next ones I left in balls and they were PERFECT! So soft, and moist! I used the "Sugar Cookie Glaze" from here and drizzled over. Just delicious!

I should have added the extra flour that some reviewers did.  The cookies came out flat, but they were still good.  My 2 yr old niece could not stop eating these.  I changed the sugar coating to cinnamon sugar mixture and it tasted much better.  Overall, a nice-tasting cookie.

I just whipped up these cookies... the last batch is in the oven now... They are GREAT!!! I took another "rater's" advice, and let it sit for about 45 minutes, prior to baking. And they are soft fluffy!!!! I also used butter instead of margarine, and added an additional 1/4 cup of flour (since there's many reviews mentioning it's 'wetness' and i didnt have time to refrigerate).... this gave it the perfect consistency to work with, without sacrificing the texture of this cookie.  I also did not have any cloves, so I replaced that with 1/8 tsp nutmeg and 1/8 tsp of pumpkin spice. And for good measure (and because i love ginger) I also threw in 1/4 cup of finely chopped candied ginger. These cookies are perfect!!!! Sooooo yummy!

I didnt have any oranges kicking around (to replace the water) but next time i'm going to give that a shot  as others have!

Loved the texture....followed the instructions exactly but "heaped" the measures when adding the spices. Wish I would have added more. They were really good, but I wanted just a bit more ginger-y taste.

Well, what more can I add to the already fabulous reviews - but these definitely are "Big, Soft, and full of wonderful Ginger flavor".  I did sub orange juice for the water and the dough was a bit difficult at first, but chilled it and after that it was A LOT easier to work with...  Overall, a great cookie for Christmas!

I was surprised to realize I have not reviewed these yet. I've made these cookies many, many times, and they always come out perfectly. The spices are just right, and the cookie is neither flat nor puffy - it's big and chewy. A real favorite of everyone who tries them!

I did not try yet this recipe, but i am getting ready for christmas so I will give it a try this week. My lovely son adores cutting cookies and decorating them. I am thinking of adding more flour to the dough so we can cut stars, cars and so on. Did anyone tried it using this recipe? Reading the reviews , I am absolute sure that they will be fantastic, though i will be using dark honey(forest honey)instead of the molasses. So, please, if anyone has an idea on how to turn this dough into a shapeable dough, mostly my son will appreciatte it(lol) Thx

Made the cookies tonight as a double batch for a cookie exchange. I wasn't sure I'd have time to finish them as many reviewers recommended chilling the dough to roll it, but as it turns out I didn't need that step at all and they turned out perfectly. I think next time I'll drizzle them with icing. Anyway, I added OJ concentrate because I didn't want to bother mixing the orange juice. I didn't roll the cookies in sugar but even without it they were really quite good, and I cooked them for 8 minutes with great results. Seriously, the recipe was super easy and this evening I scrolled through the zero and one star comments to figure out why people didn't like it - I'm stunned. Don't worry too much about this recipe, they are easy and yummy cookies without any fancy steps. Oh, and if you worry about the molasses flavor (as one reviewer stated ruined her cookies, which I thought was funny because it's such a key ingredient), make sure to buy the MILD flavored molasses. The dark molasses is very strong, but most people can tolerate the mild in cookies and other baked goods.

Amazing cookies.  Everyone begs for more!  Sometimes I dip half of the cooled cookie in white chocolate and let harden.  They are excellent!

These were awesome!!! My family loved them. I used my Pampered Chef cookie scoop and had 34 cookies, you may want to double the bach. You won't be disappointed. The only changes I made were to add 1/4 cup more flour and baked them for about 12 minutes until cookies started to crackle. They turned out perfect, very soft and chewy.

We love chocolate so it was strange that I even tried these cookies.  Everyone in the family is glad I did!  I used coarse sanding sugar on the outside.  Delicious!

This is a simple recipe that produces BEAUTIFUL looking cookies!
This has been super popular with friends and family. I've had many ask me to make them again, or for the recipe. Thank you for sharing! This will be the only Ginger Cookie recipe I use in the future.

Great Cookie...wonderfully moist (I detest crunchy cookies).  I did, however find that the dough was a bit too soft to roll into balls after mixing, so I popped the bowl into the freezer for a good 15 minutes, and it was perfect for rolling.  It didn't matter if I made them flat before baking, as I forgot to do so for the first batch and then did so with the rest, and they all were uniform...couldn't tell the difference.  Overall, easy and tasty!

A revision of my original review: add an extra 1/4 C. flour and chill for easy rolling and cutting. I added allspice and nutmeg for extra spice, and as previously mentioned, this also worked well with all butter instead of margarine.

This is almost the same recipe that was given to me by a friend. Her cookies are amazing.  Her recipe has no water or white sugar.  With that in mind I did not add water.  Dough was easy to work with without refrigerating.  Used about 1/8 cup dough for each cookie. Didnot press down.   Baked 8 minutes.  Nice and moist, looked similar to the cookies in the picture.

Awesome cookies!  I followed the recipe exactly, even the sifting.  They turned out very sticky, so next time will definitely leave time to let them sit in the refrigerator to firm up as others have suggested.  The taste is very good!

When I modified this recipe to ping-pong sized balls and cooking for 13-14 minutes they turned out really nice. When I made walnut sized balls and cooked 9 minutes they were tiny, squishy messes. This was frustrating because you have to cool five minutes before removing them from the baking sheet, so there really wasn't an option to throw them back in when I discovered how undercooked they were.

I was looking for a nice, thick, chewy, crackle-topped molasses cookie (like the one pictured).. unfortunately, I followed the directions to the letter and what I got out of this recipe was a large, puddle-like cookie that had a crunchy ring around the edge and a squashy, greasy center. I got the same result out of my second batch, thinking that maybe I'd done something wrong. Won't be making these again.

These cookies are absolutely amazing. Just know that using margarine actually changes the texture of the cookies a bit (they come out a bit flatter and denser if you just use butter). When I ran out of margarine once, I used about a 1:7 ratio of shortening to butter, and they came out really well.

I made these cookies this weekend and heeded the advise from another review and chilled the dough in the refrigerator for a few hours which made them easy to roll. My husband said these were the best ginger cookies he has ever had!  They hold together well so I plan on making a lot more for our annual charity cookie drive!

These cookies were FANTASTIC.  I read some of the previous reviews and decided to add some chopped up candied ginger.  I cut up the ginger in tiny pieces and added just a little bit of the flour to it so they didn't stick together.  Worked out great!  Served them with Thanksgiving dessert.  Thank you Amy!

I've made three batches in less than a week and they've disappeared quickly. They're a hit with my kids, other family members and co-workers. The recipe is easy and requires little time. The rich traditional ginger-molasses flavor is outstanding. I recommend baking them for only 7-8 minutes so they are extra-soft. They are easy to handle after baking. They are not overly fragile, even though they are very soft. Your home will be filled with a Christmassy aroma and of course, these cookies are especially delicious right out of the oven.

I DO NOT COOK.  My family jokes around and says that I can mess up the recipe for ICE.
THESE WERE GREAT!  Not only was it easy, but they tasted AWESOME.  I've been telling everyone how I actually made something and its good. I made them 2 nights ago and they are already gone.  Very tasty and very, very soft!!

If you like ginger cookies, you will love these! I did what the other reviewers said and substituted orange juice for water and refrigerated the dough. Great recipe!

These are so so so good!  Make sure to take them out of the oven just before you actually think they are done.  They will finish cooking while they cool.  This helps keep them soft.

Excellent. Hubby likes them soft and chewy and these delivered. I did both, squashed them down and not (just before baking). I prefer the Not.

I make lots and lots of Christmas cookies... I decorate everything pretty intricately.  I made these as written and my husband said... "Just keep making these!  They are delicious!" Made another batch (tripled) in my Kitchenaid mixer.  Sent off to family and friends and got RAVE reviews...Thanks for the great recipe AMY!

If you want a real treat...use this recipe, make an ice cream sandwich using lime sherbet, wrap and freeze. They taste like gingerale. My family loves them.

These are such good cookies!! But I've found these subs are important: nutmeg instead of cloves, 1/2 cup softened (not melted) butter instead of 3/4 cup margarine, 1 cup brown sugar instead of 1 cup white (still use white to coat each cookie). The batter is a little dry, when flour mix goes into molasses mix (due to reduced fat content I think) but I just add a teaspoon of water at a time to moisten until the dough is workable. These cookies are very similar to those sold at Starbucks but a little less sweet, which is good in my opinion. They are totally addictive. :) Please don't give up on the recipe if you find the cookies are a little doughy/raw in the middle once baked, they just need a bit more time in the oven. I had to bake 3 batches before I found the perfect baking time in my oven (9 minutes) but it was well worth it.  I suggest cooking 1 or 2 cookies at a time until you find the perfect time because it makes all the difference. Also, although the recipe says 'flatten slightly' I pressed each cookie down with a fork in a crisscross as I would a usual cookie. I forgot that step one batch and they were doughy/raw. Still, once you get the recipe 'right' it is so so right!! Thank you, thank you so much for this recipe!

Delicious, soft and chewy. They also look beautiful! I've had a real craving for gingerbread of some sort this season and these hit the spot. Easy to make and just the right spices. I used unsalted butter instead of margarine and the texture is outstanding. I iced some of the cookies with a vanilla glaze, which was very tasty too. (Mine came out a lot lighter in color than the main recipe photo, even though I used dark molasses. Wonder why....)

Wonderful!  Made these as part of Cookies Across America, and they are delicious.  Just the right amount of spices!
To achieve the attractive crinkly top, I chilled the dough for 1 hour, portioned out a dozen for baking using a cookie scoop (if you don't have one of these, you need on in your kitchen!  It looks like a small ice cream scoop with a spring-loaded handle), then chilled the remaining dough as they baked.  I think that's the secret to getting the tops to look like the primary recipe photo.

I made these for a friend who hates chocolate and we needed a non-chocolate dessert. She loved them I must say surprisingly so did I. I wrapped up the extra dough into a log in parchment paper and froze and then gave to my friend who then cut them out and baked when she needed. I have since bought some crystallized ginger to add in will try and update my review.

This recipes a keeper! I modified the recipe a teeny bit by using 1cup of brown sugar for the dough and orange juice instead of water. Next time i might add more cinnamon and ginger to make it spicier but thats just a preference.

we've been searching for a great ginger snap recipe and this one is by far the best!  Easy to make and so soft and chewy you'll want to eat the whole batch!  I didn't have margarine, so I just used butter.

The flavour was great. I would have liked them to be a bit softer; perhaps I baked them too long but I also didn't seem to bake long enough to get the nice cracks on the top. No big deal though, they tasted great! Edit - I just made these for the second time, for my Christmas goodies tray again, and you know I really can't figure out why I gave only 4 stars last year. No nice cracks, a bit chewier than soft? Who cares, they taste AMAZING and really deserve the 5 stars!

Just as good as they look! The dough was a bit sticky to work with, but totally worth it. I dipped a fork in sugar to flatten them before baking. It seemed to keep the dough from stickying to everything else.

I used butter instead of margarine and this recipe turned out great - delicious. I put the dough into the freezer for 30 minutes and that made it less sticky to handle. I dipped the top side of the dough ball in sugar and flattened with the bottom of a glass that I had rubbed with flour.

What a treat. I really dont like the hard ginger snaps. these are crazy good.  I set the servings to 36 (cookies) and it called for an egg and 1/2. so i put in 2 (extra large eggs) and the came out cake like on the inside,fantastic.   I also stuck the dough in the freezer for 30 minutes and they where real easy to roll, i put the dough back in the frezer while the batches where baking.  I actually got 50 cookies...yeah lol......dont forget to smash them down to about 1/2 " thick before baking.  I might try to icing on them since there cake like cookies.

Awesome chewy gingerbread cookie. My husband rarely thinks anything is really good, and he can't stop saying how awesome these are. Used Triple Sec instead of water and unsalted butter instead of margarine, but otherwise left the recipe as is.

Fantastic!  I was a little nervous about these because ginger/molasses is not a universally liked flavor, but I was shocked at how well these went over at work.  They were gone in 5 minutes!  I too upped the flour to 2 1/2 cups, used real butter, substituted OJ for the water and used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar for the batter.  Chill for at least 1/2 hour before rolling.  Definitely flatten the balls with the bottom of a glass before baking.  They're beautiful for presenting and a perfect Christmas cookie!

I found this cookie a soft, flavorful, easy, delight. While I made mine using brown sugar rather than white, plus the called for molasses, I was pleased with the FULL flavor it added. I've read other reviews where the batter turned out sticky, although I used brown sugar  and even butter flavored Crisco (instead of margarine), I still found this recipe to be firm and easy to handle. The only disappointment was I didn't yield 2 dozen cookies. I guess the walnuts where I live are larger ;) I recommend this cookie for anyone that loves ginger bread cookies without the hassle. I definitely will be using this recipe a lot.

These cookies turned into a nightmare.  I checked after making them that I had the right ingredients and amounts of each ingredient. These did not work at all. I have no idea what happened as I see thousands of raving reviews. The dough was incredibly sticky and impossible to work with, even after taking other reviewers suggestions to put the dough in the freezer before forming balls on a cookie sheet. They looked like cookies when I checked on them in the oven after 8 mins, but they were just goopy messes in reality....didn't cook on the bottom properly at all...just messy to try and clean-up and throw away. No clue what the problem was....oven works fine and I checked the ingredients/amounts as I said. I was really looking forward to these cookies too...I wish I could see someone else make them to know how to pull this recipe off. Baffled and confused I am!

Excellent cookies. I took other users advise and chilled the dough, made smaller balls, and used fresh orange juice instead of the water. I also used the zest from the orange. I didn't even measure how much, maybe half a tablespoon. To take this cookie to the next level, I took a clue from the photo and frosted with orange and zest I already had for the cookies. Just powdered sugar, zest and juice squeezed from a ziplock with a tiny corner cut out. The extra orange on the outside really makes these cookies zing!

I made these cookies this morning.  Wow, they are super-tasty.  I read a lot of the reviews before I cooked them and I did make a few modifications that likely added to the flavor of the cookies: 1) I substituted orange juice for water; 2) I did half a cup of white sugar and half a cup of brown sugar; 3) I put the cookie dough in the freezer for half an hour to make rolling the dough easier; 4) instead of rolling the cookies in sugar, I just lightly drizzled sugar over the top of the cookies after I had flattened them.  I strongly recommend refrigerating the cookie dough before rolling it into balls.  Towards the end of rolling them, the dough was softening and it was getting very very gooey.  This makes for a tasty cookie but unless it's chilled, it will be hard to roll.    I read a couple of reviews that complained about one flavor overwhelming the rest of the flavors (i.e. too strong a flavor of molasses, clove, ginger, etc.).  I really disagree with this sentiment - I thought the flavors came out beautifully.  I did not think any of the individual flavors overwhelmed the whole.  Next time, I may try adding a dash of nutmeg or a tsp. of vanilla to see if that changes the flavor.  Other possibilities that come to my mind include substituting orange liqueur or brandy for water, though the fresh squeezed o.j. is a hard flavor to beat.  Thanks for the delicious recipe!

These are tasty and very good. Definitely take the advice of the reviewers and refrigerate the dough for a couple of minutes before rolling into balls. It makes a HUGE, HUGE difference. Otherwise, it is a bit too soft (at least this is what happened to me).

These cookies are sinfully delicious!  After reading several reviews, I decided to substitute orange juice for the water and use only 3/4 cup of sugar.  I placed the dough in the freezer for a half hour while my oven preheated and proceeded to use a small cookie scoop to make balls from the dough (it was REALLY sticky).  I dropped the balls right into the sugar and rolled them around.  Once flattened on the cookie sheet, you couldn't even tell I used a cookie scoop.  Mine turned out perfectly after 10 minutes in the oven. These cookies are delightfully spicy... but I will say that they are not for the faint of heart.  My husband thought they were "too spicy".  Will definitely make again!!!

as a professional pastry chef, these are the best ginger cookies i have made.  I would recommend making the dough a day in advanced and baking dough while it is still chilled. this helps with the spread factor, as they do spead alot.

These are delicous and easy. I used fresh orange juice instead of water but didn't change anything else. Just the right consistancy and very easy to roll. Thank you so much.

I didn't have cloves, & our family prefers less sweet & more spicy cookies, so i amended the recipe: 4 tsps grated ginger, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1.5 tsp nutmeg, 1 cup brown sugar, 1/8 cup honey. I didn't roll the cookies in the sugar either. But the cookies are still fabulous! They're disappearing off the table right now...

My first batch had some serious issues, not enough flour, I used smart balance instead of margarine (even though it says it can be used for baking, I'm not sure if this had anything to do with it) and when they came out they were very, very flat and way too soft.  Try number two I added about 3/8 of a cup of flour and downed the butter (no margarine in the house) to just over half a cup.  This time they were PERFECT, they were beautiful and had a crackled top after nine minutes.  I brought about half the batch to work and already have requests to make another batch, they went quickly!  The other half I sent to my boyfriend, I'll have to see what he thinks when he gets them!

These cookies bring out an amusing side of my husband I've never seen before.  It's truly like an addiction.  Even my healthy friend, who rarely eats desserts, was grabbing for them.  I didn't have any problems with stickiness.  I refridgerated the dough for a few hours.  To make the balls, I used a cookie scoop to get a rough ball, and quickly rolled it in my palms.  After coating lightly with sugar, I flattened with the bottom of a glass.  My only critique is that it seemed to have too much butter (cookie was pretty oily and spread quite a bit).  I see others compensated by adding more flour.  Next time, I think I'll decrease the butter by 1 or 2 Tbsp.  Nevertheless, this gets 5 stars because no other cookie has exercised so much control over my hubby!

My 3-year-old crammed the first one in his mouth and signed "more please."  I couldn't even wait the 5 minutes post-oven to taste these gorgeous lovelies and they taste just as good as they look.  I'm not sure how big a walnut is and ended up with 40.  There were only six left the next morning and I can confirm they stay soft (and we didn't even cover them).

Wonderful!  I have made these three or four times and every time they are gone in two days!  I substituted at least 1/2 of the flour with whole wheat flour (sometimes I used more, sometimes less, but always at least 1/2).  I also substituted Splenda and about 1/8 cup honey for the sugar.  They are really soft and chewy, wonderfully aromatic, and delicious!  Thank you for this recipe!

I left out the two tablespoons of water and added a heaping tablespoon extra flour.  The dough was not sticky at all and I rolled them into walnut sized balls and flattened them with a small glass dipped in sugar.  They came out very nice--you just have to watch and not over bake.  I ended up with 45 regular sized cookies.  A caramel frosting makes them even better!  Thanks for the great recipe.

The best thing to do is refrigerate them for 30 minutes or so to make it easier to roll into balls.

This recipe is to die for...!!! I have diabetes, so I always cut the sugar content in half including the molasses. I don't ever use sugar substitutes...rather cut back on the real thing. My husband has never liked ginger cookies, but absolutely loves these. This ones a keeper...!!!!

Just made them and LOVED them! In fact, I panicked because after I creamed the sugar & butter, I realized I didn't have any eggs. So I used pumpkin puree, and it's amazing. So amazing. Mmmm... I may not bother using eggs ever for this recipe.

These cookies are the bomb.  When they first came out of the oven, they weren't our favorite.  We stored them and they just got better and better...  Followed the recipe exactly except used butter instead of margarine.  Never use margarine because of trans fats.

These cookies were not at all what I expected! After reading all of the raving reviews, I was expecting something to write home about.  The cookies were cakey, bland, and overall not impressive. They still tasted good, just not five-stars worthy.

Something was left out of the instructions.  The cookies were too soft to roll in sugar without putting in the refrigerator first.

Not sure what I did wrong but mine did not get crackly like the photos, but it doesn't matter to me because these things are so good! I will definitely be making these again. Thanks AMY1028!

Love these cookies. They are what they claim, Big Soft Ginger Cookies. I like to dip mine in white chocolate. For some reason when I halve this recipe it doesn't work out. They do freeze well for me.

Soft yet chewy, these cookies have just the right amount of bite. I put in 1/4 cup of ground flax seed and reduced the flour, 1/4 cup applesauce and reduced the margarine, and reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup. They still were delicious. I'm addicted.

A great cookie; these always get eaten up by lunchtime when I take them to work.  I don't have any problem with the cookies spreading out, and I found that refridgerating the dough until chilled before rolling and lightly flattening the balls helped prevent too much spreading.  The cookies stay nice and soft too.  Thanks!

Amazing cookies!  The family and my husbands coworkers inhaled these within minutes.  Only change-- I used butter instead of margarine.

I was disappointed. We have a favorite ginger cookie recipe we've been using forever but I decided to try this one because it was so highly rated by so many people. Maybe it would've been okay for me if I hadn't already tried this other recipe but it didn't come close to measuring up. Our favorite recipe has a better texture and flavor. A lot of people like this recipe but you don't know what you're missing! The recipe I have has more flour, more baking soda, less margarine, and a little more molasses. The spice ratio is different too and it's so much better! I've decided to publish my recipe so people can know what they're missing so watch for it!

Made this yesterday and they were delicious! Thank you for sharing this great recipe!  I made 36 med. cookies. Perfect size.  Used a small cookie scoop, so they all came out the same size.  Got great reviews. Next time I will add more spices. personal preference.

Excellent.  I roll in sugar.  For the chewiest cookies: Leave in the oven for 7 minutes, take out and allow the cookies to bake on the hot cookie tray for 4-5 minutes outside of the oven.

Wonderful cookies!  My son and I used 3/4 cup shortening and 1.5 Tblsp water instead of margarine, and they came out great!  I used small ice cream scoop to scoop the dough before rolling in sugar...didn't seem too sticky.  We'll ba baking them again soon!

I've had this recipe in my recipe box for YEARS!! And what can I say.....I should have been making these from the get go. Fabulous cookie. There were only 2 things I was worried about, with this recipe. 1. the fact I followed the recipe to a T and the mix was very very soft and fluffy to work with (should it have been this way?) 2. Why are my cookies a lot lighter then everyone else's I see in pictures? I've looked and looked this recipe over and still couldn't figure it out.....Well does it matter? not any more. But because the mix was soo light and fluffy and a bit sticky, I just scooped out a spoon full into a medium size bowl of sugar(well more then 2 tablespoons) to roll them into the best way I could and dropped them onto a parchment lined cookie sheet, then pressed down slightly using a back side of a measuring cup.  I even tasted the molasses prior to mixing it into the recipe to know exactly how it tastes...The recipe could have been a bit spicier in flavor, but as is, it was still great. So again, not sure why my cookies weren't the dark ginger cookies I've eaten before, but the cookie was a total success. Thanks.

These cookies were super sticky.  I could not make them into a ball until they where chilled.  They were soft and chewey, but they lacked flavor.  I rolled the remaining batch with sugar mixed with extra ginger because they were bland.  They also did not want to bake done in 10 min.  I probably won't be making these again.

I LOVE LOVE these cookies. They're my personal favorite. I've never had a problem with them flattening on their own, and mine always crack on the top. They do come out looking just like the picture for me...I use real butter and not margarine though...don't know if that would make the difference. Delicious!!!!

I`ve made these cookies twice in the last 2 days... they go sooo fast. They`re exactly what they say they are, soft. My bf was disappointed that the spices weren`t stronger but that didn`t stop him from eating a dozen of them in 1 day,lol. Second time round I added more spices and a tad more molasses, and they turned out heavenly. Thanks for the great recipe!!

So soft. So good. Especially with the "Sugar Cookie Icing" from the website. I even made a gingerbread house with this recipe. Spices smell heavenly and are not overpowering in the finished product.

Made these for my coworkers as christmas gifts, and nobody ended up bringing them home. They were all eaten at work! I used large raw sugar to sprinkle on top after they had just came out of the oven and it sweetened them up perfectly. The spice amounts were just right with the added sugar on top.

I've had ginger cookies that were this good before, but never with this amazing texture. They are soft, and stay soft, and are so simply delicious that while they arn't as requested as other cookie recipes they always get devoured the quickest, hands down. Definitely chill the dough - even then, work quickly to keep your hands out of the dough as much as possible. Less is more when it comes to sugar for me so I don't roll them in the 2tbsp at the end, and no one has ever missed it. Other than that I follow the recipe exactly - never tried the OJ, I don't really see the need. When I've planned poorly and just don't have time to chill the dough I keep my hands slick with margarine and roll them into balls, then use a palm or spoon coated in margarine to flatten. Thanks very much for submitting AMY1028 :)

Great cookies  With that said, I've noticed some posters have stated that they've had problems with the consistency of the batter.  May I suggest this solution:  The recipe calls for softened margarine.  Be aware that some maragrines (especially the tub margarines) add water to make the margarine more spreadable.  This might be making some of these cooks' batter too runny. Try using a different margarine or even butter flavored shortening.  Of course, butter can be substituted, but will probably result in a crisper crust on the cookie.

Super easy to make!  I made these for my brother for a Christmas party he was going to.  I used the advice of some other reviewers and used fresh OJ instead of water.  I also threw in some orange zest.  It really added a nice touch.  I also drizzled them with some glaze, like I saw in some of the photos.  They smelled delicious and must have went over well because none came back home!

My favorite cookie. These stay soft and chewy days later. Sprinkle with red / green sugar to make festive for Christmas.

The flavor of these cookies is wonderful!  First I made these cookies with real butter, and they turned out extremely flat.  Then I made them with margarine and they turned out just as described...big and soft and yummy. Definitely follow the recipe and use margarine!

Really terrific cookies. These are the first cookies I've ever baked from scratch ... so easy and so good! Stayed soft for over a week too (but I did make giant cookies, which might have helped). 

The first time I made them, I used 3 tsp of ginger and 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper to make it extra-spicy. They came out great... had a nice slow burn in the aftertaste. I forgot to roll them in sugar, but just sprinkled raw sugar on the top of the flattened cookies before they went in the oven, and that worked out fine. 

Made them again just now, and this time used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar. Used maybe 2.5 tsp ginger, and no cayenne. I did roll in sugar before putting on the cookie sheet this time, and sprinkled some raw sugar on top (it's pretty!). This time they turned out sweeter and less spicy, but still good. I'd use the first method if making these for adults, and the 2nd method if making for kids (or adults with a sweet tooth!)

Oh, regarding the OJ... the first time, I used 1 TBS lemon juice instead of the water (had no OJ on hand), and the 2nd time, I used 1 TBS OJ instead of water. I can't really taste the difference between the lemon juice and OJ versions, so go ahead and use lemon juice if that's all you have!

Very Good!  I left out the water and used 1 stick margarine and 1/4 C. Crisco, then I chilled the dough.  The dough was not sticky and the cookies stayed thick and chewy.  The first time I made them I followed the recipe exactly and they came out thin.

Really good cookies- I reduced the margarine to 1/2 cup, the flour to 2 cups, and the sugar to 1/2 cup to make them healthier. I also added about a teaspoon of vanilla. I made about 1 inch balls and ended up with 40 cookies at only 58 calories a piece- you can't beat that! :)

These are the BEST ginger cookies I have ever made.  I used to have to travel 80 miles to a bakery to get something close to these.  Even my 4 kids love these with a little icing on the top.  These are in my recipe box for good.

These were very yummy and tasted like soft gingersnaps :] My only complaint was that for me they were a little too sweet..so next time I will see how they taste without rolling them in sugar. They really do stay soft and yummy, even while storing for a day or two.

I loved this recipe.  They won't get 5 stars for visual appeal but once  you take a bite you are hooked.  They have just the right blend of spices are wonderful wintery treat.  They make the house smell so inviting.  Make these when you are inviting folks over and they'll be hooked just on the aroma alone. I added a bit more flour to make them a bit more manageable.  The dough tends to be a little gooey.  I suggest scooping them up with a spoon and just rolling the dough balls off into the sugar with a forefinger to avoid a real sticky mess.  The recipe was easy and these are truly delicious.

These are incredible. I was disappointed when I took them out of the oven because they were so flat, and I like big soft cookies, but they really do stay soft.  I added 1/4 c extra flour, more ginger, twice the cinnamon, and 1/2 tsp of ancho chili powder. It worked well.

Wonderful! Be sure to take them out right around 9 minutes, they won't seem QUITE done but they'll cool and be perfect. I didn't need to refrigerate the dough or anything, they were easy to form into balls. Thanks for a fabulous recipe!

The flavour was fine BUT they are not soft, they flatten out on the cookie sheet after baking (that could be the altitude here but the pictures provided by others showed the same problem.)  I just don't know how a "soft" cookie recipe would call for 100% white sugar - next time, if I make them again, I'll use half white and half brown as any baker knows the brown sugar is what makes a cookie soft.

These turned out beautiful, just like bakery cookies.  The flavor was nice but almost a little floury because they weren't very sweet the way I expect cookies to be.  I just wasn't "wowed" by them, so I think I'll keep looking for a better ginger cookie recipe.
12/06/06 - I want to ammend my review.  These cookies improved overnight and now are not as floury and are sweeter.  They taste much better and I'm changing from 3 to 4 stars.

Everyone in my family loved these cookies!  My husband & kids keep asking me to make them again, they didn't last long at our house.  The dough was sticky & hard to roll in sugar, I will refrigerate for a little while next time. The recipie was perfect! Definitely will make again!

Very good cookies, I had my in for 10 mins, and were a little too soft yet, but they tasted great!  I also refrigerated the dough for about an hour so that it was easier to work with.  Yum!

Very good cookie recipe.  I didn't find the dough too sticky.  It was perfect and I didn't need to refrigerate it at all.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I added a little more cinnamon.  Also, if you don't want your cookies too flat, don't press them down at all.  They expand enough on their own.  Also, I wouldn't leave them in any more than 8 minutes or they get hard...they're still good, but they're not soft if you leave it in much longer.

I decided to make these cookies right in the middle of May because it requires only the basic ingredients that everyone has in the kitchen already. Someone here said ginger could be overwhelming for some people so I lessened ginger a bit and replaced with more cinnamon.  I didn't have molasses so I use brown sugars instead of white...the kind you get from specialty store...darker and a bit gooey than normal brown sugar. Just skipped the molasses and the cookies were sweet enough anyway. But molasses probably make them even more chewy. Freezing the dough in the freezer about 15-20 minutes helped a lot with the sticky issue. 8 minutes is a perfect bake time for my oven. The warm cookies are not that spectacular, I was hesitating whether is good enough for bringing them over to a gathering. But they are perfect, taste and texture wise, the next day. They are among the first desserts gone from the table. This recipe is definitely the keeper!

Very good.  Definitely easier to roll in sugar after refrigerating for 15 minutes or so.  I only smushed them slightly and cooked a bit longer to get a thicker cookie.

These are fantastic-- I practically ate half the batch right out of the oven, they were so good! I didn't have molasses, so I used brown sugar instead of white, and for extra flavor I mixed cinnamon into the sugar for rolling. I'm sure they'll be even better with molasses next time (and believe me, there will be a next time!). Soft, moist, and not too sweet. Perfect with tea!

I really loved these cookies, my 2 year old could not get enough. My only problem was that I didn't space them far enough apart, so they all stuck together and stuck to the pan. Next time I will better grease my pan. They were great though, great morning sickness remedy!

This is an excellent cookie.  Just make sure to space them well enough because they spread out a bit.  I substituted the molasses with 1/4 cup of brown sugar mixed with 1/4 t. cream of tarter (see substitutions list on this site).  They are very sweet and rich...I wonder if I could get away with putting only 1/2 cup of butter in the recipe?  That would lessen the guilt.  The kids all loved them.

This are great cookies and easy to make.  Perfect as is.  I do recommend spraying your hands with cooking spray....this makes the cookies easy to roll and dip into the sugar.

I'm so happy to finally be done with the Christmas baking! My younger daughter Tyler, is a huge pumpkin pie fan and the minute this dough was mixed I knew that she would absolutely love this cookie as it smelled so much like the pie. Well I was right, she's giving this a five star rating. Good job Amy!

yummmmm! some changes i made: i replaced the egg with 1/3 cup of warm water and about 1/2 tsp more baking soda. the cookies were reeeallly good like this, but i made a few more additions: i added some finely chopped fresh ginger (about 2 tsp.), as well as a bit of nutmeg and a bit more dried ginger and cinnamon; also, some raisins. all in all, an amazing cookie... easy to make and clean up, and the dough was nice to work with (i refrigerated it for a bit).

Simply the BEST ginger cookies!  Amost everyone that had one said that they were some of the tastiest they've ever had.  Be sure to watch them carefully though -- I baked the first batch for about 9:00 minutes, and they came out a little harder than I personally like (still soft and chewy, but not "fresh baked" soft).  I baked the next batch for about 7:45s and they were perfect!

I found this recipe quick and easy. I made them according to directions, doubling the recipe. I had no problem, but I increased the baking time by 1-2 minutes after the fist batch. They're very good!

Delicious! My margarine was rancid, so I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/4 cup coconut oil. I think it made my cookies a little flatter and chewier than margarine would have, but overall the taste was really great. Instead of the water I used strong cold coffee. I like the coffee/molasses combination. I'm eager to try the recipe again with fresh margarine.

Great easy ginger cookie recipe.  I've been on the hunt for a "large, soft" ginger cookie recipe since having to pay my left arm for one at the coffee shop.  As called for in the recipe, I used margarine instead of better (which I NEVER do) because I really wanted a chewy cookie (as opposed to a flattened version by using butter).  Cookie held their shape beautifully - didn't grow nor shrink - and I wouldn't have known it was margarine if I hadn't used it myself.  If you want a 4" cookie, don't be stingy on the dough when you roll and press it - it's not going to get any bigger or thicker than the raw cookie.  Certainly a good recipe to send the smells wafting through the house.  I personally like more spices so will try again with more molasses and spice and of course, make them a lot larger.

These  are the  best  cookies!I used oj in place of water. I baked about 10 min and let rest 2 min., then I removed to cooling rack.  I made an icing of  confectionary sugar with OJ  and  drizzle tops-  they  were eaten  quickly...I did not have to chill-they  easily rolled into balls and then the  sugar to bake on pan. Its a easy recipe  and will make again.

These gingerbread cookies are fantastic.  I found I had to add a very short 1/4 c of flour to make the dough workable to roll into balls. I think I could have left out the water.  The dough must be soft so add flour, if needed, a little at a time.  Don't forget to flatten them before baking!  I got rave reviews on these wonderful cookies!

These cookies are unbelievable!! I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out fantastic. I found they were a bit crumbly when I was rolling them into balls so I just worked the dough in my hands for a bit and that seemed to do the trick. I baked them for only 8 minutes, let them cool on the sheet and the outsides were crusty with a nice gooey inside!

Great :) but by the second try. 
Only some changes:
I never use margarine - substitute with butter;
Wholegrain flour in place of white;
150gr brown sugar was enough.
And I got really nice and much healthier cookies :)

Simply AMAZING!!! Got rave reviews from the people I made these for and was asked for the recipe! I used OJ instead of water and used more ginger and molasses than called for and used 1/2 cup margarine and 1/4 cup butter and refrigerated then rolled in turbinado sugar. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe! :)

Personal use comment cause I know this info is in the title... not a fan of soft ginger cookies, and these are really soft. I'll stick with the crunchier versions.

I cut the sugar by one-third and doubled both the ginger and the cinnamon so they were spicier. I also used butter instead of margarine.  Fantastic! Will make them again for sure!

These cookies are really good.  Really, REALLY good!  I made them at Christmas time last year and they didn't last long enough to be included in the cookie plates that I give to people.

Changes I made - I used butter instead of margarine.  I added a couple teaspoons of fresh grated ginger and about 1/4 cup chopped candied ginger.  After rolling into balls and placing them on the baking sheets, I put the cookies in the freezer for about 10 minutes before baking.

I was looking for a recipe that was similar to the gingersnap cookies I get at Great Harvest Bread Co. This recipe was it! I've made these probably 4 times and always have compliments.

I'm a pastry chef at a high end restaurant and we have a rotating cookie selection on the menu. I put these on the menu and at first, people stuck to the other classic choices, chocolate chip, etc. However, after the waitstaff began snacking on them and spread the word, they became one of the most popular menu items!

The texture is great--chewy and moist. The flavor is fantastic. Do make sure you flatten them more than the recipe's "slightly," otherwise they'll be little domes instead of cookie shaped.

I highly recommend this to anybody looking for a nice, soft spice cookie.

They were excellent but didn't look like a good old fashioned ginger cookie.  The taste was really good and the flavours came out perfectly.

I generally don't like the taste of ginger and usually cut down the amount of ginger required in recipes, so I was really surprised to enjoy this recipe. My two toddlers and husband also loved it. I substituted maple syrup for molasses since I ran out and it still came out great - next time I will try it with the molasses as originally directed. Thanks for sharing, I will make this again. :)

These were great!  Just don't smash them down too much or the timing and crinkled look won't happen.  I did a test batch for timliness and size, etc.  I found to smash the cookies down to about 1/3" and cook for 9 minutes worked in my oven.  Yum!

You must chill this dough before you can work with it!!!!! Plop it in a big piece of wax paper and try and make a roll out of it as best you can and stick it in the fridge overnight or several hours.   Don't add more flour since this affects the quality of the final product!  When firmly chilled slice 1/2" thick slices and put on cookie sheet.  

All molasses doughs are a sticky goey mess unless they are chilled and even then you only have a couple of minutes before they fall apart again.

These are DELICIOUS. I used 1 tsp fresh ginger and 1 tsp ground ginger. I used a heaping tsp of cinnamon. I used butter instead of margarine. Bake time was 10-12 minutes. Important to flatten the cookie.

Best cookies I have ever had. The only thing I did and it should be added is to put about a half cup of sugar in a bowl. Once you have your batter made just scoop a spoonful in the sugar and kind of move the bowl around in circles so that the batter ball is covered in sugar then just put it on the cookie sheet. Keeps the hands cleaner. Love the recipe!!!

Delicious!  I used whole wheat organic flour and Splenda brown sugar mix and Smart Balance all to be a little nutrition friendly.  I did top with one dark chocolate covered almond before baking.  Adds nice flavor and touch. Comes out to 3.5 grams of fat and 2 Weight Watchers points.

FIRST: when rolling out the dough balls, oil your hands!  I quickly learned that it was much easier to roll them out by liberally greasing my hands with coconut oil every 5-10 cookies (rinse off any stuck-on dough before regreasing your hands).  The oil doesn't really add any noticeable flavor to the cookies, and makes the prep work 10 times easier!

That said, this is a FANTASTIC recipe; my girlfriend wanted ginger cookies, but all the store-bought ones are hard and crunchy and we like soft cookies.  These fit the bill perfectly!

The only substitution I made was the margarine -- Land O Lakes makes a "cinnamon sugar" butter in a 6.75oz container, which is just the right size.  Throw the whole container in and you're good to go, no measuring.

Next, I'm going to try substituting in sugar in the raw, and whole wheat flour... we'll see how that turns out.

This recipe was far below average... The cookies had a bland, unspiced flavor and turned very potato shaped. I would Definitely flatten them more. Also, despite baking them in the oven for the correct amount of time, the bottoms were hard and slightly burnt. Definitely not a repeat for me but my chickens will certainly enjoy them.

Loved this cookie, although if your looking for less of a spice cookie and more of a ginger taste, add more ginger. I'll try it next time myself.

Great flavor, but could not get the crackle effect on top.  They puffed up nicely when baking then flattened as they cooled.  It did not alter the taste at all, just the appearance.

This is one of those recipes, the title says it all.  These are SOFT ginger cookies, too soft for me, it is like your still eating dough and that was at 8 minutes and even 10 minutes.  Just too soft ,  but on another note, the spice in it is perfect for my liking so I will try to figure out how to get these crunchy without over baking.  I did refrigerate the dough and the dough was fine to work with.  I would not flatten these too much unless you make them BIG and thick, they 
are like round bendy disks when flattened because they are SOFT.   I have no idea how people store these unless you put them between 
parchment paper as they are so soft they tend to stick to one another. 
I did everything like the recipe said and they taste GREAT, just way 
to soft for my liking, also who ever's picture is shown,  did something 
I am not aware of because they do not turn out like that picture at all.
  I need to find that persons reviews as those cookies look awesome.

These are incredible!! I read other reviews that stated how sticky the dough was to work with, so I just refrigerated it for about 15-20 minutes, or so, and that did the trick. Yum!!

Perfect! Make them flat and chewy by squishing or puffy by just leaving them in a ball. I used lemon juice instead of water...basically anything citrus will work to bring out the ginger, you won't taste the fruit. You can try a dash of cayenne if you like it spicy. I increase the clove (2 tsp) and ginger (3 tsp) and add a dash of nutmeg. I also use egg whites and butter. For kicks, I brush on a vanilla cream cheese glaze but they are great just rolled in raw sugar. Also refrigerate dough for 10 min or longer before making into balls.

These are my favorite Christmas cookies.  I have been making them for years.  I like to add some course red or green sugar after I flatten them.  Be sure to hand mix them after you cream the sugar and butter together.  Over mixing will cause these cookies to be flat and gooey.

These are delicious.  They are very gingery so be prepared.  My family can't stop eating these when they're baked.  I've made them several times along with the Soft Chocolate Cookies.  Both wonderful recipes!

These are fantastic. My husband calls these his favorite cookies and gets really excited when I make them. When I let other people try them their eyes always get really big like they are shocked at how good the flavor is. I also love the chewy/soft texture. I make these with the recipe as written, but I lightly press a small heart shaped cookie cutter into the center of each flattened dough ball before baking for a cute pattern when they are done. MAKE SURE YOU DON'T OVERBAKE THESE! That is the key to a great result. They might look like they aren't done, but trust me once they cool they will be perfect!

I'm not sure why....but I had to adjust the cooking temp and time. My mom had a very similar recipe, but hers called for baking them at 400 for 15 mins. Cooking them the sugggested time was not enough; they didnt even crack. I ended up cooking them at 400 for 13 mins.

These cookies are 10 stars. Amazing. Follow recipe to the letter, just refridgerate dough for half an hour to 1hr or so before you start rolling the balls. Makes the dough firm and your cookies won't 'melt' (flatten)..

Eh. I followed the directions closely although I did use a little juice instead of water and butter instead of margarine. 

I found them to be a bit strong on the molassas flavor. I used a darker molasses though so I'm not taking off any stars for that. 

I am taking one off basically because I found them to be chewy, especially with the sugar coating... not soft. Especially not soft "gingerbread" cookies. I made some without rolling them in sugar and that did make them a little more cake-y than sugary but it still wasn't quite the texture of softness I was looking for. 

Want a chewy ginger cookie? These are great!

My nana makes these cookies every yr (my mom does every so often). The other day I got the recipe and this is the SAME EXACT recipe! OMG THEY'RE SOOOOO GOOOD!!! My kids love them, my husband loves them, and I love them. They're so easy to make. 
My mom got this recipe from someone who was born in the VERY early 1900s, so this is an old recipe but a GOOD one!

Use flour on your hands when rolling the cookies because it is a very sticky dough. And ONLY bake them for 10min, make sure they're still puffy! Also I don't flatten them, they come out just fine.

I am only rating this 3 stars, because after tasting the dough, I wanted much more ginger flavor, so  doubled the ginger and added about half a cup of minced crystalized ginger.  Now THAT was a great cookie!

My boyfriend said "these are the best cookies ever made!"  

I refrigerated the dough for about 30 minutes, which made it super easy to roll the dough into balls.  I made the balls a bit bigger than the recipe calls for, and rolled each ball in a bowl of sugar.  Perfect!

I increased the seasonings about 50% and used vanilla instead of water. They are very popular at my house. Only thing I'm not sure about is why they are called "Big" when using walnut-sized amounts of dough makes them only about 2.5 inches in diameter.

I have made these cookies 3 times now with perfect success every time.  This is an especially great recipe because the cookies do turn out soft, and stay that way!  I have used butter instead of margarine all 3 times and they were still soft.  I also tried the OJ instead of water once and didn't notice a huge difference...they are just so delicious.  Definitely my favorite cookie recipe right now!

They're very good, and definitely soft. It helps to flatten them with a spatula or something, otherwise they just form a little hill and not a cookie. And i added extra (double i think) cloves and cinnamon because the more spice the better.

These are good cookies.  I really wanted mine to turn out with the crinkle look.  I did not have margarine so I used butter.  I refrigerated the dough for 1 hour.  I followed the directions and slightly flattened the dough balls and they turned out good, but not crinkly.  But the second pan of cookies I forgot to flatten the dough and they turned out beautiful.  Note my photo – the cookie on the left was flattened slightly before baking and the cookie on the right was baked as a ball.   That is the only difference.   I prefer the crinkle look.  I will definitely make these again.

These turned out great. Soft and yummy! I've never been able to make soft cookies, and I managed to do these right. I left them in a bit too long, because I thought they didn't look done (beginner mistake), but they still were soft and delicious. They were a big hit!

These cookies are phenomenal!! people who have tried these said they dont even like ginger snaps but love these. I did make a few alterations: 2 1/4 teas ground ginger (wasn't gingery enough for me), 1 Tbs of fresh orange juice instead of water, REAL butter instead if margarine and I did flatten my balls before baking them. 7 minutes were perfect (crisp on the edges and soft in the center). LOVE LOVE LOVE these cookies, highly addictive!

Easy recipe, tasty cookies.  I made a few changes as suggested.  I substituted brown sugar for white, used Grand Marnier instead of water, and kicked up the spices a bit.  I didn't think they were overly sweet, and would not skip rolling them in sugar.  The cookies were exactly as described, Big Soft Ginger Cookies.  Yum

Hm, not sure what I did wrong, but mine did not spread at all, and instead turned into ginger snaps. Not soft at all. But, they were delicious ginger snaps!
**edit: I decided to try these again and they worked quite wonderfully! Didn't change a thing from the original recipe except added a little more of all the spices. Yum!

Wonderful cookies. I did make very few changes, added extra half cup of flour and added 1T. milk as I had no orange juice. I would not put the extra flour in next time, as the dough was too dense. It was also hard to mix it together well. I put my dough in the fridge overnight and made them in the morning and squashed them down gently with a spoon before placing in oven to bake. I think I have eaten at least a dozen already, although I made them smaller than the pictures here.A ten star cookie for sure! So good.

These were excellent!! I made them for a new years eve party we hosted, and got rave reviews: everyone said they were delicious and the best ginger cookies they've ever had. I took the advice of many and let the batter sit. I actually made it the night before to save time and kept it refrigerated, and baked them right before the party for the fresh-out-of-the-oven deliciousness. This recipe is going to be a staple from now on. Yum!

With a few simple changes, this recipe is definitely 5 stars!  Following other reviews, I increased the flour to 2 1/2 cups, used 1 tbs. orange juice instead of water, used 1/2 brown 1/2 white sugar, and bumped up the spices a teenie bit...I was a little nervous because I could not stand the smell or the taste of the batter, SOO I made a little test batch.  WOAH MAMA, these smelled wonderful while baking, and tasted even better than they smelled (which was pretty darn good)!!  I had no problems with the cookies not cracking; they were pretty AND tasty.  This cookie dough also freezes very well.  :~)

This was the best ginger cookie I have ever had!  My husband does not even like ginger cookies but he loved these.  This recipe will be staple in my cookie recipes from now on.  The best thing about this recipe, no need adjust the ingredients.  A must is to refrigerate until the dough is firm, before rolling.  Cookies remained Soft and Chewy.  Thanks so much Amy, for sharing this recipe.

I give this recipe 5 stars. I did use all butter. As a result,  I could taste the salt in them. My fault not the recipe's. When I make these again I will use half butter and half margarine. A tall glass of cold almond milk took these over the top!

What I can tell you, is that I have never made a cookie from scratch before (store bought dough) and these were a MAJOR hit!  They were very easy to make and were moist and chewy and just great!  5 star all the way and highly recommended!

Wonderful cookies! I've already made one normal batch, and it lasted less than 24 hours! So tonight I'm making a double batch and hoping that it will last a bit longer lol! I took the advice of others and flattened the cookies throuroughly. I also used orange juice instead of water. Best ginger cookies ever, and they can easily be made smaller for ginger snaps.

These were delicious! They came out soft and moist, and the flavor is spot on. Normally, I add extra spices to a lot of recipes because I find that they don't call for enough cinnamon, ginger, ect. Not these, they are great. The first time I made these I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of the margarine. I used butter because it's what I had on hand. 5 stars! I made them again for a girls night to go with red wine and other nibbles. This time I added chopped candied ginger. Once they were cooled, I melted dark chocolate and drizzled it over the cookies. 6 stars!!

I added a couple tablespoons of finely diced crystalized ginger to give this recipe a special zing.  What a wonderful recipe, with or without the crystalized ginger.    For some reason, my dough was softer than it should have been.  The cookies came out wonderfully, but lacked the cracked top that's characteristic of this cookie.  But I'm sure that it was my fault.  I'll make this recipe over and over and over again.   What an unbelievable flavor.

4 not 5 because I didn't get the cracks on top like the picture.  Otherwise taste was good.  I added an extra tsp of ginger and 1/2 tsp of cardamon.  Not bad...Oh ya don't forget to flatten otherwise you will get a ball of soft ginger cookies.  Made exactly 24 cookies.

These came out amazingly well~! I baked them over a week ago, and the few we have left are still soft and tasty! I used fresh ginger since I didn't have any of the dried stuff, skipped the water, and they were great! I'm not sure what they would have tasted like with the dried ginger, but I plan to make them with fresh ginger from now on.  Mine didn't come out as pretty as the picture...they were completely smooth and not as dark.

I've made these cookies several times and they never last long.  These cookies are SO good that they even taste great if you, say, completely forget to put the ginger in.  Hypothetically, of course...;)

These fluffy, sweet ginger cookies are simply unbeatable! But, this is definitely a sticky dough! At first I was confused at what exactly I should do because my dad made these before and he said the dough wasn't sticky at all. So I added some more flour and then coated my hands with flour before I rolled it in a ball. Worked like magic! They turned out perfect, and I will be bringing these to my family's annual cookie exchange! So Good!!!

A few hints for those unsure...1. Get the "Mild Flavor" Molasses.  I wasn't sure which one to get, but the Mild is perfect if you don't like the flavor/don't know which one to get.  Full flavor one seemed too dangerous, and I would only recommend using it if you wanted the strong taste of molasses.  2. When making these by hand (without a mixer), do as the instructions say until you get to the "mix in the flower mixture to the molasses mixture" part.  Instead of using a wire wisk (which you should be using up to this point), instead use a wooden flat spatula and 'fold' in the flour mixture a bit at a time.  Works much better because this cookie batter is VERY sticky.  3. To make 2-inch cookies, put 2 tablespoons together of cookie dough, just a quick scrape with your finger to level it off makes the batter touch your hands less and gives you quicker ability to roll it in the sugar and get it on the cookie sheet.  By using this method you will get about 2 dozen + 6 cookies.   Also I don't know if it is my oven or what, but I ended up baking them 12 minutes minimum, and I even cooled for 5 minutes on the cookie sheet!  Good luck! :)

These are SO yummy.  Try dipping them in melted white chocolate...heaven!  I have never made them and not been asked for the recipe.  I can't imagine that the recipe could get any better, but I will try subbing the water for OJ next time and see what happens.  Thank you, Amy!

WOW! These are so good! I actually followed the advice of one review and cooled them on wax paper which made them a little crunchy on the outstide but soft on the inside. I rolled each cookie into a 1" ball and was able to get 50 small cookies out of it. I will definately make these again and again!

I have made a million ginger cookie recipes...and every single time, I have to add more fluid than is included in the ingredients! I'm not sure what I am doing wrong, but I had to add about 5 tablespoons of water to get it even close to normal consistency. After that, these were good lol!

Very good recipe.  Every time I make them they disappear quite quickly.    I increased the ginger to 1 T since I really want a ginger flavour.  Instead of water I've been using Triple Sec since I need to use it somewhere.  Since I want to get started on my Christmas baking, I've made the dough up to where the balls are rolled in sugar, then I'm freezing them.  It should be very simple to later thaw them and bake without a lot of mess.

My hubby said not to make these since he didn't like hard cookies.  I made them anyway and he said 'I'm not gonna like those."  All gone in two days and he asked me to make more!  These are awesome!

This recipe is true to "what they say they are" - i even halfed the recipe which meant 1 egg needed to be halfed (beat the one egg and use half the egg/yolk mixture). Cookies that definitley stay moist and chewy. wonderful.

I have been looking for a recipe to rival a molasses cookie I had 13 years ago.  This is it!!  I changed a few things butter instead of margerine, orange juice instead of water and fresh ginger.  It is the best cookie ever!!!

These cookies are as delicious as the reviews indicate. The spices blend beautifully and are in perfect ratio to one another.  I do, however, have one problem . My cookies come out flat! I have tried freezing the dough before baking. I have  used a baking stone as well as a regular cookie sheet with parchment paper. I've left them in a ball shape when baking. When I first remove them from oven, the are fairly puffy but when they cool...FLAT. Does anyone have a suggestion?

Delicious! Made it with orange juice and my 4-year-old would have eaten the whole batch if I let her.   But the top didn't crackle - any tips? Did I roll it too much?

These are my favorite cookies!  After making these cookies three times, I have settled on three minor modifications: 1 T vanilla, rather than water; half honey/half molasses, rather than all molasses; butter instead of margarine.  For me, a bake time of 8 minutes is perfect.  The cookies are soft, flavorful, and retain their freshness for a couple of days.

I'm a total believer in this soft spreadable cookie batter. But my mom hates spices :P. So when she ran out of her favorite icecream (Mocha Almond fudge) wednesday I made this custom cookie just for her.  Ingredients: Everything in the ginger cookie minus the ginger,  cloves, and cinnamon (though you could totally add any of those or just play around with your own idea, you know be creative!). Then My personal recipe calls for 1 cup chocolate chips, 1 teaspoon sour cream, 1 tablespoon chocolate sauce, 1 cup of chopped almonds or walnuts  and 1 1/2 tablespoons instant coffee.  Directions: Prepare cookie batter as you would if you were just baking the original recipe then seperate half the batter and move it to another bowl. In one half stir in nuts, in the other stir in Instant coffee and freeze for 30-45 minutes. In the meantime melt chocolate chips in the microwave or in a double burner until melted, take out and stir in sour cream and chocolate sauce until the shade of the chocolate darkens.  Take out batters and on a cookie sheet drop 1/2 a walnut sized ball then flatten with the back of a spoon to create a slight bowl shape. Take a spoonful of your chocolate sauce and fill the bowl then take a porportioned ball from the coffee batter (already flattened) and cover the chocolate and pinch the sides into the bottom cookie layer, repeat with the rest of you supplies.  Freeze uncooked cookies for about 35 minutes then pop them in a 350* oven and bake for about 15-17 min.

Would have given 5 stars, but they spread out more than MOST of the pictures show and mine all spread into one another.  Advise only 1/2 dozen per average baking sheet.

Awesome!My only complaint is that I didnt double the batch! I used butter but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I cant understand why so many people have had problems with this recipe. My dough was never overly sticky, more like a smooth, firm play do. I did chill for about 30 minutes before baking. I made slightly smaller size balls and then flattened them just a little. In thinking of what could have gone wrong for others my only tips are to never over-soften your butter/margarine. I only soften it enough to be able to cream it until fluffy with the sugar, then I add molasses and "fluff it up" some more. Then I add the egg. I combine all the dry ingredients in a seperate bowl first then add them to the butter mixture. Also, I never use a warm cookie pan. I rotate them so a totally cooled one is ready to take the next batch or the cookies start to spread to early. One last thing, mine did crack nicely...maybe because I didnt roll them too perfectly into a ball, if that makes sense? Not too smooth, the balls already had cracks in them. Hope this helps someone else!

I used 1 stick of baking margarine, 3/4 cup of sugar and I omitted the water. They were really good!  I also mixed the white sugar with some flour before I rolled the dough in it. Will make these again :)

This is the second time I have made these cookies. Both times I took advice from many reviews and chilled the dough before forming the cookies. Both times the cookies turned out flat as a pancake. Well, actually a pancake would be thicker than what I came up with. So halfway through baking, I added about 1/4 cup of flour to the dough.  So, I got to the last of the dough, it wasn't much, about 6 cookies worth. I didn't bother putting the dough back in the fridge/freezer. It wasn't working anyway. So I formed my 6 cookies, didn't bother flattening them either, and sprinkled some sugar on top.  Well, wouldn't you know it, the last 6 cookies turned out awesome. Nice and fat like they should be.  Lesson learned? Reviews can be very helpfull, and most of the time they tend to enhance the recipe. But it's usually a good idea to follow the recipe as is the first time, then take some of the recommendations given or come up with your own if you need to.   Regardless of how flat these came out for me, they tasted great.

These were a hit! I used orange juice instead of water and also made an orange glaze for the icing which was OJ concentrate, powdered sugar and vanilla.  I can't wait to make these again!

If you put the cookie dough in the refrigerator for at least 10-15 minutes, the dough will lose its stickiness. Promise!

These are awesome! I just pulled them out of the oven and one is in my mouth and another already in my tummy! SO GOOD! These would be great with hot chocolate on a rainy day or with lemonade in the summer. Followed recipe exactly with the exception of substituting O.J. for the Tablespoon of water. I work at a bakery and the secret to good baking is not over-creaming the butter and sugar. I've learned that room temperature butter or margarine is too soft. The margarine should be soft to the touch but still have a slight firmness to it. Also, cut the margarine into several chunks or cubes before creaming to aid in the even mixing. I threw the dough in the fridge for only 10 minutes then sprayed my hands lightly with PAM and rolling the balls was a no mess cinch! Enjoy!! These are surely going on my favorites list!

I am giving these cookies 5 stars because they came out perfect as far as consistency, they baked just fine, they were soft and all the recipe promises they would be. BUT... I have not been super impressed with these cookies & it's a matter of personal taste.  I found them a bit too spicy & slightly overpowered by the ginger. Maybe that's exactly how they should taste for those who like them so that's why I didn't give this recipe a lower rating. I'll try them again using less ginger maybe we'll like them better less spicy.  For those having problems with the dough here's one thing that might have caused these cookies to come out wrong: the flour. I read somewhere that the age and humidity level of flour will change the end result of a recipe. Many times when baking I find myself using less or more flour then the recipe stated simply because I feel & see the dough needs those adjustments to be made. This dough in particular feels soft but comes off the sides of the bowl very easily. It is moist and not heavily floured like other cookies. Feeling it you would think it should be impossible to shape into balls but surprisingly the walnut size balls simply stay together & you can even flatten them with the bottom of a glass cup. If the dough is way too soft & you can't get it to shape, add a tablespoon or two more flour until you get the right consistency, making sure the dough doesn't loose its softness and moisture.

Delicious cookies! I pressed a single piece of honey roasted pecan on each cookie as soon as they were out of the oven. I also added a little bit of grated fresh nutmeg for added kick. I also used Robin Hood NutriBlend flour instead of All Purpose.

I substituted 1 cup whole wheat flour for 1 cup of flour and Splenda Sugar Blend for the sugar and they still turned out fabulous.    This cookie gives the good old chocolate chip cookie a run for it's money.

I think these vary according to the variety and quality of ingredients used, the baking time, and the baking pans! Molasses- we used blackstrap; ginger and spices were very fresh; eggs were farm-fresh, etc., and I used unsalted butter. Maybe margarine makes a difference in softness. Certainly, creaming the butter would have a lot to do with it, as it incorporates necessary air bubbles for softness. LETTING THE DOUGH SIT and REFRIGERATE was an essential step, so I'm glad I read previous reviews. Only changes were the butter, OJ for water, and the addition 1/2 tsp. of cardamom. It takes a bit to get the thickness right-don't go thinner than a quarter inch. And last but not least, timing is everything. Overbaking is worse than underbaking, because the crispy ones were just not as exciting. Watch the time carefully. They will be soft when you remove them from the oven.

Thanks for the recipe!  These are my new favorite cookies.  I double the batch and didn't change a thing except the cooking time.  I cooked them for about 12 minutes.  They were a little doughy when cooked for 10 minutes.  I'm going to make 2 triple batches for Christmas gifts this week!

Really a great cookie, although I had difficulty handling the dough.  I added 1/2 cup more flour and added just a smidge more of each spice, made the cookies more fluffy.  Next time I'll refrigerate like others suggested.  It still was a great cookie.

1300 people can't be wrong.  These cookies are fantastic - soft, chewy, full of flavor... If Christmas had a taste, this would be it.  I followed the recipe exactly, without any modifications.  So now that I know that works, next time I'll try subbing orange juice for the water, like one person mentioned.

I was disappointed in these and surprised by all the great reviews.  Followed the recipe to a t, until the cooking time.

Even at baking for 10 minutes and resting for 5, they were mushy and greasy and I had a hard time getting them off the pan.  I cooked the second set/sheet for 15 minutes, rest for 5, and this seemed to work better.  

I found the cookies to be very greasy.  I think this is where the soft comes in, too much butter.

I have a recipe for ginger cookies from my local spice shop that I will stick with.

These cookies are wonderful!  For those of you who have trouble with the dough being too sticky to roll into balls, I have a tip.  I always dip my fingers in water and rub the water onto the palms of my hands before rolling the cookies. Your hands should be just damp, not dripping wet.  Keep a cup of water on the counter because you will have to do this after every few cookies.  It works like a charm!

First try...awesome! I used 1 tsp of cinnamon instead of 3/4 and I rolled the dough in raw sugar for added crunchiness! I think next time I'll increase the ginger to 2 1/2, maybe 3 teaspoons just to give it an extra kick!

these cookies came out good but i was expecting more ginger flavour and a softer texture
*update* made them again and doubled the ginger, added 1 tsp or so water and baked them at 340F instead - came out great!!! made awesome ice-cream sandwiches!!!

Wow!  What a kick these have.  But that's a good kick!  I followed the recipe as stated, except subbing the margarine with "I Can't Believe it's Not Butter" and added "Sugar Cookie Icing" tinted orange from this site as a drizzle on the top (though unnecessary--cookie is wonderful on its own).  I personally felt the ginger when I finished eating the cookie, but the taste just far outweighs that fact.  Also, I gave this 5 stars b/c my co-workers loved them and did not seem, in the least bit, to mind the pungent taste.  Some cookies don't end up pretty, but this one makes a beautiful presentation!  Also, no need to place the dough in the fridge--just scoop it with a spoon into the sugar and immediately roll.  The less you handle the dough, the less trouble you have with stickiness.

No wonder this recipe is so popular and the highest rated. These are incredible. I followed the recipe to a "t" and used my small #40 scoop to make medium sized cookies. My intent was to make them smaller to make sandwich cookies. I used the Gingerbread Icing from this site and that really make these cookies even more incredible. I can already tell these will go fast no matter where I take them! NOTE: I have made this with butter and they do tend to spread, even after chilling for a couple hours. Try to make this with margerine if you can and making them a little on the small side. They do spread a bit, but if you use margerine and chill the dough, it's not AS bad.

Wow! I've never been a fan of ginger cookies (because they are usually so hard and clove-flavored) but these are delicious! I didn't have a sifter so I just stirred the dry ingredients together really well and it seemed to work fine. Also, I coated my hands in flour to work with the dough instead of oil like someone else suggested and it seemed to help quite a bit so I didn't end up with hands an inch thick in cookie dough!

This recipe is nearly identical to the Martha Stewart Living recipe. It's an excellent cookie, but leave out the water, add an additional 2 tbls of molasses and 1/2 cup of brown sugar and chill for 2 hours. Follow these additions and you won't have any spreading.

Yummola!  Some other reviewers mentioned the stickiness of the dough when forming balls. The dough *is* indeed sticky - infact, it's pointless to try forming them into balls with your hands, so my suggestion is to just use a small spoon and scoop out a little dough, then drop it in the sugar and once it gets tossed in the sugar, it's easy to handle.  Once all the cookies were on the pan, I just took a juice glass, sprayed the bottom with non-stick spray and 'stamped' them all flat. Worked like a charm and took seconds!  I love this recipe - really delicious and classic and also easy!  I brought these on a 10 hour car ride back to my hometown and they stayed super soft and fresh.  My family ate 'em like savages.

These are really, really good.  Don't worry that the dough is too soft to handle with your hands.  Just drop scoops of it into a bowl of sugar and swish them around in there.  No big deal.  I would personally make a few changes, but only because of my own tastes - the recipe is actually fine the way it is.  I would sub orange juice for the water (it brings out the ginger flavor), and decrease the sugar in the recipe to 3/4 cup (it was a little too sweet for me, and the sugar on the outside adds sweetness).  I would DEFINITELY use butter instead of margarine.  The flavor is so much better!  I also add a quarter teaspoon of chili powder or black pepper (trust me on this).  It sounds awful, but you don't taste it at all - it just makes the cookies spicier.  DELISH!  This recipe made about 27 three-inch cookies for me.

If you are thinking about trying them. Just do it! They are amazing! Followed the recipe exactly minus cinnamon (allergies here) and the first batch I wanted so badly I didn't roll them or anything just blobs on the pan. YUM! Today I rolled them round and rolled in sugar! Definitely worth the extra work but still very good yesterday. I baked them a little longer and got crispy outside and chewy soft insides.

THE BEST!  AMAZING!  sometimes I use 1/4 C applesauce, 1/2 C butter...but full butter is the best.  Thanks for sharing!
Because these have been a favorite of ours -I have adapted them for my son's sugar & wheat-free diet...using honey & enough spelt flour to form a good, workable dough (obviously I didn't roll them in sugar...).  These were the FIRST wheat & sugar-free cookie that taste like a million bucks!  Now my son enjoys these as much as we do - a real treat!  THANK-YOU AGAIN!

Amazing soft ginger cookies! Very pleasant taste. Like a gingersnap but without the 'snap'! Perfect spices without the 'biting' aftertaste of a gingersnap cookie which I found to be very appealing and pleasing to the palate. Truth be told, this was the most requested recipe on my Christmas cookie platter this season! So easy to make. I must say that I followed the recipe exactly and had no problems with sticky, gooey dough as some reviewers expressed. I think I baked mine for 8-9 minutes as my oven temp seems to be a tad off. Next time I will substitute O.J. for the water as some others have suggested. They store beautifully in a plastic container. These were wonderful Amy, thanks so much for sharing your recipe ~

I'm giving this five stars because I think it's a versatile recipe.  I have to admit I sabotaged it when I substituted crisco + 1/4 t butter flavoring since I didn't have margarine.  Both margarine and crisco are hydrogenated which can give baked goods a lighter texture.  I was also out of all purpose flour so I used self-rising instead.  All this and the cookies STILL turned out good!  In the future I would add a little more spice, and do the OJ substitution for water to give a little more kick.  I love recipes I can't ruin!!!

These cookies were a hit! Based on other suggestions, I used butter instead of margarine and sprayed my hands with a little bit of Pam before rolling the cookies into balls, which helped prevent stickiness. I didn't have any cloves but it didn't seem to make much of a difference. The cookies had the perfect amount of ginger flavor and came out incredibly soft. One batch made 50 cookies, which was perfect for our Sunday football party.

My daughter considers herself an expert on ginger cookies and she said these were the best. I did find the dough a bit too soft to form into balls so I just dropped teaspoonfuls onto a cookie sheet. They held their shape very well too. I'll definitely make these again. Many Thanks.

Pretty good but something's missing...maybe not enough spices? Still...texture wise, they're great - a little bit crispy on the outside and soft/chewy on the inside.
Update: Made them again but with butter instead of margarine, lesson - don't use butter!

I bake these cookies at least once a month and they are always a crowd pleaser.  Out of the thousands I have made NOT ONE SINGLE PERSON has ever not liked them.  I sub butter for margarine and always throw in a little extra spice.  Just letting the dough sit on the counter for 5 minutes helps them not stick.  Make double cuxz your gonna eat a dozen by yourself.

Yummy! 3 people have said these are the best ginger cookies they have ever had! The dough is sticky. I made the first half with unchilled dough, used a small ice cream like scoop to form the cookie and dropped it in the sugar, those came out yummy! The second half were formed the same way, but because they were chilled they were fluffier. It is worth chilling the dough in the freezer for 20 min if you can afford the time! Otherwise, they are still great!!

they are great-would say the dough is very sticky after mixing, almost think they needed more flour but i used a cookie scoop and dropped them into the sugar and finger rolled them and instantly they dried up- the cookie is great - everyone who hated ginger cookies really enjoyed them - will make them again - making them for church lunch know everyone will love them -= thank you very much---

This recipe is wonderful!  I could eat the whole thing myself.  I substituted the OJ for water as recommended in another review and it turned out wonderful.  Dough keeps well in the fridge overnight (or for a few days) if need be.  Next time I may try icing them.

"Soft" is right.  The cookie dough is like cake batter and virtually impossible to "roll" into anything.  Even after putting the dough in the fridge overnight, I had to use two spoons to work back and forth to drop it into the sugar (and you'll need WAY more than 1/2 a cup of that).  The cookies come out like round, flat cake.  Sadly, we're not a fan of this cookies texture or general taste at all, and we love ginger/molasses cookies.  The flavor was 'alright' but soooo not worth the mess and work.  Back to my tried and true recipe.

These cookies are exactly what the name says "Soft".  I followed the recipe exactly except I did refrigerate the dough for approximately 1 hour so it was easy to work with. I only baked them 9 minutes so even if they look like they are not done, they are.  They stay soft in the cookie jar without even a slice of bread (which I use to keep my cookies soft).  Wonderful recipe.  My neighbor was over and tried one, and I had to make a copy of the recipe to give her.  Thanks.

This were amazing, Everyone loved them. My Friends mother said she didn't like ginger. But after she tried them she said she loved them and had another one. I baked 24 and they were gone within a hour or me putting them out for everyone. And they were prety easy to make.

I love this recipe and have made it several times. Although the dough was a little sticky, I had no problem rolling them into balls and then in the sugar. I also chop crystalized ginger and add it to the dough for an extra surprise kick.

Quick, super easy, and very tasty!  A littly sticky, but it's too be expected.  There is molasses in it, after all!  I made them very small, and they came out a little crispy on the outside, but soft on the inside.  Perfect!

My husband was asking for soft ginger cookies like his mom makes, and I'm so glad that I found this recipe. They smell wonderful and taste even better. I used butter, and brown sugar. I also used white sugar to roll them in, but it takes alot more than called for. I didn't mush them down before sticking them in the oven. Next time I'll chill them in the fridge before rolling them cause they are awfully sticky.

These are completely incredible... One thing I would recommend -- mixing more ground ginger with the caster sugar before being baked... my little sister loved how they look glittery! and even the tray that looked slightly overdone remain wonderfully chewy.

These were fantastic! My family was eating them as fast as I could get them baked. I followed the recipe ingredients exactly. The only thing I didn't do on the second batch is flatten them slightly before baking. I found they stayed a bit more fluffy just leaving them rolled in a ball. Moist, tasty, perfect! Thanks for the recipe!

my sister and i are borderline obsessed with these cookies, and i only made them a few hours ago.
i made mine tiny, about an inch in diameter, so i ended up with tons of cookies. i also substituted butter for margarine and orange juice for water. oh, and to help cope with the sticky dough, i sprayed my hands with nonstick cooking spray. it worked wonderfully. loooove these cookies.

Love these cookies, have made them three times in two weeks, they don't last a day! Used the OJ in place of water also. I also like to make thm a little bigger. This is a keeper!!! Put a slice of white bread in the container with finished cookies to keep them moist.

Amazing!! If gingerbread and snickerdoodles had a baby it would be these cookies. They were simple and delicious. My only change was using real butter instead of margarine. Double the batch, they'll go quick.

Great yummy cookies! I love these cookies but next time I make them I will try it with orange juice instead of water (like some other reviewers suggested) to see what it tastes like.

Yummy! I accidently baked them a little too long and they ended up burnt on the bottom but still good. 8 min is perfect. I want to try it with the orange juice next time and maybe less butter to be more chewy. And I wonder how it would taste if I substituted apple sauce for some of the butter.

I made with 1c whole wheat flour & 1-1/2c white and sprinkled colored sugar on the top only - other than that no changes - they came out great - big, soft but not gooey, and tasty!

This cookie is THE cookie for the holidays! It is crispy/chewy, full of good ginger flavor, and was the perfect cookie to bake on a cold, snowy Oklahoma day. I used butter instead of margarine and half brown sugar. Wonderful recipe that is going straight into the 5-star folder of My Recipe Box!

Absolutely amazing cookies.  I followed the other suggestion and used 2.5 cups of flour and that definitely helped with the dough, while not taking away from the taste.  I would use a little bit more ginger (maybe 3 tsps) and a little less margarine.  I also added the crushed seeds of two illaichi (for those who know what that is) and that was definitely a plus.  A final suggestion: the cookies were still pretty doughy after only 8 minutes.  I ended up baking at 350 for closer to 15 minutes.  And for purely aesthetic purposes, do not flatten at all when placing on the baking sheet.

These were excellent.  Most of the first batch I made I sent away as a gift!  They came out crisp on the outside but soft on the inside and were delicious.
I tried to figure out exactly how many minutes they needed and finally settled on 11 minutes as perfect.  I needed a bit more than 2 Tbsp of sugar for the finally rollings! :-)

These were really yummy!  The baking time was a bit tricky for me, since after 8 minutes they were still very raw inside... 11 minutes is what worked best for me. I tried the next sheet at 13 minutes (which was when they finally looked "done" and not gooey in the middle), but once they cooled those weren't as soft as the first batch.  So as a heads up, these will still look a little underdone when you pull them out, but that's what keeps them soft over time.  Yum!

So far, this is my favorite ginger cookie recipe.  (And I've tried at least six of them on this site alone.)  It's stays soft as long as you don't overbake them and the spices are perfect.  I tried the recommendation about mixing a little black pepper in with the sugar before rolling, and I really liked it.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very gourmet tasting cookies.  I can't wait to make ice cream sandwiches or sandwich cookies with them.  I used butter instead of margarine and since we can't get molasses here, I substituted honey.  I also used an electric mixer to work with the wet ingredients and still had the "too runny to roll into a ball" problem.  I just used a teaspoon to drop the dough on the cookie sheets and sprinkled them with the extra sugar.  They turned out practically perfectly round still, so I don't think rolling into a ball is a necessary step.  These are incredible "adult" feeling cookies, although the kids loved them, too.

These were awesome; next time, I will make a double batch! I followed the recipe, and per review suggestions, chilled the dough about an hour. I then used a small ice cream scoop to transfer the dough to sugar; didn't have much trouble with the stickiness.

These are fantastic and very addictive! I always increase the spices a bit because I like a strong flavored ginger cookie. I also add some powdered ginger to the sugar that you roll the cookies in for extra ginger flavour. Once instead of rolling the balls in sugar I flattened the cookies and put some chopped crystallized ginger on top - that was yummy too! Also, I have found that I can safely use 1/2 c. of butter/margarine instead of 3/4 c. and they still turn out great (maybe even better).

If you cover the dough and let sit for about an hour, they become very "puffy" when you bake them.  Yum!!

Let me just say first of all that the current picture displayed of these cookies do not do them justice.  I'm going to send one in the next time I make these wonderful cookies.  Mine were a darker, richer caramel color and puffed up a bit more.  They just looked so good and turned out perfectly! :)

It's quick, it's easy and it's delicious - what more can you ask for in a recipe.  Kids love them, husband loved them, co-workers loved them - not a complaint to be found.  My daughter told me they were the best cookies i've ever made.  

I did set the dough in the freezer while I cleaned up my counters and in between batches to keep it firm - made it much easier to work with.  All of these cookies disappeared within two days and everyone wants more.  I will definately be making these again and again.  Thanks for the great recipe, Amy!

When I make this recipe I double it and freeze the dough after I roll it into balls.  I put the dough balls with sugar in a large freezer bag and thaw them out and cook as many as I want.  I always have these in my freezer.  They are a fave of mine!

The dough was very sticky, I would freeze the dough for a while prior to baking. Apart from this, these cookies are excellent! My husband and I are sending them to family and friends for the Holidays. Just a tip, you really do need to place these cookies 2 inches apart.

Other people really liked these, but I thought they were rather dry and too cake-like. I prefer chewy cookies, which there were not. I also iced them  using another recipes from allrecipes.com and that seemed to help, but I don't know if I'd make them again.

I've never attempted to make ginger cookies in the past and found this recipe to be easy and delicious. I only added half a tblsp of water and rolling was fine, also baked for just over 7 mins. Have given these cookies to ppl who claim to hate ginger cookies and they love them. Still chewy after 4 days. Great recipe!

I didn't run into the problem with the dough being too soft and sticky to work with that other reviewers have mentioned. It was gooier than other doughs, but not unmanageable. I wouldn't try rolling it, though. I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/4 cup shortening instead of the 3/4 cup margarine called for. Very tasty cookies that live up to their soft name. A nice change from the rich, chocolately items I have already baked for the holidays.

I made these while I was cooking dinner.  That's how easy they were.  And baking is not anywhere close to being my forte.  In fact, baking and I don't get along at all.  Anyway, my husband (who hates ginger cookies) ate so many I thought he was going to die.  My daughter loved them, and so did everyone at my synagogue (some people snuck some home...).  What a great recipe!  Thank you so much!

The cookies came out just as you said, soft and chewy although the dough was too wet to handle even after adding 1/2 cup more flour!  Excellent taste.

I make these cookies at least 10x over the Fall/Winter season every year!! Everyone loves them, including my insanely picky son. They also freeze very well. Don't be fooled by their "ugly" (boring/flat) appearance... They are delicious and very addicting. Chewy and perfectly spiced. You can definitley crank up the spices a little if you like a spicy cookie. Also, I personally think margarine is gross so I use ALL BUTTER! I use salted butter and omit the 1/4-tsp of salt. Also, definitely swap the water for ORANGE JUICE! It makes all the difference. Note to Self: Bake on light-coloured cookie sheets @ 325 in convection oven for 9-min - perfect! 1 batch = 29 cookies (using mini ice-cream scoop).

Followed the recipe exactly, turned out beautifully! I have never made ginger cookies or gingerbread before, so I was really nervous, but these turned out great. They are yummy and LOOK really good, too! I was snapping lots of photos, I was so impressed with how they turned out. Next day, after putting them in a sealed Tupperware container, they are almost softer than they were when I first baked them. Had no problems rolling the dough, though other reviewers have mentioned it. I made the recipe as directed, rolled the dough into balls, dipped it in sugar, and flattened it a little bit on the cookie sheet. No issues, they turned out great! They look like store bought cookies, they are so pretty. Just love how they look. :) Delicious cookies, highly recommend. Definitely making these next Christmas for friends and family!

This was the 1st time I made gingerbread cookies, the flavor turned out spot on! I I followed the recipe exactly, except using butter instead of margarine. After the first pan came out of the oven I decided to chill the dough in the fridge for 30 mind. I this made a HUGE difference in the appearance. I they weren't as flat, which I liked! Regardless if that the flavour is delicious, and will definitely be making these again. Topped mine with sprinkles before baking. I might try using 1/2 teas. Of baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda next time.

I added a 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper and threw in about 3/4 cup crystallized ginger nibs that I had sitting around. I didn't even have to refrigerate the dough before I rolled out the balls, as others reviewers mentioned. My issue with this cookie is the margarine. There was an off-putting flavor from the margarine that reminded me why I only make my cookies with butter. With a different type of fat, I'd like these a lot more.

This is a wonderful recipe it's just they were good when I took them of the oven ,but when I cooled them and tried them they were as hard as rocks my family could not eat them without dipping them in milk till they were soft (I was not pleased because they were hard and the name of these cookies are big SOFT cookies) I can't rate tis recipe a lot because I could not eat them a lot if someone has advise please do share??. Other then that thy were great!

These are awesome!! I made mine bigger, so I get a dozen out of this recipe. I spray my hands with cooking spray when rolling them. Doesn't stick to your hands. Then cover with sugar and put on cookie sheet. I don't have to flatten them when I make them bigger. They turn out great!

These got snarfed down. They came out perfectly soft and chewy without feeling underbaked. I didn't have the margarine on hand so ended up using the salted butter I had. Left out the salt the recipe called for and it ended up fine. I also took another reviewer's advice and used orange juice in place of the water. I did not have any trouble working with the dough immediately.

I made a few changes to this recipe-- honey instead of molasses, skipped the clove and salt, and used unsalted butter, not margarine. The consistency was the same, and the cookies turned out better than I had hoped. See photo. Soft and delicious!

Delicious. Moist. Chewy. 
Totally easy to bake.
I tried a batch, icing the cooking with thin ribbons of a light maple sugar buttercream and discovered how overwhelmingly awesome these cookies are.  Fantastic recipe.

I read most of the reviews and substituted OJ instead of water. I omitted 1/4 c. sugar because when I dropped the balls into the sugar and rolled them, it made them super sweet. It's easier to deal with if you let the dough sit a few minutes and just spoon it right into the sugar. Also, I did what most reviewers said and put the balls into the fridge for 10 min while oven heated. I only lightly patted them down (hardly at all) and they came out perfect. I did FULL teaspoon balls of dough and I actually had tons of extra cookies. They are smaller but perfect for cookie exchanges. 3 batches made 94 cookies for me and a few extra for tasting. I put the dough balls on paper plates and then made the batches on two dark non-stick pans at 8 min per pan with 2 min cooling then moved to rack. I added extra 1/4 tsp of ginger to last batch and they are a little more spicy (yum)! photo shows plated balls, pan balls slightly smashed, then finished cookie. They are really soft.

YUMLY!!!  These are really easy cookies and the taste is just wonderful....a bit of crunch, soft center and just enough spice.  Here are a few things I did to slightly tweek this good recipe:

1. Used all butter instead of margarine
2. Used 1/2c white and 1/2c brown sugar
3. Used orange juice instead of water (as others have)
4. Used about 1/8t more ginger (I like a strong ginger flavor)
5. Put batter in fridge 1 hour before rolling and in between batches
6. Used a melon baller to scoop out the batter, rolled quickly, lightly pressed and dipped tops only in sugar
7. Used parchment paper on my cookie sheet
8. Baked for 8 1/2 minutes

Easy and perfect!

These turned out very good!  A couple notes to help with the process that I had to figure out myself.  After realizing the dough was pretty wet/tough to deal with, I just started scooping heaping tablespoons of the dough, dropping it into the sugar and moving the bowl around to coat it, once they are sugar coated they are much easier to move to the baking sheet.  I did the cookies in two batches, the first batch I took out at about 9 minutes, thinking they were done and they deflated/flattened out a bit when cooling.  The next batch I baked for a solid 10 minutes, making sure they were slightly browned and they turned out incredibly soft/airy and held their shape...perfect!

My favourite cookies ever! For those who get flat cookies - add 1 teaspoon of cream of tartar. You'll get that lovely "cracked" look. Yum!

These were pretty good, but mine didn't look like the picture. Also, don't listen to the reviewer who said that the cookies will look underdone, but they will be done at 8 minutes. I took mine out and ended up trashing the whole batch because the were a big gooey mess. Mine took 10 minutes to cook. I didn't alter the recipe in any way.

Fantastic Cookies.  Even tastier with the addition of 2 tablespoons of crystalized ginger during the final stir. Then bake as directed.

These soft and chewy cookies are a big hit with our family and friends. i even get requests throughout the year proving they are not just for Christmas. They can be rolled in sugar and cinnamon like Tom Thumb doughnuts or baked as is.

Everyone in my family loves this recipe. The problem with these cookies are that they are super addictive. Only thing I changed on it is that I added some of the spices to the 2 tbs of sugar at the end. Gives the cookies an extra little bite to them.

Yummy.  Not too sweet.  I actually chilled the dough for a few minutes before shaping it and I did not roll in additional sugar.  This is a keeper.

We really like these. In fact when I make them for my sister-in-law she hides them in her bedroom so her family won't eat them before she can enjoy them herself. I use butter instead of margarine, and portion the dough with a #40 disher to make uniformly-sized cookies. They really are big, so I only put six on a large cookie sheet.

These cookies are wonderful! They make me wonder why I don't cook with molasses more often?! I made my cookies a little smaller, so ended up with 50. I also skipped rolling them in sugar and instead drizzled some spice icing over them. Delicious!

They're good, they're just not '5 stars' good. I added nutmeg and vanilla and put the dough in the fridge for 30 mins - its too soft to work otherwise.

Delicious soft ginger cookies. Mild in flavor....my Mom doesn't like ginger but actually ASKED for the recipe. She said she enjoyed them so much she couldn't wait to bake a batch!

I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with a really gooey dough! I added over a cup more flour and still had to put in the fridge for an hr. Even after the fridge it was to slimey to roll in your hand so I dropped spoonfuls in a bowl of sugar then baked. Still tasted great!

I made these and brought them to work on a Monday morning when the guys I work with have their meetings. I put them in the kitchen for everyone to try. One guy came out to get coffee, he took a cookie, went back to the meeting, came back out and grabbed the whole bag and went back in the meeting...not 1 cookie made it back out! The ladies in the office missed out haha! I will be making these again, they are excellent!!

So so good and a hit at all my holiday gatherings!  I had no need to flatten these before baking.  Stayed fresh and chewy for weeks, stored in "tupperware" on the counter.  Will definitely make these again and again :)

These cookies are very good, however, i expected them to be less cakey-soft and more chewy, and prefer a bit more spicey "zap" when the flavor of the cookie hits your taste buds. They baked up appearing just as in the photo, but i got 36 cookies when rolling walnut-sized pre-baked portions.

Dough was too sticky! I'm still trying to figure out what I did wrong because the dough was way too sticky and I couldn't mold them into a ball. I even added about 1/2 cup more flour and still nothing. I checked out other member's reviews to see if anyone was having the same problem, but it seems like it was just me.

Made these cookies tonight for my family and they were delicious. Added in a bit more cinnamon and substituted the water for orange juice as someone else suggested previously. They turned out great. Dough wasn't sticky or hard to work with, very easy cookie to put make. I am bringing them to work tomorrow. Will definitely make them again!

What's the big deal???  These cookies were just okay and they sure didn't come out looking like the picture.  When I saw the amount of rave reviews this recipe got, I thought surely it would be a winner.  Boy was I wrong!  Good thing I baked a big batch of my Blondies.  That was the only thing that saved the day for me.  Everybody raved about those...no one said a thing about these Ginger Cookies.  Can't say I blamed them!  Nobody wanted to take home the leftovers.  I knew I should have stuck with Martha Stewart's recipe instead.

Thus was a great recipe. I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I also used 1/2 cup butter and 1/4 cup regular Crisco (fill a measuring cup with 3/4 cup water, then add crisco unti the water hits the 1 cup line). I also use just a tad more water, and chilled the dough for maybe 15 mins and in between batches.  I cooked the cookies only 8 per sheet after rolling them in white sugar and flattening them slightly on the sheet - 24 total. They came out beautifully and just like the photo. Oh - and they were delicious too!

I just recently baked these cookies and the first batch came out so good, I started working on the second right away.  Perfect for the Holiday season.  Really easy to make (I have very little experience baking).  I don't even like molasses, but it fits perfectly into this recipe.

UPDATE: I tried making this with regular molasses, didn't work as well.  The flavor was sweet like a sugar cookie, and the mixture was gooey and hard to handle.  Wholesome Sweeteners Fair Trade Organic Molasses works best with these cookies.

To get cookies that look like the picture use real butter instead of margarine. Also, I used a cookie scoop to make the balls and then did the final roll with my hands. Works well without the mess. These cookies taste wonderful and people love them!

Excellent!  Very flavorful and so delicious.  I can't stop eating them.  Mine didn't crack on the top like some of the pictures. I would have liked that but it didn't happen for me.  They did not spread as much as I thought they would; mine were kind of small.  You can't go wrong with this recipe.  Wonderful!

I just made a batch of these cookies except for subbing butter for the margarine and using half brown sugar half white instead of all white sugar per some recoomendations, my only problem is that it didn't crack, they taste wonderful!!! BUT I kind of liked the cracked look of them, I wonder if it's because of the substitutions. But we love them and they will make yummy Xmas gifts for this year!

My daughter-in-law and I made these for Christmas, and since it said it only made two dozen, we decided to double the batch right away.  She made them walnut-sized, and we got 8 1/2 dozen!  About the size I like, anyway!  She didn't have any trouble with the dough at all, and 8 minutes in the oven was perfect.  Will try the suggestion of orange juice instead of water next time! Nice, none of the spices overpower in this cookie. They were crispy on the edges and soft inside!

I've made these several time, and adore them! I don't like the crunchiness of ginger snaps, but love the flavor, so these are perfect! Delicious, easy, and so pretty when they're finished!

Chill the dough and then scoop into balls and let the kids roll 'em in sugar.  Flatten with a fork like you would a peanut butter cookie.  Best freakin' Christmas cookie ever made.  Swear!

I'm only giving these 3 stars because they tasted good and were very soft except mine came out to be paper thin and about 10 inches in diameter! I husband and family liked them and thought they were neat, but I was disappointed because this is not what the pictures looked like and what other people described. Not sure what went wrong here. But I will try to make again later.

These cookies are UNBELIEVABLE!  I am making them now, and they have rocketed to the top of my Christmas cookie list.  I did as others have suggested and refrigerated the dough over night which makes the dough very easy to handle.   Using  a ceramic ice cream scoop for portion size, then rolling them into balls about the size of a golf ball.  I have then dropped them into powdered sugar for a crackle effect, although the sugar seems to melt and disappear.... Adds a nice hint of extra sweetness though!   Flattened with a large metal spoon to press them out on the baking sheet.  Oh, also did as someone suggested and substituted the 2 Tbs water for Spiced rum.  You gotta try these cookies!  Thanks for the great recipe, will be on the family list for years to come.

I would give this a ten star rating. They are that good!! Made as is and I baked for 8 minutes. The dough looked to soft and doughy so I baked a little 3 min.longer. When I let the first pan set I noticed the cookies got darker and they were hard. Do not over bake these cookies. I put in the second pan and only baked for 8 min and when I took it out of the oven and let it cool off, they were just the way I liked them. Firm along the edges and soft in the middle. At first bite was very moist and could taste the flavor of all the spices. I love this recipe.

honestly, these are one of the best cookies ever.  TIP:  to keep them soft, just add a slice of bread to your cookie container..works like a charm.I am making these for a cookie exchange, and I think after a while, everyone gets tired of chcolate and pb based cookies. didn't have powdered ginger so used 3 tsp. fresh ginger(Gourmet Garden brand in the tube). rolled in turbino sugar. used the large size pampered chef cookie scoop and got exactly 2 dozen. *I used butter flavored shortening and the dough was perfect to work with; didn't have to put in fridge at all. beautiful presentation, and these again are just scrumptious.

Fabulous! First time I made gingerbread. Soft chewy and yummy. Follow the directions, and they will come out perfect. I made one batch (what I thought were walnut size) and they came to 46 cookies about 2-3.5 inches wide. Just the right size for me and the kids.  Dont hesitate if you are looking for a gingercookie.

Very good, everyone loved these exactly as the recipe stated. I did not find the dough hard to work with however They did not "crack" like in the picture. In my opinion they came out a bit too soft (possibly under baked by following the exact time listed) but it did not stop my family from devouring them in one night.

I did not care for this recipe.  I could forgive the so-so taste of the cookie, but the dough is miserably sticky to work with.  If you are not a very skilled/experienced baker (I certainly am not) then you should stay away from this recipe.

These are perfect. I follow the recipe as is. Another reviewer said they needed to sit before rolling them. I haven't found this to be the case whenever I make them. These are a favorite for our family. Enjoy!

Very good cookies.  I find that I could taste the molasses a bit more than what I normally like.  I tried making gingerbread men with these, and it didn't quite work.  They stayed very soft though, which is great and everyone loves them!

These were ever so chewy and soft but they weren't big. They came out flat and didn't have any cracks. To some reviewers who had sticky dough, increase the flour to 2 1/2 cups or let dough sit in the refrigerator for up to a half an hour. Other changes I made included using 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar, and used 1 T of orange juice. Other than that these were pretty good. My go-to ginger cookie.

Very good, BUT different from what everyone else's result. I got a crunchy cookie :) probably because I baked for nearly 15min as it just did not brown! The taste was awesome, would def. bake these again and again. Changes made: brown instead of white sugar, butter instead of margarine, white wine instead of water, no molasses as I didn't have any, added some peanuts, used allspice instead of cinnamon.

Just as advertised, big soft gingerbread cookies! They were good enough that both my daughter and husband were eating them off the pan as soon as I admitted they were cool enough to eat :P

One and only change I would make is to play with the spices next time for a bolder flavor. But that is just a personal thing!

These cookies are phenomenal! I follow the recipe exactly except I reduce the cloves to 1/4 tsp. I used cookie sheets lined with parchment paper. I did not have problems rolling the dough into little balls. Once the balls were rolled in sugar, I flattened slightly with the palm of my hand. Baked them for 9 minutes at 350F and out cake 35 delicious big, soft, gingerbread cookies!

As I was home on a Sunday morning with only 1 of my 3 children I decided it was time to do some long over due baking.  I was looking for new recipes to try, with then choosing the best few to make and give out at Christmas time.  I found this recipe and wasn't too sure about it but decided I would give it a shot.  OH MY GOSH.....these are the BEST cookies I have ever made.  I followed the recipe to a T, with refrigerating the dough for about an hour before rolling into balls.  They turned out so soft and pure amazing.  Everyone loves them, even all my day care children.  Thank you for such an awesome recipe.

i've made this recipe plenty of times with my changes & the original version & they are still yummy & delicious every time. the recipe isn't an original though. if you look at a jar of "grandma's molasses" this is the recipe on their bottle. it's the same except on the bottle there are 2 teaspoons of baking soda vs 1 listed here but every other ingredient listed here is the same as the recipe on grandma's molasses bottle. first off i use real butter .i place the dough in the fridge for a few hours up to overnight so that it can be firm & less sticky. since these spices are pumpkin pie spices i just cut out a step & add a tablespoon or 2 of pp spice and then add 2 teaspoons & a little extra of ground ginger. the other spices as the recipe lists, more or less to taste. i like for my ginger cookies to be spicy & i want to taste the ginger which is why i add extra. i use oat flour instead of white but just my choice. organic sugar or evap cane juice, depends on my mood. i only use a 1/2 cup of sugar since i started making this because 1 whole cup + molasses signals diabetic coma to me lol 1/2 cup is just right,sweet but not overtly. sometimes i'll use 2 egg whites to equal 1 egg to cut some calories but no one can tell when i do. if you bake it longer don't worry, it takes on a ginger snap consistency instead of chewy. also i don't always add the molasses to it but they still come out great without them, the first 5 times i made this i completely overlooked that ingredient lol

These are amazing! I made them as a surprise for my husband when he comes home, but there may not be any left....

I substituted orange juice for the water as someone previously suggested.

It's a keeper!

I had a hard time with this cookie because it's hard to tell when they're done.  So , first sheet of cookies were undercooked and tasted raw, which is not anyone's fault but mine!  I made the second sheet of cookies bigger and let them bake longer.  They were much better!

Wow! Mine turned out delicious, but no beautiful crackle. Is it because I used butter? Anyway, some tips for working with this sticky dough: Freeze for 20 minutes, then, using one spoon, scoop some dough, then using another spoon, scoop out the dough and plop it down on a wax paper lined cookie sheet. Take one of the spoons and dip the back in some sugar and use this to flatten AND sugar the cookie at the same time. Quick, easy, and easy clean up with the wax paper on the cookie sheet!

Double this recipe or you will be sad. Increase the spices by at least 50%, and substitute OJ for water. Add a little extra flour after mixing to make the dough more workable.

Yummy. Be sure to refrigerate dough as it will be too sticky to handle if you don't.  Don't stack when you store them because they stick together after baking too. You won't be able o eat just one!

I made these for my roommates a couple weeks ago. They lasted all of 2 days. After the first batch came out a little cakey (but still delicious) I reduced the baking time to 7 minutes. The second batch tended to want to fall apart easily, but the texture was so perfect, I had to stop myself from eating them all. I will definitely be making these again very soon.

I don't think I've ever eaten so many cookies in one sitting! I love these. Everyone who has tried these loves them. I always replace the water with OJ and chill the dough for a few minutes as other reviewers recommended

These soft-textured cookies have a wonderful 'autumn spice' taste that only gets better the next day. 
If you've followed the recipe *to the letter*, you will have a light & airy, almost foam-like dough that is very sticky. As recommended by another reviewer, I let the dough sit for about 1/2 hour and it was much easier to work with. 
Also, contrary to what another reviewer posted, I did not have to 'really flatten the cookie'. I just gently touched each dough ball to take the arc off the top. They baked up beautifully and looked so perfect you'd think they were made in a commercial bakery! This is definitely a keeper.

As a ginger cookie fanatic, these are truly the best! I have made them over two dozen times and have learned a few things: 1. using OJ instead of water does bring out the ginger flavor more; 2. butter will work if you are out of margarine (though margarine IS better); 3. letting the dough sit for 1-2 hours makes it easier to roll into balls (I have also let it refrigerate overnight); 4. how old/fresh your bottle of ground ginger is, will impact the flavor; 5. type of molasses you use, will impact the flavor; and 6. for fellow ginger lovers, these are also good with bits of candied ginger added to the mix just before balling!!

Very good, but felt like something could've been added. I followed the directions exactly, doubled.. it made 5.5 dozen. I did sub unsalted butter for the margarine. Everyone is enjoying them, and some will end up in the freezer, as it made so many and there are only 3 of us, but I felt like something, just one little thing extra, could've been added here. Not sure what though.

I had trouble "shaping" my dough because it was too sticky. I solved this by dropping a small spoonful of the dough in my sugar, rolling it around with the spoon, then I was able to put it on the cookie sheet. I also used more than 2 Tbsp of sugar-- and I added some cinnamon to it.

These Cookies were really good. I had no prob with batter being to soft or to hard. I only added 4 things. I make candy out of citrus peels and I had some left over so I grounded it down and added that to the Ingredients. Then at the end when I was making them in to balls in the sugar I added cinnamon, ginger  and a bit of salt :0) turned out really nice.. It was my first time making Ginger cookies.. I didn't even know if I would like them>>> I DID!! (0: Thanks again I ate them so fast I didn't have a chance to take a picture... LOL

just finished baking these, and house smells wonderful. i used a teaspoon and just placed them like that on the cookie sheet. Pressed down with the back of the spoon and sprinkled with sugar and then baked them, they spread out when baking, and taste wonderful, 3" rounds are the size. Posting a picture, enjoy, hard to share these, great with a cup of tea. Peyton

I just made these, and they turned out great. I made many changes though after I read some reviews: (a) I reduced the total amount of spices (I added 1 tsp of ginger, 1 tsp cinnamon, and 1/4 tsp cloves).  (b) I refrigerated the dough for an hour prior to baking.  (c) I rolled the dough into 1 inch balls and although this yeilded 18 cookies, it didn't add to the baking time in the recipe. They were nearly entirely baked after 8 to 9 minutes and completely set after allowing them to cool on the pan for 5 minutes.  (d) I flattened the cookies to 1/2 inch in thicknes.  (e) I sprinkled sugar on the flattened unbaked cookes.

I was looking for a ginger cookie with the same taste and texture as the kind they sell in some coffee shops. For me, these were it. They were soft and chewy with a wonderful depth of flavour---neither crisp nor cake-like. I made them exactly as written, except for the substitution of orange juice for water that so many reviewers have recommended. Thanks so much for the wonderful recipe. I will be making these often.

Delicious recipe!  I too made a 3/4" ball rather than a walnut-size ball (although to my mind 3/4" was fairly representative of a walnut).  Cookies were smaller than shown with a 60+ cookie yield.  Perfect for kids lunches.  I found the dough manageable as is and did not freeze or refrigerate before rolling.  I did bake for 15 minutes instead of the 8-10 minutes recommended in the recipe.  My first batch at 10 minutes resulted in warm cookie dough and unfortunately had to be dumped.  The remaining 40+ at 15 minutes were perfection - soft & chewy on the inside and ever so slightly crispy on the outside.  They remained so after storing.

Oh my goodness. These cookies are deeee-lish. I replaced the white sugar with sugar in the raw, including for rolling, which added a nice texture and sparkle. I also used fresh ginger, like the kind that comes in a tube in the refridgerated herb section of the grocery. Make sure to let the butter soften, or creaming it with the sugar will be a tough job by hand! Thanks so much for a terrific recipe! (:

The VERY BEST COOKIES EVER! They are gorgeous when they come out of the oven and taste better than any cookie I have ever made. The only thing I did differently was use 1 t. cinnamon instead of the 3/4 it calls for and I flattened them slightly after rolling them in the sugar. This will be my go to recipe from now on.

Addictive!! These are so very good - I only gave 4 stars because I altered the recipe.  As suggested I doubled the spices (good call) and I used butter and 1/2 white sugar, 1/2 brown sugar.  My husband asked me last night "what is in these cookies" LOL - better than Lays - you CAN"T eat just one!!

I make these every year for fall/winter and I always have to make them at least twice because everyone keeps requesting them! These cookies are so flavorful and yummy, that just having one isn't an option. Make sure to carry the recipe when you bring the cookies places, everyone will want it!

If you are thinking about this recipe, you MUST make these cookies.  They are the best!  This is the first review I've written, but after making these cookies I had to tell you how good they are!  I have made them for church parties and bake sales.  They are the first to go every time.  I do put the batter in the fridge for about 30 minutes before shaping the cookies.  They are better the next day, if you can wait.

Eh - I wasn't impressed. Mine didn't crack, but that's probably because I used butter and pressed them down slightly. We'll eat them, but not close to being as tasty as my mom's recipe.

Fantastic just as written except that I used butter (always) instead of margarine.
Easy to make and 10 minutes to bake.  A keeper!

These are wonderful.  I have this recipe already except that mine calls for 1 cup of light brown sugar instead of white sugar.  I do roll them in white sugar.  These are a very favorite of ours all through the year.  It is important that you take them out of the oven right when you see them crack.  If not, they will be hard.  I  love mine chewy with a golden brown bottom.

delicious.  i made one batch with butter and one with shortening and they were both good.  used triple sec instead of water, and definitely they did not need to be flattened.  refrigerated the dough for an hour and used a cookie scoop.  they were really easy.

Great cookies!  Everyone in the family loved them.  I used butter instead of margarine b/c it's what I had.  If you do that don't press them down.  They DO spread and if you press them they don't get that nice cracked affect.  Will make every holiday season!  Thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic!  I refrigerated the dough for about 45 min before baking due to the sticky dough feedback. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and they are fantastic.

We make these cookies at least twice every winter and we just love them.  The only thing I do different is replace the water with orange juice.  Also, I've never had problems with my dough being "sticky" like some are complaining about and I never have to refrigerate before baking. I use my medium cookie scoop to drop the dough into the sugar and roll around, then plop and flatten on the cookie sheet. Always great looking, great tasting cookies.

This are by far the best gingerbread cookies I have ever eaten.  I tried them first at my friends and couldn't stop eating them, and then she gave me the recipe.  I am an awful cookie chef, but these came out fantastic!  They are consistently chewy and make many large cookies.  My family loves them, too.  A must try, especially around the holidays!

These cookies turned out great. They came out flatter than I was expecting but they have a nice spicy taste and a great chewy texture. My batter wasn't too sticky and was easy to work with right away.

These are tasty, but could use more kick.  Next time, I'll add more ginger.

These were amazing!  My first time making ginger molasses cookies and I couldn't have been happier with them.  My husband loves them.  I also substituted orange juice for the water and chilled the dough before making the balls. I also sprinkled them with red sugar for Christmas cheer.   Excellent!  Thank you!!

Super yummy!  Very soft.  I used OJ instead of water and let the dough sit in the fridge for about an hour while I made other cookies.  The dough balls were easy to form that way. Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe has become a Christmas tradition in our home. When stored in a tin, the cookies stay moist for days! No changes to suggest, perfect as is! I recommend not mixing the batter too much as it will make it too soft and harder to roll in sugar. We love it!

These cookies were very very good!  I have never made ginger cookies before this attempt and I will definitely make these again and again.  I used regular butter instead of margarine because that is what I had and normally don't bake with margarine.  I also refrigerated the dough for about an hour before forming the balls of dough.  Rolling them in sugar was the perfect touch to these cookies.  I rolled the entire balls of dough in the sugar and ended up needing more than 2 tablespoons.  I flattened the dough slightly before baking and they yielded a very thin, soft cookie!  I ended up with 30 cookies.  Thank you so much for a wonderful recipe!

this recipe was delicious, I used a previous bakers substitution of orange juice over water and it turned out fabulous!, certainly a keeper.  P.S. for future bakers, DO NOT use brer rabbit molasses, try Grandmas instead.

I made these cookies for a group of friends of mine and I have never received such rave reviews. So far I have made a double batch each time because they are in such demand!  A nice change that I made on the last batch was to grind the cloves myself with my mortar and pestle.  It gave them just a little more bite of cloves.  I am going to up the cloves to 3/4 teaspoon this for a little more spice.  Easy to make and super yummy!

I used spiced rum instead of water, and made sure to really squash them down (following OSHUN's advice) instead of leaving them as balls, and they came out beautifully!

My favorite cookies!  Both of my kids - ages 2 & 5 beg me to make these!  I find that Blackstrap Molasses give the cookies a better / darker appearance than regular molasses.

New Fav! I just made these - they are so good!!! I let the dough sit for a few minutes (partly because I forgot to preheat the oven) Sitting a little bit made the dough easier to handle. I used a flat based cup to flatten each cookie after it was rolled in the sugar mix, which made nice uniform flat cookies.

I've been baking for many years now & I followed this receipe to a T, & I can't understand why it got so many good reviews ?? First of all, the picture is deceiving because the cookies do not crack, and they're very bland ! I've definitely made better ginger snap cookies before in my life time!

A very yummy and simple cookie to make!  These are nice to mix in on holiday cookie platters, and a lot easier than gingerbread men.  I made these as miniature cookies (2-bite size) and rolled in red and green sugar.  Very cute and tasty!  I am guessing they will taste even better tomorrow.

Delicious! I made jumbo ones! The recipe yielded approx 15 cookies. I think the cookie scoop was around 1.75 oz or so? I baked them for about 20-25 minutes, and took them out while they were still nice and soft. The texture when cool was very nice, chewy, but not underdone. I highly recommend this recipe, as it converted me from a ginger-cookie hater to a ginger-cookie lover in one bite!

These cookies are ok. THey did not have much gingerbread flavor, but they did bake up very soft. Mine were not as dark as the pictures, and I followed the recipe exactly.  As a suggestion to the appearance, do not flatten them-the ones I didn't flatten looked more like the picture. If I made these again I would try rolling them in turbido sugar as the granulated sugar disappeared as they baked.

Just made these and they are great. The cookie is soft and moist with a nice flavor. I had to use water as I didn't have any OJ but next time I make these I will give that a try. BE CAREFUL NOT TO OVERBAKE!! I was tempted to leave my cookies in longer than 9 minutes but made myself pull them out and I am glad. Although the cookies may not seem done at first they quickly set while cooling. Another important tip make the balls small!! I rolled out about 1 inch balls and the cookies turned out huge. I have another batch in the oven now and these I made smaller (don't forget to press down otherwise they turn out fluffy). I also took the advice of another reviewer and dropped the dough into a bowl with the extra sugar rolled it around in there and it made rolling the balls nice and easy with little mess. Lastly I am curious if the flavor would be better with a dark brown sugar or even light brown sugar rather than white, gonna have to try that too. Thanks :)

These are just amazing!  I am not a fan of gingerbread but the ginger is very subtle.  After baking and cooling, I drizzled a vanilla glaze (from this site) over the top.  This is such a great Christmas cookie!  I plan on making them for another gathering.

This is one of my favorite cookies for the Christmas season. They are great with a glass of milk while sitting in front of the fire.

I couldn't decide between 2 ginger cookie recipes, so I made 2 (including this one).  I have to say, I was impressed by the amount of reviews with the consistency of stars, and you know what.  I'm sold.  Great recipe.  The dough was easy to work with.  The end product was consistent.  And I personally like the softer cookie.  This recipe is now upgraded to one of my "fall back" recipes.  Yummy!

What a fantastic, flavorful, soft and yummy cookie. So very delicious.  My godmother (who insisted she hates ginger cookies) took home a batch before I could even set out the plate and asked for the recipe!!  We all very much enjoyed these cookies.

These cookies are good.  Not the best I ever had, but easy to make.  I think maybe using decorating sugar on top (bigger granulates) would be better.

My new favorite cookie!  I've made this recipe 3 or 4 times now, and they come out delicious every time.  One thing I really appreciate about them is that there is no need for any high-altitude adjustments; I live in Denver, so it's been a problem before with other cookie recipes.  The dough is pretty sticky, but that's a minor issue compared to how wonderful they are when they're done.  Definitely a great go-to recipe for any occasion!

Just made these and they are awesome! I followed the entire recipe exactly except instead of water, I used a holiday apple pie liqure. I will try orange juice next time, as I do taste a hint of the apple pie flavor. Husband ate 2 on his way out after I had just put them on the cooling rack :) I took the advise of others and put the dough in the freezer for a few minutes and flattened them out (used the bottom of a cup that I sprayed w/non-stick spray). They do expand a little. Thanks!

The dough was scrumptious, but the finished cookies were less than that...darn, and they had such good reviews.  They were soft, yes, but kind of too soft and gooey.  When baked for the suggested 8 minutes they didn't get done and were really gooey.  Baked for 12 to 14 minutes they got done, still were soft, and were better, but still just not what I'd consider a delicious cookie.  Took them to a talegating get-together, and no one ate them.  Their appearance isn't really that appealing either, and then when you get by that and eat one, they're just not that great.  Sorry--I wanted to really love them.

Agree with all the reviewers, these are great cookies. Just like the ginger snaps you know and love but with a slightly chewy texture.  I made a few changes as follows:  - 1/2 cup brown sugar - 1/2 a cup white sugar - chilled the dough in the fridge for about 20 minutes - Used butter instead of margarine (never use the fake stuff!) - Substituted water for OJ as suggested - Did not roll cookies in sugar  Not sure how some of the bakers got that gorgeous cracked look, tho...any suggestions?

These tasted fantastic. However, I'd disagree with the reviewer who said that they needed to be flattened...I followed your advice and my cookies came out way too thin to hold their shape. Next time I'll leave them more or less in rounded balls on the cookie sheet. Great recipe!

These are the best ginger cookies I have ever had. I made these mostly for my husband who loves big, soft cookies, but I ended up eating almost as many as him. Per other reviewer's suggestions, I substituted brown sugar for the white sugar, and orange juice for the water. Then I topped with a little raw sugar, just so they would look pretty, but it really didn't make much of a difference at all. I got three dozen cookies out of this recipe. I will be making these again very soon.

Great cookie. To prevent sticking, I used a small ice cream scoop (the spring-loaded kind) to scoop the cookies.  They were perfectly shaped and sized without messing my hands.  I then dipped a fork in sugar and used the back to slightly flatten.  ***Purchase the small ice cream scoop if you can.  It's a great investment if you like to bake cookies a lot. I use mine constantly for chocolate chip cookies etc.

WOW I give these a big 5, if there were a 10, It would get that. I followed the recipe exactly. A clue, if your arm gets tired when your mixing in the flour mixture, you should in my opinion see the cracks in the top of cookie! Thank-you for a wonderful cookie recipe!

Great recipe for Ginger lovers!!!! I suggest using less sugar in the batter since you roll the cookie dough in sugar right before baking and add more ground ginger for a more flavor!

these are so good! i did as others suggested and used orange juice instead of water and used 1/2 brown 1/2 white sugar.  however, my cookies didn't look anything near what is pictured. the molasses i used had almost exactly this same recipe on the label and said to sprinkle 2-3 drops of water on the cookies to get the crackled look...that did not work. in fact, i tried a lot of different things and couldn't get any to crackle. but the thing i did that made the cookies look they're best was after i slightly flattened, then i only dipped the tops in the sugar. the sugar was more visible on the cookies i did that with as opposed to putting the sugar on first, then flattening. i chilled my dough for about 2hrs but by the time i was doing the second pan the dough was very sticky, i tried putting cooking spray,then sugar on my hands and nothing helped so i started putting the dough back in the fridge between pans and that seemed to help some. these are soooo addicting! i thought everyone was exaggerating but i ate 1 cookie off every pan i made! and when my DH got home he couldn't stop eating them!!! can't wait to make these again!!

Fantastic cookies! I live in Uganda and you can't buy molasses here (or I haven't found any yet) so I used golden syrup instead. I also replaced half of the white sugar with dark brown sugar and added a teaspoon of vanilla. I ended up with a very gooey mixture that I couldn't roll into balls but I simply added flour until the mixture formed more of a dough. My 3 year old daughter helped me make these cookies and she loved rolling them in the sugar.

These baked up perfectly. I followed the recipe except I used all butter because I didn't have (and never buy) margarine. I think they taste best the next day -- when they were still warm I thought the spice taste was too muted but once they were completely cooled I thought the flavor was perfect.

I give the cookies 5 stars because I can tell they're wonderful exactly the way the recipe written, BUT with a tweak or two they became the best cookie I've ever made:   When I read the recipe for some reason I thought "orange"!!  So I added a whole finely grated orange zest and 1 TBSP. concentrated orange juice instead of  the water to the wet ingredients.  I also made sure to use dark or "full flavored" molasses (not blackstrap).  I put the dough in the refrig. before rolling it into balls  (1 oz. 'cause I'm weird that way) and dredging in coarse sugar. Then baked at 350 for 12 to 14 min. (not 8 to 10). I like to get a slightly crunchy edge to the cookies, with the nice soft middle.  WONDERFUL!!  Best the day they are baked 'cause the edge gets soft the next day.  But just try to keep any of them around til the next day!! Impossible.  Try these!  Easy too.

After reading all the rave reviews I just HAD to try these cookies.  At first I was a little disappointed wondering what all the fuss was about, but after I let the cookies "mellow" for a little while I became hooked on them!  I am a self-admitted ginger snapoholic but these were part ginger snap, part crack.  Once you start eating them you just can't help yourself from eating and wanting more.  These will definitely be on my Christmas cookie trays and will be taken to gatherings when we travel this holiday.  Oh...and a GREAT cookie to dunk in milk!!

This is a very easy recipe - I have made them twice and they have been perfect.  I do not press/flatten the dough balls - I simply put the rounded spoonfull on the cookie tray and cook for 10min.  Batch makes 40+ smaller cookies.

these just came out of the oven and they are good, but not amazingly so. They seem a tad too sweet for me. I have another recipe similar to this one that adds 1/4 teaspoon CAYENNE PEPPER believe it or not and boy, what a difference! it adds a distinctive kick at the finish and takes an edge off the sweetness

Absolutely awesome. I added a little extra flour, to make the dough stiffer, and easier to handle. I made a batch, and I made the balls slightly bigger than a walnut. The result was excellent, the cookies were soft and delightful.  I used butter-flavor shortening, instead of margarine.  I plan to double the recipe, next time, to make even more. Delicious!!!

The cookies were way too sweet, despite me reducing the sugar to 140g, and were so soft they felt more like cakes. Maybe it's because of the sugar reduction, but had i not done so they would have been even sweeter, and the resulting sugar rush might have blown my head off. Also, I added half a teaspoon more ginger and still no one could taste it much over the sweetness. Not sure what went wrong, and most probably it's due to my own (lack of) skills, but not a recipe i'm going to try again soon.

Love this recipe...I make these to take into work all the time. I would recommend increasing the ginger and the molasses personally ..to the point of doubling even and I prefer dark molasses. Over all a great recipe for molasses ginger lovers.

One of my all time favorite cookie recipes is Cinnamon Cookies ll from this site.  But I thought I would try something different.  Unfortunately I did not care for these cookies.  I love cookies that are a little crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside.  These cookies came out very fluffy & cakey, and a bit dry.  I followed the recipe exactly so I'm not sure why they were dry.  The flavor was good, just not at all the consistency I like.

Followed other reviewers suggestions and substituted orange juice for water. Also used golden syrup instead of molasses, as we don't get it in New Zealand. They came out great. Next time I'll make them smaller and sandwich them with buttercream icing to make ginger kisses.

I can't say I would rave about them like other reviewers, but they were good.  After reading others comments, I chose to make a few changes: I used all butter instead of margarine, o.j. instead of water and substituted 1/3 c. of brown sugar for 1/3 of the white.  I let the dough chill for 2 hours before baking. I hate rolling cookies into balls, so instead I roll the dough into long, 1 inch wide rods and pull off inch long sections.  After placing on baking sheet, I dipped my fingertips in sugar and slightly flattened.  They look just like the pictured cookies without the tedious rolling and dipping.  They cooked in 9 minutes.  The next day they were chewy and had slightly crisp edges.

I followed the recipe for the most part, but changed a few things: I added the tbsp of orange juice instead of water and shredded some fresh ginger into the batter as well.  I never touch marjarine (the stuff's poison) and used butter instead.  My family avoids wheat, so we use spelt flour for most baking we do.  I also used real unprocessed cane sugar instead of white sugar.  These cookies had a great taste, but I feel that they needed a bit more of a flavour kick -even with the fresh ginger I added.  I'll be making these again, but adding more spices.  Also, I flattened some, and left others in balls to flatten on their own in the oven.  I found that the ones I flattened were too dry.  Let them go on their own and you're guarenteed a chewy, but fluffy cookie.

Beautiful cookies, crispy outer edges, soft inside. Baked up beautifully, following directions exactly. Dough was easy to work with-not too gooey to roll into balls right away(make sure you follow directions & STIR in the ingredients when it tells you to). All of that being said, VERY spicy from the cloves-I couldn't eat them & my kids were begging for drinks after one bite. I'll make them again but only use 1/4 tsp of the ground cloves.

These did not look anything like the photo. They were much lighter in color. This made me doubt weather I was doing it right.  They tasted wonderful and were chewy but I had added much more ginger than the recipe called for. So three stars for a good foundation.

SO I've made 4 batches already this week. THe last batch I perfected it. I don't know why but the first two batches I used butter instead of margarine and it turned out flat and too soft, almost on the mushy side. Maybe it was the butter and/or the fact that I baked them for 8mins only. The last two batches I used a half margarine half butter product that I bought from the store, and it was much better. I also followed previous advice and put the dough in the freezer for 30 mins, then hand rolled them into balls. I didn't roll them into the sugar either. For my gas oven, 9 minutes was perfect...not too cooked, and not too mushy. In my last batch I used only 3/4 cup of sugar and it was still plenty sweet. Orange juice instead of water was also great advice...brings out the flavour of the spices. Oh, with my older batches that turned out a bit mushy, I froze them, and made ginger cookie ice cream sandwhiches with vanilla icecream as recommended by someone else, and it was a super yummy idea!!!

Oh yeah, these are good. I used butter instead of margarine, but otherwise baked according to the recipe. They are fantastic. Delicious.

I accidentally put the whole stick of butter in instead of just 3/4 cup and of course the cookies came out delicious!!! Be careful not to overbake them - 8 to 9 minutes is perfect. They were so soft but a little chewy in the inside. Make sure to flatten them down enough, they don't flatten much more during baking. Definately make these cookies!!!

These are wonderful! What the perfect cookie for Christmas time! I followed the recipe to a 'T'! Make sure your butter is room temperature! They came out perfect with cracks on them...just the look I was going for! The cookie taste wonderful and is one of the softest cookies I have ever had! I'll have to pass this recipe along!

Best cookies EVER! Like others, I refrigerated the dough for about 45 minutes and added vanilla. I also used orange juice instead of water and added about 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg. Awesome!

Amazing recipe! The cookies turned out perfectly - soft and chewy with a touch of crisp on the edges! So good! I only dropped the cookie (in dough form) into the sugar - on 1 side and flattened (as per other reviews), and instead of water I used spiced rum. These cookies do not spread or change shape much in baking. I will use this recipe again!

These are wonderful cookies!  Just as the recipe states; soft ginger cookies!  I did try putting chocolate stars on one pan, and they didn't hold up very well, so I skipped the chocolate on the rest.  Still absolutely delicious!  Thanks for a great recipe.

I never use margarine, but maybe this recipe really needs it.  I used butter and they didn't puff up or crack, they just looked like round, brown circles.  The kids still liked them,  but they weren't what I had hoped for.

I will make these again but with a few changes.  They either need more flour or less margarine because they are really gooey.  Once you dip them in sugar they are easier to work will, but I ended up using more sugar than the amount recommended, which made me feel guilty while eating them.  They are really sweet so...maybe cutting some sugar from the dough and still dipping them, because that part was really nice.  They have a lot of potential, but they need a bit of tweaking.

Wow!  These were fantastic.  I didn't change a thing and they turned out perfect.  The first batch in the oven I flattened too much and made them too big.  They spread some. I did add a little extra sugar on top after I flattened.

These are some fantastic cookies!!!  Spicy and not too sweet.  The first couple times I used butter instead of margarine and found that they spread out and were a little crispy...tried the margarine as called for in the recipe and they came out perfectly!  Thanks for a great recipe its a new fall favourite!

This is an outstanding recipe, and to even make it better, by making it non-fat, just increase the flour to 3 cups, change the margarine to unsweetened applesauce, and increase the baking time to 15 to 17 minutes @ 350 F. I also changed the 1 cup white sugar to 1 cup dark brown sugar. Be sure to chill the dough in your freezer for 30 minutes before rolling the cookie dough. Finally, I Pam sprayed my hands before rolling the cookie dough as well. YUM...

I couldn't keep my hands off these and my husband wasn't any better. Usually if it doesn't have chocolate in it I'm not interested. Boy have I been put in my place with this cookie.  I mistakenly put in 1 tsp of water instead of the 1 TBLS and the dough wasn't sticky like alot of reviews stated.  Also I didn't flatten slightly before baking and they turned out just a  tad puffy which I like better then a flat cookie. Even after 3 days without the full amount of water called for they were still soft. EXCELLENT cookie.

Great cookies, made some yesterday and I'm surprised there are any left this morning. Followed the directions straight up but next time I might try OJ or one of the other suggestions. Didn't find working the dough very hard, but I'll try refrigerating it as well.

Rarely do you find a 5 star recipe on here, when I saw one, I had to try it!  The flavor was great, but I couldnt get past the flat pancake appearence.  I was apologizing for them while serving.  And I chilled/rested the dough for 6 hours prior to baking.  I wont be making them again.

Could not get mine big and soft, not sure if that's because I use butter instead of margarine? I always seem to have this problem.  Recipe was good, but no comments from my husband's co-workers. Just ok I guess!

I am not tempted to eat sweets because of a medical condition, but these smelled sooooo good and I just HAD to try a little bite...needless to say I ate the whole cookie.  I used brown sugar instead of white and maple syrup instead of molasses because finding stuff here in China is a challenge.  I also didn't roll in sugar--I just used a glass dipped in sugar to flatten the cookies and I got to kill two birds with one stone--always a plus.  These were delicious; don't hesitate to try them.

If I could give these 500 stars I would. They were the best tasting cookies I've ever eaten. Just the right combination of spice and sweetness, and with a great soft texture. I substituted 1/2 C butter and 1/4 C applesauce for the margarine, but otherwise left the recipe alone.  The dough was sticky but not impossible, and you need to flatten them on the cookie sheet. Also, they needed about 13 minutes in my oven.

Holy hot dogs these are good! Crispy edges, chewy middles... mmm.. My husband and I love the spiciness of them (I accidentally put in a full tbsp. of cinnamon, but they still taste awesome to me) and because we love ginger, I added about 1/4 cup of chopped crystallized ginger. Other than that, I left the recipe as is. Oh man, these are really, really good. Thanks for an awesome recipe!

These cookies are wonderful! There are 2 recipes in AR for 'Big Soft Ginger Cookies' - they are almost identical in ingrediants with the exception of shortening vs. butter and one has 1 Tbs. of OJ. I made 2 batches - one with shortening and one with butter - included OJ in both. Family vote was that both recipes/cookies are excellent in both taste & texture. The cookie baked with butter comes out just a bit flatter. The cookie baked with shortening is a bit plumper. Rather than use white sugar for rolling... I used 'washed raw sugar' which is the same color as the cookie batter and the sugar crystal's are larger so it has a nice texture crunch when eating. Bottom line, these 2 recipes are both equally yummy! I am going to include these cookies in next years Christmas cookie gift boxes.

The 2nd time I made them and they do come out thin but good!.. I used dark Karo syrup in place of the molasses so maybe that made them thinner.  I'd like them to be thicker though...  Thanks!

These cookies really are amazing!  I have never really been a huge fan of ginger cookies, but these are very delicious! I followed the directions, however I used a few of the fantastic tips that the other reviewers had.  I used 1 tbs. of orange juice instead of water (great tip!), I used butter instead of margarine (my preference) and rolled the cookies in sugar.  The dough *is* really soft, but it was fine once it hit the sugar it was being rolled in.  I did flatten out the cookie quite a bit and they came out perfectly.  Thanks for the recipe, it's wonderful! And thanks for the great tips everyone. :)

These cookies were very good but leaned more toward a sugar cookie flavor rather then the Ginger cookie I was looking for.  Still, this is a very good cookie but I prefer a little more spice in my ginger cookies.

These are awesome!  Nice and soft and moist with a bit for a chewy texture around the edges.  I used butter instead of margaring and eased up on the cloves but man are these cookies awesome!

These cookies were a total disaster. Even after freezing the dough and coating my hands in flour, I still made a huge mess trying to get the dough to roll into balls. I managed to get one dozen onto the cookie sheet, and after baking for the recommended time, they were like hard hockey pucks of syrup on the cookie sheet. The flavor was off too - I love ginger cookies, but there was just too much spice in these.  I will not make again.

I followed these directions and many of the review suggestions specifically.  The molasses was an overpowering, hindering ingredient that completely ruined the taste of the cookies.

probably not the best cookies! way to sweet. the sweetness overpowers all the spices. Had to stick batter in the freezer before handling, otherwise its impossible to form cookies. Don't roll cookies in the sugar in the end and cut the amount you put into the batter if you want a more flavorful cookie instead of pure sugar....might try again with only 3/4 cup sugar and 3 tsp of ginger.

Last time I did not have molasses so instead I used about 1/4 cup honey plus one tablespoon dark brown sugar and these came out so yummy! The taste reminds me of cinnamon toast crunch cereal.

These were great! I made gingerbread cookies for the first time last night. I went back and read some suggestions. I made the cookies with the same amount of ingredients, but I used orange juice instead of water. And I put the dough in the freezer for 30 minutes before I formed the cookies (put it in a metal bowl, keeps it colder) ... a TIP: scoop little balls of dough with your 1 tablespoon measuring spoon and drop it into a bowl of sugar before you roll it in your hands (a lot less sticky! ).. They might come out with a bit of extra sugar.. but they are still good.

A. maz. ing. These cookies are so good! They are indeed soft but have (mine at least) the perfect crunchiness around the edges. I also would recommend chilling the dough for about an hour before attempting to roll them into balls, and also roll them around in the sugar before shaping the ball. Anyways these cookies are really yummy and I don't think they'll last through the rest of the day.

I made these for Halloween.  Before baking I flattened the balls with a glass dipped in sugar.  They came out perfect.  After frosting with confectioner's icing, I decorated them with candy corn.  My three-year old grandson loved them.    We enjoyed the spicy flavor and also the softness of the cooky.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very good cookies! The only thing I changed was I used butter instead of margarine because butter was all I had. The cooking time was a few minutes longer than the suggested time also. Turned out great! Will definitely make again!

Made several changes to the cookies. My cookies ended up being flat, chewey centers and crispy edges, PERFECT. I didn't flatten before baking. 

Used honey instead of molasses, half brown sugar, half white sugar. Pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon and nutmeg. Half ginger and added chopped crystalized ginger.

WOW! Amazing cookie.  I found myself without ginger once while making these and changed the spices/quantities to 3 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp nutmeg, and 1/2 tsp ground cloves and they turned out fantastic for a spice cookie alternative!  I too found the dough a bit sticky but a bit of flour did the trick for easier handling.

These cookies are amazing.  My dough turned out too thin to roll so I had to add quite a bit more flour than the recipe called for to reach the desired consistency (probably due to my own error) however, they still turned out perfectly!  Puffy and soft, flavorful ginger cookies!

I loved these cookies. I found them fairly easy to bake with great resualts. Most people in my family are only Chocolate Chip cookie fans but everyone loved these. I made a few adjustments that I found to be very satisfactory. Instead of using Molasses I used Dark Corn Syrup, add a hint of vinallia, and rolled them in brown sugar instead of white. I have not tried using orange juice, but plan to try this next time.

The BEST flavor and texture. Spicy, dark and not too sweet. Made the recipe as is, but I was in a rush and made them too big (over 3 inches across), and the cookies became extremely fragile and would fall apart in half when picked up. Didn't affect the flavor at all, but do make sure they stay on the medium/small side.

These are wonderful! I did make a couple adjustments though, I used 1 Tbl freshly squeezed OJ instead of the water and 1 tsp freshly grated orange zest. I then put the dough in the fridge for 1 hr, used my small cookie scooper, lined my dark baking sheets with parchment paper, baked for 9-10 minutes at 300'. Let cooled a few minutes on the pan then transferred to a cooling rack. This batch gave me 2 1/2 dozen cookies. I think next time I'll use a little less ginger, since I felt it was too strong -for me. I had to come back to give it 5* even the next day, these are soft!

These cookies were perfect!  I used butter instead of margarine and used heaping spoonfulls of the spices rather than leveling them off.  Crispy on the outside edges and chewy on the inside.

These are excellent cookies.  I used a little less flour and 1/3 cup of molasses, and more spices.  The dough wasn't sticky so no refrigeration was required.  Parchment paper really helped.  They turned out beautiful!  Oh... I also used brown sugar rather than white sugar (although I rolled the cookies in white sugar).

I made these for Thanksgiving and they were a HIT! They came out as the most perfect cookies I've ever baked... almost looked store bought!

Some things I did to make them turn out fabulous:

1. Used orange juice instead of water like the others said.

2. Chilled the dough in the refridgerator overnight.

3. Rolled the dough balls in "Sugar in the Raw" before putting them on the cookie sheets.

4. I didn't flatten the dough balls at all and when they cooled after baking, they came out perfect!

5. I made the cookies a little bigger than the recipe says to, so I let them bake for 15 minutes in the oven.

These had the privilege of being the first thing baked in my new oven (not counting casseroles), the first good oven I've had for 13 years of being in rentals.  They turned out fabulous and 10 minutes was perfect.  I tend to like ginger and molasses both in small doses, i.e. a subtle flavor, and these were just right.  Trying to cut at least some fat, I replaced about 1/3 of the margarine with applesauce.  The texture was still good so I may try 1/2 next time.  They were pretty soft trying to roll them, but I just dipped into the dough with a spoon and dumped in into the sugar, then used a knife to kind of shove it around to get sugar all over.  At that point I could easily pick them up and get them onto the cookie sheet.  I got good at this after a few and it worked out well.  I did also trying refrigerating some of the dough, and even though they weren't too soft anymore, they were just sticky and difficult to handle at all.  So I prefer not refrigerating them.  I also seem to recall needing about double the sugar.  I guess a "serving" is 2 cookies, cause this made around 2 1/2 to 3 dozen.

very tasty! I needed to add additional flour to get a consistancy to roll. Next time I will refrigerate prior to rolling.

My roommates raved over these...I made them about three hours ago and there are only about a dozen left! My only advice is to make sure you take them out before they really start to brown, otherwise they're not nearly as soft. Aim for 8 minutes rather than 10.

this is the second time i've made these cookies- these cookies are AMAZING!
they're extremely light and soft and fluffy!
the outside of the cookie is hard enough to keep the cookie from crumbling, but once you bite into the cookie the inside crumbles into soft but not too moist pieces! 
i doubled the ginger and now it has the perfect amount of spiciness!
the BEST ginger cookie i've ever had!!

These cookies are AWESOME!!!  I've had people that do not like ginger cookies love these.  I make them & then make a pumpkin dip consisting of 1 can of pumpkin pie mix, 8oz cream cheese & 8oz of cool whip.  It's better than pumkin pie...DELICIOUS!

I'll definitely keep this recipe, great flavor and an EXCELLENT Christmas cookie! As other reviewers noted, the dough does get a little sticky. I recommend leaving out the extra water, or possibly upping the flour just a tad, but its really not that hard to work with. The size of the cookies is also an important variable. A lot of people have said that these come out under-cooked and I experienced that too when I made the dough balls too big. I made them a little smaller than walnut size and cooked 10-12 minutes. (Then again, I prefer a little more crunch with the chewy center). Overall, a very good recipe!

These cookies are soooo good! I kept looking at this recipe since the spring of 2007, and finally made them when it was the right weather. My friend, who loves baking with me, loves them also! I also added some nutmeg, more cinnamon, and added cinnamon to the sugar you roll it in. These cookies are perfect for a fall or winter day. I would love to give them 100 stars! They were really soft and came out perfect. Also, my house smelled so good after baking :) I will definately make these for my 8th grade Holiday party!

These are great!  Perfect for my children who aren't fond of strongly flavored gingerbread.  I didn't have any cloves so I used a little extra cinnamon and ginger.  I sent a tray of these over to the senior center, and they looked so nice, just like bakery cookies- the seniors ate them right up also!

My husband loved these. Replaced margarine with unsalted butter, the water with Grand Marnier, and didn't have cloves so I used allspice. They were best right out of the oven, I stored in an airtight container and I think it would have been a good idea to put a piece of bread in to catch the moisture. They got a little too soft in storage.

I've had this recipe in my box for a few months and finally got around to making it this week.  Loved it!  I did add more more ginger and cinnamon because I love the flavors and I chilled the dough for half an hour to make it easier to handle.  I used a medium cookie scoop and they came out the perfect size.  Soft and chewy and very yummy! Definitely a keeper.

This is a fantasticically easy and delicious recipe! The cookies turned out just perfect! I will definatley make again. I changed one thing: I used butter instead of margarine (I always use butter even if the recipe calls for margarine) with a little crisco. I also had a little decorators sugar (simply large granular sugar) left over and used that with the reg sugar to roll the cookies in. Fantastic!

These cookies were amazing! The recipe was very easy to follow and didn't take long. After making them I couldn't have just one! My only suggestion is to drop the molasses mixture with a spoon into the extra sugar. I tried to use my hands and it just made a mess! Please try this recipe these cookies are my new favorite!!

The name says it all: they're as soft as can be. While I usually like my cookies underbaked, these were an exception--I used a medium sized cookie scoop and baked the full 10 minutes.

These really are fabulous.  I took them to work and everyone raved.  They stayed soft too.  I had to put the dough in the fridge for a little bit before rolling into balls, but these turned out fantastic.

These had a good texture and remained soft for a week.  I didn't like the strong molasses taste, but my husband who is a ginger freak, absolutely loved these cookies.  I only gave 4 stars because they weren't "perfect" for me.

These are honestly one of the best cookies I have ever had in my entire life. I had to physically force my husband not to eat the whole batch! These are a definite keeper and will probably be my most oft-made cookie. Thanks!! (I substituted about half of the flour with whole-wheat to make them a wee bit healthier, and it worked beautifully.)

WOW! These are great cookies, I will be making them again, this has found a place in my recipe hall of fame. I did find the dough to sticky to work with so I just used my cookie scoop, flattened them on the cookie sheet and then sprinkled them with sugar.

I just took a bite out of a warm fresh ginger cookie....it was wonderful! So soft and just the right amount of spices! I made mine a little smaller because I was planning on making sandwich cookies with lemon curd (microwave lemon curd from this site) in the center, I ended up with 3 dozen. Even though they are smaller, I baked them at the same time (8 minutes) and they was delicious! Thank you thank you!

This recipe is great, but you can better it by substituting the ground ginger with fresh grated ginger. I used about 2tsps. It really makes these already marvelous cookies even better. I also found the dough sticky to handle. Just plop the ball into the sugar and form it there. Don't press the dough ball down too much, otherwise your cookies will be too flat and crunchy.

These cookies are to die for. I did put the batter in the fridge for an hour and it was much easier to roll, but i had to move quickly. Also, found out its good to let them cool on the baking pan before I try and move them to the rack. They nearly disappeared as soon as they came out of the oven. awesome, i will make them again for sure

Excellent flavor.  I don't use margarine so I made them with butter instead and they turned out great!  Great recipe!

These cookies are almost my favorite.  The actual cookie taste great, but I have such a sweet tooth that I have too many "favorites" :D.  These cookies are much better than all the other ginger snaps I've had, even the store-bought ones.  The dough had a perfect texture.  It was a tad bit sticky, as others have also noticed, so to take care of that I added about a half cup sugar more to the dough (upon mixing it up).  I also put the dough in the refrigerator for a few minutes, and this also made it a lot easier to manipulate.  I'm also a fan of cookies with crispy edges, so I left the first batch in the oven for about 5 minutes longer, so that they'd be a little crunchy.  All in all, these cookies are wonderful to eat at anytime.

Very very good, I like the way they stay soft.  It is easier to work with the dough if your hands are damp or you refrigerate for a few minutes before rolling into balls.  I ended up with 28 enormous cookies.  I think the taste is improved if you let them cool completely before eating (be patient).

These are now my favorite homemade cookie. They are fairly easy, and the flavor is divine. Like other reviewers, I suggest adding a little bit more flour for shaping (1/2 to 3/4 cup). Also, while the dough does not need to be refrigerated, chilling helps in shaping the dough

These cookies are fabulous, even with my mistakes and omissions.  You can tell how often I bake when I say I thought I had margarine and cloves, but of course, didn't.  So no cloves at all and the margarine turned into butter flavored Crisco (how I had that and not margarine I have NO idea!) and the cookies were still wonderful.  I'll definitely make these again, with the proper ingredients and I can only guess how much better they will be.  Will try it with orange juice too.

I was a baking maniac for the holidays. I made these last. Had I known how good they were I would have made them first and possibly soley. I used fresh squeezed orange juice, and "I can't believe it's not butter." I found it impossible to work with until I chilled it for about 15 minutes and the problem was completely remedied. I see many more of these in my future!

Yummy! I just made two double batches for friends ad family. I used 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 white sugar and oj instead of water.  Baked in oven 9 minutes, cooled on pan 5 minutes before placing on rack. Nice and moist. One pan was over cooked by a few minutes, perfect for dipping. Great with hot tea or coffee, I'll be adding this recipe to my keepers.

Delicious and easy!  I chilled the dough overnight in the fridge, since I was making several different types of Christmas cookies at the same time.  Soft, chewy, spicy...wonderful.  I did use butter instead of margarine, and intended to use OJ instead of water but forgot...still delicious!  A new favorite in our house.  Thanks for sharing!

I found the dough very difficult to work with, even after putting it into the freezer for 30-60 minutes -- so gooey and sticky.  However, I floured my hands, found some patience, and went to work rolling those balls and must say they cooked up extremely tasty.  Fabulous gingerbread taste and just the right amount of softness!  The cookies flatten out quite a bit during cooking (I found 10 minutes was perfect cooking time), are a bit fragile and don't look very pretty.  I frosted them with Duncan Hines cream cheese frosting (didn't feel like making my own this go-round) and they looked better and tasted out of this world.  I am going to make these a regular holiday treat!

These were delicious.  I mailed them out to all of my family and they were still moist and good when they were received a few days later.  I also made icing from the recipe on this site and topped some of them with that and they tasted great that way, too.

I made these cookies for a party, and people loved them!  I know I did!  I am not a big fan of the hard ginger snaps, but after I read all the reviews for this cookie, I knew I had to try it, and I'm really glad I did, I'm going to send this recipe to my Mom, who loves soft cookie recipes.  I had them out of the airtight container on a plate for my party and I was concerned they might get hard like cookies can, but they never did!  I'm saving this recipe, and putting it in my recipe book, definately don't want to lose this recipe!!

You may think Im jumping on the bandwagon, but Im with the majority-These cookies are fantastic.

I took one day and made cookie dough for 4 kinds of cookies one day and baked them off later in the week, so this dough was in the fridge for a few days before baking. 

The baked up wonderfully-smell divine while baking.

Whenever I make gingerbread(cake) I always serve it with a lemon curd, so when I made these cookies, I made a buttercream icing and put in some lemon zest and some lemon extract. Everyone LOVED them(both with and without the icing)

I would highly recommend these cookies-they'll definitely be on my rotation of fav cookies.

I love these cookies and so does everyone I share them with. I've passed out a few copies of this recipe to friends. I've found that the cookie is done when it begins to crackle a bit on top. Of course the sooner the softer for these cookies. The 10 minutes is just about perfect for a soft cookie but longer for a bit for a crunchy cookie to accompany milk. yummmmmm The best!

There are delicious! Just as the name indicates these are big and soft. For a festive look I incorporated red sugar in to the sugar you role the dough in.  Tip – keep your hands floured, the dough is very sticky.

Goodness, these were amazing! They were eaten all up in less than 24 hours. A huge hit with my family and friends.
I made two changes. I used nutmeg for the cloves and brown sugar in place of molasses. Absolutely delicious. Soft and sweet with that Christmasy taste. Mmmmm! Highly recommended!

Perfect! Made with butter instead of margarine and nutmeg instead of cloves, and it made no difference, they were soft, spicy and delicious. To make a true crowd-pleaser make cream cheese icing and sandwich these, people will marvel at them.

Mmmm! Turned out perfect, and there is wiggle room. We had no cloves, so we substituted it for nutmeg. We will make these more often than we should!

These are fantastic cookies the only changes I made were to refrigerate the dough for about and hour along with my cookie scoop. Instead of rolling the cookies in sugar I dipped the bottom of a glass in sugar and pressed them down so that sugar was just on the top. They are just right not too sweet to go with a cup of tea.

Awesome Cookies!!  They made my entire kitchen smell delicious.  Next time I make these I will use a milder molasses for my cookies instead of the ever bitter black strap molasses.  Other than that these cookies are perfect.  Will most definitely make them again.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Nice ginger flavour, my guests liked them but I found them rather doughy. I prefer my cookies crispier! The dough is definitely too wet to work with, refrigerating the dough seems a must-do.

Yummy!  I used butter rather than margarine and increased the ginger by a teaspoon because I like a little more "bite" to my ginger cookies.  My 2 year old loved munching on the dough and the cookies turned out great!

Made this to a T and turned out soft, chewy and stayed moist for a good 2-3 days (if they last that long!).  As previous reviews stated, fished dough mixutre is too soft and gooey to roll into balls.  Do-able, but to tedious.  Chill in fridge for 15-20 min for baking.  This recipe calls for a lot of sugar, so no need to frost.  But finished product is perfect sweet, so don't alter.  I used baking powder the first time (didn't have backing soda in the house), and still turned out, only cookie rised, instead of flattening out.  Still good this way.

these were amazing. just what you would want in a ginger cookie. Although they keep pretty good in the freezer, they are about ten thousand times better when they are fresh. I crave these things, man.

We love gingerbread so these cookies do a disappearing act at our house. One slight alteration though. Don't "slightly flatten" the cookie. If you leave it just as it is then as it bakes it will flatten out and have a nice cracked top. Just what you want in a ginger cookie.

Wow. These are incredible. Added nutmeg to the dough and iced them with the glaze from the Iced Pumpkin Cookie recipe by Gina. Dough was very sticky even after refrigerating, but totally worth it. I froze the dough of a 2nd batch and that worked much better.

These cookies deliver exactly what the title indicates. They're soft inside with crackly, sugar-coated exteriors. The dough was very soft and difficult to work with, so I chilled it for a couple of hours, and it became much easier to handle. I increased the ginger by a teaspoon (1 Tb in all) because we like a lot of "bite" to our ginger cookies. Just perfect! These will become a regular in our house. Thank you for sending this one in and giving us a new tradition. Edited to add: I have made these to rave reviews several times. Now, I spike the sugar in which I roll the dough with a few dashes of additional ginger, which elevates the flavor further.

I have made this recipe a dozen times, and will never use anything else. My son's friend begs me to adopt him every time I make them. Perfectly spiced, chewy without being mooshy! The only thing I do differently is I drop the rolled balls into a BOWL of sugar, instead of the 2T reccomended. Much easier :)  GREAT RECIPE!

Thank you for submitting this recipe. Although it is not the best ginger cookie I have made, it is good. My six year old niece did a little dance of joy with each bite of each cookie she ate, so that says a lot.
This is a keeper! :-)

These cookies are fabulous!  They are soft, spicy, and much faster to make than tradional roll & cut gingerbread cookies.  That's a real plus for impatient people like me.  They got rave reviews from my family and coworkers.  I will definately be making these again.

I made these at Xmas time and they were excellent!! I then lost the recipe and panicked until I found it again today. *lol*
I did not have cloves on hand so used pumpkin pie spice instead. Also I scoop the dough with my ice cream scoop for nice round balls, and roll them in sugar then flatten them a bit. they look so uniform, like store bought cookies! I generally fill up 2 or 3 gallon ziplog freezer bags and try to freeze them so I don't eat them all. :) They do stay amazingly soft. My mother in law loved them so much I had to print the recipe for her while I was visiting. Amy, thank you for sharing this cookie!

I am an avid cook and thought these were perfect for Fall - they are soft, chewy and simply delicious! I did not have any of the seasonings except cinnamon the first time I made these- I added a bit of nutmeg and still loved the cookies.

Like everyone says, the flavor was great with these cookies...but I also found the dough to be too soft and only half of my cookies were edible, the others wouldn't cook through and some even spread all over. I consider myself a proficient baker so this was a dissapointment. If I gave them another shot, I would only use only 1/2 cup margarine, or add more flour.

This is the first time that I have tried ginger cookies and this recipe was great and so easy. My kids were sneaking them off the counter when I wasn't looking. I added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg to the recipe and baked the cookies for 10-11 min and they turned out wonderful. Thank you for the recipe.

I didn‘t like this recipe - it didn‘t last even a day after it was cooked. It didn‘t even last long enough to get cooked.  I take a lot of liberties when I cook and I started with the liberty of freezing the dough until I had time to bake them.  When I took them out of the freezer I left them in the fridge for another week - just hadn‘t had time to bake and 1/3 of the batch disappeared before they even got to the cookie sheet.  I thought they might not be very good anymore after all the freezer and fridge incarceration but I baked them anyway and at least half were gone before they had finished cooling.  I haven‘t had a batch of cookies go so fast.  We don‘t even know yet if it‘s true that they stay soft.  I will be making them many times just to try to get to the stage of finding out if they stay soft.  I hate recipes that make me work so long and hard - but I L-O-O-O-VE the cookies!

Excellent cookie!  On our way through Amish Adams County in Southeast Ohio, we stop at a roadside stand and buy molasses cookies.  These are EXACTLY like those I love so very much.   I have passed this one along to many.  Will be a recipe passed down the generations as well.  Great!

I have never made Ginger cookies before and these were great, got lots of compliments!  For me the dough is sticky when mixed up.  Works better for me to refrigerate a few hours before baking.

Used butter. Half white sugar half brown sugar. Used 1 inch cookie scoop and cut them in half then used the bottom of a glass to flatten them. Before flatten with glass dipped the bottom of glass in sugar. Soft and chewy :)

First time making ginger cookies and they turned out excellent.  The only change I made was use unsalted butter instead of margarine, and then I added an extra dash of salt.  I read another review that said to flatten the cookies REALLY good.  I did that and they were just too flat.  The second time around I followed the recipe directions and SLIGHTY flattened the cookie, and turned out nicely.  I never thought I’d like ginger cookies.  I am used to the hard cookies you get from the grocery store...no good.  These are 100 times better...hands down.

These cookies turned out great!  The only thing I did different than the recipe was to use butter instead of margarine.  The cookies had the right amount of sweetness and spice. I did refrigerate the dough for about a half hour before baking and I do think it makes it easier to handle and the cookies hold their shape better.

Wow! These are fantastic! I used softened butter instead of margarine and I changed the water to RUM! Delicious. I doubled the recipe and it came out beautifully. I did have to pop the dough into the fridge for a few minutes before I made the cookies just to get a nice texture to scoop! Fantastic recipe! Thank you!

Great recipe for soft ginger cookies (I dislike ginger 'snaps').  
I found that if you refrigerate the dough really well then roll it into a 1" log and cut off 1" pieces to bake on a parchment lined baking sheet, it resolves most of the 'mess' factor associated with these type of recipes (those with molasses as an ingredient).

I modified the recipe using unsalted butter instead of margarine.  Chilled the dough for 45 minutes and formed the balls using moistened hands.  Cookies came out nice and soft.  Loved the ginger and clove flavored not too overpowering.  The next time I make these, I plan to increase the cinnamon a bit.  These will be great with a cup of hot tea, coffee or cold milk.  Very pleased with how the coolies turned out.

Made for the first time tonight and they were fantastic!!  I started by pressing the cookies on the sheet as the recipe called, then one sheet I forgot to do that and I liked those better.  Will prob take 1-2 min longer to cook those though.   Will definitely make again!!

First time making these cookies and they are going to be our all-time favorite ginger cookies!!  I followed the recipe exactly (except used butter instead of margarine) and they came out perfect.  I didn't refrigerate them and yes, they spread out just a little bit but nothing to be negative about.  I used a cookie scoop so all the cookies were the same size and didn't get my fingers all sticky!  They have been out of the oven for about 15 minutes and they are already 1/2 gone!  Thank you for such a great recipe!

Very good basic cookie.  The last time I made them I baked 1/2 the batch a bit longer as my husband like a crispy cookie and they turned out very well that way too.  I also like to roll them in sugar before baking and sprinkle with drops of water.  Sounds funny but it gives them a very pretty look and adds a hint of crunch to the outside while still soft inside.  Yummy. :)

I tried this recipe . Going by some of the other reviews I did a couple of things of my own. I used "I can't Believe its not butter all-purpose baking sticks" instead of margarine , I never use margarine . Then I added just a little extra flour about 3 handfuls which probably equaled out to about 3/4-1 cup extra and my cookies turned out great..real  good and picture perfect had no problems at all.

The  most delicious ginger cookies. Molasses and cloves do their  thing for the extra  flavor. Better double  the recipe ~ gone in a jiffy! Easy recipe  and a real hit with friends. I fill tins as gifts.

The only changes I made were subbing OJ for water and chilling the dough overnight, then thawing for maybe 30 minutes before trying to roll it into balls. They came out super thin and cakey and all melted together. Had to throw them away :( They tasted fine, though.

These cookies were delicious and easy to make. I have made this recipe two times. The first time, they came out very flat. The second time I made them, I omitted the water and added an additional tablespoon of flour. They came out perfect. My kids love them too. I love the combination of spices. I will definitely be baking these often.

These cookies barely make it out of the oven before my boyfriend devours over half of them! I've made them several times and always had fantastic results! I find my dough not sticky and difficult, and I don't flatten the dough in the pan. I've also very successfully made double and even triple batches. I do invest a lot of time and muscle power into really fluffing the butter and sugar though.

I tried this recipe however I used 1/4  cup of cinnamon apple sauce instead of the egg. I had to add a bit more flour because the dough was too sticky at first. Once I got the consistency right....They came out great, dangerous great! Like I think I may not be making them again until I have other people to share them with! Hahaha Enjoy!

I made this cookie for my friends and they loved it. At first it was too sticky to shape but the taste is delicious. I avoid covering the dough with sugar because I didin't want it to have sugar on top but still it tastes very good. I am going to double the ingredients because I got 16 cookies eventhough I shaped them just like walnuts...

I just made these for my mother in law and they are wonderful. I took the advice of others and used fresh squeezed orange juice in place of the water. I also increased the ginger to a full tablespoon (she loves ginger) and used 1/3c sugar and 1/3c stevia to cut back a bit (she's pre-diabetic) and they are still plenty sweet. I had no problem rolling them into balls and I did roll them in sugar & flatten them a bit. 10 minutes was perfect. Very good cookie!

Okay, for all those folks who somehow messed up this recipe...try it again! The only changes I made was butter instead of margarine, and the orange juice for water. But honestly, I followed everything else to a tee, and I never bake. These cookies were perfect. By the way, do freeze/refrigerate the dough for an hour. I made two batches. Tip: If you want the craggy, textured surface, do not flatten the cookies as shown in the video. I did that the first time; cookies were delicious but smooth/flat. Leave them walnut-shaped. I also noticed that I because I made them so large, they needed a couple of extra minutes.

My new favorite cookie recipe!!!!! I could not keep my hands off of them. Made them for Christmas instead of gingerbread men and I'm glad I did. I added 1/2 cup of light brown sugar to the dough and they came out perfect! Will make again and again. Thanks for the recipe

I love that these aren't hard like ginger snaps.  Yes, there is a lot of butter but you just can't go wrong with these when following the recipe exactly.  Definitely a crowd pleaser.

These are absolutely delectable! The only change I made was to use brown sugar in place of white. I like the rich flavor of brown sugar. I also added a dash of cayenne pepper and some gourmet chocolate pieces. These are probably the best cookies I've ever made.

Very good. I didn't flatten them ( you wont get that crackle effect if you do). Also, I have made these with this exact recipe, but once, I didn't have molasses and used dark corn syrup as a substitute. They didn't have that same "bite" in the flavor as when using molasses, but it made a very close tasting cookie with a lighter color.

This recipe is AMAZING. I've made it a dozen times it's my no fail, go-to cookie recipe. I like to add a few tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa powder and I use butter instead of margarine. So good and easy!

I saw they needed flattening after my first tray. FYI flatten slightly after placing in cookie sheet. Other than that I had no trouble making them and no messy gooey batter it was ready to roll just after mixing so my thoughts as to why others may have had a gooey mess is that perhaps their butter was warmer than room temperature. Great recipe I will make them again! Thank you!

Fantastic as everyone has said.  I made these adjustments for HIGH ALTITUDE (we live at 7,000ft):
added 3 TBSP of flour and lowered the oven temp to 325.  They came out soft and delicious!

I really really loved this recipe. I found 8 minutes was perfect for soft cookies. 12 is better for more crispy cookies. I also used 1 teaspoon of ground ginger and 1 teaspoon of fresh minced ginger and it gave the cookies a stronger ginger flavor. I used the flat side of a meat mallet to flatten out the cookies. Thanks AMY1028!

I didn't even read the ratings before making this recipe, but I knew before I started that I wanted them to taste like my favorite 'orange spice crackles'. Instead of the water I used 1 1/2 teaspoons of orange extract- next time I will increase that to 2 1/2 teaspoons. I love the orange flavor with the spices and I doubt the orange juice suggested by others would even make a difference. I used shortening (1/2 cup) plus goat milk butter (1/4 cup) due to a milk allergy and these came out perfectly. I didn't have any issues with needing to freeze or refrigerate the dough prior to rolling. I used turbinado sugar to roll the cookies in before placing on the cookie sheet. My husband said that the turbinado made these cookies. It gave them a crunch compared to the chewy texture of the cookie and a nice extra sweetness. These are much easier to make than the orange spice crackles I make at Christmas-and will become a regular at our house. Thanks Amy!

I made these cookies for a friend who said they hadn't had "soft ginger cookies" since they were a kid. I had never heard of them so of course I looked them up on all recipes.com.  I made the cookies the first time exactly according to the recipe except using OJ in lieu of water. Everyone loved them. I then tried a few tweaks as wanted them just a bit chewier.  I had stumbled across a gourmet sugar called   Dark Muscavado Cane sugar( India Tree Gourmet spices , Seattle, WA from the island of Mauritus) . So I followed the above recipe except substituted the Dark Muscavado sugar for regular sugar, added a pinch of cardamom in addition to the spices listed, and added a teaspoon of apricot preserves hoping it would deliver the additional "chewiness" and avoid cracking.    I did have to put the finished mixture in the freezer for a 1/2 hour in clear saran wrap to firm it up.  Next time I will probably put the dough in the refrigerator overnight.  I never used muscaovado cane sugar before and since it has a bit of molasses content in the cane sugar itself I think it enhanced the already delicious flavor of this great soft cookie ginger recipe. So glad this recipe was shared I will come back to it again and again.

These cookies are awesome. I really like ginger, so I increased the ground ginger to 3 tsp (1 tbsp) and added a 1/4 cup of finely minced, candied ginger. Fortunately for me, my wife doesn't really like ginger, so I get the whole batch to myself!

I followed the instructions exactly -- from stirring in the dry stuff by hand (it says mixing earlier ... so I suspected the recipe is serious when it says stir) to flattening them slightly. Yet they turned out flat without a cracked appearance. Not pretty ... and we eat with our eyes first. They taste gingery as I expected.

Easy peasy although my hand got tired of stirring. Sounds like I need to try putting these in the freezer although I had no trouble rolling them. Or flattening them more.

I've been making these since I found the recipe in 2006ish-they are my favorite. No need to refrigerate dough before you bake- first, don't over incorporate the dry ingredients, just stir in with spatula until just incorporated. Then, use two spoons and scrape off the dough into the sugar and gently roll once, or until covered. Then on the sheet just flatten slightly. Yes the dough is soft, but won't be sticky if you just stir by hand. My cookies come out uniform and gorgeous every time! The taste is better the day after, but I honestly can barely get them to last 24 hours in the house!!

Loved this recipe & they are wonderfully soft (so long as you don't over bake them). I did a slight bit of alteration: don't care much for white sugar so I used brown & skipped the sugar coating on the outside. Tip to keep the dough from getting all over your hands, use 2 large spoons & pass back and forth a 1/2 of spoonful, then when you drop them, roll the spoon around on the top & it flattens & shapes them.

These cookies are wonderful!  In my experience, it's better to slightly overcook these cookies than to slightly undercook them.  (My only change was that I always omit the cloves because of my taste preference.)

It was a great recipe and I was scared at first how the cookies would turn out because while I was shaping them, they were very gooey and tasted heavily of molasses. After I coated them in sugar it stabilized the strong flavor and they baked to turn out amazing. definitely encourage people to make these amazing cookies.

Tasted amazing! I made what I thought was small scoops and the cookies all formed into one large cookie! they were very greasy cookies but worth it for the softness. I will make them again definitely but make them smaller and spread out more on the sheet aaaaand I might reduce the oil next time as well.

I tried this recipe before giving up gluten and loved it. Here is what I did for a gluten free version and I think it tastes as good as the original:
2.5 cups of gf ap flour (I used Analise Roberts mix of brown rice flour, potato starch and tapioca flour)
1/4 teaspoon xanthan gum
And refrigerated the dough over night. I also used earth balance in place of margarine. Also, There was also no need to flatten them before baking. Delish

Love this recipe.  Doubled the amount of each spice and they only got better!  First time out made "walnut sized balls"  - second, third and fourth times out made the cookies about half that size - 9 minutes in the oven and voila- the most perfect cookie.  Let cool on the cookie sheet to achieve an nice crunchy outside and a soft gooey inside.  One other tip that others have mentioned, definitely chill the dough - they roll much easier - thirty minutes or more seems to do the trick. 

Yum!

I followed the recipe to the "T" the first time and they were great. Second time I used OJ instead of water but over baked them a little. Third time I made them and did the following changes: used OJ instead of water, butter instead of margarine, and used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. Third time was the ultimate winner. These were so delicious and I'm not even a big fan of ginger! I took it to work and someone told me the cookies made her day. I would definitely makes these again and again! I also put the dough in the fridge for about 30 minutes prior to shaping them. The negative reviews are interesting. I'm not an expert cook but this recipe contains a lot of wet ingredients (e.g. water and molasses) so expect the dough to be a little more runny than usual. Don't expect it to look thick and crackled like the picture (the person obviously modified the recipe). If you want it to look exactly like the picture then you'll have to tweak the recipe. I think the main culprit of the runny-ness and greasiness is margarine. Margarine is softer and contains more oil than butter.

These were okay - not the ginger flavor I was hoping for

I've been making these cookies for over 13 years and they are delicious!  The literally melt in your mouth and I have friends and family requesting them year after year!  One tip for those having issues with the texture of the batter when it's time to roll the dough into balls: If you literally stir in the ingredients with a wooden spoon, your dough will come out firm and you'll have no problem rolling the dough into balls.  If you're using a handheld mixer, the dough becomes so firm you'll have to switch from your mixer to a wooden spoon halfway through. (Trust me: I've burned up two motors with this recipe.  It was totally worth it too!)  I used to do this recipe entirely by hand or with the aid of a handheld mixer, but I got tendonitis and can no longer stir in the dry ingredients.  Now I have to use a high grade mixer to complete this recipe.  With professional style mixers becoming the norm in household kitchens these days, you'll find that most people are using a low setting on their Kitchenaid or Cuisinart instead of literally stirring in the ingredients the old fashioned way.  This creates a tackier, looser dough that requires 30-60 min in the fridge to bring it back to a firmer consistency.  If you want to save yourself some refrigeration time (which I no longer have the option of doing), take the bowl out from under the mixer, grab your wooden spoon and stir when the recipe says to stir.  Happy Baking!

Key to this recipe is FRESH spices. If your ginger is a year old, toss it & buy a new jar. I subbed 1/2 brown & 1/2 white sugar, 1/2 whole wheat & 1/2 white flour, and orange juice for the water (no discernible orange flavor in my opinion), and refrigerated the dough. I made them relatively small and got 4 dozen delicious cookies. These will be a staple in my house!

We just baked these dangerously delicious cookies and OMG there're so good.  We added vanilla ice cream in between two cookies and we couldn't get enough. I do hope we can save some for tomorrow.

I made this recipe for my christmas baking and they were one of my favorites!  The only alteration I made was using butter instead of margarine (I don't use margarine).  You do need to squash them down a bit after rolling them into balls like it says in the recipe to get the best cookie shape.  I missed this step on my first pan and had to squish them half way through.

Maybe creamed the dough too much?  It took too long to bake and felt undercooked for a long time.  Needs around 14 mins baking time.

I don't usually rate recipes, but I had to for this one. I'm an experienced baker, but after this flopped I've read and re-read the recipe to try to find my mistake, but I followed this to a tee and it was BAD!  My cookies were flat, greasy, crunchy-edged and strangely flavored.

Just made two batches of these cookies.  One using water and the other using orange juice.  What a great suggestion ANIA520!!!! Thank you!!!  I will make these wonderful cookies using the oj from now on.  They are just as the title suggests, big, soft, ginger cookies.  I would however add WONDERFUL to that description.  I just used a small melon ball scoop and dropped on parchment paper lined cookie sheets.  Will make two more batches of these cookies for our next pot luck!!!!

Tips:
1) use full flavor (or dark molasses)...you can get away with using a T. less, so your dough won't get as sticky
2) cut the water (or OJ) in half, also reducing the sticky
3) MINIMALLY!!! soften your butter or margarine (marg. probably doesn't require softening at all!), again to reduce the sticky
4) if you can, mix the flour mixture in by hand/with wooden spoon...won't "heat" the dough as much and will reduce the stickiness :)
5)I like to roll mine in raw sugar; deeper flavor and prettier to look at!

This recipe was DELICIOUS! I added a bit more cinnamon but otherwise made the recipe to a T and it worked out wonderfully! The first batch I did over baked a bit.. the other batches I put in for 9 minutes. the center didn't look done but when they cool, that is the best part of the cookie! The batch I over baked weren't the best. Don't bake them too long!!

Took the advice of other users and used orange juice instead of water. I used fresh squeezed to be fancy. Flattened the cookies with a fork before baking which made them quite pretty. I made HUGE cookies so I had to bake them for about 12 minutes. Roommates ate them all within 24 hours.

WOW! Great cookies. I have made them twice now. First time with 50/50 brown and white sugar, using the water as stated, and all butter. They were great and disappeared in no time. The second time I did the same thing except I used orange juice instead of the water...even better. Both times I doubled the recipe and got about 4 1/2 dozen large, soft and chewy cookies. Thanks for sharing this recipe, it's a keeper!

made this recipe with whole wheat white flour (from TJs) and butter instead. substituted the water with OJ as one reviewer recommended. refrigerated dough for an hour before rolling. results were perfect. dough can be frozen for weeks and they turn out just as good.

Absolutely scrumptious! The only suggestions I took is to replace the water with orange juice (not sure if it really makes that much of a difference but if you have in on hand you may as well use it instead) and to refrigerate the dough before rolling in sugar and baking (it makes it less sticky). Otherwise, don't change a thing! Everyone I've made these for has devoured them! Thank you for sharing, this is definitely my most used cookie recipe!

One of my favories now even though I'm not a gingerbread fan.  I tried the recipe on a whim and am hooked! The best thing is that if you take them somewhere, they don't attract a lot of attention and you  get to take them back home for yourself!

Made these twice, exactly as directed. The cookies are so good tasting but the dough came out fairly sticky and hard to work with. Also they looked nothing like the photo. The second time I made them I skipped the 'flatten slightly' step and the were a little better looking, less flat but still no crackled tops. I also refrigerated the dough to chill well and that helped just a little with the stickiness. Next time I make them I will leave out the tablespoon of water as another reviewer suggested. Love the taste though and they do stay soft.

Just made these. They didn't turn out like the photo... all crackly looking, which is what I was hoping for.  I used butter instead of margarine because I don't buy margarine.  I wonder if using shortening would have been better.  They have a nice taste. Spread more than I thought they would, but I didn't let the dough sit, or freeze it. Hmmm.. Will try different things.  Nice cookie overall, just not what I thought I'd get.

I really loved the taste of these cookies. I was, however, a little disappointed with how they looked. As others mentioned, mine turned out a bit flat; they didn't have that nice, cracked top like the cookies in the picture that I was hoping for. Because they spread, they weren't quite "big" and "soft", but it still made a yummy, crunchy cookie. If you have a lot of concern for the way your food looks, be forewarned that it may not turn out like the picture suggests. Otherwise, I found the flavour great!

Excellent cookies! My hubby didn't think he liked ginger cookies until he tried these...definitely a keeper recipe!

I did use OJ as others suggested, and butter instead of margarine. To make sure the cookies didn't turn out flat, I chilled the batter & put the cookie sheet in the freezer while I mixed together the ingredients. Don't follow the video...make sure to follow the recipe: BEAT the egg & molasses into the butter/sugar (using a mixer), then gradually STIR (using a spoon) the dry ingredients into the wet (until just incorporated). 

My cookies turned out perfectly cooked, while still being soft & chewy. Wonderful!

didn't have any issues with this recipe like other people had with it being gooey. i didn't even have to let it sit before i could roll the dough. i did add a bit of extra ginger and cinnamon, and used a little less sugar (just under 1 cup) and butter (5/8 of a cup). they turned out perfect. chewy, not greasy at all.

Awesome base recipe for ginger cookies.  I did make modifications however, so I have to give the recipe as is a 4/5.

I subbed out margarine for butter, use half cup white sugar and half cup brown sugar, used 1 TBSP of ground ginger AND about 1 tsp freshly grated ginger, all spice instead of cloves, and I added in a pinch of nutmeg and pumpkin spice for variety.  I did this after my significant other complained that there wasn't enough "punch" in my first batch.  I also use orange juice instead of water, and only about 1/2 TBSP.

I bake on a cooking stone for about 15-20 mins @ 350 - mind you, I tend to make my cookies a bit larger than recommended.  Sprinkle a bit of extra sugar on top after they are out of the oven for visual effect.

Fabulous recipe- I am writing this review as the cookie sits warm on my plate waiting for me to devour it. Easy easy recipe. Loved that I had all the ingredients on hand. Mind you, i bake with butter so i used it instead of margarine. They are full of flavor, not too sweet, and are they ever soft. Mmmm. Tip for measuring your molasses... Spray your 1/4 measuring cup with some non stick spray before pouring your molasses in and it all slides out... Clean!
Can't wait to share these cookies!

YUMMMM! I am not a ginger person, BUT I really like this soft chewy cookie. I can't keep my husband out of them. Don't let the ginger keep you from trying them if you are like me.

These cookies are wonderful! I did use butter instead of margarine. The only mistake I made was only making a single batch the first time I made them because they disappeared! Now I always make a double batch.

The flavour of these cookies was good.  My cookies were much lighter in colour than the recipe photo.  I found that the batch of cookies I made on a cookie sheet with parchment paper were kind of flat and didn't crack.  I also made a batch on a baking stone and the cookies puffed up nicely and had the cracks that traditional ginger cookies have.

Excellent, BUT... It needs more Ginger, I'd say 2.5 tsp. instead of just 2; and 1 1/4 c. sugar instead of 1 c. The flavor and texture are like bakery cookies. Great! Will make again!

Some tips: you can put the dough in the fridge or freezer for 20 minutes to 1 hour to make the ball rolling easier. It will not change the outcome of the cookie. I rolled mine in sugar completely and found that I didn't need need to flatten the cookies. They do that on their own in the oven. I also used butter instead of margarine.

My other gingerbread recipe is in the trash now! These are soooo good!! I mixed the dry ingredients and in a seperate bowl the wet, then mixed together, then chilled for an hour. I didn't have any problem with the dough being too sticky- it was perfect. I made a glaze w orange juice, powdered sugar, cinnamon and a bit of milk and just drizzled a tiny on each. I will definately make these over and over! I did use orange juice instead of water. I just squeezed an orange since you only need 1 T.

These are really tasty and the dough is fantastic. I used sugar in the raw to roll them in before instead of regular sugar. Very tasty!

These are soft and delicious.  I halved the recipe with good results.  My cookies needed to cook for 13 minutes and were still slightly underdone, but I think this lent itself to the soft/chewy factor.  My cookies did not look crackled like the default picture.  They were a little pasty looking and thin, but these had a good flavor.  Next time I think I will add more molasses.  I will make again.

I made these cookies twice - once exactly as the recipe is written, and I found the cookies to be very bland and lacking in spiciness. So the next time I used fresh ginger instead of dry (about a 1inch piece) and doubled the cinnamon. Still not spicy enough for me, but my boyfriend loves them. I guess next time I'll try a bigger piece of fresh ginger and triple the cinnamon and double the cloves...

I scaled to 16 servings to use 1/2 c butter (1 stick) added 1 tsp vanilla, used 1 tbsp scoop got 31 cookies baked in 8 minutes.
I made these cookies again, this time I used brown sugar for the white and honey for the molasses because I really can't stand the smell. I also added 1 tsp vanilla. I used my #50 scoop which yielded 36 cookies, I used 11 tbsps of sugar to roll them in, I baked the balls 4 minutes then flattened them with a glass then baked another 5 minutes, they were perfect, crisp edges and chewy centers.

Awesome cookies.  I made a batch tonight and between two teenage boys that think cookies aren't worth eating unless they are chocolate chip cookies, these are all gone.  The changes I made were adding a bit of fresh grated ginger, oj instead of water, and I used butter because I didn't have margarine.  I refrigerated the dough for about 15 minutes.  That's all it took to chill it enough to easily handle it.  Yep, this recipe is a total keeper.  Thank you, Amy!!

One of my favorite cookies of all time. EASY and inexpensive to make. I never use margarine, only butter, increase the spices a bit and add a half teaspoon of cream of tarter to ensure a crinkly top. I refrigerate them just a very short time and NEVER flatten them- they bake up perfectly straight from the balls. I also make them smaller (.07oz makes 40), so they can be put out with other seasonal treats. They can be served with a pumpkin dip for a pretty presentation. These are always LOVED by EVERYONE who tastes them. Try them. You won't be sorry!

Lovely biscuits, quick & easy to make. I took the advice of some other reviews and halved the quantity of cloves, used OJ in place of water and also added a small amount of vanilla. Iced with royal icing for special occasion treats.... just perfect !!

Wow, doubled the recipe. Didn't have margarine so I hesistantly used butter flavored Crisco. Used full flavor molasses and didn't have dry ground ginger so I grated amount (used about 3/4 of the amount called for since I had doubled recipe and that was all I had). Also, since another viewer had suggested orange juice I added half the amount of water and the used orange juice concentrate for the other half. Used a large melon baller to scoop them out and drop directly in a bowl of sugar. Not messy at all once I rolled it. Really flattened them out so they looked like what I had thought they should coming out of the oven. They are perfect. Absolutely beautiful, fragrant, chewy, and not a lot of mess. This one is going in the recipe box!

I thought these were awesome!  My boys and I made them together and had a lot of fun.  

I did take some of the other member suggestions and exchange the water out for orange juice.  I didn't change anything else in the recipe.  

As some of the other members mentioned, I too found the dough very sticky to work with.  We wore disposable latex gloves which worked out better.  While the 1st batch was cooking, I put the leftover dough in the fridge.  When I got ready to bake the 2nd batch (30 min later or so) the dough wasn't as sticky.  I will be making these again, however, I will refrigerate the dough for a bit before baking.  

Some members have stated the spices were strong or not strong enough.  I personally, thought the measurements were right on target for my liking.  My oldest son also liked them.  My husband is not a huge a clove fan and he did feel they were overpowering.  I would say if you aren't a huge fan of cloves - you may want to cut it down some.  Maybe add 1/2 of the spices, taste the batter and then adjust accordingly.  

Enjoy!  These are super yummy!

I love this recipe! I am going to make gingerbread men tomorrow, and I'm wondering if there's a good way to customize this recipe for that end. Any advice? I'm not a particularly confident baker, and I'm worried about messing it up.

A very good cookie that my whole family really enjoyed. A little too much spice for me though. The next time I make them I'll be cutting back a little on the cloves and the ginger.

Yup, everyone else was right: these cookies are fantastic!  I only bake a couple times a year, and found these cookies very easy to make.  I followed the recipe exactly (doubled it, since if I'm baking anyway, why wouldn't I make it worth my while?), except substituted orange juice for the water as some others suggested, and used "rounded" teaspoons for the ginger measurements to ensure the flavour was adequate.  I did not have any issues at all with the batter being too sticky, and that is without refrigeration.  I'm thinking either the others may have have added the sifted ingredients too quickly, or maybe using Becel spreadable margarine instead of softened, stick margerine made the difference (though I doubt it).  Either way, they turned out great!  Very chewy and delicious.  

Only thing I will change (try) next time is to use dark brown sugar of some sort, and the darkest molasses I can find.  This has less to do with the taste than my preference for a darker coloured ginger cookie.  Update: I made them again, and substituted Demerara sugar for white sugar, and used blackstrap molasses instead of regular.  Darker colour and more molasses flavour - in my opinion, an improvement all 'round.

This is now my daughters and friends favourite cookie. I have to make at least 2 batches each time to make sure both get their fill and there are some left for others. This is one recipe I can not afford to loose!

Super yum!  Addicted.  I would chill the dough before rolling in sugar.  They are still great if you don't but they turned out a little thin.  Next time I plan on using a higher quality molasses and see if it changes the flavor.

Theses are excellent tasting. I am not experienced in the kitchen so these were a little more difficult despite the very simple recipie. They dough is VERY sticky and gooey (even after placing the dough in the freezer). It is impossible to get them rolled into the sugar because you cant even make them into a ball. They still tasted excellent even though they were very ugly!!

These cookies were a huge hit.  They stayed soft and were absolutely delicious.  I might try putting a glaze on top next time, but that is just something I think sounds good.  Really, following the recipe makes a very excellent cookie and there is no need to change anything.

These ginger cookies quickly became my favorite ginger cookies this past fall. Soft, chewy...everything that everyone wants in a ginger cookie! A few things I did to spin the recipe: I used orange juice instead of water, and used orange zest as well (Obviously, you'd have to like the orange accent to do this, but I absolutely love it). I left the cloves out, added nutmeg, doubled the ginger, and used butter instead of margarine. Rolling the cookies in sugar is a must ;)

TIP: Make sure to chill the dough. It makes the cookies easier to roll into balls and keeps the cookie from turning into a flat disk.

TIP: Add a simple puree of CANDIED ginger. It REALLY makes these cookies pop. Just don't add the ground ginger to keep from going into ginger overload. Unless you like tons of ginger flavor... then go for it!

This cookie is the biggest hit in the parties this year! It's soft and chewy! Better than a lot of Gingerbread cookies bought in stores! The only thing to watch for is the quality of ginger powder. And I always use extra ginger powder and cloves for spicier taste. Even a 1 year baby boy loved it!

Lovely cookie. I was hoping for more of a molasses type cookie like you can get in the Maritimes but I will try to make these again using brown sugar instead of white. I added finely chopped candied ginger to the tops just after they came out of the oven. Not too sweet and they stay soft.

Absolutely delicious! Perfect combination of sweet and spicy!! I doubled the spices for an extra kick of flavor and the result is a super soft ginger spice cookie! Definitely refrigerate the dough before rolling into balls or you'll have a nice sticky mess on your hands! They won't stick around long!! So yummy!

If you are like me and like the idea of gingerbread men but aren't exactly excited about eating them or the mess of rolling out dough for the cookie cutters, then give this recipe a chance! So easy to make and roll out and cut. The first baking recipe where my four year old was able to help more then watch. And here we are, a week later, and they are still moist and delicious! I used 3 egg whites instead of whatever the recipe called for the icing. Turned out great! Instant tradition that I look forward to doing for years to come.

Yummy!  Kids and husband loved these!  I baked the first tray just like the recipe said, but the second tray I used raw sugar instead of refined and we liked those even better!

I made these for my cookie trays for friends at Christmas but thought they were just "okay".  For some reason mine did not come out "soft" but more like a ginger snap.  Maybe from making them too small (I rolled about 3/4-1 inch balls).  They werent as spicy as I thought they would be.  I prefer a more "molasses" tasting cookie.

These were absolutely delicious! I used the orange juice instead of water, and I didn't have cloves, I also added ground cardamom, nutmeg, some skor pieces, and some walnut pieces. The result was amazing!

YUM! I made these for the first time last night, and they're delicious. However, mine are not dark in color like a lot of the photos others have posted, and I followed the recipe to the letter. They look like chocolate chip cookies without the chocolate chips, kinda. To those who didn't get the cracked top... I made 4 dozen cookies, and the first two dozen I flattened slightly with the bottom of a drinking glass - those did not crack. The last two dozen I pressed down very slightly with my fingers, and they all cracked. I wish mine looked like the photos, but they taste amazing and are staying in my recipe box!!

GREAT!!!!!! Came out exceptional!!!!
Added a tad bit more flour (Less than a 1/4 cup extra). Sprayed hands with cooking spray to keep dough from sticking to my hands. The rest I followed to the "T" and the cookies turned out perfect!!!

These cookies are AWESOME!! I love gingerbread but I am not a big fan of hard cookies. These are moist and delicious. I followed a lot of the reviewers' advice and used OJ as the liquid.

These turned out good for me. I used butter instead of margarine. They were hard to shape into balls because the dough was so sticky, so maybe putting the dough to chill first like others said to do would help. I would have, but lacked the time.

I used the suggestion of others by using 1/2 regular and 1/2 powdered sugar.  Wish I had coated the cookies in powdered sugar as well.  White sugar too crunchy, and it needs a little more sweet - no coating (which I tried) is not quite sweet enough.  Flavors and texture very good though.

Terrific recipe.  I've made these cookies as directed (with the egg), as well as with Ener-G egg replacer, and they turned out wonderfully both ways.  I also tried a healthier version by replacing the margarine with Earth Balance (original).  When I did this, the cookies did not spread out and flatten -- so I ended up with thick ball-like cookies.  However, they were still soft and tasted terrific.  I am guessing it's the margarine that makes them flatten and spread.

These are DELICIOUS!  I followed directions with the exception of 1/4 cup butter and 1/2 butter flavored Crisco and substituted the sugar for Splenda/sugar blend.  These were NOT sticky at all.  I see some reviews stating they used shortening and did not have sticky dough so maybe that it the key?

I used a teaspoon and made small balls about 1.5 - 2 inches across which was rolled in sugar I colored red and green.  I then flattened them out with a fork and they were then about 2" across.  I baked for just over 7 min and for people who like crispy ginger cookies these are PERFECT! Crispy outside and a bit soft on the inside.  

Super easy.  I'm not an expert either....

I didnt have margarine or butter when i made this and wasnt thinking to look over the ingredients first. So, i started makin this when i found that out and i subsituted for olive oil. I used 4 ounces when doin the 24 servings. It made it a little slippery but i found it easier to hanlde with when stirring and shaping, and it wasnt sticky like most of the people commentings were. I set the time to 12 minutes like it says and it worked great! It might be oily while making but once its baked its not at all(:

Great recipe. I used 1/2 c shortening and 1/4 c butter just to see how it would affect taste/texture. It was perfect. Soft, chewy, molasses-y! They are sweet, so next time I might cut down the sugar a bit. A great holiday treat!

YUM! I added orange juice instead of water, I used brown sugar instead of white sugar. I put the dough in the freezer which then made it easier to form into balls. I also found that if you put them on hot cookie sheet they spread more which I didn't like. So I made sure to put that in the freezer as well. I made much smaller cookies and baked for 6 minutes. I then frosted with cream cheese frosting with orange zest.

These cookies are INCREDIBLE! I used to buy these at our local Farmer's Market from a Mennonite family and decided it would be cheaper to make them myself. I tried a few recipes before I found this one-this was it! The flavor is amazing and they stay so soft-yummm......

I gave this 3 stars because more spices are needed and the dough is very sticky.  I thought maybe i made a mistake in measuring, so i tried again and had the same results.  even after chilling the dough overnight it was still to sticky to roll. I added some coconut and butterscotch chips and it turned into a great drop cookie that was soft and chewy.

These tasted delicious. One problem though, I did three different batches, same size and flattened them out the same. Baked for the same amount of time at the same temperature and each batch turned out looking different...but never like the picture shown with this recipe. Overall, these are good, just not very attractive.

A trick to help those of you struggling with rolling them into balls:  wet your hands with water!  This will make the dough soft really quickly, so you have to work fast with each dough ball, but instead of rolling them around in your hands, gently toss it back and forth between your palms to make it round  :)  Worked like a charm for me!

DELICIOUS!  This was my first time making gingerbread cookies.  Because of the bold flavor of gingerbread I hoped I could get away with replacing half the flour with whole wheat.  The result: myself and 5 kids loved these!  We did a taste test between these and some crunchy ones Trader Joes that we loved also and these won unanimously.

I have never had a ginger cookie before, and I am so glad I made these. I followed the recipe exactly as written. I did take a teaspoon and drop it into the sugar to roll easier. I flattened them a little with a fork, and they formed into perfect circles as they baked. They were soft in the middle and had a nice ring of crunch on the outside. These are seriously some delicious cookies. And, easy to make, so I will be making them again.

Followed the recipes a 'T' and it turned out GREAT!  Dough was easy to roll and cookies came out soft and chewy and stayed that way!  Great flavor too!

Totally yummy. And as for the batter being wet or hard to work with, i didnt have this problem at all, but i didnt use my hands, i just used two spoons to make a ball and pushed it down- turned out just fine. I also didnt roll it in sugar, i only sprinkled some on before baking.

Very, very good just as advertised.  These were the first cookies that my 12 year old granddaughter made by herself (with me watching, of course) and they came out fantastic.  Next time we'll make a double batch.

Delicious.  Came out perfect.  I used real butter instead of margarine, and reduced it slightly (reduced water and added orange extract for flavor) to help with the "sticky" problems noted by other reviewers, and mine didn't stick at all!  Baked for 8 minutes, got 33 cookies.  Keeper.

First try at making any Gingerbread cookie and these turned out great!  My 4yr. old son tasted the batter before I baked them and he made a gross face.  I was a little worried at that point because none of us really like the taste of molasses.  But, after they were drenched in sugar and baked they turned out so good!

These are good, but I had some trouble finding the perfect baking time. I used a small cookie scoop to make equally portioned cookies (2 scoops each). They came out big and soft, but I had to cook them for 15 minutes. I took the first batch out after 10 and they were very under-cooked and gooey (not in a good way). My advice- bake a few cookies as a trial batch first. If your cookies are really big like mine were, you may need additional baking time. Yummy overall! 

Also, I shipped these to a friend for her birthday. In order to keep them moist, I included a piece of white bread in the air-tight bag.

These cookies were awesome! Just what I was looking for! I had to substitue the 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves for ground netmeg, and it was really good! They do get dry after a few days, but besides that they are perfect! Soft, chewy, and a hint of spiciness, these cookies are the best home made ginger cookies I've ever made!

Delicious!  I made two batches, one I cooked a little longer than the other and it turned out a little better since they were firmer.  I topped with the Gingerbread Icing recipe, and it made these cookies even better.

I had to redo my review because I made some more changes.  When I first made these they tasted great, but when we went to pick them up to eat they fell completely apart.  So I read some other reviews and these are my changes: I increased my flour to 2 1/2 cups and I cut the margarine back to 8 tbsp or 1 stick. Increased the ginger to 3 tsp and subbed out OJ for water.  I made sure to follow the instructions for creaming the margarine and butter and THEN adding the egg and molasses.  I baked for 15 minutes. It didn't fall apart and I still got a slightly softer cookie than I like so next time I'll bake longer.

I just found this recipe yesterday and immediately tried it.  I agree with several others, use orange juice NOT water.  Also put dough in the refrigerater for at least 30-45 before you use it or its way too sticky to spoon out.  Im making another batch today.  Only difference is today I chopped up 1/2 cup of crystalized ginger and added to the mix!!!  You just can not go wrong with this recipe.  The batch I made yesterday is already gone!!

I did not care for this recipe.  If you want them soft you have to under bake them.. If you want them crispy you bake them longer and then they are really crispy.  No real in between.  The flavor was "off".  They flavors didn't seem to blend well.  I wanted to take them to a PTA meeting tonight.  NO WAY!  now I have to make something else.

These had a fantasic taste, not to spicy just perfect. Found out that if you cook 8 mins they will be nice and soft and if you cook 11 mins they are nice and crispy. Both ways tasted amazing!

These cookies definitely improve with time. I was not fond of them when still slightly warm, but the next morning they were fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly, and would make a few changes. I did get complaints that the cookies were overly sweet, so I will try next time without rolling them in sugar. The cookie balls do need to be flattened only slightly. I flattened a little too much. Overall, great recipe!

Excellent cookies, definitely recommend with a few changes. Substituted orange juice for the water, and 1/2 cup butter and 1/4 cup butter flavored shortening for the margarine. Cooked only 7 minutes, and let rest 5 (the first batch I cooked 8-9 and they were great straight out of the oven, but lost some of their chewiness after they cooled). Also just as a note, people commented that they tasted more like a chewy mix between sugar cookies and ginger snaps... if you like a more spicy cookie, double the spice like others suggested. Even so, delicious!

Perfect balance between soft and chewy and enough crisp before your teeth sink in. I would cut the sugar to 3/4 cup as they are a bit too sweet. SO YUMMY

I made this recipe, because I had molasses sitting around. Not only did they turn out delicious but I ended up freezing the rest. I now have tasty treats whenever I have guests over! I can't wait to make these again!

Not only are these the easiest cookie in the world to make, they are one of the best!  I don't really like to eat cookies all that much (but love baking them), but these are fantastic.

3 of 5 because I made alterations. 1 Tbsp ginger, 2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp cloves, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp cardamom. I use 1/2 cup butter & 1/4 cup shortening, for extra softness. Brown sugar instead of white. 1 Tbsp milk instead of water. Sometimes I roll in sugar, sometimes not. Good basic ginger recipe, but I prefer more spice.

Easy, yummy and perfect. I used demera instead of white sugar. If you want cookies with crinkles don't flatten the balls.

Wow - amazing! I think next time I might reduce the cloves just a tiny bit-- otherwise, great!  I'm not sure how other people get the crinkles - I got very few crinkles!

I'd probably give this 5 stars if I were baking anywhere else, except there are/were some modifications needed to be successful at high altitude (9000 ft.).  I slightly reduced the butter and substituted a bit of shortening; I added 1/2 c. extra flour; I slightly reduced the sugar.  Next time I'll add more ginger and less cloves for a less "Christmassy" flavour, bearing in mind that at high altitude flavours are diminished.  Also, I used orange juice instead of water but can't taste any difference, and I think maybe half brown sugar might be nicer.  But fantastic base recipe!!!

Seventeen stars!  I used butter, just because I usually do, and orange juice for the water.  I have made these often and each time we devour them.  My all time favourite cookie.

My family loved these cookies.  They are perfect by just following the recipe.  Soft cookies unlike the hard ones you buy at the store.  This recipe is for keeps for sure.

OHMYGOSH! These cookies were AMAZING. I followed this recipe to the tea, and these cookies came out so great. I do have to say though that it was hard to roll the cookies into balls before baking, so I just got a spoon and spooned some onto the cookie sheet. That was completely fine with me. I just care about taste. I WILL be making these cookies again and again. Yummmmmmy!! :)

I make these cookies for my son and he loves them. I've made them with white sugar like the recipe calls for and have made them brown sugar as well and my son thinks they taste better made with the brown sugar. This is a very good and easy recipe if you like a nice spice cookie.

I've been on a search for the "perfect" ginger cookie for many years, and I agree w/ the rest - wonderful! I didn't have white sugar at home, only brown turbinado sugar and they still came out heavenly.  Thank you very much for the recipe!

Very Good. I do not understand why, but my first batch was on a shiny metal air bake cookie sheet and the cookies were extremely flat. Then the second batch was on a nonstick dark coated cooking sheet and they came out beautiful. I did not flatten either batch before cooking.

Oh my gosh, these are perfect!! I made this today on Christmas Eve, followed the directions exactly. Didn't put the water in though, I did put it in the frig. cuz I already knew it helps if you let them sit in the frig before cooking. I use the frig tick on Chocolate chip cookies, and just about all cookies because it makes them softer and way better. :)

These are delicious, this is almost exactly like the recipe on the Grandma's Molasses jar for molasses crinkle cookies. The only difference is that "Grandma" calls for a little water to be sprinkled on cookies before baking to make them shiny/crackly. Delicious! These were going to be a family tradition.  On a side note, I forgot to add baking soda and they turned out perfect without it.

What a moist and tasty cookie. This is my first time trying this recipe. I did make a slight revision, however based on a double batch. I reduced the sugar 1/3 cup with the double batch and 1/4 cup of butter and added some vanilla.   I took the advice and chilled it in the fridge for an hour. It was perfect, I can't wait to make it again.

This is the best cookie I've ever tasted. I made this recipe last year, I was making gingerbread men which would take hours of refrigerating and wanted something to eat quickly (lol). The gingerbread men weren't half as good as these and they took a full day. This was them most moist, chewy, spicy yet sweet ginger cookie I've ever had. I highly recommend them!

These really are amazing cookies!  SO soft!  The only change I would make is to add another tsp of ginger, as I really like the gingery taste.  Great recipe!

Toss in a couple of chopped up squares of Lindt 85 or 90% chocolate (or other quality chocolate) for an even better cookie which is hard to beat with this recipe. I am not keen on ginger so I decrease it while increasing the cinnamon. Enjoy!

YUM!  They are just like soft Gingersnaps.  I also used orange juice instead of water and refrigerated the dough for over an hour before handling it.  They look really nice too.

I've made this recipe many times. Although rather then making them into round flat cookies I always chill the dough for a few hours and then roll them. They turn out excellent everytime.

These are as good as they say! My husband is picky about his cookies, and he loved them. I put the dough in the freezer for about 15 minutes before I rolled it, and that solved the sticky problem. I also made the Sugar Cookie Icing on this website, an iced the cookies with it, and they were even better!

Yes, I agree with the last reviewer.  These cookies are unassuming- they look like they might be some boring standard kind of dried out gingerbread cookie, but they are definitely not!!  These are the best gingerbread cookies ever!!!  I added about a teaspoon of fresh grated ginger and used triple sec instead of the 1Tbs of water.  I came out like flat, chewy gingerbread cookies that were THE BEST.  I will never need to look for another ginger cookie recipe....yes, they are that good!

I just made these. I did not care for the taste. This was my first time making ginger cookies, and apparently, they are not my favorite. However, I must say the cookie came out perfect. Cooked well, was soft, and they were flavorful... they just arent a flavor I like :)

Delicious, simply delicious!! Easy to make, soft, tasty, my family loved them :)) I also substituted water for fresh orange juice, replaced some white sugar for the brown one, margarine for butter and I used some fresh ginger as well. However, we didnt have the molasses so I used a bit of honey. It looks like a lot of changes but they are just the small ones, the cookies are really really good! :))

Fabulous cookie!!!  Great texture, great taste!  I didn't have any issues with my dough being too sticky - it was perfect!  No need to chill it either.  I used my small cookie scoop, but overflowed it to rounded scoops.  Rolled in raw sugar because I like the bigger crystals.  Baked for 9 minutes and let cool for 5 min. on baking sheet.  This was just a test batch to see if they were worthy of making for holiday gatherings.  I will definitely be making these again!!!!

ABSOLUTELY THE BEST BEST Ginger cookies I've ever had.  Actually the best cookie I've had period! And they STAY soft which was a huge bonus.   They were so good I had to treat my work with them and they didn't believe that I made them.  Thanks for the Recipe.  This is one I'll keep for years to come!!

Good Cookies but came out a little hard; I baked longer than it said cause they didn't look done, but they bake some after taking out of oven. Found that my"air/insulated" cookie sheet worked  better than regular one. I'll continue to look for a recipe for darker ginger cookies with icing like I remember at my grandmother's house.

After reading all the rave reviews, I was actually pretty disappointed with these cookies.  I made them exactly as the recipe says, except I did refrigerate the dough for about 20 minutes before placing on the cookie sheet.  They taste pretty good, not great, but they look extremely nondescript and not at all enticing.  I made them for a party and was too embarrassed to take them, because of they way they look.  I might make them again with some modifications.  I think I would try with orange juice instead of water and I felt like they needed a little bit more flour.

OMG seriously THE BEST COOKIE I'VE EVER PUT IN MY MOUTH!!!  I think this outranks another sugar cookie recipe I make from this site.  What I did was used butter rather than margarine, replaced about 1/4 cup of the white sugar with dark brown sugar (still used 1 full cup), made the dough, let it sit in the fridge overnight, took it out the next day to soften, rolled the dough into 1 inch balls, flattened them to 1/4 inch thickness which made them about the size of a 50 cent piece, pressed them into sugar on both sides, baked them for 7 minutes using parchment paper, cooled them for 5 minutes on the cookie sheet, moved them to a wire rack to cool for 10 minutes and drooled until I could pop them into my mouth.  This recipe made about 65-70 cookies...I think, I lost track b/c I had a few and gave some to my kids and the kids across the street.  You don't have to be a "spice" or "ginger" cookie lover to enjoy these.

I am giving 4 stars only because I was disappointed with the appearance.  Like several others, I found mine to come out looking rubbery and flat, and not having that pretty "crackled" appearance.  On the last sheet out of the oven, I noticed that a couple of them looked like they had potential for the pretty crackled tops, and I think it was b/c I didn't press those down as much.  I had used a glass dipped in sugar to press them. Next time, I will just BARELY press them and see if that helps.  The flavor was amazing though - definintely 5 stars.  I had planned to use OJ in place of water but forgot to grab some at the store.  I'll definitely use OJ next time, as I think it will really take the flavor over the top.  I bought some coconut ice cream (Snoqualmie brand, yum!) and used these cookies to make little ice cream sandwiches for Hubs.  Let's just say the Angels wept.  And so did he.

I want to give this 5 stars because the flavor is great.  But how do I get them to come out looking like the picture.  Mine were really flat and didn't crack on top--which I think makes them look more appealing.

UNNNNNNBELIEVABLE!!!!!! Just got done making my first batch-they are perfect!  (They only substitution I made was adding orange juice instead of water like so many reviews said to do.  The cookies were soft inside with a little resistance (not really crunchy, just a wee bit crisp) on the edges.  Mine look a lot like the picture..they did not spread too thin at all.  I just pressed them down a little...for one batch, I forgot to press them down at all and it was hard to tell the difference.  They are so good that I am now mixing up my second batch.  My husband stopped home for a few minutes from work...I gave him a cookie-he couldn't believe how good they are-he grabbed 5 more on his way out the door!!! Ohhhh-will make again for my Christmas goodies!!!

Great cookies.  Just like an old fashioned ginger cookie, just soft and moist.  Grab a glass of milk and you'll have to make yourself quit eating them.

Due to living in the Netherlands, I don't have regular access to molasses.  I substituted honey instead.  Although the cookie is much lighter in color and doesn't have a molasses flavor, it still turned out very nicely.

I love this recipe!  Chilling the dough makes it easier to work with.  I have substituted olive oil for the margarine, they still come out great.  I have even made them with double the cinnamon and no ginger (for cinnamon lovers).    If you like snappy ginger cookies just bake them at 375 degrees.  But soft is superior, if you ask me!

The soothing gingery taste captivates every taste bud in your mouth. It took me such a short amount of time to make them; it took 30 minutes to put together and bake just over 40 cookies. I did not have to wait to use my dough, instead I slightly mounded my ¼ c. flour to make the dough more usable. I also took the advice of one of the reviews and used orange juice instead of water. The orange juice enhances the taste of the ginger to the ideal potency. Although some may enjoy the really sweet taste, rolling them in sugar, I chose to only sprinkle sugar on the top after removing them from the oven. This is a simple recipe for everyone to make and enjoy. These cookies truly make your mouth water.

DELICIOUS. WONDERFUL!  MY Favorite cookie!  I have been making this recipe forever.  Helpful hint: is to put the dough in the fridge for an hour or so.  The dough will be less sticky.  Also, roll the dough into balls, then sugar.  No need to flatten.  I have made this recipe substituting butter & shortening (margarine).  Butter tends to make these cookies more chewy (still wonderful)  Shortening gives them somewhat of a crisp on the outside & chewy inside.   YUM. Love these.  Recipe is a keeper.

Wow... wow... wow. These cookies are amazing. I followed the recipe nearly exactly, EXCEPT that I only had 1 tsp of ginger and I used unsalted butter, not margarine. My boyfriend has ate so many already he's getting a stomach ache, haha. I don't think these cookies will last for two days at the most. I used water like the recipe called for, and they're still amazing. I will however try using vanilla just for curiosity as other users have, and I'll even try nutmeg for fun. But this recipe as is will be used over and over and over again (unless adding the vanilla and nutmeg really makes a difference). Thank you so much!

These were just ok for me.  They did turn out soft, but when I bit into one, something was missing - nutmeg!  Next time I will add some to give it that spicy bite they were lacking.

BEST. GINGER. COOKIES. EVER!!!!   I followed the advice of others: Substituted cloves for nutmeg, water for vanilla extract and margarine for unsalted butter. I didn't roll these into the size of walnuts though, just a little bit smaller and I baked them for 9 minutes. The cookies turned out amazing! They were chewy but not overly soft with just enough bite to it - just the way I like my cookies :)   Thank you SOOO much for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Amazing. I didn't have eggs so I used 1/4th cup of apple sauce and 2 tsps of baking powder to substitute.   If you use demerara sugar to roll the cookies it gives them an AMAZING crunchy texture. YUM.

Delicious and soft cookies! I made them a bigger size than the recipe called for because the walnut sized recommendation seemed very small. The dough was very wet and I had trouble forming it into a ball to roll in the sugar. I chilled the dough in the fridge for   30 minutes and that helped.

These really are the best Ginger Cookies. They are soft and chewy and have a lovely amount of spiciness. I use butter instead of margarine because that is what I have on hand. It makes a soft dough, but putting it in the refrigerator between batches helps.

I made 5 dozen & took them to a father's day camping trip... they were all gone by the end of the first day!  I used butter instead of margarine, but didn't realize how flat it would make them.  I'll use margarine next time to keep them a little thicker.  Also, I packaged with a slice of bread in the container & they stayed sooo moist!  Will absolutely make again!

These are so good! I have made them twice in two weeks. I followed the recomendations of other reviewers and subbed OJ for water and chilled before cooking. Wonderful!

These were delicious and the name definitely represents them accurately.  Good, mild taste and very soft.  I might increase the ginger a little next time or take the other reviewers advice and use OJ instead of water.  Thanks for a great recipe!

These ARE very soft, the dough is hard to form into balls. Once you bake them they turn into a nicer shape, unlike what you drop on the cookie sheet! Excellent flavor!

I just finished making these and they are incredible!  I did make a few modifications though based on the recommendations of others and my personal taste.  I used 3 teaspoons of ginger, 1 1/2 teaspoons of cinnamon, and 1 teaspoon of cloves.  I also used dark brown sugar instead of white sugar and oj instead of water.  I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/4 cup margarine only because that is all I had.  I used a lot more white sugar to roll them in then the recipe called for, but I don't know how much I ended up using.  I did not have to flatten them at all.  I only baked them for 6 minutes (they were underbaked) and then after a couple of minutes, moved them to a wire rack.  The result is a delicious, chewy, spicy cookie!  I just wish I had made a double batch.  It made about 40 cookies (they weren't that big), but between us my husband and I ate 16 in one sitting!

Really good but really sweet!  I probably will cut down the sugar to 3/4 of a cup next time.  They really flattened out.  Super easy to make.  It was a little messy to roll out but I had a spare pair of disposable gloves and those took care of it.  Really good flavor, I'm super pleased with these!  I think I like Ginger Snaps 2 better (less spice - I think the cloves are a tiny bit much for me), but quite pleased.  A coworker ran off with 2 more after sampling one....

This recipe was not to my liking. Followed the recipe carefully, put it in the oven and at 7 minutes already were they bubbly and flat like a pancake. First batch, won't sink; were like gingersnaps. This is my second batch and they both turned out not to my liking. Will not try a third time.

Absolutely delicious!!! I made these using whole wheat flour, coconut oil instead of butter, egg whites, agave nectar instead of the 1 cup of sugar, and I omitted the 2 tablespoons of sugar. Perfect! I think the next time I make them I may try to substitute some applesauce for some of the oil/butter to make them a little healthier, but these were absolutely fantastic!

Very delicious.  These were gone in ONE NIGHT with my book club.  The only reason I gave it four stars was because they look NOTHING like the picture, so I was constantly freaked out.  The taste however was FIVE stars.

These were a big hit at Christmas time. Exactly what I was looking for- flavorful, soft and chewy. I did use 1/2 whole wheat flour and only 3/4 cup sugar.

This is the PERFECT recipe for ginger cookies!! It is truly awesome! I used brown sugar in place of molasses, but it tasted just great that way too. This is a definite keeper. I have already made about 100 of these cookies through winter. And, will keep on! Love it! THANK YOU!!

I made these this afternoon...... ooh my kids are gonna love them!!! They are nice and rich and exceptionally chewy!!! I really enjoy the consistency of the dough too, it was soo easy to work with. The only thing I changed was instead of using white sugar I used golden brown sugar in the recipe, then I rolled my balls and dipped the bottom of a glass in 2 tbsp of white sugar and pressed each cookie. I had absolutely no problem with the consistancy. Thanks so much for posting (I think I'll make these every christmas instead of my gingerbread men that has been a tradition for 30+ yrs.)

I followed the recipe exactly,  and the cookies came out great :D  Nice flavor from the spices,  plus it's soft as promised.  very happy with the result (= good cookies)  I've put in a bit more ginger though, I think I'll put in a bit more next time.  Despite another comment I read before baking, I don't think these cookies are that sweet.   I will bake this again for sure :)  p.s. I think next time I'll try substituting water with Orange juice, and put some more ginger in as I mentioned.

Amazing flavor and texture. But like others have noted, you MUST let the dough sit and harden at least 45 minutes. Preferably in the freezer. Not only does this make the dough easier to handle, but it will also prevent the finished cookies from deflating. I didn't let my first batch harden enough, and they ended up very flat and unappealing.   I also had to bake the full 10 minutes. At first I removed after 8, thinking the cookies would continue to cook. But they didn't, and ended up sticking (a lot) to the sheet. Those 2 minutes made all the difference, giving a beautiful appearance with nice edges and perfectly chewy and moist centers. I also threw in a cup of dried cranberries - complements the ginger really well.

An absolutely great tasting, beautifully textured cookie. Mine turned out just like the photo, big and soft! I did put the dough in my freezer about 2 minutes before shaping into balls to decrease stickiness and make handling easier. I also used allspice instead of ginger as I don't care for ginger... made a wonderful soft molasses cookie!

These are good cookies, but they don't turn out big and soft and fat like the picture shows.  I made them exactly as the recipe directed.  We are at high altitude, so maybe that had something to do with it.  I also think they would have been better with more spices - they were mild tasting, and we prefer a spicier cookie, so if I made them again I'd double the cinnamon and cloves, and maybe increase the molasses too.

These are the best ginger cookies in the world!!! Make sure to freeze the dough for 30 minutes before rolling and baking. This will stiffen the dough to make it easier for rolling. Perfect recipe, do not modify!

I just made my first batch and YUM!!!  I did as others suggested and substituted orange juice for the water.  Also, I didn't have time to bake them the night I mixed them up, so I put the dough in the fridge over night - they were a cinch to roll up and bake today!  This is definitely a keeper!

I LOVE these cookies! I too swapped the water for O.J.. I would suggest to anyone that had problems with them being sticky you really need to make sure you cream until fluffy as is stated in the recipie, and don't over mix when adding the flour mixture. I did need to very slightly pat down but if you squish the cookie it won't be as fluffy and will be a little more crunchy. Great cookies!!

Delicious cookie!  Mine came out flat and the edges are crispy with a soft middle.  The batter was sticky, but not impossible to work with.  I sprayed my hands with vegetable oil to make rolling these easier.

These had amazing taste.  I used orange juice instead of water as others...gosh these were excellent.  Very sticky to work with.  I thought they were worth it. They didn't even last 24 hours in my house.  They make a pretty moist cookie...don't stack them on top of each other when storing!  They stick to each other. I used wax paper to divide them. Otherwise you get a huge clump of cookies.  They melt in your mouth...mmmmmm so good.

Really soft and chewy around the edges!  Substituted butter for the margarine, added 1 tbsp cocoa and 1 tsp minced ginger, and 3/4 tsp more ground ginger for that extra ginger flavour.

I am a first time Ginger Cooker baker, and I am hooked.  The first batch I didn't cook long enough, so I put them back in (after they cooled) but it didn't save them.  The rest turned out perfect enough to take to a Xmas party.  I was lucky enough to have that first batch to eat myself.  I will definitely make these again and again.

These cookies taste delicious, however, mine were not terribly soft. Perhaps because I took the advice of previous reviews and added a little extra flour and salt for ease of handling. Pairing that with the freezer technique made working with these cookies no problem.

I love this cookie! I have to make every year at christmas time. If you want more of a gingersnap cookie, cook it a little longer. But this cookie recipe will make a nice soft ginger cookie that is full of spice and stays soft! YUM!

These cookies are delicious!  I made them for Christmas presents last year, and for a bake sale recently.  They were the only cookies to sell out!  I followed the advice of several reviewers and used orange juice instead of water the second time around... it makes these cookies 100 times better than they already are! :)

These cookies are fabulous. I've made them twice in the last few weeks and all of my guests have loved them. I use the OJ instead of water, up the ginger to 3 teaspoons, and cinnamon to 1 1/2 teaspoon. I chill the dough for an hour, and I roll the cookies in a sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger mix before putting them on the baking sheet. Sooo tasty!

Pretty disappointing...I am not a margarine fan and the oily flavor and texture it gave these seemed overwhelming. I also usually underbake my cookies because we like them very soft, but even cooking these for the full 10 min they were still raw in the middle but almost hard on the outside. I also tripled the spice since we like things very ginger-y, and I think without doing that they would have been really bland. The dough was impossible to work with no matter how long I chilled them, and compared to other recipes these were, well, horrible.

We tried this recipe based on all the great reviews and we were NOT disappointed. We also added the 1/4 teaspoon of salt as suggested by previous reviews and it was delicious! We will be using this recipe year after year! It is definitely a keeper!

What am I doing wrong!!  I was so excited to try these cookies and mine turned out nothing like all the pictures for this recipe.  First off, the dough was so gooey that I could barely roll them in sugar.  Secondly, the cookies puffed up nicely during baking, but after cooling for the 5 minutes they were completely flat, with no cracks.  And finally after they cooled, the centers looked uncooked and were a different color than the edges. I cooked them for the full amount of time. They tasted fine, but looked just awful.  I plan to try again, but I really don't know what to do differently to achieve the success everyone else seemed to have.

I accidently left out the molasses and was surprised at how easy the dough was to work with ( I didn't need to chill it).  The spice is wonderful without the sometimes overwhelming molasses!  Next time I'm going to remember the molasses and compare the two variations!

These cookies are amazing. I read the other reviews and used the orange juice instead of water. I also used 1/4 cup brown sugar and 3/4 cup white sugar like someone else suggested. I feel like it makes it a little bit healthier. Even though it probably doesn't. I didn't have any margarine, so I just used real butter. I thought they were wonderful, especially dipped in coffee. yum.  However, my family thought they had just a little too much of a salty taste. Maybe next time I will cut down on the salt. Also, I used unsulfured molasses and I think thats what make them a lighter color. If you want to get the darker effect, then I believe the answer is blackstrap molasses. I've read that it's not as sweet as the others, so maybe a little more sugar will be needed, but it has iron and other things that make these cookies a little healthier. Thank you for the great recipe. It will defenitely be a keeper in my family.

Wonderful ginger cookie!  I followed directions to the letter and I came up with 24 perfect cookies!  The dough was not sticky outside of what I would expect for cookies (no sticking my hand into a bucket of gooey dough), and they taste phenomenal!  I will try to sustitute orange juice for the water, however made as written, amazing and perfect!  Thanks for posting AMY!

These are wonderful!!  I followed the directions exactly the first time, and they turned out really good.  This second time, I substituted 1/4 of the white sugar for brown, used 2 TBS of molasses, omitted the water, and substituted butter for margarin, and my family loved them even more!  I use a 1 TBS dough scoop to get them the perfect size.  I also take a orange juice glass, dipped in sugar, to lightly press them down.  Next time, I'm going to try the orange juice as another reviewer suggested.

These cookies came out so perfect looking that everyone insisted they were store bought.  Luckily my husband was there while I was making them, so I had proof that they were homemade.  They turned out chewy, but I would have liked them even chewier (that's why I gave them 4 stars instead of 5).  But I would definitely make them again.

My new favorite cookie. Perfect blend of spices with just that bit of bite. I made these 5 days ago and still have about 6 left. I just had one with my tea and they are still soft like they were baked this morning. Now that's impressive.

I subbed 1 tbsp water for OJ and let the dough chill in the fridge for 40 minutes before baking(per other reviews).  These cookies flattened out too much and didn't ever set.  I also felt the margarine taste was overwhelming.  As written, I can only give the recipe 1 star; however, if I were to alter the recipe and use butter instead of margarine and use 1/2 brown & 1/2 white sugar I may have had a better cookie.  I will not make these again.

Totally Awesome!!!! I have just made these and they baked up so wonderful and delicious. I doubled the recipe (using the calculator on here) and also using fresh juice from an orange per other reviews. When I rolled the dough I made the size of a walnut and pressed so ever slightly. My kitchen smells so wonderful. I will surely be making these agian very soon. I just don't understand why some are having such a rough time with them baking up so nice. THANK YOU!!!for the wonderful Big Soft Ginger Cookies.

Absolutely delicious!!  I used the suggestions of half white half brown sugar and OJ instead of water.  I also added in the zest of the orange I used for the juice.  They are perfectly spiced.

Tasted great.  Came out exactly like the others were saying.  I used butter (I never use margarine) and brown sugar instead of white (didn't have any at home!!!!), but otherwise followed recipe as written.  I assume those who didn't like these are looking for a different blend of the spices.  We thought they were great!!!!!!

Ok, I really made these because the rating was so high and it looked like a good fall recipe.  But let me tell you, I made a batch on Monday and already today I am making it again except doubling it to give some small plates to friends.  Awesome!! I substituted the orange juice, used brown sugar instead of white, nutmeg instead of cloves and baked 5 minutes longer than recipe said to.  You would be missing out if you skipped these.  Great with a cup of tea and a good book.

Oh my goodness! I just made these, and they are hands down the BEST cookie I have ever made!!! I was a little skeptical at first, because quite frankly the batter smelled disgusting. I'm pregnant, and you better believe I almost lost my lunch a few times lol. But after baking, they are just delicious! I am going to make everyone some of these for Christmas!

These were delicious. I followed other's suggestions and substituted orange juice (fresh from a navel orange) for the water in the recipe. It accented the flavor of the spices in the recipe, almost like a spicy soft version of a gingerbread cookie. I didn't chill the dough (as per other's recommendations) before forming it into balls and I didn't experience any of the flat cookies others were mentioning. Mine came out perfectly fluffy. I did add some finely chopped crystallized ginger that was hanging around my spice rack. It added a nice depth of flavor to these cookies. They were very good just rolled in sugar prior to baking. I think the glaze might have been a bit too much sugar. I may make a small amount and test it on one or two cookies. Maybe mix the powdered sugar with orange juice rather than water to carry through with the orange flavor? Regardless, very good and definitely on my list for holiday baking.

With a name like, "Big, Soft..." I expected these to be just that- soft, cake-like cookies. So, I was rather disappointed when they were flat and chewy. Next time I may add a smidge more flour or a bit less fat. They did, however, taste good, so 4 stars.

tasted and smelled delicious. the dough wasnt sticky for me, like others said. I did mix the heck out of the butter and sugar, before adding other ingredients. They rolled perfectly. I followed the recipe exactly as written- first time making this type of cookie. They did  taste like butter, which I love, but was distracting from the rest of the cookie. Needs more molasses. Next time I'll incorporate others suggestions. I will up the molasses to 3T, instead of 2T.

These were fantastic!  I substituted the water for OJ and did an orange juice and powder sugar glaze over top.  Very soft and addictive!  Worth the trip to the store for the molasses and margarine.

These really are the perfect ginger cookies. I love the taste of gingersnaps, but I prefer the softness of these cookies. I always get tons of compliments and requests to pass on this recipe. I make these every fall because the smell reminds me of Thanksgiving and Christmas.

This has to be the most delicious cookie recipe I've ever tried! You have to like ginger to really appreciate these cookies, but if you do, you're in for a heavenly treat. Instead of making cookies, I put the batter into an 8x8" pan and made cookie bars. Either way, they are delicious!

Big and soft they were! The texture of the cookie itself was perfect. I did find that the molasses overpowered the spices a tad, and I for one prefer a "spicy" cookie. Maybe I will add more spice next time. Great recipe! :-)

I doubled the batch and did some experimenting with the dough.  First, I used butter instead of margarine and I added freshly grated nutmeg to the spice blend. Also, I used sorgham molasses but next time I will use straight molasses to get the "tang" and the "bite." The dough was managable without refrigeration BUT I did NOT roll into balls. I used a tablespoon to measure and scoop out the dough and I sprinkled raw sugar on the tops. This worked out GREAT and required no flattening. I was not able to finish the cookies in one night so I refrigerated the remaining dough until the next day. The dough was able to be rounded into balls but did not need flattening. Also, having the dough sit overnight in the refrigerated seemed to let the flavors marinate a bit as this batch was "spicier" than the batch I made the night before. My oven is old and has hot spots (good to know if you're a novice baker) so I baked the cookies for 4 minutes, turned the pan and continued for 3 minutes. They were slightly browned around the edges and set in the middle. I stored them in airtight containers and they stayed nice and soft. If you like ginger then you'll really like these. If you're not keen on autumn spices or molasses, you'll probably not like these. A great tip is to use molases/ sorgham molasses you REALLY REALLY like. If you can get the sticky stuff at a mill, do it. It's worth the effort for maximum flavor ;)

The cookies taste good, but the recipe needs to be clearer on 2 things.  The dough is unmanageable without being cooled a while.  We left it in the fridge for about an hour and it was easy to roll into balls after- otherwise it was mushy and sticky.  The other issue is the cooking time... I left the first tray in the oven 10 minutes and while they looked cooked, the cookies are so undercooked inside I could probably roll them into a ball of dough and start over.  The second batch was left in about 15 minutes and the cookies came out harder and crispier.  Next time I will go with 13 minutes and hope it will result in a soft cookie as described.

These were really easy to make, and they are so good I'm having a hard time not to eat the whole batch. A very flavorful cookie, and one I will be making often. I did as suggested, and let the dough rest in the freezer for a half hour, and it was fine to work with.

Excellent cookie. No problems with the dough or the recipe. Used butter in place of margarine, I had no margarine to use. This recipe made 48, not the 24 that is stated in the recipe. Rolling the dough was not sticky after forming a ball and rolling in sugar. Very nice look and taste. Easy recipe. Will make many more times to come.

Great soft cookie with tons of flavor!  I did half butter half margarine for more flavor, and made smaller cookies for bite size nuggets and they came out great.  These hit the spot!

Everyone who had these said they were the best ginger cookies they'd ever had.  They loved the fact that they were so soft! I think they're better after a day or two but that's just my opinion

Great! Added an extra 1/2 tsp. baking soda because the first batch turned out a little flat, and just dropped the dough by teaspoonfuls onto the cookie sheet -- no rolling. Easy!

-BEST- ginger cookies I've ever had! They were a hit with this family! I did make one change to the recipe: I used 1 teaspoon of fresh ginger along with 1 teaspoon of dry ground. I hope to do these again around Christmas and maybe try icing them. Thanks for the fabulous cookies!

These are good.  I had a difficult time removing them from an ungreased cookie sheet without them breaking. So I sprayed a little Pam on the next tray and they came off much easier.

These cookies are pretty good, I like that they are very soft. I used fresh ginger and didn´t really measure it, but I think I put just the right amount. The only thing for me is that they didn´t rise well at all, I´m glad I didn´t flatten them. I usually get more cookies out of the doughs by making smaller balls, but this made exactly 24 normal sized cookies. Will most probably make again,though.

what I like about this cookies is the texture. they are really soft unlike many hard ginger cookies I've eaten. I can't find molasses in my country so i use sub as allrecipes advice, brown sugar+cream of tartar but the color of my cookies is light unlike how the normal brown ginger cookies. This is a good cookie but lack the ginger taste that I expected. The next time I'm making this, I'm gonna double the ginger and cinnamon. Nevertheless, a good recipe! #UPDATE# I had half of this batter in the freezer, so this time baking them, i rolled the balls in a 1/3cup brown sugar+/1/2tsp ginger powder + 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon. This way, the ginger taste and aroma is intensified and they are so delicious!

I doubled this recipe and took them to a family reunion over the weekend.  They were a big success!  Everyone commented on how good they were!  Thank you for this easy delicious recipe.  I love that I didn't have to roll them out.

They were a huge hit at work when I brought them in for my staff room duty. I didn't care for them much myself because I found them a bit heavy on the ginger. As well as my second batch never cooked properly. They were uncooked in the middle and regardless as to how much more time I gave them they refused to cook. I may try again but definitely not going to be the first recipe I grab when I'm making cookies.

These cookies were soft and chewy and SOOOOOO good! I did refrigerate the dough before making the cookies and that helped me to handle them. I will make these again!

Wonderful!I made these on a 90 degree summer day and the dough was really runny. I was worried about it, because I had to make them like drop cookies. No fear, they still came out beautifully, and two plates dissappeared. Not too gingery, not too molassess-y - perfect!

Why is the picture shown with a frosting when there's no mention of frosting in the recipe?  Also, I read someone's review who said to really flatten the cookie.  I disagree, they have more substance if you only slightly flatten before cooking.  I also refrigerated the batter for a bit and made smaller dough balls.  Yummy cookies.

These were SO amazing! My husband begs me to make these cookies! I actually make small cookies so they will go around - because EVERYONE can't wait to get their hands on these cookies! I really like the ginger flavor. It's not too strong, but it isn't weak like store bought cookies. The flavor kind of reminds me of the chewy ginger candies that you can find in airports. Wonderful!

I made these two nights ago & they are already gone. I found that I had to cook them for about 10.5 minutes in order to lose that "are these finished cooking?" texture to them.  The true find was putting a scoop of vanilla ice cream between two warm cookies...

I made these for a company Thanksgiving party last year and they were the first thing gone (before the actual "meal").  I had sooo many compliments about how chewy and soft they were and they are always a hit.  I also made a very large batch to send to my husband in Iraq earlier this year and he said his buddies couldn't get enough.  These are in one word: AWESOME!

So good! I used 1 Cup whole wheat flour and 1 1/4 Cups white flour.  I also just used 1/2 cup butter but added 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce.  The cookies turned out delicious and very moist!  I made the cookies a little smaller and I didn't flatten them at all because they spread out on their own.

LOVED this recipe!! I've made it a couple times now and both times they've turned out exactly how i want them to: chewy and soft! The first time i rolled them in sugar before baking it but i found that to be too sweet. The second time I just stuck them in the oven without the sugar coating and they were perfect. Thanks for putting this recipe up!!

These turned out delicious (true to the name!).  I used orange juice instead of water.  Ginger cookies are not usually my favorite - I don't like them when the molasses and ginger flavor is too strong but these are just right.

These cookies were delicious.  I was a little skeptical while I was making them because the dough did not taste good at all (my sister who normally eats all my cookie dough did not like it at all).  However, once the cookies baked they tasted wonderful!  I like other people had to refrigerate the dough before trying to make the cookies, but I just stuck in the freezer for 30 minutes and it was good!

I have made these cookies several times. The only things I did differently were leave out the cloves, use butter instead of margarine, and squash the cookies down on the cookie sheet a little more than suggested. These are exactly what I was looking for- I do not enjoy crunchy ginger cookies, but these are truly soft. Absolutely delicious... my new favorite cookie recipe!

I made these with butter and they still stayed soft and moist!  I prefer a bit of a crisper cookie, but my family prefers them soft.  These were delicious, easy, and kept well.  Everyone in my family really enjoyed them!  Thanks!

wow - i really don't understand how one recipe can result in so many different results!  most reviewers who gave a lower rating complained that the cookies flattened too much.  this is usually from using too much butter in a recipe or not enough flour.  i found that this recipe had so much flour that i had to use my hands just to mix it all in.  good thing is that the more flour you pack in a cookie, the softer it will turn out.  problem was that these did not flatten out AT ALL.  it was very crumbly to shape into balls (takes a whole afternoon if you double the recipe!) and came out of the oven as balls.  second batch in oven i flattened completely with the bottom of a glass.  problem with that is that they are not that incredibly tasty... a mild spice and just kind of there.  because i doubled the recipe and have a ton of dough and kids anxious to have good cookies for the weekend, i will ice these babies with a brown sugar icing or an orange icing.  that should salvage them enough.  i just can't believe this recipe gets a full five stars when 1600 people have tried it!  i can only assume that these people have not ever tried REALLY good cookies LOL.

These cookies were amazing!!!  I took them to work and everyone raved about them.  I frosted them with "Chocolate Cookie Buttercream Frosting" from this website (which you can use without adding the cocoa powder).  I wish I could give this ten stars.

These were soft and very yummy!  My kids LOVE ginger cookies.  I did NOT chill the dough as others have suggested.  I just used my medium-sized scoop and put the drops right onto the cookie sheet.  I then dipped a cup into some sugar and GENTLY pressed each cookie, leaving the sugar only on the top.  I made these to take along on a road trip and they went very fast.  I will definitely make this again.  They are a new family favorite!

Very good, standard ginger cookie. The flavors all blend really well together. I added some cinnamon sprinkles on top, which added nice color and a little extra flavor. I don't, however, think this recipe would work very well for rolling - it's pretty sticky. It does, however, work great for rounds.

Thank you, what a great recipe!  These cookies are a divine combination between two of my hubby's favorite cookies; snickerdoodles and ginger snaps!  I used butter instead of margarine, as that's what I keep on hand.  I also used vanilla sugar for rolling the balls in.  MMMM!  For the size of my cookie dough scooper, 13 mins was perfect.  The texture is addictingly chewy and slightly crisp around the edges.  WOW!

These are okay. Nothing special, just like any other ginger cookie I've made before really. I used butter instead of margarine and I still thought it could have more butter flavor. They're not too sweet - even rolled in sugar - which is nice.

I finally made these! my family LOVED them. I did change one think and think it might have been a mistake, i made them with a glaze instead of rolling them in sugar.. i think they would have like them more rolled in sugar, this cookie is NOT too sweet, it is perfect and the rolling them in sugar would make them a 6! DO NOT flatten your cookies too much, or at all. i used 1/2 cup margarine, 1/4 cup butter and flattened the first batch with a glass, they were way too thin, then i flattened them slightly with my fingers.. i liked them that way!

This is one of my very favorite cookie recipes.  I always use butter, and I about 1/3 of a cup of chopped candied ginger.  I roll the balls in a mixture of white sugar and black pepper before baking!  Super spicy and good!!

This is the ONLY recipe I will ever use for ginger cookies! I make at least 1 batch a week and between my kids & my hubbie, they never last more than a couple of days! Definitely sub OJ for the water, but other than that the recipe is absolutely perfect as is. Just be careful not to overbake (no more than 11 minutes on the upper middle rack) or they'll cool crisp like ginger snaps - still a fantastic tasting cookie, but much better when soft and chewy. My whole family and most of my friends thank you for sharing this one...

Perfection, that's all I'm saying.  I made one change, I did not have any molasses so I used dark Karo syrup and it still turned out perfect.  These cookies literally melted in our mouths and next time I'll double the recipe!

My wife and friends couldn't get enough of these cookies. I didn't have molasses so I substituted 50% cup honey + 50% maple syrup. Great cookies for a cookie sandwich - two cookies joined together by some still frozen whipped topping.

These are amazing, and keep moist for a long time too. My only recommendation is to use an insulated cookie sheet if you have one. It considerably widens the window between underdone and burnt.

Of all the homemade cookies we made and received this holiday, these were the best and most popular.  They really are the perfect softness and stay soft.  I used turbinado sugar instead of white sugar.

I made these over the Christmas break. I'm not a huge fan of gingerbread, but these were awesome. I had several people ask me for the recipe. I took one reviewer's advice and sprayed my hand with flour cooking spray, to prevent the dough from sticking... worked like a charm.

YUM! These are some extremely yummy ginger cookies!  The dough was very easy to work with, the cookies were really easy to make and came out looking real good.  I used orange juice instead of water and added the zest while I was at it.  Added something special to the cookie.

They aren't the best that I've ever tasted, but they're definitely an impressive homemade cookie to serve. 

For me, the chewiness and ginger flavor were the most important. When I first tasted the batter, I also thought the molasses was overwhelming. I added more ginger and more salt. I also added vanilla extract and a tablespoon of milk to give a little extra "lift." 

I refrigerated the dough in a covered bowl for about two hours before forming into balls with a spoon. 

Instead of just sugar, I rolled the dough balls in a mixture of sugar, a little salt, some ginger and allspice. I did not flatten the balls before baking. 

I started off with small cookies baked for 8 minutes, but found the best chewiness with large cookies baked for 10 minutes. Since gingerbread cookies are so fickle, you might want to do some trial and error with your oven to figure out how long to bake to get the desired consistency.

How can a recipe this simple be so delightful? But that's what these cookies are! Like a reviewer suggested, I used orange juice instead of water. And I added about a tablespoon or two extra of flour.

These aren't the best-ever ginger cookies I've had, but they were good! I first subsituted the sugar for Splenda and they were awful. Too sweet and dry and crumbly. Because of the amazing reviews I decided to try them again. I didn't have white sugar but instead used brown sugar and they turned out great!

These are the best! The only thing I did differently was used salted butter instead of the margarine. After creating my walnut-sized balls, I used a patterned spatula flatten the dough leaving a very pretty pattern. My husband and son (who typically aren't ginger fans) loved these. They turned out so good; I made six-dozen cookies and gave them to friends and family. Everyone enjoyed them. These will be added to my yearly holiday baking list.

I, too, was very disappointed in this recipe.  For whatever reason, after it was mixed it was like cake batter.  I had to add lots more flour to make a dough thick enough for cookies.  Even then, it was sticky and the cookies turned out to be more cake-like than what I prefer.  I won't use it again, but will go back to my old favorite Molasses Sugar Cookie recipe.

I've made these cookies three times this year, and plan to bake several more in the next few days. I've discovered that for the cookies to be chewy and have the beautiful cracks, you must use margerine--not butter. In my last batch, I increased the amount of butters, and they became a bit too cake-like. I also increased the amounts of cinnamon and cloves--for that spicy taste. Delicious! Thanks for the recipe

This cookie made my house smell WONDERFUL!  I used another reviewers suggestion to use orange juice rather than the water.  And I threw the blobs in the sugar and then rolled into balls.  I used the bottom of a bowl to flatten the cookies.  And I used the glaze recipe from "Cranberry Orange Cookies" recipe.  YUM YUM!

These were excellent! They really were nice and soft. I used dairy-free shortening (earth balance) and they still turned out great. Will definitely make these again. I did chill the dough before baking.

they were a bit flat and not as chewy as i had hoped but maybe I just rolled the dough too thin. The flavour was good though

I made these cookies with my mom because she wanted soft ginger cookies. These came out great, and sooo easy!!! We did put the dough in the fridge for about an hour to make it easier to work with. I dipped them in red and green sugar for a festive look. They really do come out soft and stay that way. Great recipe!!

These were really good- very addicting! They were soft and chewy, which is how I like my cookies, and disappeared almost instantly. Even my sister, who claims that she hates ginger, enjoyed them (in fact, I do believe that she ate the majority of them...).

I tried the cookies but they came out flat and not what I expected in taste. If I were to make them again I would add a little more flour and put them in the refrigerator for a couple of hours.

Very tasty!!  They are Big (they really spread on the pan...so leave a lot of space) and they are Soft (they are not like a hard crunchy ginger snap)....but they weren't what I originally expected by the name....I thought I would get a cake like cookie with some height to it.  These were flat, bendable, and large.  With that said, they were very, very good!

Oh, these are just too good for words!  Make them just as the recipe states!  I think that the air temperature/weather has something to do with the batter consistency.  I made mine in a warm morning, letting the cold ingredients come to room temperature, and they were not sticky.  Then I helped a friend who didn't bring the ingredients to room temp, the weather was cold, and the batter was sticky.  But whatever, these are just plain delicious!  I didn't roll them in sugar but rather sprinkled some on the tops.

My favourite recipe - We`re including this cookie in this year`s frozen cookie dough buckets - which is my son`s gift to family for Christmas.  Form the cookies as indicated, but freeze on a cookie sheet until solid, then place into freezer storage container to cook later -  with the instructions to thaw at room temperature for 15 minutes to 1/2 hour before cooking.  I double this recipe, and then have enough to keep some around in our own freezer too!!

As the other posters have said, these are great cookies!  I followed another poster's advice and used orange juice instead of the water....am mulling over using coffee next time just to see what happens.   The only other things I did was throw in a few tablespoons of brown sugar--only because I was nearly out of regular sugar--and I put in some extra ginger because we love that 'bite'.

Also, I flattened the first cookies and then tried baking them without flattening them out, and I think I like the non-flattened ones better.

To repeat what other posters have said, put your dough in the fridge for 30 minutes or so...makes a world of difference in working with them.

I'll definitely be baking these again!!

I needed something quick and easy and this recipe hit jackpot.  The cookies were delicious and I followed previous tips on flattening out the walnut-sized pieces of dough before baking.  I was fortunate enough to try a piece because everyone rationed over how much they could take home.  There were none left!  Soft, tasty, and convenient.  Thanks for sharing Amy.

I must agree with the majority, these are "the best"!  I don't usually like to change the instructions, but I did omit the water and they turned out perfect!  I didn't seem to have any problem with the dough being goopy and some other had shared, but maybe not using the water made the difference.

Excellent recipe! Made just as written and they were a hit with the coworkers. And they make your kitchen smell amazing! I recommend sprinkling with a little raw sugar before baking for a special touch. Yum!

I used Blackstrap Molasses instead of Sorghum, not for any particular reason though.  Blackstrap molasses gives an intense flavor to the cookies which, I think, competes with the spices.  Also, I took them out of the oven a few minutes before they looked "done", let them rest on the sheet for a minute, and they were perfectly soft on the inside, crispy on the edges.  One batch I cooked until they looked ready, and they turned out crispy.

These are great tasting cookies but mine came out flat as pancakes.  Dough must be chilled for several hours or it will be very difficult to work with.  There is no need to flatten before baking.  If I make again, I will reduce the butter.

I have the Allrecipes Cookie cook book and this is in there.  I cook professionally and used it for about 100 people.  I don't generally care for Ginger cookies but I loved these.  I also followed the recipe exactly.  If the dough is too soft, and you don't have time to refridgerate, use your small icecream scoop and a glass of hot water to make the size.  It helps to try it in its original form before you go and start altering them.

Delicious! I made these to share with friends and family and everyone raved about them. As others suggested, I substituted orange juice instead of water. I also used 1/2 C white sugar and 1/2 C brown sugar. I will be making these cookies a lot during the holidays! =)

There's a reason that there's 1200 Five Star Ratings... These are perfect!!!  I did up the spices a bit (heaping measuring spoons), added vanilla and nutmeg, used Butter Flavor Crisco, 3/4 cup BROWN sugar instead of a cup of white sugar, and instead of water, I used Triple Sec.  Absolutely amazing.

This cookie is amazing!  Everybody loves it, including my picking 4 year old, who can't get enough.  The first time I made this, I stuck to the recipe, and it was delish.  The second time, I cut the sugar to only 3/4 cup and it was just as good, if not better.  Since the dough was very sticky, I put it in the fridge for 1/2 an hour before forming them into balls, and it was mess-free to work with.  Will be making this again and again.

These cookies are soooooooooo good! They  are addicting so if you don't want to end up eating them all give them away immediately. The only thing I changed is I added a TBS of vanilla and I added some nutmeg.

Perfect blend of spices and easy to make. The kids loved helping roll the cookies in the sugar. I sprinkled extra on top, as well. My husband took these to work and said they were gone within minutes. Very tasty...no need to change anything on this recipe!

Excellent cookies!! Only thing i changed in the recipe was the water measurement, i think it should be 1 tsp not 1 tbsp, the dough was too watery the first time and it ruined the cookies,then when i made it with less water & they puffed right up just like in the picture.

Fantastic!  Just like the recipe name says - they are big, soft and have a nice ginger flavor.  I found that I had to bake them a little longer than recommeneded.  Will definately make again!

It was very yummy. I substituted 1/3 with whole white wheat flour and it tasted great. One change I would try is to reduce the sugar little bit next time.

These cookies are something special. I make them very often. Although I use yellow sugar instead of white and dark brown sugar instead of molassa. Theyare still soft and delicious.

I am just finishing up baking these, and they are very tasty! They have a spicy sweet flavor. I followed the recipe almost to a T, here are the few slight changes I made:
1) I added a dash of dried ground orange peel
2) I didn't have any cloves, and don't really enjoy their flavor, so I replaced them with nutmeg
3)I used butter rather than margarine
4) I didn't roll them in sugar

The flavor of these is very nice, not too sweet not too spicy. They are very festive for fall/winter and will go great with some apple cider! The only thing that was bad about this cookie was how hard to handle the dough is. I put it in the freezer for about 30min and it was still very very sticky and hard to work with. I had to flour my hands between every cookie ball. I also found it unnecessary to press the cookie balls down because they spread a lot while cooking. Next time I make this I may add a pinch more baking soda so that they don't end up so flat.

These cookies are really good. I thought they were a little sweet so next time I will either omit rolling them in the sugar or just cut back the amount of sugar added to the cookie dough to 3/4 cup. I made the cookies a little bit smaller and got 36 from the recipe instead of the 24. Mine spread out a little more than was shown in the photos and were a little crisp on the outside but still soft on the inside. They were still delious and this did not lessen their appeal in my opinion. I live in Colorado so the altitude was probably a factor.

Great recipe! Cookies are moist and chewy. First time I used fancy molasses and the cookies weren't very dark at all.  Made them again with cooking molasses and the colour was better.  Flatten only slightly as indicated.  This has become a favourite!

LOVE these!  ***update: this year I made a bunch of cookie dough and froze it in advance of the holidays then thawed out the dough and baked everything.  Maybe it was a fluke but this is the only dough that did not work for me after being frozen.  The cookies would just NOT cook inside.  The outsides would seem done and I'd cook them for way longer then necessary and they still would be raw inside.  So, it may just be that this dough does not freeze well.

This cookie received so many great reviews for a reason--it's delicious! This is now my only gingerbread cookie recipe. Can't wait to add it to my Christmas cookie bunch. Just the right amount of spice and sweetness! I didn't roll them in sugar per other reviews.  They aren't really big, just average size . Thanks!!

Fabulous recipe!  I took the advice from others and substituted orange juice in place of water and put the mix in the fridge for a half an hour for easy handling.  The OJ had a subtle flavor and surprisingly brought out the ginger.  Very easy!  I will make this again.

These are wonderful! It was a real challenge to resist eating the batter before I baked the cookies, and after baking, the wait was well worth it. The only change I would make is to add a little bit more ginger for even more ping. I didn't even have to flatten these; they were so moist! Yummy!

I made these and the tasted great. But I couldn't get them off the cookie sheet. In fact the dough was like soft peanut butter. I couldn't roll them in sugar like I like. I don't know what I may have done wrong. I followed it exactly.

WOW!!!!! These are drop to your knees and cry for your mama cookies!! I can find nothing wrong with these cookies except that the recipe calls for margerine. They are easy to make, they look presentable, and their chewy!!! YAY! I've been looking for a good chewy cookie recipe for a long time. If you don't have any molasses(I didn't have any) you can use honey, and it still is chewy and tastes lovely. Not as strong a taste as molasses,of course but great. Also subtitute the margerine with butter.

Amazing!!!  I added the OJ as suggested (as well as water) and found a nice way to avoid the stickiness of the dough....  put about a 1/4 cup of sugar in a bowl and drop a spoonful of cookie dough in, use spoon to cover dough with sugar and lightly form it into a ball.  No more mess!  

Great recipe--- thanks so much, it received rave reviews!

I feel like I'm rating a different recipe than you all... My dough was regular old dough consistency - not super soft. The flavor of these cookies is awesome (although I did use OJ and added some black pepper as suggested by a couple of reviewers). These are good. Thanks!

Delicious! A few tips: I added a teeny bit more baking soda to the second batch because the first ones flattened out too much when they cooled.  Just like the ginger molasses cookies at starbucks.  I made mine quite large, but one batch only made 11 cookies.

excellent.  I used butter for margarine, fresh mandarin juice for water, and fresh grated ginger for ground dried ginger.  Then I doubled the recipe.  I baked half the dough tonight and am letting the other half rest for fresh cookies tomorrow.  

The neighbors who shared these with me tonight suggested I quit my day job!  The butter flavour comes through nicely.


EDIT!

I am still making this recipe, and have some suggestions:

If the cookies are not soft and 'fluffy' enough, let the dough rest over night in the fridge, and don't let it warm up too much before it gets to the oven.  

if you like it 'gingery' add a half a table spoon of freshly grated ginger root and a half teaspoon of cardamom

use dark molassas if you like it a bit more...molassassy??  

I have not found any problem with them flattening out, as others have described... perhaps it is the butter?

again, excellent recipe

Everyone loved this!! I didn't have an orange but I squeezed aboutn 2 tbsp of a mandarine orange to bring out the ginger flavor and actually grated about 3 tbsp of fresh ginger - FABULOUS!! The flavor was consistent in ever bite of the cookie! Sprinkled sugar over the cookies right before placing them on the cooling rack after about 5 minutes of cooling down.

These cookies were fabulous and are already on the short list of cookies we will make for next Christmas.  I don't have a sifter, so I whisked the dry ingredients together.  I mention this because the batter was easy to work with; no sticky batter like some reviewers mentionned.  I too replaced the water with fresh squeezed orange juice.  I used 1.5 tablespoons of batter for each cookie and ended up with exactly 24 cookies.  I baked for 12 minutes and ended up with beautiful, perfect, truly great cookies.

Wonderful recipe! Cookies turned out great. Nice and soft. My 3 year old daughter loved to help roll the dough in sugar. Thanks so much.

These cookies are FANTASTIC!!  The best ginger cookies I've had.
The only thing that I changed, was I chilled the dough for about 20-30 minutes in the fridge before rolling into balls, and did not bother with the sugar coating, and they came out PERFECT!

I love ginger snaps, so this recipe was right up my alley.  In order to avoid the sticky dough situation, I used my medium sized cookie scoop and dropped them directly into the sugar and then took them out.  Mess avoided.  
Great cookies!

These cookies are great.  I made them a little healthier with the following changes:  2/3 cups oil instead of 3/4 cup butter, 1/2 half whole wheat flour instead of all white and brown sugar instead of white except for rolling the cookies.

Wonderful recipe!  I took the advice of others and used OJ instead of water.  Subtle flavor, but very yummy.  I did have to add about 1/4 - 1/2 c. additional flour.

I made these last night using the OJ. There are so delicious! My sister is a hard food critic and she loved them. My dad's favorite cookie is gingersnaps and he ate about six. Will make again!

These were good, not fantastic, but still good. I used slightly heaping cups when I measured the flour and didn't have any problems with stickiness. I used the orange juice as was recommended and baked them for exactly 8 min. The texture was perfect, but for us ginger lovers, there isn't nearly enough ginger in these, I felt I could hardly taste it. The sweetness won out over the spice.

Wow. I was slightly doubtful these would turn out as good as people were saying, but they were spectacular. I used the OJ as someone suggested. And let the batter chill in the fridge for a while. Made it a lot easier to handle. Definitely getting added to my good cookie recipe box.

I made these cookies the other morning and they were gone by the end of the day.  I made them exactly as per the recipe and didn't have any problems with sticking.  I usually prefer cookies with chocolate in the ingredient list :) but these will be right up there with my favourites!  Kids loved the chewiness.

this is an amazing recipe!

i took the advice of other reviewers and substituted orange juice in for the water and I sprayed cooking spray on my hands which really helped roll the dough into balls.  also, i sprinkled the cookies with powdered sugar .. they looked and tasted great!

As others have mentioned, this recipe is pretty fool proof.  It's got just the right amount of spice and sweetness.  I have made this twice as directed and just today made a lower fat version.  I substituted the margarine with Smart Balance shortening and used 2 egg whites in place of the egg.  These turned out great, too.

Delicious, but they need a little extra ginger.  Chopped candied ginger is a nice addition.

I love this recipe!  I had been making it for Christmas every year as one of the cookies I give to my neighbors, but my husband insists that I make this for him at least once per month. 

I would suggest putting the batter in the fridge for a bit to make it a littte easier to work with.  I also stopped putting the sugar on top after making the first batch, a bit too much sugar for me.

A huge hit at my holiday party! They were sooo soft and chewy the evening that they came out of the oven. The next day they were dry and crisp (I had them in an airtight container at room temp). I popped them into the freezer for a week before the party in zip lock bags and once they were thawed, they were back to being chewy. Good thing, because I was disappointed at the dryness on the second day. Now I know how to cure it! Overall a very tasty cookie that I will be making many more of! Oh, and I got between 70 and 80 2 inch cookies out of this, without doubling it....

Terrific cookies. I'm not a huge fan of ginger cookies, but I couldn't resist these. Had to be quick though. There was a lot of competition.

Other reviewers have commented about the stickiness of the dough. They are absolutely correct, but it wasn't a problem for me. I guess I expect food preparation to be messy to whatever degree, so I didn't give sticky dough a second thought. 

I wash my hands, roll the dough between my palms, and it makes perfect cookies--I don't mind getting my hands sticky with dough. They can always be washed. This recipe is well worth it!

These are VERY tasty cookies indeed! I do have to agree with many of the other reviews in that it is pretty hard to shape the dough into walnut sized balls when the dough is SO sticky! I just used a couple of spoons to scoop the dough into a small bowl of sugar then, coated and rolled with no problems after that. I guess you could just spoon a “walnut sized ball” right onto the cookie sheet but the sugar adds such a wonderful crispy yummyness. I guess everybody adds their own little twist to a good recipe. The only real change I would make to this great one would be to use O.J. instead of water as some others have said, otherwise, perfecto!!!

Wow, Absolutely amazing!! I Did put in the orange juice and it taste pretty dang good. If you dont want sticky dough make sure that you use somewhat harder butter, but this will also make fluffy cookies. so if you like the flat cookies then use melted butter and just drop amounts of dough into about a half a cup of sugar and roll around

i am not a good baker. i hate being exact, i hate waiting, and i hate using the right ingredients. i followed the recipe to the best of my attention span, and let me tell you... THIS IS WHAT A SOFT GINGERBREAD COOKIE SHOULD TASTE LIKE! perfect. i added about 2c of extra flour so i could roll it out and use cookie cutters, then i baked and frosted with a combination of confectioners sugar, milk, vanilla, and cinnamon. once the frosting set, i took a bite and i cannot stop eating them! thanks for this recipe, its a keeper!

Yum, this recipe is real good.  I made it yesterday, my daughter love it and my husband like it.  My little one said that the cookie tasted like pumpkin pie; the are real soft.  But I change the recipe a little, I used 1/2 cup more of flour, 1/4 tbsp. of cloves because the spice is to strong for my taste.  The change that I made the changes because I live in Puerto Rico that is real hot.  The change didn't change the consistency of the cookie, it still stick.  I used squeeze orange juice.  Thank you, for this recipe I will keep for a long time and keep doing it for my family.

I thought this was a very good ginger cookie.  I followed some of the advice from the other reviewers and added the orange juice...good...and added more spice...bad, too strong.  Next time I will just keep the spice level as it calls for in the original recipe.

These do have a really good taste but mine didn't look right. I am normally pretty exact with measurements so I am not sure what happened but they went from balls to puffy cake like cookies. Maybe I should have pressed them down before baking. They do taste good but not one of the best I've made..

These cookies are absolutely fantastic.  I followed the recipe exactly and they are a new household favorite.  They do flatten out quite a bit, but still stay chewy.

The reason i love this website! I would not have made this if not for the reviews and they turned out to be my favorite of all the cookies i made for Christmas so far (and i've made a bunch!)
I used butter instead of margarine and loved the result. Also, they do spread quite a bit more on the pan than i thought they would so be prepared for that. Love these!

PERFECT!!! My husband has never been much of a ginger cookie fan, but he ate these before they were even cooled! I had to make more before I even got any! SO soft and chewy! I coat mine with Baker's sugar-the finer grain-and they're great! I now keep the container full. These definitely beat out the big, soft store-bought varieties! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Excellent recipe. Very easy to prepare, although refrigerating the dough does help to firm it up a little if you have a problem with getting your hands dirty.

I added half a teaspoon of nutmeg and did not add orange juice. The blend of flavors was very balanced, and I preferred the almost pumpkin taste of these cookies.

I have tried making several different types of gingerbread type cookies and they usually don't turn out.  These cookies however were AMAZING.  They came out soft and chewy and very good.  My husband even raved about them and ended up eating a bunch.  I am making another batch today!

I made these cookies last night with my mom. It was my first time making them and they are my first bactch of christmas cookies for the year. These cookies are great! I followed the recipe exactly and I wouldn't change a thing. These cookies are soft and spicy--the perfect, easy Christmas cookie. I know I will be making these for years to come, 

Tip: Use a cookie scoop if you find the dough a bit soft--no refrigeration required. Also--these took 11 min. in my electric oven.

What they say is true: these cookies are fantastic. I worried the dough was so sticky I'd done something wrong but they came out great. Because they were so sticky the cookies needed a lot more than two tablespoons of sugar to roll around in - I filled a bowl with sugar, then jiggled the dough ball around to cover it. Fantastic recipe -thank you!

This is the #1 Ginger Cookie.  A finishing touch is to frost them with a  Cream Cheese frosting, and then put a square off of a Hershey's candy bar in the middle.  YUMMM.

Cant stop eating these wonderful cookies. Baked them this afternoon, got 46 walnut sized before baking. If I stayed out of the cookie dough I am sure I would have gotten 48 cookies. Hubby and I both think these are great cookies. I had to use Crisco Butter Flavor shortening instead of butter. I added 1 tsp Cinnamon.Note to all: I sifted the 2 1/4 cups flour before I measured it out for the recipe, then added the remaining dry spices etc. I rolled them in Turbinado Sugar,(a light brown sugar noticeably coarse. The dough was soft and with my Pampered Chef small cookie scoop the dough was just fine. I scooped and dropped into the sugar,(about 1/2 cup) rolled slightly with my fingers and lifted them to the airbake cookie sheet. 20 dough balls fit onto a sheet with just enough room to spread.They spread to about a 3" cookie. Exactly 10 min cooking for my convection oven. Perfect. Mine flattened out all on there own, and are crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside, and cracked tops....a very perfect cookie.

When I was a little girl I loved to go by the bakery and smell the Gingerbread Man cookies. Whenever I smell them, I feel warm inside and think of Christmas. My favorite holiday! I have been searching for years for a recipe like this. I made these wonderful, chewy cookies and they lasted for days!My family loved them. We had them with Cinnamon Cider and it was most enjoyable. I didn't change a thing on this recipe. They are very gooey! I just scooped the batter up in a teaspoon and then sprinkled sugar all over it. I have never tasted a cookie as good as this one. Thank you for sharing such an amazing recipe.

I really liked these cookies, they cooked in the time stated and came off the cookie sheet just fine.  I did not chill the dough and had no problem rolling them.  The only thing I changed was to use butter instead of margarine and I used apple cider instead of water.  Next time I will add more ginger.  But they are a keeper.

These are great! I used butter and chilled the dough before rolling into balls. I ended up with twice the number of cookies, so I must have made them smaller than suggested. I will definately make these again.

these cookies passed my grandchildren's test with excellence.  I make them over and over for them.  I can't keep the cookie jar filled enough for them when they visit.  I also use Splenda rather than the sugar and they come out beautifully.

This is a great recipe. I agree with others; definitely chill the dough. I chilled it for an hour and made half of the cookies. They didn't turn out very well. I chilled the rest of the dough overnight and the ones I made then turned out alot better. I don't know if the chilling has anything to do with it, but just a thought... And you barely need to flatten them at all. The flavor of these cookies is great; it is almost TOO spicy but good!

To quote my husband: "Those are so addictive!"  This is a very simple recipe that makes deceptively good cookies. My only suggestion is to refrigerate the dough to make rolling it into balls easier. Also, we didn't want to use margarine, so we substituted a half-cup of butter and a quarter-cup of Smart Balance transfat-free shortening.

These are AMAZING!  I used all whole wheat flour and they are amazing!  I do believe this recipe will become a family staple for the holidays.  I really like the instructions to make them the size of walnuts.  They turn out the perfect size for kids.  It made 3 and a half dozen.

Mmm spicy!  I had to use brown sugar because I didn't have enough white for inside the dough.  I used 1/2 cup packed.  When I put them on the cookie sheet, I didn't press them down, so when they came out, they were like little wee balls.  They're really cute and very spicy!  Great flavour.

WOW-I USUALLY DON'T LIKE GINGER COOKIES BUT I TRIED THIS RECIPE FOR FUN AND THEY DID NOT LAST 15 MINUTES!  THEY ARE SOFT AND CHEWY AND EASY TO MAKE.  I MADE THE DOUGH BEFORE WORK AND WRAPPED IT IN WAXED PAPER IN THE FRIDGE THEN WHEN I GOT HOME I SLICED THEM AND ROLLED IN SUGAR B4 BAKING-WORKED GREAT WITHOUT THE STICKY MESS!!!1

These were REALLY good and soft but kind of lacked a kick- I doubled the ginger and they still kind of needed more. Next time I'll triple the ginger.

I used unsalted butter and a little extra spices - even a dash of ground black peppercorns. I also just dropped them by rounded spoonfuls and sprinkled the sugar right after I pulled them out of the oven. It made 25 and took more like 12-14 minutes. They look prettier if you flatten them a little bit. Thanks! The best ever!

I only had brown sugar, so I used that instead of white...they were still very tasty, but the look of the cookies almost distracts from how good they actually taste. They rose into big cookies, but as they cooled they went completely flat. Still tasted great though!

I expected this fluffy, fabulous cookie. Instead, I ended up with a flat, underbaked mess. The picture that shows what these cookies are supposed to look like has GOT to be for a different recipe. It is certainly not for this one! The only reason I didn't rate it any lower was because the flavor was really good.  I can't believe I wasted the last of my ginger and sugar on this recipe.

When I was a little girl my grandma used to make ginger cookies and they were always my favorite. I am so glad I finally found a cookie that compared to hers..these are absolutely delicious! I have made these twice now and everyone loved them. Once I rolled them in sugar I placed them on the cookie sheet and used a cup to flatten them out nice and evenly. I used orange juice instead of the water and baked them for 10 minutes on an air bake cookie sheet. Perfect every time!!

So yummy.  I didn't have clove so couldn't use it.  I added a 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and doubled the cinnamon and ginger as another person recommended.  I shared these cookies and everyone who tasted it loved it.

I made the recipe as presented, but the dough was so sticky that I added an additional 1/4 c. flour and refridgerated for about an hour. These needed the full 10 minutes (perhaps because the dough was chilled).

Good cookie, but I will add another t. of ginger and a shake more of clove to the recipe to increase the kick. After I made these, I saw the suggestion of replacing the water witg a liqueur and will def try that too.

When I made these cookies I expected flavour out of this world. These cookies did not live up to my expectations. I baked them as long as they said to be baked and at the right temperature, but these cookies tasted soft, but underbaked. I think these cookies are a dissapointment.

Yum! I loved these cookies! I added 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper for an extra kick, and will probably add another tsp of ginger the next time I make them. Really nice, soft,spicy cookie!

Thanks for the great cookie recipe Amy!  My only changes were I used all butter and added one more egg, but left the water out.  These are excellent and shipped great via the mail.

This recipe is the one I've been hunting for for years. It makes tasty, soft, delicious ginger bread cookies. The only thing I would suggest is to NOT eat them warm - let them cool and let all the flavours really mesh. Otherwise they taste really stronly of the ginger and molases. Plus, I used more sugar to coat them before going in the oven than suggested here.

These were amazing!!! My boyfriends family love them! I must say that they taste better than the ones at Starbucks. MMMM! I press them down a little bit before baking so that they spread out and make them BIG! People love them! =)

Turned out exactly the way it was meant to. Big, soft, chewy and very yummy. 
Substituted molasses with maple syrup and added 3/4 more flour than what the recipe required. Spooned half gooey dough with little trouble. Spooned the other half of the dough after letting it chill with even less trouble.

Awesome cookies!  Read the reviews for tips because the dough does come out very soft.  I refrigerated it for a while to make it stiffer then dropped into sugar (lots) to coat.

These are amazzzing cookies and my parents really enjoyed them which is rare but I made some adjustments.  Instead of molasses I used the same amount of honey with  1/2 cup of brown sugar instead of white sugar.  I read about the sticky dough problem from other users so I used a lot more flouring and skipped on the sugar covering.  Also because of my adjustments the cookies didn't really flatten out when cooking so I had to press down on them a little.  But really enjoyable cookies thanks so much for sharing~definitely one of my favorite recipes now ^^

I tried these with whole wheat flour (all I had on hand), and there is no way you could tell in the finished product. I think the only difference it made to the cookie was that it added an extra bit of texture, which was nice.

Decent recipe overall but I think it has way too much ground cloves in it.  If I make these again I will be reducing the ground cloves by 1/2 or 1/4 the called for amount.

These cookies were very soft and tasted great!  I will probably not make them again because the dough was too gooey to work with.  I had to use a spoon to drop the cookies in the sugar and coat them before attempting to pick them up by hand.

These are great cookies! I didn't find the dough too difficult to work with.  I left out the cloves because I didn't have any, but will try to add this next time.  I would suggest to bake for 9 minutes.  I will definately make these again!

Yum!  The name says it all!  I reduced the marg to 2/3 cup and the ginger to 1 1/2 tsp, upped the cinnamon to 2 tsp and subbed nutmeg for the cloves...all just for personal preference!  Turned out great!

I will never eat boxed ginger cookies again! Super easy and quick to bake and soft and chewy to eat.  Love the combination of ginger and molasses!

These were just what I was looking for.  The only thing I did differently was to roll the cookies in cinnamon and sugar.  I got just about 3 dozen good sized cookies from the recipe.

The dough was really soft and unrollable but I used an ice cream scoop and dunked it in the sugar and then on the cookie sheet (and they flattened out on their own). I was a bit worried by this but they cooked beautifully and didn't last long at all!

This recipe was great. They came out nice and soft and chewy. I used real butter (I figure if you're making cookies from scratch don't cheat). My sister hates molasses and she LOVED these cookies. I baked a batch Monday, its Wednesday and I'm baking another!

These were fantastic.  I tried baking different batches at 8, 9 and 10 minutes and found the best ones a few hours later were baked at 8 minutes.  Very, very good cookies.

this are really good! like them much more the traditional (dry and hard) gingerbreads.

i used my tablespoon (not the  one to eat whit, the one that is used the measure an amount  to baking or cooking)to measure out the doe.  everyone got same size that way.
i hade to use about 5 tablesoones of sugar to role the doeballs in

These turned out very good.  Nice and chewy like I like them.  I found that they took a little extra longer to bake but that could be due the my oven or the size I made the cookies. Will definitely make again.

You CAN roll these, if you add anywhere from 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup extra flour. They are fantastic, a whole troop of Girl Scouts gobbled them.

Soooo good!  I've made them twice- once with margarine, once with butter (and I didn't have quite enough butter) but it turned out great both times.  So delicious.  Even my gingerbread-hating boyfriend said they were "pretty good" which is impressive.  Took them to work and everyone gobbled them up, and gave some to my aunt and she loved them.  Great as a gift!

These are delicious!  I made them a little smaller to make more cookies and they turned out great!  Perfect softness and spice!  I also only cooked for 8 minutes and let "cook" on the cookie sheet for 5 minutes.  I rolled them in sugar with red suger mixed in for a festive look.  I also found that if your hands are barely damp, it is easier to roll.  Will make again!

I found that if you refrigerate the dough for about 30 minutes before baking, it is less sticky.  Also, I prepared the cookies on a silicone baking sheet and a regular baking sheet and the silicone made the softest, most wonderful cookies!

These are the best  ginger cookies I have ever made.  They are not too sweet and they were still soft several days later.  The only problem I had was with the stickness of the dough.  I refrigerated for one hour as recommended by others, but that did not seem to held.  Regardless, this has become one of my new favorite recipes.

These are fantastic. I made a double batch and the few that are left are still soft and yummy after 7 days! They were a fall hit with my friends and family. Thanks!

I really wanted to give this a 5 stars but my problem was with the dough, it was so wet, that it was hard to roll into walnut size balls. We pressed on and didn't add more flour, but it was not very easy. But taste overall is a 5, and my husband who doesn't even like Ginger Cookies, LOVES them!

these cookies are sugar and spice and everything nice!!! a perfect cookie to ring in the autumn season.  i did tweak slightly and added a teaspoon of nutmeg and cloves.  one nice plus to this recipe is that unlike so many gingerbread doughs, this one does not have to be refrigerated before baking.  very very good recipe.

My favourite cookies! I use golden syrup instead of molasses, and prefer brown instead of white sugar as it seems to disolve better. They stay soft, and I think they are sweet enough not to need to be coated in sugar. My mother-in-law can't eat gluten, so I have substituted gluten-free flour in and they still taste great.
For a different flavour - try adding a cup of good quality chocolate drops - ginger choc chip cookies! yum!

I must have done something wrong.  After reading all the review, I thought these would be very good.  They came out gummy and very dense despite cooking them longer than suggested.  The only thing I can figure is that I used butter ILO Margarine but I won't try the recipe again to find out.

Super recipe! These were very quick and very easy to make. They were soft and delicious - my family (including three children) loved them. I did not change a thing in this recipe, although next time I'll double the batch. Thank you!

SOOOO Good! I have a new favorite cookie! They stayed soft until they were all gone- which was just shy of a week. They were perfect- i followed the recipe exactly- rolling them in sugar and flattening them slightly.

You'll definitely want to make 2 batches of this stuff because it goes quickly!

I made this recipe two ways:  I accidently used 1 stick of butter instead of a full 3/4 cups for the first batch. The second batch I followed the recipe exactly. The batch with less butter yielded a slightly more cakelike texture. After an hour of refrigeration, I made half of the dough into rolled balls and used the other half to cut out gingerbread men. Both turned out great. For personal preferences, I had to skip the step of rolling the balls into sugar, however. I preferred them without it because I didn't like the extra crunch. It wasn't real crunchy, but it was enough to seem weird to me for some reason. The cookies didn't need the extra sweetness either.

Other notes: I pressed the cookies down to 1/4" thick, and returned the dough to the refrigerator until I was ready to make another batch for the oven. The process went simply!

I had to add an additional cup of flour to get the dough firm enough to roll into balls. They were delicious and still remained soft and chewy.

These are absolutely fantastic! Highly recommend a double batch! I put the dough in the fridge for about 30min to help make it less sticky to work with. They are just as advertised...big & soft. Thank you for posting this recipe online!!

These are great!!  I have been making these for a few years now and think its a near flawless recipe.  I would suggest using butter instead of margarine to make the dough a little less sticky (just make sure not to use melted butter).  I also think the butter compliments the flavor of the cookie.  I cut the amount of ginger slightly using only 1 1/2 tsp. I also do not flatten the cookie at all and they still turn out perfectly!

A must try!  I agree to dbl the batch.  They are addictive. Very good.  I put oven rack second from bottom.  I think this helps keep the cookies from getting too flat, need to be "set" with the closer heat source.  They can flatten some when cooling.  BUT this does not in anyway take from the FLAVOR! 5*

These are positively the best ginger cookies I've ever had.  Though to be fair, I've not tried all that many.  I made these and gave some to my grandmother, who was almost offended that they tasted better than hers.  (She's a superb baker and bakes things for the entire extended family..)  They do indeed stay soft, which I love.  I hate crispy cookies, so this was a big bonus for me.  The only alteration I've ever made has been to add more ginger, and that's only when I have no cloves.  Excellent cookies!

I made these last year for Christmas and my mom wanted them made again for her birthday in May in lieu of a gift.  The were loved by many and disappeared quickly!  I plan to make them again for my b'day this weekend.  I will try them this time without flattening the cookies as others have suggested.

This is an awesome recipe for ginger molasses cookies.  I'm not a fan of making huge ones (mostly because I can never get the center done before the outsides start to burn), but this recipe works wonderfully for smaller gingersnaps.  Everyone who has tasted them has loved them and asked for more.  Since first trying this recipe two months ago I've made them six times.  Definitely a recipe worth making. :)

My family, my neighbors, and everyone I have ever given these cookies to thinks that they are the tops!! They are a staple around our house because ginger aids in digestion. I double all of the spices (without doubling the recipe) and also add 2 tablespoons of grated (real) ginger in addition to the dry ginger. They are the greatest!! My kids won't stop eatting them and we have to make them at least twice a week!!

These cookies are so good!  I used butter instead of margarine.  I also made a lemon frosting to go on top made of 2T butter, 2 oz. cream cheese, 2/3 C. powdered sugar and 1/4 t. lemon extract.  I stored these in the fridge and gave out as many of these I could part with (which weren't many because I loved them so much).

My first time making gingerbread cookies and they turned out wonderful!  And they were so easy to make!  I substituted 1/2 cup of butter for the margerine and let the dough sit in the refrigerator for a couple of hours (like some folks here suggested).  I didn't have any trouble with the dough sticking to my hands.  I will definitely make these again!

Added 12/17/07: I have been making these for about 4 or 5 years and I have to say that I'm not too thrilled with them this year...they were too puffy and cakey and not chewy enough.  I can only conclude that I did't pull them out early enough...?  I've made these a few times and they are perfect every time.  Don't forget to squish 'em!  I'm probably the only one who forgets to do it, but it IS necessary as they don't spread very much.  I go exactly by the recipe and wouldn't change a thing.

These cookies are awesome.  Ive made them twice and they have been consistent.  My family loves them.  The only thing i would change, would be a teeny bit less ginger, and a teeny more cinnamon.  Otherwise, theyre great! I definately reccomend them!

I'm a huge gingerbread cookie fan, but I don't like crispy cookies, so this recipe was a real find.  I made these last Christmas and my husbad said they were the finest homemade cookies he's ever had.  These cookies bake up soft and flavorful.  One of my very favorite cookies.

The taste IS excellent.  I was able to roll them into perfect balls by chilling them in the freezer a few hours before dropping them in a ziplock filled with sugar and shaking.  HOWEVER, despite the taste, they take a long time to make and they are VERY difficult to judge when they're done (the first batch burned the bottoms slightly and so I took them out earlier the next time to find them still soft in the middle.  Hard to find a happy medium.  Fortunately I was able to cut off the bottoms with nary a blemish so they still look as good as they taste.  But for those reasons I only give them four stars..

This is my new favorite cookie recipe. It is delicious! People that say they don't like ginger cookies gobble these up, even in the middle of summer rather than winter when this type of cookie is usually made. These are absolutely perfect.

Great recipe!  Thanks for submitting.  I was looking for ginger recipes to help w/ morning sickness and this one worked well.  High altitude bakers will need to adjust flour and soda.  These are very soft.

I love these cookies.

My family, however, thought they were a bit rich, I would suggest using half the ginger and cloves if you like your flavors in the cookies more subtle :)

These cookies were absolutely delicious.  They prep time was a little longer thatn 15 min, but they were worth it.  I love how they stayed soft for days after (not that there were many left).

These were the easiest and most delicious gingerbread cookies ever.  So soft...I love soft cookies and the fact I did not have to roll out the dough and use those annoying cookie cutters was the best part.  My dough was super sticky so I did not roll the cookies in my hand.  I used a cookie scoop and they came out just fine!

These are the first gingerbread cookies I have made, and they were very good.  They have a hint of spiciness too them.  My only complaint is the dough was pretty gooey, and I was not able to make a gingerbread man using a cookie cutter.

These are some great holiday cookies!  I mixed up the batter and decided that it looked a little plain, so I added one cup of raisins.  They came out moist and soft and the whole house smelled like they holidays.

These cookies were wonderful! Very easy to make. I used more sugar to roll the uncooked dough in but it did not effect the taste. The only issue that I had was due to the color of the dough, it was not easy to see if the cookies were fully cooked. As a result, some were uncooked in the center. They tasted GREAT however and my guests loved the ones that I served (the ones that were fully cooked).

I just finished making them.  They are great!  It was hard, though for me to get the bottom ones in the oven to come out the same as the top ones so next time I'll just do one batch at a time.  Also, I didn't find it hard to manage at all.  I used a cookie scoop and put them directly into a bowl of sugar.  Rolled them around, flattened them a little then placed them on the cookie sheet.  Then I sprinkled them with sugar again after they came out.  Yum Yum!

These are GREAT!  I can't make them fast enough.  I really enjoy these soft cookies. A nice change over the normal hard gingerbread cookies.  I did refridgerate the dough for about 1/2 hour, and sprayed my hands with non-stick pan spray to keep the dough from sticking.Thanks for a great recipe.

This was the first time I tried ginger cookies.
My kids loved them. I had to add more flour to be able to handle them ,but they turned out fine. Maybe I did something wrong. I'll will be making them again! So that's what the kids tell me! Ha Ha

Very good.  Kinda between a molasses cookie and a gingersnap.  The whole family loved them and they were quite easy to make.

I'm not a gingerbread person; I only tried this to add a traditional holiday cookie to my Christmas baskets. I wasn't even planning on trying one. Well, I'm sad to say that I did...and now I'm about five cookies short! They are absolutely delicious! The molasses keeps them very moist and soft. They are scrumptious! Thanks for the recipe.

I wish I could give this recipe more stars.  I couldn't believe how soft and chewy these were.  We even enjoyed the ones that got a little "Overcooked".

My eldest daughter and I didn't care for these. Much too soft and slightly greasy. The cookies were also too gingery, but then again, we're not very big on ginger. Mainly made the cookies for an older neighbor who loves almost anything with ginger. She *adored* these cookies. If I make these cookies again, I'd add an extra 1-2 Tbs. of flour.

Finding a good "soft cookie" recipe is difficult.  These were absolutely delicious!  They didn't last long enough to see if they stayed soft in storage.  We had guests when I was making them and the kids and adults gobbled them up!  I had to make a second batch.  I did chill them a bit for easier handling.  You can also dust your hands with powdered sugar so the dough doesn't stick.  ENJOY!

These taste delicious! Based on other people's reviews and my personal taste, I made the below changes:
- Sub OJ for water
- Sub brown sugar for white
- Changed spices to 1tsp of cinnamon and nutmeg. Kept the ginger at 2tsp
- put the dough in the fridge for a few hours
- Rolled in cinnamon sugar
Needed to bake for the full 10 mins to make sure the cookie was fully cooked. So Yum!

Very yummy cookie. I made them a few times and found that you really have to squish them down, they don’t expand or flatten by themselves so what ever shape you put them in they will stay in. I also suggest undercooking them a bit so they stay a little softer.

Ok so these cookies smell and taste amazing. However, I had several issues with them. I followed others’ advice and flattened the cookies, and they came out paper thin. Then I baked another batch and only flattened them a little, and they look exactly like the first batch, paper thin. So for the third batch I’ve made, I substituted butter flavored shortening for the butter,and I did not flatten these at all and they finally resemble normal cookies. Not sure if anyone else has had this problem. All batches tasted great but the third batch with shortening are much more aesthetically pleasing :)

Followed the recipe exactly and don’t see any reason to change a thing!  They’re delicious and the texture is perfect. I had no trouble with dough balls keeping their shape while rolling in sugar as I saw mentioned in another review. Just stir flour in to the liquid mixture by hand with a spoon... Over-stirring or using an electric mixer might result in dough being too difficult to work with.

Excellent Cookie!  Not too sweet, and a nice warm spice  that stays on the tongue.  The smell brought my husband to the kitchen, and after one bite, he grabbed a handful of cookies and a glass of milk before he left.  I read the other reviews and opted to use brown sugar instead of white, orange juice instead of water, and chilled the dough for about an hour before attempting to roll them.  Rolling the balls in sugar before baking helped to flatten the dough without sticking.  I plan to add raisins next time!

I added the flour to the sugar mixture a little at a time and stirred it in each time by hand starting with a whisk and then switching to a wooden spoon when the dough got a little thicker.  This made the dough very easy to work with and not too sticky.  The stickiest parts were those that had stuck to the bowl.  Also, I replaced the margarine with butter.  They came out very good and are delicious.

I've been making these for  a couple of years now. We prefer spicier, moister and fuller-flavoured cookies, so I replace 1/2 of the white sugar with Demerara sugar, increase molasses to 1/3 cup, cloves to 1 tsp, cinnamon to 2 tsp and ginger to 3 tsp and increase the size of each cookie. My family loves making these larger soft cookies into ice cream sandwiches by 'squishing' vanilla ice cream between 2 cookies while they are still warm from the oven

I made these on Christmas Eve for “Santa”.My 17 year old ate 6 of these cookies within minutes!!! I took the rest over to our family gathering on Christmas and they were a huge hit...In fact, my grandma called earlier while I was trying out a recipe for chocolate chip cookies, but she insisted she only wants the GINGER cookies

I followed the advice of others and refrigerated the dough before trying to bake. This worked very well. I added some cut up crystallized ginger (maybe 2-3 TBS) for an extra ginger kick.

These were really amazing.  I didn’t have molasses available, but had molasses & brown sugar syrup I really don’t like on pancakes a,d used that with an added Tbsp on dark brown sugar.  It turned out great and now I have a use for that syrup.

I have made these cookies for the past few years and LOVE them.  If you want to make them really spicy add some cayenne pepper. My whole family is hooked on the spiced up version. Crazy I know but super taste with a serious zip

I also used OJ and thought these were pretty incredible! Even my husband who "doesn't like" gingerbread, loved these! Didn't think they needed to be "smashed down" as others suggested, it made cookies too thin.

Made these as written, except subbed butter and they turned out great.  I used light mild flavored molasses.  Update: Just made these again but used my convection setting at 325 and they turned out really flat.  I'll stick to my regular oven setting at 350 from now on for this cookie.

Followed the directions to a T. Got to the rolling part and was left with a big sticky mess that stuck to my hands. Forget shaping it into a ball. Half the batter ends up in the sink because you can't get it off your hands. Don't even think about flattening it with a glass like the recipe says. All the batter sticks to the glass.

Yummy yum yum....though I'm planning on cutting salt next time around.  I use butter with salt in it and with the baking soda and salt it was slightly and I mean slightly more salt than should have been.

I followed the instructions except I used 1 Tbs orange juice instead of water and I used butter instead of margarine.  They definitelyare what the name says, they make "big, soft cookies" not crunchy ginger snaps.  I creamed for about 3 minutes with my handmixer and used 3/4 cups sugar and 1/4 brown sugar.  They puffed up quite a bit, in a beautiful chocolate chip cookie type way.    I would definitely follow the advice of other reviewers and chill the dough before rolling them.  I tried not chilling the dough and it was too sticky.  These were good cookies and simple to make.  I would make them again.  Rating 4 instead of 5 because it was good but wasn't the best cookie of my life or an award winning cookie like some other recipes stated.

These are wonderful!  I followed another reviewers advice and left out the water and they rolled into balls fine. I also forgot to flatten my first tray and that tray looks the best, perfect crinkly cookie.

perfect gingerbread cookies.
i'm a lazy baker, didn't bother creaming the butter, just add all the wet ingredients incl soften butter to dry; and mixed. had lemonade concentrate, used that instead of water.

dropped by small scooper, cooked into perfect little rounds.
so good, with or without glaze.

Very good taste.  They turned out a little too moist so they flattened out quite a bit.  It worked better when I didn't pre-flatten them before cooking.

Delicious and filled with all the spicy warmth of the holidays. I serve plain and drizzled with cream cheese icing. Both are popular.

I just popped these out of the oven!  Yummy!  I followed the recipe exactly.  Very flavorful cookies.  I did not flatten but they did spread and flattened.  My butter was soft and egg room temperature.

I was going to a marching band competition and decided to make some cookies for the dessert at dinner after we competed. I had to double the recipe which worked very very well! Everyone looooved them. My friend’s mom even decided to wrap them up and take them home. She wouldn’t let anyone have them! After making the first doubles batch, I realized I’d need some more. So I decided to make another batch (not doubled) and they were too runny. I used actual margarine that time instead of real butter so I think that is what did it. To fix it, I added more flour and to fix the ratio, more sugar too. If you run into that problem and fix it that way, add more ginger too. My only advice is use REAL better and not margarine. Other than that, they were AMAZING!!!

I took the advise of others and used lemon juice instead of water.  I made sure they refrigerated over night, rolled them in balls, rolled them in sugar and flatten them a bit.  They came out wonderful and delicious.  They will become one of my favorites and will make them again.  Thank you for sharing.  Turned out great

Wanted to make these since Christmas and finally did. The recipe turned out  perfect. For those that said they were burnt or under cooked.The trick is to just touch the outside of the cookie with a spatula and when it start to not give so easily they are done. Will make them again

These are the best cookies ever! They are very soft and delicious. I use butter instead of margarine. My family loves them. Sometimes I make three dozen smaller cookies instead of two dozen, to make them last longer. Either way, they are really good. The first few times I made them, I had trouble with the dough being sticky, and had to let the dough sit a while, but now I don't have a problem with it. I use two spoons to drop a ball of dough into a bowl of sugar, and then roll it around, touching only the part that actually has sugar on it (after the dough touches the sugar it doesn't stick). I would advise baking the cookies for at least ten minutes so they don't end up doughy in the middle. Don't bake them too long, though, or they will get chewy. These cookies are perfect for Christmas, although I make them all through the year.

I made these for a cookie exchange and really enjoyed them.  They don't make the prettiest cookies, but they are a holiday staple.  I don't like my gingerbread cookies to be hard and crispy and I was excited for more of a spice cookie, and that is what these are.  I doubled the recipe and got 7 dozen cookies about an inch and a half in diameter.  I followed the recipe except that I used real butter, I did get a crispy outside with a soft inside, not sure what the texture change would be with margarine.  I didn't chill the dough, and my cookies were somewhat tacky when I was rolling them into balls but l and was able to roll a dozen cookies in less than the 4 minutes I had between trays in and out of the oven and so I don't think chilling is completely necessary.   I don't know why some reviews say they're gooey?  Adding colored sugar to the tops would help the appearance on a cookie tray and/or a white chocolate or cream cheese drizzle, but I was in a hurry.  I found it difficult to figure out when the cookies were done since they're already golden, I  don't bake a lot of cookies so I probably need to perfect the timing still.

I just made these and followed the recipe to a T.  They taste great and they're soft and chewy.  The only problem I encountered was that the first batch turned out too flat.  I lightly flattened the dough as the recipe instructed.  With the remaining batches, I didn't flatten the dough.  They flattened out slightly in the oven and turned out like the ones in the picture.

These cookies are the perfect fall cookie.  Every time I make these, people go crazy.  My husband likes things that have more flavor and so I use heaping measures of all of the spices.  I've also tried adding in just a smidge more molasses.  It makes the cookies softer but does up the flavor a bit.

This has been my go-to cookie recipe for some time now - one of the few things I've ever baked that ALL three of my kids will eat - A miracle!!! The cookie dough was a bit awkward to handle initially.  I also found that timing needed to be quite precise - baking for a minute above or below the correct time would leave me with ether too crispy or too soggy a cookie.  Having made them so many times now though, I have settled into a system I'm happy with and which seems to turn out cookies just like those in the picture:  

1) I pre-heat the oven to the stated temperature then prepare the cookie dough exactly as set out in the recipe - though a little extra spice sometimes makes its way into the mix. 
2)  As suggested by others, once ready I place the dough in the refrigerator to firm up.
3)  Before committing a whole tray of dough balls to the oven I do a test bake with a single one to fine-tune my timings.  The ball itself I form by scooping out 1 Tablespoon of the dough, gently rolling it into a ball with my hands then placing it on the baking tray.  I don't flatten the ball, and sprinkle sugar over it before placing the tray in the oven.  I set my timer and immediately break open the cookie once done to see how the inside  looks.  It gets gobbled down regardless and I adjust my cooking time based on how over-under cooked it appeared.  Only then do I commit to putting whole trays of cookie dough in the oven – all prepared the same way as above.    

In the past I tried playin

These are amazing! The only changes I made was I added an extra 8th of a cup of flour and i baked them 11 mins instead of 8-10. This is my fave ginger cookie recipe. Every time Ive made them they are gone before morning :)

Made these for someone undergoing a bone marrow transplant that was sick from chemo.  These stayed fresh and soft in the refrigerator and after being frozen.  This was one of a very short list of items that she could hold down. I think the ginger helped the nausea and being a delicious cookie helped spark her appetite. She's home now and asking for another batch :-)

An absolute favorite for YEARS. LOVE them. I follow the recipe. I do add extra spice (cloves & cinnamon) to suit my tastes. Depending on the dough, I refrigerate before rolling. It is messy, no way to avoid that. I am happy to make the mess & have sticky hands - the cookies are just too good. If you want to get real over-the-top, make small cookies & serve with a cranberry orange cheeseball - holy goodness. Great for gift-giving.

I did a take on honey ginger cookies.. I follow d the recipie added a bit more ginger to the flour mixture and substituted molasses with about a teaspoon or so of brown sugar mixed in with 1/4 cup of honey. The sugar mixture rolled in at the end had a teaspoon of ginger as well. It was the best cookies I've made.

Instead of margarine, I used butter-flavored Crisco shortening (I find the sticks very convenient -- no messy measuring cups).  The dough was a nice consistency for rolling into balls. I will definitely make these again - my family loved the soft, chewy texture.

I substituted to make this recipe vegan. I used coconut oil instead of margarine and EnerG egg replacer. I also substituted honey for the white sugar (except the sugar in which you roll the cookie).  I had to add 1/2 cup flour to compensate for extra liquid. They were soft and gingery but not quite sweet enough.

These cookies were very soft and chewy. They also came out bigger than I expected. But overall the ginger flavor was so yummy. I made these during the Christmas holiday as gifts and everyone loved them. I am definitely making these again. Thanks!

AMAZING! I made these cookies a couple days  ago. My boyfriend came over and insisted he didn't like ginger cookies. I convinced him into trying them and he loved them and thinks I should make them again.

Oh wow, fabulous, just fabulous!  Love how the molasses flavor comes through, thinking next time I'll roll in raw sugar instead of "white" sugar.

Followed the recipe and the dough was too soft added extra flour, refrigerated, still no luck... baked them and they turned out like little flavorless hocky pucks. Cannot taste any spice or molasis...

Panic struck with 12 hours left before employee association bake sale - 45 minutes later, panic has moved on because I am sure these cookies will sell just fine. Tweaked the recipe a bit using butter, substituted most of the molasses (but not all) with a few teaspoons of brown sugar, and in the oven they went - yum....oh boy, now I'm starting to get a bit uneasy about how I will protect the batch overnight from my better half who is gingerly lurking around in the kitchen.   :)

I have made these a few times.  Try using 2 1/3 cups flour instead of 2 1/4 cups, and a smidgen more baking soda, and you should have no problem rolling the cookies.  It also helped the cookies stay fluffy after baking.  I made smaller cookies (little smaller than walnut) and there turned out perfect!

LOWER CALORIE, LOWER FAT VERSION: I modified this recipe to make it lower fat & lower calorie. Instead of 3/4 cup margarine, I used 1/4 cup vegetable oil and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce. I used 1 cup Truvia in place of 1 cup sugar. I also added an extra egg white to the recipe on top of the one whole egg (thinking it might make it more cake-like). The batter ended up pretty sticky/wet, so I added another 1/4 flour, and I had to spoon the batter onto the cookie sheet. The cookies puffed up nicely and did not flatten out too much. They came out soft and moist, and the applesauce added a nice hint of apples/fall flavor. They came out very sweet, so I might cut back on the applesauce a little next time. Also, with less oil, they left a very thin film under the cookies when I peeled them off, so you may want to lightly grease the sheet, but I was OK with the very thin film of cookie it left behind. I am not a cook, and this was a first attempt in many years at "baked goods", but I'm pleased with the recipe, and will make them again! In an effort to get away from processed foods, I'm thrilled that these were easy, quick, and healthier than store bought!

These cookies were delicious! I wanted to make real gingerbread men and this is what I did to make it work: Placed cookie dough in fridge for 20 minutes (to make easier to work with), after that I put a piece of wax paper onto my working surface, sprinkled generously with flour, placed a portion of cookie dough onto paper and sprinkled generously with flour then place another piece of wax paper on top then I rolled out flat to cut out gingerbread men. I ended up making then very thin, not on purpose, but I loved it. I used the Royal Icing II recipe to decorate these cookies. I am new to cookie cutting and using royal icing - this all took a lot of time but I would do it again because the cookies were a major hit!

Perfect recipe! I followed it to a tee, and everyone loved them. I did not find the dough too sticky as others have mentioned, and I used fancy molasses.  I also forgot to "flatten slightly" and it was no issue at all. Going to add this to my favourites :)

These cookies are absolutely delicious. They have become a favourite in my house.  And have definitely become a must over the holidays. If I only make 1 batch of cookies, these are the priority. So soft and flavourful!

Made these cookies today and thought they would be great after all the great reviews but they were not at all what I thought they would be. I chilled the dough and floured my hands and the cookie dough was way too sticky and goopy to shape into balls. I ended up spooning them onto a pan and just springing sugar on them. They baked okay (although they were incredibly flat), smelled great, and tasted fine. I think that the spices were a little overpowering though. They were okay, but I wouldn't make them again.

A great recipe! I doubled the recipe for an office cookie exchange, and made a few changes (listed below, for the doubled recipe)
1 1/2 tsp fresh ground or grated ginger
An additional egg white
A few tablespoons more flour.
I would have used 2 - 2 1/2 tsp of ginger, and a whole egg extra. The flour is just to balance the extra wet ingredients. The dough is very delicate - I let my dough chill in the fridge for about 45 minutes, but that wasn't enough to chill the whole batch. Two hours is probably enough. 
This probably could be turned into gingerbread mini cupcakes by simply scooping the dough into a room temp pan and baking them.
It's been almost a week since I made them, and they are still soft and melt In your mouth tender. Will make again.

Absolutely delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly, but did follow the advice of other reviewers and refrigerated the dough for an hour.  This came out great - I had to make another batch two days later because they were gone!

Four stars as written with the water, five stars if you swap water for orange juice as other reviewers have suggested. Keep an eye on these while baking because its not as easy to tell when they are done. Overall delicious cookies and a welcome addition to my Christmas cookie platter

These were great and they were actually soft! Instead of 3/4 cup margarine, I did 2 sticks of butter the first time. They flattened out a little bit more that way, which was good because then they got the cracks on the top. I just remade it now with 3/4 cup butter and they aren't quite as flat. I notice the cooking time they suggest is way off though, I'm on 12 minutes now and they still are no where near ready yet. I have a new oven too, so it's not my oven.

five stars!  Next time I will use brown sugar.  Has anyone tried adding choc chips to this?  Molasses and Choc are a favorite combo and am just wondering how the presence of the chips would affect the soft puffiness of the cookie?

Love these, and always double the batch - they won't go to waste!  Couple tips:  1) Instead of "shaping dough into walnut sized balls," use a small ice cream scooper to scoop balls directly into the bowl of sugar - much cleaner that way, and all the cookies turn out the same  size.  Yummy!!  2) I never use the prescribed 2 T of sugar for rolling the balls....I just put about 1/2-1 cup of sugar in a bowl and roll away...then toss the remaining sugar.  Having a little more makes that part go a little faster/easier.  3) Finally, if your molasses is running low (I used up the last of ours), put the bottle in the microwave for 10-20 seconds and the remaining amount stuck to the bottom will pour our more easily.  Also...use the tip by other reviewer - spray your measuring cup with cooking spray before measuring the molasses into your cookie dough mix...makes it MUCH easier to get it all out.

I love these.  They've become my "signature" cookie at all the Christmas events.  I follow the recipe exactly, except for flattening - I just leave them in a ball and they bake to a perfect puffy shape.

If you want the darker brown cracked top look, you need to substitute dark brown sugar for the white in the cookie dough. Still roll in white sugar. I always use the small cookie scoop and bake on parchment. 9 minutes is perfect in my oven. 

p.s. I reduce the flour by 1/4 cup and omit the water altogether. I also add 1/2 cup small pieces candied ginger.

This is the best ginger cookie recipe.  I used orange juice instead of water like some others and it made this cookie great.  It was a big hit and my teenage daughter(who doesn't like anything mind you)is asking for more and to put this on my normal cookie rotation! Delish! :-)

Delicious.  I needed a lot more sugar to roll the cookies in.  My fingers got very sticky from the dough so I used flour to help make my fingers less sticky.

Made these for the first time last week with my 2 year old daughter. Had to make a few changes, I didn't have margarine on hand so switch out for unsalted butter. Also did not have molasses, where I live it's not possible to source, so changed out for brown sugar instead of white, and substituted maple syrup. I was a bit worried that it would turn out too sweet, but they came out fantastic! Soft and chewy, with just a touch of crispness on the edges. Tasted just like Christmas, but I think I will start making them year round.

Delicious! I read a lot of reviews and doubled the recipe! I used plain Greek yogurt for half the butter,added 1/4 tsp fresh squeezed OJ and 1/4 tsp apricot brandy! I increased the baking soda to 1 1/2 tsp. per a review and used 1/2 tsp cloves & 1/2 tsp. allspice. 
This is a delicious recipe and I enjoyed making it even more delicious!

These are not only the best cookies I have ever made, but they might even be the best cookie I have ever had. I did substitute butter for margarine and orange juice for water. I am about to make another batch since I don't think the ones I just made will last until our holiday party tomorrow.

Gluten free. Substituted gluten free flour for wheat ( added an extra 3 tbs or so until soft dough consistency).  I also replaced margarine with coconut oil. The result is wonderful ! I have made those several times. They are the grand kids favorites. This week we will roll to make valentines cookies. - this time added about 1/4 tsp xanthan gum to flour.

We did three batches at once... I think I would recommend doing one or maybe two, batch at a time to give you a little time in between batches unless you have an assembly line going, lol! But we did okay and most of them turned out great! I also recommend NOT smoothing them down too far once they are on the cookie sheet. Leave them a little plump so they will be a little thicker. And err on the side of smaller if you're going to err at all... The bigger the ball, the flatter cookie, or so it seemed with ours. All in all, though, we had a good first run!

Just baked these today.  As suggested I substituted OJ for the water.  Nice spice flavor.  My cookies are flat, but for some reason all of my cookies are always flat.  However these are soft centers with just the right amount of crisp edges.  Will make again.  I used a scoop and had no problems with the batter.

The reason I give 4 stats is because although these are definitely tender, spicy and delicious - they just didn't come out like the picture (dark brown and crackled)  which was half of the reason I wanted to try the recipe. 
I will definitely make these again - I sprinkled extra sugar on the after rolling and flattening, they cam out nice and sparkly. Also, I didn't chill before rolling and had no problems, I used a small cookie scoop and scooped them directly into the sugar with ease. 
Although if anyone has tips to why the picture is dark and crackled and and most of the others aren't - id love to know lol

I went to Tim Horton's almost everyday because I was addicted to these cookies so I figured I should try to make them at home. I found this recipe and it was so easy and the cookies turned out amazing!!! The cookies are so addicting and everyone complimented me on how delicious they were. I am now going to make them for Christmas.

This is the best ginger cookie! The flavor is great! I added slightly more of the amount of spices, but the recipe is perfect as written.

As written, I can only give this recipe 3 stars because the dough is simply too sticky to form into balls, let alone roll in sugar.  I had to add almost another 3/4 c of flour to get the dough sticky enough to hold any kind of shape. The flavor, though, is fantastic and they were still plenty soft, not too dry. The next time I make them, I'll try refrigerating as others have suggested.

Delicious!  Made these cookies two years in a row.  Thought that the amount of ginger was too much, but once it's cooked - it was just the right amount!  Don't worry about the cookies being "too raw" when taking them out of the oven after the said time.  The outside is crispy and the inside is soft - yum!

This recipe turned out amazingly well! I substituted fresh ginger for the ground ginger and used coconut oil instead of margarine. I kneaded the dough with my hands Since I don't own a mixer (I never bake). The result was perfect! They are sure to become a Christmas tradition!

Followed this recipe to a tee but for some reason my cookies spread all over the pan. Not sure why. But I was able to salvage them by using a cookie cutter and made them into shapes instead of them being a huge blob. They do taste great...just not sure why they spread.

Made these cookies last Christmas and they came out really good. This time I did make a few minor changes. Added a touch more ginger and cinnamon and I had no cloves so I used some allspice. Also instead of water, I put in lemon juice. Just wanted a little more kick to the cookies with these changes. Also because of the higher altitude here, I baked them for 12 minutes. Also make sure you flatten them pretty good so you don't get a really high cake like cookie. Turned out perfect. This recipe is a keeper.

Loved it! Wonderful flavor, soft on the inside, and crunchy on the outside. Based on other reviews, I did change the one cup of sugar to 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/4 cup of white sugar (total sugar reduced because I like my cookies less sweet). And only other difference is that I needed to bake my cookies longer, for 12-13 minutes, for the inside to be fully cooked.

Excellent. Delicious. But a little bit too much sugar for our liking. We reckon halve the sugar and add some nice pieces of ginger or dried / glace ginger. Otherwise, very nice indeed.

Wow....I see why there are 3757 reviews on this recipe.  These are so good.  I did need to add an extra tablespoon of water and rolled them in sugar in the raw instead of white sugar.  This will be one of my new favorite recipes.  I will be making them again and sharing them for Christmas.  Thank you for sharing your recipe AMY1028.

I made this today for the first time and they turned out perfect and soft and delicious! I tweaked it (of course) - by adding 2 tsp of cornstarch, used 1 tsp of fresh grated ginger (added to the wet mix) and 1 tsp ground dry ginger (in the dry mix), used allspice instead of cloves, 1/2 c. Earth balance and 1/4 c. of sunflower oil, and used 90 ml of brown sugar and 90 ml of white sugar (total of 3/4 cup of sugar - not as potent as a full cup!), I used 1 tbsp. of orange juice as suggested in the comments and used egg replacer since I can't eat eggs. This turned out amazing! I will be making this more often.

Really delicious gingerbread cookies. Paired these with "Gingerbread Cookie Frosting" from this site to decorate. For the first batch, I left out the last step (to roll in sugar before baking) since I planned to use a sweet icing after, but for the second batch, I rolled as directed and they came out great, with or without icing. Thanks for posting!

sha-zam! A little sticky when you skip the chilling, but tender and light cookie results. Excellent recipe. I added a pinch of cayenne pepper & doubled the cinnamon. Cookie keeps well and has been a huge hit every time I've made it.

I did not change a thing and this recipe was a big hit.  I will recommend refrigerating the dough as others mentioned for about 30-40 minutes prior to rolling out.

These cookies are amazing! The spices are just right as is the texture.  I doubled the recipe and followed it exactly, the dough did not need to be chilled.  I will defiantly be making these again!

1st time using this recipe and
I'm pretty happy with the outcome! The dough was tacky but I didn't find
It too difficult to manage. Using orange juice instead of the water was a great suggestion and I didn't flatten the balls before cooking and they still flattened out nicely. I used butter instead of margarine so I'm not sure if that makes a huge difference?? Great cookies!!

These cookies are AMAZING.  I used butter instead of margarine and used the helpful tip to spray cooking spray so molasses didn't stick!  They are super soft and a delectable balance of spices.  My husband who doesn't typically like gingerbread cookies ate several of these right away :-)

OH MY GOSH. 
Even if you're not sure, just make them. They're amazing. 

The longer they bake the darker they get and turn out like a ginger snap.  Let them bake long enough that the tops look crackly. 

You're also going to need more than 2tbs of sugar to roll them in. Go 2tbs in bowl at a time though and refill as needed to minimize waste.     ...Amazing cookies!!!!

I made with butter. I thought they were good right out of the oven, then I tried one the next day. Even better. Oh my goodness!
I made sandwich cookies with these and a pumpkin cheesecake mousse. Absolutely delightful. Thank you!

I agree with others who chilled this dough before getting it on the pan. I would also say that you should cook it longer than the 8-10 minutes; more like 10-12.  Also flatten them out when putting on the pan.

These were pretty good! I've made them 3 times, every time with butter:
1) I made as directed and they were sticky and way too sweet! I had rolled them in sugar. I had chilled them as other people had suggested and didn't really think it had an effect. They were hard as rocks after baking so I had them dipped in my tea. They had excellent flavour though, so I knew I was going to make them again with some alterations.
2) I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup of sugar and omitted the water. Tasted delicious and were softer! But didn't really flatten out or crinkle nicely around the edges. I didn't chill them this time. Also had the oven at 375
3) I kept the sugar at 3/4 cups, still left out the water, but added slightly more butter, Like 7/8ths of a cup. Oven at 375. I rolled them about 1.5 inch balls and did not flatten. Still didn't chill and this time they are perfect! Is definitely a keeper now that I have perfected the recipe!

I LOVE  these cookies! I make them every fall and make them into ice cream sandwiches with homemade Pumpkin ice cream. They're divine! I do add a bit of finely chopped candied ginger to mine, and next time I'll try to orange juice suggested by other reviewers. After this, you never need another Ginger Cookie recipe!

I may need to make a second batch, as I don't know if there'll be enough left in two days' time.  I will reduce the sugar a bit next time I make them, but they're excellent.  I used an inch wide cookie dough scoop to drop the dough directly in the sugar, didn't flatten them, as I didn't read that far ahead in the recipe, and they spread out very nicely.

Definately a refrigerator dough. No way you could roll it into balls as is.  I left it in the freezer overnite and then took out one third of it at a time.  The cookies were very good.

Oh, Maria, your stuffed breasts are wonderful.  But I must confess, my dear.  I did follow the lead of others who pounded and rolled them with your ricotta and spinach mixture.  It just seemed to be the rational and natural thing to do.  Forgive me for not following your instructions with full faithfulness.  I hang my head.  But even with my transgression, this was a delicious hit.

The best recipe for Ginger Molasses cookies I have ever tried. I made the recipe as written and totally loved it.  However, I am a ginger nut so I add approximately 1 1/2 tsp of freshly grated ginger to the overall recipe the second time I made it.  Love it, will try boosting the flavor with the orange juice as one other member suggested.  I now have 3 go-to cookie recipes and this is number 1, bumped off my PB Chocolate Chip Cookies.  Go figure ginger is better than chocolate!

Very tasty but after 10 min baking they are super soft but the inside seems raw?  I tried going 12 min and then they are cooked through but the texture isn't as soft.  Maybe 11 min is the key.

Yum! These were some of the best ginger cookies I've ever had! I used fresh ginger (about 2 tblspoons) just to see if it made a difference--I think the cookies turned out more moist that way. I also used only one 1/2 stick of butter because that's a lot of butter. But these were gone straight out of the oven. I also did what another reviewer suggested and added a tiny bit of orange juice concentrate.

I might cut back on the molasses next time, it's a little overpowering.

But these are very, very good. Cooking time ended up being 11 minutes + five minutes sitting on a hot pan for us and our oven + high altitude. I will definitely make these again.

Great texture (light and fluffy) but bland. This is what I did differently from the recipe: 
I used 1 stick of butter plus 4 TBSP margarine
I used 5 TBSP very dark homemade brown sugar (instead of molasses)
I used 1 TBSP orange juice (instead of water)
Perfect baking time for me was: 9 minutes

The result was a great non-sticky cookie dough that was easy to roll into balls without refrigeration. The first six cookies were very light in color (not a gingerbread look at all) and rose well as they baked. The cookies were uniform, soft, and fluffy when they were done baking. However, the cookies tasted like bland sugar cookies with just a hint of spice at the end.

So, working with the remaining dough, I sprinkled an additional 2 tsp of ginger powder, 1 tsp of cinnamon and drizzled about 1/2 TBSP of molasses on top. I mixed the dough with my hands (too lazy to drag out the mixer again). I baked the cookies for 9 minutes. This time, the cookies turned out darker with more spice. The texture is still slightly soft but firmer. The cookies were still lacking that full-on gingerbread taste.

I will make this recipe again but I will let the dough rest in the fridge for a day, wrapped in plastic wrap, to let the spices meld.

This is my go to cookie recipe. The only thing I did different was grate in 1/2 tsp. fresh Ginger as well as the dry ginger. Makes a great difference. Even my grandchildren who love M & M cookies will request these.

the first time i made this, the cookies turned out beautifully. i made some slight changes. i added double the required cinnamon. im vegan so i left out the egg as well as the salt. i switched the white sugar for cane sugar. i didn't have any cloves so they didnt get added either. regardless, i loved the result. i made this recipe again tonight. i am out of margarine so i substituted with vegetable shortening. if i ever use shortening again for this recipe it will be at least 1/4 cup less the flour, the mix was rather dry and i had to crush it together in my hands to make it stick and this was after i added an extra tbsp of water. im certain it was because the lack of margarine in it. anyway, this time i did have cloves. i will never use cloves again as they made the cookies taste like potpourri. other than that, GREAT recipe. i will just make sure to have plenty of margarine on hand for next time.

These cookies turned out really good. i added white chocolate chips to add a little bit of sweetness. They were soft and chewy just what i was looking for with great flavor. Definitely give these cookies a try.

Very easy and very good... used a cookie scoop to mold cookies before rolling into sugar.  If you want to dress them up just do a light drizzle of melted white chocolate.... YUM!

They were good but I followed the recipe and they weren't the five star cookies I was expecting. Good cookies but nothing special.

Home for the holidays, bored, decided to look for a recipe. Thankfully I came across this one! Couple changes to the recipe;
Real butter not margarine,
Added Tablespoon of brown sugar,
also a splash of apple juice (would have used orange, i was out..).

Before working with the dough I stuck it in the fridge for about an hour. I had no problem making these, they weren't sticky at all. Remember to flatten them before baking. Cooked for 11 minutes.
Yum! Not the prettiest cookie but i love how they taste.

Perfect cookie :)
Full-fat, grass fed, butter with any baking venture is ideal imo.

Delicious! But it took me 4 times to figure out how to get the cookie I wanted (all using the same batch of dough) I used butter instead of margarine and increased the ground cloves to 1 teaspoon. I also combined everything in one bowl, combining wet ingredients first and then adding the dry so as to not have too much clean up. I then let it cool in the freezer for 30 minutes so the dough was easier to work with. 

I wanted a very specific looking cookie when I found this recipe - I wanted huge cookies with cracked tops. This is what I learned from the 4 batches I made - gently flatten with your finger tips if you want cracked tops - don't use the bottom of a glass. The more free air incorporated into the dough will help with cracking and using the bottom of a glass took too much of the air out of the dough. I also think that if you add a few small separate pieces of dough to the top of the cookie and just tap them on top - you will increase your chances of cracks.  If you want big cookies - use a lot more than a walnut size as instructed. For my big cookies the dough ball was closer to a ping-pong ball in size. I flattened gently with my finger tips until they were approximately 2 inches in diameter and about 1/3-inch high. I did not dip in sugar. I upped the oven temperature to 380 degrees and baked for 9 minutes. I uploaded a picture showing all 4 batches I made - the 4th batch was the winner as far as looks go - but they all taste great!

This recipe makes a soft, flavorful, delicious cooky. You'll have no problem with sticky fingers if you use chilled dough. Lightly flour the bottom of a glass before you flatten the cookies. For the liquid I used the orange liquor triple sec. I glazed the cookies as recommended by reviewer Michael J. Wild using triple sec for the liquid. The glaze didn't set 'til the next day so packing the cookies for a potluck was a bit of a problem. The next day they were perfect. Perhaps make and glaze them a day ahead if you're packing them for a party.

These are the family's absolute favorite cookies regardless of the time of year!  I always end up making two batches of them just to try and keep up with demand.  ;)  The only thing I did additional was pop the dough in the freezer for a few mins just to make it a little easier to roll.  Other than as written - fabulous!

I've made these for 3 years...it helps to cool the dough, but it's always going to be a little sticky.  This year I rolled them smaller than usual and baked for 7 minutes.  Perfect for a cookie tray, and well-balanced spices.

I have made these three times. The flavor is good, but you HAVE to chill the dough for a hour or two before working with it. Even if you were to do what others suggest and just drop the sticky dough into the sugar before balling it, the rest is much flatter and crispy. If you chill, form a ball, and THEN roll in sugar, you get the soft chewy cookie intended.

Great recipe. I usually make a ginger snap cookie with oil instead of butter/ margarine  but these stay softer.  You need to put the dough in the freezer for at least a half hour or more before rolling. It makes a huge difference. I always chill my cookie dough before baking. This is a holiday favorite.

Excellent recipe!  My kids loved these cookies.  They're a great alternative to gingerbread men.  After several hours of refrigeration I rolled the dough into 1" balls, rolled them in white sugar, then placed on a cookie sheet.  I baked them for 10 1/2 minutes; otherwise they were either too chewy or too hard.  They're definitely a keeper on my annual Christmas cookie list!

I made these cookies just as the recipe says. The taste is really very good but are on the crunchy side, not the soft side. I don't mind that because I like to dunk my cookies in tea or milk but a BIG SOFT cookie  they are not. That's why I gave them a 4 star rating.I would have put 4-1/2 but couldn't figure out how.

I've made other cookie of this type these are the BEST by far!!! Even the next day they are still nice and moist. They didn't last very long as some of my cookies do. I didn't change the recipe at all. You don't have to just use it at Christmas these are for anytime. Excellent!!!

Loathing the dry grocery-store ginger snaps always around the house when I was young, I thought I hated ginger cookies... Until this recipe. These cookies are soft and chewy and have an absolute exquisite balance of flavors. As others have said, though, it's good to let the dough chill for awhile otherwise getting them on the cookie sheet is a HUGE mess. I bet they'd bake the same with dough at room temperature but if you can spare yourself the fuss, why not? A hard lesson for me with this recipe is to watch them very, very closely in the oven... there's less than a minute between perfect and inedibly hard, and the difference is very subtle. You'll have to start pulling them out and giving them a good look every minute or so toward the end of baking. If you time it right, though, these are pretty much the best thing ever.

I am about to make these cookies for the third time in the past two weeks - this time for Thanksgiving! They really are wonderful. My sister, husband and I all decided that we like them better crispy - more like a gingersnap. We just cook them for a little longer. So good either way though!

Many years ago I had a recipe for molasses ginger cookies I got from a West Virginia farmer's wife - best cookies I'd ever tasted. That recipe got lost during a move and I have been chasing that flavor ever since. Out of all the recipes I have found to date this comes the closest to that remembered taste. One year I made them for a family Thanksgiving gathering and they went up against a few other homemade and a bunch of expensive store bought. At the end of the evening there were none of mine left, but plenty of the others available to take home with the leftovers. One little 3 year old guy was caught with one in each hand and a third in his mouth ;-) Well done!

I made these cookies intentionally to take them to school but my family ate them all before I could, they were just delicious. I cooked them a little less than 8 minute though to give them a softer texture but other then that they were great!

Delicious!  My family likes a little bit more spice so I added 1 tsp nutmeg, 1 tsp allspice, 1/2 tsp cardamon and a pinch of pepper.  Easy to make and turned out nice and soft.

QUESTION : I followed the recipe exactly as written. I even let the dough sit out for a bit, as other people have suggested. But when I went to roll the dough up my dough kept falling apart. I don't know if this is normal or if I done something wrong. This is my first time making ginger cookies so I'm not aware of how the dough should be.

I made these cookies three years ago for when my daughter took these in for a Christmas pot luck and WOW everyone raved about them and wanted more.  I had a hard time to keep my husband out of the cookie jar they were fabulous.  People at my daughter's work thought that she was bringing in Gingerbread Men and she said no something much better.  The cookies disappeared fast off the plate and I will be making more this year as usual.  Thank you very much for this great recipe.

These were absolutely delicious!  We made them in our school cooking class today.  The kids and some teachers just loved them.  I split the sugar into half brown sugar and half white sugar because I wanted to guarantee they would be moist.  This is definitely a keeper!  I will make them for the holidays and to give to others as gifts.  Thank you Amy1028 for sharing!

They're just like the ones you buy at the big, expensive coffee chains! With a cup of apple cider, no better way to spend a chilly, miserable fall day.

The first time I made this recipe it was a DISASTER!  I substituted butter for margerine.  The second time I made them I used crisco.  They were much better!  I used a 9 grain flour in place of the all purpose flour.  I ended up having to add an additional 1/4 c. flour.

Perfect. Made exactly as written. First batch went so fast i made another the next day! Worked great as small and large cookies, flattened before baking. Second day i just baked it all in one  9 x 12 pan and sprinkled sugar on top (baked a bit longer). Gingerbread perfection!

I rated this 4 but these were so unbelievably amazing the way I made them. We ended up making 3 batches! I used 2 1/2 cups of ap flour, 1 1/2 tsp of baking soda, 2 tsp of cinnamon, no cloves, 1/2 cup brown sugar INSTEAD of molasses, 1 TB vanilla INSTEAD of water, and a lot more ginger like 4 tsp of ground ginger and OVER a TB of grated fresh ginger root. I dropped the balls into brown sugar and flattened slightly I also used parchment paper for no fuss removal and easy cleanup and I sprayed my hands w/ cooking spray before rolling so I didn't have to put the dough in the fridge.  My family was eating them faster than I could bake them, I should have just doubled the recipe to begin w/. This is my new go-to cookie and I will always make these everytime I go anywhere and need to bring food. Ginger is so beneficial I doubt we will get it any other way than this. I just hate how I cant stop!:)

I subbed 3/4 the amount of Molasses for Packed brown sugar & Cloves for Allspice. 
I deff should have Flattened the cookies Allot more because they were very Puffy! that I ended up cooking them an extra 5 mins because I thought they weren't cooked. 
Besides that they turned out alright, the texture was more like Cake than a cookie though, but I had them warm, they'll probably be better when they are cold or cooled for a day. 
Not quite my fav, but It's pretty easy to make, would try again, but with a different flavour.

This is by far the best recipe for soft ginger cookies I have ever tried. I substituted 1/2 cup of the white sugar for brown. Excellent recipe!

These cookies are very tasty.  I did make a change - instead of 1 cup of white sugar I used 1/2 cup of light brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar. Also to prevent the cookies from spreading when baking I baked them at a higher temperature 375 degrees.  Definitely making these cookies again.

Delicious! WARNING!! 
Double the recipe or you will be sorry you didn't. The guys at my coffee club and my boyfriend at all 4 1/2 dozen (I doubled the receipt). You do need to refridgerate the dough for about an hour and flour your hands befor forming you dough. I did use the tablespoon of orange juice instead of the water to bring out the flavor in the ginger. They where soft and moist even the day after baking when I took them to the coffee club. 0(*@*)0

I made these for church coffee 'ans and everyone said they were the best ginger cookies they had EVER had.  I did change one little thing - I used half butter flavored Crisco instead of all butter.  I think that helps hold their shape better and keeps them from burning.
Otherwise, the recipe is fantastic.  My husband begged me to bake them again, so I'm doing that today.

soft cookie, good, mild flavor. followed recipe. no changes.
Used cold soft tub margarine, and warmed my molassess up in the microwave so it was runny (makes it not sticky). rolled nicely right after mixing. no chilling. cooked 10 minutes. the cookies still looked soft and runny on top at 10 minutes, but after closer inspection the bottoms were starting to look a bit darker than the rest of the cookie and I could smell them. both good signs a cookie is done. I took them out fearing they were not cooked properly, and let them sit on the cookie sheet for 5 minutes. The tops firmed up while sitting and volia! a perfect soft cookie.

made 3/4 inch balls - not flattened  only flattened slightly for a fluffy small cookie.
made 1.5 inch balls flattened half way - turned out about the same as they went in.

Omitted from last review:  I used unsalted butter instead of margarine, and used a cookie scoop rather than trying to roll out balls of dough.  It worked beautifully with perfectly round cookies.

Wonderful cookies. So soft and chewy and they look store bought they are so pretty. For Christmas we rolled them in colored sugar and gave them as gifts to our neighbors. Very quick and easy to make! My whole family love them. A keeper for sure.

I love ginger snaps - but hate how they are so hard to bite through...so tried this recipe with no changes to see if it could solve the problem.  With NO changes it is perfect. Slight crunch to the bottom of the cookie but the rest is soft and easy to bite through with enough ginger to have a 'snap' without a burn.  No changes recommended.These cookies are flat so if you are looking for a cakier style cookie you will need to modify.

Wonderful ginger cookies! The friend I made these for ate the entire 2 dozen cookies in under 3 hours. I think they were a tad bit dry for my taste, but that may have been a mistake on my part. I would definitely make these again.

I've been craving a good ginger cookie and this recipe is definitely a keeper!  I read quite a few reviews before baking them today and opted to use butter as another reader suggested instead of margarine.  Also, I added the ginger spice as stated in the recipe but didn't have all the other spices so I used pumpkin pie spice instead which has all the spices rolled into one.  These cookies are excellent right out of the oven and they won't have an opportunity to go stale!
Note: I might try making them next time with brown sugar instead of white to see if I get a chewier cookie.
Thanks for a great soft ginger cookie recipe!

this was my first time making Any gingerbread cookies but I knew I wanted a soft cookie.  this was PERFECT.  Easy to make and cooked just like they said.  I did however refrigerate my dough so it would stay harder.  rolling these into balls was almost imposible.  but I was able to scoop them and form them into a ball.  I didn't even have to squish mine down to make them into perfect cookies.  I also didn't roll them in sugar, I just sprinkled a little on them after they came out of the oven.  I'm so impressed they came out first try.  No need to look for another recipe!!

These are very good cookies.. as a preparation tip, chilling the batter helps alot with the rolling process, but I've found that the most efficient, and cleanest way to sugar the cookies is to use a disher and dish the cookies straight into a cereal sized bowl with the sugar in it.  Toss the dough ball in the sugar bowl as you would if you were sauteeing or flipping a pancake.  This way, your hands don't even touch the batter until it's covered in sugar - way easier to maneuver to the pan.  Oh!  And they are on the puffier side when you first take them out of the oven, but the 5 minute cooling time on the pan is crucial to letting them "deflate" into what looks like the picture

Three stars is being nice and only for the flavor of the cookies!  The dough was waaaay to gooey to roll into balls.  I probably added a cup of extra flour trying to firm them up since I didn't want to take the time to chill them (and per other reviews it doesn't make a difference even if you do chill...you still can't work with the dough).  I looked over the recipe a half dozen times to make sure I put in the correct amount of ingredients and then read some reviews and determined it wasn't me...it's just the recipe.  I may try this again when I have a couple hours to refrigerate the dough to see if that makes a difference.

Hands down best molasses cookie recipe I have made.  They do stay soft and I put them in the freezer and pulled them out for the holidays and they thawed into the same soft cookie that came out of the oven.  Use good quality molasses and I used a# 50 scoop and rolled into balls  in sugar then pressed them slightly and sprinkled with larger crystal decorating sugar.  I refrigerated the dough for an hour before baking. Do not flatten with a fork, just slightly give a press with heel of palm.  Rave reviews from friends.

These cookies were wonderful! I followed the recipe exactly except I followed reviewers' suggestions and subbed orange juice for the water.

These cookies are amazing on their own, but I frosted them with lemon frosting and they were one of the best cookies I'd ever had! Here's the recipe for the lemon frosting I made:

1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened;
1/3 cup shortening;
1 teaspoon vanilla extract;
3 tablespoons milk;
2 Tablespoons, 1 teaspoon lemon juice;
4 cups powdered sugar

I found this same recipe years ago in a Christmas cookie book. This is, by far, the best ginger cookie recipe. I tend to be more of a chocolate chip cookie person, myself, personally. And yet, these are delicious and they could easily give any chocolate chip cookie a run for it's money (or, it's chips). Also, it is usually a hit at most holiday parties during the winter season. Yay.

This is one yummy cookie!  Hubby was in the mood for gingerbread, so I made these.  I did use all butter...never have marjarine, and because I had only about 3/4 cup sugar, used dark brown sugar for the remaining 1/4 cup.  After refrigerating the dough for about 45 minutes, they were easy to work with.  I didn't roll them in sugar, and thought they were just sweet enough as is.  I used my 1 tablespoon cookie scoop.  They turned out chewy with a slightly crisp outer edge.  Hubs can't stop eating them!  I ended up with 28 cookies.  These are going on my Christmas cookie trays for sure.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe is amazing!!!  I followed everybody's advice and substituted the water with orange juice.  I also let the dough sit in the refrigerator for around an hour so that it would be easy to handle.  I like my molasses cookies crispy so I made sure to flatten out the dough.  I think part of the key to making these extra yummy is to cream your butter and sugar until the mixture almost looks white.

These are fantastic!!!! One question though; how do you get a nice dark colour to the cookies? Min seem to come out beige and smooth, rather than dark and slightly crackled. Help?

AMAZING.
I used the 1 tbsp of orange juice, used 2 tsp ginger paste instead of ground and about half the amount of sugar and just WONDERFUL. 
Instead of chilling in the fridge to handle, I used an ice cream scoop, dropped the dough into a small bowl of sugar, then rolled it around using a spoon. I did flatten pretty well onto the sheet but make sure you give a bit a room for them to spread. 
Just delightful and definitely a new Christmas tradition!

Quite good. They're one of my favorites. As stated in other reviews, the dough can become a royal mess when one tries to roll them into balls, but if you keep your hands slightly damp with a wet cloth kept near, this problem is quickly overcome.

I don't care for crunchy cookies, so I was so happy to find this recipe for soft gingerbread cookies. They never last long in my house. I make these cookies multiple times a year, and I just love them. I don't bother with rolling them in sugar, though; instead I just spoon them out onto my sheet and bake.

These are the most delicious, soft and moist cookies.  They go great with a bowl of pumpkin ice cream.

I love ginger cookies, and these really hit the spot.  I have a hot oven, so I turned the heat down to 300-325C ish for 8 mins.  They melt in your mouth, so soft and perfect.  I used the back of a smooth to evenly flatten them and it worked well (not too flat though).  I used 3/4 c of brown sugar instead, and no salt margarine.  I LOVE ginger, so next time I may even try adding fresh ginger or crystalized ginger for an extra punch.  I highly recommend making them.

OMG! These are just like my favourite Molasses Cookies from Archway - but better, cuz they're warm and fresh, and I know what's in them! The only only change I made was to use butter instead of margarine. I put them in the fridge for an hour before using a scoop to portion them out. I think these will be made daily in my house!

When I made this recipe I didn't have any molasses, so I substituted it with raw Texas honey instead.  This didn't give the cookies that delightful brown color, but they were still pretty good!  The ground cloves leave a little "zing" in the back of your throat.  I also substituted the water with orange juice. I used a melon baller/small cookie scoop to give them a perfect round shape before rolling them in sugar.  I also pressed them a little bit onto the cookie sheet.  They tasted especially awesome with some whipped cream cheese frosting.

YUM!  You must try this recipe EXACTLY as written.  The key is to refrigerate the dough over night.  After you made a few, pop it back in the fridge for a few minute when it starts to get too sticky again.  Also, like the directions say, make sure you leave them on the cookie sheet for 5 min. after they come out of the oven.  Can't really rush these cookies, but they are worth it.  Don't change the ingredients and then say they weren't amazing.  You don't know what you're missing.

These cookies are delicious!  I had to make them with maple syrup because molasses is hard to come by in Germany, but they tasted great anyways.  I'll have to try them with molasses and extra ginger... I'm sure they will taste more like ginger snaps that way!

I first made these cookies a couple years ago and nearly ate myself sick! I've now made them for the second time tonight and they are every bit as delicious. Some tweaks I make with this recipe are: 1 T of orange juice instead of water, use 1/2 tsp baking soda and 1/2 tsp baking powder, and add more spices than called for (especially cloves, LOVE cloves). Finally, I sub out 1 c dark brown sugar instead of white, as I love the beautiful dark, molasses color I think ginger cookies should be. I've tried the balls vs. flattening them and honestly don't notice much of a difference, so I generally just shape them into balls and roll them in sugar. 8 minutes in my oven is perfect and these cookies deliver exactly the texture I love in all cookies....soft and chewy on the inside and just slightly crispy on the outside. I adore the smell of these cookies as I'm taking them out of the oven. They make my kitchen smell divine. LOVE this recipe!

I normally don't like ginger, but, when you put everything mixed in with it, you'd see that it makes the cookie all sweet, soft and delicious. You, Have GOT to try this recipe.

Best recipe for ginger molasses cookies I've found! I really suggest dropping the dough right into the sugar to form the balls because it is really sticky like other people have mentioned. The only reason why I gave them a 4 star rating instead of a 5 star rating is because they took a long time to make due to putting them in the fridge and it being difficult to roll the dough. However, completely worth it because they are delicious!!

This sounds just like everyone elses reviews..but these are the best ginger cookies I have ever had.  They are a gooey mess, but I just used my cookie scoop.  Once I scooped them, I pressed the cookie into a plate of sugar, and then dropped the cookie onto the sheet, flipping it over so the sugar is on the top.  You can't believe how fast these went.  I took them to work, and I made a double recipe, and they were gone in a matter of minutes...and I only work with 12 girls!! AND...all of them are always watching their figure...These are amazing!!!

Other than subbing butter for margarine and doubling the recipe...I made this as is...rare for me.  Hubby was ecstatic...!  Must have made them a little too small as I got a much higher yield...(oh, darn!!!).  Am taking 1 1/2 dozen to a retirement home tomorrow...hubby does not share well with others when it comes to something this delish!  Thanks, AMY1028...these are absolutely perfection.  I had no problem with the making!!!

DANG these are good cookies.  I tend to prefer desserts with chocolate, so I made these to bring to Christmas at my family's house, thinking I'd be able to resist eating many of them.  WRONG.  They are FANTASTIC cookies.  My stepdad, another choco-holic, was also hooked on them.

Best oatmeal cookies i've ever had.  Sometimes when i make them, i switch it up, i add craisins, or white chocolate chips.... or regular chocolate chips... i cook them 8 minutes to start with, and they usually need a minute and a half longer, and they're golden brown on the bottom, soft and chewy in the middle!  I've got nothing but the highest compliments when i make these cookies!

I followed recipie the same, next time I will try the orange juice as per other suggestions.  I used a small scoop for size and only dipped half the cookie in sugar.  I found this worked out great!  They did flatten out quite well, and at this size they could probably bake 6-8 minutes, they were crunchy on the bottom and slightly chewy.  Great recipe!!!

All I can say is WOOOOOOW!!! These cookies are D-E-LICIOUS. I made these for my friends at small group and the girls loved it!! All the cookies were gone within 30 minutes(no joke). They are soft and moist and just plan good. One of my friend's who is a baker could not stop talking about them and asked for the recipe. Only thing I would say is that I made these once with butter and the another time with margarine. The cookies taste a little better with the extra buttery flavor from the margarine, but are much more sticky and were not as pretty as the batch with all butter. I might do as someone else did and use 1/2 cup butter 1/4 cup margarine. All in all these cookies are the bomb diggidity!!

Love these! Great gingerbread taste. As other reviewers have recommended, I substitute orange juice or orange liquer for the water, and letting the mix sit in the fridge before rolling helps with the stickiness. And I put the sugar into mug so I can plop in the dough ball, roll it around, and pick it up easily. I used these in place of gingersnaps in another recipe on this site, Grilled Peaches with Gingersnaps (and ice cream!), perfect.

If you like ginger cookies, you'll LOVE this recipe and if you don't like ginger cookies, this may be the recipe that changes your mind.  I followed the recipe exactly, except for a repeated suggestion from many reviews, to substitute orange juice for the water.  By rolling the uncooked ball of dough in sugar, it produces a crackly exterior that seems to really highlight the soft and chewy interior.  I also opted to make a simple glaze of powdered sugar and milk, which I drizzled over the cooled cookie.  Perfect.  This will be integrated into my Christmas cookie lineup.

These cookies were a perfect blend of spices! If you are a gingerbread/spice fan you will love this! I froze my dough for about an hour and they ended up spreading out into thin, but still moist, chewy cookies.

Made these today with gluten free all purpose flour (dh is celiac).  Just add 1/4 tsp xanthum gum to flour mix.  I don't usually even like ginger cookies, but these are excellent!  Kids and husband will be begging for more!

These are amazing!  I used butter instead of margarine.  I place in freezer for about 10 minutes before making the balls.  Used cookie scoop and baked for 8 minutes!

I live in Western Canada. After trying to make these a few times and having them fall flat and crispy on me I have found that putting the formed balls into the fridge for 1/2 an hour then directly transferring them into the pre-heated oven works nicely. They are soft in the center as the recipe states. I also tried a chocolate ginger cookie recipe once it having chocolate chips in it gave me the idea of putting a tbsp of cacao powder ( pure cocoa pwdr) in the flour mixture of these cookies. I love the result. Now I can rate this a 5 star recipe.

OMG are these good. After tasting the batter we added a little more ginger and cinnamon for an extra spicy cookie. They turned out great. We will definately make these again.

My kids loved these so much at Christmas that they asked for them again in February. We ended up with gingerbread Valentines. For icing, I mixed confectioners sugar with orange juice and a little vanilla.

Absolutely, hands down, one of my favorite cookies of all time.  A true delight from the moment I measure out the ground ginger to my first bite - right out of the oven!

These cookies are always a hit with family and friends.  I love rolling them in sugar before placing them on the cooke sheet for baking, fyi.

I always like to increase the spices in this, just adding whatever I happen to have on hand - I'm a big fan of nutmeg. Anyways, pretty straightforward, roll into a ball, roll ball in sugar, and bake. Don't flatten; bake until done, but still puffy (use toothpick to check). The cookies will deflate as they cool and look amazing!

The BEST EVER! I've made numerous ginger molassas cookies before and somehow none as good as these.   I made these with my two girls ages 7 and 5.  We measured everything exactly as it was called for. ( I am one for following a recipe to the letter the first time I make it).  I will admit that rolling the dough into balls was tricky as it was sticky, however my 5 year old could do it just fine.  I am glad I didn't add more flour.  It would have mutted the wonderful spice flavor of these!  My kids who dislike these kind of cookies LOVE them!.  Some I baked for the time that it called for and they turned out delicious soft and chewy, some I baked for twice as long, and got a nice browned crispy, but not burned, biscuit type of cookie that was equally as good.  Thanks for sharing.  This is a keeper!!!

I started making these in December 2010 and I make them every few months now. Every single time, they're so soft and delicious! My fiance actually tells me not to make them because he always eats so many when I make them! As others have mentioned, the dough will be very sticky, but just scoop it out onto the sugar you're going to roll them in and it helps a bit. Sticky dough or not, I'll keep making these for a long time!

When I read the word "soft" in the title, I didn't know it meant "cakey." These are some of the cakiest cookies I've ever made. If I were to continue to use this recipe as a base recipe -because that's the only thing I'd use it for- I'd leave out a fourth cup of the flour, halve the baking soda, and add either an egg yolk or a touch more butter. Unsatisfying.

tips: put dough in freezer for a couple hours and then refrig in between batchs or you'll have a gooey mess on your hands! Wasn't happy with the cookies the 1st day I made them, but the next day they tasted better. Dough is difficult to work with though so not sure I will fight with it again.

I have made gingerbread cut outs for years. Last year I wanted to make something simple and different. I made this recipe and couldn’t believe how good they were. We quickly went through my first batch, then I made a batch for work, those went quick (as well as several requests for the recipe). I made them for the extended family on Christmas and they were such a hit my aunt asked for these for her Birthday in May. They really are that good!

I did use ANIA520’s tips for the dough and OJ, but minimal adjustments for sure. Great recipe, I’m about to make this year’s first batch!

I followed the recipe exactly but it was MUCH to soft to roll into balls. I had to keep adding a little flour. They were just ok in my opinion. I wouldn't make again.

OMG. Best cookie ever. Truly is big and soft. Make sure to use softened butter, not melted butter. Make sure to not over mix the dry into the wet ingredients. Just until it comes together, no more. Used freshly squeezed satsuma juice and only used 3/4 c sugar. Did not roll into sugar either. Thanks for the recipe.

Good flavor, but mine didn't turn out pretty and dark like the pic. I was looking for more of a soft ginger snap, this was like a ginger bread. Very tasty cookie, just not like my mother's! Haha, next year I'll ask for her recipe.

Great cookies with a nice amount of spice.  As per recommendations, I used orange juice instead of water.  I also used a small ice cream scoop to shape them- scooped up the amount I wanted, dropped it into the sugar and rolled- very little hassle or mess, and I didn't refrigerate the dough.  This recipe is a keeper.

Oh my goodness. I just sampled one of these and they are deeelicious.  I followed everything to a T except I didn't want to roll them in plain sugar.  What I did was mix Hershey's unsweetened cocoa and sugar and rolled the cookies in it before baking.  I also flattened them with a fork crisscrossing the lines.  They look so pretty and taste fantastic.   I will not just make these for holidays but also when I feel like having them again which may be every month or so.  Thanks for a great recipe.  A real keeper.

This cookie has a nice shape.  I like my gingersnaps a lot spicier though. I used butter instead of margarine & the flavor was too rich.  My kids really liked them.  If I make these again, I will add more ginger & cinnamon.

These turned out great!  The taste of ginger snaps without breaking your teeth.  I dropped them on a cookie sheet and flattened them with the bottom of a glass dipped in sugar, so I didn't have to get my hands in it.

Soft and moist. I made them about dollar sized balls because we try to keep our cookie size down. It made about 40 cookies with a single batch. The second batch was made with walnuts, raisins and dried cranberries.  Absolutely delicious both ways.

Yum! These cookies came out amazingly, I thought they would be a bit 'fluffier' as mine fell quite flat but they stayed chewy and had the perfect amount of spices. Definite keeper!

Wow, these were very easy and DELICIOUS!  I read in a lot of other reviews that the dough was too soft to work with, but I didn't have any problems with it.  I didn't have enough margarine in my house, so I went ahead and subbed in shortening for the margarine and they were awesome.  Thanks for a repeat recipe!

I'm making them right now...good thing I doubled this since it is taking an incredible amount of will power not to finish the first half of the cookies even before the other half has come out of the oven. I put these in the fridge overnight (just because I didn't have time to bake them). The dough is sticky. I used two teaspoons to scoop out the dough and to stick in on the cookie sheet. No mess at all! Although I didn't form them into nicely shaped balls or roll them into sugar. They are sweet enough for my liking. I agree with another reviewer, these will definitely put you on an all cookie diet

A friend made these for Thanksgiving and they were unbelievable. I haven't had sugar in over 6 months, but smelling these cookies drove me over the edge! (And they were competing with my home-made apple pie, which I love.) I'll be making them for a school event. The smell is a subtle ginger-sugar; no sharp bite. Really excellent addition to a Christmas cookie platter.

Wow...they were good, but not fabulous like everyone else thought.  I must find my Mother's recipe as hers were soft & chewy and had more of that ginger flavour and less of the molasses. (I know this recipe states "soft").  They did do the though, and were soft just as promised!!

AWESOME, easy cookie.  Made as written...still squishy after 3 days...Will triple for Christmas and get an assembly line for the rolling in balls to sugar to pan then squish.  Got 40 cookies from 1 batch with walnut sized balls that I flattened with a glass.  GREAT cookie!!

I got slightly less than 24 cookies out of this recipes (about 20) using a 2 tablespoon measuring cup as my scooper. Also I baked at 320 degrees. Because of this, my cookies came out considerably lighter than the picture. However, they are absolutely perfect. I've kept them in a sealed contained and 3 days later, they are still soft. I've given some to my friends. They all say this is the best ginger cookie they have ever had.

These cookies are amazing!!  I followed the recipe exactly.  Eight minutes was perfect for mine and I made them all about a tablespoonful, rounded.  I also followed the advice of others and flattened them out to abut 1/4 inch.  Perfect!

About 4 years ago I discovered this recipe and my boyfriend LOVED them. They are now his absolute favorite. I make them at least once a month. These cookies taste just like ginger snaps but are soft :) My two alterations to the recipe are 1) use real butter and 2) I use a small cookie scoop and roll each ball of dough completely in white sugar, before placing and baking. There is just something magical about the aroma of these cookies baking... They smell like HOME

These were great! I took a reviewers advice and did the oj instead of water and took another reviewers advice and really flatten them. MY ADVICE: my first pan were small and I made my second pan much bigger and they were way better.

Wow!  These are AWESOME!  I did make them with orange juice instead of water and let the dough rest in the fridge for an hour.  Rolling them in sugar actually helped get them on the cookie sheet since the sugar acted kind of like flour.  These were REALLY REALLY good!

These cookies are so wonderfully chewy, and spiced just so perfectly, that they rarely last more than a day in my house. Though this recipe is perfect as is, I have made a few changes because I prefer my cookies a little less sweet. Instead of 1 cup of white sugar I use 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown. I also use brown sugar, with a generous dash of cinnamon, for the coating rather than the white sugar. YUMMY!

to those readers who get flat cookies- it is the water that does that- I deliberately add 1 Tbsp water to my chocolate chip recipe- makes them less cake-like-
nice and chewy- my husband loves them.

These cookies were a huge hit! I followed the suggestion to use orange juice instead of water.

A word of advice: don't try to make these into interesting shapes. They are great as drop cookies (like they're supposed to be) but disastrous to try to use a cookie cutter on. That was my own mistake!

Yummy!

I used gluten-free flour (so added 1 tsp xanthan gum), didn't have any cloves (so added nutmeg), and used half cup honey/half cup sugar (instead of 1 cup sugar). Put dough in the fridge for almost an hour before rolling into balls. Rolled in raw (chunky brown) sugar (probably closer to 4-5 tablespoons). Cooked one batch for 8 minutes and one batch for 9 minutes. I think 9 minutes is better.

Cookies are delicious! Great recipe. EASY! Delicious. Love it! Love it! Love it! Thank you!

Amazing Recipe! Very easy. Beware that the dough is very sticky. I put it in the fridge for a while to make it easier to roll into balls. The more you flatten them, the hard they'll be. If you want a soft cookie, don't flatten it very much. Hard cookie (good for dipping in milk) flatten quite a bit.

These were fantastic! My boyfriend's birthday was approaching and I had absolutely no idea what to get him(he's hard to shop for) and I remembered him mentioning that ginger molasses cookies were his absolute favourite cookie(and finally I knew what I had to do!). Having no cookbooks of my own I resorted to the internet and I found this recipe. They were super easy for me to do considering it was my first time doing them. When they came out of the oven it was hard to 'taste test' only two! My boyfriend loved them so much he didn't even want to share with anyone(which he didn't) and went through them so fast. Yeah, he's already asking for more!

These are wonderful! I didn't change a thing and they turned out great. We used this recipe to make gingerbread men in our house.

The flavor is amazing on these, but I have made them 3 times and they turn out so flat - I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong.  The only change I make is that I use butter instead of margarine.  We don't use margarine in my house.  Any ideas??  I love the taste, but want a fluffier cookie - seriously, they are as flat as pancakes when I make them.

WOW!! I have never been a big fan of gingersnaps, but these are amazing! I made these with the intent of giving them to my dad for his birthday since gingersnaps are his favorite. They smelled so good while I baked them that I had to taste one. WOW! They were so soft, and the flavor is really good. You won't regret using this recipe!

one of my favorites! works every time. gotta be careful not to make the cookies too big though, or you will just get a pan-sized cookie. I often substitute whole wheat flour for the white.

As written, it is 4 stars. I first made as written. My son said, "not much flavor". I then made again and added more of each spice. Didn't measure, just heaped whatever measuring spoon I was using. I know i used a little over 1 tsp cinnamon. Fantastic. 5+ stars. My 18 yr old daughter says they are her new favorite cookie. I refrigerated dough 15 min before rolling in my hands and in between baking. Didn't roll in sugar, but dipped flat glass in cinn/sugar mix and pressed to make pretty flat. Great recipe.

These were so very easy to make, since I am no pro at baking.  These were not very sweet and I really love the clove/molasses taste to them.  My picky boyfriend really loved them.  Thank you for posting.

I wish I could give this 6 stars - if you like ginger and molasses, these are the BEST.COOKIES.EVER!  The only thing I change is that instead of white sugar, I use coarse-grain raw sugar to roll them in - gives them a bit of texture and crunch that pairs great with the softness of the cookie.  YUM!

I give these a 2 because although the flavor is good, they did not bake up big and fluffy as I had hoped. But rather sunk quickly and became your average flat ginger cookie. I baked for exactly 8 minutes and still, they looked fluffy at first but sunk in during the cooling process.

I love Ginger cookies.  Now I don't have to buy them.... Great Recipe.  Like others I substitute water for Orange Juice.  For the sugar topping I added approx 1/2 teaspoon of pumkin pie spice... they taste great.
Thank you for the great recipe!

YUMMMMMMMY. SO FREAKIN GOOD. Followed the recipe to an exact T.

Put it in the freezer for 15-20 minutes and it won't be sticky, keep doing that while the batch is baking in the oven :D. SO GOOD. Now that I've done it with the original, I have yet to try it with the orange juice.

OH MY GOODNESS, these are SO good!  I will never make another ginger/molasses cookie again.  I have made them multiple times and my family loves them.  I have a hard time not eating at least six right off the countertop.    What I like about this recipe is that it's easy (almost foolproof); you can use butter or margarine and no dough chilling is required.  I did double all spices as I like my molasses cookies with a little kick.  I also rolled them in nutmeg sugar prior to baking.  They didn't spread out too much (i.e., remained thick) and they STAY SOFT!  They will be part of my Christmas baking for sure.

I needed a fall cookie recipe for my church event last year.  I made these ginger cookies, and now, this is a regularly request from some of my church mebers.  This is one of the best cookie recipes that I have come across in a while.

Made these, turned out great! Used a whisk instead of sifting each ingredient, which worked nicely. I took other reviewers' advice and used orange juice instead of water. I thought they needed a little something extra, so I melted white chocolate chips in a plastic bag, mixed in some orange extract, cut the corner of the bag off, and drizzled over the cookies. It turned out beautiful, and made them just a little moister and sweeter! The orange flavor really complemented the cookie. Gave them to my sister to take to the lake, and they were gone within a day. Will make these again!

This is a good basic recipe, but need to add atleast 1/2 - 3/4 tsp salt and 1 tsp vanilla for best flavor. Also I used 2 1/2 cups flour because I am at 4000 ft elevation and it was perfect dry to wet ratio.

It was OK - my husband liked them.  I found it difficult to tell when they were done - I burned half the batch - it only took 8 minutes in my over. Don't think I would make these again.

I'm giving this recipe 4 stars out of 5 mainly because I had to adjust the recipe. If I hadn't had to adjust it would have been 5 stars. I upped the flour to 2 1/2 cups and I downed the molasses to a tablespoon. It was the perfect consistency and gave me those beautiful crackle topped cookies I was looking for.

Incredible!  These cookies came out beautifully.  The tops didn't crack as much as I would have liked, but hey, life goes on.  Thank you Amy for a great recipe.

I made these cookies for a cookie exchange.  I doubled the recipe and it made over and beyond what I needed (which was a good thing since my family devoured them). I followed the recipe exactly and rolled the dough into walnut sized pieces while flattening them out just a bit.  They were nice and soft  and tasted fabulous.  Definitely an A+ recipe!

Fantastic cookies!  Easy to make.  Like everyone else, I put the dough in the fridge for an hour and as a result the dough was exceptionally easy to use.  Used Crisco instead of margarine (had some left over that needed to be used).  Did 50/50 white and brown sugar.  Baked for 10 minutes and the cookies came out perfect. Thanks!

These have been received with raves! Sent some with the pheasant hunters, they loved them. I cut the ginger back just a little - I have a good quality ginger, and it is potent. These are a soft cookie, do not bake them too long.

These are good cookies, but in the interest of full disclosure, I've only ever had store-bought gingersnap cookies that are like rocks.   I used white whole wheat flour and I scooped it out of the canister (instead of spooning it in and leveling it off) to try and make sure that my dough wasn't too sticky. I also heaped the ginger, cinnamon and baking soda before adding them. I used half brown and half white sugar, put in Cointreau instead of the water, and used butter instead of margarine. Finally, I rolled the cookies in cinnamon sugar before baking them for 8 minutes. With all those changes my cookies turned out just fine, very soft with a nice little crunch from the sugar. I had a few cookies that had some cracks but none looked like the main picture, maybe I just need a good food stylist.

These cookies are the best ever, Definitely a keeper. However with the dough being so soft,I found it easier to scoop them with a #30 Hamilton Beach Scoop. also i didn't add any sugar to the top, they're perfect without it.They will certainly get a place in my recipe book.

Very tasty cookies but in all the batches I cooked from the one recipe, I could not make mine look like the photo.  It didn't matter if I flattened them a lot or a little. It also didn't matter if the dough was ice cold or just cool.

These are exactly as the title describes.  Even those who think they're not a fan of ginger cookies will become addicted.  My husband couldn't stop eating them when they were fresh out of the oven.  As a nice little twist, I have also sandwiched them together with a pumpkin cream cheese filling.

I made them gluten free-1.5 cups gf baking flour and 3/4 cup fine white cornmeal-and they are great.  even my husband who is fairly critical of healthy variations liked them a lot.

Absolutely delicious!  I ran out of white sugar so substituted light brown for a little more than half of it, which made me worry that they would be too "molasses-y."  They weren't.  Next time I will sub rum for the water.  Also, I iced them with a rum glaze which really added some complexity. Can't wait to make them again!

Love these cookies, so chewy & soft!! The only thing that I changed, was putting an extra 1/2 teaspoon of ginger and instead of using margarine I always use unsalted butter (butter always makes a difference when baking)...

These cookies had nice flavor with the spices, but the margarine left a rather strange after-taste.  Maybe it was the brand of margarine I chose or maybe I'm just used to the flavor of butter.  I may try them again with Crisco instead of margarine to retain that soft texture.

The only change I made was substituting margarine for butter because I didn't have the former. I don't think it's the reason these turned out flat like pancakes. The mixture was gooey, I put it in a freezer for an hour, then oiled my hands to roll the batter into balls, but it began melting right away in my hands. As expected, they came out looking nothing like the pictures. I don't understand what I did wrong.

Just made these cookies and they're absolutely fantastic. I don't often take the time to write reviews here (bad I know) but had to for these. The recipe is perfect as is EXCEPT that I used a little less sugar than called for in the batter and then just sprinkled sugar over the tops of the cookies before baking instead of full on rolling them in the sugar. I also used orange juice instead of water as per someone's suggestion. Soft, delicious, no overpowering flavors. Perfection.

I've been looking for a recipe like this for years! They are soft and flavorful. I added an additional 1/4 cup flour so they didn't spread out as much. I highly recommend this recipe.

My son and I made these yummy cookies and they turned out great. Soft and flavourful without being too strong in ginger. My cookies fell flat after they cooled and I was kinda hoping they would have been a little more "cakey". I am not sure how to achieve this, but I did love these cookies!

I thought that it was me but after reading other reviews I see that I did not mess anything up to yield the sticky battery mess that I wound up with.  the ones I "pushed down" came out flat and ugly.  the next round I didn't push down and they came out more cookie like but not as pretty as the picture on the recipe.  still, I'll make them again, they were delicious

Such an easy recipe and so amazing! I flattened mine with the back of a soup spoon which kept them a beautiful shape. With my oven, I had to take them out a little earlier to keep them softer. Soft or crispier - they are delicious all around.

I realize I'm in the minority here, but these weren't my favorite.  They were just ok.  Almost a bit too spicy for me- I think I would've liked them better with 1/2 the amount of ginger.  The dough was also pretty sticky, but no worse than a soft sugar cookie dough.

These were just ok for me.  I think I would have liked them better if I overbaked them and they were crunchy.  Like others have mentioned, the texture is weird.  Yes, it's soft, but it's almost an underbaked sort of softness.  I think I will stick with a gingerbread kind of cookie next time.

These are really good. Just as ginger cookie should be! The only thing i did different, was add 1/2 cup of bite size candied ginger pieces to the mix. I squished them a little thinner than what i wanted the final cookie to be because they did puff up in the oven.

DELISH!  Really, really great cookie.  They were soft and chewy and had the perfect combination of flavors.  They stayed fresh and moist.  I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing.

Best gingerbread cookies I've ever had! Subbed orange juice for the water and had to bake a little longer because I balled them up a big bigger than necessary. Still awesome! I'd like to add that the sugar does seems to be a bit much and leaves an aftertaste. My boyfriend called them sugar cookies. Makes me think that these should be called Big Soft Sugar Ginger cookies instead!

My favorite cookie. Lots of ginger taste. Stayed chewy. The dough was soft so I spread them in a pan and made bar cookies. No matter because they were extra good that way too. Only recipe variation was my use of sweet butter and not margarine. I always use sweet butter for baking.

I noticed someone only gave 4 stars b/c they turned out crumbly and they said they used Splenda instead of brown sugar, Splenda definitely makes things crumbly,it doesn't absorb moisture like sugar. This is a great cookie, I use 1/2 C. + 1 Tbls. cooking oil instead of 3/4 C.  butter/margarine for a healthier fat! The consistency is still "big and soft".

Amazing Cookie Recipe!  I'm a chocoholic but these are hands down my new favorite cookie recipe.  The abundant spices are so refreshing!  Definitely hazardous to your health to make as they won't stick around long at all.  I did make one personal adjustment= I'm allergic to molasses so I simply used 3/4 c. dark corn syrup instead.  They were still fantastic!

These are very soft, perfect texture! They have a very good taste, but they are a littlllee bitt too spicey for me. I suggest refrigerating the dough for a bit so they are easier to work with!

I saved this recipe with my Nanna in mind over 3 years ago, but had not tried it.. I have just re-discovered it in my collection and thought I'd give it a try. It is WITHOUT A DOUBT the BEST cookie recipe I have made (and I've made a few!). The cookies were all perfectly even in size and the dough consistency was not greasy OR sticky. (I'm not sure whether that had something to do with my metric conversion, but it was perfect). The only thing I did differently, was to just dip the top of the balls in cinnamon/sugar before flattening and not coating the entire cookie. As titled, big, soft, beautiful, and just lightly spiced cookies. Perhaps Nan will even get to taste some outta the next batch ;) THANKS FOR POSTING!

Beeing a kitchen newbie I decided to try this recipe and I can't say it went wrong but... On the 1st attempt there was no way I could roll them on my hands.  The dough was too sticky.  I ended up using 2 spoons to lay the dough on the cooking sheet. On the 2nd attempt I let the dough on the fridge for a couple hours and I used oil to rub my palms with, and yes I could make nice balls that I could lay on the cooking sheet. Unfortunatly on both ocasions a few seconds after they start to melt and end up glueing together becoming one big flat cookie *grin* Well on 2nd attempt I used less dough on each and spreaded them farther apart. Question: Is that normal the dough to be sticky ? Why do they melt and get flat ? I used honey insteed of molasses The real question: How do I get the cookies to look like the ones in the picture ?

Amazing cookies!  I use fresh ground ginger (2 tsp), orange juice (or orange liqueur) instead of water, I don't use cloves but use a touch nutmeg if I have it.  The baking trick: when you take them out after 8-10 minutes, they do not look ready, but after sitting for a few minutes the cookies set and become incredibly soft and delicious cookies! I've made them a number of times and they are always a hit!

Delicious! My cookies came out pretty soft--more cake-like than cookie-like, and they were wonderful. I don't eat eggs so I used egg replacer for that. Also, I didn't have any molasses so I substituted 1/8 cup honey with just under 1/8 cup brown sugar. Other than those two adjustments, I followed the recipe exactly. Thanks so much for the recipe!

Had never made ginger cookies before so I tried out this recipe. Made it vegan with some alterations and they came out perfect!  Dough wasnt sticky and they stayed nice and soft after being baked; even though they were all gone the first day I made them!

I love these!  I whipped them up in no time and just happened to have everything I needed.  I ran out of AP flour so more than a cup and a half of the flour is wheat flour, but seeing as I haven't made them the "real" way I don't know what difference it made.  Delicious!  (Even my husband likes them and he's not a huge fan of the Ginger Cookie.) Cheers!

Great cookies.  Can substitute brown for white suger.  I used OJ instead of water.  I put the dough in freezer for 30 minutes to set so not too gooey to work with.  Don't flaten to bake.  These cookies make really yummy homemade ice cream sandwiches, espeically around thanksgiving.

I changed a few things: I/2 cup butter ( no margarine) and less sugar as well, 3/4 cup, 1/8 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp cloves. I used half all-purpose and half light spelt flour. I found the cookies had more crackle if I only SLIGHTLY flattened them. Also, I let dough sit in fridge for 2 hours to make handling perfect. They came out lighter in colour but lovely.

These are fabulous.  They are very soft.  They are delicious.  I've never seen my husband eat many of the store-bought ginger cookies, but these, he ate all the time.  I am going to make them again for his birthday in two weeks.  I highly recommend that you try this recipe.

This is a perfect recipe, with a couple of notes: (1) just say no to margarine-use butter, please; and (2) be sure to flatten these a bit more than slightly (recipe doesn't stress that enough).  Also, pay attention to what the recipe says and do store them in an air-tight container--that is, if you have any left.  They are superb.

Wow!  Great recipe!  The cookies turned out moist and delicious.  Perfect blend of spices.  I used the orange juice as suggested by some others, and it really made a difference.  Thanks so much! :)

Ginger cookies are not my thing - I'll be honest. I'd rate this recipe 3 stars, but since my family loves it and would rate it 5, I thought I'd compromise on 4. I think if you like ginger, you'll like these.

Nice simple cookie.  I used fresh orange juice instead of water and date syrup instead of molasses.  My five year old helped so the balls ended up quite small and thus crispy.  Both young children loved them as did I.

these come out pretty awesome. if you want to mix it up, add in half a teaspoon of orange extract, and half a bag of chocolate chips. i get rave reviews whenever i make them, and they're always the new favorite cookie of whoever i share them with :)

These tasted great, however, I think the taste of cloves overpassed the tatse of ginger. next time i guess i'll increase the ginger.  I followed the suggestions of other users and added a tbsp of orange juice. I also used half brown sugar and half whit sugar and subsituted the butter with corn oil.  freezing/refrigirating the mix is a great way to form those cookies.

ADDICTING!!!!  I make these often for my husband and I....the boys don't care for them.  Anywho, I am always trying to up the nutritional value and used half whole wheat flour and backed off the amount of sugar.  Still a winner with my DH.  Yummy!

These were great cookies. Don't forget to flatten the cookies, because they won't really do it themselves. I didn't have mace, so I used a little nutmeg and allspice (about 1/8 teaspoon of each) as a replacement. Be sure to measure your spices accurately, because if you don't you'll get cookies with too strong a flavor. I wanted butter, so I used half shortening and half butter. I melted the butter before to make sure the cookie stayed chewy. Instead of the 1 cup of white sugar, I used about 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar and added some honey to the recipe.

Not a bad cookie, but I won't make it again. The cookies flattened out too much and weren't very pretty to serve. They tasted fine, but they needed a little something extra to make them great cookies.

These cookies are FANTASTIC!!! There is absolutely no need to look for a better recipe as this one would be incredibly hard to beat. We used butter instead of margarine and doubled the ginger since we like really spicy cookies. On the second batch we substituted rum for the water and that was a really  nice addition too.  Thanks for the recipe - we'll be making these on a regular basis!

I'm not sure if I did something wrong, but these did not turn out very soft and they did not even taste that good.  I'm going to give them another try, but was not impressed the first time around.

Made these cookies for a cookie club.  They have just the right amount of spice and moisture.  Everyone who has tasted them has begged me for the recipe.  I agree with a previous reviewer...do not make these if you are on a cookie diet.  One way of quality control is if I want to eat more than two.  Lets just say I am on my 6th...I think I'm in trouble.

Great results every time.  I use slightly less water and an extra tablespoon of flour to reduce the stickiness.

These were a huge hit!  I couldn't find my usual gingersnap recipe so I made these instead based on the excellent reviews.  Needless to say, I was not disappointed and will not be going back to my old recipe!  These were exactly as the title says "big soft ginger cookies" and I will definitely be making these again.

I have made these cookies for a few years now, and always get rave reviews.  I follow the recipe exactly - no changes or additions. YUM! Even my youngest son, who is a very picky eater, LOVES these cookies. I use a small cookie scoop and drop the cookie dough into the sugar, roll it around , and put it on the cookie sheet.  They turn out perfect. Our favorite holiday cookie.

Fan-tab-u-lous!  My elderly father was convinced they were HIS grandmothers recipe!  I loved telling him they were and then watching him reminisce about how "gram made these cookies the size of a coffee can!"  Amazing how food can evoke such memories!  A definite keeper for my recipe box!

Absolutely delicious cookies.  Loved them.  Used butter in lieu of margarine but otherwise followed the recipe exactly and they turned out wonderful.  I'd suggest baking a few to see how much (or little) you need to press down the ball of dough to get the thickness and texture you like.  Some people like thicker and chewier whereas others like thinner and crisper.   I tihnk alot depends on your oven, altitude, etc. as to how they come out.  Overall a great recipe - especially for the holidays.

Everyone raves about these cookies whenever I make them.  I always make an icing with confectioners sugar, vanilla extract and water and drizzle the cookies.  Yummy!

I was not sure if these would work out since there were several 1-star horror stories, but they are near perfect (no crackled top like the picture).  I used 1c all-purpose and 1 1/4c whole wheat, used 1T oj in place of the called for water, an additional 2T water since I was using whole wheat, used 2/3 c of sugar as suggested by another reivewer, and baked for exactly 10 min.  I rolled 18 balls (the remaining 6 were probably stuck to my hands), rolled in sugar, and lightly pressed down.  They did expand and baked flat (not baked cookie balls like another reviewer).  Like another reivewr, even after reducing the sugar the cookies were still too sweet.  Next time I will use 1/2c sugar instead-- rolling in sugar adds a lot of sweetness already, and try fresh ginger.  Thanks for the recipe. How do you get the cookie to crackle??

I love ginger cookies---but I always have to buy them a day or two ahead and leave them open on the counter to get them soft; hard cookies (other than biscotti) just aren't my thing. These are PERFECT. Soft and a nice spice from the amount of ginger in the recipe.

Very yummy, but I wish that I had cooked them for a little longer, because some of them were "ultra-chewy" (almost raw) in the middle.  But the flavor was excellent!

GREAT COOKIE!! I used dark brown sugar in place of the white. Preferred the cookies without extra sugar on the cookie. I found them too be a little too sweet. Followed the other suggestions and used oj in place of water and butter instead of margarine. Definitely refrigerate dough prior to forming balls.

I've never made a ginger cookie before, and I am not one to really eat ginger cookies, but these are AWESOME!!! I did make a few very minor changes...I used about half white whole wheat flour, used 3 teaspoons of ginger and 2 teaspoons on cinnamon and omitted the cloves because I didn't have any. I also used half brown sugar for the sugar and rolled the dough in raw sugar. Sounds like a lot of changes, but not really. These were so good and my husband LOVED them. Thanks for the awesome recipe, I'm sure it will be made often, not ust for Christmas ;)

These cookies are the best cookies I've ever had!!! My mom made them and they were awesome.      My brother complains about all my mom's cooking and he likes them + my mom is a horrible cook and they were tasty. So if you make these I guarantee a delicious snack!!!

Great recipe! Everyone asks me for the recipe when I make these. I like to used fresh ground ginger root (or from a jar) because I like the ginger to shine through. I also added nutmeg for some depth. One of my favorite cookies now!

I followed this recipe exactly, only I doubled it. Even though I used real margarine and not butter, the cookies spread out flat and didn't look anything like the picture. They did taste very good and were soft. I just wonder what I should do the next time to get a fluffier, crackled cookie? Any ideas?

The ratings are right...these cookies are a really nice change from your standard chocolate chip! Very soft, and great spice flavor.  I subbed 1/4 c. crisco for part of the butter - I didn't want them to spread too much.

These cookies are delicious! Everyone I gave them to loved them. They are so soft and yummy. I took other reviewers advice and used the orange juice and let the dough chill before I tried to roll them. I have made 3 batches in a week. They are a great Christmas cookie.

I always follow recipes exactly, so I don't know why this one didn't turn out for me.  My dough was soo sticky.  Even after chilling it.  They didn't taste as gingery too me as I expected.  Maybe I was thinking of ginger snaps.  They were more like molasses cookies.  They didn't look anything like the picture.  Maybe I was having bad cookie kharma, but I've never had a cookie recipe turn out such a flop.  Sorry.

So So So good!  Definately soft and delicious, with just the right amount of spice.  I rolled these in course sanding sugar so the cookies kind of sparkled when they came out.  Perfect!

I'm not the biggest fan of molasses and gingerbread type cookies, but these are a huge, huge, HUGE exception.  Oh wow!  Beware, these disappear very quickly.

I added a simple sugar-water-cinnamon glaze to drizzle on top for extra style and flavor. Fantastic.

The flavor was exactly what i was hoping for.  However, halfway through baking these, i realized i forgot to use oj, as some readers had suggested!  oh well, next time!  i made these for a holiday cookie exchange, so i rolled them in homemade colored sugar.  why did the red ones rise perfectly and the green ones stay flat and greasy?  they both came from the exact same dough that was chilled between batches.  So strange!  Any thoughts?

Just awesome. Mine flattened perfectly and were tender and soft. I'm at the 6500 ft level, so I did add 2T extra flour. They looked so pretty my husband thought they were store bought! Wonderful flavor. Loved them.

These are fantastic cookies!  I followed the recipes exactly as written except I supstituted crisco butter flavored shortening for the butter and used 1/2 splenda and 1/2 sugar. I used a small cookie  scoop to make the cookies uniform size before I rolled in the sugar, and found that they didn't flatten as much while baking.  I gently flattened them with the bottom of a clean glass!   Will be making these again!

These cookies were frustrating. My dough was just slightly on the crumbly side so I don't know how some cooks got a gooey dough. Plus I only flattened lightly like I would a peanut butter cookie and they didn't spread at all.

Sooo good! I made a double batch and took the idea of using orange juice instead of water! They turned out wonderful!! Even my son eat them and he is very picky, he won't even eat choc. chip cookies but he LOVES these! The only thing I thought was that they needed more sugar stuck to the outside, Just my personal taste. I will make these again and again!!!!

Delicious! Replacing water with OJ makes a difference and I love how the OJ brings out the flavor. I have made these BIG and I've used the small scoop for little cookies too. I drizzle with vanilla icing for a pretty presentation. They turn out great and I receive multiple positive comments from co-workers and family alike. Easy to portion out the dough and freeze until needed. This is my new signature cookie. Thank you!

These are the best, simple gingersnaps you can make.  They don't try to be too fancy.  They're just awesome!!  My mom asked me for the recipe, and she is the "cookie master" in my family.  I used butter instead of margarine, and it was great.  I recommend butter.

My husband and father in law are not ginger cookie fans, but neither of them could stop eating these! I used real butter and my hand blender was broken so I mixed it with the sugar by hand.  Cookies still turned out perfect! Definitely bringing these to the holiday cookie exchange.

I was in a rush, and hate using margarine, so I decided to make these as oil-based bars. I used 2/3 c. oil, added 1 T. vanilla, used half brown sugar and half white, and juice instead of water. I made one and a half time the recipe for a 9x13 pan and baked it for about 1/2 an hour. The result was a very flavorful, dense bar that was amazing with a glass of milk.

These cookies really live up to their name. They are big, soft and so good! I took the advice of others and let them chill for awhile so that I could handle the dough more easily and I also patted them down prior to baking. I will be making them again for Christmas!

What's a girl gotta do to get cracks in her cookies?But no matter, these were great. I left them in the oven a few minutes overtime and they turned out w/ crunchy edges and a soft center - yum! I ran out of white sugar to roll them in so I used brown sugar... I do not recommend this because it tends to clump on theoutsideand does not look attractive (cookie acne?) Anyways, off to make another batch. Lovely recipe, thank you!

These taste like the holidays! DO NOT smash these down unless you have refrigerated the dough for a looong time and it is really stiff.  I did and my dough was too soft - disaster!

Wonderful!  I used my cookie scoop, dropped the cookies into a bowl of sugar, tossed around, then placed on cookie sheet and slightly pressed down to flatten. They were beautiful.  I didn't notice the dough being too sticky to work with.  My family has already eaten 18 of the cookies made.

I find baking quite difficult and profess to being better at main dishes.  Living in Austria one needs to get festive and bake Christmas cookies, so I am having a go this year.  I have to say that these cookies turned out fantastic... a nice twist to the local lebkuchen tradition and I will bake them for sure again!

I make these cookies every Christmas season! Theyre amazing and sooooo yummy.  I keep ALL of the ingredients exactly the same but refridgerate the dough for up to 3 hours to really get it nice and firm since it is a very soft and ticky dough. Ive read reviews where people used butter instead of margarine, Ive made this mistake once before also..after all isnt butter better? Well not for these cookies! Think about butter and margarine in their cold refridgerated state, margarine is soft and butter is hard-hence the super soft sticky dough and why chilling dough is very helpful. The margarine, I think helps to lend to the soft chewiness of the cookie, while the butter makes them more on the crispy, crunchy side. 
I also use a cookie scooper for even sized cookies and I als flatten the rounds of dogh slightly before baking.  These are truley amazing, a a must-try even if you dont like ginger or molasses!

Fantastic cookies! I used brown sugar instead of molasses (1 C molasses = 3/4 C brown sugar) and had no problems with dough stickiness. I will definitely be making these again!

As a cook who has the utmost confidence in trying any savory dish- but is intimidated by any baking recipe- I was hesitant to try making homemade cookies less than 12 hours before I was to prepare and serve the usual huge Thanksgiving feast.  However, this recipe is very easy and turned out fantastic!  I tasted the batter after it was mixed and felt that it needed a bit more flavor, so I added about 1/3 cup of brown sugar.  Very tasty, very soft cookies with the perfect complementing flavor for holiday dishes!

Made these for Thanksgiving dessert. Taste is great but turned out rather thin!? Not thick and crackled like in the photo. Will try them again soon. Perhaps more flour??

AMAZING - dough was initially VERY goopy so i left it in the fridge overnight. Spooned little balls of dough directly into sugar and then rolled into perfect balls. Transferred to baking sheet and then flattened. I'm in love with these cookies and the smell coming from the oven really gets you in the holiday spirit.

mmmmmmmm, good!!!!  I had to substitute margarine for butter (just because I don't think margarine in cookies is right)  and didn't have cloves on hand.  Also, Sugar in the Raw, instead of white sugar on top. I followed others advice and used orange juice instead of water.  They are fabulous!  Thank you!

Awesome reipe, in fact, the best ginger anything recipe I have found thus far. I agree about the orange juice suggestion, I tried them boths ways (with and without) and the general opinion was the OJ ones were better, it seems to enhance the spice falvors. I also had an issue with the batter, but only in that the cookies nearly quadrupled in size every time! I made the dough balls less than half an inch each time and they come out like four inch cookies! We don't mind! They are so good, having a big cookie is ok!

Incredible!  Once I mixed up all ingredients, I dropped the dough onto siran wrap, covered it and shaped into a log.  Then, I let the log sit in the freezer for 30 mins, sliced and onto cookie sheets.  Baked 10 mins .. perfect!!  YUM!!

amazing...I can't stop eating them.  I didn't have molasses so I used brown sugar that I dissolved in some water instead.  And instead of cloves I had a pinch of nutmeg.  They came out huge and the softest cookies I've ever made!

They tasted good (I got rave reviews) but they spread out really thin and didn't plump up quite like I'd expected.  I'm not sure what went wrong--- the dough was quite sticky and hard to form into a ball.  I will try again!

Great cookies that remind me of my Grandma-Her's weren't so soft though - more crunchy- Any ideas? and it seems like the margarine today has so much water in it? But these were great soft ginger cookies! Will definately be making batches to share with neighbors for the holidays!

These had a great flavor and texture, but mine were flatter than I expected  and did not have that nice, "crinkly" top as shown in the photo.  Any idea what I did wrong?

A good ginger cookie.  I definitely recommend chilling the dough for at least an hour before rolling, I chilled my batch for about 15 mins and it was still very difficult to work with.  I also think I flattened out the cookies TOO much - they came out very flat and large...and didn't look as nice as the picture.

Awesome cookies- much flatter than I thought they would be- but still very soft! One of the pics shows them filled- but I didn't find any reviews talking about it... So I used the whipped cream cheese frosting recipe and made cookie sandwiches- turned out really good! I recommend these filled or not- but filled was really delectable!!!

The only alterations I made to these were using 1/3 cup Brown Sugar with 2/3 White Sugar and 1/4 cup Butter with 1/2 cup Margarine and placed the dough in the fridge for 20 minutes (I made these alterations by preference and reviews).  When shaping the dough I flattened them a bit before 'flipping' them in sugar so they would be wide and they turned out fabulous!  There's no airtight jar needed!  They might feel hard outside when a day old (if they last that long) but they melt in your mouth!!  Some might say they are too sweet but the sugar is a great contrast to the mild yet flavorful spices.

These are great cookies! The only thing I have to complain is that the dough is very, very sticky and that makes it difficult to form the "walnut-sized balls". MY TIP: put the dough in the fridge for 5-10 minutes before forming the balls; it won't stick to you as easily and the dough is much easier to work with. AND: instead of rolling the dough balls IN the sugar; just sprinkle it on the dough before it goes into the oven and it will cut down on the sweetness. All in all a very good cookie.

These are amazing cookies!!  I have never been a big fan of "gingerbread" but I have been dreaming of these since I made them last weekend.  They are bliss with a cup of coffee.  I used a small scoop and got 4 dzn cookies.  I did add an extra 1/4 cup of flour.  I did not roll them in sugar and thought they were perfect!!

These were a hit at my family Halloween party! The only thing I changed was using light brown sugar, instead of white. I might even try dark brown sugar, or 1/2 a cup of each next time! Yum!!

Made exactly as written and they are an awesome fall cookie!  My four-year-old used cookie cutters and made some fun shapes.  My husband says that they taste like pumpkin pie!  It did help to cool the dough before working with it.

These are awesome. I ditched my Mom's molasses cookie recipe I'd used for 20 years and these are the only ones I make now.  I follow the suggestion of other reviewers and use orange juice instead of water.

Ok, so I agree with most of the reviewers.  This cookie recipe is great.  The cookie has the perfect balance of spices and is exactly what it says...soft ginger cookies...and they stayed soft, which I like.  I do agree that they become VERY flat.  I also had to bake mine much longer because I chose to make them bigger.  I love trying different spice cookie recipes, and I really liked this one.  I am not sure why they show the picture with icing on the cookie, yet that is not included anywhere in the recipe.  I just used sprinkling sugar on mine.  Enjoy this recipe!!

These were delicious.  They stayed soft for a long time.  I just wish there was more mollases in the mix.  I really like my gingerbread with that distinct taste.  I was too afraid to put more in myself and risk messing up the consistency.

These cookies are amazing and addictive!  They are the perfect autumn cookie.  I added a little flour (less than 1/4 cup), went a little heavy on the cinnamon and cloves, used real butter, and used 2 tablespoons of Myer's Dark Rum instead of the 1 tablespoon of water.  I didn't roll in sugar -- these are sweet enough without it.

Best ginger cookies EVER! I have baked these for everything from holidays to birthdays and even a funeral. I do suggest letting the dough sit for an hour or 2 in the fridge before forming into balls - otherwise i think these are perfect!

WOW!  I followed lots of the good advice to make this great recipe even better, and a few of my own twists:  *Increased flour to 2 1/2 cups *Used OJ instead of water *Increased cinnamon to a full teaspoon *Added 1 teaspoon vanilla *Used butter (had it in the house) *Used brown sugar in place of white *Added 1/4 teaspoon almond extract *Added a pinch of nutmeg  *Chilled dough and used a melon baller for uniform size.  *Simply dipped the tops of the dough balls in colored sugar/Halloween sprinkles.  FANTASTIC results!

What a great recipe!  The balance of spices is just right.  No need to jack this recipe up!  The addition of an icing really tops off the cookie, though it's not listed on the recipe.  The dough was not sticky at all, but using a cookie scoop is always a great idea for getting a consistent-sized cookie.  Bravo Amy1028!

These were delicious, and the aroma was heavenly!  They were very moist and chewy.  I didn't change the spices, but they were almost perfect.  I will add a bit more cinnamon next time.  I liked that these didn't have too strong of a spicy or molasses flavor.  I did use OJ instead of water.  My only problem with the recipe is that my cookies spread so much that they were very thin and flat.  I am positively ANAL when it comes to measuring (I level the flour with a straight edge, etc.), so I know it wasn't anything I did.  I think a little more flour (about 1/4 C) might do the trick.  Or, possibly a little less sugar.  It would also be nice to find some coarse sugar to roll them in for an even prettier presentation.  Next time, I will definitely double the recipe, because they didn't last long!

These cookies were delicious. No doubt that they are big & soft and irresistable.  Thanks for the tip about flattening the cookies more than "slightly." Also, the other tip from some of the reviewers about putting the cookie dough in the freezer for about 25 minutes made a WORLD of difference.  I made a double batch and subsitituted a bit of the white granulated sugar with brown sugar, just a little bit.  I made a glaze about 1/4 of the cookies. But, didn't think it was necessary because they were so delicious!!!! AMAZING!!!!

Pretty good - but i modified the recipe so next time I think i'll try what's written. This time around, I used butter, 1/2 c brown sugar and 1/2 cup white, spiced rum for the water, and added a splash of vanilla. For rolling, I sprayed a scoop (a bit bigger han a meon baller) with Pam and dropped right into the sugar. It worked well and I didn't have to wait for the dough to chill. Will definitely try again,.

These cookies are absolutely delicious! I am a big fan of ginger and these are simply mouth watering! Instead of using margarine i used butter and for the white sugar I used 1 cup brown sugar. I did not pack in the sugar because I didn't want them to be too sweet. I also omitted rolling the dough in the 2 tablespoons of sugar and baked them for only 9 minutes. They turned out great!

What a true DELIGHT! These are perfect. I am not a fan of ginger cookies at all, but my husband has been begging me to make some...WOW! I LOVE them. I liked the dough, I liked the cookies hot, just out of the oven and I liked them 4 days old and almost ctunchy! They are SUPER yummy. Thanks Amy :).

These are the best ginger cookies I have EVER HAD!!! Of course I changed it a bit. I added a half less of cloves, my husband doesn't like the taste of cloves. But they were fantastic!! The best part was I accidentally left a few over night not in a container (I live in a dry dry dry climate) and was afraid to find them rock hard in the morning. Amazingly enough they were still soft and delicious. Thank you, thank you!

Not bad at all.  The cloves weren't overwhelming for me as some reviewers complained, but I really like spicy gingerbread cookies.  I swapped spiced rum for the water, which I really enjoyed.  The flavor of these cookies was excellent, and the texture was nice and soft.  I flattened them a bit as instructed, and they came out of the oven absolutely beautiful, but they flattened quite a bit while cooling - as flat as a ginger snap, though they somehow maintained their softness.  Odd.  I'll likely make these again, but I'd love to figure out how to make them less flat.  I don't want "dough balls" as other reviewers complained of, but I'd like something with a little volume.  Thanks for the recipe.

Made these cookies several days ago, and they are still fresh/soft/chewy. I have read some reviews c/o the flavors being too overwhelming. I personally do not like cloves, so I substituted "allspice" instead. Awesome flavor. Definitely refrigerate the cookies for about 1/2 hour to an hour before rolling.

Pretty good. I added butterscotch chips to give it a little extra texture and what a great move!

These tasted great, but the dough was way too sticky.  My mom has made the same recipe (minus the water) for years.  Hers calls for refrigerating the dough at least an hour before baking.

Excellent! These cookies had just the right mix of spices. Very tasty. I made the balls a little smaller and got 3 dozen instead of 2.  Nick's favorite and are always requested in our house.

OK...I never gave up on finding a great ginger cookie, time and time again I was disappointed.  NOT THIS TIME!!!!  Oh My Peas!!  This is a great cookie.  My 4 yr old daughter - held up the cookie and said it was the best cookie she ever ate!!!  I didn't roll them in sugar, they were plenty sweet without the extra sugar.  Since we live in Hawaii and it's September (still summer hot) I put the dough in the freezer before using my cookie scooper and then flattening with the palm of my hand - this was what worked the best.  Thank you so much for the fabulous cookies!

These are wonderful! I didn't have access to an electric mixer, so I had to mix them by hand. This made them more dense, but still good. As mentioned by almost every other reviewer - these are super sticky. I would definitely suggest refrigerating awhile before rolling out the dough.

Made this cookie w/ 2 girl scouts following the recipe and they came out excellent.  The girls even enjoyed the cookies.   We did not frost them we rolled it in sugar like the recipe called for.  Will definitely make them again!

After these cookies come out of the oven, well, the don't taste that good. I can't really explain the taste, only that it feels like the flavours haven't settled and meshed together yet. But the second day, these ginger cookies were really good! I'll definately be making these again.

they have a great flavor but they are way sticky to work with. I added 1 1/2 cups more flour and they were still way sticky, but the end result is perfect.

I enjoyed the spices and my husband really enjoyed eating the cookies with icecream. I let the mix sit for 30 minutes so it was less goopy. I still couldn't make balls... My only real problem was that the cookies came out super flat. Next time, i'll flatten them less and leave them in the oven a smidge longer. These cookies were great and make my top 10... maybe top 5 if I make them right next time.

I was super excited about making these cookies as I love all things "spicy" - cinnamon, cloves, pumpkin spice, etc. However, the molasses seemed a bit heavy - especially right after I made the cookies - the smell along was pretty pervasive. I would probably reduce the molasses some next time. They tasted much better the next day (to me at least). I will definitely make them again!

After trying another recipe that was a complete failure, this one is lovely.  I used OJ instead of water and pammed the measure for the molasses (that worked good!)  I did refrigerate the dough over night so it was not sticky. I greased the cookie sheet, and after I flattened them slightly, I sprinkled the top with a little ginger/sugar.  Yummy cookies and just nicely soft.

I would give this recipe five stars, but my kids argued for four.  They think the cookies turned out too dry - I followed the recipe exactly with no changes.  I think they are very good - an absolute "add" to my personal recipe box!

I have no idea where it went wrong. i followed the directions to the T. I was so excited for this recipe but, when i made it i knew something was wrong when the batter was cake like and the cookies came out cakey too. I changed the water to orange juice like someone had suggested and that is the only change i made. Besides the fact that these were cakey instead of chewy and soft they were absolutly fantastic. I will make them again and try to see where i went wrong in the recipe!

Just thinking of these cookies always makes my mouth water. I love ginger cookies and these are absolutely fantastic. I used butter instead of margarine to help them flatten more and made some other changes just based on other peoples reviews, such as changing the cup of white sugar to brown sugar, and the cloves to nutmeg.

I am actually baking these cookies as I write this review.  I cheated and tried one a couple of minutes out of the oven.  One word - OUTSTANDING!  I used the orange juice in place of the water and I also used another reviewer's advice and put the dough right into the sugar and rolled them like that - much less sticky.  I made them a little smaller than suggested and it looks like I'll get about 3 dozen cookies - and they are plenty big.  Thanks for the great recipe!  Addendum:  My grandson came to visit and I was sure he wouldn't like such a spicey cookie.  Boy, was I wrong!  He asked for these daily.  I am baking some more and sending them to him!

AWESOME! I didn't change a thing!  I put the dough in the fridge for a long time on accident but they still turned out good. I flattened some and didn't flatten others and I actually liked the non-flattened ones better. They turned out picture perfect!  Before I baked them I rolled each ball in white sugar.  AWESOME!

...to debunk a complaint..wait 5 min to roll into 3/4 inch balls. they are sticky till you drop them in sugar...we are making sweet things...work gets sticky sometimes :)  use fingertips to roll into balls and drop in sugar..easy to handle at that point. Used OJ vs water.   going to drizzle with cream cheese vanilla icing   just ate my 1st one...friggin great cookie...icing not needed but if you want to hit a home run...drizzle with above.

These are awesome, just as written. Love them warm, cooled, or straight out of the freezer in the summer. Yummy!

This is my all time favorite cookie.  They stay soft and have the best flavor! This is the cookie I make when it's my turn in the house to choose our treat!  I use the orange juice instead of water too....I have even made a glaze out of powdered sugar and orange juice.  The best!

I do not like the consistency of these cookies.  I was expecting them to be soft like a snickerdoodle but they were more like a muffin consistency.  Way too soft for a cookie.  The taste, however, is EXCELLENT!  I followed the recommendation of others and added orange liquor (I didn't have orange juice) instead of the water.  I froze the dough so that it would be easier to form them.  And I made a sugar cookie glaze with orange extract to go on top. As good as they taste, I probably won't eat them because the texture is so off-putting to me.

I followed the recipe exactly as written.  I liked the flavour, but for some reason I found the dough a bit tough to work with, they weren't as soft as I had hoped.  I will try again

These have a good flavor and texture.  I used unsalted butter in place of the margarine and increased the salt a bit.  Next time I might add more cinnamon & cloves, but they're great as is.  Would also be good for ice cream sandwiches!

Fabulous.. Be warned.. if you eat them while they are still warm.. you will get a tummy ache from eating too many.  KILLER good warm out of the oven.  Almost too good.  A massive diet killer and worth every bite!

Amazing cookies.  The combination of spices is just right....none of them overpowering.  They seemed to taste even better after sitting for a few hours, however, most of them didn't last long enough to find out.  Most of the family don't even like ginger but with just a hint of it the cookies didn't last too long.  This has moved into my recipe box.

These cookies are wonderful!  I used orange juice in place of the water, chilled the dough for easier handling, baked for 8 minutes, and glazed the cooled cookies with a mixture of powdered sugar and orange juice.  They stayed really soft, and tasted great--buttery and full of flavor.  I'll be making them again soon!

Made these the other night with my daughters.  These are the best cookies I have ever made.  I would suggest however, sprinkling a little sugar on the top, before baking.

These cookies had a really good flavor, but I was disappointed by their appearance.  I don't like using margerine, so I replaced it with butter.  Maybe that was why they were flat and thin.  I took another reviewer's suggestion and replaced the water with orange juice.  In my case I had a blood orange, so I squeezed that.

This is a great recipe.  We all loved the cookies.  Since I did not have dried ginger, I used grated fresh ginger.  I did not roll the entire cookie in the sugar.  I only rolled the tops of the cookies.  There is no need to flatten the cookies since they flatten out on their own in the oven.  I used 1/2 cup of butter and 1/4 cup of crisco for the shortening.

Excellent cookie, and very easy to make. Instead of rolling them in sugar, I sprinkled the tops after I flattened them with a little crystal sugar. Not as sweet, but still gives it that satisfying crunch. thanks so much!

Yummy!  I let the dough sit b/c it was a bit messy to work with.  I also sprayed my hands with spray-oil to make it easier rolling the balls.  I also used the spray in the measuring cup before pouring in the molasses.  I used 1/2 c. butter and 1/3 c. margarine.  Instead of rolling the balls into the sugar, I topped the cookies with 'sugar in the raw'.

These really are good. They're soft, and lightly spicy.  The dough is sticky when it is first mixed, but after it sits a few minutes, it rolls easily into balls.

These cookies are exactly as billed: big, soft, gingery; that's why they're getting 5 stars. However, if you're looking for a recipe with a more defined texture, try our family favourite--Grandma's Gingersnap Cookies.

I made with whole wheat flour instead of regular and they turned out great! I went heavy on the molasses and skipped the extra dousing of sugar at the end.

Love them...and I didn't even have molasses. I had to substitute 1/4 cup of maple syrup and 1 tbsp of honey for the molasses.  I left out the 1 tbsp of water. Super soft and delicious.  I did freeze the dough for 30 minutes for easier handling. My family thanks you for the recipe.  Will try next time with molasses. Update: I tried it as written, except, left out the water, and they were wonderful!  I made a glaze with powdered sugar to drizzle over them. Love these!

When I used this recipe, the dough turned out messy and the cookies ended up tasty, but flat and very crumbly.  I made a new batch, this time using 3/4 cup olive oil (light flavor works best) instead of butter and only a little bit of orange juice instead of the 1 Tbsp water. Everything else was the same.   The dough was so much easier to roll into balls - I made mine walnut sized - and they came out perfectly crispy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. Yum!

These cookies are dangerous!  You will want to make these again and again.  Doubling the recipe also works well ;) I tried the orange juice substitution for H2O once but I didn't notice any difference.  I used butter instead of margarine since I never use margarine. I put the mixture in the freezer for about a half hour, as suggested by other users.  This really helps with forming the dough into balls.  I use one of those cookie dough scoops.   I've added crystallized ginger (probably about 1/4 cup chopped) to the mixture and also little bits to the tops before baking (squish em down into the top).  This is quite nice if you like crystallized ginger.

These came out great! I added orange juice instead of water and butter instead of margarine.  I did sift all of the dry ingredients. I slowly added the dry to the wet and made sure it was mixed pretty good before I added more dry ingredients. I used my kitchen aid mixer. I really like Grandma's Molasses original. I have made these several times and they come out perfect every time. Fantastic cookies! I made a simple frosting for the tops. The cookies got even softer the next day. They didn't last long.

I think there was a bit to much ginger or molassas, not sure which.  I did not have cloves, so i did not put it in, maybe thats why the taste was strong.  I also added a tsp of vanilla to my second batch, and that helped.  Also if you like flat, be sure to press them down really flat!  These are not my fav cookie though.

Followed the recipe exactly.  Turned out perfect and stayed soft for days.  Made 3 times and everyone that has one wants the recipe! I read reviews that said the dough was too gooey or runny.  One of the 3 times I made these, the dough was very gooey, DO NOT OVER SOFTEN THE BUTTER! If you do over soften the butter, just throw the dough in the fridge to cool and the dough will become firmer.  Once again, DO NOT OVER SOFTEN THE BUTTER!  Soften enough to mix, do not melt it down. LOVE LOVE THE RECIPE, don't change a thing!

I consider my cooking abilities to be better than average, but I have very little experience baking. I just made these cookies and they turned out AMAZING!!! Great recipe, thank you for posting it!! I made a frosting and drizzled it over the cookies once they had cooled which gave them a little finishing touch. (The frosting I whipped up was about 1 cup of powdered sugar, 1/2 teaspoon Vanilla extract, 1 Tablespoon of softened margarine, and then slowly add enough milk while whisking until the mixture turns to a frosting consistency. Too thin - add more powdered sugar. Too thick and clumpy - add more milk.)

absolutely delicious, even though I had to make a few substitutions:  I can't get molasses (live in europe) so I used honey Also, butter instead of margarine and I followed another reviewer's advice by using OJ instead of water.  The cookies took forever though, I had to bake for about 25-30 minutes, not 8.

Perfectly perfect ginger cookies! I substituted orange juice for the water just because everyone seems to think it makes a difference. I am not sure whether I can credit the OJ, but these cookies are so yummy! I found I had to cook them a touch more than the recommended time (I did the first batch for the recommended time and they came out a bit too "doughy" for my taste). Even with the extra time the cookies were soft and chewy. As recommended by other reviewers, I chilled the dough before rolling it into balls and I used brown sugar for the outside coating.

I made 12 dozen of these and everyone has raved about them!  I used butter instead of margarine and OJ instead of water.  As other reviewers recommended, chilling the dough an hour before shaping really helped.  I coated the tops only with sugar and pressed the balls very flat using a drinking glass dipped in sugar (to prevent sticking).  After they cooled I decorated them with white cookie decorating icing (the tube says "stackable," but don't stack unless you use wax paper - they'll stick to the icing below). I made snowflake designs and gave them away as gifts - beautiful and delicious!  Will make again every Christmas.

I love these cookies! I made them for a Christmas cookie swap party. Orginally I wanted to try to make Gingerbread men with the dough. That was a no go. The dough is too sticky for using a cookie cutter. Whoever wrote this recipe is not kidding when they tell you to only use a small amount of dough for each cookie. This things get huge. I used some cookie icing for decorating. Like I said I love these cookies and plan to make them every year.

Simply amazing!  This is now my new favorite holiday cookie over Snickerdoodles.  I make exactly as the recipe states.  I am a "super taster" and found no difference to using OJ instead of water.  Definitely put in the refrigerator to harden before rolling in sugar. YUMMY!!!!

Wonderful ginger cookie recipe! While the recipe's spice combination is great, I also added some nutmeg and allspice to the mix. I used whole-wheat flour and they still came out great. I would recommend chilling the dough for at least an hour as it is really sticky to work with. I rolled them into balls, dipped my fingers in sugar, and pressed the balls flat. I baked them for a little over 10 minutes, and they were soft in the middle and slightly crunchy on the outside. This one's a keeper!

Seriously?  These are the simply the best cookies ever.

The first time I made them the dough didn't turn out right.  I ended up adding a TON more flour which resulted in delicious cake-like cookies.  I was sure that that was NOT how these were supposed to be so I tried again using Crisco instead of butter.  They turned out absolutely perfect the second time.

TRY THESE COOKIES!

Addictive cookie!  We used Ener-G Egg Replacer due to egg allergies and we couldn't stop gobbling them up.  Five days after baking they were still soft.

Delicious!  I kept reducing the baking time on each batch and 6 1/2 minutes was good for my oven.   You have to take them out before they look done.  Thanks for this recipe!

These were great and very easy to make!  I followed the advice of past reviewers and replaced the water with orange juice.  I didn't find the dough hard to work with at all.  Hubby LOVES them and isn't a gingerbread cookie fan

The best ginger cookies I've ever made. I made a single batch and used a large cookie scoop dropping the dough directly into the sugar. Made about 28 large cookies. They turned out great. A new holiday favorite!

These cookies are simple to make, and even easier to eat!  I made it according to the recipe, and they turned out wonderful.  One thing to make a note of:  Make sure you press down the cookies before baking them.  I sort of read over that, and they barely flatten in the oven, so ours were more ball like than anything, but delicious none the less!  4.5 Stars.

These cookies are wonderful!  I added lemon juice instead of water and 1 Tablespoon of crystallized ginger.  I didn't bother flattening them.  They ended up flattening after I took them out of the oven.  Since I enjoy lemon ginger cookies, I decided to try a lemon glaze (1 3/4 c. powdered sugar, 2 Tablespoons melted butter, and 1/4 c. lemon juice).  They were wonderful with the glaze as well.  But if you enjoy gingersnaps, they are just perfect without the glaze.  A family favorite that we will definitely make again!

I had a hard time sharing these with my family.  My cookies don't usually turn out well, but these were absolutely perfect!  I followed the recipe exactly, and I wrapped the dough and kept in the refrigerator overnight.  It was very easy to work with and roll into balls the next day.  My family just loved these cookies.  I will make them again and again.

I used light butter in place of margarine... spiced it up a lot (to our taste preference) and also added chili powder. Chilled the dough for 45 minutes, and just spooned the dough on to a cookie sheet... sprinkled with red sugar and baked for 9 1/2 minutes.
They came out perfect. Delicious and so soft. Everyone loved them. I'm making another batch right now, but doubling.

These cookies are fabulous! Ginger things are not usually my cup of tea, but I was looking for something that was out of the usual "chocolate chip/sugar/peanut butter" range. I'm so glad I decided to make these! Though they came out flatter than I thought they would, they're the perfect sweet and spicy holiday cookie. I slightly increased the spices and only had to bake for 8 minutes. (8 minutes gave me a soft cookie with a chewy outside, 9 minutes chewy all the way through.) I put my dough into the freezer while I mixed dough for other cookies I was making and so didn't have a problem with rolling. I feel that the sugar for rolling wasn't necessary but it does make the end product sparkle prettily, so I may just cut the sugar in the dough next time I make these (and there WILL be a next time!) A lot of reviewers subbed OJ for the water and I didn't have any, so I used 2 tsp of water and 1 tsp of orange extract. Yum!

These cookies are amazing! I love them! I followed the recipe exactly, but did take the suggestions from others to refrigerate the dough for a bit before rolling into ballls. The dough was way too sticky for me before refrigeration. Other than that issue, which was easily fixed, these are PERFECT!

One of the best cookies I have ever had!  I was one of those who never liked the spice-type of cookies before trying this one, and now I'm hooked.  It makes your house smell like the holidays.  I also took one reviewer's suggestion and used some of the batch to make vanilla ice cream cookie sandwiches, and they were AMAZING.  Super recipe!

I absolutely love these! I am usually not a huge fan of ginger anything, but after making these I am hooked. They are the perfect mix of crispiness and soft. My husband loves them and he keeps sneaking into the kitchen when they come out of the oven...so I have to make more. I used the recipe to the letter except I did use the suggestion of some other people and used orange juice instead of water. They turned out great! I will be making them for years to come :D

This is one of the first and most tried and true cookie recipes on this website but I've made some modifications that I think will make this recipe even better! (see below). I've baked them before and was told that I put some kind of addictive drug in them. The only tricky thing about making these cookies is the rolling into a ball part. If you use margarine, your dough can be a bit too gooey to roll. I've added more flour, chilled the dough, neither really works well. Here's what I do, sub 1/4 cup of the margarine with butter. This makes it easy to form the dough. It's still sticky but the ball forms fine. I wouldn't use all butter because then the cookie gets too crispy and doesn't stay as soft. I also don't roll the dough in sugar at the end. I think the cookie has enough.
Edit: The last time I made these, I entered them in a cookie contest and lost (the cookies look deceptively plain)! THIS year I'm taking these cookies to the next level by adding: crushed pecans, dried cranberries, and orange rind (also subing fresh squeezed OJ for water) and they came out great! I hope I win the contest this year! I call these cookies GPCs for Ginger Pecan Cranberry.

These are THE BEST ginger cookies!
They're very soft (baked for 8 minutes) and big, just like it says. I followed the recipe, except after making the dough, I left it to refrigerate for a half-hour instead of rolling it into balls immediately.
My family loves these cookies and I'm sending them out-of-state to a friend, as it is a fairly easy and very delicious, holiday cookie.

Can't say enough good things about this recipe. They're easy to throw together and they come out perfect. Since I live in NM, I added 1/4 tsp red chili powder (because we put chili in everything) to the batter to give the spices a little more heat. I'd suggest 1/16-1/8 tsp for those who don't like much heat but want to enhance the spices a bit. I also cut the sugar in half, but they still came out sweet enough. These puff and spread a bit so this recipe isn't the best for cutouts, but it's -awesome- if you want a simple cookie.

These cookies are absolutely delicious! I made them for my dad and he said "You outdid yourself!" which, if you know him, is high praise indeed! The only sub I made was real unsalted butter for the marg, OJ for the water, 1/2 tsp LESS of the ginger and 1/2 tsp MORE of the cinnamon. Thanks for a great recipe!

Yummy!!!  I am not a huge fan of "spice" cookies and don't typically like things with cloves, but, this cookie was great!   The combination of molasses, cloves and all of that ginger was wonderful. I did use orange juice in place of the water as many reviewers suggested.  I accidently used baking powder instead of baking soda (a common mistake of mine - when will I learn??).  I thought I had totally ruined the recipe, but, I baked them anyway - I just flattened out the cookies a little more than the recipe called for.  They didn't rise very much, but, they were still soft and chewy and had great flavor.  Next time I'll hopefully get it right and use baking soda and I'm sure they will be even better!  Definitely try this recipe!

This is a great cookie recipe. I made a glaze with powdered sugar vanilla and milk then used my finger to drizzle over the top. The cookies went over great at my husband’s work place. Some people who normally don't like cookies really enjoyed these.

I am amazed how good these cookies are!   I added a little cinnamon to the sugar when I rolled the balls before baking for a little extra spice. Who had leftovers to store?  These were a huge hit and will make again!

Oh my!!!!!!!  This cookie is amazing, and I don't even like ginger snaps!  I made these for a potluck at school, and everyone loved them.  I loved them so much that I made them again, two days later, because I was craving them again.  I also substituted orange juice for the water, as suggested by other reviewers.  This is the perfect fall/winter/holiday cookie, and they look PERFECT!

I tried this recipe a few times now, and each time it was a great success.  They really do stay soft for a long time and they taste great as well.  They're a little sweet, but what cookie isn't?

This was one of the first times baking cookies from scratch (I haven't been baking very long), but I have to say it wasn't too difficult and it turned out very nicely!

I just made thse cookies to night for the first time on the spur of the moment for a harvest festival.  They were FABULOUS. Everyone -and I mean Everyone- loved them- the 70 year olds and the 9 year olds alike. All I brought home was an empty plate! gotta make a double batch next time.

Pretty Good Recipe. I am not a fan of super sticky dough, it makes the cookies hard to form. I dipped just top of the cookies in course sugar, which turned out to be really yummy. Also, added and extra 1/2 teaspoon of cinnnamon and cloves, which accented the spice flavor.

These were simply wonderful! An extremely comforting...and addicting cookie! Lovely w/ a cup of tea and so soft! I couldn't "roll" mine into balls. The batter is just to soft. So I shaped mine into ball-like mounds and then dampened the bottom of a glass w/ water and dipped in sugar and pressed them down slightly..not too thin. Then I sprinkile w/ just a touch more sugar and popped them in the oven. I had to stop myself from eating them! For a girl on WW, 3 pts per cookie is alot when you've had 3 cookies in one shot! ;)

Unbelievable. Only changes- 1/2 c butter, no margarine. Used 1 c ww flour, the rest being all - purpose white. So far everone who's tried them has been amazed that they're homemade. Chewy, tasty, the perfect amount of crispness on the outside; they're the perfect ginger & molasses cookie. Plus your house smells like heaven while they're cooking!

The taste was out of this world! I was really surprised. Yet I was disappointed that there was no warning about the sticky mess it is to make these. There should've been some tips on what to do instead of play in goop. I read more suggestions and I think next time I'll put the mix in the freezer for a few minutes. But please, a little warning next time.

These are SO good. I used a mixture of regular and coarse natural sugar in the batter and a sprinkle of course sugar on top. The texture was nicer than the time I used just regular sugar.

Made these about a month ago for my husband who loves ginger cookies.  The taste is out of this world.  However my cookies ended up flat, still soft, but flat.  There was no way possible to roll these cookies into a ball, not sure what I did wrong, except for using butter versus margarine?  I guess it doesn't matter as they were so good, lasted only about 1-1/2 days before they were gone.  I can't say they were Big Ginger Cookies either, but they were soft.  I may have to attempt these again to see if I can get them to look like the picture, because mine didn't look anything like the picture and if there is one thing I can make that always turns out like a posted picture, it's cookies, except for these.  These really are wonderful cookies.

Delicious.  To avoid the "sticky dough" problem, I put some sugar in a teacup and dropped in spoonfuls of dough, then rolled them around by shaking the cup.  The dough is no longer sticky when you take them out.  These are excellent and I'll make them again and again!

These are my all time favorite cookies! Have made these many, many times since discovering the recipe 2-3 years ago. I use Crisco sticks instead of margarine and usually double the batch. I make them larger than the recipe calls for, and they look like they should be in a bakery. I've never had a batch fail. They crinkle beautifully and taste amazing. You will impress with these!

These cookies are very good!  Everyone who tastes them likes them!  I substituted 1 tablespoon cold coffee for the water.  It worked well.  These would make a great house warming/welcome to the neighborhood treat.  I will definitely be adding it to my big recipe box. Way to go Amy!!

Definitely an excellent cookie. I followed the recipe exactly except that I had to use butter instead of margarine as that was what was on hand. My husband thanked me several times for making them for him. I usually have all these ingredients so I will be making them often. The only problem I can see is, there are too few cookies! Lol.
Big Hint. Those who are having trouble with the dough being too moist will benefit by knowing that after the egg is mixed in the electric mixer, do not use the mixer. The instructions say to stir in the rest of the ingredients. The texture will be much easier to shape into balls. No refrigeration is needed.
My 3 year old grandson told me to keep making them so we don't run out.

These were sooo delicious. I added 1 T of orange juice instead of 1 T water and reduced brown sugar to 3/4 c as others suggested. Used dark molasses and not the light. PERFECT taste although mine came out flat for some reason. Stayed soft, though. Whole batch is GONE two days later! Thank you!

I love these cookies.  Unfortunately I didn't have any molasses so I made them without it and I still think they were great.  Also when all the ingredients were added I think my dough was a little crumbly so I added some orange juice until moist enough to roll into balls.  Came out perfectly and stayed nice and soft all week.

Very good cookies!  Mine turned out a bit flat but still nice and chewy.  I swapped the margarine for butter.  *UPDATE*  For a prettier, crackled cookie DO NOT flatten.

I thought these were too sweet for ginger cookies - next time I will try reducing the sugar to 3/4 cup and perhaps leaving them plain instead of rolling in sugar.  I increased the ginger to 3 tsp and the flavor was perfect.  Also, mine flattened out and didn't stay raised like in the picture.  They looked like they'd be crispy ginger wafers, not big soft cookies--though the texture was true to description--soft and pliable, just thin and flat.   I may try these again with some modifications.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Amazing recipe - I doubled it to get more cookies! In future I would add more ginger - my guests said they could taste the cinnamon but not the ginger.

A lot less exciting than I expected based on reviews.  A very average recipe, even with the OJ.

The cookies came out soft and wonderful. I used orange juice as well to bring out the ginger flavor.

I made this recipe two Christmas' ago and I rolled out the dough to make Gingerbread Men. They were so good and the dough is really easy to work with once it's chilled. This is my go-to gingerbread cutout recipe. And the cookies stay nice and soft, which I love.

I added a bit of cayenne and a bit of pepper as recommended.... nice.  Otherwise I made the recipe exactly as written and ended up with a perfect batch.  They did not flatten too much, nor were they bland.  This is a definite make again recipe.

Great cookies. A all around family favorite! I didn't have orange juice to add instead of the water as some suggested so I used apple juice instead. Turned out great! I also used all butter. I prefer not to put to many chemicals in my food :) So I didn't use the margarine. Oh I also used organic cane sugar instead of the white bleached kind. They came out beautiful!

absolutely delicious.
I added OJ, 1/4 c flour and 1/4 tsp chilli powder as suggested before. I also added 2 tsp fresh ginger because I love the flavour. They came out spicy which is how we like them.

The best ginger cookie recipe ever! Used orange juice instead of water as suggested, and after rolling it in sugar and on the cookie sheet, I sprinkled generous amounts of sugar on each slightly flattened ball, so that when it baked, it would get that pretty crackled sugar look like you see at stores.

Love these cookies! Based on other reviews, I used butter instead of margarine and I added 1/4 cup of extra flour. My trick for this type of cookie (like Snickerdoodles) is to use a small cookie scoop to drop the dough directly into a small bowl with sugar in it, then swirl the dough around in the bowl to coat. You won't get your fingers sticky.

Good and chewy! They expand quite a bit in the oven so unless you don't mind your cookies running into each other then give them a little more space then usual. I added a little bit of pepper - a dash (I know, crazy! My mother does it and it's amazing) to make them spicier.

Wonderful, wonderful flavor, but I made as directed and had very flat cookies. I will try refrigerating the dough for a little while next time - all my kids liked it. I'm a gingerbread fanatic so I'm all about the flavor anyway.

My mother in law makes a ginger cookie that my husband loves, but I could never make it as well as her.  This one is different, but I can finally satisfy my husband's desire for a ginger cookie.

They weren't too sticky, so I didn't have to let them sit before rolling. I doubled the recipe and used a cookie dough scooper and was able to make about 6 1/2 dozen cookies. I'll definitely keep making them but will use a milder molasses next time since the flavor really dominates the cookie.

These are really good. I like mine crispy so I baked them a little longer and I am big into spices so I just added a 1/4 t more cinnamon and cloves and I really love nutmeg so I added a 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg. Ginger snaps are my favorite cookies, in the Fall I bake them and make a pumpking dip to go with them. Pumpkin, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, cream cheese and powder sugar.

I got this from pomplemousse and had to make them myself. So easy and sooo delicious. I used self-rising flour and cut the salt and baking soda (because self-rising flour already has salt) and refridgerated the batter for 5 minutes...they came out beautiful and tasty!

These cookies are very close to my neighborhood bakery's ginger molasses cookies (which I still think are the best).  I used full-bodied molasses, which gave it a richer color and taste.  Even cutting back on the butter (to 1/2 cup) and sugar, the cookies turned out very moist, soft, chewy, and sweet, baking for 8 mins on the dot.  I actually would put more ginger in next time.  In my batch I made them extra decadent by adding in chopped dark chocolate-covered candied ginger from trader joe's... really rich and yummy!  I'm sure it would be great with just chopped candied ginger, or plain, as it is in the recipe.  Sometimes I'm in a mood for a crispier cookie so one pan I made the cookies smaller and baked them for a full 10 mins - they turned out like gingersnaps!!  YUM!  Fantastic how one recipe can give you big, soft, chewy ginger cookies and also crunchy, crispy gingersnaps!

It made many more cookies than the recipe stated but that is a good thing because they were fabulous. I took many to a bake sale and two ladies bought a plate of six and came back to purchase two dozen each. Thanks for the great recipe.

These were great! I used the orange juice instead of water. I started rolling them and dropping them into the sugar but got tired or it so I just dropped spoonfuls of the rest of the batch and I think I liked those even better than than the putsy ones.

Awesome. Period.
This is THE gingerbread cookie recipe. The only mistake I made was that I made my cookies way too big! But they tasted great nevertheless. I also substituted white sugar w/ Splenda (granulated kind). You would've never guessed it's anything but regular sugar.
Loved the recipe. I will definitely be making this again (only w/ smaller cookies next time) :)

Very good cookies.  My boyfriend will be the big test.  He LOVES ginger cookies - so I'm making them as a surprise for Valentine's Day.  I substituted 1c of whole wheat flour, and baked on stones.  Needed to bake for about 12-13 minutes.  Turned out great! Would definitely make these again.

The BEST ever soft ginger cookies!  I get requests to make these from my family and friends all the time!  I add a little more ground ginger to the recipe whenever we're looking for more bite!

I just made these and they came out quite well.  I'm trying to be un-bias because I've realized I don't really care for ginger as a flavor so I was a little turned off by these but ONLY because the ginger flavor is so strong.  If you like ginger..I think you will really like these..they are easy to make and they come out very nice and chewy.  I baked mine for longer than the recipe requires and they still came out very well.  My hubby really enjoyed them!  As for me...I think I was looking for a cookie with a deeper molasses flavor..guess I will try molasses cookies next time!!

this is my first time making this recipe, or any ginger cookie... it's my first time working with molasses too and I had no idea how much it smelled, but you know, it's worth it! I'm making them as we speak, I have a batch in the oven. I followed the recipe exactly, and I put them in for only 8 minutes as other people said and they turn out amazing! The dough wasn't sticky, but I did find it a bit soft so I put it in the fridge and boy do they taste great :) They look exactly like the picture too which I absolutely loved. I'll be making this one again in no time. Next time I'll try with the orange juice instead of water as I forgot to do that this time.

These were really nice but not great.  Next time--and there will definitely be a next time!--I might try chopping some crystallized ginger into the mix as some suggested.

WOW! I made the recipe as written (I'll have the try the orange juice trick later).  Be warned that you'll have messy hands when you roll the balls, but the batter is so good I didn't care!  These are super easy to make, even a novice can't  wrong.

These are yummy.  After reading some of the earlier posts, I did increase the flour to a generous 2 1/2 cups and had no problems with sticky dough.  I also followed the advice of others and reduced cloves to 1/4 tsp. and used 1/2 cup butter (vs. margarine).  On the first batch, I did forget to flatten slightly and my cookies did not get that nice, cracky look to them.  All of the other batches did so flattening slightly must be the key.  And with the changes that I made, they were nice and puffy, no flat cookies here.  Thanks!!

Amazing. The best new cookie recipe I've tried in years. I love the spiciness of them, and they were a huge hit with my kids, my husband, and all our coworkers. This recipe goes in my box permanently.

the raving reviews tell no lies.  i tried it with the oj.  and i also used just 1 tsp of powdered ginger and 1 tsp of candied ginger run through my mini-chopper.  these remind me of the gingeroo cookies from trader joes which are my fave.  i had no problems with sticky dough.  these were the easiest tastiest cookies i have ever made!  they are being added to the rotation in my kitchen.

These were really tasty, but I wouldn't say that they were the best cookies I have ever had. I completely agree with those who found the dough too sticky- it was impossible to make walnut sized balls. I managed with two teaspoons, and just transfered the small splots of dough to the baking paper. Then, I dipped a wooden spoon in orange juice, and coated it in sugar. Lastly, I used the back of the spoon to shape the dough. They were lovely and soft though, and the ginger is spot on. I'm keeping the recipe for next time!

With high expectations for this recipe, I looked forward to a nice afternoon of cooking; I found myself amid a gooey concotion of molasses and flour. I was unable to roll the dough into neat little walnut sized balls without first flouring my hands, and re-flouring in between each cookie. After reading numerous reviews I find it hard to believe that this recipe is still listed in the top 20 as it seems the only success stories come from those bakers who make much needed alterations.

I was looking for a gingerbread cookie recipe that did not require molasses, and settled on this one while substituting maple syrup for the molasses - they were excellent!  Very soft, they actually stayed soft for two days! Thank you, we will make these again as a cookie jar filler.

These cookies are wonderful, however when I read "flatten slightly" I did just that.  Apparently they need to be flattened more because the centers were not cooked after 12 minutes.  So make them flatter than puffy and they should turn out fantastic! :)

This recipe was outstanding! I couldn't keep any for Christmas! I used unsalted butter instead of shortening and cut back a little on the cloves - (this is my preference) - otherwise this recipe uis a keeper!

As you can see by the large number of great reviews, these are a fantastic cookie indeed! I tried them for the 1st time a few days ago and Wow!!! Truly delicious and exactly as described, nice and soft! Be careful to follow the exact measurements stated in the recipe... I thought the amount of ginger was too little, so I took it upon myself to add just a touch more. They DID NOT need the touch more ginger I added; it proved to be overkill on the ginger seasoning. Just make them exactly as directed and these are one heck of a good cookie!

I've made these cookies a few times, and they are delicious. The first time I made them they came out very flat so I added half a cup of flour and half a teaspoon of baking soda next time and that solved the problem. Once I didn't have any molasses, so I substituted Golden syrup and they came out more like a spiced sugar cookie, which was very nice. The golden syrup version is very good with lemon frosting made of margarine, powdered sugar and lemon juice.

I've made this recipe quite a few times - it's easy, quick and I always have the ingredients on hand. They taste great and I always get compliments when I bring them to work or to a party. Butter works fine if that's all you've got. My only problem is that they always come out flat.

These are wonderful!  I'm not a huge baker, but come the holidays and I feel as though I have to bake one batch of cookies for Santa.  This recipe was SO easy.  I didn't even have the gooey mess everyone is talking about, so rolled them right away.  I tossed each ball in a little bowl of sugar, which made it very easy.  I also used oj in place of the water, but other than that, I stuck right to the recipe.  They are so pretty and taste delicious.  My house smells so good right now!

Well - hmmm. I'm in the minority here. I made these as directed with the exception of using OJ in place of the water. I got absolutely the flattest cookie I've ever made. The flavor is incredible - so so so good. But they didn't puff up at all - nothing like some of the pictures show. I did use margarine like the recipe calls for, and if I were to make these again, I'd use butter - maybe that's it? They taste so good, but they're not all that appealing to look at! They do stay soft...but flat soft. :-(

These cookies are amazingly delicious and do stay soft for literally weeks! My only suggestion is that if you are not a huge ginger fan cut down the amount you add. These are GINGER cookies and are very strong. I usually cut down on the ginger and add a little more cinnamon. Also, if you can use real butter, margarine works too but the cookies will be a little flatter and a lot greasier. No matter what though, these are amazing cookies!

This is really a great recipe. Very nice flavor. I followed the advice of another and added about 1/4 tsp nutmeg. I also cut back on white sugar to 3/4 cup and added 1/4 brown sugar. a nice holiday cookie.

These were soft and so wonderful.  I doubled the recipe, and used half butter, half butter-flavored shortening (in place of the margarine.)  I used the bottom of a cup to gently press each one down.  These are going into my Christmas cookie collection!

Not soft once they've cooled, but still very good!  I used about one and a half tablespoons of ginger, orange juice instead of water as other reviewers suggested, and butter instead margarine and these came out wonderfully.

I thought these would be soft,fat cookies but mine are flat. The flavor is terrific though. I did use the orange juice instead of water. I chilled for 2 1/2 hours and they were still very sticky and soft for dough. Next time I will add more flour. My whole house loved them. I made small balls and got almost 4 dozen. But alas not enough to take to the bake sale. They got eaten too fast.

I had to add some flour and sit in the refrigerator for awhile because it was too gooey.  But I couldn't wait for the batter gets firm, so I ended up spooning them on the baking sheet and sprinkling sugar.  It still came out GREAT!!!

These really are the best cookies I've ever had! They have the perfect amount of spice, sweet and buttery goodness. From other's reviews I used orange juice instead of water and I think it really enhanced the cookie. I didn't really have any problems with the dough.. I just used a cookie scoop and sprinkled sugar on top instead of rolling the dough. Worked for me!!

I LOVE this recipe.  First, I used fresh ginger instead of dry.  Then I used less cinnamon and clove so the focus would be on the ginger.  Per other users suggestions, I used oj instead of water, brown sugar instead of white, more flour, mixed by hand, refrigerated the dough overnight, and used parchment on the cookie sheet.  Perfection!

FANTASTIC COOKIES. I also recommend increasing the amount of spices though. Remember though, extra SPICES can mean extra SPICY, especially when it comes to ginger and cloves. I definitely recommend adding more nutmeg. Thank you so much for this recipe!

This is the best cookie recipe I have ever tried!  I used O.J. instead of water at the recommendation of another reviewer, and it was excellent.  I also gently pressed some diced candied ginger on top before baking.  They stayed soft after they cooled.

I can't believe how good these turned out! I halved the recipe, used brown sugar instead of white, and ground nutmeg instead of cloves (because I didn't have any) and molasses sugar because that was what I had.  I also used less flour. Instead of sugar in the end, I added some raisins to the dough- formed them into little balls and chilled it overnight. 
Now I can't stop eating them off the tray!!! These are my new favorite cookies!!!thank you!

I made these to take in to my husband's office for a Halloween party. Just for fun, turned them into decadent little sandwiches, with approx. 1 Tbsp. Betty Crocker whipped vanilla frosting snuggled between two cookies. He says they are still talking about them!
I am SO making these again!

Use orange juice instead of water and even then, not as much as called for.  Use more molasses and ginger.  Freeze dough for 1/2 hour before rolling.  Roll in Cinnamon and Sugar and don't squash flat.

My favorite cookie.... EVER. I make these regularly, and watch them vanish each time. My friends now beg me to make them. The suggestion to substitute orange juice for the water works wonderfully. *Hint* I also cook them just a little bit less than is recommended, 8 or 9 minutes. They will come out of the oven extremely soft, but once they cool a bit they are wonderfully moist and chewy, and will stay that way for ages.

Major addiction! It's worse than the potato chip phenomenon. You really can't only have one. I defy you! That said, these truly are delectable. I did tone down the cloves (not a big fan) to 1/4 tsp. I must now whip up another batch since I let my addiction get the better of me!

I made these for the second time, doubled the recipe and experimented using approximately one third full flavor molasses(it can be overpowering) in addition to mild flavor molasses, they are much more like an old fashioned molasses cookie. Love them!  YUMMY!!  This is the recipe I have been looking for!  I used butter, as I always do. Next time I make them I will try using dark molasses to see if the flavor of the molasses comes through alittle stronger.  I made them according to directions and actually got 3 dozen.  Baked for 9 minutes, and did not press them down as indicated.  Very nice flavor and tender, chewy consistency.  This ones a keeper!

I love this recipe! I used butter instead of margarine since I don't use margarine as a rule.  I will make this recipe again, but plan to add crystalized ginger to my next batch.

I have never been a fan of Ginger Cookies. Ginger Cookies are normally hard and crunchy and I like chewie cookies better. So when I came across this recipe I had to try it. WOW! These are the best ginger cookies in the world. So easy to make and they look like I bought them at the store. My kids can't stop eating them. This recipe is a keeper.

Thank you for this recipe!! They are just like the ones my mom used to make for us kids! My personal favourite is to eat them hot out of the oven with a cup of Earl Grey tea with lemon. Thanks again.

A+ PERFECT as is--don't change a THING!

I was hungry for a ginger snap, but I don't like how hard they are. I wanted a big, fat, soft cookie--these fit the bill perfectly!!! OMG--fresh from oven ... pure Heaven! My friend & husband gobbled them UP immediately and RAVED about them! Another winner from allrecipes.com. Thanks for sharing this recipe Amy--you're an angel! Yummmmmmm.

These cookies are delicious.  Worth every star!  I used orange juice instead of water and butter instead of margerine.  I used a medium cookie scoop and just dropped the cookies onto waxed paper.  I put a little shortening on the palms of my hands to make rolling into a ball easier.  I used turbinado sugar to roll the cookies in.  Two TBL of sugar was not enough for rolling.  I used around 1/3 cup.  The turbinado sugar really makes the coookies look nice.

Yummy! I made this with a pumpkin cream cheese dip and it's the perfect autumn combo! Make two batches of cookies for this much dip:  2 8-oz. pkgs. cream cheese (softened), 1 30-oz. can pumpkin, 4 cups powdered sugar, 2 tsp. cinnamon. Mix pumpkin slowly into softened cream cheese and add sugar and cinnamon until all ingredients are smooth and blended. Keep dip refrigerated.

My only advise on making this recipe is, don't make it, unless you are ready to make another batch after you devour the first.  These are so good. These will have to be at the top of the best cookies I have ever made list. 
Worth every star and then some!!

Loved them!! They were great and didn't last long.  Also very pretty too luck at.  I did follow some of the suggestions by adding the orange juice, which I think helped.  I am thinking of maybe adding a little more ginger next time.

Great - I also used orange juice instead of water.  I refrigerated the dough about an hour and had no trouble at all rolling.  Will make again.

I baked these for my students and they asked me where I bought them! I live in Europe, so I used English treacle, and it worked in place of molasses.  I also used butter instead of margarine because I couldn't find any. I rolled into little balls and then put an X on top with the back of the knife ... made them look very professional. They came out great, next time I will throw in some pumpkin pie spice!

These cookies are so fabulous! Let me just say that my dad is a real honest to goodness pie man. He doesn't care for cookies very much at all. Well, he couldn't stop saying how good they were. My mother says they remind her of how my grandmother's were ("waxy" in the middle) and my grandmother (a little skinny mini old lady turning 90 this month) has been downing them with her coffee and absolutely raving over them left and right! I have made four batches and can not seem to keep any in the house. My mother even had to resort to making them herself when she couldn't wake me up one day. Wonderful cookies. Try them with tea or coffee - yum!

These are absolutely fabulous!! I could not stop eating them and my husband, who does NOT like this type of cookie thought they were great!! They melt in your mouth and they stay soft at least until the next day, as that is all the longer they lasted at our house!! A super keeper!!

Perfect! I followed the recipe, except that I was a bit *generous* with the cinnamon. I followed the advice of a previous reviewer and chilled the dough for about 30 minutes in the freezer then coated each cookie in the sugar before actually forming into balls, as the dough is still somewhat sticky. Temp and cook time were actually perfect, which never happens with my oven! Thanks for the great recipe! These will be perfect for the holidays. :)

I know the recipe is called "BIG Soft Gigner Cookies" and the first time I made them at the appropiate size as suggested by the recipe they turned out uncooked and way too blobb-ish. After making them smaller however, it turned out well. These cookies are definetely yummy, and easy to make.

These cookies are absolutely delicious!  They stay soft and chewy and have great flavor.  The dough is too soft to "roll into balls" so I just spoon it on the cookie tray and sprinkle the sugar on top.  I also use parchment paper on the cookie sheet and it works great.  Awesome recipe!

These cookies were nice and soft. I took some advice from other reviews, and put the mixture into the fridge before rolling into balls. Others said about 40-50 minutes, but I found it was at handling stage after only 20 minutes or so. Also, the cookies will turn out just as good if not flattened slightly and rolled in sugar before baking.

They baked up flat and not puffy like the picture, but the flavor was so fabulous that nobody cared.  I rolled some of them in turbinado sugar instead of plain white sugar, and it only made them better, if possible!

I used whole wheat pastry flour which made them a little flatter than I would have liked so I will have to experiment.  Otherwise, awesome cookie!  I often don’t like ginger cookies but these were great.  I also used the oj and I think it really enhanced the flavor.  Thanks for a fun recipe!

The first time I made these cookies, they turned out like huge, undercooked, inedible blobs. I don't know why, but the second time they were good--tasted nice and cooked properly, but they don't look nice and crinkly like the other pics. I think I should have flattened them even more. I also reduced sugar--and subbed half of it with brown sugar.

Good cookies, very soft and chewy. The apartment smelled SO good while they were baking. Not as much flavour as I would like though. Will probably opt for a crunchier recipe next time.

These always turn out great!  I add chopped crystallized ginger, since I'm fond of ginger.  Another good thing to do is to dip half the baked cookie in melted dark chocolate (after they cool) & put them in the fridge to set.  They are fabulous that way!

These were sooo good. A nice spiciness. I chilled the dough a bit to make it easier to work with, and sprayed my hands periodically with cooking spray. This is a great trick whenever you're working with sticky stuff, like rice crispy treats.

Easy to make, I followed the recipe exactly. I made them a little smaller, so the baking time was not quite the ten minutes. I'll defiantly make this again!

These were very good.  I found the dough to be to soft to form balls so, I just used rounded tablespoonfulls.  I sprinkled the sugar on while they cooled on the cookie-sheet and that worked out quite well.  They made my house smell like Christmas!

These were good cookies, but not excellent to me.  They were a little too soft and I guess I like them with more crunch.

I followed the recipe to the letter and had no problems with the dough being sticky and I didn't need to refrigerate it. Because my dough was not stiff and cold I didn't need to flattened before baking.

Excellent cookies, chewy and flavorful without being overwhelming.  I made these on Christmas day and the aroma added to the Christmas atmosphere. We had company at home and these cookies were gone before I can sit down to enjoy them! I snucked one while they were cooling on the tray and that's the only one I ate from this batch.

This is identical to the Better Homes & Gardens "Giant Ginger Cookies" they published years ago, but they had shortening instead of margarine. Everything else is identical--measurements and all. Their recipe is wonderful. The cookies do harden after awhile though. I'll have to try it with margarine.

When my husband requested soft and chewy gingerbread cookies I looked at him like he was insane. These were fantastic!!!! Very soft, I only needed to cook them for 8-9 minutes. I added some buttercream frosting which was yummy too. Great recipe, but I should have made two batches!!!!

These cookies are absolutely amazing!  The thick and soft texture is such a nice change from traditional crunchy gingerbread cookies.  Also, they stay soft for days (not that they last that long in the house, though!)

My favorite cookie this season - had a cookie swap and these were the hit.  I know I've made them 8 times since finding this recipe.  I have used water but next time will try the OJ (can't believe they'd be better but I'm willing to give it a try)!

these were ok.
i thought they had a bit too much spice in them. and the texture was a little too mushy, but that was most likely my fault as i forgot to flatten the cookie before baking, oops!.

I'll bake these cookies for the third year in a row, tomorrow!  Although I do agree with other post-ers who've noted quite a sticky batter, I feel that gentle hands, focus, patience and love will bring these cookies into a well-deserved fruition.  Don't be afraid to make a mess!  Thanks!

I don't usually go for ginger flavored sweets, but I made these because they have excellent ratings, and I knew at least the house would smell great.  I love these cookies!  I've eaten 5 in the last 30 minutes.  Very soft, very good.  Thank you!  Angela

I love the flavor of gingersnaps, but hate the hard consistency.  This recipe was just perfect! I followed the recipe with no changes except that I just dropped little scoops of the dough on my baking stone & dusted with sugar at that point.  Wonderful flavor & soft texture.  Great for a snack & for breakfast dunked in coffee.  THANKS!

Perfect! Exactly the kind of recipe I was looking for! Used approx. 2 1/2 tsp ginger. Soft in the middle, crispy edges! Baked for 12 min.  Even had "cracked" look to them! This is a keeper!

These cookies tasted great, and they did stay soft the next week. I brought them on my friend's boat and everyone loved them. However, they were very cake like, which i would rather have them be more like a soft cookie than a soft cake.

Firstly, these were delicious.  When I was making them my husband asked me why...because no one would like them.  Then, lo and behold - no one else got to eat any because he ate them all!  
I found them a little hard to work with when rolling them into balls because for some reason mine turned out soft/sticky - but a little stint in the freezer sorted that out satisfactorily.  Also I found I needed to cook mine a little longer. 
They were indeed soft - and definately a keeper!

These cookies are a hit whenever I make them--they barely have time to cool before my roomates have eaten the entire btach.  I find that it makes a big difference if all the dry ingredients are sifted before they are added; when everything is well blended the cookies are fantastic.  I also add more of the spices than the recipe calls for.  Great cookies!!

I have to say that these are the best ginger cookies I have ever had. My family loves ginger cookies and I have used the same recipe for over 5 years, but this will replace it for sure. So soft and yummy! I swear they are better today than they were yesterday when I made them.

I personally think this is a very good recipe.  I was going for something harder, like actual gingerbread cookies.
I substituted the molasses for syrup, and added raisins.

Wonderful flavor!  My 7 yr old daughter wanted gingerbread men though so I did add extra flour to allow for rolling the dough out.  They baked well and were crisp.  My family and I like crisp cookies however so the recipe was well received.  Will also try it the "soft" way.

I tried these cookies the other night.  I substituted self-rising flour because I didn't have any all purpose flour and I left out the baking soda.  The cookies turned out beautifully.  I also used powdered sugar instead of granular sugar.  The cookies were all gone within 24 hrs.  This recipe is not only easy, but is quick to fix and is delicious.  My compliments to whoever submitted this recipe.

So amazingly good! Changes: I added a couple extra tablespoons of flour, substituted 1/2 cup white sugar with dark brown sugar, added 1/4 tsp nutmeg plus another 1/4 tsp of cinnamon.  I made smaller dough balls than the recipe says (slightly less than tablespoon-sized) and got about 50 cookies. I also froze the dough for about 20 minutes, and rolled the clumps in confectioner's sugar before baking. A definite keeper! Note: be sure to use margarine -- I tried it again with butter and the cookies were not as big and soft.

Oh my gosh!! I've been baking cookies for years and I must say that very few cookie recipes make it into my treasured collection. These are my new favorites! Just as described, big and SOFT, my requirement for cookies. Thanks for sharing this recipe, I'll make these for years to come and will pass on to the next generation.

These are wonderful soft cookies. I refrigerated them for an hour before I scooped them, which made them much easier to scoop. I was hoping they would be thick cookies, but hey the taste is heavenly. Definitely my favorite ginger cookie recipe, I will use this one from now own.

These were EXCELLENT!  About 1 tsp of nutmeg makes it really nice.  I made a batch yesterday and I had to end up making another one today since they were almost all gone this morning!  Also, if you bake these for a minute or two longer, they come out like ginger snaps!  Mmmm! Thanks!

great cookies, I did not use molassas as I do not care for the taste of it.  I used brown sugar corn syrup.  These were a favorite on the cookie platter.  I make them as a bite sized cookie and everyone loved them.

Yum,Yum,Yum! Soft and flavorful cookies.  We don't like crispy cookies and these were just as promised.  They come out as beautiful as if made at my favorite bakery.Made exactly as recipe said but did chill dough before rolling into balls and rolling in sugar.

These cookies tasted fine but I did not get a 'big' cookie, they were just like a soft ginger snap . Should I not have used my kitchen-aid mixer ??? Should cookies be mixed my hand to stay flat & soft ??...still they tasted fine especially warm !!

 Just a note: I followed the recipe as listed and I got 5 dozen cookies (using Pampared Chef small steel scoop).

I had been looking for a good ginger cookie recipe when I found this one...it is WONDERFUL!!!  I made them last night, brought them into work this morning, and they literally evaporated before my eyes.  A few tips, like others have said, the dough is sticky, so it helps to refrigerate it for a while.  Also, if you want to kick it up a notch, add more cloves. The next time around, I will also add a tad more salt, it helps to really bring out the flavor of the spices.

Fabulous! I used whole-wheat all-purpose flour instead of regular, and sifted with a metal  strainer (because the wheat flour is "chunky"). Turned out great, except I think the wheat flour made the spices seem bland. Next time I will increase cinnamon and ginger.

I made these for Thanksgiving and took them to my grandparents' (who used to own a bakery).  Everyone loved them, especially my grandfather!  My only trouble with the recipe was trying to form the dough into balls.  My dough was too sticky.  I may try refrigerating the dough first next time.  I used way more than 2 Tablespoons sugar to roll the dough in.  They do spread when baking so be sure to space them out on the cookie sheet.
Thanks for the recipe!  These were great for the holidays.

Great recipe and very easy.  The first batch had a little too much bite so I cut the cloves to 1/4 t. & they turned out perfect.  One warning if you take these to work - your co-workers will be fighting over them!

Excellent taste, dough somewhat soft and sticky, difficult to work with. I just made these an hour ago and over half are gone! I would suggest making a double batch. Thank you.

I used fresh grated ginger instead of the dry stuff and added in a little extra juice. I think that's probably why my dough turned out as runny as cake batter. But two hours in the fridge and it came out fine. I did have a problem with the dough sticking to my hands, but I just dropped spoonfuls of dough into the sugar and then shaped them into balls instead of the other way around. I also kicked up the cloves and ginger, and added a little nutmeg too. Like other reviewers, I found it easier to drop the cookies into a bowl of sugar instead of two Tbs. These came out big and chewy, just like they were supposed to, and made my whole house smell like Thanksgiving!

These are wonderful!  I made great big ones for a bake sale and they were very good.  I underbaked a couple of batches by accident so I would bake longer so next time I have cookies instead of ginger dough :)

Best Ginger cookie recipe ever!  I actually didn't have enough ginger when I first made the cookies, so used only 1 teaspoon (instead of 2) and they still tasted incredible!  I've already made them a second time, in one week. I've gotten a ton of compliments on these cookies and many people asking for the recipe or asking for me to make more.  Great recipe, highly recommend!!!

Made these twice so far and first time i used butter instead of margarine and got a cakier cookie.  Second time, unsed margarine and got a flatter, chewier cookie- I loved both. Just a tip for anyone with a preference.  Easy to make, easy to eat, easy to roll-for me atleast! Make these and you won't be disappointed.

These are soooo good! I did add a few shakes extra of ginger and used honey for the sugar. They were very moist and very yummy! Even the next day! (The one I had left!) I will be making this very often!

My kids and I had so much fun with this recipe! We rolled them out and cut them into different shapes. To do this you need to put in the freezer for about 15 minutes to a half hour. If still sticky add flour and cut to 1/4 inch thick. These cookies are the best they are so soft and stay that way for day's! We will be using this recipe for many years! Thanks for posting this recipe Amy wish we would have found it sooner!

A big hit at work just as they are or with a little icing.  I've been asked for the recipe more than once.  Suggestion:  while still warm spread a small dollop of buttercream frosting (butter, milk, conf. sugar, vanilla) on top to form a glaze.  I did use butter rather than margarine - worked great.

Update:  I have now made these dozens and dozens of times and they are always delicious.  I make the dough as listed except I use butter.  I have found that they work as a drop cookie if you are in a hurry and don't want to get your hands dirty, but the trade off is that they do not come out as perfect round circles.  Instead of rolling the balls in sugar first, you can sprinkle sugar on them as they come out of the oven or leave it off altogether. These are foolproof.

VERY GOOD!!!  I followed the recipe exactly as written except that I used unsalted butter instead of margarine.  They are wonderful.  Very soft and chewy.  I dropped them into the sugar with my 2 teaspoon cookie dropper (like a small ice cream scoop) and got nice uniform sized cookies (a bit larger than a half-doller size).  With this smaller-sized cookie I got just over 5 dozen.

these cookies were INCREDIBLE! Used half white, half brown sugars and added 1/2 c extra flour because we wanted the recipe for gingerbread men. Refrigerating the dough overnight made it ideal rolling consistency - my kids had so much fun with these! *tip:  Per another reviewers comment, cut outcookies should be about 1/3 inch thick, too thin and they get hard. This recipe is a new family tradition! Thank you Amy!
Also, royal icing by Diane on this site was excellent for these cookies too!

THE PERFECT ginger cookie!  This is just the cookie I have been looking for for YEARS.  Mine came out not "soft" (which to me implies cake-like) but chewy, with just the right touch of crunch.  I dipped them in crystal sugar, it created a pretty, festive look on a crinkled ginger cookie that I used for gift giving.

YUM!  My Husband said these were the best cookies he ever had.  The smell of them cooking was enough to let us know how yummy they were going to be!  Delicious.  I made gingerbread men out of mine.  It's going to be a yearly tradition.  Thanks!

The first batch disappeared in a day, so I tried doubling the second batch - if you do this, make sure you add extra flour, since they were a little flatter than the single batch. Of course, they still tasted AWESOME! great recipe!

These were good, not quite what I expected. My mother had a recipe that sounded like this one, but alas it wasn't.  My family likes them well enough to rate 4 1/2 stars, so I gave them a reluctant 5.  They do stay soft, and have good flavor, I was just hoping for something different.

This was such an easy recipe to make! I found I had to add extra flour while mixing to make the dough to the consistency where I could shape it into balls, but they turned out picture-perfect!! I also thought the amount of ginger is a bit too much for my taste so when I make batch #2 I will reduce the amount to 1 and 1/2 teaspoons from 2 tsp.  Very delicious - crispy on the outside edges, uniform shape (mine look exactly like the photo!!) and tender middle. Definite keeper! Many thanks Amy, for sharing this recipe!!

I'm not usually a cookie fan, but this is one of the best recipes I've ever used.  The cookies really do stay soft even after they've cooled and the flavor is just perfect.

These are indeed awesome cookies. I did add almost a half cup of flour just to make it easier to form the dough into soft balls. I followed the excellent advice to drop the dough into the sugar and roll it there. The cookies are perfect in flavor and texture.

These are great!  I didn't have all individual spices, so I used pumpkin pie spice. Also, I used small meatball/cookie scoop from Pampered Chef and got about 4 dozen smaller cookies, which required extra sugar for rolling.  Flatten them with the bottom of a glass.  Baked them only 8 minutes.  Yummmmmm.

These cookies are really great and stay very, very soft.  My dough came out too soft though, so I had a hard time working with them.  I may have done something wrong, but the cookies ended up  flat and skinny.  Still, they taste wonderful and I'll make them over and over again.

Good, old-fashioned, grandma-style cookies. I used fresh grated ginger, which 
gave the cookies a nice zing. I had to let the batter sit for a few minutes--initially,
the dough was too soft to work with. They turned out great and my kitchen smells
sooo good.

My daughter is the molasses cookie fan in the family.  She really likes these as did other members of the clan.  I may try adding lemon frosting next time around.

Very good spice cookie.  I didn't have a problem with the dough being too soft. (It's cold & dry around here today, maybe that's why.) I made 3 dozen 2-1/2 inch soft, spicy, hard to resist cookies from this recipe.

I LOVE these cookies.  I wasn't sure about them at first because the dough seemed so sticky and I felt like I had to add more flour, but they came out so chewy and delicious.  They will definately become a regular around my house!  Thanks!

THESE WERE FABULOUS!! The women in my family are all good cooks but cannot bake. I tried these cookies in an attept to break this family curse and please my little brother's holiady-time gingerbread cravings- I would have been happy with acheiving one - but I got 2! They go very fast, and are extremely moist and chewy.

Fantastic ginger cookies; especially for the holidays.  Had to add an extra cup of flour at the end because the batter was so soft, and they turned out great.  Sprinkled sugar on top while they were cooling.  Santa gives them 5 stars; thanks for sharing the recipe!

Wonderful cookies! I'm not a cookie pro but these did me proud. Dough was easy to handle, even w/out refrigeration. The snappy flavor and "crispy outside, chewy inside" texture should be a hit with my family this Christmas. Thanks for the recipe!

These are FANTASTIC.  My wife was a little apprehensive of trying them but has hooked after a little bite.  Needless to say they don't last long.  They are very simple to make and we had all the ingredients around the kitchen.

Awesome cookies!! And sooooo soft!! I recc refrigerating the dough a bit before forming the balls. And if you love raw cookie dough as much as I do, those pasteurized "fake eggs" work out really well.

YUM! I didnt have the cloves.. I used 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp allspice. I also put raisins in half the mixture. And I chilled the dough for a few hours. They tasted wonderful, almost like a cross between gingerbread and pumpkin pie. I make them about half the size as what is called for.. more kid friendly i think :)

Delicious!  And--if you roll into little balls instead of big ones, you get nice little crispy rounds.  They're great either way.

I have had to make my second batch of these cookies because my boyfriend and I ate the whole first batch in less than a week.  For the second batch I made them smaller so they would go farther and stack better on treat trays.  When making the balls try coating hand with cooking spray to keep dough from sticking to them.

These cookies were awsome!  They really do stay nice and soft too.  The dough was awful sticky, I had to add about a half a cup extra flower.  Like someone said, don't even think about gingerbread men.

These cookies are SOOOOO good!  (I'm trying to distract myself so that I don't eat all of them before Christmas!!!)  I have a feeling I'll be making another batch this week.  The recipe did make a lot more than it was supposed to--three short of four dozen (okay by me!!!).  I would recommend refridgerating the dough for even just 15 minutes to make it easier to roll in to balls.  It's really sticky otherwise.  These will be made often in my house!!  (And I don't like to bake!!)

This is a delicious and pretty easy recipe. I found it difficult to "shape dough into walnut sized balls," immediately after mixing the ingredients. I added about 1/2 cup of additional flour and chilled the dough overnight. I found it much easier to shape the dough into balls.

These cookies are some of the best ones i have ever had in my life!  What a nice sharp gingery flavour!  

I was quite liberal with the amount of ginger, cinnamon and cloves that i put in, and i think that really gave them a punch!

Great! For some reason my dough was too soft to form into balls, maybe the margerine...but I just spooned it onto the cookie sheeet instead. Great taste! Will make again! Used the Royal Icing recipe as well and made them even better!!

These did not turn out well. They seemed rather greasy. Perhaps there's too much margarine and not enough flour in the recipe.

This is the first time I have made ginger cookies ("biscuits" as we call them here in Australia!), and I cannot believe how easy they were and, more importantly, how delicious!  I am not very experienced in the kitchen, but your cookies made me seem like a pro!  I can't decide who loves them more - me, hubby, or the kids!  Will be making them over and over again - thank you!

These cookies are incredibly yummy! They were easy to make and they turned out so well. I am at 4500 feet, so they didn't really rise as much as I had hoped, but I found that when I turned the heat down to 325 and left them in a couple minutes longer, I had bigger rounder cookies.

These are the best cookies ever.  I used shortening instead of butter and brown sugar instead of white sugar (same proportions).  I dipped the balls into sugar and pressed them down onto a greased cookie sheet.  They were a huge hit!

They turned out amazing! These definitely are a recipe that I recommend. In the reviews I saw that people were complaining about that they were to sticky to roll into balls, so I just didn't add the water and they weren't sticky at all.

First batch, I forgot to add the water, but they turned out nicely.  A second batch had water as recommended by the recipe and they cookie dough turned out too thinly and slowly added extra flour to get the consistency that I like before forming the cookies.  In the end they turned out nicely too.  This recipe is hard to screw up.

I made this recipe with 2 cups flour and 1 cup of brown sugar packed because I prefer it. I also added a bit more cinnamon and ginger.  I used butter instead of margarine. I used a pair of latex gloves and coated them with olive oil to make and roll the balls.  These are delicious!  I used a bit of olive oil on the bottom of the glass. To smash the balls n sprinkled a bit of sugar on top. They were delicious!  I’m supposed to be taking them to a party tonight, but I’ve already eaten three!  So I took out butter to make me a batch!

Excellent recipe as is, though I used fresh orange juice squeezed from 3 orange slices instead of water as recommended by other reviewers and a vegan-style flaxseed egg (1 tbs ground flaxseed + 2 1/2 tablespoons water) because I was out of eggs. The cookies  are wonderful - crisp on the outside, moist and chewy on the inside, and perfectly spiced.

Truly the best ginger cookie I’ve had. Others stated their cookies didn’t spread when cooked. Mine spread to much. The only change I made was 1/2 cup white sugar and 1-2 cup brown. Mabey that caused it to spread, not sure. I will not press them down as much and see how that works. This recipe is a keeper for sure.

They are excellent!  I increased ginger by adding 1.5 tbsp fresh grated ginger along with the powdered spice. 
The grandchildren love chocolate chips in the 2nd batch I made

Fluffy inside. Crispy outside. It's very important to cream the butter and sugar until it's smooth, white, and fluffy. That's what makes these so good.
Thank you!

Great recipe. Like other reviewers added orange juice, nutmeg, and fresh grated ginger. Also substituted most of the sugar for dark brown sugar. Rolled in cinnamon-ginger sugar before baking. Next time will add even more grated ginger to give it more kick. Texture was perfect - but didn’t achieve the dark brown gingerbread color.

Great recipe, I modified it some by using 1/2 each of oat and barely flour for 1 cup of wheat flour gives a nuttier flavour and a better balance of essential amino acids, I made it primarily for my daughter and friends who are on chemotherapy- I also added a teaspoon of nutmeg and a some vanilla extract

My daughter practically lives on the cookies for a day or two when she is on chemo-  The cookies freeze very well and can be eaten right out of the freezer

Good recipe.  I followed the recipe (but I use butter)  the first time I made these, and they were too flat, and not chewy.  I made them again with changes.  My husband doesn't like cinnamon or cloves,  so eliminated those spices and increased the ginger by adding about a teaspoon of freshly ground.  I increased the baking soda to 2 tsps, and   Instead of water I added spiced rum, which I don't know if to made a difference.  I use butter in all my cookie recipes because that's what I have.  I gave it a 4 star because of the spices (cinnamon and cloves) aren't needed in a ginger cookie.

I needed a few dairy free desserts as my daughter in law has a severe dairy allergy.  These came out amazing and were a huge hit.  Put them in an air tight container and they lasted 2 weeks just as fresh an soft as when they were made.

Like other reviewers I need to chill the dough before I could work with it. Also, I pushed the cookies down a bit before baking. Otherwise I followed the recipe completely. They are the best gingerbread cookies I have ever had!!

Fantastic!! I will say though, I didn’t have molasses, so I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and substituted with five tablespoons of brown sugar. I also used orange juice instead of water. Honestly, best cookies I’ve baked in a long time!! I rolled them in different kinds of sprinkles and pressed them lightly and they baked perfectly. My husband and I ate a bunch, then I loaded up a plate to take to my in-laws for Christmas. I put the plate on the roof of my car and we drove off on our merry way. When I realized what had happened I literally cried, and we drove back to the scene of the incident so I could

My 86 year old grandma said these are the best she has ever had (ginger snaps are her favorite, imagine how many kinds she has tried in her life). I completely agree with her. They are perfectly flavored and make a big soft cookie ever single time. They stay soft for days and make a great coffee dipping cookie!

I followed the recipe exactly. Refrigerated the dough before rolling (but it was still super sticky). I got flat cookies without all the pretty cracks in them. I see a lot of other photos of flat cookies too so I know it wasn’t just me. Not sure what went wrong.

Perfect! I drizzled white chocolate on then to make them look more festive. Even people who claim they do not enjoy gingerbread loved these. The flavor of all the different spices is perfect! Will be making these year round! I used butter simply because I buy in large quantities at Costco and didn't want to run out and get margarine. No problems so I will continue to use butter in the future. Also used orange juice instead of water like others suggested. The citrus wakes up the spicy notes of these cookies, just like coffee makes chocolate baked goods even better.

I made these last night for our Christmas dinner today. I followed the recipe exactly. Though I took advice from some other comments to put the dough in the  fridge for 30 mins first before rolling them out because the dough was too wet and messy. The ginger flavour is also not very much! But they are alright.

Made recipe as is, chilled dough slightly before rolling into balls.  Only thing I would do differently next time is add a bit of sanding sugar to the tops for visual effects!  Otherwise nice and soft and chewy!

Great cookies! Made exactly as-is and they turned out great. I do want to play with them a bit more to see if I can get them to stand up more rather than bake so flat.

Best cookies I have ever made. I rolled them in golden yellow sugar since I didn't have enough white sugar, and I found the sugar was more noticeable on the cookie; looked and tasted amazing!

These tasted amazing! I didn't have the flattening problem in the oven, and I substituted butter instead of margarine (didn't have any). I also refrigerated my cookies balls for about 20 minutes before baking, which helped significantly, although I recommend extending the baking time if you do this. The dough wasn't too sticky for me; it was manageable, but it did require quick work and a little flour coating here and there, but overall, everything worked out amazing and I have received many compliments!

These cookies were great! Soft and very tasty, almost perfect. My only issue was with the sweetness, as they’re quite sweet. With my final batch, I skipped the final sugar coating step and simply sprinkled a bit of sugar on top. These ones were just perfect! These will be a new Christmas staple!

Very tasty cookie! I read another review that suggested to spoon the dough and plop it into the sugar before you roll it and I definitely recommend that! Otherwise you can't roll the sticky dough. Otherwise, it's a delicious cookie and it bakes in 10 minutes which is a plus!!

So good! I am somewhat of a novice baker and these came out perfectly with no changes to the recipe (other than I used the advice to use orange juice instead of water. Not sure how necessary it was!). I am at high altitude, so baking can be challenging but these were perfectly flavorful and soft. My family loved them.

These turned out great! I followed the recipe except for the following: 
using orange juice and then adding some zest into the dough. I chilled the dough for a while in the stand mixer bowl. Also I did not roll out the cookies and roll in sugar. 

I used a small disher so the cookies were all uniform. using the back of the disher, I dipped it in sugar and make a small indent in each cookie. 

I baked for about 12 minutes ( I think my oven temp is off) on a parchment lined baking sheet

Not overly sweet. Perfectly sized.

I agree with the reviewers who noted that these were the best ginger cookies they ever made. They were! I took one suggestion and refrigerated the dough for a bit before using it and that was a good idea. Other than this point, I made them exactly as stated and they were delicious. Thank you for a wonderful new go-to recipe.

These came out great. The only thing I did differently was to use half white sugar and half brown sugar. The batter was more pebbly and formed dough balls easier. I’ll have to try the different liquids the next time. And there will be a next time!

Holy Heck!! These are good. I made them exactly as the recipe called for. I did refrigerate my dough before baking which I do for all cookies I bake, and I did not have a problem rolling them into balls. I also think I used more than 2TB of sugar for coating them. I just threw some sugar in a bowl and rolled them around in there and baked for 10 minutes and they came out so soft! Also you do need to really push them down in order for them to cook flat.

I've made these a bunch of times. They're always a favorite and the first to go! I followed the directions but also chilled the dough before making balls. I found this made the dough much easier to work with!! I flattened mine just slightly with the bottom of a glass and they turned out perfect! Just like the picture!

I LOVED IT! I used a  cookie cutter and made the big thick ginger cookies look like my big thick ginger ! I would add some extra ginger though! Other than that, I recommend it 100%! It was a hit at my party!

i made them because my hubs likes ginger cookies and he says they are good BUT I did refrigerate the dough before making balls because it was very soft and I think I would have cooked it maybe 11 minutes. I cooked it 10.
Also they were flatter than I would have liked so I my try some other ideas from other reviewers next time to see if I can't fix that.

I thought these were good but unexceptional. The spice hardly shows up. Were I to make these again I'd double the spices and add chopped candied ginger. Definitely remove from oven on the early side - for me it was 8 minutes - they will look under baked but this is key to the chewy texture. Rolling them in sugar before flattening helps them not stick to your cup/pan.

Mildly flavored, like a spice version of a sugar cookie. Refrigerated dough, rolled into walnut sized balls, dipped top in sugar and baked on air sheets. Looked store bought they were so uniformly perfect with slightly cracked topped.  Next time I will add more ginger for flavor and dip in larger sugar crystals for showier finish. Make these and cracked sugar cookies to mail to family at Christmas.

I made these this afternoon, and did a little adjusting, and they turned out beautifully!! I used turbinado sugar, much larger crystals of sugar, to roll the cookie dough balls in, and stirred in a handful of candied ginger, right at the end, and they were so amazing my husband took nearly all of them to share with his buddies at work! I will be making another batch tomorrow,  doubling the recipe, and giving a gift of homemade cookies to all our friends as Christmas gifts! This one is a definite keeper!!!

Best recipe ever.  We just stumbled onto this recipe and now my sons and I make them all the time. We follow the recipe exactly as written. Never felt the need to make any changes. They are slightly crispy on the edges with a tasty chewy center. Yummy!
With the cookie scoop I use it makes exactly 3 dozen.

Had to make these! 
Hint- I put the extra sugar in a coffee cup and rolled the dough balls around (easier than rolling on a plate or in a bowl). Easy!!

I made this, probably for the fifth time in a row but I replaced the white sugar with brown sugar and chilled them for ten minutes. They came out so chewy, soft, and delicious. However, next time I'll use around 3/4 of brown sugar and 1/4 of white sugar because they broke a little easily. Will definitely make them again

Fantastic flavor and softness was definitely there!

I didn't follow my first rule for cooking and baking however, which is always try the original recipe once then make adjustments next time if needed. 

So I followed someone's advice here on doubling up the cloves which ended up being just a bit too much.  No ding against the recipe though.  I will make again!

Very good recipe.   These came out perfectly without any tweaking to the ingredients, but next time (based on other reviews) I will try using orange juice? & 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 white sugar.     I did tweak the baking instructions, tho, by using my mom’s method:  Did not flatten the balls, then baked 6 min on a lower rack, then turned tray & moved it to higher rack for another 6 minutes.  The trick is to always have 2 trays in, starting on the lower rack (so with the first tray on the bottom, put an empty tray up top, always rotating up & out.  When the final tray of cookies moves to the top rack, put an empty tray on the bottom).

These cookies are perfect!  As advertised, soft and gingery, these will please the most discriminating cookie palate.  Easy to make, they smell heavenly when baking.  They made for a perfect dessert with a big glass of cold milk.

I'm only giving it 3 stars because I made several changes to the recipe. I added 1/8 tsp of cardamon, 1 tsp of Orange Zest, I used dark brown sugar instead of regular sugar and 2 tsp of candied ginger ground into a paste. With these changes, the cookies were much better.

Best cookie ever!

Here are my personal tweaks if anyone is interested:

Tips:

I added a 1/8 teaspoon of nutmeg to the dry ingredients. Add orange juice instead of the tablespoon of water to the wet ingredients. I added a bit of fresh grated ginger to the wet ingredients also. I waited over an hour before forming the balls which I made super thin as per a recommendation from a reviewer. Took a fork and made lines and added organic sugar to the tops. BEST COOKIE I'VE EVER MADE. Didn't yield 24 cookies but around 19 or 20.

These were great for my first time cooking with molasses! I changed the 1 cup sugar into 3/4 cup sugar + 1 1/2 tsp stevia to cut down on sugar content, though rolling the dough balls in sugar probably made up for that. I wanted cookies that were a little spicier, so I added 1 tbsp finely chopped ginger and 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg. The flavor was definitely enhanced, but I think the best way to get a nice, bold spiciness is to chop up crystallized ginger. I also added another 1 1/2 tablespoons water because the batter just took forever to incorporate. Because of this, I believe that the batter got a little overmixed, which made the cookies drier when baked for a little over 10 minutes. To flatten the dough balls, I lightly scored them with a fork as one would with peanut butter cookies. They didn't spread out very much, which I also attribute to overmixing. I found the best time to be 9 minutes with 15 cookies on a silicone mat.

Wow. Just wow. The flavor is a punch in your mouth, in a good way! I followed the advice of others and used the orange juice in place of water. I scooped with a cookie scoop straight into sugar, rolled, flattened, and baked. They’re super thin and HUGE. Thankfully as thin as they got, they stayed super soft. I’m freezing the next batch of dough to see if they’ll hold a bit smaller shape, instead of spreading so thin. Either way, winner.

Hands down the best cookie recipe ever! 

My gingerdoodles, because that's what everyone has coined them, are the first to go any any event - I get asked to make for fairs and christmas presents and ever year for our christmas gala I can batch make thousands no problems.

My only tip, if you want softer chewier cookies - because who doesn't - melt the butter completely and whip it into an almost frosting like consistency.

These cookies are amazing! I just took them out of the oven, and they taste great, the only issue is they turned out flat, not sure why. I was wondering the reason why? I do want to make them again with orange juice instead of water, and possibly brown sugar.

I agree with substituting orange juice for the water.  I also found I needed way more sugar for rolling the dough in.   So soft chewy and great flavor!

I’ve made this recipe for a few years now and my kids love it, specially my youngest who is picky but he will always ask me to make ginger cookies. I’ve tried others but he likes these the best. Thank you for the recipe!

Love this recipe! I got 24 cookies and they didn’t even last a day! I found my second batch got to sit on the counter for a while and tasted a lot better when they were out of the oven. Also, I used barley flour.

They were very soft! I had a hard time getting them done enough, but that is probably due to just moving to 6000 foot altitude lol! Personal problem, not recipe problem.

The flavor is ok, but the cookies were hard and too brown on the bottom. Maybe lower cooking temp/time and no sugar on the bottom would help.

So, I did these the lazy way. I mixed the dry and wet ingredients separately, but I just whisked them together instead of sifting. I also poured them together in one go, then mixed them by hand instead of getting out the mixer. I used gluten-free flour (Cup For Cup) due to allergies, and butter because I didn't have margarine. I didn't flatten them out because, again, lazy way. Too tired after shopping. Despite the shortcuts and minor ingredient swaps, they taste great. I can't eat this many on my own, so I froze the extras, and they're still great after being thawed. I'm not sure I'd call them "big", but maybe I was supposed to make them bigger. 
They turned out as they were supposed to, they taste great, and they're easy to make. Good recipe.

I made this GF and it was still amazing!  Our new family favourite!  So, I used brown rice flour instead of regular, omitted the cloves since I can't have them, and used light brown sugar instead of white but all in the same amounts and followed everything else and they were great!  No problems forming into balls etc.  Have made twice already now in one week and will be a regular recipe for us.  Thanks!

I found this recipe years ago and it's definitely a permanent favorite. They are my mom's favorite now! I always get huge compliments when I make them. They are truly soft, which is important to me. I'm not a fan of hard cookies at all. I don't make any modifications to the recipe. Perfect as is. (well, sometimes I roll the uncooked dough in a cinnamon sugar mixture instead of just sugar. I'm a cinnamon fanatic. But I leave the dough recipe untouched.)

When my wife was undergoing chemotherapy I made these for her. Delicious and helped keep down the nausea. I share them now with friends who are sick.

Tasty but turned out flat and kinda chewy. I didn’t have to fridge the dough, but that would have helped, especially since the dough was so sticky.

These cookies flattened horribly., and came out hard, not soft. I think they need brown sugar instead of white.

This is really really good, even better then the Better Homes & Gardens recipe I normally use.  I substituted butter for margarine as butter gives it a richer flavor, added a dash if nutmeg and omitted the tablespoon of water.  I did not have a problem with the cookies flattening.  This will now be my go-to for ginger cookies!

Love these cookies!! They are now my signature "road-trip" treat; my friends only laughed at my "grandma cookies" until they had one, now they ask if I'm bringing them every time.  ;)   Great recipe as written, though I do like the touch of orange juice, and I've been experimenting with adding a little Chinese Five Spice. Just make a double batch already- you won't regret it.

These were pretty good, but not the best cookies of its type.  Followed recipe exactly, but not going to make them again. I will go back to the original one I used in my catering business.

Delicious! Used butter instead of margarine. Also only used 1/2 cup of sugar because we don't like so much sugar in food. They still turned out awesome. Easy to make.

I honestly chose these because I thought they might satisfy my sweet tooth without being so good that I would want to eat them all. I was wrong. They are delicious and spicy, and I have no self control so I still eat too many cookies in one sitting when I make these.

Yum.  I accidentally used butter (about 3/4 C.) and they were pretty sticky and ended up being very soft and too buttery.  The next pan full I added about 1/4 C more flour and that was too much (still very good, just didn't flatten much).  Next time I will split the difference and add 1/4 C flour to the whole batch and leave the butter as is, or decrease the butter and add a little water and leave the flour as is.  Either way, it had just the right amount of molasses and spice.

This is a very good soft ginger cookie.  I was pretty faithful to the recipe.  I didn't have any fresh ginger on hand, so I used 2 thawed cubes of Dorot grated ginger.  This was supposedly two teaspoons, but it wasn't gingery enough for me when I tasted it, so I added a half teaspoon dried ginger as well.  The directions say to bake for 10 minutes, but that just wasn't done enough. I suggest at least 12 minutes, or until they are well cracked.  I'd like them to be a bit more spicy and may fool with that next time.  My only disappointment is that it only makes 24 cookies!  Great recipe.

Yum! Love these. I live in a high altitude area, so I baked mine for the full 10 min and they turned out great. To flatten, I used a glass, with a smooth bottom, and lightly dipped in sugar so that they wouldn't stick. Will be making these again and again!

My kids really like this recipe. Every time I make it, it's gone within a day or two. I've made this recipe several times both with and without water. The dough is easier to form into little balls without the water. They're still super soft and very yummy without the water.

SO SO good. Have made these several times now. No changes - DO use margarine, I think that helps them to not be so flat. They aren't as thick and chewy as the photo shows, but who cares. They don't dry out, they don't get crunchy, and they don't last long enough for any of that to matter! AWESOME

These cookies are scrumptious.  I read some of the negative reviews and have a few suggestions.  
1. You must refrigerate the dough before forming cookies.  The dough is very sticky.  I  recommend at least one hour in the fridge.  Not sure why the recipe does not say that. 2.  Butter is better in this recipe than margarine, both for taste and consistency.  Butter should be soft but not warm and melting.  3.  If your recipe is "soupy" you need to check your measurements.  The dough is soft and sticky, but not soupy.  4.  If you are not sure whether you like the taste of molasses or cloves, don't make these.  These are strong flavors and IMHO are two ingredients that make the cookies delicious.  5.  I baked the cookies for 12 minutes, and my oven is spot on with temperature.  6.  Let the cookies sit on the cookie sheet for a few minutes before trying to remove them.  Otherwise, they fall apart.  7.  If you are making these cookies for a holiday gift or a cookie display, you may be disappointed in their appearance unless you find a way to decorate them.  They are somewhat flat and a bit plain.  That said, appearances are deceiving when it comes to these cookies.

Very good, soft cookies. This was my first time ever using molasses. I'm so glad I decided to bake these cookies. Like  other reviewers, I substituted orange juice for the water and refrigerated the dough for one hour. The dough was still really sticky, so I used 2 spoons to drop my cookies. Then I sprinkled with sugar. I enjoyed the spicy flavor and will make these again.

These cookies turned out great! I did supplement gluten free flour (Pamela’s All Purpose Flour) to accommodate for Celiacs. Other than that, I followed the recipe as posted. The resulting cookies have a nice light crisp on the outside with a soft, cake-like inside. Couldn’t wait until they cooled completely because they smelled devine.

Ok, so first trial run, made recipe exactly , loved flavor, disappointed when cookies were flat. Also read alot of the reviews...So now on my 5th batch.! My family and friends "Love" them. Ive been told to always have this cookie dough  in refrig. Lol. I must say I agree, so good with morning coffee, snack, after dinner with ice cream. So these are my changes, first added kinda heaping extra 1/4 cup of wheat flour, sifted all & added nutmeg, fresh cracked black pepper to taste also in dry ingreds. Used unsalted real butter and really whipped  and continued whipping with sugar, till very fluffy, then egg, used orange juice instead of water or lemon juice. Lil of the zest also & added flour mixture in 1/2 cup batches mixing well each time. No need to chill, they roll very nice,  I roll in cinnamon/ sugar and bake usually around 10 mins. They come out  soft and chewy, litely crisp around edges and puffy and yummy. Delish and very addictive.!!

Delicious! I added 3/4 chopped candied ginger and used butter instead of margarine.  A short chill in the frig (30 min as directed) and leaving them as balls (not flattening) allowed mine to crinkle and stay thick.  Will make again.

These have a great spicy taste; I didn't have cloves so I substituted nutmeg in the same amount. I have made 5 batches just as written and they've all turned out deliciously

I made these as part of holiday care packages for friends, and would highly recommend! I took the advice of other reviewers though, and doubled the spices - definitely more flavorful and spicy, which is the type of cookie I prefer :)

I followed this recipe exactly and ended up with very biscuity/cakey cookies. Very round, rather dry, and a bit bland, but not too bad.

Second time I went down to 2 cups of flour and added an extra egg yolk (one full egg + one egg yolk). I also went up to 3 tsp ginger, 2 tsp cinnamon, and 1 full teaspoon cloves. I also added a tbsp of orange juice, as recommended by one other reviewer. (apparently it brings out the other flavors?) I liked the second version significantly better, and they came out more chewy and less crumbly. 

Good starting point for a recipe, though I'm very confused how anyone got those pictures from 2 1/4 cups of flour. (Disclaimer: although I spooned in the flour the first time, I don't own a baking scale, so maybe my measuring was off.)

Hands down the best soft ginger cookie.  Only thing I changed is ginger to 1 tablespoon and cinnamon to 1 teaspoon.  Next time I will use 1 tablespoon of orange juice instead of water as others suggested or maybe even Grand Marnier.

I substituted molasses with maple syrup as I couldn’t find them  in the store near my place. The cookies came out really soft and were  much appreciated by all. I feel that ginger could be increased as it didn’t pack enough heat.

My sister's mother-in-law, Nana, makes molasses cookies and my son loves them. I tried her recipe, epic fail. I tried these cookies these are the best cookies I've ever made in my life. I'm Italian and make a lot of Italian cookies that I love....these were a showstopper at Christmas. I made a double batch and brought some to work, thought they would last a couple of days all gone. I doubled the recipe and the only thing I did was cut the ginger in half because my family aren't a huge Ginger fan and they were perfect. I couldn't believe they stayed soft, they were amazing! The first time I made them, I put the dough in the fridge while I cleaned up and the dough was perfect,  not gooey.

These cookies are delicious, but the recipe needs a little tweaking to get the consistency right. As written, the cookies will spread out a lot while baking and don’t hold together well. I made these changes and they came out perfect:
- Use slightly softened butter instead of margarine
- Replace water with orange juice, as other reviews recommend
- Add about 1/4 cup additional flour
- Freeze dough for about 30 minutes before baking
- Double the baking soda 
- Don't flatten when placed on baking sheet
- Double the ground ginger

These are very good cookies, I increased the ground ginger to 1 Tbsp, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp ground cloves and added 1/4 tsp of ground black pepper., instead of margarine I used butter flavored Crisco and dark brown sugar instead of white. They are soft and spicy! Used sanding sugar on the top.

Made these the first time this Christmas season, they were fantastic. I used butter instead of margarine and added  slightly more molasses than required (about 1Tbsp).  I prepared the dough ahead and kept it refrigerated so i could bake them fresh each day. The cookies taste great and are soft. My 30 year old niece refused to believe they weren't  store bought!

Made double batches twice for the holidays and they were a huge hit both times!  Easy, quick, and fun to make.  We doubled the warm spices to give them a little more of a bite (like traditional ginger snaps) and we were happy with the results.  In our convection oven, 10 minutes was perfect.  Each batch (single) made about 30 cookies.  Definitely saving this recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

Note: leave refrigerated (or outside in the winter, in my case) for half an hour before baking. Makes forming balls easier!

As others have noted, the batter/dough tastes amazing, but these cookies are nearly impossible to make. I've made them twice now. The first attempt, I ended up using nearly double the flour to try and get the dough to a consistency that would form into balls. they ended up tasting like gingerbread(ish) scones. The 2nd attempt, I followed the recipe exactly, then stuck the dough in the fridge for just under 24 hours. Tried to roll into balls... failed miserably... tossed everything in the freezer for a couple of hours. Managed to get 12 spoonfuls of dough rolled in sugar and onto cookie sheets, but they still wouldn't roll into balls. Will not be making again.

An awful waste of time and ingredients.  Recipe was followed to the letter and yielded flat, greasy cookies that taste like oily cloves.  Baked two batches thinking I had done something wrong and both were equally terrible.

Pretty easy to make and delicious! Hoping they stay nice and chewy/ soft for 2 days until they are served as part of Christmas dessert.

I followed the recipe and these came out delicious. They are soft and chewy as well! To make preparation easier, I used my cookie scoop to drop dough into a small bowl of sugar to fully coat them.  Then I baked them for 9min. Delicious!

These cookies were excellent! The only thing I changed is that I prefer butter over margerine. I also found that this recipe made approx 30 cookies so I ended up using more sugar to roll the balls in before placing them on the pan. I will definitely be using this recipe again though. Yum!

this cookies are great! but I have some recomendatiins. 1. add less sugar (1 cup sugar + 1/4cup molasses and sugar to roll the dough - it is too much, at least for me (commonly I add 1 cup of sugar for 3 cups of flour, so for this recipe 3/4 cup. but since we have molasses here, I would add 1/4cup sugar, or no sugar at all). 2. let the mixture sit in the fridge for about 30-40min and stir it occasionally to let the dough thicken everywhere. 3. flatten the cookie with a glass very well to get this form from a video. 4. when I rolled my cookies the dough was pretty hard (because it stayed in the fridge) and it is very easy to roll it. first I made all cookie balls, then rolled them in sugar. when you make one ball, then roll it in sugar and start to make another ball - you add sugar, that sticked to your fingers, to the dough and it is a lot of sugar. after you rolled all cookies - flatten them with a glass.

These have become my signature cookies! People absolutely love them! the only change I make is to add a lot more of the spices. I also substituted applesauce for the egg to make it vegan and those turned out incredibly well to!

Absolutely delicious cookies!their moist and yummy! I read some of the other reviews and I didn’t have any of the same issues. I used earth balance margarine, my dough was slightly sticky but I was able to make the balls without any sticking issues. I didn’t flatten the balls before baking and the came out perfectly shaped. If you like ginger snap cookies these are a softer version. Don’t over-bake them or they won’t be soft. Slightly brown is perfect! We love them in my house!

These cookies are the most chewy gingerbread cookies I've ever had!  I substituted orange juice for the water, and used half brown sugar/ half white sugar.  Simply perfect!  One additional add:  I use the sugar cookie glaze flavored with orange extract.  It adds a great "zest" that really emphasizes the ginger flavor : )

I've made this cookie recipe for years and I love it. I always come back to it every Christmas. I've had someone tell me she doesn't like gingerbread cookies, but she likes these. I use butter instead of margarine (not a fan of margarine). One thing I always experiment with is the time. For me, they always come out too soft and flat when I cook them for only 10 minutes. (They're still a bit raw in the middle and they can't hold their form so when they come out of the oven they flatten out and lose all their puff, Maybe it's my oven???) I forget every year and always end up adding more time (12-15 total minutes) for the second batch. They come out perfect.

This recipe turned out great and made about 4 dozen cookies for me. The only thing I did differently was to use butter instead of margarine and I put the cookie dough in the refrigerator as other reviewers suggested before rolling into walnut sized balls. Just as everyone else experienced, my cookies were gobbled up quickly with everyone asking for the recipe. Thanks for sharing it!!

Delicious. As has Bern stated before, the dough is quite sticky but if you let it rest for 45-60 minuters it gets easier to roll.

The flavor is delicious (I used fresh grated ginger and squeezed an orange in place of water), but alas, baking at 7000 feet of elevation flattened my cookies and stuck them to the pan.

I only made one change to the recipe. I used butter instead of margarine. The cookies came out perfect ??! They were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I absolutely loved them. As several people recommend, I put the dough in the refrigerator after mixing.

I will make it again, and with my changes.  I used only 1/2 cup (1 stick) of unsalted butter (which I microwaved for 15 seconds before fluffing), and I also used1 cup Splenda Baking Blend (the bag with the orange banner - it's part Splenda and part sugar, and can be used measure for measure in this recipe). These changes made the cookie a little more Diabetic friendly, and lowered the sodium as well. It's a great cookie!

Been making this recipe for many years now but never bothered to review. My favorite cookie.  Our changes:

We put the walnut size balls of dough into the freezer for ~10 minutes before baking. When we put them on the cookie sheet after rolling in sugar we flatten them to between 1/4" and 1/2".

The order of mixing is super important.

In most ovens a 1 Tbsp scoop (~walnut sized) takes about 10 minutes, but it usually takes until the second batch to get the timing right. Undercooking is better than overcooking by far.

Oh, and we have never used margarine, always unsalted butter with this recipe. We tried the grand marnier thing, tried orange juice instead of the water, too, and never noticed a difference. We tried the brown sugar instead of  or in combo with the molasses and prefer the original recipe.

If you do it right you get a great, thick, soft, chewy cookie with a big rush of flavor and perfect mouthfeel.

I loved it! I did refrigerate the dough to make it easier to roll and you’ll need a couple more minutes on the bake time.

Great recipe! I did make 3 small changes. I used 1 stick real butter as I do not use margarine for anything. I used an orang liquor in place of the water, and I added a half teaspoon more of ginger because o love ginger! My husband will have these gone in no time .

I've made this several times. I use butter and I somewhat melt the butter in the microwave before I mix it. I like them flatter and chewier than the margarine at room temp makes them.

These were really, really good.  I did substitute orange juice for water and couldn't say if it made much of a difference because I didn't make them with water to compare.  I certainly wouldn't change a thing.

Delicious cookies. The only change I made on a second batch, was, to double the spices. They y are a huge hit, especially at Christmas.

These were simple and DELICIOUS. I used orange juice instead of water as suggested by others.  I also took the suggestion of dropping the dough in the sugar and then working them into balls.  It wasn’t hard to work with that way.  I didn’t flatten them out too much, rather made a bit of a thumb print in them.  They’re crispy on the outside and a little soft inside.   I also added a dash of nutmeg to the batter to intensify the flavours.  VERY GOOD. My husband says they’re like his mom’s (big shoes to fill)

I've made this several times. I love to make it with butter, but recently tried coconut oil for a nondairy option. It worked great! Still just as soft. I like the flavor of an extra dash of salt. They are ready to come out of the oven when they start to crack. No need to refrigerate, but might pop them in a cooler place  away from the hot oven in between batches.

They don't look anything like the first photo when you follow the recipe to a T, but they do look like several of the next few pictures.  Expect air bubbles and flat cookies, not cracks and thick cookies. Also, the sugar will melt into the cookie and disappear.  A tasty cookie, but I was disappointed they didn't look just right for a special event I'd planned to take them to.  Now I'm going to make an orange glaze to drizzle over the top to disguise them because they aren't much to look at right now.

I used butter because I didn’t have margarine and 1/3 c brown and 2/3 c white, again because that’s all I had. I made the balls about the size of a grape, rolled in sugar and then flattened. Baked for 8 mins, had a nice crackle top but still soft. Size of cookie perfect (2 in diameter). Hiding them from my family now!

These cookies came out delicious. The only issue I had was the dough was a little too wet to roll into balls so I dropped them onto the cookie sheet instead. They're very soft and incredibly yummy. I will be baking these as Christmas gifts this season.

I used to make these all the time and years ago I lost the recipe. Happily, I found it here! 
These are absolutely one of my favorites. So good, crispy-soft, and the mixture of textures is just right. The spiciness is perfect and I'm making a batch tonight because I've missed them!

This recipe is now in my family cookbook album.  I made one batch and my margarine was frozen so I made them with unsalted butter.  They turned out AMAZING!!! Before they were cooled and while I still had all the ingredients out, I made a second batch (doubled) with margarine.  I had no issues with rolling them out or the dough being sticky.  My six littles helped me roll them into balls and in the sugar and put them on the pans.  They baked wonderfully in about 9 minutes and flattened the perfect amount.  This will definitely be one of my go-to recipes when I want a ginger cookie fix without the hassle of rolling and cutting out.  My whole family loved them and my husband took a couple dozen to work with him this morning.  I have a feeling I'll be making more in a few days as we won't make it to Christmas with these batches.

Always buy fresh spices for this recipe and a good quality to. It makes a difference. I bought McCormick (red top) and Badia brand (found in the international Hispanic food section) of each spice needed. McCormick was far superior in smell and taste.But for a milder less pungent Badia is good. So to give any recipe a fair review start with fresh good quality spices/herbs etc not what’s been in the cupboard from a year ago. I also added finely chopped candied ginger(Trader Joe’s) I have a small mini food processor for cutting up ginger. I used six 3x1inch pieces but adjust to your taste

I've used this recipe for years now and people always say they love it! Perfect amount of spice and sweetness, and it does stay soft and chewy even after a while!

Just made a batch for my  family. I made them according to the recipe with one exception.  I refrigerated the dough as others suggested  and it was much easier to handle. They taste great but are a little flat but Papa and the grandbabies don't really care about how they look. :-)
May use OJ instead of water as others suggested next time just to mix it up a little.
GRANDCHILD FOLLOWUP: The 9, 6 and 3 year olds ate them all before an adult could intervene. I will be making more later this week.

These were quick and easy to make!

They taste SO GOOD TOO.. 

I put the trays in the oven and then turned around and saw the ginger sitting on the counter... so they are less ginger than they were meant to be, well, they are zero ginger.. but they still taste amazing!!

I added a 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and 1/4 of ground cloves and just 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and it worked well!

Will make again, and remember the ginger next time!! :-)

These cookies are delicious. I used the recommendations of others and they came out great. The only thing I would point out is the recipe calls for 2 tablespoons of sugar in the ingredients and the directions call for 1 cup of sugar, 1 cup is needed.

Very good!  Used OJ instead of water as recommended.  To my 2nd batch I added semisweet mini chocolate chips. A really good addition that the kids loved.

I didn't change a thing & these cookies were delicious. Very thick & soft with a nice ginger flavor.  I did have to chill the dough for a bit to be able to roll the cookies into balls. I did not press them down on the cookie sheet. Just rolled them in sugar & baked them & they were perfect.

Delicious cookies! They'll come out looking a little undercooked but don't worry. If you cook them until they look done they'll be very hard, more like ginger snaps-still delicious though!

Excellent and irresistible. I made as directed and took the tip about scooping the dough onto plate of sanding sugar since it’s so sticky. I had to cook longer and left on the pan to firm up

Loved this cookie.  It is truly a pantry cookie for me, I always have the ingredients in my home.  I did up the ginger to a tablespoon, and was generous with my cinnamon measurement. I used orange juice instead of water because I had it on hand.  I put the dough together in the evening and baked off the following morning.   I will definitely make again, my family loved them.

I used butter instead of margarine as that is what I had and perhaps that caused to spread a bit too much. They turned out thing but nice and soft, with a bit of crunch at the edges. Really good tasting! Will definitively make again!

Followed the recipe to a T and it was the best cookies EVER! My husband eats them daily and so do our kids and he takes them to work and shares with his co-workers who claim they're the best "gingersnaps" they've ever had. Plan to keep making some to keep around for a quick snack. 2 thumbs up!!

This is a fabulous cookie!  I did add more spices, such as, allspice and nutmeg I also chopped up candied ginger and fresh ginger to up the ginger factor. And used brown sugar for half of the white.  The flavor is exceptional and the cookies stayed soft.  Just a heads up, the batter is very sticky.  I will definitely make these again!

Good recipe but when I flattened them a little and then put the dough in the oven they came out too flat. So next time no pre flattening.

Its a good cookie. I put too much citrus and it came out too orangey and not as spicy as I would have liked. But overall tasty.

Followed recipe exactly adding the oj instead of the water and refrigerating the dough. My cookies came out a bit too flat for my taste. Reminded me more of a ginger snap more than a big and soft cookie. I bake all the time with great success, so I'm not sure why they were so flat. Will probably play around and increase flour and egg.
They were delicious. I just wanted them to look like the picture. :)

These are amazing! I added just a pinch extra of the Ginger, Cloves & Cinnamon though because we love a STRONG flavor!   I made 3 batches.  I sifted all 3 times but I sifted the last batch 4 times and they were EXTRA fluffy!

Love these! I have made them many times. 

I use butter instead of margarine, and agave syrup instead of molasses.  I omit the water and the extra sugar you are supposed to roll the cookies in.  I only cook for 7 minutes and take the cookies out when they still look undercooked, because they will continue cooking when out of the oven.  Makes about 27-28 cookies.

No changes needed... just don't forget to flatten them before you put them in the oven.  I suspect that if you wanted a slightly crispier/chewier cookie, flattening them out even more would probably do the trick.  And these are SO good with a hot cup of tea on a cool day!

These weren't quite what I was looking for, although that's more my fault than the recipe's. I hadn't realized that they'd be just soft, not chewy. Still, I love pretty much any form of molasses or ginger cookie, so these still satisfied my craving. I didn't have any white sugar, so I used brown sugar instead, which I think just made them all the more flavorful.

Wonderful! I used butter instead of margarine (which I don't use) and ginger that earlier I had dehydrated and coarsely ground. The ginger gave a nice zing while the butter imparted a nice, rich flavor.

Liked the cookie a lot.  It was easy to make, and they turned out precisely as pictured in the photo.  I am going to try some of the alternatives suggested by others who prepared them to find the one I like the best.  Good recipe.

I was a bit disappointed in this recipe.  My test cookies were really flat, so a added a bit more flour--twice--but just didn't seem to do the trick.  The flavor was pretty good, but don't think I will make these again.

A few complained about the cookies being too "flat"; one way to combat this is to add an extra egg, makes it a bit fluffier, softer. However, I personally prefer these kinds of cookies chewy but flat-ish, so next time I will use only one egg. I also did not have margarine, so used butter, instead.

You may want to put water on your hands when rolling the dough into balls, it makes the cookies more moist, and keeps them from sticking on your hands. But DO NOT add directly into dough.

I've been making this recipe for years; it's my bombproof cookie recipe!! Some tips I've followed from reviews here are substituting the water for orange juice, and refrigerating the dough before rolling (very sticky). I can never make enough of these, they're not necessarily the most enticing-looking cookie you can make, but once people try one they can't stop and beg for them to be made again ;)

I make these for just about every kind of social gathering or potluck event. SO SO SO amazing! They taste better the next day, but still a really good cookie day one. I love that they aren't to ginger-y. Sometimes gingersnaps kind of hurt your mouth because they are so full of spice, and these aren't that way at all! Just a really quality cookie, and so easy to make!

Love these. I made these today and they came out great. I don't like cinnamon much, so I used only 1/8 tsp of cinnamon and added 1/8 tsp nutmeg. I also used a touch less cloves because I thought it was too much. I mix everything by hand; I don't have an electric mixer. They took 13 minutes to cook in my oven but cookies tend to take longer in my oven from my experience. They taste wonderful. I am so happy to have a reliable recipe for soft ginger molasses cookies. Just so you know, if you watch the video, you can see how these cookies actually look after baking. They do not look as crackled as the photo. I got more than the 24 the video says you get, but they weren't quite as large as shown either. Highly recommended.

These are simply yummy.  Even better than I thought.  
The only thing the mixture was too soft for me to roll in the sugar but it didn't matter.

OMG I loved this recipe I didn't have any butter so I just used olive oil and it worked like a charm although it was a bit hard to well get the dough hard but eventually worked all you to do is freeze it for a bit though I think that coconut oil would have worked better it still tasted great I wold definitely make again. :) :)

Loved them! It’s my wife’s favorite cookie now. I did, however, substitute vegetable shortening instead of butter. I then baked it as a drop cookie and they turned out beautiful!  No pressing or refrigeration needed.

After reading the reviews, I decided to add  1 T molasses, 1/2 T water and 5 T brown sugar to combat the wetness problem. These cookies were perfectly baked after 9 min, soft and with a cracked top. However, they strongly tasted of butter and they lacked some of the sharpness of a typical spice cookie. I will try them again with no substitutions and 1/2 t more ginger.

Fabulous cookies! Instead of rolling them in sugar, I glazed them with  1 Cup Icing Sugar and 2 1/2 to 3 TB fresh lemon juice and brushed it on while they were still warm.  Awesome!

I have made this recipe many times and is loved by my family. I use gluten free flour because some people are allergic to gluten in my family and they worked perfect!! This recipe is by far one of my favorite cookie recipes; my go to.

My favorite cookie recipe, tweaked slightly: 

4x the ginger, 2x the cinnamon, replace butter with coconut oil 1:1. They come out puffy. We fight over whether that's good or bad. Optional step: Smoosh them as they come out of the oven for dense, chewy cookies.

Even though i used a high quality ginger and even added a bit extra, these cookies didn't have the ginger  taste like ginger cookies normally do.  Very bland taste.

These are great! I only used 1 tsp of ground ginger but I added a bunch of diced crystallized ginger (probably around 1/4 cup) to the batter before adding the dry ingredients. It turned out fantastic and added a little more chewiness and spice.

These are fantastic cookies! The only change I made was to use butter instead of margarine. I flattened the rolled dough balls  with the flat bottom of a glass (to about 1/2" or 1cm thick). They turned out evenly sized and perfectly round.

I added 1/2 tsp of cranberry juice 1/2 tsp of orange juice instead of the water. and a dash of nutmeg and cream of tartar and some extra ginger. I’m vegan so I substituted vegan margarine and a banana for the egg came out amazing! I made sure to chill the dough for 30 mins and I cooked a little longer since I made larger cookies. Didn’t last a whole day in my house love them so much!

I've made these twice now and we love them!  The first time I made them, I wasn't sure they were fully baked because of the way they looked and so I overbaked some.  The baking time is about right.  I also have realized that baking on the top vs bottom oven rack makes a big difference.  In order to get them to look like the picture, I have to bake on top rack.  If I bake on bottom rack, the bottom burns before the top rises and "cracks" like the picture shows.  I rolled mine in Turbinado sugar (plenty of it) before baking and that was preferred to the regular sugar in the recipe.

So yummy!  The only change I made was 1/4 cup of coconut oil instead of all the butter it called for.  I used 1/2 of butter instead of 3/4. The only reason, was that I didn't have another stick of butter.  I don't think it changed it too much, because they turned out perfect.

At home, at work people said they were addictive and wanted more. My husband even asked if HE could make a batch on his own.  He doesn't cook!
A keeper.  Were perfect. Made as is, came out to about 36 cookies.  Refrigerated half an hour before  making balls.

These cookies are delicious. I have made them at least 5 times and everybody always raves about them. The only change that I made is that I added an extra 1/2 tsp of ginger and 1/4 tsp of cloves, just to add more flavour.

Amazing recipe! The cookies came out super soft, and stayed that way for days. I would recommend adding a little bit more ginger for those looking for those looking for that classic gingersnap spice. The ginger was a little harder to taste.

I made these to pass out to my neighbors for Christmas. They were so good, I didn't want to give any away! I'll be making them again. It's a good choice for a classic ginger cookie.

I wanted to try out a new recipe for ginger cookies.  They did stay nice and soft, but I thought the amount of molasses was too much.  The molasses seemed to overpower the other flavors.

These cookies were just what I was looking for!  I followed the recipe with exception of orange juice instead of  the water.  because I was making 3 different cookies and have one mixer I wrapped them in plastic wrap and refrigerated them until I was finished with the other 2.  I had no problem with rolling and baking these cold.  I rolled them in a mixture of turbinado and white shimmer sugar gems (which made them very festive!) and just flattened them slightly.  They baked perfectly and were the very best ginger cookies I have baked!  Even people who said they were not partial to gingerbread loved them.  I'll be making these cookies over and over!  Thanks so much for posting this recipe!

These were a huge hit!!!! I made these a previous time and decided to tweet the recipe based on reviews. I added more cinnamon, some nutmeg, and an Indian seasoning called ‘Spice Bouquet’ (includes anise). I added very finely chopped fresh ginger and substituted water for Cointreau liqueur. I used half white sugar and half brown sugar. I placed the dough in the refrigerator for 15-20 min. I wet my hands while rolling the balls to keep the dough from sticking to my hands.

Changing the water to orange juice was a great suggestion! I doubled the receipt when I made these, and chose to substitute the margarine for half-butter, half-shortening; I also did half white, half brown sugar. The dough wasn't too sticky to work with at all. I made XL walnut-sized balls, pressed down slightly, and out came perfectly moist, thick cookies, not too sweet but definitely sweet enough, with terrific ginger/clove/molasses flavor! (Doubling up and my chosen sizing made around 40 cookies. These cookies would've stayed moist for well over a week I think, but they were all gone in a few days!)

Was going to make it exactly as written but found out I did not have margarine on hand. Substituted butter and these came out great. On my first batch the dough was sticky to roll into balls and I pressed them down a bit to pre-flatten. Turns out they spread pretty thin and flat. Still soft and tasty though. Chilled the dough longer for the second batch and rolling the balls was easier and I put them in the oven that way. Came out a nice thickness and looked liked the pictures.

Just like everyone else said, "they were  great!"  Anyone who took their first bite of the cookies, LOVED THEM!  
My modifications were using butter,instead of the margarine, orange juice instead of water, brown sugar instead of white for the dough.  Since I used the suggestion of coating  with sugar prior to rolling the ball with 1/2 of my dough.  They turned out to sweet.  Rolling out the ball first then coat with sugar would be my preferred method.

I live at 7000 feet so I adjusted the recipe for high altitude,  I added extra flour  2 TBSP and added extra water  2 tsps.  then baked at 350 with my convention oven.  They were perfect and truly delicious and looked great.

These cookies are amazing and so easy to make. I made it pretty much exactly as written, I only substituted the water for orange juice and put the dough in the freezer for 30 min before rolling. They have the perfect sweetness and ginger taste, they are soft and chewy and turned out perfect . I would give this a 100 stars if I could.

My supervisor made these and I couldn't even stop at 2 cookies!  I requested the recipe and made it the very next day.  My friends couldn't stop at two either!  Was a little scared while making it because they didn't seem to make nice balls but they were amazing and turned out great.

I didn't have margarine so I used butter. But then I didn't have enough of that and had to go buy margarine in the end. Lol. The end result was that I used about 3/4 butter and 1/4 of margarine. My dough turned out thick and easy to use. Tasted pretty good and was soft. Today I used margarine and the dough was very sticky in comparison. So another option for people.

Even altered to be VEGAN these cookies are awesome!  Just subbed butter flavored Crisco for the margarine and a flax egg (1 T ground flaxseed and 3 T water mixed and set aside for a few minutes) for the egg, and added additional water, about two more tablespoons, until the consistency of the dough seemed right. Everything else was kept the same.  Super easy and super yummy!

This recipe definitely makes larger sized cookies. The second time I made it I made slightly smaller cookies (30 instead of 24) you could probably even go a bit smaller. Also changed the water for orange juice as a few others suggested. Overall really great cookie!

So disappointing! The dough was way too sticky to roll into balls with the recipe as is, so I added more flour knowing that it might change the consistency of the cookie, but what was I to do.  Cookies were not soft or flavorful. Need to find another recipe.

They should call these ‘disappearing ginger cookies’ cause they don’t last long...I even had little “elves” coming down to the kitchen in the middle of the night to snack on these...Santa has requested these for Christmas Eve...

I added chopped up candied ginger into the dough.  If I were to make these again, I would add more seasonings...  (Cinnamon & Ginger).  This is a lovely product, and I will likely do it again.

These are really good.  We had to make them vegan for our girl scout troop so we replaced the butter with coconut oil and the egg with a banana.  We also decided to just double the cinnamon....well...because.

I found this recipe here a couple of years ago and make them every year at Christmas.  Just made a batch for my neighbours and they loved them.  Wonderful flavor and texture and very easy to make.  A keeper.

Delicious flavor!  But I used butter instead of margarine and they "ran" a bit.  I put the dough in the fridge for awhile, and then tried again, same result.  Any help out there?

I found these cookies easy to make and very tasty. I baked for 8 minutes as we prefer a really soft cookie. I will be keeping this recipe and making it again and again.

These were easy to make and very good!  My husband loved them!  They are nice and soft and spiced just right.  Instead of covering them in plain sugar I just sprinkled some red and green sugar on them to have Christmas colors.

These turned out perfectly! Crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside and a beautiful balance of the molasses and sweetness. I made these for a holiday party and they were gone almost instantly. I’ve now shared the recipe with almost every guest at the party. And I’ll be making these again for my family next weekend. So. GOOD!

Yes, the dough is soft. Just pop it into the fridge for an hour to harden it up a bit.

Flavor was spot on. Cookies were definitely soft. But I should have read the reviews first  (which suggested chilling the dough) because my cookies melted into one large cookies once I placed them in the oven. However, I think I prefer a flatter cookie.

So tasty!  I didn't change any of the ingredients, but I did chill the dough for 30 minutes to make it easier to handle.  It's pretty sticky.  The first batch I made too crispy so they're a bit like ginger snaps, but the second batch I made softer and the softer cookie brings out the taste of the spices really well.  Tasty!

This is a fabulous recipe! For the longest time I changed absolutely nothing.  As I am allergic to eggs I did sub out the eggs and used 2 flax eggs  ( 1 tablespoon ground flax in 3 tablespoons water).    I also added chopped candied ginger about the size of mini chocolate chips.  Also semi sweet chocolate chips work well in this recipe also.

I made them 2 inches wide after using a small scoop to form balls. I cooked one batch to the time listed. They turned out crisp. The second batch got 2 min less in the oven which worked out better. I had to adjust for smaller cookies. The flavour is excellent.

My 10 year old and I call these "speed cookies" because we can get them mixed up before the oven is even heated up!  My husband (who hates gingerbread) even likes these!

I've been making gingersnaps for years from the BHG cookbook. These, however, turned out perfectly and just like the name. They are big, soft and beautifully cracked. Since I'm at high altitude I only omitted the water and added a couple Tbsp flour. I thought they could've been 'spicier' but my husband just kept eating them.

I will not make it again. I changed it into food for the chipmunks outside. turned out flat and the use of cloves made the flavor nasty. I love cloves on my ham for easter , but cookies. no.

So good! We've been using a store-bought mix for our gingerbread cookies for years, but not after finding this recipe! I started making it and realized that I didn't have any ginger. Uhhh, that was kind of silly on my part (they're GINGERbread cookies, after all), but I ended up simply adding 1 teaspoon of cinnamon instead of 3/4. They were great! I did take some other reviewers' advice and let the dough rest in the fridge for about 30 minutes before baking. This really did make the dough a lot less sticky and a lot easier to work with. My cookies took about 10 minutes to bake. Of course, they're so flavorful on their own, but we're frosting addicts, so I put some vanilla frosting I found in my pantry on them. YUM! Thanks so much for the recipe and for all the tips!

These cookies did come out soft and delicious, however the dough was so sticky, even after freezing 45minutes, it was difficult to work with. If I do decide they are worth the trouble to make again, I will try the orange juice in lieu of water and the cooking spray on my hands to prevent the sticky mess as I've seen done by previous reviewers. I've also seen others say they used brown sugar in place of molasses but they didn't comment on how it affected the flavor, so I'm not sure if I will try that route yet.. yummy cookies if you're willing to put in the effort though!

The texture of these cookies was perfect, but I was disappointed, because they're rather bland for my tastes. Next time I would increase the amounts of the spices by 50%, and use half brown sugar/half white sugar, instead of all white sugar.

Ginger cookies are my favorite cookies in the world.  Been making homemade ginger cookies for many years.  However, this recipe was not great.  I followed the recipe to the letter and the first thing I noticed was the dough was too light in color.  The recipe could use more ginger, more molasses and less salt.  The cookies did bake up nice and soft.

Made these last night and they turned out great! nice, simple recipe. didn't have to chill or freeze my dough, just floured my hands and they were easy to form into balls. Used the bottom of a beer glass to flatten them slightly and they turned out beautifully, just like the pictures. I think it could have been spicier- not gingery enough for me, so next time I think I will use fresh ginger and will try substituting the water with orange juice or some sort of liquer like recommended by others.

Awesome cookie. Very fragrant and delicious. Because I'm gluten free, I've substituted almond flour for wheat flour and added 1/2 cup coconut flour for substance. I did put my dough in the freezer for about ten minutes to help stiffen it up.  When going GF you do not need to flatten the cookies, they spread out just fine in their own. I also added a cream cheese drizzle by mixing powdered sugar, melted butter, cream cheese and vanilla extract to desired consistency. Hubby loved them!!

I followed the recipe except added a little more spice and threw in some cardamon , dried orange peel and used orange juice instead of water. They turned out chewy and soft on the inside a slight crisp on the outside. Mine did not crackle very much on top ( no where near what the picture looks like) but I figure that is about as important as the fork lines on a peanut butter cookie.  They also were not big and puffy but not to flat either.They were delicious and I will absolutely make again.

FREEZE THE DOUGH FOR 15 MINUTES BEFORE SHAPING THE COOKIES!!!
I followed the recipe exactly. However, the margarine and sugar curled and I end up with a very soft, almost foam texture dough.  
I wasn't really sure what to do (since it didn't look anything like  the one on the video) so I used an ice cream scoop and baked the cookies.
I wish I had read some of the reviews recommending to freeze the dough for 15 minutes before shaping them. 
Oh well, they turned out to be delicious.

Shared with friends and family. Everyone said they were the best ginger cookies they had ever tasted and the big plus was they stayed soft!

OMG!! I made these today for my mom, she loves ginger cookies. All through my childhood and now 47 yrs old....ginger snaps/cookies tasted yuk, horrible to me. Well let me say I have been converted because of this recipe. I did just as the recipe said except adding the water. Thank you for this fabulous recipe. Also, I don't have a stand or electric hand mixer so I had to use good old fashion spoon/spatula + hand & arm muscle and this recipe still came out fantastic.

This is a delicious cookie! I made with gluten free all purpose flour and they turned out nice and soft. My measurements of spices were not level so you may want to add more.

The flavor was fantastic but the cookies came out really flat.  I had flattened them before baking like comments said, but spread even more and were a mass in the pan.  I needed to take them to a party so ended up making a trifle with them...  fantastic :) 

Next time will put them in without flattening.

Also had to refrigerate dough before rolling into balls.

These cookies are absolutely amazing! I followed the recipe exactly. The dough was slightly softer than I would have liked when I rolled out my balls, but it still worked just fine. These came out soft and moist! Thanks for a great recipe!

I'm not sure what I expected from this recipe, they are just what you would think, which is a little plain for my tastes.  A good cookie to have with tea. I wouldn't say it's something to rave about.

I did reduce ginger and used butter. I need to put full amount of ginger in next time.  Entire batch was gone in 24 hours by just us two.

This recipe is very similar to Boston Globes Cookbook on my shelf which calls for Shortening without Trans fat. I will try that recipe next.

These cookies are so good!  The only modifications made included using orange juice instead of water and butter rather than margarine (food allergy).  My dough wasn't sticky at all.  No issues rolling them out.  My husband, who doesn't really like ginger, grabbed a cookie out the door.  He came back 15 seconds later and took another!  Will definitely make again. :)

I used Ultra-Fine baker's sugar to lessen the impact of sugar flavor and keep the Ginger as the front-runner. This worked very well ! I made close to 3 doxen with this recipe.

This recipe is a family favourite. My Grandfather once told me that it tasted just like his mom's recipe. 

I usually cut up some dried ginger and place it in the cookie. That gives it a nice crisp ginger taste to it.

I had all the ingredients for this recipe. 
I was afraid to overcook so they fell apart some. Also I was in a hurry to taste them. 
Hubby liked it and if the cookies  stays soft  I will be thrilled.
The cookies are still nice and soft the day after baking.

Be careful if you double the recipe though... the amount of sugar needed doesn't update everywhere in the instructions.

These were tasty, but the dough does need to be refrigerated for an hour or frozen for at least 15 minutes before shaping into balls and placing them on a cookie sheet. If you don't, the dough is far too sticky to shape, as others have stayed.Also, make them no bigger then walnut size and press them down very flat. I followed the recipe exactly and my cookies ended up running together into one giant pizza of a cookie!

I thought they were soft and chewy.  However I was hoping for a more spice flavor. Maybe they needed more molasses or cloves.

love these cookies!! Made a batch for a family meeting and I had to make another 3 batches because of the number of requests I got to make them again ??
The dough is a bit sticky and hard to work with but I found that if you coat your hands with tiny bit of water it helps a lot!

A little too ginger-y for my taste but my co-workers loved them and none was left at the end of the day. It's a very good Holiday cookies and it stays soft and moist as long as you don't overbake them of course.

I always looked forward to the spice cookies being available in the grocery store every fall.  However, now that I'm older I can't handle those hard cookies.  I was thrilled to find this recipe.  I've made these cookies a few times and they are so yummy.  Even better the next day.  I never use margarine, so I substituted good old butter.  Family, friends and coworkers love it when I share them.   I'm so very glad I found this recipe.

I am a soft cookie fan and this is a great cookie. I didn't get a chance to find out if they stayed soft after two days, so I guess I will have to keep making them until I find out. My family loves them, too.

The children and I liked the cookies.  They were flat but soft and chewy; the way we like them.  One caution, if you are not a sugar lover, I would reduce the sugar to perhaps 3/4 cups.  We found them overly sweet, and that was without the added roll in sugar before baking.   Bottomline; good tasting as promised, but they do bake flat.  I would make some recipe adjustments the next time I do this recipe.

The only change I made was to use softened butter instead of margarine. The dough was easy to roll by hand without refrigeration. These turned out great and they make the house smell heavenly. I will make these again.

Wonderful gingery taste BUT not at all soft.  Still, the entire recipe was devoured at the family dinner. More of a gingerSNAP that a ginger bread cookie.

I have used this recipe for about 3 years and people just LOVE them. I'm usually the type of baker that just eats 1 or 2 cookies right when they come out of the oven but this cookie I still love 4 or 5 days later! I constantly asked for this recipe. Like someone else suggested I use orange juice instead of the water but otherwise I follow it as written. The dough gets very sticky at room temp so keep it in the fridge when not rolling into balls. But they are worth the sticky mess:)

I'm sorry, I know I should follow the recipe to the T, I completely understand, but I've never added water to a cookie recipe, and I got scared. I've also heard the brown sugar makes chocolate chip cookies the "soft inside, crunchy outside" type, and so those are the ONLY two changes I made.

Omitted the water, and did 3/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar.

Baked them for the mentioned 8-10 minutes. I didn't know how to know if they were done, so Googled, and it said that when the edges of the cookie are firm, they're done!

Pulled them out, and they look, taste, smell, PHENOMENAL! Everything is amazing. Loved them!

Thank you for this recipe, can't wait for my husband to come home and try them =)

Better than Grandma's!

Been using Grandma's molasses cookie recipe.  Mind you, Gram's cookies were the best.  UNTIL I used this one.   

I will say that I did one major "upgrade" to this recipe:  I substituted butter for the margin called for.  OMG! These cookies were like drugs and everyone with taste buds are junkies.  

Hint:  Refrigerate the cookie dough for an hour or even overnight, for much easier handling.

I made these for a holiday swap party at work and they were very popular. At least one person told me they were better than the Trader Joe's gingerbread sticks someone else had provided. The recipe makes a lot of cookies! I made a half batch about a week later for my own holiday celebration. The only change I made was to use Grand Marnier instead of water and that I put the dough in the freezer for an hour or so before I rolled the cookies. The dough gets very sticky when warm/room temperature. I will definitely make these again. I bet they would be excellent with some dark chocolate chips (I would have tried this myself but DH told me they were perfect as-is).

These are wonderful cookies! My family can't seem to get enough of them. I did make one change to the original recipe. I doubled the spices. I really like ginger which led to the times 2 adjustment.

The flavor of these cookies is good but I could not get them to look like the picture.  They do stay soft for a few days if stored in a sealed container.

These were quite good but I'm going to reduce the cloves by half because it was a little too strong for my taste but that is just personal preference . I didn't have any trouble with the recipe.  I didn't need to to flatten them, the cookies spread out just fine on their own, 
Thanks for a perfect cookie recipe. I'm going to make it again and again :)

This recipe is amazing! The only change I made to the recipe was using orange juice instead of water like one of the users previously suggested. I also suggest letting the batter sit in the fridge for about 15 minutes before forming the dough balls, as it makes it easier to handle. Other than that, the recipe gives you the most soft and chewy ginger cookies! Will definitely be making again!

These are good. Makes it easier to roll into balls if you put the dough in refrigerator for about 20 minutes.

We followed everything except baked at 355degC. We haven't baked ginger snaps before and it took us 3 recipes to get the perfect batch! This is the third recipe we tried. Thanks for sharing this recipe. We will make this again for sure!

These came out exactly how I wanted. Crispy on the outside chili on the inside, and they maintained that consistency for days after baking. The only adjustment that I made to the ingredients was adding about a quarter cup of diced candied ginger to amp up the ginger flavor a little. I also read previous comments about the cookies staying puffy, so I pressed each one down using the bottom of a glass. They were delicious!

I made this recipe twice. The first time I followed the recipe exactly and they came out great except I thought they needed a little more ginger kick. So the second time I doubled the ginger and clove. The second try was near perfection. My kids loved them too. Also in my oven they needed 11.5-12 mins. Light crunch on the outside and perfectly soft and chewy on the inside.

Delicious cookies. Substituted 1 Tbsp fresh orange juice for the water, as others suggested. Also used 3/4c sugar instead of 1c. Baked 8 minutes though I think 10 is fine.

These have an amazing flavor, but mine were so flat ... I even read the reviews.  I'm thinking that I softened the butter in the microwave. I didn't melt it, just softened, but they were a mess.  And they are so sticky ... I'm not sure .. I may stick with gingerbread cake.   I'll give them one more chance, however.  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

This recipe made amazingly soft ginger cookies.  I upped the flour to 2 1/2 cups after reading other reviews, and although the dough was still sticky, it was easy to work with.  The only other changes I made were to use butter instead of margarine and granulated brown sugar instead of white sugar in order to avoid processed ingredients.

My cookies did crack like in the photos, but I learned that it was a problem with the temperature of the dough before going in the oven and the leavening.  Our house does not have air-conditioning, so the kitchen was warm, making my dough warm thus flattening too soon in the oven.  Next time I make them during the summer months, I will refrigerate the dough before putting them in the oven, and I may try adding a little baking powder to increase the leavening so the top sets while the middle is still trying to rise.

Very tasty!  Definitely soft, even after a few days (in closed container).  I saw another review saying these cookies came out flat, but I had the opposite problem, where I left them as balls on the first tray and they didn't spread out very much so on the rest of the sheets I pressed them down with a fork and made criss-cross marks and they came out perfectly!  The cross marks made them prettier too.  Maybe the person who had flat cookies had their butter melt?  Mine was creamed at room temperature but not melted.  Hope this helps!  Enjoy!

I followed the recipe to the details, however I do like the taste of the season so I doubled all the seasonings.  I ended up rolling out the dough and cut out gingerbread mens, Santa's, x-mas trees etc. The cookies came out very soft, delicious!  definitely making it again.

OUTSTANDING recipe!  I'm not a huge fan of crunchy gingerbread (like a ginger snap) but these are a whole other ballgame.  Everybody loved them.  I made them exactly according to the recipe and they were perfect!  Definitely a "keeper" recipe.  My only tip- make sure to roll the ball of dough generously in sugar.

These cookies have been a hit at every party I've brought them to. Three things I do differently: (1) I use 1/3 cup molasses - it makes it easier for my ancient hand-mixer to deal with. (2) I always add a 1/2 teaspoon of ground cardamom. I love cardamom so hard. (3) When I'm making them for my mum, I replace the cloves with an equal amount of allspice. (Apparently, cloves were used as an anesthetic when she had dry socket as a child?)

(When I've run out of molasses, a half-and-half mixture of pancake syrup and honey worked in a pinch.)

This is a great cookie recipe! A definite keeper.
Looks are not the best, it comes out really flat, so make sure you refrigerate them for at least 30 minutes before baking.
The dough is also really sticky and hard to handle. But the taste is amazing. You can't stop eating after you take the first bite. The spices are really great and the cookies taste so... so good. Don't just read this, make it! Don't let the nasty reviews scare you off from this great ginger cookie.

Awesome cookie !!! This will definitely be on my Christmas cookie list every year. Instead of water , I substituted brandy and it came out phenominal. I also added 1 tsp of speculaas mix from the King Arthur flour website ( which is a mix of cinnamon, cloves , nutmeg , anise , ginger and cardamom ) Left dough in freezer for 20 min then shaped into 1 tbsp balls rolled them in sugar then flattened with a fork. Baked for 9 min then left on pan for 5 min.

I absolutely loved these cookies and so did everyone else. Mine did not turn out too flat but I had listened to other reviewers and used 1/2 cup more flour. I also refrigerated for 40 minutes. I also added orange extract in place of the water. I could not stop eating these.

This is the 2nd ginger cookie I've made from this site... and it's going to be the one and only recipe I use from now on.  I decided to try this recipe on Christmas Eve, and the only complaint with these cookies was that I only made one batch.  Not only were these the best cookies I've ever had fresh out of the oven, they were just as soft the next day.  After we finished the entire batch, it was unanimously decided that we should make them again... right away... only a double batch.  The only thing I changed was to take a reviewer's advice and use orange juice instead of the water, since I had it on hand - and I also increased the cinnamon to 1 teaspoon for no reason other than I love cinnamon.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Great tasting cookies!  Soft and chewy  as advertised, but my cookies didn't have the beautiful crinkles like the picture.
The dough is quite sticky to roll, so I chilled the dough, which made it much easier to work with.  Thanks for sharing.

I've made this recipe several times. I followed the recipe as is (except I used unsalted butter instead of margarine. I also rolled mine in sugar in the raw instead of regular sugar. It gives these soft cookies a nice texture/crunch while the cookie is still soft.

These were fabulous cookies. Everyone loved them. MY one mistake was flatting them too much. Next time I make them I will just flatten them slightly so they are thicker.

very soft yummy cookies. I added extra ginger and because i couldn't find my cloves I added one teaspoon of allspice. Delicious cookies-perfect with a cup of tea or coffee on a cold afternoon.

I made the recipe as written but took the advice of many and refrigerated the batter for an hour before baking. I understand why. Prior to refrigeration the batter was a sticky mess that couldn't be worked with. The cookies tasted yummy and were soft but mine turned out incredibly thin for some reason, and I left the dough as little balls even. Not at all like the photo in the recipe unfortunately.

Handed these out at work at Xmas time -- they were a big hit.  
Only substitution I made was to use maple syrup instead of molasses.  It was out of necessity ... I couldn't find any molasses in the store ... gotta work with what you've got -- and thinking like a true Canuck, I thought I'd innovate a little with our country's natural sweetener.
Worked like a charm.

I made these this past weekend, and I followed recipe directions. I read other reviews concerning the stickiness of the dough. I had no problem with it. Yes, the dough was sticky, but only a wee bit stuck to my fingers, and certainly wasn't so sticky that it was a problem. My family's peanut butter cookie recipe is stickier than this one. 

The only recommendation I have is regarding the instructions to flatten the balls of dough. I found that it is better to either flatten balls only slightly or flatten quite thin. (I used the bottom of my 1 cup stainless measuring cup. I also used granulated sugar on the bottom of measuring cup to minimize the chance that they would stick to it.

Easy recipe, and I'll definitely add this into my baking routine. (Bonus was how awesome they smelled when baking.)

Made two batches of these cookies today.  First batch I followed the recipe except I used 5TBSP dark brown sugar in place of the molasses since I couldn't find any .  I put the dough in the freezer for 30 minutes and didn't flatten the cookies. The first batch came out very good.  In the second batch I wanted more spice.  I used 2 1/2 teaspoons ginger, a whole teaspoon of ROASTED cinnamon powder, 3/4 tsp cloves, I also substituted orange juice for the water.  That batch is fantastic! Spicy, soft and delicious!

These turned out amazing! I did not change a thing. Even my mom likes them and she normally does not like gingerbread cookies. They were nice and soft. Great recipe! I would definitely make them again!  . . .maybe this week . . .

Very good! The cookies tasted wonderful, and were soft instead of crunchy. They came out a little flat, but it didn't change the flavor or chewiness.

These are my go-to Gingerbread cookies.  I love them soft and chewy and they stay soft for weeks ... assuming I make a huge batch.  ;)  Because of that they work great to put in the kid's school lunches.

I've made these many times! Love this recipe it's wonderful. Only changes I make are doubling the spices. We love our ginger cookies extra gingery and of course nutmeg is delicious as well. I make these at least a few times a year!!

Use orange juice instead of water, you'll thank me later! I also dusted mine with confectioners sugar instead of the white sugar crusting. Mostly for them to look snowed on for Christmas fun :)

I just want to say that all the recipes are wonderful! however if we can make changes on any of them for our own benefit, then by all means do so:-), I use coconut oil and it liquefies at 76 degrees which will help keep cookies moist, and it is a much healthier choice when cooking anything. I use coconut oil in a pure form on the baking isle. It also has many other uses.

So soft and delicious. I followed the cookie recipe exactly and decided to dip them in white chocolate and coat them in crushed peppermint just for a holiday flare. They were amazing! Definitely recommend!

I read the reviews and replaced margarine with butter, white sugar with brown sugar, and water with orange juice. I also added graded candies ginger. I put the mixed batch in the refrigerator, super easy to roll.

Yum! Went with the changes suggested - orange juice in place of water, flattened the cookie ball, chilled the dough for 2 hours in the fridge, and baked for 9 minutes at 350 degrees. Very tasty! This cookie will be made often!

I have never really liked ginger cookies but wanted to make something different.  Am I glad I tried this recipe!  These cookies are fabulous!  My gourmet cook son-in-law loves these. He shared them with his duck hunting buddies.  I did add an extra 1/2 tsp. Ginger and used orange juice instead of water. Makes a nice difference.  I might try some diced candied ginger next time I make them.

Every one has loved these each time I have made them.  Teachers at school, teachers at church, and my family.  They can't get over how soft they are.
Chilling them helps quite a bit - I have tried both ways.  Also, using a cookie scoop is the way to go!
Thanks for a keeper.

If you want a thicker cookie with a crinkled top use margarine.  I used butter the first time.  The cookies were delicious, but were flat and smooth.  The second time  I used margarine and they were nice, thick and had crackled tops.  I refrigerated the dough for an hour, used a medium cookie scoop, rolled them in sugar and then slightly flattened them.   I baked them on Convection for 10 minutes.  Perfection!

These were great. Perfectly moist, chewy but a little firm on the outside. Very easy. I used rounded spoons for the spices (as I really like them) but otherwise just followed the recipe. I've gone through many different molasses cookie recipes and this is the one I will keep .

Being diabetic. I used an equal amount of "Stevia" for the sugar & sugar in the raw for the molasses .
The balls of dough were covered with a "scant" of the turbinado crystals. when they were flattened, a fork was pressed in the fashion of an "X" which gave them a ribbed top.
Great recipe, to make them crunchy, baked them about five minutes longer. Will bake again!

LOVED THESE COOKIES. I never change a recipe when I make it the 1st time. I flattened lightly like you would a peanut butter cookie, with a fork in both directions. I love the chewy center. Will be my ONLY ginger cookie recipe going forward. Thank you.

This is the best ginger cookie I've ever made.  I absolutely love the texture, which is soft and chewy on the inside and crispy on the outside.  I love the blend of spices.  The only change I made was I did not use cloves, but substituted an equal amount of fresh ground nutmeg .  I rolled some of the dough into balls and flattened, but I also rolled some out and cut with cookie cutter to make gingerbread men and other cutouts.

Awesome cookies.  My husband loved these cookies.  First batch, I subbed the water for orange juice.  Wow!   Second batch I used Grand Marnier instead of juice.  Fantastic!  This cookie is on my Christmas list.  Great flavor and so easy to make.  Use a one tablespoon scoop, but be sure to refrigerate your dough for at least an hour.  Makes it so easy to make the cookies.

I love love LOVE this recipe! When I think of a soft chewy ginger cookie, this embodies it perfectly!
I made it for a pot luck and everyone loved it (even those who were stuffed to the gills were still able to enjoy them). A lot of people were raving about them and some even asked me for the recipe!

The only thing I did differently from the recipe was use spreadable butter instead of margarine, and I didn't cream the margarine/butter with the sugar (wasn't paying attention and had put the sugar with the other dry ingredients already). So I just mixed everything together, skipped the extra sugar, and voila! Yummy awesomeness!

One of my staple Christmas cookies. Perfect! Nicely spiced and wonderful. Only piece of advice is be VERY gentle when you flatten them. I use the bottom of a glass, and don't press them flat. Just enough to get it from ball to disk. The more you flatten them to start, the flatter and crispier they will be. I like them soft.

I used this recipe, but substituted orange juice for the water. I rolled them out to use cookie cutters, but had to add a considerable amount of flour while rolling since they were so sticky. But in the end, it worked! Can't wait to give these out for our cookie exchange!

I had this recipe a while ago and misplaced it.  So glad you had it because it is just as good as I remember.  My kids loved them and now my husband who is the biggest kid of all thinks they are all for him now that the kids are gone.

Love these. I did make a couple small changes. I had a bit of brown sugar left from something else that I subbed in for part of the white sugar. I had 1 large and 2 smaller eggs (I doubled the recipe on faith) so for a double recipe I used the 3 eggs. I also left out the water based on previous comments. I don't think any of these changes alter the overall recipe significantly.
They came out perfectly--crispy on the outside, moist and chewy on the inside.  Two days later most of the double batch is gone and I'm going to have to make more.
I do recommend using a scoop to avoid the sticky dough/ball problem.

These cookies are awesome. Big hit with my family and they went over well at my wife's Christmas party.  My wife suggested a couple changes which worked really well. Cider vinegar for the water and butter for the margerine. I will be making these again.

Used others suggestions by substituting margarine with butter; sugar with 1/2 cup brown, 1/2 cup white and water for orange juice.  Turned out perfect, did not need to refrigerate to roll into balls.  Used a small scooper and made about 3 doz cookies per batch.  Used parchment paper over cookie to press with cocktail glass.  Let sit on pan until just before next batch came out of oven, no breakage, perfect cookies.

I followed the recipe to the tee... except.. I used salted butter, and like suggested, orange juice instead of water.  I didn't find the dough to be sticky at all... amazing!  I will definitely make these again. Thank you for sharing your recipe.  Edited....... Well, my husband couldn't leave these alone.. I am making my 2nd batch tomorrow morning.... Honestly, these are the best ginger cookies I've ever had.. moist and chewy and the flavors blend so nicely...

This year will be my third year making these.  They are perfectly amazing each and every time.  The only changes I made were I didn't flatten a bit before baking and I bake for 1 more minute. This way they are fluffy and chewy!  They stay soft and have a beautiful flavor, they are not overpowering and weak. JUST RIGHT!!!!

My husband doesn't like chocolate so I thought I'd make him something just for him. Unfortunately, these were so good that everyone in the family wanted them instead of the chocolate cookies! I made them exactly as the recipe said. The first time I forgot to press down before baking and they weren't as good. Don't overcook them... they get dried out.

Not gingery/spicy enough for my liking but delicious nonetheless. I think I'll add more spice and swap for dark brown sugar next time to get a darker cookie.

I made these cookies this morning and made this recipe without any changes.  I put the batter in the fridge for 20 minutes and they rolled into a ball very easily.  I flattened them slightly with the bottom of a glass.  I would make this recipe again.

Best ginger cookies I've ever had. Very pleasing ratio of ginger to other spices/sugar. Most other cookies I've tried are too heavy handed with the ginger. I make these several times a year.

Used butter instead of margarine.  Very good cookies.  I needed to add a bit more water (probably due to the altitude).  Will make again!

These are very good. Nice ginger flavor in a soft cookie. They don't last long. I've made them the last two Christmases. Have a glass of tea and take a break from shopping!

Excellent easy ginger cookie! I am not one to make cookies from scratch often but my husband was craving ginger cookies so I tried these and they were perfect. I sprinkled a small amount of sugar on top before baking and they turned out so tasty.

I made these and they were very good! Made them for thankgiving. It's not really sweet, it's just that homemade gingerbread taste. I added two drops of vanilla extract and then topped the cookies with powdered sugar. When making them into balls I had a small bowl Of sugar and pressed both sides into them which flattened it perfectly.

I need at least 3 or 4 more stars for this.  These aren't exactly what I was looking for, but are so very good!!  I doubled the recipe knowing they wouldn't last a day in my house, and used butter, not margarine.  I added some extra molasses in place of water, and was able to being baking immediately, as they formed a perfect soft dough.  thank you so much for this taste of home from 30 years ago.

I have made these sooo many times, always delicious!  One trick I do, is to add a little all spice and a little cloves to the dough, in addition, I also add about 3/4 tsp of freshly pulverized black peppercorns.  Before baking, I roll in sugar to which I have also added more crushed black peppercorns.  This gives a little bite to the cookies.

I LOVE these cookies, the taste is perfect and my family loves them! My only complaint is that the dough was a little hard to handle and my cookies came out flatter than I would have liked. Overall, I am very pleased with this recipe!

Really good cookies and easy to make. The are NOT big. They are only about the size of a half dollar. So if you are prepared for that, you will be happy with the recipe.

I'm currently waiting on the dough in the fridge to firm up a bit, but something's been haunting me ever since I tasted the dough. Will 2 teaspoons of ground ginger be enough? The ginger flavor in the dough is minimal so I'm worried they'll just taste like cinnamon.
Can anyone assure me otherwise?

These are simple and delicious. I followed the recipe for the most part but I took others advice and chilled the dough in the refrigerator for an hour before I rolled them into balls. The directions are slightly flawed for getting the actual shape and size of the cookies down right. I rolled them into a walnut sized ball like the directions stated, rolled the ball in some sugar, then I took a Pyrex measuring cup and flattened the cookies to make them big. Please make sure to do this only after you've rolled the dough balls in sugar...this will help with sticking to the bottom of the glass....press down lightly it did stay stuck to the bottom every now & then so do this carefully. All in all these are yummy and it's the name of them holds true "big soft ginger cookies" this is a new holiday favorite of mine. Please try!! So very easy and delicious.

I couldn't find molasses, so I substituted brown sugar for the white sugar.  Instead of the sugar on top, I mixed up icing with lemon juice and powdered sugar (I just estimated) and mixed in some grated lemon peel into the dough.

Very tasty. I put the dough in the freezer for about an hour and it was a lot easier to handle. I see where others used orange juice instead of water. I have some orange liqueur and want to see how that works the next time I try this.

Disclaimer - I typically don't bake-my wife does.  But she's a strict - stick to the ingredients - baker.  I, however, wanted to try to make something with a normal recipe but use substitutes to make it healthier and work around our lactose intolerance.

Replaced the butter with our non-dairy butter, replaced the sugar with honey (read somewhere to use 1/2-3/4 cup for every 1 cup of sugar and cook 25 degrees cooler), gluten free flour, and orange juice instead of water.  

2 things I could've done better - read more reviews.  I think I would've had much better results if I would've let it sit for a little while before putting it on the cookie sheet.  It was really gooey.  Also, I thought I was using a tsp when I was really using a 1/2 tsp, so I had to go back and add more of everything.  I than realized I forgot 1 tsp of ground ginger after the first batch was in the oven, so I added 1/2 tsp to what was still in the bowl-they seemed to stick together better.  

I was also hoping for a little more of a solid cookie on the exterior.  But I might be thinking of another cookie.  Maybe it was molasses cookies...  But my wife seems to like them, so that's good.

A mild tasting cookie. I made them smaller, but needed to cook them longer than the 8-10 min stated. Cookies were still quite raw after 10 min.   Froze some after rolling rather than cooking them all at once. Good, but I'll stick with the ginger snap recipe from Company's Coming.

They did not get firm enough with the amount of flour it called for and I  had to add more flour to make them firm enough to roll into a ball.  Not the best ginger cookies I have tried,  But it could also be that I am at a higher altitude.

These were a big hit! Soft and tasty as promised. Yum!  I changed a couple of things after reading other reviews; used brown sugar instead of white and cut it to about half. I used oj instead of water as suggested and increased the cinnamon and cloves a bit. I also used blackstrap molasses which have a stronger flavour. There was no problem with stickiness and I rolled them easily right after mixing.  Will definitely be making these often. Thanks for a great recipe!

Good enough, but not like Peets ginger cookies - my goal for best cookies ever.  Needs more ginger, suggest 1 Tablespoon, increase cinnamon to 1 tsp and use 1 Tb hot water not cold.  Change white to brown sugar (1 cup).  Cook at least 9 minutes and be sure you use lowest shelf in oven or oven heats evenly with more than one tray.  If you add 1/2 cup chunky chopped crystalized ginger pieces, you've got a winner!

Awsome cookies. We added natural ginger, which gives an stronger flavour. And experiment adding chocolate chips or coconut or almonds or all at once.
Very good cookies. Best I have ever cooked.

Excellent!  Nice soft cookie.(I did not roll the dough balls in sugar or use the extra sugar.  Also used butter instead of margarine.) Nice blend of flavors.  Will use some of these to make ice cream sandwiches.  I used my large cookie scoop and got about 27 cookies.  Great recipe!

I've made this recipe twice now and they're great. The balance of spice and molasses is perfect and they were still chewy the next day. I made just a few changes: I used butter in place of margarine, added some cayenne pepper to heat them up a bit, and the second time I made them I refrigerated the dough for an hour.  Mine took closer to 15 mins in the oven, but I made them pretty big and I like chewy cookies.

No changes. My husband doesn't care for ginger snaps but theses he liked. Used my # 40 scoop, flattened them a bit. Nice big cookies. Will definitely make them again and taking the rest to my daughters for thanksgiving.

Pretty much followed the recipe exactly and they were awesome! Only thing I changed was I substituted pumpkin pie spice (mix of cinnamon and nutmeg) for the cloves, only because I'm not a big fan of cloves. I read some of the reviews and someone had said to let the dough rest before rolling into balls because the dough was too sticky. I never let the dough rest and found them easy to roll, not too sticky.

These cookies are absolutely amazing! I probably won't roll them in sugar next time because I don't think they really need it. Other than that I wouldn't change a single thing about the recipe. They're very easy and I will be making these again and again.

Very yummy cookies. I baked for about 9 minutes and they came out lovely and soft. Like others I did have to refrigerate the dough in order for it to be workable and not too sticky, but that was the only change I made. Will make again!

When I made it for my family, they all loved the cookies.  But they were a little bit too sticky and hard to control.  They also came out of the oven very soft.  I like that in a cookie, I thought it was a success!

Delicious!! I did make a couple changes. Instead of margarine, I used butter and I used I/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup dark brown sugar. Also added a pinch of nutmeg for added flavor. I like my cookies very chewy and found that 9 minutes, cooking on parchment paper was perfect! They were the hit of the party. Not one came home with me.

I made these exactly as written and they are absolutely fabulous! A word of advice: make sure your ground ginger is fresh (not stale). I made them once with ground ginger that had been in my cupboard for too long and, although the cookies still had very good flavour, they didn't have that wonderful bite to them that you get with good/fresh ground ginger.

These are amazing. The only thing I changed was the addition of a small amount of cream of tartar just to make them come out pretty. One of my favorite cookie recipes for sure.

These are a standard on my Christmas cookie list and everyone always loves them. I even like them myself, and I'm not the biggest fan of ginger cookies. Definite keeper.

These ended up really soft and delicious. But the problem was that there was not enough ginger flavor and too much sweetness. I would make these again, but I would cut back on most of the white sugar and add a lot more ginger and spices. I'm giving it four stars because it's not a perfect recipe, but can easily be adjusted to my tastes.

The dough looked like wet sand so I added more grease because I thought I won't be able to shape it... I needn't add this grease since I understood later that particles bind together when rolled.
It's soft and chewy but not too soft which makes it good...

These were some of the best cookies I have ever made! They were so soft, chewy, and not to mention INCREDIBLY easy to make. The cookies store really well, but they didn't last long either of the times that I made them. These are great for anyone looking for a simple recipe that is sure to impress.

I followed the recipe for the most part. I used an equal amount of dark corn syrup instead of molasses and I rolled the dough in a sugar-cinnamon mix instead. The syrup was only because the closest place that sells molasses is a good bit away. I'm not sure if it impacted the flavor at all. The cinnamon in the sugar really enhanced the flavor, but it would be better to just sprinkle it on top instead of rolling. 

The cookies came out as flat as a cookie can be, as some other reviews have said. If I make them again, I would definitely try brown sugar instead of syrup. Overall, the cookies tasted great. They were very sweet and had an excellent gingery taste that did not overpower while still having the hints of cloves and such. 

I made half of them at the lower baking time range and at the higher. The lower time range has stayed soft and chewy even now, three days later. The higher time range had crispy edges with a soft center. 

The only problem is that they look nothing like the picture at the top of the page. My cookies look like flat discs and are beige like a peanut butter cookie. They have no cleavage except for the one I dropped when taking it off the pan.

These are my all time favorite cookie. They are always a huge hit and I can't rave enough about them. I don't have to refrigerate the dough and I roll out heaping tablespoon balls and lightly flatten. My only adjustment is that I use butter bc of pretentious snobby reasons you don't want to hear ;). I recommend for Christmas cookies. They are perfect bc they are the perfect balance without being too overpowering.

I will definitely make these cookies again.  My very first attempt at baking ginger cookies.. Only change I made, I used fresh grated ginger and just a pinch of black pepper (chef John's) suggestion in his ginger cookie recipe..

This was the best ginger cookie I've ever had! It had so many different textures and flavors packed into one cookie. The recipe made 24 cookies, but I made 12 huge cookies. I used honey instead of molasses  and used orange juice instead of water and the cookies turned out great. I also used fresh ginger because I didn't have any ground ginger or any time to make it. They would have turned out better with actual ground ginger because I kept on getting blasts of ginger here and there. Other than that, these cookies are amazing. I will definitely make these cookies again. (I've been eating them while writing this and now there are crumbs all over my keyboard)

I made these cookies for my family. We ate them all in two days. They are the most moist delicious cookies ever. When my son went off to college I would send these down in a care package, he had more friends then he could handle. Next year my youngest will be off to college and these have all ready been requested in the box.

Truly I think these might be the best cookies I have ever made.  I followed the cooking time to a Tee and the texture is perfect.  I made only slight changes: I used  only 1/4 t clove and instead of margarine I used 1/2 c butter flavored crisco and 1/4 c butter.  I added 1/4 c chopped sugared ginger ( my friend buys it for me from the Asian market).  Wow best cookie ever! I see this as a staple for parties, Christmas, bake sales.  Thanks

These cookies are chewie and soft and just great.  I will try increasing the spices to try to replicate a cookie I have had before.  These were quite satisfying. 
Any idea what the nutrition information might be?

So delicious, will definitely make again. I only sprinkled sugar on them as I could not roll them into balls. I think I put a bit too much molasses which made them difficult to roll as they were not the right texture but the result was great. I flattened my tablespoonfuls and it turned out great!

Delicious!!! Everyone LOVES these, even my mother who claims to *hate* Ginger Cookies.
I made 16 servings instead of 24 and made 3 small adjustments,
I added 1 tsp Cream of Tartar. Put the dough in the freezer for about 30 minutes, and only baked 1 batch at a time for 10-11 minutes, with 6 cookies since that's the amount that fit on one metal tray on the middle rack of my oven.

These are ahhh-maze-ing! I was a little worried because the dough smelled very overpowering and didn't taste very good, but the cookies are awesome. My family of three devoured a dozen hot out of the oven in minutes. I'm not a fan of ginger snaps, but these are soft and delicious. Going in next year's Christmas tins for sure.

They look a little different but not much - I changed one thing - I try to cut out white sugar as much as possible so I cut it in half and put half brown sugar.  I also love chia seeds and try to put then in everything - so added a few dashes of them (1-2 tablespoons).  I can see them but hardly and no one ever seems to notice.  Note instead of rolling just use two teaspoons to dish them out on the tray and flatten a bit with a fork and put a dash of sugar on top of them before putting in the oven. Perfect !

I just tweaked the recipe a bit. Didn't have molasses so added equivalent volume of maple syrup. 
For a microwave convection oven... Baked at 180 deg C for 12-13 minutes.

The cookies turn out golden and chewy and I have never had them any better

Excellent cookies! I've now made them a few times, once following the recipe exactly, and once being liberal with my spice measurements, and doing 1/2 tsp of fresh grated ginger, rolling them in cinnamon sugar.

I make these for a chocolate and wine pairing I do and have adapted the recipe a little to fit with the wine I serve with it.   With the eggs,  I add 1 T fresh grated ginger .   And with the dry ingredients, I add 1 T chopped crystallized ginger.    I roll them in cinnamon/sugar mixture before baking...similar to a snicker doodle.  They are great at this point.  But for the wine and chocolate pairing,  I dip half  in white chocolate...perfect pairing.  Everyone loves them.

These are so good! Crunchy exterior and yet soft inside. I made them exactly from the recipe and they turned out perfect.  After slightly rolling the balls (with a rolling pin) dusted in white sugar I then used cookie cutters and lightly sprinkled them with colored sprinkles. I have tried other recipes and they were not good ones for cut outs!

I absolutely LOVE these cookies. Just don't overbake like I did. They turned kind of hard after they were fully cooled. They may seem like they're still raw after 10 minutes in the oven, but when they cool, they'll be soft and perfect!

My favourite cookies. I usually double all the spices because I like things spicy, and sometimes replace the water with rum or another liquor that I have on hand.

These were great! Only thing different I did was use butter instead of margarine. I refrigerated the dough for about an hour before baking and had to keep the dough in the refrigerator between batches or else it got all sticky and messy. They did flatten almost as soon as I took them out of the oven, but they were still really good.

I have used this recipe twice now within the last month. The first time was the week of Christmas. I followed the recipe word for word. Except my dough balls were a little larger than a teaspoon and I didn't flatten them much at all. They turned out delicious! 

I gave some to all of our neighbors (they ranted and raved at how soft and delicious they were). I took most of them to my aunt-in-law's house to add to the dessert table Christmas Day. My husband and I had to leave right after dinner to drive over the pass to spend Christmas with my mother (where we took the cookies to as well). My mother and her husband loved them! Moreover, come Monday evening when my husband came home, he couldn't wait to tell me that the cookies were a HUGE hit at his aunt's house. I had made too many, so she brought them to work (they work together). The cookies were devoured within the first few hours of the day! 

I know, this is long. But, I have to share the success I had with this recipe. Anywho, I made these cookies again last week, this time only 48 cookies. I decided to alter the recipe by being generous with the measurements for ginger, cinnamon, and cloves. I also added 5 extra tablespoons of molasses. OH MY GOSH! HOLY CANOLLI! They were to die for! My husband took them to work again, this time he came home to tell me that his aunt claimed that they tasted almost like Nana's. That is the biggest compliment I could ever receive or give. Thank you very much for sharing this recipe!

Turned out nice and soft. Based on other reviews I used oj instead of water, 1/2 C white 1/2C brown sugar. I didn't refrigerate it or roll it sugar, I rolled by hand and just pressed it down using the bottom of a cup. I never try to make them look pretty on my first try...I go for the taste...once I've got that down then I'll try for pretty. Taste is good...hubby says could use more molasses...I wouldn't know...I'm a beginner baker (and cook) so I'll try more molasses next time.

These cookies are really delicious, with a wonderful texture, an almost crisp, crackly outside and soft, chewy center.  The dough is very sticky, so I highly recommend refrigerating the dough before using it. I baked some right away and put the rest of the dough in the fridge and the cold dough was much easier to work with and I feel like the spice flavors came out more from having time to incorporate into the dough. 

Every one who tried them loved them, even the people who say they don't like sweets or ginger. I think this is partly because the ginger flavor is not very strong in this cookie. I made it exactly as written and it tasted more like a very flavorful and rich snicker doodle. This is a 5 star cookie on its own merit. However, I did deduct one star for the fact that it's called a ginger cookie but doesn't really taste very ginger-y as I was hoping. This will definitely be in my holiday cookie rotation, but my search for the perfect ginger cookie goes on.

BEST ginger cookies ever! 

A few changes: 
butter instead of margarine.  I did not flatten the cookies because I found they came out nicer when they weren't flattened.  I baked with aluminum foil lined cookie sheets
and set out 8 balls of dough per sheet (only have 2 cookie sheets) and this had them not 'run into' each other and made for nicer looking cookies. The yield for each batch was greater that 24 cookies, even though I shaped them into walnut sized balls. If cloves are too strong for your taste, try substituting with nutmeg. Side note:  I misread the molasses to be 1 1/4 cup on one batch, however, we couldn't really tell the difference and it didn't affect the overall flavour and softness that much.

These cookies are amazing! I had to adjust the baking time according to my oven but they turned out SO GOOD.  They are flavorful and soft...they also freeze well and once then un-thaw they are STILL soft!!

I followed the advice from another review and replaced the mollases with brown sugar (although I did sneak a teaspoon or two of molasses in there also.) This made the dough come out perfect consistency, not sticky at all. However, this does make it come out very mild and Iight in color. More similar to a spicy snickerdoodle than ginger cookies. I like my cookies mild though, so I didn't mind. They came out gorgeous. The cookies were soft, slightly chewy, thick, and delicious.

When I made these, I used brown sugar as a coating instead of white sugar and the cookies turned out tastier. Also, if your dough turns out too sticky, next time just don't add the water! Other than that, these were AMAZING and I would definitely make them again!!

These cookies are a HUGE hit. They are not flashy, but the taste and softness will top many Christmas cookies you eat. Made these (doubled batch made about 90 cookies) for Christmas this year.  Brought them everywhere with us and family/friends could not get enough. 

I agree with others that the dough is very sticky, but let it sit for awhile and that will help. Like someone else that reviewed, I also used orange juice in place of water.  Also it might just be my oven, but I definitely bake these on the shorter side if you want them to be soft and chewy! Enjoy!!

These are so yummy! I used Grand Marnier in place of the water, because I love to bake with alcohol.  I didn't have any ground gloves, so I just used allspice, and I added a pinch of nutmeg in as well.

I put the dough in the fridge for an hour, and then I used a small cookie scoop to get uniform sizes. After rolling them in sugar, I used the bottom of a glass to flatten them, first dipping the glass into the sugar. 

I think next time I might try using some fresh ginger. Really worried that I'll eat all of these before my friends get any!

Followed the recipe with no changes, and they turned out soft and chewy, with a nice subtle flavour. Next time, I will add a bit more ginger and cinnamon to up the flavour. Will definitely make again!

I've been making these for years, and everyone loves them. Unfortunately, they're now coming out completely flat. We moved recently: could it be the higher altitude? 

Any suggestions/tips on how I could fix them?

Husband said that these were the best cookies I've made in recent memory.  I used limoncello liquor instead of water.  Also cooked the cookies for 9 min...probably could do it for 10.  Hard to tell when they are done, b/c they are so dark.  Didn't have issues with the stickiness of the dough, b/c followed another reviewer's suggestion and dropped in the sugar before forming balls.

These came out perfect! Nice slight crunch around the edges and chewy in the middle. I followed the recipe as written. I will definitely make these more often. The dough was a bit sticky to work with, so I dampened my hands before rolling the balls out. That made it a lot easier. Thank you for sharing.

I've made these cookies twice now ( at least 6 batches ) and I absolutely love them. I'm 14 and love to bake. So when I find a recipe that I can execute, its a good one. They don't take long to make, so if you someone like my dad who doesn't have any patience, this is for you! The first time I made them I put 24 in a container to hide for my hungry dad. By the time my mom got home he had found them and there were only 3 left!! I'm making them for my family Christmas party and so far they are a hit at home!!

I'm not a big ban of gingerbread, but this recipe is so tasty!
The alterations I made were substituting  maple syrup for molasses, and I used Trader Joe's Pumpkin Pie Spice blend (2 tsp total) in lieu of the spices (and amounts) listed in the recipe. Fabulous!

I made these a few weeks ago and they turned out perfectly. I followed all of the original instructions and the dough was perfect. I scooped up a spoonful of dough, rolled it in my hands, then pressed them on the pan it to resemble a hockey puck? So it was still a little thick and round, but flattened. They opened up just like the picture and were delicious! Five stars!

Excellent cookie with nice sugar crunch on the outside and moist gingery goodness on the inside.
Everybody loved them and we will definitely make these again.  This is the first of 10 different kinds of cookies we are making but it may end up being number 2 and 3 as well!

I made mine a little smaller. Absolutely delicious. The flavor is light. Sometimes molasses can overpower ginger, but this cookie has a good balance. Texture is soft. Overall very good cookie. I stored mine in a plastic Tupperware. I always add a small slice of bread in with my cookies to keep them soft . These kept well for a few days w/o the bread to absorb the air in the container.

These cookies are one of my favorite recipes to make during the holiday season, and are pretty much perfect as written. I like to increase the amount of spices used in the batter, because I prefer strong flavors. I personally didn't notice much of a difference between using orange juice or water, so don't worry if you can't make the substitution suggested by another reviewer. I've never had trouble manipulating the dough, and I like to use a measuring cup to roll the dough balls around and coat them in sugar. These cookies stay soft and delicious for quite a long time, and are also flat and sturdy, which makes them excellent cookies to send through the mail.  I love to microwave them for a few seconds before eating them; they taste like they've just come out of the oven again!

They tasted great! I used orange juice in place of water and used a two ounce scoop,  rolled them in sugar and baked for four minutes,  then rotated the cookie sheet and baked another four minutes.  They are soft and the ginger flavor isn't overwhelming.  They are perfect.   My last batch I left in one minute too long and they turned to ginger snaps,  still delicious but definitely a crisper cookie.

These are my FAV cookies, even out of the season. I stumbled across this recipe 4 years ago & have been using it since. They are always chewy, plump, & favorable. Always get such great compliments too at get-togethers i take them to :)
I only changed one thing, whole wheat flour vs. white. Da bomb

These are outstanding cookies in every way.  I do have one other ingredient I put in the batter though that helps the ginger give it a wee kick up one notch . . . 1/8 tsp of cayenne pepper.  It is delicious with this.  You have gotta try it .  Don't worry you won't taste the pepper - it just helps to enhance the ginger.

Very easy to make as described. I put a little margarine on my hands to gently roll the cookies. They were larger than expected. Tasty too! I may try adding some crystallized ginger next time to add texture and enhance the already gingery flavour. Yum!

Absolutely love these cookies! They have a great classic ginger/molasses flavor that is not overwhelming, and they go great with a warm drink. I make the recipe as written, but have substituted pumpkin spice mix plus a little extra cinnamon if I don't have cloves.   These will stand out at a cookie exchange.

First attempt at a gingerbread cookie. I was skeptical but wanted to make gingerbread men w the kids. Dough is a little sticky so I  added some flour to my rolling surface and refrigerated the dough for an hour. Perfection. Delicious. Soft and chewy!! A keeper.

LOVE THIS SIMPLE RECIPE. Second time making these cookies, and I think it may be my new fav go-to.  So light, SOFT and fluffy... This recipe pleased hubby and the ladies at work, a tough crowd to please.  Only had minced ginger on hand fresh ginger so added 3+ tbsp fresh ginger to the wet mixture, and threw in 1/2 tsp of nutmeg to improvise. Perfect w coffee or to give out around the holidays.

These taste awesome! First time making them. Made a few changes.. Used White Whole wheat flour instead of all purpose, butter instead of margarine, brown sugar instead of white.. did not have molasses or cloves. Also adjusted recipe to half of everything except for the egg and water amount. Came out big and soft..great color and taste. Hubby and little one loved them!

A great recipe! I refrigerated my dough overnight and used an ice-cream scoop to scoop out the cookies. I recommend leaving as balls on the tray - don't flatten them at all or they get way too thin.

I was looking for a soft ginger cookie and this definitely delivered! This recipe doubled very well. I made a double batch and must have made smaller cookies than recommended because I ended up with 6 dozen! No complaints here.

Really good ginger cookies. They deliver exactly as promised. Soft, chewy and spicy! Per other reviewers I used orange juice instead of water, and also used butter instead of margarine (because I don't care for margarine). I had no issues with them spreading out while cooking. They were neither too thick or too thin. Definitely a keeper and will be making them again!

Wonderful! I made a gluten-free version using Pamela's gf baking mix, but I've made these with Domata gf flour, too. I also use shortening and/or coconut oil for the margarine with success, though consistency changes. I use coconut sugar and only sprinkle sugar on the top after flattening each cookie ball a little before baking. So good and rich with blackstrap molasses and a little extra ginger!

This is truly a soft, gingery cookie! The only change I made was to flatten the cookie dough more than suggested to achieve a flatter cookie, but that's it! In the future, I may add a touch more of cinnamon but the cloves and ginger were just the right amount! If you want to ice the cookies, just mix a half cup of powdered sugar with 1 Tablespoon milk and a 1/4 tsp of vanilla extract. I also added some cinnamon to the icing for extra spice! Very delicious, soft, and gingery cookie!

YUM! I made these with only a few tweaks--I used butter instead of margarine,  1/2 cup of brown sugar instead of white sugar, and orange juice instead of water. I also refrigerated the dough for about an hour to let it firm up. The cookies turned out beautifully; I'll definitely be making these again!

Love these and even my husband enjoys them and he's not a fan of ginger!  Yes the dough is sticky but I just tossed them in the white sugar to coat. These will be a regular in my home.

These were pretty good; however, they lacked a little in flavor.  Next time, I'll increase the molasses to 1/2 cup and use the dark/full flavor molasses and increase the flour by 1/4 (to compensate for the added moisture).  I'll also add 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla.  My first batch, I flattened a lot per other reviews and my second batch I only flattened slightly...this made the cookies raw in the middle.  My third batch, I flattened slightly but baked 12 minutes and they seem to be the best (otherwise they are so soft they fall apart).  Even if you flatten them a lot, they still are very soft.  I also chilled the dough (outside in MN) for some time before forming the balls.  This made the dough very easy to work with.  I also used butter instead of margarine.

Really good cookie.  Only change I made was to add in a teaspoon of vanilla like I had read in one review.  Made the house smell really nice.  Didn't really taste a lot of the ginger though.  For the amount of sugar that goes in it, it wasn't too sweet which I liked.

I love this recipe. I bake these all the time but today I rolled out the dough. they need to be spaced 3 inches apart and baked for 7 mins depending on how thick your cut outs are and they are still soft.

Nice spice taste that sort of reminds you of the holidays. Delicious and very easy to make. I followed many of the reviewers' recommendations of replacing the water with orange juice. I also refrigerated the dough for about 30 min, and I feel that made it easier to work with. Rolled the ~3/4" balls in sugar and pressed down a bit with the bottom of a glass. They do spread so don't place too close together. Very soft and seem like they will stay that way if stored properly. A definite keeper! UPDATE 1/27/16: Second time making these, and they came out even better. Refrigerated dough for 1 hr 15 min (would chill even longer) which helped to achieve the desired cracks in the cookies. I made them smaller and did not press down top; this worked fine, they nicely spread out. I used 1/2 cup ICBINB and 1/4 c Crisco. I replaced the water with spiced rum. Baked exactly 8 min. Soft, chewy, delicious.

Decent recipe - I chilled the mixture for 30 mins before making as it was a bit too soft - but otherwise turned out good. A bit bland, but very eatable

2nd time I 'kicked it up a notch' I upped the ingredients to the following:

2.5 tsp ginger
1 tsp cinnamon
1/3cup molasses

and then I add 1 tsp vanilla to the 2 Tbsp of water. I then dusted them with confectioners sugar.

WHAT A DIFFERENCE!!

The cookies now have 'pop' and 'zing' the flavor is now awesome instead of just okay.

The taste was excellent, I actually ended with more cookies than the serving suggested which is always a plus! They were nice and chewy.  I tweaked the recipe a little bit though I added some more flour to the dough because it was very sticky when rolling into a ball shape and I also added to minutes to the baking time.  12 minutes was perfect for my cookies.  But BRAVO!

My 11 y/o daughter made these because she was craving something that 'tasted like Autumn' lol I didn't have any eggs left, so she used flax seed as a substitute and baked the cookies on parchment paper instead of just the baking sheet. They were delicious!

I gave 5 Stars because these were great, but holy sugar batman!  Not only is there a lot of sugar in the cookie, it is rolled in sugar.  I will decrease the sugar by 1/2 cup next trime.  I used 2 tbsp. of OJ instead of water.  Used my pampered chef cookie scoop and flattened them down a bit with the bottom of a glass.  Very easy to make.  Convection for 9 minutes.  Used butter instead of margarine.   Turned out great.

These cookies are great! I used butter, brown sugar in the cookies, and raw sugar to roll them in. I also added chopped crystalized ginger to the batter - they're perfect. We will make these again, and again.

I give this four stars based on these changes I made based on some of the reviews and the fact that I found this recipe in my Better Homes and Gardens recipe book from 1986. It has these changes: 2tsp. baking soda, 1tsp. ginger, 1tsp. cinnamon, NO salt, 3/4 brown sugar and don't add water. I sugared and flattened some cookies for a thin, soft cookie with crunchy edges and the ones I left as a sugared ball have a nice crinkle on top.

This recipe is fabulous!  (The only change I make is using coconut oil instead of butter) .  They are quick and easy to make,  stay really soft, and everyone I ever share them with asks for the recipe.!

I made these but they did not look like the picture, most likely because of the changes I made due to allergies. I followed the recipe exactly, using gluten free flour and chia seeds mixed with water in place of the eggs. They did taste great though!

These cookies were great!! i've already made them a few times and always get good results. The only thing is is that you'll probably want to chill the dough before trying to roll them in the dough otherwise its a gooey mess. And i also used spelt freshly milled spelt flour which works great. I rarely use white flour when i bake. Thank you sooooo much for the recipe!

To say I am obsessed with these cookies would be an understatement. Like, it's bad. I could eat an entire batch of these by myself, which I have done (don't judge). I follow the directions to a T (the only thing I do is allow it to sit in the fridge to firm up for about 2 hours or longer, otherwise its a sticky nightmare when molding them into the circles to bake).  Now that the holiday season is approaching, it's becoming more acceptable for me to bake them (even though I makes these year round).

This is definitely my children's favorite cookie recipe!  I chill the dough for a few minutes in freezer or fridge to make it easier to roll them.  I also just dip the tops into the sugar, so it is a nice sparkle, but not adding too much extra sweetness.  If I make for meetings or school functions, I always have to make a double batch so some can be left at home to enjoy, because none will be left after the event!

Made the dough according to the recipe. I did chill the dough in the freezer for about 30 min and flattened the cookies with the palm before baking. They were super yummy!!

Love it, I just put the dough into the fridge overnight and rolled them into balls the next day.  Not flat-perfect.  To make my life easier I used a large zip lock bag and put 4-6 rolled balls into the bag with sugar and shook the bag a few times and the dough was covered in the sugar. Easy

I made these as just something to try, and as my Mom said "There's nothing to criticize, simply perfection." I made mine with the second teaspoon of ginger overfilled for a little extra kick, and a tad more molasses but even without that these cookies were incredibly amazing even from the first time that I made them.

I enjoy the spice wafers, but they are so hard.  I know, they're supposed to be.  LOL.  Anyway,   I found this recipe while browsing through the site.  Since I had the ingredients on hand, I gave it a try.  Oh, my goodness!  So  scrumptious!   And the aroma in the kitchen is marvelous.  They're even better the next day. Enjoy.

This recipe is a staple in our house. The only thing I've changed is that I don't add the water. I freeze half of the dough so we don't eat all them in a day. My girls love it when I make this recipe into tiny cookies for their lunches.

Ah-mazing!! Next to my shortbread cookies, this is the most requested item at Christmas. Little tidbits to facilitate the process: 1) I refrigerate the dough about 30+ minutes to firm it up before forming into balls. 2) Spray your hands lightly with cooking spray to prevent sticking. 3) I flatten them out with the back of a regular spoon that I dip in sugar, not too much, just a sniff

Absolutely delicious! I used All-whites instead of regular eggs (thanks, cholesterol genetics) and was out of cloves, but these cookies came out mouth-wateringly delicious nonetheless. I froze half the batch, and the frozen ones are just as tasty as the hot ones. I will definitely be making this recipe again!

This is a beautiful recipe - I used top grade spices and ingredients and for the orange juice (nice touch) instead of water, i squeezed a fresh orange. For my oven, the third batch I did at 300 deg. and they came out chewier and softer.

For Ginger cookies we thought these were a bit boring. Also mine did not crackle on top like the ones in the picture. In addition it was too hard to form the balls and I had to spoon drop them.

I love this cookie recipe :D Though I need to double the spices for even better flavour since me and my sister agree that the flavour is not strong enough. But then this is a nice recipe :D

I just made these cookies and can't stop eating them!  These are seriously delicious cookies, and like other cooks, I found the dough a little too soft to form balls, so I added an additional 1/4 cup of flour and they turned out soft and amazing. Next time I am going to add orange juice in place of water and 1/4 tsp. cardamom and make a double batch to see how well they freeze. I highly recommend this recipe exactly as it is if you have time to chill the dough before rolling them into balls - otherwise, just add a little extra flour and you are good to go! I made them for my husband's lunchbox treat, but at this point, I'm not sure they will make it that far! Thank you for this yummy contribution!

Good flavor.  I added more of the spices and added allspice.  I agree with other reviews that the molasses is a very strong flavor.  Next time I will use 1/2 molasses and 1/2 corn syrup.  I scooped mine with a small ice cream scoop, sprinkled with sugar and flattened with the bottom of a glass.  They turned out very flat with a crispy edge and a chewey center.

DANGEROUSLY good. I used raw sugar for the "topping" to give them some extra crunch, and following another reviewer's suggestion to sub in some liqueur for the water (I used bourbon - YUM). There must have been bandits that broke into my kitchen and stole some of my cookies, because there is just no way that two people have eaten THAT many cookies in 2 days.

I've made these cookies a few times and they are wonderful. I do suggest that you make the dough a day before baking... it makes it much easier to roll them into balls.

These taste amazing! I have no idea what other people did, but I had no issues with the batter. Wasn't sticky, and I could easily form balls with it. Didn't even have to chill it. They came out nice, thick, and round. Only difference I did was ground the cloves myself since I couldn't find any already done.

I have this basic recipe, but it calls for brown sugar. In one review someone remarked about sticky dough. In the recipe I have, the dough is refrigerated for an hour or two and if I am in a hurry I will put it in the freezer for 1/2 hour to cool. Very easy to handle when cooled.

SO GOOD! I made these cookies for Thanksgiving and they were a huge hit. Great ginger snap taste but much softer. I took the advice of some other reviews and subbed the water with oj. I chilled the batter overnight. I rolled the batter into little balls and did NOT flatten them. This made the cookies way softer.

Excellent recipe, moist, and now my hubby's favorite.  Since I was out of molasses, I used 3/4 C white sugar and 1/2 C brown sugar (since brown sugar is brown and moist because of molasses).  Just wonderful.

I was very happy at how chewy these stayed. I picked this recipe because I had all the ingredients in my cabinet except the cloves, so I replaced those with some pumpkin pie spice which I knew had cloves in it. The flavor was still great. I rolled the first batch in sugar and found that to be overkill for me, so the second batch went in with just sugar on the top half of the cookie, still a little much so the last cookies in the oven got no extra sugar, and I kept those for myself and let the kids eat the sugar coated ones. I also didn't refrigerate the dough at all, it would have probably helped to keep the dough from being sooo sticky, but I didn't think it was too big of an issue. My cookies rose a little when baking but not much, so I think this wouldn't be the best dough for rolling out and cutting into shapes. Other ginger cookie recipes I have used seem to be made more for that type of cookie, the kind that snaps and is crunchier. I loved these because they were chewy and stayed that way for the next couple days till they were all gone.

Very good recipe! Its light flavour and nice aftertaste will have you sneeking into the cookie jar.
 Only thing I changed was putting the dough into the fridge made it easier to roll. Thanks for the recipe :)

Fantastic. Just made them with my preschool daughter. Substituted the 5 TBs of brown sugar instead of the molasses and water. Although the batter was a little crumbly, we squeezed the last balls of dough together. Under bake to 8 mins if you use a convection oven, for chewy, otherwise you get ginger snaps, which are tasty too. Will try original recipe and substitute water with either OJ or liqueur.

Outstanding!  Perfect flavor, perfect texture.  Definite keeper of a recipe.  I would definitely chill the dough for at last 30 minutes, maybe an hour before forming into balls.  I had one batch that I baked without chilling and they spread too much for my liking.

AMAZING.

My adjustments: Substitute butter-flavored Crisco for margarine. (Easy to work with, rich flavor, creamy texture.)

You guys don't understand- these cookies are dangerous. They will disappear in a day and you will be like, What? Where did they go? I don't remember eating all of those! But you DID. You did, and that's why you can't fit into your jeans any more.

I've made this recipe dozens of times. Every time it's a little bit different, due to weather/humidity/my own imperfections, but that's okay. Sometimes I squish the cookies flatter, sometimes thicker, sometimes they're crispier and sometimes they're chewier. But every time they have been DELICIOUS. You can't go wrong, so just jump right in there!

I'm not even a big fan of ginger-flavored food but this one is AWESOME! I did use butter instead because I didn't have margarine at hand. The cookies came out after exact 10 mins with slightly brown crispy edges and soft inside - perfect! BTW I didn't chill the batter or let it sit, just went right ahead to roll the balls. It worked just fine, nothing gooey or messy like some of the reviews mentioned about.

I have looked for years for a great ginger cookie recipe and now I have finally found it. They are nice and soft and stay that way in a sealed container. Follow the cooking times even though the cookies don't look like they are done. It was my husband who stopped me from adding time to the baking, and I'm sure glad he did. ENJOY!!!!!

I love ginger cookies and liked that molasses was added to this batter, too.  These were very good and soft but came out flatter than the picture.  I did not use margarine, I used butter but that shouldn't have affected them.  I'm in high altitude and didn't see any specific directions.  Maybe I need to research that.

Tastes delicious! Batter was too gooey to roll so i put in fridge for 30 min and it was still gooey so i just spooned onto cookie sheet and sprinkled with sugar.  They really spread out so leave enough room between them!

Soft, spicy, delicious! I love this recipe. I add a little more ginger and chopped some of my candied ginger and threw that in as well. I ran out of white flour and substituted 3/4 cup whole wheat and it was still great.

Excellent ginger cookie! My mother usually hates gingersnaps, and this is her new favorite. Used all butter and a little ground ginger in the cinnamon sugar to roll them. Just a little extra spice :)

My 9 year old and 11 year old made these.  Very easy and super good!  The first time we made them, we used softed margarine and it worked out perfectly.  The second time I melted the margarine in the microwave and had to let the dough sit for about an hour before we could make the cookies as the dough was very sticky.  I would recommend the first way.  These were such a hit and we generally don't ever think of making gingerbread cookies.  Yum!

I tried these for the first time this year after seeing them in allrecipes magazine. I was looking for some new cookie recipes to make with ingredients I had on hand. These cookies may look average, but they taste extraordinary! I didn't have cloves, so I used allspice and used butter not margarine (as suggested in the magazine). I will definitely be making these again!!

These were perfectly round and soft/chewy. I didn't get the crackles, just a hint, but really liked the texture. I used the last of the dough to make a ginger snowman and when they started to spread I placed the face so I would know where the pieces would end up :)

I used O.J. as suggested by others and the cookies turned out great. I accidently overbaked the first batch which resulted in hard cookies, but some people actually liked them! Could've used them for a pie crust too. Also rolled the cookies in Raw sugar before baking.

Awesome cookies!  Today was my first day making them.  I read through many reviews first and took note of tips.  Instead of water I used orange juice.  I Sprayed the measuring cup with oil so the molasses would easily pour.  
And I cooled the dough in the freezer for a half hour.  It was very easy to work with. 
I kept all of the ingredients and measurements the same other than the water.  And I did exactly what the directions said.  And I sifted the flour etc.  
I found that 8 -10 minutes wasn't enough baking time.  Maybe it's my oven.  12 minutes is just right for my oven.   They turned out very yummy. They have a Slight crisp on the outside and are chewy on the inside.  And the flavor is just right.  
I made 30 cookies out of this recipe. I will definitely make them again.

my batch called for 2 and a half eggs so i decided to put 2 eggs in it. strange enough, the second egg had 2 yolks in it so it might have changed the outcome of it because it came out extremely puffy. it was more like a cake and i am not complaining. it was the best ginger cookies i have ever eaten. the only problem is that it tastes mostly of molasses.

I'm not usually a fan of gingerbread cookies but these were soft and the right amount of sugar and spice. I didn't have molasses and substituted maple syrup instead. Also, I used brown sugar instead of white. They turned out great. I used them to make reindeer cookies (M&Ms for eyes and nose, pretzels for antlers) and everyone LOVED them (except the small children because of the spice, but not many kids like gingerbread).

So delicious and easy. They are softer version of ginger snaps. Single batch made @ 40. Cook them for 9- 10 minutes.

Made these with butter rather than margarine.  Added 1/4 cup flour but you could refrigerate them instead. They are the best cookies!  Love them!

these were amazing except for the fact that they went hard over night.  if they had of stayed soft i would give them 10 stars.  they are still delicious anyway, but definitely best to eat them while theyre warm.

I didn't have any problems with these. I thought they were super easy and very delicious!  However, I did expect them to look like the picture and they did not.  I will try some of the other reviewers suggestions next time, but I will definitely make again.

These taste just like ginger snaps but are softer. Yummy! I did change one thing. I used butter instead of margarine. Using butter will eliminate the "sticky" feel prior to cooking and makes them easier to handle. If you want the crinkle top form into balls and just drop on cookie sheet after coating in sugar. They flatten out on their own and when they dry there is a very pretty authentic crinkle top.

I had high hope for these, but I will not make them again. I think I was expecting the chewy texture of a molasses crinkle cookie. I will try that one next time. These were fluffy, doughy cookies. I also expected a stronger molasses and spice taste. The worst part about these cookies was the process of making them. The dough was so wet that I had to put it in the fridge for at least an hour before trying to handle it. Even then it stuck to my hands when trying to roll it. It helped to coat my hands in sugar each time I rolled a new cookie. Finally, they looked nothing like the picture.

My friend and I had some issues. The dough was way too runny, so we put it in the freezer for a bit. It was still runny, not ball shaped and ready to be rolled into sugar. The flavour of the cookies is good, but the texture and look is awful.  I have had more luck with other gingerbread recipes.

These are excellent and easy to make. I also made them smaller so they were about the size of ginger snaps. I agree with another reviewer...you must mash them flat if you want them to look like the picture. I made them for Christmas gifts so I used red and green sugar when I rolled them. I also used Crisco baking sticks and the texture was perfect. This is a keeper for sure.

I love soft ginger cookies and this recipe did NOT disappoint!  Big soft cookies bursting with ginger, cinnamon, and cloves!  They taste even better the second day, if you don't eat them all first!  Great for gifts at Christmas too!  I'll be making them again!

I have no problem with this cookie dough being too soft. I always bake with butter though. Sometimes I use some wholewheat flour too. We all love these and I get many compliments on them.

This recipe worked out for me.....soft but chewy.  Coincidentally, this recipe was almost exactly the one printed on the back of "Mother's Molasses" bottle.  The amounts of the spices were different, (which is all a matter of personal taste anyway) as was the baking soda, which called for 2 teaspoons (I used 1 1/2) Also, I used brown sugar instead of white, which was what was called for on molasses bottle. I never use margarine, so I used butter instead. I refrigerated the dough for 1 hour and had no problem with stickiness shaping the balls (I also kept the dough refrigerated in between making batches) I did not have to flatten the balls, they baked perfectly. I also found that they baked best at around 8-9 minutes. The flavor was good, those of you that like more spice just have to  experiment with this, but honestly, I don't know why people had all these different  problems.

I love gingersnaps.  I've never had a soft ginger cookie before.  We made these with our little ones (3 1/2 years old).  We only made three modifications to the recipe: 1) substituted butter for margarine, that's what we had in the house, 2) instead of 2 1/2 cups of AP flour, we used 1 1/2 cups of AP and 3/4 cups of whole wheat flour - I wanted to see if it would create a dense cookie, it didn't and 3) to a third of the batch we added in white chocolate chips.  
We baked one batch for 9 minutes- soft in the middle, with a ever-so-slight crunch on the outside.
We baked the second batch for 11 minutes- not quite gingersnap, but definitely more on the hard side.  
Verdict- delicious!  I wasn't sure if my little kidabunks would like them - ginger being a strong scent and flavor, however  my cookie-loving daughter devoured four of them.  
The next time we bake these, we are not going to roll them in sugar; it made them a bit too sweet- it doesn't need it.
Thank you Amy for a delicious new cookie my family can enjoy making and eating together each Christmas

Good cookie,just couldn't get one batch to form into a ball or get them too look like the cookies displayed with the recipe. However, my husband loved them and my 6 year old says they are good, good, good! He asked if I could put frosting on them. I am thinking an orange glaze would be good.

Delicious! These came out really good. I like how chewy they are, and the spices were perfectly balanced and strong, which I like. However, mine did not come out quite like I expected--they were very flat. I saw that another person had this problem and ended up replacing some of the molasses with brown sugar...next time I'll try that. Because don't get me wrong, I will definitely be making these again! I made a orange and vanilla flavored glaze to drizzle over the top and it was REALLY good. Brought the cookies to a potluck and they were nearly all gone by the end. Overall, a really yummy recipe!

Great cookies. To those having trouble handling the gooey dough i would recommend filling a icing bag with it and squeezing it onto the cookie sheet. You can also fill a plastic bag, snip off a corner and squeeze it out. No fuss no muss.

I have been using an identical recipe for many years.  The only difference is that my recipes requires the dough to be chilled before baking.  I have never had any problem with rolling the cookies after chilling.  This recipe really does make the best cookies and they are a family favorite!

I triple the recipe so I make some adjustments.  
Instead of 6 3/4 c flour I use 7 c.
I also used brown sugar instead of white.
I tried using oj instead of water, but I don't really think it made a significant difference.

I see why these are so highly rated! I used half whole wheat flour, and also substituted brown sugar for half of the sugar. Delicious!

These are my go to ginger cookie. I have been making them for years now. They are soft (just don't over cook) and flavorful. I make them year round and they are always a hit. Make sure and use good ground ginger not some old package that has been sitting in the cupboard for who knows how long. I sometimes grate a little fresh ginger in, other than that I make the recipe exactly as written.

These are amazing. I followed the reviews with adding the orange juice and I added a little vanilla because i think vanilla adds amazing flavor to everything. You really do not need the added sugar on top of these cookies and like all cookies from scratch, set the dough in the fridge for about 40-60mins so it can firm up. They are really soft and chewy!

Excellent cookies" my whole family loved them and they're addictive! I found that if you refrigerate the dough for at least an hour, it's a lot less sticky and easier to handle! Thank you for this recipe!

These were great! I made mine gluten free and they tasted fantastic!! I put the dough in the fridge for about an hour and made Christmas cut out cookies. This will definitely be my go-to ginger cookie recipe from now on!

I love these cookies BUT ... 

I made these last year (added extra ginger). The cookies looked just like the picture and tasted awesome. This year I substituted the orange juice (this is one of the preferred edits) with orange liqueur, and although the cookies taste devine, they are really flat (and I am not even pressing them down).  Not sure why.  However, my cookies do look like those in the video for this recipe.  

At any rate, this recipe produces exceptionally tasty cookies.  You need to use quality (fresh) spices.  If the spices are stale, your cookies will be bland.  I suspect this is one of the issues with people who rate this recipe poorly.

I'm giving this 5 stars, based on my 2012 results. I assume I did something wrong in 2013.  I made 4X the recipe for a cookie exchange.  My cookies will be the ugly ducklings (they were last year too), but they will still be the yummiest.

I love this recipe. I didn't change much, but I did add a bit more ginger and an 1/8 tsp black pepper for a little more of a kick. Also, I used a tablespoon to scoop out dough and then flattened them with my fingers before sprinkling them with organic sugar. They came out perfect and I love the look and taste of the coarse sugar on top. These are definitely going in the books!

I use allrecipes all the time and have never rated or commented on a recipe. It's also important to note that I am not a fan of ginger or cloves. HOWEVER, this recipe rocks!!! I made it out of obligation because it's Christmastime and my daughter asked why we never eat gingerbread men cookies. So I looked for a recipe, found this one, and thought, what's the harm?, I don't have to eat it. I have a giant gingerbread man baking pan and poured all of the batter into it. I smoothed it out as best as I could and then sprinkled the whole thing with sugar. I baked 14 minutes, cooled 5-7 minutes, and then carefully turned it over onto cooling racks. It turned out sooooooo cute and it was delicious! My husband, 4 yr old, 2 yr old and I devoured it and all that was left (at least for now) is the gingerbread man's little feet. Needless to say, I am so making this recipe during the holidays, and I might just make it throughout the rest of the year! ***Like I said, I don't like cloves so I don't keep them in my pantry. I think it tasted just fine without them.***

This recipe is amazing. I'm just learning to bake, and this was one of the first recipes I tried. While baking, the entire house smells like Christmas! I brought them in to work and everyone wondered where I learned how to bake so well and wanted the recipe. I always take them out about one minute prior to being done and let them continue to bake on the cookie sheet out of the oven, then sprinkle with a little extra sugar before moving to wax paper to finish cooling. Awesome!

A keeper.

It definitely helps to chill the dough for a bit.

Don't overbake: just barely done is what you want.

Don't be afraid to be generous with the spices.

Addictive...

This recipe was wonderful! Due to my own preferences, I put in 1 tablespoon of cinnamon instead of 3/4 of a teaspoon and the cookie still turned out great! Definitely perfect for late fall and winter.

This recipe was really good.  I rarely eat gingerbread but for some reason I was craving it.  I thought it was going to be way harder than it was.  As long as you're not expecting to be able to roll this dough out and make cookie cuter gingerbread men, then this is a great recipe.   The few things I did different:  I, like many other reviewers, added 1 TBSP orange juice instead of water.  The recipe also says to roll the dough into balls, roll in sugar, an put on the cookie sheet.  After reading some of the reviews and getting to that point myself, I concluded that that was not going to be possible without refrigerating the dough (which I really did not want to do as I hate waiting for it to chill).  Instead, I sprayed two spoons with cooking oil lightly, coated in sugar, and then rolled the dough, drop cookie style.  I then repeated this proceedure with a fork to allow me to flatted the cookies as if I were making peanut butter cookies.  You can't see the marks like you would in a peanutbutter cookie and they tasted delicious, though they were a little flat (but this did not bother me).

These were good. Still chewy even though I kneaded to heck out of them! I pressed them out and used cookie cutter to make shapes with my 4 year old. The batter was pretty crumbly toward the end! lol 
The ones we just made as regular cookies worked out better than the shapes. also they did dry out after only a couple days it they were very tasty until then!

I have made these MANY times.  Since I do not use margarine, I make them using one half cup butter flavored shortening and one quarter cup butter.  I also followed the recommendationsof other reviewers and increased the ginger to one tablespoon and the cinnamon to one teaspoon.

DELICIOUS cookies! I'm usually not a fan of ginger cookies because they tend to be hard and more "snappy." This recipe is great because the cookies come out soft and stay soft for days after they've been baked. Also, they're not too sweet or spicy, but definitely easily altered if you prefer a spicier taste. LOVE THEM!

Amazingly delicious.  I made exactly according to the recipe, except, I added a couple pinches of flour to help roll the dough.  Make sure you dont over roll your balls or you won't get the pretty crackle effect.

These were fabulous! I was a little skeptical that they would turn out huge & cakey but they flattened down nicely once they were out of the oven. Didn't bother mixing the baking soda with the hot water. I absolutely recommend chilling the dough, otherwise it is a sticky unrollable mess! 20 min. in the freezer was about perfect. Added a little cinnamon - will probably add larger amounts of the spices next time. But overall a fantastic cookie!

FANTASTIC gingerbread cookie recipe! Followed to a T but took suggestions and did 1 tbs OJ instead of water. Ahmazing!! I also decided to "try" rolling and using cookie cutters and the result was beautiful. Thicker, they are yummy and chewy. Thinner and they are crisp gingersnaps. WIN/WIN situation here.

AWESOME.  The dough was perfect to work with, and they are beautiful, soft, delicious cookies.  I used room-temperature butter instead of margarine. I also added a tsp of vanilla.  I have no idea how (according to some reviews) anyone would end up with runny batter (unless they melted the margarine/butter?), or how they could end up with hard or flat cookies.  These are just perfect cookies.  Mine appear lighter in colour and a bit puffier than the picture posted.  Once cooled, put in a container with a sealed lid to keep them nice and soft, of course.

I am making these for the first time and had to substitute the eggs to make the recipe vegan friendly.  They live up to all the wonderful reviews posted.  I will be donating them for a fall bake sale and am positive they will be a big hit.

I have made this recipe twice. The first time I followed the recipe as is, then chilled the dough in the freezer for 30 minutes and it turned out good. The second time I substituted some of the white sugar with brown to make them a little on the chewy side. Also I replaced water with fresh orange juice, added 1 tsp of zested orange, and added 3/4 cup of chopped crystalized ginger...and oh my god...the orange really made loads of difference. The taste was out of this world and they were gone so quick! One thing though...the look of my cookies were not quite like what they have in the picture here. They were more like medium brown and the surface was smooth (they didn't have those cracks). I wonder what i did wrong.

Amazing taste. A college roommate shared her grandmothers recipe with me and I haven't found anything as good until now. Her grandmother always added fresh cracked pepper to her ginger cookies and I add about 1/4-1/2 tsp to the spices and flour moisture also. The only other changes I make to this are what other reviewers have suggested - half brown/half white sugar and orange juice in lieu of water. Next time I will dip one side in melted white chocolate. I make them really big so it yields 13 cookies.

My husband just said these might be the best cookies ever. I was forced to make a few changes because I ran out of ingredients. About a third of my flour was whole wheat. Because I ran out of sugar, I rolled in brown sugar. Cooking time did take around 13-15 minutes.

I'm not usually a fan of ginger cookies but after taste-testing a cookie from the first batch I could barely keep myself from eating them all! I thought I followed the recipe exactly but I ended up with about 3 dozen cookies instead of the 2 it specifies. Perhaps my "walnut size" is on the small side. They came out perfect and I'm glad I tried this recipe. I did have to stick the batter in the refrigerator for a couple minutes in between batches or else it became too sticky to roll into balls.

These turned out perfectly. I did as another suggested and refrigerated my dough for 30 minutes before baking however I didn't find that it was a gooey mess as described by some. I ended up using my hands to mix dough completely and had NO problems with it sticking to my hands. I did however press my cookies with a fork instead of baking them in a ball shape. Not sure if it would have made a difference but they turned out fabulous and TASTY!!!

Kid approved!  My batch made 33...disappeared quickly.  Did not refrigerate dough - just dropped teaspoon sized globs into a sugared pie plate, rolled slightly and popped onto 3 cookie sheets.  Don't need to press flat ...will do this on their own. Easy.

We used coconut butter instead of butter, that worked fine. We also added kosher salt, which is always a good idea. They were mushy, a little time in the freezer solved this right away. Very good recipe! And smooth those cookies down just the right amount

I had a friend over for a chat the first time I made these.  I had never been too fond of ginger cookies, but within 30 minutes of these coming out of the oven, they were all gone!  Made a few changes, accidently only put 1/2 c butter instead of 3/4 c- did not use margarine.  Made these again later with correct amount of butter, and the cookies were not near as soft and chewy (I have made these several times now).  Don't know it that has anything to do with the altitude?  I live at 0.  I also upped the amount of cinnamon to 1 tsp. I also followed others suggestions and substituted brown sugar for the white, and also added a Tbsp of orange juice.

Absolutely amazing recipe. Other reviews are right though, it's helpful to refrigerate the dough or it will stick to your hands too much when rolling. I don't flatten them at all and they melt into a good shape (I didn't flatten them because this recipe is similar to my mom's molasses crinkles recipe, which doesn't call for flattening. these cookies melted even more than the molasses crinkles do).

I discovered this recipe about 5 years ago here, and haven't stopped making them since. Every time I get compliments and they don't last very long in the jar, even though it's just me and my husband, no kids. I think they might just be my favorite cookies of all times. Totally recommend.

My family loves ginger/molasses cookies. Because of the great reviews, we decided to try this recipe, however, we were disappointed and will stick with our tried and true family recipe. The dough is too wet and sticky, even though I refrigerated it first. Also, you have to flatten them prior to baking, so you don't get that nice crinkle. At least not like our other recipe. But all this would be mute, if the taste was superior, but it wasn't. We'll continue using our other recipe.

LOVE this. It's so simple and doesn't require any "fancy ingredients" that I wouldn't have on hand in the kitchen.  I was out of molasses so used honey & I used Ener-g egg replacer as well as earth balance margarine, & it turned out fantastic =) ill deffinately make this again!

Followed the recipe to a T and they were delicious. They looked a little under done after 11 minutes but took them out anyway. They were perfect. We usually make chocolate chip cookies but didn't have chocolate chips. My 13 year old nephew and 9 year old niece loved these almost as much as chocolate chip (phew!) I will definitely try them again and would take the advise to substitute the water for orange liqueur.

My dough didn't seem to be as sticky as some other reviewers; I was able to roll it into balls right away. The cookies were perfectly spiced and perfectly soft and delicious. I'm normally a chocolate chip cookie type of gal, but I think I could honestly say that these cookies are the best I've ever made.

OK I just submitted a review on these and listed the amount of brown sugar I used to substitute for molasses.  The amount I listed was based on the fact that I doubled the recipe.  If you were not doubling, the amount would be 5 TBS packed brown sugar. I couldn't figure out if there was a way to edit the review after it was already posted, so hopefully this will remedy the error. Apologies!

These were very tasty! Also a lot softer than gingersnaps. I loved how the sugar sparkled on top and gave it a nice appearance.

relly good recipe. However I found that the dough was too hard to work with and the cookies stuck to the bottom. I cut the mollases to 3-4 tbsp and it still tasted great. Thanks

Delicious!  I used the tbsp of orange juice instead of water like someone suggested. This is my first time making them so I have no form of reference but they were perfect.  Moist and oh so tasty.  This is a keeper for sure!

Disappointed with the results; too thin and soft.  Followed the recipe exactly except to substitute OJ for the water.  Will stick with my regular molasses/ginger cookie recipe.

It may have just been the molasses I used but I found that I did not need the water.  I had to add extra flour to get the proper consistency.  A bit pale but once you taste them  mmmmm good!

Yum!!! A great recipe! Only thing i did different was refrigerate the dough before shaping, cuz it is a very sticky dough.  Mine took only 8 minutes in the oven to be soft and chewy inside, and crispy on the bottom :) I will make these again, and again :)

HOLY COW these are some of the greatest cookies ever. I have made these so many times, including a teachers' Thanksgiving party in Greece where the American teachers were "sharing" the holiday with colleagues, and they get snapped up so fast every time! Sometimes mine cook and kind of flatten out. I imagine that's because I'm impatient and don't refrigerate the dough enough or something. I don't mind, though. Still yummy. The sugar is a lovely touch!

I tried using the oj instead of water like other people. I didn't really taste it. The overall flavor was very good but my cookies came out too flat. After these cookies cool they get hard which is ok if that is what you are expecting. I also tried using 5 tablespoons brown sugar instead of molasses as was suggested by another user. I will make these cookies again but will try to adapt them further. Maybe will put them in the fridge next time or follow other suggestions.

Can't even believe how good these were, or that I was the one who made them. Wow!! Making them now for second time, cut everything in half so I don't have 2 dozen cookies sitting around to pig out on! Walnut-sized is a little ambiguous - I'd say shape each one to ball the size of pink pong ball.

These cookies are DELICIOUS.  I'm doing lower carb so I made them with a sugar free yellow cake mix.  Used the cake mix as my flour and baking soda.  They stayed real soft but spread out like a thin pancake when baking so I think the next time I will use a little less butter and add maybe a little flour to the mix. I also used 1/2  splenda instead of sugar and 1/2 brown sugar blend.  I will definitely keep making these when I think I want something sweet.

I made these exactly as instructed and they turned out great.  I will definitely make these again. My husband loves ginger snaps, so he is going to flip over these.  I don't eat wheat but with all the great reviews I just had to try them.  Now I wish I hadn't.  Now I know what I am missing.  What we do for our husbands and children.

First of all, I do not like molasses, so I used Karo dark instead. I cooked them for 8 minutes for the first pan, but they got crispy, so I lowered time to 7 minutes. They were crispy too. They had amazing flavor and I will definitely be making them again. The directions say to lightly smash the balls, and one reviewer said she ended up with ginger balls instead of cookies, so I smashed similar to how I would peanut butter cookies, but without the fork. Maybe I will smash less next time for a softer cookie... Not sure about that, but they were not soft.

I have been making these cookies for over 40 years.  Chill the dough for at least an hour - I usually chill the dough overnight- this makes it easier to handle, I also use a small cookie scoop and that makes things go smoothly and quickly.  Thanks for the post.

OUTSTANDING!  If you are looking for an old-fashioned molasses cookie-here it is.  I will make these again and again.  The flavor is outstanding, easy to make and bake.  I cannot give enough praise to this recipe.

Great flavor, but WARNING to all considering this for a holiday treat: they only last about a week before going stale, so don't over-look them if you have lots of sweets around. If you need to, the dough freezes very nicely.

My family couldn't get enough of them. I've been asked by my nephews to send them more in a care package at their schools.

I liked putting red and green sugar on top for the Christmas season.

The cookies were a hit during our Christmas cookie exchange! A friend asked about the recipe :). I made my second batch for a dinner party with whole wheat flour but it did come out as good as the first one. But our dinner guests still LOVE them! Definitely make it many times in 2013!

These are delicious and perfect for the holidays.  They are soft and chewy.  Instead of rolling them in balls, I used a cookie scoop and dropped them into a bowl of sugar and rolled them around to coat them.  It was less messy this way.

delicious! easy and true to their title.....SOFT!!! they keep SOFT for days....this was helpful to me since I made a huge batch of these cookies a couple of hours before hurricane Sandy claimed my power. I didn't have molasses on hand so I substituted maple syrup and it didn't deter the taste one bit. thank you for a great recipe. highly recommended.

Didn't have ground cloves so I used nutmeg. Didn't have molasses so I used honey/maple syrup. Used orange juice instead of water and brown sugar than the white sugar. Left the dough in the freezer for 15 min before forming. Sprinkled cinnamon and white sugar on one side. Baked for 8 minutes. Turned out great! Thank you!

Delicious. Used 1/2 the sugar; All whole wheat flour; and vegan margarine; a tad bit more ginger. HEAVEN. Soft, puffy, yummy. Family closed their eyes while eating enjoying a bit of this ginger goodness.

I have made this recipe the last couple of years and I will for a long time!  I love it and so does everyone else that tries it.  Just melts in your mouth.  Unlike your normal gingerbread men that you make these are the perfect ginger/molasses cookies and are super soft.  Can't just have one.  ;)
I use a small ice cream scoop and roll in my and then only roll half in sugar (the top).

awesome recipe, although i didn't have enough white sugar and no molasses at all... I substituted the molasses with maple syrup(not real maple syrup) and I used the same amount of brown sugar. the dough was a bit like batter so i added 1/4 a cup of brown sugar(additional to original amount) and about 1/2 a cup more flour until it turned into dough!! they look, smell and taste great but for the flavor of the molasses there really is no substitute. the end result for me was a soft crunchy treat with just a hint of those ginger bread seasonings.

You'll have to double the recipe to make up for the cookies you eat while baking the second batch. In our kitchen, we learned that these need to bake closer to ten minutes than eight like the recipe says. Make sure to flatten a little more than slightly.

I'm looking for another big soft ginger cookie recipe this year. I've made these two years in a row now and they end up really flat (even though they taste good).  I followed the directions to a T both times.

Turned out yummy! It's a keeper! I also used the OJ instead of water because I had some. I flattened the first batch and progressively flattened less with each cookie sheet full. The last ones weren't flattened at all. Turned out great with no time adjustment. You better do a double batch...just a warning.

AWESOME, CHEWY & YUMMY!! Used the orange juice, butter & organic flour. Baked 6 min in convection oven, sat for 5 min on cookie sheet. 

My first Gingerbread cookies. My son who doesn't like Ginger even ate them. Whew, what a relief a great recipe!!!

 I think i'm gonna try to wrap it in parchment paper and freeze to cut off and bake as needed. AMY1028, my said to tell you, "thank you." He tried it cause mommy made them and he liked them!

I didn't have any issues with this recipe. I substituted the recommended oj for water, but only because I didn't see the point of using water when oj might make a difference in the flavor.  Meh.  I probably still would have flattened the cookies more than "slightly", except the last batch I forgot, and they did that great crinkle that the picture shows. It is a dynamite little cookie, and easy to roll in the sugar, didn't seem sticky like the complaints. Oh, what size walnuts are they talking about?  I still got three dozen good size cookies out of this recipe!

I made these cookies and my dad said they were the best gingerbread cookies he's ever had.  I also took them in to my coworkers who also loved them.  Funny thing is I made one batch and my mom accidentally took them to church and 10 people ate alllll 24 cookies...  so I had to make a second batch.  The 2nd batch I used about a tablespoon of cloves because I wanted a stronger taste.  These really do stay soft...  I have some still (a week later) and they are still soft chewy and moist!

The only change I made was using an equal amount of butter instead of margarine.  I used a small cookie scoop and placed them right into the sugar, rolled it and placed it on the cookie sheet.  Then I used a glass to flatten the cookie slightly.  REALLY yummy cookies!  Even my kids who hate gingerbread cookies, gobbled these up!

Very good recipe making for 2nd time -- Just realized its almost identical recipe found on jar of Grandmas Molasses -- Called Molasses Crinkles. -- jar recipe calls for Crisco instead of butter/margarine and a little less flour. Comes great but I never get 2 dozen unless i make cookies small.

I liked this recipe a lot. I want to try it again an add a tsp of cinnamon to the mix and maybe try replacing 1/2 of the butter w/ apple sauce.  I also didn't make them quite as big as the recipe calls for apparently, since I yielded 3 dozen cookies from the batch.

Nice texture to this cookie. I roll mine in a small ball and then SLIGHTLY flatten the dough, dip it in sugar, and place on parchment paper. Cookie is approx. 1" round and baked perfectly in 9 1/2 minutes. DO NOT OVERBAKE OR IT WILL BE ROCK HARD! Found the 1/4 cup molasses left a somewhat strong aftertaste so I would cut back slightly next time. Otherwise, yummy blend of spices.

I was looking for an easier version of gingerbread cut-outs and these are them! They are very tasty and chewy. One thing I had a problem with is that the bottoms baked quickly/burnt. I think it might've been because I used a cookie sheet with sides. Just a warning for others.(I was able to salvage all but 4 cookies).

Very tasty!  I doubled the recipe and followed the directions, for some reason mine are a lot lighter in color.  I like the dark ones in the picture.   I cooked the first batch at 8 minutes because I like them soft but they were a little undercooked.  9 minutes seemed to be just right. Family gave them a big thumbs up!

I'm not a fan of ginger cookies typically but these are FANTASTIC. Use the orange juice instead of the water and they are jaw dropping awesomeness in cookie form. I'm about to make some right now! I hate that I love this recipe!

I used butter instead of margarine, but otherwise followed the directions exactly.  They were tasty enough, but didn't have that nice cracked look like in the photo.  For my taste, they also weren't molassas-y enough, and they had a rather cakey texture, not soft chewy like the ones I get from the bakery.  Won't use this recipe again.

I cannot brag enough about these cookies!!! These are hands down my absolute most favorite cookies ever. Everything about them was perfect, from the taste to the texture. A little crunchy on the outside and sooooooo soft and chewy on the inside. If I could give this recioe ten stars I would!!!  These cookies only lasted a couple days because we couldn't stop eating them!

These were delicious. I had to make another batch over the holidays because they disappeared so fast. I also used the gingerbread frosting from this site (you need to double that recipe to cover 1 batch of these cookies).

I used room temperature butter instead of margarine because I like it better. I also doubled the spices just because we love the kick-but it tends to be too much for kids. I didn't have to flatten a whole lot like another review stated because butter tends to spread out. Someone complained that they were too flat. Well ginger and molasses cookies are supposed to be flat. These aren't drop cookies! Make sure you don't put them too close together and you will have mighty fine cookies.

This is just what I was looking for! I am so happy I found this delicious recipe! Look no further! They have a great flavor and come out soft and chewy! The only thing I did different is I used butter instead of margarine. The ginger does give it quite a kick! I asked my husband if I should use a tad less when I make them again and he said "No!" because "I love, love, love them"! I did not have any problems forming them into balls or them falling flat and hard. Watch the video. Refrigerate the dough for 30-45 minutes. Flour your hands each ball you make. Roll it the size of a walnut and press it slightly with the bottom of the cup. In ten minutes later mine came out perfect. I have a new addiction!

This recipe is exactly what I have been looking for.  It's easy to make and taste like gingerbread.  Other talked about it be difficult to roll into balls, I had no problem at all. Only time it was sticky was if a spot did not have the molasses worked into the dough but that only happened once for me.  I had hubby to taste the cookie after baking, he said I don't like gingerbread but this is delicious.  I, too, used the orange juice instead of water and I made them ginger snap size.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe with all of us.

I used turbinado sugar instead of white sugar, added 3 caps of orange extract to the dough, and rolled the cookie dough ball tops in turbinado sugar before placing on the baking sheet. People will rave about these.

These were very good. I made as written but instead of margarine I used butter. However my cookies didn't turn out cracked on top, and they were not a soft cookie like I was expecting. They turned out kind of crunchy and chewy. They were also quite thin but were still tasty. I put icing on top as well. If I end up making these again, I think I will try using brown sugar like a different reviewer suggested.

the ginger cookies turned out freaking awesome!! the taste, texture, and chew were perfect. it was a really simple recipe.  like some said have said before, the dough is a bit sticky. some also said to just drop the dough into the sugar and roll from there. worked out well and wasn't messy.  but other than that i recommend it! i'm sure you'd like them too!

These are AMAZING. So delicious. I used butter instead of margarine. They have a nice little crisp on the outside, and very soft and chewy on the inside. Just perfect. The only little criticism I have, is that they were a little too sweet. I think next time I will reduce the sugar to 2/3 cup, because you are adding extra sugar on the outside. Thanks so much! I couldn't stop eating the dough!

Was feeling the holiday spirit, and this caught my eye.  All in all, very good, but very sweet.  My first thought is not to roll them in sugar at all.  As it was, I only dipped the top in the sugar, and it was still sweeeeeet.  I didn't get puffy cookies, but that's probably because I over-creamed the butter/sugar.  I did use 1/2 butter and 1/2 butter flavored Crisco which could have had a little to do with that.  Frankly, I think they didn't need to be flattened.  First tray I cooked closer to 8 minutes, and the second tray I cooked closer to 10.  I liked the 10 minute ones.  Better crispy outer layer, but still soft in the middle.  I will give it another go, but I will be more careful creaming, and I will leave them as balls like I do my sugar cookies.  Oh, unless you are one of "those" people who can manage to eat just one cookie and be done, double the recipe.  2 dozen cookies is just a tease.

These are phenomenal. Be sure to keep them in an airtight container as the recipe says--I had one batch in a ziploc and one in a cookie jar, and the cookie jar batch got a bit too crunchy too fast. The others stayed soft and delicious. I'm about to make my third batch in a week.

Wonderful! These cookies have a lot of flavor and are really easy to make. I didn't let them sit at all, just made sure I creamed the dough thoroughly at each step, and they turned out well. They don't look like the main picture with the cracks, but I made them too small to really do that. One thing I would note is that they don't expand while baking. Make sure to flatten them to the size you want. After that, enjoy! They're a big hit.

This is definitely a GREAT recipe! The cookies are absolutely delicious. However, as another reviewer mentioned, you REALLY have to flatten out the dough balls, they hardly spread at all. Also, the dough is pretty crumbly, so you have to kind of work to form it together. Still excellent though!

This recipe was fantastic - I made a couple of alterations but all was just great in the end. I added a pinch of freshly grated ginger for some extra gingery smell and replaced the molasses with carob syrup (which is super healthy). They were absolutely great & child-friendly as well! Will definitely do it again for Christmas time!

My husband now ranks these #2 on his all time favorite cookies list. (Right after the Betty Crocker Chocolate Chip recipe) This surprised me considering that before I made them he was quite sure that he was NOT a fan of ginger cookies at all. I'd call that a win! :)

My mother "doesn't care for" ginger-anything but she loved these cookies as per recipe.  Everyone else wanted more ginger-flavor but loved them all the same.  Very good recipe.  :)

I have to admit I'm not a huge fan of ginger cookies, but wo, these are amazing! I realized I did not have ground cloves, so I used ground nutmeg instead and they were still amazing!

I had never made ginger cookies before and these turned out great!They weren't too strong, and they're very simple to make. I did try it with orange juice and thought it was very good. I made it without the first time though and can't say that it made an overhwhelming difference. I am adding this recipe to my regular list of goodies.

love these cookies!  And friends love when I make them too. I do refridgate the dough to get stiffer for rolling in the sugar.  Trust me, this step is super important for cleaner hands and amazing cookies.  Super easy to make and I agree with adding the orange juice or the triple sec/cointreau in place of the water.  I have also added orange liqueur or a sugar maple liqueur.

I have to try making them again following the recipe exactly but this time I tried using all applesauce instead of butter and they turned out great but very cake-like.  I think they could use more spice as well for added flavor which is why I gave them a 3.  The texture and puffiness could have been from not using butter but the flavor wasn't very strong.

Amazingly good.  I made these cookies along with another recipe for Chocolate chip cookies one weekend and these were gone first! For a soft cookie be careful not to flatten too much.

Nice, soft and gingerbready! Actually thought I should use a cookie cutter to make gingerbread men instead of little round cookies! Not that they would roll out and cut that easily, just based on holiday taste. Did as previous users suggested and refrigerated before rolling into tiny balls and flattening.

Fantastic recipe!  It was my first recipe off allrecipes as well.
They were a tad sweet for my personal taste but they went down a real treat for afternoon tea at my work the next day!
Sweetness may have been down to the fact I had run out of Molasses and had to use Golden Syrup instead... so will be baking again with the real deal.

Wow!! These are the best tasting ginger cookies I have ever tried!  I call them dangerous, because we can't stop eating them.  I let the dough sit in the fridge for about 10 minutes before rolling them into balls, cuz it was kind of gooey to work with, but they turned out perfect. This is exactly the taste I had been looking for!

I just took these out of the oven about 10 minutes ago. They are DELISH, but flat! I followed the recipe as is, so I'm not sure what I did wrong. Maybe I flattened them too much before I put them in the oven? I don't know. So they aren't beautiful, but they taste wonderful. I made these for my boyfriend, but I'm not sure they'll be here when he gets home tonight! The taste and is 5 stars (and 5 stars for how easy it is!), but I'm giving this 4 since mine are flat and I followed the recipe exactly. But I'll making these again and will tweak to see if it works. Thanks for a great recipe that I know I'll turn to again!!

I made these when I was pregnant and they did wonders for my morning sickness. Not only this, they were the best tasting cookies I've ever had! The only thing I did differently is add 1/2 cup sugar instead of the full cup. They were still sweet because of the final coat of sugar on the outside.  There is a hint of ginger. Just enough to get the taste, but not overpowering. Sweet, yummy goodness!!!

(3 of my sisters were pregnant this last year and I make these cookies for them.  They keep asking for more!)

Made these because I love the big soft ginger cookies at the Whole Foods Store. Big disappointment after reading all the great reviews. Followed the recipe as is except used wheat flour and the cookies were so soft they fell apart( not in a good way). They were overly sugary.

Well, I am not surprised these are rated so high- they are delicious!  Very simple to make, and man do they smell great while baking!  I took them to a party, and they were a huge hit.  I am thinking about making another batch right now, as I only got one cookie before!  Thanks AMY1028 :)  Oh, I meant to add that I subbed Cointreau for the water...I think that added a lovely flavor!

I bake and consume a LOT of cookies.  These cookies are made in heaven.  Modifications:  Added 1 tsp vanilla; let them sit for a while before rolling them into balls; and didn't roll the balls in sugar.  They came out perfectly.  I didn't need to do this, but if the dough is too sticky to roll into balls, refrigerate the dough for a bit and then try rolling.

This has become a regular dessert at the Barefoot house, Papa loves ginger cookies, and this is the best one I've found yet.  I've already made it about 6 times in the last 6 months.

I used butter, same measurement as the margarine. I would up the spices as I like to really taste spices, and would omit sugar rolling at the end because they were on the higher end of sweet. BUT these are easy, the texture is great, nice and soft, and the flavor is really wonderful even as-is. I highly recommend. Other reviews helped me too.

I gave these cookies a try the other day and loved them! I added 1 Tb orange juice instead of water, like a lot of people did, and the flavor is spot on. I had to use syrup instead of molasses because I can't find it where I live, but they were still amazing. They DO stay soft!

Loved these cookies. I added just a half teaspoon more ginger because I like it so much. I sprinkled the 2 teaspoons of sugar over the very sticky dough and scooped instead of rolling into balls.

These things are AMAZING. They're perfectly spiced and true to the name--they really do stay soft. I recommend using honey instead of molasses: it makes the cookies a tad sweeter and not as chewy.

This  is a fantastic soft  cookie. I use 1 Tbls of orange juice instead of water. These are great cookies to substitute for graham crackers in making s'mores. I use the giant marshmallows. Big hit with all the family! Patrizia.

I remember making these but they got eaten before I had a chance to taste them myself.  My husband and kids said these are the best ginger cookies ever.  Even better than their favorite ones from Trader Joes.. This is a keeper.  Thanks!

I use this recipe every year! We host an annual Cookie Decorating Party for our children's classes and friends. I make up 9 or 10 of the recipes and refrigerate them for a few days then cut out the people and the kids decorate then with frosting and all kinds of candy. Messy fun! My kids look forward to it every year!

AMAZING cookies! My husband, who has never liked a ginger anything in his life, LOVED these! I also used 1 Tbsp orange juice (instead of water), and since I'm at high altitude I used 2 1/2 cups of flour.

Great recipe! I made them last month and omitted the water (by mistake) and they turned out great. A more recent attempt produced a stickier dough. As one reviewer noted, waiting about thirty minutes, DID make the dough more manageable. 

I favour a spicier cookie so I added a little freshly cracked black pepper to the final sugar roll-mix and  I might add some cloves/nutmeg next time. 

I love the idea of using an orange accent! I'll try that one, too!

These cookies are very good.  Mine came out flat, but they were soft and tasted great.  I chilled the dough for about an hour before rolling, and I didn't bother with flattening the balls.

Big hit.  I made two batches so far.  One just like the recipe and the other with smart balance not butter.  and stevia not sugar.  I also used whole wheat all purpose on the second batch.  Still a big hit for all not just the health conscious.

At my house we like a little extra spice, so I add at least a half teaspoon extra of all of the spices, especially the ginger!! And I also add a 1/4c more of the molasses, this does mean I have to add extra flour as well though. Fantastic hearty recepie!! My whole family gets excited to see these being put together.

These were terrific as advertised! They tasted great, and stayed soft but mine did not have crinkle tops. I did use 1/2 stick butter and 1 stick margerine for the 3/4 cup margerine. Used 1 TB fresh squeezed orange juice instead of water. Also doubled all spices and that was perfect. Will make again!

Awesome cookies! They are a bit gooey to roll to balls so I (in neat freak fashion) passed on that part and dropped them onto the sheet and sprinkled with sugar. Worked out GREAT!

I have made these many times. In the years I've been making them, I've always added nutmeg. I have now, in the last two batches, added ground allspice after seeing it in a gingerbread recipe. Very tasty! I have found that one minute too long will start to crisp them up, so if you want them soft, take them out when you're not quite sure and let them sit on the pan for a couple of minutes.

I had a few complaints about the cookies WHILE I was making them, "I don't like gingerbread" and "Gross!  I hate molasses!"  After they came out of the oven I made them try just one bite, and they walked away with a handful of cookies and were commenting on how good they are.  Thanks for a great recipe.

These were pretty good. They remind me of the flavors of Christmas. : ) The major difference between these cookies and other gingerbread tasting cookies is they really are soft and chewy.

Usually not a fan of Ginger or Ginger cookies, but I really enjoyed every bite. They came out very moist, soft and flavorful. I thought 24 cookies would be enough to feed a family of 7 for dessert, but I was wrong. The dough spreads so make sure you roll it to the size of a walnut( the cook out 1 to 2" bigger than a silver dollar. I actually prefer my cookies a little bigger. Hint: don't use a glass pan.

AMAZING COOKIES! I didn't have cloves so I had to leave it out. I added more cinnamon, a pinch of nutmeg and used butter. These cookies are too good to have in the house because I will eat them all. This is a new favorite. I added currants in half the batch - it is good with or without them.

Excellent cookie. Read reviews before baking so I chilled dough in frig 30 mins before baking. That was a good suggestion as dough is very sticky. I baked one batch without flattening and another flattening slightly. The batch that I did not flatten turned out looking like the picture and were the size of Ginger Snaps. The other batch did not look like the picture and were too thin. I cooked the remaining dough without flattening. Also (don't know if this makes a difference), I didn't have 3/4 cup softened margarine, so used 1/2 cup butter-flavored Crisco and 1/4 cup softened butter. Thanks for posting this wonderful recipe.

Loved these cookies.  I used OJ instead of water like another reviewer suggested. They were fabulous. I topped them off with some white frosting and they were even better. Very soft and moist. The only thing would be to make sure you flatten them a little bit before you bake them.

These have great flavor, however, I'm giving it 4 stars because of the inconsistent results I got making them two times. The first time I made them they were not soft at all--they were more like ginger snaps. Still good; my husband said some of the best cookies I've ever made. I used brown sugar instead of white sugar for added flavor and subbed orange extract for the tbsp of water, which also added some nice flavor. The second time I made them, they turned out soft and crumbly. Maybe it was because I left the dough in the fridge overnight and used Splenda instead of brown sugar? I'll try again with brown sugar and see how it turns out...

I have made these cookies for years now and they are always a hit for gifts at christmas time; simple, tasty and look beautiful wrapped up. I have never had trouble with the stickiness other talk about - they are a snap to make. Not that they will last long, but they actually do stay chewy. Baked a bit longer they also make a great snap.  I recently subbed in fancy molasses for regular, just cause it's what I had on hand - and the hubby actually noticed and said he loved them even more! Yum Yum.

While these cookies taste good, had some trouble with the recipe.  Made according to the recipe the batter was so sticky couldn't roll into balls.  So I added more flour, almost a cup more so I could work with the dough.  Also had to increase cooking time to 11 minutes and they didn't fall all the way down.  But they tasted great and were nice and fluffy.

Maybe it's just me, but I don't think I like the ginger taste because the cookies weren't as impressive as I thought they would be.  I also had to bake them for much longer than the suggested time (about 15-20 mins) for them to have a crumbly-cookie texture instead of bread-like texture.

These were alright, to me they had a little too much ginger for my taste. I think with a little less they would be perfect.

Great Ginger cookies - thank you.  I made them exactly as the recipe stated but next time I may reduce the sugar slightly.  I made them for my grandson but my husband (who said he wasn't a big fan of ginger cookies!) kept coming back for more!

Absolutely delicious! Amy's walnuts must be bigger than mine because I ended up with 40 cookies based on the 24 serving recipe (making the dough balls the size of a walnut). I made mine with BUTTER, others may or may not consider this a major change. I would never use margarine.

I use butter instead of margarine and substitute extra ginger for the cloves and cinnamon (allergy in the family).  The cookie is quite flat, but soft, chewy and very nice looking.   A lady in my office requested the recipe as part of her retirement gift. I mail these every year to my in laws and they always travel well.

These cookies are quick to make. My son and I had them oven ready in less than 10 min. The dough was soft, but I didn't have any problem with it being too sticky. We thought they were pretty good, but probably will not make again as there are other cookies we like better.

These cookies are amazing.  I have made them several times and they are a huge hit each time.  I drizzle frosting made of confectioners sugar and water on top instead of rolling in sugar.

I am on the hunt for an intense molasses-ginger cookie recipe with an almost too strong molasses flavor, and a dark, gooey/soft texture (any suggestions?)...and these are not it. However, this recipe makes BOMB soft gingerbread cookies...and I am not even that much of a fan of gingerbread. Easy to make, fantastic texture (like perfect soft cookie texture; the texture kind of reminded me of a well kneaded bread, if that makes any sense...but of course softer, and sweeter since it is a cookie), great taste! Will definitely make them again...didn't have any cloves but used nutmeg instead...turned out just fine

I don't normally comment on recipes, but this one is SO GOOD that I have to. I originally planned on sharing the cookies with the cast of my musical (that's why I baked them), but after eating one, I don't think I will... :)

LOVE these cookies! Substitutions based on what I had at home: butter instead of margarine and  replaced cloves with allspice. Followed the rest of the recipe exactly but didn't add extra sugar to the balls and refrigerated a while before baking and in between batches to make the dough more managable. These came out perfect and beautifully crackled :-)

These totally remind me of the Ginger Molasses cookies at Starbucks.  They're so soft and spicy!  I was afraid 1 cup of sugar would be too much so I used 3/4 cup of brown sugar and about 1/4 cup of white sugar for sprinkling.  I garnished them with candied ginger - yum!

These are so delicious!  I call these my "you can't mess these up cookies."  I didn't have molasses so I used 1/8c brown sugar and 1/8c honey.  I didn't have all of the margarine that I needed so I substituted shortening for some of it.  I can't imagine these cookies tasting any better.  Yum!

OH BOY!  These cookies are ridiculous.  I've made them twice now.  I added 3 tblsp of orange juice and 2 tsp of pwd ginger and 1 tsp of fresh ground ginger (added to wet mix).  I added a little more cin, cloves also.  Hard to mess this up either way.  Let the batter sit for a couple hrs so it's easier to handle.  I did with and with out the rolled sugar.  Both are amazing.

I shouldn't have waited so long to post a review.  I visited my family in Arizona this past October and my sister brought these to dinner where everyone went crazy over them.  She told me the recipe was on allrecipes.com, and that it had over two thousand reviews.  I came home and searched for it immediately.  I ended up making them approximately ten times over the holidays, getting rave reviews each time.  An easy enough recipe to yield the most delicious cookie that comes out perfect each and every time!  It has now surpassed the chocolate chip cookie as the family favorite in our house!!  I'd give it more than five stars if that were an option:)

AMAZING! I did change the recipe a tiny bit, using brown sugar and, like another rater suggested, OJ instead of water. I also used egg replacer. Even with these changes, they are honestly the BEST ginger cookie I have ever come across. Perfection.

These are excellent. Easy to make and turn out fantastic! Additions were nice as well; candied ginger chopped fine and white chocolate chunks! Great cookies, thanks so much!

Wow were these great cookies!  The only thing I did differently from the recipe was that I substituted OJ for the H2O as others recommended.  I don't know why so many people complained about the dough being overly sticky and hard to work with.  While the dough was soft, I found it easy to work with right away - no chilling needed.  It's obviously not going to have the consistency of a sugar cookie or choc. chip dough.  This will definitely become a staple cookie recipe in my house!!!

These cookies were awesome. These were better than any store bought ginger cookies. They were a little sticky but I put some sugar on my finger after rolling them around and just pressed them down as normal. A definite keeper. Great recipe.

Well, my cookies were soft but they didn't have the pretty crackle look that so many of the photos have - mine had a smooth texture. I only subbed 2 ingredients - I made a double batch and used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar and then I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening because I didn't have margarine. I did bump up the spice flavor because when I tasted the batter it was very mild in seasoning. If anyone knows why I didn't get the crackle on top - let me know what I did wrong!

Oh My Goodness.  These cookies are so good. Just made one small adjustment and added  1/2 tsp more ginger and only used brown sugar instead of white.

Perfect as written.  This is my all-time favorite cookie.  I've made them several times now and finally got them to be soft.  I took them out when they still looked under-cooked and then let them sit on the sheet for 1 minute before moving to a cooling rack.

These are very good, however, they are not ginger-y enough for me.  My husband loved them, but compared them to a sugar cookie.  I will make them again, but atleast double the amount of ginger.

can't go wrong with these. next time i'll put in less sugar though, they turned out to be really really sweet. be sure to place them about 1 inch from each other on the baking sheet so they have that nice round shape and don't run into each other! delicious.

So soft, chewy and delicious! I used these for ice cream sandwiches (with dryers coffee slow churned ice cream) and the combo was to die for! My husband loved it! I didn't have ground cinn or cloves so I subbed those spices for Trader Joes pumpkin pie spice and it worked great!  I also made the cookies a little bigger for the sammies.  this recipe is going to be a regular!

LOVED it!  Made it to recipe, except I made sure cookies were very flat.  After baking, it was still very soft and chewy!  The second time, I tried making them thicker and it was still very flavorful, but I definitely preferred the flatter ones.    I also substituted water with OJ like a few reviewers suggested and there was a noticeable difference.

I've always admired my Nanny's amazing cooking skills, so the biggest compliment for me was when she asked me to make her a batch of these because they were so delicious. Chilling the dough made it easier to handle, and I made loose balls with it before rolling in sugar to get the crackle top. They spread quite a bit while baking and I needed an extra two minutes of oven time. Thank you for a very enjoyable recipe!

These cookies are delicious!  I've made them a few times now.  The only thing I would suggest is to put hte dough in the freezer/fridge for a few minutes before you drop onto pan.  It's very difficult to work with unless it's cooled a bit.  Enjoy!

I don't typically even like ginger cookies but my husband does so I made some this weekend.  Well, I've found the first ginger cookie I like!  They're so soft and chewy.  I brought some of them to a friend's house and she wants the recipe and proclaimed them the 'best cookie ever'.  Well deserved ratings!

This recipe was great! I followed the recipe exactly and got delicious, stay soft for days, crinkly ginger cookies.  **Tip: If your oven is old and ancient like mine, play around with the settings. I usually bake everything 25 degrees less than what the recipe says to make sure things do not get over-baked or burnt.

I was skeptical, since ginger tends to throw my taste buds off, but these were delicious! Definitely needs to be chilled before rolling into balls & pressing. I didn't make these during the holidays, but these would be the perfect Christmas cookie.

I made these cookies last night for the first time. Needless to say that they are AMAZING! My sister and best friend were shoving them into their mouths before they were even cooled properly. My boyfriend ate 5 in one shot...I will definitely be making this again! Unlike most people though, I didn't have any problem with the batter - the dough consistency was perfectly. I followed the recipe exactly as it's written and it came out perfectly.

These cookies are AMAZING.  My son requests to make them all the time.  I sent a couple dozen to work with my boyfriend on Christmas Eve and they disappeared before their lunch break. I love that they stay so soft.  They have the great taste of gingerbread but without the crunchiness.  My new favorite!

These disappear in a flash every time I make them!  Although most people (myself included) tend to think they taste more like a molasses cookie, not gingerbread, they're still delicious!  This is a go-to recipe when I need to take cookies somewhere.  Update: I'm notorious for trying to "healthify" any recipe, so I tried these with doing the applesauce/margarine sub (and that's all I did!).  I did 1/2 applesauce, 1/2 margarine, and all I have to say is, DON'T.  Let these cookies be your guilty indulgence.  Make anything else healthy, but leave these as is, they are simply unbeatable.

Exceptional! These stayed soft for the short time they were in the house - they had a habit of being devoured quickly.  The dough was a bit sticky, as others have noted, but some spray helped and the results were well worth it.  I did try to use this recipe in a gingerbread house shaped cookie pan I bought, but the results weren't great.  The cookies lost their soft, chewiness.  I suspect that will be a common problem regardless of the recipe I use in that pan, possibly due to the thickness.  My son didn't seem to care though and loved the shapes.  I'll stick to the round cookies.  Before I forget, they spread well so I found that I didn't need to flatten them - even with frozen dough.

I had never made ginger cookies before.  I made this for my family, doubling the recipe, and we loved it.  The title fits perfectly.  Big soft ginger cookies and they are.

These cookies are wonderful!  I made them for a potluck new year's day party and they went very quickly.  I've also sealed them in a vacuum sealed bag and shipped them to Afghanistan for a friend in the military.  He said that they kept very well and were still chewy when he got them.  The only alterations I make are that I don't skimp on the spices.  I use a whole teaspoon for both the cinnamon and the ground cloves.  Like other reviewers I also substituted orange juice for the water, although either are suitable.  Also, before I assemble and bake them I like to refrigerate the dough for a little while.  This makes it much easier to handle and they turn out better in the baking process.  Great recipe :)  I definitely recommend it!

These are fantastic!  They were soft (and delicious) the first day I made them and I had my doubts about how they'd hold up but they were still chewy several days later.  They are quite addictive so I probably won't make them too often.  I *might* try increasing the spices next time, just to add a bit of a kick.  Like others, I didn't really get the crackle effect either but I don't imagine that there's any impact on the taste of the cookie so I think this is a minor issue.  Thanks for such a great recipe!!

These are absolutely delicious!  Stayed soft and chewy in a container on my counter, makes a lot of cookies so I froze some and after thawing, they still tasted amazing!  I had to stop myself from eating the entire container in one sitting!  So yummy!!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This is a yummy cookie. Even my 2 year old loved it. I brought them to work and the tin was clear in 2 minutes flat and the recipe was emailed out to at least 3 people. A GREAT cookie.

These are the softest cookies I have ever baked. I made a batch two weeks before Christmas and they went fast. So I baked a double batch and they lasted longer and still last one stayed just as soft as the first.  LOVED IT. Thank you

I didn't have ground cloves so I completely omitted that from the recipe...still tasted okay. Since my mom doesn't like things that are too sweet, I reduced the sugar to 1/2 a cup and did not roll the dough in sugar. I also didn't have molasses at the time so I used honey instead. The end result was okay...a bit bland because of the adjustments I made, but my mom liked it and the recipe was easy to follow.

After my first bite, I was not impressed. By the time I finished the cookie, I knew I wouldn't be able to stop at one. These were amazing! Even my boyfriend who doesn't generally like gingerbread couldn't get enough of them.  My changes: I only had 1/2 cup of margarine, so I adjusted the recipe accordingly. I also made the balls smaller, so I still wound up with 24 cookies. I also used whole wheat flour, added a little brown sugar, and added a little nutmeg. The dough was a bit sticky, even after 15 minutes in the fridge, so I followed one reviewer's advice and sprayed my hands with oil. I was then able to handle it with no problem.  These cookies came out perfectly and are a new favorite!

These cookies are perfect. Chewy and delicious. The only change I've made is substituting the tablespoon of water for orange juice, and I usually add a few extra dashes of the spices. Very yummy :) My favourite.

Pretty good but they just seem to be missing something.  I think I will add a little more spice next time.  I put the dough mixture in the freezer for 15 minutes before forming into balls and make sure you flatten them down a little before placing on the tray.  Mine didnt look like the picture at all and were alot lighter in color.  They stayed pretty moist for a few days but I thought they tasted best the day they were cooked and ended up throwing some out after a few days.

Amazing !  I made these cookies and they weredevoured like nothing i've seen before.  My daughter who normally doesn't like any baked stuff I make, couldn't stop eating them.  I had to tweak the recipe alittle coz we don't get mollasses inour part of the globe. I used honey instead.

Delicious. I used Egg Replacement because of a friend's allergy and they turned out great. Will definitely make again.

Yummy! My cookie didn't crackle as the one in the picture, but it was delicious nevertheless. I had to freeze the dough overnight because it was far too gooey to handle otherwise. Next time, I'll try using oj instead of water as others have suggested.

I made this EXACT recipe yesterday and it was PERFECT! In fact, I made over two dozen cookies and only have 5 left!!! They went so fast that I had to make more today and my husband is bringing them to work tomorrow. This is probably the BEST cookie I have ever eaten. Follow the instructions perfectly and you won't be sorry.

It's good, but I was expecting a more strong gingerbread taste.  I might up the spices and molasses the next time. Mine didn't turn out as dark as the photo. I also got 36 cookies out of one batch, not 24, so that was a nice surprise!

These are absolutely the best ginger cookies I have ever made. I made a batch with double the recipe, and it didn't quite turn out - the cookies were good, but they were flat. I tried again and followed the recipe to the letter, and I got PERFECT cookies...perfect shape, size, color, everything. This is now a staple recipe for me!

We just tried these today and they are wonderful. My 7 and 5 year old daughters helped and really enjoyed rolling the cookies in sugar and then flattening them with a glass:) We used whole wheat flour,and had no issues w/ stickiness. I don't know if that is why. This is going to be a holiday favorite of our family.

Delicious!  Soft and chewy and nicely round, though mine were quite flat.  The hubbie's opinion is that I should make these often and not just at Christmas!  These are even better the next day!

This is my second time making these. I made these Thanksgiving 08 and now I have made these for a few Christmas parties as well as gifts this year. They are great and yummy and soft. I love these and I dont think there is a thing you could do to make them better. Followed the recipe as is :)  ~Justine

This is the first rating I have written, though I have used this site for a while.  These cookies are amazing.  I have made them 3-4 times now, and they get better every time.  The dough is sticky, so I put it in the freezer for 20-30 minutes, and coat my hands with and dip a fork in flour to flatten them.  I skip rolling them in sugar.  I go heavy on the spices, and have used orange juice once and water the other times.  That doesn't seem to make much of a difference.  These are the best!!!!

I made this cookies a couple of nights ago.  They were very easy to make.  I followed the directions completely and didn't have any issues with the dough being too sticky or gooey.  However, I could figure out how to make the cookies crack on top.  I will make this recipe again.

These were awesome! Not quite as brown and crinkly as the picture shows (maybe because I rolled the dough into balls), but they taste delicious and stay moist and flavorful. Thanks!

What do you say when you've found just the taste you were looking for, and the texture was incredible?  All I changed was the water to orange juice.  Fantastic job on this recipe!

Rave reviews from the cookie-eaters.  I replaced the water with OJ and put it in the fridge for about 30 min before putting them on the cookie sheet.  I'll leave them in the fridge a little longer next time.

Great recipe!! I made it the other night as part of my Christmas cookie baking. These are yummy, soft and chewy. Great flavor. I did stick the dough in the fridge for about 1 hr before baking. The dough seemed to firm up enough that I didn't have any problem rolling into balls. I would highly recommend these cookies.

These smell wonderful while baking. Unfortunately I had to put a tray back into the oven because it did not cook fully (still pretty soggy). I took the advice of patting them down a bit with my palm (just to make the top a bit flat). They looked beautiful.

Absolutely DELICIOUS. Substituted butter for margarine. I rarely repeat cookie recipes (I always want to try new things), but I think I will have to for this one. I also flattened with my palm.

Oh my GOD, these are so good and so simple to make. I didn't have to beat in the egg, my butter/sugar mixture was soft enough that it made it easier to mix in. Tip: Heat butter at 30% power for a minute to a minute and a half, after cutting it into little pieces. It will make mixing easier, especailly if you have a broken beater like I do. Also, there is no need for the extra sugar in the end, they are fine by themselves. Well, they do make them prettier...

These were absolutely amazing!  And I'm not even a big fan of non-chocolate desserts.  I baked the first batch for 8 minutes, and they were very soft and just barely done on the inside (just the way I like them).  I baked my last batch for 11 minutes to get a really crispy outside, but the inside stayed chewy and moist.  YUM!

I was dissappointed because I expected thick cracked cookies, but got flat cookies. The flavor was delicious, but the appearance was not what I hoped for. I wonder what made them flat? I made two batches and tried to keep the second batch thicker by not flattening them. Still did not work. The recipe does not say to chill dough. Maybe that would have made the difference. I will be trying a different recipe next time.

Amazing!!! I didn't have OJ t follow other reviewers suggestions, but I didn't want to use water either so I used what I had on hand...Apple Cider. I also used blackstrap molasses and yes do chill the dough before rolling into balls. Theses were amazing!!

I just love these cookies!  They have the perfect amount of spice - not too much so they are accessible to everyone.  They also stay soft and chewy (with a bit of a crisp on the outside).  Mine did not come out looking like they do in the picture, instead they looked more like ginger snaps, but they were still delicious.  I will be make these again and again!

Best Cookies Ever! I did like other reviewers and used O.J. instead of water and chilled the cookie dough before shaping it. I was out of eggs when I made them, so I substituted 1 Tbsp. of ground flax mixed w/ 3 Tbsp. of water. You couldn't taste a difference and the cookies turned out perfectly. These are a big hit and my husband was really glad that I came home with some of them left over from the cookie exchange. YUM!

Very good cookie, I to used the orange juice like other reviews recommended but still would like it to be more gingery, so I will try fresh giner next time.  My cookies turned out a little crispy I hope they soften in the airtight container.

The dough was a little too sticky to roll into balls.  I added about 2-3 tbsp extra flour to combat this and also chilled it in the freezer for about 10 minutes which helped a lot.  The recipe tastes really good and

OMG!!!!!!! I've been wanting to make these for a long time and finally. I up the molasses to 3/4cup and it was sticky so I drop them on the cookie sheet and they was soooo good a little flat with no cracks in the cookie but that's fine, still good. I got to make them again one of my favorites. WONDERFUL COOKIES!

This is an incredible recipe.  We had an open house for the local historical society and everyone wanted the recipe!  Instead of rolling in sugar, I prepare a butter/powder sugar glaze and these cookies are an instant hit.

I just took these out of the oven, and I'm already telling my husband to slow down..he has eaten 3 off the cookie sheet, and is eyeballing the ones coming out of the oven in 2 mins...I made these as written and have had no trouble at any stage. I did bake them a little longer though 10 to 12 mins....they look almost  like the picture, maybe a little thicker,, need less to say I will be adding this recipe to my favorites..Thank you

These are easy and tasty and I have had consistently good results with them.  They are exactly as stated in the description and in my opinion a nice change from the standard gingerbread cookie.  Very sticky when transferring the dough to the pan so it's nice to have someone else around to open the oven or answe the phone.  Your hands will be a mess!

these were pretty good on their own, but i used them to make sandwich cookies using the cream filling from "Homemade Twinkies" by Tyler and they were out of this world! They were best when frozen and then thawed, as suggested in the twinkie recipe. half the cream amount is still way to much but you won't complain :)

This recipe is deelish! The dough should definitely be chilled prior to shaping the cookies. I pop it into the freezer for 20 mins before the first batch and then in between batches. I like to do the cookie balls smaller because they are rather rich but I don't flatten them. I find that when they poof up the middle stays softer longer (although they don't last long in my house. I also like to use turbinado sugar (not raw) to coat them.

I make cookies all this time.  They are my favorite junk food.  These cookies were so easy and they turned out perfect on the first try.  I did half my first batch in powdered sugar and the other half in regular sugar.  The powdered sugar made the cookies look like a wintery snowy wonder land, but I'd say next time I will just make all of them as the recipe calls.  The ones rolled in regular white sugar were a little more crispy.  Delicious!

I'm usually not a huge fan of ginger cookies due to their strong flavor but I made them for my husband since he loves gingersnaps. I'll have to say these cookies were amazing! They have a terrific flavor not overpowering. Everyone loved them! Can't wait to make them again.

My husband who has always hated ginger cookies really liked these cookies. The rest of the family likewise gave it a big thumbs up. I substituted 1/2 cup of butter and 1/4 cup of applesauce for the 3/4 cup of margarine.

I had to try these because of the great reviews. I am looking for new recipes to make for Christmas gifts and decided to try this one. I won't be making it again. Perhaps I am just not a ginger cookie fan. They aren't awful by any means, but nothing I will ever crave.

I seen these and thought of ginger snaps, which reminded me of my grandparents home.  I followed the recipe exactly and yes while rolling they were a bit gooey, but once they were cooked the sometimes odd round shape wasn't noticeable, they were perfectly round, just the right amount of spice & delicious, these will definitely be going in my recipe box.

WONDERFUL!  I doubled the recipe, and thought I would have a lot left over.  They were meant to be extra snack food at Thanksgiving.  Not only did half of the people that were supposed to be there not come (and of course nobody told me until the day of!) but I didn't have ANY left over.  The only change I made was to use orange juice instead of water, as suggested.  Delicious!

Although the taste was good these cookies flattened, I was disappointed, I wanted a ginger cookie not a ginger snap. Reading other reviews from molasses cookies though they say to use margarine and NOT butter as the butter will cause the cookie to flaten. I always cook with butter but I am going to try another recipe tomorrow with margarine

I thought these were good, almost too soft though.  My husband absolutely loved them though - hence the five star rating.

Very good cookie, but I was disappointed that they didn't stay soft for more than a couple of hours.  Maybe I baked them too long.  But a quick zap in the microwave cured the problem.

I made these cookies before and the taste was great but they came out very flat.
I made these again (different oven) last week and they were easily the best ginger cookies I have ever made. The oven made a world of difference. They were big and fluffy, and they are still soft after a week! Best cookies ever...all of my friends and family agreed.

They didn't turn out big and fluffy, but definitely soft! There wasn't enough spicy taste for me, so I rolled them in a mixture of sugar and ginger powder to help give it a bit more gingery kick. I will try the orange juice next to see if that helps as per other reviewers.

Great cookie. I was waiting for the same look as the picture, for a walnut size cookie I did not get that, instead more of a ginger snap.  Next time I will make them much larger, because walnut size balls, my cookies after being baked are the size of a silver dollar and still very thin.  Otherwise great cookie with excellent flavor.

We had a couple of dismal failures with another recipe and decided to give these a try for dessert tonight. They were so simple and easy to make. My 9 year olds loved having the job of rolling the balls in the sugar. We made them with orange juice. :)

I made this recipe exactly as written and had no problems whatsoever. I made one batch having flattened the cookies and left the rest of the batches in balls, and the results were about the same. The cookies left in balls came out only a little thicker than those I had flattened, and I had no preference about their size anyway.  I would love to find a way to make this into a gingerbread man recipe because the taste is SO much better! It is a lighter flavor than a gingerbread cookie - not as "spicy". Delicious! I topped with the "Vanilla Glaze" from this site, and everyone loved them and asked for the recipe.

This is a good recipe. Mine turned out to be delicious.  I used lemon juice to replace the water which gave it a fresh twist. However the cookies are flat. Maybe chilling the dough before baking would help.

THE PERFECT HOLIDAY COOKIE!!! I can't rave enough about these cookies! I had never cooked a ginger cookie before and am SO glad I found this recipe. I followed the directions exactly and the result was 4 dozen perfect ginger cookies, all of which were eaten within 24 hours by my family of 5. They were just irresistable!!!

The flavor of these cookies is amazing. BUT...they flattened so much that it actually looked like I had made a wall for a gingerbread house. I am disappointed because I LOVE ginger cookies. I rated it 3 stars because I'm sure I'm doing something wrong. Does anyone have any suggestions to prevent this?

Made these cookies omitting the cloves because my hubby isn't fond of them... They were still wonderful! I had to shoo my guys out of the dough though, or I never would've known what they're like baked. Delicious!

gonna try this review once more (two failed attempts).  I just finished making these for a dessert wedding reception, to make them appear different from other cookies, I added a small piece of candied ginger to the top of the cookie prior to baking. The cookies are very moist and ohhhh so tasty.  I cant wait to "overhear" what the wedding guests have to say.

I used half the amount of butter called for (used butter, not margarine) and I added a dash of vanilla to balance the spice from the cloves. They were great. I have never seen my husband eat cookies like these. I also added a bit more ginger, as I love ginger. They are great and super easy to make.

Oh my!  These cookies are ridiculous!!!  They are so good we can't stop eating them!  The only change I made was (as previous reviewers suggested) to sub orange juice for the water.  I also drizzled the cooled cookies with a simple orange glaze (powdered sugar mixed with OJ until desired consistency).  Delicious!!!

:)  That's all I can say about this recipe. It's a must try! I couldn't believe how chewy and delicious they were. And it's the day after today and guess what? Still soft and chewy! I did not use orange juice, as I had none on hand, but really I don't see how the cookies could get any better! The recipe made about 3 1/2 dozen for me, and yes, rolling the cookies in sugar before manually rolling them really helps. My aunt and mother both ate (combined) about 10-13 cookies in one sitting! I will DEFINITELY be making these again soon.

These are very good but I made the mistake of flattening them and they spread out really thin!  When I left them as balls then they looked a lot better.   I will try the OJ next time.  All in all its a good cookie.

These are a good basic cookie, and they stay soft, however they taste more of cloves than of ginger. I did use the other reviewers suggestions to reduce the sugar and not roll it in sugar (definitely needed! I used 3/4 cup and would reduce it further if I was going to frost these) and to use orange juice instead of water. My spices are new, and yet with all that it still came out horribly bland. Will not be making again without some major adjustments.

all i can say is wow! I have never made ginger cookies before and honestly would rather have chocolate, but this recipie turned me.  This cookies are soft, spicy, and wonderful! I followed the recipe exactly except i found a recipe on vanilla glaze on this site and drizzled that on top so they would look like the picture. They are amazing! I plan on making these for xmas gifts this year!

Terrific cookie. Make sure to really smoosh them down or they'll plump up like a biscuit.

These were not very big but they were very delicious. I made them vegan for a friend...replaced the egg with 1 tablespoon ground flax seed + 1/4 cup warm water. Then I added about a 1/2 cup finely chopped crystallized ginger. I also took the other reviewer's suggestion and replaced the water with OJ. Delicious!!

These cookies weren't for me. The clove was so overpowering that I ended up throwing them away after they baked. The smell alone while I was mixing the batter was too much to handle.

They certainly live up to their name - nice, big soft cookies. While they tasted pretty good, they weren't fantastic. I made exactly as written.

I don't even like gingerbread cookies, but I made these as a trial run for Christmas cookies. I even thought that these were pretty good, nice and soft and sweet; however, I will cut the cloves by half next time. I also made the "vanilla glaze" recipe on this site for the drizzle.

These are fantastic! I followed suggestions and used fresh squeezed juice from an orange instead of water and let the dough sit for half an hour before handling. I didn't have clove so left it out (I dont care for it anyway), and rolled them in sugar. I made snickerdoodles at the same time, everyone was eating the snickerdoodle dough out of the bowl but didn't like the ginger dough. When they were all cooked though.. the ginger cookies were getting eaten far quicker than the snickerdoodles! I will be making these many more times for sure.

I doubled the batch and ended up having to add almost an entire cup of extra flour to be able to handle them.  They were still a little sticky, but baked up perfectly and held a puffy shape when done.  I brought them to work and everyone raved about them.

Did everyone else's turn out flat as pancakes? Still absolutely delicious though. They stay soft, even in the freezer.

Phenomenal.  I didn't have dried ginger but oddly had fresh (leftover from making ginger tea for a cold that I had).  Even better with the fresh ginger but you have to use 4-5 times the amount as the dried.  Very easy to eat the whole batch before the family gets home so double the recipe!

I received lots of compliments on these cookies.  I even enjoyed them, and I'm not typically a ginger cookie type of person.  They do not have an overpowering flavor, and they're soft without being gooey - yum!

I have made this recipe a few times - this time I got distracted and forgot the molasses until after my first pan went in the oven. (I wondered why they were so pale!) The cookies still came out great, just without as much depth-- a little bit like what a ginger blondie might taste like!

So good. I used this "I can't believe its not butter" sorta stuff thats specifically for baking and added a little too much molasses, and they still cake out amazingly. Put a light glaze on some of them, but they're still perfect without it.

I made these for my canasta gals.  I did the OJ substitution for the water.  Great flavor.  I think I'm still in search for the perfect ginger cookie, though.

Good morning I have been wanting to make these for quite sometime now its a perfect fall autumn day so I tried them and I am so happy they turned out perfectly.  I didn't change a thing my dough was perfect I made little balls and barely rolled them in sugar just a tiny bit then pressed gently with a glass and baked them for 10min they are absolutely delicious I hope I can stay out of them long enough to make the frosting I'll just use a glaze thanks again this one will be used a lot during the holiday season.

These cookies are DELICIOUS! I put some cream cheese frosting in a plastic baggie, cut a corner off, and piped on some frosting to make it look like the picture :-) , but it really added to the flavor as well! They are my boyfriend's new favorite!

The taste was great, but my cookies came out more like wafers - completely flat. The first batch, I think I made them too big and flattened them too much. The second batch, I rolled a little smaller and didn't press them down as much. I got the same result. The third batch, I rolled big, barely flattened, and pulled them out a little sooner, but they weren't cooked all the way through.

These cookies are fantastic! I made them as the recipe directs and they are so good. I'm not one to change a recipe and then rate but the next time I make these (soon) I will probably add orange zest and/or juice in place of the water. These cookies remind me alot of Gingerbread Men (doesn't need molasses) recipe on this very site. You can't go wrong with this recipe, it's a keeper and it makes your home smell so good too!

I've made this recipes countless times, and this must be the most perfect cookie in the world. Honestly! Just make plenty; my friends can never eat just one, or even just five. 

A note of caution: I once made the cookie with butter because I didn't have margarine -- big mistake. The taste was *completely* different and the texture was all wrong. Has to be margarine for this recipe.

These are delicious. I used butter instead of margarine. I also ended up using about 1/2 c. more flour than stated as my dough was quite sticky. I flattened my cookies and wished that I wouldn't have. They came out very flat, although that may be due to the altitude as I am in Wyoming.  Great taste and with a little tweeking I know I will use this recipe again!!  Thanks!

I've made these cookies several times now for desserts after holiday dinners and they always go over wonderfully! I omit rolling them in sugar, though, because, in my opinion, they don't need the added sweetness. Great soft ginger cookie, tastes just like a ginger snap!

I just made these and they are fantastic! I don't know why the recipe says it makes 24 cookies - those would be some gigantic cookies! I made 45 out of this recipe and they were fair sized! They taste similar to a ginger cookie from my favourite bakery, except those have raisins and are cut into squares (I think I'll try that in the future.) You can bake them for 10-12 mins for soft cookies or 15 for crispier cookies like gingersnaps. I do half and half!

I made these exactly as written with the exception that I used butter, not margarine (just didn't have any).  These were just lovely.  I pressed them down pretty flat as suggested by other reviews, and they were slightly crispy on the edges, soft and chewy in the middle.  A perfect light flavor.  My kids DEVOURED these and I sent a few dozen into work with my hubby.  Those were gone in minutes.  A truly GREAT recipe.

If I make these again, I will try refrigerating the dough before rolling it--the dough was SO sticky that I was only able to make them using a cookie scoop. I was also concerned because they tasted kind of doughy right out of the oven, but they actually tasted better the next day once they'd firmed up a bit. I drizzled a mildly citrus-flavored glaze over the top, and they were a big hit at work. I'm not sure that there's not a better ginger cookie recipe out there, but these are pretty good.

Just made these!  My house smells AMAZING.  My husband and three year old son LOVE them.  Let's put it this way - I was going to take them to work tomorrow and my husband said, "No you aren't.  I want them!"  Success....  Will definitely use this recipe from now on.  Thanks for a little taste of heaven.

These cookies were awesome.  I don't really like the crunch store bought gingersnaps.  I followed the recipe and felt so grown up purchasing molasses for the first time.  I did squish them down so they looked flat.  I read the reviews but I was still pleasantly surprised at their soft texture a couple days later.

Easy, good, but not my favorite. Recommend making the "walnut" size balls a little bigger, the thick cookies were a lot tastier than the ones that got thin.

These cookies were okay. I don´t think I´ll make these again. My family didn´t really care for them. I also had to completely flaten the cookies before baking. The only positive thing about these cookies is that they stay soft as the title implies.

Good cookie!  I adjusted the spices by reducing the amount of cloves and adding a dash of nutmeg. I also used butter flavored crisco because it was what I had in the pantry.  Cookies were soft and flavorful but seemed a little flat after cooling.  I even extended the cooking time to 11 mins. Overall a good recipe and something I will try again durring the holidays.

The flavor was fine, but I made no changes to the recipe and they would not bake completely.  Left them in for an extra few minutes, but they were still raw tasting in the middle.

These are fantastic cookies!!  The whole family loves them...including a 2 and 5 year old.  I did do a few things differently; I used a cup of whole wheat flour and 1 1/4 cup of all purpose, I added some cinnamon to the sugar when I rolled them and I also put the dough in the freezer before I rolled them into balls.  When I pressed them with a fork they baked out really flat so I just used my fingers to flatten them a little bit and they turned out perfectly!  This is a keeper!  Thanks so much.

I would have given these cookies a 5 for their taste but I gave them 4 stars instead because they didn't come out thick and chewy like the picture indicates. Instead they came out flat and crispy around the edges. I may have to check my oven but these sure are great cookies. Definatly put them in sugar before trying to roll them

These really are good.  I followed the recipe exactly as written except for omitting the final step of rolling the dough in sugar.  I don't like things too sweet.  The came out great!  Soft and tender.  The ginger flavor is present without being overpowering (ginger lovers add more - someone's written about how much more they added).  One review mentioned that the clove flavor was overwhelming but I didn't not find this to be true.  I like the flavor of clove so that might be why I am not bothered by it.   I will try the orange juice substitution next time.  I also want to try adding some pumpkin flavor; it seems like the pumpkin, ginger and clove are a match made in heaven.  Overall, great cookies!

After reading all the great reviews, I just *had* to try these cookies. Now, I have made A LOT of cookies over the years – especially for gifts at Christmas time – and unfortunately, I strongly disagree that this cookie is one of the best I've tasted. Honestly, I wouldn't even put it in my top 20 cookie recipes.   They came out exactly like they were supposed to; I had no issues like others stated with baking or the dough being too sticky. My issue was with the amount of cloves in the recipe. I felt it was overwhelming, even a day or two later after the flavors had a chance to develop. I'm not even sure why they are called "Ginger" cookies; they should be called "Clove" cookies…that’s how strong the taste of cloves is in this cookie! I still tasted the cloves long after I finished eating the cookie and found myself looking for something else to eat just to cleanse my palette.   I think if the amount of cloves in the recipe was decreased by at least half (maybe more, depending on taste) then I would give these cookies an additional star. The soft texture of the cookie was definitely one of the better attributes and perhaps it would be worth the effort after the minor adjustment to the amount of spices.

Simple and delicious. I replaced the molasses with syrup only because I started baking and realized it was soy sauce in my cabinet and not molasses...

Theses are my husband's favorite gingerbread cookies! They are so soft and yummy. However, please note that the dough is much too soft to roll these out. It just won't work.

Bite through a delicate shell into a soft wonderful center. I will make these again. Be sure to refrigerate the dough before baking.

These are just what I hoped they would be. Used a whole teaspoon of cinnamon and 2 1/2 teaspoons of ginger.  Used blackstrap molasses and forgot to substitute orange juice for the water, but they were great anyway.  Next time. . .

These cookies are absolutely delicious. They have enough spicy ginger flavor, like a ginger snap. They have a soft center, and I cook them at the 10-11min. They make a good presentation for plating. Sometimes I give cookies away as gifts and these are wonderfully round in shape. I don't think you need to roll them in sugar. The icing is a nice touch, and you can sprinkle them with raw sugar to add some sparkle and more sweetness if you like. My son who doesn't like molasses, gingerbread cookies really liked these cookies. They have a ginger snap taste.

Awesome!  I followed previous advice in reviews and substituted OJ for water, and instead of margarine I used half butter and half butter flavored Crisco.  I also used half brown sugar and half sugar.  I chose not to ice the cookies.  After rolling in sugar (this & using a cookie scoop eliminate sticky fingers!) the cookies are just sweet enough and they are perfect the way they are!  Definitely a keeper in my household.  I will try the ice cream cookie sandwich with my next batch as per other reviewers.  Thank you AMY1028 for the recipe!

Really good soft cookies!  I just ate 3 right out of the oven - yum!  I had trouble even getting them into balls, even after chilling them, so I just took spoonfuls and pushed them off onto the pan, then sprinkled with sugar and slightly flattened them with the back of the spoon.  I'll try rolling again next time because they could have used the sugar all around - still excellent the way they came out!

These are so good! Beautiful cookies, too! There is something a bit strong(maybe cloves?)in the cookie, will cut down on it next time.  Did half butter, half shortening(always love the texture of these cookies).  The strong spice taste still didn't take away any stars for me!

I was looking for a soft cookie that would stay soft as my aging father can only eat soft foods.  He was so thrilled with these cookies. They stayed perfectly soft. I used orange juice in place of water and set the dough in the freezer for about 15 minutes before rolling into balls. The pressed down cookie balls make for perfectly round cookies. Beautiful and delicious.

I'm giving these a 5 because my kids LOVED them, but I didn't care for the cloves flavor. I will try them next time without the cloves. I chilled the dough and had no problem rolling the dough. They turned out perfectly round and shiny on the top from the sugar.

These cookies are really good except I think I will use less ginger next time. It was quite strong in the aftertaste. I also wouldn't flatten them as much. They look better and taste better thicker. Otherwise, these were great.

These were a big hit with my family. MY brother told me that they were 'almost too good'! I did add some extra cinnamon and about a teaspoon of nutmeg for more flavor. They turned out perfect though- very soft and a lot of spice!

I don't know what I done wrong but I believe my baking soda may have been bad. My cookies flattened out and ran together. It was a total disaster "looks wise" but man, it tasted SO good!! They were chewy and soft and everyone loved them. I will definitely make them again and I will use better baking soda next time!!

Fantastic. Great as is, also nice with the orange juice sub that many here mention. I find the dough easier to work with if I refrigerate it for about an hour. I always use butter instead of margarine. Instead of rolling the balls into regular sugar, I use demerara sugar, which gives the cookies a nice texture and a little extra flavor. I usually leave them plain but I've also made a crem cheese icing to top them which was also great. Perfect recipe, many have asked me for it.

AMAZING! I LOVE THESE COOKIES AND HAVE MADE THEM OVER A DOZEN TIMES. I USE ORANGE JUICE INSTEAD OF WATER AND COOK THEM FOR 9 MINS.

Supersoft and supertasty.  They just came out of the oven so I'm excited to see how they taste tomorrow.  Next time I make them I'll use a bit less ginger. Wish I could figure out how to make the glaze, I tried OJ and powdered sugar but didn't get a good consistency.

I also used orange juice instead of water. And I stuck the dough in the freezer for about an hour before rolling. Great recipe!!!

OK!  So dear Hubby came home from work and proceded to shove cookie after cookie in his mouth!  He stated that 'these were the best cookies I have ever made.'   After reading several reviews, I swapped OJ for the water.  That is the only change I made.  Great cookies!  Easy to make!  Highly recommend!  FOLLOW-UP...I made these cookies and did not have any OJ.  Who would think that ONE tablespoon of OJ would make such a difference!  The best way to describe the lack of OJ is that the spicy flavor of the cookies was not as 'bright'.  SO.....always use OJ while making these cookies. **ANOTHER FOLLOWUP**Since I don't always have OJ in the frig, I use Grand Marnier instead of OJ...works just at well for that little boost of orange flavor!

These always turn out great for me and the people I give them to never go without complimenting them. I always tend to be generous with the spices...this recipe is very forgiving.

Yum! I followed pretty much what the recipe called for. But here are my substitutions. 1) used brown sugar instead of white.  2) used butter instead of margarine. 3) used frozen orange juice concentrate to make the OJ cos I didnt have OJ or fresh oranges at home. Dough was sticky. So I didnt roll it into a ball. Instead I used a tablespoon, dropped it on cookie sheet and sprinkled some white sugar on top before I pressed it down with my palm to flatten. YUMMY! Delicious and easy!

Well, I have to agree.  These cookies are the tops in the spice cookie class.  I just wish she would have share her glaze with the recipe.  I can't seem to find one that dries enough to allow for stacking in our beloved cookie jar.  Thank you for sharing.

I hate gingersnaps... My brother isn't crazy about gingersnaps either, yet we both love these cookies! I followed the recipe exactly. They turned out soft and chewy with crisp edges and a wonderful gingery taste. It took extreme self control not to down a ton of these. I plan on trying them with a tbsp of orange juice instead of water next time like other reviewers have suggested...can't imagine these cookies tasting any better than they already do though.

These are wonderful. I usually double and give a ton away whenever I bake them. I also use the orange juice instead of the water.

Made exactly was written. Hubby gave them a perfect score (and he told me he didnt like ginger cookies, hmmm). Will makeagain for sure! Couple tips I picked up in reviews: I did stick my dough in freezer for about 20 minutes before rolling. It was still difficult to roll in sugar, so I did what another reviewer suggested and just plopped the dough into the sugar and then rolled them. I also sprayed my measuring cup with non-stick spray and the molasses just rolled out, nice! I made 24 cookies, like stated, but they were too big to do in 2 batches. They stuck together. Need to probably do 3 sheets worth next time. I also made sure they were very flat before baking. Thanks for the great recipe!

Very good!  I'm not sure if I added a little more flour, or it was just the impact of using whole wheat flour instead of processed white flour, but I didn't find the dough sticky at all.  The cookies came out of the oven rather puffy, but flattened beautifully on their own as they cooled.  This is a very easy recipe, and the results are delicious!

These really are some of the best cookies I've made! They come out perfect every time..BUT you MUST put them in the fridge for about 30 minutes before rolling them into balls. They come out slightly crispy on the outside and nice and chewy on the inside...just perfect! Once you eat one, you can't stop!

An old family favorite - I've been making these cookies for ages and they're always a hit! I make a double batch, keep the dough in the fridge and have fresh cookies all the time.

I'm not the biggest fan of ginger, but these were irresistable! I also substituted orange juice for the water -- it made the flavors pop.

HOLY COW! These are fabulous. You can't go wrong with this ginger cookie, it's so easy to make and the flavors are superb. Just remember that the cookies don't spread well, so you'll need to flatten them down to almost the size you want the cookie to be. For fun I added chocolate chips to my batter before rolling it in the sugar.

My husband loves these cookies because they are soft & chewy like his mother use to make... The only thing I did different is I rolled them in bakers sugar & placed a walnut in the middle. This recipe is now on my favourite recipe list.An excellent ginger cookie.

I doubled this recipe for a dinner party and they were gone in a flash with lots of compliments!  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great!  I might try a little less sugar next time because I prefer less sweet cookies, but that's just a personal preference.  Great recipe!  Thanks!

I make these exactly as is, except I used orange juice instead of water.  They are delicious.  I roll them in about a one inch ball, flatten them out, and then cook them for 8 minutes. They are so soft and delicious.  My family's favorite. Especially at Christmas time.

Very good.  I used half cup butter and a quarter cup butter crisco.  Also I grabbed the wrong measuring cup so I added 2 and a third cups flour instead of 2 and a quarter and the dough was a perfect consistency, rolled into balls great and cooked very consistent.  Lovely cookies, but my personal preference is for something with a little more "bite" and might try again with some chopped up candied ginger in the dough or a glaze of some sort.  All in all, an excellent receipe.

These absolutely live up to their name! The recipe is perfect as shown, I found no need to change a thing. This is definitely a keeper in my cookie recipe collection. Thanks for the great recipe.

My goodness these are delish. I must have made them a dozen times this winter. I gave a pack of about 20 to a friend and he and his children gobbled them all up in one night. Definitley a keeper.

This recipe was good.  I did omit the cloves and used nutmeg instead-- I am not a lover of cloves in food.  I was glad I did that.  I added a vanilla glaze from this website on top of the cookies after I cooked them.  My kids loved this recipe-- I was pleasantly suprised!

These are awesome!  The only thing, though, is that the batter was so liquidy, there was no way to shape them.  So, I measured them out with a small ice cream scoop & we sprinkled sugar on top.  So soft & moist - our new favorite!

These were amazing. I made a batch, but since I figured two people couldn't eat all these cookies at once, I froze them. They froze well, but they were gone in two days. My fiance actually likes them better frozen.

Amazing cookies.  After mixing the dough it seemed way too runny to make into balls - but I put it in the freezer for 10 minutes and that is all it needed.  They came out great.  The only changes I made was to use 1/2 butter and 1/2 margerine instead of all margerine.  Also I use a small Bulgarian oven, so they took only about 4 minutes each to bake at about 170c.  I took them to a youth leadership group in Macedonia and for many it was the first time they had a molasses cookie - but they loved them - they were gone in minutes.

Easy and MmmmMmmm Good! Be sure to use the tip left by others and coat your hands with cooking spray or oil before rolling dough in your hands, otherwise it's a mess!

These are the best ginger cookies I've ever had.  A friend made them for me about 3 months ago and I HAD to have the recipe.  I've made them about 5-6 times over the last few month and they are simply to-die-for!

This recipe is was excellent.  Just like you said the cookies come out soft and stay that way.  I substituted the 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour with 1/4 cup tapioca starch, 1 cup besan (Chickpea) flour, and 1 Cup Sorghum Flour to make it gluten free as we have several celiacs in the house.  Thank you so much for this recipe.

I loved these cookies. Im normally not a fan of ginger cookies; but these were delicious. I made them and took them into work and everyone LOVED them...i will defintely make these again. I do suggest chilling the dough before rolling them into balls so the dough wont be as sticky...but certainly a keeper!

I bake these cookies very often because my friends and family are always requesting them. One person in particular is a very picky eater who is hard to please, but the first time I put a plate of these cookies on the table while he was over, they were gone quickly!

Amazing cookies -- have made these time and time again, and they never last more than 24 hours!  My recent adjustment to give them 5.5 stars would be:  *** To avoid the stickiness of the dough, I do not add the water, and replace it with 1 Tsp of Vanilla. I also cut back slightly on the amount of butter.

Delicious recipe! My kids LOVE them, what a nice change from Oreos ;) I added 1 tsp of Orange Extract (perfect) and substituted Corn Syrup for the Molasses (didn't have any) Very good cookies!!!

These cookies were very popular.  Soft and chewy.  The dough is very sticky so I made it up and put in the fridge overnight.  They spread out a lot so after the first sheet I learned to give them their space.

This cookies are great tasting, but are very hard to make look like anything but a blob.  Dropping them in the sugar before rolling them helps a lot, but still very hard to work.  Also suggest chilling them a little bit before working the batter.  But overall I would suggest making them.

This is the best ginger cookie recipe.  There's a bakery in central Ohio that sells a cookie like this, and growing up, we always picked them up on the way to the lake...I have tried MANY ginger cookie recipes to duplicate the flavor - this is it!!

I've started making these every Christmas now.  They are superb.  I've used maple syrup in place of molasses and they are good that way too.  Not as gingerbread men like that way.  Enjoy!

I made these for a cookie exchange. I tried to double the batch to save myself some time... they did not turn out as good as the single batch did. I also had to leave the dough in the fridge over night in order to be able to handle them and in order for them to bake nicely. Everone loved them! I had to hide them from my husband or else he would have eaten all 12 dozen that I made!

These came out really flat and kind of greasy for me. I'm sure I did something wrong, but I didn't fancy the taste that much. I might try to remake these and see if they come out better.

I love this cookie recipe.  I make it my own by adding an extra teaspoon of ginger and drop dough into a bowl of sugar which makes it managable.  I gave these as Christmas gifts to about 60 people this year and many people went out of their way to tell me how good they were.  Most people ate all six in one day.

I really liked these cookies, but I don't think they are worthy of a 5 star rating...definitely a solid 4.  I did flaten them out quite a bit as others have suggested, and I cooked them for exactly 8 minutes which was perfect.  They were soft and chewy...

Great Cookie if you use Butter Flovored Crisco as a substitute for the butter. I made them with both and the Crisco helped the cookie to remain 'fluffy' and not as crisp as with the butter. But the flavor both ways is yumdeilicous !!!

My husband actually made these for Christmas and they are wonderful if you like a nice, soft chewy cookie!  The flavor is mild and they stayed soft for as long as they lasted (probably a week and a half with the assortment of cookies that we had). They were exactly what we were looking for in a ginger cookie. Thanks!

Amazing!! I made these for the first time on my youngest daughter's 9th birthday just as an added treat for when she got home from school. One bite and she ran over and hugged me tightly saying "Oh thank you Momma, thank you!" Ever since then whenever I mention baking cookies, she begs that I make them again!!!

DELICOUS!  It was hard not to just eat so much dough that there were no cookies to bake.  We added a bit of vanilla and rolled them in coarse sugar.

I think these have 5 star potential, but mine didn't quite make it. Mine turned out super flat and undercooked. Next time, I will probably have to bake closer to 11 minutes, and I might try adding a little bit of extra flour to tighten the dough up a little.

For me this is the BEST ginger cookie recipe out there. I gave these cookies out as holiday gifts to co-workers and these got the best reviews of all cookies I made this year. I'm not sure how they got these cookies to be of lighter color though, mine turned out quite dark. I added orange juice like other reviewers suggested. I also drizzled them with sugar icing once they were cool. I added lemon juice to the icing and it made for a great combination. Will definitely make again.

Really good cookies, but not enough ginger flavor for me. They tasted more like a sugar cookie. I used part margarine and part butter, only because that's what I had on hand. Dough was a bit sticky, but rolled into balls fine. I also didn't place mine far enough apart on the cookie sheet and they ran together. Didn't matter, they still tasted good! I think I will try adding crystallized ginger pieces to the dough next time and see how they come out!

Nicely spiced and wonderfully soft! I iced (dipped the tops) with the Sugar Cookie Glaze recipe  recommended by some other reviewers and also substituted orange juice for the water in both recipes. I rolled in a mixture of white, red, and green sugars for a "Christmas-y" effect.

I made these for my Christmas cookie trays and my dad called me a few days later to compliment this one cookie out of the dozens of others I made. 

This cookie recipe will replace my other molasses/gingersnap recipe that I usually make around the holidays.

YUMMY!

Good cookies!  Used parchment paper like I always do to make for easy removal of cookies from cookie sheet.  Will make again even though the kids prefer chocolate chip!  Thanks for a good recipe.

Made this with 2 of my children on a snow day.  I did not place them far enough apart and they spread into eachother.  Taste was yummy.

I had to try these cookies because they were on the top twenty list. I can see why they are! They are fabulous! I used butter instead of shortning and I used sorgum instead of molassus. They are wonderful. Next time I am going to use orange juice instead of water to see how that changes the flavor. I highly recommend this recipe. They cookies are not only delicious but beautiful as well!

This recipe was great they were big and soft like the recipe says but I guess the family was overly excited about the taste of them.  They were awesome falvor for ginger cookies but apparently my family doesn't care for them like I do.

The flavor of these was awesome.  I think I put too much butter in mine, so they were extremely flat.  I will make again, and next time I'll be careful to follow the amount of each ingredient.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very Very good. They were gone in two days in my house. The dough was very sticky and I rolled them in sugar first them flattened out. The end result is definately worth the extra step.

Thought I would try these cookies, flavor was good but they came out flatter than a pancake. I will continue to search for the ultimate ginger cookie.

These are yummy!! I needed to bake up some cookies at short notice and these were fast and simple. The first pan I did the cookies spread out quite a bit so on the other pans I didn't flatten them out quite as much. Really nice chewy quality to them, will make again and next time will try the orange juice instead of the water as someone suggested.

I was a little skeptical about the quality of a ginger cookie... they haven't been my favorite in the past and my family doesn't care much for them either. I tried this recipe to make ginger cookies for an xmas gift, and WOW! They're delicious! I thught I didn't like ginger cookies... this recipe proved me wrong! :) Wonderful!

Awesome - can't get enough of these! Be sure not to under or over bake these as they fall a bit if not baked to the right "done-ness".  But even if you do - this cookie is very forgiving and they still taste great (albeit a bit flat!)

Soft, gingery, perfect. I made them exactly by the recipe I am going to ice them with the gingerbread frosting, but they are excellent without it. These will definitely be on the Christmas cookie list from now on. Thanks for the great recipe

These cookies were great and stayed soft.  I made my own brown sugar (1 C white sugar + 2 Tbsp molasses) and I think that added a lot of flavor!

These cookies were AWESOME! I have never baked ginger cookies before so I was not sure what to expect. These were delicious. I know that this recipe was not intended to be a gingerbread man recipe but I took the time to roll them out and cut them. It was a bit more difficult that just dropping the cookies but it was so worth it. Everyone who has tried them has been so impressed. Not only are they cute but they are delicious too. SOOOOO much better the the traditional gingerbread man recipe.

OMG!!! So good. I used bread flour for a chewier cookie.  Substituted water with lemon juice. Used brown sugar instead of white sugar. I also ran out of cloves so used nutmeg, but will try with cloves next time. Amazing cookies. Thank you.

Excellent cookies! Really soft. People have told me that they don't like ginger cookies, then eat one, and rave about how good they are!  They disappeared before the Rum Sugar Cookies in my office. I absolutely love these cookies!

Yum!  I have made these cookies more than a few times, always with success.  I often use orange juice for water and cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup.  I have never found the dough to be too sticky - I roll them immediately after mixing without a problem.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

Great cookies! Because I dont like things too sweet i cut the sugar in half and did 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar...and only 1/2 cup butter (instead of 3/4)

I also replaced the water with orange juice. Very tasty!

Best Molasses cookies ever. I been making the same recipe for years and decided to try a new one.  Got rave reviews by friends. This is excellent.  They baked around 13-15 mins.

I found this recipe and made it last year. My boyfriend and I had just started going out then, and I wanted to make them for him again since they were so good! It took me awhile to find them again this year but it's so worth it! I followed with other people's suggestion with the orange juice and found that that little difference was worth it. They are sticky, so I just dropped them in a little bowl of sugar. I usually add about an extra half cup of flour to help them stay a bit fluffier.

TASTE WAS AMAZING. Its not super spicy from ginger and it was just perfect!! However i have to take a star off for the difficulty when making and the end result. Although it tasted fantastic, the "dough" is not a dough at all. More like a paste so i had to sort of spoon my mixture into the baking sheets - really messy. Also, when the cookies were done, some broke very easily because they were TOO soft. It is a good thing because i just adore soft cookies but it was abit annoying when i was packing the cookies for friends when they would just bend and stick together. No, they're not undone and i did according to the recipe. Anyhow, LOVE the texture and taste. Super tasty and soft/chewy!

I made these cookies for the first time this year to give as Christmas gifts.  They were excellent.  Just the right spice. I've since had friends calling me for the recipe. I always use butter in my cookies to make them moist and chewy.  I live at 7100 feet elevation, so I have to make adjustments to all my recipes and these came out right the first time. For anyone else baking at high elevations, for a triple batch I increased flour by 2 Tablespoons, decreased baking soda by 1/4 teaspoon, decreased sugar by 2 Tablespoons and increased water by 5 teaspoons.  Refrigerate the dough before making the cookies and use a small ice cream scoop for perfectly shaped cookies.  Want an easy way to measure sticky ingredients such as molasses and honey? Check out Wonder Cup, which can be purchased at many kitchen stores. Have a Merry Christmas everyone!

I have to say these cookies were pretty good! They did turn out a little squishy though, so i would say to leave them in for a couple more minutes.

Delicious!  However, I don't know what I did, but with walnut-sized balls, I got just over 3 dozen cookies!  Also, my batter was fairly dry and very easy to work with - no problems there.  The cookies were soft and wonderful - I wholeheartedly recommend this recipe!

I dunno, these were good but not as good as people were writing.  I made mine smaller, so I got a ton of them, and followed the directions except added more cinnamon and ginger, and still I didn't feel it had enough flavor.  They're good, don't get me wrong, they are soft and a little crunch on the outside, but I don't get the huge rave reviews.

Very good cookies.  I substituted fresh grated ginger for dry ground and orange juice for the water.  The dough was way too sticky right after mixing so I put it the freezer for about half an hour.  I baked them for 10 mins. and when they were first pulled from the oven they were puffed up but then quickly flattened out.  Maybe bake them a bit longer so the inside isn't so wet and the crust holds up a bit better?

These cookies are absolutely delicious & easy to make!  I chilled the dough overnight before baking, and the cookies stayed very soft & chewy even days later.  Usually, I only make one batch of cookies for the holidays, but I'm making another round of these as soon as possible!

I made a triple batch of these for a cookie exchange, and they were gone instantly! I refrigerated the dough overnight which made handling much easier. They came out a little flat, but I didn't mind. Maybe using fresh baking soda will help next time. I could see increasing some of the spices, but they're also great they way they are: a little crispy on the outside, but soft & chewy on the inside! Will definitely make again.

I made these around Christmas, and they were so good. Someone was eating gingersnaps the other day and I've been  craving them ever since. I put an orange glaze on them per a review--wonderful.

These were AMAZING!I followed the recipe as is. The only thing that I wasn't sure about is that it personally tasted like there was a little too much clove. But, I tend to have a special sensitivity to the taste of clove. Next time, I think I might half the clove. 
I made a dozen last night and my husband ate 5 that night. I got two, and the rest went to work with him the next day. I plan on making more for a Christmas party coming up.

Wonderful! I am not a big fan of ginger, but I wanted to try something different at a holiday party. I made these cookies as directed and they turned out perfectly. I didn't roll the cookies in sugar and opted to drizzle glaze over the top instead. I also added orange extract to the glaze and it added a nice flavor. Although I made some subtle changes, I'm sure these cookies would taste great if you followed the recipe exactly. Make sure to make an extra batch for home because there won't be any leftovers!

I just finished making these cookies. Fantastic recipe.  I used orange juice instead of water. There's no need to roll into balls or get your hands dirty.  Once mixed, put the mixture in the fridge for about 10 minute.  Put some granulated sugar in a shallow bowl. Drop by teaspoonfuls into the sugar and roll. Then place on a cookie sheet and slightly flatten when the bottom of a cup.  9 minutes in the oven and they're perfect.

These had a great flavor but mine fell and I'm not sure why.  They tasted good but they weren't as pretty as I wanted them to be.  They are really good with the vanilla glaze recipe.

I made a few dozen of these cookies for gift baskets last year at Christmas. Even the people who usually don't like gingerbread or ginger cookies, loved them! Everyone said they were their favorite cookie of the season! So I am making them again this year for gifts & in my cookie swap! 
The cookies are easy to make, very comforting (warm out of the oven is best) & smell amazing!

This is our families all time favorite cookie and I can not possible say enough about this recipe. For those of you having a hard time with the consistency after mixing the ingredients try putting it in the refrigerator to help firm it up a bit. As far as rolling it out like someone suggested I wouldn't waste your time. I use one of the small ice cream scoops and drop them on to a silicone pad and they all come out the perfect size and shape. Seriously I don't know how you can improve on this recipe it truly is the best I have tried. I can not thank the person who shared this recipe enough!!! ~D

These cookies are fantastic and will definitely go into my permanent recipe file!  The entire batch was gone the next day.  I made the recipe exactly as written, and although the dough was a little sticky and difficult to handle, everything was worth it when the cookies came out of the oven.  Thank you!

The only thing missing from these was the icing. I wish I would've thought of that before I made them! They were a perfect consistency and flavor, but I wish they would've had just an extra zing of sweetness! Otherwise, tasty FOR SURE!

I admit I was a little worried about them when I saw how loose the dough was after mixing everything.  It was definately not a consistancy that would work for rolling in sugar, so I just did them as drop cookies from a tablespoon (I don't have the patience for chilling dough).  They came out perfect and delicious!  I will make a change next time to at least double the clove, I like my ginger cookies with a bit more bite.

The texture was great as was the flavour but will add a lot more ginger next time. It was more of a spice cookie- very nice but not super gingery-which is what I'd like- but will make it again as the softness was just right!!

These cookies are wonderful!  I made them exactly as the recipe states, and they were a huge hit at work and home.  I even used them in my holiday cookie care packages I send out to friends and family we don't see around the holidays.

Wonderful! I made these cookies exactly as the recipe stated. They came out with such a great texture. Slightly crisp around the edges and soft and chewy throughout. My boyfriend ate 10 straight!

These were great. I didn't experience soft because I decided to try our cookie stamp on these - took them out of the oven and stamped them, then put them back in the oven for a few minutes. They were flat, but the top got glazed because of the sugar and the taste must have been just as good as if I had left them alone.

Absolutely one of THE best cookies I've ever made.  I made them on Thanksgiving day, another batch yesterday, and another batch today.  They are so soft and delicious!  Great with milk.  A super easy recipe for the holidays.  Makes your whole house smell like Thanksgiving/Christmas.  YUM!!!  I plan on making some as Christmas gifts this year.

I am new to baking. These were pretty easy, and they turned out fabulous. Everyone loved them. I did use orange juice instead of water. The dough was a little a runny, so I had to stir in some more flower. Then I refrigerated over night. Used a 1 tbs spoon and scooped them up to drop in sugar, then dropped them on the cookie sheet to bake.

These were easy to whip up.  I loved how they stayed soft and the spices were great.  I might even up them a bit next time.  Also, when I make them again I will decrease the butter by a couple of tablespoons though.  Over all, liked them enough to make again.

These are definitely one of the best cookies I've had.  I've made them twice now.  The only thing I did differently was use blackstrap molasses instead of regular, because that was all I had.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as is.  I found the dough only slightly stickier than other cookie dough recipes where you're rolling them in your hands.  I didn't refrigerate the dough before-hand and it was still fine...you just have to be a little more gentle when you're rolling them.  I've always loved the Archway brand molasses cookies, because they were so soft, and have been trying to find a similar recipe for a couple of years now.  I've found it, although these are way better!  I'm definitely adding this to my favorites, and I will definitely be making lots of these in the next couple of months...it's already a family favorite!

They were good, they just turned out a bit too cakey for ginger cookies I think.  I'll try flattening them more next time.

This is exactly the recipe I've been looking for. The texture is just perfect. Soft, yet chewy around the edges. I took some of the other reviewers' suggestions and chilled the dough for a bit and also flattened them before baking. I was also quite generous with the spices and molasses and added some allspice and nutmeg in addition to the other spices. I used brown sugar because that is what I had on hand, and it worked wonderfully, though next time I think I'll try with white just to see how much that changes things. As always, I used butter instead of margarine.  I'll definitely be making this recipe over and over again. Yum!!

AlthoughI certainly wouldn't classify these cookies as "big" they are very good. They were a huge hit at a party. I did take others' suggestions and substituted the water with orange juice. That was it. They were great. Thanks for another keeper!

Great flavor, stays chewy for days. However, my cookies turned out flat - which would be perfect for ice cream sandwiches. I just prefer ginger cookies that stay thick and fluffy.

They taste alright. I followed the directions and didn't change a thing.  Mine didn't puff up very much...actually came out pretty flat. Thought it was my dark pan, so I used an airbake pan...didn't make a difference. Won't make again.

Good. I like my ginger cookies a little more snappy, but the person I made them for loved them exactly as they are. Maybe it's my oven, but 8-10 minutes wasn't quite long enough.

Nothing spectacular about this cookie.  I made it because it was in the top 20 and I had tremendous success with the cinnamon rolls.  I had no problems making it, I just think the cookie is very plain.  I think it must have gotten it's high rating from the ease of making and, possibly, people who just love ginger.

I was drooling when I made these...the spicey smell is incredible.  Sure, they were a little sticky, but once you drop them into the sugar they coat up nice enough to roll.  I, too, glazed these with icing sugar glaze and sprinkled with tiny orange pumpkin sprinkles for Hallowe'en this week! (Hallowe'en is Friday, today is Tuesday...hmmmm...might have to make another batch before then as I don't think this batch will last that long!)  Thanx for an outstanding cookie recipe!  LUV 'EM!!!!!

I made these cookies last night and they were the best cookies I've EVER made! I want to make more tomorrow. I followed the recipe exactly what was written and it was perfect, I wouldn't change a thing. Plus it left this wonderful ginger and cloves smell in the house. I can't wait to make more!

HOLY good!!!  These cookies are AMAZING.  I made them a couple weeks ago and my fiance & I polished them off in like 3 days.  I just made them again tonight and made one tiny change:  instead of water, I used orange juice, and it really brought out the ginger and spices.  These cookies are awesome!!  They are sure to be a big hit at holiday parties.

Pretty awesome!! My family loved these cookies, and this is the first time I made anything like this, they did say that it was a bit too "spicy" so I may cut back on the cloves next time,and drizzle them with a thin glaze, I did put large sugar crystals on them, but I didn't care for the crunch too much and I will back them longer than the 10 min. This is a great fall cookie, it's a keeper in my book!

These cookies are phenomenal.  My 3 1/2 year old daughter and I made them today.  We also found the dough to be soft and sticky, but I chalked it up to the fact that I used butter flavored crisco instead of margarine.  When using crisco, you have to add water, which I did.  I also added the water required by the recipe.  I thought that is why it was sticky.  I tried the cooking oil on hands trick, but this stuff was just too sticky.  The first batch was too flat.  I added about 1/3 cup more flour then the dough was fine to work with.  The rest of the cookies are perfectly puffy and soft and chewy.  We love them!  Will make again and try the OJ.

This cookie was really tasty and full of flavor! I've never really liked ginger cookies but this recipe really made me change my mind :D I skipped the cloves and added extra cinnamon and a little nutmeg. Then I followed other users' advice on adding orange juice instead of water. I didn't have grounded ginger so I used grated fresh ginger and it worked very well. I also didn't have molasses but I substituted it with 1/4 cup mix of honey and brown sugar. I also put the dough in the freezer so it wouldn't be so sticky and hard to work with. I found the cookie a little difficult to take off the cookie sheet so I baked them on wax paper at 375 for 10 minutes. Despite all the substitutions, the cookie is a delight in every bite!

These are lighter and less taste of molasses than typical, but that makes them even more delectable!  Everyone loved them and gobbled them up.  8 min. was just enough to leave them soft. I'm sure they would have been soft for a few days... they just didn't make it that long!

These were yummy. I definitely tweaked it. I doubled the spices and used butter instead of margerine. I did not have any white sugar on hand so I substituted with brown sugar which I think worked better because it feels like a better fit for ginger cookies. I also forgot to add salt and baking soda and guess what? they still came out soft and poofy! I also did not roll it in sugar before baking. I baked it as is and made a powdered sugar and milk glaze to drizzle on the cookies after they cooled. I just added powdered sugar to 2 tblsp. milk and once it was at the correct consistency I drizzled over cookies. The result: BIG SOFT GINGE COOKIES!!! These are a keeper! Thank You!!!

Quite tasty! Mine came out flat, but I used butter maybe that's why (?). They still were yummy. I will reduce the sugar next time, to get more of the spice flavor. Perfect for fall.

really delicious. They even get soft again after freezing! I did not have any cloves, so used tea masala spice and the cookies were so scrumptious. Definately the best ginger cookies I've made. Easy too! Thank you so much!... A few years later: I STILL love this recipe, as is, no alterations necessary. I have found that subbing butter for margarine, part whole wheat flour, sea salt, and unrefined cane sugar yield the same excellent taste and texture while being healthier for the body. THANK YOU!!!

Wow! I was impressed by the 1000+ 5 star reviews and this recipe lives up to the hype. Really tasty, moist and perfectly spiced. Not too sweet either. Kids and husband loved them!
Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

These were really good!  I did get the peanut butter consistency for the dough.  My daughter and I formed them into balls the best we could.  First batch we did flatten with a glass, second batch we didn't, and it really didn't make a difference, they still spread out.  Great flavor and nice and chewy!  The whole family loved them.  Thanks!

These are excellent cookies.  I followed the recipe exactly except used OJ instead of water as other reviewers suggested.  Next time I'll double the recipe.. I got about 30 cookies.. but that won't last long with boys in the house.

Great biscuits bit a little too soft.  We enjoyed more when cooked again after cooling.  This made them more crisp.  Made them twice and will do so again.

Another 5 stars to the list!  I halved the recipe and it was still amazing!  (Don't ask how I got 1/2 an egg.. it was difficult).  I followed recipe to the T, except I used powdered ginger and didn't use clove, (because I didn't have any).  WONDERFUL!

I made these last night because I was in the mood for cookies, but not the typical peanut butter, chocolate chip or oatmeal. Plus, I knew I had all of the ingredients already in my pantry. They were not only simple to make, but came out deliciously. I added more molasses than was called for and just added more flour to thicken the dough up as well as played with the spice amounts some. They are soft, full of flavor and were instantly a hit. I will absolutely be making these again and again and again.

OMG~ these are soo good! awesome from the freezer too, or left on counter overnight, got softer. So addictive, hubby loved them. I've tried these 2x so far. 1st time followed exactly, came out perfect. 2nd time, was in a hurry, so just dropped them onto the cookie sheet, sprinkled w/sugar, no need to flatten, bake out nicely. Also on 2nd time used suggested fresh OJ instead of water, soo Good, Thanks!

Great recipe. Very simple to make and quite quick too! Like other posters suggested, I added more spices and a little bit of vanilla. They disappeared immediately. Will certainly make again and again!

Very good. I chilled the dough and squashed half down with a fork like peanut butter cookies.  The squashed ones were crispy and the unsquashed ones were soft.  Both are gone!

Sorry to say I didn't really care for this cookie.  Followed directions and while they were okay, I have an old stand-by scotch cookie that I prefer much more than this one.  The tastes are similar but the texture of this cookie was very cakey.

These cookies taste good and stay soft...almost soggy after storing. However, they didn't look at all like the cookies pictured in the photo. They were flat and pliable in texture, instead of soft and puffy, (sort of bends rather than breaks) which is not what I had expected from the photo. I did follow some suggestions from other reveiwers though (orange juice instead of water, more ginger, and more flour). Maybe next time I will follow it exactly and see what happens. In all fairness, this review is written not for this recipe, but for the "modified version" of it.

I'm surprised after reading such raving reviews that I did not enjoy these cookies.  The only substitution I made was using light butter instead of margarine...and I think that's what went wrong.  The dough was so soft that it was impossible to form it into balls.  After baking, they were very thin and hard.  They had a decent taste, albeit slightly bland.  I would add more seasoning next time.

Basically, DO NOT USE LIGHT BUTTER!  I hope to try this recipe again at some point because I'm sure the cookies were supposed to come out better than mine did.

Very good! It didn't stay soft but maybe because I made it into ginger snaps size. In any case, the taste was perfect. Thanks!

These have become my favorite cookies. I try to only make them around holidays, but I find myself baking batches in the summer as well. They stay soft; and in my opinion taste the best after sitting in an airtight container for a few days. I added a small amount of cloves and cinnamon to the sugar before rolling the cookies for a extra sparkle and yummy taste.

I thought these were awesome.  I have made them several times.  The last time I used non hydrogenated margarine and the dough was a little soft so i put it in the fridge for a bit before rolling but the taste was still great.  Don't overcook or they get had and dry.  Nice spice combination.

These were the best ginger cookies I have ever made.  The dough was very soft so I put it in the fridge for a 4 hours and then baked them. I had to bake them longer as the dough was so cold so next time I will let them come to room temperature.  I will also double the recipe!

These cookies are massive when they come out of the oven! I used organic cane sugar(3/4 C) and organic spelt flour for these cookies. I also sandwitched them with some preserves to make jam jams. Great recipe!

OH MY GOSH, these are sooo good!  Only changes I made were butter instead of margarine, 3/4 c sugar, fresh ginger instead of dried, lemon juice instead of water (didn't have OJ) and a dash of cayenne.  I'm keeping this recipe, and pulling it out again at the first sign of cold weather!

These are delicious! I used the OJ as others suggested, otherwise followed the recipe as directed. The cookies are tasty, soft and chewy. Easy to make, too. Mine needed about 10 minutes in the oven. Will make again.

I was craving ginger cookies one day so I searched for a recipe. I made these and LOVED them! They are so soft and chewy and were really ginger-y. My husband loved them too, which is the ultimate test for my picker eater. Will make again and again...and again!

These are sooooooooo good!!!  These remind me of Christmas; they're chewy, moist, sweet, and slightly spicy.  If you make them the size of oreos you get a ton.  The only bad thing is that they are so good you can't stop eating them. :)  Try putting a cream cheese filling in between to make a sandwich cookie.

Turned out great. 
I used the OJ as suggested and split the sugar w/ 1/2 white and 1/2 brown.
Thanks for the recipe.

Soooo tasty!!!! These cookies sounded like they'd be great for around the holidays. The recipe and reviews sounded so good that I made them now even though it's May. 
They are wonderful. I will make them again!

These were just great! My hubby's new "favorite"  I did use butter instead of the margarine and loved the flavor.  Wondering if I could double the recipe successfully? they went too fast!

I'm not a huge fan of ginger, but these turned out very good. I didn't roll them or add sugar in the end because the mix didn't make it feasible to do so. I just dropped a teaspoon in the pan. I had no cookie sheets, so I used a glass pan and two metal ones that come with your oven. All were ungreased. The cookies in the metal pan burned, the ones in the glass pan took a bit longer to bake, and the ones in the other metal lined with foil turned out perfectly. Will make again.

My only complaint on these is that you have to make a really big batch if I want to take them anywhere because I eat so many as they are cooling. We had some friends over and I was making these to take to work and had to restart and make another batch because our friends (and us, to be fair) kept eating them as we were catching up. These definately are close to Best Cookie Ever.

These cookies truly were some of the best ginger cookies I've tasted. I'm not sure where the "BIG" comes in though. Mine were just the average size. I also used the orange juice instead of water. I think it's very important to note that the dough should be refrigerated before forming into balls. This type of cookie always needs this step, and it might have been an oversight. These stayed soft right up to the end (which wasn't too long). Truly a keeper!

These were easy to make, my 5 year old son and I baked them together.  They are DELICIOUS.  I love ginger cookies that are a little stronger and these were wonderful.  I will make these again for sure.

These were sooo good! did not last in my house at all.  I will make this a regular cookie but next time I'll leave the 1 tbsp water out. It was too soft to handle (I live in a very warm climate) just spooned them onto the cookie sheet and they still turned out fine.

Excellent recipe and absolutely the best ratio of chewy, spicy, and ginger-y. I will try the recipe again using a bit more flour to make them a bit thicker. I used a cookie scoop and didn't flatten them but they still turned out super thin (still tasted great, though). That's the only reason my rating is 4 stars instead of 5.

I had no problem with stickiness - in fact, just the oppisite! I followed the recpie and substituted the water with orange juice, however my dough came out pretty dry. I'm guessing it's because it was a very dry winter day in Minnesota. Regardless, I put my hands in some water and mixed the dough by hand. It bounced right back! These cookies are so amazing. They maintained their chewy softness for days! Still, I'm not sure how long they hold because they vanish so fast! The orange juice is a must.

Very delicious.  Nice ginger taste, and very soft.  Just the way I like them!  I cooked them a tad less--7 minutes, and they were nice and soft still.  I greased my hands with oil to help me roll the cookies; otherwise, they were sticking like crazy.  I also used more like 3 tbs of sugar, not 2.

I love bakingup mystery sweets for my family to test and this one stood out.  I did however substitute 1/4 cup of brown sugar for molasses...i'm not a huge molasses fan.  I also left them in the oven for a few more minutes so time ran between 10-13 minutes.

My mom decided when I told he what it was that she didn't want anything with ginger in it but after it was made I 'forced' her to taste one.  She loved it!  They're the perfect combination of light, moist, delicious cookies with just the perfect amount of sweetness and spices.  Dad and my sisters agreed.

My family can't get enough!  I made then a day ago and they're almost gone already!

OMG!! This cookie rocks. I followed the recipe exactly. I am still baking them and had to "sample" one from the first batch because they smelled so good. This one's a keeper.

The other reviews say it all, a wonderful cookie. I love how the sugar coating makes the outside nice and crisp while the inside is soft. They stack well in a cookie jar.

These cookies are absolutely awesome.  I've made them three times now and they are loved by all 5 in my house and by friends that ate some at our super bowl party.  Follow the directions EXACTLY and you will love them. Be sure not to bake them too long. Thanks for the recipe Amy.

I wish I could give this ten stars!!! This is the best cookie recipe I have ever made. I love gingerbread cookies, but have never been able to create a good cookie, and this is just perfect.  I have a batch in the oven right now, and I can not wait to eat more.  I am taking them to work today, so I will update later how they went over there.

These cookies are incredible. I'm no chef, but they're fast, easy and taste fantastic - even days later (if they survive that long, of course). They're fast becoming my family's favourite. Brilliant recipe, thanks!

This is the best ginger cookie ever.  Great with a cup of coffee or tea!!  I have tried every soft ginger/molasses cookie recipe I could find, but this is THE recipe I will forever use.  Reminds me of the bakery cookies my dad and I  would pick up at the small town grocery on the way to spend an
afternoon "fishing".

My cookies were also flat but then I had realized the butter had been out too long. Next time I will be using cold butter and see if that raises them a bit.
Otherwise the taste is excellent. I did substitute the o.j. instead of the water.

These cookies are so fabulous. I made them in advance and froze them for christmas but of course those little (and big) hands found them. They were still soft after being frozen. I made many batches during the holidays because they were asked for again and again. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Yum!  These cookies were delightfully simple to make and delicious to eat.  I made them with my 10 y.o. son just this morning.

I was worried for a time though.  After mixing the ingredients, it looked like a dry mess.  Fortunately, when I worked with it, it molded to make a fair-sized cookie and when it was out of the oven, it tasted excellently.

I can hardly wait for my husband and youngest son to come home and taste them.

These cookies came out perfect - not flat at all.  The only changes I made to the recipe was using unsalted butter and making teaspoon size cookies.  I had several compliments on the cookies and was asked for the recipe by a few people.

Nothing like the picture, they were tasty but flat. Mixed reviews on taste, people either LOVED them or were indifferent to them. I chilled the dough before rolling them into a ball and then popped the balls into the freezer in hopes of creating a more attractive product. They did look a tad better. I think they need a little more flour, perhaps 1/4 to 1/2 a cup. I’m surprised they have such high reviews due to the mass numbers complaining about the appearance.

This recipe was really successful, I just didn't know that I don't like gingerbread! I didn't have any cloves, so I'm not sure if that made much of a difference or not, I've never had cloves so I don't know! Very easy to make, sticky but managable.
Also, I used half ground ginger, and half fresh grated ginger, and I used orange juice with the smallest splash of water because margarine has more water in it than butter, and I used butter.

I just made these and they are perfect.
Very soft inside and not too spicy. 
I used butter instead of margerine was the only change I made. I just noticed the first batch is gone.  Why cant the kids wait.

These cookies are absolutely deeelicious!! The only change I made in the recipe was that I used butter instead of margarine. 

If you like a soft and chewy ginger cookie, you certainly won't be disappointed with this cookie. It has the right combination of spices, (including cloves, which I dislike).

This cookie is easily in my Top 10 Favorite Cookies.

These are great cookies! They still are not what I am looking or though. My husband and I LOVE LOVE LOVE ginger cookies and the spicier the better. These are good for that but not the best. I added cloves, cinnamon and in addition to the powdered ginger, I added fresh ginger root. I will say that after a day of sitting, the fresh ginger begins to show a bit more. My search continues for the spiciest ginger cookie!!!

Wow! This recipe is the best ginger cookie recipe in the entire- and I mean the ENTIRE world!! I was pressed for time so I whipped up this batch of my hubby's favorite cookie while our baby napped. Not only was this recipe easy but tasty to boot! I took the suggestion of another reviewer and used 1 TBL of OJ and I didn't roll them in sugar (I already feel guilty about my daily sugar intake) and they turned out perfect. I forsee makies these again and again. Thanks for sharing it.

These are really good.  Very soft and chewy.  But mine were super-thin and not as puffy and crackly as the picture.  I ran out of all-purpose flour and had to use cake flour.  Then I didn't have quite enough cake flour, so I had to add in some self-rising flour!  But they still came out great and I gave most of them away for Christmas.  I do think they're much better the next day than right out of the oven.  Yum!

Soooo Good! I was looking for a soft ginger cookie recipe and this one is a definite keeper. Used butter instead of margarine, cookies didn't really puff up but were still soft and chewy with just the right amount of spice. If you're looking for just one cookie recipe to make this holiday season, this is the one!

These are really good.  I made them exactly as the recipe, except I used butter straight out of the fridge.  I also refrigerated the dough for at least an hour before I baked them.  They turned out big and soft.  The only way to improve on these is to dip them halfway into some melted white chocolate.  Divine!

I made a batch of these yesterday and they were delicious, but very flat and unappealing looking. So, I tried them again today, using butter instead. They still aren't as puffy as the picture, but they look normal at least now. I did replace the water with orange juice, also. These are amazing... the taste is to die for!

Delicious cookies and so easy to make. It delivers what it promises-- soft, yummy ginger cookies. Perfect for winter! The combination of spices is just right--festive but not too overpowering. The only thing I changed was the amount of sugar. One cup is too sweet for my taste (plus you would want to roll them in sugar later to get that sparkly effect.) Try a little less than 3/4 cup of sugar and use butter. The orange juice is a good idea too. I found the consistency of the dough easy to work with and the cookies turned out wonderful!

So far so good! 2nd batch baking right this second. Easy recipe. I used butter instead of margarine and went with a whole teaspoon of cinammon. Mine flattened a bit more than I wanted, but not too flat, they are still soft and chewy. Nice recipe, some ginger cookies are too spicy for me but this is nice and sweet.

These were better after they sat for a day or two, as the spices mellowed together.  They're very much like soft gingerbread men in taste.

Great recipe, I love this one and make it often.  I usually add a bit more cinnamon & ginger, just for more flavor.  Awesome cookies, also great with a bit of simple frosting on top.

These cookies are great! I've been using this recipe for the last 3 years now and my family loves it. I do usually put the dough in the refridgerator for a good 20 to 40 minutes to let it harden and to make it easier to handle. I put it back into the fridge after filling a baking sheet. Also, if you wait until it's really chilled and roll it out with a little extra flour... it makes the BEST gingerbread men cookie cutouts.

Absolutely delicious. I can't stop making these things. I definitely recommend subbing orange juice for water. They are really gorgeous when you roll the dough in raw/coarse sugar before baking, and they stay delicious and chewy (if you don't bake them too long). The perfect cookie for this time of year because of the spice, and also the color!

Yum, yum, yum!  I just made these cookies today, and they were a complete success!  My 20 mo. old helped me, and scarfed up a cookie when we were done.  I have to say, I have never had a lot of cookie success.  These came out absolutely beautiful, and they made 24 cookies...exactly what the recipe stated!  That was a first for me.  Anyway, they were delicious.  I didn't have any margarine and had to use butter...came out great.  Thanks for such a delicious and beautiful cookie!  Definitely adding to the stash.

WOW!  I read all the reviews and had to try for myself.  I used the orange juice as suggested, and regrigerated the dough for a couple hours, and had no problem handling the dough as directed.  It's true that even people who turn their nose up at ginger love these.  This time I made them smaller (like a teaspoon) and they baked in 9 minutes.

I followed this recipe exactly. No substitutions - no OJ, etc..  The taste is good however, like some other reviewers, mine came out flat as a pancake, or even flatter!  Like a wafer..  I am on the fence if I am going to add them to my Christmas tins I am handing out.. everything else I have made from here turned out excellent..  this is my first disappointment.  I just prefer a thicker cookie, not a cracker like cookie.

I hate to be the voice of dissent here, but from all the rave reviews I had thought that these cookies would be mind-blowingly good, instead they weren't too much different from any other gingerbread cookies that I've eaten. I must have made the balls of dough too small as well since I ended up with three and half dozen cookies. The measurements were very odd too, 2 1/4 cups and flour? And what am I going to do the half stick of butter that's left over? Don't get me wrong, the cookies are good, just not anything to write home about.

Great cookie, easy to make and eat. I would have given it five stars, but it could have been a bit more gingery for me. Everyone else in the house liked them as is though. Thanks for the recipe.

These are wonderful! When I told my family I was making them they all moaned and groaned and I thought I was gonna have to eat them all myself.  But I was lucky to get any of them once they tried them! They were gone in no time and I found myself making more. Thanks for an awesome recipe!

I can't believe how fast these cookies went.  I baked them for Thanksgiving for my in-laws.  My in-laws do not eat any sweets but they couldn't keep their hands off them.  I've gotten requests to make extra for Christmas.

Great cookie recipe. I used the orange juice, like others had suggested. I also added some freshly grated nutmeg.

Wow! Great recipe thanks for sharing. Delicious! I have made them twice now and have added them to the list of cookies I make for my friends and family for Christmas. I made them a little more festive by omitting the roll in sugar and instead I lightly glaze them and sprinkle green and red edible glitter on top. The best cookies ever.

I just love this ginger cookie! It is soft and perfect. I made 36 of them for a cookie party tommorow and they are sure to be a hit. My fiancee loved them and he doesn't normally like ginger cookies. Needless to say, they are disappearing fast. One tip: to refrigerate the batter for 1-2 hours before rolling into little balls. It is less gooey then.
A MUST Holiday Cookie:D

Really GREAT cookie!  But baking them is not an easy task - thoroughly chill the dough before trying to roll.

I've never made Gingerbread cookies before... but nobody at the office noticed when I brought them in! Everyone says they are/were amazing! I didn't press the balls down, substituted butter for margarine and OJ for water. I also took them out of the oven before they looked completely ready. Perfect. A little crispy on the outside but moist and chewy on the inside. 

The pumpkin dip mentioned in several of these reviews did NOT go over so well, though. I might suggest a cream-cheese frosting.

These cookies are the bomb! They have a wonderful subtle flavor (not a huge bite), are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Yum.

It's so yummy that even my 2 boys, who don't like ginger, ate them all !! btw..if you moist your fingers before rolling the dough just like when we make sushi, there will be no mess :)  I'm sure will bake them for X'mas gift.  Thanks for sharing.

AMAZING!! I followed suggestions from others, and they turned out so great!  They were gone very quickly.  My husband loves them and my kids too.  I used milk, instead of water.

I put them out for my co-works 15 minutes ago and have already had people from other departments coming by because they heard about them! I used the T oj instead of the water and baked about 12 minutes per batch so they would be a little crunchy. I do recommend making the balls a little smaller as the cookies do spread out quite a bit. W/ the smaller balls you get about 3 dozen cookies.

This recipe was so delicious, absolutely  addictive.  You cannot stop eating them.  My only problem is that they did not rise.  I saw some of the other pictures of this cookie and they looked so good, any thoughts on how to make them rise properly.

These cookies were indeed delicious. My cookies came out a bit flat, but I think that was my fault and not this recipes! I also whipped up the easy pumpkin dip that a previous reviewer had mentioned, and that gets 5 stars in my book! It really made the cookies. I will keep this recipe for years to come.

The cookies turned out perfect! I followed the advice from others: OJ, 1/3 C molasses, chill before rolling, didn't flatten. I added 2/3 Cup of white chips which is a nice contrast to the spicy cookie. They are delicious and stay nice and soft.

These are awesome.  They are officially my new favorite cookies.  This is the first review I've ever written simply because these cookies are so great.  The only thing I changed was to use real butter instead of margarine.

I'm glad I rerad some of the reviews first.  I substituted orange juice for water to bring out the ginger flavor.  I made these cookies yesterday and they are quite good, however, I'm used to a slightly sweeter cookie.  These were great with my mug of tea as I like to dunk my cookies.  Next time though, I will add 1/2 cup sugar for a sweeter cookie, but also keep the original recipe for those times when my sweet tooth isn't as strong.

The best cookies for the holiday season! I made the following changes: substituted the orange juice for water and butter for the margarine, added an extra 1/4 cup of flour, added a 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg and froze the dough for about half an hour before baking for exactly 9 minutes.  The dough wasn't sticky at all! And the cookies came out perfectly. So soft and chewy in the middle and sweet and crunchy on the outside. I did mix in a little Sugar in the Raw and cinnamon to the rolling sugar mix. Fantastic!

These cookies are SO good.  I used orange juice rather than water as suggested in a few other reviews.  They come out soft and chewy and stay that way for days (if they don't get eaten first).  I made a double batch and froze half of them to take for Thanksgiving dessert.  Everyone who tried them thought they were great.

These were pretty good!  Husband thought they tasted like pumpkin cookies, but I believe it's just the combination of spices he was tasting :-)  Cookies stayed moist and soft for days.

Oh wow, these are SO good... I multiplied the recipe, and then added a little more of the spices than what was required. Sugar cookies are my husband's favorite, so I made these and sugar...he ate all of the ginger cookies, good thing I like sugar too..LOL...

Very good - something about the spice was off for me, but maybe I need to get new ginger.  Easy to work with, and produces uniform-sized cookies.  Followed recipe exactly, but next time I might decrease the ginger and add more cloves as I like the flavor of them.

These are amazingly good!  I used softened butter instead of margarine and maple syrup instead of molasses, and they still turned out fantastic. I had to bake them for about 12 minutes instead of the recommended 8-10. Soft and melt-in-your-mouth... I will definitely make these again.

I didn't add cloves, but these still taste fantastic. The cookies come out relatively flat, like gingersnaps, but they're still very, very soft!

These were wonderful cookies. I will add more flour next time and OJ instead of the water. A great cookie. The house smelled wonderful while they were baking.

This recipe is definitely a keeper.  I was looking for something easy, not too spicy but full of flavor and I got it.  Changes I made:  I used butter instead of the margarine.  The recipe yielded 40 2-1/2 inch cookies that although flat, still looked very appealing; maybe next time I will not flatten them before baking.  The taste is great, not overly sweet or spicy.  Can't wait to make this recipe again and again!

Move over Chocolate Chip- this cookie could definitely replace it!  This is so good!!!  I was very intrigued because of all the good reviews, but I was amazed at how good it was.  Not much to look at, but I could definately make this cookie over & over again.  Only problem is, you can't eat just one.  It is a fabulous snacking cookie.  I made it with the orange juice instead of water and tried them rolled in Sugar in the Raw and regular sugar.  I liked the regular sugar best, but my family liked them both.  Try it- you will like it whether you are typically a fan of the ingredients or not!!!

Without a doubt 5 stars... even the dough was wonderful and I dont eat raw cookie dough!!!  To make even scoops I used the large pampered chef scoop with the easy action release.  This one makes them about perfect large walnut size.  I didnt even have to re-roll in my hands.  YUMMMMMY

This recipe was "wonderful".  I used orange juice instead of water as suggested by another reviewer.  I used a melon baller sprayed with non-stick spray to scoop and drop the cookies into the sugar and it worked great.

These are fabulous! We can never stop eating them, and my husband asks me to make them all the time! However, if we ate more than two, they made us pretty sick because the spices are so strong. I cut the clover in half and haven't had a problem since.

What can I say that has not already been said:  these are absolutely the best cookies.  What I did to solve the sticky dough problem is scoop up the dough with the small cookie dough scooper from pampered chef, dredged it through the sugar then plopped it on the tray sugar side up. No sticky fingers.  Thanks

Soft and yummy! I accidently put too much molasses in and could not taste the ginger at all but they were very good none the less. I just told everyone that they were molasses cookies! Big hit!

I've made these a few times, but the consistency was a bit too dense and heavy, even for a soft molasses cookie.  Used butter instead of margarine. I found I had to bake for 15 minutes to get a cookie that held together. I like this recipe most when I add some rolled oats to the batter, gives the cookie's texture some excitement. All-in-all, an okay recipe.

A few reviews said that you have to make another batch right away. It is so true! My husband went crazy for them! I am not such a big ginger fan, but these are fantastic. I did add more ginger as some suggested. I didn't have any clove, not sure they needed it. Thanks so much for this awesome recipe!

This recipe is wonderful.  The cookies turn out soft and chewy, as promised.  The only thing I did different was not press down the dough.  The unpressed dough results in a more homemade, rustic-looking cookie.  Thanks for the recipe!  A keeper!

Yummy - they are simple but delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I took others' advice and chilled the dough for a couple of hours, I would highly recommend doing this.  This will become a regular holiday recipe for me.

These were good but a little too sweet. I might try again with the OJ. Also, I didn't have allspice so if I make again I will add that. I did have to refridgerate the dough for about an hour because it was impossible to work with otherwise.

These are as good as any bakery cookie in how they taste and look.  I didn't pay attention to the time I baked, but pulled them out when they were slightly brown.  I took the first batch out too early and they didn't look as good, but the last two were perfect, crispy on edges and soft and chewy in middle. Yummm!

These cookies were absolutely amazing! I doubled the recipe and spread vanilla icing over half of them and they were fantastic with and without the additive. I brought a bunch into school aswell, and literally had people flying across the halls to get at, as everyone put it, "the kickass cookies". Plus they were still good a week after they'd been baked. I will definitely be making these again!

I'm sorry, but I was not that impressed with this cookie. I really wanted to like it because I LOVE ginger/molasses cookies and am looking for that 'special' recipe. The batter was delicious, but after the cookie baked it was kind of blah. I also wouldn't say they are all that soft unless it's my oven or cookie sheets. I've made these twice now, hoping I had made a mistake or something the first time. They're good, but not great. I did end up making a thick 'frosting' to drizzle on top of the cookies made with powdered sugar, molasses, orange juice and water. That gave them a kick. Thank you anyway, I'll keep trying.

oh my goodness. these cookies are delicious!! its very easy and fast. i used dark molasses so the cookies are darker, but they taste great. also, to cut back on sugar, i didnt roll the balls in the extra sugar. they are perfect. even the cookie dough itself is suppolicious! thanks a lot, im going to make again--especially this time of year!!

I made these as my "beginning of autumn" cookie.  Everyone at work loved them!

I also followed the suggestion of replacing the water with orange juice, and it was great!  Do be sure you chill the dough before handling though.

My search for the perfect ginger cookie has ended! I skipped rolling these cookies into balls and used my cookie scoop instead and simply sprinkled the sugar on top. These cookies were excellent!

I'm jumping on the bandwagon--these are simply spectacular cookies!  I love how chewy they are and rolling them in sugar gives them just the slightest hint of a crunch.  I will try the orange juice next time I make these and also rolling them in "sugar in the raw" for an added crunch.

Wow - these are the best ginger cookies I have ever tasted! I have never made ginger cookies myself before , but after making these I will do so more often. The cookies were tender and delicious - just perfectly spiced. I made these for my boyfriend's family and they disappeared fast. I also used some to make ice cream sandwiches with vanilla ice cream - definitely worth a try! Can't say enough good things about this phenomenal recipe...

Very good cookie. Be sure to refrigerate the dough before handling. Instead of margarine, I used butter, which made the texture look different than the picture (I'm guessing). Also, to speed the process up, press slightly in palm of hand, instead of after it's on the cookie sheet.

Wow, these were great! I added 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, just because it usually goes well with cinnamon, cloves, and ginger. I also topped them with cream cheese frosting. I believe I have a new favorite cookie. :0) I baked them for my church's kids' Bible time; the kids gobbled them up and asked for more. Many thanks go to whoever submitted this recipe.

These were very good, everyone liked them. I added a tsp of fresh grated ginger and an extra 1/2 of ground ginger, I still thought they could have used a tad more spice though. Nice and soft, quick to make. I roll mine in raw sugar. Will definitely make again.

I did them to eat with  a cream of mango. Spices raise the taste of the mango.

Super soft and so tasty!  The molasses really heightens the flavor, but honey can be substituted as well.  **Update** Still prefer to use molasses, have now tried using 1 T. orange liqueur (rather than 1 T. water) with excellent results!

My family loved these cookies. I was glad that I read the reviews prior to making these, if you want to be able to roll them into balls you need more flour than the recipe calls for, otherwise the dough is very soft and "sticky". The recipe calls for 2 1/4 cups of flour. I added another 3/4 cup as someone had suggested and they were much easier to work with. I will definitely make again...in double batches, they go quick!

Wow! These are the best cookies ever. I've made them quite a few times. They are a big hit at work, some even asking for the recipes. I've been making them for a while now. I also find really great flavour in grating in fresh ginger. Every time I open the container, this wonderful fragrance hits you. And they taste great. Next time I will have to try the orange juice instead of water, like suggested in other reviews.

Only four stars, but it's probably my own fault.  They taste wonderful, but I didn't realize that Smart Balance "spread" would NOT take the place of margarine.  They were flat and the batter too soft to roll balls, and they baked up a bit crispy on the edges.  But the taste was excellent and I look forward to trying them again with the proper ingredience.

These cookies came out okay which says more about me and less about the recipe itself. For starters I used less butter than the recipe called for (only had 1/2 cup) so the cookies had a "floury" taste. Since I love ginger (I used freshly grated ginger instead of powdered ginger) I will try these again.

Wow. I tripled this recipe to make some for family, and coworkers, and managed to make 88 total. I had messed up and sifted the sugar with the flour, so used the sugar for dusting to cream with the margarine, and didn't roll them in sugar in the end. They came out absolutely wonderful. I think i will do the same thing the next time i make them. Also tripled the amount of cinnamon recommended cause i love cinnamon. I found it easier to roll the dough out if you spray your hand with a little non stick butter spray. Cookies are soft and so delicious. My fiance stuffed 2 of them in his mouth one right after the other. Definitly a KEEPER!!

Excellent Cookies! I made them with reduced fat butter and they still turned out chewy and soft, even after a few days.

Mmmmm...if you like the taste of ginger then these are the cookies for you. They are very soft, so I think next time I will put a little more flour in it. I even put the dough in the fridge over night and they still went pretty flat while cooking. I just need to tweek it a bit. Will make again.

It isn't autumn without apple cider & my mother's molasses crinkle cookies.  Don't tell Mom, but these are better.  No need to refrigerate overnight, minimal batter stuck to my hands when rolling, and absolutely delicious.

I felt that the combination of molasses and spices was a little much.  I may make these again, using less cloves.  They came out very soft, and the better tasting ones were baked about a minute longer than the others.  I recommend about 9 minutes.

Needs way more stars.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  I love ginger cookies and this is my new and forever recipe.

I was generous with the ginger - added about an extra l/8th tsp.  Rolled them very gently into balls without chilling the dough and rolled them in sugar.  Used more than 2 tbsps of sugar.  I weighed the balls as I went (2 grams dough balls made 26 cookies).  They were an enormous hit at home and at work.

Changes I made:
replaced 1 c flour with whole wheat pastry flour, used 1 T ginger, 1/2 t salt, added 1/4 t finely ground black pepper, used 1/2 c butter substitute, used 1/2 c white sugar and 1/2 c dark brown sugar.

Also since I was making these for valetines day I rolled them in red coloured sugar.

I divided the finished dough in 1/2 and refrigerated over night. 

I think next time I will add the ginger in the measurement given in the recipe- I ginger flavor over powering- but thats my bad. Overall a good recipe but I think I will try this baking technique with my favourite gingerbread man recipe.

LOVED these cookies! My husband who's not a fan of ginger cookies ate half the batch. Unlike several others I didn't have any problems with gooey or messiness (I didn't change the recipe at all). In fact, mine were less sticky then choc.chip cookie dough! After making the dough into balls I filled a bowl half full of suger to roll them around and put them on a sheet without flattening them. (more suger coating, and a puffier thicker cookie) I read the recipe wrong and didn't check on them until after 10 minutes. They were STILL moist and soft! And still delicious 4 days later. Next time I may add some choc chips for fun. Thanks for the great recipe!!

Excellent. Soft and chewy with just the right spice. I got a lot more than 24 servings though and I thought my 'walnut size' balls were on the big size.

Did as was suggested and added 2 Tablespoons of flour to the recipe and chilled about 45 min (while I mixed up a batch of another kind of cookie) before baking.  Turned out fantastic!!!  Definately a recipe to keep and pass on.

This recipe is one of the best cookie recipes on this site!  I did not change any of the ingredients listed, and they turned out perfect!  I did have to bake mine longer, a total of 14 minutes versus the 8-10 min. suggested.  My husband and 3 year old son ate them up!  Thanks Amy!

Everyone loved these cookies!  And they are a great compliment to the Pumpkin Dip recipe found on this website.  I did make one small change and that was just to add a few tablespoons more flour than originally called for.  I did this just to keep the cookies from flatening out as much.  You don't want to add too much though as it would dry out what is just a perfectly moist and chewy cookie.  And it is true - they do stay chewy.  Thanks for the great recipe.  I'll be making these year round!

Just what I was looking for! I took advice from others and made these changes: butter, 1/2c each brown/white sugar, 1/4t fresh/jarred ground ginger. I made mine 1-1/2" for 7min.

This was my first ginger cookie.  They were great.  They puffed up, kept their form and tasted terrific. The place smelled great while these were baking. They stayed soft.  A wonderful delight.  Thank you for a great recipe that I will make again. While the dough was sticky to work with, it was well worth it. Excellent.

Yum!  I'm in the middle of baking these right now and thought I'd add my comment at the same time!  These are delicious cookies.  I followed some of the hints and added some vanilla and even a couple dashes of nutmeg.  They're not a "strong" flavored cookie, but very very good!!  I'm making 8 dozen for a cookie exchange tomorrow!!

Recipe was good and fairly easy to make.  I wasn't able to roll the dough in the sugar because the dough was too sticky and wouldn't hold it's shape so I just sprinkled the sugar on the dough once I put them on the cookie sheet.  They were very tasty, but a little too rich.  Next time I will reduce the butter slightly.  I also added 1 teaspoon of vanilla.

These cookies are delicous!  I've never been able to find a recipe for soft ginger cookies before this!  They're INCREDIBLE!  They come out looking like they're from a bakery.  Very yummy!  I'll make these again and again!

My first batch came out flat and too chewy, so I turned the oven down.  The cookies fluffed up in the oven, but flattened out as they cooled.  Oh, and the cookies tasted terrific and were gone in a flash despite the texture.

Great recipe.  I added a little more ginger to mine because when I tasted the dough, it didnt taste spicy enough for me.  I think a 1/2" piece of grated fresh ginger would be a great addition to these cookies.

YUMMY! these stayed so soft, and they had delicious flavor. When I made them again, I substituted 1/2 tbs of the water for 1/2 tbs juice from fresh ground ginger root. A great way to "kick it up a notch!"

Delicious! Those were the first ginger cookies and some of the best I have ever made. To make them a bit healthier, I substituted half of all the flour with the whole wheat flour and added 2 teaspoons of oat bran, and they turned out perfect! Crispy but not dry, just the right consistency. My boyfriend ate 1/3 of the batch (with milk) before the cookies even cooled down. Thank you Amy for a wonderful recipe!

I made these a 2nd time with fresh ginger.  I doubled the recipe and used 2 full tsps of fresh grated ginger and I hardly tasted it.  I also drizzled a lemon icing over top of it and they were well received (1 1/4 cup of icing sugar with 2-3 tbsp of lemon juice, added until the right consistency).  Was thinking of using white chocolate glaze or fresh ginger glaze next time.  These really only need to be baked for 7-8 min really, flatted with the bottom of a glass.  Great and fun!

These were really good. I realized half-way into the recipe that I didn't have any molasses so I used honey and they tasted good. My dough wasn't all that sticky like other people mentioned. I will try again with molasses.

These are great cookies.  I've been looking for a recipe that is close to the Starbuck's ginger cookie and this definitely has the texture.  I will be adding a bit more ginger/cloves next time to give a bit more spice.  Thanks!

Everyone loves these cookies when I make them!  I roll the dough in more sugar than is stated, usually I coat them in the sugar well- that's the only thing I've changed.  They are so good, yummy!

I followed the recipe exactly and everyone loved them, the only thing I will do differently next time is bake for 6 minutes instead of 8, it may be my oven but the cookies were a little bit dark on the bottom when cooked for 8 minutes.

I was worried that these cookies would spread too much, so I subbed 1/2 C butter plus 1/4 C shortening for the margarine. I did flatten the balls, and they came out beautifully. I also used 1 tsp of cinnamon, increased the water and ginger slightly, and added a dash of nutmeg. They have a perfect gingerbread flavor with a soft and chewy texture. This is the recipe for gingerbread cookies!

These ginger cookies were excellent.  Very soft, different from your run-of-the-mill crunchy snaps.  I recommend using a high-quality ginger, and lots of it!

I've looked around a long time for gingerbread that was soft and stayed soft...this is it!  I LOVE these cookies!  I made them for the past two years!  I didn't roll them in sugar this year, but will pipe some store bought frosting on the top for some color and extra sweetness.

Awesome!  Followed the recipe exactly except substituting butter for the margarine.  I made them a bit smaller, and it yielded over three dozen.  I ate so many however I told my husband it only made two!  Great recipe, thank you.

This is an excellent recipe if you like soft cookies. My 6 year old son helped make this and loved rolling the cookies in the sugar. We made the recipe as written and it made 2 1/2 dozen. Definitly double or triple for Christmas baking. Great cookies!

YUM, YUM, YUM.  I don't care if anyone else likes them in my house, because I'm gonna eat them all!!
(I used butter instead of marg. and probably made them smaller than the recipe calls for because I got 3 dozen little cookies!)

I have never liked ginger cookies.  When I was little, my mother would make them often and they reminded me of what I think a dog biscuit would taste like...hard and dry.  My kids have been begging me to make ginger cookies, and the name of these cookies is what made me try them.  I love soft cookies.  Well...I have changed my tune on ginger cookies.  These are AWESOME!!!  We also made the Pumpkin Fluff Dip (recipe on this site), and these cookies were a bit soft to dip, but the taste was wonderful!!  I will make these often, and will probably never even try another ginger cookie recipe.  Thanks very much for this recipe!!!

these cookies were good, but they didn't wow me. mine also took a little longer to bake even thought i made them smaller...i don't know why that is. good flavor, though. maybe to jazz them up i'll add a little brown butter icing next time.

5 stars because the fam loved them! These cookies had good flavor, but even though I added 2-3t of additional ginger, there was no BITE (which I was hoping for)! Alas, they were nice and soft and looked just like the photo!

This is a great cookie. I cant wait to make them during the holidays (although they are great any time of year). I used 1/2 cup of light brown sugar and 1/2 a cup of white sugar, and I used unsalted butter in place of the margarine. Instead of the cinnamon and cloves I used 1 tsp of apple pie spice (that is what I had on hand). These cookies taste even better the next day.

Tasty cookies but not as dark, molasses-tasting as I prefer. Also, they were a bit dry but when I took a second batch out earlier they were undercooked. The flavor is great, though, i will keep looking for a molasses ginger cookie recipe!

Wow!  This cookie recipe IS good!  I had no problem getting the dough to hold together,  In fact, I even added about 1/4 cup extra flour for HIGH ALTITUDE baking - AND about 1-1/2 cups of raisins (for extra chewiness).  I used vanilla instead of water, and I also added 1/2 tsp. ground black pepper for extra spice.  I had to bake the cookies for 15 minutes - but worth the extra wait!

These are good cookies, but they were not as chewy as I had hoped. They were kind of crunchy around the edges. They taste really good tho and everyone who tried them thought they were great! Easy to make, too.

These are very yummy cookies! I added a dash of nutmeg and cardamom, but other than that stuck with the original recipe. They have not finally cooled yet, but I like the outer crunch with the chewy inside! As for forming the dough, I had to dust my hands with flour to successfully roll them into balls - the dough is too sticky by itself - and then dip them in sugar at that point.

I read the reviews and made the cookies and they were awesome!!  They were Santa's favorite and I'm sure they'll be requested frequently all year long.  Thanks!

These are so good!  Soft and chewy.  Try adding some white chocolate chips.

Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!  The best ginger cookies ever!  I used real butter but left out the cloves (not a big fan of them). They were moist, delicious, a true family favorite!  Thanks!

My family & I loved them. I've never baked anything before, followed the instructions to the letter, and came up with some pretty darned good cookies. Possible hint: chill dough for a few minutes before making the balls. It was really pretty runny, but fun!!! Colleagues at my office Christmans party couldn't get enough them. Thank you!

The reviews prompted me to try these in my quest for the ultimate ginger cookie....Voila! I've found it!  Only change?  Make them good and BIG and then TRY to have enough left to store them in an airtight container!

Delicious!! I did however cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup and added a little more molasses. I also made the cookies quite a bit larger which made them very chewy.

Thank you Amy!!  This is exactly the recipe I have been hoping to find!!  These cookies are great - they taste fantastic, they stay nice and soft, and they are easy to make.  I have made them several times - mostly following the recipe as shown, but also adding a little nutmeg - and have never been disappointed.  Santa gobbled them up, too!!

These cookies were EXTREMELY tasty!  I dropped them from a cookie scoop into sanding sugar and did not flatten.  They turned out pretty, chewy and delicious.  If they had been a bit fluffier, it would have been perfection.

Wonderful recipe!  Easy to make and results are delicious!  Makes a beautiful and tasty cookie!  I'm surprised to read others have trouble with the dough.  I've made these many times and have never had a problem - a scoop makes the process easy.  The hard part is not eating them all before I can give some as holiday gifts!  Good job Amy!

This recipe is so awesome!  They really do stay moist.  It was very easy to follow and make.  I will make these at Christmas for sure.
