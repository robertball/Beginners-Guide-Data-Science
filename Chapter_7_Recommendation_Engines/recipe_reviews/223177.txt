Very easy to make. Make sure your dry the spinach well or you will have a lot of liquid in the salsa. I love cucumbers and this recipe with spinach was lemony good.

This was fairly simple to make and I use this on both my fish tacos and with tortilla chips!  I pan seared some chicken breasts the other night and placed this salsa on top with sauteed spinach and it was DELICIOUS!

Very refreshing salad and easy to make. I chopped the spinach instead of mincing it. Also, I felt it needed something else, I added some chopped fresh basil leaves and topped it with some grated blue cheese. It was a big hit with my husband.
