Made this and completely omitted the butter (sounded nasty to me) and it was delicious. Didn't even notice it was missing. Everything else was done according to the recipe. Works really well on bagels in the morning too.

This recipe is a good base but I would make a few changes.  I didn't like the texture of the dry herbs. I thought they would soften up by the next day but mine didn't. Next time I would use fresh.  Normally,  I am the biggest garlic fan but the flavor was overwhelming. I used two large cloves so next time I would cut back on that some.

So.. I had some crackers and some cream cheese and was not really inspired to snack... until I thought: "maybe, there's a recipe for some 'cream cheese' dip".. Low and behold, there was! This recipe. 

I made it and was really enjoying it until my 4 kids and husband discovered my newly discovered treat... it did not last long after that. :)

I made this exact to recipe and really enjoyed it.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  It was great with some wheat thins and also ritz crackers.  I did add 2 tablespoons of milk hoping that it could still be spreadable while it was still cold, but it didn't happen.  Maybe the milk helped soften the dry herbs, I didn't have any problems with it.  Will definitely make this again. *not recommended for parties in which people want to impress others, but great for family and such - fantastic for garlic lovers :o)

Better than Boursin!!!!!!!   This will be my go to recipe for sure.   Much more flavorful than store bought.  I use this type of cheese all the time for things like crab stuffed muchrooms, pork wellington and simply with crackers.  Thanks!!!!

great base recipe. i basically used the main premise and added roasted garlic, basil, oregano, thyme, parsley, salt & pepper to taste (much more than the recipe suggests), won't buy flavoured cream cheese anymore. tastes just like herb & garlic cream cheese from tim hortons, yum!

I was looking for a cream cheese spread like what is found at Panera. As published above, this recipe wasn't exactly to my liking. I felt the butter "weighted" the spread down and added unneeded calories. And the both the amounts of garlic and oregano overpowered the taste of the cream cheese. However, this is a 4-star recipe because of its adaptability. I personally omitted the butter and oregano, and used powered garlic and onion, and bumped up the dill. It turned out very similar to the spread used on the fantastic tomato herbed cream cheese bagels at my local coffee shop. You will enjoy the creativity of this recipe.

Really tasty and easy!  Had some this morning on my Ezekiel sesame toast - really good (escpecially with the sesame seeds on the toast - yum!), even though I thought the garlic might be too strong (particularly in the morning!) it was not too strong at all.  This would be great on one of those "everything" bagels.  Since I can tell I'll be making this again, I will probably try with reduced fat cream cheese/butter next time, but other than that I don't recommend any other changes - it's excellent as stated!  Thanks for sharing! N*R

Did pretty much as directed - strong (garlic) cause did not let set long enough. Had mellowed out by next day. Used only 1/2 of butter. Used mainly as a spread on crackers. Also great on sandwiches (meat ball subs - yummo!) and grilled chicken - instead of mayo. Excellent!

This was pretty good, and is a good base idea. Like others, I'd cut the butter by up to half. The oregano was just too much for me, too, so I'd leave that out next time, and increase the dill a bit. I didn't mind the dry herbs, just the strong oregano flavor. It would also be good with goat cheese rather than cream cheese. We ate it as a snack on bagels! N*R

LOVE this! 
I did make a few changes tho! I didn't add the butter because I thought it sounded unhealthy so in it's place I added 3 Tbsp. of sour cream! It wasn't to stiff but not to runny & had an amazingg flavor! :D

Listening to others I too cut the butter in half.  I used this to stuff refrigerated creascent rolls before bakinig was great.  I made some creasent shaped and others like pinwheels. This was for a breakfast potluck so I did not add as much spices,  mostly just cheese, parm and garlic.  it was still good went fast thanks!

Way too much butter in my opinion.  I only used 2 tablespoons and it was incredible!  Did used bottled spices because I didn't have any fresh.  I made a double batch (actually used 4 tablespoons of butter because it was a double batch) and baked it in a puff pastry dough with chopped turkey.  I took some extra cream cheese mix and added some horseradish and all I can say is "WOW!!"  Will add some bacon and horseradish and stuff mushrooms with it next time.  This is a really great versatile recipe if you cut down the butter.  Might try it with the whole stick of butter another time just to see what it tastes like, but even though I love butter on everything, I thought it just sounded like too much.  But this recipe is fantastic!

Incredible dip, but the butter isn't really necessary. I made it with only cream cheese (added more to make up for the lost substance) and it turned out great!

Sounds like a great recipe.  I saw Rachael Ray make a recipe called Fake Out Dip on Oprah today using purchased spread like this so immediately searched my favorite recipe site to make it myself. The Rachael Ray recipe was a layered dip in a bowl lined with plastic wrap that was chilled and turned out onto a serving plate.  I can't wait to try that recipe using this one for my Bible Study group! I'm giving this 5 stars because I can tell with the fresh herbs from my garden it will be great.

This is pretty good, but I'm tasting the butter/margarine/whatever this recipe called for pretty strongly.  I would cut that back to maybe 1/2 stick so it wouldn't be as prominent a taste for me.  Otherwise, quick and easy and it keeps well.  I made this 2 days ago and am just getting around to trying it!  Good for crackers or bagels.  Thanks!  N*R Go to Recipe Exchange for more info on N*Rs.

As others recommended, I also omitted the butter and added a tiny bit of milk to get the proper consistency to squeeze through a decorating tip.  It was very good, and I can see how it would be incredibly easy to adjust according to taste.  This time I used it with different colored peppers, but it could be put on just about anything.  I will make this again.

I really enjoyed this. I used fresh herbs, since they're growing on my back porch right now, and used garlic powder instead of minced garlic. It was actually better the second day! I used it to fill some cherry tomatoes and they were yummy. Now I'm enjoying it as a cracker spread. Thanks!!

We thought this was exceptionally good and as others did, I cut the butter in half and next time I'll cut the garlic in half.  We are garlic lovers but felt this was a little heavy-handed.  I diced up a bit of sundried tomatoes in it, too, for color.  Overall, it certainly is a keeper and as others have said, stuff always on hand and cheepo !  Makes a handy little quickie gift for someone who unexpectedly brings you a little something.  Just put in a pretty little container and keep in fridge til needed.

This was good, I served it with raw veggies.  I will cut back on the butter next time, but even with the whole amount it was good, just a little too much for my taste. N*R

I omitted the butter, used lower fat cream cheese, and used about 1/8 tsp garlic powder instead of the 2 cloves. Because I am more likely to eat this on a bagel in the morning, the idea of fresh garlic in the a.m. does not appeal to me. It tastes good. I think next time I will add a dash of salt.

This was very good. I took the advice from other posters and cut butter way back to 2 Tbs. Instead of chopped garlic, I substituted garlic powder as I threw a party with children attending. (my kids are not very fond of chunks of raw garlic). I added in 1/2 cup reduced fat sour cream to help with spreadability. Thanks for sharing!

I was looking for a recipe for garlic and herb cream cheese for an appetizer recipe. I thought this tasted pretty good. I made 1/2 recipe, used low fat cream cheese, and left out the butter. I may try it in the future with butter, just to see the difference. The only downside is I thought the texture of some of the dry herbs was a little noticeable. I am guessing refridgerating it some, would soften them up a bit. Excellent flavor, though!

I made this for my wife as I am not a great lover of cream cheese.  I did leave out the parmesan and dill as she does not like these, but she loved the result!  She tells me this is her garlic and herb cream cheese from here on out.  The only reason for the four stars as opposed to five, was because I had to change it a bit.

I  liked this as well as everyone else who nibbled on it last night.  As per other reviews, I used a half stick of unsalted butter. I also only put in a pinch of thyme because I think thyme can overwhelm. I also added a pinch of Kosher salt.  Thanks for posting.

Excellent and easy to make.  I used all fresh herbs instead of dried herbs.  Tripling the amount called for to convert the dried measurement to fresh.  I also eliminated the butter because I was making it to stuff portabella caps and thought the butter might make it too light and creamy for my purpose.  Very tasty!

great flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I used the less expensive herbs which are generally cut much bigger.  I think for the best outcome if used with  bagels and crackers, use the more expensive herbs which are cut much finer.  if you want to use only for bagels, I would omit the butter.

This is a great recipe. Very easy to personalize. I used 1/3 Less Fat cream cheese, left out the butter, and used garlic powder instead of fresh. I also mixed it with a handmixer and added a splash of buttermilk. Delicious!

Yum.  I doubled the recipe and halved the butter (1 stick total) and I think it will be gone in a flash at Bible Study tonight!  I did add 4 Tbsp milk for the double recipe as someone else suggested and mixed it in the Cuisenart.  Thanks for the suggestions!

As written I'll give it 4 stars only because it does not need all that butter.  I put a little in, but no where near what it called for.  It's a great recipe otherwise.  No need to buy the garlic and herb cream cheese at the store anymore!  Thanks!!

I omitted the butter and added a scoop of sour cream to make it creamier. I used it to stuff chicken breasts and bacon wrapped shrimp. Now I’m enjoying the rest with some crackers. Wonderful recipe (without butter)!

I made this according to directions and it tastes good.  I do not like how stiff it is.  I think this would be better if it was creamier and easy to spread.

Made the recipe almost exactly as written. I just couldn't help myself  and added more cheese than called for. It was amazing! Like others, I worried about using the butter, it just didn't fit in my mind. Since I'm  eating Keto know I figured it would help bump up the fat content. It turned out fantastic! I've eaten it on cucumber slices and celery spears. I will totally add this to the dip rotation.

I rated it four stars as I did not have all the ingredients so can't properly comment on the recipe. I used a combination of fresh and dried herbs and added chives and omitted the dill.  I didn't add butter but the cream cheese that my husband purchased had butter in  it. At first I thought the  flavours of the butter and parmesan cheese taste were too much but after sitting 8 hours all the flavours blended well. But, as others have stated, it tasted even better the next day. Next time I will use two large cloves of garlic as we really like a garlicky dishes.

Just made it. Was almost out of garlic , so I substituted some very finely diced onions instead of the second garlic clove and it was perfect.
Just made it second time, without the butter and halved the herbs on another recommendation and still good, just less...well buttery. Still good that way too though, and doubt it will last long :)

My wife asked me to find a spread that she used to buy from her overpriced specialty market. I used fresh herbs instead of the dried herbs called out in the recipe.  This is what I decided to make with the spread.  Spread on ciabatta loaf  slices with cucumber, tomato, onion, sunflower sprouts and fresh ground black pepper.  Thanks for sharing your delicious recipe and hope you enjoy what I made as well.

I was looking for a dinner recipe to use up my puff pastry. Found a garlic & herb chicken pocket that called for garlic & herb flavored cream cheese, the store didn't carry it.  I made this exactly (hesitant about the butter) and it was delicious!!  I will try on a cold sandwich for lunch tomorrow! Recommend.

Good flavor the title should read Garlic and herb cream cheese spread. I served it with chips it was too thick for that. Would be great on crackers or stuffed in celery.

I have made this three times now and everyone really enjoys it. First time very garlicy so I decreased the garlic 2nd & 3rd times.  The butter is a little too funky for me so 2nd time added some sour cream, 3rd time did just cream cheese. Make it ahead of time so the flavors blend well.  Unlike previous reviewers, I had no problem with dry herbs but can't wait until summer to try with fresh.

AWESOME!  I did alter a hint by using low fat cream cheese...couldn't even tell a difference!  Friends loved it at my holiday party!
