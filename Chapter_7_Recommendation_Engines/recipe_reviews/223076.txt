My husband and I really enjoyed this soup topped with sour cream, sharp cheddar cheese and black olives. I cheated and used the meat from an entire store-bought rotisserie chicken. Because of that change I added one tablespoon of chicken flavored Better Than Boullion to the water to provide the stock that my batch was missing due to using the pre-cooked chicken. I let it simmer on the stove on low for sabout four hours (simulating a Crock Pot) which reduced the liquid slightly and concentrated the wonderful spices. Perfect chicken enchilada soup!

This was rather bland as written.  I added 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp pepper, 1 tsp ground cayenne, 2 tsp oregano, and an extra tsp garlic powder- with the changes this is a 4 star recipe.

Excellent recipe! I left out the onion because my husband hates them and added an extra 1/2 tsp of garlic powder. We loved it!

This is really good! I have another recipe that calls for ranch style beans but my local grocery doesn't carry them. I had Buffalo Beans on hand and they are delicious in this soup. Gave it a little kick! I certainly don't find it bland at all but maybe it's the beans. I added a spoonful of sour cream to each bowl.  I also used stewed tomatoes with mexican seasoning because that is all I had. I will definitely make this again.

We loved this recipe.  Only change I made was for my family - I used a lot less Chilli Powder - I only used 1/2 teaspoon. This still ended up being a hearty yummy soup.
