I used oreos instead of chocolate wafers.  I also used Hersheys syrup instead of Nestle.  It was a hit with the kids!  Very Yummy!

Kids love this I put it in a sand box bucketg and serve it with the shovel.  I reccomend you keep some gummy weorms reserved to put on after you dish it out.  Every kid wants a worm.  I did this for a boy's birthday party.  It was a hit.

A friend made this for a party. Used chocolate graham crackers instead of wafers and omitted the syrup. Good, nothing overwhelming -- like comfort dessert food.

I know this is a Nestle recipe, but it really does not need the syrup.  It's way too sweet and hard to work with.

Quick and easy. Used individual mugs and made two variations: one with vanilla ice cream and one with chocolate pudding.
