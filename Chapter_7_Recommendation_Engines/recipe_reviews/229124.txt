These were delicious.  I sliced mine in half instead of stuffing the whole pepper, which is what I usually do.  I did this just for looks but they were wonderful.  One little side note though.

I mixed Ground Turkey with Beef and omitted the sauce on top. I also skipped the boiling the bell peppers step and everything turned out great. Very tasty and next time I will add some cheese to the meat mixture.

My family loved the flavor and presentation but the rice was undercooked and I even added extra time to bake.  I added garlic powder and used red and orange peppers to make it fun for Fall!  Next time I will cook the rice before placing mixture in peppers.

Would definitely make again.  This is a nice basic recipe in which you can add the spices you like.   I added garlic, parsley, additional Worchester sauce.    I skipped cooking the peppers ahead of time.  I cooked the burger first, then added all the ingredients, mixed well, stuffed the peppers, poured sauce over them, and then baked.  I added a little water to pan to create steam and minimize burning on the bottom of pan.  Then covered well with aluminum foil.  The steam cooked the peppers just fine.   My family loved it!

I substituted Johnsonville hot Italian Sausage and it added a lot of flavor and gave it a bit of a kick. I also added mozzerella cheese in place of the cheddar. Delicous! Flavors blended well. We loved it and will try this again.

Turned out great even though I precooked the beef before I added it to the filling mixture, I also didn't boil the peppers and I omitted pouring the extra sauce on the top.

OMG, SO GOOD! My boyfriend and I (21 y/o female$) loved it. Just made it last night and currently finishing leftovers. :D

I made a few changes though:
1. Substituted 1/4 cup onion for 1/8 cup minced garlic and 1/8 cup basil because I hate onion, and also to better suit my Italian taste buds.
2. Didn't put in salt/black pepper. (Have pepper, but just outright forgot. Don't have salt because I'm not really a fan of it.)

Other than that, it was delicious, and I will definitely have to make these again!

It was so good! Made a few changes, used green peppers and added a hot Italian sausage to meat. Really a great meal.

I cooked the ground beef first in order to drain off the fat.  I used regular brown rice and cooked it until al dente which gave the meat mixture a bit of  a nutty flavor.  About one-half tablespoon chili powder added punch, as well.  Mix it all together and fill the peppers.  I served the extra meat mixture on the side for those who wanted more meat.  Delicious!

I used 1/2 pasta sauce 1/2 crushed tomatoes.  Put a little mozzarella chunk in each before baking.   Precooked hamburger and 1/2 of rice.   This was excellent.  Great recipe to experiment with.

It was yummy, I cooked the beef and rice before adding them into the mixture, but that's the only thing I did differently. Will make again!

Very good. I was originally going to make Chef John's Stuffed Peppers, but this looked like a faster, easier weeknight meal. What I did do was saute the onion and meat a little before stuffing the peppers. What I didn't do was parboil the peppers beforehand. After an hour the peppers were still a little firm so next time I'll do that. Will make again and also try Chef John's version for comparison.

Easy to make, had plenty of filling. Added a touch of parsley, basil and red pepper flake for personal taste. Chopped the tops ups and added them to the filling for added flavor.Skipped the cheddar cheese for a topping of bread crumbs, olive oil and parmigiano cheese. will use again.
