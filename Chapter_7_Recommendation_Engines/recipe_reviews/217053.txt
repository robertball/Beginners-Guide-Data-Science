This is really good! I loved the curry flavor...it reminds me of the curry chicken salad I used to eat in Belgium. I made this recipe as is except I did add some fresh cracked pepper. Thanks for a new way to eat quinoa!

This was good.  I did use reduced sodium chicken broth instead of vegetable.  Really didn't get the citrus flavor that much at all, mostly curry.  I really like curry, but that is really the only flavor you taste.  Would probably make it again using some orange zest in there as well and perhaps chopped carrots or celery or some kind of crunch.

This was quite good. Had a wonderful flavor to it that made for a light and refreshing lunch. It makes a whole lot though- next time I will only make a half batch, as I couldn't finish it in a week. But I will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing!

I had had a salad like this about a week ago and wanted the recipe, stumbled across this one and was so happy. This is so simple, with a lot a flavour, definitely a keeper.

I changed this recipe by omiting the oil and raisens and cooked the sauce on the stove and served it hot.  It was awesome!

I really liked this recipe, however, I read the other reviews and served it warm.  I also added chicken.  I cooked chicken with chopped garlic, onion and pepper.  I served it as a main meal.

This was delicious!  I made for a picnic lunch side dish and it travelled beautifully.  I only added the almonds upon serving (packed them seperately) to preserve the crunch.  Loved it!

This quinoa dish is wonderful and quick and easy to make. I cooked the quinoa in water and toasted my curry pwd. before adding. I didn't really get a lot of the citrus flavor as I think I added too much red onion. I love red onion though, so it wasn't a negative for me. Will make this a lot!

Yummy!!! I didn't use all the sauce- it was a bit much for me, and I added an extra dash of curry at the end (just to suit my taste). Amazingly yummy!

Fantastic recipe. I added some grated carrot. Did 4x the recipe for a big party and it turned out great.  This is being added to my regular rotation for sure.

Very nice lunch option- good at room temperature. Nice blend of flavors- I did add a splash of Braggs apple cider vinegar to balance the sauce out. The almonds add a nice crunch. I didn't have red onions, so for color and more veggieness I added peas and finely diced carrots. PS, a heaping tablespoon OJ concentrate seemed to work just as well. Def will go into regular healthy lunchtime rotation.

I loved this recipe, I did not have any raisins so I substituted them for sultana and seed mix that I had in the cupboard. It tasted great. everyone loved it at the BBQ. Plenty of leftovers for another meal and lunch for work.

It is a very flavorful recipe. I followed the recipe and it came out perfectly. The only substitution I made was to use chopped cashews instead of almonds.

I doubled the recipe and made it just as is. It's really good. I"m sure when I go back in the morning after the flavors have mixed, it's going to be even better. I was lazy and didn't use fresh oj or fresh lemon juice, but it was just fine. Easy and great for a pot luck.

Agreed that not all the dressing is necessary-- just pour some on, taste, and add until you're satisfied.  I had extra.  I also agree that you do not need to wait for this dish to chill before eating it--it was great both warm and at room temperature.  We also found that cumin works fine in place of the curry powder if you don't have curry.  We thought it made only about three servings, so I would certainly double this if I had enough ingredients.  It is a delicious curry-flavored dish, so if you don't like curry, you won't like this (reminds me of curried couscous salad).

so glad I tried this, I really enjoyed the mix of ingredients. The citrus really brightens it up and brings out all the flavors. I am usually really picky but this was super delicious.

Really simple and full of flavor! Hubby and I both loved it. I made it exactly as written, except for one thing - I used dried currants instead of raisins. I'll definitely be making this again. It reminds me of the awesome fresh salad-bar items you get from a certain over-priced "natural" food market. There was the perfect amount for the both of us to have a side for dinner, and a nice lunch the next day.

Depending on the audience I sub maple syrup for honey (Vegan) or leave nuts out for those intolerant. During the holidays I add dried cranberries instead of raisins for color. I make a double batch for pot luck type affairs and have never had any leftover.

Pretty good and pretty easy to make. I also served it warm. I made my quinoa in the rice cooker with the sautéed garlic and onions. Then I added the dressing afterwards. Also added in re-hydrated raisins and avocado and I'd HIGHLY recommend adding the little bit of avocado. It added a nice touch.

Didn't have a red onion so I used a small shallot and a couple of scallions instead.  The dressing is perfect.  This is also good using pistachios instead of almonds.  I used golden raisins.  Had it for breakfast this morning! I think it's even better the day after it's made.

This was very good! I had no almonds on hand, so I used peanuts instead. I also added kidney beans to make it a bit more hearty. The mellow sweetness of the raisins and nuts provided an excellent contrast to the vibrant curry.

I really like this recipe . . . it is fresh and spicy. Instead of raisins I use dried cranberries for a little more kick. Also, roasted sunflower seeds work in a pinch if you are out of almonds. 
All around, lots of flavour.

This was my first time eating this grain. When I read ingredients it reminded me of one of my favorite Thai dishes pineapple fried rice. So I used pineapple juice instead of lemon and added some chunks of pineapple to it. Then I replaced part of the water it called for to soak cook  quinoa into pan with this dressing mixture and served hot. I was right! It was outstanding!!! I also don't like raisins so I used dried cranberries.
