This was wonderful and unique! Per the previous reviewer, I served over "Coconut Rice" (also found on this site) and the combination of flavors was great (salt& sweet)! I've never had anything like it but I'll be making this tasty dish again! Thanks Evelyn for sharing this new way to cook chicken!

The chicken was moist, but lacked flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly, but next time might add some garlic or other seasonings.  It tasted like boiled chicken with onions.

I will make this again! I used leg quarters(4lbs) instead of a whole chicken. This was something different for us but was very flavorful. At the suggestion of another rater I made this dish with Mexican rice 2, also on this website.yum yum

This recipe is awesome, if you add 1/2 cup of fresh lemon juice.  I can't imagine that it would be too good without the lemon!

A perfectly reasonable stewed chicken. A quiet recipe, but really nice.

I first had this in a Salvadoran restaurant near DC and loved it. They used only chicken breasts and I believe they substituted lime for lemon juice.

Delicious! We loved this one. The chicken was moist and flavorful and the onions were to die for.
