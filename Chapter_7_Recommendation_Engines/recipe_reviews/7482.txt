Grrrr-EAT stuff! 
Following the advice of others, I made the following modifications:
Used five cups of rhubarb instead of four; cut the nutmeg in half and added a quarter teaspoon of cinnamon to the topping.
For those of you who are wondering about using frozen rhubarb, I did -- but I thawed it first. I drained off all but about a quarter cup of the liquid that was created as it thawed. This helped with the stiffness of the dough in the final stage and didn't seem to affect the finished product at all. From what others are saying, my batter was probably a lot easier to spread in the pan.
As for results: I took the cake to my parents' house on a visit and everyone there really liked it -- even my dad, who isn't the easiest guy to please!
I will definitely make this again; the recipe is going into my file. Thanks, Deb!

WARNING: the batter consistency will be as thick as cookie dough, but it is supposed to be that way! I double and triple checked to make sure I had this recipe right the first time I made it because it was so thick. 
2nd WARNING: Wait to eat it!!!! The first piece I tried was right after it cooled and it was blah. The next day it was AWESOME! Make this the day before and you won't be disappointed.

I served this cake today for our weekly afternoon tea and we were amazed by how delicious it was.  The only comment I have to make about preparation is four stalks of rhubarb equals four cups of chopped and I had not expected the batter to be so stiff and at first thought maybe it would not rise.  By the time I got all the ingredients in the bowl except for the sour cream it was real stiff.  But it all turned out very good. . the rhubarb gave this cake a tartness which was delicious with the sweetness of the brown sugar in the recipe.

Very moist and delicious.  I would have to agree with the other raters that this cake is better the next day.  I used cinnamon and sugar on top instead of nutmeg.  It was wonderful.  NOTE:  The batter is very thick like cookie dough.....don't worry though...it is supposed to be that way.  Will definetly make again!

I accidently added 1/4 cup of butter to the topping and I swirled it on top of the batter.It tasted unbelievably moist and rich. Even my mother-in-law who hates rhubarb liked it! This is now my FAVORITE rhubarb recipe~

This cake was very good.  My daughter loved it with whipped creme.  To me the nutmeg was a bit strong, so next time I would substitute cinnamon.

The cake came out great.  The sugar on top gave it a sweet crunchy crust.  The cake is very moist and not overly sweet.  I'm sure I'll make it again.

I love the tartness of rhubarb and this recipe was perfect!! The sweetness of the cake complements the tartness of the rhubarb.  My family enjoyed this recipe - will make again.

Excellent cake and very easy.  However, I only used 2 1/2 cups of rhubarb and it was more than enough.  For the topping, I melted a half a stick of butter to add to the sugar/cinnamon mixture with enough sugar to make it pasty and then spread on the top of the cake.  Delish!

This was really, really good.  I had my doubts when the batter was so stiff...almost like cookie dough...but it turned out sensational.  Did substitute cinnamon for the nutmeg though because nutmeg just makes me kind of...nutty.  Yup...good stuff!

This cake is really good, the sour cream adds a nice flavor.  I changed the method of mixing - I creamed the butter, sugar, egg and vanilla, then stirred in the sour cream, then the dry ingredients and rhubarb.  I think the batter would have been harder to manage otherwise.

I'm not the biggest Rhubarb lover, but the house we moved into came complete with a lot of Rhubarb plants growing along the back fence.   Over the last week I've been picking it and giving it away.   Someone made a pie, someone stewed it, etc...    I was bored last weekend and decided to do a search for something to make with some Rhubarb and this little RHUBARB STIR CAKE recipe appeared.   I had everything except the sour cream, so we ran out and picked some up and I went to work making the cake.    Well, let me tell you, as we sat out on the front porch with a piece each, my husband kept making what I would call "YUMMY NOISES" and told me this was the BEST cake I had ever made.  He rated it a 10/10 and proceeded to grab another large piece.   I grabbed the cake and cut a small piece for my mom and we took it over to her the next day.   She devoured it and stated she gave it a 11/10.   My brother isn't a big rhubarb fan, but after hearing my husband and mom rave about this cake, he is going to try a piece next time I bake one.   I went out to the garden and ended up bagging 4 more bags (4 cups each) of Rhubarb so I can bake this cake in the winter.  (SMILE)   This is an awesome wonderful cake!!!     Sooooooo easy to make too!!   LOVE IT!!!!!

I have made this recipe 3 times, substituting cinnamon for the nutmeg. Also, in mixing the batter, I alternately added the flour mixture with the sour cream, so it didn't get too stiff. I shared the cake and the recipe with the ladies in my quilting class. One friend took a copy of the recipe and served it to her husband, who now has changed his favorite dessert from lemon bars to Rhubarb Stir Cake!

WOW this is so good! I've made this last summer and the summer before, and I'm waiting (impatiently) for the weather to warm up to the point where the rhubarb is growing again. this is undoubtedly one of my favourite dessert recipes ever. Normally I make it as writen with 2 substitutions... oil instead of butter (no pesky trans fats!) and non-fat yogurt instead of sour cream. I have on ocasion used other fruits... it works well with blueberries, raspberries or strawberries, and I am thinking of trying is with Bananas or grated carrot.

This is a nice cake; great sweet and tart notes, although I feel like having a dollop of whipped cream with it is absolutely necessary.  A few notes: I used frozen rhubarb and although I drained it, there was still extra liquid in the batter.  It was not nearly as thick as others have said and consequently, despite halving the recipe, it required MORE than the 40 minutes cook time.  It allowed the sugar on top to make a really nice crust, however.  Also, don't be afraid of nutmeg!  Cinnamon has become such a catch-all spice and the nutmeg gives some nice, subtle notes.

DELICIOUS!  I used frozen rhubarb, thawed, but didn't drain it.  It made the cake supremely moist (which is what I was aiming for)!  I added 1 tsp. cinnamon to the batter and also sprinkled about 1/2 tsp cinnamon on top along with the nutmeg and sugar.  The ladies in my MOPS group loved it!

Best Rhubarb Cake I have ever had.  I used frozen rhubarb, and it worked well.  I added some walnuts to the cake, and added a little cinnamon to the sugar/nutmeg mixture.  It was a little like a coffee cake.  Very good.

My first time using Rhubarb.  Great cake, but I would cut down on the amount of sugar used to sprinkle on top.  I ended up dumping some off.

My church had a coffee house function and asked me to make 5 desserts and this was one of them.  I got so many compliments on my baking.  This dessert was very popular at the function.  I added one cup of raspberries as well.  One friend had 5 Servings!  I served it w/ cool whip and made sure I baked it a day before serving it.

Excellent.  It was good the first day.  I will definitely make this again.  I cut the rhubarb very small so that my husband (who does not like rhubarb) would not be biting into big chunks and ,yeah, he liked it too!

I made this cake just as the recipe suggested but found I needed 5 additional minutes cooking time.  Not too sweet, super moist with a slightly crisp sugar coating on the top.  Really good I used 1/2 inch slices of rhubarb and will cut the rhubarb 1/4 inch next time.  Definately a keeper!!

Beyond excellent! Only thing different was I omitted sugar and nutmeg to the top. In place I put the nutmeg inside. For a topping I made a mix of butter confectionary sugar, a tad lemon juice and 2 Tbsp. strawberry jam. I spread it on the warm cake (not hot) It just a bit more than a glaze and was a wonderful compliment to the rhubarb. Next time I will add a crumble top and use for a coffee cake. It was gobbled up in no time at all. Two from are coffe group that don't eat rhubarb loved it!

This recipe is really, really good!! It is moist and tastes absolutely delicious. The true proof of it, though, is that my husband, who normally doesn't like rhubarb unless it's sweetened to the point of being sickening, really liked it - normally he refuses point-blank to try rhubarb recipes at all! I made a half-recipe in a 7x7" pan, and it came out beautifully. I did use cinnamon sugar (with a big of nutmeg) on top rather than the "nutmeg sugar" for which the recipe called. Definitely, definitely a keeper.

Very moist cake. Even my husband liked it -and he doesn't eat rhubarb. Better the second day. Did not care for the nutmeg. The flavor didn't seem to taste right with the other flavors of the cake. Will use cinnamon instead next time.

Was a pretty tasty cake. More like a coffee cake or Blueberry Buckle with rhubarb, not berries. My rhubarb bits seemed to float and I might consider shredding it next time to avoid the wet pits.

Delicious!  I substituted low-fat sour cream (which I added before the dry ingredients to ease stirring), reduced the butter to 3 tbsp., used 3 cups of rhubarb and substituted cinnamon for the nutmeg.  This was a huge hit for Father's Day!

I ran out of flour and had to use 1/3 a cup of bisquick, i also didn't have quite enough sour cream.  Miraculously it still came out delicious!  Definite repeat

Hubby took this to work and everyone raved. They loved how moist it was. I usually make another recipe but thought I would try this one for a change. Both taste almost identical - the only difference between the two was sour cream instead of sour milk, and brown sugar instead of white.  Could probably substitute one for the other if you find yourself short of ingredients and don't want to run to the store. I also used cinnamon along with the nutmeg in the topping, I just like the flavor more. I sprinkled some leftover chopped pecans on half of the cake for a little added crunch, which added a nice flavor.

I halved the recipe and baked in an 8x8 square pan  for 30 minutes. Since you can't use half an egg, I added a little extra flour, to compensate. Used 1 cup white flour and 1/4 cup wheat flour. (Batter is VERY thick.) Sprinkled cinnamon and a little raw sugar as the topping (the larger crystals are VERY nice on top!). Tastes great, but cake doesn't keep well, so don't expect to save it more than a day.

Followed directions as is and it turned out pretty good.  I will probably take the advice of other reviewers of adding more rhubarb and cutting or omitting the nutmeg.  With that switch it would be 5 stars with cinnamon instead.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing.

This is a delicious cake, and it was easy to make. I didn't know rhubarb is so good. I only had 4 stalks to use, so that was more like 2 cups of rhubarb. I substituted allspice for nutmeg. I think I could have baked if for another 10 minutes in addition to the 40 minutes, because it was a little too moist in the middle. I will try to make this again this spring.

This cake is really good. I grow rhubarb and this is an excellent way to prepare early season rhubarb that is not as sweet as the later season harvest. I used 5 stalks so approximately 5 cups and find that to be a good ratio of sweet and tart. For the topping I went with cinnimon sugar instead of the nutmeg. Next time I might add some strawberries.

Very tasty little cake, although a bit on the tart side.  As others suggested, I substituted plain low-fat yogurt for the sour cream and cinnamon for the nutmeg; I also used just under half whole wheat flour, which worked fun.  The batter is thick, and I did have to increase the cooking time a bit, but the cake still turned out nice and moist.  Overall, a nice little cake that I would make again.

This was pretty yummy, although I think I'll keep looking for a better rhubarb cake / bread recipe. 

A bit too sweet for my liking (even though I reduced the sugar to 2/3 of the original !)

Great texture; I used slightly less rhubarb (it was all that I had), and baked muffins instead of a cake, which worked really well!

This was yummy.  The only thing I did different was to use 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 yogurt (that is what I had).  I also mixed the sugar with cinnamon and nutmeg and about 2 T. of butter then sprinkled it over the top.  I also waited a day to eat it.  It was moist and very, very good served with real whip cream.  This made the favorite box.

Not bad, but not great either. Quite bland and, although moist, was tough after a day or two, no doubt thanks to the low fat content. The mixture was so dry that I rechecked the receipe a couple of times to see if I had missed something. I won't make this again.

I've made this recipe several times and always go looking for it when those big green leaves appear!  I like this more as a snackin' cake than a true dessert, but I also cut back on the sugar both in the cake and on the topping.  An excellent coffee treat!

Excellent to use up fresh rhubarb.  I cut my rhubard up fairly fine.  More juice seems to come out of the fruit this way so I _did not_ have the problem others have mentioned about a very stiff batter.

But, for a 2nd try I wanted to shift things a bit more to my taste.  Used only 1 teaspoon (not 1 tablespoon as in recipe) of vanilla -- having so much made it more of a vanilla cake.  Also reduced sugar, used non-fat yoghurt in place of sour cream (it's hard to find here in England), used half coarsely ground whole wheat flour, and sprinkled oats over the top.  Don't know about others, but it did suit our taste and while the cake didn't raise up high, the recipe still worked!

This was a good one mostly because it was sooo easy and you didn't need to get out your beaters. :) I would definitely use about 1/3 cup of white sugar in the batter too - mine was just a tad too tart for my taste, but still good. Extremely moist. Extremely easy.

I made this with one cup freshly ground soft wheat and the rest in AP flour. I used frozen rhubarb but I think I should have thawed it first. Took a long time to cook. I also didn't have sour cram but had milk that was a little sour and needed to be used up so I used it. I think the 1/3 c sugar to sprinkle on top was too much. Only used half the amount. Came out very good although had to cook longer because of the frozen fruit. Husband liked very much.

This cake was very good. The nutmeg was a nice change from the usual cinnamon topping. I do think it tastes best with some whipped cream or ice cream on top.

Great way to use up rhubarb as this recipe uses a lot.  Dough is kind of tough to spread in the pan, but the cake bakes up beautifully.  I like this recipe because it doesn't use a lot of butter.  I did use fat free sour cream because that is what I had in the refrigerator.  I am taking it to the teacher's lounge tomorrow.

Great cake.  I used about 3 cups of rhubarb as that is what I had.  I also added some butter to the topping as suggested in earlier reviews.  This cake is as good as the reviews say.  I brought it to work this morning and everyone loved it.  I also used cinnamon rather than nutmeg and added about 1/2 tsp to the batter as well.   I will definitely make this again.  I want more now.

This was Fantastic. I took it to work and the pan was wiped clean. I did make one subsitution. I didn't have any sour cream on hand so I used 1 cup plain low fat yogurt. It came out great! This is a keeper!

Recipes like this are the reason I love this site!  I would have passed this recipe by if it hadn't been for the high rating...and it is well deserved!  This cake is super moist and very tasty...and it only has 1/4 cup of butter in it.  The only changes I made were that I substituted plain yogurt for the sour cream and I had to bake it for an extra 10 minutes.  Personally, I liked the nutmeg in the topping, but cinnamon would be nice too.  I will definitely make this again!

I loved this recipe. I have made it several times, the whole family likes it. I also used fat free sour cream and that seemed fine for our house (we use it all the time). It is quick, easy and tasty.

Totally fabulous cake! Great with a cuppa java after dinner. Everyone loved the sweet/sour taste. I put cinnamon in the batter and made a simple crumble topping with brown sugar, flour, butter and cinnamon. Threw in some hucklberries too. One of the best 'coffee cakes' I've ever made. Moist and delicious. Not too sweet, which is what we enjoy the most, and so easy to throw together! It even travels well in lunches. Everyone had to have a piece in their lunch today. I cooked mine a little longer than it said to. You have to use common sense and do the tooth pick test or your cake will come out mushy. Thanks Deb! I'll be making this cake often.

I would add less rhubarb, and maybe some apples or strawberries too.  The cake was too moist, almost mushy in parts and lacking in flavour.

I've shared this recipe with fellow "rhubarb fans"-the cake is great with a little whipped cream on top of each serving. I had only half of the required nutmeg, so I added a little allspice. I was concerned about the thickness of the batter, but the cake came out tender and delicious.

This cake was very good. I added a little cinnamon to the flour mixture and substituted cinnamon for the nutmeg in the topping mixture. My grown daughter came in while the cake was still warm from the oven and ate almost a 1/4 of it and then took more home. I had planned on serving it with whipped cream or ice cream, but we liked it just the way it was. We love the crunchy/crispy topping. My only problem was that I had to bake it for about another 20 minutes or so (my oven's gone wacky lately). I laid a piece of foil over it during that time so the top wouldn't get too brown, therefore moistening up the top a little, so then I put it under the broiler for a few minutes and it crisped back up again. A keeper, Thanks!

I can't say that I was overwhelmed with this recipe.  It was very moist, even though the batter was somewhat stiff.  I had some left over rhubarb and decided to make something quick and easy for my dad since he really love rhubarb.  He seemed to enjoy the cake.  I guess I really only like rhubarb when it is mixed with strawberries to give it a sweeter taste.

Just like mom used to make!  My favorite growing up and now my son likes it, too.  Even easier to make than mom's because it uses sour cream instead of buttermilk-easy ingredients already on-hand.

Tastes great. I don't care for nutmeg...so the only thing I changed was replacing nutmeg for cinnamon. Will make this again for sure. I think I'll make a glaze with a little more cinnamon added to it...just for a little more sweetness. Only because I have a sweet tooth. To me, it has the consistency of bread pudding...which I love.

Very tasty and moist. Good balance between sweet and tart. The sugar topping adds a nice crunch. I, too, used 5 cups of rhubarb. FYI, the batter is like cookie dough because the moisture from the rhubarb as it cooks creates the liquid you would normally add in cake batter. Made it last night and took some to work, two people asked for the recipe.

Wasn't sure how sour cream added to anything rhubarb would taste, nevertheless, this cake is superb. The combination of brown sugar, sour cream and butter with the fresh rhubarb makes for a wonderfully delicious flavor that goes well with coffee &/or tea. The nutmeg mixed into the sugar topping, in my opinion, adds a unique flavor. For those whom don't care for the pungent flavor of nutmeg, substituting cinnamon would work just fine. The next time I make this delicious cake, will plan to cut down on the added brown sugar by just a bit (approximately 1/4 cup) as a matter of personal preference. 
Would give this recipe 5 stars.

By far, the best rhubarb recipe I have tried in a long time.  My family loved it.  I made the recipe exactly as stated with the exception of using cinnamon instead of nutmeg in the topping - just a personal preference.   The batter will be thick as other reviewers mentioned, but the result is a moist, delicious cake.   Thanks for sharing!

Excellent taste. Dense, moist cake. Substituted most of the butter with applesauce & used yogurt instead of sour cream. Could probably do with less sugar on topping.

This is an excellent rhubarb recipe. The dough is very, very stiff but the cake is extremely moist and delish! The only change I made was to switch the nutmeg out and use cinnamon. The topping makes a nice sugary crust on top.

As others mentioned a great way to use up Rhubarb and very TASTY as well.  As others suggested, I used the cinnamon in place of the nutmeg. I also added a cup of chopped nuts to the recipe.  Since it is so moist it is best if kept in the refrigerator after the first day.  Since there are only two of us, we don't eat it up fast enough to leave out on the counter.

This cake was very good.  I only had about 2-2 1/2 cups of rubarb on hand so I added about a cup of chopped strawberries. I was afraid it wouldn't be moist enough.  It turned out plenty moist but I think I still would like it better with the full amount of rubarb

We all loved this recipe. I had run out of nutmeg so I used cinnamon and then after I'd finished baking it I read all of the reviews that said to use it instead :) a happy accident.  In my oven this needed a bit longer than the 40 minutes. Apart from that my only difference was to leave out the salt, but that's just me! Thank you for a great recipe that will be used again and again

Couldn't be better!  My daughter's new favorite cake.  I did use the Streusel topping as suggested by another user and drizzled a very light amount of runny cream cheese icing over the top of each piece.  I'm also not a fan of nutmeg so I used the cinnamon.  But for those who do like nutmeg, I would make no changes to the recipe.  Delicious!

I followed the directions to the teeth except adding 1/2 cup more rhubarb just b/c that is what was left.  I gave it 4 stars only b/c the cake texture was good but way to much nutmeg for my taste.  The rhubarb flavor was WAY overpowered by it.  Update 2011:  Another spring-more rhubarb and I tried this again b/c I like the texture.  Made it as a cake good...does get soggy fast.  I made a batch of muffins and they were pretty wet.  Had to leave them in the muffin pan otherwise they fell apart.  They went into the freezer individually wrapped for a treat later.  If making muffins dice the rhubarb small.

Good coffee cake for brunch. I cut down on the sugar sprinkled on top by using a tea infuser to sprinkle across. Used 2 tablespoon instead of 1/3 cup this way. Best made ahead and allowed to cool overnight.

I made this for Mother's Day breakfast. I did use 5 (big) stalks (didn't really measure them). I also made a crumb cake topping (about 3-4 Tb. butter, 1/2 c - 3/4 c flour and maybe 1/2 c. of sugar (sorry, didn't measure). I'll be making this again! Glad for an easy recipe to use up rhubarb.

I ended up being just about 1/2 cup short on rhubarb, and it was still amazing.  I used 4 stalks but would recommend 4 1/2 or 5 in the future to get the full 4 cups.  I don't think it needs more than that.  The flavor of the rhubarb was clear.  I also used low-fat sour cream.    Despite what everyone else says, I thought it was best on the first day.  Wait 'til it's just cooled, and it's amazing.  It has a nice crispy top.  On the second day, it's still nice but it's something entirely different.  It's incredibly moist and the top is now mushy.  Still delicious, just different.  At this point, either finish it off or put it in the fridge. I put ours in the fridge so that it wouldn't develop mold (it was that moist and there's only 2 of us).    To me it's more like a quick bread that's the size of a cake.  I put the sugar and cinnamon (in place of nutmeg) on top, but it really didn't need that much sugar on top.  I think it would still have been amazing without any or at least half that much.    My husband said I should be sure to give this 5 stars.  He also wants me to give the recipe to his mother!  :)  I will definitely be making it again.

Halve the recipe and put in a 6 cup 6x8-inch rectangle baking dish. This size baking dish is perfect for making smaller cakes. Pyrex makes them. Be sure to get one with a lid for easy storage.

This was so good!  I only used 3 cups of rhubarb (it's all I had) and I used 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and added tbsp of butter to the topping.

Very yummy. I used 5 cups of fresh rhubarb instead of 4. I used the nutmeg in the batter instead of in the topping, and I used cinnamon in the topping. Since other reviews noted that the batter was very stiff, I alternated the additions of flour with the sour cream, so it was easier to mix. Nice with real whipped cream.

I had to half this recipe due to a shortage of baking pans, and it still came out perfect!  I also replaced half the nutmeg with cinnamon and the kitchen smelled wonderful while cooking.  My boyfriend, who is not big on deserts, actually stated this one was a keeper!  We also found the flavour much more developed the next day, but day one was scrumptious too! :-)  Thanks for the recipe and great review tips!

This cake was very moist.  I did add a bit extra rhubarb because I had a little left over.  I should have baked it a litle longer.  But the moistness made it tast fresher longer.  I also cut down on the brown sugar.  Only used a cup.  Its a bit more tart as a result, but we love the taste of rhubarb, so it was perfet for us.  Thanks!

Tastes more like muffins than a cake to me, but still good! Maybe it'd make a good muffin batter then someday! :)

This, by far, is the best coffee cake in my recipe collection.  I was raised on ranch/farm cooking, and rhubarb had a place of honor in our baking recipes.  I add 1 cup of toasted, chopped pecans for crunch.  Thanks for sharing this treasure of a recipe!

Easy and turned out great....I took it to a potluck and didn't have any leftovers!  I used frozen rhubarb, defrosted it and drained off all but 1/3 cup of the liquid, and it turned out great~

I loved this cake recipe.  It is so easy and simple. The only changes I made, I added 3 cups of rhubarb and 1 cup of raspberries.  Instead of the nutmeg I added cinnamon. I served this cake with vanilla ice cream. EVEN BETTER THE NEXT DAY!!!!!! This recipe is a keeper.

I added 1/4 applesauce because the batter was so dry I could not mix the dry with the wet.  I also had to add the sour cream earlier then suggested just to get everything mixed together.  It turned out great in the end.  Not too sweet, so it goes really nice with whipped cream.

This recipe was quickly gobbled up at our house, but could use less sugar.  The next time I make it, I will use 1 1/4 c. sugar and continue to substitute 1/2 c. yogurt for a 1/2 of the sour cream.

Great recipe! used organic ingredients including spelt flour...   I replaced sour cream with yogurt, also used less salt, 1/2 tsp baking soda and 1 tsp baking powder, and cinnamon/sugar topping. Tasted sour right after it was baked but was perfect the next day when flavours blended

This cake is so good!  The only thing I had to change was I baked it an extra 20 mins.  Half of the cake disappeared before it even cooled off.  The rhubarb I used was a bit tart but didn't subtract anything from the taste.  Thanks for a great recipe!  Definitely a keeper!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  When it came out of the oven, it looked like it actually needed to go back in for another 10 minutes, but I resisted.  I'm glad I did because the next morning the texture was perfect and still moist, but not as doughy.  With the vanilla added it reminded me of a fruity bread pudding.  This one's a winner!

OH MY GOODNESS! Very good, and I HATE rhubarb!  My 'make me a pie' husband even liked it.  The only thing I changed was to sub 1/2 the brown sugar for Splenda Brown sugar blend and added a tsp of cinnamon.  Have already made 3 times, once for work and nobody believed it was rhubarb.  Four asked for the recipe. Super recipe - in my recipe box -.

My neighbour dropped off a lot of rhubarb yesterday and I decided to make this cake.  When my husband got home from work he was upset that I was using the oven on such a hot day.  Until he tasted the cake.  He had some for dessert, for a bedtime snack and for breakfast.  Our kids haven't even had a chance to taste it yet and it is almost all gone. Excellent recipe.

Quick, easy and great! I used cinnamon instead of nutmeg for the topping. My kids ate it while it was still as hot as molten lava. I preferred it the next day.

I am not a confident baker.  I tried this recipe to see if it would turn out and also to impress my sister, who can bake anything.  It was really good and I served it with warm ice cream.  One thing that should be mentioned is the mixture is quite crumbly when adding the flour and it seemed there should be more liquid.  It was a bit hard to stir but the final outcome was success.  I would make again.

Extremely moist cake with more rhubarb than batter which was great.  Used no fat sour cream and it was delicious.  Great way to use up rhubarb.

I did use fat free sour cream mixed in after the butter,sugar,egg.  I think the glass baking dish was the answer to getting done in the time alloted.  I also used 1/4 C. sugar with cinnamon for the top.  Excellent cake!

This was very good, and so easy to make.  Longer baking time was required though. I baked an extra 15 mins. and at that point just turned the oven off and left the cake in. Also used cinnamon instead for topping that turned out sweet and crunchy.

Wonderful recipe.  Four of us ate nearly the whole thing!  Only disapointed that it didn't hold up real well.  The few leftwovers we had lost the light, crispy texture on the top that was so wonderful when I mmade it.  We served with whipped cream on top while still a little warm.  Yumm!

If I had rated this cake right after I made it I would have only given it 3 stars.  It is much better the next day.  I also added cinnamon to the batter and used it again instead of the nutmeg in the topping.  My whole family really liked it.

Mmmm...I served warm with vanilla bean ice-cream. I think it would work with fresh peaches or apples too. The batter is different than what I thought - i had to use beaters, just stirring didn't cut it.  It turned out yummy though.

This recipe is so simple and so delicious - the cake is very moist.  A great way to use up tons of rhubarb!

Very, good moist cake.  Was short of rhubarb so added some strawberries to make four cups of fruit.  W I'll definitely make again substituting different fruit for the rhubarb depended on what is in season.

I used frozen chopped rhubarb and I did not let it thaw completely. My dough ended up with a crumbly layer that was hard to get out of the mixing bowl. The recipe was easy, and I really enjoyed the simple sugar/nutmeg glaze. I will definitely make this one again.

Excellent!  Very moist.  I used freshly-ground nutmeg.  Was a change from cinnamon.  Served with vanilla ice cream.  Will definitely make again.

My sister sent me some rhubarb from Vermont, as it's impossible to get the stuff in Texas.  So I wanted to make something that was "rhubarb-worthy!"  Didn't want to waste that precious rhubarb!  This cake fit the bill!  I cut the recipe in half, since we're empty nesters, so I made an 8"x8" cake.  I used only 1/2 c. of brown sugar because I didn't want to cover up the taste of the rhubarb too much.  I also added the zest of one orange to the dry ingredients, since I always have oranges sitting around.  The batter was thick, but not cookie dough thick, so it was easily spreadable in the pan. For the topping, I mixed the sugar with 1/4 tsp. cinnamon, 1/8 tsp. nutmeg and 1/8 tsp. cardamom, then added 1/4 c. melted butter and spread it on the cake (didn't swirl it into the cake, but I might try that next time).  After baking and cooling, I sprinkled it with some confectioners' sugar, and it looked just like a funnel cake!  And the taste was perfect!  Definitely what I was looking for both texture wise and taste wise.  Rhubarb taste shown though, enhanced by the orange zest, cake was just sweet enough, cake was dense but not heavy.  A "rhubarb-worhy" cake!  Will make this every time I get my hands on some rhubarb!!

This was a real experiment, because I used unsweetened rhubarb sauce from my freezer. I partially removed some of the liquid by soaking it up in a paper towel. It was probably about 3 cups of sauce which I added. It came out very moist and dense and my husband loved it. The sugar topping was a bit sweet for my taste and I think next time I make this I’ll do a butter crumble topping instead. This will be so tasty with ice cream or whipped cream. I would also like to try some chopped walnuts in the cake. Yum!

I made this because I was looking for a quick and easy recipe that used what  I had.  The only change I made was to cut back on the nutmeg and I added cinnamon and a pinch of ginger to the topping.  It was delicious!  I would make it again.  I might add pecans to the topping to give it a little more crunch.

Fantastic! Love the crunchy topping! Sweet and tart at the same time. I also mixed the cinnamon into the batter. I used generous sized chunks of rhubarb.

The topping is WAY too much sugar. I cut the sugar back and will cut it even more when I make it again. Increased the rhubarb to five cups as suggested and mixed nutmeg and cinnamon for the topping.

I will definitely make it again.  Everyone I served it to liked it so much, I went out and bought some more rhubarb right away!

Because all the other reviewers commented on how thick the batter was, I added an extra tablespoon of melted butter to the batter.  Don't know if that gave it additional moisture, but I'll do it that way again.  I also followed the advice of those who suggested substituting cinnamon for the nutmeg in the topping and I added only a small pinch of nutmeg.  Would do that again too.  It's a great recipe, wonderful flavors and texture.  A keeper for sure!

I added an extra dollop of sour cream, just to finish the container and cinnamon instead of nutmeg. Our friends cam over and made strawberry ice cream in their ice cream maker to put with it. Incredible! Perfect! My favorite rhubarb dessert recipe yet.

For lovers of rhubarb, this a moist and delicious treat. It disappeared quickly. The next time I make it I think I'll try a little less nutmeg and perhaps a streusel topping in place of the white sugar.

I made 1/2 the recipe for an 8x8 pan and thanked the reviews for knowing ahead of time that the batter was going to be thick . This dish turned out delicious. I like the idea of adding  some butter to the topping next time I make it.

I wanted to use up my frozen rhubarb, so picked this recipe. Once the rhubarb thawed, there was a lot of fluid I wasn't sure if I should include. There also wasn't as much rhubarb as the recipe called for. Do you measure based on pre-freezing, or after thawing? I ended up using 2 cups thawed rhubarb and maybe 1/2 a cup of its juice, AND  2 cups thawed shredded zucchini, and about a 1/2 cup of its juice. The end product tasted pretty good (not overly tart, for those sensitive to rhubarb), but too sticky. I'd try less juice if I do it again.

Very nice moist cake. My husband especially loved it. .  Only change I made was to use cinnamon instead of nutmeg. Baking time was a little longer than stated but I think everyone has to judge their own oven time, just be sure not  to underbake or cake would probably be soggy as rhubarb is so full of  moisture. 
I have made this twice now and will add to my favorite recipes.

This is good and easy to make.  Next time, I will up the amount of rhubarb and add some lemon zest.  It does taste better the next day - almost like a bread pudding - more dense.  Topping with whip cream is optional.  Also, did not use as much sugar topping - used about 1/2.  Shared this at a Father's Day BBQ and it was very well received.

Such a great, moist cake!  And, something else to do with all the rhubarb in the spring.  I used vanilla greek yogurt instead of sour cream, and only added 1/4 tsp nutmeg.  I also added about 3 tsp. cinnamon to the topping.  It was superb!

Unfortunately my family and I didn't like this one.  We were really excited to try it with rhubarb from my grandfather's garden, but it just wasn't to our taste...

I cut the recipe in half and put it in an 8" square baking dish because the 9 x 13 is more than I need for a family of 3.  For those of you curious as to how I used 1/2 an egg, I just replaced the egg with eggbeaters.  This was a great way to use rhubarb which we just love, so I'm always looking for new ideas.  I too used cinnnamon for the top with the sugar and nothing else.  It is very sweet so maybe next time I will cut down on the sugar amount.  As others have commented, it is better the next day and has a consistency similar to a bread pudding vs. a cake.

We loved this!  i use oatmeal flour just because i prefer it.  it makes fantastic muffins.  i made a mistake on it the first time and put an extra 1/3 cup or so of sour cream.  it was a gooey cake, but just delicious if you heated it and put ice cream on it.  my husband likes the muffins with a bit of cream cheese.  i only use 1 cup of the brown sugar in it, not too wild about sweet things.  the oat flour is a great change and i can see this cake with italian plums or berries or any fruit!  the juice from the fruit really make this moist.  THANK YOU!

I wasn't keen on this because I didn't care for the texture and I expected more of a rhubarb flavour, although it was better the next day. I made it exactly as the recipe with no substitutions.  My husband really liked it, but I won't make it again. I think the appearance would have been more appealing with white sugar in the mix and brown sugar on top.

Excellent!  I didn't have enough rhubarb so I did 2 1/2 C Rhubarb and 2 1/2 C Apple.  I also added 1 tsp cinnamon right into the batter.  I also followed advice and stirred more butter into the top.  Everyone at the brunch loved it, I will definitely make this again.

Very good cake! I used whole wheat flour instead of AP, 3 cups of rhubarb because that is what I had, 1 tsp baking powder and 1/4 tsp baking soda to make it more cakey and less muffiny which a reviewer had noted. I also used 1/2 the sugar for the topping. My cake was baked in 32 minutes not 40.

Cake was very moist and the sugar crust was very good. I did increase the amount of rhubarb by 2 cups as I like the flavor a little more tart. It was perfect

Wow.  This was so much better than I expected.  I dont really like rhubarb and neither does my husband but I have it in the garden so thought I would give it a try.  Its moist and just has a really good taste and I am not sure why but it does.  So I will definitely make this again

Pretty good.  I followed the recipe closely, but used cinnamon and only a little sugar on top.  I also had to bake it about 10 minutes longer.  It was very moist, better texture and flavor the next day.  Good rhubarb flavor and not too sweet.  Good way to use up lots of rhubarb!  Thanks!

This recipe is the best way to eat rhubarb.  I can't stand rhubarb but we have a ton of it in the garden and my husband is always asking for it.  I found this recipe and am so happy that I decided to try it.  I did cut back a little on the rhubard and added strawberries from the garden just to get rid of them.  I will keep making with just rhubarb after the berries quit.  This is so good!

Wonderful ! I'm glad I read the reviews on this because it is VERY thick when you put it into the pan. I made 3 loaves instead on one big cake and I used cinnimon istead of nutmeg, very yummy! Everyone always gives me rhubarb and I try to pawn it off on others, now Im asking people for excess rhubarb to make this cake!

the cake never cooked.  I left it in 1/2 hr. longer.  I thinkj the rhubarb made too much water.  I tried to compensate, but it didn't work.  I will not make this again.
