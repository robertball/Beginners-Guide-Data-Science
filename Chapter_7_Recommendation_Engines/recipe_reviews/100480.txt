Man. This is SO good. Potent, though.
It reminds me of a Long Island, only with fruit. Be careful, one'll do you in.
(I did use raspberry vodka and Captain's Tattoo rum, as that's what I had on hand.)

OMG Greatest mixed drink ever!! We added Blue Caraco and called it the Twisted Stripper with Blue Panties. Be careful its a creeper. Highly recommend this drink if you like blue hawaiians or long island iced teas.

I used crown, patron silver, Bacardi, peach Smirnoff, razzmatazz, Malibu rum, grand Marnier peach raspberry (in lieu of triple sec), sprite and pineapple juice. It was yummy and super easy to make.
