This recipe was great by itself, but when I added an 8 oz package of cream cheese and served it with honey wheat pretzel twists and black bread toast points, it was gobbled up by all of the guests!

This was a very quick and very tasty recipe.  I also used this spread on the Eggplant and Pepper sandwhiches listed on this site... they were AWESOME!  

I believe you're supposed to use the liquid from the can of olives but I had already drained the olives before I realized that.  So I added water to replace the liquid and it still came out quite tasty.

I put in too much garlic so it came out bitter, but overall it was good and I'm sure it had potential to be better if it were not for the extra garlic.

I read the first review and just made this without draining the can of olives (probably would have otherwise) and it turned out very runny, definitely not a spread,  we will have to try using it as a dip instead. It looks like an olive smoothy! I tried a bit, it tastes okay, but too salty for my taste, maybe wouldn't have been so salty if drained and rinsed olives first.

I used this in my "eggplant and pepper parmesan" sandwiches.  It turned out great! Since the market I went to was actually out of canned olives, I got some Turkish olives from the deli.  I had to make this in my blender, and so I had to use more oil than indicated.  Thanks!

Excellent, loved it made it for New Years bowl party, took some suggestions and added green onions.  Think it would be better with Scoops style tortillia chips.

If you like olives, olive oil and garlic you CANNOT go wrong.  Served this with wine and crackers and yummo!  Fast and easy in my mini food processor.

A good start but really watery. I'm not sure if you are supposed to drain the cans or not. Perhaps ok for a sandwich but on a cracker alone, not so much...

VERY good with items in your pantry! I did one batch with one clove (for a party) and one batch with two (used my mini processor). Loved the two-clove batch, but the one clove batch is better for friends. EXCELLENT!

I used vegan "parmesan cheese" and added a little salt and vinegar, and perhaps too much extra oil. 

This is so yummy! 
It really needs a small garnishing sprig and a sprinkle of paprika or something to offset the olive color and its tendency to seperate from the oil.
 This is a wonderful dip.

I love this recipe but I too added a brick of cream cheese and green onions to make it a thicker spread.  I spread on flour tortillas and stacked into three layers.  I cut into triangles and they make a great appetizer or party food.

I found it to be a little strong in flavor, but delicious anyway. Next time I will try to add a little Greek yogurt to the mix. I think that might make the flavor a little less strong and add some creaminess to it.

I wanted to LOVE this dip.  It just wasn't good.  I made it exactly as written.  Tastes like mashed up black olives. I bought greek yogurt; I will try to mix some in and see if it helps it. :(

i thought this spread was really great.  it was simple and easy to make.  the only thing i would suggest would be to change the type of olive used.  my fiancé is an olive freak and thought that the canned olives gave the spread a metallic taste.  i would use olives from a glass bottle.  but thanks; i will be making this again.

WOW! This was great.  The price of olives are low now because of Thanksgiving so I doubled the batch.  I did add more garlic and a 1 tsp. of basil

I was looking for a simple, last-minute appetizer recipe to serve with pita chips instead of hummus, and this filled the bill. Though the recipe doesn't say so, drain the olives before putting them in the food processor.

Great tasting and so easy!  I use whatever canned black olives are cheapest and up the garlic to 2-3 cloves (I like garlic).  Great on "eggplant and pepper parm" sandwiches, as other reviewers have said.  I also tried some on the "portobello sandwich" from this site, and I liked it in place of the seasoned mayo.

Great simple mix that everyone has the ingredients to.  I added some feta to the mix, but it turned it too salty.  Re did it with a little bit of fresh Thai basil in it and it was fantastic.

This worked out great on the wonderful Eggplant and Pepper Parmesan Sandwiches as suggested by a previous reviewer.  Used instead of the tapenade, and because I used just regular black olives (like Lindsay) it was far less salty.  Thanks!
