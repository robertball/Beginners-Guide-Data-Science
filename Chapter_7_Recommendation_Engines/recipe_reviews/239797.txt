The flavour of these cookies is nice, but the recipe simply didn't work out for me. I used Best All-Purpose Gluten-Free Flour Blend from this website. I ended up adding two more Tbsp of tapioca flour because the "dough" (actually a batter) was so liquid. I feel there is something missing here. It definitely needs less liquid or more flour and I feel there is simply too much sugar for the amounts of the other ingredients. I used a medium egg at room temp. I even used powdered vanilla instead of liquid. I put the mixture in the fridge for 10 minutes but still, it spread out so much on the baking sheet that it became one big, flat bar instead of 12 cookies. It also stuck to my lightly greased parchment paper and didn't cook thoroughly even though I left it in the oven for almost 15 minutes. I waited 10 minutes before even attempting to cut them into single servings. They never crisped. They taste good. I think more flour and less sugar would aid here. Thank you Michelle2s for your recipe.
