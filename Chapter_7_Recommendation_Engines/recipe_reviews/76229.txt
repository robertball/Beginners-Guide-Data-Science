I made this for my grandmother who is Dibetic and it was a good pie to be 
sugarless. But next time I may add a little more splenda. By her request.

Excellent recipe - a wonderful blend of tart & sweet.  I have made apple pies for years, and this is so delicious and so easy to make that I'm going to use it for my main apple pie!

We baked this for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit among our guests. There were no leftovers and everyone asked that we bake another one to share at our family Christmas celebration.
