I also made this soup because everyone in my household had a cold.  It definitely helped (garlic is a natural antibiotic).  Here are some things the recipe doesn't tell you:  3/4 cup of garlic = about two full bulbs (not cloves, bulbs).  Sautee the garlic until some of it just begins to brown (this is the "color" it references).  Sautee the garlic slowly or else it will get bitter and stir constantly or else it will stick.  Preparing and cooking the garlic is the most labor intensive part of the recipe.  I used about 1.25-1.5 cups diced potatoes (about 3 medium sized ones) to help thicken which is quite a bit more than what is called for.  Also to thicken the soup and make it more of a bisque add two rounded tablespoons of corn starch (or 4 tbls flour) before pureeing.  If your blender has a "whip" cycle, use it.  Let it whip/puree for a good 5 minutes (you might have to do half at a time); this will help make that whipping cream do its job.  Next return the soup to the pan and boil for 1 minute; this will help the corn starch/flour do what it does best.  This soup came out SO good!  The flavor was mild, but then again I'm Italian and immune to garlicâ€™s pungency.  I think if you like garlic you'll love this creamy version of the soup.  If you don't like garlic, don't try this, it's not for you.  It will help a cold if you have one or help prevent one if you feel one coming on.  My whole family loved this with warm rolls and butter!  I hope you enjoy it too!

I have been looking for a garlic soup recipe that tasted like some I had in New Orleans.  This was it.  It was not difficult to make and tasted heavenly.  Not too strong but that depends on what type of garlic you use.  My family and coworkers loved it.  The extra time it takes to make this soup is worth it.

Very yummy.  A keeper for sure. I didn't use the wine(replaced with more broth).  I think next time I'll cut back on the cream and add a little more potato, it could have been a tad bit thicker.  Time consuming to make, but worth it.

This didn't seem to be as much work as some of the others suggested.  Maybe I just knew that it would be worth it so it didn't bother me.

Some of the other reviewers also suggested that this recipe might be to runny.  I followed the recipe exactly (with the exception of using more broth instead of wine) and it turned out just like we had experienced on our cruise vacations.  

This is great served out of bread bowls!!  Thanks for the recipe.

This is an amazing recipe!  The house smelled great while it was cooking, and the taste of the soup lived up to the promise of the aroma!  I used non-fat milk, but the soup was still creamy and flavourful.

This was so good.  I went on a cruise last week and had some so I knew I had to find a recipe for me to be able to make it at home.  I followed the recipe almost exactly except I did add more potato because I didn't want to throw out the excess.  I used two bulbs (not cloves) of garlic and one large russet potato.  Be careful when you puree the soup because the whipping cream expands.  I would advise doing half and then the other half.  My roommate has been raving about how great it is, but it is VERY garlic-y so if you don't like garlic, keep away.  Our apartment smells great.  Very easy recipe.  Most of the time is just waiting around for things to simmer, so it did take longer then I expected, but was worth it.  Will definitely make again.

This is the second time I've made this soup.  Here's what I did this time.  I skipped the cream and the wine and added probably the same amount in potatoes.  Then I pureed with my hand blender till I got the thickness I wanted.  Good soup! BTW...made this because I had a cold.  It fixed all my problems!  LOL

This is very good.  I used 3 cups of bouillon and 
only 1/2 cup wine and it was perfect.  My 5 year olds even enjoyed it.  My husband loved it.  I used red wine instead bec. that's all I had and the color still came out cream.  We will definitely make this one again and again.
It tastes like something I had in Europe with clams in it.  One day, I'll add clams and difinitely add more potatoes.  thanks.

Since being a vegetarian I made homemade veggie stock 2 days before making this soup. Delish! I told a lady checker at the grocery store I was making garlic soup and she "I never heard of such thing".  Wow, if you aren't enjoying this soup then your are missing one of life's little pleasures.

if garlic doesn't scare you this is a rare and special soup. I never look for "Really quick" recipes since one doesn't need to stand and watch the soup cook anyway, but it's fairly quick and very good!i tasted this somewhere and didn't quite know how to start - and found it here.
thanks, Holly!

If you love garlic you'll love this soup.  I think I might like to add some pasta to it - but no reason to change it.  My husband wants to try it with clams?????  It was very good with warm buttered French bread!

My HS French teacher used to take us to a local fine dining inn for a special "french" meal and Garlic Soup was always on the menu.  Sadly, the restaurant changed owners/directions and I've never again come across "Garlic Soup" on any menus.   I reached out to fellow cooks here on the Buzz and one of them (I'm sorry I forget who!) recommended this recipe as a possible jumping off point.  A couple of years later, I just finally got around to making it.  Wow.  Amazing.  This soup is fantastic!  I followed the recipe to a "T", w/the small exception that I did not measure my EVOO to start.  I also had no need to add salt/pepper at service.  Oh, and I'm lazy, so I used my immersion blender rather than a blender to puree the soup.  It was on the borderline of being too garlicky, so I think I will ever so slightly decrease the garlic next time as well as slightly increase the potato.  There WILL be a next time.  THANKS for the amazing recipe, MARBALET, and I apologize for the lackluster photo.  THere'll def be no vampires at the LTH house tonight!

To emphasize what others have said - you have to love garlic to love this.  How I differed from the recipe - I added 2 shallots that I needed to use up, and a little over a cup of potato (didn't see the point in not using the whole thing) and I used 1/2 and 1/2 because that's what I had.  Also ended up adding about a teaspoon of sugar as the garlic was a little bitter even though I didn't burn it - I think a few of the cloves were past their prime.  Added about 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley before I blended everything, as well as 2 tablespoons of flour.  Next time I think I'll add twice as much potato.  I have a feeling this will be even better tomorrow.  A word of caution - this takes longer to make than the time stated, especially if you're peeling your own garlic.  When all was said and done it took me about 2 hours, maybe a little more, but it was worth it.

It was delicious, the only thing I changed though was the amount of garlic. I used a whole cup instead, because in my family you can never use to much garlic. It turned out fantastic.

WOW this is really good. I wound up with a bitter bulb of garlic so I am sure it would rate higher. I like my soup with something to munch on so I added after puree mushrooms, broc and more potatoes.

I made this tonight. Very tasty. I bought a BAG of garlic bulbs from the farmers market and needed a soup and potato recipe that would help me use the garlic up. Well... this one did. Was getting scared as it uses at least 2 full bulbs but once it was made it wasn't over powering at all. Granted you must like garlic to dive into this one and I do! I forgot to get cream at the store so I increased my milk to 3C and added an extra potato so I could get the creaminess of the soup. I also added some mild Italian sausage as my husband doesn't think of soup as a meal. Turn out great and it was soooo easy I'm definitely going to make this one again!

I loved this soup and will definitely make it again.  I did however change it slightly.  I added about 3 cupes of cubed potatoes and 2 cups of wine.  I did not puree my soup and used a potatoe masher instead.  It still had a bit of texture that way.  I cooked it an extra 15 minutes because after I mashed with the potatoe masher I added a bunch of chopped Kale and cooked it for the additional 15 minutes.  It was ssoooo good.  As for the smell...WOW...is all I can say.  My son is still mad at me.  Thanks Holly for a great recipe.

This was the starter for Xmas dinner and it went over very well with everyone. I cut down the garlic to one head and used Trader Joe's truffle oil instead of regular olive oil.  After I started the recipe I realized that my spuds were bad so after browning the garlic I added a chopped,small head of cauliflower and 2 shallots and sauteed them a bit longer.  I then added the chicken broth, wine, salt and cayenne and simmerd that until the veges were tender.  I then pureed it in the Cuisinart and then added a pint of half and half and held it for a hour over a low flame.  (It held really well.)  My 12 y/o thought a bit of scallop or lobster would have been a good addition.  It was garlicky but not overpowering, rich and creamy but not too heavy.  I would make it again but next time I might try fat-free half and half so it would be ok for SBD.

This was really good, and pretty easy to make. You definitely want to puree this before eating, otherwise the soup can be rather watery. It was very garlicky, which I like, I let me co-worker try a spoonful and the garlic almost knocked her over.

Cleaning the garlic takes a long, long time, and even though I love garlic, this soup tasted too strongly of garlic. It is definitely not worth the time you have to invest in making this soup.

Excellent dish.  Substitute heavy whipping cream with milk to make for a more lean soup and this is still a delicious recipe, there is enough flour to thicken it up.  (Otherwise I followed the directions).  I will make this again.

Very good cream soup!  I used a creamy chicken slow cooker recipes then added rice.  Then I made this soup and added it to it.  I have enough to feed an army but it was very good.

Very good, but believe it or not it could have used more garlic! :-)  I sauteed a stalk of celery, finely chopped, then added the garlic.  I put the potatoes in with the broth & wine so they'd actually be fully cooked, and added bay scallops for the last few minutes.  Yum!!!

Made this twice.  First time was just like the recipe.  It's very garlicky which I loved but the rest of the family thought was too much.  The second time I roasted the garlic and omitted the wine and added more stock. It was very good.  Very, very good!!!  It was still garlicky but it was a more mellow flavor.

If you're the kind of person that puts garlic into nearly everything you cook, you'll love this recipe. If not, don't bother. From other reviews, I figured that you either love this recipe or hate it. I loved it! The ONLY change I made was to add about twice the amount of potato the recipe called for as other reviewers suggested. Next time, i think I might add some celery to the garlic and maybe some fresh herbs, like parsley. Overall, we loved it! Thanks!

Halved the recipe. Added a tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken the cream a little bit. I do love garlic, i really do, but didn't like this, ok, it's edible, but...well... it's kind of boring. Served this with homemade croutons but they didn't help too much.

This soup was not only watery even tho I added more potatoes than called for, the taste wasn't that good either.
With the cost of the wine, heavy cream, and other ingredients I think it is very expensive to make.
It is also very high in calories.
Will not be making this again.

This soup is great.  I use so much garlic that I buy it from Sam's Club already peeled, so it was no problem.  I used chicken base, which worked fine.  Instead of cooking the milk/cream with potatoes (I doubled the amount of potatoes), after I pureed it, I put in maybe 3/4 C. half and half and it came out very nicely.

This soup was terrific (gotta like garlic a lot).  I didn't have any wine and still it was delicious!  I found it just a bit too creamy for my taste so I added a bit more milk.....about 3/4cup.  As for the smell in the house, well, that was a bit hard to take and about six hours later I could still smell it on my jacket that was hanging in the kitchen. Anyway, I truly enjoyed this soup and will definately make it again.

This tasted just ok. The main problem I had was it was too runny. I had to add cornflour to thicken it up. If I was to make again I would reduce the liquid by half and increase the potato.

This soup was AWESOME!  I'm a garlic lover, which you really have to be in order to truly enjoy the soup's potency.  It was very smooth and creamy.  I served it with warm french bread - what a hit!  May also be yummy thinned a little with some fresh veggies added.  Will definitely make again!

Left out the wine...was taking cold medicine at the time so didnâ€™t want a double whammy.  Delicious.  I had it with hard bread.  After a big bowl, bundled up, went to bed and let the garlic do its thing.  Youâ€™ll sweat garlic but feel so much better afterwards. Make sure your loved ones understand the reason you stink...lol.  For science and health

The flavor was good. I added 2 bay leaves and some fresh thyme with the stock and wine.

However, the soup was way too thin- it needed much more potato to make it the right consistency.

It's good...i added 2 cups of potatoes which gave it a thicker consistency like other reviewers suggested.  It will be a good winter soup.  Makes a lot of soup so will probably decrease ingredients by half next time.  I served with shredded cheddar cheese sprinkled on top.

I have a similar recipe from some gourmet friends and it's long been a family favorite. A couple of things that may be helpful to people who complained about the time it takes:
1. Williams-Sonoma (and probably many other kitchen shops) sells an open tube of green rubbery plastic that is ideal for quickly peeling multiple cloves. You can insert several, roll it back and forth, and the peeled cloves just tumble out. Some enterprising person could probably replicate this effect with . . . oh, one of those rubberized jar openers or something.
2. I skip cooking the garlic in oil and just simmer it in the broth, which saves a step and cuts back on fat. It still tastes fabulous.
3. We also add about two baked potatoes, and use an immersion blender.

I just made this soup and I think it needs more potatoes and maybe another veggie and some meat in there too. I liked that it was kind of sweet tasting and really creamy. Next time I'll ad more to it though.

A very nice soup. Like many others, I have tweaked it a little although I must confess that some of the tweaking was accidental.  I used (by mistake) 1 lt of chicken stock and as such had to reduce the other fluids accordingly to prevent it being too runny. And it still turned out perfectly.
The following is my amended ingredient list:
â€¢2 large full bulbs of garlic
â€¢3 tablespoons olive oil 
â€¢1 litre chicken stock â€“ made with stock cubes
â€¢175ml red wine 
â€¢400ml milk
â€¢250g Brocolli â€“ remove stalks
â€¢250ml of half fat cream (Demi Cream)
â€¢3 medium sized potatoes - cooked and quartered
â€¢salt and pepper, plus a dash of ground chili
â€¢4 tbls plain flour â€“ used before pureeing.
The cooking process was the same. I did take the advice of other contributors and add flour before pureeing and returning the pureed mix to heat for 2-3 minutes before serving. I also added extra potato and brocolli head.
My girlfriend's comment: "The Best Soup Ever!".
Guys, if your wife/girlfriend loves garlic, then this soup will certainly impress them.
I have frozen all the extra that i made and can only hope that it survives this.
Thanks Holly + the other contributors who have tweaked this great recipe.

This recipe is a really easy one to customize. I use half & half instead of heavy cream, first of all. Secondly, this recipe is fantastic if you add veggies. I cook onions separately. Puree it early, then add the cooked onion, a half head of cauliflower, and 2 zucchinis. Simmer them about 15 min, very VERY gently so you don't curdle the milk and cream.

This has a very strong garlic flavor.  The whole house smelled like garlic.  I really liked it, my husband thought the garlic was too strong.  I added flour to it to thicken it, I also added a stick of butter for flavor.  I will probably make again.
