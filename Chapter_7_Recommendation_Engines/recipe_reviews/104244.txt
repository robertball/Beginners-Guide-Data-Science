I used cream cheese (I have no access to marscapone) and the sauce was anything but light.  I did add an additional 1/4 c liquid, but it was still one big clump of noodles that you needed a knife to separate into individual servings.  My husband thought this was exceptionally good - I thought it just tasted okay.  I added a can of diced tomatoes to the leftovers for both taste and nutritional value, but still wasn't wild about this. I think some fresh basil or other Italian herbs may have helped.
