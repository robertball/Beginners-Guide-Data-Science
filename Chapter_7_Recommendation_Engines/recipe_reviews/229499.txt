OMG, this was so good it didn't even get to the table.  I scarfed it up on the hoof...  Because of my food sensitivities, I omitted the black and cayenne peppers; left out the fines herbes because I didn't have them; doubled the fresh ginger; and used a bit of cumin and garam masala in lieu of curry powder.   I don't know from two pounds, so I used one bunch of my csa baby bok choy.  It was my one-course meal.  I ate the garlic and ginger slices for dessert.

next time i may try for a sit-down meal and have a very simple fish or chicken filet, minimally seasoned (the bok choy says it all), to accompany.

This bok choy recipe is fantastic!  I did quadruple the hot pepper, microplaned a ton of frozen ginger into it and it was spicy-good.  Now I want to use this spice mixture on chicken wings, lamb kabobs, winter squash, white potatoes, etc.  It is OMG good. Thanks!

i dont think i can give this a fair rating as i've tweaked the hell out of the recipe.. but i'd still like to share what i did to make this enjoyable with the ingredients i had on hand.. i used regular cabbage, light soy sauce instead of liquid amino acid, 1 t of dried ginger since i didnt have fresh, savory in place of fines herbes, and salt to taste instead of pepper to taste.. i also added a dollup of sour cream at the end.. i *might* make this for bf if im in an adventurous mood..

We enjoyed this. I didn't measure the spices - just sprinkled with salt, tumeric, curry, basil, three cloves of garlic (for one big head of bok choy) and drizzled with olive oil. Took a bit longer than 10 minutes for some of the thicker stalks to become tender and most of them were pretty chewy despite the leaves being crisp. I liked the contrast of textures though. I would make this again.

While it is probably healthy as can be I just didn't care for the flavor or texture.

Great recipe!  Next time I will cut the bok choy in smaller pieces.  Thank you for the suggestion of soy sauce...I have no idea what Amino Acid is to cook with and I used low sodium soy sauce.  I did not add fine herbs because I don't know what they are.  I am Italian and fine herbs to me are garlic, parsley and oregano!!!  I am going to try the suggestion of beans, rice and tofu. Thank you

Really liked this! Has lots of great flavor. I used fresh turmeric and skipped the fines herbs because I didn't have them.

We usually grill bok choy, found this recipe , made pretty much as stated but omitted curry, and significantly increased ginger, garlic and red pepper flakes...as suggested used soy sauce, would advise low salt soy sauce.  Finally, I think a higher temp would help give it a more roasted texture- next time Iâ€™ll try 450 o4 so.

This was a bit on the dry side. I recommend stirring the greens once or twice while cooking or adding a bit more liquid. Great flavor!

This recipe is easy and delicious!  I substituted soy sauce for the amino acid and 1 teaspoon of jarred ginger for the fresh. It tasted fabulous!  It is a nice change of pace from saute or stir fry
