This recipe is not even fair!  Too, too, too good.  As suggested in some other reviews, I made it ahead of time and then placed in the fridge until I warmed it to serve.  I made a double batch and 14 women ate most of it.  The little that remains is preciously guarded for steaks tonight and maybe biscuits in the morning.  Too delicious!!!

I made this and took it to a dinner party and everyone enjoyed it. I didn't put it in a crock pot, as it went too fast and I didn't have to try and keep it warm. I added a bit of hot sauce to the mushroom mix to give it a bit more punch and I served it with some crusty french bread. Six people finished off this amount easily.

this is a  mushroom stroganoff-obviously a good recipe. try this twist.make a light roux of butter and flour.set aside.  finely dice mushrooms and saute in butter w/ some chopped parsley & a small clove of garlic grated in at end, deglaze pan with a tsp or 2 of sherry to which you add a cup of heavy cream in place of sour cream. cook over low heat stirring constantly, adding a tsp or so of roux at a time until the mixture is fairly thick. let cool. this is the basis for stuffing into mushroom caps that have been pre sauteed, cooled and then topped with freshly shredded parmesan cheese. bake in  medium hot oven until cheese is melted, about 10-15 min. if you like escargots this  recipe is incredible with a snail or 2 stuffed into each of the  holes in an escargot dish, then fill with mushroom mixture and top whole dish with lots of the fresh grated parm. bake 20 min in hot oven-serve with hot crusty French bread.this is to die for!

This was very good, but it did almost seem more like a sauce for steak/burgers than a dip.  But regardless...very tasty.  For dipping purposes, I just recommend dicing the mushrooms instead of using slices.  Large mushroom pieces made it hard to scoop.

I made this for a gathering of neighbors the other night & they devoured it!  I had to email the recipe to everyone the next day.  They really liked that it was a different type of appetizer.  I added garlic powder; made it the night before to let the flavors mix; & served it with warm crusty french bread & garlic bagel chips.  It is a snap to make & brought rave reviews!

Excellent and addictive. This would be awesome on steak or chicken. We enjoyed the mess out of it with chewy Italian bread. A little hot sauce isn't a bad idea, but it's great as-is, too. Thanks!

This spread was oh-so good! It was also extremely quick and easy to prepare. I added some herbs( Thyme, rosemary, Italian seasoning, onion powder, garlic powder, and white pepper) just to give it a more elegant feel. This was one of the best appetizers I have ever tasted. WILL be making when I entertain next.

I made this over a year ago for the first time. It's simply wonderful. In this year I've made it at least 6 times, varying it a bit each time. 

I sometimes add garlic, sometimes chopped fresh or even dried parsley or both. I added thyme once but not sure whether I liked it.  I've served it with steak, on top of hamburger patties, on toasted French bread, crackers, fresh buns. The possibilities are endless. I'm going to try it on a baked potato next.

Oh yes, almost forgot. A friend (who got the recipe from me) made this into a filling for puff pastry that lined mini muffin cups. Topped it with tons of cheese and baked. Absolutely divine and so fitting for the semi-formal coctail party she hosted. 

Thank you for such a versatile recipe.

This was a wonderful spread. I used french bread with it instead of crackers. It was a huge hit for the holidays. Thanks

Apparently this was devoured and many did not get a chance to taste it and that included myself. I was directed by my brother to make it again since he had none either. I did modify somewhat. I had doubled the recipe and added 2 cloves of minced garlic, one large minced shallot and a friend added some "Awww !" seasoning although I don't know how much. I chilled it overnight and then added the green part of green onion and a fistful or so of the Parm cheese...baked it...and the next thing I knew it was gone.   : (    Will make again and WILL get a bite!!!   : )

I made this as everyone suggested with less sour cream but otherwise followed to the letter.  It does taste kind of like mushroom soup.  I added two cloves of garlic and quite a bit of tabasco (didn't measure).  It was much better that way.

This recipe is very tasty but hard to manage on a cracker.  I followed another reviewer's advice to chop  up the mushrooms but we found it to be fairly runny.  After it cooled a bit, it was easier to serve and eat without dropping it on our shirts!  Really good though!

Yummy. Needs a bit more than a pinch of salt. Make the night before for sure, easy for how delicious and impressive. Served with sour dough & pumpernickel mini loaf. Big hit. went fast.

Delicious!  We plan to use this to top our steaks.  I made it 5 hours in advance so it would have time for the flavors to mingle a bit... but I don't know if it will make it to dinner, it's that good!

Followed this recipe to a T and we loved it!  It was just what I expected and did not disappoint.  My boyfriend really liked it also.  Served this with homemade French bread (from AR) and it made a great appetizer for Christmas Eve!

I forgot to saute the mushrooms first because I was assembling a whole bunch of things at the same time.  The flavors never developed.  I think it would be great if I would have done that though!

I served with sliced baguette bread & it was devoured. I added 1/4 cup of wine and minced garlic, and the flavor was sublime. A nice hearty appetizer.

excellent, I served it as side dish/sauce on roasted meat, not as an appetizer on crackers. It works famously with simple, not-so-expensive champignon mushrooms, otherwise quite bland and boring:-)

This was a delicious and easy spread, well received at my Christmas celebrations.  I wouldn't call the flavor "buttery", the overwhelming flavor is definitely sour cream.  Made exactly as written with the exception of adding some parmesan directly to the mix, too.  Thanks, I enjoyed trying your recipe.

This was quite good and went over well with my girlfriends.  The only change I made was to mix in some shredded Italian 5 cheese blend.  I then sprinkled just a tad on with the parmesan.  The only change I may make in the future is to add just a little less sour cream- maybe 1/2 to 3/4 cup?  Overall, though, it was very good.

I had a whole pan of leftover baked spaghetti and I made this to go on the bread. I followed the recipe exactly but spread it onto a french loaf and baked it that way. This was excellent.

Excellent. Very creamy and delicious. Can't wait to try it after it has set for a day to let the flavors meld together.

This was really tasty; I may try using cream of mushroom instead of sour cream next time. I will also let it sit in the fridge prior to baking for a few hours, as the mushroom taste wasn't that strong (but definitely identifiable).

I had high hopes with the reviews. But I didn't enjoy it as a dip. I only made the 8 serving size, I was going to double it, but glad I didn't. I had a little left from the party. But with 62 attendees I expected it vanish.

Chopped mushrooms, and cooked in a little crock pot, had to add a little extra flour to thicken.  But everyone loved it, only a little left by the time dinner was served.

AS suggested I chopped the mushrooms small and made it ahead to allow the flavours to meld. However, I needed to add cornstarch to thicken the sauce before serving it as a dip.

It is good but I wish it were a tad more liquid. Maybe I overbaked it but keeping warm in a crockpot is definitely a good idea.

I made this spread for myself and two other ladies. I did not think this was enough for us three as a solid snack. I would double to the recipe if I were to make this again. I also would dice the mushrooms prior to cooking them. I happen to have sprinkled the top with garlic salt and it was a great touch. I would make this dish again. It would be great for a game day dish.

this is  amazingly good- perhaps even better heated up later. I have found that I pretty much always have to make double the recipe. Have eaten on toasted baguettes, crackers, and topped steak and mashed potatoes with the spread. WOW

My assistant and I used this recipe to celebrate the first day of autumn today in our pre-k class.  The kids loved chopping the shrooms but didn't seem to care for their aroma! LOL!  Nonetheless, most of them tried it and liked it but we LOVED it!  Used a LOT more butter than called for so it was really delish and tres Julia Childs!

Excellent recipe as it stands. I've also made it with the addition of finely chopped bacon and a TBSP of cream cheese after deglazing the pan with white wine. It's amazing!!

I minced the mushrooms instead of slicing because I thought it'd make it easier to spread on crackers, and it did. I also added about 3/4 cup of chardonnay at the end and cooked it off for a few minutes. My in-laws lapped it up, like seals at feeding time!

I think this may have been better had the cheese been mixed in before baking to give the flavor a little more depth.  I think it's better suited for pasta or chicken - but it was good!

This is one of my new favorites, I have made it 3 or 4 times in the last month.  Everyone has raved about it every time. It is excellent, almost tastes like a stroganoff but without the beef... great on wheat thins.

I pulled this out of my favorites this morning to make it for probably the 10th time in the last couple years and figured it was time to leave a review. This is, without a doubt, the simplest dish to make that will garner the ravest reviews at the party!  I usually have all of the ingredients on hand.  You can use a nice sourdough slice or the most basic of crackers...the star is always the rich depth of flavor in the creamy dip.  The only change I’ve made is that I use baby portabellos if they are on sale or look better than the white mushrooms when I shop.

I used sliced flat mushrooms, keeping them chunky as I wanted to serve on rounds of French bread. It was nice, would be ideal to make the day before as others have said, if I knew I was going to be busy. I thought the sour cream might taste odd but it wasn't bad.

I followed the recipe, with a couple added ingredients.  I added garlic powder at the end and also put some freshly shredded parmesan into the mix.  I used a 50/50 mix of parmesan and mozzarella cheeses on top to give it a deeper flavor and increased the amount of cheese by a third. Before I realized it, the spread was totally gone!  This is one I will make again!

Absolutely the best little tastefully delicious dip that makes a great appetizer at the dinner table! It's the most requested dip when I visit friends and family. "Can you make that mushroom dip, I didn't get enough of it the first time!" Is the comment I always get when I make it.  Tip: I don't add in the pepper and salt! It's flavorful without it!

What else can I say that everyone else said. I made this for our last family get together, every bit was gone, will be making again, its best over bread,we ate it with crackers too. Next time I will get some french bread,that sounds amazing. It also was so easy and fast to make too.

I made this over the weekend for a party that I was hosting and it was delicious.  This was so easy to make.  The only thing I would do different is put it in a little crock pot, so that it stays warm.

Fantastic!  I love mushrooms.  What a perfect appetizer!  The only thing differently was to finely chop the mushrooms, as noted in other reviews.  Loved it!  We'll be enjoying this all summer!

I used olive oil (in addition to the butter) to saute the m&o.  I added garlic powder during the saute (b/c I meant to add real garlic and forgot).  I only used about 1/2 a cup of sour cream based on the reviews of others (and I probably could have done a little less than that even). While I seasoned the m&o during the saute portion, found that it needed more so I put out the salt & pepper shakers for my guests.  Finally, I served it with fresh italian bread, sliced, with a drizzle of olive oil, toasted in the oven during the last 5 or so minutes of cooking.  It was very tasty.

Rich, warm, wonderful!  It was a huge hit, and the little that was leftover was amazing over grilled steaks the next night.  Will definately make this again!

Great recipe, I make something similar myself except I omit the parmesan cheese and add a little garlic and fresh chopped parsley and a dash of hot sauce. This is great over garlic bread with a salad for lunch. It's one of DH's favourite meals.

Great spread!  I halved the recipe because I didn't have enough mushrooms on hand and I didn't have enough sour cream so I added 1/4C of marscapone cheese.  It turned out well.  Served it on crostini.  I will definitely make again.

This is GREAT! I made it twice during the Holidays for my family! Two things I did was to add cheddar to the mushroom mix and then again to the top. Also, I minced the mushrooms so it had a smoother consistance versus chunky.

Very good! I used three different types of mushrooms such as Chanterelle, Portabella and the regular white ones, the combinations just gave a fantastic taste. You can use the same combination in another recipe: Hungarian mushrooms soup.

It tasted pretty good and went pretty quickly but I didn't love how it looked. If you look closely the sour cream seemed a bit curdled which put me slightly off.

Very good!  I made this for a playdate for the moms and everyone liked it.  The only change I made to the recipe is I added some Italian 5 cheese blend and dried Thyme to the spread before I topped it with the parm.  I would make this again soon.  I think this would be sooo good on grilled pork chops.

This was good although a little bit cream of mushroom soupy. Definitely dice the mushrooms small. A clove or two of garlic wouldn't hurt either. I agree this would make a good topping for meat or a burger; would probably be good on toast too. Thanks!

I have to give this five stars because of the way my friends raved and scarfed it down, but I thought it was missing a little something.  I would probably add a chipotle pepper next time or something with a little heat.  I bet it would be delicious on a steak, as other reviewers noted.
