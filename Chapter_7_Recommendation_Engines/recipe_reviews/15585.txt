i have been making these for seems like forever. if you want chewy bars using the 1 c. method for sugar, syrup and peanut butter but also use 1/4 c. margarine, bring sugar & syrup and margarine to a rolling boil stirring constantly and only for one minute, remove from heat add peanut butter, plus, i double everything so i use 1/2 c. margarine 2 cups everything else and a 15 oz. box of rice krispies. So making the frosting is a whole bag of semi sweet choc chips and one of butterscotch chips, i have found if you mix these together and micro for 2 minutes exactly, NO MORE, they will stir up just nicely. my double batch makes a 17x12 pan size of perfect bars. NEVER have my bars come out hard when you use the margarine and this method!!! Just chewy goodness!!!

One of my favorite treats, ever since I learned how to make it at church daycare as a very small child. It really is wonderful to make with small children and you can make a sweet treat with ingredients that cost next to nothing and are usually found in your pantry. NOTE: Instead of butterscotch chips in the "frosting", I like to use Reese's peanut butter chips. My family can't keep their hands off of them! Try it for yourself, you'll see.

This has been a family 'staple' for holidays, birthdays, any special occaision.  My suggestion, do NOT allow the syrup/sugar mixture to boil, that will cause hard as rock bars.  Heat the syrup/sugar mixture, stirring constantly, just until bubbles come to the surface, then remove from heat!  Awesome treat!!

Great recepie!  I also doubled the chocolate and butterscotch chips for the top.  I melted everything in the microwave too - I used 50% heat and stirred frequently and everything turned out great.  I tried other cereals too when we were out of crispies.  Chex and cornflakes were good.  wheaties were too tough. Everyone seems to love these!!!!!  Oh, and if you use light peanut butter they dont turn out so good.. they're really hard.

My mom really loved these but i found them too hard.  I'm wondering if I had done something wrong.  Instead of leaving them out to cool i put them in the fridge.  Could this have caused the hardness?

Mouth-watering, chewy, sweet, and sinful. Once you've tried these, they will always be a temptation. They are the BEST!!! I've been a fan for years now. If you like Rice Krispy Treats, these are far, far better. We make it with 1 cup of both the choclate & butterscotch chips. YOU MUST TRY!

like others have said, i was thrilled to find this recipe -- these were a favorite "camping" treat for me when i was a kid. 

i did the topping like my mom used to -- i just spread the chips on top after pressing the rice krispie mixture into the pan. since the mixture was still warm, the chips softened and melted (i used more than this recipe calls for)...i just had to spread the topping as the chips softened/melted (they completely melt, and you don't have to use any more dishes by doing it this way).

Very good recipe, but bring sugar and corn syrup to just a boil, remove from heat, then add peanut butter.

I doubled the topping as others had mentioned (in fact, I think I doubled the butterscotch and maybe even tripled the chocolate... I love chocolate).  Instead of using the sugar and corn syrup, I melted the peanut butter with a bag of marshmallows for a chewier bar.  I think that solves the problem some people were having with the hard bars.  Really yum!!!

This is an AWESOMELY EVIL recipe. Just try and have some self-control when they're around. Three important changes. First, I never bring the peanut butter mixture to a boil (just heat until sugar dissolves), to keep the bars from getting too hard. Second, I double the topping. And third (and most important change), spread the topping on the bars and sprinkle with sea salt. Gotta go make another pan!

For those who'd rather not use straight corn syrup, melt a regular-sized bag of mini marshmallows and mix with peanut butter. You can also use a dark Agave syrup in place of the corn syrup. Sweet-maple-like flavor, or make a sweet syrup of your own by adding 2 parts sugar to 1 part water that's warm enough to melt the sugar completely. You might need to add slightly more peanut butter to get the consistency desired.

The stovetop method is origanally how I made these bars but now I just stir the corn syrup and sugar together and put in microwave for 2 mins.  Stir in the peanut butter and microwave for 2 mins more. Remove and add rice cereal.  They never have come out hard this way.

This is my most craved indulgence.  I make a whole pan of them just to have one serving and then bring the rest to work share with co-workers to avoid the temptation of devouring the whole batch.  So quick and easy--15 minutes and you're done!

I made these for Christmas goodie bags and they turned out very well.  As other reviewers noted, I doubled the chocolate/butterscotch chip coating and it was just the right amount.  Also, I cooked the peanut butter/sugar mixture just until it started to bubble and I had just enough time to stir in the cereal before it began to firm up.  The description is right!  These are a wonderful combo of flavors and textures.  Very sweet and tasty.  I will definately make again.

I have been making these for ten years.  They are great and easy to make.  As I have read in previous reviews, I suggest to SLOWLY bring to a slight boil, and then add crispies.  This allows you to have soft, chewy bars.  I also use the microwave for the topping.  1 c Chocolate, 1c butterscotch, in microwave save bowl.  Microwave ONLY 1 minute on high, stir, and pour over your pan of scotcharoos.  Let sit a few hours, and they will cut much nicer. Also, the easiest recipe to remember: 1c clear corn syrup (half a container), 1c peanut butter (half a container), 1c sugar, 1c chocolate chips (I use milk chocolate), 1c butterscoth chips, {1 min in microwave}, and 6c cereal. I sometimes use the holiday colored cereal for color.

Wow, these are yummy! I honestly didn't think I would like these as much as I did (and wasn't very happy to find out I did since I'm on a diet..lol). I'd seen them at potlucks over the years but never tried them since butterscotch has never really tripped my trigger. Guess I've been missing out! I sprinkled some multi-colored sprinkles on top to give them a little color since they are a little blah looking. Thanks :)

This is a good recipe.  I didn't follow it exactly but these are the things I changed:  I didn't use butterscotch, I used a 12 oz package of chocolate chips and I only used 1 cup of peanut butter.  

I used a smaller, square pan (8x8”) instead of a 9x13” pan.  I have a square, silicone pan that works really well because I can remove the whole thing easily; makes it easier to cut that way since they are twice as thick as the original recipe!  Plus the slices look cleaner.  On top, I used a whole package of chocolate chips, and heated it in the oven for about 5-6 minutes @ 300°.

These won't come out if you cook the peanut butter, put it in AFTER you cook the sugar and corn syrup, or you will have a crumbly mess.

These are excellent and a classic.  We aren't big butterscotch people so I used peanut butter chips instead of butterscotch.  I also doubled the chips on top to have a nice chocolately layer on top.

As written a 3.  I made these twice, the first time they were hard as a rock.  I then modified adding some butter to the mix and they were nice and chewy.  With the changes I would rate them a 4.  We liked them but have used other versions we like better.

Great! I grew up on these. Today they are one of my childrens favorites. Everyone seems to love these. They have so much flavor (not just plain sugary sweet) compared to the regular rice cereal treats.

Very good taste, family loved them. I would prefer a softer scotcharoo in the future. Next time I make these I will try adding margarine as a previous reviewer suggested. But all in all excellent!

These are very good but I do wish the recipe would change because I didn't read the reviews until AFTER I made them the first time and they got very hard! So I decided to read the reviews and saw the error of boiling the mixture instead of just slowly heating the pb until it melts.  When done right they are very good...they just need to FIX THE RECIPE!

The key to the bars not coming out hard is not overcooking the sugar and syrup mixture.  Just like how candy works.  The hotter the sugar, the harder the candy.  Also, a tip that makes the frosting easier to prepare is to pour the chips over the bars evenly.  Place the pan in a warm oven (like 200 degrees) and let them slowly melt. Check frequently, every couple of minutes.  The chips will hold shape but will be spreadable with a knife after just a little heating.  Yum!

These were great! I made them as written except I added 1/4 cup butter like some others. I took half to work cut into small pieces due to many are dieting but they were gone in 3 hours and my daughter loved them. Making more again next week.

I guess I'm really lazy.. I poured a bag each of semi sweet choc and butterscotch chips on top and put tin foil over since  they were warm yet. I also turned the oven on just enough to slightly warm it, turned it off and set the pan in there for 10 min or less. Chips were soft and able to swirl it around .

These are a staple in my house. Only change I did was use an entire bag of butterscotch chips instead of part of the bag. I feel like it gives it that little extra richness.

I tried one for the first time that was made with this recipe. I didn't know that something so simple could be so amazing. It made my life 20% cooler in ten seconds flat.

These are delicious! After you add the rice crisp mixture to the pan, to add a little more - pat in some peanut butter chips, then add the melted chocolate mixture - yum!

These are tasty, but I found them far too sweet. Will make again but probably increase the amount of peanut butter and reduce the sugar or corn syrup.

These turn out perfect every time!  The only adjustment I made was to double the butterscotch and triple the chocolate - as written it does not make nearly enough frosting to do the entire pan, even with a thin layer!  Very easy, done in 15 minutes flat.  I make them in half batches so I don't eat the whole thing myself!

Great bars!  I usually use 3/4 cups of the sugar and corn syrup...helps a little bit with the sugar content and you can't notice the difference.

WOW - Am I the only person on here who thought this things were sickeningly sweet - like to the point of inedible - Followed the recipe exactly (mine even look like the pic shown) and thought to myself a whole cup of sugar and a whole cup of corn syrup - prolly cost me over $10 in ingredients :( I feel bad giving a bad review but I wish at least one person had mentioned how terribly sweet they were - I only make recipes with high ratings and good reviews - Im just so shocked no one else thought these were as bad as I did - and I do have a very strong sweet tooth Also thought the krispies mixture ended up having a stale cardboard like texture to them  Did I do something wrong?

My mother made these, we called them "Special K Bars"  Super rich, You can just drizzle the butterscotch/chocolate mixture if you don't want them to be as rich.

These bars are delicious and easy to make.  I melted the chocolate and butterscotch chips for about a minute in the microwave, instead of using the stove top.  They refrigerate well in warm weather, and also freeze well if you want to fix a batch in advance.

Nanny used to make these for us 50 years ago and I made them for my kids and now I am hoping to make them for Grandchildren someday.  I have found putting them in cupcake pans have been extremely helpful. No more cutting!! Works great for bake sales also. These are sooo good, a must have at every family function.

Suprisingly, these were bland! I do not taste the butterscotch, only the peanut butter and cereal.. I think the chocolate and butterscotch should be doubled.

I make these all the time and they are so good! Admittedly, they are kind of a lot of work but well worth it! Beware: plan to give some away because otherwise you will eat them all! So delicious!

Very good. I will definitely be making these again. I think next time I will heat the mixture only until bubbles start to come to the surface.

Ok...I guess I never reviewed these ....when I made them a while ago.....I would have given them  a 3 or 4 as written.....only because I think the butterscotch is soooooo sweet and overpowering. Those who love the butterscotch chips.....go for it...you will love these. But I was actually reviewing this today as a 5 star because instead of using butterscotch, I used a bag of milk chocolate and peanut butter chips. I followed the recipe and added about 1/3 of the bag of choco/pb chips to the krispies....and then melt the rest for the top.....a true Chocolate and Peanut butter fan here....and I much prefer this change. Thanks to my sis Michelle for sharing this with me. I made a batch today to bring to a party....but had to try a small piece..... YUMMY!!!  So good.....

Delicious - a nice alternative to Rice Krispie Treats. Three recommendations and one caution:  1)  I decided to try microwaving the corn syrup, peanut butter and sugar and it worked well.  I did one minute at a time, stirring between minutes, and only for 3 minutes total. 2)  To spread the mixture in your 13x9 pan, use a spatula well-sprayed with a butter-flavored Pam or Crisco.  It let me pack the mixture firmly and make an even flat top, which helps the chocolate set evenly.  3)  I did up the chips to 3/4 of a cup of each and that put a perfect amount of "icing" on top.  The caution: sprinkling the chips on top of the pb mixture without melting them first (as suggested in other reviews) did not work for me - they did not melt enough to spread.  I may not have moved quickly enough so the pb mixture wasn't very warm.  I need to melt the chips in the microwave.

Making these bars can be easy once you know exactly what is required. I have attempted making them several times and the results have been hard chewy bars. This time I used several of the other review recommendations. I bought 11.5 oz bags of morsels. I measured a little over two cups of the combined morsels; Heavier on the butterscotch. I used a heavy bottomed sauce pan just large enough to accomodate the sugar, syrup, peanut butter and rice krispies when cooked and mixed together.  I placed it on my medium sized burner over medium heat and cooked the sugar and karo syrup stirring constantly only until the syrup close to the edge of the pan begin to simmer.  I may take it off the heat when the sugar is melted next time as some recommeded.  I added 1 cup of peanut butter and mixed it until it was melted then added the cereal and mixed.  I patted it gently into a well buttered 9x13" dish.  I melted the morsels together in the microwave in a pyrex bowl large enough to accommodate two cups.  I heated the morsels for forty seconds stirred the morsels and returned to the microwave heating at 15 second intervals until they were melted. I then iced the rice krispies. The result was a bar pretty close to perfect. I received rave rewiews and requests for the recipe. I think the secret to avoiding the hard chewy bars is using a heavy pan or heavy bottomed pan and not letting it boil.

Wonderful! Do NOT boil - just heat until the peanut butter is fully melted. If you boil for a long time, the bars will get very hard. Double the chocolate topping if you want it to be a thick layer. Used natural peanut butter and it worked very well.

These are delicious.  Chewy, peanut-buttery, chocolately.  As suggested by another reviewer, I JUST brought the sugar/peanut butter mixture to a boil.  When I saw the first bubble surface, I removed it from the heat and stirred in the rice cereal.  Plus, I only had 1/2 cup white sugar, so I used a 1/2 cup of brown sugar, and it worked fine.

I thought these were a little too sweet. I would recommend milk chocolate chips instead of the semi-sweet chips. (I double the chips, too.) This recipe is different than rice krispies in that you have to stir it more to ensure all of the liquid gets incorporated. You also have more time because it doesn't setup as fast as rice krispie treats.

We make these all the time, but like other reviewers said, use an 11 oz. bag of butterscotch chips and a cup of chocolate chips.  Turns out super sweet and peanut-buttery and butterscotch-y.  When I first tried these I couldn't place the flavor, but I loved it.  Butterscotch- yum!

These are fantastic. I add 1/4 cup more butterscotch chips and 1/4 cup more chocolate chips because it makes it much easier to spread over the whole top. I also usually add 1.5-2 cups more of crispy rice cereal because the mix is really wet otherwise, but they taste wonderful either way.

So good and so very easy to make.  I was thinking that there wasn't going to be enough with the melted chips to go on top but it was perfect. It would have been to strong a taste if I had used any more.

These have been a favorite at our annual family reunion for the last 20 years or so! Kudos to my Aunt Joan Schultz for discovering this recipe so long ago! I highly recommend this recipe to anyone with a sweet tooth as you get chocolate, peanut butter, and butterscotch all in one delicious dessert! Everyone will be fighting over them! :)

I love these bars, but this recipe left out instructions for the butterscotch chips (you are supposed to mix them with the semi-sweets).  Also, I had to double the semi-sweet/butterscotch chip amount to cover the pan. They were delicious, though!

This was great. I used dark corn syrup and made the "sauce" as the recipe stated. Once it was completely combined I took it off the heat. My bars were perfectly chewy.  I used a Cup of both chips and it made the perfect amount of topping.  I'll make them again.

I really go crazy with the topping.  I use a whole package of semi-sweet chocolate chips and a whole package of butterscotch chips melted.  Also, I don't let the peanut butter mixture boil or it's almost impossible to cut if you do.

I had never heard of a scotcharoo, and made it because it was a recipe for the Allrecipes Allstars group. It was as easy as making a rice crispy treat. It actually somewhat reminded me of a caramel rice crispy. However, strangely, it mostly tasted like a whatchamacallit candy bar. Edit Note: don't get impatient and stick it in the fridge, at any time, like I did. I was able to pluck it out of the pan finally, but then had to use my largest and sharpest knife in the house to cut it into squares. They got really hard. I hope I didn't ruin them. Let them sit at room temperature. It will take some time, but the chocolate will harden.

Huge favorite. A good friend hints around about a new batch every 3 weeks or so...

My changes; I always substitue honey for corn syrup.  When made according to the original, these are way too big for me to get my mouth around, so I cut the krispie treat portion in half (1/2 cup honey, 1/2 cup sugar, 3 cups rice cereal, and 1/4 cup butter - cooked together; 3/4 cup peanut butter mixed in off heat.)

And since the frosting is the best part... I added half again on the chips (3/4 cup of each.)

I'm going to try the marshmallow substitute for sugar next...

We used the microwave to make the process go faster since we didn't have much time.  Making them in the microwave I think are better because they're more soft and chewier. I thought they were very delicious and it's a very fast process.

Support your local dentist!!  Wow - very sweet but very good!  Take care to butter the dish very well - it will make it easier to get it out.  I say "it" because mine came out all at once, which worked out great and made it easier to cut on a board.  Would definitely recommend as a kid-friendly dessert!

This has been our family favorite for many years and continues on with several generations. We microwave our morsels in a medium size bowl, stirring every 30 or 45 sec as they will burn if not attended to.
You cannot go by looks, you must stir them until smooth. Also, our recipe call for the peanut butter to be added after sugar and corn syrup come to a boil. I don't know if there's a difference but it's what we have done for 40yrs plus. This recipe is a hit with children as well as adults!  Enjoy!

I use the microwave instead of the stove for the Corn Syrup/Sugar/PB & Butterscotch/Coco Chips and it turns out just as great and is much easier!!

I would not bring this mixture to a boil - the corn syrup will crystallize more and make your bars too crispy. You want to heat till all ingredients are melted together - just to boiling.  Also, use one bag chocolate chips and half bag butterscotch chips for frosting - melt together in mixing bowl in microwave and stir every 1 minute till blended.

Love these.  Use a little less cereal if you want them gooey-er!  Easiest way to make the frosting is to heat your oven to warm while making the bars.  Then just sprinkle the chocolate and butterschotch chips on top of the bars and slide them into the oven and turn it off.  After about 10-15 minutes remove from the oven and swirl the chips with the back of a spoon to mix and spread evenly over the bars.

SO YUMMY!! just a note about the peanut butter. make sure you use regular peanut butter. if you use the natural peanut butter, it's too dry and it will sieze up on you and you have a fine batch of peanut butter taffy :O).

This is my first ever review but I just had to do it!  My husband will tell you that I'm no Betty Crocker, and I won't disagree!  I read the reviews before trying to get pointers.  I added 1/4 mar. to the sugar/corn syrup and brought to "just" barely boiling.  I waited for the top layer to be completely covered with bubbles before removing from heat.  Then added the peanut butter.  They turned out soft and chewy!  I used 1 1/2 c each of the choc and butterscotch chips on top...MAGNIFICENT!!!  My family LOVED them!  My teenage son drooled longingly over the second pan I made. Everyone wins in my house with these!  Will def keep this recipe around!

This is the same recipe I use except if you use 1/2 cup honey and 1/2 cup corn syrup they are much better and healthier. My sons are 35 and 37 and this is their favorite and now my grandchildren also.

Like many others, I've been making these for years.  They are always a huge hit.  I can't go to a potluck or picnic without them.  I add the peanut butter as soon as the syrup and sugar start boiling, remove the pan from the heat and incorporate the PB  well and keep stirring as you remove it from the heat!  Have your cereal measured and ready, add slowly and gently.  When you turn it over into the cake pan, press the cereal/slurry mixture firmly down and nice and smooth.  I like to add more butterscotch chips than chocolate because they give that frosting a nice kick. Yum.  Be forewarned:  Once you start eating you won't stop!

YUM, these are delish! I did not have any crisp rice cereal on hand so I substituted approx 4.5 cups of oats. After adding the oats, the mixture was a bit too thick to stir so I added a splash of cold milk. The bars are probably a little more dense than the original recipe due to the oats, but I absolutely love them and will continue to make them this way! Thank you Walleye for a fantastic recipe!

I had these once when a coworker made them and was happy to come across this recipe when I was looking for a way to use up a box of cereal. For the chips, I used heaping 1/2 cups and just melted them in the microwave for 1 minute. Thanks for an easy treat!

These were so simple to make and turn out DELICIOUS!  I took another reviewers' advice and didn't BOIL the pb/syrup/sugar mixture and they turned out beautifully chewy, not hard.  Anytime you boil corn syrup it will turn rock hard: that's how you make rock candy. I also used 4 T butter in mine like another viewer... this probably helped with the nice chewy texture, like a rice krispy treat.  Thanks for the recipe!  I'll be making this for the family a lot now, I'm sure!

Oh My Goodness - Yummy! As others say, do NOT boil - just heat until the peanut butter is fully melted or they will get very hard. Double the chocolate topping if you want it to be a thick layer. They made a wonderful addition to the holiday assortment of goodies I served.  I WILL be making these many times!

This is a family stable. I have been able to do this recipe from memory since junior high.  My only suggestion is don't let the sugar, syrup, peanut butter boil. Make sure it's well mixed and the sugar dissolved and when it starts to bubble a few times then mix it with the rice crispies.  Can also melt the choc and butterscotch chips in microwave, just don't burn them.

Another suggestion for Christmas (or anytime) is instead of putting it into pans, drop the mixture by large spoonfuls onto wax paper and let cool. Drizzle with or dip mounds in the choc/butterscotch and then sprinkle those little colored candy balls (forget their real name) on the top while the choc is still wet.

Very good and easy to make.  I put it together in under 10 minutes.  BEST REVIEWER TIP: Do not let the peanut butter sugar mixture boil, as it will make the bars hard as rocks.

Awesome! I bring the sugar and corn syrup to a slight boil and remove it right away (don't boil for too long or the bars will get hard). Then I add the peanut butter and mix it with the sugars. I doubled the chocolate chips and butterscotch chips so there was more frosting.

Seemed to be a big hit at the NYE party, as was suggested, I doubled the chocolate and butterscotch chips.

Our family loves these! I have been making these for over 20 years. The only difference is that I use a whole bag each of Semi-Chocolate Chips and Butterschotch Chips and instead of melting over the stove, I pour the bags into a microwave safe bowl and heat for 1 min, stir, and re-heat at 20 sec intervals stirring each time until melted and creamy and have thus avoided the dreaded scorching issue!

My husbands mom would make these when he was a kid and now we finally found the recipe, thanks so much!  They turned out just like they used to...the only change is to use 1 cup of chocolate chips and 1 cup of butterscotch chips, otherwise you won't have enough to cover a 13x9 pan of the krispies.

These are fabulous on their own. But growing up my siblings and I would break a bar up and mix it in to vanilla ice cream. I still love to do it on occasion for a guilty pleasure.

These were really, really good, and the kids loved them (I used them in gifts baskets), but they were too sweet for me. Peanut butter is already a little sweet, so I think 1 cup is too much. Also, I used Jiff Creamy, but maybe if I tried a different brand, I'd get better results. Next time, I'll try half the sugar.

Not exactly like I remember them, but pretty close. For some reason, they came out a little hard and crunchy. I think next time I will use a name brand creamy style peanut butter instead of a store-brand chunky style. Oh, and definetly double the chocolate and butterscoth chips.

Chewy, crunchy and great flavor. The chocolate topping doesn't always turn out the way this recipe describes it too. So I just do it the way I know how too. Even if you don't like butterscotch, it is so subtle you won't even notice it. It is a wonderful combination, and a great no bake recipe.

EVERYONE MUST TRY!!!My Grandama and Aunt always made these when I was growing up and they have since shared the recipe with me. I only do one thing different. I only add one cup of Peanut Butter not 1 1/2 cups. It's one of the best desserts to bring to a Holiday party, Pot Luck, Baby/Wedding shower, BBQ...ANYWHERE...THEY WILL BE A HIT!!!!

These turned out very disappointing, super chewy and hard. You can barely cut them with a sharp knife. Hard to chew. Super thick. I was going to bring them to an event but now I have to make something else. I’ll probably throw most of them away. They taste good, if you can chew them without wearing out your jaw.

A family favorite! One whole 12 ounce box of rice crispies is perfect for making a double batch of these, which you will definitely want to do because they go fast!

Tastes like my childhood. Made several batches and gave as Christmas goodies for friends. I did switch the corn syrup for a bag of marshmallows just like regular crispy bars. I will be keeping this recipe, husband loves them!!

I am ambivalent to not rate this 5 stars.  the taste is 5 stars.  However, I am glad I read the reviews first regarding 'boiling' the syrup.  I let it just come to a slight bubble, and stopped there.  I also did not add the peanut butter until after the corn syrup and sugar cooked.  It melted quickly.  I used chunky peanut butter to get those bits of peanut.  I would not have wanted to have had it come to a full rolling boil, as they would have been too hard.  As it is, they are plenty firm.  I also used 3/4 cup each butterscotch chips, and chose to use milk chocolate chips 3/4 cups.   This was the perfect amt.  Not too thin, and not too thick to lose the flavor of the treat underneath being inundated with chocolate.  I sprinkled some muti-colored non-pareils for the holidays; this made them very festive.  the taste is wonderful, and oh so easy.  Good any time.

in step 1, use parchment paper liner instead of butter. in step 2, add 1/2 c butter to mix for chewier bars. in step 4, double amount of chips for topping. TLC

I use Special K cereal instead of the crisp rice and I leave out the butterscotch. I find the consistency is better and the butterscotch -  I’m not the biggest fan of but wanted a good peanut and chocolate go to treat. It turns out great using this method!

Followed directions as written.  Bars were not chewy at all.  Next time I will melt ingredients in the microwave or a big double boiler.  As made they were delicious if you had coffee.

I made this and followed other reviewers suggestions. Added 1/2 stick margarine to the corn syrup and white sugar,  bring to a soft boil then add the peanut butter. Turn off heat and add the Rice Krispies. Sprayed the 13X9 pan with butter spray and pressed in the krispie mixture with a piece of wax paper. Then melted the butterscotch and chocolate morsels for 2 minutes in the microwave. When I took them out the morsels were not completely melted, I just kept stirring and all of it melted. 
I initially used a 1/2 cup of the chocolate morsels and 1/2 cup butterscotch. It was too thin of a "frosting."  1 cup of each did the trick. I let it sit for about 90 min but the frosting hadn't hardened, put in the fridge for about 30 min and that did the trick. They are a little work but so good.

Well this turned out to be dangerous for self control! Move over Rice Krispie Treats- you’ve been replaced!                       I do have a suggestion... heating chocolate in a saucepan directly over heat is a bad idea. The risk of scorching it, or having the chocolate seize is great. That’s why most recipes instruct chocolate to be melted over a double boiler or in a microwave heated & stirred in 15-30 second intervals. I placed the butterscotch & chocolate chips on top of the warm, rice cereal mixture spread in the pan, covered the pan for a few minutes & spread the now melted chips with an offset spatula. One less pan to clean too~

Great taste but too hard! I have found that if I add butter into the pot, about a 1/4c, then they are soft like a rice crispie treat. This recipe turned out dry and crunchy like dried out bread.

I loved this recipe and so did my family. I did make changes. I used half granulated sugar and half light brown sugar and  added a tsp. of vanilla flavor.

This is an old family favorite from my husbands side of the  family.  I would change nothing except to double the batch because they disappear quickly.  I love that I can find these old recipes on Allrecipes.com  because it sure saves me searching through my old recipe box!   Thanks!

Made as written and then read reviews.  Definitely need to increase chocolate topping.  Possibly doubling.  Didn't have problem of hardening as others had.  I'm wondering if they let it boil to long.

Simple and delicious.   I highly recommend lining the pan with parchment  paper and lifting the bars out for cutting.

I made a double batch of the frosting as the single batch settles into the holes of the bars and didn't look nice, plus everyone likes nice thick frosting.

This is an old favorite I've been making for decades. I have a hard time getting butterscotch chips, so I use all chocolate chips for the topping. 
They do get very hard quickly, so I cut them into squares while they're still warm.

Not a fan of butterscotch, so next time I will use half of what is called for and double the chocolate chips. They also turned out slightly hard,  not very soft. Not sure how to adjust recipe to avoid them being hard.

This is my 4th of July Bring to the Party Dessert! I follow the recipe exactly as is.  Everyone loves them! I was reading the reviews to see if others like them as much as we do. I saw that one reviewer gave them a low rating - she put them in the fridge after making and the were too hard and crunchy when cool. This is true - my husband made that mistake -  Do Not put them in the fridge - they do get too hard. Leave them on the counter they will harden properly as the cool naturally.  Yummy!!

I couldn't find my mother's scotcharoo recipe so I decided to try this one. The chocolate topping needs to be doubled, maybe even tripled. It's too thin.

Tastes good, but they were very hard. A few of the other reviews suggest adding margarine and not boiling the pb/syrup/sugar mixture. I would suggest doing that, unless you hate your teeth.

Just like I remembered! These are delicious. If you happen to use a darker chocolate chip, be sure to add some butter to melting chocolate mix. I used the new Nestle 63% dark baking chips and they needed some help.

Scotcharoos are my favorite. I removed the corn syrup and extra sugar. The rice krispies do not stay together as well, but they are the perfect sweetness.

Made these for coffee hour, and they were a big hit! A traditional favorite in the upper Midwest, apparently. I was worried at first because the butterscotch chips smelled bizarre, but they came out very tasty. I didn't change a thing.

Living in the mid-west Scotcharoos are pretty much a staple food at any potluck or for after school snack.  I have tried, and failed, many recipes.  I was not born rather married into the mid-west so I don't have grandma's recipe.  I decided to try this one after seeing that "Walleye" posted.  With a name like that, I knew it was a true mid-west recipe. THE MOST DELICIOUS SCOTCHAROOS I HAVE EVER ATE.  I would give it a 10 if I could.  I have it so much in the last month that I have committed it to memory.

I thought these were a bit too sweet. I love the texture (I crushed the rice cereal just a bit to make the bar more dense), but next time will reduce the white sugar or use a natural pb.

Holy cow. Do not  boil the peanut butter.  It turns into a goopy mess. Put it in after you boil the other ingredients, turn off the stove and just let it melt. After this change, a better recipe.

For those who are breaking their teeth on this treat: Do not refrigerate.  And lightly (!) press into pan the rice krispies mixture into lightly greased casserole dish. Faster way is to combine sugar in microwave along with corn syrup on high at 30 second intervals. Add peanut butter when mixture is clear. Will melt on its own, then pour into rice krispies. This is airy, crispy treat.

I have made this recipe many times and so did my mother. To those who said they are hard as a rock: They become that way from being pressed down hard into the pan. Just give them a light press & no worries.

I followed the recipe exactly and it didn't turn out.  Too much cereal, or too little of the peanut butter mixture.  Taste was good, but too dry to because there wasn't enough of the peanut butter mixture to mix the cereal all in.  Also not nearly enough topping (you could triple it).  If you altered the recipe, it could turn out good, but I rated the recipe based on how it turns out as is, no alterations.

This is a great treat!  My mother took the recipe right off the Rice Krispy's box when I was young, and I am quite old now.  The amounts and directions were a little different though.  Yodabear said that hers got hard.  I think if you would bring the sugar and corn syrup just to a boil until the sugar is just dissolved, then take it off the heat and add your peanut butter it won't turn out hard.  The amounts in the recipe I had were... 1 cup karo, 1 cup sugar, one cup peanut butter.  Then one cup semi sweet and one cup butterscotch chips.  This is a family tradition at our house and my children and grandchildren don't think it is a holiday unless there is a HUGE pan of these.  I double or triple the recipe on occasions.

Best bars everyone eats up right away. Most important factor for these to not turn out hard is do not add p.b.with sugar and corn syrup until after it is brought to a simmer/boil. Do not over cook it. I stir and test by how it drips off spoon while heating. Then remove from burner and add p.b. they turn out perfect as long as it is not over cooked. I use 1 1/2 cups of sugar corn syrup and p.b.

I've been making these for at least 40 years. The only difference is I have always used 1 cup peanut butter. I may have to try the 1-1/2 cups this recipe calls for.

Hands down, the easiest no fail party pleaser for kids dessert. These are gone as fast as I can make them. Our neighborhood kids come around and ask if I have made any because they are universally loved so much. It is a peanut butter, chocolate, rice crispy treat of goodness in every bite. n

They were tasty, but the frosting only covered half of the dessert. I doubled the chocolate and butterscotch chips and melted them in the microwave. The pan method dried them out.  The result was heaven!

Always a hit no matter where I take them.  This is a favorite of DH.  I made as written; only using a bigger pan so that the treat would be thinner.

I loved them. My foods class made them in the microwave and cooled them faster in the fridge/freezer. We added just a dollop of peanut butter to the chocolate and butterscotch to make the topping just a little more creamy.

They were very good, but we didn't let them cool off enough. So then they were falling apart. I think we needed more frosting, because all I could taste was the rice cereal. But it was really, really, chewy.

our scotcharoos were amazing..they were fast to make and the chocolate was the best part. i think putting them in the refrigerator makes them even better.

Oh my!! This recipe was amazing! It was thin unlike the thick scotcharoos that i'm used to so i was in love with ir! It was creamy and sweet, and we ate them when they were still warm so they were gooey and warm!! Absolutely amazing!! I may just have to make them again today :)

These were fun to make, a little rushed, and we didn't do so well, but they were easy to make, it didn't take long to make them, we added a little more peanut butter than usual but it helped make it creamer. i Didn't eat them personally but others told me there were good.

This recipe was pretty good, it would have been more better if there was more chocolate and softer. But otherwise, they were good.

If you've never had these, you haven't lived.  : )  I've been making these for a few years and everywhere I take them, people (adults AND kids) practically want to lick the pan.  The only tricky part is melting the chocolate.  Too much heat and you'll have a dry mess.

These are absolutely delicious and addictive... be warned!  Fairly easy to assemble if you like working with sticky.  I love these flavors together.  Putting it in my permanent 'sweets' folder.

This is the first time I've written a review because it's totally deserving! This recipe is amazing and so easy! The only change I made was to double the topping due to other people suggesting it. I took this to a family reunion and I should have made a double batch !Thanks for the great recipe!

These are one of my all time favorite treats. On this particular recipe, I would use 3/4 c. of each of the chocolate and butterscotch chips rather than 1/2c. I had trouble covering the entire pan.

Anyone from the northern midwest can tell you what excellent little treats these are. Perfect for bake sales, after school snacks or a hide-away treat for yourself! These have a soft spot from my childhood and I'm glad I came upon a recipe that is as simple and delicious as these should be! Thanks!

Really yummy but really sweet. My only suggestion would be to make sure you use a good heavy pan. My pan was not great and the mixture started to burn on the bottom before it boiled. Thankfully i managed to save the scotcharoos(my pan though, not so much)! lol.  Will make again when i have a really sweet tooth.

These were pretty good, but I had to re-make the topping because the chips melted much better in the microwave.  They were a bit too sweet for me, but overall not bad.

As written, 3 stars. If boiling them makes them hard, and the recipe SAYS to boil, shame on the recipe. These would have been tasty except for how rock-hard they were! :( Next time I won't bring to the point of boiling. Other than that, good flavor and very easy!

I made these with my boys on a recent snowday....they were so yummy!!  I followed the suggestion of many of the other reviewers and didn't let the corn syrup/sugar mix get to boiling and they were perfect!  I also made these last summer and used corn flakes instead of the rice krispies.  I took them on a camping trip with the hubby's family and they were gone within hours!  They also pack very well in my sons' lunch box!

Next time, I'll have to put the chocolate on top rather than mixing it all together. Also, I only had corn flakes so I'll have to try using Rice Crispies.

I made these as part of my holiday cookie assortment, and these were by far the favorite of the bunch.  They're pretty much an amped up version of a Rice Krispies treat, so you can't really go wrong with that!

Yummy!  Needs more 'scotch' taste though.  next time would probably adjust to 3/4 c. butterscotch chips and 1/2 c. choc chips.  took the advice of others and cooked just until started to boil and then removed from heat.

Delicious.  I was worried they would be too sticky and hard to press in & then get out of the pan, but I didn't have any trouble.  Instead of butter, I sprayed the pan with Pam.  Fun to make with kids.

Absolutly delicious! They're addicting! I give it 5 and a half stars! My only complaint: the first time the chocolate burned so I suggest melting the chocolate in a bowl in the microwave.

Sooo yummy! I used the method recommended by another poster to melt the chips right on top of the crispies mixture, and it worked great! They ended up a little hard to chew, but that could be because it's been pretty cold in the house. Will make again.

These were awesome!  I brought them to a party recently and everyone loved them. I would suggest only refrigerating them for an hour before cutting them into squares, otherwise they get too hard and you have to wait for them to get to room temperature before you can cut them.

When I was in high school, we always made these for our girls lacrosse diners together (yeah i know not the healthiest snack for a sports team, but we were young, with no waistlines to worry about) that being 10 years ago, I had lost the recipe, so excited to find it again Thank you!

I made this recipe for work and every one loved it. It came out yummy. Very creamy with a balance of peanut butter, chocolate and butterscotch. The recipe was easy to follow.

These were really good.
There was not enough topping so I use the entire bag of both...

They were really soft and tasted very good.  Everyone at work commented how good they were.

My husbands mom makes these all the time, but I can never get the recipe from her.  We made them this weekend and they turned out great.  My husband said they were better than his mothers!!!! I  used the whole bag of chocolate and butter-scotch chips, because 1/2 a cup of each just wasn't enough.  Be careful not to burn the peanut-butter.  Happy Cookin.

I have made these for years. My mom got the recipe from a freind we meant @ Osego Lake back in the late 60's early 70's. I use straight chocolate chips or mix with milk chocolate or peanut butter chips.

Love these!  I made these for a tailgate party and the guys loved them!  I made sure not to boil the mixture and my bars came out just gooey enough for my football fans.  The few I took into the office disappeared before 10am!  I used milk chocolate chips and doubled the amount.

I like this recipe but I am not a big butterscotch lover so I replaced the butterscotch with milk chocolate and once with white chocolate. Both times they were excellent and go really fast. My family loves them refrigerated.

My mom has been making these since she was a kid. They are so yummy... but very, very sweet. We usually cut the chocolate and butterscotch in half, or we drizzle it over the top in pretty designs... Everyone LOVES them..

These were a hit on my Christmas candy trays. I even snuck some myself they were so good. However did have to double the chocolate and butterscotch topping since there was not enough to cover all of it. I also used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet

tasty but too difficult to eat.  I took one reviewers suggestion about not over boiling the peanut butter mixture but still the treat is too chewy stiff to enjoy.   bummer.

This recipe was awesome!  The choclate/butterscotch topping stayed gooey and I don't know if that's how it's supposed to be but if it isn't messy, it isn't good, according to my kids.  I've never had them before but really liked them.  I also doubled the both chips and waited until the mixture started to bubble before taking it off of the heat.

Easy to make.  I doubled the chocolate topping recipe - makes for a thicker chocolate topping.  Hardens well...one option may be to use corn flakes instead of rice crispies.  I also used extra crunchy peanut butter!

These were a big hit with my family.  I did cut down the peanut butter to 1 cup and increased the amount of both kinds of chips used for the topping.  If you store them in the fridge they will be hard to eat, but you can set them out for a few minutes and they will be softer and easier to eat.

These things are great! Follow the suggestion of others and double the amount of both types of chips. Also, my sister only uses one cup of peanut butter.

This is actually an old family recipe of mine, too!  My mom ONLY made Scotcharoos at Christmas, which made them all that much more special.  The only difference is, we use one 12 ounce bag of choc. chips & one 6 ounce bag of the butterscotch chips.

This is a GREAT treat for anyone with a sweet-tooth!!  One of my all time favorites!!

To be perfectly honest, I was the only one in my family who didnt love these.
