I've made this several times, and we really like it.  However, I like it much better as a thicker crust - I don't think it works well as a thin crust.  Don't split the dough into two lumps, just spread the whole thing over the pizza pan.  I didn't change the cooking time, and it was great.

I used a different crust recipe but this pizza sauce is SENSATIONAL!!!! I always use the Ragu sauce in a jar and almost chose to do so this time. I had all the ingredients , it looked easy, so I tried it. I'll make this every time I make pizza! You won't be sorry with this recipe....IT IS S-O-O-0 GOOD and I followed directions to the tee! Thanks Mike!

I love homemeade pizzas not only because I am able to prepare them myself, but because I know what conditions that they are cooked under...lol.  This is a very good recipe for both the dough and the sauce, I do however think that this dough IS better when rolled into a 14 inch double dough pizza vs. the 2 12 inch pies (baked the same time as the recipe states for the 12").  I tripled this and let everyone make their own. It rolled nicely and didn't stick...which is a plus to me.  It did sorta lack something (spice wise)...not sure what, but I will absolutely make it again and figure that one out.  I had no complaints on the sauce at all....actually I was a little leary because it started out spaghetti sauce like, but thickened really well, and tasted delish.  My 5 year old rolled and topped his own pizza and had a blast doing it.  Thanks for the great recipe Mike I got 5 stars all around.

I always make a recipe the way it is supposed to be made the first time, I wish I had made one 14" instead of 2-12" pizza's, the dough just lacks flavor but the texture is quite nice.  The sauce was good but we felt the Cumin threw it off.  I don't think I'll use the dough recipe again because it lacks.  The sauce MAYBE without the cumin.

UPDATE: I've made this sauce several times, very good. The sauce is really tomatoey and reminds me of an italian spaghetti/pasta sauce, in fact it would be a great dipping sauce with bread sticks. Crust I fiddled around with, it's easier to use another favorite one rather than try to keep tweaking this one. The sauce is worth keeping, dough is okay, it does have great crispy crackery texture and all. ORIGINAL REVIEW: This was fantastic. I got two 14 inch thin crust pizzas from this. The crust was very thin, light, and delicate, nicely crispy too. Like a cracker when I baked this on a perforated sheet on lowest oven rack. Dough was really stiff and seemed dry but I followed directions and it turned out great. Not a lot of flavor, but then does crust need a lot when it is a base? The sauce was really decent too. I made two pizzas and still froze some for another. This had some different ingredients than I am used to using for pizza sauce like the comino and chili powder. I didn't change a thing and really don't need too. Even though the crust could use some flavor, the texture is outstanding so it makes up for it. We all liked this and I will make it again. Thanks Mike, this was great!

this is a really really good sauce!  dont be thrown off by the cumin and the chili powder- it definitely adds a smoky and subtle flavoring to this sauce.  delish!  instead of water, i sub'ed tomato juice, i used brown sugar instead of white (to give a more caramel-y flavor/texture.  and since i didnt have any marjoram on hand, i just double the oregano.  and because i was a little skeptical of the cumin/chili, i halved both of those spices.  i had to stop myself from eating the whole pot! :)

The rating is for the sauce since I did not make the dough. I found this sauce to be very tastey as I was heating it through in the saucepan. Unfortunately, when I took my pizza out of the oven, I found a very dry sauce that had lost most of it's moisture content. The flavor suffered as well. I'll stick with the jarred sauce.

At first we were worried that the dough wouldn't turn out right, but it was perfect and the sauce--magic! I suggest topping it with parmesan and mozzerela. I love this recipe!

For beginners, this recipe is great! My girlfriend and I have made it a couple of times and decided to try it out on some friends; it was a success!  The sauce can taste a little pasty if you don't add enough spices. I like to add fresh diced garlic to the sauce while it's cooking and I also added some spices to the dough while i kneaded it. In sum, a great pizza that's easy enough to make if you've got the time.

Made this exactly as directed. The crust was perfect and the sauce was great. I didn't find it too spicy at all and I am not a spicy food person. It was our first attempt at pizza from scratch and we will definitely make this again. It was a hit with the whole family.

Made this last week using a shortcut of store bought frozen bread dough.  My family said this was "the best pizza they've ever had"  and we're from Buffalo where Pizza & Wings is a staple.
I will definately make this again.  Thanks for earning me some compliments.

I'm giving the sauce 5 stars.  We make this all the time for our homemade pizzas.  Not a fan of the dough.  I'll stick with my own recipe.

I borrowed another recipe for the crust (I prefer whole wheat) but made the sauce as directed. It was GREAT! A prefect mix of spicy and savory… overall super tasty sauce. This is a definite keeper. Thanks, Mike!

This was a very good dough and sauce recipe.  I substituted olive oil for the shortening and it worked very well.  The sauce was very good and complemented the veggies (mushrooms, red and green peppers that I added.  I will definitely do this again.

The recipe for the sauce is great (5 stars), but I'd give the dough only a 4-star rating. I didn't split the dough in two and just made a single 14-inch pizza. The crust had a great crunch to it, but it didn't really have any flavor.

Best homemade pizza we've ever made!  We made a rectangular pizza with all of the dough.  My only preference would have been to double the sauce as I like my pizza a bit saucier.  It was very tasty, and a nice balance of tastes in the sauce.

I'm giving this a middle of the road rating for two reasons - the pizza dough turned out terrible (didn't rise) despite following the recipe but on the flip side, the sauce was absolutely delicious and will use that recipe again soon.

I made just the sauce yesterday night - put in on pita with chopped tomatoes, mushrooms, feta cheese and mozarella. It was GREAT. It was just spicy enough, and adding more pepper flakes would increase the spiciness is needed. I loved it, will defintely make it again.

The sauce was delicious and so easy to prepare.  I added red pepper flakes and it was perfectly spicy.  Definitely a success!  I used the "Amazing whole wheat pizza crust" instead from this website for the dough and used this pizza sauce recipe.  So I am rating just the sauce.

I haven't tried the dough, but the sauce gets five stars from my family!  We make the dough from another recipe on this site (Jay's Signature Pizza Crust).  The sauce is very good - adds just the right touch to the pizza.  We always substitute olive oil for the vegetable oil and skip the cumin.  We have also found that making a single serving of it is not enough for two pizzas, but doubling the sauce makes quite a bit more than you need.

I made this recipe for my daughter's birthday party and it was a total hit.  I had never made homemade pizza before and not only was this easy, it was so tasty.  To make the recipe even more nutritional I substituted whole wheat flour for 1/3 of the flour used and everything turned out just right.  I also used the dough hook on my standing mixer to mix the dough together which made the dough rise a lot better.  Enjoy!

I haven’t tried the dough, but the sauce is really great! I didn’t have any cumin (and don’t really like it anyway) so I left it out of the mix.  It turned out great. I’ve also used splenda instead of the sugar, and it still turned out well.  I’ve played with it a few times, and found that I like it best without the marjoram and cumin, but added more crushed red pepper, garlic powder, and basil.  (doubled each of them in the recipe). I would highly recommend this sauce!

I Made the recipe exactly as is. I thought the recipe was just okay, the dough tasted something like a tombstone pizza and the sauce had me and my family thinking of an enchilada/mexican pizza flavor. First and last time i'll be making this recipe.

This was my first, from scratch, homemade pizza.  And it turned out great!  I should have gathered my ingredients beforehand, because I couldn't find my oregano.  I added a little more marjoram and basil and it turned out awesome!  I also gave the crust a little oil and mixed some garlic and salt and sprinkled it on it.  This is a very good recipe!  Thank you!  Oh yeah, I also used all the dough for a large pizza.  I've already had two slices.  I doubt I'm going to take any to work, as it will be gone (hopefully) by tonight, but, I'll probably eat the rest in about an hour... I live alone and can do what I want.

I'm giving this 5 stars based on the sauce alone. I did not make the dough recipe. That sauce was on point. I eye-balled the onions and sauteed that with freshly minced garlic (oh so fragrant!) Also, I used fresh basil instead of the dried variety. Lastly, I omitted the cumin and garlic powder. This makes a great sauce for not only pizza, but I think this will be great for spaghetti as well.

I don't know why everybody found the crust to be undesirable.  I followed the directions with the only substitute being olive oil for vegetable oil.  It wasn't a "traditional" crust (which tend to be chewy and harder depending on how its made anyway) but it was soft with just enough crustiness.  My husband and I both enjoyed the crust! Although next time on the sauce I think I'm going to halve the chili powder and cumin to cut back on the smokey flavor.  Otherwise it was an AWESOME sauce.  This is definitely the best homemade pizza I have ever made.  Great job Mike!

The recipe for the sauce is beyond incredible! Based on other reviews, I omitted the red pepper flakes and black pepper to adjust the spice. I used another pizza crust recipe and made a delicious homemade pizza with ingredients I already had in the fridge and pantry. Thanks Mike!

My family loves this recipe! Like other members suggested, I made one big pizza instead of two smaller ones. I also omitted the cumin and majoram because I didn't have them. The pizza was really good and I will definately make it again. Next time I think I'll add less salt though.

Never had a made pizza dough before and this was so easy.  The dough is great!!  It was crunchy on the outside and nice and soft on the inside.  The sauce has great seasoning and flavor; the cumnin and chili powder added a little kick to it.  Thank you for the great recipe.  It is definitely one that I will use again and again.

I use my own dough recipe but this sauce has become my standard recipe, and we eat ALOT of homemade pizza! It's really spicy and so full of flavor! I have had guests comment on how much they love the sauce more times than I can remember. It's also a really easy recipe to adjust depending on your taste ie more garlic, pepper, etc. The only thing I sometimes change is instead of water, using a can of whole roasted tomatoes, chopped, and the juice from that.

The sauce was great!  I did use a diferent recipe, Pizza Dough II, for the crust since I prefer a crust with whole wheat and without shortening.

I have been making homemade pizza for a long time.  I mostly tried this recipe for the dough, but gave the sauce a try because of the rave reviews.  The dough was really good... very easy to prepare and it had a nice crunch to it out of the oven.  (I found this was just enough for one pizza dough)  I strongly recommend baking on a pizza stone.  I was not that enamored with the sauce, at least not as much as everyone else.  For one, it was way too much for one pizza and the flavor was more similar to chili than pizza sauce.  But it's all a matter of taste!  Homemade pizza is so fun and easy.  Thanks for the great dough recipe, Mike!

I didn't make the homemade pizza dough, instead used storebought dough, which was just as good because I was low on time.  The sauce is what makes this pizza!  Awesome, tasty, yummy.  The sauce was enough for only one 12" pizza.  But I like more sauce than some.  Very good. I used pepperoni, mozzarella, olives, bell peppers, red onions and mushrooms as my topping.  My husband said my pizza was better than ones sold in store. Even surprised myself, as this was my first time at making homemade pizza (minus the storebought dough). Great pizza sauce recipe! Gotta try it yourself. This is a keeper and ultra easy.

I made this for a football party.  EVERYONE loved the sauce!! (I used store bought shells.)  The sauce went great with both pizzas - pepperoni and tri-colored pepper pizza!  I can't wait to make it again!

I really like the dough, very easy to make. The ingredients composition is really balanced which makes it easy to knead. I didn’t have shortening so I replaced it with 2 tbs of butter which add flavor to the dough and it tastes better as thick crust pizza.

I made the sauce recipe with a just a couple of changes. Fresh basil and no chili powder as I was making for my grandkids.  Kids loved it, daughter loved it, and picky husband loved it!  This is the keeper!

Worth the time! Delicious, A very authentic  tast. Will make it again. I Recomend preping dough one day before.  I added italian herbs and garlic powder on the dough made a big diffrence in flavor. Keep in mind this recepe will feed about a family of 5, will make about 5 small individual pizzas, Or two large pizzas (thick), if you make it thin you will have extra left over. I made double the serving we had a lot extra dough for tomorrow:) leave a bit longer for crispier crust.

Rating only for the sauce as I use another recipe for crust - FANTASTIC.  1 6 oz. can of tomato paste = 3/4 c.  I use half the amount of cumin and paprika to suit personal taste. and sub thyme for marjoram as I can't get it here.  WONDERFUL!  Also, I must use far less sauce on my pizza than other people, because this is enough sauce for about 6 pizzas for us!

I absolutely LOVE the sauce from this recipe. I've made the sauce at least 10 times though, and it is to DIE for.

Reason for 4 stars - The dough/crust is mediocre, I'm trying the "pizza dough II" recipe from this site this time. This dough turns out bread-like and flavorless. I've made it 3 times with different unsuccessful tweaks.

Love this recipe! I did add some sugar to the dough which I liked, but everyone is different. I've tried it as two crusts and as one, and I love it as one fluffy crust.

I'm new to cooking from scratch and this pizza recipe was perfect for me.  Easy enough that it wasn't intimidating, and so delicious I'll be making it again and again.  I halved the recipe and it was the perfect size for two.   Highly recommend!

I was so tired of trying to find a good pizza sauce in the store. This search was worth it to find a homemade one.  Very tasty sauce!  I used crushed tomatoes instead because no tomato paste on hand.  I used a bit more  fresh garlic and red pepper flakes to amp up flavor. This one is a keeper!

I've made this many times, and its always a crowd pleaser. It's good and pretty easy to make, but i do make changes just about every time i make it. I've switched to butter instead of oil for a richer tasting crust, and I usually just make a simple sauce, though this one does sound VERY good. In all though, the recipe itself is pretty solid and very tasty as is.

I rolled it out to  14", made a very wonderful crispy thin crust.  I love extra sauce, so I doubled the sauce recipe.  I followed the recipe to a T, and it was perfect.!  This will be a regular at my kitchen table!

Delicious sauce, hearty dough with a crispy bottom.  I didn't have any trays big enough for 12" pizzas so I made four 8" pizzas instead.  Turned out just fine.  10/10 would make again.

I added in more seasoning to the sauce to cover the acidity of the tomatoes, and cooked it for 17 minutes instead of the 20. It turned out tasting great. Might try adding in some herbs for the crust next time :)

I loved this sauce! My husband thought it was a bit too onion-y, but I disagreed. I followed the directions for the crust, except I used 2 tablespoons of olive oil instead of 2 tbsp of shortening. It came out great as well, though I thought it could have used an extra minute or two in the oven.

Sauce was yummy!  Was surprised that it had chill powder and cumin.  It had a little kick.  I  replaced garlic powder with two cloves of garlic.  Also I didn't cook sauce just three it all in the blender and puréed it.  Only did that bc I didn't read the instructions til after I had blended it as that's what I do w/ my go to pizza sauce recipe.  Anyway worked fine - it was yummy and got great reviews from hubby.

bf liked this more than i did.. i just thought it was okay.. i wasn't a fan of the dough.. it was very dry when we were kneading it and it came out dry when we took it out of the oven.. i was worried the dough was going to be bland like others said so i added some seasonings but it didn't save it much.. we made 2 pizzas.. one with Mike's sauce and then the other with bbq sauce.. bf said Mike's sauce reminded him of lasagna.. i think i'm just not used to making sauce out of tomato paste.. it tasted just okay, nothing special.. the dough would get a 2 and sauce would get a 3.. since bf liked it more i will stick to an overall 3 star rating

Everyone in my household enjoyed this!  I followed the directions almost to the T.  I didn't have any dried marjoram, but I just so happened to have some fresh marjoram in the garden and used that.  The sauce was really good.  The flavor on the crust was lacking, but it did cook to perfection on the bottom rack of my oven.  My fiancé likes a really thin crust and I like a nice, thick crust.  I did 2 12" pies as the directions state and it was medium thickness, probably thicker than what my fiancé likes but almost perfect for me.  I think this is a great starter recipe.  Next time, I will try adding more salt or something to the crust.  I wouldn't change much about the sauce though.

I am only rating the sauce.  I followed the recipe exactly and the sauce was good but not great.  It got so-so ratings from our family.  Another reviewer suggested using fresh, roasted tomatoes instead of the paste.  I think that would be better.  I would also add garlic and probably skip the cumin.

Only used the recipe for the sauce since the crust got poor reviews.  The sauce ended up giving me only a 1/2 cup of pasty red gunk with a bunch of seasonings tossed in.  Waste of my time!

I tried pizza on my own from scratch one time before finding this recipe and it was a disaster. I've used yours a few times now, and it's close to perfect. Thanks, mate.

This is the best pizza recipe I've ever made! This is a keeper! The only difference was that I added some sugar to the yeast because I was having a hard time getting it to proof. Oh, and I had almost all the herbs fresh. I didn't add the cumin... I may someday, but I wasn't brave enough today.

This is my first time making this dough, i will let you know how it turns out, i have my own sauce that is homemade from my Italian Grandma Augie, so will let you know how it turns out, i used olive oil for the pizza, don't use any other kind, it will not be good, i have tried it and olive oil is the best when making homemade pizza, my Grandma made the best pizza ever!!!! I hope one day I can duplicate her's, let you know the outcome. Lisa

Wow, this was awesome.  The crust was not too thick or thin and wasn't the least bit doughy.  I never made my own pizza dough before because of how long it takes . . . this very fast and easy!  I will definitely put this recipe in my program and make it again and again.  Just make sure you have all the ingredients for your pizza prepped ahead of time because you don't have to wait for the dough to rise before assembling the pizza.

I have to say I have never made this crust - but I'd give the sauce 10 stars if I could! It's better than any pizza restaurant. You'll never buy sauce again. I make huge batches and freeze smaller quantities (ice cube tray works best) to thaw out whenever you want pizza. Just keep some mozzerella on hand and make a pizza on french bread, tortilla, english muffin - with whatever you have in the fridge. It's perfect to have around when my kids have friends over. I've made batches of this pizza sauce for gifts for people and passed this recipe along to the many people who have asked me for "my" sauce recipe. Don't be afraid of putting that much red pepper in - it's a perfect kick to the sauce, but not actually hot. Perfect combination of flavors! Thanks for posting ;-)

I only made the dough as I did not have time to make the sauce.  This dough was right on point.  It was delicious.  In the past, I had tried recipes that had caused an over doughy, too thick crust.  This is perfect.  As a matter of fact, it was better than the dough I get when I order out.  Thank-you for the recipe!

GREAT recipe!! This was my first time ever to make homemade pizza, my husband and I really loved the taste of the sauce and the crust! Following the recommendation of some reviewers, I used one 14'' pan rather than 2 12'' pans. THANK YOU!!!

Sauce was different but real good!!  I added an extra half teaspoon of sugar at the end because I found a tad spicy.  My boyfriend liked it too and said it'd be even better sweeter.  Thank you MIke

The sauce was delicious! The crust kind of needs a little reworking. I loved the bottom of my pizza being crunchy and good but the crust of the pizza was also the same texture. Other than that, the pizza was pretty tasty. Thanks a lot Mike :)

The sauce in this recipe is excellent, but I would not recommend the dough.  I used the calzone dough recipe from the "Real Italian Calzones" on this site instead and everyone LOVED it!

This was the first time I've ever made homemade pizza and it was great.  I always have to make myself follow the recipe the first time and boy, I'm glad I did.  The sauce was different, but really good.  I also made my own sauce to compare and once we tasted them side to side, the southwestern flavors are more apparent.  I got two crusts on my Pampered Chef pizza stone out of this recipe.

I really liked the sauce, I just used that portion of the recipe to make Pita Pizzas and they turned out great! The spiciness of the sauce was the best part,e specially when juxtaposed with fresh tomatoes and spinach leaves.

I didn't use the recipe for dough, but the sauce was awesome!

I subbed white sugar for brown. Also, I didn't have some of the spices, so I doubled the oregano and added more red pepper flakes. Very, very good!

I didn't make the sauce, so my rating is on the crust.  I buttered my cast iron, sprinkeled garlic salt on the bottom along with a tiny bit of corn meal.  I cheated and bought store pizza sauce.  But overall, the family loved it.

I'm not a pizza-eater so I didn't try any of this, but my husband gave it 4 stars. I followed the advice of others and used all the dough for only one pizza since he prefers thick crust. I tried the sauce and it was different than I expected - spicy yet similar to spaghetti sauce. He really seemed to like it, though! And for homemade pizza it didn't take TOO long to make, so I'll probably make it for him again.

I've never made pizza sauce before and chose this one because it looked like it would be really spicy - it was just what I was looking for. I added a little more red pepper because I like it hot.

I really enjoyed working with the pizza dough in this recipe, the amounts of ingredients were perfect, it didn't stick much and it rose quickly.  And it was EASY!  I added a bit of sugar to the water and yeast so it would activate quicker.  It made two nice 12 inch pizzas, just like the recipe said.  After it was baked, it was pretty breadlike, but having a pizza stone may remedy that.  I sort of followed the recipe for the pizza sauce, which I was skeptical about- tomato paste and water didn't sound that good.  Surprise!  It tasted excellent and the only thing I changed is I used less salt and used some pre-mixed pizza seasoning instead of all those listed in the recipe.  Also, I like a lot of sauce and was concerned there wouldn't be enough, based on other reviews.  The amount in the recipe turned out to be perfect, though.  If I could separate them, I'd give 5 stars for the sauce!

All my friends liked it but I didn't think it was great.  I doubled the recipe and made one thin crust and two deep dish.  The sauce didn't really suit my taste, but everyone else said it was amazing.

Oh yum!   The sauce was amazing!  Quick and easy.  Nice for those pizza cravings, but gives you control of the content.

We just used the sauce, but it was excellent!  Will definitely use again.  Didn't change anything.

AMAZING! My first time making homemade pizza, and it was a huge hit with my family. Instead of using tomato paste, fresh tomatoes would probably make the sauce tastier. I will definitely be using this recipe again.

I made this once to the recipe, and it turned out very good.  The next time, I used a different pizza dough (the main differences from this one are that it adds a tablespoon of honey and uses olive oil instead of shortening), but I kept almost the same sauce.  Honestly, this is one of the best pizza sauces I've ever tasted.  It's so good that it elevates the whole pizza to another level.

My only changes to the sauce the second time around:  I eliminated the cumin and chili powder, used premixed Italian seasoning in place of the basil + oregano + marjoram, and increased by half the amount of the remaining herbs and spices.  Obviously, these alterations are just a matter of personal taste; the original recipe was great as it was!

Ok if you're making Mexican pizza:  the chili powder and cumin are out of place for a a traditional pizza sauce.  Also way too salty.
