I use spinach, frozen tropical fruit, squirt of honey. Bariatric Fusion Protein powder, Chai seeds and collagen powder and blended  with Non sweetened Vanilla almond milk. This is my go to daily breakfast since I had bariatric surgery in 2017..don't like kale because its bitter tasting to me

I made my first smoothie with this recipe..the kiwi taste is very nice, I wasn't able to find the almond milk with honey, so used regular almond instead..it was tasty

Good Health Drink! Instead Of Frozen Fruits, I Prefer Using Fresh Stuff. I Used Fresh Pineapple, Available In My Local Indian Market All Year! All The Items In This Recipe Are My Favorites! Thanks For Sharing!

I didn't measure they way they did but I followed most of the ingredients. Swapped kale for spinach, added oats for my own health and honey. 
I would definitely make it again!

Tastes great. Would not use this for anything more than a dessert. WAY TOO MUCH sugar.
