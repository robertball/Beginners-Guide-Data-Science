My baby food days are long gone, but I had some leftover baked sweet potato that I wanted to use.  For the carrot, I finely grated it and put it in a food processor with the sweet potato and gave it a whirl.  I then added all the ingredients with the exception of the wheat flour, oatmeal, and baking soda and gave it another whirl.  In a large bowl I combined the dry ingredients and then added the sweet potato mixture.  A large cookie scoop (holds 3 Tbls) makes the perfect size muffin IMHO.  The muffins are not too sweet and perfect with your morning cup of coffee.
