My only change was to leave out the pecans since we were out.  This was a wonderful tasting cake, but it was so small!  I would definetly double the recipe to fit into a normal bundt/tube pan.  It doesn't rise much and barely filled the bottom half of my pan.  I also had to add 10 minutes to the cooking time.  I would probably bake this again but just double the recipe and really watch the cook time.  This is more like 6/8 servings, not 14!!

Like others, I eliminated the pecans and baked in a loaf pan. If you bake in a loaf pan, bump up the temp to 350 and cook for an hour. 

I wanted a more lemony flavor, so I added a teaspoon of lemon extract, and I also added some cornstarch to the flour to make it cake flour. This is definitely a drier pound cake ... about the texture of a scone. But that's perfect for serving with strawberries and whipped cream, or some other fruit that's been macerated.

I found this recipe trying to replace a lost  one.  Omitted the nuts which weren't in old recipe and baked in 9-inch Bundt pan (smaller than the usual one). You could use a 9 x 5 loaf pan also.  There were 12 generous servings with peaches and whipped cream.

This was the first cake I baked from scratch.  It was excellent.  However, next time I will try it without the pecans.

If you only have the standard size bundt pan, this is going to come out a strange size.  In the end, I thought it was perfect for a tea.  If you want a more traditional look, double the recipe or use a loaf pan. I loved the flavor and would definitely make this again.

Thanks to cookin'mama for the tip on the pan. I used a loaf pan and this turned out well. I didn't change a thing about the recipe itself. It is great and hubby, the pecan lover, happily gave it 5 stars. Thanks for the post.

Baked this for my mom for Mother's Day.  She loves my pound cakes; this one in particular is a favorite now because it tends to be a bit dry.  She favours dry pastry such as Stella D'oro or biscotti cookies.  A very nice gift for someone you love.  I really liked the icing!

Here I go again reviewing a dessert, which I don't really do because I don't bake a lot trying to cut back on the sweets. Just the name of this was so inviting I had to try it and it was wonderful. This is a recipe I will make again. Thanks.

This was a big hit with my friends and family. I made small bundt cakes with the pecans baked into only the top. Drizzled with the lemon icing, it was really pretty and delicious. I also dusted the serving dish with powdered sugar.

I did something wrong with this recipe. The crust came out hard and the inside very wet, so I cut it into slices, put in the oven at 400 degrees and made the most delicious cookies with it.  I still have no idea what I did wrong because I followed the recipe to a T.

I made this cake for my mom for Mother's Day who loves lemon. I found this pound cake to be very very dry. I followed the recipe exactly except for baking them in mini-bundt pans (for reduced time of course). Nobody finished their cake. I will not be making again.

I made this to accompany my chocolate fondue and it turned out wonderful.  I did bake mine in a loaf pan without pecans and it was perfect.

This cake has good texture and flavor, but is on the dry side.  I barely baked it long enough to be done, so it wasn't the baking time.  I think this would be better if there was some sour cream or pudding in it for extra moisture.  The glaze helps, but not enough.  Pound cake implies a pound of butter, and this only calls for 1/2 pound - maybe the recipe was adapted and that's why it's a little off and why the pan size seems to be off as well?  I'll try again with tweaking.  Good starter recipe, the pecans add a good flavor and crunch.

I think this could be a five stars if I'm careful not to cook it too long.  I used a loaf pan as suggested BUT haven't figured the best cooking time for it.  So, a little overdone but delicous.

Delicious. I accidentally used granulated sugar instead of powdered icing sugar in the dry ingredients and it still turned out fabulously. Next time I think I'll increase the amount of pecans.

After reading other reviews I made some changes...it turned out just ok.  Here's what I did: added 1/4 C plain yogurt to make it moist, used a standard loaf pan and baked at 350 for about an hour and omitted pecans.  It really stuck to the pan and was very crumbly when I sliced it warm.  After a day it's not crumbly anymore and it's very moist.  Decent flavor, but not something I want to spend my carbs on!

This cake is excellent, very moist. I used 1-1/2 Tbl. fresh lemon zest in the recipe and it was nice and lemon-y. I also added more roasted pecans than the recipe called for (about 1 cup). The glaze "made" the cake and it presents very nicely.

NOTE: Making one recipe did not yield as much batter as I expected so I tripled the recipe and made two cakes (1-1/2 recipes per bundt pan). For my bundt pans, this yielded the perfect amount of batter.  This recipe will definitely be my "go to" cake when I need something citrus-y and bright!
