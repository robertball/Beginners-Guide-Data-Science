I added a teaspoon of homemade apple pie spice. I made no other changes. These were just okay. VERY dry. This was one of the few times my kids did not finish a whole muffin and they will usually eat 2-3 each in the morning.

I made these just like the recipe with small exceptions. I didn't have wheat flour so I used white and I baked at 375 degrees because I was using a nonstick pan. They turned out moist and   delicious, just like the kind I used to love at snack time as a preschooler.

These were overly moist/wet muffins, and I wouldn’t make again.  Did cutback sugar to 1/4 cup white plus 1 tbls. brown sugar. Added 1/3 cup raisins, 3tbls. walnuts, 1 teas apple pie spice, 1 tbls wheat germ. Subbed 2 tbls applesauce for 2 tbls of the oil. They were small and didn’t rise much. Baked 3 extra minutes. They were definitely done but just too moist - feared that since there was so little dry ingredients.

3 18 18 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/232845/vs-apple-bran-muffins/ ... Well ... I subbed some, but  not so far "out" that my review is worthless.  :D  Lowdown:  Flat tops & too sweet.  "Apple," it isn't - without apple added.  I used 3/4c AllBran for flakes - thinking no air pockets as with flakes.  :/  :)

I found after I was ready to add the applesauce that I didn't have any!! So I used butter. I also used coconut milk instead of regular milk. They are light and moist and fantastic!! Just try them and see.
