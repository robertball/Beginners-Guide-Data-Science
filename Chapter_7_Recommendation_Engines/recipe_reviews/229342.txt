I made the recipe for tassie pie crust instead of the one written.  As tassies, they took 20 minutes of baking time.  This is sweet, maybe too sweet!  Next time, I will try using white sugar instead of the brown sugar.  A dallop of whipped cream might be what these need!

It is perfect, but ... I used cream or one could use carnation milk also instead of sweet condensed milk... gives more a real maple flavour! You can use 1/2 of brown sugar also.  I always double this recipe and make tartelettes instead of a big pie...Voila! DÃ©licieux!!

This is a great pie. REALLY sweet, but it's called Maple Syrup Sugar Pie, right? Wonderful texture, great crust, sweet sweet sweet. Great served in small slices with strong coffee.
