Oooo such a tasty meal...I made the pesto fresh however with a recipe off of this site.  Also works great with thin boneless porkchops. You dont have to cut them in the middle just fold it over the pesto like a roll up. Went really well with a simple side dish of rice and steamed veggies.

This was a big hit at dinner.  My husband and I really enjoyed it. Firstly I doubled the recipe for 4 boneless pork chops.  I stuffed the chops with pesto and applied the rub about 2 hours prior to browning/baking. This may have added marinated flavor inside and out. I used a large cast-iron pan to cook the onions and then hot-seared the stuffed boneless chops for 1 min/side.  I did find when putting the pan into the oven that it smoked up--I just added 1/2 cup of water.  The water made a nice little sauce to go w/ the onions and pork chops. 20 minutes is all it took to bake. I chose not to add the extra pesto over the top at the end.  Watch out for the toothpick when serving. Some recipe I read suggested using raw spaghetti to secure pockets.  Maybe worth a try. This is company quality!

Good recipe.  I made my own fresh basil pesto.  The only issue was that it took 30 minutes to cook the pork, not the 15-20 the recipe said it would.  The pork turned out tender and tasty. It was also easy to put together (not counting the making of my own pesto, but if you buy it from the store, it is a quick and easy meal)  I may use less oil next time, as it seemed too much.

I was expecting the flavors in this recipe to be "good" and I was really pleasantly surprised at how "great" they are. I used all ingredients as written, except I tripled them and stuffed and rolled 2 tenderloins instead of using chops because that's what I had. The cumin and paprika are a great touch and the onions were delicious. Super-easy, few ingredients. I would definitely make this again, using either chops or tenderloin. Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe and very easy. I transfered the chops to a baking dish and, therefore, had to bake them just a few minutes longer. Made these for a small dinner party & everyone loved them.

Fair recipe! Please make fresh pesto! The store bought stuff is NOT good- lacks the flavor and has way too much salt!  Pesto is fast and easy to prepare and will make this fair recipe a star.

Quick, easy and pretty darn delicious - tastes like you spent a long time on it! I cooked it all in a skillet on the stove top. Would work well with chicken too. Thanks!

Have fixed this a couple of times now. The first time I rubbed pesto on both sides of the chops and marinated them for a few hours in the fridge before stuffing them. The second time I forgot and I think the pesto marinade really made the chops. I will definately remember to do that next time!

Very Good Recipe and of course Pesto makes anything taste amazing in my opinion. My husband brought home 9 boneless Pork loins instead so I had to twirk the recipe a little bit. He preferred his without it stuffed with pesto as I loved it both on top of the pork and inside. I added a lot of Parmesean on top and cooked them in Olive Oil instead. I also added Garlic Powder,Paprika,Pepper and Oregano for my "no salt herb seasoning". The sauce it bakes in is required to pour on top to get the full flavor of this dish.

This dish was fabulous!  Very easy to make and is done in no time.  The pork chops were so juicy.  I used 4 boneless center cut and the only changes I made to the recipe were:  I added some minced garlic while the onion was cooking and added sliced roma tomatoes on top.  Added an additional 10 mins to cooking time and placed a slice of swiss cheese on top.  Will definitely make again.

This is a very good recipe. I could not find the pesto recommended. I used bottled pesto and worked very well.

These pork chops came out perfect!  I followed the recipe pretty close, just added more seasoning than asked for.  Highly recommend; pesto is great with pork!

I really liked this recipe! I made it as directed but next time I would use even more onions and a little more pesto - I didn't quite have enough. My picky 14-year-old brother didn't like it, but that's nothing new! Give it a try!!

I had to top my pork because I didn't have skewers that would hold them together. I topped it with Parm and baked 30 minutes. I didn't bother with the onions either. I served with steamed veggies and orzo. It was really good!

I made this dish with freshly made pesto on a grill at 400F.  It turned out awesome.  I was concerned about adding the cumin and paprika, but I was surprised at how they enhanced the flavor.  As a side note, the pesto was made using basil that I grew in an aerogarden.

Different flavor for pork chops which I loved, husband liked it but didn't love it but I think that's because he's a farm boy who loves is traditional pork chops.  I'll be making this again.

Easy recipe to follow. Didn't have cumin so was going to skip that, but ended up getting the spice and liking the flavor it added.  I may have cooked the pork too long before baking them (or perhaps I baked them too long) but they were a little bit dry.  I would definitely repeat this recipe, just cook them a little less than this time.  Oh, and I'd add more onions.  You can never have too much!

These were really good.  I'm not a big pork chop fan but my BF loves them so every now and then I will try to cook them.  This recipe was so easy and really fast.  Its a keeper.  I made it with the Baked Balsamic Asparagus found on this site; it was a great compliment to the chops.
