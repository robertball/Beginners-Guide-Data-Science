This was good, but I also prefer a chunkier soup. Next time, I don't even think I'd puree it! Also, I don't like that the crab taste was so hidden. I'd add more crab meat next time, and different spices. The soup was a bit bland.

This is more like stew than soup!  I should have added more liquid!  I like chunks in my soup, so I only partially pureed this.  The rosemary and lemon pepper are good flavorings, but I think this should have more of an ocean or seafood flavor.  To me, crab is special, so the flavorings really need to be special, too!
