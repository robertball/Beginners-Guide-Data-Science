EDIT: The first time I made this it came out perfect, the second and third times I had the problems of other reviewers. Here are my tips: let the molasses/water boil for 10 minutes or so to reduce before mixing it in. Spread onto a baking sheet, and let cool. Cut into diamonds or other easy shapes when you're done.

I thought this recipe was great. I didn't know what it was when I started making it, but it is a nice sweet. I like that it doesn't use refined sugar, only molases. And the texture is really interesting!

Nothing about this recipe was as I expected.  When the flour is added to the butter, it formed crumbs!  When adding the molasses, I had a soupy, lumpy mass.  My wire whisk beat the dough somewhat smoother.  After dropping the scoops onto the paper, they never hardened.  This was like eating spoon fudge!  On the plus side, I can say that this was sweet!

This recipe looked really weird at first, but then tasted really good! We added twice the amount of walnuts and rolled the Halwa in them. This is only if you like walnuts.  Very easy recipe too!

I halved the recipe, but I did need to use a touch of extra butter to get the flour to come together into a dough. I used one reviewer's suggestion of boiling the water and molasses for around 10 minutes to reduce it a bit and I really enjoyed these! Super easy to make and nothing like I've ever tasted before. I have to agree with the person who said they liked the fact that there is no refined sugar in these. I'll make these again, thanks for a great recipe!

I want to thank Asli for her contribution of Turkish dishes.  My husband is originally from Istanbul and I wanted to surprise him with this recipe.  I didn't have much luck with it (Sueb review could have been mine) and he told me that his mom used to make Halwa but not with Molasses.  I'm going to try your other Turkish recipes that you've submitted.

for reviewers who said it didn't 'harden' - I don't think un helva/flour helva is supposed to harden. there are different kinds of helva. tahin helva  is what you usually find in stores in the US - its made from sesame paste, not flour, and it's hard and crumbly.  flour helva has a softish consistency when its made correctly, and its even better the second day. 

I've never seen Un helva made with molasses, and personally I would leave out the nuts - you could try substituting some milk (and sugar of course) for the molasses if you want to try making the standard version.

I did not care for this recipe. It turned out as gooey, molasses-flavored blobs.

I tried this recipe for dessert one night and it was not up to standard.  It was kind of mushy and the recipe did not call for enough walnuts.  I would try a different recipe next time.
