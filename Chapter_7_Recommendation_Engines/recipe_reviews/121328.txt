These were so easy to make! No cutting in shortening, no rolling out and cutting!  The batter was really sticky and wet when I put it on the tray, but that must be normal.  I omitted the garlic (except on top) and would probably add more cheese next time. They ended up a little dry.  I may have cooked them too long, but I wanted to wait until they were golden.  Maybe try just the 9 minutes even if they aren't quite golden enough.  Very yummy!

Great, easy recipe.  The only changes I made were to omit the garlic in the biscuits (for the kids!) and I only made half of the recipe and baked in a mini-muffin tin for about 15 min.  Everyone loved them.  Thanks!

these are good as long as you are NOT expecting a bread-like dense biscuit. as those below mentioned, it is more like a puff. the onions add a really nice touch and i only used one egg after reading some of the comments. my boyfriend loved them anyway and it was nice to have small recipe for just the two of us, although if serving more people i would maybe double it.

Oh, my goodness, these were awesome... I did make a couple of slight changes..... added a bit of cooked finely chopped bacon and some minced chives... left out the garlic in the batter.  The biscuits were incredible... the garlic butter topping was perfect... don't use too much though, or it can be overpowering. Each bite was a burst of all the flavors... cheese, bacon, chives and a little garlic.

My husband loved these. He doesn't usually rave over bread either. I think he ate about 4 or 5, also unusual for him. I had to improvise as I was out of milk, so I used some sour cream and it was too thick so I added in some lemon lime soda too. These disappeared quickly. Thanks.

These were OK. I made them exactly as directed, and they just seemed dense and dry...My kids loved them, but maybe I'm just a yeast roll kind of girl!

I loved the flavor (and concept) of these = but as someone else mentioned, the interior texture of mine turned out pretty dry.  I think the garlic was a nice addition - I think next time I might try my regular Cheddar Biscuit mix (just like yours, only with water, believe it or not) to see if that lightens them up a bit.  Thanks so much for recipe.

Light and moist.  A nice alternative to a heavy biscuit. Followed the recipe exact, except used shredded habanero cheese and doubled it. I will definitely make this again!
