Great recipe. I added some crushed red pepper, a little low sodium chicken stock and reduced the amount butter to avoid the fat.

Not a mushroom guy, so cut those out and halved the butter. Had so much flavor! I only make shrimp a couple times a year but this recipe may put shrimp into mealplan more often!

Followed the directions and it was delicious, quick and easy. I used the handy calculator and changed the servings from 6 to 2 and it was great.

So I thought a pound of butter was a typo but I always try to follow the recipe the first time I make something from this site. Don’t cut the butter and for sure don’t skip roasting the tomatoes! They make the dish! After roasting the tomatoes, I put them on the cutting board and used some cut up French bread to sop up the leftover tomato/oil, then toasted the bread. YUM OH MY GOD!

Added extra mushrooms. Was true to recipe after that. Do not omit the oven roasted plum tomatos, they are the highlite of this dish.

I used thyme as i did not have any basil. Otherwise no changes. It turned out well, a lot of flavour !
