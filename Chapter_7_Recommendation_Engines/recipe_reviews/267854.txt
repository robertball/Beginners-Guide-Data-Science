I made this and it tastes yummy. I just feel the quantity of condensed milk mentioned in the recipe was a bit high to hold the mixture in shape. I added couple tablespoons of milk powder to balance it and it was perfect. Instead of food colouring I added two tablespoons of roohafza for the flavour and beautiful pink colour. 
Placed it in mini cupcake liners so that they donâ€™t lose shape in any case.
