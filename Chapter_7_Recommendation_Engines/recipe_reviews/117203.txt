Very tasty, colorful salad - and perfect to officially ring in the beginning of the cook-out season.  I didn't measure precisely, just tossed in the ingredients until it looked right.  I'm not crazy about canned vegetables, so I used frozen corn and chopped red bell pepper rather than the Mexicorn. I also added Jane's Krazy Mixed Up Salt, garlic salt, fresh cracked pepper and probably more lime juice than called for, 1/2 of a very juicy lime.  The dressing is particularly delicious, but I'm sure the additional seasonings played a role.  I liked the choice of cider vinegar as well as the additions of cumin and oregano. Given the ratio of vinegar to oil I prepared for this being too tangy for me but to my surprise it wasn't at all.  This will be a perfect part of the menu for our Memorial Day cook-out this evening.

This is awesome!  Due to personal preference, I omitted the corn, added finely chopped red onion, and exchanged the fresh jalapeno for a huge spoonful of canned diced jalapenos. Thanks!

This was good--very similar to Poor Man's Caviar, also from this site. I think my boyfriend forgot to add the lime juice, because I ended up adding just a touch more vinegar. I also added hot sauce for a little more bite. We used fresh, raw corn and red pepper instead of canned Mexicorn.

This is an excellent salad. I took a cue from some of the other reviewers and served it in pitas. Deliciious! Someone before me said it needs more heat & I agree.

This is a fantastic and healthy recipe. I didn't give it 5 stars only because I used it as a topper for salad with grilled chicken slices. The lime and the black beans make this a great salad!

I liked this salad but thought it could use a few changes.  The apple cider vinegar was a bit over powering, I would add a more mild vinegar next time.  I did double the dressing because the amount the recipe called for barely wetted the salad. After eating a few bites I did add some cilantro for a little extra flavor, as I thought it lacked something.  Also I served it over lettuce and it was kind of bland when the lettuce was added. In the future, I would serve this as a side to have with a more substantial meal.

Great summer salad.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I added a bit more lime juice (probably about a tablespoon.)  It tasted great.  After I prepared it and tasted it (it was great as is) I added some chopped cilantro because I had some I wanted to use up.  It was good as well but I think next time, I won't add the cilantro, I liked it better without (and I usually like cilantro quite a bit.)  Ate it with tortilla chips.  Great!!  I will take this to cookouts often.  I have to eat gluten free and this will be a great dish to take that won't make me jealous that I can't eat most of the other stuff!!

This ws really good. We served it over baby spinach for supper, then left overs today  put in a pita. The flavors were wonderful.  Wil definately make this again, maybe play with the seasonings a little.  The cumin goes nicely with the black beans.

This is a wonderful and refreshing addition to any Mexican dish or even to use as a dip.  I added cilantro and just used plain sweet corn instead of the Mexicorn.  The cumin makes this salad pop with flavor.  I will definitely make this again.

I typically make this as a sort of dip to go with tortilla chips at parties. People LOVE it and always ask for the recipe. I usually substitute canned diced green chiles (drained) for the jalapeno and add a few splashes of hot sauce to the dressing for a flavor change. I've also added finely chopped cilantro with great success.

LOVE IT!!! Very light and flavorful. We had it over a bed of crisp roman lettuce. I also doubled the avocado and tomato, and added a teaspoon of sugar to the sauce. Will be making this again.

Only thing I changed was to leave out the jalapeno and add black olives. A great salad. We ate it "as-is" and then the leftovers as a nacho topping.  Very yummy!

This was just ok for me.  Most people who did eat it did so with tortilla chips.  It wasn't bad at all, nice flavor just didn't blow my socks off.

Wonderful recipe.  I added celery, yellow peppers & an extra can of beans so I could have left overs for lunches.  And with that I tripled the dressing to have enough.  So, so good!

This is really good...I'm quite surprised at how easy it is, and how wonderful the dressing tastes.  I personally would prefer a bit more jalapeno, but that could also be because I opted to leave out the Mexicorn, so it may have needed a bit more heat for me.  I also added a touch of garlic salt...maybe 1/2 teaspoon, just for a little more flavor.  I think the addition of Garbanzo beans could also be good.  Thanks for sharing!

Very tasty - I think it definitely needs some cilantro, or if you're not a fan, maybe some fresh parsley.  Only change I made was to use some roasted corn and a little extra jalapenos.  Even the kids enjoyed this! Wasn't too spicy and it's very pretty and delicious.

This salad was so light and refreshing. I didn't feel like dealing with the hassle of peeling a jalapeno, so I just used diced green chilies. Even my husband who doesn't like cucumbers really liked it!

This is really great! I pretty much followed the recipe except for I didn't have green onions so I added some chopped vidalia onion, and also some red wine vinegar in addition to the cider vinegar. It's a unique blend of flavor and very "summer-y"! Thanks!

This has been a staple in our fridge all summer. I'll be sad to see the winter come because we won't be able to get fresh produce, but we probably will continue to make this over and over again.

Some modifications we've made include leaving out the olive oil and corn, and adding cilantro. We've also added chipotle powder for added spice.

Just a note that I realized I hadn't mentioned, we also use this primarily as a chip dip, which tends to be a favorite.

This salad was great! I added 4 times the amount of lime juice.  And I also omitted the corn and added fresh peas instead.  It was a total hit.  I served it with halved whole wheat small pita, and salty crackers.  The salty crackers were a nice contrast to the bite of the vinegar and lime.

This recipe was awesome!!  So tastely.  The only thing i did different was to double the sauce to make sure the ingredients soaked up enough flavor.  Yummy!!!

I don't like spicy things so i didn't add the jalapenos at all.. it was GREAT! so fresh and light yet hardy. This is a great make again. I think i'll add grilled shrimp next time.

I made this as a side dish for bbq steak and it was great. It was super easy to make and had a nice light summertime feel. I agree with the other reviewers in that I think it was missing a little something. Next time I think I might add more jalapeno or maybe red pepper for a little more heat.

I took this salad to a party and it was a huge hit.  For me, it was missing just a lil something, but I love all the ingredients put together in this unique manner.

A little too cumin-y for me.  I added more lime juice and salt, which would up my rating to 4*.

This salad was delicious. I couldn't find any jalapenos so I just chopped some onion and added it to the salad. It was a big hit! As my husband says, it's a keeper!

I liked it okay, my husband didn't really care for it (he told me he wasn't really a "cold-salad" kind of guy)!  I served it over lettuce and gave my daughters ranch dressing.  I tasted theirs and liked it better with the ranch.  I probably won't make it again.  I think it's a great idea, but just doesn't suit our tastes so much!

Very tasty!  I added a tiny bit of sugar to the dressing, it goes great with the tartness of the lime.

This is a great salad!  Everything about it is just perfect.  I did not put it over lettuce, but I think it would be good that way also!

This was fabulous!  I left out the corn and it was still great.  I put it over a bed of lettuce and enjoyed a yummy healthy salad.
