I added grated cheese instead of mushroom and onions on top of the ham, and then added pepper and parsley flakes on top of the eggs when I baked them. It is delicious.

Made this and was extremely pleased with the outcome  but I changed some things.  I whisked the eggs and spooned them in the ham lined muffin cups over the mushroom/onion  mix. Baked until eggs had set and sprinkled with shredded cheese and chopped green onions.  THEY WERE SOOOOO GOOD!!!! Almost like mini omelets.

So yummy. I added some chopped cappicola ham to the onion and mushroom.  Scrambled the egg and sprinkled a little cheese on top. Cooked for 20 minutes.
Will make again!

I like to do this when we have company for breakfast.  If you don't have coconut oil don't run to the store.  Vegetable oil or olive oil works just fine.

I enjoyed this breakfast! It's so easy to personalize to your own preferences. I used red peppers instead of the mushrooms because it's what I had. I also put a spinach leaf or two in the bottom of each cup just for more veggies. I did need to add just a light sprinkle of salt to the top of each egg. The cook time is perfect for me as the egg yolks are lightly set. I made only enough for my breakfast this time, but I'm thinking these would make a great grab and go breakfast with leftovers for the week.

Easy and delicious.  I will definitely make this recipe again. I substituted sauteed zucchini and onion for the mushrooms since we don't eat them.

Second time I added chopped Brussels sprouts and it was even better.

What a great breakfast idea! 
I changed it up some, cause I was workin' on limited supplies at the time, but ...  I made some w/1 slice of ham and some w/2 slices (my ham was thin and I thought 1 piece might tear when I try to lift them out after cookin').  Added shredded sharp cheddar cheese, then the egg, and sprinkled some scallions on top, and then pepper.  Let it cook for 15  min's, (the eggs looked wobbly still) then cooked it for another 7 min's. They came out  w/the ham edges a lil blackened at the very edge on some, but the eggs were done perfectly for me, not runny, but not completely set either.
Added some hot sauce and breakfast was served!
I would def recommend making these and adding your own spin on ingredients to make them perfect for you.
Next time I'm addin' jalapeno's.

I made it this morning for breakfast for my wife and myself.  Very tasty....good eats!!

I made a few changes.  First, I used a minnie loaf pan as the ham slices we had were rectangular in shape.   Next I added some chopped red sweet pepper to the onion and mushrooms and sautéed them in butter adding a couple pinches of salt.  Also I added a slice of  hot capicola  with the ham in each section.  After I spooned the sautéed veggies on top of the ham and hot capicola I topped the veggies with about 2 teaspoons of shredded cheddar and pepper jack cheese.  Finally, I cracked each egg into a bowl and scrambled it a bit with a fork before pouring it into its section over the other ingredients. I ground some pepper on top of the eggs but added no salt to them as the salt from the ham, hot capicola and veggies would season the eggs just right.  I baked them in a preheated  oven at 400 degree oven for 13 minutes.  The eggs came out well set but still moist.  YUM, YUM

I only had onions, so I caramelized them. I placed the ham slices, topped them with the onions, folded a half slice of American cheese on top, then cracked the eggs over each. I wish that I had used a muffin tin, because some of the white ran off and it took a longer time to set the white than I liked. The yolks turned out well done. Next time I will use a muffin pan, plan to add a veggie along with the onions, and season the eggs with at least some salt. Breakfast for dinner! Thanks!

Noobie cook, definitely NOT a chef!
Forgot to saute the veggies.  Added shredded cheese on the veggiegs.  Remembered before putting the egg on, so I took out all the vegs and started over.  The veggies ended up in a salad.
Simple recipe if you just remember the steps!  Can use almost anything.  Even made one with sliced chicken for Mrs. Me.

My family loved this different alternative to eggs! I added chanterelle mushrooms (because they grow literally, just beyond our back yard!) and celery, both finely chopped. It was  a big hit - my teenage son even said "I would eat this again!"

I just used the ham, egg and put a little shredded cheese on too. I’ve also made these with egg substitute which is really easy to pour into the muffin cup.

I make these all the time. I'm making the cardinal sin of rating and posting even though I make these a little different 
(without the mushrooms and onion and usually just use ham, egg, sea salt and freshly ground pepper).  Sometimes we add grated Parmesan cheese (the real stuff, not the garbage in the green can) for a change.

I had to rate this in order to post a question. 

Can you make this in a microwave?
