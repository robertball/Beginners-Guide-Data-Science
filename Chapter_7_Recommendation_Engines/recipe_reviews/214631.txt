This is my recipe and I find the calorie count a little shocking.  I've tried to research and so far I've come up with a TOTAL for the WHOLE recipe of only 663 calories.  So how do they come up with 459 Calories per SERVING?  I use only the chicken breast, no skin, a salad dressing of 40 cal per Tbsp, sweet relish has only 15 cal per Tbsp......?
I would also like to say ThankYou for your kind reviews. That is the minimum jalapeno I add, often it is a LOT more ;) . Today I used chopped pecans (pine nuts are expensive here too!) I think just about any nut meat would work.

Fixed as written and it was very good. I think I would add some of the juice from the jar of jalapeno peppers to add more heat. I also think that roasting the pine nuts would bring out the nutty flavor of the pine nut. As it was written, the pine nuts added a wonderful texture to the salad. Will definately fix again with these few tweaks!

Yummy! Great textures and flavor. I added an extra 1/2 jalepeno for an additional kick and served on lettuce leaves with tomato.

I liked this a lot--it's a spicy take on a chicken salad and I liked the addition of the pine nuts. Didn't have celery so I used yellow bell pepper for crunch. Even though I liked this after tasting it I felt it lacked something so I added dried cranberries. That made it spicy sweet and savory all at once and kicked it up to where I wanted it. That's a personal preference though--as a recipe this is a neat take on chicken salad sandwiches. Thanks for the recipe!

This is tasty not as spicy as I expected it to be. The pepper adds a nice kick but isnt overpowering. Pine nuts are about 10 for a very small container in my area. I used sliced almonds since I had them on hand. Thanks for a nice recipe!

Great recipe for leftover chicken. Add a little of this and a touch of that to make it match your taste buds.

Such a refreshing taste. I ate it 4 days in a row as a mid-day snack. Easy to make and great tasting. I will make this often. One thing is that I did not eat it with bread or roll. I ate it in a bowl. Perfect if you are watching your carb intake.

This is a fantastic recipe! The heat is just enough and the Pine Nuts add another crunch. I modified a few things from availability of items in my kitchen.
