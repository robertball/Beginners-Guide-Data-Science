I actually joined allrecipes.com just to tell people how delicious this recipe is!  
I changed a little:
Instead of boiling the ribs in water, I wrapped the spareribs in tin foil twice, and baked in the over for 1 and 1/2 hours at 350.  Then drained off the excess grease, and continued as shown.
Oh, and I also added 1/3 cup coconut to the marinade.
Just delicious.  Thank you!

This was pretty good. Cooked it in the slow cooker rather than grill it but still marinated it over night. Tasted pretty good. The flavors were subtle but there

This recipe was okay. If I make them again I will add another chili pepper. With all ingredient I thought it would have at least a little kick. Really kind of mild for my taste. As we all know a recipe can be changed to ones own taste.

I had to make a few revisions because I didn't have the fresh ginger or chilies on hand (I used spices) but this recipe was great. I left it to marinate two nights because I had a scheduling conflict, but it smelled great and was pretty easy to make!

I sooo want to give it another star but, I need to make it again and see if by marinating it longer, the taste is stronger... It actuall tastes really great but, I want more kick to it.... I would still recommend this recipe though... Thanks, Crumbsnatcher

I have never used lime before but will absolutely use it again.  I used pork chops instead of ribs and cooked in the slow cooker.   Different and delicious.
