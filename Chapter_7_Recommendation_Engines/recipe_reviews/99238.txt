It's O.K. to put the onions and garlic in your water, you can even add potatoes ans corn on the cob but you must add either liquid or powder crab boil to the water (liquid proferred).  Also, after the water is boiling, add the crawfish and boil for only 7 minutes.  When done, remove from water and put into a large sealable container so they can steam out.  A good idea is to sprinkle with tony's seasoning or powered crab boil before closing up.  Allow to sit for about 15 minutes then eat.  One other thing, if you only have 10 pounds of crawfish you better be eating alone.

I am from Louisiana and eat boiled crawfish all the time. I have never heard of adding jalapenos or celery to the boil. Plus 10 lbs of crawfish is NOT ALOT! The weight counts for the whole crawfish, shell and meat. You also must have some sort of seasoning, being powdered or liquid.

You need cayenne pepper,liquid crab boil,and crab boil season. Don't boil for 20 minutes--7 minutes should be the max and cut off the fire or heat and let soak for 20.

ummm.  NO!!!!!!   like others, I live in south Louisiana and this in not the way to eat boiled crawfish. if you think this is good your missing out on what crawfish really taste like. liquid crab boil and powder crab boil until spicy enough.  onions, garlic, sausage, lemon, celery and potatoes boiled for 12 to 15 mins. and 20 pounds of crawfish minimum and boil for 3 to 5 minutes. throw corn o. the cob in when fire is off, soak for 25.  I have won a few competitions cooking crawfish this way.

Works great with lobster.  Added Old Bay into the mix.
