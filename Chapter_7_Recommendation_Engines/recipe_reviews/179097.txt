We had these as part of our Superbowl party food.  I was not too impressed and I think it was the Dijon mustard that we didn't like.  I made the recipe just as written but with home made italian bread crumbs.  The concept is great and the meat was moist and attractive.  If I try this again I will change from the mustard to something else.  I was glad we also had lots of Bar-B-Qued drumsticks as well.  Thank you for the recipe and I see that others liked it better than we did.

The chicken tasted great after is was cooked properly.  I baked it for 1 hour covered and it still wasn't done so I cooked it for 30 minutes uncovered and it was perfect. My advice is to just keep an eye on it when it gets close to being done.  It was very yummy once I figured out cooking time.

These were awesome, but I cooked them uncovered, so had to cook them much longer. I'll cover them next time. Everyone loved them!

Delicious! I used more chicken broth, and it turned out great. The meat fell off the bones, wonderful flavor

I used my own bread crumbs, which are Italian seasoned bread that I "crumb" myself. I let them set for the time stated before cooking so they stuck to the chicken. I totally covered them in the crumbs also. I cooked a little longer as we like a more "dry" drumstick. Good flavor. Use a good mustard, maybe will try another flavor next time.

Very tasty and easy! The drumsticks were moist and the coating was crunchy. Will make again.

Great recipe! I modified it to be more of a casserole by using Cream of Chicken soup and added a touch of garlic. Rave reviews from my sons. Next time I'll make it with chicken breasts.

This is a great recipe!  I had parmesean croutons and it turned out great with those!  It was easy and if you use a disposable baking dish the clean up is a cinch!  This was kid tested and approved at my house.  We will be making this again.
