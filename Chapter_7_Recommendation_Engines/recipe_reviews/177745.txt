Outstanding.  I could not find the pepperidge farm shells, so I used pillsbury crescent rounds (cut them each in half and pressed them into the tart cups).  Then put the cheese mixture in and baked them for about 7 or 8 minutes until golden brown.  Fabulous mix of flavors! two pkgs of rolls gave me 32 tarts.  Just the right amount when I doubled the cheese mixture!

These are a great and very easy appetizer to make. The only issue I had with this was making it into 24 servings. The shells come 6 to a package, which means you have to cut each one into 1/4ths, and that just makes a mess out of them. I left them whole and served that way. Flavor was great and I added more sundried tomatoes for extra flavor.. very good and will use again! :)

We didn't care for this. If you're trying this recipe, please, soften your sun-dried tomatoes first. Thank you anyway!

This was a really neat concept and tasted great!  We had problems with the scaling and made 6 of them which were about right for a single, hearty appetizer.  Delicious!  I'm going to play around with this one to adjust the filling, but I loved how almost everything could be prepped ahead of time!  Definitely use sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil.

I added a dash of red pepper and used 1 tsp dried parsley (recipe didn't specify fresh or dry, but I though 1 Tbsp sounded like too much if using dry). Filling is great. Hubby loved it. I used phyllo dough instead of puff pastry, neither of us liked the phyllo. When I make this again, will only use puff pastry!

I tried this recipe for a holiday party we were hosting.  It was quite tasty and enjoyed by everyone.  My only complaint is the size of the pastry shells.  They are very large for an appetizer serving.  I will look for a smaller puff pastry to use next time.  I doubled the amount of cheese/artichoke mixture and it worked out well for the large shells.  Overall they are very yummy!

These are delicious and easy. The shells can be hard to find and it really only makes 6 servings, so it's annoying thinking you have 24-that's why you read the recipe 1st I guess! :) I have made these multiple times now. I did use pastry sheets and put them into mini muffin pans for small tarts and that was good. Other than that, followed recipe exactly. :) Enjoy!

Yummy and fun app. I had left over shells from making eclairs and it worked perfectly! I also added a bit extra artichoke and sundried tomatoes :)

I made these on Mother's Day.  Like some of the other reviewers, I kept the pastry shells whole and just made 6. Very easy to make. They were gone in seconds!

Very nice filling.  Some of the other reviewers comments on the size of the 6 (not 24 mini) pastry shells is very large--more of a brunch side dish then an appetizer.  My family's only complaint was the pastry was "a bit too much" so I would increase the filling by 50% or I think even better is one of the other reviewer's suggestions to instead use puff pastry sheets cut in small squares and then baked in mini muffin cups to get nice sized appetizers.  We used sun dried tomatoes that were not in oil, and had no complaint with their texture--perhaps different brands have different moisture contents.
