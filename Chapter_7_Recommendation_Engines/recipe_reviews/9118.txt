I think this recipe started out on the wrong foot. Ten minutes is plenty of time to boil walnut sized boiling onions. (30 minutes kills them) Making the cream sauce / roux was a snap. I even used potato starch instead of wheat flour. Everything was delicious till I added the lemon juice. The sauce tried to curdle into tiny lumps. The lemon was supposed to thicken or add flavor? The lemony taste did not pair well with the sage and mushrooms. I think this would be a great recipe made with fresh sage, Half and Half and no lemon.

This had fabulous consistency and presentation.  It was yummy too.  I did leave out the lemon zest and added a clove of garlic, and sprinkled just a hint of nutmeg over top wit the sweet paprika and parsely (which I did NOT use the whole amount the recipe calls for).  The taste was well-rounded and good.  I will say the sage was a bit over powering, and although I love sage, I will use less next time.  
Overall, though a good one.  I'd also want a few more mushroom next time...but good, solid recipe!!

Good recipe. I leave out the salt. Don't be tempted to use jarred or frozen onions in this. They just don't have the same flavor as fresh. For each in prep time, don't peel onions before boiling. Boil, then the peels can be just slipped off very easily.

great accommpaniment, to any main course, works the best with beef or fowl, I think.  Prepare it ahead, and just bake in the oven for 30 mins.

Creamed onions have always been a part of Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner.  I have made them for well over 45 years and never thought of having Sage in them which seems to be a natural as it works with the sage in the dressing.  I do use frozen pearl onions (cook for half the time) and I make it a day or two ahead and heat while the turkey sets.  I also never thought about adding mushrooms and will try that also.  The lemon I will probably omit.  Love to read the way others treat a pretty standard recipe and this one is a winner.

thses were excellent and had a nice presentation (before i smashed them up and mixed them around with the sauce) on my plate. also, i was unsure about the "dry sage" as the store only had "ground" sage, so i used fresh, and used it liberally considering dried herbs often have a stronger flavor. i was concerned that the sauce was too salty when i tasted it, but once served with the onions, it all balanced out.

Prepared this for Thanksgiving this year and it was a hit.  I prepared with frozen pearl onions, just boiled about 6 minutes or so per package directions, and made the sauce as written.  Found it was a tad bland, so I added more fresh sage and more salt and white pepper.  I like the addition of the lemon, but next time I make these I think I'll use sherry or white wine.  I prepared a day in advance, refrigerated, and baked 350* for about 40 minutes or so before serving.  Tasty and received rave reviews.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

This was pretty good. It complimented the turkey I made. I used a bag of the frozen pearl onions. There was enough sauce for two bags of onions. I made this the day before with the exception of the baking. Did that the next day. You wouldn't know it was done the day before.

This was a hit at Christmas, beautifully complimenting the Prime Rib.  Several family members expressed interest in making it a traditional side at Christmas.  I made it ahead of time and refrigerated it.  Several reviews on this site expressed a dislike of the lemon zest and juice, but we really liked it - the key to that flavor is the zest, so if you aren't going to use zest then skip the lemon altogether.  We'll definitely be making this again!

These were very good. I added some garlic in with the mushrooms. I would shorten the cooking time on the onions to 25 minutes.

These were good.  They smelled fantastic while they were baking.  I would reduce the amount of time that the onions boil.  They were a little sweeter that I expected but it was a nice, different side dish.

You must like sage in order to like this recipe. And you must be patient to peel all those onions. Otherwise an easy recipe and a special treat. Would make again.

These weren't everything I'd hoped they'd be. My mom and I made them when we had some friends over who were on a pretty specific diet. No one seemed too impressed by them, but they weren't bad at all. I would make them again if I needed to use up onions or something, but not just for the recipe itself.

Fantastic. I also prepared the dish the night before and baked just before serving. I omitted the lemon. Next time I might experiment with substituting sour cream for part of the cream. It seemed a bit "milky." I served it over perogis. Also, I didn't know what "small onions" referred to--pearl or shallots? I used shallots.

This is a keeper - would be great for company.  I couldn't find good fresh onions so I used one jar of small whole onions, fresh mushrooms and cut the cream sauce in half.  It was sooooo good.  I wouldn't hesitate to use jarred onions again (definitely cuts preperation time down!).  Thanks submitter.

I really don't like creamed onions but I made this for my mother who enjoys creamed onions. Everyone loved them even the ones who normally don't eat creamed onions. Excellent recipe.

This was great!  We will keep it as a holiday tradition.  The hint of lemon flavor as you bite into the onions was amazing. Everyone even asked to take some home.

This recipe was a huge sucess.  I recently married and my husband invited his 6 brothers and sisters, complete with families over for Thanksgiving.  Now, I have been cooking for my family (second marriage) for years, but always Italian.  I married a man of Polish - Hungarian desent, and creamed onions were a Thanksgiving tradition.  I got raves for this dish.

Excellent.  4 stars because I thought the lemon was just a little overwhelming and it needed more salt.  Next time, I will omit the lemon zest.

Very good, love the mushrooms!  I will probably make changes next time, probably have to submit them as a separate recipe.  I added garlic (1 clove), and it was very good with it.

I was skeptical of the sage but this recipe is awesome. The guests were raving about the flavour!

I wasn't thrilled about the lemon in this recipe, but will try again omitting the lemon and probably add some garlic.  Makes a nice presentation!
