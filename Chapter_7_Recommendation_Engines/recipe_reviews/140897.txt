This was absolutely wonderful!  Of course, you must like smoked salmon to enjoy this rich, delicious chowder.  I was a little suspicious of 1/2 cup flour for the roux, but it turned out wonderfully, I added a total of 8 cups of chicken stock and a little extra pinch of each herb.  Don't skip the tarragon, it adds a wonderful dimension to this chowder.  Because of all of the flour, the lemon and wine are very important to giving this a tang, again, don't skip them.  I used smoked salmon from our local gourmet store.  The rich arroma this fills the house with!  This would be terrific for the holidays!  I topped with shredded cheddar, and served with cheddar/garlic biscuits.  Sincere thanks for sharing! A definite keeper.

I am the Salyers' ten year old son and I made this for dinner one night. Every one adored it except my five year old brother. We did not have all the ingredients so I did some minor adjustments.I used evaporated milk instead of cream and we used canned salmon( take the big bones out) with a little liquid smoke.We also did not have any tarragon or white wine.
Enjoy! All 7 of us did!!

Having grown up in the Pacific Northwest, I am an expert on salmon chowder.  This is a wonderful, authentic recipe, and I really like the fact that it's "sensible" in fat (as opposed to having cups of cream in it).  I followed the recipes as it was written, and was very pleased with the result.  A definite keeper!

Rich tasting. Leave out the half & half & the salt. Only cook the salmon 5 minutes or drys out. Use sodium reduced chicken broth is salty enough.

Easy and elegant, although I find it's easy to over-salt this dish. It can vary some in taste each time I make it but it's always good. P.S. If you're looking for a partner dish to serve to guests, try pairing it quiche and crusty bread.

Wow! DH and I loved this. Very tasty and simple to make. I made a few changes: skipped the dill, used low fat evaporated milk, and added corn and white beans.

I made this exactly as written with the exception of not peeling my red potatoes. :-) Served with a tossed green salad and French garlic bread.  It was very good, Hils.  Thank you from your neighbor on the Olympic Peninsula!

Amazing flavor ... we all loved it.  I lightly poached some fresh salmon and then flaked it into chunks in place of the smoked salmon since I didn't have smoked salmon.

Next time I make it, I am adding more potatoes too .... there is plenty of flavor to handle more substance from additional potatoes in my opinion.

Awesome recipe.  Thanks for sharing it.

Scrumptious!!  My husband made this tonight.  Followed the suggestions by other reviewers to use unpeeled red potatoes and added a can of corn.  We had fresh salmon on hand, so used that instead of smoked. "pure PNW comfort food" indeed!

Made this again, more than 10 years later, and it is still delicious. Yum! 12/16/2008 I added a lot more garlic than the recipe called for, and 4oz. more salmon. This recipe was delicious my boyfriend and I devoured it, with crusty bread on the side.

This was very good chowder.  After reading all the reviews I chose to follow the recipe as written.  The only ingredient I did not have was tarragon and I made my own 1/2 & 1/2 using heavy cream and milk.  The 1/2 cup of flour makes it hard to call that step a roux  because it is so dry.  I added a little chicken stock to make it more of a paste.  The important part of this step is to make sure you "cook" the flour so it doesn't taste like paste:)  My soup thickened up nicely and I had no issues with a runny chowder.  I had no issue with the chowder being salty, but I use very good organic chicken broth.  I usually have to add salt when I use the broth, but after tasting the smoked salmon (which can be salty) I decided not to season with salt and I'm glad I made that decision.  I think this is one of those recipes that you really need to us good quality ingredients.  I would also recommend sampling your smoked salmon to make sure it is not real salty.  You can always season at the end- much easier then fixing something that is to salty.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  We love soup and this one is a good, tasty filling one.  I can not wait to eat the leftovers for lunch today.

Awesome chowder... The perfect way to use up some leftover smoked salmon.  I followed the directions except for leaving the peels on the potatoes and cooking them on low instead of medium because I didn't want the potatoes to fall apart; after adding the cream I only simmered until it was heated (about 10 min).  Also subbed about 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper for the hot sauce!  Great on a cold day with crusty french bread! ;)

This was dinner tonight and am I ever glad for that. Really simple and delicious soup/chowder that will be on the rotation for a good long time. I happened to have vegetable broth on hand and used that. I don't like the taste of tarragon, so I didn't use that. Everything else was exactly as written except I had a small amount of leftover mashed potatoes that I added in addition to the red potatoes I used. That was fine because it did give the chowder a nice thick consistency. My daughter was rather skeptical at the thought of a smoked salmon chowder but after she tasted it, all doubt was erased. Thanks so much for submitting a true taste of the Northwest from a resident of the Northwest.

I don't eat fish chowders normally, but this one was fantastic!  We made it gluten free by adding mashed cauliflower instead of the flour.  We also used frozen salmon instead of smoked.  It was still delicious!  Wow!

Great recipe, loved the herb blend and subtleties of flavor.  A word to the wise: don't salt it at all until all is done; some smoked salmon is very salty & you don't want to overdo.  Taste it before adding salt!  Mine was perfect without any added salt.  Only things I did different was I thickened it with 6 T. instant mashed potatoes instead of flour to make a gluten-free, wheat free soup, and used vermouth instead of white wine because that's what I had available.  I'm going to try this base for other chowders too!  My BF loved it!

This is fabulous.   I followed the recipe to the letter.  I couldn't believe it was low calorie, so I added it all back up myself.  I was pleasantly surprised at how spicy it is.  If you don't like yours spicy, you may want to reduce the paprika and hot sauce.  It is wonderful as is, but I think it would also be a great base to try with grilled chicken or other meats also.  Then my husband could eat it too!

Wow -- this was fantastic! I was upset to discover halfway through that I didn't have any tarragon in the house, but it was too late to turn back. It still turned out great! I used fat free half and half and it just couldn't have been better. I almost never cook the same thing twice, but I will definitely be making this again for Christmas -- after I buy some tarragon. Thanks for an awesome recipe!

I had to try it............I substituted some cream cheese for the half and half.   OMG!!  So amazingly good!!!!  I also tried adding some canned corn and mushrooms.  For the paprika, I used smoked paprika.  These were all wonderful additions.   The recipe itself is a excellent blend of flavors and is a wonderful base for all sorts of experiments with variations.

After reading all the reviews, I made this for company.  I used no extra salt and extra potatoes per some of the reviews.  We have a ton of smoked salmon in the freezer so I used a little extra.  I did leave out the wine only because a guest cant have any.  Because I strongly dislike overcooked salmon I added it last and cooked for only 5-6 minutes, again per some of the reviews.  Thank you so much for this recipe, I had never heard of smoked salmon chowder.  We are going to be making this again and again!  Everyone loved it, good thing I doubled the recipe!    =-)

I used this recipe for the basic idea and technique.  Added diced carrots with the celery/onion/garlic, did not have chicken broth but added some dried fish powder, used canned salmon, skim milk instead of 1/2 and 1/2 and accidentally used a little too much hot sauce.  It was delicious, warming and filling and I am enjoying the leftovers. I am sure it would be outstanding with smoked salmon and creamier with 1/2 and 1/2.

This chowder recipe is outstanding! I would definitely recommend seeking out wild Alaska salmon, as I've found the flavor is much better than Atlantic farmed salmon (better for the environment too). BTW, like others, I added almost a cup of corn. I also thinly sliced the potatoes (1/8 inch or so) for a different presentation. Yum!

Pretty good. Made this for dinner tonight. I'm not a fan, so I'd give 3 stars for that reason alone, but am not going to dock a recipe its worthy star just because I didn't care for it (there's nothing wrong with hils' recipe; it's just not my thing, I guess) so I am awarding 4 stars. Because I only had 2 (14.5) oz. cans of chicken broth on hand, I decided to scale this to make 5 servings (in this case, I should have used 3 3/4 cup broth, but didn't want to waste the 1/4 cup that was left, so I used all 4 cups of it). I could only find a 4 oz. package of Jim Beam brand smoked salmon, so I didn't use the 5 oz. called for. My only other change was adding 1 small carrot (chopped) to my chowder simply because I had it on hand and wanted to use it up. I used a good 'ol russet potato and a good quality smoked Spanish paparika that I purchased at my local spice shop. My choice of wine was chardonnay. Served in sourdough bread bowls (thank goodness for Panera Bread Co.!), this was a hearty and warming meal. I'm sure this would be good topped with seasoned oyster crackers too, and if I had them on hand, I would have. Even though this is not for me (and my fiance is not a big fan of chowder anyways), I am glad I gave it a try. The smoky flavor was the best part, so don't skimp - use real smoked salmon! Thanks for sharing your recipe, hils :)

I made this exactly as written with one very important exception - I didn't add the 1 tsp. salt. Truly, it's not needed and I think it would have ruined the finished product by making it too salty.
I think some other reviews could leave some readers confused. This really isn't a cajun dish, BUT it does call for hot sauce. If you don't like spicy food, don't add the hot sauce (or add just a teeny tiny bit - it really does add a wonderful dimension to the chowder). Lots of folks don't like the taste of tarragon and/or dill - leave either out if you're one of them. I think these herbs add a lovely complexity to the dish, but hey, if you don't like them, it won't work for you. And if you're watching calories or fat/cholesterol levels, then you could use a lower fat alternative to the half and half. Yes, it adds a richness, but thanks to all the other wonderful ingredients, it will be almost as rich and decadent with a lighter version.

I bet this soup, when made correctly, is the bomb! The way I made it, bombed! I screwed it up, probably by NOT using fresh salmon. I used canned. So note to self, use fresh salmon the next time. 
The end.

I have made this recipe several times.  I have not varied from the ingredients.  The smoked salmon I have used is wild smoked salmon from Costco, which you purchase in two 8 oz. packages. and I cut it up small -- 1 " squares.  I did cut down on the fat content by adding 1/2 milk with the half and half. The dill really makes it.  Everyone in our home loves this recipe.    Thanks for a great recipe!

What a fabulous recipe. Making do with what I had in my kitchen I used 4 c. of chicken stock, 2 c. water, left out the tarragon and wine. I had smoked salmon from Haida Gwaii, this was an excellent way to use it and the chowder was even better the next day.

Awesome recipe!  I followed it to a "T" except for the tarragon which I didn't have and I cut down on the salt as my chicken broth was rather salty.  VERY good!!

This was an excellent chowder, a perfect blend of ingredients and wonderful texture, the smokiness from the smoked salmon makes this dish. Next time I make this chowder I will try using sherry for the wine and add the lemon juice to taste or offer lemon wedges off to the side for each person to add to their liking.

Oh my goodness, this is absolutely amazing!  Made exactly as written and everyone raved.  It had a great little kick to it and was creamy and delicious.  I served it with Savory Bubble Bread from this site and that was a nice match.  Love it, love it, love it!

It’s important to note that this is a heavily Cajun flavored soup. If I were judging this for its Cajun flavor, I would give it a perfect 10.  It tastes likes it’s loaded with spicy smoked andouille sausage.   Unfortunately, I have to be in the mood for a Cajun dish of this caliber and that's not what I had in mind when I set out to make this.   I love smoked salmon and was hoping for a recipe that highlighted the delicate and wonderful flavor of a good quality smoked salmon, not cover it up so you can’t taste it.  Sorry, just not a combination that worked for me.

Fabulous recipe! I also left out the salt, and added the hot sauce at the table.  Don't scrimp on the full fat half and half, fat free would not give it the same wonderful consistency.  Kids and adults alike all enjoyed this.  This is a perfect chowder for a rainy Pacific Northwest day.  Thanks for sharing!

Just finished making a batch with some smoked salmon that a friend's husband caught and that I was lucky to receive.  This is a flavorful chowder that's hearty enough for a rainy Seattle day.  I did add three bacon strips chopped up very small, in with the butter and olive oil and the other ingredients at the beginning and it really gave a little more boost to the already flavorful broth.  Very easy to make too!

This turned out delicious! I added some crab & corn too and then sprinkled a little shredded, aged white cheddar on top! Yum... Easy to follow recipe! My husband LOVED it! He added more hot sauce to his once it hit the table. Says it was "Perfect"...

Absolutely incredible - jam packed with flavor, beyond restaurant quality.  I cooked this in my slow cooker for about 4 hours so that everything would mix together and the salmon wouldn't get dried out.  I added corn and fresh mushrooms which added even more flavor.  Because my girlfriend is lactose intolerant, I replaced the half & half with 1/2 cup coconut milk creme (one can, the stuff that settles at the top) and 1/2 cup lactaid brand lactose-free milk.  Worked like a charm.  Thanks for this recipe - yet another Northwest/Seattle person.

I could have sworn I rated this already!  Anyway, we had some leftover smoked salmon a couple of weeks ago, and I didn't want it to go to waste, so I decided to make this.  It was quite the ordeal, I don't know if the flour/butter/veggie ratio is off or what, but I couldn't get my roux to turn out right.  It may have been my pot b/c I had problems w/ it later (will explain in a minute), but the roux just wouldn't set up right, and I've made roux many times, and never had a problem.  Anyway, then it took over an hour to get it to simmer, this is why I think I had a problem w/ the pot, maybe it was too big or something, (just a regular stock pot), but the chowder was very thin and runny, never did thicken up, and I cooked it for HOURS!  It could have been user error, but I was just frustrated by the end of the process.  However it did have a good flavor and my son gobbled it up, so all in all I would call it a success.  Will try again, in a few months!!  lol

I thought I had celery but turns out I didn't so I used green bell pepper instead. I am not a huge salmon or cream based soup fan but I was very impressed with this recipe. Celery would have been better and I didn't have tarragon (used extra dill instead) and this did turn out more of a soup than a chowder (add more flour if you like) but it had everything going for it. Great recipe that I will use for any leftover fish. Thanks!

Oh my goodness, this recipe is so good! Living just outside of Spokane WA, we are the backwoods of the Pacific Northwest. We do not have many stores that have good, quality seafood. We do, however, have one amazing little store that prides themselves on getting seafood from the coast which made this recipe so worth it. Give this a try and follow the recipe, you can't go wrong. It is seafood comfort food at its best.

OMG!!!!  Thos was the best chowder we ha ever had. I was afraid it might have a slight fishy taste from the smoked salmon, but the herbs, especially the dill and terragon added so much flavor the smoked salmon provided just a hint of smokey flavor to the chowder. I added a cup more broth and did not peel the potatoes. My hus and had a bad. Old and said this was exactly what he needed. A five ztR wAy to use leftover smoked salmon

I followed the recipe with one exception: I cut the added salt in half. It was delicious, but thin and the potatoes were a little underdone. I believe this was my fault and will try to cook the chowder after the potatoes are added at a higher temperature for a longer period of time.

This is a very good chowder, especially because it isn't overly creamy and the other flavors really shine through.  I added corn because we like that in our chowder and it was wonderful.  This is on our "Let's make it again!" list.

Overall, average recipe.  I and two kids said it was OK, but the third wouldn't eat more than the first bite.  I attempted to do a half recipe, which probably resulted in too long of a cooking time for the amounts.  As such, it was pretty thick at the end.  Nonetheless, I think it was probably close to the intended taste.  The tarragon taste was relatively strong, and I think this was the biggest turn off.

Great jumping off point for whatever seafood you've got on hand.  I added a carrot, jumbo prawns, and used Blue Russian potatoes in it and it was fantastic.  Thanks Mimi!

This was very, very good! My guests asked if I had any left overs to send home with them, of course I loved that. I will make this recipe again. We used a chum salmon that my husband caught and smoked. This was probably the best way to use it.

I did not like this soup.  May be the tarragon.  It was way too salty!!!

Love this recipe! We're dairy-free in our house, so I make this using soy creamer instead of heavy cream and margarine instead of butter—works wonderfully! I also add carrots if I have some on hand.

I grew up in Alaska and by far this is the best Salmon chowder I have had. Hats off to Mimi and this wonderful recipe. The only thing I changed was to add a can of corn. I'm sure a fresh ear of corn would have been better but it's all I had at the time.

This was excellent. We had too much salmon that we grilled and didnt want it to goto waste. i tried this recipe and i though it was great. I used all ingredients but the half and half. I would most certainly make this again

Very good.   I changed it a little - used fat free evaporated milk in place of cream, frozen salmon + liquid smoke, added peas and corn - but otherwise basically as written.  I would be happy to serve this to company any winter night.

We have made this many times.  My family likes salmon, so this is a flavour we enjoy.  Don't put salt until the end as your broth or fish might already be very salty.  We find it tastes best with organic chicken broth and you can make it with milk instead of cream. Love this recipe - delicious!

My first time having smoked salmon chowder and it was delicious. I didn't have tarragon or wine and I added corn. I also didnt cook it that long after adding the salmon. It was delicious! I used Coho smoked salmon from trader joes.

This was the best chowder I've EVER had!  I didn't put the wine in because I didn't have any and I threw in about 1 1/2 cups of chopped bacon.  We all thought it was worthy of being served in an upscale restaurant.  WOW!

Fantastic!  I followed the recipe exactly and was very pleased. The only change I would suggest is to cube the potatoes to 1/2-3/4 inch cubes rather than 1 inch.  Loved it!

I made this with homemade smoked whitefish instead of salmon.  I didn't have any half-and-half, and substituted an equal amount of 2% evaporated milk which worked perfectly.  If you are using a milder fish (we used pollack), I'd change the seasonings a bit.  The herbs overpower the fish.  Next time, I'll cut out the dill and tarragon.

We absolutely loved this.  It was so flavorful, rich, and warming.  It was wonderful.  I couldn't stop eating.  I didn't cook it as long as it stated; it was thick enough before that, so I just cooked until the potatoes were tender.  I've never used smoked salmon before- it gave the soup a wonderful flavor.  Thanks for this recipe.  We had it with Light Wheat Rolls.

DELISH! I added extra potato and used 2% milk instead of half and half.  Next time, I'll cut the salt in half.  Under no circumstances would I ever eliminate the white wine.  Will definitely make again.

Delicious! No celery or flour due to personal preference and more garlic; don't think that changes a thing about the goodness.  Any recipe requires common sense on what one likes.

Fabulous for a wintry night; the only thing I'd do differently next time (and there WILL be a next time!) is leave out the salt. Not sure it really needs the 30 minutes after the cream goes in either.

So good! If you can catch a deal on smoked salmon (check out Big Lots around the holidays, don't laugh:)), this is a great way to stretch it out and enjoy it as a hearty meal, rather than just as an occasional party treat!

Very tasty!  Didn't have tarragon so skipped that.  Used celery seed instead of celery because I was out, but the real stuff would be better.  Might try adding some bacon next time.  Could saute with the onions and perhaps replace some of the butter and/or olive oil with the bacon drippings.

Y U M ! ! !  This is delicious!  I bought smoked salmon from Costco & had too much so decided to try this chowder.  It was amazing!  I modified a little to cut the fat by using 1/2c half & half and 1/2c whole milk....probably didn't save that much fat but I felt better : - )   
I also threw a hand full of spinach the last 10 minutes of cooking the soup ( I love spinach in soups) and it added another dimension to the soup plus the green color in the soup looked beautiful!   This is definitely a keeper!!!!

I made this recipe weighing and measuring all the ingredients and it really fell short of the flavorful chowder I had hoped for.  I made several additions that saved the batch of chowder for me and mine.  I added twice the amount of smoked salmon and also threw in a small piece of flounder and sockeye.  I doubled the black pepper, added a bayleaf , a few splashes of worcestershire and some fresh parsley and green onions at the end.  I think I would start with bacon or at least bacon fat instead of the butter and olive oil.

I tweaked the recipe, adding more smoked salmon, plus some shrimp and a tilapia filet, along with more chx broth. Also doubled celery and added a whole carrot (chopped). With the extra ingredients, I found that it helps to increase the spice quantities a touch.

My cousin sent us a side of smoked Coho salmon from Alaska, and this was one of the first recipes I tried - we loved it! Thanks to previous commenters I did not peel the potatoes, did not add salt (so true). I did add a cup of corn. Also left the hot sauce on the table to accommodate differing perceptions of "hot". Additionally, I  can't eat white flour (bizarre, but true), so made the roux with whole wheat flour and it was fine, although I think the cauliflower idea is outstanding for next time. Otherwise made as described. Served with homemade buttermilk cheese bread (whole wheat flour again). Thanks for the memories of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, from the East Coast!

This is SO tasty, easy and definitely a keeper!! We added extra of the veggies/herbs/spices, then worsheshire, plus fresh parsley at the end because we love more of a kick. I didn't peal our red potatoes, love the extra color! We used 8C of liquid, half of it our own marrow broth and the other just water. 
We are printing this for future uses, yumm!

Very good.  Husband loved it.  I left out the tarragon and celery  but will add celery next time.  It would add a lot.  I started it with small white potatoes quartered, onion, and garlic in 3 cans of chicken broth in the crock pot.  Added the rest of the ingredients after the potatoes were done including a can of corn drained.  I added the half and half just before we ate and let it heat through.  I did not  use any flour, but thickened it to chowder consistency with instant potato flakes.

THANKS for this recipe.  We have a lot of smoked salmon in our freezer from a fishing trip and have decided we are not a fan of cold smoked salmon.  I needed something to make the salmon less "smoked/salty" flavored.

I had to make substitutions.  I didn't have half and half, or white wine, or tarragon.   I used less broth, whole milk mixed with a little sour cream. I skipped the white wine and tarragon.  It was too thick for the amount of salmon I used so I added some cream of mushroom soup to make it more "soupy."    I also added extra garlic.  We like it.

Would definitely make it again.  Used 3 tbsp butter, more onion and garlic ('cause you can never have too much of either), and a little more wine & lemon juice.  Useled little pink potatoes and sliced them up fairly small so I reduced that cooking time to 8 min.  and only cooked the whole thing for 15 min. and it was ready to eat.  Also used crushed red pepper since I couldn't locate the hot sauce readily.   Like any soup - I consider quantities as mere suggestions....

Made no changes except gluten free flour as I have issues with gluten.   My husband loves to smoke salmon, and he had just made a fresh batch.  He loved this chowder.  I enjoyed it too, but not quite as much as he did.  I served it to hubby with hot pretzel bun.  Thanks so much for great recipe!

This was really tasty. I used leek instead of celery (personal preference) and added some bacon in when sweating down the veggies, but other that followed the recipe. Very tasty. It's dishes like this that make me glad the hubby doesn't eat salmon - more for me :)

Absolutely the best chowder I've ever made, and it so good I've made it three more times before I could write this review. Whenever I've tried make chowder before it almost always turns out as a gray lumpy mess with the liquid separating from the milk and not tasting quite right. This recipe is absolutely awesome and flavorful. I followed the recipe exactly the first time - minus the salt (I never add salt unless it is really needed and it rarely is). I hadn't made the roux before, but it worked great. Over the next few times I added in carrots, used low sodium chicken broth, veggie broth, canned salmon, and added in more potatoes. I also tried it with and without hot sauce. I am a pepper gut so I like hot stuff - however - I have to say leave it out or just add dash to your own bowl, or perhaps try it with some Cajun smoked salmon. After making it a few times, I understand that essentially when you have the base made - roux, broth, potatoes and spices bubbling away, I am pretty sure you can add whatever fish or shellfish you want. Keep the spices, lemon juice and white wine, they make it superb. The half-and-half at the end makes it so smooth. I keep making bigger batches - last time it was enough to feed 20 people, but my family of four ate it all up within two days. (okay I admit it, I had extra bowl or two when no one was looking.)  I am going to make this chowder again and again, because it is the best in the the Pacific Northwest!

Ridiculous.  It is so delicious!!!!!!! I was looking for a recipe for some leftover smoked salmon, and this was it, and will  always and forever be, it.  This can make one small piece of fish and turn into a gourmet hearty meal for 8.  I can't stop eating it as it cooks for the final 1/2 hour. Wow. I did omit because I did not have: celery, white wine and tarragon.

I followed this recipe pretty much exactly except for a few changes:
1) I used half smoked salmon, half baked salmon, both wild caught Alaskan.
2) I added 1/4 teas cayenne and a couple pinches red pepper flakes. For people who enjoy spicy things, the amount of hot sauce called for is not nearly enough in my opinion. 
3) I added a tablespoon of flour about 15 minutes before it was finished. I like my chowders to be a little more on the thicker side.
The chowder came out sooo good! Can't wait to make it again.

You could get this in the finest restaurant. I was so surprised!  Made it almost exactly, but didn't have celery. No big deal. We, luckily, have a friend who gives us lots of smoked fish and I need to be creative with it. This is superb chowder.

This was lovely. I did not need to add any salt, as it was already quite salty from the smoked salmon. Also, I used milk rather than half and half. Not quite as rich, but still very delicious! I also used a gluten free flour blend, which worked out fine.

We loved this chowder!  I didn't use as much salt, since the smoked salmon and chicken broth have a lot of salt already.  I also used a couple of shakes of red pepper instead of hot sauce.

I found this recipe years ago and have made it many times.  It never fails.  Our family LOVES this warm and satisfying chowder!  Mimi, Thank you so much.  We always toast you with a glass of wine when we have this chowder.  If you love seafood and hearty smoky flavors this one should be an A+ every time.

Delicious!! My husband and I make this all the time after trying this recipe. We add lots of extra celery, and extra hot sauce for a spicier kick. Finish it off by grating fresh lemon zest on top when serving. Absolutely amazing in a sourdough bread bowl! Very easy and fun to make. Thanks for sharing!

This was wonderful chowder!  If you enjoy smoked salmon, I encourage you to try it.

My whole family loves this recipe. They thought there was cheese in this because its so creamy and smooth. I was leery of trying another way of using salmon apart from good ol' salmon patties, but this is so good. I'm glad I tried this. Its now a part of our winter recipes. I use canned salmon instead of smoked.

This is delicious. I added corn for texture since I didn't have celery, but the corn is a little sweet in my opinion. I also didn't have any half and half or evaporated milk, so I used plain soy milk, which I did have. Didn't affect the quality or flavor at all.

just made this last night, having never made a chowder or even a roux before and it was fantastic and so simple! it's a little easy to over-do the herbs (i couldn't find my teaspoon) so measure those carefully. i also used a mix of red and gold potatoes instead of russets which i think made a nicer texture and flavor than russets might have. i had so much fun making and eating this, i'm definitely making it again!

A very flavorful, fragrant recipe for smoked salmon! The spices complemented each other nicely and went well with the salmon, though I'm sure variations in the salmon could influence how the recipe turns out. I did expect it to be more chowder-y (thicker or creamier), but it worked well in a bread bowl.

In my opinion the herbs took over the flavor of the salmon.  And that was AFTER I cut the tarragon and thyme to 1/2 teaspoon each.  I will probably give it another try and use even less herb.  I just want to taste the salmon more.   The consistency was good and I liked that it didn't have a lot of cream in it.  The half and half was just right.

This was so yummy...BUT i didn't have smoked salmon I had fresh Salmon so I cubed it up, and I added bacon in the beginning when sauteing up the onions and celerey. Also I didn't have Tarrogon and I didn't have hot sauce so I put a dash of cayenne pepper instead and didn't substitute anything for the tarragon...This is SOOOO good!!:))

This was a good dish. I wish I would of bought fresh salmon and cooked it my self instead of buying the packages smoked salmon, the taste was not as good and the salmon was a little chewy. I did add more potatoes and some corn to the recipe this added some more texture that I thought was really good. Chowder was even better the next day as leftovers after the flavors had time to settle. I will definately make again but maybe next time I will substitue chicken instead of salmon.

Really good. I used regular salmon and altered the dill, tarragon, thyme, and paprika a little.

Very yummy. The only change I made was to add 2 leeks just after I put in my potatoes. It was excellent! I served it with some sourdough bread and my husband said it was great. It also made great leftovers for us. I will be making this again.

My family loved this recipe. I used a can of salmon, drained, instead of smoked salmon as that was what was on hand in the kitchen. I seasoned it with some smoked salt from a gourmet shop. I used an immersion blender in the pot on the stove instead of a blender. A pinch of cayenne pepper enhanced the flavors without adding heat. A keeper! Thanks!

Followed the recipe to a T, except I added a 14oz can of creamed corn.  It got rave reviews.  07FEB09:  Just made this again, first time for the wife and again this evening for the guys at work.  Once again rave reviews.  This time I added 1/2 # of small raw shelled shrimp.  Mmmmm.  Thanks again!

I made this recipe for the first time and it was amazing.  My stepsons said it was restaurant quality if not better.
I followed the recipe to the T except I didn't have smoked salmon.  Had to use up a salmon fillet out of freezer so I sauted it up in some onion and garlic then added it into the soup.  would like to try smoked salmon next time.
Thanx for the great recipe.

This is a great recipe! I am not particularly a fish person, but started eating salmon recently for the health benefits and this recipe is simply the greatest.  Easy to make and delicious!!!

Thanks for sharing this!  Joyce

This was really good.  I used the smoked salmon that comes in pouches, which tasted just fine.  Even my picky fiance really liked it.  Added extra potatoes and some Old Bay seasoning.
