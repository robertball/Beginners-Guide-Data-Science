I wish I had mentioned when I first submitted this recipe that I use a Cajun Spice Blend that I buy through Atlantic Spice Company.  It's SO much more flavorful than anything you can buy at the grocery store!  I buy it by the pound for around $5.  I ran out of it once and tried using the store-bought kind, but ended up using the entire bottle and it STILL wasn't that flavorful! It makes a huge difference in this recipe!

This is one of the simplest and best tasting chicken marinades ever!  I used Simple Cajun seasoning from this site, olive oil vs. vegetable (less oil than called for) pounded three chicken breasts down thin and let this marinate all day.  The result was tender, moist chicken that was bursting with flavor.

Wow!  The chicken stayed so juicy, and the flavors really permeated.  I halved the marinade ingredients (used 1lb of bs breasts) marinated overnight, and used the George Foreman grill (4 minutes worked out perfectly).

Since I love Cajun seasoning and use it often for blackened fish, I thought I'd really like this marinade, especially combined with the white wine, but I found this disappointing. Not only did the chicken turn out short on flavor, but I found the combination of the white wine and Cajun seasoning unpleasant.

This was awesome!  I added a little garlic salt and a couple shakes of red pepper (my Cajun seasoning is a bit bland.) I only marinated it for about 30 minutes and just poked the chicken with a fork several times.  It came out juicy and very tasty.  Good enough for company!

Good recipe.  Chicken was tender and presented well.  2 year old liked it, 7 year old hated it (too spicy).  Husband LOVED it, and we're looking forward to the leftovers.  Served with JP's biscuits (on website) -- replaced salt in biscuit recipe with the cajun seasoning, too.  Thanks for a great meal!

THIS ROCKS!!!  I did change this a little.  I used greek seasoning (it was what was in the house) and refrigerted overnight.  Everyone loved it.  My nine year old thought it was GREAT. We are using the leftovers for sandwhiches.  Would be great for topping on a salad.  Thanks for the recipe

This marinade was truly fast and very tasty. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and I used 4 tablespoons of Tony Chachere's original cajun seasoning. This is a great recipe! Thanks!

I don't think I have ever had a three ingredient marinade taste better.  I will make this again for sure.  Next time I will make my own spice mix though.  I bought some of the Emeril brand for this and was so disappointed.

I really like the simplicity of this recipe.  I added some sliced garlic cloves and some hot pepper sauce, to our taste.  Put all in a Ziploc bag, marinated for 4 hours.  My husband could not believe how moist the breasts were.  (I usually buy boneless thighs, for the grill, have always had bad drying issues with breasts.) This is definitely a keeper and thank you!  Leftovers are going in his lunch tomorrow, with a smile.

This was suprisingly good!  I'm so tired of boring chicken breast, but this really added a lot of flavor.  I am going to order some of the cajun seasoning the original poster suggested as mine wasn't as spicy as I would like.

My guys loved this one.  We are from Louisiana and so we feel qualified to "rate" cajun food.  Only thing I did differently was to add a tablespoon of Crab Boil to the marinade.  I don't know what this added to the original recipe but we liked it.  Such juicy and flavorful chicken.  We will do this one again!

I have used it on both chicken and beef ribs.  I marinated both overnight.  The longer it marinates the spicier the meat is.  We like this marinade alot, even my very picky 8 year old.  I cooked these on my Foreman grill.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  I will use this marinade often in the future.  I can't wait to try it on pork!!

Be careful not to overcook the chicken... there's not much you can do with chicken that's too dry.

This is the first dish i cooked for my girlfriend and we both absolutely loved it. I served it on top of rice with steamed veggiest, and i think next time i'll serve some mashed potatoes with it, but i'd have to say this recipe is absolutely wonderful.

Truly excellent recipe.  I marinated this in the fridge for about 8 hours before I cooked it.  I also added some red pepper to the mix, because we're from Louisiana and love spicy food.  Still didn't turn out too spicy, so I think next time I'll add more (just a matter of personal taste).  I really wanted to grill it, but unfortunately it was rainy so instead I pan-fried it.  The chicken was delicious!  I really cannot believe it was so completely simple to make!  I highly recommend you use drinking wine rather than cooking wine, because otherwise it may turn out too salty (prob depending on what kind of Cajun spices you use, but still, cooking wine has a lot of salt in it already).  Can't wait until the next time I make this--and grill it!

Tasty and very simple! I cut the chicken into strips and made kabobs, so that more of the chicken was coated in the marinade. I also added a dash of cayenne pepper for a little spice. Will definitely make again!

This is an excellent marinade that has been used countless times for our family gatherings.  I am an avid cook along with Janie and her daughter in law so you might think I am a little biased but I would have given it 5 stars regardless.

I loved this chicken.  Such a simple recipe.  A great flavor but not overpowering plus my grilled chicken just never comes out right, this was perfect and juicy.

This was delicious! I added some red pepper flakes and garlic powder and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I also broiled them rather than grill them (7 min each side) and they came out PERFECT. So easy and great flavor. Definitely will make this again.

Very tender and juicy. Would have gotten a 5 star but it didn't have a ton of flavor on it like I thought it would with marinating with the seasoning.

this is an excellent, quick marinade.  I grilled the chicken on the George (Foreman grill) and they were loved by all!

Good recipe, if a bit vague in its definition of cajun, but it leaves a lot of room for flexibility. I also used olive oil instead of veg oil, and since I didn't have a specific cajun seasoning I mixed cayenne pepper, paprika, creole seasoning, chicken grill seasoning and garlic salt. I only wish I had pounded the chicken breasts down a bit like someone else recommended so they would have grilled a little easier/quicker.

This was great. Very juicy and tender. I marinated overnight and also added a little crab boil. Mine was a tad salty, but may have been the crab boil. Thinking about adding a sliced jalapeno I grew and add to marinade next time to add a little more heat..we like spicy food.

Simple and very tasty! Ours was a bit salty but I think that is our cajun seasoning - will try a different kind next time. This will definitely be repeated in our home again. Thanks Janie!

Quick and easy and tastes pretty darn good!  I like that the Cajun seasoning I bought isn't too spicy so everyone in my family is happy.  I just love recipes like this that I can make with ingredients I usually have on hand.  Thanks!

Really not very flavorful.  I let it marinate for 6 hours and expected something much better.  I won't be making this again.

Wow, what a easy marinade!  My husband loved it, but he said to "Kick it up a notch" next time!  I loved it just the way it was, not too spicy.  I did use Olive Oil in place of the vegetable oil and used my foreman grill to cook them.  This recipe will be a keeper in my family.  Thanks
