Yum! Perfect for toast.  Make sure to chop the sun dried tomatoes finely. I had butter with sun dried tomatoes the first time instead of sdtomato butter.  I also put basil in instead of parsley.  Heavenly.

I buy a great garlic powder, in bulk, that is very fine and fresh at a favorite spot in Seattle, so I used that rather than fresh garlic to quickly distribute that flavor throughout the butter.  This was delicious on warm rolls tonight.  Thank you, Nina!

This is fabulous over fish or I use this as the flavor base for my beer butt chicken recipe.  I used a mix of parsley and basil.  Thanks for posting.

I was looking for something to top off my grilled chicken and came upon this. I did add some gorgonzola cheese and more garlic. One word, Awesome! I'm going to try it on some grilled thick cut pork chops. Thanks so much for the recipe!

I made this butter and spread it on Italian bread and broiled it for 5 minutes.  It was served with rigatoni and marinara sauce with meatballs and and true Italian salad and it was a big hit with my children and grand children.  

Chop the tomatoes very fine.

Made this for the office Christmas party to spread on Italian Herb Bread.  Everyone loved it, and some people even mixed it in with their mashed potatoes. I also used basil rather than parsley.  Will definetly make again!

yum! Be sure to chop the sun dried tomatoes very finely - more like a mince. I used margerine and added an equal amount of fresh basil. It could use more garlic for my tastes too though.  We used it on steaks - just spread it on and let it melt into hot steaks. Very gourmet tasting, but oh so easy. It'd be delicious as a garlic bread alternative too!  or even topping a baked potato!

Really good!  Made cooking steaks indoors worth it.  Even used the left over butter the next day to make garlic bread.

This is a good recipe, actually I would give 4,5 stars, because it was delicious, but I can`t say we were so much impressed.  I used more garlic, tomatoes and parsley than the recipe calls for. I used it on bread.

Excellent! I may have used more than an ounce of tomatoes because I had no way of weighing them, but otherwise followed the recipe. We had this on rib-eye steaks the first night and made tomato-garlic bread with it the second night. Awesome, thanks!

Everyone loves this butter! The kids like it on toast. Doesn't get any easier then that.

This is delicious.  It made way too much for the 4 steaks I made. But the left over 
butter didnt go to waste! I used it on garlic bread, over pasta and in mashed potatoes with a bit of cream cheese.
