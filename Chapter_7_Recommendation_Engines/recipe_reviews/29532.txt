fiddlehead fern is the curled section (new) spring shoot of the fern..look it up in a plant book to be sure you have the correct fern (found all over US) they are the tender new growth that sprouts out of the center of the fern plant-- they melt in your mouth. any substitute would not do justice (possibly dandelion greens could be used)

This was a very simple recipe and very good.  Author omitted the oven temperature.  I used a 350 degree oven.
