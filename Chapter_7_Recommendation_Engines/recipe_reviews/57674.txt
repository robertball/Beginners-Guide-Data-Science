Nice way to put eggplant on the menu.  Really sweet and tangy.  Be sure you really cook the eggplant and other vegetables until very soft.  Served with turkey cutlets and garlic bread for a very easy and healthy meal.  Husband ate double serving.  Added mushrooms the next time and less water to compensate, that was a good variation, so was zucchini...

Great way to use eggplant. Since Emeril's Eggplant & Gaahlic pasta sauce came out, I've been wondering how to make it myself. I made a few alterations tho': I prepped the eggplant by "sweating" it out with sea salt(see Eggplant Parmesan II review for instructions). When I added the canned tomatoes, I also added 1/2 cp of red wine, as well as oregano, fresh basil and fresh parsley(add these 3 to taste). I then allowed it all to simmer for an extra 20 minutes. May add carrots next time, I often use them in my regular pasta sauce--helps with the sweetness factor & you won't need to add sugar.

Good way to sneak veggies into toddler's spaghetti. I processed the veggies before adding them to the tomato sauce/paste. Also added Kosher salt and Italian seasoning. Still can definitely taste the eggplant, but it's disguised enough that she ate it.

Wonderful, Wonderful, Wonderful,  Everyone loves this sauce when I serve it.  I only use Asain type eggplants from my garden in the sauce everyone agrees the taste is better than the usual Black Beauty eggplant normally found in the stores.  I also use canned tomatoes because my eggplants are ready now and the tomatoes aren't ripe yet.  It does freeze very well and is delish in the middle of winter.

I can't believe there are no reviews on this fantastic dish! I have been making this for over a year now-started last summer when we had home grown eggplants that I had no idea what to do with. This is a keeper-needs no alterations to the recipe. Thanks for sharing!!

I loved this recipe!  I added about a TBSP of italian seasoning, and went a little lighter on the sugar.  I definately plan on making this again.

I'm glad others really liked this recipe, but I'm not feelin' it. It was okay, but I probably won't make it again. Flavor was so-so...only so much you can do with eggplant I guess. If you like eggplant a lot, try it...you might like it better than I did.

A little on the sweet side and I doctored it with a lot more garlic and a lot less olive oil.  I'm sure the oil quantity is a mistake.  We're more of a savory than a sweet family, so I left the sugar out.

I use S&W Italian Flavor canned tomatoes, leave out the sugar, and only use 1/2 cup of water to make it thicker.  I use it over everything from noodles and brown rice, to chicken.

I think this recipe is tasty, easy & feeds many - heartily! I did leave out the sugar and water.  I added more spices instead. Like salt, pepper, oregano... I did add a baby bella mushroom I had left over, and could've added more - but will next time.  Delicious, fast, healthy & easy! Can't wait to make it again.

Delicious and satisfying!  I had a basket of peppers, eggplant, and tomatoes that was given to me as a gift. I have small varieties of eggplant so I used 3-4.  I also had small yellow and red sweet pepper and used 4. The only other changes I mad was adding about a tsp of Italian seasoning, substituting tomato sauce for paste and adding 1 fresh tomato.  I will be making this again!

This is quite good. I suggest adding the water only as needed. I also suggest cooking the noodles while the tomato sauce is simmering so they are fresh and hot when serving. Thank you for the recipe.

I use this recipe as my "base" to home-made spaghetti sauce. I use fresh tomatoes from my garden instead of canned diced tomatoes and the tomato paste. It does have to simmer/cook down longer this way but I think the longer you let it simmer the better it tastes. I also add my own dried seasonings...a dash of bay leaves, 2 teaspoons or so each of Basil and Oregano and then 1 tsp each of Rosemary, Thyme and Marjoram (more or less to taste). My guy is a meat eater so I brown a pound of ground turky and add it to the sauce and let it simmer for another 20 minutes or so...until thickened to correct consistency.

I used my immersion blender to break up the veggies so the kids would eat it.

Love this recipe as is!  It's a great way to use up ingredients from the garden (I've even been know to throw in a zucchini).  Definitely recommend using fresh tomatoes.

Did not love this. I had to add a lot more spices to improve the favor to my taste.
