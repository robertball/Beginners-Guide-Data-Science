Great recipe!  My go to..why people have to be so rude is beyond me..IT IS Chili..Chili is made differently all over the country, and liked many different ways..if you don't like "Wendy" style Chili,  why on Earth make the recipe and then leave a bad review?

Excellent recipe!  Going to make it again and again.  Chili is very diverse and everyone has there taste preference when it comes to chili.  If you do not like the flavor of Wendys chili do not make this recipe thinking it's going to be different.  And please do not offer your comments and rating.  I rated this recipe based on the fact that I love Wendys chili and how close does this chili come to that flavor.  Very close and the flavor perfect.... Is it Wendys? NO, you only get Wendys chili at Wendys!  Is it a good rendition.. Oh yes..... And it's even better on day 2!!!!  If you choose to review a recipe make sure you made the recipe as posted.  Do not review a recipe if you changed it all up and then don't like.  A less than 4 or 5 star review of a changed up recipe is a review of ones own poor cooking skills.  Be real!!!

My entire family LOVED this chili and they never agree on anything.  

I didn't have the packets of chili seasoning so I used 1 rounded Tbs Cumin, 1 1/4 tsp salt, 1 1/4 Tbs Chili Powder, 1 tsp Oregano, 1 tsp basil.  

This will be my go to chili.

My 9yo, 7yo, and 5yo made supper for their grandparents last night.  They decided to cook chili but it couldn't be too spicy for their grandparents.  We selected this recipe and they cooked it with minimal support from me.  Everyone enjoyed the chili and it did remind me of Wendy's chili (It would have been an almost perfect match if the kids had cut up the stewed tomatoes but they missed that step.)  When we cuddled in bed last night, my 7yo son asked that I write a good review for this recipe.  We will make it again.

Great, as written but easily tweaked to your preferences. To the person who said it isn't chili, look beyond that and rate it for great flavor. Over 90 percent of the reviews are excellent, maybe the southwest should lay off the hot sauce and try tasting food again.

I can't tell you how many chili recipes I've tried in the past.  This is hands-down my favorite and will definitely be part of the "regular" meal planning rotation.  Perfect for my busy-wife-and-mommy life!  Great for the slow cooker - I browned the ground beef for about 8 or so minutes on the stove and dumped everything into the pot w/out sautéing anything else - super easy!  Freezes perfectly, tastes even better the next day, feeds a crowd for company and potlucks.  The only thing I'd suggest is to rinse your beans.  The frothy stuff you see when rinsing is what causes the "musical" part to your postprandial experience so rinsing definitely cuts that down if it's ever been a concern for you.  My husband likes his spicy so he will be adding more chili powder and cumin to his helping; if you like spicier chili you will need to do the same as the way it is written here gives you a mild, ever-so-slight kick.  Or, when you purchase the chili seasonings packets, pick "medium" or "hot" (I chose the 30% less sodium, mild spice option).  Love that it's also way more economical than running to the local food chain when I have a hankerin' for some of that famous chili =)

Made this recipe tonight. Customized it a bit by seasoning the ground meat before cooking, used Mexican Style stewed tomatoes, HOT McCormick Chili Seasoning, and RO*TEL with habanero for extra spice. Was delicious and will definitely make this recipe again.

Super good chili!!  My 7 year old didn't believe I made it...he thought it was Wendy's chili!  I did not have chili seasoning packets, so I used the approximate following measurements of spices: 2 tsp cumin, 1 tsp salt, 2 1/2 TBS chili powder, 1 tsp oregano, 1 tsp basil, 1/4 tsp black pepper, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper.  I also substituted 1 of the cans of stewed tomatoes for petite diced tomatoes and I blended the 2 cans of stewed tomatoes I did use in a blender first....scared my kids wouldn't like it if it was too chunky.  LOVE THIS RECIPE - THANKS FOR SHARING!!!

I love Wendy's Chili so I was anxious to try to this recipe!  For years I have made the Chili Con Carne recipe in the Better Homes & Gardens Cookbook.  While that chili is good, it is not Wendy's Chili :(  

I halved this recipe, however as another reviewer said, that leaves you with half used cans.  I solved that problem by rounding the ingredients.  I eliminated the oil,  I used 1 pound of 93/7 ground beef.  It produced very little fat so no need to drain it.  I used 1) 14 oz can stewed tomatoes, 1) 10 oz can RoTel diced tomatoes with green chiles, 1) 8 oz can tomato sauce, 1/2 cup water, and 1) 1.25 package of McCormick's.  I used the entire 14 oz cans of kidney and pinto beans, 1 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp pepper and 1 1/2 tsp white vinegar.  

This smelled and tasted like Wendy"s!  It had more of a bite to it.  I think that was due to the stewed tomato / RoTel ratio.  I think the secret to this recipe is the McCormick's.  It takes the guess work out of the spice measurements.  This is my new chili recipe!  I loved it!

Made as directed,EXCEPT I put it all in  a crockpot, after browning meat and sauteing veggies & I did rinse the beans hoping to cut back on any digestive issues. Since I was using my processor to chop the veggies, I then used it to chop the canned tomatoes--just easier.  This did taste excellent and I will put in on my favs' list. Thank you for the recipe & all the good reviews convincing me to give it a try : )

This was perfect! It tasted just like Wendy's chilli or even better. The other copycat recipes I've tried don't even come close to this. Very flavorful. I cut the recipe in half but still used the full amount of kidney beans, pinto beans and vinegar...besides that, I followed the recipe exactly. Also, I think the vinegar was a nice touch; it really gave it a nice but subtle kick. I'm not a regular cooker, so I wasn't sure if I should simmer with the lid on or off, so I simmered it for 30 minutes with the lid off and then put the lid on for the last 30 minutes. The consistency turned out perfect.

I've been making chili since I was a teen, but my 88 yo Father is in love with Wendy's chili, so I was intrigued by this recipe.  I made it exactly as written and it is delicious!  He says it tastes just like Wendy's, the rest of my family thinks it tastes great, my new go-to chili recipe!  Thanks for putting the time and effort into figuring this recipe out.

I made exactly as written, except drained the grease before adding vegetables. This chili definitely has GREAT flavor!! (not sure what makes the big difference, is it the vinegar?)  My husband and I are on WW so to lighten it up next time, I will omit olive oil (didnt think it was necessary) and use diced tomatoes instead of stewed (I was surprised to find out that stewed have several points!).  With these omissions and 93% lean ground beef, I calculated this to be 8 points/serving.

This recipe is fabulous!!! I have been searching for a chilli recipe for the longest time and finally I've found it! I did not alter the recipe. Followed the recipe exactly as is and my husband and three kids couldn't get over how delicious the chilli tasted. Thank you for an amazing recipe!

This is spot on!  For me the key is to let the ground beef sit in the pan, undisturbed, for those first 8 to 10 minutes.  This gives it a nice char, like you would get from a burger at Wendy's.  To enjoy the consistency of the original I cooked this for only three hours and ate it the day it was made.  Cooking too long or leaving it in the refrigerator over night tends to let the starches out and it becomes very thick.  I would not change any of the ingredients or any amounts - this is going into my chili rotation!

Delicious! Only change was to use 1/2 cup of water instead of a full cup b/c I wanted it to be thicker. Great flavor and super easy to make...A definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Great recipe, as it leaves room for exchanges of ingredients. I am in Lima, Peru and some ingredients cannot be easily found here. We have all kinds of natural, fresh ingredients... but not the canned combinations that you find in the US. So here is what I did, and I hope it helps the folks that live outside the US: I replaced the canned tomatoes (all of them) for three containers (doypacks) of Arrabiatta Tomato Sauce, which is just a spicier and mildly hot tomato sauce I found in the foodstore. I replaced the Chili seasoning for freshly ground black pepper, oregano, cumin and paprika. I added one cube of beef short rib bouillon. The rest I did the same. I ommited the vinegar because we just don't like it tart. Delicious and just like Wendy's chili. My 19 year old son, big fan of Wendy's chili, gave it 2 thumbs up.

7.22.17  Whoa, this is some awesome chili, and yes, it does taste like Wendy’s® chili.  Instead of using the expensive pkgs of chili seasoning, I used Chili Seasoning Mix II (from this site) which needed just a little tweaking to suit our taste, but not much.  I weighed the chili mix, and it made the right amount for this recipe.  I’ve never used a recipe for making chili (and I’m constantly adjusting the spices to get it just right), but we enjoyed this so much that this just might become our go-to chili recipe.  You’ll need to adjust the seasonings to your taste (just as you always do), but the only adjustment we made was adding some red pepper flakes.***UPDATE 1.19.19***  You need a BIG pot for this. I use my 5-1/2 qt LeCreuset pot for this because the standard size dutch oven just isn’t large enough.  Also, I make this chili so often that to save time, I keep a jar of the chili seasoning (I use Chili Seasoning Mix II recipe from this site) in a jar in the pantry, and the 2.5 oz you need for this recipe measures out to about 1/2 cup of the mix.  And don’t skip that first step when making this because cooking that big ground beef patty and then breaking it up makes it chunky, and that’s the way Wendy’s chili is.

Yippy...first time ever my husband said he liked my chili.  Last time we went to Wendy's and he was raving..I thought I need to find a clone.  15 years of marriage and this is the first approval for chili.  Thanks!

Amazingly good. Will definitely have this again and again! I did not vary from the recipe a jot and it turned out blissfully good.

First time ever using an on line recipe and I followed it exactly. It came out perfect. I will be making this one again. Finally after all these years of making my own, trying this and trying that, I have something that I can look forward to enjoying it every time I make it.

This was my first time making this chili and I followed the recipe with the exception that I did not use the celery (I don't like celery in chili).  It was quick, easy and delicious.  I won't say it tasted like Wendy's.....but even better, it tasted like my mothers.  I will definitely be making this one a staple for home use.  By the way, if you change 3-5 ingredients in a recipe and don't like it.... please don't rate the recipe badly.  After all, it's your fault you didn't follow the recipe.

I made this Chili yesterday and it is sooooooooo good!  I followed the recipe exactly, but made it much spicier by adding Rotel Tomatoes with Habanero peppers, Hot McCormick Chili Seasoning, and Del Monte Stewed Tomatoes with Jalapeno and Cumin.  Loved it!  Will make again!

I have to say, Wendy's Chili is my all-time favorite and this chili recipe is so close to Wendy's that if I were blindfolded, I'm not sure I'd be able to tell which one is which, ha.
Even though I'm not a fan of peppers of ANY kind, I had my 16 year old son (will be going to culinary school!) slice and dice everything super small (I think he even got out the "slap" chop, ha) and none of the peppers bothered me one bit.  However, being that I love Wendy's Chili so much, I was confident that I would be able to handle the peppers in this recipe.
Thank you TJY99 for this amazing recipe!

First, I love wendy's chili, I made this for an upcoming xmas party.  There was waaay too much grease/oil in my chili when finished - it's just kind of a separated mess.  I am not sure of the reason for the olive oil to begin with, and then adding ground beef which has fat and there is no instruction to ever drain, so I didn't.  I used 80% lean beef.   I also didn't understand why we cook the beef in a large patty - I made two batches at once (two different pots) and one of them burnt on the bottom since i didn't check it till 8 min. passed, it was a mistake.  I feel like it does slightly taste like Wendy's, but not as much flavor.  I froze it and and then scraped all the fat from the top hoping it's salvagable for the day I serve it (I made ahead and froze for the party).  If it's somehow great the day we eat it I will update the review.  I made exactly as the recipe reads with no alterations.

This tasted great and was gone before the weekend was over. In my second batch I cut the meat to one pound and added an extra can of each bean and two cans of black beans just to add variety . Now its a household staple made at least once a month.

Be still my heart.  I have been making chili for 30 years, and have never been happy with any of the recipes I've found.  I felt sure that one day I would find the PERFECT recipe, and this is IT.  Only 2 minor tweaks.  I doubled the beans, and added 1/4 cup of brown sugar for a tiny bit of sweetness.  I love the idea of making a huge patty to brown the beef.  I feel sure that this contributed in a big way to the flavor. Boyfriend and I inhaled this over 2 nights with a side of cornbread. It's delicious same day which doesn't always happen with chili. Served with a dollop of low fat sour cream and a side salad. Wendy's chili is awesome... now I can make it at home. Thankyou from the bottom of my heart for this submission.

We loved it! Important to note: If you do not like Wendy's Chili you may not like it then. But this was really yummy to us. We love Wendy's chili so there was plenty of left overs ans it even tasted better the next day~
I prepared as written except for using one larger can of Dark red Kidney beans (because we love them). Everything else we followed to a T. 
So glad you posted this.... it is a real winner!!!

Love this ...  I am not a fan of stewed tomatoes , but they make a difference, so I just chop them up before adding. Now to find some of the Wendy's Hot Chili Oil (the stuff they have in packets)

I love Wendy's Chili over a baked potato with sour cream.  

I was surprised at how easy it was to make and it tasted great.

Thanks

It's a mild chili for everyone to enjoy, but most importantly, it really does taste (and smell) just like Wendy's® chili! Yum, absolutely delicious and surely will be my go-to chili recipe. If you like it hot, simply adjust the spice level to your liking. BUT, if you truly love Wendy's, follow the recipe as provided. The entire family loved it. After browning the meat with the celery, onion and pepper for 5 minutes, I finished it off in the crock pot on high for 4 hours and tortured everyone with that heavenly aroma. Thanks tjy99!!! Update: I do drain and rinse the beans since my final cooking is done in the crock pot.

I've been trying different chili recipes searching for that one that will be our go to favorite.  For us, the search is over.  This recipe was perfect for our tastes.  The only minor adjustment I had to make for personal preferences was to cut the onion and green bell pepper to 1/2 each.   Unlike other recipes, the outcome wasn't a decision to use it for a base recipe next time but try to make it better by substituting all sorts of ingredients.  We loved it as is.

pretty good chili! We definitely like it spicier. but we added sliced jalapenos to our bowls- I also added a 1/4 C. of cocoa for added depth. Great topped with cheese, onions and sour cream. I also ladled off most of the oil layer on top the 2nd day. I would make again! Co-workers also said it was good.

This is my third try of any chili recipe and my husband loved it!  He ate three bowls worth!  One of my kids liked it very much, too.  The other - not a chili fan in general.  Did it taste like Wendy's?  My husband - who loves their chili- said it was a definite yes!  A keeper recipe!  Thanks SO much!

Great chili! My family loved it! 
Even though by boys are older, they still act like little children when it comes to onions and chunky tomatoes :) so I put them in the blender and nobody was the wiser. I will be making this again very soon!

My family loves my chili!!!  That being said I needed to prepare it for 50 people at our small business.  I initially wanted to buy it from Wendy's but my son really wanted my recipe.  I found this recipe and was very nervous about preparing it.  I have to say it was the best ever and so delicious.  It encompassed my take on chili but was so helpful in tripling the chili ingredients, shopping list and cooking instructions!  The one thing I left out was the vinegar as I was not sure what they would add to the taste.  Anyway, this is a winner for my family and friends!!!

I love trying out new chili recipes, especially when the temps start dropping!  I followed this recipe, pretty much exactly how it's shown with a few exceptions.  I browned one pound of ground beef along with one pound of mild italian sausage, onion and green peppers.   I didn't add celery (because I didn't have any) and popped the browned meat, along with all the rest of the ingredients into the crock pot and cooked it on low for about 4 hours.  Whipped up some amazing cornbread to go with it....BOOM!   Loved it!

I LOVE this chili!  It is my go to recipe.   This recipe makes a lot so I freeze the leftovers. When we are ready to heat the left overs we just warm it up in a Dutch oven. I have also made this recipe with deer meat and it comes out just as good if not better.

I thought this was good, made it as recipe states, but used ground turkey and no salt added tomatoes and McCormick low sodium chili seasoning to suit my preferences.  I wasn't sure about the celery, but it blended in nicely.  I served it topped with low fat Mexican cheese blend and Fritos (a guilty pleasure). I'll make again, thanks for the recipe!

Only change I made was omit the celery as my husband can't eat it. It turned out great better than Wendy's. Most definitely will be making again probably next week.

Hey folks this is very close to Wendy’s  chili. I’ve been using this recipe for years . Here is a tip  don’t forget the vinegar at the end. And I use beef stock instead of water. People are funny they get a recipe. They add or substitute ingredient s then say the recipe isn’t that good. Or people are rude. I say to these people , we’re not saving lives here . We’re just trying to make a bowl of chili

Very good recipe! Used another reviewers advice and made own chili seasoning: 1 rounded T cumin, 1 1/4 tsp salt, 1 1/4T chili powder, 1 tsp oregano and 1 tsp basil. Added large bottle V8 and 2 tsp grape jelly for "sweet tangy taste"

10/17: Made dried kidney and black beans in instant pot and added all liquid from that to chili also. Used one larger sized can whole tomatoes and Rotel (mixed in Vitamix) and one can diced tomatoes.  Also added two diced sweet potatoes. This was really flavorful!

After chili night, it's great to make a salad with! Just do a lettuce mixture, the chili, cheese, and some of those mini tortilla chips. I also add a chipotle ranch (makes it creamier) and sometimes sour cream. And then after that if there is still a little left, I make chili and cheese baked potatoes. So it's a pretty simple recipe that you can make and then  turn into other dishes (so you're not eating the same thing every night).

This recipe is spot on, but I did adjust slightly just for convenience to what I had on hand and to double it to take to a church function.  I used 4.5 lbs.  ground chuck- drained, 3-10 oz. pkgs.  Frozen Picsweet Seasoning Blend (diced onions, celery, bell peppers and parsley). Instead of 4 pkgs. of Chili seasoning I used: 5 Tbsps. Chili Powder, 3 Tbsps. Cumin, 1Tbsp Dried Oregano, 2 tsp Garlic Powder,  1 Tbsp. Onion, 1 tsp. Cayenne, 2 Tbsps. Flour.  I omitted the EVOO, water, tomato juice & stewed tomatoes instead added 7 cans Diced tomatoes, 3 cans Rotel and 1-6 oz. can tomato paste.  I also added 2 tbsps, of beef base instead of salt and two additional cans of kidney beans to the 4 in recipe( 2 Light Kidneys, 2 dark Kidneys, and 2 pintos). I almost forgot the vinegar.  I tasted it without and it was lacking, then I realized it and added 2 Tbsps. ACV and wow!  That made it Wendy's style!  I plan to make this quantity for now on and freeze 16 oz. portions to have quick meals in the deep freezer for my busy family.  Thanks you!

Very good. Not sure if it's *just like* Wendy's, but it's still close. Hearty and filling on cold winter nights.

Amazing Chili!!! It lasts forever! Great for freezing. I did make a couple changes. I chopped the stewed tomatoes before throwing in pot. I also added 1 extra can of pinto beans because I love them. And finally added 2 tablespoons of vinegar. This is totally a keeper!

It has been awhile since I've had Wendy's chili, but we thought this was really good!  It was just the right amount of spicy.

I only made a 1/2 batch, and not wanting to waste 1/2 cans, I went with 1 can mexi stewed tomatoes, 1 can rotel, 1 small can tomato sauce.  I didn't have green bellpepper, but I had some red and yellow, so used that instead, and for the beans, just used 1 can pintos.  Given these changes, I'd say it's still pretty close to Wendy's, so the full batch with all the right stuff is probably even better.  Probably won't become my favorite chili, but when you're in the mood for Wendy's chili, this will take care of it!  Thanks for sharing!

Absolute best, actually taste better than Wendy's, I used the Rotel (Hot) can of diced tomatoes and the Hot Chili Seasoning Mix, I like some spice in my life, and it was actually not to spicy, it was just the right amount of heat.

Absolutely love this recipe and my family does too!!  This is a true recipe for how chili is supposed to taste.  I've read some reviews about it being too greasy.  My suggestion is that if you are using anything under 90/10 then you must drain the meat. (That goes for pretty much every recipe).

I made this chili exactly as written, and it was delicious!  I can't speak to whether or not it tastes like Wendy's chili (I haven't eaten it in many years), but I can say it was a hit with my family of five- even my chili-hating husband and one child who hates soups and stews ate it up and said it was great.  I will definitely be making this again!

Just a comment, I used to work at Wendy's way back in the 80's and  the meat they used then were the fresh left over hamburger patties. I noticed some comments on the Hamburger patty formation you suggest. It's right on . 
Just thought I would leave this note. I haven't made it yet but I plan too.

If you like Wendy's chili, this is excellent!  I made exactly as written except I forgot to get the chili seasoning at the store and had to substitute with the spices I had on hand.  I used the measurements another reviewer suggested:  1 rounded Tbsp cumin, 1 1/4 Tbsp chili powder, 1 1/4 tsp salt, 1 tsp oregano, and 1 tsp basil.  I also like to garnish with shredded sharp cheddar cheese and a dollop of sour cream.  Delicious!

Made this chili recipe tonight and it was really yummy!!  It tasted very similar to Wendy’s chili!  And, it was super easy to make.  The only thing I omitted was the green pepper.  I also put the stewed tomatoes in my food processor so there wouldn’t be such big chunks of tomatoes.  I will definitely be making this again!

I absolutely LOVED this chili recipe.  The only thing I would do differently next time, would be to use crushed tomatoes instead of the stewed tomatoes.  I have children that don't like big chunks of tomatoes.  THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!

AMAZING!!!! I followed this recipe using about 2.5 lbs of turkey; I didn't alter anything else. I had a bowl the next morning and for lunch. A few days later, I used the chili inside an egg omelette and a bowl for dinner. Seeing the last bowl get put into the microwave almost made me sad. This is my type of chili, full of flavor and basically like I remember from Wendy's. Don't forget the vinegar.  I LOVE THIS CHILI.

Loved this chili!  It was cold today so my husband wanted it...but I didn't have pinto beans or enough beef so had to add ground turkey and black beans.  It was still delicious .  I'll make it again and will have everything it calls for next time.  Will rinse the beans too.  Health wise, the turkey worked out good.

My husband and I loved this recipe, so did our guests. I served it with white rice, shredded sharp cheddar cheese and sour cream.  Cornbread rounded out the meal. Real comfort food. Leftovers were delicious, too.

I made and followed the recipe exactly as written.  My husband and I did not care for it.  We eat at Wendy's, this recipe does not come close to the Wendy's chili.  We were very disappointed.  McCormick's has a recipe called "Week night Chili" which we believe has a better flavor than this. but  that is just our opinion.

Made this for our “family” dinner night.  The kids and grandkids loved it.  Just like Wendy’s.  Added dried parsley flakes and green onions for that Cajun twist.  Definitely a crowd pleaser.

I made some changes like most folks did. It's a great recipe, but it's not quite like the fast food chain's. Everyone has there own chili liking's to add celery and green peppers isn't a basic chili recipe. Fastfeet needn't bash it as you did. Why follow the exact ingredients if you didn't want it?? It's kinda like driving slow in the passing lane. Why stay there when someone behind you wants to pass??

Me and the kids love Wendy's chili, and this is pretty darn close! I only made half a recipe, so I only used 1 can of kidney beans, and I just had to drain them (sorry - but that liquid just grosses me out)! Hubs would have liked a little more "kick" - but the kids and I thought it was great! Will make again!

I have never made Chili and I have a thing about canned beans, since I grew up in Mexico.  I boiled my own pinto and kidney beans so the texture was just the way I like them, that cuts down on the sodium.  For the Chili I used taco seasoning and added some chopped jalapenos.  My wife loved it.  My boy said it was the best.

I've made many varieties of chili but really love Wendy's chili the most, so I was glad to come across this recipe. I followed the recipe closely but used 2 lbs. beef chili meat 80% lean (found at HEB, in Houston) and substituted chili seasoning with mild taco seasoning packets instead. I added a bit of cumin and oregano but not enough to ruin the essence of Wendy's chili flavor I was after. It was DELISH! So easy to make as well, so I will definitely be adding this one to my recipe folder.

I made this recipe last winter and my family loved it. Yesterday we were in the grocery store and my husband reminded my of the recipe and asked if I could make it this week. Must have been good if he remembered it after so many months! Didn't change a thing. Great for the cool Fall days too!

Delicious! Every bit as good and even better than Wendy's, low sodium tomatoes, mix my own "seasonings", ground turkey, add can of drained black beans. Sauté celery/bell/onion separately in the olive oil. Thank you for a keeper!

This was by far the best chili I've ever made... I'm actually making it again tonight because we ate the entire pot! I didn't use the green peppers because I don't like them and I didn't use the vinegar. Other than that I did everything according to the directions and it was delish!

Truly Wendy's taste, but fresh and so much healthier. The recipe make lots of chili so I froze smaller batches in Tupperware containers. My daughter and I enjoyed about 6 meals with one batch. Good stuff!

This recipe is great. I am going to try it with only one packet of seasoning next time but only because my kiddos said it was a little too spicy for them. Thanks for a super yummy chili!

This really does taste just like Wendy's chili!  I loved it.  I only added one package of chili seasoning and it was still plenty spicy for my family. I will be saving this recipe to make again for sure.

The first try of this recipe I didn't rinse the beans and that was a mistake because I doubled the beans. It was also a bit chunkier than Wendy's and the bean juice taste wasn't right but close and definitely worth a second try. Made it yesterday and it's all gone:) I put the stewed tomatoes in the blender for 2-3 seconds for tomato bits rather than chunks and rinsed the beans. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is the BEST chili recipe I have ever tried. It does taste like Wendy's chili. It is now the one and only chili recipe that I use. The only change I made was to use tomato puree instead of stewed because I don't like stewed tomatoes. SJS9

I followed the recipe exactly. It does taste like Wendy's Chili. However it is also a bit sweet for my taste buds, as is Wendy's Chili. I am going to use either Mexican or plain canned tomatoes for part of the stewed tomatoes next time.

This is easy and very good. The seasoning isn't exactly like Wendy's using the McCormick (R) Mild Seasoning Mix but duplicating a seasoning would be nearly impossible so I can't fault tjy99 for that. It is a bit more spicy even using mild Rotel and mild seasoning mix so if you are cooking for little ones, you might want to add just one packet of the seasoning and taste for spiciness before adding more. Thank you, tjy99. You've saved me money because i do like Wendy's chili and now I have several containers in my freezer for the next craving.

Followed the recipe exactly. This is truly good chili. I'm a purist and like to make things from scratch, so I was worried about using packaged chili seasoning. But you know what? I could spend 15 mins pulling out all the dried seasonings for myself, measure them, and put them all away, or I can pay $2 for two packets of the same thing that someone else has put together for me (and that is perfectly measured every time). With the tasty results I got, I'm sold--this is the only chili recipe I'll use in the future. It's very fresh tasting, not too spicy, the tomato hunks add interest and texture, it makes a big bunch of chili--very little head room left in my Dutch oven for simmering, so keep that in mind--and my family loves it. The recipe does not say to drain the fat off the meat before you add the other ingredients, but you probably should. I figure this is an oversight on the part of the writer.

We loved it. Next time, for personal preference, I would decrease the sodium as much as possible. This'll probably be my go to chili recipe now.

I made this for supper tonight with some cornbread.  My husband absolutely LOVED it!  I did not change anything.  The recipe is perfect as is and makes enough to share.  It does taste just like Wendy's.  My husband shared some leftovers at work and they said it was better than Wendy's because I left bigger chunks of vegetables.   We will definitely make this again!

This was very good, very similar to Wendy's. I made it in a 6 qt slow cooker and it was too full, so keep that in mind if you decide to try it that way. 

I used dried pinto beans (never again!) that I'd soaked for over 24h beforehand and it took basically 2 days to cook them to the point that they were edible and a pleasing texture. Just use canned, as the recipe suggests. It's not worth the hassle.

Since I'm in Canada, we don't have Ro*Tel, or any product that I could find that was similar. So I just used a can of diced tomatoes and chopped up a japaleno with the seeds removed and it was perfectly fine.

I can't figure out how, but this really does taste like Wendy's chili. Must be the McCormick seasoning packets. I used the mild packets and omitted the celery. I'm really enjoying this hearty chili with saltines and cheddar cheese.

I made this tonight and me and my hubby (very picky) loved this. It really did taste like Wendy's, he said the only thing missing we're the saltine crackers:)  the only thing I did different was cut recipe in half and after browning meat and the veggies, I through it in the crock pot with the rest of ingredients (drained and rinsed beans) and set it on low till we had dinner about 2-3 hours.  Thank you for sharing your delicious recipe. Anyone wanting a very satisfying bowl of chili should try this one!  God bless

Loved this, even one our National Night out chili cook-off with it!  with one small change... I used 3/4 pd of Hot Pork Sausage in place of 1 lb of beef.  I have done this with my chili for so long, and just have to have it in there now.  Thanks for posting!

Exactly like Wendy's I made double the amount and filled 12 x 8oz Tupperware containers.  Froze half of them and left the other 6 in the frig for the kids and I.  Was GREAT!!!

I made a double batch.  We took half for a pre-game meal at our son's house.  The remainder was frozen in individual serving size bags.  We all liked this recipe a lot, and our son has repeatedly complimented me on it.  Of course, I told him where I got the recipe.  Maybe he'll make it for his girlfriend soon.

This makes a huge batch. I didn't have the chili seasoning, so used the Chili Seasoning Mix II on this website. Great for a potluck, large gathering or freeze for several additional meals.

Not exactly like Wendy's, but pretty close.  This recipe makes a huge batch - filled my 5.5-qt saucepan almost to the rim.  We generally like more beans so I'll add another can or two next time.

Midway through making this recipe right now and let me tell you...this stuff is absolutely delicious. It's been a while since I've had Wendy's chili, so I don't really remember what it tastes like, but this stuff is good all on it's own. Making for my husband and his shipmates...hope they like it, too!

I’ve been excited to make this chili like all week! Lol I’m only fifteen and this was quite easy for me to make and it tastes quite similar to Wendy’s chili. I did make a few adjustments and the cans that I found at my store tended to be a few ounces over the recipe but I figured that wouldn’t matter much lol. Quite good and I know my grandma would most likely love for me to make it again :)

Stewed tomatoes are big.  I found it difficult and time consuming to break them up in the pot.  When I make it in the future, I will use my electric chopper on the before adding.  I'll definitely be making again.  Thank you!!

Followed the recipe and did not change anything.  However, it did not turn out like Wendy's.  The chili seasoning I used was McCormick's mild TexMex and not sure if the TexMex made a difference, but much spicer than what we have gotten at Wendy's.  Ended up adding a pinch of sugar and some sour cream to cut the heat.  I'll make again, but next time, I'll use diced tomatoes instead of the Rotel.

Pretty darn good - gonna try a different seasoning packet next time though.  No biggie, everyone’s taste preference is different.

Ok so to be honest, I have a hard time following a recipe exactly when cooking. I used the recipe as guide and made it rather closely to the recipe but not exactly. I added really thin slices of carrots (largely because I think I remember them be in Wendy’s chili and also to get my son to eat more veggies) and they were great in there! Thanks for sharing the recipe

Wonderful recipe. It is in my weekly rotation and I always have some of it frozen in the freezer.

I'm single, so I cut everything in half and make 5 servings at a time. still turns out great.

I made this yesterday and I really read the ingredients incorrectly, but the ingredients I used helped make it pretty good.  Hubby liked it (I had to decrease the spicy stuff a little since he has a "delicate" pallet, but otherwise it turned out.  Mine was not like Wendy's and when I make it next time, I will read more carefully and prepare it the right way.  I can see where George's version would be very tasty.

Hands down, the best chili recipe on this site. I’ve tried two of the more popular ones and they don’t compare. I had two bowls and I can imagine how delicious it will be after sitting overnight. I didn’t add the vinegar because I forgot, but I don’t think it was needed.

It was delicious !! And so easy to make. The only thing different that  I did was I drained the grease from the ground meat ,eliminated the olive oil as the lean ground meat still produces enough grease and at the end i added  grated  italian parmesan cheese  per serving bowl and a dollop of sour cream.  Superb !!  My husband made  some crispy rolls to go with it

I used a bag of dried beans instead of canned. I wanted to use up a 24 oz package of turkey breast tenderloin. I diced the turkey and cooked it as well as a pound of ground beef.

This recipe  is pretty close but it needs cumin to achieve  the true Wendy's chili taste.  I added 2 teaspoons cumin which makes it  near perfect.

The best Wendy's chili recipe I've tried. I followed the recipe exactly with one minor change. In place of pinto beans I used pink beans as shown in the list of ingredients on the Wendy's web site. Fabulous results. This is as close to Wendy's chili as you can get.

Overall, excellent and definitely similar to Wendy's.  However, I would make a few changes.

1.  Historically at least, Wendy's cooked the beef twice.  First, as a hamburger, and then a second time by boiling.  In large part, this second step is probably designed primarily to pasteurize the meat. But it also removes the rest of the fat.

2.  The olive oil is completely unnecessary unless, maybe, you are using extremely lean beef.  Just reserve some of the beef drippings after frying and before boiling the meat.

3.  Use the reserved beef drippings, 1-2 T to saute the vegetables.

4.  Wendy's drains and rinses the beans.  I did the same.

Also, if it gets too thick, don't hesitate to add water.  The chili on the service line tends to thicken and this is addressed throughout the day by adding hot water periodically.

Awesome chili recipe, and it does taste just like Wendy's. However, I am somewhat surprised / shocked that the recipe doesn't call for draining the ground beef. Maybe it's just common sense, but that's a step you should definitely not leave out.

Love this recipe!  It does taste like Wendy's.  A few changes we enjoy are 1) substituting no salt added versions of the stewed tomatoes and the tomato sauce, because we added 1 tsp Better than Chicken bouillon. Also added (same time as the beans) 1.5 cups yellow corn niblets for added color, taste and texture; and topped each bowl with one crumbled tortilla chip and 1 tsp chopped fresh cilantro. YUM!

Tastes just like Wendy’s chili! I followed this recipe exactly except I drained the grease after reading a review but I saved it just in case. I ended Up pouring half of it back in to help sauté the veggies. This was super easy to make and so delicious. My family all loved it and this will be my go to chili recipe

This chili is delicious! I made the recipe in the slow cooker. I browned the meats on the stove first and then added to slow cooker and then layered the rest of the ingredients except for the vinegar, which I didn't add until right before serving. I didn't have the chili seasoning so I followed some others' advise and used the seasoning I had on hand: 1 Tbs. cumin, 1.25 tsp. salt,  1.25 Tbs. chili powder, 1 tsp. oregano, 1 tsp. basil, 1/2 tsp. sugar, 1.25 tsp.salt. Also to make it a little healthier,  I did a combination of beef and turkey: 1 lb. ground beef and 1.5 lbs. ground turkey.

Definitely adding this chilli to my monthly line up of recipes. Even the non-chilli eaters in my home loved this recipe. I added some simple cornbread, and like magic, everyone fell asleep. Great job

Thanks MC for sharing your recipe! Made it as designed and was really good. Will use it as addition to taco salad in next couple of days - just like Wendy did/does.

I followed the recipe exactly. It’s an okay chili, not great. I think it is too tomatoey. It also needs some garlic and more spices. I would not make this again.

I finally found a recipe for chili that I really  like.  I don't like thick chili, and this fit the bill.  My husband really liked it to and ate more then I have seen him eat of any other chili i have made.  This is a keeper and will now use this recipe instead of any of the others I have made.  It does taste a lot like Wendy's, but not exactly.  I used three cans of beans, and made it in the crockpot, and it turned out great.  I did NOT use the liquid from the beans and only used a half cup of water since I cooked it in the crockpot.

Excellent recipe, thanks for sharing. 
I'm a person who taste tests every step of the way, and here are my provisions, after I tasted the final product from the recipe. (10 serving)

I added:

- 2 tablespoons garlic powder
- 1 tablespoon onion powder 
- 1 tablespoon fresh, minced and pressed garlic (3 or 4 smaller cloves)
- 3 teaspoons oregano
- 1 tsp cayenne (quite the kick!)
- 1 tsp of regular chili powder 
- Omitted salt, replaced with 2 tablespoons of tomato bullion and more to taste. 

And this made a world of a difference:
- 3/4 cup of barley (also add this if it is ever too spicy) 
I also added the full can of kidney beans, and added extra tomato sauce. 

Topped with shredded cheese and chopped green peppers, turned out great. My 10 year old is begging for more.

I used ground turkey and Ranch Style Beans. Added some black beans as well. The taste is very, very close to Wendy's chili.

I had a go to chili recipe. It was great!  This one is better, in my opinion, but then I love Wendy’s chili. Because I was serving to a gang of people with differing preferences on heat, I used mild tomatoes with peppers and mild chili mix. Three different hot sauces went on the table to satisfy the heat mongers’ tastes. My favorite part?  Starting the ground beef out as a patty. I set the timer for 7 minutes and the meat had a nice seat on it, just like Wendy’s. I thought it was a creative way to meet that need. Great recipe.

This is dead ringer for Wendy's chili! The only thing I did differently was to use the suggested 2 cans of Bush's Southwest Style Pinto Beans (cause I like 'em).

Delicious. I will definitely make this recipe again. After cooking the celery, onion, and bell pepper with the ground beef, I transferred everything into my CrockPot before adding the remaining ingredients. I finished cooking the chili on low for about two hours and it was done perfectly without much attention. Perfect with crumbled cornbread.

I made this it was awesome,made a few changes. I used pinto,kidney, and a can of chilli beans, I drained some of the oil off of the ground beef. I should have used another can of beans, next time. I think it might be better with 4 cans. Thank you for this recipe it is great.

Very good and it is similar to Wendy’s chili, especially in the consistency. I like my chili a bit loose, not so thick a spoon stands up in it and this fit the bill. I added a couple of spoonfuls of brown sugar instead of vinegar at the end just because of personal preference. I cooked mine for 2.5 hours because it took that long for the stewed tomatoes to break down instead of remaining intact. Will make again.

This taste exactly like Wendy's chili!  My husband and I didn't waste a drop of it.  I added an extra tablespoon of vinegar to take the spice out.   I can't handle any kick to my chili and this solved the problem.  It was perfect!

Have tried other copycat recipes in my quest to duplicate Wendy’s chili and this is it.  I omitted olive oil, not necessary as Beef creates enough of its own.  I browned meat and drained off oil because if you have worked at Wendy’s you know they use the overcooked patties for their chili.  This is awesome will make again!

Excellent copycat recipe.  Not too spicy if mild prepared chili mix is used.  Can ratchet up the heat if needed, but the basic recipe is outstanding.  The pinto beans tend to disintegrate if cooked too long, so add them last.  Definitely double the beans as recommended.  If there seems to be too much grease from the meat - just take a metal spoon - put ice in the spoon, and put the bottom of the spoon in the grease.  Grease will adhere to the bottom of the spoon and it's easy to remove.  I've not had that problem...probably because I use a lower fat content meat.

Seemed like with all those stewed tomatoes it will need more than 2 packages of chili seasoning.  Seemed to not have much flavor and definitely did not have a chili smell.  Was OK with cheese and sour cream added but just missing that chili taste.

This is an excellent chili recipe. I’ve made it many times. The only changes I made to this recipe was to use 93% ground turkey, and I added 2 tsp of cumin. I don’t like a lot of beans in my chili so I only added the 1 can pinto beans and 1 can of cannelloni beans as I don’t like kidney beans. I follow Weight Watcher  freestyle plan and by just changing the calories and saturated fat it converted to 5 FS points. Great for lunch or those days you need a low point dinner. Serve along with a salad.

Delicious and so close to its namesake. 
It's easy to prepare, tastes great, and is a recipe we'll use again and again, especially when family and friends visit at the holidays. 
Great job, Montana Chef.

I made this according to the recipe except I used a packet of enchilada seasoning since I made it on the spur of the moment and didn't have chili seasoning. I halved the recipe and still had a lot. it is very much like Wendy's and my mother really liked it,too. she's a big fan of Wendy's chili so that's high praise. I'll be making it again

Utterly fantastic!  Tastes very much like Wendy’s.... delicious!  I have made other recipes for chili, but this is the very best!  Followed the recipe exactly; used the spicier of Rotel tomato’s and the spicier of McCormicks chili seasoning packets.  I serve it warmed, over a bed of lettuce, topped with fresh onions, shredded sharp cheddar cheese, and a dollop of sour cream.  My family and I love it!!!!  Would not change a thing!

I love this chili and it is by far the best recipe Ive encountered in my many years of experimenting. It’s forgiving so not a huge deal if you don’t have rotel, use normal diced. Or if you’re low on tomato sauce, no prob! It’s been a hit time and again and it makes me so happy. Top with sour cream and shredded cheese and green onions and you’ve got yourself a delicious meal!

Delicious and very tasty! I originally thought that it called for too much tomatoes, but I followed the recipe exactly as written and they were not overwhelming. You can tweak the spices to your taste...dash of chili powder, cumin, or hot sauce...it's very delicious and a keeper for me!

I follow the recipe to a "T" except I make it in my Instantpot and hit the "Chili" button.  It's soooo good, one of my kids commented  that it tastes  like Wendy's chili! I laughed and showed him the recipe. 
This one is  keeper.

I’ve made this many, many times.  It is my family’s favorite chili.  It has a good meat to bean ratio and we like the way it is spiced.  I do have chili powder and chipotle powder on the table as some family members like to add a bit more spice in their bowls.

Terrific Recipe.  I used "French's" chili season packs.  My 13 year old and I agree that it's our favorite.

I found this to have an OK taste - but quite different from the Wendy's chili, at least in the Chicago area. (Yes Wendy's does vary the seasonings regionally).    I liked my results following this recipe, but feel it is wrong to claim a Wendy's copycat that says to just grab a couple chili seasoning packets from any brand/any store.  Talk about possible variables.  

This is a good recipe though apparently some people miss the instruction on the beef :
"cook until 1 SIDE just browned- THEN BREAK IT UP". 
    And those who commented that since they weren't told to drain their 80% lean beef after browning, they were surprised by all the floating grease at the end.  80% lean = 20% fat = about 3 ounces pure grease per pound.  That's enough grease to use as the base for a full quart of gray....  Yes, I always drain ground beef or pork unless told to retain the fat (or if when the pan is tilted nothing drains to the edge - sometimes meats are less fatty than package indicates...).

this was a great recipe to get me started. My changed were to taste. I drained most of the grease. Used 1 cup when mixing in seasoning instead of water. Substituted chili beans instead of pinto and also added 3 Tbs chopped garlic with the other veggies. Was able to adjust spiciness with chosen tomato sauce and chili beans. (i chose medium hot, chili flavored) and  for the seasoning packet (i got Tex mex chili for a kick) turned out great! Pot was empty, bellies were full :)

I have only left a few reviews in my time but this one I just had to.  It’s the chili recipe I have been waiting for.   Just like Wendys.  Made exactly as written and I’m thrilled.   Will never need to try another recipe.

I made this exactly as written and it's absolutely awesome! I have always made real good chili but this is the best! My husband and grown daughter also loved it, my daughter actually took what was left home with her to her family. This is my new chili recipe. No need for any other.

Couldn't be more authentic if it was served by a red head.  The best chili I have ever made at home.  Like Wendy's, it has that tinge of sweetness and great beef flavor.

Excellent recipe.  Making enough for 50 at our local homeless shelter.  My husband would like a little more kick and beans so next time will maybe add jalapenos.

I love Wendy's chili so I tried this recipe and glad I did.  Tastes great.  I used 85% ground beef and the only substitute was using my favorite chili seasoning (Suckle Busters Texas Chili Seasoning) instead of a packet of chili seasoning which I've never had good luck with those.  One other thing I did was to drain and rinse both the kidney and pinto beans to lessen the sodium.  Will make again and again.....

I don’t even like chili, and I liked this.  It has a ton of flavor!  I did purée the stewed tomatoes. But following the recipe exactly makes a great, very flavorful dish!  No changes necessary!

This is a great recipe.  It is definitely like Wendy’s, which our whole family enjoys.  I did add an extra half teaspoon of ground cayenne.  Next time, I will likely use diced tomatoes rather than stewed one as no one in our family prefers the big chucks, nor do we like cutting up the stewed one.

Delish! Just like Wendy's, if not better.  Only changes I made were- added an extra can of kidney beans and used only 1lb of lean ground beef instead of 2lbs. I will make this recipe again!!

I didn't had green pepper, celery, chile seasoning nor either of the canned tomatoes. I used instead 1 tbsp of adobo, 1/2 tbsp of basil, 6 packets of Goya seasoning, 1 tbsp of homemade sofrito. 

It tastes amazing, definetly doing it again with celery! I didn't know the green stuff in it was celery, always thought it was green pepper but after seeing some pictures I've been corrected!

Great tasting chili!  I used low sodium kidney beans x 2 (didn’t have pinto beans) and low sodium McCormick’s mild chili seasoning (the only low sodium available). We added hot sauce to our individual bowls.  Also, I was out of distilled vinegar.  Definitely making this again!

I only used 1 pound of ground beef along with WHITE and RED Kidney beans. This recipe was delicious for my family.  Will definitely make it again! I served over rice, added green onions, cheddar cheese and sour cream on top and added cornbread too! SO GOOD.

There are as many chili recipes as there are opinions but if you like you like and if you dont you dont.  But, I tried this recipe and it works!  I won the chili cook off at church just like that and I had never participated in anything like that before....and I dont even cook.  The only thing I would suggest is from someone who use to work at Wendy's and told me.  The hamburger in their chili is leftover hamburgers.  So, I am going to try frying the meat like a burger and then break it up in chunks and put it in the chili that way.

I have made this chili before and I loved it!  I am making it again.  It’s delicious and freezes well.  To me, it tastes like Wendy’s Chili and it’s pretty good for being served at a fast food restaurant.  It’s my go to rather than a burger and fries.

Wendy's chili is my husbands favorite! Sometimes he'll stop and buy chili and bring it home and I reheat it for dinner. I've tried several "copycat" chili recipes and none have come as close to Wendy's as this has. We love it! Followed the recipe pretty closely and it was perfect, at least for us. Will be using this as our go to recipe from now on!!!

Wonderful chili and so close to Wendy's flavor!  I'm not sure if I could tell them apart in a blind taste test.  

I made it as directed except drained my beans.  In my case I used everything from Aldi's (but they didn't have a Rotel type product so I used Walmart brand). It was so easy.  At first it seemed too runny but around the half-hour mark of simmering it changed into proper chili and continued to improve.  I tasted it before I remembered to add the vinegar and it was sorta flat tasting.  Added the vinegar and tasted again.  Oh my!  Vinegar is amazing!  Secret-ingredient-super-hero.  I don't need any other chili recipe ever.

I've made this chili many times and it's been great each time.  I've tweaked it a little here and there to maximize the flavour but it's great either way. It's definitely a favourite of mine.

This is my go to chili recipe. We really like it!  I’ve made it exactly as the recipe is written and it is very good as is. Some changes I’ve made are just personal preference. I use seasoned diced tomatoes instead of stewed and chili beans in sauce instead of kidney beans just for more flavor. Great recipe!!

I made this tonight for dinner and it is really delicious!  I've maybe had the chili at Wendy's once..but I don't remember it.  I think I got it to dress the baked potato that I bought that day.  Whatever..anyway, I will definitely make it like this from now on.  I didn't have any chili packets, so I used one of the chili seasoning recipes from All Recipes and it was fabulous in this chili.  Now I won't have to buy that again, either!  I did not add the flour ingredient that the seasoning recipe called for because I usually tear up a corn tortilla and cook it with the chili as a thickener.  It dissolves and.it's more authentic tasting.   Great Chili Recipe!  Thanks!

Made as directed and must say it is nearly identical to Wendy’s. If yours doesn’t turn out like mine did, you’re doing it wrong. This is outstanding chili and my Dad loved it. (He is quite a fan of Wendy’s chili, which was why I turned to this recipe.) You nailed it!

Easy, flavorful recipe. Made multiple times, as specified. Next time I will purchase diced tomatoes so I can just dump and go instead of having to chop up the large chunks of stewed tomatoes. I love the suggestion of flattening out the ground beef  without stirring in a hot skillet to let it get very cooked and brown on one side. It adds a LOT of flavor. I’ve adapted that technique for other recipes as well. I also use mild Rotel tomatoes since children will be eating it, and it’s not too spicy. I like to serve it with homemade cornbread and Fritos for those who like to add crunch to their bowl.

I've been making a variation of the same chili recipe for years, but not anymore. This is my new recipe. I made it for a family gathering today and everyone loved it! And I followed this recipe. No substitutes or additions!

I have made chili for years and this is the best recipe yet!  I think the fattier the meat you use the better too.  Don't drain all the good tasting fat away.  Also the browning of the meat whole and pressing into the dutch oven pan is a great tip and makes it taste even better as well.  Making for Halloween gathering and can't wait to hear the compliments!

This is a very AWESOME recipe!! Every time I make it for myself and my wife, we can’t get enough of it! It’s a perfect balance of spicy yet mild. I’m a huge spice person and the wife really isn’t. So this recipe makes chili a perfect meal for us. Thanks for posting!

I added 5 diced green chilies and about 1/8 cup vinegar and cooked in the crockpot on low for 6 hours.
 Found the chili oil at an Asian grocery store just like the foil packs at Wendy's

Amazing, the whole family loved it.  I made 4 pounds of ground beef so I did adjust have to adjust the amounts. Followed the recipe exactly. My husband even brought it to work and his friends said that it was even better than Wendy’s and his one friend loves their chili.  I will be making it again.

Made this with no changes.  I've made a lot of chili recipes but this is exactly what I was looking for - hearty and chunky.  Not a mushy chili.  It's a family favorite now!  I get many requests to make this chili.  Try it just as the recipe reads.

Chili is a staple in our freezer.  I make a huge batch of this chili because it is delicious fresh off the stove, and it is good to freeze.  While tasty on its own, this chili makes a great addition to spaghetti sauce for a quick version of chili spaghetti.   Sometimes I simmer a portion of it until it thickens slightly, add a chunk of cheese, and serve it as a dip with chips.   It's a good topper for baked potatoes or stirred into mac-n-cheese...it's versatile.

This was really delicious! Followed the recipe with the exception of substituting chili beans for the pinto beans, used one less can of tomatoes (used 2 14.5 oz cans of fire roasted diced) and omitted the green pepper as we don’t care for them. Made it in the crockpot after browning the meat. Highly recommend!

Been making different types of chili my whole life. I've made some great ones too. At the end of the day, this is the one my family wants on a regular basis. Thin? Yes, that's what Wendy's chili is. Don't understand negative comments to that point on this forum. To make such a comment is to admit you've never had Wendy's chili. This recipe is, pretty much, spot on. I add hot sauce to my own bowl, just like I add it to my order at the restaurant. For even more 'authentic' texture and taste, let the first layer of ground beef begin hardening in the pan before you start breaking it up.
My subtle changes:
I substitute tomato sauce for water (never been an 'add water' kind of guy).
This recipe is perfect for a 6 quart dutch oven.

I used rice instead of beans and it still tasted great! I also made my own chilly seasoning using the Chilly Powder recipe.

The only thing I did was cut the recipe in half because most of the family doesn't like chili. Beautiful recipe will make chili this way always! Thanks for all the research you put in to this great tasting copycat Wendy's chili!!

I don't know and don't care if this tastes like Wendy's Chili, and don't care if it tastes or doesn't taste like REAL southwest Chili. This is the best Chili I can ever remember eating. Scrumptious.

Yummy in my tummy! I used diced chicken in place of ground beef and didn't cook it as long as it said to because I was impatient to try it. The spices are on point. :)

The only changes I made was to use one package of regular seasoning and one package of mild, I only used two cans of stewed tomatoes instead of three, but that was just by accident, and at the request of my husband, added more black pepper, chili powder and paprika.  We ate it up and finished the whole thing - no complaints!  Thank you for a very good, very easy recipe!

I followed this recipe to a tee and at first was not real sure about the vinegar, I’ve never heard of putting vinegar in chili. After it was done I tasted it and wasn’t impressed  and it looked like Wendy’s but didn’t really taste like Wendy’s so I added the vinegar and tasted it again and oh my gosh, that’s the secret ingredient!!!! Excellent, loved it and so did my daughter and she’s not a big chili fan.  Thanks so much??

I made a vegan version, and it tastes exactly like Wendy's chili, with a couple of changes made.  I used 2 bags of fake "beef" crumbles, and 3 cups of chopped white mushrooms in place of the beef.  Then I added 2 chopped up pablano peppers in adobo sauce.  I also doubled the celery just to use it up.  The pablano peppers in adobo sauce made all the difference to me because before I added them it wasn't exactly like Wendy's, now it is.

Added an extra can of kidney beans but made everything exact to the recipe.  Great recipe and tastes just like Wendy's.  Served it at a birthday party and everyone was impressed.  Thank You!

Made this for my daughter who loves Wendy’s chili followed as written only I cut the recipe in half browned the meat and threw everything  in the crockpot ... Threw all the vegetables in a chopper she doesn’t like anything chunky and used crushed tomatoes instead of stewed she loved it thank you for the recipe!

Excellent recipe!  Love Wendy's chili and will go out of my way to get it.  Honestly believe my doctored version is better than the original, believe it or not!

Changes:
1. Browned my 2.5 lb. burger in bacon grease instead of olive oil.  I usually try to eat healthy, but the bacon grease was already in the pan I wanted to use and bacon makes everything taste better!  

2. Made a big square with the ground beef and cut into quarters with a spatula while browning (reminds me of a quadruple Wendy's back in the day when they were big and fat, not skinny like they are today.  :-).  

3. Seasoned the beef with sazon (Goya Coriander and Annatto) while browning.  

4. After 8-10 minutes on each side, removed meat from first pan to finish in 8 qt. pot with veggies.  

5. Used 1/4 cup - 1/2 cup  beef or chicken stock to keep moist while cooking beef and veggies down.  

6. Doubled portions of onions, peppers, celery, and added a cup of fresh chopped mushrooms.  

7. Doubled the beans (didn't drain) and added an  8 oz. can of fire roasted green chiles .  

8. Garnished the top with sour cream, green onions, cilantro, and jalapeno .  
 

Sorry, I know it's a lot to add/change, but had to record it, and my family LOVED it!

This is a very good chili. I used cannellini beans 'cause I like them better than kidney beans. This recipe is just as tasty using one pound each of ground turkey and beef. I used 2 TB of another seasoning mix. ('Don't think I can mention brand names.) The recipe freezes very well, too.

If you like Wendy's Chili, then you will like this recipe. Don't change or add things until you first do as the recipe states. Then do as you please after. I did however leave the water out as I prefer my Chili thick. That's it. Great job.

This did, in fact, taste just like Wendy's chili, which I love! Had plenty of zip, but not too much heat. This was delicious and I will be making it again!

I agree with Dianals...this was a copy cat Wendy's chili and it was just like the original.  So, if you don't like Wendy's chili why would you even make it.  We loved it!!!!

Our adult daughter does not like ground beef in soups, casseroles, etc.  I sent leftovers of this chili to their house for her husband and son, and she opted to try it because she didn't have time to cook anything else.  I was shocked when she called and said, "I like that chili!!"  I made it according to recipe since it was my first time making it; I won't change anything except to chop up the stewed tomatoes (our preference is much smaller pieces) and to rinse the beans.  This will be my go-to chili recipe.

Great recipe!  Rather than pinto and kidney beans I used 4 cans of Bush’s Medium Hot Chili Beans!  This will be my go-to Chili from now on since my family also loves it!

I never had Wendy's chili, because I don't need ground beef. So I use ground turkey, and only 1 pound. I left out the tomatoes with green chiles.,And  one can of sauce. The flavor was great.  My wife said it tasted better the next day.  She said it didn't really taste like Wendy's chili, because Wendy's chili is more watery. I also used sherry vinegar instead of white vinegar.

I have never been a big fan of chili but I tried this one and I couldn’t get enough of it! It was the best I’ve ever had! The only change I made was that I added 1lb of ground beef instead of 2  it didn’t want meat to overpower the chili and this was perfect!

Made almost as is.  I used diced tomatoes instead of stewed tomatoes, used 2 cans of kidney beans and omitted the pinto beans.  Cooked all in a oversized skillet, up to adding the beans.  I emptied skillet into a crockpot, then added beans & salt & pepper to taste.  Set cooker on low, enjoyed 6 hours later with grilled cheese sandwiches!   Loved this recipe, I have tried other copycat recipes and this one is the real deal!

I really liked this recipe. It made plenty of chili. Enough for easily 3 or 4 meals. I've never had Wendy's Chili. Just needed a chili to pour over tamales. A very Tex Mex tradition. My family adored the meal and will be happy to have it again soon.

"I could eat this chili all day." - Husband

So I'd say it's a winner. My only complaint I'd next time I'd half the meat and double the beans to make a more frugal recipe.

This was so good.  Very close to Wendy’s chili. Followed recipe and the results were delicious. My family gobbled it up.  We love Wendy’s chili and this is as close as you are going to get. Family liked it better than my chili and so did I. This is our new family chili. Thanks so much for sharing. You have a winner.

I LOVE Wendy's chili, except my tummy can't handle beans well.  So when I saw this recipe, I had to try it.  I used the same brands that were noted in the recipe but got the ones that did NOT say "mild," because both my husband and  I love spicy food (I'm assuming those non-mild ones are the original flavors?).  I wanted to make it in a slow-cooker,  so after browning the meat and dumped it in the pot, I sauteed the veggies in the same pan with the fat from the meat, dumped it in the pot and added the rest of ingredients.  It was spicier than Wendy's but the flavor was definitely there and it's delicious!  I believe it would have been really close to the real deal if I used the "mild" tomatoes and seasoning packets, just a touch of sweetness must have been the key. I can't wait to make this for my kids.  They will love it (the sweeter original version). The prep was super easy too. Thanks for sharing!

I don't have a Wendy's where I live, so can't say how close it is, but I can say it's one of the BEST chili's I've ever had, and very easy to make.

Excellent recipe.  Tastes just like Wendy’s chili to me. I love the veggies in it.  Tastes lighter than chili with just the meat and beans.  My family loves it and it is my go to recipe! Thank you for sharing it!

Pretty darn close to Wendy’s.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I did chop the stewed tomatoes up in the food processor for a few seconds.  Great recipe.  Will make this again.

The chili was fantastic, next time I make it I will spice it up with a little jalapeno, but it is very good as is.

Awesome.  I was skeptical about it tasting like Wendy's, but I wasn't disappointed.  Although, I forgot to add the vinegar at the end.

My husband loves Wendy's chili and says this really does taste like it. I browned the ground beef, then threw in the bell pepper, onion and celery as it says to. But I had an appointment, so after that I threw everything into the crock pot and let it cook on high a couple hours. I forgot to do the vinegar step. Still turned out wonderful.

Doubled The Beans, Substituted Pintos For White Northern Beans.

This recipe is nothing like Wendy's Chili, So if your sole purpose is trying to replicate Wendy's concoction you may be disappointed. While not being anything close to what is served at Wendy's, it is actually the most similar that I have come accross. If you are one that believes Wendy's has great Chili, and you can set your taste buds "looking for an exact Wendy's fix" bias aside, I think you will find this recipe to actually be superior to the authentic Wendy's recipe. 

But is Is this recipe really Chili?

The only cause for a negitive review on this recipe, seems to be the question on whether this dish is authentic Chili or not. If this is not in fact Chili, then Wendy's does not serve Chili regardless of thier menu stating otherwise.

It is not fair to give such a tasty recipe a bad review becuase of your beliefs and preconceived notions on what Chili is or should be. People find this recipe because they are in search of a dish similar to what Wendy's serves. Not becuase they are Chili Puritans who wouldn't dear commit blasphemy by allowing their taste buds to interact with what might be a delicious dish just becuase it is incorrectly named. It would be very difficult to find this recipe if one had to search "Recipe for Wendy's not really authentic Chili but called Chili"

I cannot claim to be an expert on what constitutes Chili. Many better men have literally died in gun battles arguing about what Chili i

This was very good, but I would use 1 less can of stewed tomatoes next time.  There were quite a few floating around even though I put them through the food processor.  I can't comment on how close to Wendy's it is because I haven't been there in so long.

Pretty good! Made as described. Next time, might make at least one package of McCormick's something more than "mild" heat. I did rinse the beans and drained the hamburger/veggies combo after sautéing the vegetables. I also accidentally picked up the Italian version of one of the cans of stewed tomatoes, but that apparently didn't make a difference. Tasty!

This recipe is a keeper.  I made a half batch for the two of us.  It tastes just like Wendy's chili.  I did leave out the vinegar because it was so good without it.  This is my new go-to chili recipe.

I made this recipe exactly as written, except after browning the beef, I threw all the ingredients into the crock pot. One thing to be aware of - this makes A LOT of chili! My crock pot was filled to the brim, and even after hubby and I had it for dinner, I had 4 quart sized freezer bags filled with leftovers. But hey, enough chili to get through the winter is not necessarily a bad thing. That being said, I would probably halve the recipe if you're not cooking for a pot luck or a big family. Also, the chili was very mild when made with mild chili seasoning. One of those Duh things, I know, but even though I don't like super-spicy, I will probably make it with medium seasoning next time. You could also do one packet of each if you wanted it somewhere in the middle. Other than that, it was meaty and filling and yummy!!

I have experimented with different chili recipes and this is by far the best one I have ever made. I see some negative comments about the celery. I cut the it down to 1 stalk. This is going to be the chili I make for now on!

Chili also has beans in it , so depending on my mood, I will add a can of bean of choice (red, black, white, pinto).  I like to top my chili with fresh cut jalapeño to add some heat.

My son loves Wendy's Chili, so I'll definitely keep making this for him.  Only one but....Maybe I'm a non-vegetarian, but I don't see 2 lbs. of ground beef feeding 10 people. My guys like their meat.

I don’t normally like chili, as I don’t like the texture of ground beef; I’ve never been a huge fan. But I *have* always loved Wendy’s chili for some reason, so I thought I’d give this a try anyway, and I only changed one thing, which is that I used crushed tomatoes instead of stewed. It tasted very similar to Wendy’s chili, but I couldn’t get past that beef texture, so next time I might have to use all beans or maybe ground turkey or pork, as those are a little “softer” in texture, or maybe even quinoa.

I like the taste of the Wendy's chili profile, and this recipe gets fairly close to that flavor profile.  The stewed tomatoes left chunks of tomatoes that were way too large, so I would definitely recommend dicing the stewed tomatoes before adding them to the pot.  Otherwise, great recipe that you can adjust the heat profile to suit your needs.  I will certainly make this again.

This was pretty good (and more importantly it was easy to make).  I will add extra vinegar next time and some jalapenos for some spice.

Wonderful Wendy's chili recipe. I think you got it! 
I wanted to pressure can chili for winter...found your recipe! Adjusted serviing size to 50 & canned exactly 21 qts.

This recipe is great! To make things easy, I browned he meat and then threw that in a crock pot with the all the remaining ingredients. About 5-6 hours in low -it was perfect!

Great recipe - really tastes BETTER than Wendy’s Chili honestly. We’ve made this TONS of times (too many to count) and great news is that we’ve had the chance to test changes to the recipe. These are a couple we settled on. First, the ground beef. I use 1-1.5 lbs of ground beef (70% lean, 30% fat), no oil needed. We omitted the water, since the canned veggies have so much in there (plus, who wants to dilute the flavor?). For canned beans, we use 30oz can of chili beans, which acts as a thickening agent and adds a ton of good flavor. No vinegar, salt, or pepper needed (can you believe that?). I even added an additional McCormick chili powder (3 packets total) - but chose to go with the Original flavor for the 3rd packet, rather than Mild. It turns out perfectly each time - probably less like Wendy’s but much better. ;) Thank you for this quick one-pot family favorite! Can’t get any better than this!

We really liked this. I used ground turkey instead of beef and I substituted 3 T chili powder & 1 T cumin for the McCormick spices.  I doubled the beans. Was not sure whether to simmer covered or uncovered so I did half time covered & half time uncovered. Delicious with fresh bread or tortilla chips.

This was so amazing. I did add 3 red chilies for a bit more bite. Next time (and there will be a next time) I leave the ground beef slightly more chunky also. But this recipe is a WINNER!!

This tastes just like it! I really love this recipe. I would suggest to either not include the water, or drain the water from the stewed tomatoes, as I found it a tab bit too liquid-y for my tastes. I only did 1 package of seasoning and 1 LB of beef by mistake, and turned out just fine. :)

My family loves chili and unfortunately up until now I have never been able to make a chili that everyone likes. My family and friends all love this, I have made it twice now and will definitely make it again. We serve ours with fresh hot cornbread. Ummm, ummm.

Instead of pinto beans, I used chili beans with a little of its sauce. It was good, tasted pretty traditional which is what I was in the mood for.

Spot on!  Wendy's chili has always been my favorite chili.  I have been trying different 'Wendy's chili' recipes for years with no success.  My husband and I tried this one last night and it is just about as identical as you can get without actually having the recipe from the Wendy's franchise.   Thanks so much for this recipe!  It's a forever keeper.

Delicious. Last time I ate Wendy's chili was 20 years ago, it tasted similar if that is what you are looking for. However, of all the chili recipes I have made, this had been the best so far. Made as written except omitted celery. I alway use the leanest ground beef I can find (93-96% lean). Made it with Grandma's cornbread from this site, also recommend! Yum!

Awesome the best chili I have ever made at home!

I sometimes spice it up a bit or just leave as is, wonderful base chili so you can add your own touches.

Excellent recipe and will make it again.  I added 1/2 tsp of smoked paprika because I remembered Wendy's chili having a slightly smoky flavor.   Jarred up the chili and realized I forgot the tbsp of vinegar.  Will make sure I add that next time but (IMO) the chili tasted fine without it.

Great recipe!  Since I like my chili spicy I substituted 6-8 Serrano peppers instead of the bell pepper.  I also used the Hot McCormick chili seasoning . Did not add any vinegar.  And last thing I added was another can of the Rotel diced tomatoes with chilies.  I encourage people to try it. 
Thanks

This recipe is excellent!  Will definitely be making this my #1 chili recipe.  I forgot to buy a green pepper at the store but the chili turned out awesome just the same--VERY close to Wendy's chili.  Other than the pepper I made the recipe as shown.  Perfection!!

Made it exactly according to recipe. I then tweaked it to taste. I added 1 1/2 Tbsp chili seasoning and 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper. PERFECT! I won't make any other chili again! It's a keeper!

My family LOVED this recipe, even the little kids. They have already asked me to make it again. The only changes I made were to leave out the celery due to allergies, and used diced tomatoes instead of whole, (since you have to chop them up anyway!) This was perfect for me since I don't like spicy chili!

This is now my only chili recipe! I could never please my husband with the chili's I've made in the past but saw this and remembered that he does like Wendy's chili and decided to give this a shot. So glad I did ! Very happy fed family tonite. I used all the ingredients in suggested amounts only difference was I browned the onions and ground beef and peppers in a pan and threw it along with everything else in my crockpot for 3 hours. Turned out amazing. Ty so much!

LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! My boyfriend love's wendy''s chili so I was a bit skeptical to make this recipe for him because of the negative comment I read. I thought "what If there aren't enough beans in it?" "What If it's too soupy?" But instead of adding extra beans or less of anything, I thought I'd just follow the directions my first time around. I'm soooo glad I did because it was very delicious!! For the most part I did everything the same....except.....I had fatty ground beef so I used 2.5lbs, not sure if I was supposed to drain it, but I did. My cans of tomato were 1oz bigger that instructed as that was all the store had. Also, I was so excited to dig in that I forgot the vinegar at the end but it was still so good. I hollowed out some sourdough bread and served it in a bread bowl sprinkled with cheese. Will make over and over again. Thank you for this recipe!!

We really liked this recipe. We used extra beans.  I used no salt produces for health reasons so it tasted a little sweet until I added the white vinegar at the end.   My husband added salt to his bowl and it was very close to Wendy's chili.  This will be a standard at our house now.  And btw, this recipe makes a ton of chili.  We will freeze the extra  for later

This recipe turned out great. I only used 1 (14 ounce) can of stewed tomatoes, as it was enough for 6 people + leftovers. Everyone in the house loved it! I also added corn, spinach (sounds crazy I know, but it was delicious), red pepper, garlic and made my own chili seasoning (flour, chili powder, parsley, basil, crushed red pepper, ground cumin, salt &pepper) instead of the packages. While it simmered I also threw in some bay leaves and some thyme. This is now my go to chili recipe

I'm ranking this recipe at 4 stars, primarily because my family really enjoyed it. I would have chosen 3 stars. The recipe is reminiscent of Wendy's chili, but not a dead-on ringer. It's fine, but not as spicy as I like, though that could be easily fixed. There are plenty of better chili recipes out there, but this one is fine, particularly if you are in a hurry. It comes together quickly.

I would add one more pound of hamburger, one more green pepper and put the stewed tomatoes in a food processor and pulse it it a few times to help break up the tomatoes.  Great recipe and I will definitely make it again.

Not bad when trying to please a family who doesn't like too much spice or heat.  I preffered it when I drained and rinsed the beans and I omitted the water all together.
Personally I think the beans could be doubled and keep a good bottle of hot sauce on hand for those who like a little more heat.  A good chili for a group of  varying tastes.

I've always thought that Wendy's chili is very similar to the chili recipe my family has used for 60 plus years. The primary difference is my recipe uses chili powder rather than a seasoning mix, a bit of brown sugar is added and we only use kidney beans no pinto beans. This recipe is good as written though.

Use a very large skillet.  The chili came to the top of the largest skillet  I have.  It's 12 inches (30 centimeters wide) and about  4 inches deep.  I was following the recipe exactly until the end.  I threw  beans in without draining or rinsing  just like the directions stated.  I drained and rinsed the other can of beans though.  I had my husband taste the chili before I added the second packet of chili seasoning.  He liked it as it was so I did not open the second packet or add vinegar at the end.  The chili was very thick & delicious.

I would substitute less celery for diced hot peppers. Also, I am not keen on stewed tomatoes because they are too sweet. I usually stay with diced tomatoes with chili.  Overall, pretty good!

You really don't need to add salt or pepper, it's already pretty good with just the McCormick seasoning. I used half beef and half pork for mine and had about 2.5 pounds of meat. I also used the rainbow bell peppers instead of just green. This thing came out fantastic and it was super easy. Just make sure you have a big pot. ????

I made this and it was really good. I made enough for dinner and enough to freeze. Actually I have made this twice the first time with the ranch style kidney beans and the 2nd with just regular kidney beans. For some reason I liked it better with the ranch style. Just my opinion but great recipe either way.

Original 4/16: I asked my husband if it was close to Wendy's chili and he said it was better! Only used 1lb beef (90/10), half an onion, 1 stick of celery and oops just remembered forgot the vinegar, and of course I'll make it again.
Revised: Made it again 5/16 with the 2lbs of beef, a whole onion, 1/4 of a pepper and 1 stick of celery. Still delicious.

Tastes good! All the various canned tomatoes already had salt, so I did not add any additional in the chili (and omitted salt in the chili seasoning mix II on the site) Made with ground turkey, and thinking it would work well with cubed beef as well. Thanks!

This is the best chili I have made and now it is my go-to recipe every time.  Cooking the meat as a large patty works well - you can use leaner hamburger but break it into chunks when its cooked for more texture in your chili.

Hi everyone, this is Crickkette??, and anyone who does not like this 'makes your taste buds do their HAPPY DANCE chili', should stop pretending to be a Cook Off Judge. This chili is even better than Wendy's. Got a double batch on the stove right now!! Only thing better is SUPER BOWL 50 soon to start........so go make this fantastic chili, and 'GO BRONCOS'!!!! Bon Appétit

Nearly exactly like Wendy's!  I left out the celery because I didn't want to spend almost 4 bucks just for two stalks. Also, the stewed tomatoes are huge and I spent 10 minutes cutting them into smaller chunks. I think next time I would do crushed tomatoes instead. But it tastes perfect and I'm so happy with it!

Made this with Instant Pot.  It was delicious.  Probably the best batch of chili I've ever made.  Kids and husband loved it!  The pressure cooker was set to 30 minutes using the Chili button. I used what I had in the pantry so here are the modifications:  only 1 packet of chili mix, only 2 cans of stewed  tomatoes, added 1/2 cup of chili powder, beef broth instead of water

This was really quite delicious. I've never had Wendy's chili before, but I liked all the ingredients so I thought I would give it a try. I tried to stay as close to the recipe as I could. My only modifications were using the Chili Seasoning Mix II from this site and cooking in on low for 7hrs in the slow cooker. It's was very flavorful and not spicy at all. I will definitely make this again.

for the purists chili makers,  Wendy's Chili is not an example of such.   However .. .   this recipe is a great example of the product that Wendy's sells and is the favorite chili of  my favorite person;  my wife.   So, for those who would say it isn't chili from a purists perspective -  you're right .   This recipe is not for you.  For those like me who wanted to recreate something close to Wendy's chili -  this get's really close.   

I added 3 jalapeno peppers with the vegetables and used three packs of generic chile mix from my local grocery.   turned out  great!

It did taste very similar to Wendy's chili.  It is not the kind of chili I would put on a hot dog, but the recipe did not claim it was.  Just thought I would throw that in.  We ate some with Fritos and later we ate the rest with saltines.

This does taste like Wendy's chili. I used 2 T vinegar instead of 1, other than that, I followed the recipe.

Super easy and good.  I didn't have tomato sauce so I ended up just adding another can of tomatoes with chili.  Worked just fine.   It makes quite a bit so that makes me even more happy! This is perfect for a potluck or game day.

Excellent.  Tastes like Wendy's chili.  My husband told me, "I hate to say it, but this is better than your chili"...LOL.  This will now be my go to recipe.  I made it exactly as stated in recipe and instructions.  I would make no changes.

I am always nervous about trying a new chili recipe because it varies wildly from person to person. I looked for a chili I knew I loved (oh yeah Wendy's). This was spot on. The only think I did differently was to pureed the stewed tomatoes before adding them to the crockpot.

Also, this recipe makes ALOT of chili. It filled my crockpot to the brim. We only have 3 people in our house and even after everyone had seconds that night, we still had leftovers for over a week. I will halve this recipe next time.

I've made it several times and love it. But since I love spicy foods, I decided to make some substitutions without adding cayenne pepper. Instead of mild or original McCormick chili seasoning mix, I used HOT chili seasoning mix. Also, I used Rotel HOT diced tomatoes made with habaneros. Finally, the best part, instead of white vinegar, I poured in all the vinegar of a 12 oz can of La Costeña pickled jalapeño nacho slices and threw in half of the jalapeños for good measure. The spicy version warmed me to the core and got rid of my stuffy nose. Awesome!

This is a wonderful soup. It makes
 a lot and I have enough to 
have it for dinner and then we
use  the rest for coney
hot dogs and chili spaghetti.
I used chili beans instead
of kidney beans.

I made this chili exactly as the recipe states, and this is the best chili I ever had. It's exactly how I like my chili. More meat and not too many beans with just the right amount of bite to it. It's not too hot or too bland. Just right. I make this all the time now. The whole family loved it. Thank you for this easy recipe that doesn't have too many ingredients. The only thing I may add next time is some chopped carrots but honestly it's just perfect as is.

Left out the vinegar at the end (didn't feel it needed it for my taste) and added a bit of sugar to help balance out the acidity of the tomatoes, but otherwise followed the recipe as written.  A very good likeness to the famous Wendy's chili!  The trick is to get that ground meat caramelized!  That's where so much flavor is!  Also, really loved the whole stewed tomatoes in this recipe!

This tastes alot like Wendy's. I added 3 cups of water instead of 1 because it was to concentrated with just one. Also I accidentally bought only one seasoning pack but it was still good. I liked the taste the vinegar gave it. Awesome recipe!!

My family LOVES this recipe! This is the only chili recipe I use. My modifications include omitting the olive oil and with the rising cost of beef, I've been using only one pound of meat. No one's noticed!

Tasty recipe. And yes, i think it tastes like Wendy's!  I used one package of original seasoning, and one package of "hot", which gave it the perfect amount of spice for my liking.  Makes a lot, and i'm looking forward to freezing the half we didn't eat, and having it another cold day.  Served with cornbread.

This is great chili! I don't know how it compares with Wendy's though because I never go to fast food restaurants. I did use 2 cans of beans as she suggested and dropped way back on the hot spices since we don't really care for hot. Will be making this for company as well. Thanks

I made this chili today. It was wonderful. It is in my class of comfort food. I made it exactly as written except I added  an extra can of kidney beans. Wife likes beans but it really does not need any more beans than called for. It was a bit thick easily remedied with a little more water. I will make it again and again. I intend to experiment with spices so I don't have to buy the packets. Thank you very much for sharing this recipe.

Different in a GOOD way!  One of my keepers that I was even able to give to "spicy" sensitive grand kids.  I did not have pinto bean and used a can of reds.  Still exceptional.  I guess it must have been the vinegar as I have never added it before.  Thank you.

Love it! I used veggie crumbles instead of ground beef and added black beans and light red kidney beans along with the dark red kidney beans and pinto beans listed in recipe.

I made this using 1 hot season pack & 1 mild season pack. I know the recipe calls for 2 mild but my family likes a little spicy. everything else I did exactly  the same. All is can say is this recipe is AWESOME!!!!!!!! it tastes EXCATLEY like Wendys!!!
I wish I could give it more stars!!!!!!!!! using the 2 different spice packs makes it just slightly spicy. again AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!! Thanks for the recipe!!!  :)

Fantastic!!! I like to make chili on cold nights but I have never found a recipe that I like ... Until now! This is a GREAT recipe. I haven't had Wendy's chili in quite a while but it does remind me of it. Either way, this is the recipe that I will go to every tiime I make chili. Thank you for posting it. FYI, I made it exactly as except I used 3 lbs of ground meat just because that was the size of the package I bought. I would suggest it because it was thick & meaty.

I also have tried many chili recipes.  This was by far the closest to the real Wendy's chili. This will definitely be the go to chili recipe that I use. Super good! Also takes easily to adjustments for batch size. Double batch filled my extra large stockpot about 1.5 to 2 gal. Excellent for halftime party! Thank you for the recipe!

Great recipe, but we like it hot! Try McCormick Hot Chili Seasoning, 3/4 of a 6oz can of tomato paste and substitute one pound of beef for Italian Sausage. It's to die for!

Loved it. Made it almost exactly as stated in the recipe and it was great. It does taste a lot like Wendy's chili which is great because it is a mild chili that you can eat day after day and not worry about the heat building up on you.

The first time EVER my husband said he loved a chili I made- and he said it twice! It's pretty darn close to Wendy's flavor and consistency. My only regret was that I cut the recipe in half since I was only cooking for three and I wasn't sure if it would turn out well. Cutting it in half also wastes the canned ingredients as you use half a can of everything. Next time I will make the 10-serving batch and freeze the leftovers- frozen chili sets up so well it will be even better!

Loved it. It had just enough heat to it. Used the Walmart brand of Chili style stewed tomatoes, and half a jalapeno pepper plus Club house chili seasoning.

Didn't change a thing (except used ground turkey because that's what we had).  I've made a lot of different chilis in my lifetime.  This is our "go to" recipe for chili now!

Followed the recipe except used vegetable oil in place of olive oil, rinsed all of the beans and added an extra can of kidney beans. The closest to Wendy's chili that I have tried so far. Really hit the spot.

I love this recipe and so does all of my family!  To save on sodium and to make it more mild for my children, I used only one package of chili seasoning.

Very good, i halved the recipe for the three of us and had plenty for leftovers. A little more spicy than i like (i'm a wimp) and i used the mild chili seasoning packet. put cheese and sour cream on it...yum....oh, and my 11 year old cooked it (with my assistance, but he did 90%, that's how easy it is). Left out the green peppers, we don't like them. As far as just like Wendy's? can't honestly remark on that, it's been a loooooonnnnnngggg time since we had Wendy's. But a great chili recipe.

Plan on making this over the weekend. My dad used to talk about Wendy's Chili, There's only one Wendy's around here and I can only get there when I drive, which isn't often. Anyways, I plan on using diced tomatoes without green chili's but with onion and green pepper. I'm also going to toss in some diced carrots for a bit of flavor. Maybe half a tsp of tomato paste. Does anyone think these will change the chili too much, also plan on using mild seasoning packages, not a fan of spice. 

I'll let you guys know how it turns out!
