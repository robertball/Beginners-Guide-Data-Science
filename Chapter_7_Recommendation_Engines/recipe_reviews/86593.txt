This was wonderful.  Instead of beef broth I used 1 cup chicken broth, and a little less than a cup of orange juice with about a quarter cup of balsamic vinegar.  I stuffed the cavity with onion rather than carrots and used Paula Deen's house seasoning to season the bird.  The bacon on top was to die for and my husband and I ended up fighting over it.  The sauce was a little sweet with a slight citrus flavor thanks to the orange juice.  I boiled it down slightly and thickened with some cornstarch and water.  I will make this again for sure.

This recipe ROCKS!  THis is how my Mom makes it!  It's true about the bacon basting the chicken.  I haven't tried the beef broth part of it, I don't use that...but the bacon REALLY WORKS!  I stuff mine with whatever i can find heading south in the fridge.  Lemons, limes, carrots, apples, pinapple, parsley, onion, oranges...any combo will do as long as you stuff it!    Thanks for the recipe, Rio...nice to see the tradition LIVE ON!

This recipe is great! I altered it a little bit after reading the other reviews. I used a garlic herb seasoning by McCormick on the chicken and stuffed it with an onion cut up. I also didn't use any broth. I just used a little water in the the roasting pan. It was so moist and tender. EXCELLENT

I had company coming and thought I would try this recipe,I had read the reviews that the bacon didn't do much for the flavor so I decided to tenderize the breast with a piercer then attached the bacon. The chicken was awsome and the breast was juicy and flavorful. Definitely would make this again

I used rosemarry instead of thyme since I didn't have any on hand and I really liked the flavor. I also added 1/4 onion, 2 cloves of garlic and a 1/4 cup of rosemarry inside the chicken with the carrots. super easy. remember if you have more than a 4lb chicken to cook it 18 to 25 minutes per pound! It must reach an internal temp of 180. I went to 185 and it was still very moist. this meal was GREAT and the bacon was awesome. However, Leaving the bacon on the top the whole time did not allow the skin to brown. we will be making this again for sure.

This chicken had so much flavor!  My boyfriend says this is the best chicken he has ever had.  I crumbled the leftover bacon and mixed it with mashed potatoes.  Yum!

I normally roast my chicken, breast side down to ensure a very moist bird, however, this time I had a roast with the pop up timer. I wanted to find a recipe that would help keep the breast juicy and this really seemed to do the trick. I don't know why beef broth instead of chicken broth, but I went with the chicken as that's what I normally use anyway. Of course I used more seasonings, along with a splash of white wine. The gravy was delicious and the bird was incredibly flavorful. Thanks so much!

This was good.  I really liked the bacon idea.  The juices could not be used for any kind of gravy though- not very good.  I stuffed the chicken with garlic and onion and it soaked up those flavors too.  This is how I keep my meatloaf moist and its good to know it works on chicken too!

What a hit! Easy to make, completely delicious. I used vegetable broth instead of beef broth, but that was my only change. It was juicy, and tender. Everyone in the family loved it. I will be printing this out to keep for sure.

Wow!  Wow!  Wow!  I am 100% in awe of how delicious this chicken was.  I bought a small fryer from the store big enough for me and my husband to try (never roasted a whole chicken before) and this recipe made it so incredibly tasty.  I served it with the bacon, mashed potatoes and green beans and it made for an incredible meal. KUDOS TO THE CHEF!!

My family loved this recipe.  We eat healthy through the week, and "splurge" on Sundays.  I am always irritated by ratings of recipes on this site based on fat content, calories, cholesterol.  Rate the recipe when you make it, if you don't try the recipe based on the ingredients, don't post.

If I could give this MORE stars, I would!  Taking others' advice I stuffed the inside of my chicken with chopped up celery, onion, lemon, carrots and a bit of minced garlic.  I rubbed the butter all over it and draped it with bacon and counted the seconds til it was done - especially once that delicious aroma hit the house.   Follow the recipe adjusting for the size of your bird and you CAN'T go wrong.  I had to add an extra cup of beef broth because my bird was a little bigger.  By the way, I think the beef broth adds a TON to the flavor of this chicken.  I didn't have any broth, so I used 3 boullion cubes + 3 cups boiling water.  I threw the leftover bacon in with some mashed potatoes with sour cream.  Gosh!  It was so flipping good.  My hubby LOVED it!

Great recipe.  I used chicken bullion instead of beef broth and sliced four garlic cloves, instead of carrots, and put them in the cavity.  If you make a gravy with the drippings, be sure to include the juices from the chicken to capture the flavor.  Also, if you get the giblets with the chicken, make a broth with them to use to make the gravy.  I used thick sliced bacon and reduced the slices to four.  If you dare, use Szegeo hot Hungarian paprika to give the chicken and gravy an extra kick.  Yummy....:)  p.s. I used extra virgin olive oil instead of butter to rub on the chicken...;)

For my first roasted chicken, this turned out five stars! I stuffed it with chunks of onion, carrots and lime wedges. I wish I had remembered to put some garlic in there too, next time! My house smelled better than on Thanksgiving Day!

You can also do this with individual chicken breasts.  Wrap bacon (I use turkey bacon for lighter version) around the chicken (use 1-2 pieces to cover entire piece of chicken).  Secure with toothpicks.  Spritz with cooking spray.  Cook for about 20 mins. at 400 degrees.  Very tender & juicy!

I do this to chicken and turkey, but I run my hand under the skin to loosen it then lay bacon under the skin in an even layer, gives the chicken or turkey a lightly smoked and juicy flavor and the skin is so beautiful, it looks like a magazine cover.

I will always make my roasted chicken this way from now on. I told my Mom about it and she said she used to make this all the time. Why I do not remember, I have no idea!! I used chicken broth instead and made a delicious gravy for our masheded potatoes. I took some of the great advice and put some of the crispy bacon in the potatoes too1

Great recipe and flavor. I also seasoned the inside of the chicken before I added  the carrots. Adjust cooking time for size of bird. I used a 6 1/2# bird and it took 2 1/2 hrs.

My family loved this recipe. I have 3 very picky eaters and they all asked for thirds! Very moist chicken. I used the bacon to make garlic, bacon, cheddar mashed red potatoes. The bacon had so much flavor, the potatoes were fabulous! Thanks for the recipe.

This is a good recipe! We used apples in the chicken instead of carrots and only had 3 thick pieces of bacon to put on top and it was still yummy. The bacon was outstanding and the chicken was moist and yummy. Thanks!

Excellent recipe--this idea of bacon on chicken was genius! The only thing I changed was stuffing the cavity with onions and lemons which gave a great flavor. I also latticed the bacon (you can see pics) which allowed for maximum bacon and you didnt need any toothpicks to keep it in place. The chicken was moist and had excellent flavor!!!

My family loves this recipe.  I adjusted it to suit the ingredients I had on hand.  I used chicken broth instead of beef.  I used breasts, drumsticks and thighs placed over cut up carrots and onions and adjusted the cooking time.  I placed the roasted bacon in a mini chopper and used it to make a yummy gravy with the de-fatted broth after roasting (QUICK AND EASY WAY TO DEFAT THIS - pour drippings over a large bowl filled with ice - the fat will stick to the ice).  It was FABULOUS over the chicken and the mashed potatoes I made with it.  I'll make this recipe again and again.  Thank you!

This is my new way to make chicken, and I will use it often. 
I poked holes in the chicken, and you could taste the bacon flavor thoughout. 
I crumbled the bacon in mashed potatoes, thickend the juices with some cornstarch, and what a gravy it made!
I also added garlic and onion with the carrots in the bird. 
My picky hubby even liked this meal.
Thanks!

This brought back so many memories from my childhood! My mother would make a bacon draped chicken on Sundays and my dad and I would fight over who got to eat the bacon. This chicken was moist and flavorful. I didn't use the carrots, but stuffed it with onion, celery, and garlic. Thank you!

This turned out to be very good - the chicken was very moist and the bacon was FABULOUS!! I'd almost cook it just for the bacon! I used chicken broth instead of beef because that's what I had, but otherwise followed the recipe. The only thing I'd do differently is to add more salt, pepper & thyme after taking the bacon off and putting the chicken back in to brown the skin. Most of the seasoning stuck to the bacon.

This was really good!  The hubs and the kids liked it too, which the boy usually doesn't like non-breaded chicken.  I used chicken broth instead of beef, only because it's what I had.  I'm intrigued by the thought of beef broth with chicken though.  I stuffed it with a green apple and onion since that's what I had that I thought might be good in there.  I chopped up the bacon and added it to the green bean side dish.  Fabulous too.  This was a juicy and flavorful chicken.  I'll have to make again for sure.

Wonderful recipe! Subbed fresh rosemary for thyme and chicken stock for beef. Also added onions in with the carrots. Cooked with potatoes then served bacon crumbled over potatoes as a side.

This was really good. Took longer to cook then given in the directions, but my chicken was 5 1/2 pounds. I added 4 green onions to the inside when I stuffed the chicken with carrots. And increased the broth to a total of 2 cans of beef broth and 1 carton of baby portabello mushrooms. I removed the bacon as suggested in the finally step of baking and chopped the bacon up and used it as a garnish. With the broth and mushrooms, I removed the mushrooms, strained it and made pan gravy(pulled a portion of gravy out from my son, who doesn't like mushrooms) then added the mushrooms back and served it over garlic mashed potatoes and chicken. We soo enjoyed the flavors of this recipe.

This was Awesome!  I used 1 3/4 cups chicken broth due to lack of beef broth and about 1/4 cup balsmic vinegar.  Stuffed it with chopped onion, carrot, and apple.  The apple and onion turned out wonderful but in the future would leave the carrot out.  My 2 year old and 6 year old couldn't get enough of the chicken, it was extremely moist.  Will definitely be making this again.

I thought this was very good. But as far as roasted chickens, it's not the best recipe I've tried. I replaced the carrot with onion and used beef bouillon and water to baste the chicken. I served it with mashed potatoes and Zucchini Parmesan bread (Taste of Home recipe).

The bacon made this chicken so moist!  Next time I will add some onions and garlic to the cavity, otherwise it was great.

This was fantastic! My family loved it. I added a chicken broth based sauce and served this with rice. I didn't follow a sauce recipe... I just made it with a variety of seasonings, a little flour, some minced mushrooms and finely chopped parsley.  Very delicious chicken!

Oh. My. Wow. Give the beef broth a chance, people! I thought it would be odd, but am glad I didn't switch to chicken broth. I went to an expensive restaurant in Seattle after a Mariner's game and have never been able to replicate the flavor of their half chicken dish I had. Until now!!!! I stuffed it with a small onion and 1 tablespoon minced garlic. Used butter, broth, bacon, and basting time as indicated and it was a AMAZING (added more seasonings though)! Mine needed more oven time. Bacon was GREAT chopped and added to our potato dish. Thanks so much!!!!!!

I like using only four bacon strips as eight seems to make things a little too greasy and I skip adding the beef broth to the pan.  But overall this is a great recipe for very MOIST chicken!

this is great. i have a similar version... i take boneless/skinless chicken tenderloins, wrap a strip of bacon spiraled around each chicken strip and bake. then for the last 10-15 min, i put a slice of mozzarella cheese on top of each one. it gets all brown and bubbly. my son LOVES this and asks for it ALOT! LOL

Wow, just, WOW. I've never baked a whole chicken before and I thought I'd give this a try. I'm so glad this was the first recipe I decided to go with. Of course I added different seasonings and veggies but it was aboslutley perfect! It was SOOO juicy and delicious! A new favorite in my house. ^.^ Thank you so much for this recipe!!

This is really a good chicken, but it needed more spices. Also, I omitted the salt altogether and used low sodium chicken broth. That way, I could add veggies to bake with the chicken and avoid the saltiness from my first attempt at this recipe. My changes made this 'good' chicken a GREAT complete meal. Search for my adapted recipe on this site to see my changes (:

You but butter, then bacon on chicken fat. keep basting for a lot of work, with little reward. Will Way don't bother.  Would much prefer the beer can chicken you put it in the oven and leave it alone.

The bacon cooked on the chicken itself was divine!  The chicken was very moist, but we didn't see where the bacon added that much flavor to the chicken - BUT, if you ate the chicken WITH the bacon, heaven.  We cooked the bacon a little longer in the microwave once removed from teh chicken.

This was incredibly juicy and was the first roasted chicken I ever made. Bacon was very yummy but stuck to the skin of the chicken. I would try using the bacon on a turkey breast roast too. I had a hard time spreading the butter on the skin so I would brush with olive oil next time. Also, I had to substitute with chicken broth as I was out of the beef. Looking forward to trying it with the beef broth next time. Definitely better than the roasted chickens you pick up at the hot counter at the grocery store.

This was the juciest chicken I have ever tasted. I added a stick of celery and half of an onion to the cavity of the chicken. It was perfect! Also, I was out of broth so I just added water with two bullions cubes. My husband and I were both in food comas! This was so easy and delicious!

Used chicken breasts instead of the whole chicken since my family is not a fan of dark meat and too much would go to waste. No carrots, but same premise. Chicken was tender and juicy. They loved it and the bacon added a wonderful flavor. I will definitely be making this again.

This was pretty good but we weren't blown away by it.  The bacon itself was the best part!  I poked holes in the chicken skin hoping the bacon flavor would go into the chicken but the chicken itself lacked flavor.  I roasted the chicken on a bed of baby carrots and potatoes and they turned out wonderful.  I might make this again but I will definitely use a disposable pan...the mess it creates isn't worth the result, unfortunately.  At least the chicken was moist!

I must have done something wrong because despite all the butter, my skin came off when I tried to remove the bacon.  I guess I should spray the chicken with non-stick spray.  I am not happy!!

Very good moist chicken.  I put the bacon on like lattice across the whole chicken (like in one of the pictures posted) and there was no need for the toothpicks.  I added the bacon to smashed cauliflower for a side dish.  It takes a lot longer than 15 minutes to brown the skin when you take the bacon off though.

It does make a difference on the stuffing. Try diced apple and sweet onion and see what your nose and taste buds think! The onion goes with the bacon and the apple with the chicken.  Flavors bleed into the meat. Yum. mccall208

Really moist chicken.I used as much bacon as needed to totally cover chicken. After cooking I also  used the bacon(chopped) as topping on Baked Potato that I serve with chicken.

We all loved this chicken!  It was very juicy and flavorful!  We did not use carrots though, we stuffed the inside with more bacon and it was great!

WHOA!  This is excellent!  The smell of chicken & bacon, roasted in beef broth is heavenly!  The taste as well.  It was very moist and the breast had really absorbed the bacon flavour which was very nice and very pleasing to our taste buds..YUM.  THX.

We have used bacon on our turkey for years. Once we take the bacon off to brown the skin, everyone eats the crispy bacon.  If you use a smokey bacon, the turkey or chicken will have a slighty smokey taste. Makes great gravy too.

I have also used the "bacon basting" on our Thanksgiving turkey....yum yum! Makes for a very moist bird.  This made our chicken just as tasty and moist.  Thanks for sharing!

Excellent -tasty & moist! I filled the cavity w/ baby carrots & limes but otherwise followed the recipe as listed. The meat fell off the bones! Next time I will try a citrus juice blend w/ soy sauce instead of the beef broth just for something different or maybe a chipotle raspberry sauce. This is an excellent starting point for a delicious roast chicken.

Not at all what I was expecting.  It smelled so good while it was cooking, but I found the chicken to be greasy overall and it left a greasy taste in my mouth.  My family wasn't so fond of it either - which is odd, since they love chicken and bacon.   The only change I made was to use chicken broth instead of beef broth.    That could have affected the grease factor, possibly.  I will not make this again.

This just didn't work out for us.  The bacon added nothing to the flavor of the chicken (although it was yummy right out of the oven).  It was just a lot of extra work for no real return.

I used the beef broth and didn't like the way the chicken tasted because of that.  It was still really good but the beef broth did give it a distinct taste my buds didn't like.  Next time I will try chicken or veggie broth.  The chicken was nice and juicy and the bacon really helped.  I would make this again.

Taste is good, but I'm not sure that the bacon added too much.  Maybe you need to use fattier bacon, but ours just crisped right up and didn't seem to do much basting.  I may try this again once we are back in the US with the fattier bacon--until then, it won't be in our rotation.

Wow. This recipe was so different from what I usually make but my family loves bacon. I followed the recipe for the most part but added garlic under the skin and inside the cavity as well as onions. I used a 5 pound chicken and had to cook it for at least 2o minutes longer. It was juicy and had a smoked flavor that my husband and boys loved. The gravy was so unexpectedly good. It's rich and I will consider making something like it for a breakfast gravy. Next time I think I will put bacon in the cavity as well to give the chicken an overall smoked bacon flavor.

I loved this recipe.  I'm am very new to cooking.  Before I made this, I had never roasted anything or even cooking a whole chicken.  The recipe was easy to follow and the chicken was delicious.  I took pictures of the chicken throughout the process and shared them on Facebook.  My friends were very impressed.

sorry, but I didn't find anything particularly spectacular about this chicken. The basic "beer can" chicken is just as good . . . you can always throw a couple strips of bacon on top of the beer can chicken as it cooks, because really that's the only thing different about this recipe.

This was good and my fiance and I liked it a lot- the meat was moist and juicy, but I was disappointed as the skin didn't crisp up like I like it to- it was moist and chewy. Next time I will try to leave it in the oven for longer to crisp up the skin, then it would be 5 stars for us.

This was good but not 5 star. Broth had quite a bit of grease in it and was just not as flavorable as I expected.  It did smell fabulous and browned beautifully.  Mine took about 10 minutes longer to cook than called for.

This chicken turned out very succulent and flavorful. I thought the constant basting would be  a hassle, but it wasn't that bad and the end result was nothing short of juicy amazingness. I forgot to add the butter, but it still turned out great. I also added a splash of white wine (about half a cup) and 1 tsp of minced garlic in the broth and it gave the gravy deeper, richer flavor. I also stuffed the chicken with a whole peeled onion (no carrots). This will be one of my go-to roast chicken recipes from now on. Simply fantastic!! (it's also very Atkins friendly)

very tender and delicious. i would make again.  i didn't use the bacon, just tossed it when chicken was done cooking.  i stuffed the cavity with onion, garlic, red pepper and celery.  what i had left over i just put in the pan around the chicken.  i strained the juice when the chicken was done and added a little butter/corn starch paste to make gravy.  i covered the chicken with foil while i made the gravy to let it rest.  very good would make again.

What a fantastic recipe! The only item I added was Old Bay seasoning which I covered the entire chicken with. Also I feel asleep while cooking the bird and accidently cooked it for an hour too ling and the chicken was still juicy!! Will have this as a regular plus with the economy what a great way to save money by buying a whole chicken!

The most tender and moist and overall delicious chicken I've ever made.  I cooked it uncovered as the instructions were not clear on whether to cover or not.  I covered the entire visible portion of chicken in bacon.  Some changes I made: I used 1 cup chicken broth instead of the beef.  I also stuffed the chicken with apples and onion instead of carrots.  Lastly, I seasoned it with Clubhouse Chicken rub.  
I used some of the chicken broth in the gravy.

I made this recipe using chicken leg quarters.  I used all the same seasonings, and arranged a slice of bacon on each one.  They were beautifully roasted in about 90 minutes, and fall-off-the-bone tender and delicious.  I crumbled the perfectly toasted bacon slices into my mashed potato side dish.  I'll definitely be using this one again!

Don't waste the bacon.  Just select one of the dozens of good recipes for roasting chicken and use it.

This recipe was pretty tasty!  I added diced apples and carrots to the cavity which added a little sweet flavor to the meat.  The bacon was super yummy. We love bacon in our family so I wrapped the whole bird in it (aside from the underside).  Kept the chicken very moist.  We added our own rub to the outside of the bird.  Was surprised that more bacon flavor didn't absorb into the bird.  It was a great roasted chicken, but I expected a little more bacon flavor.  Will still fix again!

This was a beautiful bird!  It came out very moist, even the breasts, which I normally hate because they are so dry.  The bacon was awesome.  I did recipe as is, except used the garlic and herb seasoning blend, smoked bacon, and added cut up onion.  Better than any store bought rotisserie.

This was an amazing recipe. The bacon not only kept the chicken quite moist, but also gave the chicken a bit of flavor. I didn't stuff my chicken with anything, nor did I use the paprika or beef broth - which is why this is getting four stars instead of five, because those are not items that would go over well. I used garlic on the chicken and used cooking wine and water in the pan. Delicious!

Who doesn't like Bacon?  I was able to make a great gravy from the drippings.  Only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars was the cooking time.  For my bird it took a lot longer then what is listed and I did everything the recipe stated to do.

This is the best roasted chicken ever!! The bacon gives it a wonderful flavor and the bacon itself is very crispy and tasty. I'm using this as my new dish to take when someone is surgery or a baby. Great for leftovers too!

My family LOVED this recipe.  I like to incorporate one new recipe into the rotation every week, and my kids are young, so doing this sometimes it does not go over so well.  However, once they tasted the bacon they just kept telling me...can you make this all the time.  I followed the directions nearly exact.  I put 1 cut up onion, 2 carrots, and 2 garlic gloves in the cavity.  I based the chicken every 20 minutes.  The only thing I would do differently is that at halfway point of the cooking process, I would have turned the bacon over and seasoned that side with paprika.  My kids like bacon a bit on the crunchier side instead of chewy.  This bacon was crunchy on one and chewy on the other.  The chicken was so moist, even my husband commented on it.  Definitely will work into regular meal rotation.  (Because I am a health nut, next time I might try turkey bacon).

This was a perfect Sunday dinner! My chicken usually turns out moist but this was really moist! I made this as written. The only thing different was my chicken was almost 6 lbs so cooking time was a good 1/2 hour more. Adding some flour to the pan also made some great gravy for mashed potatoes. Thanks for your recipe RioChick!

This was good but have done this before with the t-day turkey. I changed so much I shouldn't be rating this. Used most of the ingredients for the roasted sticky rotiessierie  (sp?) chicken from this site. Bacon does moist it up, no doubt. Onions and carrots in the cavity.

DELICIOUS!! Nice recipe. My first time cooking a "whole" bird. Used chicken stock instead of beef stock, and stuffed the chicken with a cut up onion and some garlic cloves. My chicken was about 5 1/2 lbs, so it took about 2 hours to cook. Came out nice and tender! Loved it. I didnt taste much bacon in the finished product though.  I used the drippings in the pan to make a nice gravy to go with some mashed potatoes. Yummy to my tummy!!!

Pretty good recipe.  Overall I thought there was too much grease, but that could have been the type of bacon I used.  It was alright, not one I'm going to make again anytime soon, but certainly not bad.

We love this, but more butter is better.  Also stuffed bird with onions, celery, and carrots and scattered some around the bird.  Also tried it with both beef and chicken broth and the beef broth method is actually better!

Oh my goodness!  Where has this recipe been all my life?  This is the best recipe for tender and juicy chicken I have ever run across.  I stuffed the cavity with onion instead of carrots and I used my favorite Cavender's Greek seasoning on the bird.  The meat was so tasty and juicy, especially the breast which tends to dry out.  I made it for Sunday dinner and used the leftovers on Tuesday night for enchiladas.  Delicious!  I don't think I'll ever roast a chicken (or turkey!) without bacon again.

this is a great way to make your thanksgiving turkey. 
  i make it with the bacon on top .
  but i use thick bacon on my turkey. 
i stuff it with an apple cut in quarters and onion cut the same and a stock of celery .
  weather permitting i put it into a large foil pan  put on a large cookie sheet   and cook it on the grill . or you can also put into the oven.
   cook it by the chart on the turkey wrapper .
   oh i forgot to tell you to rub turkey with sage or poltry seasoning and put some inside the cavity. 
  i make stuffing on the side
          ITS A WINNER

Great idea!!!  I rubbed extra butter under the skin of the breast and stuffed garlic, preserved lemon and rosemary under the skin as well.  Didn't use the carrots.  The flavor was incredible and the breast meat was extremely juicy and flavorful.  Will most definitely use this technique again many times!

This chicken was very good, but wasn't as tender I thought it would be. Maybe I needed to cook it a little longer? It was still very good and looked good also!

This is exactly how my Nonna taught me to make our Thanksgiving turkey!  I have used the method for chicken for years and the entire family fights over the bacon.  Once in awhile a cholesterol nightmare is ok...  I also added onion and citrus in the cavity.  Good recipe, easy to follow and a sure winner.

I usually stuff the cavity with apples and onions, but the bacon on top is the best. It gives it a subtle smokey flavor and crisps up the skin nicely.

Combined this with the sticky rotisserie chicken recipe. Used the seasoning mix for that recipe, stuffed with onion and garlic instead of carrots. Covered with strips of bacon and added 2 cups chicken stock to the pan. Best chicken I've ever made. The gravy was fabulous.

Wonderfully tender chicken. I used chicken broth and pineapple instead of beef and carrots. It took longer to cook. It got a thumbs up from my husband who doesn't really care for chicken. I would do this over a normal roasted chicken any day.

This was very good-not too greasy.  I forgot to rub with butter before applying the bacon.  When I removed the bacon, I rubbed with butter to let it brown.  Everyone enjoyed it.  The breast meat was very juicy!

Amazing recipe. It was delicious. The chicken was moist and flavorful. The bacon added quite a flavor. I stuffed the chicken with carrots, onion, rosemary, and garlic. I was highly impressed with the recipe, and it was easy to prepare.

I guess it depends on what your used to... I followed the directions exactly as written and this had no flavor at all. Very juicy but we're used to marinating most of our meat before cooking it and this was just very bland and needed lots of salt to give it some taste.

Love this recipe!! The chicken was perfect, very juicy and flavorful.   Added tip:  Boil the leftover chicken bones to make a stock.   Makes a delicious base for homemade chicken soup!

The All-Recipes community was right.  This is a great recipe. I stuffed the cavity with onion and garlic. Used beef broth. Loved the flavor of the chicken and the drippings. Definite keeper.

This was easy and the chicken was very moist. Don't expect the chicken to taste like bacon, but it does add a suble flavour.

Very nice recipe I have made it several times from scratch.  However, as a shortcut sometimes I will pick up a fresh rotisserie chicken the day before I want to prepare this meal.  I refrigerate the chicken overnight and follow the steps in the recipe with the broth and bacon.  I cover the chicken with foil and bake for 30 minutes at 350.  I then increase temp to 425 and crisp the bacon on top.  I serve my chicken with the bacon and everyone loves the flavor.

I made this recipe last night for my very picky 3 (my husband and my 2 boys age 11 & 13).  I had some simple complaints.  First of all, I really could not rub the butter on the chicken because the chicken was too cold.  Even after I softened the butter a bit it just clumped together once it hit the cold chicken.  My second complaint is that the cook time was longer than the recipe claimed.  The only thing that I did differently was I put some brown suger in with the broth which gave the chicken and bacon a sweeter glaze.  All of this said....my picky 3 gobbled it up.  When I served it to them I said I probably won't make this again but after he finished eating it my husband told me I had better make it again.  They all LOVED IT.  So.....I will call this one a keeper!  Thank you so much!  Usually when I try a new recipe I'm the only one that will eat it because the other ones are too picky.  This chicken is very flavorful and juicy...not dry at all!

This dish had no bacon flavor at all.   I was so disappointed in the recipe.  The JUICY ROASTED CHICKEN recipe by Robinrockingbird on your site is so much better, easier, and more flavorful  with only about 4 ingredients.

OMG this chicken was so moist and delicious!!! my family loved it we ate the whole thing  and it was only my husband and I and my 3 yrs old couldnt get enough of it! did season the bird to my taste before adding the bacon to give it more flavor, and instead of carrots i did the onions and peppers also replaced the beef broth with chicken broth and some orange juice.

AMAZING!  My boyfriend loves this!  I usually double the beef broth so that I can make extra gravy because I am a gravy fiend.  Be sure to baste this as the recipe calls for - if you don't the chicken won't be as moist and tender.  Also, I recommend using maple flavored bacon and be sure to fully wrap the chicken in it - don't be stingy!

The meat was very moist and tender.  Browned beautifully.  Not a lot of flavor. The bacon and be cut up and used with green beans and potatoes. Yummy!!

I used this recipe as is. However, I used a pampered chef dutch oven. My chicken came out so tender, juicy, and flavorful! This recipe is definitely a keeper!!

This was a winner! Flavorful (after adding some onions and garlic to the carrots), moist (even though I forgot to turn the heat down after the first 15 minute mark) and my husband approved as well. I didn't want to waste the bacon so I added it to the rice I made and that added to the flavor of everything. I will be making this again!

This was quite good.  I missed the brown skin on top of the chicken - didn't look great but still tasted fine.  I think I might try adding onions and/or garlic next time.

VERY GOOD! I marinated the chicken with all the ingredients for 24 hours before baking it. I rubbed the chicken with a tsp. of paprika, I ran out of onions to put inside the cavity, so i just used onion powder and added some garlic powder. the next day i placed the bacon strips on top of the chicken and put 2 cups of beef broth as it is called for in the recipe, i  know some people used chicken broth instead of beef broth but i think the taste of this roasted chicken relies on the beef broth and the smoky flavor of paprika and bacon. (specifically used smoked bacon for this recipe) I'll definitely make this again. Baked it for 1 hour and 15 minutes then took out the bacon and added 20 minutes more baking time to brown the top of the chicken and make it slightly crispy. Hope this review helps.

Very moist and tender.  The only things I changed was to use chicken stock and add about 1 TBS of minced garlic to the stock.

This was the juiciest chicken I have ever made!  I make whole roast chickens quite often but this was the first time I've tried this recipe.  I did pour chicken stock on the bottom of the pan after the rapid cook.  It made a great pan gravy!

This was the best bake chicken I have ever made so moist and juicy, I sub the carrots for onions, sub the beef broth for chicken broth, and use the Weber beer can chicken season. The family loved the bacon I will make this again real soon.

I do not know what happened. I was expecting a very moist chicken with a bacon/smoky flavor. I did everything exactly as the recipe stated and changed nothing. But my chicken came out slightly raw and needed another 20 minutes in the oven. I sliced some breast meat off and put it in the microwave as we were starving. While it was still moist it had none of the bacony flavor I was hoping for. I made this on the last night of our visit with my Uncle before we were to come home. We were all disappointed. I'm so sorry but this recipe just was not for us. Thank you for posting though

I made this last night and it was nothing special.  I followed the recipe to the letter and nobody really liked it.  We expected the chicken to have some bacon flavor infused into it but there was none.  Also, what's the use of all that broth?  Two cups of broth seems excessive.

The idea of this recipe was great, but it fell short in flavour and we didn't feel it was as good as some other chicken recipes we've made from here. Sole changes were to use turkey bacon and "All-Around Spice Rub" instead of just paprika. Our bird was close to 5 lbs. but it seemed to require much extra cooking time, and the juices evaporated and left a charred mess at the bottom of my pan. Won't make again.

Great recipe!!  I did make a couple of changes though.  I used chicken broth instead of beef.  I also stuffed the chicken with onion and garlic as well as the carrots.  And I used both thyme and rosemary to season.  My whole family loved it!

This smelled great while in the oven, but when it came out all the flavor was only in the skin.  This one is a "so-so" recipe for me. I won't cook it again.

Delicious!  My husband LOVED it.  The only thing I did differently was that I added fresh rosemary and I used chicken broth instead of beef broth.  The bacon was wonderful.  Oh, I forgot to put the butter on the chicken and it was still very moist.

Very easy and tasty.  I used season salt, onion powder (because i had no onions), and sage for the spice rub.  I only had celery for the inner cavity.  I think that this will be much better with more veggies inside and I will be more aggressive with the seasoning next time.  The good thing is that I have some moist tasty chicken for recipes later this week.

We like chicken breasts, so even tho this was more fat than we usually allow in a meal, I used a relatively shallow roasting pan, filled it with beef broth, threw in baby carrots, unpeeled green apple slices and a few cloves of garlic.  I placed the breasts, skin on, rubbed with butter, salt, pepper, thyme and paprika, on a Pam sprayed rack above the liquid.  (Adding bacon on top of butter would really have put us over the top.)  I baked the chicken in a slow oven (325 degrees) for about one and a half hours.  The chicken was nicely browned and wonderfully juicy.  What was left of the broth, plus the carrots, apple and garlic,  I put into the food processor, added a touch of Kitchen Bouquet for coloring, and made a kind of gravy.  It was a surprisingly good dish!  Thank you RioChick!

We loved this chicken. It was very moist.  The bacon was YuMmY, and not burnt.  I stuffed with onions, but discarded when finished.  I rubbed with butte, sprinkled with 1 pkt of dry leek soup, rosemary and thyme, then wrapped in bacon.  I poured about 1 cup of chicken broth in the bottom.  I took the bacon off the top the last 15 minutes, and BROILED for a wonderful golden brown skin.  I made gravy out of the drippings.  Probably the best gravy I've ever had. Thank you.

Fantastic!  So juicy and flavorful!  And easy too!  I've also heard of a similar recipe using little cocktail weiners instead of the bacon, haven't tried yet though because the bacon is so good!  Thanks for a new recipe to go in our rotation!

Moist and delicious!  My husband loved it.  I cooked the chicken in a ceramic "beer can chicken" bowl.  Worked great!  I didn't even baste it.

This is seriously the best roasted chicken I have EVER tasted, let alone made! The bacon keeps the chicken completely moist and flavorful. I used a roasting pan, the chicken elevated on a rack so the juices kept evaporating in the pan. I added chicken broth as I went along to ensure I had droppings. Also, instead of stuffing with carrots (yuck) I stuffed it with 2 lemons sliced in half. It added some delicious brightness to the flavor. I will certainly be making this again and have already recommended this recipe to others - And i JUST made it last night! :)

chicken turned out to dry for my liking and I didn't like having to baste every 15 minutes to time consuming for me. Will stick with my normal baked chicken next time.

This turned out great! i forgot to buy beef broth so used a can of chicken broth and it was wonderful.  Also the thick bacon was really expensive so I bought the cheap stuff and layered them like a checkered board. Was wonderful!!!!! Thanks. my first ever roasted chicken turned out to be a hit!

I made this and I thought it was just OK. The BF doesn't care for Chix, but loved this because it was so moist, and would like to have this again. For all the trouble it took to prepare, I'd rather just throw the chix in the oven to roast the regular way (it still comes out moist that way too!)

So good, so easy and so pretty!  I took some of the other reviewers suggestions and also added a 1/2 chopped onion and a lime cut into wedges into the cavity.  Very juicy.  Used the beef broth which would have made a good gravy for mashed potatoes.

This was quite good. I added chopped onions and garlic cloves to the cavity of the chicken. I used mini carrots instead of chopped large ones. I also added white wine to the beef broth, and I basted every ten minutes. The chicken was quite juicy and I was quite happy with the flavour. I used the drippings in a gravy, and it was filled with oniony, bacony goodness. I WILL make this again!!!!!

Bacon and anything=great meal! I've done a turkey wrapped in bacon and silly me never thought to try it with a chicken. This turned out great, very moist and tender. I rubbed the butter under the skin and only used half as much broth turned out Great! Will definately make this again and again!!

I had a 5 lb. chicken, which took 2 hours, 40 minutes. The beef broth made no sense to me, so used chicken broth. I stuffed it with onion and garlic, poked it a few times, then covered it with the bacon. That was one beautiful bird that came out of the oven! Very impressive, very moist, but I was just hoping for a little more flavor. I think next time I will add more seasonings, wrap it up tightly and let sit in the fridge overnight before baking it - maybe by "marinating" it, more flavor will burst through.  Still, very very good and will certainly enjoy the leftovers!

I usually brine my chickens first (leave it sitting in salt water for 1-6 hours. Doing this recipe on top of it made the chicken actually seem a little undercooked because it was SO juicy! The temperature was right, supposedly it was fully cooked, but it was abnormally juicy. And the salt from the bacon added some nice flavour. I will try this again.

I had a large whole bone in chicken breast instead of a whole chicken.  Followed the recipe just layered the veggies in the pan. Used onion, 2 whole cloves of garlic and carrots and popped the prepared breast on top. I used ckn broth because I had a container open. Baked about 20 minutes and then turned the oven down. Finished in about 20 more.  It was great. The meat stayed juicy. The bacon was a little appetizer while waiting for the chick to finish. We both loved it.  Thank you

I made this yesterday and my family totally enjoyed it!  Especially, since my husband can take or leave chicken, stated that I MUST make this again!  It was extremely juicy.  I did alter it a bit and added some onion in the cavity and also pur on some rosemary and marjoram.  The bacon was delish!  Thanx for putting this on here!

Ok, this chicken was the bomb! Very moist and juicy. My family loved this, especially the bacon! The leftovers made a great chicken salad the next day. This will be a regular in my house. My hubby liked it better than his beer can chicken.

My whole family loved this, there is almost nothing left! My 11 year old daughter even ate 3 pieces and she rarely eats meat. It was just so juicy and tender, it was almost falling apart when I took it out of the oven. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Instead of putting vegetables in the cavity, take a can of beer, drink half and into the remaining beer, add 2 tablespoons melted butter and 2 garlic cloves. Stand the beer can up in a baking pan and set the chicken over it. Bake as directed. Your chicken will be moister than you've ever imagined and the bacon tastes great, as well.

This was delicious! I stuffed the bird with cut up oranges and onions; used chicken stock, orange juice, and balsamic vinegar like one of the reviewers said and it was very moist and delicious. The Juices made an excellent sauce.

The chicken smelled amazing while it was cooking! To my disappointment, it didn't taste nearly as good as it smelled - very bland. Surprising, because I added lots of seasoning and flavor, and I stuffed the cavity with onion and celery. I even removed the bacon after it crisped up, so the chicken skin would crisp, but the meat just didn't seem to absorb any flavor from the bacon. All the bacon seemed to do was make the chicken greasy, sorry.

Been wanting to try this recipe for awhile, so did so tonight - I followed it as-is except that I used 1C chicken stock + 1/3C orange juice + 1/3C balsamic vinegar.  The chicken was good, not spectacular...I think I've made better with less effort and less clean-up involved.  Like others, the bacon didn't seem to impart much flavor (thick cut w/plenty of fat), likewise, it didn't necessarily cause the breast meat to be any juicier than I've produced using standard roasting methods (such as tenting in foil and browning under the broiler).

What a beautifully moist chicken.  I've never tried it with bacon on top.  I did change one thing only.  I used veggie broth instead of beef broth and it turned out wonderfully.  I would DEFINITELY recommend this recipe again and again and again!!!!!!!!!!!! YUM YUM!!!

This was pretty good. I usually stick to eating the dark meat as it is usually the moist part, but the breast was juicy. Will probably make again.

i did not add the beef stock; i did add about 1 1/2 cups of water and basted with that, but next time i would add the 2 cups, maybe of chicken or vegetable broth. i also added a bit of poultry seasoning to the chicken. this took a LOT longer than 1 hour and 15 minutes to cook -- almost twice as long. i know my oven is old and all but still ... even so, everyone liked it. it was relatively easy. i think i'd do this again, but allow for more cooking time, and experiment with different seasoning.

The bacon didnt add much, only grease. I think it might taste better using some italian ham or canadian bacon. But all in all it wasn't too bad.

This recipe is not good if you want left overs, especially the bacon. It is excellent, and whole chicken is much more economical. Great gravy making dish.

Gave a very nice flavour to the chicken. I only used four strips of bacon and subbed chicken broth for the beef broth. I would definitely make this again.

I added some onion and garlic in the cavity with the carrots, otherwise followed the directions as is.  I wound up cooking mine a little longer after I took the bacon off because it was a little bigger than the recommended 4lb bird and took longer to get up to temp.  My husband took the pan drippings and made gravy with it, it was delicious.

Made this last night with chicken legs, back attached - was what I had.  Placed them (2) over a bed of carrots, celery and onions and spiced them with S+P, thyme and poultry seasonings.  Pierced the skin in a lot of places and basted with veg oil instead of butter.  Placed bacon strips all over to cover - baked them for an hour, took off the bacon and baked for another 45 mins, basting once.  The bacon and the chicken were delicious!  Will definitely make again.

This was really good and very moist, my chicken was almost 5 pounds so I cooked it 2 hours basting every 30 minutes I didn't remove the bacon until carving. I let it rest covered with parchment paper ten minutes before carving and served the bacon slices on the platter with the cut up chicken. My husband wasn't impressed with the look of the bacon on the chicken when it was baking but after I carved it he couldn't get away from it:)

I combined this recipe with the Juicy Roasted Chicken recipe, and stuffed an apple and onion inside with just water in the pan. Amazing. I was planning on what to do the next day with the leftovers, only there were none. Was too juicy and tasty to stop easting.

This recipe is excellent. Though I used my leftover bacon fat from that morning rather than pinning on bacon slices, I think it has the same effect. Very moist and delicious!

Very easy, tasty & moist!  I added some of the carrots as well as onion and potatos to bottom of the roaster and they turned out great too, will definitely make again!

I used this recipe and didn't like it at all.  It was bland even with all that bacon on it.  I will not be using this recipe again.

Great recipe, used lemon and onion with the carrots per other reviewers. Used about a tsp of honey with the butter as well. Next time I will put the thyme (and maybe rosemary also) in the melted butter so it sticks. Bacon was excellent and using a digital thermometer to 180 was perfect. Also used the digital as the timer, which is very important given the temperature change.  Made gravy with the drippings using about a tbsp of flour. Even picky kid2 liked it.  Winner winner chicken dinner. Thank you, RioChick!

This was the best chicken I ever made. I broiled right at the end to get it nice and dark. It was so juicy and delicious and super easy. My husband's friend who is a chef said it was the best chicken he'd had in a long time.

Granted the chicken was tender, but it came out tasting like bacon.  Maybe it was the brand of bacon that I used, but this recipe was not for me.

My roomates and I love this recipe. We also used chicken stock in place of beef broth.  I also make a homemade garlic herb butter and stuff the chicken before dry rubbing the outside and attaching the bacon! This recipe is delicious! Dont be scared of 450... it makes the differance in this recipe =)

Delicious! I stuffed my chicken with carrots, celery, onion and smashed garlic. I used a mix of beef and chicken broth (didn't have enough beef broth). The bacon was a nice snack while waiting for the chicken to finish browning, and the gravy made from the drippings was to die for! I also added some of the leftover bacon to our mashed potatoes, what a great suggestion from previous reviewers. I think this added a great flavor the roast chicken, and can't wait to try it with turkey, thanks!

The chicken stayed very moist and the taste was good after adding a little Tony Chachere. The bacon turned a little strange and we didn't eat it, but it didn't effect the chicken.

OK this was so yummy. Before serving I took the bacon and crumbled it over the chicken.  My family loves this chicken.  I will be making this again.   Thanks for the recipe.

My first roasted chicken - it was great.  I didn't use any broth because I didn't want soggy wings, and it was still very good.  I used some onion along with the carrot in the cavity.  I will definitely make this again - with a newborn at home, I don't have time to baste chicken endlessly, so having the bacon do all the work was brilliant.

This is a very good roasted chicken recipe.  I wish the chicken would take on more of the bacon flavor.  I took another reviewers suggestion and pierced the chick all over with a skewer before adding the bacon.  I don't think it made much difference.  Instead of the carrots I used 1/2 an onion.  We enjoyed!

Wasn't wowwed by this but it was pretty good.  I can't believe there wasn't more bacon flavor in the chicken.  Cooked a 5 1/2 lb chicken in 2 hours total.  Cooked perfect.

Make sure no bacon drips down onto the oven floor (great test for the smoke detecots!).  It is very hard to move the roasting pan with chicken and liquid in it. Great dish....

All the preparation didn't seem to make a difference in the flavor of the chicken.

Thank you, this was crowd pleaser for sure!  The meat almost fell of the bones, infact some of it did as I lifted it out of the pan. I did add some fresh rosemary, garlic and a couple of other spices.  Also, I tented the chicken in tin foil so it soaked up the beef broth instead of just letting it evaporate and it was a wonderful meal! TRY THIS ONE FOR SURE!

This was really good. I did use chicken broth instead of beef cause that's all I had on hand. I may try beef broth next time though.

I always seem to cook dry chicken.  This was FABULOUS!  I didn't use as much bacon (2 strips) and used chicken broth.  THIS IS A FOOL PROOF recipe!  I swear!

The bacon kept the chicken very moist, but it had a definate bacon flavor.  Which was fine with us, hubby loves bacon!

Very good recipe.  The chicken was flavorful and vers moist.  I did season to my liking some--I added garlic, onion, salt and placed an onion inside.  Just a personal choice.

SO delicious.  Even my 2 year old loved it and my husband is always asking me to make it.  So simple to make.  I used chicken broth instead of beef and added some onion and garlic cloves along with the carrots.  I will be making this again and again!

This was phenomenal! I used 1 can of chicken broth and added water as I basted - Basil instead of thyme and put potatoes around the bird. The potatoes were fantastic! They had perfect flavor and the chicken was juicy and succulent! I'll be adding this to the weekly rotation for sure!

Not really worth the time and effort for me. I stuffed the chicken with carrots, onion, lemon, and fresh garlic- otherwise followed the recipe as is. The bacon was OK. The chicken was tender and flavorful but it didn't WOW me. Probably won't make again. I've had rotisserie chicken from the store just as good!

Absolutely the best! I stuffed it with garlic, and some ready to toss carrots and onion(Good way to use leftover veggies!)
Then I topped it with an applewood smoked bacon. it really gave the chicken great flavor. This bacon is always gone before the main course.

Not all that great.  The meat really didn't have much flavor, its like it all got trapped in the skin.  I will say that the bacon was phenomenal though!

I really enjoyed this recipe, I thought it was strange to add the beef stock but I cant explain how good this came out. I also liked how easy it was too cook. The first time I made it tho I accidentally left it in for longer than recommended and it still was very juicy and flavorful.Thanks so Much

Overall, this was a good recipe. I took the others advice, and stuffed it with an onion, and used chicken broth instead of beef. The only thing I had trouble with, was the bacon became too crispy...pretty much burned. Next time, I'll use thick sliced bacon and remove it earlier if necessary.

All I can say is wow!! I've had bacon wrapped filet, bacon wrapped shrimp and even bacon wrapped hot dogs(they were wonderful) but this one is awesome. The bacon imparts flavor and keeps the chickem moist. You gotta try it!!

I didn't get to try this, I put it in the oven before leaving for a meeting and came home to the carcass being picked clean.  Clearly a hit with my hubby and three kids! SO easy, will definitely make again!  I bet it smelled good while cooking too :)

I did as others suggested and added a chunked up onion to the inside of my bird, as well as a couple small pads of butter under the skin.  Near the end of the cook time, I also glazed the chicken with a carribean jerk sauce I had on-hand, and the taste was excellent.  The bacon really enhanced the flavor of this chicken, and I appreciate the recipe!  Thanks!

The chicken was very moist. The bacon didn't do much for the flavor, though. But on its own, they bacon was good. (The left over chicken made an excellent soup!)

I'd give it 3.5 if I could but it is not worth a 4. I don't know....just didn't do it for my family.
