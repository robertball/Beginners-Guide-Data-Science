This snack mix was okay but not phenomenal. It vaguely tasted of banana bread and that flavor came solely from the Banana Nut Cheerios which, I must add, were extremely hard for me to find in my town. I went to four different grocery stores trying to find it! I won't make this particular one again but haven't ruled out other Chex mixes.
