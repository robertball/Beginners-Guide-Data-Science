I tried the recipe a couple different ways. I enjoyed it the most with half the eggs and double the milk. To each their own :)

Mixed review. The batter mixed easily, but was very thick and needed much milk. The pancakes baked just like non-keto pancakes, but when it came to flipping the pancake, it didn't flip well due to not baking inside. 

I don't like textures like cornmeal or oatmeal, and if you use superfine almond flour.

The flavor and smell is wonderful.
