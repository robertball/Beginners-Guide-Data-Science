A local pizza place makes a sauceless feta cheese pizza sort of like this, and I love it, so I thought I'd give it a try with this recipe as a starting point. I did most of the recipe as written, but added fresh baby spinach leaves and some artichoke hearts. It was delicious. You have to be aware that there is no sauce/gooey cheese to hold it all together and eat it more carefully, but it's a tiny inconvience compared to the yummy taste. Some other toppings I'm considering for next time are marinated mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes, and different kinds of olives. Crispy crumbled bacon would also be good on this!

This was great!  I made it for my mom and I and we LOVED it!  I did however do 3 things differently.  First I didn't have any red pepper flakes on hand, so I didn't use those.  Secondly, I sliced a small tomato and used it as a topping.  lastly I put a little bit (about 3-4 tbl) pizza sauce.
We loved it and will definatly make it again!

If you spread a thin layer of hummus before adding the veggies, it helps a lot. Plus you can try all the different flavors of hummus!

Very yummy! I spread some Pesto on the crust before putting the rest of the toppings on. Made for a really tasty dinner :)

Pretty tasty, but annoying to eat-everything falls right off the crust. We added some turkey bacon to add a little more flavor and next time I think we will use a light coat of barbeque sauce to hold everything on.

The feta in this is an awesome choice.  Complements the peppers and onions beautifully.  Added some diced tomatoes to it as well, which was a nice touch, too.

Delicious!  I made it with a tortilla instead of pizza dough (and pre-heated the tortilla for 3-4 minutes).  I didn't have any problems with my slices falling apart.  I also used sun-dried pesto as the base sauce.  It was a healthy and satisfying meal.  Will try this recipe again!!

This was soooo good!  I did add about 1/2 cup of ranch dressing as a "sauce".  Thought maybe it would be too dry without.  Other than that, followed to the T.  Thanks!!

Yummy! I'll never need to go to the pizzeria again. I only added about three cups of vegetables total (red,yellow,green and orange bell peppers, red onion, torn up baby spinach, and lots of garlic). I sauteed all of it beforehand with olive oil, garlic salt and fresh ground pepper. I rubbed olive oil on the dough, sprinkled with italian seasoning, garlic salt, and basil. Added sun dried tomatoes, kalamata olives and chopped fresh tomatoes. Was sooooooooo good.

I really liked this pizza, although the red pepper flakes made it lip-burning spicy.  I might omit those in the future.  My husband didn't like it though :(  I was kinda shocked!  He always likes what I cook!

I changed up the toppings (smoked ham, sun-dried tomatoes, mushrooms), but kept the marinade.  I also made a homemade crust and homemade pesto on top of the crust.  It was amazing.

I loved this and I will make this again. I made some minor changes like using chipotle mango seasoning bc i didn't have any crushed red pepper flakes. I added zucchini and mushrooms and used a 1/2 cup of Mozzarella cheese to hold it together. I only wish my dough turned out better

This flavor combination was delicious. I followed some other reviews and sauteed the vegetables for a while, added baby spinach leaves, and then baked the pizza for a little less time. The veggies did fall off a bit while eating, but it was still great.

This is a good starting point but it's better if you add something to spice it up.  There are lots of good ideas in the other reviews.  I also added a little mozzarella just to hold everything together.  Also, I think it would be better to chop the onions rather than slice.

My hubby and I loved this pizza! I made my crust from scratch, prebaked it, and sauteed the veggies in the olive oil with the italian seasonings, adding the salt and red pepper flakes at the end. I had no problem with the toppings staying on and the flavor was out of this world! Definately a keeper!

I followed the recipe and found the Italian herbs to be too much (especially with using herbed feta).  I made it again and left out the herbs, but used some ground cracked pepper and more red pepper flakes.  It was better without the Italian Herbs in my opinion.  I thought they overpowered the taste.  I also used Levash bread (a thinner, larger pita) and it was great!!

Great recipe!! I made it last night for my Bunco group and it was the first pizza(out of 3 different types made)to go. It did fall apart somewhat while serving and eating but was still worth the effort due  to the fantastic flavor. Maybe next time I will sprinkle a small  amount of mozzarella on top to hold everything together(very small amount as not to compete with the flavor of the Feta cheese).

I love this pizza. I had originally found this recipe in a newspaper and I have been making it for 3 years. You must really like bell pepper to like this pizza!!! Yellow and orange bell pepper is the best!

Used far less onion, and minced it, as we don't really like it on our pizza as much.  Also added green olives and some goat cheese.

Very yummy! I used banana peppers the first time I made this and then omitted them the second time and added roma tomato slices, sun dried tomatoes and did put a base of pizza sauce on these. I really love the feta cheese. I love these! Thanks for the post.

The reason I didn't like this is that the cheese never melted  This would be good with a different cheese.

I liked the concept of this recipe, but I agree with another when they added hummus to the pizza. I added red pepper hummus and it was wonderful. Also feta cheese dosnt melt, so I swapped it out for some fresh motzarella. My husband  and I eat this pizza often. The original recipe was a bit too dry

Made this last night and it was a big hit although I chopped my peppers into small pieces and, like another reviewer, I added about 3-4 tablespoons of pizza sauce. I also didn't use a Boboli but fresh pizza dough from the supermarket. Also, based on the picture I think I used about half the feta cheese. Super simple and tasty, like most pizza, haha.

This was very good but you've got to love garlic.  I tried sauteing the onions and garlic and bell pepper first and I liked that better.

My husband and I LOVED this!  I used the Pillsbury pizza crust, which allows you to assemble the entire pizza before you bake the crust, which  I think helped it all stick together.  (Others mentioned it all fell apart.)  Plus, I added a small handful (about 1/4 cup) of fine shredded cheese on top to help the toppings stick together.  I thought I'd miss having sauce on the pizza, but there s definitely enough flavors going on without it.  YUM!

Delicious!!!!  I had two small boboli crusts I needed to use up, and some feta - this recipe came up on my search and it was amazing. I mixed the feta in the bowl with all the other ingredients and it helped keep most of the toppings on... I couldnt wait for my husband to get home for this treat!

This is good! I added a little sauce, & a little cheese along with the feta. The seasonings make it so good so dont skimp on that.

Delicious! I added some chopped black olives which really added to it.  I did also use a base of a small amount of tomato sauce under the veggies on the pizza (about 2 tablespoons).  I will definitely make this again!  Very gourmet.
