The nut mix I used did have peanuts in it, but followed the recipe otherwise.  No need to ever buy trail mix again, it's just too easy to mix this up.  Very good!

I was looking forward to trying this recipe as my husband is a rare breed (in our circle),
who likes a trail mix. The only 1 he would eat I bought online. Not so cheap! This recipe
sounded like the one I buy, so I gave it a shot. I waited until the deluxe mix nuts in the
17.5 oz. can was on sale at CVS and saved about $5.00. And I bought milk chocolate M'M's
Because my husband likes them best. Easy and quick to mix, and saves me a lot of
money in the long run! Also you can alter the amounts a tad to your likeing.Thank-you so much FBGirl1.

I added some pretzels, and some chips into it because it looked kinda bland.

This is the best trail mix. I made it with adding 1 cup of dried cherries. Perfect blend.
