I didn't make the entire thing, I only made the cake part. I was a bit worried because there was no oil or butter but the cake part came out wonderful. It was real soft and spongy, and the flavor was good enough without the toppig or the cream. I made them into muffins, and people could really taste the flavor nuts without being over-powered by other flavors. :)

I served this for dessert last evening. Guests loved it and my husband has requested this be prepared as one of our Christmas dinner deserts.
