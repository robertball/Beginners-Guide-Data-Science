I'm not much of a fruit pie person, but DH loves them.  Part of what puts me off on them is the jell-like consistency of the filling.  But, I had a pint of strawberries in the 'fridge and some pie plant in the freezer, so when I found this recipe (sans jell) I made it.  Here are the mistakes I made so you can avoid them:  #1 - don't let your frozen rhubarb thaw, it throws off the amount.  I probably ended up using more like 8 cups instead of 4.  Fresh rhubarb would be the best, but frozen will work as long as you measure it frozen when it's more the size of fresh.  #2 - Don't use the strawberries you buy in March or early April.  They are more sour and don't have a very good flavor.  Or else adjust the amount of sugar you use to compensate for their sourness.  I am definitely going to make this pie again in another month with good, locally grown strawberries and my own fresh cut pie plant.  Thanks for the recipe Wilma!

As another reviewer said, it makes a LOT of filling, so I had two shells ready. This should be called a custard pie since there's no cream or milk involved. The eggs make a thick filling which sets up nicely. Also, be sure to keep the strawberry pieces relatively large; halve the smaller strawberries, cut the big ones into thirds. Cook at 400 for about 30 minutes and then reduce to 350 and cook another 15-20 minutes. Turn off oven and let the pie sit for 10-15 minutes. Let cool thoroughly before slicing. It'll cut cleanly. As another cook mentioned, don't put too much egg white or it'll brown too much. Comes out pretty! I reduced the nutmeg by half and added a dash of cinnamon. My husband scarfed it down.

This was strawberry rhubarb soup!  Can someone please tell me what I should have done differently, because I followed the directions exactly and ended up with a watery mess. This was even worse than the other strawberry-rhubarb pie I made from this site.

Excellent taste! Mine turned out really soupy, I served it about 10 minutes out of the oven, not sure if that is why. I have never tried this kind of pie before so I am not sure what I did wrong. Any suggestions?

This was quite the hit and it was easy!  I had never cooked with rhubard, so I wasn't sure what to expect.  FYI  watch the egg white you spread on the top of the pie.... if you spread too much it will brown to quickly.

Exellent recipe. I've searched for a pie recipe like this for a very long time. The texture is wonderful with the rhubarb and stawberries giving a sweet and sour taste with every bite. I used a store bought crust and then covered it half way through with aluminum foil to protect the crust from burning. I also used 1/2 sugar and 1/2 Splenda. Next time I will try with 100% Splenda. The pie came out perfect. Very easy and quick recipe to make. Perfect with French Vanilla ice cream!

this was VERY good. the only thing i would say is that the recipe makes way too much filling, and i had to throw some of it out. i also didnt even need to cook it 40 minutes at that temp instead of an hour. anyway it turned out excellent!

I am not usually a fan of strawberry rhubarb pie, but had a request to make one and chose this recipe.  Wow!  I love this pie.  I think it is the best pie I've ever had.  I didn't change a thing in the recipe.  Thanks, Wilma

I've been experimenting quite some time & this one is a keeper...was a little nervous about soupiness after reading reviews.  So after chopping both rhubard & strawberries, let them dry on paper towels for about 1/2 hr to "dry" out.  Not sure if this was the answer but it was fantastice & CREAMY!!!!

I think this was a great blend of rhubarb and strawberry.  I used Splenda Blend which halves the sugar.  I also used store bought crust and covered after half the time.  Finally I did what someone else suggested and baked at 400 for 30 minutes, 350 for 20 minutes and rest in the oven for 15 minutes.  DELISH - even warm I didn't have any consistency issues...

This pie was great!  I don't usually attempt to bake fruit pies, as I do not normally have much success with them.  They always come out soupy for me, it seems.  I was hoping that the egg and flour addition would keep this pie from suffering the same fate.  Success!  Because several other reviewers said they had too much filling, I decided to scale the filling back a bit.  I do not own a deep-dish pie plate.  In fact, I did not own a pie plate at all, and bought some of those cheap aluminum ones from the grocery store.  It worked just fine with my scaled back ingredients, which were as follows:  1 cup sugar, 3 tbsp flour, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 2 eggs + 1 egg yolk, 2 cups chopped fresh rhubarb, 2 cups halved fresh strawberries, 1 egg white, 1 double pie crust (I used the pre-made, unroll-and-bake pie crust).  I covered the edges of the crust with foil to keep them from burning and baked the pie for 40 minutes at 400. It came out perfectly.  My only complaint has nothing to do with the actual recipe.  The strawberries I used were pretty flavorless, since they're not in season.  I am going to make this pie again in the summer, when I can get local strawberries.

This pie is amazing!  When one of my friends had a peice she begged me to make one for her dad's birthday.  I would suggest using fresh fruit.  I've tried it with both, and frozen makes the pie too liquidy once thawed.

Very good pie. I'm not a huge fan on the nutmeg but that is the only thing I would change. Mine cooked perfectly and was not runny at all. I will make this again.

Perfect.  Used extra deep pie tin/crust.  Baked for for 30 mins at 400 & then 20 mins at 350 & then turned off oven and let it sit an extra 10 minutes.  Left it to cool out of oven for about 30 minutes before cutting & it was perfect.  Not too runny-just perfect.  Thanks for this recipe!!!!

This was a very easy and fun pie to make.  It did take a bit to prepare, but it was well worth it.  It was beautiful when it was done too.  My family loved it, and my in-laws want one for Christmas.  It is a thick pie and goes a long way.  Thank you so much!!!

I received lots of rhubarb and found this recipe to be outstanding.  I used the Baker's Secret Pie Crust on this site.  I didn't change a thing and had a DELICIOUS 9 inch pie that was gone in a day.
A definite keeper!

This tasted delicious however, I wasn't able to get a custard consistency. Perhaps there was too much water in the rhubarb and strawberries. I think I would make this again perhaps adding an egg or yolk to see if it was a bit creamier.

Excellent flavor and easy to make. For a slightly richer pie, include the extra yolk (left over from the white separation) in the mix.

This pie had a great flavor.  I didn't change anything and I loved it.  My daughter thought it was a little sweet so the next time I make it I may cut back on the sugar.

fantastic!superfast and easy.not overly sweet, the strawberry/rhubarb combo is so delicious.i used storebought crust,fresh rhubarb(which we have tons of right now)and just under 3 cups of strawberries -used a little less nutmeg(ca 1/2 tsp)and also added some cinnamon(ca 1/4 tsp).my husband and i couldnt wait till it cooled and had to have a piece(with whipped cream :))filling therefore was just a tad runny but did set up after cooling.A winner for sure!!!

What a great recipe!!! My mother, who has been making strawberry rhubarb pies for years, declared it the best one she's ever had!!  It was very easy and practically foolproof!  I used ready made pie crusts and made it even easier!!  I also used even amounts of the strawberry abd rhubarb.  Thanks for the keeper!

My boyfriend made this for us and I loved the tartness & sweetness combined together, it was nice and creamy we used a store bought crust which made it really flaky. I would next time use a handmade crust.

Excellent Pie! I also did 3/4 c. brown sugar and 3/4 c. white sugar. I never knew I liked rhubarb so much!

Consider using an alternative to egg, as egg is not a fruit.. Those whom had soupy pie, remember rhubarb and strawberries are full of water, so as they cook they will secrete juices.. for this I sprinkled a little corn starch over the ingredients to absorb some moisture, as well as vent holes in the top. The egg is used to bind.. I use whole pieces of rhubarb and strawberries, but instead of a pastry top, I make a lemon merange for the top. Turns out yum.. :D

This is wonderful.  Did not have enough strawberries, but just used the pound package on hand.  As others have pointed out, really does have to cool COMPLETELY in order to remain intact when cut.  Did not use the egg wash and it browned nicely anyway.  Used lattice top crust.  Yummy.

This was so good that even the non-rhubarb people in my family were willing to try it.... and then ate it all up.  haha.  This was great recipe that reminded me of my mother trying to make rhubarb pie and would always end up making soup instead.  It was still good.  But this one was the best.  Not runny at all!

This is divine! I only had one frozen pie crust, although I'd usually have made my own if I'd had the time, so hubby put the remainder of the filling into a Pyrex dish and baked it along with the pie. The single pie crust also meant no top crust. However both were absolutely delicious: the pie for dessert last evening and the strawberry rhubarb custard for breakfast this morning with a bit of greek yogurt on top.

I followed the recipe exactly and it overflowed ALL over my oven - even into the drawer below.  I had it on a cookie sheet too :(  The pie tasted fantastic but my afternoon consisted of scrubbing, scrubbing and more scrubbing.

Perfection!!  Both sweet and tart at the same time.  Those who commented that it was like soup obviously served the pie soon after it was baked.  I made this pie in the morning to serve for dessert after dinner and it was perfect and enjoyed by all.

The custard was amazing! My husband really likes the pie he doesn't like things overly sweet - I tried a little and was not crazy about it, but he also had is ala mode. I would use more strawberries or cut them smaller for better distributions and sweetness. I used what was left in the bowl of the custard mixture for the glaze and covered the pie in tin foil until the last 5-10 mins. I made one hefty double crust pie by the time it baked down it was fine.

Made this pie and it turned out wonderfully!  I drizzled it with heavy whipping cream before baking (mom always did this with her rhubarb pies) and did a lattice on top.  Creamy and awesome!

this recipe was delicious, made it at the small restaurant i work at and it didn't even last a day.  Everyone was complimenting on how good it was.  Tastes just like my grandmother's recipe which she won't give to me =).  I did have to use frozen fruit but it still sturned out delicious.

Eh. I found this pie to be a little disappointing. It wasn't bad and would be good for beginners since it is extremely easy. I used whole wheat flour and refrigerated the pie and it was not runny. It just wasn't as tangy and fresh-tasting as my usual strawberry rhubarb pie (strawberries, rhubarb, tapioca, sugar, butter and my secret ingredient- grated orange rind) and the filling was not a clear, pretty red, but a murky pink and beige instead. That said, I heard no complaints from the family, so perhaps I'm too picky?

It was a pretty good recipe but as mentioned there was a little too much fruit. I made it with 3 cups of each fruit and a 1/2 cup of flour to make up the difference so it wouldn't be runny. I also added a little bit of red jello for color and thicken (like a half a small box, put it in until it's the color you like). Turned out beautiful. Just make sure to poke plenty of holes or have a lattice or you'll have a mess.

I have now made this twice (2 pies each time) and it is an absolute hit. I did end up with a bit too much of the filling, so I cooked it on the stovetop and made a quick little dessert  for my grandson, which he loved.  My husband is planning on getting me more ingredients (while they're still in season) so that I can cook for the freezer and he will have his pies in the fall and the winter.

I am not usually the biggest fan of strawberry rhubarb pie but my husband is and since I love custard, I thought this would be a good compromise. I thought the pie was pretty good and my husband loved it. This recipe made enough for two (non-deep dish) pies and I didn't have any of the soupiness some mentioned. However, I did let the pies cool completely and then refrigerated due to reading all the reviews. I also used frozen rhubarb, which I thawed, drained and then pressed with paper towels to get out all the moisture I could. That was pretty time consuming and not sure if it helped to prevent soupiness but next time, I'll try to get fresh rhubarb to make things simpler. I think I'll also use the extra egg yolk from separating the egg white in the filling as someone else suggested as that should make the custard even richer. This would be good with all sorts of fruit, blueberry, cherry, etc., so I'll be having fun experimenting. Thanks for sharing the recipe, AMLIW!

I had high hopes, but I did not care for this recipe. The filling had a weird pasty texture and mottled pink color, and the taste was just not good. One slice and the rest did not get eaten--and I'm really not that picky about desserts either. I think it would be much better with a regular rhubarb/strawberry filling and custard made separately and added afterward.

I made this recipe with freshly picked strawberries and fresh rhubarb. Baked it the full 60 minutes, and it turned out perfect! Maybe using fresh, not frozen rhubarb is the key?? I love how the custard solidifies the pie - no messy runny pie, and the crust stays flaky. Would use a bit less nutmeg next time,as I found the taste a bit powerful. I added a dash of cinnamon as well. Tasty.

Very good. I made two 9" pies out of the one recipe. I used frozen fruit and measured them cold. I also used a crumble crust topping and thought it worked well. I used the suggestion to start baking at 400deg. and reduce to 350 deg. after 30 minutes. I made it last night and we ate it today. The consistency was very good. My husband said, "make sure you keep this recipe." Would definitely recommend to fruit pie lovers.

This pie was very good and easy to make!!  I gave it a 4 1/2 because it had a little bit of a weird texture, but still tasted delicious! I brought it to a work picnic and everyone loved it!
