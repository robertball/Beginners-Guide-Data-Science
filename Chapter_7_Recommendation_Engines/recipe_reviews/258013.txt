Very good! Use whatever toppings you want. This is the perfect way to make a tortilla pizza. Baking the crust first is key to it coming out just right.

I used 2 tortillas gluing them together with cheese, then baking them. It makes for a slightly thicker crust that I prefer.

This recipe has been a lifesaver!  It's quick, easy, inexpensive and yummy, so I have no excuse to order unhealthy delivery or fast food even when I'm tired or short on time ;)  My favorite to make are pepperoni & cheese, and BBQ chicken.

Very nice for a easy lunch. Similar to flatbread. I put it under the broiler for a minute so cheese has nice color.
