I loved this! I did sub red bell pepper for the green, threw in a handful of sweet pea pods and added some garlic sauteed shrimp. Hubs added a some lo mein noodles to his (he's gotta have his pasta), but the zoodles were enough for me! Great flavors and recipe. Will make again.

Love the idea but just coconut aminos and garlic don't do it for me flavor wise,teriyaki sauce to Asian brings high expectations. I tried adding a teri sauce I had in my fridge and it kicked up the flavor a notch but not enough for me to feel confident to serve as the star of the meal which is what I planned. Using it as a side. Maybe with a better yet healthy-ish teri sauce will help.

Wow is this delicious!! I made it for a coworker (who is obsessed with all things vegetable) for her going away party and it was a hit. I had to sub green cabbage for the bok choy because the store was sold out but look forward to trying it with it in the future. I will make this many times--fantastic recipe!!

I used different vegetables but got my inspiration from this post. I spiralized zucchini, red onion, carrot, sweet potato and added mushrooms. Cooked in olive oil and then added garlic and regular coconut aminos (sadly ordered the wrong kind and didn't have the teriyaki kind on hand) and it turned out AWESOME! I put it over white rice as kind of like a stir fry. My entire family ate it up and love it!

It lacked flavor for me.  I added Asian spice and little more teriyaki sauce to it which did help. This would make a good side dish to chicken or beef and broccoli.

I didn't have bok Choy and subed cabbage and spinach. Didn't have teriyaki and subed Bragg's Aminos. This was delish!  Can't wait to make it as recipe states. Will do pasta or Quinoa or rice next time and put this over it for a complete meal

Great dish for adding more vegetables to my meals. Used precooked zucchini, which made it a little mushy. But added some mushrooms the last 3 minutes which have it extra "meat". All in all a great meal that I'll make again

This was fantastic! My entire family loved it. Simple and easy. I increased everything, more bell pepper, more onion, etc., and I added cooked Italian sausages (which did make this take longer). We had no leftovers, so I’m glad I increased the amount of each ingredient. Used a spiralizer

This was great. I needed to stretch the recipe to feed more so I added some fresh green beans and served it on some leftover fried rice. I also used scallions instead of onions because I had some that needed to be used.  My husband and daughter spiced their portions up with Siracha sauce. I will definitely be making this again.

A quick and easy veggie side dish that works with almost any veggies you have on hand.  For my first time, I followed the recipe and added half of a red bell pepper and one yellow squash.  Delicious!

I had everything but the coconut aminos. I dont like coconut so it didn't bother me...until afterwards when I found out it was a type of soy sauce.  LOL  I found the recipe rather bland until I realized this and added some to it.  I had lots left as I bought a new spiralizer and was testing it with all kinds of veggies.  I also put some rice vinegar on some that didn't have the soy sauce and it made a tasty cold salad too.

Made this tonight because we've been eating lots of chicken and potatoes (think Costco size purchase!) Needed to get some veggies in the family and have been interested in Zoodle dishes. This sounded perfect, though I gave it a 50-50 with the family. EVERYONE loved it. Only complaint - not enough zoodles! I used a Soy Vay veri veri low sodium teriayaki sauce. I also added a little bit of broccoli, and extra carrot. Plus fresh ginger. Everything went. Husband said all of the veggies were cooked perfectly - crunchy, flavorful, delicious. Adding this dish and more zoodle dishes to the menu! Thanks for a delicious and versatile recipe!

Delicious!  First time using aminos and I thought the flavor was just right.  I paired it with garlic/butter shrimp and the hubby even enjoyed it.  Making it again soon.  Would go well with any protein.

Substituted regular teriyaki sauce  and red pepper for the green.  Went light on the bok choy and garlic. Excellent mix of flavors. I think most of us use this site for inspiration rather than exact recipes. I will definitely make this again.

I love this dish. I make it quite often and never feel bad about going back for seconds. This can be made with regular teriyaki sauce if you cannot find the Teriyaki Coconut Aminos (can be ordered online) but that will negate the paleo/gluten free portion. I make chicken in the Teriyaki coconut aminos and add that in sometimes as well. Really delicious and versatile meal.

This salad is delicious and was a big hit with my family. I paired it with t-bone steaks and potato casserole for Father's Day. I couldn't find the coconut aminos teriyaki sauce and substituted organic teriyaki sauce, but I will continue to look for the recommended sauce. The only changes I made was peeling  the carrots into ribbons instead of cutting and we liked the outcome. I also substituted red pepper for the green.

For this recipe you can sub in OR add in some LOW sodium teriyaki sauce.to your own taste amounts..For my taste, I think this recipe needs some low sodium teriyaki sauce, and fresh garlic added to the ingredient list.  How much will vary . I only use low sodium products because I like the flavor of whatever product I happen to be using ...BUT that flavor can be drowned out  OR thrown off balance by too much salty taste   .For those that like a little heat,  try adding in a few red pepper flakes.OR saracha sauce to keep the Asian vibe.I have not tried those additions yet. So I am not rating this with those additions. Other experiments I am considering include  playing with some Chines 5 spice.

OVERALL THIS IS A GOOD HEATHY RECIPE.  CERTAINLY  WORTH KEEPING.  IT JUST NEEDS FEW SIMPLE ADDITIONS LIKE FRESH GAR
