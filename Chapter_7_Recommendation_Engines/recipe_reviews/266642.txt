This is a delish  & quick breakfast.  I  load each muffin cup with and equal amount of ham, veggies and cheese first then pour egg mix on top so that each egg bite gets the same amount of ingredients.  I also add a quarter tsp. of salt and pepper to the egg mix.   I wrap each left over EB in a paper towel then seal in plastic wrap to store in fridge.  Husband LOVES these and they reheat nicely in the micro.
