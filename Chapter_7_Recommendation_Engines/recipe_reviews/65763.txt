A big hit with the other half and his  cricket buddies. Made exactly as per recipe but had to substitute turmeric for saffron. Also chucked in some sauteed portobello mushroom I needed to get rid of - worked very well.

I used to make paella for the staff dinner about ten years ago when I cooked for a fine dining restraunt.  I had totally forgotten about it.  This recipe reminded me how good, and easy, paella is.  Used fresh peas and added just before finish to add a crisp freshness.  Also sauteed mushrooms and onions in white wine.  Delicioius.  Make it.  This is the most authentic paella recipe I found on here.
