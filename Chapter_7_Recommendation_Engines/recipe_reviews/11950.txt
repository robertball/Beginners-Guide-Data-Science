This has become one of my favorite and best tasting recipes of this sort. However, some modifications were made as the original turned out to be a bit bland for my taste. I doubled the garlic, salt, pepper, and basil (and used fresh basil); also I increased the tomato and olive oil portions by 1/2. It turned out to be a mouth-watering flavorful diverse dish--highly recommended.

This is a hard recipe to rate.  It has great potential, but as is lacks something.  To correct the sauce issue I added about 1/2 cup of chicken stock.  There was plenty of sauce.  The recipe didn't have much taste though.  Since I originally made the recipe because I was looking for something healthy I don't want to add anything like butter or cream to give flavor.  I think I may try this again replacing the stock with wine.  I did use fresh roma tomatoes too and the lack of flavor may have been because it is still early in the season for tomatoes.  Because I am struggling to find heathy recipes I will try this one again.  It deserves the chance since it is a good base.

I used lemon olive oil to saute the mushrooms, onion and garlic in.  I also doubled the garlic. Lemon pepper instead of ground black pepper was another change that I made. To make sure it was very moist, I used 2  15 1/2 ounce cans of diced tomatoes, including the liquid.  The family is very happy tonight, they really liked this dish!

Very good, and my children (5,7,9)liked it.  It satisfied my desire for a simple pasta dish as well as their desire for a rich sauce.  I added fresh spinach and white wine to make more sauce.

This recipe was fabulous.  I marinated the chicken breast in Italian salad dressing overnight, and then tossed the dressing in with the chicken, but other than that, I stuck to the recipe provided.  I highly recommend!

the chicken mixture was too dry to use as a sauce, but it was perfect after I added some water.

wasn't a huge fan of this recipe. i followed the recipe and it didn't make enough "sauce" to cover all the noodles. I would have preferred there be more sauce than there was, but even then i don't know if i would have been impressed.

This had EXCELLENT flavor if you consider how fast it was to make.  I read up on comments and looked at what I had on hand.

I changed out a few things - :

I used a regular sized can of Italian/garlic/ basil tomatoes – don’t drain them! I still diced up a small fresh tomato into the dish. I don’t like DRY dishes!
Canned mushrooms (didn’t have fresh) - drained.
Extra garlic.
Extra basil.
Boneless chicken thighs *cubed*
¼ cu white wine (because I was tired of looking at it in the fridge door)...lol

Follow the recipe directions, and then serve with grated fresh Parmesan cheese!  Juicy...and very light!  Next time I’ll make sure I have fresh basil on hand!  I think that would have made this even better!!!!!!!!  Oh...next time perhaps a light sprinkle of Feta when served!  We really loved this!  I think shrimp would work well too. 

I gave this a 4* just because the base recipe needs some extra ingredients to put it up to 5*s.  It was good...and fast to make. The flavor was very reminiscent of my mom’s delish chicken cacciatore she used to make (only hers took allllll day to make).   I really like that!

Other than the onion chopping, this is really quick! Using canned tomatoes worked great, although I think I would have put them in earlier so they could saute longer with the basil and I think reserving the liquid is a good suggestion. Tasted wonderful!

This was really good!  I used more garlic than the recipe called for, and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and my husband and I both loved it!  Next time I'll try fresh basil.

I used 3-cheese ravioli for the pasta, which complimented the sauce nicely.  Very easy to make!

Flavor only begins to describe this wonderful dish. Tasty, colorful, easy to prepare. I used canned tomatoes with liquid, (next time I'll reserve the liquid and add as needed), but this did not take away from the flavor.  Second helpings for this family.   This is A-one in my book.

I am going to give this recipe 5 stars because with the recommended changes of other reviewers this recipe was liked by all in my family. I used green onion (just cause I wanted to use them up), 3 gloves of garlic, chicken broth and added the can of diced tomatoes. I also marinaded my chicken for a few hours and spiced up the cubes of chicken with Italian seasoning. I will definitely make this recipe again!

As previous posters stated, this is an easy recipe to prepare, but it doesn't have much flavor. Even when I doubled the spices, I thought it needed something more. Still, I would probably make this again if pressed for time and short on ingredients.

It was very bland! I thought this would be good because I make very similar pasta sauce but with no chicken. I was terribly wrong! Next time I will make my pasta sauce and add the chicken!

I really liked this recipe! It has real nice flavor, but I did add a few more Italian spices, for my taste. My mom doesn't like tomatoes, but she really enjoyed it. It goes very well with garlic bread!

Before making this dish I read the reviews and made the following changes: used 8 oz sliced fresh mushrooms, doubled the garlic & salt & basil & pepper, used 2 cans Italian style diced tomatoes for the fresh, and added an 8 oz can of tomato sauce. I used spaghetti for the linguine. Next time I make this I will add for canned tomato sauce. After these changes and additions the recipe turned out great (if a little dry). I'll definitely be making this again!!!

There were so many helpful suggestions for this recipe. Following others' ideas, I used olive oil, added crushed red pepper, and substituted canned flavored tomatoes (drained and reserving the liquid to add as needed). I also added ALOT more garlic as a personal preference. Next time, I think I'll marinate the chicken cubes in Italian dressing (the chicken was a tad dry) and add a little tomato sauce or spaghetti sauce for a wetter, more tomato-ey sauce. This is a great starting point. You can really jazz up this recipe with some experimentation. Thank you, Corwynn!

I did follow the advice of several reviewers.  I used a Roma tomato and decided to go with the green onions instead of the regular.  This was good.  There wasn't a whole lot of flavor, but it was there.  Thanks for a new meal that we really liked.

This Recipe was a hit at my house. My family loved it. Although I made some minor tweeks and changes. Your recipie seemed good dont get me wrong but i thought it was a little bland. Before i cooked the chickan i marinated it in Italian Dressing then poored the rest of the dressing into the pan and cooked it with the veggies. I also added peppers and i doubled all of the spices. Insted of veggie oil i used lemon sauce and olive oil.

The taste of this dish is very good, but there is next to no "sauce".  I belive the reviewers who suggested using canned diced tomatoes rather than fresh have the right idea.  That might push the rating up to a 5.

After reading the reviews that said this recipe was bland, I decided to completely do away with measuring the spices and to make almost all the changes that were recently suggested.  First, I used white wine to saute the veggies and added more when I added the chicken.  I salted the chicken before adding it to the pan, then added LIBERAL amounts of pepper and basil plus a little bit of lemon zest.  I didn't have canned tomatoes, so with the fresh ones I added a few spoonfuls of some spaghetti sauce I had in the fridge.  It came out GREAT and was healthy to boot.  But because the original recipe needed so much work, I gave it only 4 stars.

This dish was very good. I added a can of diced tomatoes with garlic and onion, undrained. I then added fresh spinach at the end. The kids thought it was O.K., but my husband and I loved it. I will be making this again.

Nice chicken pasta dish.  The chicken had a delicious basil/tomato flavor, but this recipie is nice in that it doesn't completely mask the flavor of your chicken.  I found that the chicken/linguini ratio was a little bit low of my taste...I'd recommend either upping the amount of chicken/sauce or reducing the amount of pasta.  I had about .5-1.0 servings of pasta left after I'd used up the chicken.

Great recipe!  I added 1/2tsp of soy sauce and 1tsp of italian seasoning, and sprinkled some leftover spaghettie sauce on top as well, just to make it more like a sauce.  I loved this, and will most definately make it again!

Very good pasta. I omitted the chicken because I was already cooking chicken on the side. I added a splash of white wine as others suggested. Very basic and delicious. Will definetely do again. Next time with chicken.

I toook the basics of this recipe and  added a few of my favorite things...1) I added ground sage with the other spices 2)I added a package of cream cheese after the tomatoes 3) at the end I added a pound of fresh spinach, turned off the heat and let it wilt 4) I chose to use penne pasta with lines.....EXCELLENT even if I do say so myself.

After seeing all the reviews on this recipe, I decided to take some of the suggestions and added a few of my own for this recipe.  First, I tossed the chicken with a packet of the dried italian dressing sauteed that with the vegetables.  Once all of the meat is cooked, I added a can of diced tomatoes with basil and 1/4 cup of chicken stock.  Everything else I kept the same in the recipe.  It turned out good with the changes I made.  I don't think this will be something I make often.

Very good.  I would recomment to use Roma tomatoes in lieu of a larger less italian flavored tomato.  Definately a keeper.

I like to read reviews to get other's input. As suggested, I added about 1/2 cup chicken broth, and a little extra garlic. I also seasoned the chicken with lemon-pepper. Served with garlic bread, this was a wonderful dinner that did not take a whole lot to prepare. Will definitely make again! Delicious! :)

My family loved it! A first.  But I did modify by doubling garlic and adding zuchinni. I think I’ll also try the chicken stock the Roma’s added a little sauce but not much.

TOMATOES /"SAUCE"
A few things to note if you have not made this. If you are hoping for "sauce" as in a spaghetti sauce you may be disappointed. 2 C. of diced fresh tomatoes will not produce a sauce that could coat and cover a pound of pasta. This dish is best considered to be more of a chicken and tomato topping over pasta. It is still good,but if you want "sauce, then try adding either spaghetti sauce OR for a lighter thin , non-clinging sauce-- add a can or 2 of diced tomatoes with Basil, oregano and garlic. In the winter I use the canned diced tomatoes wih basil oregano & garlic. I like it better than hot house tomatoes .In the summer,  fresh off the vine are great....but I still  sometimes add (or at least have on hand) some seasoned diced can ones. I always garnish pasta dishes with torn fresh basil and plenty of parm cheese.
HERBS
I DOUBLE them .ànd add in 1 clove more garlic, and 1/2 to 3/4 t garlic powder as well as 1/2 t. oregano.  I like half the herbs to season the C hicken.Then 1/2 to  season the tomatoesNOT  ONLY FOR PASTA
Make at least double the recipe  only do not double the pasta. Save some  ( OR ALOT ) of the chicken tomato mixture, and serve on Italian Rolls with provolone and mozzerella.. You could stir in a little pizza sauce if you like.

My husband and I though this was OK. 
I made changes based off the reviews and still the sauce was somewhat bland and didn't really "stick" to the chicken or noodles.
The changes I made was to double the garlic & basil. I added some Italian dressing AND Italian seasoning to the chicken & let it marinade for 5 hours.
I added 1/4 white wine & some spinach to the chicken when it was cooking.
It wasn't a bad flavor, but you practically had to drink the liquid to taste anything.
I might try it one more time to see if I can somehow get the sauce thicker without making it a heavy cream sauce.

We've made this a bunch of times and our whole family loves it! Even our picky 3 and 5-year-olds.  It's quick and easy to make, and tastes so good.  The only change I made was to add a teaspoon of McCormick's Chicken Base, when I add all of the seasonings and chicken to the skillet.

I found this recipe very bland, and not much taste at all.  I even added additional spices when I cooked it.  Won't make it again.

Followed recipe to a T and have to agree with some of the other reviews - no taste, too dry and just blah! No-one in the family liked it!

Great recipe.  I had been trying to find a spagett/pasta dish that was different than just eating your regular red sauce spagetti.  My 3 year old loved it.

My whole family loved this.  There was a lot of cutting and preparing that I like to avoid but the result was worth it.
