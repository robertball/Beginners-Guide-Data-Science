This turned out pretty good. Sprinkling the garlic powder over the spinach doesn't do any good. It doesn't stick to it. I say add it to the shrimp instead. This was super simple and was okay but I think it could have used a little more flavor. If I were to make this again I'd use butter instead of oil and I'd also give it a big squeeze of lemon in the end.

This was fantastic. Do what the others said. Season the shrimp and use butter. If you have it, hit it with a splash of toasted sesame oil. I also grated some pecorino and mixed it with the shrimp. Cook a lot of spinach. With the spices left from cooking the shrimp, the butter and sesame oil, it’s delectable. The only complaint I got was “I could eat myself miserable with this dish”.

This was a really simple recipe. However, I did tweak it a little bit for more flavor. I added chopped white onions, minced garlic, shredded Parmesan cheese, a hint of sesame seed oil and parsley flakes. It was bursting with flavor!!! :)

I loved this recipe but  I did change it a little, Soup Loving Nicole suggested using butter and seasoning the shrimp instead of the spinach which I did and I also added  a few pieces of chicken breast and it was delicious!

I did change it a bit.  I used equal parts olive oil & butter . I also seasoned the shrimp with garlic powder, pepper & a little Old Bay seasoning.  I added a little basil while cooking & served over plain white rice.
