As far as cake mix cookies go, this is one of the better recipes I have tried.  Super easy to make, ready to pop in the oven in no time.  I added extra sprinkles to the batter, and rolled them in coarse sugar before cooking, and based on the sweetness level, I think it was a needed addition.  I still like traditional cookies better, but for a quick easy cookie, these are hard to beat.

I made this except I used chocolate cake mix,  same amount of butter,  2 eggs instead of 1 and added 3 teaspoons of water.

SO easy, you don't even need to measure anything! You can literally use ANY cake mix, and make delicious cookies with one stick of butter and one egg. I did a bunch of these over Christmas--we were staying in a hotel room with a kitchenette and it was the simplest round of baking I've ever done in my life.  If you want to make uniform balls, try a small ice cream scoop with a spring-release. I also recommend parchment, and watching for the very first signs of browning on the edge, so you have a soft, chewy cookie.

The dough was not very firm and therefore not easy to roll in balls. Neither my children or I enjoyed the flavour.
