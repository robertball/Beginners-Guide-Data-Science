This is a favorite recipe of our family that my sister-in-law uses with a few slight variations. Our family likes the oriental flavor the best & I use plain shredded cabbage if its available. The biggest difference is that we use 1/3 c. vinegar, 1 c. oil & 1/2 c. (or less) of sugar (or even splenda). It really isn't necessary to refrigerate first & you definitely don't want to let it set too long. It is best fresh for the crunch factor. If you make these changes you most likely will like it better yet.

Oh maw gosh this is the craziest, tastiest, easiest coleslaw ever! I made this being intrigued and kind of smirking at the idea.  Bought one of the pre-shredded packages of coleslaw (w/ carrots) and one Ramen chicken, one beef.  I think that was an accident rushing through the store but it seemed to be a "happy accident".  After crushing the noodles and throwing them in with the slaw, I used both the chicken and beef flavoring packets in the vinegar then tossed it into the slaw.  Left overnight in the fridge and tasted next day. Both the husband and I were completely blown away by how good this tasted.  Who would ever think to use those flavor packets in vinegar?  GENIUS!! The packets flavor the vinegar perfectly and only dampen the tang just a bit.  The slaw is so good, you will never miss mayo or sugar.  No need to add any other seasoning or anything at all.  The whole thing is also pretty diet friendly so no guilt.  Just be careful on the amount of noodles used because they puff up from the liquid (like in the soup) and may overcome the cabbage. SUPER YUMMY!  Thank you SloppyJo!

LOVE this salad! I emptied the fridge and added red bells, green onion  and the sunflower seeds gave it a nice crunchy texture:) I used a little pickled onion dressing too. Thanks SloppyJo! YUMMY!!

I followed the recipe exactly. It was alright, but I won't make it again. It didn't have a lot of flavor.

Very little flavor, and there didn't seem to be enough sauce. It also didn't have the sweetness like the crunchy coleslaw recipes I'm used to eating.

It is just okay as written, not much flavor. I added sesame oil,soy sauce, teriyaki sauce & red pepper flakes tasting as I added. Yum was a big hit !! Also used a bit more almonds & sesame seeds for more crunch
