This is a really good salad! Since the author of the recipe suggested substituting almonds for peanuts, that's what I did (I used chopped almonds, not slivered though). I also just used a pre-mixed bag of green salad that had some romaine and spinach in it. I really enjoyed how this was not overly 'mayonnaise-y' as some salads like this tend to be--it was perfectly creamy without being overwhelming. The only thing I'd do differently next time is to add a touch of dill to the dressing, just because I think it would compliment it really well (and I really like dill lol). Will definitely make this again! Thank you for the recipe!
