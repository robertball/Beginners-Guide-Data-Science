The meatballs are definitely the star of this dish according to my family. We thought the onions should be diced instead of in rings and that overall, the vegetables should be roasted a bit longer. A little more parmesan and double the meatballs the next time we make this dish.

I really enjoyed this recipe. It was simple and delicious. I substituted green beans for the asparagus because I didn't have asparagus on hand. It was a good substitution. I will definitely be making this again!

Unfortunately, we were not a fan of the meatballs in this.  It was another one where I took out the meatballs to save the meal.  The linguini with roasted veggies was great, but we did not enjoy the meatballs with it.  Sorry.

KNOCK YOUR SOCKS OFF GOOD!  We really enjoyed this recipe and look forward to having it often.  My only substitution was using minced garlic for fresh as I didn't realize I was out of fresh garlic.  Hubby kept telling me throughout dinner how much he was enjoying it.  A definite keeper.  The meatballs are fabulous!

This is fantastic!  I made my own meatballs with some Jenny-O Italian flavored turkey sausage which I hated, but not the recipes fault...Everything else was great.  Roasting the vegetables really just put this over the top...thanks!

This recipe is a keeper! The only major difference was I used steamed broccoli in place of roasted asparagus since I didn't have any on hand but still wanted to make this recipe for dinner. I added the steamed broccoli into the pan with the other roasted veggies. I used plain chicken meatballs since my grocer didn't carry the tomato and basil variety. I used a basil infused olive oil in this recipe. We really enjoyed it!

I changed this in the effort to lighten it up.  I left out the onion b/c of a food allergy, and substituted baby portobello mushrooms.  I used 2 Tbsp olive oil to coat the vegetables AND to cook the chicken meatballs, and b/c I try to avoid salt as a "seasoning" I used 1/2 tsp italian seasoning instead.  I dropped the linguini to 6 oz which was PLENTY, and dropped the parmesan cheese to 3 Tbsp.  I left out the reserved pasta water as I didn't see the point in making a watery sauce.  Received great reviews about how flavourful the meatballs were!

This was good and probably would make again. Not as successful as I had hoped with family. We were unable to get the meatballs,so we used the chicken Italian sausage, and fettuccine instead of linguini.

These meatballs are very good. I thought the overall taste of the dish was a bit bland for my taste. Love the veggies but the sauce (or lack of) left me feeling like something was missing.

This was delicious!  Unfortunately my store didn't carry the meatballs so I substituted the Sundried Tomato Sausage (with basil and tomatoes) and it was really good!  I didn't use any onion but I did dice up some mini portabello mushrooms and roasted those along with the tomato and asparagus.  Will definately make this again!

This was super yummy! I made this to the recipe with the exception I only added about half of the cooking liquid. I really enjoyed the roasted vegetables in this dish. The meatballs had a great flavor and really enhanced the dish! Thank you Al Fresco for another delicious dinner!!!

This is a wonderful dish!  I added some peppers, mushrooms, cilantro and oregano seasoning.  That made for a very colorful and attractive dish which, combined with some ciabatta bread with parmesan made for a great dinner.

This recipe is a winner! I purchased the chicken meatballs because my grocery store had a BOGO and it was my lucky day.  My husband and Italian mother loved this recipe.  I will be making it again for sure!

This was delicious with whole wheat thin spaghetti and made from scratch chicken meatballs. Just checking to see did anyone pre cook their asparagus according to the ingredient list and how was garlic prepared?  I love this app!

This was very good!  I loved the asparagus in the dish.  I cut the basil to 1/4 cup because my family isn't too keen on it.

I could not find the Al Fresco chicken meatballs in my my grocery store, so I made my own with ground chicken.  I followed the rest of the recipe as written, except I used zuchinni in place of the asparagus.  Excellent summertime dinner!

I altered this recipe a bit by using spinach instead of asparagus and I made my own spicy turkey meatballs.  I forgot to save some of the pasta water, so I placed a few noodles in a pan with water and heated it up hoping to extract some of the starch needed for the sauce.  It worked fine.  I would make this again.

This was a very good and easy recipe.  My husband was afraid it would be too spicy (he does not like tomato sauce in the evening) but he was surprised by the sweet roasted tomaoes and loved this dish.

I made this tonight.  Although I did make a couple of changes, overall I followed the receipe.  I thought it was really good.  My changes included not cooking the asparagus first, I just roasted them along with the onions and mushrooms.  I did not use tomatoes as I did not have any.  They would have looked good.  I also did not thaw or brown the meatballs.  I used the al fresco ones and they were already browned they looks to me, so I just put them frozen on the baking sheet with the vegetables and the whole dinner was almost in one pan. Just needed to boil the linguina (I used whole wheat).  I did not put the fresh basil on my husbands serving, but I did on mine and that really gave the whole thing a very nice flavor.  I will make this again soon.

Really tasty and so easy to make!  Made this for the first time tonight and will be making it again for sure.  I substituted broccolini for the asparagus and added yellow peppers to the roasted veggies.  I also added some romano cheese to the entire mixture just before serving.  My husband doesn't like onions but he was slurping them off his plate.

VERY GOOD EASY.  This is an easy basic recipe. You can use
and change in many ways. I used my own beef meatballs.
No asparagus today,  but did roast frozen mixed vegetables,
added tomatoes 1/2 way in with deli roasted garlic. Could certainly add tomato sauce if you wanted but was very good
without. Parmesan and basil good.

The base idea of this dish is really good and very simple. Like others, I made a bunch of changes and the simplicity of this recipe is favorable for substitutions. I used bowtie pasta. No tomatoes or asparagus, so I roasted broccoli with the onions. That took more like 20 minutes. Also, big change- no chicken meatballs. I used cubed chicken tenderloin cooked with salt, pepper and garlic. I have a veggie/pescatarian in the house, so I cooked the chicken separately and also made tilapia filets with garlic.  Then mixed all the roasted veggies with the pasta, oil, spices, fresh basil and lots of parmesan.  Very mild but still flavorful. The hubby ate three helpings and even the picky bird-like eater finished a whole plate.

We definitely enjoyed this and those meatballs are yummy!  I was out of fresh basil so I used dried, omitted asparagus because I'm the only one in the family that will eat it, and used whole wheat fettuccine rather than linguine.  Even with those changes this was great!

Delicious!  I substituted fresh green beans, added some garlic salt and fresh red and yellow bell peppers.... Very good.  I also made another separate dish as a Vegan version.  I took out the meat and added "Beyond Meat: beyond beef crumbles feisty" and left out the parmesan cheese.  It was excellent!
