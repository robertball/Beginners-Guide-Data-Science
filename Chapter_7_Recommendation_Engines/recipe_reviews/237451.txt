This is the third time I've made a highly rated "paleo" food that uses coconut flour. This is the third time I thought it was "meh" when everyone else seemed to love it. Today I had an epiphany -- I must not like coconut flour. I also don't particularly care for ghee, so I guess it was destined for me to not love these muffins. And, these do not taste like Entenman's in any way.

I loved these! I didn't have any pumpkin, so I mashed up two overripe bananas and used those instead, and I didn't have any maple syrup, so I just substituted honey. I also had to use coconut oil instead of the ghee and I added 1/2 cup dark brown sugar. They came out very moist and very yummy! Definitely a keeper!

I just started the Paleo diet and I was a sugar addict before. So these looked yummy. My first attempt was not what I was hoping for, but I followed the recipe. They will work in a pinch!  My fault was I sprayed too much coconut spray in the paper muffin holders and they came out mushy and wet on the bottom. I took them out of papers & put them on a paper towel.  I could taste the pumpkin (not a big fan) and they didnâ€™t rise as I had hoped. They were a bit mealy, but I will try again.
