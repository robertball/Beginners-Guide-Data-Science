For gluten-free bread, this is 5 stars all the way...with some changes.  The mix was too dry for me too, I added at least an extra cup of water.  I left out the milk powder as we can't have it, worked fine.  I baked it 325 degrees in my convection oven for 45 minutes and it was perfect.  Even after cooling it's great, with a texture very similar to heavier whole wheat bread, which I love.  I am thrilled to  have this recipe.  Thanks!!!

This was a great recipe for gluten free bread. I did take other people's suggestions. I soaked the rice flour in the liquid for 20 minutes, no dry milk and 4 eggs instead of the egg substitute. Rising takes a good amount of time. But everyone loved it here. Tastes great toasted with clarified Butter. Good for Nomad Genotype dieters.

I am on a Wheat and Dairy Free Diet for my Rhuematoid Arthritis and this recipe was great for me. It actually tasted normal and my family REALLY couldn't tell the difference!!

Hi, I haven't tried this recipe yet, but I have tried a bunch of rice only bread recipes. A few tips that work on bread in general. I will try this recipe in a week or so.  But I wanted to leave some tips.  Use a thermometer and when the internal temp reaches 190oF then the bread is done.  Also I preheat the oven to 150oF.  Turn it off, put the bread dough in and it rises quite well.  Or if it is over 100oF outside, I put it in the sun with plastic wrap over it.

Found the mix to be very dry.  Had to add 2 cups of water to make it manageable.
It would help to give a length of time to bake, since there is no way to check if it is done.
For some reason the bread did not double in size at rising, perhaps to much water was added?
After baking the centre was still very moist and chewy.
The bread itself has a very good flavor and I will make it again.

I liked this recipe very much. I used four eggs instead of the egg substitute and olive oil instead of walnut oil. The texture is dense but for me that was a plus.

Find a way to test for doneness; for me the center was not cooked enough. Taste is good.

This is the first time I've made GF bread with yeast and I appreciated the extra tips about what the consistency should be. Dense but lightly sweet. It's a keeper. Thanks for sharing!!

This is by far the best tasting, best textured rice bread I have tried. However, I had to make it twice because it was my first time making bread, and I didn't know that the yeast had to be activated in sugar and water first - the recipe makes no mention of it. Maybe that could be added for other first-time breadmakers?
I too, found that an extra cup of water was needed. Without it it was as dry as pie dough.
Other than those notes, the bread is fantastic! Will make again!

The flavor was fine, but the texture was really mealy.  It would probably help to soak the rice flour first.  I did add an extra cup of milk judging from the other reviews.  I omitted the milk powder.  The dough turned out really well.  I wish I could say the same for it after it was baked.  Because of the texture it wasn't even good for toast.  Sorry.

Because the rice flour contains no gluten, it will not rise as high as regular bread --- but if you add more liquid such as water, you might need to feed the yeast a bit more by adding a bit more sugar. Good recipe :)

The bread tasted very good. I used coconut oil, honey for sweetner, and substituted 2 Tbsp white rice flour with sweet rice flour and 1/4 cup of oat flour for the brown rice flour(I was out). I am dairy free so I substituted almond meal for the dry milk powder and the bread was very soft. The only reason I give it 4 stars is the recipe is too vague I added a about 2 1/4 cups of water,in total I think I just kept adding because it seemed too dry compared to other gluten free bread recipes. If I would have know how much water I was going to have to add I would have not added the 1/4 cup of oat flour since I was out of brown rice flour. I baked it in a bread machine for 50 min at 340 degrees.I do love that it does not contain refined starches and still made a good bread.

This was delicious! It actually wasn't as hearty as I'm used to, but in my opinion, the heavier the better.  I tweaked the recipe a bit, anyway. When I made the dough, it was too dry to even be a regular dough consistency, much less one leaning toward a batter. So I used a total of a cup and 3/4 of water, including the amount listed in the recipe, but I'll probably use 2 cups even next time.  I didn't have any egg substitute, so I left it out, and used olive oil instead of walnut. I used another reviewer's recommendation, and preheated the oven to 170°F (the lowest it would go), turned it off, put in the dough, and let it rise for an hour. Then I baked it at 325°F for about 45 minutes. Great recipe.
