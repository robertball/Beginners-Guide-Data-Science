This chicken came out really good tonight. About 45 minutes into the cooking time, I checked the chicken to make sure it wasn't drying out. I decided to take the foil off for the last 15 minutes. This really helped to *glaze* the chicken better. I made sure to spoon the sauce over the chicken a few times throughout cooking it ~ otherwise, the sauce would have stayed at the bottom of the dish and just kinda float in it. Thanks, Doug! :o)

I have made this recipe twice, and the first time it was okay, the second time was great!  The first time I used a sweet bbq sauce because that was what I had--the second time I used a spicy sauce--what a huge difference!  The second time I also used 1 cup of bbq sauce and the specified amounts of honey and ketchup because I wanted more of a barbeque flavor.  I cooked for exactly 45 minutes and the chicken was just cooked through and very tender.   It's so simple--you can't go wrong with this recipe.

This is a great recipe! I used 1 cup of BBQ sauce & removed foil for the last 5 min to thicken sauce as per other reviewers. I also used 6 breast halves and there was still plenty of sauce leftover for a side dish (cheesy mashed potatoes - yum!). Cooked for 45 min - Perfect! Thank you! I'll keep this one forever!

I'm so excited to find this recipe!!  I have never before baked chicken with BBQ sauce before where the sauce didn't just slide off.  THIS SAUCE STAYS ON!! Woohoo!  I did use a SPICY BBQ sauce and I didn't have quite enough honey on hand but I used what I had and it was terrific.  I baked for 20 minutes covered, 10 minutes uncovered and broiled for another 5 min.  Delish!!

This was good although I prefer the recipe on this site called "Baked Bar-be-que Chicken".  It's easier and the result is better tasting.

Doug: Many a time I have poured bbq sauce over chicken pieces and baked in the oven!  I did, tonight, follow your recipe and it turned out so much better than my "throw it in the oven" try!Absolutely delicious and there was nothing left on either of our plates!  If anyone is interested I used Sweet Baby Ray's  bbq sauce that can be purchased at Walmart and cut down on the honey because the sauce is kinda sweet to start out with.  Thank you for the "perfect" recipe!

This was really good and extremely easy to prepare! I like recipes where you don't have to make a trip to the store because you have ingredients on hand! Plus its perfect for when you've had a busy day and need something quick to make for dinner! Thank You!

GREAT chicken!! Per another, I used a spicy BBQ sauce, which was slightly offset by the ketchup and honey. Also, I was able to use 6 chicken breasts, with sauce to spare. During the last 5 min of baking, I removed the foil and baked, just to thicken the sauce a little. The result was great and easy/quick prep time made this dish all that much more enjoyable. Thanks Doug!

LOVED it! Even my 3 year old, who does NOT eat meat, ate it like it was her favorite!!!! Needless to say, I was VERY impressed! SUPER EASY!!! I did make a few minor adjustments due to other reviews... as many people suggested using a spicy bbq sauce and all I had on hand was a sweet one, I added a couple hearty dashes of ground red pepper and one hearty dash of garlic powder. I also cut the ketchup back to 1/3 cup since I really wanted the bbq flavor to come through nicely. I also didn't have as much honey as I thought I did, so that only ended up being a 1/2 cup which again, took form the sweetness department and I think worked in my favor for achieving that tangy/spicy everyone was raving about. I think this is now a staple in this home!

This turned out well! It was good... Except it made a LOT of sauce (I even threw some out... there was way too much) - although I think I DID use a bit less chicken than the recipe called for. Great with rice.

After realizing I was low on every single ingredient (aside from the chicken), I decided to just see what I had.  It just so happened that I used up the rest of my bbq sauce, honey and ketchup and each had exactly half the amount required for each.  Talk about lucky.  Since I'm not a fan of onion, I threw some onion powder in instead.  This was so amazing that I even used the sauce at the bottom of the pan for my potatoes as well!  This is definitely a keeper.

This is one of the few recipes that my husband volunteered his opinion before I asked him how he liked it. "This chicken is great, definitely make this again. It's not dry at all!" He has this fear that all baked chicken is tough and dry, but this recipe proved him wrong! This does make a lot of sauce which you could probably cut back on a little, but the sauce has a very nice flavor to it. A little sweet, a little spicy, and even a little bit tangy. It's very good! And oh so easy. Seriously, it took me about five minutes to get the onions chopped, sauces measured out and chicken in the oven. Great idea for a weeknight meal when you don't want to spend a long time prepping and chopping. We will eat this again soon - probably on a night that we're crunched for time. Thanks for the recipe, Doug!

Delicious! The sauce was a little thin when done, so I thickened it up a bit.  When it was finished, I took out the chicken and placed it on a plate while I added 1 tbs of corn starch in the sauce, stirred, then put the chicken back in the pan to serve.

I used boneless chicken breasts and original Bulls Eye BBQ Sauce. Turned out great! Really liked the onions. Leftover chicken in sauce was great cut up for a sandwich the next day. It does make a lot of sauce, so you could do probably 6 chicken breasts.

It's quick, easy, and good.  Only gave 3 stars because there was just too much sauce the first time around and that to me seemed like a waste of ingredients and money.  So made it a 2nd time and cut all ingredients to make the sauce in half.  Turned out just right.  And still plenty of sauce.. ;)

Giving this 5 stars because of the sauce, and becaues it's one of the few times I have actually liked bbq chicken breasts. Usually stick to thighs because I like the flavor and texture better for bbq. Since making this I've seen some reviews that might help with glazing -- the only problem I had with this recipe.

Very good and easy barbecue chicken. I used onion powder, Bullseye Carolina style barbecue sauce, and baked these at 350*. I only had a little honey though so it was more tangy than sweet. Really good dish overall though. Thanks Doug.

Good base but, in my opinion it needed some more seasoning and not so much onion! I most likely won't be using this recipe again. Props for being so easy to make though.

This recipe was great I did change a few things only b/c it's what i had on hand.  Per ratings I used a spicy chipotle Honey BBQ sauce at 1 cup and only 1/2 cup honey b/c that's all i had.  Other than that I followed directions and turned out great.  Had to admit I was worried the chicken would be dry but we loved it.  My husband even gave me a " well honey that's good".  And he normaly doesn't comment lol.  I will definately be playing around w/ this and some added seasonings for an annual rib cookoff.   Thank you so much!!

Wonderful basic BBQ sauce- it was a bit sweet for my taste, so I did add a bit extra BBQ sauce, a couple tablespoons dijon mustard, some fresh cracked pepper, and 2 or 3 drops liquid smoke. Made for a more tangy sauce. I used chicken legs and browned them in a skillet before putting them in the oven. The sauce thickened up and coated the chicken SOOO well! I only basted once during the 50 min they were in the oven. I baked at 375' for 40 min with foil, then removed for the last 10 min. Delicious!!! Thanks for the recipe!!

OMG! It was the first time I tried roasting a chicken and I chose this recipe. Really glad I chosed this, it was a hit, gone in less than ½hr. I used whole chicken so it took longer time to bake. Definately a keeper. Posted picture for this recipe.

I made some alterations and it turned out pretty good.  I made the sauce with honey bbq sauce, only used 1/4 cup honey and added some mustard and worcestershire sauce to offset the sweetness.  Also added a few tbsp. hot sauce to kick it up.  I then added chunks of yukon gold potatoes and chunks of sweet potatoes to the sauce, poured that over the chicken and cooked it covered for an hour.  The chicken was done but the potatoes were not, so they cooked another 45 minutes, uncovered.  That carmelized the sauce too.  I nuked the whole thing when the potatoes were done.  Comforting food.  Need to figure out how to cook it so it's all done at the same time.

It was ok. I don't know if I'll make it again - would be better for grilling I think.  I'll leave out the onion if I do it again.

This was the best barbecue chicken I've ever had, or made. However, I didn't add honey, although my barbecue sauce did have it in there. I did add a touch of Worcestershire sauce, 1/4 cup of white vinegar, 1/2 cup of light brown sugar, 2 tablespoons of water, a pinch of barbecue spice and garlic powder, and lastly, I used baby pearl onions (quartered). I added all of the above to the sauce mixture prior to pouring it over the chicken. I butterflied the breasts to expedite the cooking time and was enjoying this delectable dish within the half hour. Thank you for sharing, awesome recipe!!

This was super simple to make and my family loved it so much they asked me to make it 2 days in a row. I used chicken thighs instead of chicken breast and I lightly seasoned my chicken with Greek seasoning and black pepper. I also did what others suggested and took the foil off for the last 15 minutes of cooking. I served it over brown rice.

I made this for dinner tonight, and it is quick, easy, and awesome! My family just wishes I would have made more! I followed the recipe but I used spicy BBQ sauce because that is what my family prefers and this will now be made at least twice a month in our house.

Simple recipe; easy clean-up! The only constructive criticism I have is that I thought the sauce was a little too watery, so I removed the baked chicken and poured the sauce into a saucepan. I added some cornstarch, first mixed with cold water and made sort of a "barbecue gravy sauce". Excellent! Thanks for sharing :-)

I changed things up a little and LOVED this recipe.  I used a spicy BBQ sauce as others suggested.  I used Famous Dave's Texas Pit.  I used maple syrup in place of honey because I love the flavor.  I used about a cup of the BBQ sauce and about a half cup each of the maple syrup and ketchup them...maybe a tad more ketchup because I was trying to make sure it wasn't too spicy for my son.  I didn't bother with the onions because my son hates them.  I used 5 boneless breasts and as other reviewers suggested, I took the foil off at the end to help thicken the sauce on top.  I actually cooked the chicken 5 minutes longer because the breasts were large and I'm always afraid of undercooking chicken.  Let the meat rest a few minutes before cutting into it.  These were tender and oh so delicious!  It did make a lot of sauce as other reviewers noted, but I think that helped make the chicken so tender!  My hubby loved it!
I served it with roasted garlic red mashed potatoes and a Greek salad of spinach, tomato, green onion, Mccormick Greek seasoning, lemon juice and olive oil....would make a terrific dinner for company!

Really, really good.  It made the chicken so tender and tasted so good.  I used a spicy sauce as recommended, only about 1/2 the honey so it wasn't too sweet, and the amount of ketchup called for.  Not sure about the reviews that thought it had too much ketchup - maybe if you don't use a spicy sauce that flavor will come through more.  Cooking time recommended seemed a bit too long, so I shortened it up.  Cooked at 350 for to 25 minutes then removed foil and moved oven to 400 for another 10 minutes and it was just fine.  I guess if you use really thick breasts longer would be necessary but otherwise you might risk drying out the meat too much.

Delicious! I think pretty much all BBQ chicken is, but I really enjoyed being able to use my friend's homemade honey for this recipe. It is a simple, easy, and quick way to dress up din din. Reminds me of comin' home from school and smelling the aroma from the kitchen of my moms meals. mm mm. Only downfall- the picture doesnt look like it at all? needs new picture.

Very good flavor & super easy to prepare!!  I used a smoky bacon BBQ sauce (my fave!) w/ the honey & only a few tablespoons of ketchup.  I sprinkled the chicken w/ a little garlic powder before pouring the sauce over it.  It was perfect ready & tender in 45 minutes.  It made a lot of sauce so I actually threw some more chicken breasts in the pan w/ the leftover sauce & baked another pan for later.  My family loved it--we will definitely make again!

I baked this at 375 for 45 minutes, uncovered for the last 20 minutes. The sauce wasn't all that thick, but the chicken was still tasty.  I had to baste it several times and then poured some additional sauce over the chicken when served.  I'd be curious how to get the sauce to stick to the chicken.  Thanks for the recipe - I'll try this again!

Good flavors - blend well together. Certainly makes more sauce than you need! I served with roasted red potatoes that had a BBQ-type seasoning. It was wonderful! And...the chicken, potatoes, and corn (with a little chili powder seasoning tasted wonderful in a salad of leftovers!

Excellent ... however I found that there was plenty of sauce for just four chicken breasts. Next time, I'll cut the sauce by half.

This is a keeper. I did take the other reviewers suggestion and cut the recipe so that I had 1 cup of sauce total and uncovered it for about the last 20 minutes. I added crush red pepper flakes to accompany the sweetness of the honey. Easy stuff! Thanks!

I'm sorry, but for me, there was too much sauce and honey.
I don't know if I cooked it in a wrong way, but the sauce and chicken were separated after cooking.

My husband loved this and couldn't stop raving about it. I give it five stars for simplicity but for the taste, it was a little too sweet for me (however I did use a very sweet tasting bbq sauce). Other than the sweet taste, it was delicious. I'll try this one again using a spicy bbq sauce as many others have suggested. Thanks!

This is a GREAT recipe! At first I wasn't sure what to think...ketchup, honey and bbq sauce doesn't sound all that spectacular. However, the chicken was juicy and the flavors were awesome! My 5 year old who hates everything ate every bite on his plate! I've made this twice once with Bulls-Eye Original and once with Bulls-Eye Spicy Original and my family loved both but I agree you should steer away from excessively sweet sauces.

I will definitely make again. I used 5 large chicken breasts, 45 mins. & took foil off for 15 mins, but next time I will cut back on tine. Also sauce was a little thin so I will use some corn starch to thicken as I saw in a review.  Excellent recipe.

I seasoned my chicken with salt, pepper, garlic powder and paprika. I used 6 chicken breast halves. I didn't use ketchup and instead used BBQ sauce. Turned out to be yummy.

Easy, quick and tasty!  I think the trick might be  using a BBQ sauce that isn't too sweet.  I used a Sriracha Roasted Garlic BBQ sauce. There was plenty of sauce and it tasted great on the roasted broccoli and mashed (with butter and salt only) sweet potatoes I made with it

First try with this recipe, I followed the instructions verbatim, and the chicken stayed soft and juicy, which is always good, but next time I might marinate the chicken in the bbq sauce/honey mixture for a few hours beforehand to enhance the flavor. I was not a huge fan of how watery the sauce ended up after the bake came out of the oven. Next time I might try adding different seasonings to the sauce mixture/marinade.

I reduced honey to 1/2 cup and used half of a sweet onion, sliced.  Since the sauce was rather runny, I decided to thicken it with 1tbsp corn starch mixed with 1 tbsp water.  I put just the sauce in a saucepan, added the cornstarch liquid; heated to a boil and cooked until thickened.

Everyone really enjoyed this recipe.  The picky eaters could easily avoid the onions.  Will certainly make this again and will give the recipe to my son as he moves into his college apartment.

Super easy. Great meal to make on a busy week day. My only complaint is the sauce was a tad too runny for my liking. Maybe it was just the brand of BBQ sauce I used?

I'm a vegetarian, so I'm not used to making chicken dishes. But the boyfriend wanted wings so I had to come through. Went out and bought "drummetts" which I guess is a combo of wings and drumsticks?
I followed this recipe (kind of). I'm the type of person who doesn't exactly measure things. I used  about 1/2-3/4 cup honey bbq sauce, about 1/4 cup of honey and 1/4 cup of ketchup. I drizzled in some Sriracha and put one drop of my boyfriend's "Mad Dog" super hot hot sauce. I used about 1/4 of an onion and honestly that was more than enough. I cooked at 400 for about 40 minutes covered and then cooked for about 10 uncovered. He said they were tender and cooked to perfection! He said I have to make them again. So I guess I will. These were delicious and easy to make! Thanks!

Husband loved it. Less time in the oven! We like our chicken moist, and an hour was too long with the chicken a little frozen. I suggest 45 minutes with fully thawed chicken.

Rated it a five star cause it was a great, simple & quick  recipe. Little supervision was required while cooking. My husband really loved it and even had the leftovers.  As per previous reviews I did cut back on honey and dropped temp a bit so I was sure that the chicken was cooked through. Also wrapped chicken in non-stick foil with sauce  so clean up was easy.

Really good! I added some pineapple bits on top of the chicken after I poured the sauce on. Then I baked it and it turned out delicious. Seeing as how honey is added in addition to the honey BBQ sauce, next time I am going to try using regular BBQ sauce to make it a little less sweet.

Extremely easy to make especially since these are ingredients people are highly likely to already have at home--bonus. I didn't have an onion though, so I used 3 tsp of onion powder instead. My boyfriend said it was delicious and he "[doesn't] even like chicken" that much. lol My 4 year  old tasted it and said "Yum!" I will definitely make this a regular at our house.

My husband liked the flavor and I liked the quick prep. I did not cook the full 45 min but checked at 30, basted with the sauce and kept cooking until all my side dishes were ready. I will definitely make it again.

Made this tonight and thought it was delicious. I used Open Pit bbq sauce because I didn't want if too sweet.  I only used half of a medium sized onion and that was plenty. I also added one chopped garlic clove to the sauce and seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper before putting it in the oven.  Cooked for 35 minutes covered and uncovered for last 10 minutes and it was done. Chicken came out very tender and sauce was tasty. Next time I think I need to thicken sauce a little before serving. Like other reviewers said this recipe makes a lot of sauce.

Because I originally planned to fry the chicken breasts, I marinated them in buttermilk overnight,  which I always do to tenderize the meat. After finding this recipe, I took the buttermilk coated chicken, added seasonings and baked with 1 cup BBQ sauce and the remaining ingredients as listed.  Raves from my guests at how tender and tasty it was! Will definitely make again!

I used some of the suggestions in the reviews: 3/4 c. sweet baby ray's bbq, 1/2 c. catsup, and 1/4 c. honey.  My family gobbled it up and asked for more. The breasts I used were quite large, next time I will butterfly them to reduce cooking time.

I don't think the directions are right. I cooked it with halved chicken breasts just like the instructions said, and it was definitely well done and a bit dry, even though it was swimming in too much sauce. I had to thicken the sauce before I put the leftovers in the fridge.

This was really easy and very good.  Chose it because I didn't want to have to go to store and had all ingredients on hand except for onion.  Used shallot and green onion combo.  Jeff loved.

I loved it's simplicity. I salt and peppered it before putting mixture on it. Came out good. I agree with another reviewer that you open up foil wrap and bake a little longer to caramelize.  I didn't mind the ketchup;  but on 2nd try I omitted it.  Thanks for a nice recipe and keeper!

I tried this and it turned out good but too sweet for my family. I did use sweet bbq so that's prob why. I think with regular bbq sauce and less honey it would be perfect! I baked like it said for 45 mins but I put it back in the oven uncovered for 5 more mins. The chicken turned out very moist.

I made this for the first time tonight as i was craving something bbq. This turned out great for me!! i was a little hesitant with the honey as the bbq sauce i had on hand was a sweet flavor but it had some spice to it so turned out just fine. Baked for 30 min covered then uncovered for the remaining ten to get a nice glaze on the chicken. Will most definitely use this recipe again!!

I made it and it came out fantastic!! My kids loved it, especially my 5yr and he's picky to the extreme. Thanks so much for this  recipe, makes lousy cooks like me look good, lol.  I would totally  make this again and have.  I did however use a sweet&spicy BBQ sauce instead of the honey BBQ it called for. The amount of sauce I ended up with was a lot when I followed the recipe. So I just saved what was left after baking and froze it for use next time. Which for me, worked out wonderfully since I'm pressed for time.

My family isn't big on onions and I'm not big on ketchup so I only used 3/4 cup of ketchup and 1/2 of an onion. That adjustment made it perfect for us! It was such a hit that I'm thinking of trying the mixture on porkchops.

Delicious! I used sweet baby rays BBQ my son's favorite and less onion just because I knew my kids would not like it. I removed the foil for the last 5 minutes as PETRIE27 recommended.Quick and easy!

This was tasty. I doubled the sauce as suggested. Also, I always rub my chicken with seasonings- garlic powder, onion powder and pepper. FYI, use a shallow pan to cook this. I used a Pyrex dish and the excess sauce just laid there and didnt thicken.. it was pointless to double the sauce lol. Overall, it was really good and super easy!

well, mine was kinda soupy, and the cook time dried the chicken out. I might look through some other reviews and see if I an change it up a bit.  Wasn't awful, so I think I can rework it to our family's taste. :)

I made this recipe today.  My husband gave me a 7 out of 10...  reason being - although he really liked the sauce - the chicken didn't have enough flavour inside.
Funny enough I marinated the chicken breasts for 4 hours before cooking - however, it didn't seem to be enough to encourage the flavour to penetrate.   Next time I will cut into the breasts or poke them with a fork.   Otherwise it was a great recipe.

Made this last night and was just yummmmmy!
Only put 1/2Cup honey. Would not do anything different. Easy, quick and great tasting! I did take foil off last 5-10 min to coat chicken and thicken sauce, worked wonderful.

We loved this recipe!  I did use a 'spicy and bold' BBQ sauce which gave it a super tangy kick.  The chicken was well cooked, very moist and tender!  Just pour your sauce over your chicken on the plate to take in the spices and flavor.  Not hard to prepare at all!

I actually added 1/2 tsp of dry mustard and 1 clove of minced garlic to the barbecue sauce mixture. I also pre-seasoned my chicken with crushed black pepper and seasoned salt (not too much) on both sides. Turned out great, everyone wanted seconds!  Great recipe.

Chicken was tough.  Probably a better recipe to stick in the crock pot.  I did use the thick, meaty breasts, so that may have had something to do with it.  I was expecting the chicken to fall apart and that just wasn't the case.

This was ok, although easy for a weeknight meal.  I only made two chicken breasts, and 45mins seemed like too long of bake time as they turned out a little dry.  Probably only need to do 30min next time.  And I followed the recipe exactly, just used a honey bbq sauce (Sweet Baby Rays).

Used 1 lb of precut chicken tenders. Cooked at 375 for 40 min. then uncovered for 10 min. more.  Did not add any honey and used less ketchup. Was very good and moist.

Kids loved this BBQ chicken!  Super easy to make and quick prep makes this a keeper.  Only thing different I did was season both sides of the chicken with salt and pepper before adding the BBQ sauce.  Next time I make this I am going to uncover the chicken in the last 10 minutes to thicken up the sauce (per another reviewer).

This was absolutely delicious! When the chicken was done, the meat fell off the bone it was juicy and flavorful. My husband loves chicken and he said he loved it!!!

Very good.  I will make this again and next time, I'll definitely remove the foil to thicken up the sauce.

I am only giving this a 3 because it lacks something... I can't figure out what it is. Maybe its too much honey? Seems too sweet for my tastes. Maybe next time I will use less honey and a bolder BBQ sauce. Using any type of sweet BBQ sauce will make this too sweet for sure. Good starting recipe though.

Pretty good, might want to marinate it for a little longer to get the sauce through the entire chicken.  Very good recipe!

We had this for dinner last night and for me it was just "ok".  It may have been a little too sweet for chicken.  I'll keep this recipe around though because it was incredibly easy to throw together.  Next time I'll experiment with different flavors of bbq sauce.  Last night we used Famous Dave's Sweet and Zesty.

It was only okay for us; I felt like I needed something more. I shredded the meat and made myself a sandwich with the leftovers and I liked it much better than I did last night, though.

This recipe actually surprised me.  It was really moist and good.  I found it during a desperate attempt to quickly find something for dinner because I forgot to plan one.  I just happened to have the ingredients on hand and it worked out perfectly.  I am giving it 5 stars because it was a great, easy meal that can easily be thrown together!

My family liked this recipe. And the kids don't like BBQ sauce. I used 1-2 Tbsp. dried onion and it was fine. I will make it again. Super Easy! I took others advice by uncovering this for 5 minutes at the end.

Excellent!  The sauce is very good and I used it over mashed potatoes also as it made lots and I didn't want to let one drop of it go to waste.

Made this chicken for dinner guests last night and everybody liked it.  Was a cinch to make and tasted better than the usual bottled BBQ. Will be making it again, thanks for the great recipe!

I LOVED this chicken!  It was so easy and really good!!  I used honey barbecue sauce instead of buying the honey and the barbecue sauce separately.

This was okay for a weeknight dinner. I had to omit the onion since my husband doesn't like it, but I added some onion powder instead. I didn't see much difference between this sauce and regular barbecue sauce. Maybe it would taste better on grilled chicken?
