I am rating this a 5, but I don't use cheese when I make my pepperoni rolls/bread. You can also use frozen bread rolls to make individual ones. And, before putting in the oven brush with a beaten egg & milk for a nice shiny color on top.

We've been making this for many years to rave reviews.  Our slight differences are: roll like a jelly roll (and seal ends and seam) instead of folding, and the addition of a generous handful each of chopped onion and green pepper to the filling.

Excellent.  Everyone loved it.  Added Italian Seasoning to the cheese and sprinkled parmesan cheese on the top before baking.

So easy and nice presentation for dinner parties or to take as an appetizer for a potluck!  I do add a few changes:I sprinkle a small amount  of italian seasoning to the filling, and I roll the dough like a jelly roll.  I then spread egg white over the top of the dough for a nice, shiny and golden look.  Perfecto!

This was really good. I added a little bit of sauce, Italian seasoning and some parmesan. Very easy to make and very quick. It was a little greasy so it might be better to use turkey pepperoni.

I made this New Year's Eve and it must have been really good because I didn't even get to sample it. Hubby raved about it.

Good! We've brought it a few times it is always good!
I increased it to three 11 oz French bread rolls the tube kind in the refrigerated section. I haven't found one pound loaves but three 11 oz loaves is the same amounts as doubling the recipe, it makes three smaller loaves instead of two. I followed some reviewers suggestions and added a few more.
15 oz pepperoni slices - microwave first 30 seconds by
spreading them out not touching on a paper towel and blot grease. Then divide pepperoni for the 3 loaves.
(3) - 11 oz french bread loafs - carefully unroll into  flat sheets on parchment paper.
32 oz (4c.) cheese divided for the 3 loaves
layer 1/2 (2.5oz)the pepperoni for one loaf in the middle third of dough sheet layer 2/3 cup cheese. Repeat 1/2 (2.5 oz) pepperoni for one loaf and 2/3 cup cheese. Sprinkle with Italian seasoning, and fold and seal edges.
Brush with egg whites.
Bake seam side down.
Bake each loaf 375 for 25 - 35 minutes

I found this to be a little lacking in flavor, even though I put the olive oil on the dough prior to layering and sprinkled chopped garlic and a little oregano.

This recipe has been in my family for many, many years. It's made when we have outings or days at the shore or even when we just want something simple to eat. I changed the way my mom did it by adding garlic powder and onion powder to the dough before layering the cheese and pepperoni. At one point I came across a garlic paste that if I melt down a bit, when the loaf is rolled I brush the melted garlic on top in a thin layer. Our family enjoys alot of garlic so we're not shy with it!

My sister-in-law makes this whenever we gather at their house.  It is so good and there is never any left.  She also uses ham in place of the pepperoni or just cheese, or turkey pepperoni.  She never makes just one!

Was good. Used frozen pizza dough, next time will make from scratch. Probably needs a bit of garlic powder in it for some flavor, but everyone said it was good!

I added some Italian Seasoning after the olive oil is brushed on.  This disappeared before I could get it to the table!

Got lots of compliments on it.  I added a couple things.  I did the egg wash and then sprinkled garlic and sea salt on top.  Pretty much the only change I made.  Baked up beautifully. Everyone loved it

I added hot pepper rings.  Fabulous.  Be sure to drain them on a paper towel.  Also used turkey pepperoni.  Not sure I'll use it again.  Kind of flavorless but the hot rings helped.  Good recipe.

I made this a few weeks ago and it went over very well.  I added some crumbled, browned sausage to give it a little more zing.  It baked up very well and I plan to make it again for an appetizer for Thanksgiving.

Really good.  I used two sheets of pizza dough and sealed the edges because I couldn't find bread dough.  Sprinkled parmesan cheese on top.  Each baked strip was cut in half afterwards and those strips would be perfect for dipping in marinara sauce which I'll try next time.

It is very good. Just make sure to thaw the frozen dough for several hours. Im not used to using frozen dough, so I mistakenly thought four hours would be good enough. It was still tough to work with. Second go round I put it in the fridge overnight and then set out, it was much better.

I made this today for a graduation party.  It was gone in 5 minutes, and neither my husband or I got to taste it. I'm assuming it must have been really good!
