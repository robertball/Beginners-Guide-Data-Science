I really liked the cinnamon/clove/celery seed combo. A very different way to have asparagus and quite tasty. Like another reviewer, I felt it was better with a bit of salt. I also discovered I don't really care for cold asparagus, so I recommend room temp as suggested in the recipe description.

I brought this to a potluck and there were no leftovers of this dish.  I didn't have the celery seed but added a pinch of cayene.  Delicious.

This dish was so simple and I impressed all my foodie friends.  Dish was emptied well before dinner finished.  Unexpected taste won't let you stop eating them.
