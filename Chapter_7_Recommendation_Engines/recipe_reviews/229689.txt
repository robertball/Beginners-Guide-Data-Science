We all enjoyed it but I think I might add a bit of brown sugar next time. I didn't have any teriyaki sauce (isn't that what soy sauce and Mirin makes) so just upped those two ingredients.

I had to add an additional 20 minutes baking time but, other than that, I have found a new favorite! My daughter in law is my toughest critic and I got high praise from her! This recipe is a keeper!

This was a very nice marinade!  I would love to try it on some chicken as well.  Thanks!
