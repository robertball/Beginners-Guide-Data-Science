I'm going to divulge the secret to making this to perfection... ready??? Follow this recipe exactly and DO NOT CHANGE A THING! It is fantastic and super easy too. I did not add any frosting and feel there is no need for it; the cake was moist and delicious without being overly sweet. Also, by using the pumpkin puree you are really getting quite a bit of fiber in your dessert. Great tasting AND somewhat good for you too. This is my new favorite cake. Thanks to doxie1 for submitting this one! Excellent!!!

This is delicious.  I baked it in a bundt pan and added 2 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice and one teaspoon of good quality cinnamon, instead of the ginger/cinnamon mix.  Next time I will also add raisins and maybe a few less walnuts.  I also added only 2/3 cup of oil and will probably only add no more than 1/2 cup the next time I make it.  Pumpkin makes the cake very moist so it definitely doesn't need so much oil.  Delicious!

What a great spice cake recipe.  I made it just as directed, only added a couple more shakes of cinnamon and a couple shakes of nutmeg.  It could be a little spicier, but I made for guests so I think it's perfect for the occasion.  Made in a bundt pan, baked for about 45 minutes.  Frosted with homemade cream cheese icing...pulled out a little frosting and put green food coloring in it.  Put orange food coloring in the rest of the icing, then spread the orange icing all over the cake.  Put an edible ice-cream cup (that kids eat ice-cream out of) in the hole of the bundt cake and frosted that green.  Piped some green stripes down the side and 'voila!!!!  Made a literal pumpkin cake that looks like one too!!!  Had just enough  batter left over to make a couple of mini-loaves and that's what I just ate...it is awesome.  I saw where some reviewers messed with the amount of oil but I think it's perfect!!!

Given that many GREAT pumpkin bread recipes call for a can of pumpkin, 4 eggs and 1 cup of oil, unlike most other reviewers of this recipe I did not reduce the amount of oil.  I prepared it as written, with one cup oil and was quite pleased with the delicious result.  I did, however, make a few other minor modifications.  First, I used a French Vanilla cake mix which I always prefer over yellow any day of the week - it has less of that artificial cake mix taste yellow cake mixes are so notorious for.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla, again to camouflage that tell-tale cake mix taste and, rather than the spices called for,  I used a "one serving" recipe of "Pumpkin Pie Spice I," recipe also from this site.  I confess I don't know what the baking soda was for - I did add it, but I'm sure the cake would not have been compromised without it.  I added 1/2 cup of raisins to the batter, but not the pecans.  I baked it in a Bundt pan at 350 degrees, about 55 minutes.  When cool, I glazed it with a cream cheese glaze: 4 ozs. cream cheese, 1/2 c. powdered sugar, 1 tsp. vanilla and 3 T. half-and-half.  Finally, to pretty it up a bit, I sprinkled it with chopped pecans. This is a beautiful and nicely spiced pumpkin cake, made easy and quite satisfactorily with a humble cake mix.

I took another's advice and cut down the oil to 1/2 and substituted 1/2 cup applesause to make up 1 cup.  EXTREMELY moist.  Next time I may onit oil entirely and use only applesauce.  Everyone loved the cake!

I'm generally a terrible cook, but this cake came out wonderfully! I made it in two 9" round pans instead of the 9X13" and it was great. My fiance said it was "killer"!!  It keeps well for several days and stays super moist the whole time!

THIS IS THE BEST PUMPKIN CAKE!!  My search has ended for a good pumpkin cake recipe.  My mom was craving something pumpkin so instead of making pumpkin bread i chose this recipe.  This is so moist and deeeelicious!  I only used 3/4 c. of oil and i added 1 tsp. of nutmeg to the spices and also added 1 c. of raisins.  Watch your oven b/c my cake was done in about 35 minutes for a 13x9.  I frosted with cream cheese frosting but i know it is as delicious without icing b/c i have had to make this twice already in 3 days (and it is June!).  This was gone in a matter of minutes everyone simply devoured it.  Everyone i have made this for simply LOVES this cake.  I will not wait til Thanksgiving to make pumpkin cake again.
Thank you Beverly =)

This recipe was great! I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. I used a moist supreme cake mix, substituted chopped apples for the nuts, and added a bit of clover. I made miniature bundt cakes and used cream cheese frosting. I will make them again for Christmas!

VERY moist.  I did decrease the oil to 1/2 cup.  My cupcake liners were fairly greasy even still so I image that adding the full cup would just be too oily.  I also added nutmeg and allspice with the cinnamon and ginger.

This is so good it was almost  kind of silly. Wow. I made it exactly as written except I beat the batter by hand and baked it in a mini loaf pan. It made four lovely little loaves when cooked at 375 degrees for 35 minutes. I will be making this again. Thank you.

This is a great Fall cake.  I bake it in a bundt pan and then drizzle with cream cheese icing. I double the spices so it is really spice-y!

This cake is so moist and delicious! I have made it several times, and it is always such a hit! I only use 1/2 cup of oil, and then either another 1/2 cup of pumpkin or a 1/2 cup of applesauce, and it always turns out amazing! We serve it warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream! Yum!

Hands down the best cake ever!!!  Followed others advice and used half the oil called for and replaced the rest with cinnamon applesauce.  Added extra spices, and replaced the pecans with apples.  I served this at a bday party and the look on peoples faces said it all.  Will make this again and again!!!!

Delicious and very easy.  Took the advice of fellow reviewers and substituted 1/2 cup apple sauce for oil and added in a few sprinkles of pumpkin pie spice and ground nutmeg.  Came out beautifully.  Also only baked for about 35 min instead of the 45 min listed in directions.

These smell amazing while they're baking. I took the advice of only adding 1/2 cup of oil, and my cupcakes were perfectly moist. I added 1/8 teaspoon each of ground cloves and nutmeg, but next time I think I'll add a full 1/4 teaspoon each and maybe another teaspoon of cinnamon as well. These weren't spicy enough for how I like my pumpkin baked goods.

I used this for a birthday cake.  Baked in an 11x17 cookie sheet, cut in 1/2 and then cut into layers (4 layers total) iced with cream cheese and decorated.
It has excellent flavor.

Made this for a potluck and it turned out yummy.  I used Splenda for baking and half applesauce and half oil.  Soaked raisins in orange juice and only put the nuts on top of cream cheese frosting.  Will definetly put in my "keeper" file.

This was a great recipe for a moist and delicious cake.  I used a pinch of nutmeg, 1/2c oil, 1/2c applesauce and splenda instead of sugar.  No one could tell the difference.  This recipe is definalty a keeper!

I took the advice of other reviewers and only used 1/2 c oil . . . perfect!  Anymore would have made it too moist.  For spices, I used 2 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice and one teaspoon of cinnamon.  I only baked for 35 minutes in a 9X13 pan.  This is a great recipe for the fall.  It's foolproof and doesn't take long to prepare.  I will be making this one for years to come!

this is a great, easy recipes.  I have made it in a regular 13x9 cake pan with caramel drizzle, cupcakes w cream cheese frosting, or as a bundt w/ vanilla glaze.  It always comes out perfectly moist and fluffy, make sure you mix for the full 4 minutes

Delicious. I had just put my baby down for a nap when I realized I didn't have enough white sugar so I used 1/4 cup white, 1/4 cup brown sugar and it tasted fine. I also added a couple dashes of nutmeg and reduced the oil from 1 cup to 1/2 cup because the oil where I live tastes funny (China) and I didn't want that to impact the overall taste of the cake. I made 2 9-inch round cakes and frosted it with cinnamon cream cheese frosting. It was very light and fluffy and rose very well (maybe thanks to the baking soda).

I made this recipe and it was delicious! Instead of yellow cake mix, use Spice cake mix and you can omit cinnamon, ginger unless you like it really spicey. Very good with coffee or milk.

I've never been one to like those who change a recipe and rate... but this time I'm going to do it.  This recipe needs 1 tbsp oil - not a cup!  It's still incredibly moist.  I did also add nutmeg (1/2 tsp) and cloves (1/4 tsp).  It's a fabulous cake - I think I just ate half of it myself in the last 30 minutes.

This is one pumpkinlicious cake! I frosted it with "Cream Cheese Frosting II" from this site and I am very pleased with the results! I followed the recipe exactly with the exception that my cake was done in 35 minutes. Thanks for a great recipe :)

Delicious! I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit. My husband had three pieces before we even got to our family! Everyone raved about this.
I cut this up and served it as pumpkin bread, not really as a cake. I also added a bit of pumpkin pie spice to the batter.
I will make this over and over again.

This is a wonderful recipe!  I've made it several times already with all different flavors of cake mixes.  I've used cinnamon, spice, and carrot cake.  Everyone like the carrot cake the best with caramel frosting!  This recipe is a definite keeper!

I thought the recipe tasted very good, especially with the icing on top of the cake. My mom loved it and she's not a pumpkin person. I will make it again for xmas!

Is easy enough and tastes pretty good, but does need the cream cheese frosting.  I wouldn't serve it without frosting.

This is one fantastic cake. Tastes like pumpkin roll without the work. I subbed splenda for the sugar and will try the oil, applesauce thing next time. Kept great. Took it to work and it was gone in an instant and everyone wanted the recipe.

Delicious. They made nice cupcakes frosted with cream cheese icing. It's true that pumpkin haters will like these. I told my husband that they were spice cupcakes and he loved them and looked surprised when I told him they were pumpkin! I ran out of ginger so I used pumpkin pie spice. Ginger would have been even better.

I made this cake last month for my Dad's birtday!  It was yummy!  To make it a little heart healthier for him and my mom I substituted applesauce for the oil and used 5 (I think) egg whites and one whole egg.

I used a Betty Crocker spice cake mix and  the other ingredients as directed, even the cinnamon but increased the sugar to 3/4 Cup.  I also add 1/2 teaspoon of allspice.  It was delish, moist and very pretty!

Followed recipe exactly and it was delicious.  My daughter is NOT a pumpkin fan and she dove into it after I made her try it.  Cake was gone in 3 days - I plan on making for Thanksgiving as one of my desserts.  I did use a cream cheese topping and then added chopped pecans on top!

We had this cake tonight and loved it.  I always use egg beaters in place of eggs and cut the oil in half, replacing it with unsweetened applesauce.  I did not add the nuts and instead replaced them with raisins. I used a bunt pan and baked at 350 for 52 minutes.  Very dense and super moist; we will have this again at the holidays.

This was great! I did use 1/2 c and 1/2 c applesauce. The cake was very moist and not too pumpkin-y. Instead of all the different spices I used 2-1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice and my cream cheese frosting and baked it in a bundt pan. Even my picky 6-year-old liked it and asked for seconds.

This recipe was excellent...I am not a baker, love to cook gourmet, etc., and never follow a recipe, accept in baking.  Found a Halloween cake mix that was orange and had cocoa swirls in it, I was looking for a cake with pumpkin in it so it was the perfect Holiday treat.  Topped it with cream cheese frosting, chocolate sprinkles and orange sugar crystals..the chocolate sprinkles melted into the cream cheese frosting that looked like chocolate swirls on top.  ENJOY!

Awesome! I did make a few tiny changes. I didn't have enough pumpkin leftover so I used some pureed squash that I had. I also replaced half the oil with some fruit baby food and agave nectar with the sugar. I also added a touch more spice. I didn't have any frosting either so I made up a streusal topping with butter, brown sugar and oats. Turned out very moist and delicious!! I loved how it got white patches from the lumps of cake mix too....very pretty.

Very tasty! I made this for Christmas and it was a big hit. I followed another commenter's suggestion and only used half the oil and it came out just about perfect. Very moist. One thing, though, My cake was done in like 20 minutes, not the 45 minutes the recipe says. I don't know if it was my oven or not,  but check your cake often! I came very close to burning mine.

Very good, moist cake. 

Substituted 1/2 C applesauce and 1/2 C oil instead of all oil like the suggestions. May omit oil completely next time.

My husband liked, but I didn't see anything special so that is why it got the 4.  He used an orange glaze for a topping which brought out the flavor more.  Without the glaze I thought you could taste the artifical taste of the cake mix.  I used the raisins as suggested & would again.  Bake time was about 35 min so don't over bake.

Loved this cake. I subbed the ginger for pumpkin pie spice and did a simple powdered sugar, milk and vanilla frosting. I also left out the pecans. Cake was very moist and i think it would be good with raisins in it.

Yummy!!! I also did 1/2 cup oil, extra cinnamon (1/2 tsp), used egg substitute and only used about 1 cup of pumpkin. It is so good, spicy and light. Definitely will make for Thanksgiving.

A fast and easy cake to put together. Will add this recipe to my favorites list and make often.  Instead of using 1 whole cup of vegetable oil I used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup of water.  The cake was moist and light.

This is so delicious and made the entire house so fragrantly scented. It was too large for two of us to consume, so I cut it into four sections and froze the other three.

I made this cake for my father-in-law's birthday and it has become a family favorite. 
The cake is so moist from the pumpkin and the cream cheese frosting is the perfect touch.

I made this exactly as written. It is so yummy! Moist & light with great pumpkin spice flavor. I added a cream cheese glaze, dyed orange for Halloween. 4oz cream cheese (softened), 2 cups powdered sugar, about 1/4 cup of milk, 1tbs of butter (softened)  & added orange gel food coloring. Drizzled over the cake. It honestly didn’t need a glaze but I wanted it more Halloween themed for a party

Wow! Made a few changes. I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil, didn’t have pecans so I used walnuts & added raisins. Oh & double the ginger!

This is very easy to make. It's very moist and tasty. Next time I might throw in some chocolate chips...I added tsp almond extract  to powdered sugar drizzle, takes it up a notch.

2016 - Made this for Thanksgiving and it was outstanding as is!!! Only ~trivial change~ was substituting walnuts for pecans on the cream cheese frosting drizzled bundt cake version of this recipe (simply because I love healthy walnuts).  Next time I may try walnut oil instead of vegetable oil. Love the way this very easy recipe makes me look like I bake!

Five stars! Tastes great, easy to make, seasonal/festive, this cake has it all.  This will go into my box of go-to recipes.  I used coconut oil instead of vegetable but that was the only change I made.  We loved this.

People, you have to try this recipe.  It is easy, delicious  and with Thanksgiving coming, it would be perfect.  Reading some of the other comments, the only change I made was to bake my 9x13 for 35 minutes.  I doubled Naples recipe for her Bundt cake cream cheese frosting.  Thank You for this recipe.

Like others I used spice cake mix, did not add any spices,1/2 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of applesauce. I iced it with the bourbon cream cheese frosting on this site. Three deserts where brought to a chef prepared dinner and this recipe was the hit!

This cake recipe was very moist and had great flavor.  I used a spice cake mix since that's all I had and added 1/2 cup of raisins.  I made cupcakes and baked them for 20 minutes.  Frosted them with Maple Cream Cheese Frosting from this site.  Very yummy, will make again.  Great recipe for a quick cake!
