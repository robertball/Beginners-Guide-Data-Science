I always make this sauce for St. Patrick's Day.  It is soo delicious!  I don't change a thing, and be sure you follow the part calling for whisking it in the bowl above boiling water for the designated amount of time.  It's a creamy deliciousness that you will probably end up spooning over cabbage, potatoes, and carrots.  And no one will tell if you lick the spoon!

I did make few changes...steeped a dozen juniper berries in the vinegar (discarded the berries before using the cooled vinegar), substituted sour cream for the cream, and added a few dashes of pepper.  Next time I make it I'll add a bit of horseradish.

It's a lengthy process of stirring. Like a traditional hollandaise recipe, but it does taste very good. That said I haven't served it cold withy spiral cut ham yet.

This was extremely good. I never have been too stringent about exact measurements, so threw in what I thought was about the right amounts of everything- just divinely creamy and moreish!
Going to make a tub full for future use.

8.1.16   In a word, EXCELLENT!  This sauce can be served so many ways,  but today, I enjoyed it on a grilled German bratwurst.  I'd recommend you cook this sauce over simmering water (not boiling), otherwise, you'll end up with a saucepan of scrambled eggs.  Also, this won't take 20 minutes, it comes together pretty quickly.
