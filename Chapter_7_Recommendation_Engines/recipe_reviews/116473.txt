I love this recipe! Instead of the cream cheese icing. I used 1/2C. powdered sugar ,2Tbs.milk, and about 2Tbs.marmalade; till it's a creamy texture.

the marmalade i used was reduced sugar,
so they were not very sweet...my mistake.
im thinking of trying these with lemon curd next time.

Not tastey.   Tried one and threw the rest away.  The muffin was bland and the icing was really runny.  Even after extra confection sugar was added it was still runny.  Not worth making.

Love this recipe.  Muffins were very moist.  I made a glaze from confectioners sugar (~1/3 cup), a heaping tablespoon of marmalade, a dash of almond extract and 1/2 tsp. half and half.  Delish!

Terrible.  More like a cupcake than a muffin.  Too sweet and the icing was very drippy.  Even my kids, who love sweets, wouldn't eat them!!  I put one star because I had to put one.  I wouldn't have put any stars.

The texture of these was almost rubbery. I don't know why, I was careful not to overmix the batter.

I found these muffins to be extremly dry and the marmalde all went to the bottom of the muffins.

Maybe next time I will add more marmalade...
