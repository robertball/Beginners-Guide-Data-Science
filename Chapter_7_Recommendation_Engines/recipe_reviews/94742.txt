Moist and tasty.  Only problem I had was the cherries all went to the bottom of the loaf.  Recommend highly

This was a tasty little recipe. To prevent cherries from sinking I tossed them in flour to coat them 'lightly' and then fold into batter. I learned this trick long ago and use it for any little goodie I'm adding to batter, ie; chips fruits, nuts, and it doesn't change the taste of the recipe. BTW, next time I might try adding some mini chocolate chips to this one. The great thing about recipes is that there is always something new to try to the old. It doesn't always work but sometimes you find a winner.

I also tossed cherries in a little bit of flour prior to folding them into the batter.  Those who have eaten some of this bread said it was very good.  I though it was ok but I am not a huge fan of pound cake so my opinion does not hold much value.  Not something I would put on my top 10 list but I will probably make again at holiday time.
