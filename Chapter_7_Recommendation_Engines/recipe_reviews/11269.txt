So good. The only thing I changed was I melted about 1/3 cup creamy PB with the chocolate chips and then spread over the bars. The PB adds a little "extra" and pushes these over the top IMO!

Just discovered these this week when the teacher at my son's nursery school had them make a batch.  (Testimony to how easy they are!) So sweet, so good.  Only difference was her recipe had her sprinkle the chocolate chips over the oat layer when it was still hot, then go back a few minutes later with a spatula and spread them out.  Fun to do, and one less bowl to clean.  As for the difficulty presenting: she refrigerated them, then broke them into pieces, sort of like almond bark.  One bite and we stopped caring what the heck  they looked like anyway.

Oh so good... I had make a second batch the next day because they went so fast.  Easy to whip up, too.  I like them chilled in the refrigerator. Mmmm....

I love Oatsies. They taste great and they're not even that bad for you.  I found if you use a 12 cup muffin pan and line with paper muffin cups it divides up perfectly with your 1/3C measuring cup.

I made this recipe today and everyone loved it It's very rich and a little goes a long way. I'm a chocolate lover but I didn't like the taste of the chocolate chips on top. The oat layer is soooo delicious, I could do without the chocolate. What!? Could this be possible that I can pass on the chocolate? Yep, it's true, that's how good the oat layer is. I plan on using this recipe again and again and maybe use chocolate frosting instead of the chocolate chips . Thanks for sharing this recipe.

These bars are so, so good.  I have been looking for this childhood favorite for a while.  Simple, but DELISH!!! I just put the chips on the bars after taking them out of the oven, instead of melting the chocolate separately.

OMG! This was soooo bad! The taste was really funky and it had a real bad consistency...it did not hold together well at all! I followed this recipe to the T and it still came out bad. I will never make this again!

Very good.  I made mine in greased muffin tins (made 16), and they came out beautifully.  I overdid it on the chocolate chips - a little goes a long way - the oats are so good, you don't want to overpower them.  In fact, I think you should be able to see the oats through the chocolate.  Also, just sprinkle them on when the first come out of the oven and spread (rather than melting them seperately) - it is so much easier!

Easy to make and so so delicious!  The oat layer is so good and only a thin layer of chocolate  is alll you need.  YUM.

I love the taste of these, and they are very easy / quick to make.  My only issue: they do not hold their shape well.  Great for eating at home, but I couldn't give as a gift.  Any suggestions on how to make them hold their shape would be appreciated!!  I tried adding 1/2 cup of flour, and 1 egg.  This revised batch came out very well, but did not quite have the rich flavor of the original recipe.  Thank you for sharing this treat :)

Wonderful old school recipe, thank you for posting.  I made these when my son was growing up and it was always one of his favs.  I lost the recipe and now that I have it again my grandkids can love it as much as their dad did.  only differences are coconut on top vs nuts and I don't melt the chocolate I simply sprinkle the chocolate chips on top when it is right out of the oven and as they melt I simply spread them.....easy peasy!

I made these the other day. They tasted ok but they were very difficult to remove from the pan. So Iwon't be making them again.

This was good, but just not great for me.  I liked it but probably wouldn't make again.  It just didn't WOW me, so I rated it 3 stars for an average tasting dessert.

Yum!  I made one batch with light corn syrup and one with dark.  I liked the light better, it was a little less sweet.  I put the oats/brown sugar in the pan I was going to cook the dish in and then pored the wet ingredients in and stirred.  This cut down on time and pots and it also greased the pan.  When it was done I put the chips on top and let them melt and spread.  My colleagues loved these and it was so easy to make.  Edges were crispy, inside was chewy.  I liked it crispy and next time I will cook longer.

I wish I could give this 100 stars!  This was a wonderful cookie I could make for my child who is allergic to wheat, egg, peanut and dairy (we substituted soy butter).  We didn't add the chocolate, the oatsies were sweet enough.  We used a silicon muffin tin to avoid shortening and to make round cookies.  It is very hard to find tasty, easy allergy friendly treats.  Thanks for submitting, you've made a toddler (and his mom) very, very happy!

The taste was great, but the texture seemed off. The bottom kept falling apart. If you make them, don't bother melting the chocolate separately. Just put the chips on the hot bars, and they will melt on their own.

MMMMMMMM!!!!! I followed the recipe EXCEPT I used 1/2 cup of molasses in place of the dark corn syrup. What a great flavor! I also put it in the freezer for about 15 minutes to cool.

Maybe my expectations were too high based on the wonderful reviews, but unfortunately, I didn't feel that these were anything special.  They're good, but not five star good in my opinion.  I scored them with a knife while they were still warm to make it easier to keep in bars after they had fully cooled.
