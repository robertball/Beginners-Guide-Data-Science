i doubled this recipe and placed in 9 by 13 inch pan.  it was excellent. next time, however, i would choose to cover the kugel with foil and remove foil about 10-15 minutes before serving, so that kugel will brown.

This was WONDERFUL! The whole family loved it. The recipe doesn't say crushed pineapple, but the directions mention it. I didn't use the sliced pineapple (forgot it) and nicely decorated the top w/ the cherries. On 1/2 of the kugel, I added raisins (1/2 the family likes raisins, the other half don't).  I used a 16 oz can of crushed pineapple and so glad I did- YUMMY! I also used more noodles than the recipe (about 2-3 oz more). I know it's supposed to be a side dish, but I used it as my dessert and it was a smash! ENJOY!

This was a nice lighter version of kugel.  I served it at a brunch where there were several kugels.  I noticed that this one was gobbled up and everyone finished their portion.  I think I will put it in a smaller dish next time.  I put foil on for the first thirty minutes but still some of the noodles seemed dry around the edges. A smaller dish may eliminate the dry edges.  I left off the cherries.

Kugel was really good! Everyone absolutely loved it. However, I did make a couple changes. I needed to make the kugel parve, so I used margarine instead of butter. I thought there was too much liquid in the  mixture so I used the whole 12 oz bag of pasta instead of 8oz. I will definately use this recipe again, but next time I will add golden raisins to add texture. Also, I will use pineapple tidbits instead of slices so that it is easier to cut  and every piece of kugel has pineapple.

I was looking for a typical (but good!) noodle kugel and this was it! I made it with LIGHT butter and it came out perfectly fine, I'm sure no one would be able to tell the difference. I also added raisins which were a good addition and will add them again next time I make it.  I'll probably also try it with egg substitute next time.

This was really good.  I used whole wheat egg noodles, 1/3 C. Agave nectar, and a little cornstarch to offset the extra moisture.  I didn't expect much, but loved it!

This was a really nice easy kugel.  I left out the cherries and the pineapple rings, and it was plenty sweet.

This has a very low key sugar flavor.  I sprinkled it with confectionary sugar to sweeten up the final product, but would probably add 1/4 cup or more of sugar if serving it as a dessert.  Beware of overcooking this; I checked it after 40 minutes and it was barely beginning to brown on top.  After another 10 minutes it was golden, but also overcooked, meaning the egg was shaggy and the noodles dried out.  Next time I will look for the middle to be set, instead of golden.  I was not going to add the sliced pineapple on top, but was glad I did, both for appearance and overall taste.  I substituted in whole maraschino cherries for the candied cherries and they worked fine.

First kugel I've made or had to eat. My kids loved it. I did add a pinch of salt to balance the sweetness from the pineapple. I'm bringing it to a potluck tomorrow so I hope it goes over well

This kugel turned out well, i added extra vanilla and cinnamon. 
I liked it but husband prefers the creamier version he grew up with.

I have never made a kugel before and have only eaten it once, but I made this for a gathering, and everyone liked it.  It was absolutely beautiful!  Since I doubled the recipe and baked it in a casserole dish, it took much longer to cook all the way through.  The bottom was then overdone, but the top tasted great!

This was amazing.  I didn't know exactly what to expect but it was great, the kids ate it up as did my super picky DH.  Will absolutely make this again.

I found this quite bland, and the sheer quantity of liquid required a long cook time. The kids liked it, though.

Loved it!  I thought 6 eggs sounded like alot, since I don't like the flavor of eggs too well.  But it was great.  The kids even ate this kugel.

I don't know how this compares to more rich kugels with cream cheese, etc. and even hesitated to review since perhaps I should leave it to those more familiar with the dish to consider authenticity. BUT I must say that this was very tasty!   It was light and delicious and definitely craveable!    I added more pineapple and will add even more next time and will consider topping it with no boil lasagna noodles that I will peel and discard.  Plus foil!I am hoping that will  help keep the noodles from getting hard on the edges and top.
