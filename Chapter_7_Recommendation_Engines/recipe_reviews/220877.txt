This turned out tasty but crumbly, and wouldn't hold together as bars. The mixture in the pan was very thick and sticky, too thick to boil. When it began to scorch on the bottom of the pan (I had it over low heat), I removed it from the stove. The thickness of it made it very difficult to distribute evenly through the toasted oat mixture. When that was finally accomplished, I pressed it into the pan and let it cool. It crumbled apart when I tried to cut it into bars, so now I have a very tasty granola. Not exactly what I had hoped for. I may try this again with coconut oil instead of coconut butter, to see if that improves things. I give it 3 stars for flavor.

Aloha,  
Yeah, the wet ingredients were too thick! Scorches easy!  I added more agave to moistenit, and next time will only use honey and agave to make this more moist and add no dry sugar. Used only almond butter and added about 1 and half tablespoons more. Setting up now.

the flavor is good. Does not hold together as bars but is excellent as a granola topping for yogurt.
