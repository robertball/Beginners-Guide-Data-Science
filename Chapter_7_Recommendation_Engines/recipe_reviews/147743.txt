I have some chicken breast on the fridge that I don't know what to do- then I saw Kraft video on making this easy chicken in creamy pan sauce- I quickly grabbed my chicken and cream cheese- added caper and chicken broth- it was really good and easy to make! I would definitely make this again- It is even better the next day- the cream cheese make it salty- so no need to add salt- I think a little bit of lemon would be great as well!

This was really good.  I added a dry packet of Italian Dressing and some onion powder.  I left the chicken in the broth to simmer for about 10 minutes with the Italian Dressing Packet and onion powder.  I also used a seasoning called "Slap Ya Mama", it adds a hot cajun kick to the dish.  Then I added the cream chease.  Good over noodles or rice.

This recipe wasn't bad but it wasn't all that good either. My family ate it and was polite. I added leaks and my sister liked those. It just wasn't anything special and really not worth making again.

I made a few small changes to the recipe. My husband and I both liked it though!  VERY FILLING. I sauted some onion before frying the chicken...Added some mushrooms before I made the "sauce"...Used a bit of sour cream and a small amount of cornstarch to thicken up the sauce. VERY GOOD. Kinda like chicken fried steak, only chicken fried chicken. I served it with mashed potatoes and cheesy beans!

I made this last night, and the sauce ruined the chicken! Although I am a big fan of cream cheese, this came out a runny mess. I thought the bits and chicken broth would add depth, but it still tastes like warm, melted cream cheese poured over chicken. This recipes was a waste of perfectly good chicken breasts. I was surprised too, because I usually love the recipes I try from the kraft magazine. Obviously, I won't be making this again!

I was looking for a creamy sauce for chicken when I came across this awesome recipe. I used chicken leg meat, as that is what I had on hand, it worked well. I added a little garlic, onion powder & pepper (as other reviewers suggested) and was sure to really break up the creamcheese... it was very tasty. My son liked it and said "You have to make this again" 

Given the ease & tasty results, I will definitely be adding this to my goto recipe list. Thanks for sharing!

Loved the recipe. I did add some extras to it. I added a sprinkle of garlic powder and onion powder to the flour mixture along with ground pepper then cooked it in the olive oil. I allowed it to brown very lightly and it was awesome. When the sauce was simmering I added some sun-dried tomatoes that enhanced the taste and gave it some color. Served with rice and broccoli and makes a great dish. Thanks for the recipe..

This was very good, I did make a few changes of my own. When melting the cream cheese I added garlic powder, pepper, onion powder(just a pinch) and chopped up red pepper. To top it off I used cilantro instead of parsley and a little bit of grated sharp cheddar. It was tasty, my fiance was raving about it all night! I went by the recipe for 2 servings, I think next time I will adjust the amounts, it could have used a little more cream cheese and oil.

Great base recipe. I didn't change it much. Added a chicken flavor booster and a packet of dry Italian seasoning. I let it simmer awhile so it thickened up nicely and served over wild rice. My picky family gobbled it up and asked for more. Next time I'm doubling the recipe for leftovers or cutting up the chicken into bite size pieces to serve in the sauce. Will definitely make again!!!

This is a really good base recipe. Almost anything can be added to it. I coated my chicken in flour with pepper, salt, garlic powder and onion powder. I then fried it as directed. I used homemade chicken broth, which I think makes a huge difference. I added some cut up zuccini to it (it is what I had) but I think any veggie would go good in the sauce. I diced up the chicken after it cooked and added that to the sauce and served over egg noodles. It was really good. If I followed the directions of the recipe I think it would be too bland, especially with a canned broth.

I made this and my whole family loved it. I added the whole package of an 8 ounce cream cheese and a little more chicken broth and seasoned my chicken with garlic, salt and pepper. This is easy to make just add mashed potatoes to spoon the sauce over.

I put a few of the chicken breasts in a Ziploc bag after I put in the flour and seasonings. I used garlic powder, onion powder, paprika and any other seasonings can be used that you like. After covering the chicken breasts with the flour mixture,  I followed the recipe exactly. It was very good and I would suggest to double the sauce to place on your chicken breasts and sides. I had some leftover stuffing and put the sauce on it after warming up. Thanks so much for the recipe!!!

So bland that it could have been made with water instead of sauce and it would have tasted better.  Your children will not like this, trust me.  Sauce "looks funny", "tastes funny", and that's coming from me, not from children.

Gosh, we thought this was great! Simple and easy to add your own modifications. I added lemon juice, a small amount of capers, garlic, chopped mushrooms and pepper when I made the sauce.hubby and I both loved it. I think it would be very good over pork as well. Will be keeping this recipe on hand for future use.

Have been making this for about 10 years when it appeared in a recipe book.  I add bacon bits to the sauce as it cooks, and also some grated Parmesan cheese (dry stuff in jar).  I always let it simmer for hour or so to let it thicken a bit.  I serve with a pasta, cutting up cherry tomatoes and sprinkling with more bacon and cheese.

Simple weekday dinner.  I added Italian seasoning, garlic powder, a tablespoon of lemon juice, a dash of lemon zest and a few sundried tomatoes. Served it with zucchini.  My husband loved it.

Great recipe!  I did read several reviews first to learn what others did to make it even better.  Here's my take: 
We like to spice all of our recipes up, the hubby doesn't like bland foods, so instead of using chicken broth as my liquid, I used 1 cup of Spicy Italian Dressing (store brand).  I did find that I needed to add a little water while I was stirring the sauce, I might have added 1/4 cup.  I also cut up a small onion into big chunks and added them to the pan when the chicken was about half done.  The sauce was still a little too thick, I'd probably try 1/2 - 1 cup water.  This turned out awesome!  It's a keeper for our house!  Served with rice (this is where I used the chicken broth) and green beans.  And, I'm eating very yummy leftovers for lunch Right Now!

I've made this a few times now. If I ran out of chicken broth, I just grabbed some white cooking wine and a little bit of heavy cream. Everything mixed together wonderfully!

I really liked this one.  It probably would have been a 4-star, but my kids really liked it and had seconds (surprisingly).  I did what some other reviewers said and added onions, garlic, and some spinach & herb dip mix.  I made a little more chicken with the same amount of sauce for the 4 servings.  I would make the appropriate amount of sauce next time because it was so good!

This was so easy to make a yummy dinner. I was surprised by the thickness of the sauce. Either I did something wrong or it was very thick. It seemed most of my broth evaporated before I got the cream cheese into it. Will make again. I like other people added a variety of spices to the flour (onion powder, pepper, garlic, and rosemary) then topped chicken with rosemary instead of parsley. Sides were mushrooms and onions and prosciutto wrapped asparagus. I also made two full chicken breasts for two of us and that was way too much. Next time I'll follow the servings for two instead of four. Thanks for a great recipe!

it was actually pretty good. Some alterations I made was: 1)I used fat free cream cheese and turned out yummy with less the calories. 2)I also added some mushrooms for some more flavor. 3) added some garlic salt with the flour for some flavor with the chicken

I used a vegetable infused chicken broth - that was the only change I made. I thought this was pretty good - I'd give it three stars except it was SO easy that I felt I had to give it another star; for the simplicity of it! Will def. make again!

I did add a little to this after reading the reviews. Used whole package of cream cheese. Added white wine to the broth before cream cheese was added. Also added some garlic, Italian seasonings and Tastefull Simple Spinach and Herb mix to the chicken as it cooked. Served it with rice...brown rice would be very good also. It turned out fantastic! Thanks

I made this last night and my husband and kids (2 and 3 years old) loved it! I made some minor changes- I added some extra chicked bullion to the water to give it a stronger taste, added some garlic, and more cream cheese after reading some of the other reviews.  I sprinkled the finished chicken with shredded colby-jack cheese.  I also made the onion rice pilaf recipe and served the chicken and sauce over it. Yum!! This is definitely a recipe I'll continue to use regularly.

I love this recipe! It is quick & easy & very tasty. The sauce can be used on beef and veggies too. Next time I think I'll add some white cooking wine.

I really liked this recipe, I have made it twice this month. Once over pasta and another by itself. I really love that you use cream cheese as the thickener. I buy a few at a time since they have a long shelf life and I can make this dinner very quickly in a pinch.
