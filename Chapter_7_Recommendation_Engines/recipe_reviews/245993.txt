This is exactly the sort of healthy dinner or lunch you want when it's hot. It's super delicious, filling, and fantastic! I've made this a handful of times and keep the dressing recipe the same bit adjust vegetables per what I have. To me, celery is a bit too crunchy, I prefer cucumbers - cut in half, de-seeded, then sliced into very thin crescents. Carrots are a staple, I use a gadget that kind of creates small strings of them. Then the rest is up to what's on hand and personal taste. I've also subbed out the chicken for salmon and it's wonderful!

Delicious and fresh noodle salad. I would suggest making a bit more of the dressing and allowing the veggies to marinate in them while the noodles and chicken cook. Also, I added some of the dressing to the chicken while it cooked, to give it a bit more salad. Letting the chicken marinate in some of the dressing wouldn't be a bad idea either. Thank you for the recipe.

I made it exactly as described, and it's perfect! In fact, I've made it 5 times within the past month. It's the perfect quick weeknight dinner, and the leftovers are even better for lunch the next day. I usually double the recipe now.

Loved it!  I did not have carrots, but I do now and will make it today.  My husband has heart issues so I was concerned about some of the ingredients e.g. Soy sauce and need to use a very low sodium one.  Overall he loves it and I will add fresh snow peas or green peas as I did before.

I took out the sesame due to allergies in the house, and it was fine with only 1 tbsp olive oil. I added 1/2 cup cooked edamame,  and used shrimp instead of chicken. It made a great cold lunch!

Worked well as written. I skipped the celery too, and added blanched broccoli.

This was an easy, flavorful, recipe to follow . Great for a warm evenings supper.  I would also consider using shrimp instead of chicken.

Amazing and fresh.  I grilled the chicken versus frying.  Seasoned the breast with garlic, salt and pepper.  Only change I would make is using julienned carrots.

Thanks for the recipe!

Love the dressing!! I didn't have any sugar but I still really enjoyed it. My family Loves Japanese food and this is something I will make more then just one more time. I read some reviews recommending shrimp and i will try that next time. Awesome recipe!

Yum! Made dressing exactly as directed. Added thin strips of raw tri color peppers, green onions, broccoli. It's a keeper!

Great recipe that was even better for lunch the next day. I used snap peas, tomatoes and carrots because thatâ€™s what I had on hand and it turned out great. The sauce tasted light but still flavorful. Would definitely make again.

I'm giving this five stars because if I actually had all the ingredients, I think it would have turned out even better than the dish I made, which I'd give a 4/5. I didn't have any fresh ginger, so I ended up adding powdered ginger to the chicken, which actually turned out great, but I should have also added some to the sauce.  I didn't have scallions or cilantro either, which I think would have balanced the nuttiness of the sesame oil (it was a little overpowering). I grated carrots, chopped up cucumbers and celery, and used those as the vegetables, but it made the pasta a little soggy. Next time I think I'd salt the vegetables and let them drain before adding them to the dish. 

Tip: I added 1/2 tsp of baking soda to the chicken before cooking, which made it extra tender.

This was a great summertime meal with an authentic Asian taste.  I just made a few tweaks.  Sesame oil can really overpower a dish, so I cut back on that by about half.  I also added mushrooms I had on hand.  Also, 4 oz. of soba noodles didn't seem like enough.  The package I bought was a 7 oz package.  I used all of it and that seemed perfect.  This is a recipe I will keep and use often - quick, simple, and delicious, especially for a hot summer day.

Family really enjoyed this dish. I purchased sesame oil for the recipe. Usually use EVOO or coconut oil. So glad I did, a really different flavor that was so good in the recipe. I made a few changes due to what I had on hand. Used angel hair pasta also did not have Cilantro & used left over turkey breast diced, added a few mandarin orange slices that needed using up. Thank you for sharing great basic recipe that can be adapted to taste & items on hand

Excellent refreshing salad. I used cucumbers prepared as another review suggested replacing green peppers.
