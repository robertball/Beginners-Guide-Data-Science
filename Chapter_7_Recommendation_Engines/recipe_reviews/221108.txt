I love anything easy and this was not only easy, easy, easy it was delicious!  I love herbs, so I added about a 1/2 cup of fresh basil and 1/2 cup of parsley and used green onion instead of the red.  I used about 3/4 cup of rice vinegar and about 1/4 cup of olive oil.  I read some of the other reviews and tailored the recipe from there.  My issue was defrosting the bags, so next time I'll buy in advance and set it out on the counter for the day.  I also had a hard time finding the shelled edamame, but found two bags of Pict Sweet finally.  This makes a LOT and it was awesome as lunch the next day!  Would be good with chick peas as well and I bet fresh mint would be awesome in it!

This has become a house favorite! We add extra soybeans for more crunch! Watch out on the oil or it feels like you are constantly wearing lip gloss. I added more herbs then recommended for more POP. This recipe makes A LOT of food. I used a very large bowl and it was just enough room. I would make this again and have passed this recipe on to friends. :)

Great salad, I make this often!. Once I divided the salad portion in two,  and did half with this dressing and half with just lime, cumin and salt. I love both, always have a hard time deciding which one to make, but I actually think the lime and cumin one is best. if you do this one here are a few tips: Thanks to other reviewers I went easy on the oil, used less than 3 Tbsp and it seemed just right. It looks great, especially if you add red pepper or tomato for another colour, plus the tomatoes really add to the salad. I used fresh garlic instead of powder, added about 1 tsp oregano  and omitted parsley because I don't care for it. It is even better the next day!

OMG, this is so good and I love edamame and eat it all the time. I didn't have the peas so I omitted them. Used canned corn, drained & rinsed, black beans drained & rinsed, half a sweet onion chopped up. EV olive oil, red wine vinegar, salt, pepper, oregano, basil, parsley & minced garlic (in a jar) all to taste. And this is definitely a keeper. Delicious. Even my 10-year-old and 14-year-old like it.

Thank you for the recipe!

Made this salad as I was looking for a way to use a bag of frozen edamame & had most of the ingredients on hand...WOW,YUMMMMMM!!!
Used green onions instead of red & omitted parsley as I had none. Let it marinate overnight.
I can't stay out of it, it's soooooo good, yet so simple & easy. Can't wait to take it for lunches this week.
Thank you, Allison!! :)

I omit the corn and prefer to lightly saute the onions as it is a little too much with the fresh onions.  I also use sesame oil and a little more garlic for more asiatic flavor.  My husband and I love it, and it gets even better as the flavors blend overnight.

When this recipe is followed exactly this is a good safe recipe and reminds me of a bean salad. 
Definitely worth making again.
After tasting I personally add more of every spice/herb and onion, and wish I had put less than 1/4 cup vinegar.
I will experiment in the future with another additive, feta cheese or bacon maybe?

The salad made too much for my family, so I cut the recipe by 4.We like a tarter salad, so I doubled the dressing and added 1Tablespoon of Dijon mustard-  Added fresh red pepper for additional crunch and used fresh parsley and basil. Tasty and healthy.

This was tasty! I used fresh basil and parsley instead of dried.  Next time I think I will try adding fresh garlic and maybe a few more herbs.  The flavor is lacking a bit but at the same time it is a very addictive taste and you just want to keep eating it.  Good, if not better the next day.

This recipe was just okay. I have made other bean salads that definitely had more flavour. I feel like it needs more to the dressing so if you're going to try this, try some of the other reviewers' suggestions ...

Very nice!  Omitted the black beans (been eating way too many of those lately!) and added a lovely orange pepper.  Reduced oil, and after tasting, threw in a bit more vinegar and basil.  Also used 1 clove fresh garlic pressed, vs powdered.  Plan to make this for my family on the 4th!

What's not to love about this salad? I put the frozen veggies in a collendar and defrosted them with running water. I also subbed cilantro for the parsley. After reading the comments, I did decrease the oil to 1/8 cup and added extra oil by the teaspoon until it was to my taste.

I really liked the flavor of this salad. The only thing I did different was to replace black beans with garbanzo beans. Unfortunately, I am the only one who liked - the kids and husband didn't care for it, but they  aren't as adventurous as me.

This is a great recipe - we love it and it makes a lot.  Instead of the frozen corn, I take fresh corn on the cob and roast it on the grill.  Let it cool and then cut the corn off the cob.  It really adds more flavor.  There is so much you can do with this recipe.

I like this salad because it's a good change from th normal summer BBQ salads. I followed recipe pretty close but would definitely cut back on oil next time. I also added cilantro and it was a good touch!

I subbed garden fresh bell peppers for the peas and it was FABULOUS! I ate it plain and then with tortilla chips. Perfect both ways!

This is easy to throw together and very pretty.  I could tell by the smell that my husband would not be a fan of the dressing though since he is a vinegar hater (crazy man, I know!), so I scrapped that and used a concoction of olive oil, basil, and Cajun spice.  It's very good.

Vegetables never tasted so good! I've never seen my family dive into a salad like they did for this. We usually don't enjoy leftovers, but we ate this salad at dinner, lunch and dinner the next evening, and it tasted great every time. It is extremely colorful and looks very pretty on your plate. I will make this again and again, and serve it to guests as a nice change from the usual lettuce salad.

This is great as a take along for picnics! I substituted red kidney beans instead of peas for more protein and chopped fresh cilantro instead dried parsley for a fresh, summery flavor.

This was fresh tasting and easy. I omitted the peas and added shredded kale. I mixed it all together and let it sit in the fridge 30 minutes before serving to soften the kale a bit.

Made it as written, but couldn't fit the black beans in the container that I was using. It's a good base recipe, I think. I would prefer a higher percentage of red wine vinegar and salt.

Easy and tasty salad. I will make a batch and eat for lunch throughout the week. I'm not crazy about corn but the ingredients are easy to modify. Good recipe

This was a great go-to recipe for a potluck at work.  With so many unhealthy options, I decided to balance it off.  I made it the night before so it sat overnight. I did add more dressing in the morning because I know my co-workers.   I would also add diced red pepper next time.

It was as easy & delicious as everyone has said...It made a huge amount so it'd definately feed a crowd~!...The only thing I would "adjust" is to add more red wine vinegar, otherwise it was perfect..My daughter & I shared this over the 4th of July weekend, and she raved at how good it was and she said she HAD to have the recipe~!...:)

I love this salad! I substituted chopped cucumber for the frozen peas & did not add black beans. I also used Herbs de Provence instead of just basil. It is a light refreshing salad that is also quite nutritious. It keeps well in the fridge, too. It would make a wonderful summer potluck salad.

Pretty good for a side salad. I cut the recipe in half and I would cut it in half again if I make it again.

I made this exactly like the recipe other than increasing the spices and vinegar to taste, and using fresh garlic and parsley. I don't think the olive oil amount is an issue considering the size of the salad.  Very good and best in a day or two.
