Great tasting, but the recipe could use a few alterations.  First, cream the butter and sugars before adding the rest of the ingredients.  Next, double the recipe because it only makes about half of the amount it says. Also, mine baked in 6 minutes.  These are yummy cookies though!  When I took them out of the oven they were much darker than the usual so I thought they'd be hard and dry, but wuite the contrary!  They were slightly crispy on the edges and moist and chewy in the center!  Yahoo!

Absolutely delicious!  My family loved this recipe.  I added 2 tsp. hot water for the perfect consistency.  Crunchy around the edged and soft and chewy on the inside.  It's so good it's sinful!  Made 3 dozen small cookies. (1tsp per. cookie)  Thanx for this recipe!

Very good cookies and easy to make. I've made the Toll House recipe for 20 years, but today I only had 1 stick of butter and I had promised my 6yr old that we could make cookies today! So I came on here looking for a recipe that called for only one stick of butter. It's honestly just as good as the toll house recipe. I'm definitely keeping this one because it makes far fewer cookies, which means less baking tme and fewer calories in my belly ;) I didn't mix the ingredients exactly how it says in the recipe. I did it the same as I do when making Toll House. Cream the butter and sugar first, then mix in the egg and vanilla. Mix dry ingredients in separate bowl, add to wet mixture while the mixer is running. Then add chips. I use a scoop for all my cookies, which makes about 2-2.5" cookies. This recipe made 36 of them, cooked for 6.5 minutes. These are delicious according to the 2 kids and 2 adults in my household!

These cookies are AWESOME!!
I doubled the recipe cause they didnt quite make enough the first time.
Crispy on the edges and chewy in the middle! I have tried at least a dozen choc. chip cookie recipes on this site but this is by far the BEST!!
This recipe is a keeper!!

Really good! Yum! I creamed the butter with the sugars, then added moist ingredients and then mixed in the flour mix. Cooked for 10 min - they came out just right.

This recipe was a waste of ingredients because once we mixed the dry ingredients and put the wet into that the mixture didn't turn out!

This is very delicious. The texture was perfect as well. Slightly crispy outside, and nice and chewy on the inside. The stay moist even after a few days. The only problem I had with this recipe, is that it was a bit too sweet! sweeter than most choc. chip cookies, and I have made dozens of different recipes! So next time I make these, I will use much less sugar. But again, I loved the texture.

Amazing recipe the cookies tasted great, I just suggest that you really make small portions like it is writen in the recipe because I usually just make the size I think is good and when I did this they turned out really big and soupy (hard to pick up) other than that great cookies with a good golden edge! :)

Delicious!  I made the recipe as given, except I used 1 cup of regular flour and 1-1/8 cup whole wheat flour.  I also creamed together all ingredients but flour, nuts, and choc chips first, just out of habit. They were so good that I will likely try them next time with all wheat flour.

This was a fast, easy, and delicious cookie recipe! I changed the order of the steps, mixing the butter and the sugars first, and used half Ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate chips and half Scharffen Berger semisweet dark chocolate. My wife thought this was a fantastic cookie, and she has tasted lots of them!!! Thanks a lot!   Enrique

I chose this recipe because it had easy ingredients and was a smaller batch. I definitely did not get 4 dozen, it was closer to 2 and a half. The cookies are small and pretty good, nothing fancy.

I have made this recipe many times and it always turns out fantastic! It helps that it doesn't have milk as well since I'm lactose intolerant.

This is a great recipe. My husband loved them more than other choc chip cookies, I didn't find them quite chewy enough, hence the 4 stars.   I made them with mini chips and I liked that the recipe didn't make quite so many cookies. With a typical-sized scooper, I got about 28 average sized cookies. That's perfect for a Saturday night cookie bake.

these were just okay.  i was looking for a light, moist cookie.  they are moist out of the oven but after they cool, they lose it and they seem to lose a bit of flavor. also, after they cooled on the sheet they stuck to the sheet so the next batch i used cooking spray and it worked a bit better.  i also added almond extract instead of vanilla and that seemed to help the flavor a lot.  overall, these were okay, not what i was expecting.

Great crispy cookie! I used less white sugar due to other reviews stating cookies were too sweet. The cookie does come out thin so make sure you are making the cookie size true to size of a teaspoon. The 1st batch I took out at 9 mins thinking it was done, they were a little under cooked. The 2nd batch came out done at 10 mins but still thin. Per another review the 3rd batch I add some more flour and they came out much better.

These were good and chewy. I tried them because it made a small amount. They still aren't good as my Mom's used to be but they will do in a pinch! Can't find her original recipe.

Very good....only made 12 cookies...But when they were in the over they spread so we had jumbo cookies which if I would have used less batter on each cookie it would have been right. Very yummy and soft like muffny type and crispy on the edges...very good. quick and easy took maybe 15-20 mins w/ prep and cook time.

Although these cookies look and taste delicious, I can't understand how this recipe could yield 4 dozen cookies, unless they were TINY cookies.  I used a teaspoon to make them, and once cooked they were less than 2" in diameter, which is pretty small already.  It's a great recipe if you want to make a small batch (I got about 2 dozen), but don't believe the nutritional info, because I think it was calculated based on 4 dozen tiny cookies!

These cookies were pretty good, the only hing that I would change about them is use pecans instead of walnuts, but that is just my opinion.

Mine just spread out really far. I didn't use nuts and used mini-chips instead of regular sized. Maybe it's my own fault. Also used margarine instead of butter. If I try it again, I will stick to the recipe 100% and see if I have any luck.

Fantastic. Made right around 2 dozen, as the recipe said. I did cream the butter with the sugars beforehand, and I used a scant cup of flour. Baked for about 9 minutes, left them on the sheet for about 5 more minutes, then cooled. Absolutely perfect.

What a hit! Everyone loved them. I used peanut butter chips and chocolate chips. They were a little crispier than I thought they would be. They came out softer on a cookie sheet covered in foil.

This is exactly what I was looking for.  Crispy outside, just chewey enough on the outside.  I also creamed the butter first and then added sugars and other wet ingredents and then added the sifted dry ingredients.  Baked up perfect in 10 minutes.

I normally HATE chocolate chip cookies; however, I decided to give this recipe a chance, and I am so glad I did.  The BEST chocolate chip cookie I've ever eaten by far.  My husband just inhaled 6 and loves them, too!

I was a little disappointed. These are very thick cookies with an oatmeal consistancy. They don't flatten out when baked at all. They stay balled up. The picture is NOT what you get if you're looking for traditionally flat cookies. Just "ok".

Okay, I'm an Equal Opportunity Cookie Lover, but this one just doesn't work for me. I read the reviews and then proceeded because I only had one stick of butter. The batter is good- tastes good and looks good. I tried baking the cookies a couple of different ways. I tried semi-flattened teaspoonfuls on a Silpat for 10 minutes. They all spread almost completely flat, some were all the way brown, others weren't. I let them cool on the pan then transfered to a wire rack- they all ended up droopy like they were half cooked. So I did another batch of 1/2 tsp sized non-flattened on a regular cookie sheet for 8 minutes. They ended up looking more like the picture- though they are still bendy (not chewy- bendy) and almost raw in the middle. I was going to serve them to a afternoon guests, but I think I'll be serving them a fruit tray instead.

omg!! this is my second time making these and they're AMAZING and have a mouth watering crispy outside and soft, chewy inside. i made 2 batches (1 makes 23 palm sized cookie)& both batches baked perfectly in exactly10 minutes, with no alterations to the recipe except that i creamed the sugars and butter first, added the egg and vanilla to that, then mixed that mixture into the sifted flour, baking soda and salt. i never thought using separate bowls for dry/wet ingredients wouldmake a difference but it really does. YOU MUST TRY THIS RECIPE!! DONE RIGHT, YOU WILL LOVE THEM (promise)
ps- makes the greatest cookie dough! enjoy:)

My 10 year old was looking of a easy cookie recipe to make and she picked this one. I asked her what she thought when they were a made and this what she said....Crispy, yet moist and oh so chocolatly. SO I guess thats 2 thumbs up! The only thing is it really doesn't make many cookies I think she endded up with about 15, so I would sujest doubling the recipe!

WOW! Thanks Rosina! This recipe was easy and absolutely delicious! My poor mother will be be crushed! These are now my favourite cookies! I reduced the sugars to 1/3c each just to make them a little less wicked and they still stole the show!

These cookies are pretty good, crispy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside.  I'd recommend adding almond extract though for added flavor, and creaming the butter and sugars before adding the other ingredients.  And the recipe only makes 2 dozen cookies, not four like it says, so it's good to double. Overall, these cookies are always a big hit in my house, and they disappear in a flash...but still not the best!

I had didn't pull these out of the oven fast enough. They were more crispy than I like. Also, make sure that the scoops of dough are SMALL. My first batch, I made them too big and they spread out too much and were too crispy. The second time it was better but I still cooked them for too long. They don't need very much time to cook, so be careful. I also used 1/4 cup of whole wheat flour and 1/8 cup of milled flax seed instead of all being all-purpose flour. My husband didn't even notice a difference and they were a tad bit healthier that way.

I loved this recipe.  I made it exactly as written minus the nuts.  They were crispy and soft in all the right places.  I also love that there weren't tons left over.  If there are only a few people in your household, who needs a bunch of left over cookies that you feel obligated to eat?  It's just nice to get a little taste of heaven once and a while.  Thanks for a great recipe.  I think I will continue to use this one.

Terrible! First batch in was almost perfect... second batch (without changing anything) spread out too much. After adding more flour to make it thicker, it tasted horrible. Even the first batch wasn't tasty. I would never make these again!

These cookies were missing something, they were dry, flaky, chewy,thin, and tasted a little plain. They cook much faster then in the directions. I was disapointed because I'm 40weeks pregnant and really wanted a good chocolate chip cookie and now I'm out of chocolate chips!!

This is it!  The choco-chip recipe I've been looking for!  Just your good, old-fashioned variety - Not too flat, not too mounded, crispy on the outside and soft inside.  It goes into my 'best-of' category for sure!  Thank you!

I've tried a lot of choc chip cookie recipes lately and this is by far the best!!  I made dozens for friends on Christmas, and everyone LOVED them.  My husband said these are the best.  I agree... I can't get enough of them.  These are the best!!!

Very good recipie - used a non stick cookie sheet and will probably cut cooking time next time.  Even a little overdone they were very good. Simple recipe to make with the kids.

Nice cookie.  On a pizza stone the cookies came out pretty and were chewy with nice golden highlights on top for just a bit of crisp. On a regular cookie sheet the cookie did not spread, but had crunchier bottoms.  Only needed 9 minutes for the pizza stone and 8 or less for the cookie sheet.  Does not make 4 dozen.  Made about 20 cookies.

These were good cookies, but not the best I have ever had. I had to replace the butter with becel margerine because I was out of butter. They were really good hot but got really hard when they cooled. Still edible and good though...would make them again. Thanks for the recipe :-)

These came out perfect! Slightly brown was best so they stayed chewy on the inside yet crunchy edges. I was able to get nearly 2 doz cookies from this. Definitely a keeper.

Very yummy! Works well with milk chocolate chips, too; not overly sweet. Perfect portion of dough for our family of three. Makes 15 good size cookies or 20 or so small for the kids.

These were really yummy, but the first batch were really thin and flat, so I added about a 1/4c of flour to what was left and the turned out better.  For those who haven't tried this recipe yet, you may wish to try a test cookie first, and add more flour as need.  Having said that I would still make these again!

I was a little leary of using this recipe because of some of the reviews, but these are just great!!! I ran out of butter so I used Crisco instead and they still tasted delicious! I also like the small batch size... perfect for when I am craving chocolate chip cookies but don't want to eat too many! :)

I lost this recipe, glad to find it again! These cookies are delicious, and use ingredients I almost always have around the house. I never use shortening - so when a cookie recipe calls for it, I usually pass on that recipe. The brown sugar gives these cookies some real flavour, and the texture is chewy and wonderful.

THE BEST chocolate chip cookie recipe!

A few years back I was baking a lot for bake sales and just couldn't find that right recipe. Some cookies were too bland, some with odd textures, etc. But this cookie is perfect. Everyone in my family loves it. I bake them every holiday and any other chance I get. I cooked about 50 of them last Christmas and all of them were gone in 15 minutes. The adults didn't even get a finger on them! The little kids devoured them like monsters :)

i LOVE this. it's crunchy on the edges and in the center it's so soft. i'm allergic to nuts so i didn't add walnuts. the only thing i'd change is to add less chocolate chips. i've already made them dozens of times and i will again

I think I must have done something wrong with these cookies. They tasted very good, but they were very very thin and did not rise at all. I am wondering is something was wrong with the baking soda I used. I did double the amount of vanilla, and used maragine spread instead of butter. I am not sure if that would have made a difference or not. All in all, I will try them again and see if it goes better.

This recipe was alright but in no way was my favorite. The cookie dough was a little dry and when the cookies baked they didn’t flatten out very much at all. They seemed to have a very light taste to them. These turned out nothing like a regular chocolate chip cookie I have made in the past. I think that if there was more butter or another egg the dough might have been easier to work with and the cookie may have tasted better.

These are absolutely delicious: soft, golden, flavorful. The amount is just right if you're baking for one or two like I am, but I'd double the recipe for a family. These are VERY chocolatey, so if you like the "cookie" part of chocolate chip cookies, you might consider cutting back on the chips. I used a bit more than 1 cup for a doubled recipe and there were enough chips in it for my taste.

Had a craving for chocolate chip cookies but only had a small amount of flour and margarine so this recipe was perfect.  I opted to make small cookies, recipe yielded about 4 dozen small cookies.  I tossed in a handful of toffee bits and cooked them for 9 minutes, removing to wire rack immediately.  They were very good, moist and chewy.  Even the next day they were still chewy as I usually have a problem with cookies becoming too crisp the following day. I have tried dozens of choc. chip cookie recipes but this is a great recipe which I will definetly keep!

I made these cookies, and as someone else suggested, I creamed the butter, sugars, vanilla and egg and then added the dry ingredients.  The results were excellent and I will be using this as my go-to chocolate chip recipe going forward.  A definite keeper.

The only change I made was to use equal parts brown sugar and white sugar. Be sure to watch the oven as bake time depends on the size of your cookies. The recipe made 2 1/2  dozen cookies. Perfect texture and flavor!

Creamed the room temp butter with sugars, added the two table spoons of water.  I didn't have regular sized chocolate chips, so I used the mini- chips instead! They were perfect since the cookies are so small! The recipe made approx 42 cookies!! Great cookie!!

Best cookies ever! Tastes a lot like Toll House cookies. No more going to the market to buy them when I can make them myself. :D

I made 2 separate & different batches of this recipe, in  order to understand the negative comments. The 1st batch, I used salted butter; the cookies turned out moist and delicious. The 2nd batch I used unsalted butter, they turned out flat, with crispy edges and an oily soft center. They were also darker. Both were good, but The 1st had more flavor. In my opinion, salt brings out the flavor in everything; even using the smallest amount or even salt substitute.

I like this recipe. Had a few problems with baking them. Should have creamed the butters, sugars, and vanilla together then added the flour and other ingredients.  Yummy in the end.

These cookies are very good. They turn out just the way I like a cookie to be. They are flat and chewy and that is what I like. You do have to make a smaller cookie. I usually use my medium size cookie scoop but for these I just put a small teaspoonful on the sheet instead and to me they were great. I will definitely make them again.

This was my first ever attempt at making cookies and it actually worked! These cookies were yummy. I changed the recipe slightly by adding hazelnuts. I'm looking forward to playing around with the recipe to make different kinds of cookies!
