Wonderful little breakfast sandwich that's great for "on the go"! Much better than going to a drive-thu! I made this even easier and I microwaved my egg in a pudding cup sprayed with Pam for about 35 seconds. Top with your favorite cheese and you're all set. This was so easy to make and and done in no time at all!

I made this for the boys this morning using whomp biscuits and turkey bacon. They LOVED it. My son said it was almost as good as his favorite fast food sandwich.

I found this recipe refreshing and a breeze. I used shredded cheese instead of slices. i simply fried the egg and added cheese to the top covered the skillet and let it melt. Presto egg, cheese, Canadian bacon and roll :) put it together you have breakfast!!
