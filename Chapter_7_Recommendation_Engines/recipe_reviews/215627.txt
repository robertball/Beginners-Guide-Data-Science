Great fresh and healthy recipe.  

I mixed it up a bit and it was super yummy.  I added a whole chopped jalepaeno to give it a kick (warning, it had a kick, but really complemented the mango), used fresh chopped red pepper instead of the flakes for more taste and texture, and did not add the beans (it didnt need it).  I also replaced the oil with fresh lemon juice to keep the fish light and healthy, it worked well.

Finally, instead of tortillas, I served the whole fish fillets on a plate with huge piles of salsa on top and with a side of grilled veggies (use the rest of the red pepper and add some yellow pepper and onion or your grilled veggie of choice).

Delicious and Healthy.

Hey now!  This is so easy and fast.  I did do this on the grill and it was GREAT.  Quick - light and oh so perfect for summer.  I took some liberty with the salsa - based on what I had on hand.  mango, pineapple, lime, cliantro, red onion, green onion and a finely diced serrano pepper - OH JOY - one beautiful - fast and elegant meal.  Thank you.  **** I did use Smoked Paprika, a little garlic and onion powder on the fish.   Hubby said "Next time kick it up a notch and go Cajun"

This was amazing! I cut back on the cucumber, added half a serrano pepper, lots of garlic and cilantro because I didn't have any basil on hand, & neither did the store ;\.   I wrapped everything up in heated corn tortillas, topped with finely shredded cabbage &  a big squeeze of lime.  TO DIE FOR!

This was really tasty. I did not have any lime for juice so i cut up a strawberry instead and added that to the salsa,I deleted the red pepper flakes and beans. When I put it all together on the tortilla I felt something was missing...feta cheese...just sprinkled a bit on top..and boooom!!! This was truly a pleasure to eat!!!

Yum this is a great healthy recipe. I used lettuce instead of tortillas just to cut out some more calories and I added a bit of red onion to the salsa but it would have been great without it too.

So good!  I left out chickpeas because my husband made a racket about them, but I bet they would have been good.  I was skeptical about the ingredients going together but I had them all and I gave it a shot.  Glad I did!!  Yum!
