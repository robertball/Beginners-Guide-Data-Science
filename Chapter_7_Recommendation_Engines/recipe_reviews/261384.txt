Flavorful and super simple. You can have this ready in way under an hour if you plan it right. Start to finish was 30 minutes for me. As soon as you get the rice covered start chopping the veggies to get them going. Continue on with the rest of the steps and everything comes out at the exact same time.  This recipe would be perfect for nights you have limited time.
