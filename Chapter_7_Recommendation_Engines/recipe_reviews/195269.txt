This was good. My five and two year olds ate it all and my husband liked it too. I didn't add the sauce to the top of the burger at the end. Just mixed the 1/2 cup of sauce and cheese in the beef and then topped with remaining cheese at the end. Good recipe.

This is actually a pretty good recipe. At first it appeared the burger would be mediocre at best, but the sauce really stood out in the burger. I used extra lean meat and the sauce helped moisten it without adding all the fat. It was very good. I think next time I'll use low fat or fat free mozzarella as well to have an even leaner, yet tasty burger. Will make these again!
