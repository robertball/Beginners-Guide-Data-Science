Quite possibly the best steak I have ever made! I used flank steak and cut back the cilantro by about half. The citrus flavors don't overpower, they accent and bring out the beef. High heat on the grill and be careful not to overcook. It melts in your mouth...

Very delicious and flavorful! Marinated this for 24 hours. Cooked on the grill and it was very tender. Served with avocado cream sauce and salsa on corn tortillas. Will definately make again! Thanks Chef!!!

We tripled the recipe to make dinner for eight adults and four kids. There was no scaling issues. We marinated it for about 18hrs. The meat absorbed the marinade well and it turned out delicious. It's definitely a recipe we will make again!

A couple other notes: the kids ranged in age from 2 to 6 and none of them complained that the meat was too spicy for them. We cut it into 2" x ~0.75" strips and made little street tacos out of it. I'm pretty sure that's not an authentic Cuban thing to do with it, but no one could argue with the result.  tasty it was.

I couldn't find skirt steak, so I used flap meat instead.  It came out really tasty & tender. I didn't alter a thing & let it marinate 3hrs.  I used it for tacos. I left the remaining meat marinate for another day & it was even more tender.  Now flap meat is very thin, so it wasn't going to be juicy like steak, but it was not dry, grilled very quickly &  was so so tender that you can just bite right through it vs sometimes having to semi gnaw to finish breaking off your taco bites- if that makes sense.  Definitely a keeper

Absolutely delicious, wife loved it. Picked up some pico de gallo from Whole Foods and served with flour tortillas. I grilled the onions in a grill pan and I'll do a whole onion next time instead of just a half onion.  I only marinated for 2 hours, but I'd like to try longer as other users suggested. I saved the marinade and reduced as other users said and it worked well.

This recipe is a real winner - it's a whole new way to enjoy steak - especially since skirt steaks are half the price of ribeye.
I always make a new recipe exactly as written so I have a baseline. But I did make two "sort of" changes. First, I marinated the steaks for about six hours, simply because I had free time in the late morning. I recommend that because I believe it tenderized the meat even more. (Also, it makes it easy to make these on a weeknight).
The second "change" was that I broiled them instead of grilling - they came out beautifully!
As I mentioned, the flavors of the citrus, cumin and other spices layer perfectly so that one doesn't dominate.
One thing puzzled me: If you're grilling or broiling, where do you get the "accumulated  juices"? I solved that by boiling the marinade down a bit and sprinkling  it over the steaks along with the olive oil. The cilantro and lime slices are a must - they just add that extra zip that makes this recipe worthy of a restaurant meal.
The kids loved it, too! This will definitely be a "go to" recipe from now on.

I used the Mojo marinade for 36 hours after piercing it with my 24  stainless steel blade press. I believe flank steak needs a little tenderizing help.  Served with grilled mushroom and onion tin foil packets.  125 degrees internal is perfect.  Man, what a great steak.  Thanks C J, you rang the bell once again!

We love what this does to our steak!!!

We follow as directed, and grill over very high heat so there is a touch of char on the steak.  Then you get the heavy sear, and a nice and juicy steak.  If we can't find skirt steak, we have used flank, as well as any cut really.

We make this into a rice bowl, with cilantro lime rice and a corn and poblano salsa.  Its the perfect meal!

I made as directed, but I grilled this in my Panasonic Countertop Induction Oven on the med-high grill setting for 3 minutes per side. It was delicious and my family devoured it.

I’ve made this joker 4 times as the recipe states with the exception of a 24 hour marinade period. Each time has been fabulous and the guests rave and request over and over. It’s now in my top 5 favs.

And I thought I loved Carne Asada. This is my new favorite. It has a wonderful flavor that works great in or out of a tortilla shell. My Bible study group loved it.

This steak was so delicious!  I used what they call in my part of the woods, "Denver Steak".  Put my steak in a long casserole dish and covered it with the marinade and plastic wrap.  Full of flavor!  Served with twice baked potatoes and sautéed mushrooms.  Thanks Chef John! :)

I must admit, I haven't had mojo beef before, so I cannot attest to its authenticity.  What I will attest to is just how amazing the flavors were and how tender and juicy the steaks became!  This is now my go-to recipe for fajitas.  Hands down the best thing I've put on my grill in a while.

It was a little too cold out for me to grill this, but cooked the steaks under the broiler and some in the cast iron. Despite forgetting to drain on the paper towels, the mojo beef still came out good, just couldn't get a good sear on it because I forgot the paper towel step. Flavor was great and perfect for my husband, a little too much citrus for my tastes, but I think I wouldn't notice it when grilled. Will be trying this on the grill in the future!

This was so good!  I made mine with diced chicken, and in the slow cooker.  I added a can of black beans to the slow cooker, and cooked on low for about 6 hours.  It smelled wonderful!  I served with brown rice and fried plantains.  My boyfriend ate it up!!  I'm going to make this again when my mom comes to visit.  Thank you for the recipe!!

I made this the first time using a London broil cut, grilled and then sliced thin which was delicious.  I have also used this marinade on chicken breast which was then grilled. Also delicious.  This had become my favorite marinade for grilling.  Trying next on chicken wings. Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe is absolutely fantastic made exactly as stated.  We like it with rice and black beans, then the leftovers as fajitas.  The course salt added at the end is key!

Awesome recipe, highly recommend.

Gosh. I usually love his recipes. This one was not very good to me. I found that it had too much cumin. I also thought that marinating it only 2-3 hours was not enough to impart flavor. I follow the recipe exactly. I think that it would have been better if it had marinated longer.

Have'nt tried making it yet,just rated for the eye candy and wanted to make a remark.
The small oranges Chef referred to are what my Wife from the Philippines calls "Filipino lemons".Not sure why as they don't appear to be lemons but it's a Filipino naming thing,which I've gotten used to over the years. : )
They can occasionally be found in Asian shops but mostly the Asians will plant and harvest their own when needed.We have a few of the trees in our yard.

Simple to make and can be used on multiple meats. I marinaded for 24 hours. The most prominent flavor to the beef was lime. This is not necessarily a bad thing but mine turned out a bit unbalanced for my tastes. Next time I will try and find a bigger orange to hopefully have a better result. Yes, next time so I am definitely gonna make this again.

This is so delicious! I’ve made it twice now. Used a mandolin on finest setting to do the onions. When grilling, I just plop them on top of the pieces of steak and move them frompiece to piece when flipping.

Came out very well.  Very tasty and will make again.  Did anyone else hear the voice of Chef John whisper "Mojo" as they were making this?  Probably just me.

Only change I made was to use flap steak since I couldn’t find hangar steak.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. It was great! Great flavor, and the meat was soooo tender! Husband loved it, too. We bought rice and beans from our favorite Mexican restaurant to go with it and grilled some veggies to go with the meat. Delicious and easy!  We marinated meat for about 8 hours. We waited for it to cool off enough to go out and grill.

This.
Is.
AWESOME!
I followed the recipe as printed, except I used a garlic press instead of mincing it. And I marinated it @ 6 hours. That's it.
I cut it into pieces @ 6-8 " wide and sliced against the grain (very important to slice that way.) It took a bit longer, being @ 2 pounds. I won't cook this cut of meat any other way from here on out. Thanks Chef John, another winner!

I ended up marinating the steak for only one hour and I used iodized salt (which made it a little salty) and it still came out amazing!!!!

Followed the recipe, I trust Chef John! Defrosted enough flap steak for me and my wife, then my Granddaughter showed up for dinner. There wasn't enough for me to get my fill! :( We all wanted more, a lot more! Recipe is killer! You can adjust it however you like, but it's really good just as it is! One adjustment I'll make next go round will be to 86 the oregano and add more cilantro. Served the meat up with flour tortillas, pico de gallo, guacamole and some cheddar cheese...serious eats!! This was sooo good, and filling, but I would have traded all the fajita fixins for another 4 ozs. of the meat!!! Make sure you have a half pound or so of meat per person, trust me!

Added more garlic as well as garlic and onion powder to the marinade. Used beer as my base for the marinade. 
Absolutely loved it, super tasty!

Did not have lime the first time and substituted with one squeezed lemon. Thought it was better with the lemon when I made it the second time with the lime. But either way this is fantastic! My wife loved it.

Excellent! I forgot to add the onions but not a big deal. Loved the bright fresh flavors. Marinated for about 3-4 hours. Great on its own and would also be good on a salad. Will make again for sure.

Very flavorful marinade. I only let the meat sit for about two hours because my husband claimed starvation. But even still, it was amazing. Thanks Chef John!
