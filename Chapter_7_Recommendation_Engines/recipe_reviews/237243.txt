For my taste preference, I would add a bit more of the fresh pineapple for just a little more sweetness.  Added more ice to reach a thicker consistency (personal preference), but this is pretty tasty.

Although the taste isn't my absolute favorite-it really did give me the energy boost I was looking for in the mornings! I continue to chug it down before work every day!
