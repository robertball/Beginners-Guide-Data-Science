THE ONLY ITEM I WOULD ADD IS A 1/2 CUP OF RAISINS WHICH WOULD REALLY MADE IT LIKE THE OLD FASHIONED FRENCH APPLE PIE.IT IS TRUELY DELICIOUS WHITH THE RAISINS AND I WOULD DEEPLY SUGGEST TO TRY IT THAT WAY.

I found this recipe as a newly wed and five years later I'm still making it. I do make one change. I more than double the apples called for and then bake it  for 60 minutes. This makes it a bit less cake like, but still retains the flavor of the original recipe.

I must say this is a quick, easy and very yummy recipe.  I made them into muffins and they were great.  I then tried the tiny muffin tins for a bite-sized dessert for entertaining and they were a hit.  If you use the small muffin tins, remember to dice the apples a bit smaller.

This pie is more like a cake, but what a surprise to your guests when they cut into it!  My pie was a huge hit, mainly with me because it was easy and great.  One tip, the batter is really thick, so I washed my hands, took my ring off and mixed it with my hands without the apples.  After it was well mixed, I then washed my hands, put my ring on so I wouldn't forget it and added the apples.  Then mixed with a large spatula.  By the way, I used the apple peeler corer slicer and it made the apples the perfect size. Don't you just love this site?

Not very good warm, but pretty good after it was in the fridge overnight. I think 45 min might be a little too long in the oven, because the edges are kind of tough compared to the rest of it, so if I make it agian, I'll try 35 or 40 min instead.

I first made this for a Teacher Appreciation Luncheon.  I had to make copies of the receipe it was a hugh success!!  Over the last few weeks I have made about 6 of these.  My five year old loves to help with it.  It only takes about 15-20 minuets to prepare it.  Excellent.

Very moist and tasty, I added raisins (about a 1/2 cup).  It was very good with the cream cheese frosting, but for a variation will try leaving off the frosting and serving with whipped cream next time.  Think it would be great.

I am currently expecting and craving French Apple Pie. As having a whole pie/cake in the house would be dangerous, I made this for Thanksgiving to share...hoping there would be leftovers to carry home. I did use a 1/2 cup of raisins instead of walnuts as my family does not like nuts in their desserts. I stewed the raisins and used that hot liquid for the hot water required later in the recipe. I also thinned out the cream cheese icing to a glaze consistency. Next time I may add more apples as other reviewers have suggested. Thank you Marbalet for posting this recipe; as others have stated this is a great recipe for the pie crust challenged!

This isn't a traditional American Apple pie.  But it was delicious!  A very rich moist yummy apple cake.  And the cream cheese topping....couldn't have been any better!  Thanks Holly for this French take on apple pie!

F A B U L O U S! You will not regret trying this one!! :) Only thing I did different was I added dried cranberries instead of nuts. Absolutely loved this, so did my husband and 18mo old! :D Will make again and again I know it! :D
UPDATE: I made this again today, but didn't add the cranberries! It is great both ways! I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe, and yes, it is comparable to a carrot cake, just with apples, but use the frosting, it compliments this cake perfectly! I was craving it ever since the last time I made it, so this is the 2nd time already in less than 2wks. LOL! Yes it is that good! :)

Wow, this is to die for! I read a lot of the reviews beforehand and added an extra cup and half of apples to make it less cake-like. It was still a little cake-like, but it had a fantastic taste. Definitely a company worthy dessert.

Made this for easter, everyone raved about it! i let the topping stand by the warm oven so it was very easy to apply; i also put a ring of dried cranberries around the sides. Then we popped it in the fridge for it to set, after 5 hours it looked so gourmet. A lot of people compared it to carrot cake but with apples. and MUCH easier to make than carrot cake. i'm losing my taste for apple dishes but if someone requested an apple dessert, i'd reach for this recipe again. (i also didnt have nutmeg fo i used a 1/2 tsp of all spice, and i put the apples in after mixing everything else by SPOON. very thick batter.)

This is a cake however I think next time I will double the apples to see if its less cake like. That said it tasted quite good. I creamed the butter and sugar first then added the other ingredients and the apples were mixed in last. At 40min was done so suggest you keep a check on it. Would leave out the nuts next time was not a favourite here, also had no nutmeg so doubled the cinnamon only change I made. I used about 4 medium apples there.  The cake came out dark was worried it was burnt but thats how it is supposed to be. Served with whipped cream did not make the topping will try next time.

This recipe turns out well everytime I make it.  It is very moist.  I make it without the cream cheese icing and serve it warm with cool whip.  Everyone likes it.  My one nephew likes it better than American Apple pie.

When I took my first bite, it tasted just like carrot cake, just with apples. It was very quick and easy. Pretty decent recipe.

This review is for the cream cheese topping. We made pumpkin pancakes and were looking for a yummy topping for them. I made the cream cheese topping along with a cinnamon syrup, and they were both great. The cream cheese topping is basically like a rich creamy icing, and it melted nicely over the top and had a great flavor. We will definitely make it again.

I made this for my brother's birthday because he wanted an apple pie, and I thought I'd try something different. He gave it a 3.5, so I rated it as 3 because he didn't think it was to die for, and it was very crumbly.

I've made it twice now, followed the directions exactly. The only thing I will change the next time is add less sugar, I love sweet, but it was a bit overwhelming, once I add less sugar it will be perfect! And people have already asked me for the recipe!

I found this quite average.  It's definitely a cake, not a pie. I had trouble with it being too moist and it was more trouble and not as nice as my usual apple cake.

This is awesome! I baked in a 9" springform pan, left out the walnuts (didn't have any) and left the peel on the apples, which made it a lot faster to make. I also used salted butter in the frosting, and couldn't taste the difference. Everything about this pie is great!

*****THIS IS CAKE! NOT PIE!***** That being said, this is so DANG GOOD!! Its moist, and it hits the spot on a good cold day! I subsituted the nuts for rasins and crasins! Other than I just doubled everything. The only major change I made was the frosting. I used 8ox cream cheese, 8oz Marshmellow cream(half a jar). This is so much less sweeter, and a perfect compliment to this recipe. BTW, I dont normally leave comments, so this is a relly good recipe for me to do this. A big hit among the Germans that live around me(Im stationed in Germany)

Easy and delicious. This bakes up more like a cake if you are thinking it will turn out like a pie, but is a delicious fall dessert that you will not regret making.

I made this and it came out great! I did make some changes. I used 1/2 cup all purpose flour and 1/2 cup brown rice flour and I used 1/2 cup sugar and 4 packets of stevia sweetener. I think I will use a little less sugar next time. I also only used 1/4 tsp nutmeg. I poured the batter in a muffin pan and cooked for 20 minutes. I will definitely make this again.

I took katiejaine007's advice and tried to double the amount of apples. I almost succeeded, and the result was a delicious desert that was between the consistency of a cake and pie. Only one person called it a carrot cake m/o apples, compared to all 6 thinking it was delish. Thanks for an tasty, easy recipe!

I Used the cream cheese topping on a apple cake I made. OH MY GOSH. Out of this world. The recipe was call Apple Squares if anyone is interested in trying that to. We are all going to get so fat from this one.

I don't know what I did wrong, but I did not like this cake.  I was looking for a pie, not a cake.  The batter is so thick, that I could not spread it in the pan.  It turned out ugly.

While the cream cheese topping was good, I serve this with fat-free coolwhip!  It is delicious. 

I made these changes to made it low-fat and WW friendly -- ICBINB (light) in place of butter, 1 cup splenda in place of sugar, eggbeaters, chopped up a few pecans and used light bisquick.  Two cans of apple slices drained and chopped.  This turned out a moist, delicious cake!

I have a similar recipe to this in my files but this is much better. Only a few changes and that is I cut back on the sugar (this is a matter of taste), and added raisins (as suggested) plus some dried cranberries. Does not need cream cheese on top - actually prefer vanilla ice cream Thanks

This really isn't a pie, but a very dense and very yummy cake.  It tastes so good! I also like how easy it was to make.  I used a hand mixer to cream the butter and sugar together first, then added things one at a time blending each time, until the apples, then I used a spoon to stir them in.  Great recipe!  My kids loved it.
