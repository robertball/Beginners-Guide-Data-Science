These were pretty good, I really enjoyed having the eggplant in the potatoes.  I had no idea what to expect and it gave it really sophisticated flavor.  I think this is an awesome idea, works great if you want to sneak some veggies into dinner.  If I made these again I would add milk and butter to make it creamy but as far as flavor goes I don't think it needs it.

Love the taste of eggplant in the potatoes! Made and tasted per recipe... rated it 5 stars as is! Hubby likes creamy taters, so I did add a little butter and sour cream! Really didnt change the flavor but did change the texture, still a 5 star recipe!!!

this was a nice twist on traditional mashed potatoes.. i steamed my potatoes instead of boiling them and just threw the two cloves of garlic in with the onion that i diced up.. i used about a tablespoon and a half of margarine in place of the olive oil at the end and stirred in the sauteed onions, garlic, and bacon into the end product.. we're doing an italian version of bangers and mash tonight (hot italian sausage, red/green bell peppers, and onions) so this will be a nice healthy alternative to the regular mashed potatoes.. ty for the recipe

This recipe was an excellent way to use the eggplant I got in my organic food box delivery this week, along with organic potatoes. I'm not really a fan of eggplant, but I didn't want to waste it. I loved the dish. I only used 1 slice of bacon and I diced the onions before cooking them. I added the cooked bacon and onion into the eggplant, potato mixture before I mashed it. I didn't add the olive oil called for when I mashed, I added some mayonnaise, an old family tradition.  My husband loved this dish, also.

Good way to hide eggplant since I couldn't really taste it and cut down on fat. I skipped the bacon and the oil.

So good!  Great way to use a medium to small sized eggplant.  I added milk and butter on the advice of other reviewers.  I would make this again.

An idea to keep this vegan is to add nice, chopped olives at the end, and skip the salt in the potato water.
