This was a great loaf, but I had to cook it quite a bit longer than what it said in the recipe. Just make sure you check it with a knife or toothpick to make sure it's cooked. Fantastic taste, though!

This is a great basic recipe that even a non-veggie will enjoy.  I like to add some spicy brown mustard and soy sauce when I make it.

A great basic recipe. There are so many variations to this recipe.  I used white rice instead of brown and replaced 1 cup of carrot with 1 cup of celery. This saved me a trip to the grocery store which is always nice! With a baked potato and a salad it makes a nice dinner even for non-vegetarians. Also added a white sauce to spoon on the top.

I have enjoyed two years of successful cooking using this website and appreciate all that contribute.  Unfortunately, this recipe did nothing for me. I would strongly recommend the Cottage Cheese loaf or Carrot Patties over this.

Because I went gluten free, I used 1/2 cup cornmeal in place of the bread.  This isn't very firm when warm, but is easy to cut and serve when cold.  The peanut butter taste is more pronounced when chilled.  Great as a meal with vegetables or as a breakfast treat!

Had to bake it a long time way over what it says.  The family liked it I did not, so guess what they will not have again...Unless they cook.  LOL

This has an unusual taste.  I didn't care for it too much; for me it might be something to have as a side dish once in a great while, but I could definitely live without this recipe...  It wasn't so much that it was a bad recipe, it was just that the taste didn't suit my palate.
