I make a "traditional pizza" for my husband and son and a second one with flair for myself. This will go on my repeat list. The flavors worked great together simple and straightforward but flavorful, it was easy to make and I'm looking forward to plenty of left overs for myself as everyone else in the house will say "Cauliflower? On Pizza? Yuck!" Little do they know...Glad to be the first to rate the recipe and thanks for posting.

This turned out really good. We added sliced fresh tomatoes to the toppings and it turned out great!

We had left over prosciutto that we were looking for a recipe. We chose this one. I am not a fan of cauliflower but my wife likes it so I decided this might be a good pizza for our Friday evening weekly pizza. It turned out great to out surprise.

I decided to make this.  I changed the way to make it by a bit, and added a couple of ingredients to it.
