The tarragon marries perfectly with the chicken and smells terrific as it's cooking.  I use a pack of thighs instead of a whole bird, beacuse they turn out so moist.  Be sure to leave the pieces alone in the pan until they are nice and brown- don't move them around.  You want all those brown bits in the bottom of the pan.  I agree Sauvignon Blanc is the wine to use.  I serve mine over cooked rice instead of potatoes.  The end result is worth every minute of the prep time for this yummy meal.

This is a delicious recipe! The recipe calls for a DRY white wine, Sauternes is a very sweet wine, it would not be the optimal wine for this sauce. I used a Sauvignon Blanc, but any DRY white wine would do well. Yum!

Very easy & fragrant chicken recipe. I would use a different white wine tho-I used a sauterne & it didn't lend itself to the subleties of this dish. My picky son asks for this dish frequently!

I just made this again last night. Was horribly disappointed considering I loved it before. I used a Sauvignon Blanc and that was all I could taste in the sauce. Taste testing as I went along, I reduced by about 1/2 before adding the thickener, hoping to correct the wine taste. Because I love tarragon so much (hmmm perhaps because it relates to dragon?) I will try again, this time replacing 1/2 with either chicken or vegie stock.

This dish was fantastic!  My family loved it, we will have this again and again!  The only thing I did different was instead of a dry white wine, I used sherry, it was delicious.

Absolutely loved this recipe. Once the sauce was finished, I added it to the chicken in a slow cooker for several hours and it was delicious!

I was looking for a recipe to use up some of the Tarragon in my herb garden before it gets too cold.  When I saw the review that said this recipe was bland I thought "this might be the one" because Tarragon is subtle.  

Used chicken breast strips, butter and olive oil, sauvignon blanc, and by luck of draw had goat cheese on hand instead of sour cream.  Used more tarragon than called for in the recipe and a little less wine. Didn't need any cornstarch.    

Great flavor! Served with yellow (dry) sweet potato and herbed green beans.  Sweetness from onions offset well by tartness of wine and cheese - but not too strong,  so tarragon comes thru just fine.  

Also if you're using breast strips, you don't need to cook as long - mine was done after simmering 25 min.  Very quick and easy - will definitely make again - probably for company.

this was great.  My whole family (5) liked it.  The only things I did different is that I used chicken breast cut into strips.  Everyting else I did by the recipe.

Yummy!  I used bone-in chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken.  Next time, I will make it with chicken thighs instead.

After looking over the recipe, I knew I'd be serving it over rice and was concerned about everything being too pale.  I pounded out some chicken breasts and deep fried them with italian bread crumbs.  Instead of wine, I used sherry.  I added just a tiny bit of fennel seed to it, as the onions and tarragon was cooking, it smelled like it would be a good fit and it was.  I set the fried chicken over rice and then spooned over the tarragon sauce.  The crispiness of the chicken really helped this recipe not be so...homogeneous.

This was really nice!  I used boneless/skinless chicken breasts as that is what I had.  The wine I used was a semillion...gave it a nice grassy flavor that complimented the tarragon.  I liked the 'non heavy' cream sauce--I did not add the cornstarch mixture, though a little bit wouldn't have hurt.  This will go in my 'once in a while' folder...6 out of 8 thumbs up!  Thanks!

Easy to follow recipe, and fairly healthy.  I used chicken breasts cut into strips which cooked much quicker.  Delicious!

I have made this twice, but used chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken.  I cut each chicken breast in half to cut the cooking time even more.  Simple, elegant, and delicious!

Should have been a 5 star but I added some scallops, crab meat and shrimp to the sauce.  The added liquid made it more of a gravy.  Deserves a 5 star for flavour. Well received by guests.

Not too bad.  Tasted like it was missing something, though.  Rather bland.

This is really good!  I did what several others did and used boneless skinless chicken breast cut into strips.  I simmered the sauce for 25 minutes but didn't put the chicken in until the last several minutes.The sauce reduced quite a bit.  I added quite a bit more sour cream and even milk!  I wanted more sauce to serve over rice. This is really really good!

Not impressed. Chicken doesn't taste like chicken anymore. Smells great with the tarragon when cooking, but.  Don't see trying this again without major changes.

Fantastic recipe. Makes an amazing meal everyone was raving about.  I used a dry white wine. Served with new potatoes and some green veg.  Works Good with dried tarragon too.

This was boring, tasteless, bland in the extreme.  Even after adding several tablespoons of dijon mustard, more cayenne, and extra tarragon, this still didn't taste nearly as good as other Chicken Tarragon recipes I have tried.

Neither my husband nor I enjoyed this dish very much.  I only had chicken breasts on hand, so I took the other reviewers' advice and cut them into strips and browned them.  I followed the directions to the letter, and even went out and bought fresh tarragon and a nice bottle of sauvignon blanc to use.  It smelled delicious while cooking, but it tasted incredibly bland.  Maybe I should have added more garlic or tarragon? The only thing that saved this dish was drinking the left-over wine.  I won't be making this again.

This was very good, I used chicken strips also, there was plenty of sauce and it didn't need to be thickened. Will definately make again
Thanks
