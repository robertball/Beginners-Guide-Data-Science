Okay, real talk. For anyone just trying out the recipe: These aren't banana flavored pancakes, they are BANANA pancakes, or Pancaked Bananas if you prefer. You have to handle them thusly. 

First of all, LOWER TEMPERATURE! I cannot stress this enough. I made these as the pan was getting progressively hotter. The first one was great, the second tore, and the third was in loose floppy shreds. If the pan is hot enough that the batter bubbles and sizzles like eggs, it wont work, the bubbles destroy the integrity of the pancake and make it too thin to work with, and it'll scrunch and rip when you try to flip it.

Second: Flipping. These pancakes are made of BANANA. They are STICKY. You shouldn't have too much trouble if the heat is low and you've oiled the pan, but even still, you can't be a baby about flipping them. You can't inch the spatula under the pancake or push it to the side or casually try to- NO! None of that nonsense, you need to thrust that spatula under the pancake like you mean business. If you've never done this with other foods, it may seem stupid, but trust me, it works like magic. Just a quick thrust under the pancake and it's on.

Anyhow, these turned out great. I'm not Paleo or anything, I just like Pancaked Bananas, so I had them with a little bit of syrup. I'm totally making these again :)

Loved this recipe!  Was skeptical at first, but they were so tasty and sweetened themselves from the banana alone!  My two girls (8) LOVED them.  Even my husband loved them and he can be difficult when it comes to "healthy" eating!  I agree with the others who have said that cooking on a lower heat setting for longer, really helps.  I also found that if I made the pancakes a bit smaller, they held together better, as the larger pancakes would sometimes take longer in the center and then the edges would get a little crispy/dark (from the eggs frying.) Either way, will be working on this again to perfect my technique!  Thanks for the share!

These were tasty with fresh strawberries this morning. Blended ours in a food processor, used pecans, hemp hearts, added an extra egg and a heaping tbsp. of almond butter so I could omit the coconut oil. Lower heat for longer definitely seems to make all of difference.

These were yummy. Since I was out of walnuts, I used cashews instead of walnuts and just added to blender while mixing. Needs to cook a little longer on lower heat as I use cast iron.  I will definitely make again.

Delicious!! Makes a lot of pancakes! As others mentioned, cook slower at a lower temperature.

Great recipe! The taste is really good. My husband is a diabetic and pancakes made with flour and sugar is not something he can eat. Great alternative.

My kids wanted pancakes as a bedtime snack, so I wanted a healthier version. This was perfect. My six year old made the batter (we halved it, but it still made more than a dozen pancakes) and we added about 1/2 cup of oats to help it hold together. I didn't have walnuts, but we added blueberries. I do agree that cooking longer on a lower heat is the way to go. The first batch fell apart, but the rest came out perfect once I adjusted the heat. We loved them and we will be making this again.

This recipe is great! I was looking for a paleo version for myself but my two toddlers and hubby love it too. It has no sugars which I am conscious of when cooking/baking for my kids. The only changes I made were to cut back a bit on the vanilla extract. I thought it was too much for my taste the first time I made it. I also add a few tablespoons of almond meal. I followed a tip from another reviewer to make them small so they're easier to flip. Also, cook them for longer than regular pancakes. It's in our regular rotation now.

I usually double the recipe and can still fit these in my Vitamix. I blend everything but the walnuts and cinnamon. It makes it easier to clean my blender.  When pouring onto the griddle, do less than the recipe suggests. Maybe 1/8 cup each. After i pour, I take the nuts and cinnamon which I mixed together, and sprinkle a little on top of each. Cook a little slower and longer, and they will turn out. I freeze these in ziplock bags and they do well we eat them with homemade applesauce. Enjoy.

Taste was ok, but they were really thin. More like crepes. I would fill with ricotta and fruit next time and roll them up!

5 star all the way, next time I will add chopped walnut or maybe raisins :) also maybe in a separate pan have some thin sliced apples and raisins and nuts simmered in honey or maple syrup to top cakes with.

Excellent.  Made these for my wife who doesn't like pancakes and she loved these.  Made with a blueberry compote and will defiantly be making them again.

The flavor is good.  These are like a cross between crepes and pancakes.  They are more difficult to cook because they fall apart easily.  They would be very good served like a crepe with fresh fruit on top.  A very good paleo recipe.

Absolutely LUV this! It was my first time making Paleo pancakes. Since we're only 2 people I simply blended 2 bananas, some oats, 3 eggs, salt & vanilla extract, no baking soda or powder. Voila! Cooked over coconut oil, low heat & smaller dollops. Our finicky parrot devoured it! I can't wait to try different variations of this recipe adding fruit, nuts, & different spices! 2 thumbs up!

I used this recipe as a jumping off point and made some changes based on reviews and my whims. I made just one serving (next time I might do more but wanted to try first). I added a scoop of protein powder (I use Epic Original) because I wanted more protein and heft, sub'd 2 teaspoons of Almond Butter with Coconut Oil for the walnuts and coconut oil in the batter. I accidentally used baking powder instead of soda and just went with it. Completely forgot the vanilla. It did occur to me that, other than the addition of the egg and baking powder, I was basically taking my morning smoothie and cooking it.

Since I just made one batch, I was able to use my immersion blender in a large plastic cup (we get them when we go to sporting events - they make great immersion blender containers)- worked great. 

I tried to cook the first batch without coconut oil in a nonstick pan. I made mini-pancakes and they still stuck to the pan so the first batch ended up being more like "pancake hash". After adding 1/2 tsp of coconut oil to the pan, they came out perfectly - still cooked on relatively low heat. They puffed up nicely like a "normal" pancake would and the flavor reminded me of banana bread. I didn't need butter or syrup. I like them a lot and will make again!

I make this weekly for my kids, one of which does not even like bananas and runs away when his sister is eating one. I add way more cinnamon bc we love it and you can nix the maple syrup and powder with powdered sugar for a less messy sticky snack. Make sure to use a NONSTICK and let cook on each side atleast 3 minutes!!!!

I did not care for the flavor or the texture of these. They weren't too difficult to make until it came time to try to flip them. I tried 3 different spatulas and ended up making them into silver dollars just to flip them without them falling apart. However, my kids devoured them so if you are making them for kids they will probably be a hit. I will be freezing these so I can feed them to my Little one that is about to start baby led weaning..... but I will be making something else for myself to eat.
