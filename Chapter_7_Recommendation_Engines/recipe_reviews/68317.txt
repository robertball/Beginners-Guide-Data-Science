This was delicious! I had only red curry powder and it added a real zip to the recipe. I threw in some leftover ham just to use it up. This is a cold-weather keeper!

This is good!!! I was unsure of this combo of seasoning but we all loved it.  Not spicy hot...just good.  It doesn't taste like curry...it's just the combination that makes it good.  I didn't even have bacon but I'll bet that makes it even better.  We did sprinkle some sharp cheddar on top.  Bet it would be good with cilantro sprinkled on top too.

Followed recipe as written, came out tasty enough. Didn't seem quite as substantial as I was hoping for, so I threw in a can of kidney beans and improved it a bit. I might try it again sometime and add in some pork sausage or maybe ham hocks.  Overall - good enough for me, and I would recommend giving it a try.  Thanks for sharing Steffanie!

This soup was a real hit with my husband & I.  As he said, "I wasn't expecting much," I guess b/c it looked SO healthy and just like a thin soup, but it was delicious!!  I will definitely make it again.

This wasn't anything special. It was VERY tomatoey, which I wasn't a huge fan of. It was a good way to use up black eyed peas, but I wont make it again.

Great! I made it with a 1 pound bag of frozen peas and 2 cups of water. I also added 1/4 tsp. of cinnamon and simmered for about 2 1/2 hours.

Didn't have bacon, used ham pureed the onions and pepers before cooking.  Used less water to make really thick and put over rice.  Very good!

This soup was very good. The bacon, cheese, and green onions make the soup. The only change I would make is to use petite diced tomatoes or crushed. The tomato chunks were a little too big for my taste.

While on vacation,  was searching for our New Year's Black Eye Pea recipe, and found it almost exactly as a soup!  In my original recipe, I drain the Black Eyed peas, use 2 cans of rotel tomatoes (which are smaller cans, and smaller pieces of tomato) and no added water.  My original recipe does not call for sugar either, but does suggest garnishing with the crumbled bacon and parsley.  As a side dish, this has become a staple in my family for the past 15 years.  I printed the recipe, taped it onto a can of Black Eyed peas and attached a pre-measured bag of the dry spices as a Christmas gift for my college age nieces & nephews one year since they all ask for it when they visit.  It is a very pretty, colorful dish as well.  I may even try it as soup some time!

This turned out way better than I expected. I added tomato juice and chicken broth for more broth. I also used shredded chicken instead of bacon and it turned out fabulous!

I'm sorry that I can only give this 3 stars.  It just wasn't what I expected from a pea soup.  The tomoto and the spices overpowered the flavor of the peas and the bacon.  Not to mention that once my boyfriend dropped the left overs on the floor, we both decided it wasn't so "lucky!" :) I wouldn't make it again.  I'm sure there must be a better recipe out there.

This is a terrific cold weather soup.  I substituted vegetable broth for the water and used canned black-eyed peas with bacon.  If you like it a bit thicker, puree one of the cans of beans with a hand blender before adding.  Terrific with cornbread and a salad.

We love this soup without any alterations to the recipe.  It has a definite chili taste to it, but without all the calories chili has. It could definitely be spiced up if you like more heat, but it had just the right kick for me.

First, I won't rate recipes unless I make them EXACTLY the way they are posted (if you change something, it's not the same recipe!).  That being said, this is the best Black-Eyed Pea Soup I've ever made, and my picky-eating family agrees.  Wonderful seasoning combination.  Wasn't "spicy" in the sense of heat; just a very flavorful blend of spices.  Yes, it was tomato-y, but considering the ratio of black-eyed peas to tomatoes is 1:1, that was to be expected, but didn't have a heavy tomato flavor. The  only topping we added was the bacon (no cheese or green onions), which was the perfect finishing touch.    Will definitely make again.

Very delicious!  My husband is not a big fan of curry but he loved this soup. We had it for New Years Day lunch.

Loved it!  I omitted the dry mustard, curry powder and sugar, then added chicken Better Than Bouillon with the water and a one can of hominy.  Green chiles would be a good addition too.  Husband especially liked it with the melted cheddar and bacon on top.
