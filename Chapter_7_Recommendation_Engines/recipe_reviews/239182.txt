This was tasty! I used coconut milk in place of the coconut juice, as I had exactly 1 cup left over from another use. I also used canned pineapple (2 rings) with a bit of the juice, due to the coconut milk being a little thicker, to help thin it out a bit. This made for a nice lunch smoothie, and made me wish I was on vacation in a nice warm place. Bet it would be good with a shot of rum!
