Super easy recipe with super common ingredients, and a super nice finished product.  However, I recmmend you cut the sugar and the water to about 3/4 of the amount listed, as it is all very very sweet, and is a bit on the runny side.

I made this dessert for my husband for his special Father's Day meal and he loved it.

After reading all the reviews, I decided to use only 1/2 cup sugar, 3/4 cup water and increased to 1 1/2 Tablespoons cornstarch. It came out very firm, almost like lemon meringue pie. So next time, the only thing I will change is the sugar. I will use 1/2 cup sugar like I did this time, but do everything else the way it called for in the recipe. We would have preferred at least a bit of juiciness. Also, I cooked it for about 5 minutes longer because I wanted the top to be entirely golden brown and it was not quite like that at 45 minutes.

This would be great with any summer fruit or berries - I am going to try it with peaches when the season comes round.

This is the yummiest ooey gooey cobbler i have ever made. Usually i do berries or fruit topped with cake batter...but this pudding cake kinda way with pouring over the water mixture just sets everything together...VERY good. I used fresh sweet cherries...and cut back the sugar to half of what was called for and it was sweet enough with the dark cherries. A hit for sure...and i will be experimenting with different berries and fruit fillings. Thanks a bunch.

Reading through some of the reviews for this recipe, it quickly became apparent that results were widely varied – too sweet, not sweet enough, too thick, too watery.  It seems, as it is with pies, that in addition to individual tastes and preferences, how sweet or juicy the fruit is also makes a difference.  I decided to play it safe and reduce the sugar and water in the cornstarch mixture just a teensy bit – to 3/4 cup water and slightly more than 1/2 cup sugar - not huge changes, but it made me feel better.  :)  As it turns out, this is pretty much a perfect recipe.  Perfect baking time – 45 minutes was right on.  Perfect amounts of everything - in fact, my reducing the amounts of sugar and water, even a little bit, was probably unnecessary.   Perfectly delicious and it looks perfect too.  My first fresh cherry cobbler.  And it was perfect.  (As a side note, my fingers show the fruits of my labor.  They’re stained deep purple.  So to the uninitiated in cherry pitting as I was, it might be wise, particularly if you’re attending an event the next evening as I am, to wear some gloves)

This was an extremely disappointing recipe.  The end-product was too sweet, and the topping not cooked.  Even putting it back in the oven and adding cooking time didn't help.  The cobbler was missing any type of firm consistency, and didn't taste home-made.  I would advise anyone to go with a more traditional cobbler recipe and avoid this one.

I had an abundance of fresh cherries so I made this recipe.  I followed it exactly.  It turned out perfect.  Crust was golden and 'crackly' on top, tender but not soggy.  I'll try with blackberries & peaches also, this summer.  Used a square glass baking dish - it looked great, it tasted great.

As I am not a pie maker, I fix cobblers. I have a cherry tree, freezing them when ready. I put the frozen cherries, in the bottom as recipe calls for. I take a cobbler monthly to Church Family Day. Of course I double the recipe. The crust comes to the top, and is very good. Its the hit of the day. I'm glad I found this recipe.

Oh boy, we didn't like this recipe at all.  The biscuit topping was good, but 1 c of sugar was WAY too much and the syrup didn't thicken up at all - it was like cherry flavored sugar water.  I think 1 T of cornstarch to 1 c of water is much too low.  Next time (?)I would halve the sugar (at least) and add more cornstarch for thickening.  Definitely will use the biscuit topping again.

This is a juicy Cobbler that I prepared in a 9" x 13" pan, a bit larger than the 9 square recommended.  Some of the extra water evaporated away, I guess, but I wouldn't reduce the liquids in it.  I made the recipie with cherries fresh from the tree in our backyard. It is pretty and syrupy and tasty with a mellow buttery crust that is unbeatable with vanilla ice cream!

VERY unhappy with the outcome of this. It was really runny and nothing like I thought it would be. A total waste of ingredients and will not bother with this again. Sorry.

Good. I used Splenda instead of sugar & nobody knew the difference.  Next tim, I will reduce the amount of water & sugar in the simple syrup that you pour on the top.

This is fantastic.  We bought 10 pounds of cherries at the farmer's market so I had to start doing something with them. I don't like cobbler type stuff but had seconds on this! I had no problem with the crust at all. It had a beautiful shiny crunchy topping and had a gorgeous color and texture on the inside. I cut water to 3/4 cup and really got it boiling and stirred until it was all dissolved then put the bowl in the microwave for one more minute (just to make sure the cornstarch got going on the thickening) then poured it over the batter. I baked it for 1 hour. Superb with vanilla ice cream! (For those of you who thought it was sickeningly sweet, did you accidentally use canned filling?)

Definitely some of the best cherry cobbler that I've ever had!  I had bunches of cherries left after making jam this morning, so I decided to look for a baked cherry something recipe and found this one.  I only used 3/4 cup sugar in the syrup, and bumped the cornstarch up to 1 1/2 tbsp and it came out perfectly.  I also dissolved the cornstarch in a small amount of cool water first since it's much easier than in hot water.  Probably should let it cool a little more before serving next time since the cherries were really, really hot inside.  I will definitely keep this recipe!

Cut sugar by half.  Cut water from 1 cup to 3/4.  Expect to bake 5- 10 min more.

The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is that I made changes similar to those suggested by previous reviewers.  Cut the water for the syrup to 2/3 cup, sugar to 1/2 cup, added a smidge more corn starch, then I added 1 tsp of vanilla to the syrup.  It turned out perfect!  I baked it in a deep dish pie pan and baked for 55 mins.  Will definitely make it again!

This recipe is a hit at the office. I double everything but the boiling water and cook for 1 hour in a 9 x 13 pan. People BEGGED me for this recipe. When bing cherries go on sale -- look out! The consistency was perfect! Nice & firm.

Pretty much amazing.  After 10 minutes in the oven, I sprinkled the cobbler with old-fashioned oats.  It came out perfectly... thanks for the recipe; I'll be using it again!

As I was baking with sweet cherries, I used 1/2 cup sugar and 3/4 cup water.  If I make again, will use slightly deeper 9 inch pan.  Overall, good amount of sweetness.

This turned out great.  Reading some other reviews I'm wondering if one must think ahead about the amount of liquid comes out of your cherries and adjust the recipe accordingly.  While pitting my cherries, they produced about two cups of liquid.  I drained off a cup and used that instead of the cup of boiling water.  It still seemed like a lot of juice remained with the cherries, so I used a heaping T. of cornstarch.  I was very pleased how the cobbler turned out.  Good luck!  It's deffinately worth all the pitting!

This tasted pretty good, but I missed the traditional cobbler "texture".  I didn't use the sugar/water topping, because other reviews said that it didn't firm up.  Instead, I used equal parts of confectioners sugar and water, and drizzled it over the top when I removed it from the oven.  Made a nice, light, sweet topping.

I made this for our Super Bowl party and everyone raved about it.  I used two cans of cherry pie filling and added 1 tsp almond extract.  I also used self-rising flour and it made the most amazing crust.  I will be making this again and often!

I made it in a 9x13 pan as another user suggested.  It turned out very well.  Though I would use tart cherries next time, rather than the Rainier ones.  Too much sweetness. even with that though, it was still quite good.

Thoroughly enjoyed. With all of that sugar, I thought it would be icky sweet.  It wasn't.  Good flavor, perfect consistency.  I'm going to try using fresh blueberries with this recipe.  That sounds good too.  It's a definite keeper. Thanks.

Great Cobbler, always a hit.  I only added one thing, because I make this every july 4th (just a tad late on a review eh?).  I slice the cherries in half, and add roughly 1 1/2 cup fresh blueberries.  Red, White, and Blue!!  Simply delicious.

I found this recipe to be entirely too runny and I barely used half of the water/sugar/cornstarch mixture that went over the top.  I used fresh picked cherries and maybe they are too juicy to allow the mixture to thicken.  I have found that unless you pre-cook the mixture, you have no control over the consistency of the cherry mixture.  Very disappointed.

This recipe is ok. I used frozen cherries. Instead of just putting them in the pan like they were i added a little sugar, flour and cornstarch, then let it simmer for a while. I think the recipe would have been better if i would have put twice as many cherries in

Delicious and easy dessert. My only change would be to double the batter because it is the best part.

Although this recipe was quick and had great flavor, it did not have the traditional cobbler texture that we love.  The sugar, cornstarch, boiling water mixture that you pour over it at the end did not thicken and was completely runny.

This is a fantastic cobbler recipe. I followed it exactly as written - except where it calls for 1 cup of sugar to be blended with the water I only used 1/2 cup. The biscuit topping had a nice slightly crispy texture and there was the perfect amount of liquid on the bottom with the cherries. Will definitely be making this again!

This was good - I had to bake quite a bit longer, but that may be because the cherries were frozen.  They were last years cherries and lost some of their flavor, but overall it was really great over ice cream. Next time I will add fresh peaches and/or blueberries.

The first time I made this recipe I followed it exactly and it was way too sweet and kinda runny.  Now instead of the 1 cup of sugar I only put 3/4 cup and instead of the 3/4 cup I only put 1/2.  Also, so it won't be as runny, I put a heaping table sppon of cornstarch instead of a level one.  I have since made this recipe with cherries, apricots and plums and they have turned out perfect.  I only use enough fruit to cover the bottom of the pan, not 4 cups and I use a deep pan so it will hold all the liquid well.  Also they say it's a dough, but it really has more ot the consistency of a cake batter.  I hope this helps.  I am trying peach with it tonight.  I hope it's as good as the others.

Make sure the water is boiling when you pour it in.  I used tart pie cherries so it wasn't too sweet at all. I used the recipe exactly how it is after reading the reviews.  The only complaint was that it was too sweet but that is because people are using sweet cherries.

It was good, but a little too sweet. Per other people's reviews, I used 1/2 cup sugar and 3/4 cup water for the liquid part. Next time, I will use less sugar for the batter part too. I used fresh cherries.

Followed the recipe exactly. It was a bit sweet for our tastes- next time I'll cut the sugar down- especially if we have such wonderful Oregon cherries again! Will also make this with blueberries here in a few weeks. Thanks!

This is wonderful!  I'm new to making cobblers but this summer have made almost one a week for parties and this was the first cherry one I have made.  Being such a pain to pit the cherries I was worried at the outcome of this dessert.  After reading almost all the reviews I still focused on the few negative ones which I shouldn't have.  The only deviation from the recipe I made was to use 1/2 cup sugar in the batter and 3/4 cup sugar in the water to pour over the top.  It was perfectly sweetened for us.  Oh, also, it must cook a full hour instead of the 45 minutes.  The only problem I had was getting the cornstarch/sugar mixed with the water.  I had 2 small clumps of cornstarch in my topping after it was finished cooking but I am sure it's because I didn't stir it well enough.  I also used the full cup of water and it turned out perfect.  So, all that said, 1) please try this recipe, the topping is crunchy and wonderful, 2) if you have made cobbler before then you know about how much sugar your family can handle and can adjust accordingly, 3) even though I had my doubts that the topping would not be gooey (even at the very end of cooking) it wasn't and was absolutely perfect.

A bit on the soupy side WHEN VERY HOT! BUT super yummy. the cobbler toppin is super easy! Way beter the second day after it cools all the way. I have not tried anyother recipes because I am totally sold on this one! I needed a recipe for FRESH cherries because I cannot eat them fresh, I need them baked. I wanted it to be easy too.

I tried this recipe last night.  It was wonderful and my husband loved it.  I was worried about it being to runny so I boiled the sugar, cornstarch and water for about a minute before pouring it over the dough.  It turned out perfect, not runny at all.

I love fresh cherries but I have a hard time finding recipes for fresh cherries. I tried this one and my family & I loved it. It is very simple to prepare and tastes great. It reminds me of my deceased grandmother's blueberry & dumplings recipe. I do not have her recipe but I plan to try & substitute blueberries for cherries to see if the taste is the same.

Thr finished cobbler turned out soupy for me. I even used less water than called for. Also, because i used sweeter cherries the cobbler seemed much too sweet.  it tastes alright, but because it's so soupy i wouldn't want to serve it in the pan.

I only gave this a 2 star for now.  Normally I read reviews prior to using a recipe, but this time i was in a hurry and skipped that part.  That was my mistake.  Much like others, mine turned out WAY too mushy. It smelled great while baking though, but to have left it in any longer it would have burned.  I will try this recipe again, following some of the other reviews and reducing sugar and liquids.  I hope it tastes as good as it smelled baking!!!

Really good!  I used fresh bing cherries and like many people, I used 1/2 cup sugar in the batter and then 1/2 cup sugar and 2/3 cup water in the syrup and it turned out perfect, not too sweet with a slightly crispy top and a very pretty sauce.  I also used more cherries and put it all in a 3qt Pyrex baking dish.  I served it with a little vanilla ice cream and it was the perfect summer dessert!  I'm trying to keep myself busy so I'll stay out of the kitchen and resist the temptation to eat another big helping.  So good!

So good! I had a bag of cherries that were getting old so I decided to bake with them. This was the perfect recipe for it! I did tweet it by adding a little less sugar since my cherries were already sweet. The only other change I made was adding a tsp of vanilla extract when mixing the cornstarch, sugar and water because I love vanilla extract. Quick and delicious - the best combination!!

I have never commented on a recipe until now!  I had an over abundance of cherries and was looking for a cobbler recipe to try.  Lucky for me I came across this one!  It was very simple to put together.  The most time consuming part was pitting the cherries!  The reviews that stated that it came out runny HAD to have done something WRONG!  Mine came out firm, yet gooey and golden brown on top!  I just took it out of the oven and had to try a bite!  Gonna serve it later with vanilla ice cream on the side!  I can hardly wait!

I used a quart jar of cherries I canned in medium syrup. I drained the syrup, but I will save it next time in place of the sugar water mixture. I used 1/2 c. of sugar in the topping and 1/2 c. of sugar in the water mixture as others recommended. I also used about 1.5 T of cornstarch. With these adjustments, the recipe came out great. It was quick and easy to put together.

Great cobbler. Lactose intolerant, so used soy milk and lactose free butter substitute. Also, added an 1/8 teaspoon almond extract to cherries, and topped with chopped almonds. Ate it with lactose free vanilla ice cream.

Good recipe, but there needs to be a reduction in the amount of sugar in the liquid that is poured over the top of the cobbler before baking it.  The cherries were too sweet for my liking, it did taste good, but not what I consider as cherry cobbler.  It was missing the tartness from the cherries.  Other than that, a good recipe.  Just needs less sugar.

Fast and easy. I followed advice and halved the sugar and water: 6 Tbsp sugar in the batter and 1/2 cup in the syrup with 1/2 cup water, still using 1Tbsp cornstarch. The consistency was perfect. I used a 16-oz bag of frozen sweet cherries, thawed, and will make this again using peaches, or similar. I may add a little almond extract to cherries next time. A whipped cream topping or vanilla ice cream would go well on smaller portions.

This is a very good fresh fruit cobbler recipe.  I've used cherries twice, and once with blueberries and peaches.  The cornstarch is perfect for "gelling" up the juices from the fruit.  I will say that it needs to bake closer to an hour.  I cook it for about 50 minutes uncovered.  Then I cover it with aluminum foil for the last 10 minutes.

Dee-lish!  I used half of the sugar as other reviewers suggested and fresh cherries.  I think some reviewers are expecting the supermarket cherry pie taste (with artificial flavoring etc.).  If you would like that taste- just get a few cans of cherry pie filling and use that instead of the fresh cherries:)

Was perfect.  I added a little almond flavoring, but that's the only thing I did differently.  It would have been devine either way.  Great recipe! =)

This really is an excellent cobbler.  Pouring the cornstarch/sugar mixture over the top gives the doughy topping a crispy upper layer that is utterly wonderful.  The only thing that I would change is to use a little less sugar and add the juice from half a lemon to give it some tartness.  Thank you for the great recipe!

This cobbler recipe turned out very, very pretty. I used cherries that had been frozen and cut the sugar by half. It tasted very good, the crust was just the perfect texture. I should have used a larger pan because mine bubbled over quite a bit and made a huge mess in the oven before I caught it but otherwise this is a keeper.

Oh my - I'm eating this right now, warm from the oven.  Following other reviewers, I halved the sugar in the pastry and halved the boiling water/sugar/cornstarch mixture.  I added a half tsp of almond flavoring to the douch and  baked 55 minutes.  The consistency of the cherries with sauce is perfect!  Not at all runny but nice, juicy and thick.  The cake part is to die for - delicious flavor and lovely texture.  Oh... this is good.  I'm going back for more....

I did tweak the recipe slightly.  I cut the water down from 1c to 3/4c, used frozen organic raspberries instead of cherries (because my husband does not like cherry cobbler), and I used whole wheat pastry flour to give it some nutritional value. – When I make it again, I will also cut down on the sugar.  It is quite sweet.  Overall, it was a great recipe: easy to make, firmed up great, not watery, everyone in the family liked it.  I plan on making it again and again!

I made this with fresh sweet cherries and it was loved by the family. I had peaches and used this same recipe....the family said that is a keeper and must be made at least once a month. Very easy and very yummy....I made exactly as written.

Tasted good, but I put too much sugar in mine by accident- big mistake, it was wayyyy to sweet!

Also, mine required longer than 45 minutes as it was very doughy and undercooked.

Delicious! I always make a cherry dessert of some sort for my MIL for her birthday! I will have to look NO further! I did reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup and the water to 3/4 for the liquid, according to some of the reviews. I used tart, frozen, Michigan cherries and baked it for 55 min and it was awesome!

Decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup (just right for the sweetness) but still way too r unny.  Needs more thickener, perhaps 1.5-2X the cornstarch depending on the type of cherries you use, otherwise decrease the water would make it better. You can actually drain the liquid out after baking (very messy!), add more corn starch to the liquid and pour it over the topping, but you'd have to rebake it all over again. I did just that and managed to salvage the dessert.  Everyone enjoyed it!

Loved it!!!  Since we did not know how to pit raw cherries, we covered them with water and brought them to a boil to soften and make it easier to pit. The water took on the flavor of the cherries so instead of using plain boiling water, we used the cherry juice. Cut back on the sugar by half because we had the sweet cherry juice. Really was a great way to use up our cherries!!

Very good...tons of alterations reviewed so I had a hard time deciding what to do with the recipe.  I usually decide to do exactly what the original recipe calls for the first time, but in this case (as I prefer to eat my cobblers with ice cream) I didn't want it to be terribly sweet.  I cut the amount of sugar I mixed with the water to 3/4 cup.  I used the same amount of water (1 cup), but I probably had closer to 4 cups of fresh cherries.  I thought the sweetness and consistency turned out really nice.  The dough topping is the best part though!  Will definitely make again, as my daughter and husband both loved it!

I was worried after reading all the mixed reviews. To alter the recipe or not? I decided not to, except maybe filling my measuring cups a tiny bit less with sugar. Yes, this was very sweet. Almost too sweet, but not sickeningly so. I served with homemade vanilla ice cream, and it was perfect. We did use fresh cherries. I recruited my 12 year old to pit the cherries and we found a great way..... with a drinking straw, only it was too flimsy, so I took apart a pen and used the barrel. It worked like a charm. I won't try to explain the procedure here. Google cherry pitting with straw. I didn't have a problem with my cobbler being runny after it cooled a bit. I would make this again and maybe if using sweet cherries, would cut back overall sugar by 1/4 - 1/3 cup.

After reading several reviews I modified the recipe by reducing the amount of sugar to almost half, reducing the water to 3/4 cup, increased the amount of cherries to 4 cups, used a mixture of whole wheat and self rising flour.  It is still too sweet, but edible.  It's the perfect texture, not too runny, and the crust is good.  If I make this again I will reduce the amount of sugar to about 1/4 of what the original recipe calls for.

I used freshed picked sweet cherries and doubled the recipe for a 13x9 pan.  The recipe sounded a little weird.  I couldn't imagine pouring boiling water on the top of the batter.  But I followed the instructions, and baked it the full 45 minutes.  Let me tell you, it is fabulous.  I think next time I would add a little vanilla to the batter, but it is still very tasty.

Too runny. We drained the 'cherry water' off before eating. If I make it again, I will either precook the cherries with the boiling water to thicken before baking, or omit the boiling water altogether.

I made this recipe as printed, except I substituted two cans of tart red cherries in water (drained) because fresh cherries were not available.  The recipe was perfect.  The crust was crisp on top and moist in the center.  The cherry layer was perfect - not too sweet or too tart with the right proportion and consistency of sauce.  It's difficult to find fresh tart, red cherries and sweet cherries would make this recipe very sweet.  But if you can locate tart cherries, it's an easy and perfect recipe.  (and in a pinch or when you don't have time to pit cherries, the canned cherries worked very well)

This is very very good!  I also reduced the sugar in both the batter and the syrup by 1/4 cup each, and added a tsp of almond extract to the batter.  I'll definnitely use this recipe again with other fruits!

I followed the suggestions from the reviews and mine turned out perfect! I cut back on the sugar and I added about 1 teaspoon more of cornstarch and cooked it for 5 minutes longer. It is yummy!! I used a cherry pitter from Pampered Chef which works quite nice!

Let me first state that I despise cobbler. Gooey baked fruits are not for me. I initially used this recipe because I had extra fresh cherries to use up. What I didn't expect to ABSOLUTELY LOVE the taste! I used 4 ramekins and put a layer of batter, then cherries, batter, and the sugar syrup on top. Also, I ran out of white sugar after making the batter, so I used light brown sugar for the sugar/water syrup. DELICIOUS! The sticky top crust was sooo good! Served with Marinated Tuna Steak with white rice, Grilled Garlic Artichokes, and Idaho Fry Sauce for the artichokes.

Followed recipe exactly, but realized last minute I didn't have cornstarch.  I used two tbsp of all purpose flour in place of the 1 tbsp of cornstarch and it still turned out perfect.  Will make this again and again.

I am admittedly not very good in the kitchen, but this recipe was so easy.  And even my husband who is not big into desserts, really liked it.  It's sweet without being overbearing.  I made it with fresh cherries.

Holy cow this stuff is good. I doubled it because I knew it would disappear immediately. Subbed a bit of whole wheat flour in, reduced the sugar and water by a quarter cup each for the slurry, and it was absolute heaven. Will make again for sure!

I was disappointed.  I followed the recipe to the letter and it was very watery when it came out of the oven.  Overnight it thickened up a little, but still I did not like the taste.  I did not like how the cherries came out, how the crust tasted, or the runnyness.  My husband will eat anything and he didn't even like it. I don't think if a recipe is "good" recipe that ingredients and their measurements should have to be altered to make it so (as in previous posts).

This is the exact recipe our family has used for years for cobbler.   Any fruit will work.   I use cherries, berries, peaches etc. and if they are frozen I just reduce the amount of liquid but be sure some hot water is poured over the cornstarch mixture to take it down into the fruit for thickening.

I had never had cobbler before, so I didn´t know what to expect. As per other reviews, I halved the sugar on both the batter and the water and I thought it was just right. I also added vanilla extract to the batter. It was pretty good, my family liked it, I would probably make this again, but I would still like to check out other cobbler recipes.

My daughter and I picked sweet cherries and picked more than we needed.  I found this recipe and thought I would try it.  I followed it exactly except the last part.  I did not add the water, 1 C sugar, or cornstarch.  I put the cherries on the bottom and batter on top and baked. It was DELICIOUS and contained alot less sugar.  This is definitely a keeper.

Delish!  This was my first time making a cherry cobbler and this recipe turned out great.  After reading the other reviews, I also cut the sugar by about half and added 1 tsp. almond extract to the dough.  I used 1 cup dark sweet cherries along with some fresh strawberries, and sliced up some canned peaches.  Enjoy!  It is definately a keeper.

Excellent cobbler!  I only made a few adjustments.  I added 1 tsp of vanilla to the dough, boiled the water, sugar, and cornstarch for a minute, and cooked for about 55 min until the top was a nice golden color.  I used sour cherries and didn't have a problem with the amount of sugar in the recipe.  I was panicked when I poured the sugar water over the cherries and dough, but it thickened nicely and wasn't watery at all.  I will definitely add more cherries next time because I like a lot of fruit.  This was quickly consumed, and I will use it as a base recipe for other fruit cobblers.

I made this in a 9x13 pan. I used a little over 4 cups fresh cheeries. They were really sweet so I cut back on my sugar. In the topping I added a little Almond extract.  YUM!!!  I also mixed the starch, sugar & water & heated it almost to a boil before I put it on top.  It was perfect!!!  The whole pan was gone as soon as I made it. I received great reviews from the cobbler, even from a person who doesn't even like cherries! The almond extract was the litl' bit of extra something that kicked it up a notch. Everybody wants my recipe.

This was my first cobbler.  I don't cook a lot of desserts.  I happen to have just picked fresh cherries and needed a recipe.  This one was wonderful.  I had tart cherries, so the cobbler wasn't too sweet.  The water mixture I boiled together to thicken a little before I poured it over the top.  Changed nothing else, and everyone said it was the best they had tasted.  Thanks for my cobbler success!!!

This was very tasty - even better the second day.  

I reduced the sugar in syrup to 3/4 cup and that was plenty.   I also used a 9X13 pan which worked well - however you do need to cut the cooking time by about 10 minutes using that size.  Also, don't worry if it's runny when you take it out of the oven - it firms up as it cools.

This was not very good.  I followed the directions carefully and ended up with soggy crust and soggy topping.  It would have been much better to substitute graham cracker crumbs and eliminate the milk.

Every one enjoyed it for our July 4th party! Takes dedication to use fresh cherries (and messy, stained hands).  But everyone loved the fresh cherries.  Be careful not to fill the pan too high- I had spillage in my oven.  Enjoy!

Easy and tasty! It was a tad too sweet for my liking, but everyone else loved it. My oven runs hot, but the dough cooked perfectly and was finished in 30 minutes. I'd love to use this recipe with other fruit in the future.

Great recipe to use with fresh cherries. I did cut the sugar a bit and the water a little. This made the syrup nice and think. The topping was everyone’s favorite.

Everyone loves this cherry cobbler!  There are never any leftovers. I make almost as written except I add cinnamon and nutmeg and vanilla to the biscuit mix. Too runny? Add a little more starch. Great recipe, thank you.

I added a teaspoon of vanilla to the batter. Everything needs some vanilla. May want to adjust the sugar level depending on how sweet or sour your cherries are. I also used the juice I got from pitting the cherries in place of part or all the water.

I loved this cobbler, delicious!   I used frozen cherries, drained the juice, and used a cup of juice in place of the water, as  called for in the recipe.  Next time I will use a bit more corn starch to make the syrup a bit thicker. I shared it with my neighbors, they liked it, also.

This was simply wonderful and a perfect warm dessert to be topped with vanilla ice cream.  I used frozen cherries and because we prefer fruit over flour toppings...I increased the fruit to 5 cups and took the advice of others by reducing the final cup of sugar and water to 3/4 cups each...maintaining the 1 Tbsp. Cornstarch.  Turned out perfect!  So easy...definately will be making thus again!

Used 1/2 cup of sugar with 3/4 water in the topping part.  I gave this 5 stars for the great taste as well as the ease of making.  Got this whipped up in no time.  Reminds me that I also put whipped topping on top for extra prettiness! Highly recommend!

I made the recipe as is, and while it was very good and  had a good overall flavor, the sweetness was a little too much. The next time I make it, I will be sure to cut the sugar as others have suggested.

This tasted delicious! I did make the slight changes recommended by many people, reducing the boiling water to 3/4 cup and the sugar to1/2 cup. I also used about 5 cups frozen cherries so upped the cornstarch to 1.5 tbsp, but next time I think I would use even more cherries, maybe 6 or 7 cups because the ratio of cherries to topping was pretty low. The topping was great though, light and cakey and not too sweet. It did take more like 1 hour 15 minutes to bake, but not sure if that was because of the frozen cherries. With these slight changes I'll definitely be making this cobbler again!

I made this recipe as written and it was petty good.  However it didn't taste homemade... maybe in part because my cherries were not very tart and  I prefer a topping more like pie crust..  There was also just too much liquid in the fruit.. I prefer The Best Ever Blueberry Cobbler by  Jen... The proportions are perfect with any fruit.... Thank you for the recipe.

I had to make this recipe exactly as is for the first time because of so many conflicting reviews about it being so sweet and runny and other reviews that it was just perfect.  I used fresh cherries and the recipe was definitely too sweet and a watery.  I ended up baking it an extra 10 minutes because the dough was pale and the cherries were quite juicy so I was hoping to thicken the sauce a little.  Except for those issues, the flavor was quite good.  I did add 1/4 tsp. each of cinnamon and almond extract to the batter and I now wish I had doubled the batter.  It was good but there just wasn't enough of it.  As for technique, pouring the water mixture over the dough didn't make sense to me so I poured it down the sides of the pan to make a sauce for the fruit and not dilute the batter on top.  Next time I will reduce the sugar and water and double the batter ingredients.

This recipe was super easy to put together!  It was lovely -- tart and rich at the same time.  The top browned up beautifully and the sauce drizzled over it provided a nice finish.  We ate it with french vanilla ice cream.  I made slight revisions as suggested by other reviewers.  I cut the water and sugar in the syrup down to ¾ of a cup each  and upped the amount of cherries to 4 cups.  Everyone gobbled it up despite having had a BIG dinner beforehand.

Way too sugary, the top didn't cook all the way, and it was watery under the cobbler.

Excellent recipe and dessert was delicious and a hit with company.  There were no left overs as several second helpings - it was family so no holding back.   Now I recognize that I happened upon the largest and tastiest cherries I have every eaten the first time I made it. But it was so good, I brought the recipe out for different guests the next week. Thanks

I used 1/2 cup sugar for the topping and 1/2 cup sugar for the syrup since I didn't want it to be too sweet.  I had to cook it for an extra 30 minutes in order to even get the top to brown up.  I didn't use boiling water for the sugar and cornstarch.  It's hard to mix things in hot water without it clumping!  Husband complimented it.  I am planning on trying another recipe before I decide if this will be my cobbler stand by.

My husband declared this the best cobbler, it is not so sugary sweet.  I made it per the recipe except I used twice the amount of cherries and baked in an 8x12 dish.

I was disappointed in this recipe.  It was very sweet, even with cutting the sugar down a little.  I thought the ratio of "dough" to cherries wasn't good.  I think I may try it again, this time doubling the topping.

Made mine GF and used coconut oil. Tried 3/4 cup sugar, 3/4 cup liquid including cherry juices, 2 TBSP cornstarch and that was wickedly sweet. I added the syrup directly to the cherries in the pan, then spooned the batter over the cherries. The baked topping texture was more like a cake than a cobbler. The cherries were perfectly moist with a bit of sauce, not thin and watery. Next time I'll try far less sugar in both the syrup and the cake. My husband added milk to his dish to take the bite out of the cloying sweetness. Otherwise, good flavor notes.

I made the cherry cobbler for my mother. She and my husband loved it. I hate cherries so I didn't try it. Today I'm making a mixed raspberry and blackberry cobbler. I added just a touch of cinnamon. Can't wait  - there's a gallon of vanilla ice cream in the freezer. Thanks for this recipe. So very easy!

I followed the directions exactly and I'll admit, many of these comments had me worried it would turn out runny. But it turned out perfect!  I'll definitely be making this again.

Great with cherries. However it is even better with blackberries. Took it to the neighborhood ice cream social... All raves and no left overs. I upped the amount of fruit a little and smashed half the blackberries. I would include a picture but the is none left.

Pretty darn good!  Simple, tasty and great looking.  Definitely not grandmas, but with the simple ingredients and quick turnover, well worth it.  I used less sugar in the syrup as suggested.

Well, Ms. Mary Lehmann, you have a winner.  I've never considered myself a baker. Now my husband wants your cobbler every week - I can vary the fruit, but the rest MUST stay the same.  Success, at last.  Thanks for making me look so good on my first try!! Really easy. Followed recipe except for corn starch - had none, so I spooned flour over the cherries and stirred until covered. Crust was beautifully brown. Cherries were tart, but with just the right sugary syrup.  This was exactly what we wanted. Thanks again, Mary for such a great recipe.
PS. I used a plastic straw to pit my fresh cherries.  Took far less time than my "pitter" tool.

This was pretty good for how few ingredients there are. Next time I might add more cherries and a bit of vanilla to the "cake" batter. I liked the simplicity of the process and the end result.

We loved this recipe (our first cobbler).  We used Rainer cherries, and cut the sugar to half in the pour over mixture (since they were not sour cherries) and the water to 3/4 of the recommended.  Other than that, did not change a thing and it was wonderful!

This recipe saved me in a pinch with guests on short notice and lots of freshly picked cherries in my fridge. The flavor was very good, but it was quite "goopy". I agree with others who recommend toning down the amount of sugar in the sauce...1/2 cup was plenty.

Fantastic! I used a little less sugar in the slurry but just by ½ a cup. You could do more if you wanted but I think it lends itself to the overall product, making the crust crispy and sweeting up the cherries. This is particularly nice if you don't have sweet cherries as it is. The only time consuming part was the cherry pitting but I enjoyed myself and it looked like a crime scene in my kitchen, of course I was also working with beets simultaneously. 
This recipe is SUPER easy and I was able to put it together with out my husband even noticing. I was a true suzy homemaker last night - Prepared a fantastic dinner and followed it up with a warm dessert straight out of the oven. Wonderful, Wonderful, Wonderful!!!

This recipe came out really good, even though I cheated/improvised and used a combination of cherry pie filling and blueberry pie filling.  Very nice batter, not too gooey, not too cakey.  Everyone was buzzing about it...probably buzzing because of all the sugar, considering I didn't cut the amounts even though i was using pie filling, but still...they loved it.  Would place a photo here, but it didn't last long enough around the vultures that I was feeding.

I kept the sugar the same in the breading but cut the filling sugar in 1/2, added a little almond extract (no more than a 1/4 t. to further to curb the tartness of the cherries.  Lastly, I substituted the 1c. water for 1c. cherry juice from my fresh cherries; however, I would cut it down to 3/4c. the next time.

Thanks everyone for your input.  I liked the amount of sugar in the topping, but reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup in the liquid and added another 1/4 cup of boiling water since my family likes more juice.  I also baked it an additional 5 minutes.  They devoured it in one sitting.  They let me know this morning they'd like to try it next with peaches & blackberries.  I'll definitely be making it again!

This was good! Other reviews suggested cutting the sugar, I wasn't sure if they meant the sugar in the dough or that you pour over so I cut both by half. So glad I did, it was still very sweet. I followed the recipe exactly besides, and baked in a deep dish pie plate. It wasn't too runny for me, but I did bake it for an extra ten minutes or so. I also used frozen cherries, a blend  of sweet and tart. 
Thanks very much for the recipe!

After reading other reviews, I decreased the amount of sugar in the batter to 1/2 cup, but left it the same in the water mixture.  I also had to make this dessert vegan and so substituted almond milk and coconut oil one-to-one for the milk and butter.  It turned out perfectly.  Slightly runny, delicious cherry filling on the bottom, and nicely browned crust on top.  If you wanted you could probably use slightly less sugar in the water mix, but it was great as-is.  I'll be repeating this one!

This was a good recipe.  It did end up being a bit runny, but it did not take away from the flavour.  It just added to the cake.  I added cinnamon to the batter.

I loved it but I'm giving it four stars because I did reduce the sugar content per other reviews. I also didn't have a ton of cherries to use so I made a reduced recipe and used large silicone muffin tins so it turned into individual serving portions...Delicious!

We went and picked lots and lots of cherries! So, I needed a quick, easy and tasty recipe for a dessert. This fit the bill. I made it for the fourth of July and also made it again on the fifth for a dish to pass.

This can be made with Splenda to substitute for sugar without sacrificing the taste or texture.  It was really good.  I used cherries from a tree that had pretty tart cherries.  It really was a great use for them.

I followed the recipe exactly and everything was perfect! My husband and I took our grandsons cherry picking yesterday and had 2 big buckets full. I don't know what we were thinking - just got carried away picking. I'm starting to try different recipes on this site and started with this. Perfect with vanilla ice cream on top while still warm. I will probably make this again.

A little too sweet for me, next time might try rhubarb or lemon juice, cinnamon or nutmeg maybe. But, both ds and dh said it was the best thing ever. And if I continued to make it they,d both gain pounds. So, five star worthy because very very little I make received such high regards.

Very tasty and loved by my family.   As suggested by others, I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup for the syrup mixture.  However, that was the only change I made.   I used frozen cherries picked from my neighbour's tree and found that cooking time was longer - it took about an hour to bake and for the cobbler to brown.  Very good and will make this again with this year's cherries.

This tasted so wonderful and I don't even like cherry cobbler.  I made if for my dad for Father's day because it's his favorite.  I took the advice on the liquid topping and used only 1/2 c sugar and 3/4 c water.  I kept the tablespoon of cornstarch the same and when I was pouring it on top of my crust I only used 3/4 of it because it seemed like too much.  I wish I had remembered to get a picture of it because it looked amazing.  It tasted great too.  I might use the full 1 c of water next time though because it was pretty formed (no where near runny).  And in case anyone was wondering, I used frozen black cherries (Publix brand) for my filling as I couldn't find any fresh in my area.  Hope this helps!

Our friends gave us a ton of cherries from their tree and I found this recipe as I was trying to figure out what to do with all those cherries.  This was so awesome.  I loved the topping and it was perfect with vanilla ice cream.  Thanks for the great recipe!  Can't wait to make again.

This has delicious taste! I should have reduced the amount of water, but even though it was runny it still tasted great. It also thickened up when eaten as leftovers.

Great flavor but I found that 1 cup of water mixed with the sugar and corn starch was WAY to much!  Will cut back on the amount of sugar and definitely halve the water added.

This is yummy.  When I don't have fresh cherries, I use 2 bags of frozen cherries or a berry mix, and it turns out great.  I put it in a 13X9 glass dish instead of the 9X9.  I only use 1/2 cup sugar in the batter and 3/4 cup with the corntarch/water.  Rave reviews whenever it is served!

This was very good! I followed the recipe ingredients to the letter, but I divided up the amounts into 4 large ramekins to cook them in. It took longer in the oven for the dough to brown up so total cooking time was 1 hour. We served it with a scoop of natural vanilla ice cream. Delish!!!

I really liked the flavor of this and I did use less sugar because I used frozen sweetened cherries.  Next time I will decrease the liquid because it was too watery, but good!  The next day after being refrigerated it was not nearly as watery.  I really liked the dough.

My husband calls this the best cobbler he's ever eaten.  I've made it a dozen times this summer, with cherries, blueberries, and peaches.  I make it exactly to the recipe, and it is perfect every time.

My husband and daughter are diabetic, so I made this recipe using Splenda.  I am not a fan of the Splenda taste, but they both raved about it and asked me to make it again.  I also tried it using fresh peaches - turned out just as yummy.

My daughter gobbled it up with ice cream on top! Great recipe but I did follow the advice of others and lessen the amounts of butter and sugar used. I also added 1tsp vanilla and cinnamon to the mix.

Great recipe, I however did as others  and modified the liquids and sugar.  Still too much juice but very good flavor, very easy to make as my husband is the one who baked the cobbler. We will be using this recipe again.

Really great recipe. Easy to make.  The only two things I changed is I mixed 3/4 cup water with 3/4 cup sugar and 1 1/2 tablespoons of cornstarch. Still was a little sweet. 1/2 cup sugar would probably be best.

I used some chopped peaches to make 3 1/2 cups of fruit as I didn't have enough cherries.  I reduced the sugar in the dough to 1/3 cup.  The sugar in the liquid more than makes up for the difference.  Everything came out wonderful.  This isn't a cobbler so much as it is what we used to always call a "Pudding Cake."  Wonderful warm with vanilla ice cream.

YUM! I did it exactly as the recipe said and it turned out great - I think I had a few extra cherries than called for (I didn't measure them) so I cooked it for about 10 minutes longer and it was perfect. It wasn't too sweet but I did use fresh sour cherries from our cherry tree so maybe that made the difference.
I will definately make this again!
Thanks!

Like others suggested, I halved the sugar in this recipe and it came out FANTASTIC! My mother-in-law is a huge cobbler fan and she also happens to be a bit picky when it comes to cobbler, but even she agreed it was great. Definitely making this recipe again.

This was yummy.  My husband really enjoyed it.  It was very easy to make, and I will definitely make it again.  I cooked it exactly according to the recipe, and my only criticisms are that the juice was pretty runny and very sweet (just a tad less sweet would have been perfect), and that the crust seemed to taste a little more "flour-y" than I like.  I'd probably try to reduce the sugar and water poured over at the end, as many have suggested.  But I'd rather have more juice than not enough, so not a big deal.  I also don't think my cornstarch was mixed in with the sugar well enough (I could see a couple of white lumps on top after it was baked), so that could have contributed to the runniness.  I don't know what to do about the distinct flour flavor of the crust.  The very top part that was well baked was delicious!  Maybe I just needed to cook it longer?  The crust did seem to cook through a little more after sitting a while out of the oven, and that helped the flour flavor a little.  Overall, I did really enjoy this cobbler and the recipe was simple.  I'd definitely serve this to guests.

This was pretty tasty. I was looking for a good cobbler recipe and I used raspberries (I had a craving...). It probably turned out a bit juicier than if I would have used cherries, especially since I used frozen raspberries, but it was still tasty. Thanks!

This was great - I was freaked out about putting the water on top but it was wonderful when it came out!  I used frozen (fresh picked by us last season) and I did cut the sugar down to suit our taste...it was great. I make a big pan of everything I bake, my hubby loved it and this was something that even my fussy Pastor enjoyed! Thanks for sharing!

This was so good!!  I do wonder why people don't like it, and I wonder if it is more due to the presentation.  There was a lot of liquid left at the bottom-- I'd probably make less syrup next time, but the bottom of each slice was just lightly soaked with the syrup, and it was perfect!  I did reduce the sugar in the batter by nearly 1/2 based on previous reviews, but did the rest exactly as described.  I'll be making this one again!

This was good,but we felt it was missing some zing. For sure I will try a crumb topping over it next time (oatmeal, brown sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg maybe).

I hate to leave a poor review but this was not good.  I think it may be because of my cherries though.  They weren't very flavorful raw and weren't any better cooked.  The cobbler topping was okay but not great.  I had high hopes for this recipe but was disappointed!
