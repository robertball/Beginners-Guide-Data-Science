It really does seem to be true that almost anything is improved with bacon, and it was the same with these potatoes.  I love the combination of cream cheese and chives so I omitted the shallots and substituted chives for the parsley. To dress this up I prepared it in advance and piped it into mini cocottes, then baked them at 375 degrees about 25-30 minutes.  Just as impressive as it was delicious.

What is not to love?  These are delicious. I don't use a mixer to mash potatoes though, a hand masher does a great job without creating a sticky, gluey mess. If you use a mixer, be careful to not over beat.

These were amazing!! I wouldn't change a thing. A nice alternative when you want mashed potatoes as a side, but your main dish doesn't produce a gravy. We accompanied these with cabbage rolls. Incredible. Will definitely make these again :)

Labor intensive but really yummy - I left my red skins on to add color and vitamins.  I also used onion instead of shallots and turkey bacon to cut back on the grease and fat.  Delicious!

3/27/16 - made again and doubled recipe (or thought I did) but realizing now that I didn't add enough cream cheese or sour cream.  They were on the dry side.  Disappointed but my fault, not the recipe.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was a big hit!  Epic, indeed!  My only problem was that I didn't have "baking potatoes" (which I believe must be a lot larger than regular potatoes), so I used a few more of my regular size potatoes, but I still ended up with too much creaminess and not enough potato.  For this recipe, if you don't have large baking potatoes, I would recommend using about 8 regular size potatoes to provide adequate texture and vegetable to disperse the epicness into!

This was a great recipe. Made it just as is and it's a great change from just plain mashed potatoes. Plus we used the leftovers to made potato cakes durning the week! Delicious!!

I doubled this recipe. Because my baking potatoes were on the small side, I did throw in a couple more just for good measure. I did use homemade roasted garlic instead of regular garlic. We all were MMMMM'ing all through dinner. Very delicious. Definitely a make again.

Made this for thanksgiving and it was a huge hit! Only addition I made was adding milk. I made before I arrived and didn't want them to get too dry after being reheated. Delicious!

OMG, these were the most amazing mashed potatoes I have ever had. I served with that hamburger steak, onions and gravy recipe...I too used French onion soup instead of beef broth. YUMMMMMMY!I got such rave reviews and its so easy and quick. Thank you for sharing all these delish dishes. I'm a big fan and I'm always up for experimenting with new recipes :)

Very good.  Skipped the shallot and bacon--didn't need it.  However, I'm sure they would have taken these potatoes over-the-top.  Subbed chive for parsley and used some roasted garlic I had on hand.  Used a potato masher because I was afraid of ending up with a pot of glue; I've done it before.  Never again with an electric mixer.

Nothing epic about these.  Pretty standard ingredients. Nothing that would make it epic though. Tasty sure. Epic not.
