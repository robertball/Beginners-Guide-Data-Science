Because I don't have a juice machine, I added a little orange juice to get the ingredients moving in my blender. I skipped the mint because the kids don't like it. We all enjoyed this. EDITED: I make this often during the summer and add a spoonful or two of nonfat greek yogurt and a little vanilla extract which makes it creamy and delicious--very similar to an Orange Julius but with half the fat!

I don’t have a juice machine, but Hubs wanted a smoothie this morning and these were exactly the fruits I was looking for.  An added bonus? – no yogurt.  I wasn’t crazy about the idea of pouring this over ice anyway.  So I blended the fruits as called for,  using twice as many (frozen) raspberries, mainly just to use them up, a handful of ice and some milk to make the blender go.  Knowing Hubs would prefer this, I skipped the mint in the mix, using it just for garnish.  This worked well and tasted good too – only problem was that it needed some sweetness, so I mixed in Splenda to taste.  Hubs loved it.  I don’t drink smoothies myself, I just make them, so the final review is his – pleasantly sweet, filling, great, balanced blend of flavors and, surprisingly, he didn’t miss the typical yogurt-based smoothie.  (Please note that this recipe calls for a juice machine, not a blender!  The blender will not move without added liquid!)

This is a terrific start to a great smoothie. In a  blender place a frozen banana, frozen berries and nonfat plain yogurt to make a complete breakfast drink. Delicious! Using orange juice also works well. Experiment!

Great recipe.  Been making this type drink in my magic bullet for years.  If I need to make a larger one, I use my nutri-bullet.   I keep a bag of frozen wild blueberries and pineapple chunks in my freezer all the time.  I also freeze bananas that are starting to be overripe. I leave out the mint due to personal preference.  No need to pour over ice.  The more frozen fruits you use, the thicker it will become.  I use the same ingredients as the recipe, minus the mint.  In my magic bullet  My favorite is to use - one orange, a banana, berries, couple chunks of pineapple, and Activia if I'm in the mood.  It is such a versatile recipe.  I just keep putting fruit in until it is full.  One orange makes enough liquid for it.  Yummy

I've been making almost this exact drink for over a quarter century to have with a plain bagel or toast for most breakfasts during the week!! What I do differently is use a blender with 6 to 8 oz orange juice (3 to 4 oranges), 1 cup of raspberries, 1 banana and instead of using mint I add a couple of heaping tablespoons of vanilla flavored protein powder for the flavor twist and the extra nutrition it bestows.

Sunshine Juice - what a great name.  The sound of title brings happiness to my morning.  I don't have a juicer, so I put everything in my Magic Bullet (R) to blend.  I started with the oranges so that they would create the juice needed for the other ingredients.  Added red raspberries and frozen banana.  A delicious breakfast smoothie that contains a day's worth of fruit.

I have a juicer, but put this in a blender instead. 1) Bananas don't juice, and 2) raspberries get mostly shot into the disposal container on mine... Anyway, I had thought I had raspberries, but didn't so I used strawberries instead.  Very good drink! I basically had it for lunch. The second time I made it (the next day!) I added a container of Greek strawberry yougurt too. Oh, and I had some pineapple juice on hand, so I used that to get the blender going instead of water or milk.

Wonderful and refreshing! I added an additional approx. cup of chopped ice and water mix to smooth it out more. I also used frozen banana and berries (that's how I store them for smoothies). Love the fact too that I am getting my daily required serving of fruit and good nutrition from this wholesome blend.

First, I need to make a distinction between smoothies and juice. 
When you 'juice', you get a very rapid and easily digestible 'shot' of vitamins and minerals more quickly into your system because the fiber in fruit and veggies doesn't have to be digested (which takes much longer to travel through your system and get into your bloodstream.) That said, whether juicing or making a smoothie this is an excellent recipe but experiment with any and all fruits and veggies. Try 'juicing' kale, apples and a lemon for a super energy boost.

I make a version of this and the ingredients vary according to what fruits I have available.  I mix crushed ice, orange juice, plain yogurt, whatever fruits I have available (could be one or several types), frozen banana and vanilla.  Blend all in blender.
Tip:  If the taste is more tart that I want, I add 5-10 grapes to sweeten vs sugar.
Great starter in the morning or anytime during the day.

Great recipe! The only tip I can give you guys is you dont want to juice the banana as it doesn't actually have any juice in it you would want to juice everything except the banana and then put the juice in blender with the banana and then serve. Maybe that's why some of you didn't get the right color when making it. Other than that its awesome. Cheers

Sunshine Juice is now my NEW favorite beverage... with just a few minor adaptions... 

1 small ice cream scoop (3 Tbsp) OJ concentrate, 1 cup frozen raspberries, 1 ripe banana, 1 cup water added to a blender. (WISH I had some mint, which IS opt.). Blend until smooth to make 2 cups beautiful RICH pink bliss.

Loved it!!!

I am not sure why mine didn't look like the picture? It looked like the color of rasberries. I always put leftover fruit in the freezer and noticed this recipe called to put the drink over ice. So, I put the fruit out to defrost some. It was icy but not frozen when I tried it this morning. However, as I suspected my blender would not budge, without any liquid, so I added 1/4 cup of orange juice since it was in the recipe already. It mainly tasted like a raspberry smoothie. Although, I didn't care for were the raspberry seeds coming through my straw and I thought the mint was a little strong. Interesting drink though, as I have never put herbs in a smoothie.

No need for a juice machine!!  I have been making these since college when fruits and vegetables were all I could afford.  Throw everything into the blender, it works great.  :-)

I added coconut milk and a handful of ice cubes to skip the juicing! It was good, but I'll need to find a more specific measurements to make this good base into the perfect smoothie.

Excellent smoothie! Love the extra boost the fresh mint lends to it. Every thing goes into the blender, including ice; If I have walnuts on hand, I'll throw in 2 tablespoons to the mix before blending in my V-mix machine. Nic, y'all have it "going on" across the pond - thanks for a great recipe!

Maybe I like smoothies that are sweeter or maybe I just don’t like oranges that much but this wasn’t stand out to me.

I made it in my Hurom juicer, and it was delicious! I doubled the recipe as I found that it only made a little bit over one cup of juice. I also froze it into popsicles and into little cups. The frozen ones in the cup I smashed up after it froze overnight to make a delicious slush!! So delightful! Especially for the hot Cali summers ??????

Since you can't juice bananas, I threw everything into my blender. It's really good, but too thick for my tastes. I would suggest adding some kind of liquid to this. Otherwise, it was pretty good
