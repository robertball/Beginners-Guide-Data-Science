This is almost my mothers stuffing recipe. Not hard to make and always a big hit. Being this simple you can make it year round as I do. Mom's has chopped celery in it and you saute the celery and onion in about 1/4 to 1/2 lb. of butter or margarine. Don't use the water, use all the melted butter for moisture. Add one peeled chopped apple for an interesting Thanksgiving flavor and a little more moisture. The secret to this recipe or my variations is the poultry seasoning though. It's mostly sage but the real thing isn't hard to find. True Katie, can be made with soft or dried bread cubes. I've made it both ways. Add more water (or butter) for dried cubes but I still like the soft bread the best.

I have been meaning to write a review for this for a couple of years...it's a *great* recipe! I love to cook, so if something is good, it's good.  I use Goya Adobo for the seasoning, and also sauteed the onions in butter before adding it to the bread.  I make it everytime I have a holiday, and even during the year.  There has never been a bit left, and I have made it at least a dozen times already.  Thanks!

This is a good base for easy stuffing. I made the following changes and the stuffing came out great! I used one onion, 2 celery stalks & 8 oz. mushrooms sauteed in 1 stick of butter. One chopped, peeled apple and 1 cup chicken broth. 1 tsp. poultry seasoning. Baked covered @ 350 for one hour. Very tasty!

VERY good stuffing and the fact that its sooo easy to make gets an A+ from me!! I took "JUSTCYN's" advice and sauted the onion and some celery in butter and used that primarily for the moisture.  However, since I was using dried/stale bread, I also used 1/4c chicken broth. Cooked in covered foil and it turned out good! Great recipe Katie!

This was quite bland for our taste.  I do think by adding a little ground Savory and using chicken broth in place of just water would add a lot to this recipe.

This stuffing didn't live 5 minutes in our family of 3! I made it to go with a pork roast. I followed suggestions and sauteed celery and onion in 1/4 c. butter and tossed that with the bread to moisten, instead of water. I also added an entire apple, peeled, cored and sliced. I baked it in a casserole dish for an hour and it was a perfect complement to the pork. Thanks!

I found this quite good.  I used brown bread, and sauteed onion and celery in butter as the previous poster suggested.  I also eliminated the water and added a chopped apple.  I used soft bread but put it all together the day before and left the cover slightly loose on the bowl in the fridge overnight.  Stuffed it in the turkey the next morning.

Very easy and very good!  Will definitely make again.

Our kitchen isn't very "cooking-friendly" but I tried this anyway because I missed my grandmom's stuffing after moving to London. It is SO close to hers I just had to say THANK YOU for this! It's a taste of home  that I can aquire MANY miles away! And I haven't even tried it with the celery suggestion yet!

This is close to mine . I saute my onions , use fresh bread & lots of sage (no celery ,one child won't touch it!)definately (warm) broth instead of water AND I use 2 eggs for the first loaf ,& add 1 egg/each additional loaf of bread . I use lots of broth & cover the pan til nearly done since my family prefers a very moist dressing . This year for the first time in 30 yrs. I plan to change it by adding chopped apple ...as long as no one tells them , lol !

This was good, but a bit dry.  I cooked at 350 in a casserole dish, covered for an hour.  I followed the suggestion to add sauted onions and celery and use the butter for moisture.  Next time I will add 1/3 c water as well.

I was really nervous about making stuffing from scratch...I was convinced I would somehow mess it up and ruin my first thanksgiving meal.  Luckily I found this recipe and it turned out amazing!  Next year I'll try adding some fun stuff for some variation but it's great as is.

This is a good basic and versatile recipe. I added sliced mushrooms, and some very finely chopped walnuts and celery. If I were to make it again, I would probably use chicken broth instead of water for extra flavor. Thanks, Katie! And a belated Merry Christmas to the Allrecipes crew!

This recipe is basic.  Some other posters were using water for more liquid.  However, chicken broth (or turkey) gives a much better flavor.  I used more poultry seasoning, too.  Adjust spices to fit your tasts.  Happy Thanksgiving!

I give 4 stars since I had to deviate from the original recipe...did saute the onion and celery with 1/2 cup of margarine, using the margarine for the moistness instead of water. Also, I poured about 1/4 cup of chicken broth over the whole thing prior to baking. It was even wonderful without baking! Will definitely make again!

By the time I was done with this recipe there wasn't one ingredient I didn't change.

I used dinner rolls instead of bread for a sweeter flavour.  Sauteed onions and garlic in a good amount of butter.  Dropped the water altogether.  Added chopped frozen cranberries.  Spices...sage, celery salt, a bit of cinnamon, a bit of curry powder, dash of rosemary, tiny amount of bay leaves.

The result is a sweeter than spicy combination but with a touch of both.  

At the very least, I say use the butter instead of the water and cook the onions.

This is a good base recipe that can be made into whatever you please.  I used chicken broth instead of water, added some celery and garlic, and used pumpernickle bread with white bread.  It turned out really well with the changes, but I think it would have been a little bland without them.

This was very simple to make and quite good.  Since I don't like onions, I didn't add them, but I still added about a stick of melted butter and some chicken broth for moisture instead of water.  I served it with beef cubes and gravy.

Delicious!  Like every one else I pumped up the calories by browning onions and celery in butter and using chicken broth.

This was my mother's recipe, with the addition of celery sauted in butter along with the onion. I have used this recipe myself for 30 years. I also add dry chicken broth powder, such as Orrington Farms,  to mine for more flavor. You must make sure to use enough water. I usually add some liquid chicken broth as well. And I only use fresh bakery bread from the supermarket. For Thanksgiving dinner, I always stuff the turkey, and put the rest of the stuffing in a crockpot. I just add a little more liquid because it will not have the juices from the turkey for moisture. My family loves, loves, loves my dressing!

Very good stuffing.  I wrapped it in foil and baked it in the oven for a vegetarian option.  Be sure to tear up the bread into "small" pieces and lightly grease any foil/pan (it will stick).  Next time I think I'll use vegetable stock instead of water.

This didn't turn out very well for me. Maybe it was because I used a loaf of baguette for the bread. I'm not sure, but it just didn't taste like much and the bread was not moist enough.

I tried this out and I was kind of disappointed.  I did as other reviewers suggested and I sauteed onions and celery in butter then used that to moisten the bread.  It was too buttery for my taste and my boyfriend didn't like it either.  It may actually be better with just the water.  It did look pretty though, and I submitted a picture because there wasn't one up there yet.

This just didn't do it for me.  It was very dry even with extra broth.  Not sure what I did wrong.  I'll stick to stove top until I find the perfect recipe.

This was way too plain for me, so I added celery, onions and an apple...Still came out a little bland.  I guess Ill have to keep adding things until I like it.

i found a recipe just like this once, only it called for forming the stuffing into round balls and frying them in a pan instead of baking - some cooked bacon might be good to add

I have tried this and it was too bland so I used half a bag of Stouffer herb cubed bread and a half of a loaf of bread. I sauté the onion and celery in butter to soften. Instead of using water I heat up chicken broth and add it until the stuffing is softened. I also use salt, pepper, and ground sage. I do stuff my bird and it comes out great.

This is very similar to the recipe my mother taught me growing up.  The differences are in sauteing the onion in butter, using dried bread cubes (either prepared or home made), using broth rather than water, and probably a significantly greater amount of pepper. I like to add a small amount of craisons to it as well. You really can't go wrong with this one. It's readily adaptable to whatever changes you want to add, and it tastes great with the meal.

This is the best way to make stuffing ever! I just added 1 tsp of sage to this recipe and my family absolutely LOVES it!! This is the recipe we use for every occasion that requires stuffing! I get heartburn easily so this recipe has very little sage and it's not too harsh on my esophagus ?? 5 Stars!

My mom has made this for as long as i can remember. I cook it in the Turkey and allow it to cook in the turkey juices. She/we use milk and an egg instead of water also.

I have made this stuffing for over 45 years and we love it except I add fresh celery and some butter or margarine whatever I have on hand so it isn't dry, sometimes I use chicken broth if I have it I stuff my turkey or chicken with it plus I make pans full on the side once nice and brown you can either cover it so it doesn't get hard or cover it first than brown at the end you can also bake pork chops in oven with this stuffing on top or if thick enough chops put inside

Definitely white bread is best not hard but definitely a few days old. The only addition I would make is to add about 4 beef or pork sausages - casings removed and chopped up small this ensures moisture is retained and definitely do not add celery or apples.  This is definitely a very very old recipe - I am 75 and my mom made this every year of her life and the recipe was passed to her from her mom - believe it came from Scotland.  Salt, pepper, onion and sage are the only spices - absolutely delicious in or out of the turkey.

Very Bland....why would you use water when broth adds so much flavor...my version is very simple and fast and everyone asks for the recipe. To start off I always add chopped celery and onion all around my Turkey in the roasting pan before roasting. This adds wonderful flavor to the broth the turkey makes. So I break up plain white bread in a big bowl sprinkling in sage, salt & pepper alternately while  tossing with my hands. This can be made ahead of time and set aside ready to add your turkey broth with the celery and onions. I'm not one for measuring so I just pour and mix a little at a time until it is as moist or as dry as you like it. Then pour into a buttered baking dish and cover with aluminum foil for about 30 to 35 mins. (it will puff up under the foil). Then remove foil and brown to your liking. For an easy dressing when you're not having turkey just add sautéed onion & celery to canned or boxed chicken broth. note: I always add hot broth to the torn up bread.

I sauteed onions, mushrooms and celery in a half stick of butter. I also used dried homemade bread cubes, so added a cup of chicken stock. Easy and VERY tasty.

A good "basic" stuffing recipe.  I use 1/2 white bread and 1/2 cornbread and moisten with chicken broth rather than water. I also add a couple stalks of chopped celery and toss in a minced hard-boiled egg or two.  Since I love sage stuffing, I toss in 1/4 tsp. sage and double the amount of poultry seasoning.

This is my basic recipe for stuffing that my mother-in-law gave me years ago,  I have modified it some over the many times I made it and it just gets better every time.  I sauté the onion and 1 clove of minced garlic in 1/2 stick of butter until soft and mix into the dry bread to moisten - I also use low sodium chicken broth instead of water.  Season it up to your taste.

Really quick, easy, and tasty stuffing!  Also very versatile!  You can really add anything you want to it.  I sauteed the onions in butter, and added celery and some green apple.  I used poultry seasoning, lots of dry sage leaves, along with some fresh thyme and parsley, a little rosemary, and a pinch of nutmeg to season it.  I also added some dried cranberries to the mix, and moistened it all with chicken stock instead of water.  Came out fabulous!  It's a keeper!
