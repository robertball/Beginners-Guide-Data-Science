A small tip - after chilling for 2 hrs this is very hard to get out of the pan. Put a couple of inches of hot water in your sink and let the pan sit in it for 15 minutes. You can then flip it over and it will pop right out.

Awesome fudge.  I use one bag of milk chocolate chips and add 1/2 bag of semi-sweet also.  This leaves a very nice creamy texture.  Here's a little tip that everyone loves.  Freeze the remaining 1/2 bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips.  At the end of stirring, pour in the frozen chocolate chips, give the mix one good, quick, final stir, pour into pan and refrigerate.  (I like it cold!)  The mixture is hot enough to melt part, but not all, of the frozen chips.  It will leave tiny chocolate chunks throughout.  Want another tip?  After preparing as I did above, add one cup of peanut butter to this recipe before the final stirring and refrigerate.  Mmmm!!  (If adding the frozen chocolate chips, always add them last to prevent them from melting totally.)  Having trouble getting it out of the pan?  Line the pan with foil.  After it sets, simply lift it out, remove the foil, and place the fudge on a dish or cutting surface to cut.

This recipe is wonderful.... I have made it for years..  A wonderful way to present this as a gift is to place the empty can wrapped in plastic wrap in the middle of a glass pie dish, then pour the fudge around it.  When it sets it makes a wonderful wreath that you can adorn even more.

Excellent recipe..  I got a little creatived and used white choclate in stead of dark and Mint extract instead of vanilla then added 3 drops of green food coloring.  My family thinks it the best think since Andie's mints. I'm sure this will become a new Christmas tradition on my party table. Jeanette

I tried this recipe, thought it was a little too chocolatey for my taste. Took the advice of a reviewer, used 2 cups semi and 1 cup milk choc. PERFECT! I ended up making 5 batches for gifts. Everyone loved it! So easy and good! Thank you.

This is a great recipe! It makes a good, quick, inexpensive gift for teachers, neighbors, etc. It is also something nice to bring to parties or set out when unexpected guests drop by. I make it in lots of different varieties, from butterscotch to white chocolate, and I mix in all kinds of things to make it more interesting. My family's favorite varieties are peanuts & raisins, peanuts & marshmallows, oreos & white chocolate and white chocolate & crushed peppermint. Mix in the candies at the end and then refrigerate.
One more thing. Rachel Ray was on Oprah recently and she made a recipe like this one but she made it in the shape of a wreath. I tried it that way (used a jello mold) and it came out fabulous! It was my gift to each of my neighbors.

This fudge was so easy to make and everyone in my family loves it. I have tried several variations such crushed mint oreos, heath toffee chips and nuts, as well white chocolate chips with macadamian nuts. I would reccommend this recipes it you want something fast that works every time.

I have made this fudge for many years for my family. They love it! I use the microwave to make it easier. The variation with the milk chocolate is great too.

Great fudge recipe.  I remember making this with my mom for the 17 years I lived at home! (well, I remember about 12 of those :)  
Today I'm making it with one strange variation.  Chunky peanut butter in the place of the nuts (because I have some peanut butter that doesn't close properly, and ants keep getting attracted to it--  but that's another story)
I'll update with the results.

Results:  Well, it came out really delish!  I tried to fold in the peanut butter, so that there were swirls in it.  It sort of worked...  but since the fudge mixture was warm, it sort of melted the peanut butter.
This set wonderfully, and is now waiting to be consumed in the freezer.
We always freeze our fudge, and then make plates along with "Russian Teacakes" for a Christmas treat for neighbors and friends.  YUM.
(Russian Tea Cakes "I" SUBMITTED BY: Odette)  Try 'em.  Make 'em SMALLLLLLL tho.

really good and easy to make. But the flavor was a little boring. It was nothing that wowed me....just more of a "good enough" type of recipe. Soft and chewy; it set just right, but the flavor just needs something else.

Sets up nicely, very easy with great texture, however, this fudge tasted like chocolate chips and nothing more. It definitely has potential, I might try it again with better chocolate....

This is an easy quick fudge recipe that will never turn out grainy.  I have found that I get an overly thick mess if I use 3 cups chocolate chips, as another reviewer found.  I use 2 or 2 1/2 cups of chips instead, and it works out much better.  I also microwave the sweetened condenced milk in the microwave before adding the chips, then pour them in and stir until melted.

This is the recipe for fudge my mom made and we've loved through the years.  I add 1 cup milk chocolate chips and 1 T of corn syrup to make a smoother taste and texture.  I like to make half a batch just with nuts and half a batch with rum-soaked raisins and nuts.  
Two tips: 
1.  I line a glass container with aluminum foil will extra foil on the edges to help lift the fudge out.
2.  When the fudge is lightly set I take a pizza cutter and cut my pieces then let it set fully.  When I'm ready to serve it, it is already evenly scored and it comes apart neatly.
This is a wonderful, not too sweet, fudge to make with children, too.

This is the easiest fudge in the world, and has a nice creamy texture.   I made it last week and added Heath Bar toffee pieces to it.  Everyone absolutely loved it!

Easy and fast with a nice smooth consistancy. I added mini marshmallows and chopped walnuts and this helped to boost the flavor and interest. Great substitution for real fudge if you don't have the time or are short on ingredients and need a quick candy. This is definately not like the old fashioned fudge recipes and I probably wouldn't serve it on my holiday platters or give it as a gift but the kids really enjoyed it and asked to take some home. They had fun helping make this and I would do it again with them and try different add-ins and flavors.

Perhaps nobody who made this actually knows what REAL fudge is supposed to taste like.  Because this fudge tastes like melted chocolate chips.  It LOOKS like fudge, and has a nice texture, but is disappointing when you go to eat it.  Now I know why people said they give it as a gift - it's quick to make, cheap and they don't actually have to eat it themselves!

Best fudge ever.  I've done the 'fantasy fudge' on the back of the Marshmallow Creme recipe forever and ever.  Never really loved the grainy texture, the sticky knuckles of trying to get the marshmallow out of the jar, stirring for long periods over a hot stove waiting for the right temperature, only to have it sometimes not set up or set way too hard.

Not this recipe.  Super easy, prepares fast, sets up fast, no question as to whether it will set properly, and it is SO SMOOTH.  Versatile too, as you can add any nuts, or even 1/2 a cup of PB for chocolate/pb fudge.

You just can't go wrong here! I tried making this recipe and Alton Brown's recipe to compare. My husband was convinced Brown's recipe would be superior. I have to say he was wrong. This is nice, firm fudge. Not too sweet and perfect with chopped walnuts. Stick with a good thing. This recipe is a winner!

Not quite cooked fudge taste and texture, but a smooth and quite tasty chocolate fudge. My experience: the salt is essential--I forgot it once and it makes a big difference. Stirring in the vanilla after removing the fudge from the heat kept the flavor brighter. I used 12 oz. semi-sweet chips and 6 oz. Ghiradelli bittersweet chocolate chips for a dark chocolate fudge flavor. (You can also add a square of unsweetened chocolate to the 18 oz semisweet chips for a similar taste.) I put the fudge in cookie cutters to give little gifts to my nieces and nephews. I wrapped the back on the cookie cutter with nonstick foil, and filled it with fudge. After chilling, I wrapped them in clear plastic tied with a bow, still in the cutter. The kids loved them! Great recipe!

This recipe came out exactly right.  I made a little change to this recipe by swapping out half of the semi-sweet chocolate chips with butterscotch chips.  The outcome was delicious! It gave the fudge a lot more flavor.  I also recommend swapping out half of the semi-sweet chocolate chips with peanut butter chips.  These add a lot of flavor and are a different kind of fudge.  I will definitely be making this fudge again.

A hit with our family of chocolate lovers! We used Belgian chocolate truffles (bought at Costco) instead which came out great! The better the quality of chocolate (i.e. Swiss, Belgian...), the better the final results. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was really easy to make.  I followed the recipe to the letter. I made a double batch as I am giving this away for Christmas presents.  I omitted the walnuts and crushed up some almond roca's to sprinkle on top before I put it into the fridge to cool.

Just make sure to keep heat on low and stir the whole time.  Don't be tempted to do other things whilst the chocolate is melting.

It doesn't get any easier than this. Two minutes in the microwave, some stirring, and i put it in my toaster oven tray, lined with plastic wrap and sprayed with cooking spray and chilled.

This "fudge" was really just like eating softened chic chips. And really since that was pretty much the recipe, I'm not surprised. It was very easy, and if you just want a choc treat, it tasted fine, but it just wasn't fudge.

Not a usual fudge but it was really good. I like it better than fudge with Marshmallow creme actually.. it was almost like a caramel. Tasted really good, and is a good recipe.

I'm not happy right now. I just got done making this "foolproof" fudge and well, I guess it met its maker. I followed the instructions and ended up with a thick gunk of chocolate fudge. It's chilling now but I had to use my hands to spread it within the pan. There was nothing about this recipe that was smooth and creamy. We'll see how it tastes after it has chilled. I was making this fudge (among other baked goods) for Christmas presents for mine and my husbands co-workers. Fingers crossed...

Just made these and loved them. I am a dark chocolate lover so I used Gharadelli Dark Chocolate Chips.  I used chopped pecans and melted the chips and milk in a pyrex in the microwave, worked wonderfully.  I sprinkled a few crushed peppermint pieces on top after spreading it into the dish for a lovely mint touch (good for Christmas).  I also lined my dish with foil, leaving some hanging over the edge and sprayed it lightly with oil. It was a snap to lift from the dish, put on a cutting board and cut into any size piece desired!

The silkiest, yummiest fudge ever.  Followed recipe and melted it in the microwave. To keep it from sticking just butter the dish before filling with fudge. I will add some peanut butter next time to half of it.  My mom always made it with peanut butter.

I've made this before, but had lost my recipe and forgot about it.  I chilled these in silicone baking cups and they popped right out - no wax paper required.  I poured out half the recipe to have no nuts and then stirred nuts into the remaining fudge before pouring out into the cups.  I find this rather rich, but everyone always gobbles this up.

I'm afraid I'm in the "tastes like melted chocolate chips" group.  I'm used to real candy shop fudge so this was a bit of a disappointment.  I'm sure the kids will like it so it's not a total waste but I don't think I'll make it again.

It is simple to make and does taste good, but not excellent.  I made the dark chocolate version that uses marshmallows and it was good, but not the best.  I also tried a batch with Andes mints melted in...I don't recommend that because it surprisingly did not taste good.  
I may try to make this fudge again, but will just try the regular version without marshmallows.

I tried it with the semi-sweet and marshmallows and it turned out very strong...too rich for me. It did harden like fudge though, I'll give it that.

While this is not the traditional fudge, it is a very good candy none the less.  Not overly sweet, but very creamy and smooth.  I did not add nuts as my family prefers candy without nuts.  And, I used 2 cups of milk chocolate and one cup of semi-sweet morsels since that was all I had on hand.  Very easy to prepare and it set up nicely.

I've made this fudge every Christmas for years. You can use just about any type of chip too. I've made it using peanutbutter chips, butterscotch and white chips. The white chips have to be very fresh or they seize up when trying to melt them. I've also done combo fudge with chocolate on the bottom and peanutbutter on the top. My niece LOVEs that one and requests it ever year. Too boot this fudge is creamy not sugar gritty like the stove top recipes. Love this one!

Super easy to make. You don't have to stand there stirring until it reaches a certain temp. Just blend until melted and smooth.
I add 1 & 1/2 teaspoon of Orange Extract instead of Vanilla. It gives a slight orange taste.
Yummy.

This turned out great! This is exactly what I wanted my fudge to taste like.  I have always been afraid to try and make fudge but you literally cannot mess this up! Going to try a peanut butter variation soon using peanut butter chips.

Tate's yummy!  So good.  Only thing is that next time I will try milk chocolate Chips because semi-sweet is a little overpowering.  Really is FoolProof.  Very close to chocolate fudge you would buy.  Love it.  MUST TRY!

My father-in-law made this same recipe for over 50 years.  He called it "Rum Fudge" and added a jigger of Dark Rum in place of the vanilla extract.  It smells and tastes wonderful.  I don't even like any liquor but I do like his Rum Fudge.  He is gone now but, we are still making it this way.  To make it easier to cut, if you put foil in you pan that extends out and after it is somewhat set, pull out of pan,  put on a cookie sheet, make your cuts and put back in frig.  When it is totally set, re-cut in the marks from the first cutting.

This fudge was delicious. The reviews I got from coworkers and my partner were that the fudge was not overly sweet like some fudge and they wanted the recipe. It is an easy recipe to share because it is so simple!

My daughter made this fudge for the Holidays, and it is, by far, the creamiest fudge I've tasted (with and without nuts.)  It is truly a keeper.  I have added it to my recipe collection.

The second time I made this recipe, I made two batches. I used a 9x13" pan.  I used dark chocolate, ghirardelli 60% choc. chips for the first batch. I spread it on the bottom of the pan.  Then, I made a batch with ghirardelli milk chocolate chips,and spread it on top of the dark.  The two types of chocolate, layered like that, with the contrasting flavors of dark and milk chocolate in each bite  is tantalizing to the taste buds! My family and neighbors love it! I do have some problems with the dark choc. mixture becoming grainy.  Will try 16oz. instead of 18 next time.  The milk choc has been perfect each time.
Suggestions on why this is happening are most welcome!

I had a big bag of chocolate left over from Christmas that wasn't the nicest chocolate for eating. So I found this recipe and made fudge and everyone thought it was delicious ! What a find - I will use this again and again ! I also mixed dark, milk & white chocolate and added marshmallows. Perfect !

I admit i only put in hlaf the vanilla so take this review or leave it. but this fudge was extremely bitter. I thought it was just me but other people said the same time. it tasted like eating a handful of chocolate chips. it's that's how you like it this recipe is perfect. . . but it just wasn't my thing.

this was goooood! Cuz of SEMI-sweet chocolate chips? it wasn't too sweet like other fudges you can buy them from the store. I used parchment paper in the pan & left it in fridge for over night. No problem of taking fudge out from the pan. It got very hard, though, to cut, and i had to leave the fudge outside (50F room temp.) for a couple of hours before being able to cut them nice. I wonder, though, IF i cut them after 2 hrs, and then, refrigerate in a air tight container, it might be easier to cut them nice...i just didn't want to make cracks but rather having perfect squares. i'll try that next time, and with miniture marshmallows. I made with walnuts for my bf's father's 60th birthday party and everybody loved it cuz it wasn't TOO Sweet, but just right :-) I'll make these again, for gift giving in holidays :-)

My husband and I liked the fudge, but it never got firm. I even set the pan in the freezer overnight and it didn't firm up. Great recipe just doesn't get hard. Perfect to eat with a spoon.

Perfect fudge recipe. I went a little crazy and divided my batch up and then added 1/2 tsp. orange extract to one batch instead of vanilla. And then in the rest I did add the vanilla but also added chopped salted almonds to one portion, chopped Snickers bar to another portion, chopped SKOR bar to another portion, and finally chopped Twix bar to another. Each turned out amazing! I still have not decided which I like the best!

Really and truly foolproof--my mom and I have made it for years as part of our holiday cookie plates.  One trick we use is to put pecan halves on top of the warm fudge (one per square) so that those who don't care for nuts can just pop them off.  Once there are nuts mixed in, there's no turning back!

If you want straight edges on all your pieces, trim the four sides before cutting your squares.  Then, you have a built-in excuse to eat the "scraps"! :-)

Get your fudge fix fast. I did mix half milk and half semi-sweet chocolate chips.  This fudge lends itself to lots of additions, marshmallows & craisins or baileys irish creme etc.

I actually do this in the microwave in a glass bowl. I make two batches at a time. Heat for 3 mins. Take it out and stir. Heat for another 3 mins. Add nuts and vanilla. Stir again and done.I make this every year. Everyone looks forward to it every Christmas. To get the fudge out of the pan easily, line the pans with plastic wrap. After it cools you can just lift it out by the overlapping edges of the film.

It wasn't like real fudge- you can definitely tell it's a shortcut- like others, I thought it tasted like semi-sweet chips.  It might be better if you use milk chocolate chips.  I tried it with butterscotch and also white chocolate chips, but it never set up enough to cut into firm squares with those.  We ate a few pieces and ended up throwing it out.  Too bad, because I was going to give it as gifts.

Good base recipe. This is much better than the evaporated milk and mini marshmallow recipe. This is a nice firm consistency when cooled. I like to make mine using 2 cups of the dark chocolate chips and 1 cup of the semi sweet and after it is melted and ready to put in the pan I stir in the small 5 oz. bag of dried Montmorency cherries from Target (archer Farms) then pour into the pan. Wow!! It is so good!!

I made this fudge yesterday.
I've never ever made fudge before; and it was super easy.
It tastes divine!!!!
I added extra sea-salt on the top after I had spread it into the pan.
It's very yummy!!!
10/10!!

If you are looking for a fast and easy fudge recipe, you could try this. It’s not too sweet and is incredibly fast and easy. However, it is not the same quality as “real” fudge. I guess there are no shortcuts to good fudge, and I’ll need to utilize my candy thermometer.  Ah well…

My Boyfriend and I wanted to make fudge, we found this recipe and tried it; it was yummy!  We crushed up candy canes and folded into the fudge, we are now going to make and hand out at Christmas.  Thank you for the great recipe, also used the tip of wax paper which allowed us to easily take the fudge out and cut it.

This was good! I was a little dissapointed though.  :( I had to use milk chocolate chocolate chips, and super semi sweet chocolate chips and choco powder. But it also was my first time making fudge! It turned out pretty good!

This is very good, however I dont think I am a fan of semi-sweet chocolate. Taste a little bitter to me.  So I think this would get a 5 star from me if it was milk chocolate. I will deffinately try it again with the milk chocolate chips and see how it is.

Great and easy recipe.  I did one batch with half semi sweet and half milk chocolate.  And for me (I don't like chocolate) I did white chips with green food coloring and mint extract instead of vanilla.  Turned out delicious.  I lined the square pan with parchment paper and they came out great!

Easy and delicious!  I added some marshmallows (and took out the nuts) and they didn't melt quite right, but still came out excellent.  I think you could get really creative with this simple recipe :)

Excellent!  Easy.  I didn't have any trouble getting it out of the pan.  I sprayed the wax paper with pam.  It came out perfectly in about an hour and 1/2.  Next time I will try with milk chocolate chips, white chocolate or peanut butter chips.

A good solid fudge recipe. I agree with the use of milk chocolate (halving the semi-sweets with milk chocolate gives a better flavor). I found the mixture a little too lumpy and added 2 tbsp of milk before putting it in the pan and it smoothed out beautifully. I also crushed peppermint candies and gently pressed into the fudge as a topping. It turned out great!

To me it tastes more like creamy chocolate chips and I like a little more depth to my fudge.  To fill a chocolate craving in a hurry it would be fine.

I have used this recipe for years and it's never failed me. I don't add the vanilla or salt, though.  I do add a bag of reese's peanut butter chips for peanut butter chocolate fudge (gently fold in the peanut butter chips). This is especially good if you don't like the typical sweet fudge. *I also line the pan with tin foil instead of wax paper, works great.

I used a mocha, salted caramel version. 2 c. semi-sweet chips melted with 1 c milk chocolate chips along with the can of sweetened cond. milk and 1 t vanilla, 1 t instant espresso powder dissolved in 2 T half and half. Melt stir till smooth and pour in 8" foil lined pan. Meanwhile, melt 1 c caramel bits with 1 T half and half. Pour over fudge in pan and swirl with a knife. Sprinkle with a bit of coarse sea salt. Just gilded the lily a little :)

As good as ever!  I've made this recipe a few times.  I used marshmallows this time.  Although this recipe won't get you a gourmet-style fudge, it's still an excellent beginner recipe.

This is simple, almost foolproof and it be altered into so many different tastes - just use your imagination.  I almost always reduce the chips to two cups.  Most of the time I use a mixture of 1/2 semi sweet and 1/2 milk chocolate chips.  I vary the additions (extracts, spices, fruit nuts, cereals) whatever occurs to me at the time.  I have used white chips with lemon, orange or maple extract.  Pour it into a bigger pan and top with batch chocolate fudge. YUM!   Yep, you are only limited by your imagination.  Personally I think this so much better than the popular Fantasy Fudge made with marshmallow crème and cocoa.

Sooo easy, and way too tasty to leave lying around.  I divided the batch in two, and mixed half with chopped nut, and the other half with chopped up plain cookies (biscuits in England).

I omitted the nuts in this. I used 1/2 white chocolate chips and half semi-sweet. The fudge was really good, but the semi-sweet chocolate clumped and turned solid.

I have never made fudge before, and this was beyond simple. I used 2 tsp Vanilla, following the recipe on my can of condensed milk, but the recipe was otherwise exact. Next time I will try one cup milk chocolate as other's have suggested, just to try the difference, but I thought this recipe was great as is. Soft, shiny, perfect textured fudge that tastes like it took a lot longer to make. I will make again for my work's bake sale fundraiser this month.

So easy! I used Jeanette's idea and did mint w/ white chocolate chips & green food coloring and put another batch made with dark chocolate chps on top, it looked like a well-known brand of mint. I'm going to make it again tonight and roll into little balls, then coat w/ dark chocolate for after dinner mints/treats on thanksgiving. Yumm!

Good easy fudge.  Add white or peanut butter chips for some variety.  Use fat free eagle brand to tone down the sweetness.

This is a fantastic recipe. So easy and delicious. Hard to get out of pan after it fully sets, so wait an hour or so and loosen it up a bit and place back in fridge.

I've made this with the vanilla and have switched out the vanilla for Irish Cream.  Always turns out great.  Never have added the nuts just because of personal taste.

This recipe is very easy and delicious! I made the milk chocolate version with chopped walnuts and used closer to 1c. plus topped the fudge with nuts. When topping the fudge, be sure to push your choice of topping into the fudge otherwise it falls off. I also used other reviewers' tips to get the fudge out of the pan. I'm looking forward to trying variations with toffee bits and crushed oreos!

After reading all the reviews for this, I decided to try it out. I used half milk chocolate and half semi sweet as some others suggested. I was a little disappointed with the final product. While it tastes very good. It does not taste like fudge to me. To me it was just really yummy chocolate. But my kids loved helping to make it, and my mom thought it was great. So, while I will continue looking for that perfect fudge recipe, I will be making this again when the kids want to make desert.

Absolutely brilliant! This was super easy to make, looked amazing and was superbly delicious! Everyone was amazed that it was homemade because everyone swore it was the best fudge they had ever had. It only took minutes to make and had practically no clean up. Bravo! I am a big fan of this recipe and will use it forever. Great recipe!

Very good and easy to make fudge. We made the milk choc/semi-sweet choc. variation w/o nuts for the first run. Now we're going to try other combinations. We refrigerated it over night and it was very hard to remove from the pan. Will try putting the pan in hot water as another reviewer suggested... thanks for the tip!

Sooo good. I made it into rocky road fudge by adding marshmallows and almonds on top and bottom of the fudge, was told it was "the best fudge ever." I'll make it again and again! never will I attempt the dreaded evil Fantasy Fudge recipe.

This was the first time that I ever made fudge and it was Amazing! I added 2 Tbls of butter like someone suggested and stirred it really well until nice and smooth. I added walnuts and took it to work and everyone absolutely Loved it! Thank you for this easy foolproof recipe. This will be my new tradition for years to come!

I had some pecans soaked in Kentucky Bourbon that I used in my fudge. Wow! It was fabulous and so much easier than making Bourbon balls. Think this is going to be a holiday tradition. I did add a little Bourbon to the chocolate. We don’t have any children around so it was okay.

I learned to make fudge using the semi sweet bars, sugar, milk, corn syrup... And beating it until t lost or maybe gained glossiness. This is just as good, simpler, and far more versatile. My adult children look forward to the many variations we have devised.  Try drained and chopped maraschino cherries mixed in, or add instant coffee, almond extract, cherry extract, mix in pnut butter early for pnutbutter fudge.

Quick .. Easy ... and Delicious!   I microwaved the chocolate chips and sweetened condensed milk together at 30 second intervals, stirring after each interval until  it was all melted together.  Stirred in vanilla, walnuts and a large handful of marshmallows.  I lined my 8 inch pan with parchment  paper .. (foil can be used as well) for easy removal.

when mixing and melting it came out kinda dry (not from over cooking chocolate ) so i added about a 1/4 cup of heavy cream and that brought it to a nice consistency i also used mint chocolate chips by hershey's.

My family has been wanting fudge since I was unable to make it at Christmas. I looked up easy quick fudge and came across this recipe on my favorite recipe go to All Recipes.
It was easy , quick and I did a tweak to it. I used marshmallow fluff , both semi sweet and white chocolate chips. I added walnut halves to a third of the pan and put flakes of  Himalayan  salt lightly all over.
It came out savory and delicious. Definitely making it for gifts this Christmas!!

There are a few suggestions I would recommend. I would melt the chocolate before adding the milk.  I would use all milk chocolate for a more fudgy flavor and line the pan with wax paper or parchment paper.

Using name brand ingredients (Ghirardelli & Eagle Brand) this recipe turned out to be easy, foolproof, rich and delicious. After cutting in bite sized pieces, i kept it in the freezer to extend its use. Out in the counter, it’s too tempting.

This is a quick fudge.  It taste like a bag of semi sweet chocolate morsels.  Just open a bag and eat them.  It might taste completely different made from Milk Chocolate Chips but I will never know.    I have always made scratch fudge and will continue to do so.  Wish I could taste what others are tasting with this fudge but it can not be compare to scratch homemade fudge.

My mom's recipe from the 60's called this "Magic French Fudge" for unknown reasons.  I have been making this for over forty years with a recipe from my 70's Nestle cookbook.  Always a hit.  I have to hide it if I make it ahead of time for an occasion or it will disappear like magic.

I did it with white chocolate instead of regular and used 2 1/2 cups approximately. It tasted great and I would definitely use this recipe again!

Overall, this  recipe was okay. A little too much "chocolate bar-ish" for me. I put peanuts in the batter, so that helped the blandness a bit. This was very quick, like 5 minutes quick, but overall not amazing fudge.

Delicious and absolutely full proof.  This is also a great starter recipe for young cooks. You’re not “cooking” so much as warming slowly. My husband is the only family member who likes nuts in the fudge,so I do half with pecans (roast them for 15 minutes @ 325 with a pinch of salt for extra flavor ) and the kids like mini marshmallows. 
I’ve made this for so long,people just expect it.   This fudge recipe along with Eagle Brand 7 layer bars are perfect small but sweet treats

This recipe shows 3 cups of chips and a 14 oz can of sweet condensed milk. I was making it and it was too thick. Other recipes show 2 cups of chips to one can of milk so I added 7 more oz of sweet condensed milk to this and it started to melt and look better.

I have been making this fudge for longer than I really care to admit!  The variations are endless:
dark chocolate (60% or more) nuts, and espresso powder
white chocolate with orange zest, dried cranberries and nuts
melt peanut butter with your favorite chocolate
you are really only limited by your imagination.  I've never had a batch fail.  Use the best chocolate you can find, it truly will make a difference. 
Enjoy~

Used 1/2 chocolate chips and 1/2 Lindt milk chocolate.  It was delicious!  Might add some marshmallows to half next time.  I like that it doesn't make a huge amount!  Great easy recipe!

I thought this was just meh.  Instead of the vanilla I used a flavored liqueur which I've done before with a different recipe.  Everyone else seemed to like this, so I give it a 4.  I did it on the stove and at one point I thought the chocolate would seize up, it got kind of hard to stir at the end.  I'll probably use this again since it was so easy and everyone else liked it.

The only change I made was I added two tablespoons of butter. I have made this many, many times over the past month.  Everyone LOVES it!  Even my picky older son.  Who said "I ONLY like real fudge!"  He kept eating it and was surprised at the texture and taste.

Note the 2nd positive review: "I use one bag go milk chocolate chips and add 1/2 bag of semi-sweet also. This leaves a very nice creamy texture. Here's a little tip that everyone loves. Freeze the remaining 1/2 bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips. At the end of stirring, pour in the frozen chocolate chips, give the mix one good, quick, final stir, pour into pan and refrigerate. (I like it cold!) The mixture is hot enough to melt part, but not all, of the frozen chips. It will leave tiny chocolate chunks throughout. Want another tip? After preparing as I did above, add one cup of peanut butter to this recipe before the final stirring and refrigerate. Mmmm!! (If adding the frozen chocolate chips, always add them last to prevent them from melting totally.) Having trouble getting it out of the pan? Line the pan with foil. After it sets, simply lift it out, remove the foil, and place the fudge on a dish or cutting surface to cut."

So easy, so delicious! I have to hide them in my fridge to keep from devouring them all by myself! Added a bit more walnuts to make them crunchier. Plan to make another batch and package them as Christmas treats for my friend. Thanks for a real keeper!

i made the exact recipe. it is so easy. used the microwave version. when you use the wax paper in pan it lifts out fine. i would be careful if using the tip of dipping pan in warm water, it may change consistency.  remember chill, not freeze. a good easy , fast fudge recipe.

I made the Rocky Road variation of this fudge recipe, and it came out great!  Lining the 9x13 baking dish with wax paper makes removal very easy.  I will definitely be making a lot of this 
Rocky Road fudge around the holidays.

I took the suggestion to try different ingredients.   I used a 14oz bag of coconut flakes, blended well with the morsels and Bakers semi sweet squares of chocolate, instead of walnuts.  (Next time I may use them both :)  Measurements are by eye, taste and consistency.  As it cools and thickens, I'll spoon generous dollops onto a cookie sheet resting on a bed of ice cubes in the sink.

I don't know what I was thinking.  I guess I was distracted when I was throwing together several desserts and used this recipe to make some fudge.  Brought it to the party and only then realized that it was like dark chocolate fudge.  Not gross, but not my cup of tea either.  Most people at the party were looking for a milk chocolate fudge, but a few people thought it was really delicious.  So not really a loss, but I would make the appropriate changes next time.

I love this fudge! It doesn't have quite the same flavor or texture as the classic 'never fail' cooked variety, but it still excellent (and a lot quicker!). I used 2c semi sweet and 1c milk chocolate morsels, and 2 tsp vanilla. I make a couple of batches a year and keep small portions in the freezer.

This fudge is so delicious and simple! Great for a quick sweet treat. I've made it twice in the last week, the first time-exactly as written. The second time I was short on semi-sweet chips, so used two cups semi and one cup milk chocolate chips. Be sure to use good quality chips, as the chocolate is the main focal point. With the second batch, I did not stir the nuts in, but after pouring the fudge in the pan, I sprinkled the top with chopped pecans and toffee chips, and pressed it in so it would stick, before placing fudge in fridge to set. I placed each square in a mini baking cup and stacked it on a pretty tray. Everyone loved it! No one knows how simple it was to make ;D

I did 1 cup dark chocolate chunks and 2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips and substituted peppermint extract for the vanilla (in equal measure).  I used a double boiler and melted the ingredients until they were just barely all soft and mixed then took them off the heat immediately.  My husband said this is the best fudge he's ever had - not too sweet, just the right consistency.  This will be a Christmas staple!

I've made this as written and it's pretty good - a bit dark, but ok.  I decided to make it today, using 1/2 semi-sweet and 1/2 milk chocolate, 1 t. Kahlua, and 1 t. vanilla - I also added a good sized pinch of instant coffee along with a cup of walnuts.  Results is a type of mocha candy - not too sweet and has that little "something different" about it.  Try it for a change!

I love the original recipe. It is easy and simple and delicious.

However, I tried the rocky road variation, and it was not good. Way too many marshmallows for the amount of chocolate used. I bet it will taste nice,  but because the chocolate cannot adequately cover the marshmallows, it is ugly and doesn't spread nicely in the pan. I give that recipe 2 stars.
