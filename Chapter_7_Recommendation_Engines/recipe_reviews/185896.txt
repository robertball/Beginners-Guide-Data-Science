This soup is a little labor-intensive, but completely worth the time and effort.  I didn't follow the directions exactly.  I blended the bacon in with the vegetables, rather than using it just for the drippings and as a garnish.  I added a little olive oil to the pan when sauteeing the celery and carrot.  My partner can't eat onions so I omitted that and I don't miss it.  I added nutmeg to the mix rather than as a garnish.  I didn't strictly follow the timing of cooking the celery, apples, garlic, etc. because I was going to boil it down over several hours.  This thick, creamy, comforting soup has a bouquet of flavors.  The squash, then the bacon, then the apple, then the curry and spices and celery and carrot and garlic bloom on your tongue.  Marvelous and complex.  This soup could sell for $8/bowl in a snazzy restaurant.  It's amazing!  I'm serving it tonight with a garlic/cheddar/mozzarella/parmesan bread and pomegranate juice and some vanilla yogurt drizzled with melted seedless blackberry jam.

This was actually quite excellent and well worth the effort.  This has a rich blend of flavors that will catch peoples' attention, yet is also somehow simple enough that my kids went back for seconds and thirds - something that almost never happens.  A few notes: (1) I did not have apple cider onhand so used 3 cups of unsweetened applesauce with a touch of cinnamon instead and it came out great (I'll be curious to see if it's better/worse with cider next time); (2) I doubled the curry and still barely noticed it so would recommend others do the same; (3) if you use microwave steam bags for the squash you can avoid using the oven and can get it cooked in 6 minutes, shaving some time off the overall prep time; and (4) definitely blend this... we're a family that likes chunky soups and I read the review suggesting to leave it chunky (I used a potato masher instead of blender) and the result was everyone in the family opting to stick theirs in the blender.  This does not make a great chunky soup in my opinion, but is restaurant-quality as a blended soup.  This was truly excellent and the best thing we've made out of over 20 top-rated recipes from this site.

I made exactly as the recipe stated.  Way too vinegary for my family.  Other than that I think it has the potential to be a good soup.  If I ever made again I would considerably cut the vinegar.

I make butternut squash soup all the time - most of the time without a recipe - but I decided i had to try this and I am thrilled with the results.  I did not have bacon - so I just skipped this step and instead sauteed everything in butter and olive oil.  (i also didn't have celery)  I also went heavy on the curry.  We are skipping the sour cream when serving because it's so good - and so healthy - why ruin a good thing.  I think if I had used the bacon the sour cream might be needed.  We'll see because I'm making this again for sure!  *Note - someone reviewed this and said it was too vinegary ....?  Made no sense to me and then I realized they must have used apple cider vinegar instead of apple cider.  Made correctly - it isn't vinegary at all.  The apple really makes this extra special.

this soup is full of bold, delicious flavors. My boyfriend and I both enjoyed it a lot. I used just one quart of chicken broth instead of 1 and a half. I tripled the curry powder as another reviewer suggested. Oh, and I poured most of the bacon fat out of the pot before adding the onions and other veggies. The fat from 8 slices of bacon was just too much in my opinion.

I've made this once a week since I found this recipe. We love it! It does take time to make. I also make my own chicken broth and leave all the meat in the soup from the chicken, so that take even more time but makes it a meal with meat. And it is SO worth the effort! What I also do different is, I use leeks instead of celery, I use 3 apples instead of one and never puree it up, we love it chucky with the chicken and all the veggies and the sweet chunks of apple. Oh, its a favorite my kids will consider a comfort food mom made growing up.

This soup is excellent the way it is written, don't understand why anyone would make all the changes to it and then give it a 4+ rating. You really need to roast the squash in the oven to give this soup its full flavor. Bacon + sour cream finish are a must.

I think they need to increase the prep time.. it is very time consuming to make .. but the results are worth it. I made it exactly as listed, and it was awesome.  I recommend making a double batch, then for all your efforts, you'll have some to freeze.

This is a delicious soup, perfect to enjoy on a cool fall day. The only things I did differently was add two apples, a little less carrots and celery and used 3 tablespoons of curry powder. I used two medium size butternut squashes, which I cut in half and roasted and then scooped into the soup. The blend of flavors is outstanding. I will definitely be making this again!!

Very good soup.  I added chicken and apple sausage to the blended soup and it was a great addition.  I had to make several changes since I did not have all the ingredients on hand, but it still worked well.  I had no celery or carrots, so I added more onions.  I didn't have enough butternut squash, so I added some acorn squash.  I had no apple cider, so I used white grape juice.  All in all, a great recipe that you can adjust to what you have in the kitchen.  Thanks for the recipe!

Oh. My. God. This soup is perfection in a bowl!  I made it for a meeting at work (I"m a Hotel Manager) at got such rave reviews it was a little embarassing! I scaled the recipe to serve 18 so the only change I made was to increase the carrot & celery and added about 3 cups of apple cider. It is the best soup I've ever made! The bacon and sour cream finish this dish perfectly. I WILL be making this again...and again...and again.

This recipe was made exactly as written.  Simply said... Excellent Soup.  I too can see this being served at a fine restaurant for $8+ per bowl.  Some thoughts.  If you don't have an immersion blender, buy one.  For under 30 bucks, you can own the best stick blender there is (Cuisinart).  Spending more won't get you better quality.  Using a standard blender for this hot soup is both tedious and dangerous if your not on your game.  Also you can have it all blended in the same Dutch Oven you've prepared it in.  Also, I looked for frozen squash in three local supermarkets and couldn't find it.  Had to settle for the fresh version and the extra work peeling and cutting the squash.  This was so Yum Delicious!!!!.

LOL!! Did I mess this up the first time. I do all my cooking on Sunday for the entire week.  It's the only day I have time to invest in the kitchen - so I generally prepare several "food bases" that I can combine during the week for lunch and dinner. So.... apple cider does NOT equal apple cider vinegar.  I had several timers going off at the same time - wasn't really paying attention to the soup and did I ROYALLY screw up.  Fortunately 40 years of cooking and intuition told me to scale the vinegar WAY back - down to about 1/4 of a cup.  It actually turned out great with the addition of a wee bit of red pepper flakes to balance it out.  So.. gave it a second try - this time with apple cider - just as written and loved it!  Perfect for a cold winter warm up.

LOVED this recipe but with the following mods as I can't have celery or sour cream:

Roasted the onion and added two sweet potatoes with the butternut squash(peeled and cubed)
Cut down to 1 qt of chicken broth and added one can of full fat coconut milk
Added about ¼ cup of brown sugar once soup is blended
Added about 1 tsp of ground cayenne pepper to give it a bit more kick!
Cut out the celery as I’m not supposed to have it

Delicious! I scaled it way down for just the two of us and i was very impressed. Excellent depth of flavor and fairly healthy, too! Didn't have apple cider so i used apple juice and a splash of white wine.  The sour cream and bacon garnishes give this soup a "wow" factor, and a pinch of nutmeg rounds it out.

This recipe took so much time to make!  It has a unique flavor that isn't bad, it is just not what my husband and I are used to.  I can see why a lot of people liked it, but we ended up throwing it out.

To those who complained of a vinegar taste.  It calls for Apple Cider,  not apple cider vinegar.  I don't think it's fair to give a bad rating when you didn't follow the instructions.  I also oven roasted my carrots to deepen the flavor.

Hubby and I loved this soup it was absolutely wonderful and so full of flavor. 

We didn't have the butternut squash but we did have 4 small pumpkins which we used instead. Hubby is not a curry fan but agreed to put some in so we only used half of what was called for. I also tossed two cinnamon sticks in the pot as it simmered. 


Thank you LEXINOLE29 for sharing this recipe with us!

I didn't use the bacon, as I didn't have any, so I used a little olive oil and a little butter to saute the veggies.  I would still only use the cooked and crumbled bacon for garnish rather than have all the bacon grease in the soup.  I thought it was very good and will make it again as it was not difficult.  I think the roasting (rather than microwaving) gave it a richer flavor.

I am a big fan of butternut squash and am always looking for good recipies to use. This recipie is a definite keeper in our house. The cider and apples were an excellent paring. I used a sweet curry. And I find that cilantro added to anything with curry is an excellent garnish. The soup freezes well (I leave the sour cream and cilantro out until after it is reheated). Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

As a recipe it looks great. I have not tried this soup but read the "most helpful critical revue" who said it was "too vinegary".   There is NO vinegar in this recipe.   Could they have misread the directions and used cider vinegar instead of apple cider?

This is very tasty, and I didn't use any bacon. It probably would have been better with it; I just didn't have any in the freezer. It is also very laborious. I may make a different recipe next time because of how long it took.

No apple cider? Consider white wine. Have some turnips and parsnips hanging around the kitchen? Dice and cook with the carrots. If you have some left over beef broth in the refrigerator, then go ahead and add it along with the chicken broth. Forget the bacon grease, use olive oil to cook the vegetables. The apple and curry powder are important.

I just made this tonight, and it was fantastic. But the prep time is definitely longer--the squash took 45 minutes to really be soft, and the carrots took longer as well. Still, it's worth the considerable work that goes into it.

I served it with a loaf of pumpernickel bread, which goes very nicely with it.

Awesome!  Left out the sour cream garnish, as we are not fans of sour cream.  It was delicious...the bacon really made this soup so much better than other recipes, and added a heartiness to it, as well.

Awesome recipe, I use 1/2 cup of apple butter instead of the cider if I don't have it.  That works great and also reduces cooking time.  Pre-roasted then frozen butternut squash also makes it an easier dinner to make.

This. is. the. best. soup. EVER. Though I substituted apple cider for some apple butter that didn't turn out right. Cut back on the bacon, too. And omitted celery, since it's a useless vegetable. Just use more carrots, it's healthier that way!

We have been searching for a long time to find a hearty butternut squash soup - most of the ones that we have tried are somewhat unfulfilling to us - but this one covers all the bases. I halved the amount of bacon called for to cut down on the fat, used no olive oil and tripled the amount of curry powder (sweet curry powder, not hot), but otherwise left the recipe alone. I wanted to immersion blend the whole pot, but the hubby wanted to leave it chunky, so we compromised and only partially blended it, leaving some chunks. It is pretty tasty this way and I think it would probably have the widest appeal this way. Great dish for fall!

In short - a complex soup not for everyone, better the next day. Mix the bacon bits into the soup to get the flavor mixed through. Try a drizzle of balsamic vinegar on top or cook it with vinegar. Personally, I don't like the soup without the vinegar and I don't think I like the apple cider.

This soup is perfect for cold days.  It has just the right balance of sweetness and the curry powder gives it a subtle spiciness.  I prefer it without the bacon and sour cream.

Wow.  This is my first review after using scores of recipes off this site.  I had to write as this is an excellent soup.  I love buttercup squash anyway, and I'm a squash soup fan, but this recipe is remarkable.  Thanks for sharing it.  It does take some time to make, but everyone thought the flavor was wonderful...even the folks who don't care for curry.  Followed the recipe except instead of apple cider I threw some homemade applesauce, apple cider vinegar and water together to replace the cider.  Also used homemade chicken broth.

I have made this twice and the raves are for more.  I have halved the receipt and it is just right for two people for the main course with a serving left over for lunch the next day.  using an immersion blender I have added 4 cups of chicken stock and the consistency is just right.

Totally delicious. I can't eat onion so omitted it. I think the recipe means to say apple cider vinegar for apple cider. Since someone complained that it was too vinegary, I used about  1/2 to 2/3 of what it called for. I also used my immersion blender and since I chopped the veggies on the small side, it was a snap! I agree, a lot of work, but way worth it and lots to freeze for later.

Fantastic recipe & taste! My other half is a meat-eater & had never tried butternut squash. He not only made this, he loved it, and so did I. We used all the ingredients mentioned, even nutmeg, and we declared this recipe a staple for our winter eats.

This soup has a ton of complexity.  Very interesting and enjoyable combination of flavors.  I roasted the squash in halves instead of dicing, which may have lost some of the caramelization sweetness, but it was still great.  I tried with and without Greek yogurt (sub for sour cream), and I liked it better without the yogurt.  Bacon was a nice addition.

Had never tried making a squash soup at home but always enjoyed it at restaurants. This is a new favorite soup now! The preparation time is underestimated -- cutting, peeling and roasting the squash takes a while, so does preparing the other ingredients. Overall, a wonderful recipe with bold and rich flavors. Bonus: it even freezes well (before the garnish of sour cream).

I loved this soup, but the rest of my family did not.  I'll call it lack of taste on their part!  One thing--I used a hot curry, and for that spice, the amount is too much.  My mistake.  However, I loved the flavor of the end product, just wished it didn't have so much kick.

Delish! It was creamy and hearty and such wonderful flavor.  I had no curry or celery in the house so I left those two things out.  I also used Turkey Bacon instead of regular bacon, and since that created no "Drippings" I put some olive oil in the pan to cook the veggies.  If I had to change one thing, I would put less Thyme. I like that spice, but a little goes a long way and it seemed to overpower it a bit.  Otherwise, I'm putting it on rotation in my house!

This was very time consuming. I roasted the butternut squash on a pan with 1/4 c. water while I was doing the other preparations & just scooped it out when it was done & I was ready for it. It did have a very intense flavor, but somehow with all the seasonings, I didn't taste much squash. Actually I tasted more celery than squash. I also didn't puree it as my kiddos don't care for that texture. I opted to use my electric mixer to beat the soup on med-low while still in the pot just before serving. This way I could control the consistency & didn't have to juggle "batches" to and from my blender. All in all, it was a good soup, but a bit overwhelming if you (as I did) plan it as the main course. I will make it again, only next time I plan on cutting back the curry (I love it, but it drown out the other flavors... I couldn't taste the apple at all.), adding twice the bacon & a tiny bit of liquid smoke. I think that would be the perfect variation to make it more of a rounded hearty meal in itself.

I love this dish, I have made it several times and have modified it each time depending on my ingredients. I add much more curry and also a pinch of cayenne. I frequently leave out the bacon. I usually get my apples, cider and Squash from the farmers market and the quality and freshness really change the flavor. I have also garnished the soup with toasted coconut, Yum!

I have made this a few times and it is my favorite soup recipe!  One change I have made every time that seemed obvious to me was to roast the carrots as well as the squash (note: don't mix them together in a single roasting pan; the cooking time for the carrots is shorter). I also found 375 degrees a little low to get a good brown on the roasting vegetables, so I increased it to 400. 

I saw one reviewer who recommended doubling the curry powder.  I thought the amount of curry powder was just right.  Enough to add complexity, but not enough that the curry hits you over the head.

Excellent soup, will make again.  Added a leek, only had apple juice... which I think made the soup aliitle too sweet for me but my husband loved it. Next time I will try the apple cider. Was scared about the 2 tsps of curry but went for it and it was great.  Instead of the sour cream ( didn't have any) I blended 3 tbsps cream cheese into soup. Very creamy without being over powering. I roasted the squash the night before which really cut down on the prep time for the next day.

I made a delicious vegan version of this soup. I may even make it for Thanksgiving, but in the future I will add a few cardamom pods and some cinnamon.

This was quite delicious.  It was time consuming chopping all the veggies, but it was also quite easy to make.  Next time I think I will add more squash and a little less of the carrots and celery, but that is just a personal preference. I think the bacon added a nice crunch and the sour cream added the perfect creaminess.

This soup is definitely a labor of love!  It's good but IMO, not worth the time and effort.  I didn't know when to add the squash (and for all the work, you don't even really taste the squash---there's a ton of flavors going on!).  The curry definitely adds something.  I will keep looking for a squash soup recipe.  sorry

this is delicious. I had to add about a cup more water as it was super thick, but then my squash was huge and homegrown.

WONDERFUL taste, like that of a "farm to table" restaurant.  Followed the recipe exactly.  There is NO vinegar taste, unless you accidentally use apple cider VINEGAR instead of apple CIDER.  Wish I had followed my original instinct and doubled the recipe.  Made it on Tuesday to serve on Thursday for Thanksgiving.  Will have to work hard to keep family from eating it before guests arrive Thursday.

I spent well over an hour making this recipe EXACTLY according to instructions. We did not care for this - way too much thyme - it should be completely eliminated in my opinion.  Would be delicious with just the squash, onions, celery, and bacon with a little salt and pepper!

This is the most flavorful and absolutely delicious butternut squash soup I have ever tasted!  I  used half the amount of apple cider.  Also, after cooking bacon, I was left with a lot of bacon grease to cook veggies.  I kept  about 1/2 T of the grease, and added a bit of olive oil. We used greek yogurt instead of the sour cream. This soup is packed with flavor. My teens and my hubby loved it!

Really delicious. I bought pre-packaged  and cubed butternut squash to save time and aggravation. I didn't have cider so I substituted it with a cup of applesauce. I found it a bit too sweet right away, but by the next day the flavors had melded and it was just about perfect. As others suggested I added more curry (doubled it), and it wasn't too much. I also added the bacon right before I pureed the soup instead of just crumbling it on top. Yum!

This was a little disappointing.  Maybe I messed it up by not having apple cider. I tried to compensate by doubling the apple and adding a little applesauce as well. Still, in the end I couldn't taste apple at all. Not a bad soup by any means... just nothing special.

I can't think of how this could get any better.  My husband who normally hates soup only dinners ate this up and had a second help because it was so hardy.  Easy to make. Loved by all.  Will defiantly make again.

Excellent soup. When I first tried it I thought it was a little bit bland, but after a few bites it seemed to come alive. I lovely followed the directions. I used epicure mango curry powder and estimated all of the vegetables. I also added the bacon when I blended the soup at the end

Absolutely love this soup!  I made a few changes because I am plant based.   Left out the bacon, oil,  and sour cream.  Also, I didn't have any apple cider so I substituted with apple cider vinegar.   You cannot go wrong with this soup.  Delicious!  This will definately make the monthly rotation list!

I split my squash in half, drizzle with olive oil, salt and pepper and roast it cut side down for about 40 minutes; makes it super easy to scoop out for this dish

I've made this twice and would do it more often if not for the fact that it can be quite labor intensive (ain't nobody got time for that!) Super yummy.
I love all the flavors blending together though i feel the apple flavor does get lost in the mix. Next time I may increase the apple cider

Giving the wife a break from the kitchen, I was looking to use some of our newly picked squash when I came across this recipe. I like the fact that it is dairy free.
Overall this was fantastic. I did modify the recipe a bit. I basically doubled all ingredients. I cut the squash in half and baked them over coconut oil, then scooped out the squash and threw the skin away. This is a little bit less labor intensive then peeling all those "hard to peel" squash and cutting them up when they are hard. I also used three different squash. Butternut, Sweet Dumpling and Kabocha. I added a bit more bacon (thick cut applewood smoked) to the recipe and used it in the soup instead of as a garnishment. I also added the nutmeg  to the mixture while simmering. It does take a bit more time to prep, but it is well worth it in the end.
This soup is full of flavors especially with the three squash. The mixture of curry, apples and smoked applewood bacon was amazing, not to mention my house smelled amazing all night!

This was not that great considering how much work it involved and the expense of the ingredients.  Among the men in my family, one did not finish his first bowl; one refused to eat it the next day.  None of them are picky eaters.  I would not make this again.

Did not care for it at all. Significant aftertaste.  The bacon almost saved it but even bacon only marginally helped.   Significant amount of work to make it and the results were very disappointing.  Sorry

The recipe is a keeper! I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I halved the squash, seeded it & roasted it cut side down for 40 minutes at 350 F. After cooling slightly I peeled and chopped the squash. This method is much easier but granted the flavour may be slightly different.

The flavors of this soup are similar to a muligatawny soup.  The ingredients are pretty much the same minus the rice.  I did make a few minor adjustments (half recipe): I omitted the bacon because I did not have any on hand, I used an entire onion, about 8 oz of carrots, 2 celery stalks, 4 cloves of garlic and 1 granny smith apple.  Instead of chopping the veggies and fruit, I put it in the food processor.  I'm not sure if the apple juice is necessary.  The next time I make this soup, I will make it without the juice.  I also used about 2 tsp. of curry and used about 2 cups of chicken stock.

This soup is absolutely delicious.  I've made it twice pretty much exactly as the recipe describes.  My only addition was walnuts as a extra garnish that I think provides some nice crunch and flavor.

this is a great soup and very similar to the way I have made it in the past but instead of putting it in the blender in batches I just puree it in the pot with my braun hand blender.

Amazing. I subbed celeriac for the celery and added a couple of radishes I had lying around, but other than that I followed the recipe. Worth the work.

love this recipe!  I halved the recipe and forgot to halve the apple cider (oops!) but we found that we actually enjoyed the extra sweetness.  My fiance doesn't like curry, so I omitted it and didn't miss it.  Full of flavor all on it's own.  A definite winner, and perfect for a chilly autumn night!

Delicious, I made this recipe pretty much as it was stated. But I did change a few things. I didnt have any celery so I used a teaspoon of celery salt instead. I added 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper also I had 2 beats in the fridge so I put them in as well.  Also at the end after I pureed the soup I added 1 cup of half and half. It came out wonderfully creamy. A dollop of sour cream in each serving sealed the deal on this recipe! I will be making this again and so should you!!

A wonderfully creamy, filling soup that was exploding with flavor. I will make this again next fall.

Yum.  This was really tasty.  But it wasn't the easiest thing to make!  I prepped the day before making by cutting up all of my veggies/bacon/apples and roasting the squash and it still took a long time to make the next day.  Made a ton though and we enjoyed it for days.  Used apple juice instead of apple cider because that is what I had on hand.  Garnished with extra crumbled bacon.
