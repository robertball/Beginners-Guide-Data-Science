I made this for Thanksgiving last year.  I made a few substitutions, and it still turned out great.  Instead of dried mushrooms, I used lots of portabellos, and I jused chopped onion instead of the frozen onions.  It was absolutely marvelous.  My guests loved it.

This recipe turned out great.  I followed the same advice as the person who reviwed it before me.  My guests commented that it was tasty and the texture of the meat was good.  I recommend this recipe for anyone who is trying duck for the first time.
