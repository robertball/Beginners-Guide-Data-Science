Delicious!  I candy the walnuts by melting a small amount of brown sugar in a pan on low heat and then moving the walnuts around in the melted sugar using a rubber spatula.  Then I place the walnuts on a sheet of wax paper, sprinkle immediately with coarse salt, and break apart the stuck-together pieces.  You can use more or less brown sugar, depending on whether you'd like the walnuts coated with sugar or just slightly sweet (as I prefer).  The mixture of roasted beets, goat cheese (chevre), sweet and salty walnuts, and spinach is terrific!  I've never made it with pickled onions (because I haven't had any) or fried onions (because they're pretty unhealthy).  I make the balsamic dressing using my own recipe, but I'm sure the quick dressing would be fine, too.

A delicious combination of flavors.  The amount of pickled onions should be 1/4 cup.  I used thinly sliced red onion instead of pickled onion.  Thanks!

This recipe was good but a little too vinegary for me. I reduced about 1 cup of balsamic vinegar to make the balsamic cr√®me and candied pecans instead of walnuts because that's what I had on hand. I also skipped the fried onions - I never buy them. Thanks
