I have a 13 1/2 year old lab that is recuperating from illness and she loves boiled chicken so I added the chicken to this mixture and it is all that she will eat right now!

One of the recipes I used when my pup went through chemo. Also, mashed pumpkin is helpful when a dog's appetite is poor.

I've made this myself for my little shih tzu who always has tummy problems.  Adding chicken to it makes it more appealing to her (yes very picky eater), and it does help settle her tummy.

Dogs are carnivores and need to eat meat. This is not a nutritionally sound thing to give dog even if it's sick. Throw in some chicken, chicken liver and liquid dog vitamins and it might be a little healthier.

Our new 6mo. Pup was a stray, she was pretty skinny when we got her and she wouldnâ€™t eat anything.. this has been a life saver for us. She loves this, I also add in some chunked zucchini. Who knew something so simple would be so effective :)
