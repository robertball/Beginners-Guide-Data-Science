The pudding and cool whip mixture for the filling was good in this recipe.  I used a different glaze instead of the apricot preserves.  I found a different lemon glaze on a different recipe that I found on here.  I suggest greasing the pan for baking the puff pastry sheet and it needs to cook much longer than 15 minutes.  The white chocolate was excellent on the top, but I was disappointed after I put it there.  It made my tart look messy.  It looked much better with just the fruit.  I would definitely make this again but I would put the white chocolate on before placing the fruit.

My 10-yr-old daughter made this one by herself, and it turned out fantastic! She did everything exactly like the recipe. Easy and delicious. I give it four stars only because I prefer a sugar cookie crust to the puff pastry, but this is very, very good.

I get people at work begging me to make this for events.  For work, I changed this to use small pie shells to turn it into a tart, and put just a dash of cinnamon on the tart shell before baking.  And some have said the white chocolate is too sweet (I disagree) so I have also made this with semi-sweet chocolate with good reviews at work.

To make it more diet friendly, fat free, sugar free vanilla pudding, nonfat milk, and cool whip lite don't really change the taste but really make this a diet friendly dessert similar to a Weight Watcher's recipe I found.  

Any way you make it, this is a great recipe.
