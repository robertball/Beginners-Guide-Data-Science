EDITED: I made these twice now. First time I made them stovetop and continued basting the burgers in the juices that were running out. My husband said these were the best burgers ever. I used Borsin cheese instead of blue and mixed it in. Second time - we grilled them and juices ran out. Still good but not amazing.  LESSON LEARNED - these should be made stove top.

We probably eat this recipe at least once a week - love it!  We add a full container of the crumbled bleu cheese (about 1/2 cup) directly to the mixture and it makes 8 burgers (much better than sprinkled on top). Great the 2nd day too (and don't worry if the burgers appear "black" out of the fridge... that's just the mushrooms with all the moisture. They're wonderful!  We fry in a pan with just a touch of butter if it's not grilling season. Thanks for the recipe.

These burgers just received rave reviews from my family, they were very moist and flavorful as well as easy to prepare.   I altered the recipe in some minor ways according to what I had on hand.  I used 20oz. ground turkey (that's what was in the pkg.), two medium sized portobella mushroom caps (probably about 3oz.), and feta cheese rather than blue cheese that I crumbled into the mixture before cooking.  I also cooked them on the stovetop in a nonstick pan sprayed with oil.  I made the patties rather small, there were 10 total, thus avoiding the 'falling apart' problem mentioned in a couple of the reviews.
  They were great!  I have already added this recipe to my personal file and will undoubtedly use it as a starting point for endless variations.

There is simply no better way to make turkey burgers!  I was quite dubious about this recipe's success, owing to a personal aversion to blue cheese, but I was stunned, and pleasantly so, by the flavour of these burgers.  I'll never settle for a bland, insipid turkey burg again!  As for my method, I followed the advice of the other reviewers who incorporated the cheese directly in the meat.  I also used tinned mushrooms, which did not seem to diminish or detract from flavour or texture.

I add the cheese into the mixture before grilling, and usually add more than it suggests.  Grilling these on the George Foreman works great.  It turns into a year round recipe.  Once you make these, it's hard to go back to plain turkey burgers.

Fresh ground turkey works for burgers much better than frozen, thawed turkey thus eliminating the need for bread crumbs, etc. Added four cloves of garlic and some steak seasoning.  Sauted onions, garlic and mushrooms before adding to the turkey to reduce water in the mushrooms.  Did not have blue cheese; used crumbled feta and added to the mixture.   The mushrooms make these very good.

Excellent burgers.  I left out the blue cheese and they are still moist and delicious.  I don't make any other kind of ground beef burgers anymore because these are so much more better than the normal one's.  Love this recipe!~

These are pretty good! I mixed the blue cheese in with the meat and everything else. I did forget the chopped onion, but they were still good -- I just served them with fresh sliced onion instead. I used the leftovers to make Italian Wedding Soup the next day!

These were super! We're always on the lookout for healthy recipes and these were easy, quick AND tasty. We used goat cheese since we didn't have blue cheese and the combined flavors really complimented each other. Thanks!!

Yum! Yum! Yum!  This is a great burger - turkey or otherwise.  Only change I made was to use worchestershire sauce instead of soy and added a bit more cheese to the mixture.  Served on toasted buns with tomato slices and additional bleu cheese dressing for those who wanted more.  Have also varied the recipe by adding herbed feta cheese instead of bleu and serving in a pita with cucumber sauce.  Thanks so much for the recipe, Trish,  It is a big favorite at our house!

I used Worchestshire instead of soy, and added much less than 1 onion and 8 oz of mushrooms (just a handful of chopped onion and handful of chopped shrooms since that's all I had).  Added all the blue cheese - mixed all of it together (cheese in the meat too) and cooked on a skillet for 10 min a side.  Topped them with avocado and they turned out GREAT!  Juicy and wonderful - my first try at turkey burgers was a success!!! Will totally make again, and love that the recipe is open to mixing/matching anything you want in the meat (green chiles and cheddar would probably be good, or spinach and feta, yum....).

These were excellent turkey burgers and I've made many recipes.  I sauteed the onion and mushroom for a couple of minutes and let it cool some before adding it to the meat.  I also decided to cut the fat by using Wishbone "Just 2 Good" blue cheese dressing instead of crumbled blue cheese, plus like others here suggested I put it in the mixture and not on top.  The burgers were very wet so I added more turkey until the consistency looked right.  I grilled them on a grill pan on my stove and they came out totally awesome.  Turkey burgers can be dry but these were moist and delicious.  We ate them on buns with no toppings and thoroughly enjoyed them nonetheless.  This recipe is getting added to my favorites!

Tasty and simple! I cooked mine on the skillet and they turned out great. There's enough meat/mushroom mix to make five burgers if you want. I'll definitely be making these again.

This really is an excellent recipe. I had intended to make a similar recipe using beef when I ran across this one and I just had to make it instead. I took a few minor ideas from the other recipe and added it to this one: habanera Tabasco sauce, chives, & Worcestershire sauce. When I got it mixed up I decided that it would probably make an incredible meatloaf so instead of making patties out of it I formed it into a loaf and baked it in a bread pan at 350 degrees for 75 minutes. It turned out mouthwateringly delicious.

I have got to say that this was the best turkey burger I have ever eaten!! Hubby and I loved these burgers. I had a large grilled leftover portabello mushroom which I used and finely chopped. I also added some sauteed vidalia onion and garlic. Used reduced fat blue cheese and the flavors were just fantastic. The burgers were juicy and you would get these little pockets of yummy blue cheese while you ate it. A true winning recipe for us. Thanks for sharing!!

my husband likes these better than regular hamburgers.  I add oats to help keep them together, and use tin foil if grilling them.

I mixed the blue cheese in with the other ingredients rather than using it as a topping. Next time I'll reduce the amt. of salt slightly.
My husband loved these!

Absolutely fantastic! So juicy and tasty I forgot it was turkey!  My boyfriend asked if we could make it again tomorrow!  My only changes: I used canned mushrooms, green onions, and I mixed the blue cheese into the turkey mixture because I was cooking it on my George Foreman grill. I definitely recommend this one! Enjoy!

Wow!  These were so easy to make.  I'm not a huge mushroom fan, but chopping them up very fine makes the burgers taste yummy!  The blue cheese on top makes them so incredibly delicious.  My teenager daughters loved them.  I'd make them again.

I will make this recipe on a regular basis but from now on will NOT use the soy sauce.  Between the soy sauce, the salt and the blue cheese it was overpoweringly salty.  I also prefer them made on the stove and mixing in the blue cheese then serving blue cheese crumbles for those wishing for more.  Definitely a keeper.

These are good but I think I will either eliminate the salt or cut back on the soy sauce next time.  Very salty and the soy sauce overwhelmed it in my opinion.... I think it would be excellent with the changes.  I mixed the cheese in with the other ingredients as well.

I don't rate many recipes, but this one was GREAT! I halved the recipe, added the cheese in with the meat (as suggested by other reviewers) and used a combination of dark and white ground turkey. Very moist, very tastey. Had to keep the neighbours away from my grill!

the concept was very good, but we switched it up a bit. pre-cooked the mushroom and onions to carmelize them a bit, and also mixed blue cheese into the meat mixture instead of on top. was a little heavy handed with the blue cheese. served them on chibatta bread to soak up the juices. hubby though they were yumm-o, i though they were a little blue cheesey. i think if you looove blue cheese, add it right in with a heavy hand. if not, add to the top of the burger as called for so it's not so pungent!

This was a really amazing recipe!

Changes I recommend:
1. Sautee Mushrooms and onions for ~5minutes in a bit of olive oil before adding to meat (don't let them get too tender)
2. Omit kosher salt (it's not neccessary with all of that soy sauce)
3. Add 1/4 tsp. hot chili flakes
4. Mix blue cheese right into patti mixture
5. Remember that the patties are soo flavourful in themselves, you hardly need to add any condiments to your burger!  Cheese buns are great with this recipe.

These burgers were moist and very flavorful. Delicious! I mixed the blue cheese in before grilling, but only used half.  My husband said that it was one of the best burger he's ever had - beef or turkey.

This recipe was a great hit with my dinner guests.  I did modify the recipe a bit as some of the others mentioned.  I added an egg and bread crumbs to ensure the burgers would stay together - worked like a charm and everyone raved!  I used the crumbled bleu cheese in the patty mixture and let me tell you how good that was :)   I will definitely be making this recipe again!

I'd never had a turkey burger until tonight, but in an effort to eat in a more healthy way, I tried this one that was among those with the highest reviews.  Well, been there/done that; won't be needing to do it again!

Interesting. I don't think I'd use the blue cheese or not as much as it overpowers the mushroom & soy sauce flavor. Also, make sure you use fresh, coarse, ground turkey & not a frozen roll. Will make again.

This was delicious even with lowest calorie ground turkey breast! I only added garlic powder and put the blue cheese crumbles in the burgers. Then pan fried in cooking spray so it was very low calorie. My husband loved it and could not even tell it was a healthy recipes. That makes it a winner in my book!

I made these last night for dinner. I did as a few reviewers suggested and added the blue cheese in with the mixed up meat and stuff, and I also pan fried them with a little cooking spray. They were excellent. My husband kept commenting how great they were, because as it turns out he was dreading "turkey burgers" since he doubted they could possibly taste good. How wrong he was! They were full of flavor, moist and tender, and easy to fix. Thanks for a great recipe!

I followed other suggestions and cut the salt and soy sauce in half, and this was still very salty to me. I would suggest people either omit the soy sauce or omit the salt. Because the blue cheese also adds sodium to the mix. I did saute the onion, mushroom, and some garlic for like a minute before adding to the mixture. I think I will def. make the sauteed veggies again, with blue cheese added to it for a delicious burger topping, but not to go in a burger. I love blue cheese, and this burger was just ok for me.

AWESOME turkey burger that was moist and FULL of flavor!!! I am usually not a huge fan of turkey burgers (too try and flavorless), and my red-meat-loving boyfriend never eats them..but I saw this recipe and had to give it a try. I didn't have any blue cheese on hand, so I melted a slice of colby-jack on top instead. Once I took a bit out of this, I was blown away! The mushrooms and soy sauce give this burger a nice flavor and it was as juicy as ground beef. My boyfriend even complimented me on making these. I'm definitely making these all summer..with or without the blue cheese!

Wow, these are the best burgers ever! We sauteed the vegetables before adding to the meat. Also used 1 TBS Worcestershire sauce and 1 TBS of soy sauce (instead of the 2TBS soy sauce). Mixed everything together including the blue cheese and cooked on the stovetop for 10 minutes either side. Serve with normal burger fixings. These were excellent!

These burgers are absolutely the best non-beef burgers I have ever had. The blue cheese topping is nice, but we skip the blue cheese because the burgers are fabulous without it. They are a lot more heart healthy this way.

We have made these for friends and family--everyone raves about these.

I made the mistake of trying to use frozen then thawed ground turkey as the recipe didn't specify fresh ground. Don't do it! Can't form burgers into patties. I ended up adding some Italian bread crums and they formed up well.

These were quite yummy. I also used a George Foreman grill and mixed the blue cheese inside, plus put more on top. The chopping blade of the food processor makes chopping the mushrooms quick and easy.

I loved this - even my kids loved it AND my super picky brother!!  The flavors were awesome.  I mixed the blue cheese into the meat.  I precooked the mushrooms and onions but not to completely dehydrated.  This is a 5 star as written.

But I always need to tweak recipes...  

I love strong mushrooms and cheese, so I will try this again with stronger blue cheese and stronger flavored mushrooms.

These are very tasty.  We used the 99% fat free Jenny O ground turkey, so the patties cooked much faster...3 min per side was close to too long. We did add the blue cheese to the mixture...great, but will add more next time.

Delicious!  I vary the type of cheese that I use (depending on what I've got on hand) between blue cheese, goat cheese, and feta cheese, and it tastes great every time.  Also, I add the cheese to the mixture before cooking the burgers (on the stove top), and I omit the black pepper.  This has become a weekly staple and a HIT in my house.  Thanks, Trish!

Great burger! Doubled the ground turkey, used 3 T soy sauce, red onion, one can mushrooms, chopped and 1/4 c blue cheese as that is all I had. It was wonderful this way, I think more soy sauce would have made it too salty. The cheese gave good flavor, but I think I would do 1/2 cup  to 2# ground turkey. The recipe is very forgiving, sonic you don't have exactly what the recipe calls for, go ahead and make it anyway...you won't be disappointed!

The first time making these I made the mistake of using the food processor to chop the mushrooms and onion, and it made it so moist that I had to add bread crumbs to even pat out the burgers. They ended up having a mushy consistency.   Taste was good, just not a good texture.  Second time I hand chopped them so they weren't so fine. Also used about half the amount of mushrooms. Added the blue cheese to the mix as suggested by others...Perfect!

You better really love blue cheese if you make these! I followed the suggestion of many reviewers who said to add the blue cheese crumbles into the turkey mixture instead of on top. Let's just say the taste was STRONG of blue cheese and not much else. The mushrooms did really nothing for these burgers. I added green onion instead of onion. I topped the burgers with tomatoes and cilantro and blue cheese dressing and served it with the ramen cole slaw from this site (which is excellent and I highly recommend).

This is an excellent burger!  My grown son loved them as well as my dil.  I added the cheese to the mixture and used the low fat garlic and herb cream cheese as some mentioned.  
I did them on the range top and had no problems flipping them.  I loved the dark evenly browned color.  Did not resemble turkey at all!  I will try these again with a strip of bacon and slice of tomato and lettuce.  Mmmm!

THIS was DELICIOUS! I used about 4 oz of mushrooms and a half an onion instead of a full one and thought it still came out delicious. I baked the burgers instead of grilling. Topped it with white american cheese. It was divine! Thanks for this easy recipe!

These were very easy to make, juicy, and made huge burgers. But they were bland, so I added blue cheese dressing for more flavor. There was too much onion. I do not think I will be making these again.

Delicious!  I sauteed the mushrooms and onions first, and decreased the soy sauce and salt a bit.  I used Trader Joe's smoked cheese blend.  So good and easy!

These were very good, but I made some changes after reading other reviews. I didnt add soy sauce, because the blue cheese is salty enough for my taste, but I replaced it with worcestershire. I also added about  1/3 cup of bread crumbs because of other reviewers comments about them falling apart. They turned out great, very moist and definately tasty. Next time I think I will saute the onions and mushrooms before adding them to the turkey burger and will probably make it into a meatloaf instead of burgers. Will definately make again and am forwarding this recipe to a friend who is always looking for something different.

Hubby LOVED these!  They were really tasty.  Added minced garlic and doubled  blue cheese.  Used Gorgonzola.  Added it in w/the meat :)  Fried in a pan w/butter.  Ended up making about 10 medium-sized patties.  Most of which I froze.  Just as tasty taken out of freezer and cooked on grill.

Like others, I added the cheese to the meat mixture.  I also added a red pepper for color.  These were so good!  I've made them twice in the past two weeks!

I quite enjoyed these. I followed the recipe, except:  1. I added a whole cup of blue cheese! Very, very cheesy, but I liked it. 2. I made 8 small burgers out of it instead of 4 big ones 3. I fried with a little nonstick spray in a pan  Served on whole wheat buns with mustard, lite mayo, and sprouts. Delicious! Ate one and froze the rest for future lunches.

I minced the onion and mushrooms in the food processor and sauteed them slowly in a bit of vegetable oil before adding to the meat.  Also substituted about 1 T Worcestershire for the soy sauce.  Cooked on stove top and added blue cheese on top.  Very moist, very tasty, but next time I will try mixing the cheese into the meat as well.

Excellent moist burgers but you only need about 1/4 cup finely diced onion.  Feta is great mixed in with meat and garlic salt is a better option.  Less soy sauce is also better

Yummy.  I chopped the mushrooms and onion in my Braun hand mixer so they would be fine, but it made the mixture very wet.  I cooked on a grill pan by scooping 3/4 cup of the mixture and just plopping on the pan.  If I had used a grill, it would have fallen through the grate, but I think that's my fault for the way I chopped.  Next time I'll drain the veggies before adding to the turkey (but still use the mixer cause it chops so well).  Also, the burgers were very oniony so I may reduce a little next time (the burgers were still fantastic, but depending on our mood, might like a little less onion).  I mixed in the cheese but we ended up adding more, so next time will just do what the recipe says and top with the cheese, and use a little more than is called for.

We have made this recipe twice now and absolutely love it.  The first time I sauteed the mushrooms and onions, but the second time I didn't--which we liked much better.   We also used 1/2 cup blue cheese and mixed it right into the meat with the other ingredients.  I also put the patties in the refrigerator for a couple of hours before they are to be grilled.  I think this helps keep them together better.  Bottom line:  Very quick, easy, and delicious.  My 2 year old daughter even gobbles hers up!

This is an excellent recipe - thank you for sharing!  I took tips from others and stuck these babies in the freezer for about 10 minutes prior to grilling, and everything held together wonderfully.  I had made them thick, so I used a little meat thermometer so I could tell when they were done without having to slice into them.  (I also mixed the cheese right into the patties.  Not sure it made a difference one way or another, but it was yummy.)  These burgers need no condiments, although I did spread a little honey dijon on the bun, because I do love mustard.  I served these with the Apple Cole Slaw recipe available on this site, and it was one delicious spring-time meal.  This recipe is a keeper!

I followed the recipe exactly, except my onion was very large so I used about 1/2.  I used ground turkey breast that hadn't been frozen like others had suggested.  The mixture was very wet and we couldn't form burgers out of it.  I ended up adding 1 to 2 cups of panko bread crumbs.  Even after adding the bread crumbs they were way too soft for the BBQ so we ended up cooking them on the stove top.  Next time I would use 1/2 the mushrooms and onion that the recipe calls for.  Once all was said and done they tasted great and weren‚Äôt hard like other turkey burgers I‚Äôve tried.

I loved this recipe. It was served right along with beef burgers and all the turkey ones were snatched up. The only change that I made was I put the blue cheese in with the turkey mixture instead of on top of it. It turned out great!

These were so delicious! I followed some of the suggestions - I mixed the blue cheese crumbles in with the meat, and used a little blue cheese dressing on the cooked burger along with tomato. My hubby raved about them! Very moist and full of flavor!

Changes I made: canned mushrooms, drained and squeezed dry with a tea towel, then diced; sauteed the onions; 1 T Worchestershire + 1 T soy; 1/8 t table salt; added blue cheese crumbles to the meat mixture; added a dash of egg whites (only because I had some I needed to use in the fridge); and cooked them on a cast iron griddle. They were excellent. I will definitely make them again.

Loved it. Mixed everything together and formed 4 large burger patties. Used stove top to sear then popped in oven at 325 for 15 minutes to finish cooking. Used worchestershire sauce to limit sodium and the cheese I had on hand was monterrey jack pepper jack. Yum yum.

Warning. Once you have turkey burgers this way, no other way is good enough. These were awesome. I didnt have onions so I used onion powder. And used Bragg amino acids because that's my go to soy sauce substitute. Other than that, followed recipe as written. It was juicy, flavorful and delicious.

I will try these again but so far, my impression is that these were okay - not bad, not extraordinary. My husband seemed to like them better than I did. I used all-white meat ground chicken b/c that was what was available at my butcher. Maybe this would be better with ground dark meat turkey or chicken - or beef. I'll try it with dark meat next time and see if I like it any better.

These were GREAT!  No one would ever know they were made with ground turkey. They stayed very moist and had a wonderful flavor. One of those items you would order in a restaurant and would say to yourself, these are really good, I wounder what's in them?  They were even better a few nights later when the leftover mix was used to make sliders, wow everyone thought they were better than the full burgers! If you haven't tried these you should.

Had some thawed ground turkey and was looking for something different to do with it and found this.  We loved it. I pretty much kept to the recipe, nothing major. I used red onion for the onion, used baby portabella mushrooms for the mushrooms.  After cutting up these two I took half and sauteed just a bit, just so I would have different textures in the burger. I also mixed the blue cheese into the meat mix and I pan fried them and didn't have any problems with them falling apart. I did 4 large burgers and cooked 7 mins on each side with out messing with them in between flips. Very juicy and flavorful.  It does have a dash more salt flavor than I prefer so next time I will lessen the salt added.

We liked everything, except for the blue cheese. The cheese just didn't match the other flavors - for us. We will make the burgers again, we will just omit the cheese next time. Thanks for the recipe!

Juicy burger bursting with wonderful flavor!  I added the bleu cheese right into the mix instead of putting it on top.
I also make them up and freeze them on a cookie sheet then wrap them up and freeze them individually to make a quick meal.
I may never eat a plain burger again!!
For anyone following Weight Watchers -these are 6 points+!

I love this recipe!  I don't eat beef and my husband sometimes regrets this because we eat a lot of chicken and turkey.  Fortunately, this recipe for gourmet burgers is a great change of pace for us.  Mark this as the first meal our entire family ate (including my six month-old).  Juicy, easy, great flavor.  The only alteration I made was I coated these in flour and slightly cooked them on a flat top before throwing on the grill to try and give them a crab cake-type texture.  So delicious!  Add as much cheese as you have or can fit on the burger :-)

I made this for my husband, kids, and sister. The kids wouldn't touch it but my husband and sister loved it. I told my sister what was in it and she was amazed she liked it despite not liking mushrooms or bleu cheese. I made the recipe almost exactly, except that I added minced garlic, added the bleu cheese to the turkey mixture before cooking, and cooked it on the stove top. My husband gives this recipe a thumbs up :)

Great Recipe!!!
I added minced garlic and put the blue cheese inside the burger and topped it off with another type of sliced cheese. Took it to a 5 star recipe.

Yummy, but the turkey meat doesn't pick up the flavorings of all the added ingedients...so it tasted a little flat compared to the other delicious ingredients. Adding ketchup gave them the missing flavor complexity though...all together that way, the burgers tasted delicious. Maybe if I let them sit for a while in the fridge they would develop the flavor depth...?

I have been making these for 3 years now and everyone that tries them continue to ask me to make them. I follow recipe as is but when I am mixing everything together, I add blue cheese crumbles to mixture to they are all mixed into burgers instead of just on top. I found the crumbles a bit difficult to keep in place and end up with the blue cheese all in my grill. I have only grilled these year round. Have never cooked on stove or in oven. Plain and simple, It is a very yummy burger that even the kids love.

Well, it turns out I don't like blue cheese.  It completely ruined the burger for me.  If you've never tried blue cheese before, I suggest you do before you make this recipe.  I mixed it with the meat and still could taste it in every bite.  Aside from that, I thought it was bland.  The chopped mushrooms was what cought my eye with this recipe (I love mushrooms) but you couldn't really taste them that much.  Everybody could tell it was a turkey burger too.  I will not be making this again, not even without the blue cheese.

Astonishingly good! They tasted so much like beef hamburgers. My husband knew we were having turkey burgers, but after the first bite he said, "Wait, what are these?" Then he said he was going to send the recipe to his dad and his boss! They were amazing (and every bit as good the next day!) I may never make beef burgers again!

Just made the wife an myself these extrordanary burgers....Awesome to  say the least. However,as  everyone does, I alterd the recipie, added a clove of garlic , and what would go better with a turkey burger than bacon?, no, I used smoked bacon grease instead of oil. Arteries hate me, tummie loves me!!!!!

These are terrific!  We used extremely sharp cheddar cheese instead of blue cheese (because we were out of blue cheese) and put it directly into the mix.  We also browned the onions before adding them to the turkey.  Everything was delicious.  I don't eat beef and am always looking for a new way to spruce up some turkey.  Thank you for the recipe.

This was great!  Quick and easy too.  Like some other reviews, we put the cheese in the meat mixture.  We didn't have blue cheese and used feta cheese instead - tasted just as good.

It's worth reading through some of the other reviews before making this.  Looks like it's hit or miss when it comes to turn out and taste.  Mine didn't turn out.  They turned into mush. I ended up adding at least 1/2c bread crumbs to the mixture as a binder so I could get them to form into patties.  I have no idea why that happened other than I used frozen, lean ground turkey.  Others mentioned problems when using frozen burger, but I've never had a problem using it in other recipes.  As far as taste, my husband absolutely loved them and said he could eat these everyday.  As for me, two bites and I was done.  My final note is regarding quantity.  This easily makes 6 large patties or 8 regular.  Making them into 4 is a little over kill on size.  Plus, they are difficult to manage on the grill.  I'm still giving this recipe a good rating because my husband liked them and we'll see what happens the next time I make them.

We loved these. I mixed in a half of cup of blue chees and tiny sprinkle fo cheese on top. I grilled the burgers and I will make these again and again! My six year old son said it was the best burger he ever had and they should serve them in happy meals. High compliments!

These were pretty good.  The actual burger with all the stuff in it it made HUGE burgers, a bit too big I'd say.  And as much as I LOVE blue cheese I didn't think it was right for the delicate flavor of the burgers, next time I'll try them without.

these are really good. I used the stovetop based on other reviewers and tried the frequent basting, they came out very juicy. I used swiss because that's all I had and it was very good. I think this will replace my other turkey burger recipe. The only thing I noticed was there was no heat recommendation. I used medium heat so they could cook longer without burning.

What a great alternative to traditional burgers!  I cooked mine on the George Foreman grill.  I stirred the blue cheese into the mixture, as well as serving on top.  I omitted the salt since there is plenty in the soy sauce.  Served with blue cheese, spinach and tomatoes on top.  I also tried these with just ketchup the next day with the leftovers - very good as well!

Surprisingly Awesome! I used ground turkey that was 85/15. Sauteed mushrooms and onion, used only 1 TBS of soy and 1/2 TBS of worcestershire. I probably used more than the recipe called for with the blue cheese. I did not add the salt. I brought these to a cook out - put them on a big flat skillet with tin foil covering the skillet and cooked them over an open flame. The trick to them not falling apart is to not turn them too much. Great flavor - I had brought ciabatta bread, mayo, tomato to go with them - everyone liked them better plain with no bread or condiments. Now I can see why a few reviewers said they made meatballs out of them.

I did as another poster suggested and cooked these on the stove, basting occassionally.  I used the entire container of blue cheese and mixed it in with the other ingrediants before cooking.  I also ran out of soy sauce and used one tablespoon of worcestershire sauce with one tablespoon of low-sodium soy sauce.  It was very good!

Normally I make my turkey burgers the same way that I make my beef burgers, but this turned out much better!

Delicious!!  I used 100% turkey breast, which is usually dry and tasteless.  Cut the recipe in half - made one on the George Foreman and one in a frying pan with a little oil.  Both were excellent.  The fry pan version was a little juicier, but the George Foreman version was way quicker to cook.  Not a blue cheese fan, so I used Sheep Feta cheese - mixed a little into the burger, and put a little on top.  Excellent flavor.

Yummy!  followed the directions to a T except I cooked them stove top - basting them as one person suggested.  My 3 year old even liked them!

The biggest thing with these is to make sure you really FINELY chop the onions and mushrooms. It makes a world of difference. This was my first time making a turkey burger of any kind (although I have eaten them before), and I can tell you that raw they look horrible and I was very worried. After grilling though they take on a nice color and look a lot better. My husband was really not looking forward to "turkey burgers" but he was pleasantly surprised also at the flavor of them.

Love these!  They are so moist and the flavor is better than a regular burger imo.  Will make them again and again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made these burgers on the George Foreman grill. Based on other reviews I would probably try this on the stovetop next time. Because of personal preference I would skip the soy sauce because it was very salty and overpowered the other flavors. I like the idea of the blue cheese on top though.

GREAT RECIPE! We loved it.  Next time I will make a blue cheese sauce instead of putting it straight on top. Decreased the mushrooms to half.  Also - this really isn't an ecomonical turkey burger.  Defeats the purpose of "cheap" burger if that is what you are going for.

This was a really good burger! Tastes great as written, but even better with a few adjustments - I took a hint from different turkey burger recipe and added 1 tsp of oil to the meat mixture (I chose to use EVOO). I also put the formed patties on plastic wrap and then into the freezer for about 10-15 min. before cooking, and I have never seen a turkey burger hold up so well! This is a very versatile recipe, and I'm about to email it to a bunch of people - Thanks for the post! ADDED NOTE: make these on the indoor grill (George Formen type). We have made these on the indoor and outdoor grill, and outdoor, they shrink away to nothing and dry out - indoors they are really moist and wonderful!

I made this recipe using a mix of blue cheese and feta crumbles just mixed in with the rest of the mixture and grilled on the George Forman. I also used canned mushrooms since I did not have the fresh on hand. Served on toasted sourdough bread. My family absolutely LOVED these burgers! Said they can't wait to have them again!

These were awesome - on the grill. Just flip once to keep them together. ANOTHER TIP: Most ground turkey comes in a 1-1/4 pound package. Scale the recipe to 5 servings to get the right ingredient amounts & mix VERY well. Then shape into 6 round balls, packing them tightly. Flatten slightly into thick disks and place gently on the hot grill. I have made these several times this way and have not had a problem. I always mix in the blue cheese. Love these more than hamburgers!

These burgers are better than any other burger I have ever served my family.  I left out the blue cheese and grilled them in a pan, which holds them together better then on the grill.  I used the fresh mushrooms and not canned also.  Simply terrific recipe.  I make all the time for my family.

It was good but I didn't really like the soy sauce taste that much.  I think I am going to try Bar-b-Que sauce next time in place of the soy sauce.

I took recommendations from other reviewers and sauteed the onion and mushrooms then mixing all ingredients together. I used a steak seasoning instead of salt and pepper. The ground turkey I used was a mixture of light and dark meat. We then grilled them on our Big Green Egg and they were moist and fabulous! We definitely will make these again soon!

I eliminated the added salt, used reduced salt soy sauce...and it STILL was too salty. Next time I'll try one tablespoon of soy sauce and one of water.  Other than that it was good...I also added the cheese to the mixture, and I used FETA!!! Red onion, Shitake and Portabella mushrooms with garlic powder and pepper made up the rest.

It's important to prep your food before you mix it all together. So when you do mix the turkey burger it sticks together. I would even let it sit in the fridge for 30-45 mins to let it set. I went light on the onions and heavy on the blue cheese.

VERY tasty! I did add a couple more spices for zest: garlic and rosemary. I mixed it all in my Cusniart before adding the meat, including the blue cheese. Very yummy, even my 2 1/2 year old liked it!

Three star rating 'cause I hated and hubby liked em. I would use less mushroom as this caused the mix to be wet. I would also eliminate the soya sauce as it doesn't do anything to compliment the receipe.

YUMMY! Excellent for Turkey Burgers. I got a little long on the mushroom chopping  in my food processor so my mushrooms and onions came out more like a puree. I added some garlic (everything is just better with it) and i din't have crumbled blue cheese so I added some BC dressing to the mix. Needless to say, they were somewhat gushy to make into patties. To keep them from falling into the grill, I cooked them with foil on the grate until the liquid was cooked out and then browned them on the rack right over the coals. I added the blue cheese dressing on top with a whole wheat roll and they were awesome!

I needed something to serve at our cookout to our friend who doesn't eat red meat.  So I found this recipe, we all loved it.  I do not care for blue cheese so I used feta instead and it is delicious.  The burgers are so moist.  My husband has been craving these burgers all winter, he can't wait to have them tomorrow for Father's Day.

This was a very good recipe, though we added more blue cheese and some dried mustard to the mix.  The mushrooms are an excellent idea as they keep these from being dry, as turkey burgers tend to be.  My sister made blue cheese burgers that I never got to try because I don't eat red meat, but she says these are just as good!  I'm going to use mushrooms in ground turkey to try to make other types of burgers without using beef.  Thank you Trish!

You would never guess this is a turkey burger. Very Juicy and tasteful. I'm not sure if I wasnt careful in adding the soy sauce or what, but I found it to be a tad powerful. Definitely a keeper, but I will tweek maybe next time.

This was really good. My wife doesn't love onions so will cut those back a little next time otherwise no complaints. Used breadcrumbs to help keep the patties together as well in the mixture.

I made these as written, except I added a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce. They turned out moist but a little short on flavor. I used portobello mushrooms and chopped fine in the processor. Overall a great turkey burger that I‚Äôll make again!

Fabulous turkey burger! Juicy and delicious! I followed the recipe exactly except instead of crumbled blue cheese we used blue cheese dressing as a condiment. This will be my go to turkey burger recipe base, changing the toppings as we please.

Decided to saute some colorful bell peppers with the leftover mushrooms then place the cooked burgers in the skillet with them and let them simmer for about 10-15 minutes...yum! Have also used the recipe to stuff bell peppers and to make a turkey meatloaf!

I made this but split the mix between 1/2 turkey and 1/2 beef burgers. Both were amazing! I don't eat beef but my family who aren't into turkey burgers said that the beef ones were super moist and tasty. That's exactly what I thought of the turkey burgers. It's funny that you can't actually taste the individual ingredients it just became a more tangy and yet rich. Everyone said it was a recipe to keep. Only substitution was to use Gorgonzola instead of blue just because it's what I had and believe I did it exactly as described.

I really wish I had the blue cheese to go with this recipe, but we used the cheddar we had in the fridge. They came out great. We topped it with a sliced tomato.  Good recipe!

I made this exactly as written with the exception of adding the blue cheese into the turkey mixture before making into patties.  Grilled them on my gas outdoor grill.  AMAZING turkey burgers!!! We will make these often.  Thank you for sharing this exceptional recipe!!!!

Finally a turkey burger that made my husband's hit list! Cooked them in a cast iron skillet and they didn't fall apart or need any additional basting - were juicy enough.  Only thing I'll change next time is to eliminate the added salt. The soy sauce and blue cheese add plenty. I also think splitting it into 5 burgers would make for reasonable servings on the standard size burger bun. Excellent recipe!

Made these burgers last night and they are a hit! Like many, I added the blue cheese to the burger mixture before cooking on a Foreman grill. I also added about 1 tablespoon of minced garlic, substituted seasoning salt for the kosher salt, and added one full minced apple (Gala) to my mixture. Delicious!

Overall a good recipe. Worked better by saut√©ing veggies a little first and adding cheese directly to mixture. Also added a 1/2 cup bell pepper and 1 cup of grated carrots. My fam didn't like the blue cheese so next time I'll use feta or sharp cheddar.

Absolutely awsome! I probably added more chopped mushrooms than the recipe stated, but it only added.  Had a couple of burgers left over and nibbled on them while they were cold-excellent!

I used lean ground turkey, low sodium soy sauce, and reduced fat bleu cheese to make this a little healthier. The flavor was amazing otherwise, as-is (according to the directions exactly). So delicious and so easy.

I used ground beef, and did not have any fresh or canned mushrooms. Did add sun-dried tomatoes, and the feta cheese went into the mix. Grilled over high heat 10 minutes per side, and probably it would have been fine if I had only cooked it for maybe 8 minutes once I turned them over. Went onto the bun with only a few leaves of spinach from my garden, and it was scrumptious.

We had these tonight, I only had half a lb of ground turkey, so i adjusted the other ingredients to that.  I also sauteed onions before adding them since the onions i had were STRONG. Even my husband who hates mushroom AND blue cheese loved it! Great recipe!

My husband I really liked these, and I'm giving it 5 stars because my 7 and 10 yr old ate them, too!  We left the blue cheese off of the girls' burgers, but we added it to ours.  Very tasty.  I used portabello mushrooms, bc/ they were on sale.  I minced them in the food processor, to make them small.  I followed the recipe, except for the addition of onion, which I don't like.  I added a tsp of onion powder, instead.  I plan to make this one, again.

Yes, toasting the buns is a must with this burger. It was bland, and had the texture of a mushy veggie burger. Doctored up with lettuce, & tomato is wasn't too bad but I won't be making these again.

I made these burgers tonight for company and they were a big hit!  Per the recommendation of the other reviewers, I added the bleu cheese to the burger mix.  Enjoy!

I made these on the stove.  One bite and my husband cried out, "These are the best burgers you've ever made!" That's saying something because I'm a darn good cook.  I was unsure of the blue cheese.  But this burger is heavenly.  Also, I made a spread of mayo, black pepper and fresh dill.  Add thin slices of tomato and that's all you need. (Oh, I used an onion bread bun lightly toasted.)

These are fabulous!  I coarsely cut the onion and mushrooms into my mini-chopper to chop them very finely.  Mixed everything together, including the cheese, and pan-grilled on the stove.  Heaven!  I even mixed some with a new cheese I'd found that tasted like a feta-parmesan combo instead of the blue cheese and they were great, too.  I have found that I prefer them without the added kosher salt -- the cheese and soy sauce seem plenty salty.  Best burgers ever!  Thanks so much, Trish!

This was pretty fantastic.  Although 8 ounces of mushrooms seemed like a bit much, even for us mushroom lovers.  So I cut that in half.

These burgers were excellent! I used about a 1/2 cup of blue cheese and used in the mix instead of as a topping. The flavor was rich but I'm sure it's because of the increased blue cheese. Either way, they were delicious! I cooked on the stove since the burners are out on our grill.  My husband loved this and said it's one of his favorite dinners I've made. Served with zucchini sauteed in light olive oil.

These were yummy. The only changes I made were to use a salt with other seasonings in it and I made 8 patties and then put the cheese on one and sealed up the edges. That way I'd have a  pocket of gooey cheese. I cooked on stove top grill pan. I think thy could have used a bit mroe seasoning so next time I'll bump that up

These are phenomenal! My one year old, three year old and I all love them. I've tried them out on several friends and family too and everyone has been full of praise.  I have started using slightly less than 8oz of mushroom and less than a full large onion because I found them falling apart. I only decrease the amounts by a small bit because the taste is so good.   I omit the salt and use low sodium soy sauce and they are still a hit with everyone - salties and non-salties alike!

I would personally rate these a 2, but my mother thought they were pretty good. I found the soy sauce overpowering. I used a very high quality soy sauce and I think that worked against me, rather than for me - the taste was VERY strong. I will try them again and use 1 tbsp instead of 2.

I recommend adding the blue cheese to the patties before cooking.  I cooked them on the stove top over medium heat for about 4 minutes per side. Despite them patties nearly falling apart, the results were great.  I only used a touch of Dijon mustard as condiments aren't really needed for these burgers.  I will definitely make these again.

I made this tonight and they were to die for.  My 3 year old immediately said they were the best burgers ever.  I cooked them on the stovetop and forgot to add the blue cheese before hand, as recommended, so added at the end.  Used American cheese for my kids which was equally as good. Thanks for a great recipe!

Easy prep, very moist and flavorful! Cooked on Foreman grill for 7 minutes per side, grill open so it doesn't dry them out ... great to munch on cold the next day, too!

Our  was very moist. We ended up having to cook it in the oven because we were afraid it was not going to stay on the grill. We also mixed in the blue cheese in the mixture before we cooked it. As for taste...my roommate does NOT like mushrooms. He tried a small amount and he went back for more. They are really good. I made some large patties and some small meatball size for more snacking. Overall really good. Will make it again.

These were the absolutely the best turkey burgers I have ever tried.  They are so moist and the flavor is wonderful.  I have actually made them without the cheese to lower the calories and they were still wonderful.  This is a keeper!!!

This is one of my favorites. The only thing I do differently is I chop up olives to put in with the mushrooms instead of the onion (personal taste) and I add some hotsauce. Sometimes I will put half feta half blue cheese

I made these burgers to test out my newly remodelled kitchen and was NOT disappointed! The flavor was bold, without being overpowering, and the patties were moist and tasty. I was stumped as to what to serve on as a side-dish. This recipe is definitely a keeper and next time I plan to make the meat into mini meatballs and serve it on a bed of mashed potatoes.

This recipe was excellent! I made one change and sauteed the mushrooms in a small amount of oil instead of adding them raw. I also pan fried them since it is winter and the grill was unavailable. I would recommend these any day!

I've been using ground turkey instead of beef for quite awhile now.  Even my meat-freak husband admits it's hard to tell the difference.  Here in Ohio it's cheaper too-  you can get a pound of frozen ground turkey at Aldi's for $1.25 and it's of good quality.  I've been doing a recipe like this, but I add about three tbsp of horseradish (not the creamy horseradish) per Lb of turkey and a splash of worchestershire sauce.

This was the best turkey burger I have ever had!  I put the blue cheese on top of the burger as the recipe calls for but next time I will use another type of cheese.  The blue cheese was way too strong and it took away the rest of the flavor.

Absolutely delicious. The BEST turkey burger I have ever tasted. 

I used 1/2 cup of blue cheese crumbles before that's how much was in the pack I bought and just mixed in with the rest of the ingredients.

I've made this recipe several times. I have tried it with regular white mushrooms, but I think the flavor is better with criminis (baby portobella).

Favorite turkey burger recipe ever!  Every time I order a turkey burger in a restaurant and I bite into a dry, tasteless burger, I want to send them to this website.  Typically we serve on toasted wheat buns with the blue cheese crumbled on top.  No other condiments needed.  One time we made a small hole in the meat and put the blue cheese inside then formed the patty around it so the burgers had a small blue cheese center.  I do not recommend mixing the cheese in like others have - I think it masks the great taste of these burgers.  Who needs beef when this is so good?

More like 3 1/2 stars. These were good for a quick weeknight meal. The kids didn't really like them.  I will make again but probably won't make often.

This was good but I found the blue cheese overpowering - prefer the Spicy Turkey Burgers from this site.

WOW! AWESOME! I doubled the recipe, mixed 5 oz blue cheese into patties, and omitted salt. I was able to make 10 large patties. Can't wait to have them again!!! **Have made these lots and they are always a favorite!. My kids like feta better so I have substituted that and they are also yummy!

This recipe definately jazzed up Turkey Burgers, but it was a little too salty for my taste and I love to have lots seasonings.  Maybe it is the soy sauce???  I think if I were to try this recipe again, I would skip the soy sauce.

So delicious! I added a bit more blue cheese (1/2 cup maybe) into the mix just as some others did, but I am not really sure it needed it, as its a very strong flavor. I was a little bit worried about how much mushroom goes into them, but they really shrink up when cooked. The onions and mushrooms make these burgers so moist and tender. I will definitely make these again, and soon!

I put the blue cheese into the burger mixture.  It aids flavor and is less messy.

I would make again, very moist. I how ever added a little more blue cheese then recipe called for, and I added a tad too much. Be patient for the browning if using a grill pan. Somehow I misplaced my George Forman grill, so I had to use my grill pan,let it cook the 10 minues on the 1st side to get that "crust".

Partner, a very picky eater loved it! Followed some of the suggestions: less onion, grilled veggies. I also added grilled orange bell peppers to the burgers.

These burgers just didn't work for me. They were so dry and the blue cheese was really overpowering. I followed the recipe to a T, but it was a flop! We love blue cheese and turkey but not in this recipe..............

I made these burgers for my husband on our honeymoon. He thought they were fantastic! I really liked them but I think next time I'll try a few things differently. I added a clove of garlic, but next time I'll decrease the amount of onions and saute the onions, mushrooms, and garlic, as a few of the other readers already suggested. I also increased the amount of bleu cheese...you can't have too much of that!

Oh my gosh!  I didn't think ANYthing would make me like a turker burger but this recipe proved me wrong.  Thanks so much, Trish!  I used a little less than 3 oz of gorgonzola and mixed it into the burgers. The taste was a little strong for me and then I realized that 1/4 cup is NOT the same as 4 oz.  DUH! The mushrooms keep the burgers so moist and delicious!  I served these w/Tea Biscuits & Sweet Restaurant Slaw (both recipes on this site) and sliced tomatoes.  It was a perfect meal!

These were fabulous!  I added a bit more blue cheese and then served them on rolls with a tiny amount of mayo and some hot wing sauce...SO yummy!  I cooked them on a flat pancake griddle that covers two burners so I was able to make all four patties in one batch.  Quick and delicious!  Thanks so much!

This is an exceptional turkey burger recipe.  I did as others recommended and mixed the blue cheese in with the ground turkey.  It was reduced fat blue cheese and made no difference in the taste.  We topped them off with fresh spinach and a drizzling of homemade buffalo sauce.  The burgers turned out so tasty and moist.  This is my hubby's new favorite recipe.  We will be making these often!

I did change a couple things in this recipe.  I used hamburger and only 2 whole slices of onion instead of a whole one.  I thought a whole onion would take over the other flavors.  I used Feta instead of Blue Cheese only because that was all I had.  I'm sure the Blue Cheese is just as good!  I may have used about a 1/2 cup of the Feta too.  I too mixed all the ingredients together and then grilled them.  I would definately make these again. My family really enjoyed them. I think mixing the mushrooms in the hamburger really kept them moist.

Excellent burgers! I halved the recipe to make two burgers and followed other reviewers advice to add the blue cheese into the mix. About 1/2 cup of cheese and 1/2 cup diced onion. Along with the other ingredients in the recipe, I added just a bit of diced jalapeno (1 inch), a few dashes of cayenne, and 1.5 tsp of minced garlic. I cooked the burgers up in a skillet after they set in the fridge for about 1 hour and served with wheat buns, mayo, lettuce, and tomato. Very yummy! Will definitely make again. Just a note: the first time I made these according to recipe they were far too oniony and not too special, but when tweaked to personal taste it came out great! My husband who does not like blue cheese ate these right up. I highly recommend this recipe.

I didn't use the mushroom, and I used marinated blue cheese crumbles.  I also mixed the cheese into the meat, as others have done.  This is a very tasty burger indeed. I will make again.

This recipe was ok.  It needs some work.  I followed it to the "T" and the burgers fell apart on the grill, even though I mixed them well and oiled the grate before I put them on it.  Second, the blue cheese overwhelms any flavor in the burgers - too much blue cheese.  We ended up putting a lot of mustard on the bun to mask some of the blue cheese flavor.  And that's saying something, since I LOVE blue cheese!

These were very yummy and suprisingly incredibly moist.  I steamed the onions a bit before mixing with the meat just so they definaley wouldn't be crunchy when you bit into the burger.  I also made them on the stove rather than the grill and added some garlic, Montreal Steak seasoning and mixed a bit of the bleu cheese crumbles into the meat as well as melting some on top. I made these for dinner last night and froze the patties that I didn't heat up and my husband is already asking when we're going to have them for dinner!!  And he's typically a beef eater!  Yum!!

We thought these were very tasty.  I mixed the blue cheese into the mixture and I think I could serve them without anyone knowing what the tang was.  Next time I'll try them with a blue cheese dressing on top that's like thousand island dressing with blue chees added.

I substituted Feta cheese for the Bleu, simply because that's what I had on hand.  I thought the burgers might come out too salty so I also omitted the salt. I thought they were very tasty and moist (grilled on the bbq) My husband was "just OK" with the flavor, probably because he prefers a burger made with red meat.  Next time will saute extra mushrooms for on top.

These were the best turkey burgers we've ever had!  I was worried that is was a LOT of mushrooms but you couldn't even tell when they were cooked.  I'm not a fan of blue cheese so I used feta and it was great.  The burgers were a little mushy and very moist after making into patties so I put them in the freezer for 15 min. and they grilled up perfectly!  We will make these time and time again!  My husband even loved them and he is a BEEF BOY!

Not sensational, but might make again.  If I do make it again, I think I will decrease the mushrooms, increase the cheese and increase the soy sauce.  Also, I left out the onions.

This has become our go-to recipe for Turkey Burgers.  We usually skip the blue cheese and top them with whatever we feel like.  Delicious!!

After reading all the positive reviews, my husband and I had high hopes for these burgers.  I followed the recipe as written, except for including the blue cheese in the turkey mixture instead of on top.  Unfortunately, we were disappointed.  Maybe our hopes were too high after reading the reviews, but we found these to be slightly dry and nothing special.  We both put blue cheese dressing on top of our burger as well, and they still were not what we were hoping for.  My husband also commented that he had some trouble keeping them from falling apart on the grill.  These weren't awful, just not our preference, I guess.  We're going back to beef!

My husband and kids loved this recipe.  My son swears he doesn't like onions but ate this burger up like it was his last meal.  Thanks so much for listing it.  We'll enjoy this recipe again. (p.s. I don't like mushrooms so left them out of mine and it was excellent too).

I was so surprised at this recipe. Such common, simple ingredients but so flavorful and juicy! Great way to serve ground turkey. I bet it's really good with blue cheese, as I only had a tiny bit (about an ounce) of feta, and mixed it right into the meat. Also, I just pan fried them, as I'm lacking a BBQ and it was delicious. Thanks much for the recipe.

We really enjoyed this recipe, the burgers were lovely and moist.   I fried the burgers because it was pouring rain outside and we did not feel like going outside and putting them on the grill.   I did as others had done and put the blue cheese in the mixture.  I also poured a little blue cheese dressing on top after cooking.   Very good, thank you.

This is the best turkey burger that I've tried, but it is still a turkey burger to me.  I think I'll give up on ground turkey.  I just don't like it, and there is just not that much difference in fat using superlean ground beef.  I will try this recipe again with the beef--loved the mushrooms and bleu cheese.

Excellent recipe for turkey burgers. I left out the cheese because my husband doesn't like it and it was still delicious. I did use a bit more soy sauce the second time around and I liked it better as the flavor was a bit more distinctive.

This recipe sounds very good, but needs just a little help.
Using turkey or ground beef, see what changes I have made, for very sweet, and juicy burgers!

1 1/2       pounds  extra lean ground beef
 1          package  hamburger buns
 1          can  pineapple rings in juice
 1          package  bleu cheese, crumbled
 2          medium  onions -- sliced 1/8" thick
 1          can  mushrooms -- sliced
 1          bottle  barbecue sauce
 2          teaspoons  cooking oil

Slice onions 1/8" thick, then seperate into onion rings. set aside.
Form the ground beef into 1/3 pound hamburger patties.
Grill patties on an outside bbq grill till well done. Add spices and bbq sauce to taste.
While burgers are grilling, Saut√© in a non-stick skillet in a very little oil the pineapple rings, the onion rings, and mushrooms. Turn or stir to Saut√© all sides.
During the last two minutes of grilling meat, warm buns, and add 1-2 Tbs. crumbled bleu cheese to the top of each meat patty and allow cheese to melt slightly.
When burgers are done, and fruit and vegetables are done, add your normal condiments (mustard...) to buns, but no cheese.
Then place grilled onions and mushrooms on bottom half of bun.
Next place a blue cheese covered hamburger patty on top of the onions and mushrooms.
Next add the pineapple ring on top of meat, then place top part of bun on your creation.
Enjoy
Sawman
