I had this dish last night.  It was very easy to prepare and the taste was very good. I do intend to have it again, however I think the next time I will not put as much dry mustard in the recipe.  It made the taste too spicy.  Halibut is a very flavorful fish on its own and if it has too much spicy taste, it takes away from the true taste of the fish.  I concur with the reviews that I read that said not to use the amount of dry mustard that was in the instructions but I didn't know if that would take away from the flavor.  NOW I AM A BELIEVER. That's why it is so nice to be able to read opinions of people who have already tried the recipes.

I was VERY skeptical because of the sour cream ~ halibut is practically a delicacy since we get it so rarely around here ~ I hate to waste it BUT this turned out great.  I used a couple more TBLS of parm. chese and half the french fried onions ~this turned out great.

I really liked this dish and my husband just loved it. Perhaps the previous reviewer just got some bad halibut to start with if it tasted fishy. I would definitely make this again. The only thing I would do differently is to use a bit less dry mustard.

Made this dish the other evening and I have to say I was surprised. It was absolutely delicious and will definitely be having it again. It was very simple to prepare and as i said  very delicious.I read a couple of reviews before making it and the only alteration to the recipe was instead of 3 tablespoons of dry mustard i only used 2 teaspoons, This recipe is a "must try" and comes highly recommended so give it a try and enjoy.

This recipe would move from ** to **** with 1 1/2 T Dry Mustard rather than 3 T. It is definitely a keeper.

I gave this five stars and I don't really like fish. I made this because my wife loves halibut. I made this exactly like the recipe says and it was REALLY good. It tasted like a meal at a fancy restaurant.

Excellent! Excellent! Excellent! So easy and so yummy. I will make this for years.  Elegant and classy.  Great for guests. The one reviewer that thought it was "too fishy"- it was definitely their fish.  
My thoughts and prayers are with everyone in New Orleans.  Please donate and help!

Not a winner with us. I reduced the mustard and skipped the fried onions altogether.  Also used light ingredients.  Mine came out with 2 totally different layers. The sour cream on top and a ton of liquid almost boiling the fish underneath.  It was weird. Won't be a repeat in our house. I prefer the Heavenly Halibut receipe we use or using the Lemon Steamed Fish Packets receipe (both posted here).

This recipe calls for 3 Tablespoons of Dry Mustard, as the other reviews suggested, I cut back on the amount but not enough.  One Teaspoon (not tablespoon) of dry mustard is adequate (and I do like mustard).  I used fresh halibut that my son caught on an Alaskan fishing trip and followed the recipe as written with two exceptions:  The mustard quantity and I used fat free sour cream (which I always cook with) - outside of the overwhelming mustard flavor, the only other complaint with the recipe is the cooking time.  It does take a little longer to bake than what is allotted.  I bake in a convection oven and the pieces on the outside of the dish were warm and the center still barely above room temp.  I baked a little longer, but still found the fish not to be quite done - it should flake with a fork.  Remembering a lesson previously learned from a chef when broiling halibut filets, I put this dish in the microwave for a minute, checked it and then one more minute, until the fish was done.  If you find you need a little more time when fixing this recipe, try the microwave method just to finish cooking, but be sure not to overcook any fish as it will be dry/rubbery.  Overall, with the modifications this has potential to be a good recipe.

They don't sell French's Fried Onions in Canada...so I made some myself using another recipe on the site. This stuff is AWESOME, and a great way to use fresh halibut -for the price it goes at, anyways- we will be making this again...try adding extra cheese :)

Outstanding!  I did as other suggested, and decreased the dry mustard. The only other change I made was to use panko rather than the fried onion rings, just because I discovered my last can had been used! My boyfriend is usually the one who cooks fish for us, and he raved about this dish.  Thank you!

I love this recipe, but make sure you don't put to much mustard if you are not a big mustard fan.  Overwise this recipe rocks!

The overall flavor was good; however, I feel that you can find a tastier way to prepare halibut.  In my opinion the dry mustard did not overpower the fish.  On the other hand, this recipe calls for too much sour cream and that makes for a rich and slightly heavy sauce that detracts from the delicateness of halibut.  I tried making my own french fried onions - soaked in milk, dredged in flour and then pan fried with a little canola oil... I think this helped.  One note on the cooking time - mine bake for 35 minutes in a covered enamel french oven and needed every bit of that time to fully cook.  This recipe was worth trying once, but to me the price of fresh halibut is too expensive and the results of this recipe too underwhelming to want to give it another go.

Ok, this is AWESOME! I also only used 2 tbls of mustard. I used an electronic thermomater which I think you need because it took more like 25 minutes. i used cheddar flavored onions, too. My husband said it's my best meal ever!!!!! Thank you for sharing!

I didn't care for the flavors in this dish at all.  I don't know if there was too much dry mustard or what.  I won't make this again.

I should have read the reviews. This was far too mustardy. To counteract the mustardy taste, I poured some chilli sauce over top of the sour cream and cheese and then topped with breadcrumbs to change the taste of the sauce. I served this with minted peas and mashed potatoes, and the sauce went really well when mixed in with the potatoes. It was really good this way! I think if I make this again  would definately only use 1tbsp mustard and use my chilli sauce topping too.

Whoa, this recipe is like an exercise to see how much fat you can put atop some fish. Therefore, of course it's delicious! I took heed of fellow reviewers and only used 1 tablespoon of dry mustard. I think I could have added another 1/2 and it would have still worked. I think the full amount would end up bitter though. The whole family loved it. "This can't be good for us" my husband exclaimed and the 4 year old had seconds. I was lucky enough to get to lick the serving spoon clean after scraping the pan. Naughty, but darn good.

I felt that even with half the mustard, the mustard taste was WAY overpowering.  If you do not love mustard, don't try this recipe.

Yes, believe what you read...less mustard.  I made the mistake of reading the reviews AFTER I made the dish...  As I was adding the mustard, I was thinking "Wow this is a lot."  My kids wouldn't touch it, but with only 1T I bet they would have gobbled it down.  Even too much for us parents, and we love spicy food!

I used 2T of dry mustard and though 1.5T would've allowed the halibut flavor show through more, I still think it delicious.  This is obvious, but if you can't eat it immediately out of the oven, then add the french onions later when you reheat.  So good.  Other minor changes:  more cheese and only enough sour cream to cover the fish.  I "tasted" more than I meant to.

I wish I had read the reviews first.  3 tbsp seemed like a lot of mustard, but I always try to make a recipe as written the first time.  I think that 1 tbsp (3 tsp) would be better.  20-25 minutes @ 350F cooked it well.  It's not bad, but is very mustard-y.

Tried this last night and concur with the reviews that mention too much mustard. Way too much. Also didn't like the consistency of the dish with the sour cream. Won't make this again.

This is a great way to make "plain old fish" taste different and elegant (my first criteria in a fish recipe!).  Even my guests love it!  I made as-written, using Hawaiian Opa or Ono, good with Mahi Mahi also.

Used only 1 T. of mustard, and cooked a little longer. Made it with Flounder for the first time. Will be making this again, and again. Loved it!!!!!

My family really liked this dish.  We normally grill all of the fish we eat.  This was a nice change.

Yummy. I used twice the cheese, half the butter, a little less oil, and less mustard (1 TSP). I served it with mashed potatoes and broccoli; the sauce was really yummy on the potatoes!  Will make again.

Love, love, love this!  We live in some of the best halibut catching waters in the world, so are always looking for new ways to eat halibut.  I try not to change recipes until I've tried them at least once, but I didn't have any dry mustard, so I used 1 tablespoon Old Bay instead.  My husband said this was his favorite halibut recipe EVER!

It was SUPER runny, which I didn't expect, but everyone thought it was delicious!  I took the advice of everyone and I used half the dry mustard.  I doubled the recipe and it was a big hit.

This was very good. Per other reviewers, I only used 2 tbs mustard (my husband thought could have used less but I liked it this way) and only a few tbs of sour cream. Also, instead of cutting up the halibut, I used the full fillet for a prettier presentation. Didn't have the fried onions... so I made onion rings instead.

I was looking for fish recipes that can be adjusted to lower cholesterol and salt.  I omitted the salt, butter  and used light sour cream.  Because of the previous comments I used the 3Tbs of mustard but twice the fish (I didn't increase the oil either).  The mustard was just enough for the amount of fish (2 Lbs Scrod).  Increase cooking time to 30 minutes if you increase the fish to 2 lbs.  Although adjusted for our requirements, guess what!  It was a delicious recipe for two boomers that need to do what our Dr's tell us.

Yes you do need to cut way back on the mustard.  Used 1/3 of what was stated.  This was okay, nothing special.  I will stick to my Halibut Olympia recipe.  Not a repeat

Very good.  I took the advice from some other reviews and reduced the dry mustard to 1-1/2T.  My husband even loved it and he's picky about fish.  I'm guessing this would be good with any mild, white fish.

I thought this was alright, but I couldn't get my husband to eat more than a few bites.  This also did not do well reheated as leftovers.  I don't think I'll make this again.

Very easy and elegant.  Served it for a dinner party and got rave reviews.  Just the right amount of sweet, savory and acidity.  I did add more salt and pepper, but that's just personal taste. Otherwise, this was perfect as is and I don't say that about many recipes.

I was surprised at how good this was. I wound up using half dry mustard and half Dijon - all I had - but the result was really, really good. My one complaint is that the recipe itself has such bold flavor that it seemed a shame to waste it on fish that's $11/lb, when it would have been just as good with cod or some other $3/lb fish. Lesson learned for next time, I guess.

Sorry, but this was not good for us at all.  I followed the recipe exactly except for 2 things that should not have affected the final outcome - 1 tbs of dry mustard and used Tilapia, a very mild white fish. I reduced the dry mustard to 1 TBS and it was still too strong. I baked for nearly 30 minutes and the fish was still not done, had to nuke it to completely cook it thru. The olive oil/butter floated to the top so it looked a little greasy too.  Sorry, won't be making this again.

As written, this recipe gets a three or a four star rating...too much mustard as others have stated. We don't care for dry mustard in large quantities, so I really reduce the amount to fit our tastes, when I make this. Using only a couple of tsps. Yes, this recipe is not for the calorie or fat conscience, but it's delicious. No fish should taste fishy. If it does, you have purchased bad fish. I live in Western Washington on an island in Puget Sound, and fresh fish is abundant here. Lucky me! If you don't know how to determine if fish is fresh, first use your nose before you purchase. It will tell you right away if it's fresh. Second, use your eyes. Don't always depend upon the fishmonger to be honest with you. Read up on how to choose fresh fish, cut the mustard, and this dish won't disappoint.

My husband didn't like this at all.  He said it tasted "too fishy."  I had to agree.  I have cooked halibut many times without the overwhelming fishy taste, but this recipe didn't accomplish that.
