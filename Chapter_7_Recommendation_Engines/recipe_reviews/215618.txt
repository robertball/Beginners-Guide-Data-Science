This bread is absolutely delicious! I used fresh basil (triple the amount) since I have a seemingly endless supply in the garden. I otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I did have to add in at least an extra cup of flour during kneading. The recipe makes two LARGE loaves. My husband and oldest son loved this one. Thanks for sharing!

I love herbed breads, so this recipe appealed to me. The mozzarella was just icing on the cake. I followed the recipe except for using 50/50 whole wheat and all purpose, so I added in some vital gluten. I did not add the salt directly to the yeast proofing solution, as that would have diminished the action of the yeast. Like Pam, I needed to add significantly more flour to obtain a workable dough - 2 cups more, in fact. It almost became too much for my stand mixer to handle kneading. I would have cut the recipe in half had it actually called for closer to that 6 cups of flour rather than just 4. There is a big difference between '4 cups or as needed' and 6 cups. I got two very large round loaves from this recipe. I found the flavor from the basil and cheese subtle, but pleasant, and the texture was beautiful. Thank you for sharing the recipe.

This made an impressive, large loaf of bread with an excellent texture inside.  The mozzarella made the loaf smell wonderful coming out of the oven.  I made a half recipe and used almost 3 cups of flour.

if i could give this recipe 100 stars i would!!i have made this bread at least 20 times and everytime it wows me..whenever i go to dinner at someone's house or have dinnerguests i bring/serve this bread and everyone is always amazed that i made this and didn't buy it at some fancy bakery!! the only thing i do differently is slice it lengthwise instead of in wedges, but this recipe is foolproof and needs no alteration..this bread also makes very good sandwiches spread with mayo and topped with sliced vine tomatoes and mozza cheese and put under the broiler!! the only negative i can say is that i need to buy bigger pants to fit my expanding waistline, as i could eat a whole loaf to myself in a day!!

This is a great recipe, but I caution that the flour to liquid ratio listed is off.  I ended up using six cups of flour to mix and another half cup while I was kneeding to get to the right consistency.  I put all ingedients except the mozzarella and basil into my bread machine and processed on the dough cycle.  During the final mix I added the cheese and basil (fresh from the garden).  I upped the cheese to almost two cups, but for some reason didn't up the total amount of basil used - I should have.  I was a little leary of the baking temperature, but it was fine.  I tented after about 10 minutes to keep the tops from getting too dark.  This bread has a delicious flavor and I will be making again.  Thanks so much for sharing!

I read all reviews about the addtional flour.  Being in a warmish and humid part of the world, I tried out half of the recipe with 3/4 cup water, 2 cups of bread flour as a start, threw in a tablespoon of minced garlic and follow the rest of the instructions.  During the kneading, I added another 1/3 cup of flour to get a more workable dough.   I shaped them into 2 small loafs.  The bread came out wonderful and aromatic, moist and flavourful.  I served them with the Cream of Mushroom Soup I from this site.  My kids and hubby raved over it.   I gave it 4.5 stars because the flour to water proportion is off, otherwise, it is an easy and crowd pleasing recipe.

This makes two ENORMOUS loaves of bread...which is wonderful! Like the other reviewers, I also found the amount of flour to be way off. I used almost 6 cups. Texture and flavor are wonderful- will make again for sure.

This is really ,really GOOD bread! It smells so good baking!! It would be a great accompaniment for anything Italian, or a good soup too. We are loving this bread, I hope I have some left to serve with dinner, luckily this recipe makes 2 large loaves!

Easy to make. I halved the recipe because I didn't want too much left over. Next time, I would add some garlic powder to intensify the flavour, and maybe brush the top with butter when I take it out of the oven. It was a lovely loaf, though, and went really well with our tortellini soup. Thanks!

The portions of this recipe are WAY off (but it is still awesome)! I had to use *6* cups of flour! But that's an easy fix. That said this is a very tasty bread, the cheese and milk give the dough a moist and creamy flavor. I added a little extra basil, just because I had so much left over that I froze from my garden. It's a keeper.

Delicious!  Easy to make too, especially if you have a KitchenAid mixer with the kneading accessory.  My yeast didn't do as well as I like, but that was my fault, NOT the recipe!  If you like flavorful bread, try it.  I am sure you won't be disappointed.

I baked this bread last night and didn't have any basil so I used Italian Seasoning instead and it turned out great. Made 2 loaves and we ate one loaf as soon as it came out of the oven. I think next time i make it I'm going to add more cheese and try out different spices. Would make a great garlic bread for spagetti. Definitly a keeper.

Fabulous, easy, cheesy bread.  This was so easy to prepare and smelled great while baking.  But is tastes so good. I am glad I read reviews before making this as I cut the recipe in half, using 4 cups of flour and getting 2 decent sized loaves of bread. This was good with our lasagna, and still good the next night with our soup.  Definitely making this one again.

Excellent!  Easy to make.  Gobbled this up in one meal with family.  We are already making this again because the family was craving.  Used fresh herb the first time, will try dry this time to see the difference.  Thanks for sharing.  I did half wheat/white for mine.

Wonderful loaf of bread! I halved the recipe and only added a few extra tablespoons of flour to get the right consistency. Reminded me a little of the bread served at Carino's Italian Restaurant--and we ate it just as quickly!

horribly sticky dough unless you add at least another 2 cups of flour, but once you get by the mess, the bread is divine!  I use whole leaves of basil either fresh from the garden or (when we're under 3 feet of snow) from the freezer.  Thank you!!!

I didn't have basil....I know crazy, but instead I used Italian seasoning (about 1 1/2tsps) and oregano (1tsp), I also put about a cup and a half of cheese instead of a cup.  I baked it for about 35min, but that may be because I don't have a super hot oven.  My husband loves this!!!

wonderful bread, it's dense- but in a good way. i added some garlic and served it with chicken parm. we dipped the bread in extra tomato sauce and it was great! the loaves the directions tell you to make are very large, so i ended up making 7 smaller ones, and they were still big - a good size to share with someone else.

Excellent flavor and texture, but as stated in other reviews, the amount of flour needed was much more than 4 cups - I estimate at least 5 and 1/2 cups.  Still a good solid recipe.  Thanks!

Really enjoyed this!  I used 3 tablespoons of fresh basil instead of the dried as another user did, and I also added a few cloves of minced garlic.  The bread is very dense, chewy and cheesy!  I had to use about 4 and 3/4 cups of flour...so not as much more than the recipe as others did.   I had this with vegetable soup, they were a great combination!

The ratio of 2 1/4 cups liquid to 4 cups of flour is not correct, it is more like 6 to make a nice dough. Can't wait to try it

YUM! Made this recipe yesterday based on the reviews here. I find that the almost 5 star recipes are keepers. This is DELISH!! my husband and i both loved it. Today i used a piece to make brushetta with - mmmmm. It's pretty basic as well, no funky cooking techniques, just super nice bread. And no, i didn't get it from the bakery! I love that :)/// August 2011 - have made this bread a dozen plus times now - i give it to people as gifts and they think i should be on master chef LOL --- i make it into 4 mini loaves - that way you won't get fat when you eat the entire loaf. it is truly THAT good. Make sure you cook this on the very bottom of the oven so the top doesn't burn, AND add some garlic powder to the dough. enjoy, wish i had created this myself!

This turned out to be a beautiful bread.  I did cut the recipe in half, as the reviews stated it made two loaves, and I'm glad I did because it still made one huge loaf. I'm going to use the leftovers to make sandwiches today.  It was delicious, easy to make and it will be a regular in my house.

I made one loaf by halving all ingredients, extra flour was needed while kneeling. The loaf is HUGE, while I wish I have had added a bit more cheese into it though. It is the most perfect loaf of bread I've made so far, and it's absolutely gorgeous.

I made mine Tomato Mozzarella Basil. Just Use a small can of Tomato Paste and 1 Cup and 2 oz of Water. So good! You could also just sub all the water for tomato juice.. a lil cheaper using the paste

This was a great recipe! I changed things up a bit - I made it cheesier by adding in a half cup of cheddar cheese as well - it turned out really amazing!

Excellent.  My group of girlfriends gets together about once a month at one of our houses for dinner and a movie.  The hostess rents the movie and makes the main dish.  The others bring a side dish, dessert or movie snack.  At our recent get-together, the hostess made potato-cheese soup, and I brought a version of this bread.  Wow, was it good!

I wanted a particularly hearty, rustic loaf, so I made the following changes to the recipe:
I wanted two large loaves, one for home, one for the party, so I increased the recipe by half.  I used six cups of flour, one-third whole wheat, one-third high gluten and one-third all-purpose.  I added a half cup of wheat germ, and used honey instead of sugar.  So as not to kill too much yeast, I added the salt after the initial cup and a half of flour.  I also used mixed fresh herbs (a combination of thyme, chives and marjoram, chopped finely), and shredded sharp cheddar instead of mozzarella.  That combination of herbs and cheddar cheese really complemented the potato-cheese soup.

To get a good crust, I spritzed the tops of the loaves with water before baking, and put a pan of water into   the oven to produce steam.  I sprinkled the tops with sea salt and freshly-ground pepper before baking.

I will definitely make this bread again.

I give this a 4 star for taste.  I should've read more reviews first.  I used about 4 1/2 cups flour, it didn't seem enough but I didn't want to overdo the flour.  I seem one review that suggested up to 5 1/2 cups.  I might try this again using that much flour.
As is, the dough is very sticky.  The outside of the bread cooked up, but the inside was still a little wet.

This is an incrediblyeasy tasty herb bread that has satisfied even the pickiest eater in my family.  It bakes up with a great golden crust yet the inside is super moist.  It is great served with herbed dipping oil.  I will make it again and again and again!!!

5 stars plus.  This bread turned out fanstatic.  I used the bread maker and took it out after the first rise.  Put it into 2 greased loaf pans and baked.  The next time I made it, I used 3 c. white flour and 1 c. dark rye flour and added a tablespoon of dill weed.   This bread was also fantastic.

After adding 2 more cups of flour - it was nice.....as the recipe is for a dough that’s hydration percent is OVER 100%.....wayyyy too much liquid (2 cups of water AND milk too?)....must be an error.....

Next time I’ll reduce liquid vs adding more flour.....

I halved the  original recipe, then added 1/2 C flour. I baked it at 400 degrees instead of 425. With these small changes, the recipe worked splendidly. I made 2 small loaves, and they held their shape pretty well.  The texture of the bread was spot on and the flavor was delicious. I used them for meatball subs and to dip in seasoned olive oil. It's a keeper. Thank you so much for sharing!

Delicious but the flour amount in the recipe is definitely off. I needed at least 5 cups before it didn't glue to the floured countertop.

I love this recipe. Instead of the basil I use 2tbsp. of sour cream. Also use this recipe for raisin bread. Add raisins & 2 tbsp. of cinnamon.

Halved the recipe and made 2 oval loaves. Read the reviews so I made sure to add more flour until it felt right while kneading. Also used 2 tbsp fresh basil instead of 1.5 tsp dry. Baked for about 20 minutes. Cut into slices. Great with salted butter. Surprisingly tasty with strawberry jam. I'll use it to make into garlic bread, too, can't wait to try that.

I made this bread yesterday. It was very good. My husband said it was the best bread I have made yet. I used rosemary and garlic instead of basil.

Very good, however I don't think the mozzarella came thru at all. I sliced this bread, spread with tomato sauce, topped with mozzarella and broiled. Delicious! Tasted like pizza bread. Also made a fantastic grilled cheese sandwich.
