If you like Italian Sausage you'll love these meatballs. They make a great meatball sandwich. I cooked the meatballs in two batches. One batch I fried as the recipe stated, and the other I just baked as another reviewer suggested. Just baking until the meatballs  was easier and I could not tell the difference between the two batches.  Also, if your going to go to this much work to make meatballs, don't use jarred marinara sauce, make your own from one the many recipes found on this site. Much better. Thanks for the recipe Kararnmi.

I did not add in the mozzarella or ricotta cheese, but might try that the next time!  I also baked the meatballs instead of frying at 350' for 25 minutes...they were outstanding!

I followed the recipe to the letter and these were really divine!! I highly recommend this recipe if you're going to tackle homemade meatballs. It IS time consuming, but worth it! Oh, and it makes quite a bit, so you can use it for 2 meals for a  family of 3-5. Makes awesome meatball subs too. Better than Subway's my son said!

I made these on the fly with what I had in the house, and omitted the ricotta, mozzerella & egg, and used dried parsley and basil. I also just used ground beef, since  I was sausageless. I baked them at 350 for 25 minutes, like another review suggested, and didn't sear first.  

Since I was making food for the week, I didn't simmer them in sauce, either.  But OMG -- MOIST & DEELISH!! It was all I could do not to eat half of them myself as I let them cool before putting them away!! #BestMeatballRecipeEver!!!

Very good! I made meatball sandwiches with my leftover meatballs and they were the best I have ever eaten! I topped the sandwiches with marinara, shaved Parmesan and mozerella cheese! Absolutely divine!!

So good! I went straight to baking and didn’t pan sear. At any rate, they turned out amazing! Best meatballs I’ve ever made! I will always simmer them in the sauce, it makes both the meatballs and sauce tastier!

Have made these meatballs twice for large parties.  They seem to always be the hit food of the party.  I didn't pan fry them either, and they came out delicious!

Made two batches of these again last night because I have two parties to go to this weekend that I offered to bring them to.  First batch I didn’t re-read the directions before hand and just put everything in one bowl and mixed together.  Then realized I was supposed to cook the onions and mix the eggs and spices in a food processor.  Oh well too late.  The second batch I did as instructed and cooked the onion and processed the eggs and spices and then mixed with the cheese etc.  I didn’t fry either batch.  I just put them both straight into the oven.  I noticed barely any difference between the way they came out.  Gave BF a taste of each one.  He said the ones that were made as instructed were barely slightly better.  SOOOO.... if you’re looking to save time I would say you could really just put everything in one bowl, mix it together and make the meatballs w/o frying first.  Anyways.... this is the only way I will ever make meatballs again. They are beyond fantastic!!!

Very good recipe - I skipped the ricotta cheese, added 1/4 cup of milk, and used regular pork sausage. They made excellent grinders.

This recipe is really quite good, although somewhat long and evolved in the process of cooking  the meatballs. This time I just made it in to a meat sauce to go over zoodle noodles. Why not just do one or the other of the cooking (in the oven or fried). A lot less fat if oven baked.

I did not sauté the onions for 10 minutes - it seemed like too long.  And I added a teaspoon of dried oregano to the onions as I sautéed them.  Overall the recipe was a big hit.

I made it as directed, but didn't let it simmer for hours and it still turned out fantastic!  I made sandwiches with them and topped them w/mozzarella, sauteed mushrooms and bell peppers - uh, Yum! And it did make a lot of meatballs for our family of 3. So I just froze the extra uncooked meatballs to be used at a later date.

Very Americanized recipe, needs work.    Definitely didn't need the additional salt.  San Marzano tomatoes and day old bread which is soaked in milk & then squeezed out is also used in a REAL Italian Meatball recipe,  as well as all fresh herbs and freshly grated cheese.

These turned out amazing! I left out the parsley because I didn’t have any. I also used 2 pounds of ground venison instead of ground beef. I put them straight in the oven at 350 for 25 minutes, instead of cooking them in the pan first.

I didn't make any changes and these meatballs are what I've been looking for and trying to make for years now.  They are truly Divine, no wonder that's their name.  They're soft but stay together, the sausage isn't over-whelming.  I used them in pasta sauce, then froze the rest and had them as meatball sandwiches and then broke some down to use in lasagna, every dish was amazing.  You've got to try them!

Been making meatballs for many years and decided to find a "hopefully" better recipe  These are FANTASTIC!!!   The changes I made are:  One pound ground pork and two Italian sausages with casings removed instead on one pound sausage.  Couple dashes of minced dried onion instead of the fresh onion.  1/4 cup milk.  Then I dropped them into my sauce raw and cooked them that way.   I made them yesterday and there were only about 5 left lol, so I ran out and got the stuff to make more, so I'll have some to freeze. Everyone raved over them!!!!

You can totally leave out the bread crumbs and make them gluten free. If you need a filler, use gluten free oats.

Made this just as described, except I made the meatball a bit larger. I also deep fried them for about 3 minutes to brown them evenly before baking. Turned out wonderful.

These were delicious!  I didn't have any pork on hand so I only used ground beef.   They were still very tasty!  My fiancee couldn't get enough of them.  Thank you for sharing!

These came out very good.  They are a lot of work but worth it.  I  thought it was a little heavy on the Worcestershire so next time I will use a little less.  I followed the recipe ingredients exactly.  Instead of frying I baked all of the meatballs.  I put them in a 350 oven for 10 minutes turned them over and baked for an additional 10 minutes. Served them in a homemade  spaghetti sauce.

Prepared meatballs as written.  I fry absolutely nothing.  Placed on baking sheet in 425° oven for 10 minutes.  Turned out beautifully.  Drain fat and used homemade tomato sauce.  Great flavorful recipe!  Will make a double batch and freeze for later use.  Fresh herbs and spices do make the difference.  Worth the effort.

These meatballs were the best I have ever made or had. They were extremely moist and full of flavor.  I substituted the ground chuck for ground turkey because we have a hard time digesting beef. It was still perfect and went great with the homemade spaghetti sauce!!!!

These were good, but very labor intensive.  Also, I would skip the frying first next time, I think they would have been more juicy if I had skipped that step.

I will make it again as it had lots of flavour.  I was thinking that it might actually make a good meat loaf if I work it a bit differently.

They  meatballs turned out so moist and flavorful.  
This one’s a keeper!

As I was making these, my only thought was, they better be really good because they are time consuming.  After cooking as directed, and another hour simmering in my husbands homemade sauce, I pulled one out for him to try.  He says they are the best meatballs he has ever had!   I agree!

These are great !  Ground beef is listed as "ground chuck" and the sausage is listed "Italian pork sausage".   The Italian sausage comes in mild or spicy.  It is helpful to read the list several times because there are a lot of ingredients.

These were fantastic meatballs.  I omitted the ricotta cheese and baked them for 15 minutes without frying.  They came out so moist and delicious!  Would make this for any occasion.  This will be a standard in my home!
