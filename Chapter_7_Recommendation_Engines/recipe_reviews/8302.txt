Okay, so I made some changes after reading all the other reviews, and with these changes, this cake is amazing!!! Here are the changes I made: 1 cup white sugar, 2 large bananas, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 cup chocolate chips, 1/2 cup butterscotch chips, used baking SODA instead of baking powder, and sprinkled powdered sugar on top after it cooled. Baked at 350 for 40 minutes in an 8x8 pan. Everything else was the same as the original recipe. The cake came out super moist, thick (not thin), and tasted delicious. I will definitely be making this again!!

I did not read the reviews before I made this, so my "cake" did turn out a little thin, HOWEVER, this is a really good, quick dessert.  I was invited for dinner and wanted to bring something.  Everyone seemed to like this.

Changes I made:  I used two large bananas, which equaled about 1 1/2 -2 cups mashed bananas.  I used one full cup of sugar because usually banana bread isn't sweet enough.  I added about one teaspoon of vanilla.  I also used about two handfuls of milk chocolate chips.  I don't like the semi-sweet.  I had no complaints and the chips really gave a good twist to regular banana bread.  With the additions, it was plenty sweet and very, very moist.  I had to bake it the full 35 minutes, almost 40 minutes, due to the additions.  As a rule, I always set my timer about ten minutes early because you never know about your particular oven.

Excellent! This turned out wonderful! Be sure to read the reviews, though. I doubled the recipe to make it more of a cake rather than the bars like other cooks were doing. I topped it with chocolate frosting and sprinkles. Very fun and will definitely make again!

Very good dessert.  It is a thin cake, for a normal cake thickness I would recomend doubling the recipe.  By using chocolate chips there is no need for icing.  I did add 1/2 tsp. of vanilla.  And I used baking soda not baking powder.  All homemade cakes call for baking soda, it works much better than baking powder as a leavener.  For example, I made a homeade chocolate cake and by accident used baking powder instead of baking soda, and it came out very thick like brownies.  When I made that same cake again, I used baking soda and it was a cake consistancy.

I used three mashed bananas, I didn't measure out a cupful. I just opened three and mashed those. I also used part of a leftover can of fat free evaporated milk and mini chocolate chips instead of regular. One of the better banana breads I've had in a long time. I made muffins out of this recipe and I did NOT get 24 out of this recipe, I got 12 and they were a little on the small side. 350* for exactly 20 minutes and they were perfect. I'll use this recipe again.

I made this recipe as is, except for putting it in an 8x8 pan.  It turned out just fine.  Plenty of banana flavor, more than enough choc.

I enjoyed this cake. I, too, had problems with it not being enough batter to make a "real" cake; it resembled bars. If you want more of a cake, then either make 2x the recipe or bake it in a smaller pan (8x8 square would suffice). I was happy with the bars, though, and I will definately make this again. I may try a cream cheese frosting in the future, although it tastes good without frosting.

I doubled the recipe and cooked it in a 9 by 18 pan for about 10 minutes longer.  This is the best banana cake I've ever had.  I didn't even have to frost it, and it was so moist!  I used barely ripe bananas, so it wasn't too sweet.  Great recipe.

I think the secret may lie in using bananas that are NOT overripe.  I can't believe how fast and easy this recipe is, and the choc chips did not get mushy or sink to the bottom!  A winner!

I just loved this cake!  When it cooled, I poked holes in it, and then poured chocolate pudding on top (instead of frosting).  I put it in the refrig until the pudding set.  It was delicious!

So good and very moist.  Used baking soda instead of powder, 2 bananas, 3/4 cup sugar, 1/2 tsp vanilla, and an extra 1/4 cup chocolate chips on top.  Baked in 8x8 pan for 40 min.

I made this cake yesterday with the following revisions. 1 cup sugar, baking soda instead of baking powder, and 2 large bananas. I also added 1 tsp of vanilla extract. I have to say that this was one of the most delicious cakes I have EVER eaten. We absolutely LOVED it. It was nice and light and airy,and just melted in your mouth. Delicious!

Very moist & delicious!  Didn't change any of the listed ingredients, just baked in an 8x8 pan to get the "cake" thickness.  I did, however, add 1 tsp vanilla extract because it's cake!  We thought the sweetness was well balanced, so no need to up the sugar.  We loved it, even if it was a tad bit too brown around the edges from my pan size change!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!  :)

Honestly, I would not call this a cake, but rather a bar recipe.  Mine came out very dense, without much rise or fluff to them at all.  The flavor is all right.  Without the frosting that I put on (I used the banana butter frosting from this site), I think most of these would have been wasted.

This is an excellent and easy recipe as it stands, with no changes... except the pan size. If you want "cake" you should either double this recipe to fit in a 9x13" or use the recipe as is, in a 9x9" pan. If you put this amount of batter in a 9x13", it will be very flat and turn out more like bars than cake. People have changed the baking powder to soda and I am not sure why one would do that? The baking powder (which already has baking soda in it) makes the cake rise nicely and that amount of straight soda makes it more salty and a bit bitter. I doubled this recipe and baked it in a 9x13" pan for about 40 mins. It was perfect.

Keep the original recipe if you want more of a cake, follow the reviews if you want more of a banana bread.  I've done it both ways.

Our new standard when we have overripe bananas!  Did what others recommended:  1 cup sugar, 3 bananas, soda instead of powder, 1 cup chips and added a "glug" of vanilla.  I never have to scrounge for a banana bread recipe again!

Excellent, with the following changes.  As per other reviewers' suggestions, I used BAKING SODA instead of baking powder and added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla to the banana mixture.  I also baked in a 8x8 pan for a bit more than 40 minutes.

I had some ripe bananas to use up and was craving something chocolate, so I decided to try this recipe. These are good as bars, but not necessarily as a cake since they are too flat and dense. I would recommend baking them in a smaller pan to make them thicker and using mini chocolate chips. I frosted them with chocolate frosting and it was a nice combination. Delicious with a cup of coffee.

Amazing recipe.  I used 1 C of whole wheat flour and 1/2 C of regular flour to make it healther. Made the changes as suggested with 1 C sugar, baking soda instead of powder, 2 large bananas (1 1/2 C to 2 C of bananas), and 1 tsp Vanilla.  Used 1 C of dark chocolate chips instead of semisweet because that was all I had.  Sprinkled with powdered sugar when it was cooled, and it was so delicious.  My 4 year old son finished a piece of this in 5 big bites if that says anything.  Would make again!

Excellent cake and very easy.  I did follow the suggestions of other reviewers.  I used baking soda instead of baking powder, 1 cup of sugar, 1 tsp of vanilla, 1/2 cup of milk chocolate chips and 1/4 cup butterscotch chips.  I also baked it in a 8x8 dish.  Delicious!  When my husband asks for seconds....you know it's a keeper.  Will definitely make again!

This cake was fabulous. My neice and I made this together for an after dinner treat and it was delicious. It was moist and sweet and flavorful. The only thing I had to change was I added sour cream instead of milk because I didn't have any in the house and I ddidn't realize before I started baking. Also I added 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts to it because there is something about bananas and walnuts that just go together. Also I would add about a tsp of vanilla in the future just for some extra flavor. I used mini chocolate chips and it was perfect. Each bite had as much chocolate as banana flavor. I made this in a regular 9x12 cake pan and served with whipped cream while still warm with coffee. This one is definately a keeper. Yummy!

10 stars from me. As many reviews suggested I used baking soda in place of the baking powder. Added 1/2 tsp. of vanilla extract and 3 medium bananas, mashed. Baked in an 8x8 glass dish for 40 minutes. It was in the oven for about 5 minutes when I realized I had forgotten to add the chocolate chips so I put them on the top hoping they would sink in but they didn't. What flavor this has. Update, should have made 2, this is going fast.

I can't count the number of different banana bread recipes I have made over the years… this one is right up with the best we've had.  I did use 3 medium bananas instead of measuring and I baked in a 9x5 loaf pan. My son had a warm piece fresh from the oven that he said tasted like yummy buttered banana bread.

Been making this recipe for many years now. I rarely use chocolate chips. Normally I add oats and/or chopped nuts. I also sub approx. half of the flour for whole wheat or spelt flour. I squish the bananas with my hands together with the egg and some vanilla extract. If the bananas are really ripe, I add a lot less sugar. The banana bread always tastes amazing! Thanks for the recipe!

this was pretty good. I used the other reviewers tips of using two bananas.  It  might have gotten more stars if not for my bad; i had no vanilla so i tried almond ext. instead. you could definitely taste it.  Also my bananas were practically green, so next time i will try to wait for riper bananas.  I made it for my two year olds' birthday and it was a big hit with him, his older brother, and even banana hating daddy liked it.  So i will make it again but i might try mini chips if i can remember to get some.

I made this per the recipe other than increasing the chocolate to 1 cup.  I would call this Banana Chocolate Chip Snack Cake. It does not rise high enough to be considered a cake. It is more like a muffin without the hassle of muffin cups. The flavor is great. I was not patient enough to allow for cooling time. Tastes great hot and cooled. I think I will add nuts next time. This was a great after dinner treat and I think it will be perfect for the kids lunchboxes, using a cookie cutter for a cute shape.

I should have read reviews too.  It definitely would have been better in a smaller pan!! 13 x 9 makes it about an inch high! I did add a bit of cinnamon but an extra egg and/ or milk and vanilla might have helped. We used chocolate frosting that made it at least edible.  I was sorry I wasted my time making a cake from "scratch", and it was for my son's birthday.

A great recipe. I was afraid as I was making it that there wouldn't be enough batter for the 9x13 inch pan, but there was! It turned out very yummy. A keeper! Thank you for the recipe :)

I added some cocoa powder for some extra chocolate punch. It turned out to be more like a brownie but was very good. I added a peanut butter and cream cheese frosting recipe I found in The Joy of Cooking - it calls for rum and was a nice compliment to the banana flavor.

with anything using bananas you need to mix the baking powder/soda in with the mashed bananas very well, in a separate step mind you, for at least 5 minutes before continuing the process. the chemical reaction between the acid in the bananas and the baking powder gives it the rise and fluffiness.

Made this exactly like the recipe states and it was delicious. I will definitely make this again. It was a big hit. I made this in a loaf pan and baked it for 50 minutes. Wow....so good and moist. Great way to use up those ripe bananas.

This is delicious. I followed the recipe exactly except for changing the baking powder to baking soda as so many reviewers suggested. I did not increase the sugar, as others did, and found the sweetness to be perfect. I had 4 small bananas (VERY ripe) to use up and they measured out to 1 1/3 cups, so they all went in. Baked in the pan called for and liked how it turned out, similar in height to a sheet cake. I checked it at 25 min. and was glad I did because it was totally done.

Just made this cake and it turned out great. My husband said it was really good and agreed with me even better tomorrow. I used an 8 x 11 pan instead of 9 x 13 after reading several reviews. This is the only change I would make to this recipe. I will make again for sure.

Very very good. I followed other people's review and put extra banana and 1 cup of sugar and put baking SODA in as well. And it turned out great. I would say almost a little too sweet. But it was light and fluffy and sweet.

Delicious!!! Made same changes as previous reviewers: used baking soda instead of baking powder, used 1 cup sugar, 2 large bananas, AND since i wanted it to be lactose free used 1/4 cup orange juice and 1/2 cup canola oil instead of butter, it was excellent!!!

I made this for my son's 4th birthday cake. I tripled the recipe and used baking soda instead of powder (as another reviewer suggested). I also used mini chocolate chips. The thickness was more like a normal cake & not flat. The tripled recipe was enough for one 9x13 pan and one 8x8 pan = one robot cake.

I made this for my birthday and it was wonderful!  I doubled the recipe and split it between two 8x8 pans.  I added an extra banana to increase the banana flavor and put fresh bananas and banana pudding between the layers and used peanut butter/banana frosting found on this website to frost it! Best birthday cake EVER!

My hubby and I wanted a quick dessert, and I needed to use up ripe bananas.  I used 1.5 bananas and added 1 tsp. vanilla.  It is a little thinner than a usual cake, but it was delicious!  Will definitey make again!

This was an excellent cake - moist, tasty and great texture. I added some vanilla extract and doubled the quantity of the mixture and this made a much larger, more substantial cake. I also added 10 minutes on the cooking time. I will definitley mkae this again - it was a winner with my husband, too!

LOVED THIS RECIPE!!!! The only thing I changed was increasing the sugar and choc. chips to 1 cup and put in a 9x9 clear glass baking dish.  It was very cake like and moist.  The only thing my family said that would make it a 5 star recipe was to add walnuts.  It did not even have time to finish cooling before my family devoured the whole thing.  It does not need frosting of any kind. Increasing the sugar and choc. chips makes it sweet enough.

I give this recipe 4.5 stars.  Like Sara, I also increased the sugar to 1 cup, and used 1 cup of chocolate chips.  I baked it in a 9 inch pan lined with parchment for easy removal when it was done.  I frosted mine with some leftover butter cream icing made with cream cheese.  It made for a nice topping. I will definitely make this cake again.

Update, I've made this one a couple of times and the kids absolutely love it every time. If you use over ripe bananas it is plenty sweet, in fact I lowered the sugar in mine the second time…..   

I used two small bananas and added 1/4 cup of flax seed meal, added a tsp of vanilla and used baking soda instead of baking powder. I also subbed half the flour for whole wheat flour and made it into muffins instead of a cake. It turned out light and fluffy making 12 muffins. It is plenty sweet so there is no need to add more sugar or chocolate chips. I did however use over ripe bananas.

This cake is nothing special to look at, but boy oh boy does it taste delicious!  I have made it several times and everytime I make it the whole cake gets eaten.  My daughters friends even ask her to bring them some to school! The only addition that I make to the recipe is to add a teaspoon of vanilla to the batter with the wet ingredients. Love this cake!

It still tasted good however I recommend altering three things:
1) instead of 3/4 of a cup of chocolate chips, I would add only 1/2 cup
2) I would add a little bit less sugar
3) I would use a smaller pan than 9x13 if you want a normal thickness to your cake

I loved this recipe! It is definately more like bars instead of cake.  It was a real hit at work.  I've made this several times.  I used milk chocolate chips.  I added alittle more sugar and more chocolate chips.  Delicious!

I followed the changes that Sara made except I used 1/2 cup of semi sweet chocolate chips and 1/2 cup peanut butter chips.  The cake was super moist and delicious!  Will definitely make this again!

Thank you Sara! I followed your provisions and my cake came out moist and thick. :) I did not have bananas, so I excluded that from my ingredients but it still came out amazing! First time trying to make a cake was a success!

I made these into cupcakes - they made 16.  I baked them for 15 minutes.  They are delicious! Zero changes.

I doubled the recipe. Used 100% whole wheat flour, only 2/3c sugar, 1.25c hot chocolate powder (had no cocoa), and substituted 3/4c flour with 1/4c ground flax and 1/2c wheat germ. Cake is very moist and dense, almost like brownies but richer. I also cut the oil down to 3/4c instead of 1c. Needs to bake for 40-50 minutes.

This tasted very good and was very easy to make.  The chocolate chips add a nice flavor to this cake without being overpowering.  I used 3 smaller size bananas but I think I should have used 1 or even 2 more for more banana flavor.  Next time I'll use more bananas and maybe even a little bit more sugar too.  All in all a very easy to put together and great tasting cake.  Thank you for the recipe!

This was easy to make, moist and delicious.  The only change I made was the addition of 1 teas. vanilla.  I used a 9 x 13 pan.  Mine came out like banana chocolate chip brownies rather than cake, but nothing wrong with that, they were great.  Thanks for the recipe.

I doubled the recipe, put it in a bundt cake pan, cooked 60 minutes or so. My 4 sons said they prefer this to all other cake recipes. It doesn't last 10 minutes -- they can't wait until it is cool! Thanks for sharing this!

Great recipe - it came out a bit dense and thin, but since it's such a rich flavor, it worked out just fine.  Used chocolate/caramel swirl chips and made up a chocolate confectioners sugar frosting. A great success that will be made again!

Taste was great - but unfortunately I read the reviews after I had already made it and it did come out way too flat.  Next time I will double it.

It was okay. Tasted like and looked like banana bread to me. It was very flat and condensed. It was good, but not very cake like.

Following the lead of others, I modified this recipe with much success.  I doubled it and used a heavy bundt pan.  Cooking time was increased to 45 minutes (still at 350).  I then frosted it with my fudgy chocolate icing and sprinkled a light dusting of cocoa.  Was a big hit at Easter dinner.

my husband asked me to make this.  we were disappointed.  it had a strange kind of bitter aftertaste even though i added an extra half cup bananas and a little extra sugar.  mixed reviews from our kids.  the 5yo who usually eats anything sweet didn't like it at all.  however, our over-picky 12yo liked it....

The second time I made it, I doubled the recipe. I also substituted buttermilk for the liquid, added 1T vanilla, and baked for 35 minutes.  I sifted powdered sugar over the finished cake.  It was the right size when doubled.  The buttermilk makes it lighter.  A very moist, tasty and easy recipe.

This was good...although mine turned out more like a 'square' than a cake in terms of how thin and flat it was.  I went out and bought new baking powder in case that was the problem, or maybe this is how it is supposed to look.  Easy, quick, and good though!

Wonderfully moist and delicious cake, that is really easy to make with children.  The only change I made is to put it in a 9 x 9 pan instead of the size suggested.  Made for a thicker and moister cake.

Loved it! I replaced the semi-sweet chocolate chips for milk chocolate chips, added the 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and sprinkled powdered sugar on top when baked for a beautiful presentation.

I used two bananas and added about a half cup of chopped walnuts. I had not read any of the reviews until after and I am glad that I didn't. I overbaked it a bit but was still really god nice and moist didn't even need any glaze or frosting! Definitely making it again!!!

Nice, basic banana cake that hubs is liking.  I myself would prefer it without chocolate chips, but I made this for him.  I read through a lot of reviews, but the only thing I changed was to put this in an 8x8 pan instead of a 9x13 so I'd have a cake vs. bars.  It made for a nice, thick cake that hubs can eat mostly by himself over the course of several days.  It needed perhaps another 15-20 minutes to bake thoroughly in the 8x8.  Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this was very good! I followed the advice of the top reviewer and increased the sugar to 1 cup, used baking soda instead of baking powder, added 1 t. vanilla, 1 cup chocolate chips and baked it in an 8x8 loaf pan. It turned out great--except for one thing that was entirely my fault: I used 4 mushy bananas and the middle was a little undercooked after 40 minutes. If I had used less banana it would have cooked solid in the middle. Still, it is excellent and I will make this again and again. Yummy!

Great recipe. I made following changes...added 1 tsp vanilla, used 1 1/2 tsp baking soda (no baking powder), used 2 bananas, used 1 cup sugar, added a bit more chocolate chips, baked in an 8x8 pan for 40 minutes. It's yummy!!  Next time I will add walnuts.

I've made this recipe twice now (with the changes recommended in the reviews), once as a 9-inch round cake and once as cupcakes (12 total). Both times it turned out incredibly delicious, moist and fluffy. Who needs banana bread when you can have banana cake??

I really enjoyed this cake. I made a couple of modifications based on other reviews: 1c sugar (2/3 white, 1/3 brown), some chopped walnuts, a splash of pure vanilla extract, cinnamon, and nutmeg. I used two very ripe bananas and made it all in the food processor (wet first, pulse until puréed, then add dry, pulse just until mixed, then stir in choc chips and walnuts). The only change I'd make next time is to stick to the recipe's recommend 2/3c sugar, as it turned out a bit too sweet for my taste. Otherwise I found it moist and delicious with awesome banana flavor and texture. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

Forgot to mention: I made this in a 9 in round cake pan instead of 9x13. It rose well and was definitely more cake than bar.

Excellent!  Used others suggestions...1 cup sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 cup choc chips, 1/2 cup butterscotch chips and baking soda instead of baking powder.

This is a great recipe! Ive made this twice already. First time with half granulated sugar and brown sugar, baking soda instead of baking powder, one ripe banana, half & half instead of milk & 1 tsp of vanilla extract in a 8X8" pan. It was a nice two inch height, very moist but came out darker because of the brown sugar. One banana gave it just enough banana flavor. The second time i made this recipe by doubling the ingredients, still used baking soda in place of baking powder, used 3 small sized very ripe bananas, half&half instead lf milk, 2 tsp of vanilla extract in a 13X9" pan and was also a great height with lots of banana flavor. I think adding some walnuts to the cake would also be a delicious addition. Ill have to try that next!

My husband had seconds and texted me the following day from work to tell me how awesome this cake was.  I did double all the ingredients and used a total of 3 large, over-ripe bananas.  I used a bundt pan, which took about one hour to bake.

This dessert is absolutely amazing!  My guests all had seconds and probably would have had thirds if I had any left.  Following the advice of other reviewers, I used a 9x9 cake pan and changed the following ingredient amounts:  1 cup white sugar, 2 large bananas, and baking soda instead of baking powder.  I sprinkled each piece with powdered sugar.  My only concern is that my chocolate chips all sunk to the bottom and middle of the cake.  Overall, the chocolate sinking didn't really matter, because it tasted fantastic!  I can't wait to make this again.

I followed this recipe but made the following customizations:
~Instead of 1/2 cup butter, I used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup applesauce. 
~I also added 1/4 cup peanut butter. 
~I used 2 small & 1 large ripe bananas.
~I used baking soda instead of baking powder.

This made 12 standard size muffins and an 8x8 (although it was a little shallow)

Delicious!

I wanted to make the cake non-dairy, so I used canola oil instead of the butter and vanilla flavored soy milk instead of the milk.
I baked it in a 9" loaf pan for about an hour. It came out great!!

Very good cake!! Based on previous reviews I made the following changes: 1 cup white sugar, 2 large bananas, 1 tsp. vanilla, 1/2 cup of chocolate chips, and baking soda rather than baking powder. This cake is better served after it completely cools down - otherwise the chocolate is melted and completely overpowers the banana flavor. Next time I will use even less than a 1/2 cup of chocolate chips - less is more in this recipe. Also, this recipe would taste delicious as cupcakes with walnuts.

this was GREAT!!!  I added a tsp or so of vanilla and used baking soda instead of baking powder.  I used two bananas...  it was a little on the sweet side, I'd cut down the sugar to maybe 1/2 C next time.  i liked it plain, the kids liked it with frosting on it.  super good - definitely going to make this again!

ETA - ok I've made it a bunch of times now.  definitely use baking soda in place of the baking powder and add the vanilla.  I cut down the sugar to 1/2 cup.  Typically I double the recipe and use 5 bananas and bake the whole thing in a large pyrex pan or 3 cake pans.  the most recent time I made it with whole wheat pastry flour and replaced 1/4 cup of the flour with wheat germ - it came out really good .  I've tried it replacing 1/2 of the butter with applesauce- it's not quite as good but still tasty.  I prefer 1/2 chocolate chips & 1/2 butterscotch chips.  This is an excellent cake!

I doubled the recipe and placed it in a 13x9 pan. This way, the cake wasn't too thin and it was just so moist and absolutely delicious! I am most definitely going to be making these again.

it was excellent.  i didn't have butter so i used a 4oz container of unsweetened applesauce.  i used baking soda instead of baking powder and i added some cinnamon.  the consistency was a little different than cake because of the applesauce but it was healthier and still yummy :-)

I live in japan and don't really have access to alot of easily accessible baking goods like I did back when I was home in Canada so when I found this recipe, I had all the ingredients on hand except the choco chips but desperately needed to use my two ripe bananas. One ingredient that I took with me was good ol baking powder but didn't think about bringing soda thinking they would have some here but boy was I wrong. So finding a recipe with baking powder was also a mission. You also may not know this but we don't have ovens here, none of the apartments or houses come with one , it's like a luxury here so I rely on my Oster oven. I was pretty worried about using the baking powder since everyone was posting about using soda instead but I had faith in this recipe. I made it with little exceptions besides adding some vanilla and a scoop of peanut butter since I didn't have any choco chips. Baked it in a small round cake pan I think it's around 8 inches and it turned out pretty good! I would probably give it a 5star when I make it next time with choco chips and more bananas! Great recipe though!

This recipe is superb! I was forced to make a couple alterations, but it still turned out great. First of all, I doubled the recipe but didn't have quite enough bananas, so I used about 1/2 cup crushed strawberries to make up the amount. I ran out of milk so I used evaporated milk instead. I followed the advice of other reviewers and substituted the baking powder with baking soda, and added a bit more sugar than was called for by the original recipe. I also added vanilla as well as mixed spices for taste. I made cupcakes (baked for about 15 minutes). Just took them out of the oven and they are absolutely YUM!

Yumm! I've made a lot of different breads and cakes with banana but this is the best one ever!!  My husband and I had eaten the whole cake within two days.  I made it in a 9x9 pan and it turned our perfect.  next time I'll experiment with using 1/2 applesauce instead of the butter to make it a little healthier.

Loved this recipe!  Really moist and delicious.  Followed the directions for the most part, used a bit more chocolate because I love chocolate and substituted the baking powder for the soda as the others suggested.  i may even make them into cupcakes and make a little honey cinnamon frosting for them, would be great for a kid party.

The bread comes out smooth and very moist! I followed the other review's suggestion of replacing baking powder with baking SODA. I'm not quite sure what big of a difference it makes, but I trust her anyway. This is definitely a keeper :) Thanks for the wonderful recipe. p.s: my mom claimed its better than Starbuck's or any other banana breads she have ever tried.

One word - Delicious!  The only change I made was adding additional banana -- probably 2 1/2 cups total.  Definitely comes out as a bar and not a cake but that is what I wanted. Thanks for the great recipe.

Tasty.  I followed the instructions as listed with the addition of vanilla and subbed baking powder for soda for more rise.  I baked in a 8x11 pan for 30 minutes, and it was a bit overcooked.  Choc chips also sank to the bottom, so next time I'll coat them in flour to keep them floating in the cake.  Added some chocolate frosting when cool.  Moist and tasty.  Will make this one again!

This is the best cake I've EVER EVER had, and my boyfriend agrees...we finished the entire thing in a couple days.  Definitely use baking soda instead of baking powder.

Very moist and delicious snack cake! Because of the comments about the cake not rising much, I did use the baking soda instead of the powder. Baked the cake in a 11x7 pan and it was just perfect! Sooooooo good with a cold glass of milk!

I love this recipe, follow it to the end. Its a great way to use ripe bananas. I have also added peanut butter chips, and it's so yummy. No frosting needed, that's my favorite part. Thanks for the great recipe.

Awesome recipe! Very easy to make and tasted really good! Although I substituted the baking powder with soda instead, and added a teaspoon of vanilla, and I put flakes instead of chips hehe. Great recipe here guys, recommend anyone to try it!

We love this cake!  My husband really likes it. I've made it about 3 times now, the last time I made it, I added about 3/4 cup sour cream and baked it in a loaf pan instead of square. It was more like bread that way and easy to slice and eat for a snack.  I will always add the sour cream from now on.  It made it better than the original.  Warning, this stuff is addictive!

I revised it for our tastes, did 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar, didn't add salt, used salted butter, added 1 1/2 t. vanilla  (real vanilla) changed the butter to 1/2 butter, 1/2 applesauce, used sour milk and added more choc. chips. I made it one night it was gone the next morning, got requests to make it again. :) It's a keeper.

So thick, moist and delicious!  Bake in an 8x8 metal pan, and add about 1 tsp. vanilla extract to the egg/banana/butter mixture.

I'm taking this to my brother's Father's Day BBQ next weekend!

This was good, was just surpised at how thin it was. (therefore, overcooked it a little) I would follow previous suggestions to use smaller pan or double the batter.

This is a greaat recipe when you're needing to do something with overrip bananas,BUT don't want to make banana bread again.  This recipe is so quick and easy.  Everything I needed was already on hand.  Best of all, it also hs chocolate in it. The recipe as written is better suited for an 8x8 baking pan.  I also doubled the recipe and put it in a 9x13.  But this would also be good made in a bundt pan. The next time I make this, I'm going to experiment and use 1/2 cup peanut butter and 1/2 cup melted butter, use 8 oz. of vanila yogurt instead of the milk and add 1 cup chopped peanuts.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

This cake was not only a BIG hit it has become my most requested cake....even over my specialty...carrot cake.  My husband has not eaten a banana at all this week...when I asked him why, he said, " Well. I was hoping to get you to make that cake again!"
I altered the recipe a bit based on others comments...I reduced the sugar a bit and added more bananas.  I also made the milk into "sour" milk by adding one teaspoon of soda and one teaspoon of vinegar to the milk and stirring it slightly.  I also used milk chocolate chips.  Tonight I will be also adding some walnuts (hubby's request)...It came out much more "cake like" and not at all like a bread....when in doubt mix it up and make it your own!
Happy Baking! And THANK YOU! for an awesome recipe!

Tssty, but came out a lot flatter than I expected. Probably would benefit from other reviewers suggestions on modifying the recipe. However, it was easy and my 7 year old loved making it.

I made this last week and my family loved it.  After I first baked it, I took half over to my mom's and I'm sorry I did because our half was gone so fast and we all wanted more.  Even my picky 11 yo loved it.

Oh well, I'll have to make it again tonight.

Thanks for posting!

I thought this was a great recipe.  It was moist and flavorful.  I used mini chocolate chips instead(1 1/3 cups) and used a Pyrex 11x7x1.5in baking dish.  A definite keeper in my  recipe book!

We had a few bananas sitting in the fruit bowl and turning black, so I used them to try this recipe. I substitued two coarsely chopped milk chocolate bars for the chocolate chips (I like milk chocolate better than semisweet) and it was delicious. The only thing was that this cake is quite thin and flat. More like banana chocolate chip bars than cake. Perhaps if you doubled the recipe, like some other reveiwers did, it would be a little more like a cake. I will try that next time. I might also add a little cinnamon, because I like cinnamon in practically anything. I highly reccomend trying the milk chocolate chunks or chips. Wonderful flavor, quite different from semisweet chocolate. A nice variation.

All in all, this cake was tasty and very simple to make.  I did not have unsalted butter on hand, so used regular and omitted the salt.  I think the something missing may be vanilla extract?  I did notice that, too.  Mine also turned out rather thin, more like banana chocolate chip snack bars. They still tasted great, and that's what's really important, right?

The flavor of this cake was nice, but it was dry. If I were to make it again, I might increase the milk content and make sure the batter 'flowed' a little more.

I didn’t read the reviews either, but did add 3 very ripe bananas, and some chopped pecans. Definitely would double and/or use baking soda instead of powder next time to make it more cake-like thickness wise. Made the whole house smell amazing, and was scrumptious! Turned out nice and moist too.

This is one of our favorite cakes that my children ask for on their birthdays! I make a chocolate icing on the stove and top the cake with it.

It's one of those where you taste the batter and can't wait for it to be done. So good.  Doubled the recipe. I freeze bananas whole as they get old and thawed 7 of them to use in this. Splash of vanilla and soda instead of powder. Baked at 350 for about 40 mins in 9 X 13 pan. Yum yum yum. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this cake with the suggestions of doubling recipe and using baking  soda in place of baking powder. I also added a teaspoon cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg. The cake tasted good, used up my bananas and gave me a chocolate treat.

This cake was delicious! I followed others advice and doubled the recipe to make a double- layer cake. The first time, I made two 8in round cakes and had a little leftover. The second time I made two 9x9 square cakes and it came out perfectly! When doubling the recipe, use 3 bananas (if you want the banana flavor to really come through). The first time, I only used two and it was just a hint of banana. I also recommend adding a tsp or two of vanilla.

Instead of 2/3 cup sugar, I used 1/3 white and 2/3 brown for a nice rich colour and flavour. I divided the batter into two smaller cake moulds and baked it for an extra 10 minutes. Turned out lovely, moist, and would definitely make it again.

Made it using white chocolate chips due to a shopping error. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly (it did cry out for a little vanilla extract, an I gave in). It came out perfect!  Moist, great banana flavor and the white chocolate were pretty good. Can’t wait to try the semi-sweet chocolate chips!  Oh, and to the question of too thin, I thought it was just right.

OMG this cake is awesome! I was looking for something different to do with my too ripe bananas besides banana bread or muffins. I used an 8x8 pan like others suggested, whole wheat flour, 3 bananas, and a pinch of nutmeg. Hubby loved it and wants me to definitely make it again! Thanks for the great recipe.

I used 4 large very ripe bananas, which came to 2 cups mashed. As a result the batter was quite liquidy, so it took longer to set in the over - more like 40 min.  (I baked it in a 9 x 13 rectangular pan.)

Delicious! This is by far the best banana cake I’ve made in recent years. In all fairness I did take the advice of Sara and and even changed that where I used a little less of the white sugar that she mentions. Perfect , moist, absolutely delicious cake. Tipped it with just a sprinkle of confectioners sugar. Will be my new go to banana cake for sure.

Doubled it, cooked for 40 min, used baking soda instead of powder, plus 3 very ripe bananas.  booked it with sifted cocoa.  Everyone at work loved it.   Bottom was more cake like where the top was more bread pudding like.  Still a great outcome.   will do again.

This cake is delicious! I doubled the recipe and used a 9 x 13 pan, and instead of frosting I let the handful of leftover chocolate chips melt on the top and I spread them over it. My mom and I couldn’t resist the smell and had a piece before I thought to take a picture.

Made a few changes after reading the reviews..used two eggs and 3 bananas...also I didn't have chocolate chips handy so I used chopped figs and blueberries and dusted them with cinnamon and brown sugar. Turned out a very soft and dense cake and amazing flavour..

I followed the recipe as written.  My "cake" did not rise much and it was slightly dense - although the flavor was there.   I will definitely make again with a little altering.

I made it exactly as directed. It was just okay. It was too dense and not cake-like.  (Maybe it should have called for baking soda not powder?) It was more like a bar in that size of a pan. It didn't taste sweet enough. The chocolate chips saved it enough that the family still ate it. Would not do this recipe again.

Would definitely make it again. I decided to double it and bake in the 9 x 13 pan after reading the other reviews.  I used baking soda instead of baking powder as suggested by other reviewers. I substituted 2/3 of the flour with whole wheat flour because I was out of white flour. I also forgot to mix in the chocolate chips. So I just sprinkled 2 handfuls of chocolate chips on top. I only had half the required butter on hand so I added some olive oil to make up the difference. Cake was moist and delicious!

Very yummy! I give this 4 stars because I followed the "most helpful positive review" and adjusted the sugar and chocolate chips to 1 cup each and used 1+1/2 tsp. baking soda. I always find it helpful to read a lot of reviews since I am not very experienced, and that is why I sometimes make changes to the original recipe. Also, the difference here between a banana cake and bread was not extreme imo.  With the changes, definitely 5 star.

I followed the recipe exactly and in my opinion its a very good moist cake  .... mine rise up about an inch wich that wasn't a problem for me . I was looking for an alternative to the classic banana loaf I usually make (also from this site) and this recipe fit the bill .

Followed recipe exactly. This was not a cake. It did not rise. It had the consistency of a dense bar. The flavor was ok but I was expecting a cake. This recipe as written is not correct.

I followed the suggested modifications by Sara in the "Most helpful positive review." Except I accidentally used three bananas instead of two, used kefir instead of regular milk and no butterscotch chips, all chocolate. Still turned out good!

This took about 10 minutes to make and was excellent.  I used a smaller pan, and I added a dash of cinnamon, but otherwise made it exactly as the recipe stated. It was  light and fluffy, moist and delicious, with a great buttery banana flavour. I will make this again,  and again!

I made cupcakes instead & baked for 20 minutes.  This was simply the best cupcakes I ever made from scratch.  Dense, but moist cake!  Huge hit with my family.  The chocolate chips were evenly distributed.  And the best part was: I didn't even use bananas!

Love this recipe, I will definitely make this again and again.. I did follow a few reviews that said to use soda instead of powder and I also added vanilla to the recipe. I doubled the recipe and used a 9 by 13 pan and baked for 40 minutes. I also made a cream cheese frosting and oh my god such a yummy dessert the whole house loves it..

Says to bake it in a 9X13 pan but it came out really short. Will probably make it again but put it in an 8X8 pan instead.

After having read the reviews, I made the recommended modifications to the recipe, along with a few other changes based on personal preference and food sensitivities in the family: I used coconut sugar in place of white sugar, applesauce in place of egg, almond milk in place of milk, and salted Earth Balance buttery spread in place of the butter and salt.  Baked as muffins at 350 for 35 minutes.   These turned out as very tasty little cupcakes!  I plan to make this for my daughter's first birthday!  :)

Really good. I noticed a lot of people had the chips congregate in one area of the cake so i used mini chips and it came out perfectly distributed. I used corn oil instead if butter or margarine in an effort not to have saturated fat, and I always reduce the sugar to at least 2/3 of what the recipe calls for.  I doubled the recipe and it was gone within 24 hrs!

I made a few additions like instead of 1 egg I added 1 more to make it 2 eggs , 3 bananas over ripe and an applesauce instead of sugar 3/4 cup of flour instead of 1&1/2 cup.  Added blueberries with chocolate chips!  It's phenomenal!

after reading the reviews I made a couple changes.  I used 1 cup of dark brown sugar instead of white, I also added a tsp of baking soda, and I had bananas frozen and I'm sure was just over 2 cups.  I also omitted the milk, added some toffee bits and milk chocolate chips.  had to bake an extra 15 mins in 8x8 pan.  turned out perfect!  nice and moist.  wasn't flat, dry, too sweet or anything like that.  I got tons of frozen bananas so will definitely make again.

So good! But as always, I read the reviews and followed some o the advice of those that rated this recipe high.
- Used an 8x8 pan
- Added extra sugar
- Added Vanilla Extract
- Baked a little longer than 30 minutes - watch it carefully - it did need more than 30, but I also left it in a itty bitty bit too long - still turned out deliciouls though.
Also, I din't have any un-salted butter, so mine was salted and turned out just fine
I  kept a teenie bit of the mashed banana aside and put that into my cream cheese frosting recipe, so that worked good as well

I followed this recipe without reading the reviews. The cake is flat but I really like it that way. 
I made it a second time follow a review to use baking soda instead or baking powder. The cake came out fluffier. It's definitely better. I also increased the chocolate to 1 cup with 1 teaspoon of vanilla. 

Very good.

Loved this cake. Very happy to find something to do with overripe bananas. Sweet enough to not need frosting, but some might still like it added.

I had slightly overripe bananas and chocolate chips, but no loaf pan, so chose to make this cake instead of banana bread.  I'm glad I did!  It is delicious, and very moist.  Mine came out somewhere between a cake, a quick bread, and a bar...when I presented it to my family, I called it "snack cake", and I think that pretty much describes it.  I did not need to double the recipe; it came out perfectly in the 9 x 13 pan, if slightly thinner than a regular cake.  I followed the recipe pretty much as written, except that I upped the chocolate chips to 1 cup, the sugar to 1 cup (we love sweets) and threw in some vanilla.  This is a winner and though I am not usually a big cake person, I would make this over banana bread again anytime!

Made this for my son's birthday cake. It was crumbly, dry, and a little bitter ?? 
Made it in a 5" pan, mini donut pan, and a large 12" spring form pan. I really don't know where I could have gonam wrong because I made it two times.

This was very tasty.  However, for me it was much too sweet.  I find it amazing that other people suggested increasing the amount of sugar!  If I made it again, I would definitely cut back on the sugar.

Yum! I added chocolate chips to only half of the batch since my parents don't like chocolate, and everyone in the family enjoyed them in a cupcake form. I did what some of what was suggested (added 1 c. sugar and 1 tsp. vanilla) and they came out super moist! I made sure not to over mix because the banana mashed with a forked adds nice texture.

This cake came out moist and fluffy.  I followed the directions and also added 1 tea spoon of vanilla. I did also use a small cake pan.  It was yummy.

Made this twice and it was great both times.  The second time I made it I doubled everything but the butter (using 3 large bananas).  I used 3/4 cup butter and 1/4 peanut butter.  I also switched the baking powder for baking soda and added 2 teaspoons of vanilla.  Baked in 9 X 13 pan.  Yummy!!

I made this cake twice in one week.  My husband absolutely loves it.  when the cake is done baking, I add the rest of the chocolate chips that are in the bag to the top of the cake and allow them to melt, then spread them over the top of the cake.  Delicious!!!

Delicious and the only things I did change was that I used a smaller, 8x8 pan and then dusted the cake with powdered sugar just before serving.  I made it the night before and then cooled it and let it sit covered tightly in the fridge till the next day.  The banana flavor was perfect!

Made this yesterday because we are heading to our trailer today.  Tested it last night for dinner and really liked it.  I baked it in an 8" pan  and it was thick enough to top it with some chocolate.  When it came out of the oven I spread chocolate chips on top and when they melted spread it out like icing.  It would be dressed up for company serving with a scoop of ice cream.

This was yummy!  I followed several other reviews and did make some changes, so this review is really more for me to remember what I changed.  I doubled the recipe, used half white and half brown sugar (1 cup each), half baking soda and half baking powder, 2 tsp vanilla, and for the butter, I used half butter (1 stick) and half apple sauce (1/2 cup). I also used half chocolate and half butterscotch chips. I baked the cake in a 9x13 for about 40 mins, and dusted the top with powdered sugar once it cooled. It was a hit with my family.

I made this in a deep heart-shaped pan for a special occasion. It is about the size of an 8x8 square pan. I used the Creamy Chocolate Frosting on this site. Rather than 1-1/2 teaspoons baking powder, I used 1 tsp. baking powder and 1/2 tsp. soda. Also upped the sugar to 3/4 cup. These were suggestions made by other cooks. We enjoyed it.

Used the recipe as is, but baked it in a loaf tin, very nice! enjoyed it very much, due to its simpleness and the amount of over-ripe bananas we always end up with I will no doubt be making this again.

Moist and tasty but it's a very flat cake. Will make again but will increase the recipe by 50% for a 13" X 9" pan.

I modified it by adding a teaspoon of vanilla, used baking soda in place of baking powder, and I used 1/4 cup plain yogurt in place of the milk. It came out very rich and sweet. I may lower the sugar next time.

Delicious and moist! Very easy no fail recipe.  Used baking soda instead of powder. Added walnuts for some crunch. Baked in 9 X 9 pan and it came out thick and cake like. if you use 9 X 13 double recipe to get thick cake result. Great alternative to banana bread.

I will definitely make it again. I made a few changes: I doubled ingredients except the sugar. I used 1 cup of dark brown sugar, which kept it from tasting overly sweet. I used baking soda instead of powder. I also added 1 1/2 cup of dried cranberries. It was very moist and quite tasty, although next time, I'll try adding 2 or 2 1/2 cups of the dried cranberries. Oh, I went ahead and used the whole 12 ounce package of the semi-sweet chocolate chips because there weren't many left in the bag after doubling.

This is wonderful. I doubled the recipe. I used 2 teaspoons backing powder, 1 teaspoon baking soda, 1 cup dark chocolaty chips, 1 cup milk chocolate chips,  1 cup walnuts, and 1 teaspoon vanilla. This is my new banana bread. I know this is cake and some say it resembles  bars, I say, whatever you want to call it. This is simply amazing. Definitely award winning!!!

A success with my fruit hating family. They didn't even ask for frosting or toppings. However I just increased the quantity of bananas a bit so we had an amazingly moist and delightful cake. I made it in a smaller loaf pan so it was OK for the size.

I'm always looking for a new way to use my leftover bananas. This recipe was good, but I think I prefer banana/chocolate chip muffins or donuts to this cake. I don't know, it's just a texture thing for me, I guess. I made no changes to the recipe though, and cake turned out nicely.

I used white whole wheat flour which gave it a bit of a grainier texture, but added fiber.  I also used melted coconut oil instead of the butter and added an extra banana over the amount called for.  It turned out great, and my kids wanted seconds!!!  I may add some vanilla and maybe a touch of cinnamon next time since it tasted a little bland.  Good recipe overall, however!

Didn't read any reviews and made the recipe exactly as listed and my fiancé and I loved it. I like that it was more thin like bars. Definitely recommend this. It's delicious. Not overly sweet.

Loved it! Made some changes and it was better than my famous banana bread recipe.  I doubled it, switched the baking powder for baking soda, I  used a whole bag of choc chips and added vanilla. It was perfect and no icing necessary.

I made this recipe exactly as it is written, and it came out perfect. I was looking for muffins for my kids' breakfast and pleasing them isnt always easy...but they loved them! Well, ok, maybe I dumped a little extra chocolate chips in, but I still say its perfect as is.

YUM! This will be my go to recipe when I want to make something fast and easy with over ripened bananas. So moist and flavorful and didn't need frosting.

I made this cake today. I baked it in a 9 X 9 pan, and I increased the sugar to 3/4 cup, used 3 large bananas. baked for 40 minutes in 350 oven. it's great without icing! it's a dense cake but is sweet and I'll make it again and again!

Amazing!!! I always substitute baking soda for baking powder- the same amount as the recipe states. Comes out nice and fluffy and delicious.

Loved it. I was afraid that the bananas would gaste too strong so I added a little more chocolate and it worked! I would just add more banking powder so that it grows more....

This is a good recipe. I read reviews and decided to use vanilla in the batter and I had some white chocolate chips that I used with the semi sweet. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and didn't double it at all but I used an 8 by 8 pan and with using that I got the cake to be thicker rather than thin. Using a 9 by 13 is guaranteed to give you thin  cake unless you double. Doubling isn't necessary if you use a smaller pan. The bake time was right on at 35 minutes.

This a wonderful recipe. I made some small changes in the recipe by adding three bananas and 1 tsp of vanilla extract. The cake came out to be fluffy with mild flavour. We all enjoyed the cake. thanks for the recipe.

Turned out nice and moist. I followed some other reviewers' advice and used baking soda instead of baking powder. I used 2 bananas. I baked it in an 8x11 dish. Will make again!

Do not bake this cake in a 9 x 13 pan as the recipe states. It spreads out too much resulting in a flat, thin pizza-like cake. I used an 8x8 pan. I also cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and substituted dried cranberries for the chocolate chips.

Wonderful! I followed suggestions and used 1c sugar and 1/2 c milk chocolate chips and 1/2 butterscotch chips. I also used a non-bleached flour. It was fantastic! Very flavorful, light and moist. A great way to use up brown bananas!

I have made this several times and I have finally perfected it. I doubled the sugar, flour, egg, milk and butter. And I baked in a 13x9 pan. I also added a tsp. of vanilla and a tsp. of cinnamon. And I used baking soda instead of the powder, like our reviewers said. Very yummy! I could eat the whole thing myself if I am not careful.

As a Banana Chocolate Chip Bread I would say it is a 5 star.  Kept to the recipe, except I only had 1/2 cup of chocolate chips.  Which I think was good, with more it would have been hard to taste the banana.

Overall a good recipe but because i read many other recipes, i decided to add some tweaks n it came out superb! I added 30 ml of sour cream, 1/4 tsp of cinnamon n 1/4 tsp of nutmeg. Also I used 1/2 cup brown sugar n 1/3 white sugar. Then i crushed walnuts n sprinkle right at the bottom of the greased pan. This gives the cake a nice crunchy crust when you flip it over. Lastly, bake in a 8 x 8 pan or the cake will come out too flat. So good!

The flavor of this was really good.  The kids gobbled it up..I think though that it would work better for me in muffin form so the kids can just grab their own.  Watch the cooking time though, mine took closer to 40 minutes.  Thanks for sharing.

Very moist and flavorful. I made cupcakes out of the batter, was able to make almost 24. Baked at 350 for 24 mins. Used the suggestions provided by the most helpful user and changed the sugar to 1c, used 1.5 tsp of baking soda and .5 tsp of baking powder. Will up the amount of chocolate chips to 1 cups as I kept it at .75 c this time. Thanks for a wonderful recipe Debbie.

I also did what the other reviews suggested, doubled the recipe,used soda instead of powder, but added 1/2 a bag of milk choc. chips and 1/2 a bag of peanut butter chips! Super good, moist, but would only cook for 30-35 min and check. I did 40 minutes and the bottom was just a little dark. Still very tasty, best banana cake I have made in a while. 9 X 13 pan, sprayed with Pam and doesn't need frosting. Kacey

I just made this recipe, although I took one reviewers advice and used an 8 x 8 pan. I also used dark chocolate chips, since that's what I had on hand. I was trying to use up bananas that were overripe. It took 2 of them to make the cup called for in the recipe. I was very happy with the end result. I plan to cut it up into bars, much like brownies, and serve it up that way. Yummy. And a good way to use up bananas!

This cake was absolutely delicious and gone in a matter of hours!  As others have said, the cake turns out very thin (perfect if you want bars) if you don't either double the recipe or use a smaller pan.  I think I'd prefer to double it next time--it's just that good!  If you don't have the ingredients to do that, just use a 9x9 pan.  It was a little boring on top, so I'd suggest dropping a few chocolate chips on top for color, or garnishing with confectioner's sugar.  I loved that it was so moist and not the traditional banana bread flavor.

I learned my lesson on this one -- even if something is really highly rated, read the reviews!  I've got a cake that is 1/2 inch tall -- had I read even one of the reviews, I could have avoided that outcome.

This was a tremendously good recipe!  I doubled this and put it in a 9x13 and thought it was a perfect amount for that size dish.  It's a nice variation on Banana bread.  I recommend a few more chocolate chips.  I used more bananas than suggested by the recipe (I had about five pounds I needed to use-so this recipe was on my banana adventure path).  I also added 1/2 a cup of brown sugar.  I think I will be making this one again.

This cake is fantastic!!! I changed a few things, as other's had mentioned - I doubled the recipe, added 2 tsp's, of vanilla, baking soda instead of powder and I used a stick of regular salted butter and 1/2 Cup of oil. I baked it in a bundt pan for close to 60 minutes.  It's very moist, flavorful and delicious.  I will be making this a lot in the future.

My family loved this recipe!  I doubled it, used baking soda instead of baking powder, and added a bit of cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla, then baked it in a bundt pan at 325 for an hour.  (check with a toothpick).  It sat for about 10 min., then I turned it out onto a cooling rack and dusted it with powdered sugar.  So pretty!! Also, I used 5 ripe bananas that had been in my freezer, and it tasted great.

I also used baking soda instead of baking powder.  I took this to a bbq and it was quite a hit.

Great recipe, I was surprised with the flavour, considering I did not add spices! I doubled the recipe. I may add vanilla next time, but not necessary. Thanks for posting!

This is the easiest cake recipe I've ever made! I've now made it 3 times and each time everyone loved it! That said - I took everyone's advice and used a smaller pan or doubled the recipe when I needed. I have it in the oven now and can't wait to have some. YUM

Great cake and very easy. Baked it in a 9 inch pan, didn't add the chocolate chips but did make as a "poke" cake by pouring instant chocolate pudding on the top. Delicious!

Great snack cake.  I only had salted butter, and I used mini semi-sweet chocolate chips.  Doesn't need icing. Enjoyed it!

I doubled recipe and put in 9x13 pan. All same ingredients as recipe calls for. Baked for about 50 minutes. Really good, and will for sure make again. My kids really love it.

I followed the advice of a lot of the other reviewers and used baking soda instead of powder, most of 3 very ripe bananas, a full cup of sugar (actually 1/2 cup Splenda and 1/2 cup sugar) and 1 tsp vanilla.  Also, as I had bits of both on hand, I used half chocolate and half white chocolate chips.  Because of all the confusion over the pan size and because I wanted to give these to two different people, I made muffins.  It made 16 muffins - not 24 servings as the recipe states.  Hubby thinks these are very good!

This was incredible! I'm not a big banana fan, but this was wonderful.  I baked it in an 8X8 pan, per other suggestions, and used milk chocolate chips - because I don't like semi-sweet.

This was yummy, quick and easy. I followed this recipe almost exactly, only I had 5 black bananas to use, so I mashed them all, about 2 cups worth. Also, my butter was salted & my chips were milk choc. I used a 9x13 pan and baked for about 10- 15 minutes more then called for. I thought they were the perfect thickness, about the size of a brownie and super moist and banana-y. These got better and better as they cooled on my counter!!

When I baked this cake my mom was all over it!!! The only thing I changed was adding a little less sugar and less chocolate chips. But, overall it was very tasty for the first time making it.

Great Recipe - I did double the recipe for a 9x13 pan as other reviewers suggested and added Vanilla.  This came out wonderfully.  It did not need frosting and was made with basic ingredients that you have in the cupboard - Great recipe!

This was great and easy!!!!!!!  I did not use all the butter, I used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup apple sauce, also used fat free milk, and dark chocolate chips, and used 3 bananas.  So good served with fat free cool whip, thanks for the recipe.  Update from 04/19 made cake again but this time frosted with chocolate frosting, so good.

This is really, really GOOD. I did tweak by adding 1 tsp vanilla, switching to baking soda instead of powder, upped the sugar to 1 cup and used milk chocolate chips since I don't care for semi-sweet. And since I don't have an 8x8 pan I used a 9x13 and it's definitely thin but that certainly doesn't detract from the incredible taste and moist consistency. I had two bananas and rather than measuring, I just used those and you can taste the banana. I'll get an 8x8 and use it next time but this cake would taste great no matter what the shape!

I tried a healthier version, and it is fantastic.  Insted of 1.5 c  of white flour, I used 1/2 c. white, 1/2 wheat flour, and 1/2 c. flax seed.  I used only 1/c c. of sugar.  I also added a bit more bananas.  Perfection!!!

This HAS to be made in a different pan!!! I made this exactly as the recipe states, and it was only an inch tall, if that. The taste was good; the texture was moist. It just wasn't that thick. IF I make this again, I'll make it in a 8x8 and see if it is better that way.

I tried this recipe after I read some of the reviews.  It's a very simple, easy recipe to follow and a snap to put together in a hurry.  Like the other reviewers I made some slight changes.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla, a cup and a half of bananas and a cup of milk chocolate chips.  I used the other ingredients in the amounts listed.  I also used an 8 x 8 inch pan.  I had to cook it a bit longer than called for in the recipe, but the cake came out very moist and not overly sweet.

I made this into banana / chocolate chip bread. Greased a loaf pan and baked at 350 for 60 - 65 minutes. Very good. Used two ripe banana's. Baking soda insdead of powder. Didn't have any vanilla extract and it tasted just fine without it,, although I would have added it if I had it. Kid friendly.. two 5 year olds helped me make.

My cake turned out thin, even after applying Sara's suggestion. I'll try it again though because it tasted really good. Next time, I'll double the ingredients.

YUM! I took the other reviewers advice and used baking soda instead of powder and baked it in a 9x9 pan. Thick, not too dense, super moist...my daughter said, "you're going to need to make this more often!" Great replacement for tired old banana bread!!!

Wow! I love this cake. I actually made this recipe AS DIRECTED, without any changes, additions or substitutions...that's pretty amazing for me :-) This came out very light and fluffy and was a perfect snack cake, no frosting needed. What a great way to use up some bananas--definitely better than the same old banana bread! This might even be good as a layer cake with some chocolate cream cheese frosting, but I would decrease the chips in the cake if I were going to do that...I'll have to try it next time I've got some overly ripe bananas. Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome cake!!  I took suggestions from other reviewers and baked in a 9x9 square pan for 35 minutes.  My chips all sunk to the bottom, but it didn't effect the overall taste.  Next time, and oh yes there will be a next time, I'm going to substitute applesauce for the butter and see how it turns out.  Love the cake, but I hate the high calories.

I made this for my roomie's birthday, since  he loves pretty much any banana bread. I made a few additions/changes, but it came out wonderfully moist and yummy. 
I doubled the recipe and baked the cake in a slightly smaller pan. 
I took another reviewers' advice and used baking soda instead of baking powder and it came out perfect.
The roomie really likes banana, so I used a little more than usual(about 2-1/4 cups for a doubled recipe), increased the chocolate chips to 2 cups, and used 1-1/2 cups of sugar.

Needless to say, the guys were fighting over the last piece!

Very good!  I used 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup splenda.  I also used dark chocolate chips and as someone else suggested put chocolate pudding on top.

This is the easiest banana cake recipe I've ever used, and it is a huge hit with friends and family. My bananas were very over-ripe, so I didn't need to mash them separately, making it even easier. Great recipe!

This was very good but I think that I will stick to the banana choc chip bars from the betty crocker cookbook, they are more dense which I like.

I don't know why, but I think it tastes like chocolate chip pancakes.  with bananas.  which I think is absolutely fabulous!  I made it thin, I'm not really sure why but I liked it.  three ripe mashed bananas.  was gooey and delicious, and I ate about a sixth of it before anyone else had a bite.

Yum! This was delicious, but I think there was a little too much butter in this recipe, it could have been reduced by a couple tablespoons (and maybe replaced with applesauce). Also, using baking soda instead might have been a good idea.  I added vanilla and used half light brown sugar. It came out really moist.

Great quick cake.  I cannot bake, I'm terrible and I pulled this off.  I doubled the recipe for the 9 x 12 pan and got a nice cake that was great after dinner with a cup of coffee or tea.  I'll be making this again for a nice simple cake.  I'd even bring it to a potluck.

this turned out just the way i like it: crispy on outside and moist on inside. this was my first time baking anything and it went off without a hitch. Following the reviews, I doubled the recipe. I also added a tsp of vanilla. Will definitely make again!

Great recipe!  My daughter and a friend made their own small batches, colored them with food coloring and baked them in small pans. They were almost cookie-like, which is great for kids, and the banana  added great flavor!

This tasted like a cakey banana bread. I didn't have chocolate chips on hand so I added a table spoon or two of hot chocolate mix to the batter. It's good but I was expecting something a little less bland.

Very easy and tasty recipe.  I was a bit concerned because of the other reviews that said it was dry.  I did not find that at all!  Served with cream cheese icing.  Delicious!  A nice alternative for using those over-ripe bananas.  Will definitely be making again.  Thanks!

Changes that worked for me... 1 cup sugar, 4 medium bananas, 1/3 cup skim milk and butterscotch chips.  I also used the 11x7 Pyrex baking dish and 35 minutes was perfect.  Frosting would make this too sweet.

I didn't think that this cake had alot of flavor.  I used cake flour to give it a fluffier texture, but it could use more sugar and bananas.  I see that other reviewers have said so.  I should have read the reviews first!!  Also, I would make a double batch next time because the cake was a little thin.

Very good.  I made it in a square pan and it didn't change the baking time at all.  It does seem more like bars than cake.  This is a great simple recipe.

I was looking for a really creamy sticky banana cake recipe, so I cut down the flour to 1 cup.  It came out absolutely delicious!  No problems with flatness (as other reviewers have mentioned), but I used a 9" pie pan instead.  I also used a combination of semisweet and white chocolate chips.

I helped my 8 year old daughter make this recipe herself.  This is her review:
"It turned out pretty good.  It was a little bit flat but still tasted yummy.  We added a few extra chocolate chips because I really love chocolate chips and so does my brother.  I would make this again sometime soon."

I read the other reviews about how thin the cake was, so I used a round cake pan to make it more like a cake.  This cake is okay for a quick way to whip up something sweet for the kids.  Not one of my favorites but I will make it again.

Thought this recipe would be a great way to use up 3 leftover bananas; easy to make; baked in a bundt pan, came out wonderful; there just wasn't much taste to it; tastes like it's lacking something...

This is an excellent banana cake, moist and dense and lightly sweet.  My children love it and ask for it often.  I've made this cake several times and am never disappointed.

This was banana bread baked in a cake pan with chocolate chips added.  I don't know why I was expecting something different after reading the recipe but this was nothing special.  It had a good flavor but there are better recipes for banana bread.

Sorry, but this cake was not very good.  It was kind of bitter, and I even used a 1/2 cup extra (very ripe) banana.  I tried to make it better by putting chocolate frosting on it, but it didn't help.  Even my kids didn't like it.  Maybe an icing would have been better.

This was an ok cake.  It used up my over ripe bananas.....that was the best thing about it.

"VERY" easy to make.  Something that would be good to do with your children.

I don't know what happened, but this cake did not rise when I baked it.
I really had to spread the batter to cover the bottom of the pan, which makes me
think that it should be in an 8 or 9 inch pan instead.  Anyway, it was a complete 
disappointment.
