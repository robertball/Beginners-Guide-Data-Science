This was pretty good. I didn't use wings - I just used breasts.  I used all of the ingredients to scale but I added just a touch of sesame oil and a little more brown sugar.  I was kinda worried that it would just taste like BBQ sauce but it didn't! :P The chicken was nice and tender and I would definitely use this recipe again when I'm sick of my "other" chicken recipe.    And another thing: I used the recipe for only two bigger breasts and that was just enough.  If you want a lot of sauce for four people  I would double the recipe, especially if you decide to reduce the sauce a little.

i was disapointed in this dish.  my wife and i both agreed there was nothing we found oriental about this at all.  the dish itself was good, but it is more like a sweet chiken, maybe add a little hot sauce for a kick.  chicken was very tender and enjoyable, made it on a bed of rice.

My boyfriend (who happens to be Chinese) loved these wings and said that they tasted very Oriental!  I made them for him for Chinese New Year, but I will definitely make them again since we both loved them!

Very good recipe using chicken wings. The meat nearly fell off the bone - very tender. Nice change of pace instead of plain old baked chicken!

I had more meat than sauce (my fault - not the recipie's) but I found this dish very tasty. Would like to make it again when I have enough orange juice. I didn't have enough chicken for everyone so I made it over pork and found that worked well too...

I use boneless chicken breast cut into strips...it works great, and my children love it.  Serve it over rice, and it makes a great meal.  I tweak the seasoning to make it my own recipe, but left on it's own...it really is good!
