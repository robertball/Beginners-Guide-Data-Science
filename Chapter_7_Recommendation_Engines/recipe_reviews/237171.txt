I've made these cookies several times for my daughter who has celiac disease and is a nursing mom. She loves them, and fortunately will share them! You don't have to be a nursing mom to enjoy these cookies!

I've never made cookies with a base of chickpeas before in my life. These came together quickly and were surprisingly delicious! I added about a 1/4 tsp. of salt, but otherwise they were perfect!

They are a healthy, tasty option for lactation cookies. They are moist, so I added 1/4 cup of gluten free flour to the mix, and that helped.

Vegan Gluten-free Lactation Cookies Haiku: "Very 'wet' cookie, but I think they tasted great. Kept well in the fridge." Made recipe as written only I subbed 1/4 c. coconut oil & 1/4 c. applesauce for the peanut butter. The cookies completely fall apart after being baked, but I liked the taste alot, and I kept them in the fridge for a little over a week eating one in the morning, and one in the afternoon. Now whether or not they've increased my milk supply, I'm not sure, only b/c I'm also drinking Mother's Milk tea, and I made up a lactation zucchini muffin recipe too, but hey, if my baby's mursing well and I get to eat yummy things in b/t, then all is good w/ me!
