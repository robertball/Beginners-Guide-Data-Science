With the exception of putting it on the upper level of the oven.  I found that @ 450 degrees this browned it way to fast.  I would cook it at 350 and then a little higher at the end to darken the color of the skin.  Other than that it was a hit at my home.  I will make it again.

This recipe is great.  I made a one as a test before Thanksgiving, and then made some modifications and made a full batch for Thanksgiving.  Salt water bath made all of the difference.  Had to turn down heat and cook longer like most others.  Also, take the vinegar and jam mixture and multiply it by 4 if you want enough to bast with, otherwise you pan will run dry and burn up. I did not use the nuts like most others as well.  The hens came out with a great flavor, tender, the meat was almost falling off the bone before I could transfer them to the serving tray.

The Cornish Game Hens had a nice sweet crispy apricot glazed skin and the breast meat was tender and juicy with a nice hint of citrus zest. I would recommend lowering the temperature and covering with foil to begin and finishing up with roasting it on the 450 temperature. I added the pistachio nuts to cook with the dressing instead of adding it at the end and it softened up the nuts nicely for those who do not like the crunch.

This turned out extremely well although the "Stuffing" was a bit on the oniony side. I used 4x the amount of apricot jam and only 2x the amount of vinegar and it turned out great. The birds were slightly sweet and outstanding. Cooking temp should be 350 for 45 minutes and 390 for 5-10.

These hens are a wonderful holiday or company entree making a lovely presentation. I'm glad I read the other reviews; even at 350-degrees the hens started to get dark brown before they were cooked through, so tenting with foil may be needed. Keep a watch on them. Also, there is not an abundance of fruit or pan juices, so if you like lots, you might want to increase the amount of fruit and deglaze the pan with chicken broth or white wine at the end. Definitely worth making!

The Cornish hens made a wonderful Christmas Day dinner.  We adjusted the time and temperature according to a previous reviewer.  And, as suggested by others, we ultimately covered the hens with foil to keep them from browning too quickly.  With regard to the dressing, it burned a little, but we were able to salvage enough in the end.

I wish I would have read the comments regarding the recipe.  It did brown too quickly.  I ended up tenting with aluminum foil to avoid over browning.  I didn't use the pistachio garnish on the side.  Not much juice left and decided it wasn't necessary.  The Hens were delicious and tender, tasty all the way through.  I will use this recipe again cook at a lower temp. and leave out the parsley and pistachioâ€™s.

This was delicious!  I made it in place of a traditional turkey for Thanksgiving and we really enjoyed it.  I didn't use the pistachios and parsley and like others, I lowered the cooking temperature to about 375 then turned it up to 400 for the last 5 minutes.

I was impressed with how the Cornish hen came out (tasty, moist, very yummy) However, although we love all of the ingredients in the apricot pistachio dressing, it was just 'okay'.  Noting other reviews, I turned down the oven temp to 375 and had no problems.  Would make the Cornish hen recipe again without the dressing.

I used this recipe for a post-Christmas dinner for my in-laws. I wanted something different from the tried and true turkey and dressing or ham. My family LOVED it. You will definitely need more of the glaze; it's so good. I'm thinking of using the glaze as a substitute for barbeque sauce this summer when we grill chicken or pork. My mother-in-law complimented me on this dish by saying it looked like something you'd get at a fancy restaurant. I beamed! Very tasty, easy to prepare and makes a GREAT presentation.

This recipe was amazing! I only made 2 hens and didn't split them. I used as suggested a pre-heated oven at 350 for one hour and basted every 15 minutes.  I then broiled them at the end for about 5 minutes. I garnished with the parsley but left out the nuts. I also paired this with an apple stuffing which was great.  Also, I swapped out the white onion for green onion as my husband is not a fan of onion.  My husband is never afraid to tell me he doesn't like something and he loved this. I doubled the glaze because he likes a lot of sauce.  I've never made a turkey or roasted chicken so I thought this would be good practice!

Loved this recipe. I was not able to use the pistachio as there was a recall on them at the time. I cooked them on the lower rack at 350 degree for 1hr after an hour I basted a few times  and cooked another hour. When it browned to the way I liked it I just made a tent with foil and put it over the hens until done cooking.  My husband loved it! I did to beautiful and very tasty. Perfect main dish to impress guest.

This was a crowd pleaser.  I took the advise of previous cooks and cooked them at 350 for 1 hour on the lower oven rack. Did not add the pistashios or parsley. But they turned out great. Very moist.

These were spectacular! Reading the reviews, I did make changes- I only baked 2 hens, I did not halve the glaze- the original recipe yielded just enough for the 2. Baked them at 375, 400 for last 10 minutes, with a foil tent. Did not broil them, as they were already a  perfect golden brown. Left the pistachio part out. I also threw some chunked yellow potatoes with evoo and salt into the pan, surrounding birds, and they came out perfect! They soaked up some of the yummy glaze flavor. My husband tore it all up!

I didn't have time to brine the hens for the whole two hours.  I had to cook these longer than an hour since they were still slightly frozen.  But, the dish was good overall.

This was excellent.  My husband loved it!  I baked at 375 degrees instead of 450 and the hens were very well done on the outside.  Next time I will try baking at 350 degrees for 50 minutes.

A great holiday dish; have made it on three occasions and received many compliments from guests. I agree with other reviewers about the hot oven throughout ... the birds brown/char too fast. A lower oven temperature until the last 10-15 minutes, and then a higher temp (450), works better.

I made this a couple of times with a few modifications. I lower the oven temp to 375 and cook for an hour and then broil for about 5 minutes like many others. As far as the dressing goes, I added chopped mushrooms and a prepared box of cornbread stuffing. I put the stuffing mixture in a 9 x 13 (for 2 hens) then put the hens on top of the mixture to roast. My mom is allergic to pistachios, so I used cashews. Makes for a nice crunch if you like that. Also DEFINITELY double the amount of glaze too! A keeper!

The cornish game hens stayed moist when I followed this recipe.  I only wished there was more of the apricot pistachio dressing since it goes so well and looks pretty on rice.  Next time, I will double the dressing ingredients. -Paula Akbari

This came as a wonderful Christmas dinner surprise. I took the advise of others and lowered the temp. and, added the nuts to the onion and apricot dressing. Raves all around especially with the spinach/artichoke brie bread pudding,
