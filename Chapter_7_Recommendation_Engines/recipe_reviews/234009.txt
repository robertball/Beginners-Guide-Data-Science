It is a great ice cream. It did take me three tries to make it right though. The directions say after adding the eggs to heat until thick for 10 minutes stirring constantly. Let me just say that after twice doing that, it doesn't take 10 minutes. Actually 5 minutes or less. Believe me, if you go the full 10 minutes you will get scrambled eggs every time. So 15 eggs later I finally got yummy ice cream.

I have an ice cream machine with a condenser, so I make ice cream often. This recipe is a little labor intensive, but the result was a soft, silky texture with maple candy coated walnuts. - Perfect!     I pan toasted the walnuts because it was hot outside, and I  boiled down my grade A maple syrup to get a darker, thicker liquid like grade C.  The only issue was that the custard was ready after 5 minutes instead of 10.  Constant stirring is a must.

I made this a couple of weeks ago used hickory nuts( yes I said hickory ) because I'm not a fan of walnuts. Just an FYI hickory nut are so good very mild in flavor and similar to pecans in taste. The next time I make this I will omit the nuts all together!! You see I'm French Canadian and I'm just a mapleholic! I don't need nuts in my ice cream just the pure maple taste is really all I want. I will just add the maple syrup that is used for the wet nut part w/o nuts! I'm sure it will taste great and I'm going to double up the batch! No wonder I go through 5 gallons a yr! :)

Does not even COMPARE to store bought! the amount of custard didn't look like enough for the ice cream maker but once the wet walnuts are added it almost overflows! If you have a kitchen aid attachment ice cream maker it never gets to the "clicking" stage to let you know it's ready...I just stopped after 20 mins...

Using maple sugar for the nuts instead of syrup makes an easier mixin.

Very tasty maple flavor. I like that it uses real maple syrup. I didn't use all of the nut mixture as it was a little too much for the amount of ice cream. Next time I may cut it in half.

This was fabulous, creamy and intense but not cloyingly sweet. I had trouble getting the walnuts to toast at 275. I eventually threw them in a frypan. Next time I will up the temp in the oven. I used a medium amber maple syrup from a local farm in Quebec and the richer flavor worked perfectly.

I wish I had read the reviews first, but I was in a hurry! I agree with others - the cooking only takes about 5 minutes and I got scrambled eggs the first time also.  Enjoy!

Rich and creamy with the perfect balance of maple and walnut. I use agave nectar instead of corn syrup, which adds a nice nutty note. To prevent curdling of the custard, (i) heat your saucepan before putting the milk and sugar mixture into it and, (ii) after slowly pouring the tempered egg yolks in, stir and cook until steam rises and turn off heat; (iii) let the saucepan sit on the burner for 75 seconds (always stirring) before straining into the cream; and (iv) put mixture into the ice bath. Mine is better than Molly Moonâ€™s.

Delicious! I also cooked custard too long, but strained it and it was fine. I left out the corn syrup. I added a pinch of smoked salt to the wet walnuts,  we loved it!!!

Amazing flavour! I toasted my walnuts in cast in the oven then finished stovetop with the syrup and a bit of butter.
I used 50/50 heavy and table cream instead of milk (what I had on hand) and divided into recipe measures for directions.
I did not add the corn syrup at all and it was plenty sweet enough.
The custard was ready between 5-6 minutes (stir constantly!) and I didn't bother straining.  Texture was really good.  I will make this again for sure!

Sounds phenomenal.  Make a lot of homemade ice  cream and plan on ttaking this to take to a dinner party.  One question is it  calls for 2 tablespoons of vinegar but does not tell you in tthe ddirections to add it so am leavingit out. NNever heard of vinegar in an ice cream recipe.

What little taste I had so far was good, but the ice cream never thickened enough to call ice cream.  I chilled a full 2 hours but I don't think I let the nuts cool enough and I added them too early to the ice cream so I think in hind sight it warmed the ice cream too much.  I put end result in the freezer and waiting to try today.
