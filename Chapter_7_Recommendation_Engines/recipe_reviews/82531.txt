I made this for breakfast at work today, and everyone really liked it.  I was a little concerned, because the egg didn't reach between slices of bread, but it got eaten up in a big fat hurry!  I did make a recipe and a half (18 slices of bread, still in a 9x13), so maybe I'll make more eggs and dip each slice next time.  The only other change I made was to use pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon.  A few soggy slices here and there, but everyone said they liked it!
