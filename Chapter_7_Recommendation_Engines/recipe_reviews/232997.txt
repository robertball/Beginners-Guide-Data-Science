If you run the baked croutons through the food processor to a fine consistancy, these will also make great "italian" bread crumbs--way better than the processed brands. THIS CAN BE FROZEN. You can also use leftover hamburger or hot dog buns and get the same result.

I made a scaled down version of these, and they came out very good.  Since oregano can have a strong taste, I'd caution you to perhaps start with going a little short on that herb--you can always add, but it's harder to take away!  Cooking time could vary depending on how dry your bread is to start with.  I took mine out of the oven when they were nicely golden brown, but they weren't quite crunchy yet.  I baked them a little more, and they almost got too done.  I liked the process of how to toss the bread cubes in the butter solution.  Thanks for adding so much flavor to our salad!

Wonderful !!  I made no changes and the one review is right on where she used minced garlic instead of the powder, but either way works.  I am a garlic lover so next time will probably use the minced garlic instead of the powder.  I highly recommend this recipe for croutons.

I made mine with leftover soft pretzel pieces I made from another recipe. The croutons turned out perfect! I doubt I'll ever pay for croutons again :-)

Yum! I've made these several times and found in a pinch that olive oil works great, too, in place or added with the butter!

The best croutons I've ever had! The only thing I changed: minced a garlic clove instead of using powder. Will be using this recipe for a long time!

Tasty and crunchy. Used last of homemade bread and followed recipe using home grown herbs. These were wonderful on the French onion soup recipe I made recently. And a few left for my next salad. One could cut down on butter and still have good flavor.

Delicious flavour.  Instead of croutons, I used sliced baquette, approx. 1/2" thick, coated both sides and toasted.  Will be making this regularly.

These have great flavors! I changed nothing besides using some of my leftover homemade bread. We ended up eating a bunch just as a snack fresh out of the oven. Yum!

Used Kaiser rolls.  Did not use any salt - otherwise as written.  They are not heavily seasoned so they're light and tasteful.   All 3 of us (ladies) found them to be delightful.

These were really good.  I added them to chicken Caesar salads for my daughter and me.  Will definitely make these again.

I made these once before, just for us, to be sure they were as great as everyone says they are.  They are!  So I've made three more batches to use on Caesar salad for our group of 25 for our Italian night coming up.  At first I used the adjust the quantity button to increase the ingredients but I changed my mind and made 3 single batches, mainly to makes sure the butter was as evenly distributed as possible.  But I baked all 3 trays together on convection, and rotated them at the 10 minute mark, as well as stirring them around a bit.  I sprinkled a bit more Parmesan cheese over them just before popping them into the oven.  Perfect!

Oh my goodness, awesome, awesome, awesome!  Loved this, couldn't believe the flavor!  I used fresh thyme from my garden & was nervous about the oregano, but it turned out great.  I unfortunately put these in the fridge worried it would spoil in the humidity, but I should have left them out because they were much better fresh from the oven. Best croutons I ever made. Thanks for sharing!

These are great.  I used frozen left-over bread (French and multi-grain) cut in cubes while still frozan, and skipped the thyme, wanting the oregano to be the main flavor.  They toasted perfectly at 325 degrees for the 15 minutes suggested.  It will be interesting to see whether they last long enough to get to my soup or salad, as I'm enjoying snacking on them plain, right now.

Outstanding! I used 3 left over potato (hamburger) buns. With the amount of bread I used, there wasn't enough butter mixture to fully coat everything so I drizzled olive oil on top before baking (and sprinkled with additional Parmesan and garlic salt).  The combined flavors of oil and butter really worked well (though I'm sure the recipe, as written, is just as good)!
