I tried this the other night for dinner and added some cubed eggplant in place of half the tomatoes. I'm glad I did, because this dish had way too much liquid. Maybe some of it should have been strained off before adding to the pie dish. Also we could hardly taste the swiss cheese. I was expecting something much more savory, but it's a good way to use up summer veggies. I'll need to tweak the recipe more to find a more satisfying flavor.

I made this to bring to work today for breakfast.  With one thing and another, it wasn't eaten for breakfast, so we did lunch.  Not everyone tried it, but my coworkers who did loved it.  One kept telling me it tasted like pizza!  I'm not sure about it, but the tomatoes did give it a saucy flavor to some extent.  I didn't have zucchini, but I did have some shredded carrots and red peppers, so I put those in instead.  I chopped the red peppers pretty finely, and I drained the tomatoes as much as I could.  I thought I had a lid for the skillet I was using, but I couldn't find it so I ended up cooking it without a lid on.  It cooked faster and carmelized the veggies a bit--a happy accident!  I forgot to put the cheese in the crust and so just put it on top of the tarte about 10 min before taking it out of the oven.  My eggs had not set in the designated cooking time, and I ended up baking the tarte for 40 min.  All tweaking aside, baked up lovely.  I used the Miracle Baking Powder Crust on AR and prebaked it for 10 min.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent dish. The only suggestions I thought perhaps to make was to cut the vegetables, such as the zucchini, into smaller pieces to better  mix the individual flavors throughout the dish. Otherwise it was rich and remarkable without being too heavy. Bravo.

We didn't really like this recipe - my egg topping wasn't done after 20 min and even after 10 more.... maybe it would have been ok w/o the egg, but I'm not going try to find out.
