The cake was moist and light.  It needed some lemon juice and zest in the batter  and  a lemon glaze on top to bump up the lemon flavor.

Very good in taste and ease to make. I substituted the juice of one lemon for some of the water and added the zest of two lemons to the batter. I also added a lemon glaze although it would have been good without. Since this is cake-mix-based it has more the consistency of cake than quick bread but is very moist.

This is a nice doctored up cake mix recipe. The lemon loaf was light and fluffy. I had some leftover homemade buttercream frosting, melted it and poured it on top of one loaf. Then I added some lemon juice to the frosting and poured it on the other loaf. The lemon juice really added to the flavor.
