In a word - Excellent!  I love italian grilled chicken and this was no exception.  It was light yet full of flavor!  I pounded three chicken breasts down thin as the recipe states, but instead of just rubbing it with olive oil and using garlic salt I rubbed the chicken with olive oil and used minced garlic plus added a bit of salt and cracked black pepper. I basically eyeballed the ingredients.  We also grilled the chicken with the fresh rosemary sprigs to give it a nice flavor.  I kept the amount of topping the same and it was absolutely fabulous. I also used a combination of shredded Parmesan and Romano cheeses sprinkled on top.  I served it with a side of angel hair pasta with "Best Marinara Sauce Yet" from this site.  All we needed to complete the meal was a fresh garden salad! Thanks Deborah for a great recipe!

We were looking for something that was healthy, and this certainly fit the bill.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I used only two chicken breasts (one package from Costco's boneless, skinless, chicken breasts) and cut the ingredients for the topping in half.  My parmesan cheese was actually Trader Joe's Shaved Parmesan, Romano, and Asiago Cheese.   I do believe that the chicken could have used just a tad more seasoning (at least pepper), and it really did cry "Capers!" to me throughout my preparation.  And for sure I'd add the capers to it next time.  There certainly will be a next time.  I was just trying to stick to the recipe as stated since I knew this would be one of the first reviews.  This was very yummy!  And we WILL have this many more times in the future.

Different and tasty - but like Marianne said, the chicken could have used something while grilling....was a bit bland but the basil (for the most part) made up for it. Healthy too! Next time I will season the chicken prior to cooking but it was pretty good.  I may also add some fresh oregano with the basil, then it would be more like a chicken parm dish but low-fat/calories. Here I thought I was going to be the first to review this recipe as I was searching for something to do with 'chicken' and 'basil' and came across it and figured I would give it a whirl! Nice to know someone else is on the same wavelength! :) Thanks Deborah for providing the recipe! (from another Deborah!)

LOVED IT! I Didn't cook it on the grill cause honestly I was just too lazy to go outside and it was too cold. Sooo I pan seared it. I set the oven to 400 degrees and let it pre heat while cooking the chicken. I coated the chicken in some salt,pepper, garlic powder, and some Italian seasoning. I then placed the chicken on a baking pan and put the mixture and Parmesan cheese on top and baked it until slightly golden brown on top, which was appx 10 minutes...PERFECT AND EASY!

I didn't really care for this recipe.  There wasn't much flavor to it. I used Italian seasonings and put Garlic powder on both sides of the chicken breast prior to cooking.  I baked this in the oven.  I didn't put on the mix until 15 minutes into cooking. Maybe I should have put in on earlier.  My husband liked it but also complained that it didn't have much flavor.  I probably will not make it again.

I loved this. The topping is excellent and really adds to the chicken. I did put some pepper on the chicken before grilling. I will definitely make this again.

I just prepared this for dinner and it is definitely a winner!  I didn't have any fresh tomatoes, so I used a can of diced tomatoes, well drained.  I also added fresh cracked pepper to the chicken breasts before grilling.  Love the fresh flavors.   DELICIOUS!

This was super yummy! I seasoned the chicken with fresh minced garlic, salt, and pepper before grilling. I added less basil. It turned out fabulous! Thank you! Will be making again this week :D

I followed this recipe pretty closely.  I did add black pepper when seasoning the chicken and omitted the lemon juice.  I made the topping in the afternoon, adding a handful of a shredded Italian cheese blend, just because I thought that would be a nice addition.  I let the topping sit at room temperature until needed.  Hereâ€™s where I deviated the most.  When the chicken was cooked through, we put it on a baking sheet, brought it in the house and topped it with the tomato mixture.  Then I slipped it under the broiler on the middle oven rack and broiled it just to heat the topping and melt the cheese.  For me that was easier than messing with the foil over a super hot grill.  I would do it that way again!  Next time I think I'll add the parmesan to the tomato mixture or grate it over the top when serving.  We really liked this!  Hubs even remarked about it the next day!

very good recipe, not perfect.
Chicken could be a little more juicy, maybe with some pre-marinading. But it was still a hit with the family, and the topic was excellent, and pretty healthy as well!

Absolutely fantastic! My husband (who hates chicken but eats it b/c I like it) made this on the grill last night & said that if chicken tasted like this he'd eat it all the time. It tasted very fresh. He did make a few substitutions - dried basil instead of fresh and Italian cheese instead of Parm. Can't wait for him to make this again!

This recipe is awesome!  I'm not much of a chicken eater and I really like this.  I always make extra of the topping and then serve it over angel hair pasta.  I've done this on the grill and (when too cold outside) on the stove.  Always turns out great!

Wonderful recipe!  The only changes I made were that I also pre-seasoned the chicken, added the parmesan to the mix, and when I added the mix on top of the chicken in the foil, I sealed it up, and put back on the grill for another 5 mins.  Kept the chicken moist and steam infused the flavors!  All served over angel hair pasta! Delicious!

We really enjoyed how light and fresh this recipe was as a pasta dish. Even my picky son loved it. I added some onion powder, black pepper and oregano to the chicken in addition to the garlic salt and olive oil. Otherwise, I made it as stated.

I did marinate my chicken breast in Italian/teriyaki/garlic/Italian herbs for additional flavor. This was so easy, delicious and healthy. I  added in some bell peppers I needed to use up, lots of Italian herbs to the veggie mix. Went well with a rice pilaf.

Oh wow, we loved this!!  I used a combination of chopped yellow and red tomatoes.  Also used purple basil :)  I forgot to put the foil under the chicken before loading on the topping so I lost some stuff :(  Lesson learned!  Thanks Deborah!

The recipe is 5 stars as-is.  DELICIOUS!  I added a little bit of balsamic vinegar to the tomatoes and it pushed it over the top.  SOOO good!!!

This was good, but my husband and I felt like it was missing something.  I think it would have been better with feta or maybe adding capers would have been good.

This was very good! I did not flatten the chicken or use the olive oil, but otherwise followed the recipe as stated.  
I may through in a few small croutons next time to give it a true bruschetta taste.
My kids gobbled it up, too. I'm always looking for more ways to incorporate tomatoes since they love them.

Excellent and easy to make. Changed nothing. Made with corn and grilled potatoes! Clean up a breeze!
