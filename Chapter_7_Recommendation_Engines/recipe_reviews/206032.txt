a good base start.... I added a lot of seassonings & spices (cayenne, tony's C seasoning, etc.) being from New Orleans to make it taste more how we cook down here.. It you dont doctor it up, found it too bland for my taste from the South..

i wrote this on another recipe but i am adding here also cos it stands true for this one too.... 
any oyster pie will be better this way.... my mother in law makes this oyster pie recipe with Ritz crackers instead of a pie crust... she lays a bottom of Ritz and Ritz's standing all around the dish as the sides... and crumbles the Ritz on top... with cheese.... makes the recipe even better... and you know it doesn't get much better than an oyster pie... ya enjoy...

Topped with crushed oyster crackers and butter, our oyster fans loved it!
