The first time I ever tried baking a cake I tried this.  Worked a treat, came out tasty and juicy, everyone was impressed and it dissapeard quickly. 

The sugar on the top did look like it started to burn a little even after around 50 mins so I took it out thinking it might not be ready yet inside, but it was fine, tasted great.  I guess I need to just learn how to spot when it's ready.

I am now however amazed at how much sugar goes into cakes!  are they all like this??  

very tasty and easy to understand instructions.

nice one.

I do have to say this cake is very moist and very dense in a very delicious way. The cream cheese adds a bit of tang and a rich, almost creme like texture to the cake that is most noted throughout the center. My favorite part was the crusty top and sides. Nice change of pace from the traditional Jewish Apple Cakes I am familiar with.

Very good flavor!  The cream cheese really adds to this.  Wonderful as is, but may add a few nuts to the topping next time.

Oh my goodness this was the most delicious cake I've ever made! My husband and I made this one night and I couldn't be any more impressed with this recipe. My hubby is hard to please so for him to fawn over this was fantastic!

Update- I've been making this cake for years now and everyone that's tasted it, falls in love. My husband had the bright idea to add pears and its been a great addition!

This is one of the best, easiest cakes I've ever baked!!!  Very moist and very flavorful.  I would highly recommend it!  I did do half white and half brown sugar in the cake because I like the richness brown sugar adds.  Other than that, followed the recipe as written.  A+

This cake is absolutely divine! I made this today and my mom and my grandma love it! It's my first time baking a cake and I wasn't really sure what I was doing but it turned out great anyways! I did anticipate that it was gonna be too sweet for my mom's liking so lessened the sugar by a quarter cup. Thank you for this recipe!

This cake is delicious! I made this cake for my mother in law's birthday and everybody raved about it. I wanted something that wouldn't be too sweet and this cake was perfect! The cream cheese really makes this cake stand out. I will be giving out the recipe at Thanksgiving. Thank you so much for sharing!

I. Love. This. Cake! The only change I made was the pan I used. I don't own a spring form pan, but an 8x8 pan was perfect, didn't even adjust the cooking time. Thank you for a delicious apple cake! It's even yummy with morning coffee!

This was great. I made it as written, but I only baked it for 50 min. I put a circle of parchment paper in the bottom of the springform pan (and buttered it) so I could slip it onto a cake stand, and that worked well.

Like the other reviewers i had to take one star away due to excessive sweetness. However, this is a very moist and delicious cake. I used my jumbo muffin pan in lieu of a cake pan (too lazy to look for it), and made sure that I kept I eye on the baking time and adjusted accordingly. Very nice way of using up my apples!

This is a great and moist cake and really easy to make. It was a little on the sweet side for me so I reduced sugar that went into the cake and didn't use all the sugar and cinnamon topping. Keep in mind that All

I am not a huge sweet eater, but this is by far the best cake I have ever eaten.  It is light, not too sweet, and delicious.  It also turns out very pretty.  It would be perfect for almost any occasion.  You could serve it with a brunch, luncheon, or dinner.  I am also terrible about posting my results from recipes, but I absolutely had to post on this. You can feel very confident if you choose to make this for the first time and serve it to guests!! A+

Excellent cake. The only thing I would suggest is decreasing the sugar. We found it a tad too sweet...but the flavour is otherwise outstanding.

I did not have a springform pan, so I used a glass flat pan (Pyrex). Good, but missing something. Next time, I'll double the cinnamon-sugar mixture and mix some in throughout the cake and on top. Might also add nuts. Still, glad to have the recipe and glad I found it since I had cream cheese to use up. Thanks.

OMG, OMG, OMG!!!!  Love this cake.  Easy to make and so delish that we are thinking we'll be eating it for breakfast, lunch and dinner - daily!  I did cut the sugar a bit and in my oven, 50 minutes was just perfect.  Recently had to dispose of my ancient springform pan, so I used a parchment paper-lined cake pan.  Mmmmmmmmmm.

I followed this recipe exactly and though it was good it wasn't as moist as I would have thought it wld be.  I'm still searching for the perfect, moist apple cake.  I might make it again but probably not.

Incredible! Ive never had such rave reviews. Definitely my favourite recipe ever. So moist and cinnamonlicious! You must try this! Easy too. I made two and they were gone before I could blink. Everyone wants the recipe.

At this point in my life, I've done a lot of cooking and baking.  This is maybe in the top 5 things that I have EVER made in my kitchen.  Recipe is perfect as is.

Absolutely loved this.  It's simple, straight forward and delicious.  I will be making it as a gift cake for Christmas, hope that that is ok.  OH - and absolutely spot on about how long it takes to cook.  Follow that and the clean toothpick test.

Okay, this was great. I followed the recipe. It was moist and so flavorful. I don't think I have ever tried a recipe here and liked it so much. This is a keeper and I will add it to my favorites.
