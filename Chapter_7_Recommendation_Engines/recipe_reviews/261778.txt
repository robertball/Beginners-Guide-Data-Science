Sooo good! Everyone loved it and my niece asked to take the leftovers home.  I sliced my sprouts lengthwise before  tossing them with apples and the balsamic/maple/olive oil dressing, then placed them cut side down on cookie sheet. Saved a tablespoon of marinade to toss the walnuts and cranberries before adding to the cooked sprouts and apples. Will make again!

This dish was amazing. I made it for a date and he also loved it. My adult daughter took some leftovers of it and loved it. I will definitely be making this on a regular basis. Yummy!

I was not sure about this dish because Brussels sprouts are not my favourite, but was I glad I tried it! I followed the recipe but substituted pecans for the walnuts, and it was so good. I will definitely be making this again.

Pretty good.  Used pecans rather than walnuts by preference.  The color combination makes a nice presentation, especially for the Christmas dinner table. I found it needed some salt.  I liked the combination of ingredients and would use this recipe again.
