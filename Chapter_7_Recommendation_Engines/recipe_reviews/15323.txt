This is a wonderful recipe that is totally addicting.  My son gave me the recipe and he said it was being passed all around offices on the east and west coast.  A good change from chocolate chips.

A good, soft cookie. The walnuts and dates make it really different from other holiday cookies.

I've been making a very similar recipe that my Mom would make every Christmas. I had been searching to find where the recipe came from and this seems to be it. In Pennsylvania, we call them Michigan Rocks. Now I know where the name comes from. The only variation is that I add raisins to match the amount of dates. I know a few people who add whiskey.

One tip: Put cold cookies in the microwave (about 10 seconds or so for one cookie, 15 seconds or so for two, etc.). You'll think they just came out of the over. Fruit is so warm.

Very nice cookie. Soft and not too sweet. I was hoping for a denser cookie but these are very tasty. I did decrease the nuts to one cup. Really couldnâ€™t see putting 3 cups in.

We love these cookies, but like less walnuts. I make it as written, but cut the walnuts in half.

These are great! I swapped one of the eggs for a ripe banana, some of the sugar for agave, and half of the all purpose flour for whole wheat. Turned out beautifully and were a big hit with my family.
