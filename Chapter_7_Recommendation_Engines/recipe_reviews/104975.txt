My parents loved it!
But, being my father's daughter, I played with the recipe a bit.

Personally, used large Crossant rolls out of tubes since my family likes them better than regular rolls.

I stretched the larger end of the triangles before scooping the mix in and carefully, but quickly wrapping them up and I baked them instead of fried 'em (using the amount of minutes on the tube at 350 degrees F).  ^^v;;

And instead of a head of cabbage, I used pre-shreaded coleslaw mix for a bit of color and the added carrots, I also chopped up some red pepper and added it in for color.  I had to drain my browned meat (I used 90% lean ground beef), then added the oil and veggies so the liquid wouldn't soak the rolls too much later on.

I tested a small-ish slice of Sharp Cheddar cheese in half of them, but with the thin slices I used, you can't tell the difference - so I'd leave it out next time since it's not neccessary, and probably more healthy.

Truly, I am going to make these for work lunches once in a while, they're a lot better than plain old sandwitches or worse, canned/microwave food.

Thanks for posting it!!!

I used 2 balls of dough per Runza to make an adult sized sandwich but I rolled them out way too thin(read a review to do so - don't).  I almost doubled the s&p, added garlic powder and worch. sauce and about 7C cabbage.  Drained the fat from the meat before adding the cabbage, and again after it wilted and released water.  Filling turned out GREAT.  Not greasy, and didn't make the dough mushy.  Will use the recipe again with additions, but I think it needs the sweeter home made dough.  These will still go fast!
Update:  I froze these UNBAKED.  Heat oven to 350 while letting Runza sit on counter/baking pan.  Bake for 30 min when oven is at temp. Do not thaw more than that. Perfect!

I liked them a lot. I fried some and also baked some, I liked the baked ones better. They're good with mustard, maybe next time I'll add cheese. Great recipe!

Yes, this is the way Gramma, and Mom used to make them, only baked.  and with thawed frozen bread rolls, or make your own bread dough in bread machine.
I have a miracle whip salad dressing mixed with sour cream and prepared horseradish for a good sauce. same as with prime rib......for a "bam" little kick of flavor.. they freeze well and reheat in oven or better yet microwave.  once frozen use seal a meal or food saver roll and get the air out. they keep a long long time.  but if you have anyone around, they don't last.  great for quick company short notice meals or snacks.
I would give it a 10 rating if possible.

These were good and held together well, but by strictly going by the recipe, they tasted a bit bland. I will make them again using another reviewer's suggestion of adding dry onion soup mix to the meat mixture.

Easy and tasty! I made this even easier by using pre-cut cabbage packaged for coleslaw as well as bagged frozen onion because that is what I had on hand and they turned out just fine.

Made this as a quick weeknight dinner using refrigerated biscuits (i.e. Grands) to make a nice-sized portion.  I made a half-batch.  I used a whole bag of prepackaged coleslaw mix, added some garlic salt and Worchestershire sauce as others have recommended, and it turned out great.  I pressed out one biscuit to about a 6-inch circle, added a generous heap of filling, and placed another pressed-out biscuit on top.  Sealed the edges and rolled them under to keep from bursting.  Placed on a cookie sheet and baked according to the directions on the roll package, about 15 minutes.  Total time from start to finish was about 35 minutes, perfect for those busy weeknights.  This approach will use half the recipe, 16 biscuits (2 packages), making 8 portions about the size of a Kaiser roll.  Will definitely make again!

I wanted an easy side for a german dish and these were great. I had to play around with it since I was making a much smaller batch,(I cook for two). I wish I would have used more cabbage. I did add shredded carrots and used cresent roll dough. Next time I will use the dough mentioned in the recipe.

They were pretty good, we dipped them in mustard and a spicy BBQ sauce. I also baked them instead of frying.

My German mother made these all the time, including the dough from scratch, as I continue to do now.  The simplest version is what we always had.  It seems adding garlic and/or other spices/flavoring diminishes the simple original version.  Keep it simple as this recipe has and enjoy.

Great idea to use refrigerated rolls. I usually use hot roll mix. I used whole wheat rolls and I baked rather than fried them. The family loved them.

I made these using crescent roll dough and filled them  with sauerkraut instead of cabbage...man were they delicious!  This recipe made a ton of the little buggers, but as soon as I set them out on the table they were snatched up by my guests.  Also, I baked them instead of frying them.

My family enjoyed these, but I found them a little bland despite the addition of extra pepper and Worcestershire sauce. I baked them and used crescent rolls because I couldn't find frozen dinner rolls. Maybe a ground sausage would be more flavorful.

Great! I made my own dough - but I think next time I'll try to find the roll dough because I'm lame at getting mine all the same size. I found the filling a little bland, so I added some dry mustard and celery seed -- excellent. I fried mine in the deep fryer and served them with stone ground mustard. Yum. Thanks for the recipe!

I had a friend's German Biericks years ago and remember them being so good, I wanted to make them.  I looked and found this recipe and tried it today.  I only used 1/2 a head of cabbage, added garlic, and worchester.  I also cooked the meat and cabbage mixture longer than 10 min. (more like 30!)to soften the cabbage.  I used Rhodes frozen roles and used all of them and still had a lot ofmeat/cabbage mixture left over!  Very good, but would have liked more meat mixture in the roles.

An authentic German gal made this for us and I was hooked. I just made Mexican Tamales and had some of the sauce left and added it to the meat mixture, simmered till it was moist, not soupy. I baked mine and they came out outstanding.

This turned out well the first time I made it, but by adding soy sauce and worstershire sauce the next, the meat was much better tasting.  I also used Pilsbury reduced fat crescent rolls as the dough, this made them fantastic!

Made these for a neighborhood party and received great reviews. However, as an appetizer, 2 pounds of hamburger was too much. I liked using sauerkraut instead of cabbage, the onion soup mix, and Worchester sauce. Filling the average-sized refrigerator biscuits worked well. These can be filling so small Runza's for an appetizer are best.

My mom made these for years, started making them back in the 1930's. The original German recipe calls for sauerkraut instead of cabbage but my dad didn't care for it. My mom used Pillsbury Hot Roll Mix for her bread. That's how I make mine now. Love these so much, reminds me of my childhood!

I made these for the German Club last nite & absolutely delish. I squeezed some gulden's spicy mustard on top after cooking & mixed it in, gave it a little more zing! I used yeast frozen rolls & held it together w a tooth pick. The next time I would probably use crescent or one of the other refrig rolls. The rolls I used were too difficult to work with. Would def make it again!

I make these for ever.   The only the thing different I do I use frozen bread.  Unthaw the bread so you can slice it.  Roll each slice on a flour board  in a circle add filling fold over pitch the edge together.  But on cookie sheet cover with parchment paper.  Brush lightly with egg wash. Make a small slit  in the middle.  Bake.  And then enjoy.  Freeze wonderfully.

Very tasty. I baked it instead of frying and added a bit more seasoning. Easy to make and reheat in the oven well.

I enjoyed this recipe but instead of using dinner rolls as stated, I used phyllo dough and baked them in the oven.  Before placing in oven I brushed each with melted butter and baked them in 350 degree oven until golden brown.  They were so delicious with the flaky pastry outside!
