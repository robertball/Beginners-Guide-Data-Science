Delicious!  Wonderful sweet and spicy flavor.  I was a little nervous about the heat level of 6 unseeded habaneros so I did remove the seeds from half of them but I think it would have been fine if I had left them all in.  Great recipe!

I've made these wings twice, and both times were amazing!!!! First time, I made them as the recipe calls for - they were delectable. The second time, I couldn't find habanero peppers in my local grocers, so I bough habanero hotsauce and used regular sweet peppers for texture. The hot sauce was HOOOOOOTTTT (or I put too much), so I had to add more brown sugar and honey to the mixture. They were AMAZING yet again!!! Great recipe - thank you so much!!!

All my potluck guests raved about these. A little spicy for the weaklings, but not quite on par with the original BWW version. We made about 4 pounds of wings and coated them in 3 1/2 tbsp cornstarch before baking (not frying) and it worked great. Just be prepared to struggle with yanking the wings off the pan. Could use a bit less butter next time + 2 more habaneros but otherwise these were the favorite of the 3 flavors of wings we made.

Could use half a stick of butter instead. More habanero for flavor and use a mango instead of juice.

I made this to serve with my air-fryer wings.  I used my own homegrown habañeros fresh from the freezer (it’s December). Let me say that I can eat these at Buffalo Wild Wings all day long, but I, nor anyone else present, couldn’t eat three wing sections without needing a cool down. I added a second can of mango nectar and reduced again. It’s still hot enough to make my entire face burn nicely for 15 or 20 minutes. I think it was my sun ripened peppers, compared to the commercially  grown variety that made it so intense. Next time I'll try the store bought peppers..Still gets 5 stars!

Love it!! This is my favorite mango habanero wing recipe, even over the restaurants! We made this and left the seeds in.. definitely spicy but has a sweet kick. I love spicy so if you can’t handle you should remove the seeds. The corn starch gives it the crunch which I love! This is definitely my favorite and we have saved the recipe to keep making, so delicious!!

Wonderful recipe.  I could use the sauce on many other things!  I took the seeds out of all but two peppers and it was perfect.  My eight year old son loved it!  That is a major win!

I grilled my wings and rubbed them with an all purpose seasoning first. I make two batches of sauce; one with 6 Habaneros and another with just 3 habaneros. Mild with 3, but you can control the heat by tossing the wings with an added teaspoon of the one with 6. Also, used half as much butter. LOVE this sauce, but 6 Habaneros is too hot for me.

Absolutely great flavor and no residual lip burning sensation that I usually endure after eating these at my favorite sports bar. I made these exactly as written and they turned out delicious!  I also made a batch of honey barbecue wings for those who might not appreciate the heat and served them both with celery and dip. Just as directed, I could see the sauce start to thicken at the 45 minute mark, but let it simmer for the full hour so that it was nice and thick.  (Next time I may try frying the wings naked without the corn starch coating just to see if that step is necessary.) All in all, this recipe is a definite keeper.

The only reason this didn't get five stars was because of the butter.  I felt weird about adding that much in the first place but followed the recipe despite that. Definitely way too much, it separated and sat on the top. However, after I spent ten minutes skimming it off, the most beautiful sauce was hiding underneath. Sticky, sweet, tangy and spicy. I added about ten habaneros and still thought it could use a bit more spicy, but the original six would probably be appropriate for a dinner party or for people who like less spice.

Great recipe! As a big wing fan i was looking for something a little different  and i couldn't be happier with this recipe. While cooking the sauce everybody in my house commented on how good it smelled. I added dome extra garlic which made it even more delicious. Nice spice without being too overbearing. Will be using this recipe again and again!

These are great and a perfect balance of sweet and heat. I have some kind of issue where I cannot digest pepper seeds. They give me mega issues so I did take the seeds out of the peppers. By doing this I realize you lose a lot of the heat so I added some habarano hot pepper sauce to make up for it. The heat in this recipe is not one that smacks you in the face but more the kind that sneaks up on you as you are eating. Great recipe! Thanks for sharing!
