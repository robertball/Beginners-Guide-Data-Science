This was good! I reduced the butter to 1/2 cup (1 stick), and thought that was more than enough. I also only needed 1/2 pound of the white American cheese. This was tasty and a great side to our steak salads. I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was an unusual recipe.  I found a few guests who liked it but, by and large, it was not popular with most.  I think the amount of butter was excessive but that wouldn't have changed the taste, just the fat content.  I did look this over, more than once, and hesitated to make it because of the ingredients- but I did, and it was not a success.

Unfortunately it didn't have much flavor and we didn't care for the poppyseed mixture or use of American cheese.
