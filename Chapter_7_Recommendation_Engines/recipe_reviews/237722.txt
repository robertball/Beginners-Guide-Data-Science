Loved everything about this sauce! I made it on grilled chicken. It wasn't as thick as I was expecting it, but it was definitely tasty with a nice spicy kick to it. For the bourbon I used Bulleit 90-proof. The bourbon wasn't overpowering, but if you know bourbon, you can actually still taste it. I look forward to trying it in on pork butt!

made it tonight to go on ribs. The only part of the recipe I didn't follow was to add a smoke flavor, as I made it on the smoker. Good flavor, a little thin though.
I'll probably tinker with it, and update later
