This recipe is creamy & delicious. The favor is dependant on what flavor crouton you use. I rolled and crushed half the croutons and sprinkled them on top of casserole during the last half of cooking time. Thanks, Nyla for sharing the recipe.

My family really liked this recipe.  My husband told me that I should definately make this one again.  I didn't have any peppers, so I substituted broccoli and used cream of broccoli soup instead of the cream of celery.  I tried to make this recipe in a casserole dish instead of the larger baking dish.   I don't suggest using a casserole dish because the croutons didn't get crunchy.

This is a very good comfort food. Nice choice of vegetables, celery and green bell pepper. Will make again. Salt to taste after baking.

I cook for the whole family, self, wife, and three boys, 10, 5,& 3 and they all love this dish.  I didn't have the cream of celery so I used cream of mushroom instead.  Also, I used low-sodium soups to lower the salt content (diabetic and low salt-diet) and added salt substitute.  Someone already said the flavor of the croutons makes a difference and we prefer the larger squares over the small croutons.  It was fantastic.

I thought this was wonderful! I did put a little garlic salt in and used chicken broth instead of water. I also put french fried onions on top. Everyone liked it

Sorry, we didn't care for this.  We ate it, but I won't make it again.  It just tasted like canned soup with chicken - I had hoped the fresh vegetables would give it more flavor.

This turned out pretty good.  I did cook chicken in the crockpot and added garlic, onions and green bell pepper and two stalks of celery with about 1 1/2 cups of chicken broth.  When I came home I diced up the chicken and added the can of cream of chicken soup, can of celery soup with a can of broth from the crockpot and veggies I did (not add the water).  In place of the croutons I used french fried onions.  This turned out really good.  Thanks for the post.

Super easy!  Had no bell peppers or onions, so I used dried onions and my husband loved it.  I also reduced chicken to one breast and did not find it lacking - but then we tend to be light meat eaters.
