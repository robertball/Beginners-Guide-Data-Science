I have a microwave popcorn bowl so I used the olive oil in the bowl, added all the seasonings except for Parmesan cheese and then popped the corn. Once finished popping I only had to add the Parmesan cheese.

OMG...that was so very delicious.  I used garlic infused olive oil, French gray salt, garlic powder, and fresh grated Parmesan.  This is definitely a keeper.

Thanks Jon!

I really liked this and I will probably never buy commercial popcorn seasoning again.  I made it exactly as recipe called for, but using the Kraft powdered parmesan cheese as I did not have fresh grated on hand. ( I used perhaps 1/4 cup of this as it just seemed all I would need ).   I also did not have garlic salt so I used 1 tsp of garlic powder and 1/2 tsp of sea salt.  I will make this again but next time, I want to try it with melted butter drizzled around and the powdered mix sprinkled on separately as this is my traditional method and I would like to compare.  I look forward to trying different flavours now.

I used freshly grated Parmesan instead of the stuff in the can and it was too heavy to stick to the popcorn!  It all piled up on the bottom of the bowl.  Perhaps if I'd added more olive oil to make it stick?

Next time I'll add a little butter.  The Parmesan cheese added just the right amount of saltiness.

Great idea but I actually liked it better without the parmesan cheese.  When I added the cheese, it weighed the topping down and it all fell to the bottom :-/  I had to keep shaking it to keep getting toppings to stay on the top.

I liked the popcorn OK.  We ran out of dry white cheddar and I made this for my 4 year old instead.  He did not like it but my husband and I did like it pretty good.
