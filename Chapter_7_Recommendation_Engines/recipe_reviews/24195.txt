Awesome!  I made this for Thanksgiving last year and it was a hit!!  I made the crust with 1 cup shortbread cookies and 1/2 cup gingersnaps....really complemented the flavor of the cheesecake!  I also did what grandma always taught me - NEVER use as much ginger or nutmeg as it calls for...I used just over 1/8 tsp each.

This is absolutely yummy.  I baked it in a 9" springform pan for 40 minutes, so I didn't have to cover the edge with foil.  Also let cool in the oven with the door barely cracked for about 30 minutes before removing it and refrigerating overnight.  It's a very attractive dessert and a nice change from pumpkin pie.

I made this for Thanksgiving.  I loved it!  I just used a graham cracker pie shell instead of using the shortbread cookies.  Will definately make this again!!!!

The cookie crust makes this cheesecake very simple to make and delicious.  My daughter is allergic to soy so there are very few comercial cookies or crusts that she can eat, but with store bought shortbread cookies we were able to make up a quick alternative holiday dessert for her.

I had 25+ people over for Thanksgiving last year and made two of these. Everyone loved the taste and texture (rather then that of just a pumpkin pie) I forgot to save the recipe but found it again now I'm throwing a  Harvest party. Its a great seasonal flavor cheese cake. What makes it better is the swirl gives it great presentation.

This was a hit - we put large candles on top and used it as our Christmas Birthday cake and the grandkids sang Happy Birthday to Jesus. To make it gluten free, I used the gluten free "Smorables" for the graham cracker crust.

Recipe was so easy to follow that my husband made it ... We had one slight problem in that the element in our oven broke the Wednesday before Christmas. My husband went to the hardware store to buy a new one on Chirstmas Eve, but it didn't work, so we had to purchase a new oven. Sence the new oven was not do to arrive until after the first of the new year we had to make due with what we had and that was my electric roaster. It came through with fying colors.  Will make again only this time in my new oven

DELICIOUS!!!! This recipe has turned into a tradition in my house for the holidays. I have had guests do special requests for it during the holidays as well. The only thing that I do differently is that I use graham cracker crust (personal preference) Do not skip this recipe it is AWESOME!!!

My husband loves cheesecake, and I love pumpkin pie.  This recipe is a perfect mix between the two.  It was a huge hit with my mother-in-law, as well.  I considered for next time to make more of the crust (because it was a little low on the sides), but my mother-in-law said to not change a thing.  Excellent dessert!!  I think it will be a hit for Thanksgiving...

Wonderful!!! I made it for Thanksgiving and plan to make it a yearly tradition instead of the pumpkin pie. I have found that I prefer the crust when I mix gramcrackers with the shortbread for the crust.

It was delicious! Very moist and fluffy; Not too sweet.  Everyone loved it!  It looks impressive too.
I only had a round cake pan so I pressed the crust onto the bottom of it and it still turned out just fine. I surved it with a dollop of lightly sweetend whipped cream. Yum!

I made two of these for Thanksgiving and they were quite good although I'm not sure I'd go so far as to say excellent.  There was a bit of an odd flavor, I think it must have been the ginger.  I'm not really fond of ginger.  If I make this again I'll leave it out.  Make sure you press the cookie crumb crust all the way to the tip top as it shrinks up when you bake it.

There seemed to be a mistake in the directions. It said to reserve 1/2 cup of the mixture prior to adding the eggs. It was too stiff to swirl in. I got very frustrated.
