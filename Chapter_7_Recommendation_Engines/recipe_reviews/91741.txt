These are amazing bars!  My family loved them.  It tastes just like their topped with mint ice cream!  I will make this recipe again and again.  I LOVE it!

OMG!  Second time I made this, I got it right.  For the record, don't use Cool Whip instead of real Whipping Cream.  It wasn't pleasant... But, making as written, not only do you have picture perfect presentation - but you have one of the best brownie desserts EVER!  Pleasantly minty - not overwhelming / not too mild.  It DOES taste like ice cream! (I omit the nuts and drop a few extra mini-chocolate chips on top for added visual appeal)
