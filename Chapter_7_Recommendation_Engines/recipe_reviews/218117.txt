The brownie cupcake part was so yummy. I am not a big fan of marshmallows so I may leave them off next time.  Also, we don't do nuts here.

I made these for a potluck at work because I thought they looked SO good! The flavor was great, as well as the texture of the cake but the marshmallows melted and ran off the top of the cakes and burned onto the pan, the chocolate chips and nuts that were on the top melted into the cake so in the end, they looked NOTHING like the picture.  I made a second batch, waiting to top them with the nuts, chocolate chips and marshmallows until the last 5 minutes of baking time but the marshmallows did the same thing, they swelled up, melted and started sliding off the cupcake again.

These were a huge hit! I was told the best cupcake ever eaten - and I bake for the office all the time. One note: There is a lot of time for prep for this recipe and it took longer than 20 mins to fully bake.

Mine looked just like the picture, tasted great and were moist. My co-workers loved them. I especially enjoyed that no frosting is needed to make a pretty cupcake. I did not have an issue with the marshmallows. I only placed 3-4 mini marshmallows on each. I just kept a close eye on the cupcakes and as soon as I saw them brown a little or swell up. I removed them from the oven. Check out the picture I uploaded.

My family really liked the toppings and the chocolatey taste was definitely there but they turned out very dry, and had a texture more like a muffin. They went down easier the next morning with some butter spread on them.

I also sprayed the liners with cooking spray. I made the mistake of not melting the chocolate over boiling water and just microwaved it. Oops! DON'T DO THIS. 
I was also scared of burning the marshmallows as read in previous reviews, so I just mixed in the nuts and marshmallows. 
Due to not cooking the chocolate properly, they came out crisp on top, gooey underneath, best eaten with a spoon. Tasted great but did not look like cupcakes.

great idea...  for some reason mine didn't turn out and ended up tossing them.  The few I made in my mini cupcake (George Forman type unit) turned out good.  Just stuffed a mini marshmallow in the middle and topped of with nuts, closed the lid and tasted good.  Would definitely make a mini version again

These were rich with lots of chocolate flavor.  It took almost 30 minutes to bake them.  I did position the oven rack on the bottom one-third of the oven as directed and had no problems with the topping melting.

These cupcakes are moist and really rich.  I like that you do not have to frost them.  They are pretty and complete right out of the oven!  The marshmallows on top turned dark golden brown which tasted good on day one while still slightly warm but after cooled on day two they were a little chewy.  Maybe this could have been prevented by adding them half way through the baking time??  Also, they took about 30 minutes to cook through the middle.  Overall...very good recipe!

The recipe is delicious, however the "mini cupcake" is a hard sell for me. I think it's more of a brownie batter. After painstakingly filling every mini cupcake with that sticky batter I put the rest in a small pan. Perfect brownies! Ugly mini cupcakes.

Loved this! I messed up and included the walnuts and marshmallows *in* the batter, not on top but it came out great! I added a handful of broken pretzels too just for fun.

I made these for my son's first birthday. These were for the adults though. They were delicious and disappeared quickly! I did not make any changes to the recipe. These are awesome!

These are Fantastic.. I made them in mini cup cake tins, perfect bits size treats. The 'cake' part is more of a brownie.

Great recipe, only for the most diehard chocoholics though! I pushed the marshmellows partly into the batter before putting into the oven, and they did not fall off or burn like they did for others. I baked them for 20 min as directed, and they came out gooey at first, but firmed up as they cooled down. A must try!

It turned out amazing but in my place we don't get last ingredient mentioned so I made without it.. But also I used rich plum cake flavor.. It made cake delicious
