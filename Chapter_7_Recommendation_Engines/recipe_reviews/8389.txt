Delicious and easy cake!

I only make this recipe now- I sometimes omit the cocoa for a plain white cake or add some grated/chopped apples and cinnamon/nutmeg/cloves for an apple spice version.

2 thumbs up!

I'm making this in the form of cupcakes for my daughter's 1st birthday party.  She is allergic to milk and eggs.  So this is perfect!  I did a trial run last night and these taste just like regular cake to me and my husband.  Not so with some other recipes I've been trying...  The recipe makes about 15 cupcakes.  They baked for 25 min at 375.  Came out just perfect.  I used Pillsbury's cream cheese icing to frost them.  It's milk and egg free too.  Who would have thought?  Thanks so much for this recipe.  I'm sure it will be a hit this weekend!!!  :)

Oh my goodness!! This recipe is amazing.  I couldn't find my wacky cake recipe, so I went online to see what I could find.  BETTER then the recipe I used to use.  This is definately a keeper.  MANY MANY comliments.  Made this cake for my mom's birthday.    You have to make this cake with an almond extract icing.  Icing sugar, margerine, a little milk and some almond extract.  Make the icing first, then add a little almond extract at a time until desired taste is reached.   WOW!

This was EXCELLENT!  I used a gluten free flour blend and added 1 1/2 tsp. xanthan gum....perfect!  I've been going crazy trying to come up with a tasty birthday cake recipe for my son with multiple food allergies....this was perfect!  I used the One Minute Chocolate Icing recipe from this site, and the entire family loves it!  I have also doubled this, put into a Wilton character pan (greased and floured) and had great results as well.

This is the one my mom makes and I was happy to find it here. I made it today for an after dinner treat but it didn't make it that long. Too yummy! I have never had it with any frosting of sort so I decided to top it with a thin chocolate icing used on "Texas Cake" and it was mouth watering. WARNING, if you make this cake, as I learned long ago, DO NOT OVER MIX the batter. It just needs to be blended and it's ready for the oven.

Very good recipe! I mix it all up in a bowl first and then pour it into a greased pan.  Also made a glaze with 2 Tbsp. butter, 3-4 Tbsp. cocoa powder, 3/4 cup powdered sugar and 3Tbsp hot water.  Melted the butter, added the cocoa and then the powdered sugar.  Added the hot water to smooth it out.  Pour on warm cake and let cool.  =)

This is moist and great.  I put 1/2 cup water 1/2 cup brewed coffee instead of 1 cup of water and it's even more chocolaty.  I ice this with the icing from a Texas sheet cake (you cook it and pour it on hot and let it set up).  Wonderful!!!

My mom made this cake often when I was growing up and it's great to find it here. The recipe is only slightly different from my mom's.  She used only 5 tablespoons of oil and she used white vinegar rather than cider vinegar. 

We usually serve this cake warm, with peppermint frosting.

My mom described the history of the recipe slightly differently.  She's a vet from WWII and explained that the cake was named Wacky Cake in honour of the WAC (women's air corps) women who developed the recipe. Milk and eggs were scarce during the war.

I had my doubts about this cake- no eggs or dairy?? But I made it for a friend's birthday with the White Fluffy Frosting from this website.  She was on an iodine-free diet for cancer treatment and so excited to have cake on her birthday.  I took my first bite nervously, but it was actually delicious!!! The combination of the frosting (which tasted marshmallow-ey) and the chocolatey cake ended up tasting like a sophisticated moon pie!! The cake was very moist, and the frosting went well with it.  I would consider making this again for a birthday cake.  I made two 8-inch cakes and turned it into a layer cake. Yum.  Thanks for the recipe!

I've loved this cake for years.  Trust me, nothing needs to be changed.  Wacky cake is delicious with a Almond extract icing.  Icing sugar, butter/margerine, milk and the extract to taste.

YUM!

My vegan friends LOVED this cake. It baked up moist and tasty. It is also sturdy enough that you can cut it into a shape (I made it a heart) without it crumbling to bits as so many eggless cakes do. Definitely a keeper!

Grew up with this cake.  Love it.  Also, it's one of those cakes that doesn't need any frosting.  It is so moist that it's better without.  We make a vanilla version of this also by omitting the cocoa and doubling the vanilla.

I used to make cupcakes and they came out a little dry...HOWEVER, I can work with that in future experiments. I added a tsp of cinnamon for flare, I'd like to try adding some cayenne and maybe subbing the oil for applesauce. For the most part, my nut/milk/egg allergic son - LOVED this recipe and that alone makes me happy!

I was excited about this recipe because it is so simple and cheap and people seem to love it! Just perfect for what I'm looking for since I bake cakes to sell here in Central America. I wanted to make a kind of chocolate cake (real chocolate is so expensive here) and the ingredients seemed so perfect.
But unfortunately I was not so happy with the result. It did rise very nicely but I found the taste rather bland. It lacked a lot of sweetness and chocolate flavour for me. 
I think I will try this recipe again but changing it up a lot, for example add banana, like one reviewer suggested. I think that would make it much nicer.

This cake is outstanding, bakes up well and you would never guess it doesn't have egg, butter or dairy. I love it because no egg, butter and dairy = no cholesterol! Simple to make and ingredients are always on hand. I use chocolate extract and substitute coffee for the water. I can't say enough good things about this cake and make it often with different frostings!! (It's best after it sits for a day)

I was skeptical about a cake with vinegar, but it works! Good and surprisingly moist without eggs or milk. I did follow other reviewers and use some coffee for the water, about 50/50 ratio. It really is a great size for our smaller family. I did not have to bake it as long as the recipe said, only about 25 min. Thanks.

I went Vegan a year ago and just recently discovered the 'wacky' Depression era cakes.  I had no idea vegan cake could be so easy and delicious.  This recipe works perfectly as stated for a moist light cake.

I was low on ingredients and wanted a good dessert so I thought I'd give this a try. I didn't have cider vinegar, so I used regular white vinegar and per other reviewers I made it with coffee instead of plain of water. I've also made it per the recipe, and either way it was great. I was so surprised. I baked it in an 8 inch round pan and then iced it with the creamy chocolate frosting from this site. It made for a really rich, decadent, and most importantly EASY dessert. This is now my family's favorite cake!

This is the moistest, easiest chocolate cake I've ever made.  I've only made one better chocolate cake in my life and it was about 20X more complicated than this.  I love it!  I used the "hard chocolate glaze" from this site to frost it.

The only way I can get this recipe to work is to double it.  The first time I made it it was way too dry, but it's because the recipe as posted is only half a batch.  The pan I put it is was too big and I cooked it too long!  If you double this recipe you can put it in a regular size cake pan and it should turn out wonderfully!

.
Having the pan greased and the oven ready is crucial. You want to mix the dry ingrediants in one bowl, and the wet in another. Mix the wet to the dry until combined, pour into the baking pan and get in the oven. You don't want to tap the pan to get the bubbles out as I remember doing with box mixes.
I also put the cocoa powder through a sieve to get out the lumps.
This is a great mix to put the dry ingredient together in advance and keep in a ziploc bag. Just put on a label for the wet ingrediants and it's so quick to make for an unexpected occasion

I must have done something WRONG because my cake didn't rise at all.  Every indentation I made in the batter before I baked it was still there when I took it out.  Not tasty. Not really food.  Where did I go wrong?

This is a wonderful cake.  The only thing I changed was that I used an equal amount of lemon juice to substitute for the vinegar-simply because I was out of vinegar.  It worked great.  Definitely keeping this recipe!!

These were a big hit for the under 3 crowd, and especially for the egg-allergic playmate who could finally have what everyone else was having! Definitely make again over other chocolate cake recipes.  I made a couple of dozen cupcakes with these, baked at 10 mins.  I may cut down on the oil next time, as they didn't take well to a dusting of powdered sugar (got all melted and shiny, but still tasty).  So eash!!

Very nice and moist.  Has a smidge of an off taste but once frosted that's hardly noticeable.

This is definitely better the second day. I had a piece when I first made the cake and was NOT impressed. Tasted like it was missing something. But the second day it was very good -- moist and flavorful. My adult son really likes it. I sprinkled cinnamon on top, then powdered sugar. I'll make this again, for sure -- but a day ahead of when I want to eat it!  : )

Delicious! Didn't have eggs or milk, but I was craving something chocolate. I really cannot believe how yummy this cake is! I used white vinegar because it's all I had. This is definitely a keeper! Btw, it's identical to the Vegan Chocolate cake on this website. Thanks!

PERFECT!  I've made other versions of this cake before but needed one that made a smaller cake and I'm glad I chose this one!  I did need to make some substitutions as I realized I was out of some ingredients after I started making the cake.  Used white vinegar instead of cider vinegar..didn't make any difference.  Also didn't have enough vegetable oil on hand so I used applesauce..ended up using 3 Tbsp oil and 3 Tbsp applesauce.  Both worked just fine! Love this cake! Perfect size for 2 people!

I made this for my Dad's 60th.  Wacky cake is his all time favorite, so when I couldn't find our family's recipe I used this one.  It was outstanding!  The cake was so moist and chocolatey.  It's now the new family recipe.  For any newbies to wacky cake, don't shy away from this recipe because it doesn't contain eggs or milk...It's a really good cake.

Lovely. Low fat and delightful. My mother, who loves chocolate and hates copious amounts of sugar, loved it, though we both agreed we would cut down the sugar next time. It was certainly one of the finest homemade recipes for chocolate cake I've found yet. Moist, dense but not heavy, and delicious. Not to mention very little mess. I loved not having a clutter of pans and bowls in the sink afterwards. I will be using it again....and again.

Just average for me. It was moist and given that it has no eggs or dairy it was ok. But it really had no depth or richness. I prefer something with a bit more oomph to it - some kind of wow factor - and this didn't have it.

Warning: Do not taste the cake while it is still hot!!!! There is something about the Vinegar and Baking Soda combination that is letting off a terrible odor/fumes/taste while the cake cools. Sort of bitter and metallic.  Once the cake has cooled this is only very minimally detectable (if you are tasting for it), but if you taste the cake too early (I got overeager to trim the top flat) you will think the recipe has failed entirely.  This bad taste isn't apparent if you taste the uncooked batter, or the cake once it has cooled. I threw out the first cake I made because I thought I must have accidentally mis-measured. My second careful version tasted just as bad while hot, but fortunately I left it on the counter, and my roommate asked to try it later that night. Amazingly, the terrible taste/odor had almost entirely vanished.

I mixed all of the ingredients in a bowl, and used the batter to make cupcakes. I yielded 30 cupcakes out of the doubled recipe. I was pleased with how good it tasted. The texture was very good as well- I never would've guessed there was no eggs.

This is the only cake recipe I use now! This cake is great for those with food allergies, and is also suitable for vegans.  This cake is absolutely amazing as is, but I have also tried many variations with great success; gluten free (rice flour/potato starch & Xanthan gum), I've made it mocha by substituting coffee for water, and I've also done a vanilla version (by omitting cocoa powder) topped with mini chocolate chips and coconut before baking- this one was a favorite! Thanks for such a great, and versatile recipe for those on strict diets & and those who are not!

A childhood favorite. I remember baking these things on cold rainy afternoons. When it was done we'd have a warm slice down by the fire & watch scary movies. Great with vanilla icing & hot chocolate.

I made this recipe three times in eight days, trying to get it right.  The first time I made it exactly as directed, and I found it not quite sweet enough.  The second time I added an extra half cup of sugar and some chocolate chips, and it completely fell in the middle and was also way too crumbly.
Tonight was the third time.  I replaced half the oil with a 4-oz. container of sweetened applesauce and replaced the water with brewed and completely cooled coffee.  It was sweeter, much more moist and baked up perfectly.  I topped mine with powdered sugar.  I will make it like this from now on.

I have been making this recipe for years and it is a family favorite, tender and very moist and doesn't last long in our house. I recently decided to do a variation for lemon cake when I had 3 lemons that needed to be used. Here's what I did. Eliminate the cocoa. Use lemon extract instead of vanilla. Zest 2 lemons and combine with the dry ingredients.  In a 1 cup liquid measuring cup, squeeze those 2 lemons, then add enough water to make the specified 1 cup of water. Proceed with recipe as stated. After cake has cooled, frost as desired. I used another lemon and zested it and used the lemon juice in the frosting. This is nicely lemony and has been added into our dessert rotation.  If you plan on eating this the same day, I would lightly grease the cake pan. For next day serving, it is not necessary. I do not prepare this directly in the cake pan; I combine dry and liquid ingredients separately, then combine wet into dry ingredients, and only mix until just combined, then pour into (prepared) baking pan. You end up using an extra bowl, but I don't worry that some of the dry ingredients get 'stuck' in the corners of the pan and don't get combined properly. Thanks for sharing the original recipe and enjoy my variation, too. Love them both.

I will never make my old chocolate cake recipe again. This was mixes, poured and done in no time. The only change I made was mixed it in a bowl and uses 3/4 cup coffee and 1/4 cup water. Made 30 mini cupcakes on 350 for 10 minutes. They were gone soon after. I simply topped with Cool Whip. My son had a good idea of filling regular sized cupcakes with the Cool Whip and topping with Powdered Sugar.  I was worried about tasting the coffee but NO ONE had a clue it was in there.

The only things I would change are using 3/4 cup of sugar, 1/3 cup of cocoa and 5 tablespoons of oil.  This is a super cake, especially warm with ice cream or whipped cream

I love this cake. I've made it now several times. My 2 year old little girl is allergic to milk. I first found it when looking for a milk free cake recipe for her first birthday. It's now a regular treat in our house. I just made it again tonight. I have my family making it too. We all like it better than a boxed chocolate cake. Excellent!

This cake is by far the BEST plain-old chocolate cake ever!  It is moist & dense & even better when aged a day or 2.  Easy to dress up with a handful of chocolate chips or dried fruit, and bake in a fluted pan.  I usually make with white vinegar instead of cider.

This cake is hands down the best homemade chocolate cake I have ever baked! Beats any boxed variety or recipe, including those made with butter and eggs! I made two of these today. The first I followed the recipe exactly except I used distilled white vinegar instead of cidar. I was reluctant to follow the steps and just beat everything together in a bowl, but I didn't and followed the directions and I'm glad I did. This recipe requires VERY little mixing. Over mixing will result in a less airy cake. Don't mess it up! I frosted this cake with the frosting found on a texas sheet cake recipe from this site, per another reviewer. AWESOME COMBO! The second cake I made, I omitted the cocoa and oil, and instead used 2 mashed ripe bananas in their place and about 1/2 tsp. allspice. I sprinkled the batter with walnuts before baking. Absolutely fantastic! Thanks for the recipe, I don't think I could ever go back to a boxed cake again!

almost the same as mine ~  Try coffee instead of water and ~ sprinkle it very liberally with cinnamon sugar before baking.  makes a nice SWEET crust that complements the chocolate and coffee flavors.  That's how the fam likes theirs!!

for the ease and minimal ingredients, a great go-to recipe! moist and dark and entirely satisfying.  i sprinkled a big handful of semi-sweet choc chips over the top and swirled a bit to incorporate. they turn into melty pockets of chocolately goodness.  i also subbed half the oil with mashed bananas, did half whole-wheat flour, and half splenda.  it made me feel less guilty about eating nearly half the pan within half an hour.  also used cold coffee instead of water.

I thought this was a bit rubbery in texture, but it tasted good, considering there isn't any butter in it. I served it with powdered sugar sprinkled on top.

I was very skeptical of this cake I only made it because I have looked everywhere for a cake recipe that my sister can eat (she has irritable bowel syndrom and cannot eat eggs or dairy) I made it for dessert tonight and the entire family loved and my sister was soooo happy that she could finally eat chocolate cake again!  I just melted some sugar in a pot and poured it on top like a glaze because my sister cant have icing.  excellent recipe, better then most cakes that have milk and eggs!

This was an amazing cake. My mother-in-law, who had never heard of it, loved it!  My kids were thrilled and gobbled it up without any frosting!  It was easy to double in put in a 9X13 pan. It also served as a great science lesson for my kids - although they were slightly dissappointed it didn't explode like their volcanoe powered by vinegar and baking soda had!

Made from ingredients that are always in the cupboard, even simpler than a boxed mix and tastier too!

I've been making this recipe for years now and I loooooove it! I make mine in a 9 inch cake pan for 25 minutes though. That way, the center stays just slightly gooey. So simple and doesn't make a big mess. Best when served warm with homemade whipped cream or cool whip.

Easy recipe, and easy to modify. I’ve made this before according to the instructions and it was excellent.  This time though, I used Special Dark cocoa and increased the vanilla a 1/4 tsp. I made a double recipe and also made another cake that added orange extract and about 1/4 tsp dehydrated orange peel.  It smells amazing!  The strange cast iron pan in the background is an abelskiver pan.  I made 7 mini-cakes in it.

This cake is super easy. It is almost near identical the King Arthur sites Original Cake-Pan Cake. I used Ghiradelli chocolate chips and cocoa, milk for the water, and I only had Modena white wine vinegar and it worked fine. I also added one .07 oz packet of Nescafe instant house blend coffee. The King Arthur recipe includes an optional icing, at the bottom of the page, which is a mix of 1 1/2 cups of semi sweet chocolate chips melted with 1/2 cup of half and half. That worked great and I poured it on after the cake had only been out of the oven 5-10 minutes. They also include a modern day optional version of mixing everything which I used. I let the cake cool longer at room temp and then refrigerated. It is great from the refrigerator. I like that this recipe does not include cracking or beating eggs. It all fit great in a 9X9 pan. I just sprayed it with a little Bakers Joy. The total calories with icing comes to about 223 cut into 16 pieces.

My mother made this cake almost every Sunday evening for desert during WWII and it became the family favorite. I have had to make copies of the recipe for all daughters in law and granddaughters as well as several friends. They can't believe the ease of mixing it and lack of normal ingredients. We usually ate it warm right out of the oven with "oleo" on it. She also had a spice cake recipe that called for dark syrup instead of sugar for sweetner. Sugar was rationed. There was no crisco, either. It is quite moist also.

I'm giving the recipe 5 stars not because it's the best tasting cake I've ever had, but because it's the easiest. It's the easiest to make, to alter (I've made just about every flavor you can think of)and everyone who's had it has raved. Sure, you could make something more elaborate, but for someone without a lot of time, it's perfect.

I've made this cake over and over again and it's hard to mess up! You can chocolate chips or any other yummy surprises to the batter. You can use any kind of liquid and it will still turn out great! I've done chocolate milk in place of water. I think using coffee is a wonderful idea and I'm going to try that next time. It's great, its easy, and it's cheap! :)

Very good recipe for making with kids because it's safe to lick the batter spoon! This came out great, almost indistinguishable from our regular choc. cake recipe. Very dense and moist. We added extra cocoa powder, vanilla, and used melted coconut oil for the oil. I frosted i and am storing it in the freezer to keep it nice longer, just thaw 15 min before slicing.

I have made this several times, and this time, I decided to eliminate the cocoa. I used milk as the liquid, although I have used coffee when making the chocolate version. It's so versatile, cheap and easy. Especially the vanilla version would be great with fruit of any kind: for example, drained crushed pineapple, using pineapple juice for the liquid.

This recipe for "wacky cake" was in the back of an American Girl book my daughter had. We tried it and thought it was excellent. Last weekend, I made a two-layer 1/2 sheet cake for my husband's boss' appreciation party. I wanted the bottom layer to be chocolate, so I used this no-fail recipe. Moist, chocolately, delicious - a winner every time!

This was so good!  I took the advice of others and made an icing of powdered sugar, margarine, milk and icing, but I also added a splash of vanilla.  Everyone in my family agreed this is a five.

I was a little nervous  to try this recipe at first, but it is amazing. It rises almost as well as a regular cake, but it tastes just like one. I had someone tell me that it is probably the best cake they'd eaten! I will make this again.

I followed the directions to the letter, but the cake tasted awful.  Not even the kids would eat it.  It was slightly better the next day, but I still wouldn't make it again.

This is great!  I worked with a lot of people with food allergies and this was perfect!  I used canola oil instead of vegetable oil and it seemed to make it a little lighter.  Plus I made them as cupcakes like another user said. (375 for 25 minutes)And I put chocolate frosting that I made ans substituted vegan butter and soy milk. I'll use it again and again.

This cake is moist, dense, and flavorful, my whole family including my cake-critic husband LOVED it. When I first made the cake, I omitted the cocoa to make a white cake and it was great. I think it would work well as an all-purpose cake recipe where you could add flavors as desired (cocoa, spices, almond, etc). I also think it would work well as a substitute pound cake since it is so moist and dense - but doesn't have all that butter. We are using this instead of boxed cakes from now on.

The only problem was that I accidentally overcooked mine so it was a bit dry. I put in a toothpick and it came out wet so I decided to wait a tiny bit longer. Max 4 minutes longer. Somehow that was too long! Strange.   This recipe is also very good if you add some dry cherries in. Yummy.

This is the exact recipe my mom gave me for wacky cake. The same cake we had in school during the 60's. My mom worked for the Newport Mesa School district in the kitchens and that is where she got  recipe from.
One of the attributes of this cake (and the reason it was called wacky cake) is because any time during the baking you can remove it from the oven, bake something else, then replace it back to finish cooking and it does not change or hurt the finished product at all. This is what my mother told me. True? I assume so!

The recipe is wonderful! If you were like me you are probably wondering how there are so many great reviews for a cake without eggs, milk, or butter. Just give it a try! It is VERY moist, maybe a bit too moist for people who like their cake firm, but if you aren't particular, you will LOVE this recipe. My dad was skeptical until I gave him a piece (I made some simple coconut icing) and he said it was amazing! Not to mention it is probably the easiest cake I've ever made. I will definitely be making this again very soon.

I love this recipe! My family always made this when I was little and this recipe tastes as good as I remember.  Don't forget to have fun with some simple stencils or doilies. After my daughters and I made the cake, I cut out a stencil of their initials and sifted powdered sugar on top. Simple, but it made some smiles!

I have reviewed many recipes for this cake. I don't need a 9x13 size so this one is perfect! I was very happy to find a recipe that hadn't been altered in the reviews so much that you couldn't be sure if the original recipe was any good stand alone. Thanks for a great recipe!

I learned to  make this cake in girls club (far too many years ago!) and it was always a favorite of my dad's and is now a favorite of my family.  A great recipe to start kids baking.  It's runny so place it carefully in the oven so that it bakes evenly.  Almost any topping finishes off this delicious chocolate cake!

This cake tasted better than I feared it would.  We had ours with powdered sugar sprinkled on top.  It's a great recipe to have in case you need a quick dessert and don't have a lot of ingredients on hand.

An absolute keeper!  I made this last night and it was phenominal.  I had mine topped with neopolitan frozen yogurt and my boyfriend had his plain.  He said it was the best cake I had ever made!  No more boxed cakes for me :)  This worked up quick--which is always nice--and who can say no to a one-pan recipe?

It was very simple to make and turned out soft and spongy and raised well , enough so i could create a layer cake. I used Fat Free cool whip (Kraft) for  icing both layers which gave a nice contrast to the looks and taste.I sifted the dry ingredients , dusted the pan, used Wax paper in the base of cake pan and scaledthe recipe to 16 serves,baked in a heart shaped tin . Believe it or not ureally mix with a fork, no vigorous whipping required. poor stamina in 34th week pregnant- no issue.

I thought this recipe was lost to us forever! My sister (who could burn water) used to make this all the time, but messed it up. When she made it, it would BOUNCE! If you do not sift anything & beat the mixture way too long (we THINK this is what she did) it becomes very dense & when dropped (or thrown at your siblings) it bounces. I just made this again after 30 some years, but got a wonderful fluffy cake, I'm going to try to repeat the "bouncing cake" I remember from so long ago! I will let you know what happens!

Definately among the better of the Wacky cakes I have tried for my egg-allergic daughter! Although, we made cupcakes with them, and they were a little "heavy", the taste was great. : )

My mom is a proffesional cake decorator who uses boxed mixes, and I told her to try this!  This is the best!  It reminds me of devil's food because it is a little reddish in color. This recipe is suitable for vegans and it's perfect for camping trips (dutch oven) and emergency food supply since nothing spoils!

My son is allergic to eggs and this is a fantastic alternative. I’ve made it 20+ times over the last several years. I bring it to holidays and family functions as well as dessert for my own house. This is a must for individuals with AND without egg/dairy allergies.

This is a great eggless/dairy free chocolate cake. It’s very moist and perfect for decorating. I made this in a 6x2 pan . There is enough batter for two layers. Only alterations I made was adding mini chocolate chips to the batter and a tablespoon of instant coffee ground to really bring out the chocolate flavor.

I've made this 3 times exactly as is. My Mom made Wacky Cake years ago.

I put Lemon Cream Cheese frosting on mine that I make with a fresh lemon. That's the crowning glory!!

I made this cake with gluten free all purpose flour.  It turned out amazing!!  Used Balsamic vinegar as suggested by one of the reviews.  Delicious!   Made it with caramel fudge icing.  Everyone loved it.

I have been making the Wacky Cake since I was a child in the sixties. For many years I thought "Wacky Cake" was a name my mom made up. I had forgotten about it for many years when It popped up in a search for vegan dessert. I don't know if anyone else has had a problem with it sticking to the pan, and I don't remember it happening years ago. Many of the recipies I found called for an ungreased pan. I've had cakes stick but never to the extent of this one. I crumbled it up and used it to make a Trifle. No biggie--next time I made it in two 8" round pans sprayed very thoroughly with Pam. I tried to unmold one shortly after baking as some recipes suggest and it stuck hopelessly. I let the other one cool to luke warm and it, too, stuck so I made another trifle LOL but I can't find the problem. I compared many recipes regarding pans, oven temp, ingredients, etc. and can't figure out where I went wrong. My mom just made it for my b'day last week and it was fine. I'll try grease and flour next time.  No doubt it is me not the recipe causing it.

My hubby loves chocolate, so I made this for Father’s Day. I doubled the recipe for a 9 x13 pan & baked for 10 more minutes. I used the chocolate glaze icing on this site w/condensed milk, dark choc. chips & vanilla. My family really enjoyed it! This is a quick, easy & good go-to chocolate cake recipe.

Excellent! I made these two ways. One with all purpose flour, they came out moist and delicious! The second with gluten-free flour.  It was very good too! Slightly oily on the bottom (next time reduce oil by 2 tbls) and a bit chewy (similar to a brownie texture) but I would definitely make them both again. Thanks for a wonderful recipe that let’s me take all our allergies into consideration.

I have made this recipe multiple times as written.  It's just perfect!  Chocolatey and moist.  Since it is made in the pan, it is easy to make as many pans or layers as needed.  
For a vanilla cake, I omitted the cocoa and added two tsp vanilla instead of the one.  
Both make a great option for a household with milk and egg allergies.  No one is the wiser since these cakes taste as good as a cake made with eggs and milk.

I don’t eat dairy and this is my favorite cake recipe. It’s quick, easy and has ingredients I always have on hand. I sometimes make a quick frosting/glaze of peanut butter, powdered sugar and almond milk. Yummy.

This is a wonderful cake! I was looking for an egg free cake recipe and this was perfect. It was moist and light and chocolatey. I used the last of my Coco, about 3 scant tablespoons  and it was still very chocolatey! Thanks so much for sharing! this is going to be a family favorite!

Definitely a keeper. Made the recipe as cupcakes. It was a joint effort with my wife. I did the batter and baked the cupcakes and she took care of the frosting.
Everyone loved them. The cake is very tasty and so easy to put together.

Perfect as-is. Delicious with a dusting of powdered sugar. I sometimes add chocolate chips to the batter with good results.

I doubled this recipe and used a 9x13 pan. Super yummy and moist. I have made it twice now.  I was shocked by how it came out and also how it didn't really stick to the pan. I did not sift the dry ingredients I just dumped them into the pan and then mixed well before doing the rest just like it says.

This was super easy.I used 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup stevia for baking instead of all sugar.  It turned out really well.  I did not use frosting it was good without it.

If you need a little dessert  in a hurry, this is a great one!  Ingredients that are right there in your pantry, and quick and easy to mix up.  I wouldn't change anything, except next time I will mix it up in a bowl and then put it in the pan.  Some of the dry ingredients lingered in the corners of pan.  Be sure to put some frosting on it!  I will be making it again!

I made this yesterday for a friend who cannot eat eggs. One thing I will do differently next time--I will mix all the dry ingredients in a bowl and then put them into the cake pan. Mixing them all together well in the pan is difficult. I also agree with a reviewer who said the cake is best the next day. Do not rush it. Allow it to cool completely and then frost it. I frosted mine with a simple chocolate buttercream. Considering the humble ingredients, the low cost, the fact that most will typically have the ingredients on hand, and the fact that there are no eggs or dairy in the recipe--it's an impressively delicious cake.  My family thought it was quite rich and sweet. Note: one reviewer stated that you should have your "greased pan" ready to go before beginning. Please note that the pan is to be "ungreased."

I have been making this recipe for 5 years now and it never fails me! Perfect for children's birthdays and a nut/dairy/egg allergy free cake.  It's always moist and not too sweet, unlike most chocolate cakes. I have shared this with many people.

This is a good cake recipe for those with allergies.  My daughter easily made it gluten-free by using a combination of chick pea flour and potato starch, and sugar-free by using xylitol.  It tasted much better than many recipes developed particularly for allergies.  It's not easy to find good cake recipes without eggs; thanks for this keeper!

I had this recipe 25 years ago and lost it. This is exactly the recipe I had. It is moist. It's perfect when you are out eggs and if you are on a budget. It's very good. I find just dusting with powder sugar works just as well.

I LOVE this simple cake!  This week I made it Wheatbelly style using almond flour and low carb sweetener.  Came out like Brownies!!!  We loved it and what a neat thing for our 'wacky' way of eating these days.

Made this cake with the kids on a snow day today. We added chocolate chips and I'm glad we did because the cocoa alone would not have been chocolaty enough for our tastes. Poured ours into mini muffin tins and baked for 25 minutes. So easy and so yummy! Who needs to buy cake mix anymore?

Great chocolate cake, and I hate chocolate cake (thus, the 4 stars is just a personal opinion).  Instead of taking all these separate steps, I just mixed all ingredients together.  When I added in the vinegar and the baking soda, I made sure to put them in on opposite sides of the bowl in the beginning.

I also added in 1/2 a banana.  Turned out great!  Looked really runny when putting it in the pan, but came out light and fluffy.  Rose well.  Def a keeper.

I made this same recipe back in the 70's and  80's- many times I would double for  cut up animal birthday cakes for my girls with boiled  sugar frosting - they would  love it. Its a  great  simple  cake for  a company  dinner - its  moist,easy,yummy--- retro  recipe it is, but its worth the try-you will love it .

Excellent cake.  I doubled the recipe and used a little less sugar.  Served with whipped cream and raspberries.  Will make again and will also try the non-chocolate version.  A quick and tasty dessert.

Did not really believe that this recipe would turn out soooooooo good, but after reading all the reviews, I thought I would give it a try. The only thing I did differently was to use white vinegar because I did not have the other kind and  I added chocolate chips, sprinkled them acros the top, then swirled them in with a knife. This cake turned out absolutely delicious! I also used a chocolate buttercream frosting from the site to frost this cake, although I think it really did not need the frosting. I can see how this cake could be eaten up very quickly.

Love this recipe and have made it many times as written, it is so very yummy.  But I  have been trying get a little more healthy,  so I have been fiddling with the recipe. I substituted half white whole wheat flour, dropped the oil to 3 tablespoons, added 3 tablespoons of unsweetened applesauce and used granulated Splenda instead of sugar. I also added 1 teaspoon of molasses, as I like brown sugar with chocolate. I was not really hoping for much, but oh my - it was fabulous - soft and tender, fine-grained and moist. I would never have guessed, if I did not know, that it was made with Splenda and whole wheat. Will try next time to use all whole wheat and lower the oil content to maybe one tablespoon. It did seem to take less time to bake both times I have made these changes, only about 23 minutes, I assume because of the lack of sugar, so watch for that. To me, this cake only needs a glaze or powdered sugar on top - I made a quick bowl of frosting, but it was too much for the delicate cake. If you have dietary or caloric restrictions, give these changes a try!

I was disappointed in this recipe.  It didn't rise and I felt that the apple cider vinegar came through too much.  The taste is okay but the vinegar smell nearly ruins it.

Fabulous!! I added a heaping teaspoon of espresso powder, mixed all the wet ingredients together then added to dry and sprinkled chopped up semi sweet chocolate on top before baking. Cake was done in 30 minutes.  Never would I have guessed that the result was eggless. The cake is super moist and the extra chocolate made frosting unnecessary. Definitely a keeper.

Loved this cake! Had a sweet tooth going but very limited supplies in the house. This cake did the trick! Followed recipe exactly except added in mint chocolate chips into the batter! Put whipped cream on top after it cooled down and it was amazing :)

This cake is so moist and delicious.  I have been making it for a long time.  I always add a couple extra tablespoons of cocoa.  You can make it in just a few minutes.  It is so good with buttercream frosting.

I used to make this cake with my parents as a kid.  It was so fun to make it one pan.  I now make it with my kids.  No need to tinker with it at all.  The cake is amazingly moist and extremely easy to make.  I always get a lot of compliments when I make it.  It is great with no frosting and just a dusting of powdered sugar.

Wow.  I am not a big fan of cake but I had to make one and decided to try this.  This recipe made me a fan of Wacky Cake.  Moist, easy and delicious.

This recipe was our family favorite for entire family.  We all LOVED it.
My mother would dust the warm cake with confectioner's sugar.
I still make the cake but have changed one ingredient...
I use Coconut Oil instead of vegetable oil (just warm the coconut oil in the microwave for 30 seconds to liquify).
It is incredible with vanilla or coffee ice cream!  I also make this cake with gluten free flour for my daughter...it is still delicious.

Great recipe for kids and beginning bakers! It was one of the first recipes I ever mad by myself as a child, from a Depression-era cookbook. It also makes a good 1st Birthday cake for a baby -- with no eggs or dairy. It was great to find the recipe again!

Delicious!  The only change I made was to use a cup of cold coffee in place of the water...soo good!  I also recommend chilling the cake before serving...so moisi it doesn't need icing!

One of the most delicious and moist chocolate cakes I have ever tasted!  I decided to make this after reading the other reviews, and I just have to add my own 5-star review to this one.  Easy to make, minimal cleanup (just the pan and a fork), and delicious.  I brought this to work and everybody loved it.

What can I say but "Delish"!  I doubled the recipe, used a 9x13 pan and finished it off with "Easy Chocolate Bundt Cake Glaze" from this site.(I ran out of confectionary sugar to make my usual frosting.) I also mixed all the dry ingredients and added them to the wet ingredients using separate bowls. I brought it to my bible study group and the young boys were fighting over the crumbs that were left in the pan! This is an easy fabulous cake. I was asked to make this again. Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe!!!!!!

I have been eyeing this recipe for a long time and have decided to finally make it this morning. Without reading the instructions first, I asked my 2.5 year old if he wanted a 'Schokokuchen' or 'Schokomuffins' and he opted for the latter. I did the measuring and he did the stirring. I used what I had on hand, that is, white distilled vinegar for cider vinegar, and sunflower oil for vegetable oil. The batter tasted a bit sour but the end result was perfect. Not too sweet and just the right amount of cocoa. I evenly divided the batter into 12 silicon lined muffin cups and baked for about 20 minutes or so. I let them cool a bit before popping them out of the silicon cups. They were a huge hit with my two small boys!! They turned out fluffy and moist. I wonder how they would taste with raspberry or strawberry jam injected in the center and topped with a vanilla mascarpone frosting on top. I admit that I usually have a hard time finding a good chocolate/cocoa recipe, but this is a keeper! Thanks for sharing this recipe, Mary!

Excellent cake!  I also use this recipe for muffins sometimes adding a ripe banana or 2 to it and have recently tried it minus the cocoa but with grated apple and cinnamon.  It stays very moist and delicious for several days.

Delicious!  Made a single layer heart shaped cake with PB icing.  Hubby loved it.  Next time maybe more chocolate or 1/2 coffee to enhance the chocolate flavor.

I read on here the reason one person thought it was called Wacky Cake was because it could be taken out of the oven and baked more when time permitted...Wow! didn't even know that. I always assumed it was because there were no eggs, milk or butter in the recipe.  This was a cake my mom made for us growing up in the 60's and 70's.  My whole family LOVED it.  Who woulda known we were eating "health food"?  Now my husband has to watch his cholesterol and I love to bake.  Made this for him and he was sooo happy :)  I didn't know that you could omit the cocoa for a white cake.  I will definitely try that.

I really wanted to bake something last night only to find i had 1 egg and no pb. so even no bakes were out.  Then i remembered about this recipe in my box.  I was a little scared off by the cider vinegar and well i've never made a no dairy no eggs cake ever. This recipe just blew me away. It was dark really dark it rose well and it it super moist. I used 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup of strong coffee. Like amother reviewer did.  But i'm sure just water would have been great. This recipe beats any chocolate cake i've ever made. I'm sharing a piece of it right now with my almost 2yr old. When he took his first bit he kept saying Hmm.  I'm going to be coping this recipe into my personal recipe book. Its that incredible! thanks you much Mary!

I LOVE this recipe. It's one of the few things I can make for some of my vegan friends or if I happen to be out of milk and eggs. There are a few things I have changed: I use canola oil instead of vegetable oil, and I sometimes substitute the 1 c. water for 1 c. brewed coffee (hazelnut flavored) and sprinkle it with cinnamon sugar before baking. Both the original recipe and this variation are delicious.

I give this recipe 5 stars because for the ease of making, great taste and texture, you just can't beat it! My mom always made this when I was a kid. She would sprinkle confectioner's sugar on and that is how I serve it, as well. I made the 9x13 version today and cut it into squares and froze it for quick snacks for my children. Next time, I am going to bake cupcakes to freeze so that I can pop them in their lunchboxes for special treats. I love that you can mix this in the pan, that it is very inexpensive to make, and most of all, that it really tastes fantastic. There is no reason for me to buy a boxed mix again! This is just as good and is fine for kid's birthday cakes.   I made a couple of substitutions: I bake with a mixture of 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 wheat flour. I also used 1/2 milk and 1/2 water to make it more nutritious. I have never tried it with the coffee, but plan to try that sometime. I think with coffee as the liquid and a rich frosting, this would also be fine as a grown-up dessert for company.   LOVE this recipe! (Also thinking it could be scaled down to be a "cake in a cup" recipe for the microwave...although it's so easy it's worth just making it as is!)

I wasn't sure about this cake to begin with, but a friend told me about it so I gave it a try.  What a delicious cake!  Moist and chocolatey, oh so yummy.  And I topped it off with an almond glaze.  My mother in law loved it!

I just want to add my raves for this recipe. It is the first chocolate cake recipe given to me by a friend when I was a newlywed over 40 years ago. My husband and I loved it then for its deliciousness and its size (just right for 2), and the whole family loves it now for its taste, its moistness, and its ease of making with the kids. It doubles great, so am making it for a crowd today. We usually ate it without frosting, because it's so moist and yummy on its own - and we're not big frosting eaters.  So glad to find it online, as I haven't made it for a while and have no time to scrounge for the piece of paper I wrote it on years ago.

I found this recipe in a "favorite Recipes of Home Economics Teachers" from 1963.  It makes sense to hear that originally it came from a depression era source.  I use a fudge frosting on it.  My grandkids beg for more when they finish one cake!  It's great with vanilla ice cream.  Strange how so few ingredients can taste so good.

Thanks so much...from a newcomer family to food allergies (dairy, casein, egg & peanuts). I actually mixed the dry ingredients first and made wells in the bowl, then mixed together. (I misread the instructions to do it all in the pan).  After that, I transferred into the 8x8 pan.  Baked as directed.  Turned out moist and delicious. Will probably grease the pan next time since I know I will be making this over and over again!

I could not get this cake out of the pan, so will grease it next time. It uses easy ingredients that I had in the cupboard.

Moist, dense, and yummy.  My 4 year old helped make it because it was so easy, but was sad that that was no bowl to lick. I, however, love that there are no beaters or bowl to clean!  So fast, easy, and yummy, that it's dangerous to my diet.

This cake turned out great!  Our boys are allergic to eggs so I used this recipe for their birthday cake.  I topped it with a homemade chocolate fudge frosting and sprinkles.  The boys and everyone else loved it.  Thanks...I'll be making this one for years to come.

Excellent!  I made it for a nursing friend that's on a dairy-free, egg-free diet for her sensitive baby.  Very chocolaty and moist! I poked a few holes in the top with toothpicks and poured a powdered sugar glaze over it while it was still warm.  Better than "regular" cake!

This was pretty good for using such minimal ingredients -- and no bowls/beaters to clean!  Easy for kids to make, too.  Thanks for the quick dessert recipe!

Quite good!  All I was looking for was a quick dessert at the last minute, and I happened upon this recipe and tried it out because it is the perfect size.  But WOW!  It's really good, especially for the minimal amount of work involved.  I topped it with a peanut butter frosting recipe from this site.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this cake for my son's first birthday because he has many food allergies that prevent him from eating a lot of store-bought food.  I was so happy to find this recipe.  I changed the vegetable oil to canola oil, which didn't make any difference. I made a simple icing using canola oil, powdered sugar, cocoa, and water.  The cake is now a favorite at our house.  It is a delicious, low-fat dessert that everyone can enjoy!
