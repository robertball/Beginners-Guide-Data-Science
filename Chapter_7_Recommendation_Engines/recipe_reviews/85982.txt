this was an interesting version of green bean casserole I am used to. I liked the cream of celery, it had a good flavor but slightly dull. I usually use cream of mushroom and the taste can be overpowering. So maybe mixing the two would be perfect. The stuffing was something I had never tried, I liked that.  The part I didn't like was the canned potatoes, they just had a gross texture.  I think I might try this again using half cream of celery and half cream of mushroom, with boiled potatoes.

This was very good. I used hash brown potatoes instead of the sliced potatoes. I also used a half of can of cream of mushroom and a half of can of cream of celery.

i really enjoy this recipe. i've made it a few times using boiled potatoes (either cubed or small slices) and cream of chicken and cream of mushroom soups. i haven't tried the cream of celery cause my other half isn't a celery fan in general. it takes more time with using the fresh potatoes but i think it's worth the effort. if the salt content/flavor of the cream of ___ soups is too much, try using stuffing that doesn't come pre-seasoned.

This was different. DH liked it more than I did. The only change I made was to use frozen potatoes instead of canned (really hate the canned) but other than that I made this according to the recipe. I'm sure we'll have it again to have something different.

This was excellent. My one year old loved it and so did the rest of the house. I used cream of muchroom instead of cream of celery but kept everything else the same.

This was okay, personally I like the regular green bean casserole better.  But it was nice to have a change.

Truly is the ultimate side dish, no need for anything else for holiday sides, especially if your without much help in the kitchen.

Tried and true, I've made it so many times with so many  variations that I only look at the recipe now to double-check the liquid ratio.  My favorite combo is cauliflower and broccoli (roast cauliflower & onions first in the oven under broil while blanching the broccoli and prepping the rest).

I added a whole bag of frozen corn cause my family loves corn.
That was the only change I made and I had no left-overs.  It was gone.  Will definitely make it again.

This was a hit at a potluck yesterday! The only thing I changed was I used the cream of chicken/cream of mushroom soup combo instead of cream of celery soup. It was so good and got ate up so fast. When I got home I made it again just for the family.??

I made this tonight using fresh boiled potatoes.  My family liked it and I liked it too.  It tasted just like green bean casserole and stuffing mixed together, which, I guess it basically is.  But, it was good.
