I love the flavor of these! I like to grill most of my veggies during the summer, but surprisingly, I had never grilled green beans.  A very simple recipe, but the flavor is impressive. The only issue i have is that once you put the beans on the grill pan, the garlic tends to brown too quickly and gets a bitter taste.  I was able to scoop the beans out of the pan with most of the burnt garlic staying behind in the pan ridges, without worrying about it affecting the flavor too much.  I think next time I will lightly crush the garlic cloves, leaving them mostly whole so that they can easily be lifted out prior to grilling. Thanks for the recipe Kassie!

Made this exactly as described. Oh so good, and a great way to keep the heat out of the kitchen on a hot August night!

Since I was already grilling salmon I decided to throw these on the grill too. I only used 2 tbsp of olive oil and that was plenty enough. 
Seasoned with sea salt before serving and a squeeze of grilled lemon.

i had closer to 11 oz of green beans so i only used 1 T of olive oil and i'm sure i could have used less than that.. instead of minced garlic and kosher salt i used 1/2 tsp of garlic salt so there was no worry about burning fresh garlic.. fyi 10 minutes is way too short to cook green beans.. i believe we grilled ours closer to 30 minutes.. maybe longer..  we stirred them about every 10 minutes.. the end product was very tasty and definitely a do over.. just not with the amounts or cook time listed

Very yummy.  I sprinkled on some lemon pepper to give the dish extra zing, and address fresh mushrooms to the grill pan toward the end of the cook time.

I would reduce the olive oil just the second time I made it. However, this is an awesome recipe for the summer! Loved the flavor the grill gave these green beans. Wonderful!

Fast and great taste. Used frozen beans. Seasoned to taste with garlic powder, salt and pepper. Baked in the pan in some olive oil. This is a keeper.

Our new favorite green bean recipe! My husband said "I don't like green beans but I loved these!"  Next time I'll  try reducing the salt and oil, as I thought it was more than needed. And I'll add pepper because my husband loves pepper on everything. But will definitely make again...maybe tonight!

Loved this recipe.  Originally tried it when beans were first coming on and didn't have enough for canning yet.  My whole family loved it and I have been grilling these great green treasures ever since.

Your description nails it - "incredibly tasty and simple!"  Made this just as written for the 4th of July, unbelievably delicious and oh so easy!  My only problem was I didn't make enough!

We' ve always steamed beans as an improvement to the boiling my Mom taught.  Grilling took us pleasantly out of our comfort zone.  Like other reviewers we made similar modifications.  We used an anodized and perforated wok.  Outdoor cooking is great in the summer to reduce indoor heat.  We substituted garlic for fresh minced rosemary (from the garden) and thyme which was in the fridge.  Garnished with lime juice laying in the fridge.   Everyone loved it.  My personal observation was that stirring the greens on the grill is important for even cooking.  Thanks much!

The only change I made was I cooked it in a cast iron skillet instead of grill. It was delicious.

Made these for dinner guests and was asked for second helpings.  My husband thought they were too salty, so I'll reduce the amount of salt next time.  I pre-cooked the beans a bit less than al dente to decrease the grilling time due to other food on the grill and limited space.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This was fantastic!! I broiled it instead of grilling, and it turned out great. I might decrease the salt a bit the next time that I make it, but it will definitely make a reappearance at my dinner table!

Great flavor. I am going to start grilling all of my veggies. I grilled directly over grates and lost a few but the survivors charred very nicely.

Great recipe! My kids devoured these and the recipe came together quickly which  was exactly what I was looking for. Personally, I would blanch them first then marinate & grill the beans because I prefer a more tender green bean but that's just me.

These are the best green beans.  My family asks for them.  It's a simple recipe but very delicious.
