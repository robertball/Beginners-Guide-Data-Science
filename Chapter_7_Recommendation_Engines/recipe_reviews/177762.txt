Great recipe!Very tasty, wasn't that sure about it because of the tomatoe soup but it was good.My roast was a little bigger than what they suggested so I added a little beef broth to the sauce and it ended up perfect, very tender and moist!

My family really enjoys this roast! First time I made this, I had everything on hand but the plum tomato, so I used a can of Italian-seasoned diced tomatoes instead. I did not drain them, and skipped the 1/2 cup of water and separate seasonings. Came out great, and I continue to prepare it this way. We love garlic, so I do add a little extra... I have also added Italian green beans when I have them. The meat comes out tender, and the tomato "gravy" is a nice change from the standard onion soup/brown gravy/cream of mushroom rut that most roasts for the slow cooker fall into. This has become a staple at our dinner table!  Love it!

This came out GREAT! I made a few tweaks, when my potatoes all had eyes growing from them! Did a sliced onion, and opened a jar of button mushrooms....but the sauce was fantastic...it did need salt, but this is definitely a keeper!

Yum! I've made this twice and both times it has turnhed out great....I didn't have a fresh tomato, so I just opened a canned of fire-roasted diced...I used more spices than the recipe calls for, and also put in some diced onion and fresh mushrooms...I did it on high for 5-1/2 hours, and it probably could have cooked less....I also took the roast out before serving and thickened the liquid into a nice gravy...served over egg noodles...Highly recommend!

This was awesome! it was my first roast and i was making it for my mom so i was real nervous but it was perfect! I had a 4 lbs roast so i just doubled the recipe. The only other change was i rubbed the roast in a Southwestern rub i got at Sam's Club and it added just the right kick to it! It turned out to be like a nice beef stew because the way the rest of it cooked up (more liquidy than the normal cream of mushroom soup roast kinda thing) Overall it was amazing and i will DEFINITELY be making this again soon!

My first attempt at slow cooking - not too bad.  Followed the recipe, only substituted beef broth for the water.  The roast could have had more flavor, but could not have been more tender - cut it with a fork!  Hubby and son loved it and have requested it again.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this with a bag of frozen stew veggies - chunks of potatoes, carrots, celery, and onions. I used red wine vinegar. After 10 hours on low the roast was falling apart tender. It was very flavorful.  I would definitely make this again.

This was a good recipe and cooking 10 hours on LOW was plenty, I used chuck and it cut with a fork like butter.  The veggies were really good but the meat seemed to lack a bit of flavor.  You definitely need to make a gravy out of the sauce to cover the meat.

We have our kids and grandkids over every week for dinner.  I wanted to try something different instead of the same old pot roast - they loved this.  It reminded me of a thick veggie-beef soup.  Thanks for sharing!

Not a bad recipe... easy and a pretty good flavor, but it was missing something. I would consider making again once I figure out what needs to be changed. I used two bags of Meijer frozen stew veggies, the can of soup, a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes instead of fresh, and the garlic and spices. I didn't have any vinegar, so I used juice from half a lemon to act as a meat tenderizer instead. (Put the roast in a bowl and put the juice on it, and let it sit while I prepared the rest) For the meat, I used about 4lbs of angus chuck eye roast, because the meat counter associate recommended it over the others listed on the recipe. I cooked for 4 hours on high, without removing the cover at all. The meat turned out perfect -- when I pushed on it with a wooden spoon it just broke in half because it was so tender. It absorbed a little bit of the flavor of the ingredients, which was nice. Since the veggies were so tender and breaking apart as well, I just broke apart the entire roast, mixed it in and made it like a stew. Overall the flavor was only ok. It seems like a good jumping off point, but I think I would like it better if the tomato flavor was more robust, like in spaghetti sauce. In this recipe, the tomato is more like a base and not so much a primary component of the flavor. Maybe adding another can of tomatoes would have done the trick.

This was just... "meh"  for me.  The meat and vegetables cooked nicely, but it didn't seem to have much of any flavor.  I have to add, I'm not much of a pot-roast fan to begin with, but still...this recipe didn't wow me at all.

I followed the last review and substituted diced tomatoes (drained) for the fresh tomato.  I also used beef stock instead of water.  It was a nice change.  will make again.

I made a couple small changes to the recipe to use what I had on hand and to add more flavor. I rubbed the roast with spices and seared the meat on all sides in a hot pan before adding it to the crockpot. I layered one sliced onion and a couple bay leaves in the bottom of the crockpot before laying in the roast. I did not have plum tomatoes, I used one half can of drained/rinsed petite diced tomatoes. I did follow the recipe's footnotes for a thicker gravy once the roast was done cooking. Though we ate this, all of us thought this would have made a better stew than a roast. It was a hearty meal that was easy to prepare.

The thing that's missing to give it some zing is mustard...! I always put that in my beef stew and pot roast. You really need to 'season highly' when you use the crock pot. The meat is cooking for such a long time, it needs FLAVOR..!!  'Plain old salt' is not what you need... the addition of a couple of teaspoons of granulated beef bullion (or a package of dry onion soup mix)  will add the 'salt' you need, PLUS a hit of beef and onion flavor..! YUM.. Happy cooking..!!

I made this on high for just under 5 hours.  It was amazing!  Instead of making the juices thicker I just took all the veg out and made gravy.  Awesome, awesome recipe!

I made this just as is and my only complaint is that it was bland.  Next time I'll add more seasoning to it for flavor.  Other than that it was great.

After reading other reviews, I also added a can of Italian diced tomatoes, undrained, instead of a plum tomato, and did not add the water.  After cooking I took the chuck roast out of the pan, skimmed fat of the top of the juices, shredded the beef into bite sized pieces, and thickened the juices with flour/water to make gravy.  Turned out more like a stew.  I also added a chopped onion.  Next time, I will refrigerate the juices to get rid of the fat on top and serve the meal the next day.

Meat was so tender and flavor was great.  My husband and daughter who are not big meat eaters even had seconds.  I did make a few additions, I put salt, pepper, floured the roast and seared it.  I also sauted the garlic and added chopped onions.

WOULD HAVE LIKED TO "SPICE IT UP" WITH SOMETHING HOT...I.E., RED PEPPER.  WILL TRY THE NEXT TIME.  IT WAS VERY GOOD.

This was decent.  The beef was kind of dry after cooking for about 10 hours, but the flavor was decent.  Not my favorite pot roast recipe.

This was pretty good.  I used a can of diced fire roasted tomatoes, drained, instead of the fresh tomato and used beef stock instead of water.  I thickened the sauce at the end to a thin gravy consistency.

The tomato soup makes for a fantastic sauce! Wouldn't make any changes except perhaps adding in peas during the last hour and adding 1 onion in big chunks. Tasty!

I am 53 and I have been looking for the "FAMILY ROAST" for years and years!  Finally!  I made it just as written and my family never said a word during dinner. They were too busy enjoying dinner! (oh-I guess I did change one thing because I couldn't find it in the store-I had to buy one can of DelMonte Italian tomatoes and added one regular cut up plum tomato for the medium Italian plum tomato it called for)   Thank you Campbell's Kitchen for the recipe contribution to ALLRECIPES!

Only substitution I made was using green beans instead of celery because nobody in my family likes celery.  I don't know if it's my slow cooker (it's a Cuisinart electronic) but the meat was way overcooked and tough and the veggies were not cooked enough and crunchy.  Terrible!  I didn't think it was especially tasty either.  If it was tasty, I would try it again, this time putting the veggies in first and then adding the meat a few hours later.

I was so looking forward to eating this dish. I followed the directions verbatim with the exception of the time. 10-12 hours sounded way too long. It smelled great all day and after about 8 and 1/2 hours it was totally overcooked. So disappointing!

I prepared this dish today.  It was just ok.  Not really "zesty".  If I make this again, I will add onion for more flavor.  The recipe sounded so good.  Very disappointed.
