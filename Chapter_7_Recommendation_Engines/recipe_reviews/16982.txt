I made a few changes that made this a 5 star recipe for me.  I doubled the amount of lime juice and garlic and allowed the chicken to marinate overnight for a flavorful, juicy chicken breast.  I served this topped with black bean salsa (from this website) and a pepper jack quesadilla with guacomole on the side. Wonderful!!

Very good marinade.  Overall, the chicken turned out moist and citrusy with a little kick from the red pepper flakes. I used olive oil vs. veg. oil and cut the boneless chicken into chunks before marinating to make kabobs.  I also added some white wine vinegar to tenderize the chicken.  I didn't have fresh oregano so I used dried.  I let this marinate for 8 hours and skewered this with red and green peppers, cherry tomatoes, and red onion.

This a very easy recipe for chicken breasts. The marinade adds lots of tangy flavor. We ate the chicken plain with artichokes, however I bet it would be delicious in a salad.

Very tasty.  Flavors were very subtle though.  I think next time I'll marinate longer.  Also used dried oregano as I did not have fresh.  Will definitely make again!

Very good and simple marinade.  I did put the chicken in overnight.  Added more lime juice, garlic and red pepper - also a little cayenne.  Will use this often for the ease and flavor.  Thank you!!

I always cut chicken breasts in half so they're thinner, and this recipe rewarded that, because with just 2 hours marinating the flavors really came through. I'm so tired of chicken marinades that don't really permeate the meat, but not here. The lime, garlic and pepper were very present. Sadly, the pepper flakes only ended up on half of my piece. Next time I'll use cayenne or hot sauce to make sure I get an even coating of spice. I served it with rice pilaf and grilled pineapple spears and was told to "Make this again!" We loved it!
****Update***** Made this for Mom and she only let put in a dash or two of hot sauce, afraid of too much heat. It was much worse for the change, tasting like lime chicken, with not much else going on. Do not omit or reduce the pepper flake or sauce, it's really needed to make this dish shine.

Very good marinade for chicken.  I ended up marinating two boneless chicken breasts and two thighs for almost 2 days, as I didn't cook it the first night I thought I was going to.  It turned out so good and tasty.  The only change I made was to leave out the salt.  Might try a bit more red pepper flakes next time.  Thanks for sharing!

Not bad!  I did leave substitute garlic powder for the fresh garlic since I don't care for the fresh stuff.  It was not as spicy as I expected so next time I will add more pepper flakes.  Overall, it was good and I would make it again.

I was surprised at how well the chicken took the taste of the marinade.  It was a wonderful meal with some fresh steamed green beans and golden cornbread.

Spicy Grilled Chicken Haiku: "Not spicy enough. But the lime was a nice touch. Marinate longer?" The flavor was a bit subtle on this one, perhaps it needed longer marinating than the suggested 1 hour. I didn't really find these to be all that spicy, but the chicken itself was moist, and the citrus had a nice zing, but overall, I wasn't too terribly impressed.

Being a Scotsman, I always rebel at the thought of discarding marinade.  Try heating it in the pan to bubbling (it'll kill all the nasties) and noshing-up onions ... whatever .... so nothing is wasted.
Cheers!

Used lemon instead of lime and 1/2 tsp dried oregano (what I had on hand) and it turned out very tasty but not spicy.  This was probably the most beautiful chicken I have ever grilled, however.  Wish I'd taken a picture.  I used drumsticks and baked in the oven for 30 min then finished on the grill for 10-15 min.  Picture perfect and the family really enjoyed.

This was a fantastic dish, but I doubled up on lime and garlic, but I also added honey to the mix. I used a mix of Jack Daniels Honey BBQ, Corona (for moisture), liquid smoke, and worcheshire sauce, and I basted this mixture all over the chicken to put a great outside layer on the chicken. This was great, and super moist and tasty chicken.

Eye balled most of the ingredients and marinated overnight but other than that, I kept the recipe as is and the end result was the best chicken breast I ever had in my life. Moist, juicy and flavorful. If your looking for an easy recipe with tons of flavor...this is it. Make this today!

I made this for a party and got lots of compliments. I marinated for about 7 hours and served with mango salsa. The chicken was juicy and tender.

I loved the way this recipe sounded but like others, I made a few changes.I used Trader Joe"s cubed frozen garlic (2) and Trader Joe"s frozen cilantro (2) instead of the oregano.  I also substituted olive oil for the other oil.  I added a tsp or so of pico/pica original taco sauce to the marinade and grilled the chicken legs on medium for 25-30 mins.  AWESOME!!  I made some cornbread and a salad with romaine,arugula, red pepper, gorganzola cheese and croutons with Trader Joe"s champagne pear dressing.  Mmmmmm delicious summer dinner!!

I rarely review unless the recipe is really good and this one is that good.  It is the best marinade I have found on this site so far.  I followed the instructions exactly and everyone devoured it.  I love the hint of heat that wasn't too much even for my six year-old.  Thanks for sharing this one!

This was very good. I'd give it 4.5 stars.....easy and very tasty. I grilled them on my George Foreman grill. A hint** I marinate meat by making the marinade and then pouring it into a zip loc gallon size bag. I put the meat inside and shake around to coat it and then I put it into a smaller bowl so that the sides of the bag are up and the meat is surrounded by marinade.This way it isn't lying flat and you don't have to turn it constantly.

Substituted plenty of fresh cilantro for the oregano and marinated 24 hours. Originally thought the recipe was fair. It smelled great but even with the extended marinading, the lime flavor was milder than I like. Surprisingly, it was not all that spicy -- even with the addition of a little more red pepper and a few dashes of Tabasco; however... the next day I made a grilled quesadillas from the left over chicken breast. It was absolutely fantastic.

Shredded chicken between two flower tortillas. Covered with shredded mild cheddar, a little chopped fresh cilantro and a squeeze of fresh lime. Sprayed tortillas with Canola and grilled till the cheese was melted. Served with sour cream and salsa but honestly they didn't need anything ... other a cold Corona with lime. Perfect summer lunch!

Marinated about 5 hours - the result was succulent and tasty!  Cut chicken into 1 1/2 in pieces and made kebobs with green pepper and mushrooms.

Wonderful recipe! I took the advice of some other reviewers and added a bit of extra lime juice and crushed red pepper flakes. I didn't have any fresh limes, so used lemon zest with store lime juice, olive oil instead of vegetable oil and used large bone-in breasts with the skin. I marinated the chicken in a zip lock bag in the refrigerator for about 3 hours, flipping halfway through. Grilled at 350 deg. Chicken came out wonderfully moist, tender and flavorful. Definitely a keeper recipe!

Great recipe, but I added additional garlic (1 clove) and more lime juice (another 2 tbsp).  It didn't taste all that spicy, so I doubled the red pepper flakes 2nd time around.  It would do better if it marinated longer.  That's why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars; 1 hour in the fridge isn't long enough and the seasonings needed adjusting.  Perhaps that's just my taste.  Thanks for sharing!

Loved the spicy and tangy flavor!  It was a great change from the same old boring chicken.

Tasted terrific and was super easy.  I used this on boneless chicken breast pounded flat with a meat mallet, and cooked on a George Foreman grill 6 min.

This chicken is really really good. I used boneless breasts and let them marinate for about 2 hours. We didn't think this was spicy, but it was great tasting chicken.

I rarely give bad reviews but feel i need to here :(  After reviewing i decided to use more lime juice, ended up using the zest and juice of 2 limes plus some more (2 tbsp) bottled lime juice.  Used about 2 tsp hot pepper flakes, 3 cloves garlic AND marinated for 8 hours.  Spicy?  yes that part was fine but i had absolutely no taste of lime..maybe a slight hint but not at all what i was hoping for.  Very plain tasting.  I ended up dipping my chicken in my salad dressing just for some flavour.  6 chicken breasts aren't that cheap so i would definintely not make this again.

Not to take anything away from this marinade, because it was ok, but I have had a bit more favorable results when I added McCormick spices to this instead of just the regular red pepper flakes. When I made this the first time my taste buds just seemed to yearn for something more, so I tried adding the spices and my family and I really enjoyed it.

I pounded the chicke before letting it marinate. I let my chicken marinate for about three hours. Great taste. Next time I think I will let it marinate longer. Very tasty recipe!

Wonderful Chicken!!!!  I marinated it in a sealed foodsaver bag for 2 hours and it turned out great.  My family loves lemon/lime recipes and the spices that are added are just perfect!

For my family of 6, I grilled 6 chicken breasts. I read the earlier reviews and actually quadrupled the marinade and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. My family loved it! I will add this our regular rotation.

Good simple recipe.  I used boneless thighs, EVOO instead of vegetable oil, added another 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes, and marinated for 8 hours.

OH.MY.GOSH.  The BEST Grilled Chicken I have EVER made.  I added parsley and Lawrys seasoning as well.  I didnt have a lime so I missed out on the zest.  However, it was AMAZING.  I made it with caesar salads and it was raved by my husband.  Will definitely be making this again.

Chicken turned out great! Juicy and tasty. We did add extra cayenne pepper 'cuz we like a little kick and marinated a couple of hours. Flattened the chicken breasts a little so they'd cook more evenly, seared each side for five minutes and finished by cooking on med low. So easy!

I love this recipe.  It's so versatile.  I've cooked this in the oven in a cast iron dutch oven.  I've eaten this straight, but it also goes great on fettucini alfredo.    I also tweaked the recipe using cayene pepper instead of red pepper flakes and ate as chicken fajitas.    Just a great recipe.

This chicken was very tasty.  I made it exactly as written in the recipe and we loved it.  We had one breast leftover and my husband had it the next day with a salad for lunch.  He said it was really good then too.  We will definitely be making this recipe again.

Unfortunately, this didn't work too well for us.  I used bone in thighs & it marinated in the fridge for 2 days, but it really didn't get much flavor.  It was juicy, just not very flavorful.

Gold Star!  The only tweak to the recipe was once I had the chicken breasts marinating in the sauce I added a dash of red pepper flakes to each breast - just a little something extra.  I would also recommend trying "Chili-Lime Chicken Kabobs".

This is my husband's favorite!!!!  The marinade is easy to make and it doesn't need a long time to marinade (15 minutes min).  We eat this with mashed potatoes, rice, steamed broccoli.  I also make fajitas with it and it is excellent!!!

I just made this for dinner. I was told by my 6yr old "your the best chicken stick maker".

I took 4 skinless chicken breasts and cut into strips for skewers. followed the recipe minus the red pepper as I was out instead added some jerk seasoning to the mix. Before pouring on the chicken I added a rub of salt, pepper, garlic and season salt to the chicken then poured the mix over the chicken and let marinate about 5 hours. Before grilling i did add more jerk seasoning on about half the skewers my husband and I love the kick! Chicken was moist and juicy...Served w/ white rice and mixed veggies...will keep this one!!

This is our family's favorite chicken!!! i use olive oil instead of the vegetable oil. I did not use the lime zest. I switch off - sometimes i use lemon juice and sometimes I use lime juice. I chop up a whole lot of fresh basil (instead of the oregano) and sprinkle in some dashes of McCormick Montreal Steak Seasoning (no need to add extra salt - there is plenty of large grains of salt and pepper in this flavorful spice mix!) Usually i cut the chicken cutlets really thin, but this time i decided to put a wooden skewer through two thin strips of chicken. The result - DELICIOUS! My family loved it! I have never seen them eat so much chicken in my life! This is a true keeper!!!

I make a very similar recipe, but use chicken tenderloins, olive oil instead of vegetable, and add in 1/2 tsp of chili powder and 1 1/2 tsp cumin. Also up the red pepper to 1/2 tsp. Delicious!

This was very tasty.  I didn't have breasts on hand so I did thighs and legs.  I removed the skin from the thighs before marinating.  I baked the chicken  for about 1/2 hour at 350 and then grilled it to finish it off.  It was very moist and delicious.   I'll definitely use this recipe again.

By far and away one of our favorite marinades so far.  However, we ended up marinating the chicken for a day and a half instead of one hour due to a medical emergency in the family.  Family member ended up being just fine.  We came home grill the chicken and discovered it was one of the best meals we ever had.  Used 8 boneless skinless chicken thighs as that is what I had on hand at the time, increased the lime juice to use the whole lime, 4 cloves garlic and at least a 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes maybe more.  So very good... the family is already asking for more.

This is one of my family's favorite chicken recipes. The chicken is so tender. I really like the citrus flavor. To make it a little healthier I use olive oil. I also add more red pepper flakes for added kick.

I loved the marinade for this chicken!  I prefer a less sweet marinade and this was just the ticket.  I followed the recipe and then added a half cup of dry white wine.  It was superb!  I will make this again!

I substituted lemon for the lime ingredients, used ground red pepper vs flakes and used chicken thighs.  The meat was juicy and bursting with tangy  flavor.  I honestly didn't expect such a simple marinade to b so delicious.

As my first marinade, it was easy and yummy!  I like to make it using garlic powder and chili powder and I always add extra lime juice for a kick.  Its really great and my husband LOVES it and so do I!

Nice flavor!  Followed the changes made by other reviewers - I doubled the lime juice, garlic and red pepper.  I don't like oregano, so I used chopped fresh cilantro instead.  I was making kabobs, so I cut up the chicken breast into cubes and then places in marinade.  This is a new fave and one I'll be using often for summer grilling.

This was good, but I did not find any "spice" to it. I marinated for 1.5 days, then baked and finished with the broiler. It was very juicy, perhaps due to all of the oil, which I would decrease.  I will add more garlic, spices, etc., next time.

I cooked this on stove top instead as it was snowing and really cold out tonight. Very simple and pleasant flavours and uses basic pantry ingredients which was great. Not an outstanding recipe but good tasting nonetheless. By the way, it is not spicy at all...

FANTASTIC starter recipe for me.  I, too, will have to up the heat.  I used ground red pepper in the hopes to "hot it up" (per the reviews).  Will need more or maybe both ground and flakes!  Anyway, used this on chicken thighs and legs ~ grilled on hardwood charcoal.  YUM!  My picky 14 year old LOVED it!  Can't wait to try it again.  Used olive oil (personal preference) instead of veg oil and ground garlic instead of fresh.  I was in a hurry and didn't marinade it long, either.    Will use this one again, for sure!!

Great simple recipe. Made it for the first time lastnight my wife and I both enjoyed it. Not quite spicy enough for me, will have to add something to spice it up a bit. Very tasty though - had it with a mix spinach, romain lettuce mixed with veggies salad.

Absolutely delicious and easy to make!  This is our favorite chicken recipe!  Instead of vegetable oil, I always use olive oil, I just this the flavor is better.  And I never seem to have any limes on hand, so I just add some lime juice.  So flavorful and juicy!

This was a pretty good basic chicken recipe. It definitely needs more red pepper flakes- I doubled what the recipe called for and it still was not enough for us. But overall a good recipe. I think I'll try it again but add something else to give it more oomph.

The lime and red chili flakes gave the chicken nice tang and heat.  I was looking for something flavorful enough to serve on a bed of rice with some grilled veggies.  I don't think the flavor in this was enough but after tasting it I sliced it up and served it in tacos.

I scaled this to three chicken breasts and only used 1 tablespoon of oil, but 3 tablespoons of lime juice.  Also used garlic powder instead of minced garlic and 1/8 teaspoon cayenne instead of the other peppers.  I marinated it for 2 1/2 hours.  I grilled the chicken on my Cuisinart Griddler and it turned out so juicy and tender, but not very flavorful.  The amount of cayenne was perfect and it had a nice spice, and we could taste the oregano, but the lime barely at all even though I tripled the amount!  I will experiment more with this in the future and use more lime juice, more garlic, possibly add some ground cumin and let it marinate for at least 8 hours.

This was delicious, although I changed the recipe a bit.  I was not in the mood to measure anything, but I ended up putting maybe a couple TBSP of olive oil, the juice from one lime (tried to get juice from a second, but I couldn't get any out, lol!), a very small amount of lime zest (couldn't find my zester and had to improvise), 4 cloves of garlic (because we love garlic at my house), some oregano, crushed red pepper flakes and black pepper, and omitted the salt.  I marinated for about an hour-ish...then ended up cooking in a pan on the stove.  It turned out fantastic, with just the right amount of spice and lime flavoring.  :)

Yum!  My husband found and made this marinade and we really enjoyed the flavor.  He also added a touch of cayenne.  We ate the chicken breasts with veggies on the side but I think it could be incorporated into a fajita or other mexican dish.  Loved it!

This was a good recipe.  I've saved it to prepare again.  I used 1/2 breasts on the bone with the skin removed and was pleased with the flavor and juciness of the meat (obviously, take care not to over-grill or they'll become very dry).
If time permits, I'll definitely marinate longer - overnight if possible.

Perfectly spicy.  I used the marinade on chicken tenders and broiled them in the oven for about 12-15 mins, turning once.  Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

Fantastic!  I doubled the lime juice and garlic, and let it marinate for an extra half hour or so, and it got rave reviews.

Tasty but not 'spicy'.  I halved the marinade for 4 small breasts (1lb total) - next time I may keep the red pepper flakes at 1/4t for some extra zip.  Marinated longer than 1hr (I froze everything together & defrosting took 2 days).

Good but definitely spicy. I did the chicken on the Foreman grill, and it was moist and very flavorful. If I were to make it again, I wouldn't bother with the oil. It's kind of pointless, as it doesn't add anything to the flavor. Thanks, Jenn!

The best!! I used a stovetop grill and did not even have to oil it. Chicken was tender and so tasty. The lime taste really came through. Next time I would add a little more pepper as we like things spicier. Thank you for posting.

Very tasty.  I did not have fresh oregano, so I used 1/2 teaspoon of ground oregano.  It was still very yummy.

this definitely needs to marinate longer! i didn't have the time to let it marinate for hours, so i cut the meat into strips and had it fajita style. i served this with the "Watermelon Fire and Ice Salsa" and it was a complete success!

Very good marinade.  I double the amount of red pepper to make it a little spicier.  Also needs to marinate for several hours, at least 3.  Have added to my recipe box.  Thanks!

This was just okay but will probably not make it again.  I made it twice, the first time it was too bland.  The second time I added more spices and marinated over night but still not wowed by it.

I'm really not sure why my chicken came out so tremendously bland, while everyone else had such success.  I substituted bone-in chicken for boneless (that's what I prefer to grill), but allowed the chicken to marinate overnight to accomodate.  Probably will not attempt to make this again....

Made it for a family gathering of ten and it got rave reviews. Only change I made was to cut the large chicken breasts into thirds and the smaller ones in half.  Will definitely do chicken this way again!

Loved it. It was a change from Italian dressing n I loved the citrus flavor. The chicken was good n moist and the recipe was very easy. I didn't have any lime zest in the house but I don't think it was missed! I also added 4 garlic instead of 2. We love garlic. I made the Quick black bean salsa in this website to go along with it (with some additions to it). It was a perfect mix.

Very good recipe. I substituted the red pepper flakes for cayenne pepper because that is what I had available. Worked very well!

Good dinner! I think the marinade needs to be at least doubled for the amount of chicken suggested. Although I didn’t do it I think a longer marinade time would help also. I like it a little spicy (recipe as written seems bland to my taste) so maybe a another 1/4 tsp. Of red pepper flakes and a dash of cayenne pepper would help.

One of my new favorite chicken dishes!  I substituted cilantro for oregano (I used 2-3 Tbsp) and was very generous with the lime zest and garlic.  Next time I will increase the red pepper since It did not come across as "spicy" as advertised.   Great recipe.  I served baked Brussels sprouts and butternut squash  with the chicken.

The whole family loved it!  I did double the lime juice and garlic and added  about 1/2 tsp cayenne, as the family likes kick.  I used fresh Greek oregano, which was nice as well.  This will become a summertime staple ??

This was delicious! I did add a lot more red pepper flakes, lime juice, and lime zest which added a lot more flavor and spice. Just marinating it for a hour was just great! The only thing I recommend is adding a bigger amount of the ingredients than the recipe calls for. Add more of what your tastebuds deserve specifically.

I made this chicken recipe and the only thing I changed was that I only had 20 minutes to marinate. The dish was so amazing I can't wait to make it again! I would definitely add a little more heat, and I love the idea of one commenter who served it with salsa. I will try that next...how about a mango salsa topping? Thanks, this was quick and easy and oh so tasty!

this was pretty tasty but i basically doubled all the ingredients except for the oil, salt, and chicken.. i only used one tbsp of oil and upped the salt (used kosher) to 1.5 tsp.. i used this on four thighs and one drumstick that i scored.. i marinated for about four hours but i think a whole day is necessary to infuse the flavors.. ty for the recipe

I tried the recipe as written other than substituting dried oregano for fresh since that's all I had and doubling the garlic because we really like garlic. I followed the suggestion of another rater and cut the chicken breasts in half horizontally because they were big breasts and I wanted he marinade to really get into the meat. We found the recipe to be very mild tasting and it didn't give the chicken the flavor kick I was hoping. If I try this again, which I might since the flavor was good, just hard to taste much, I would double all of the spices instead of just the garlic.

Solid lime-flavored recipe, but certainly not spicy.  I quadrupled the crushed red pepper, and it was not spicy at all.  It tasted good but I likely wouldn't make it again.

The only thing I changed was leaving out the red pepper flakes (I don't like them). I marinated for about 2 hours. Everything else was exact and it was devoured. My husband who is not a big fan of chicken is still raving about it, almost a week later.

First post ever - thanks to Jen for this recipe!  It has become a summertime staple at our house.  Quick, easy and oh so good.  We use cayenne pepper instead of pepper flakes just because it's what we always have on hand, but otherwise follow as written.

I expected a lot more flavor from this.  I didn't get a whole lot of spice or kick at all.  I did barely taste the lime though.

Just made this chicken using the George Foreman grill and it turned out great! I marinaded it for 2.5 hours and it was perfect. After looking at other reviews, I decided to add more of the spices (red pepper, salt, garlic, oregano) directly on the chicken right before grilling. It took about 8 minutes and it was juicy with just enough flavor. Served with a side of veggies! Definitely saving this recipe.

Execellent.  I have altered if I do not have an ingredient (i.e. lemon zest verses lime zest or none at all).  Recipe is always good.

The chicken was moist and tender. An easy way to marinate chicken. Next time, I will add more lime juice and perhaps a 1/2 tsp. of red pepper since my family wanted chicken with a bit more heat.

Very good! I added a bit extra red pepper flakes, but I don't think it was necessary.  I actually used this to marinade the country pork ribs I had on hand, for about 6 hours.  Super flavor!!!

Great Recipe.  I increased the ingredients by almost double to accommodate more drumsticks.  I increased the pepper and the lime juice.  Put these and the marinade in a large ziplock baggie.  I only intended to marinate overnight.  However, plans changed and these ended up marinating in the fridge for an extra day.  I would turn the bag over regularly to insure even marinating.  
This recipe was part of a new venture in cooking with a Weber grill and charcoal.  I used Kingsford Mesquite briquettes and cooked the drumsticks slow.  My Weber internal temp was between about 240 and 300.  They came out delicious.  I will use this recipe again!

Followed recipe exactly with legs and thighs with the skin off the thighs.  I allowed the chicken to marinate for two hours before grilling.  Excellent flavors.  Would not change a single ingredient.

Easy. Next time I'll marinate longer than 1 hr though.  Very juicy.

Other than substituting olive oil for vegetable oil, the only significant change I made was to double the recipe for the marinade. It didn't seem to make enough for the chicken to really get immersed in it. I did use bone-in leg quarters instead of boneless chicken breasts, and this may have been part of the problem. I also marinated overnight as I knew I would have my hands full the next day with other dishes. But, the end result was a delicious chicken that grilled up to perfection and had my guests raving! That's good enough for me!

I found this delicious, quick and easy to get together.  I didn't find the lemon too much.  It all just blended together nicely.  I left it to marinate for about 3/4 hours.  I intended to leave it longer, but ate it for lunch instead of dinner.
