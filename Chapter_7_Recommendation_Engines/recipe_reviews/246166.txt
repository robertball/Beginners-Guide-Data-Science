It was very tasty and really easy to make.  Next time, I will add more veggies for more color and maybe more depth in flavor (probably carrots and/or butternut squash), but it is just right as  it is.

I did add Trader Joeâ€™s 21 seasoning salute. But I add that to everything:)

I added a lot of my own spices to make this a very tasty dish.  Chicken is also a nice addition
