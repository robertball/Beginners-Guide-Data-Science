We felt as written this recipe lacked flavor but it led to great inspiration.To give it a Thai flare we added 3/4 c unsalted peanuts,2 tsp fresh ginger,2 tsp lime juice,2 T low salt soy sauce,1/2 c fresh cilanto chopped & 1 tsp chili-garlic sauce (found in the asian food section).With the additions it has become one of my husbands favorite meals.

Exceptional!  And so very easy to make too!  We didn't have slaw mix, so we shredded white and red cabbage, carrot & red onion instead.  We also had a flavored hummus which made it even better I think.  My husband who's not big into veggie 'sandwiches' raved and raved!  This is definitely a keeper!

This was great!  I worried that it would end up being dry but it wasn't.  I made my own hummus so that probably made a difference and I would recommend taking the time to do it for this recipe.  This is a good, easy, no cooking necessary, summer sandwich!

Completely delicious!  These were easy and quick to make, and they're a great lunch at work.  Very healthy, too.  I made these exactly according to the recipe (except I sub grape tomatoes for tomato slices, for convenience at work), and the result was delicious.

Loved it!  Just make sure you mix those jalapeno bits evenly throughout, because if you get a big crunch of those babies, they'll set you on fire.

Enjoyed this as lunch today. The secret is to make your own hummus, otherwise I think it would only be mediocre.
