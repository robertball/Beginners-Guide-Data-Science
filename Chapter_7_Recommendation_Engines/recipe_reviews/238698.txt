EXCELLENT!!  When they first came out of the oven I thought they looked dry and flat -- they weren't!  Brought them to the office and they were gone in minutes!!  Did not alter the recipe in any way.

My inspiration today for making these brownies came from the fact that I had a VERY ripe banana on  hand, as well as a box of  Ghiradelli Chocolate Supreme Brownie mix which was past the "best by..." date (oops!).  The banana not only yielded a super moist brownie but added a great subtle banana flavor, as well.  Very easy, very tasty, and I would make this recipe again.

Oh man, this is sooo good! I just made these and the only difference is that I used pecans because that is what I already had on hand. I'm not even a big fan of brownie but these are really tasty! I'll be making them this way from now on! :D

I made this according to the instructions. Unfortunately I really didn’t care for them.  I think they’re probably only as good as the brownie mix and I had a cheap one.

Followed exactly except did not fold walnuts in. I sprinkled on top on half the pan because not all of my family likes nuts in their brownies. That being said, this tasted delicious. I baked for 23 min as written. I think next time I’ll bake it less, because they were a tad bit drier than my liking. These lean toward a cake like texture than fudgey ??.

These turned out great!  Moist, fluffy, and delicious.  Next time, I may even add a second banana.  I subbed pecans, because that's what I had on hand, and they worked just fine instead of walnuts.
