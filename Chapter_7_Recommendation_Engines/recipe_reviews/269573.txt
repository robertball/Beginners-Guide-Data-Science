This is a great weekday breakfast. I make several at a time and keep them in the refrigerator for a quick and satisfying breakfast. I followed the recipe exactly, and they turned out great. The only modification was that I added 1/4 cup of raisins to each jar. This is a game changer. The raisins rehydrate and become plump and juicy, with a nice crispness to them, like when you bite into a fresh grape. Definitely one of my favorite new items to make.

It tasted just fine but the texture of the Chia seeds are different.

I found the quantity of milk was a little less than needed. Still stays chewy. Overall I liked the recipe but was a bit disappointed with the texture. It was a little better with a little more milk.

I make with any fruit I have on hand.  We like to heat the mixture from the jar to a bowl in the microwave for breakfast.  It is very nourishing and good.
