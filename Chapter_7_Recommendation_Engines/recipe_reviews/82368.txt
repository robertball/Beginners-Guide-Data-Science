Goodness, y'all deleted my review! *scratching my head & wondering why...while lengthy at times, I would never say anything offensive*  Anyway, as I said ;o) these are fabulous! I like to put a sprig of herbs in mine (both rosemary & thyme are really good), I poke them w/ a sharp object (maybe they objected to my wording for "poke w/ a sharp object" LOL) a corncob skewer works good & that allows the tomatoes to absorb more of the vodka. I do drain mine though & save the vodka to use in bloody mary drinks. Don't soak these for longer than overnight or they get too strong & soggy. I pour a bed of kosher salt on a platter & use it as a bed for the tomatoes. This looks great & keeps them from rolling about. Be sure & label them if you take them to a mix w/ children. I once took them to a family function & my daughter told me how much my grandson liked them. Ooops!

If you want a great alternative to a boring veggie platter, make this dish.  I tripled the recipe to take to a large party.  It was fabulous.  I used grape tomatoes instead of cherry and everyone wants the recipe.  I lined a chip and dip tray with slices of lime and poured in the tomatoes.  The stuck celery stalks in a various spots.  After pouring the dipping sauce into the center holder it was ready.  Definitely a hit, even with people that don't normally like tomatoes.

These are always a hit! I prick them and soak them only a couple of hours. I add celery salt, old bay, horseradish, and pepper and garnish with celery stalks.

What's not to love!  These are super easy to make and a hit every time I serve them.  I don't use pepper vodka and find they are zippy enough with the Tabasco.  Great for parties as a standout next to the garden variety veggie platters.

I've made this for two parties and most people at both liked it.  It is a great contribution because it is fast, easy, and unique.  It does have a strong flavor, so you could choose to replace some pepper vodka with regular vodka and add less hot sauce.  I second what another reviewer said about piercing the tomatoes before marinading them so they can really absorb the flavor.

I was looking forward to these so much and was terribly dissapointed.  I followed the recipe exactly and they just taste terrible.  I love Bloody Mary.  Love tomatoes, celery salt, everyting.  But it just didn't work.  Great concept though.

We did not care for this recipe. The skins on the tomato become VERY bitter.  They we not edible because they tasted so bad.

I made this for a large party and it was quite the conversation piece!  I didn't allow very much time for the tomatoes to marinate, so I pricked them a few times with a toothpick, which seemed to work just fine.

I love these and my husband does not, and we both like Bloody Maryâ€™s.  We still make them for summer parties and they are a big hit.  Even for the few guests who do not like them, they are still fun to try.  They are great to leave out on a bar instead of pretzels.  Also wanted to say ditto to the warning if kids are around.

These delicious and very easy to make. I followed a couple of the reviews: to prick to tomatoes and I didn't use pepper vodka. They went over really big at a picnic I attended. I was told to bring them back next year.

I LOVE this and have made it many times. The only thing I change is I take a toothpick and poke a few holes into the tomatoes before marinating so it soaks up the vodka! Other than that, they are perfect as is! Thanks for such a great idea!!!!

I don't like Bloody Marys, but I had a ton of cherry tomatoes growing in the garden and needed to do SOMETHING with them. I made this for a 4th of July party, and they were a hit! They all went! I made this for a housewarming party a month later too, and again, people liked them. Great way to use up those cherry tomatoes for a party!

The bites were yummy at first, but I expected them to be "preserved" for a while because of the intense brine.  2 weeks later they were soggy and had an "off" flavor.
