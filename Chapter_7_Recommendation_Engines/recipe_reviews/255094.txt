These were amazing! I made them mainly for my kids but they turned out to be a lifesaver for me when I'm in a rush out the door to get to my college classes. I love that they incorporate two ingredients I love; chia seeds and quinoa. I made 2 ever so slight adjustments: I only had creamy peanut butter, and I didn't have flax meal so I substituted 1 mashed banana and it worked like a charm. Bonus: all 5 kids love them too! Thank you, this one's a keeper.

They are a very tasty snack. My daughter and husband loved them too. I ran out of chocolate chips so I mixed cocoa powder with melted coconut oil and spread it on top.
