I made these for my New Years party and they were a big hit. I didn't think they were too sweet. I'd like to try the recipe again but wrapping them in bacon. No need to add salt; the recipe doesn't call for any so I didn't add any - I was a little worried but the prosciutto was plenty. Make sure to get pitted dates; it's a real pain to pit them yourself :) All in all it's a time-consuming recipe, but well-worth it if you want to wow your guests.

I have made this for years. However, I never used anything but the goat cheese. I love what the basil and honey add to the taste. So easy and very good.

When I went to the store I wasn't able to find dates, so I subbed in dried plums. I also did a little extra honey- and I used what I had in the cupboard which was wildflower honey. For the bacon, I followed other people's comments and used thick cut hickory smoked bacon. Also, I put tin foil on the cookie sheet before baking them so I didn't have to clean the mess. I then baked them at 400Â° for 15 minutes, flipping once half way through. Then broiling at the end to crisp them. While they were greasy (which was inevitable due to the use of bacon and cheese), and I had to push some of the cheese back in, they were to die for delicious. They were all eaten the minute I put them out. I will definitely make them again! I suggest putting them on a paper towel first before serving them to let the grease soak off.

I really liked these! My family thought they were too sweet . . . but I have a sweet tooth, so maybe that's why I enjoyed them. Good thing I only made half a recipe, because it looks like I'm going to be the only one eating them, which is okay with me.
