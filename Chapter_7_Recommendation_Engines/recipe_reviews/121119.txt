Good, but I think it need more spice. I added only a pinch of salt because I did not want my dish too salty. I didn't have Rotel (which is what diced tomatoes and green chilies is) so I used one can of fire-roasted diced tomatoes and one can of green chilies. I did drain off a little of the juice from the tomatoes, though, so it wouldn't be too runny. I think this would make a great chunky salsa, if I added yellow onion, gresh garlic and more cilantro and cumin to the tomatoes and chilies, ran it through the blender, then fold in one can each of the corn and the black beans.

Pretty good but not spicy enough.  I added some cayenne pepper and garlic to it.

This recipe is a huge hit! I'm always asked to make it for get-togethers, and often asked for the recipe. Although I am a big fan of olive oil, in this case I think using vegetable oil works out better.

I love this salad and could eat it every day of the week.  I love the spice, the cilantro and the cold, crunchy corn and beans.  The only substitution I make is using adobo powder instead of the salt (I learned it from a friend).  This is an excellent recipe-Thank you!

nothing better than ok...and it makes more like 12-16 servings, which means it's an awful lot of "just ok" salad to have around...
update: i ended up throwing away the leftovers. (something i almost never do!) unlike most bean and corn salads, which only get better over time, this salad became inedible after sitting overnight. the onion flavor became overly pronounced, to the point that green onion was the only distinctive taste. i'm taking away a star.

Nice change from usual potato, macaroni, or pasta salad! I also add diced celery as other reviewer stated. And is definately better when sits overnight. Great recipe for potluck!

I really liked this salad and so did my husband (who rarely likes anything that doesn't have meat in it- unless its drowning in cheese). I added a little more salt and some chili powder and it turned out great. Definately needs to sit for at least 2 hours so that the flavors can mingle together. Definately a great dish for a potluck!

I make this salad on a regular basis, especially in the winter when other salad fixings are out of season.  I often add celery to add extra crunch.

This is a quick and easy side dish for summer grilling.  We like things extra spicy at our house, so we added a little scotch bonnet hot sauce.  Great for pic-nics and pot lucks too as the salad gets better the longer it sits.

This recipe is exactly what I was looking for.  Had this at a friends house and loved it.  Very easy to make, and best of all, it's versatile.  You can eat it chilled in the summer or drain the tomato and saute for a warm side dish in colder months. Thanks for posting this recipe.

I made this salad for a family get together. Everyone raved about it and I was asked to send the recipe to them. Delicious.

I brought this salad to work and everyone wanted the recipe!  I like it with chips as a salsa, too!
