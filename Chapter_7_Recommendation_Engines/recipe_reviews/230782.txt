There is an error my recipe.  It does not take 5 minutes for the rest of the popcorn to pop once it is added to the pot.  It only takes a minute or so.  5 minutes would severely burn the popcorn.  Also make sure you do not stop shaking the pot back and forth once the rest of the popcorn is added.  Even stopping for 5 seconds is enough to burn the popcorn on the bottom.

I make this without the oil in the microwave. About 3 tablespoons plain popcorn for about 1 1/2 minute makes a medium bowl. I just use the cheap paper sandwich bags you can get at the dollar store. I just kind of drizzle honey over it, add the cinnamon, shake it up and it is delicious and nutritious

Great for a healthy snack.  But if you are expecting Caramel Corn, this is not it.

OMGOSH - This is Soooooo Goooood !!!  I usually just use Avacado Oil from Trader Joes but I was out so I looked for a recipe using Coconut Oil and by chance found this one - I have never made a Sweet Popped Corn - It was AMAZING - My daughter warmed up some vegan butter and there was the salt !!!   I will definitely make it again...

Simple and delicious. Thanks for the great idea. I find that popcorn turns out more tender if you put the kernels in along with the oil and heat them together.

This is amazing. Quick, easy and delicious, it reminds me of kettle corn but better! I warmed my honey so that it coated better. I definitely ended up with far too much popcorn. Will cut the portions next time.

Most delicious popcorn ever!  This tastes like kettle corn but better.  It is super fast and easy, too.  We go a little heavy on the cinnamon - thank you for a wonderful recipe!

We halved it and it fit great in the pan we usually use for popcorn. The kids loved it!
