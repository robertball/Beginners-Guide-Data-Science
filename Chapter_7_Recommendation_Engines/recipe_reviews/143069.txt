I can't get enough of this soup!  I tweaked it by leaving out the bacon and using kale instead of spinach (the famous restaurant uses kale).  I also added 1 teaspoon of fennel as I think that it is crucial to the flavor of the soup.  My Italian sausage was hot enough without the added red pepper, also.  Still, I think this recipe is pretty forgiving and you can add or subtract to your taste.  This was just what I was looking for to start me on my way to my new favorite soup.  I also loved how quickly everything cooked.

This is a great soup.  Use Kale in place of the spinach and voila, you have the original recipe!  HELPFUL HINTS:  To avoid orange soup, rinse your sausage in very HOT water; use 5 potatoes sliced thick and 2 potatoes sliced thin.  The variation in the potato size allows the thinly sliced potatoes to cook down and thicken the broth; a mix of hot and mild sausage gives the soup more "zip", and last, use low sodium chicken broth.   Serve with hot crusty bread for a great meal.

This is my favorite soup! Instead of heavy cream I use milk with about 3 tbsp cornstarch. And instead of spinach, I use kale. This soup freezes great, too! Wonderful!

This is very similar to a recipe that I make.  I use hot sausage instead of mild, no hot pepper flakes, only 2-4 russett potatoes (depending on the size)sliced thin and they hold their shape and do not come out mushy and kale.  You can substitute cauliflower for the potatoes for a lower carb diet and it is just as delicious.  Definately just crumble the bacon instead of cutting into pieces.  This is a crowd pleaser and my family loves it when I make this recipe!

Just made a few little changes to this recipe. I used turkey sausage, 7 potatoes, and ready-to-use bacon crumbles, better than bouillon instead of cans of broth, and milk instead of heavy cream. It was absolutely fantastic, better, I dare say, than the soup from the chain.

Excellent!! I've tried other recipes that were supposed to be "exactly like" the restaurant version... but none have ever come out the way I expected - until now.  However, I did use kale, not spinach, and I added fennel seed as someone else suggested (thank you). I chopped the fennel seed (about 1.5 tsp) and added it in with the chicken broth (I forgot to add it while cooking the sausage).  I added two big handfuls of chopped kale after adding the cream. Also, I used one 48oz can of chicken broth, and one 14oz can of chicken broth with roasted garlic (I still used the garlic called for in the recipe - and probably a little extra since we like garlic).  If I would change anything next time, I would use less sausage (I used 18oz).  I would only use 10-12oz next time (at the most).  Also, I used 3 very large potatoes (not the huge bakers, but very large), but I don't think it was enough. We like a lot of potatoes.  Also, I wouldn't slice them too thin. Chop them large enough to get a little beat up while stirring/cooking but still remain chunky. I sliced mine about 1/2" thick, then cut the slices in half, but I wish I had just used bigger chunks instead of slices.  They didn't take 20 minutes to cook this way so watch your potatoes closely, they may be mushy if you let them cook for the full 20 minutes. (Mine were good at 15 min). One last note - I don't think you really need a full cup of cream. You could survive with 3/4 c. & not miss the fat or any of the taste.

Great recipe! I had to tweak it a little, but that's ok, I always tweak whatever recipe I look at... a full pound of sausage was a bit much for me so I used a half a pound, and make sure you blot all the grease from the sausage or it will float to the top. Instead of spinach I used kale, it's a heartier green and doesn't wilt in the soup, the texture stays firm for a long time. Delicious!!

YUM! This was the perfect dinner for a cold night! It does taste a lot like the restaurant's soup! I agree with the suggestions of using fewer potatoes.  I used 4 (3 small and 1 bigger) and there was plenty of potato! It soaked up quite a bit of the broth, so the soup was pretty thick. Also, I used kale instead of spinach. Very good! My husband loved it! I'll definitely make it again!

I can't get enough of this soup!!! I use kale instead of spinach (I like it better because it is crunchier). I always peel my potatoes (nobody will ever make me eat potatoes' skin!!). The second time I cooked the bacon in the microwave because I thought there was too much fat the first time. This recipe is just TOO good. Thanks

Definitely oh-so-good. I followed the recipe exact, only adding a tsp. of crushed fennel as another reviewer recommended. My family was not a fan but I am for sure. I'm really glad I didn't double it because it makes quite a bit for one person. Make sure you invite your besties over to share if you make this. Quite simple and not intimidating like I originally thought it would be. NOTE: If you have kids, you might want to cut back on the red pepper flakes. It's got a bit of a kick, which could be a bit much for little mouths. Also, my potatoes were done at 12 minutes.

This soup was really delicious. It tastes just like the restaurant. And it took me less than an hour to make. My suggestions are if you use 6 potatos make sure they are the smaller ones. And don't bother cutting the bacon into slices, just cook it and then crumble it (quicker). Very delicious indeed.

There is a reason this is the highest rated and most reviewed Zuppa Toscana recipe on the site...not only does the list of ingredients capture the essence of what you need to make this simple but great soup, but the sum total of all the raters' comments and suggestions help to guide one to creating their own masterpiece.  As I always do, I first read the original recipe and creator's directions carefully to determine if the dish is something that generally suits my taste and style of cooking.  Then, I carefully read a great many of the reviews of the recipe in attempt to determine if others have indeed found ways to improve the dish.  I would say that 50% of the time or more I find great value in the trial and error suggestions reviewers have so graciously offered to assist all of us in our ever-evolving quest to make things a little better.  At any rate, this dish is such a great example of all those attributes.  For me personally, I benefitted greatly from the many wonderful and thoughtful suggestions and modifications other reviewers had made.  The modifications I made were as follows:  1) I used 3 large red russet potatoes and the florets from one whole head of cauliflower, 2) I used thick-cut bacon which I fried, then set aside to drain and crumbled versus leaving in 1/2 inch strips 3) I used about 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes versus 1 1/4, 3) I used half-and-half versus heavy cream, 4) lastly, and most importantly, I used kale instead of spinach.  Outstanding Zuppa!

JUST LIKE THE RESTURANT!!!
As suggested in other reviews, I used Kale instead of the spinach.
I also had to use Johnsonville Italian sausage, and I will definitly use another brand next time.  I misread the recipe and diddnt know that I was supposed to have gotten ground sausage, so I had to crumble by hand.  
I will also try to make a lighter version since this one has so much fat in it.  
Overall, this recipe was awesome!

I made this soup last night. I used Johnsonville Sweet Basil Italian sausage (which I LOVE) and Campbells chicken broth. It turned out EXTREMELY salty. I can handle a lot of salt in my food, and this was too salty, even for me. I added extra cream, just to try and tone down some of the saltiness. Maybe it might be better with reduced sodium ingredients, but I will not be making this again. Thanks anyways!

My favorite soup by far! Try the recipe as is first!  Wonderful to double or quadruple recipe for freezing. To freeze: After step 2, add the sausage & red pepper back in with bacon, onion & garlic. Mix & let cool, put meat mixture into freezer bag. Thaw when ready to use. Use chicken soup base to make broth & heat like step 3 only waiting to put the meat mixture back in after the potatoes have cooked. Reduce heat & continue with heavy cream & spinach. Enjoy!! Thank-You souporsweets!!!

Amazing! Flavorful, with a bit of spice. Perfect for cooler nights... or heck, just whenever. I used kale instead of the spinach, and it was heavenly. I'll definitely make this again and again. :)

Incredibly delicious!  I used sweet italian sausage, a bit less of the red pepper flakes, a mix of small potatoes and light cream/regular milk. I added the sausage earlier than called for too.  I think my bacon was salty, as I could taste that, so next time I'll buy lower sodium bacon, or may leave it out altogether.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Suggestions -  ** If you plan to freeze, hold off on the cream, instead add after thawing.   ** Blot the sausage really well, otherwise soup will be greasy.  You do want to saute the onion in the bacon drippings as indicated though. ** Kale would give a snappier and more peppery flavor than spinach.   ** As a better contrast between savory and spicy, use spicy sausage and omit pepper flakes.

This soup is wonderful!  During the unfortunate times that I am dragged kicking and screaming to the odious faux Italian chain to which so many of the reviews here refer, this is the ONLY thing that I will eat.  It's actually quite tasty.  The best part about making this soup at home is serving it with crusty bread rather than the oil & salt saturated dough they call breadsticks.  I went ahead and used the spinach the first time, but will use kale in the future.  I drained and rinsed the sausage, used red new potatoes, and substituted fat free half & half for the heavy cream.  Great rainy day meal, especially with some red wine.

EXCELLENT!!!  I have found another soup to add to my rotation - and that is a hard spot to fill!  The only things I did different was I used chicken stock in place of broth (more flavor), only 2 large potatoes, cubed (left skin on), 2 cups of kale (washed, dried & chopped) in place of the spinach and added slightly more bacon - more like half a pound (7-8 slices).  I had link mild italian sausage so I just had to slice off the casing and crumble myself.  not a big deal. I also probably added slightly more red pepper to the soup - plus salt and ground pepper to taste at the end - so yummy. When I added the cream and kale at the end, I let it simmer for around 4 minutes.  This was so perfect, easy, hubby raved, and i look forward to making it again!

Used the crockpot for this one. Only had hot Italian sausage, but that worked out perfect. Omitted the cream and sprinkled 2 cups frozen spinich (did not have fresh on hand) on top while cooking. Cooked on high for 4 hours. This was so delicious and the sausage had flavor, but was not too hot to eat.

Great soup!  I used kale instead of spinach and didn't add the red pepper flakes as my little ones are not telerant of spicy things, but a family pleaser nonetheless.

Definitely a five star recipe! I used hot sausage and no red pepper flakes, half and half instead of the heavy cream and kale instead of the spinach. I LOVE this soup! Will be making many, many times.

WOW!  This is quite possibly the best tasting soup I've ever made.  This may even be the best tasting soup I've ever had, period.  Delicious, absolutely delicious.  Tasted just like the soup at "the restaurant chain".  I followed this to a tee except I did as the others suggested and used kale instead of spinach.  "The restaurant chain" also uses kale, so I thought it was a much needed change.  Other than that, I followed the recipe and it turned out perfectly.  I used red potatoes, left the skins on and cut the slices in half.  Next time I may cut down on the red pepper flakes (maybe 1 tsp. instead of 1 1/4) because it was a bit too spicy for the kids (though I thought it was perfect).  Perfect with a little fresh grated Parmesan on top and some warm, crusty bread.  Delicious and filling, definitely a meal!  Thank yo so much for this recipe!

Tuesday Nite.....Kroger's was out of Kale, had just used my supply for sauteed side dish on Sunday.  No biggie.  Used spinach.  This is similar to another soup I make that has pinto beans in it.  I cooked according to recipe....Hubby and son loved it.  It's all gone! Now, here is for the sticker shock for all you Zuppa Toscana purists.  I am, as you know, a true Southern choc-o-la-te lady (Dora the Explorer taught me how to say it like that!!!)So, don't be mad....but I ate mine with.....wait for it......cornbread!!!! I know I know.  It's an Italian soup!  But, that broth just begged me for a chunk of cornbread.  My son doesn't eat it so he had good ole fashioned (frozen brand) garlic sticks. Oh my, it was truly delicious though.  Comfort food for my soul!

this soup is AMAZING. follow the recipe to a T, and you will have a very delicious soup. Whenever I make this soup, I always intend to save some, to freeze and pull out on those nights when you don't feel like cooking ... but there is NEVER ANY LEFT, even if I double the recipe. I have made this soup as written many times, but I usually add more bacon (we love bacon).. I use half of a 'regular package' of bacon, cut into chunks. I brown my sausage in the bacon drippings, and then blot the sausage and bacon with paper towel (try to get as much of the grease off as possible so it dosn't linger in the soup). I sautee the onion, garlic and potatoes before adding them to the pot. I try to use homemade chicken broth if I have some, and I usually add 'bunches' of thyme to the broth, stems and all. the thyme leaves cook off the stems, and before the soup is done I pull the stems out. If I use spicy sausage, I leave the crushed red pepper out.. and if I use mild italian I sometimes add fresh diced red pepper instead of the red pep flakes. I use kale, and whipping cream. a family favorite over here  :)))

This is a great recipe, and very easy! I actually cook the onions and garlic a little first to soften, add the sausage (without casings) and cook, then drain the grease. Then I add everything else to the same big pot, (except bacon which I don't really care for.) I def. recommend kale over spinach, and you can use skim milk instead of cream, plus a little corn or potato starch or instant potato flakes to thicken it and it's just as good and a bit better for you! I have worked at that famous Italian restaurant for a long time... and this recipe is exactly what you need to make this soup at home. It's even better if you let it sit overnight. Sprinkle some parmesan or romano cheese on top and it's perfection!

We love this soup.  I make it frequently and this recipe is a good approximation of the famous restaurant's offering.  I first used kale instead of the spinach called for in this recipe but once, in a pinch, I just tossed in diced frozen broccoli florets because I always have them on hand.  I've got to say we like it just as well with the broccoli - maybe even better.

Great on the first night, but even better the next couple of days! Had no potatoes on hand and subbed a frozen 32-oz. bag of Southern-style hash brown potatoes (the small cubed style) in a pinch. They worked out great! No time spent peeling/cutting the potatoes. Thanks!

As it is written, very bland. When I reheated it, I added some flour for thickening and it was better.

Yum... I love having this soup at one of our favorite restaurants "The Olive Garden"  I used Kale instead of spinach and Hot Italian Sausages which I baked in the oven, diced and rinsed well to remove all the grease, otherwise it turns your cream orange.   So good! :)

I have been making this soup for a couple of years, it's one of my favorites!  The changes I make are using half and half instead of heavy cream, pancetta instead of bacon and cubed potatoes instead of thinly sliced. Also, instead of adding the spinach or kale (both are good) directly to the soup, I rough chop it and place it in the bottom of the soup bowls and ladle hot soup over it.  With just two of us, we eat this for several meals and the fresh greens each day make it taste just made.

Very good!  My husband loves this soup!  I always use kale instead of spinach (tried it with spinach once and we thought it was slimey).  The heavy cream is important (tried it with milk one time when I didn't have cream and it wasn't nearly as good).  Great soup for any season!

Made this as is except with about a half pound of quartered, sliced smoked sausage (needed to use up), 2 slices of bacon, 4 potatoes and a whole bunch of beautiful organic kale. Delicious!  I bet it would be even better with Italian sausage. Yum!

This was soo good.  I followed the recipe to a "T" and it turned out perfectly except that I did find it to be a tad too spicy.  1 1/4 tsp RP flake seemed a bit much but i thought it would be fine but yah, just a bit too spicy.  But we like spice so all was well.  I think 1/2 tsp RP flake would be more than plenty the next time around.

I just finished up my last bowl of this soup, and it was so good! I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but pretty much most of it. I accidentally bought sweet turkey sausage, and it still tasted really good (I did add the pepper flakes to make it spicier). I also didn't have 5 cans of chicken broth, but I had enough for 48 oz and it was a perfect amount for me. I added 1 teaspoon of fennel and 1/4 bunch kale per other reviewers suggestions-made this soup amazing. I had jumbo russet potatoes, so I only added 2 (washed and peeled) and that was PLENTY...so check the size of your potatoes beforehand. My husband loved this, he was impressed :) Thank you!

Okay, I'm an easy rater when it comes to soup (I love 'em!), but having loved this soup when I go to a certain large italian chain, I gave this a try.  I stuck to the directions closely, and this turned out better than the restaurant one in my book!  I would say stick with it as written, and you will enjoy!

This soup has good flavor.  The only thing I will do differently next time is slice the potatoes thicker.  I sliced them thin, and they virtually melted into the soup.  I do like to simmer my soup a bit longer.  Also it was pretty salty so I'd use low-sodium chicken broth.

I was SO excited to make this soup because I love the Olive Garden version. This was nothing like it. I followed the directions exactly-only subbing kale for spinach and adding more potatoes (8) and sausage (1.5lbs) because we like a chunky soup and I read reviews that this was thin. I sliced 2 of the potatoes thinner so they could cook down to thicken the soup and the rest I sliced medium thickness so they wouldn't cook away.  When the soup was ready I tasted it and it was SO thin and bland. It tasted like red pepper flake-flavored, watery chicken broth. I took about 2 ladle fulls of the soup out (sausage, taters and all)and blended a quick roux with some cornstarch and an extra large baked potato. It was still SO thin and tasteless--the chicken broth flavor was really overwhelming.   Finally to salvage dinner (and a lot of leftovers) I added about 2 cups of potato flakes. I added them slowly and whisked to avoid clumping. This thickened the soup up beautifully and really cut the chicken broth taste. I bet after cooling overnight, the leftovers will soak up a lot of the broth so I suggest starting with just one cup of potato flakes so the flavor and thickness doesn't overwhelm and add more the next day if needed.   I gave this a 2 stars because as directed it was pretty much unedible. Adding the potato flakes made it 3.5 (had a bit more "mashed potato flavor" than OG's soup) but I bet with some playing around with the potato flakes this could be a 4-5 star recipe.

Delish!  Although there is always the problem of reheated potatoes in soups disappearing but it just makes the soup a touch thicker and a bit less chunky.  The better the sausage you buy the better this soup!

FABULOUS.  I decided to make it ahead so we could grab it and go before soccer practice, so I made everything and did not add the spinach.  To serve, I placed the torn, fresh spinach in our soup bowls and ladled the hot soup over it.  Stir, and it cooks the spinach just enough to where it still retains its bite.  Wonderful, delicious, my family devoured it and it warmed us up after getting chilled outside.  Will make again and again!

I use whatever greens my garden has. AND fat free 1/2 & 1/2. I also keep pre cooked bacon on hand..BLTs, anytime! I crush the garlic, & use less, I sliver the onion, I like texture. Had some ham slices once and used that rather than the bacon. And yes I use turkey sausage, hot & leave out the red pepper flakes. All my foods are on a diet. A dab of Brummel & Brown on top of the soup with ground pepper...wow!

This soup was easy to make and really tasty.  My husband and daughter both liked it.  However, don't do what I did - accidentally double the cayenne pepper.  Yikes, two days later it was toned down, plus I had to add lemon juiceNext time....perfect!

Very delicious! I didn't add as many potatoes (I only added 2 big ones) and would probably cook the bacon in smaller pieces and separately to cut down a little on the fat. Otherwise, it is very yummy and perfect!

I made this after hearing my girlfriend rave about the version served at the mysterious Italian chain that no one is willing to actually name for some reason. I made the recipe as directed other than subbing the cream with milk (something other reviewers said made no difference). The bacon, although originally very crispy, was soggy and overall the soup disappointed both of us. I guess my advice is don’t make this unless you are absolutely smitten with the one from The Olive… I mean chain Italian restaurant.

Soup was delicious and easy to make. Followed the recipe exactly and it really hit the spot on a damp and rainy night. Next time gonna make it with kale as other reviewers stated and see which I like better.

Our whole family loves this soup.  Use kale instead of spinach.  We are a little easier on the pepper flakes for our kids.  Thanks

I don't know why I haven't rated this before.  I've made it many times and I love it!  I was really craving this tonight and it really hit the spot.  I didn't have any heavy cream however but I did have about 2-3 ounces of low fat cream cheese which I added instead.  Delish!    I also added a couple pinches of extra fennel seed because I love that flavor.

I have never had this soup at OG but it is very good.  My only gripe is that the end result was a little greasy/oily.  This is most likely from the italian sausage (I used hot) so I think next time I would use turkey sausage or maybe even links.  I used microwave bacon too or else it probably would have been really greasy.  Either way, it still tastes very good and I have a lot of it so I will be eating it for a while.

Very good. Doubled the recipe since last time I made it it was gone instantly! Used a very big bunch of Kale instead of Spinach. Added it at the same time as the potatoes. I also used Zesty Sausage. Added a nice spicy taste to it without having to put in red pepper flakes.

Really, really good. I used a few slices of leftover bacon crumbled, shallots instead of onion (personal preference) and thickened some whole milk with cornstarch in place of the cream. Certainly doesn't make it healthy, but it was still rich and creamy. It will be great for a cold winter night!

Perfect for a chilly winter evening!  To lighten the load, I used 2 c. half half, 2 c broth, and the remaining replaced with water.  Also used soy sausage and added extra spinach.  Awesome.

Oh. My. Gossssshhhhh!!!!! This was soooooo good!!! Both my hubs and I REALLY enjoyed this! This is a SPOT in copycat of the "real deal." :) Although pretty much perfect as is, I made a few changes (I know, I know...). To help eliminate some of the greasiness others have warned about, I browned (HOT) sausage links in a bit of garlic infused EVOO, gently blotted them with paper towels after they had cooled and then roughly chopped them into bite-sized pieces. Because of this change, I omitted the pepper flakes altogether. I ended up using four good sized Russett potatoes and am glad I did. Six would have been FAR too many! Since the recipe submitter doesn't specify the size of potato to use, it's imperative to trust your gut on this one.... Six SMALL potatoes might be fine, but cut back if they are any larger than that. My final change was to substitute chopped kale for spinach (to more closely mimic the chain's soup). With these changes, this was one darn good soup! Garlic breadsticks rounded out our delicious meal. It will be a VERY long time before I make another visit to the "Garden" to satisfy my soup craving haha! Thanks SO much for sharing your secret recipe with the AR community, souporsweets! :-)

This recipe is as close to the Olive Garden recipe you will find. The only change I made was, I did use kale vs spinach, because that is what the Olive Garden uses to make theirs. It is a keeper for sure and a must try if you are looking for a good recipe for italian soup. Delicious!!

This was soooooo good.  There was just one bad thing....the peppercorns, if they're not totally ground up, taste REALLY bad.  Unless you can grind them really small, I'd just leave it out.
Other than that, 10 stars for this recipe.  One suggestion for ease, consider using frozen prepared meatballs to cut out the extra meat cooking step.

This is SOOOOO Good! I've made it numerous times for the Girl Friends and they rave about it. Plus it's cheaper than going to the chain :). I make it in the crockpot, leaving the spinach/cream out until the very end. 4 Hours on High or 6-7 Hours on Low. Very easy, great to make after a busy day!

I did not have heavy cream but added 8 oz of cream cheese.  It was delicious.  I love garlic so I'll probably increase the amount of garlic next time.  This one is a keeper.

This recipe is excellent as is! After making it the first time, I now use paper towels to soak up as much grease off the sausage and bacon after cooking. Depending on my mood, I'll use less sausage since the original does have a lot of meat in it. Sometimes I use reduced fat condensed milk instead of cream, and sometimes I use kale or swiss chard instead of spinach. That's the great thing about soup; you can alter it to your preferences or what's on hand. This one's a keeper!

I have started to use one pound bulk spicy Italian sausage and one pound sweet bulk Italian sausage without the need for any red pepper flakes and it tastes even better! Especially for my mother in law who doe not prefer spicy foods. I always substitute Kale for the spinnach. By far the best recipe I have found on Allrecipes thus far! Thank you!

This was yummy! I also used kale instead of spinach. The kale is delicious, it really picks up the flavor of the broth. I used a turkey sausage link and cut it into slices instead of ground sausage.

I found ground Italian sausage and used that; much easier than taking the skins off! I cooked the bacon whole and crumbled later, and I used kale instead of spinach because I had it and needed to use it. Wonderful! It's a keeper!

Excellent. I used some sour cream and rice milk with a little corn starch, and a can of cream of mushroom soup in the place of the heavy cream (only cause I was out) and it still turned out great. I also used half maple sausage and half beer brats, sounds crazy....but is delish! I have also made this before as written and it is delicious just the way it is!!

Very good soup, however, I would reduce the amount of broth. All of the delicious flavors of the soup are watered down by too much broth. I would recommend more like a 48 oz. carton of chicken broth. Also, use low sodium broth and add salt to taste. I made this slightly healthier by using Italian seasoned ground turkey instead of sausage and half & half instead of heavy cream. We like a little spice, but not too much, so I only added 1/2 tsp. crushed red pepper. Served it with "Soft Garlic Breadsticks" from this site and it was a nice, warming meal.

Mine turned out really greasy.  Maybe if I rinsed the sausage off after draining, it would have helped.  The flavor was good (used spicy sausage instead of adding the pepper flakes and kale instead of the spinach)

Awesome awesome awesome :) We love this soup served with warm garlic breadsticks for dipping! Perfect for a chilly day! Very easy to make and my husband says tastes BETTER than the zuppa toscana at the popular italian restaurant! I take leftovers to work for lunch the next day bc it makes a lot. Try this soup!

I tweaked it only a bit.  I cooked my sausage, then deglazed with 2 cups white wine.  I did everything else with the exception of the bacon (only because I had none).  It was so delicious!  Thanks for sharing!

I used hot sausages cut into slices and left out the red pepper flakes which was hot enough for my family.  I also used a whole bag of baby spinach and substituted milk and cornstarch for cream as someone else suggested.  After step 2 I put it all in a crockpot for 8 hours and did not add the milk/cornstarch until about 10 minutes before serving.  The end result was GREAT!  I had nice hot soup for a chilly winter night.  This will be a regular crockpot meal in my house!

Very good and easy.  I only used 1/2 of the crushed red pepper and it was still too spicey for the kids.  Next time I'll omit it and just add it at the table.

Fabulous!! Love the spice and earthiness and depth of flavors.  Will make often, especially in the winter. We like spice, so I used 1 Tbsp of red pepper instead of 1 1/4 tsp.  It was so good that I won a soup cook-off with it!

I made this pretty much as described except used evaporated milk.  I triple batched it cause my son came home from college and got together with his friends.  We had this all week-end.  No-one got tired of it.  I shared with friends and they said it does taste just like "you know what Italian Chain".

This soup is amazing!  I used hot Italian sausage instead of mild and kale instead of spinach. I used thinly sliced red potatoes and added extra pressed garlic, 2 tablespoons chicken soup base and 2 bouillion cubes instead of canned broth. I also only cooked the potatoes approximately 8 minutes since they were so thinly sliced. Delicious!

OMG!!! This was DELICIOUS!! The only thing I did different was crumble the sausage into smaller pieces. It was truly amazing. I can't wait to have a dinner party just so I can make this.

Mmmmm.  I doubled the bacon and made sure it was really crispy before crumbling into the soup.  I added extra garlic and onion as those are two of my favorite flavors.  I ended up using extra cream (healthy, I know) and tossed about a 1/2 cup of instant mashed potato flakes in at the end which thickened the soup really nicely.  I only used 4 russet potatoes and ended up with a good ratio of potatoes to the creamy soup.  I used hot italian sausage and still added the crushed red pepper flakes (we like it hot).  I am not generally a fan of fennel but wanted to get as close to possible to the OG recipe so I added 1 teaspoon of roughly chopped fennel seed to the sausage when I was browning it…I'm glad I did.  It's definitely in the OG version and I think I would miss it if I hadn't added it.  I tasted the soup toward the end and didn't feel it was salty enough so I used some garlic salt to enhance the flavor…perfect.  Kale all day…no spinach.  We froze the yummy leftovers and have been enjoying this delicious soup for the past week!  Will definitely be making this one again.

Served this as the opening course for Valentine's Dinner with my husband and my in laws. Everyone loved it. It was so easy. I didn't change anything except used milk instead of heavy cream since that was what I had available. It was so delicious. I could make a meal out of the soup and bread. Mmmmmmm!

This taste like watery milky with chunky extras....

6 potatoes? what size potato? what type of potato?  because 6 potatoes was totally overkill for me. & what size are they slices suppose to be? 

using kale instead of spinach was the best option... spinach would have been mush.

this recipe needs work... 

i'm not sure how anyone is giving this more than one star... they must not have had a bowl from that big italian restaurant. 

Eck... such a disappointment.

While I really liked the way this soup came out, I wouldn't say it's just like the chain restaurant one- at all. It's similar, but not the same. This one, though, is really yummy, super filling and makes a ton.

I have made this many many times. The is hands down the best soup ive ever tasted! I use kale and a lot of it! I also use regular mild instead of cream unless I have it on hand. My 8 year old son loves this soup in fact it was his idea to use more of the "green stuff".

IMHO this was better than the restarant! Only used 1/4 tsp of pepper flakes. Added a tsp of fennel seeds to the broth and used the kale. PERFECTION! A real winner!

Yum, yum, yum!  We absolutely loved this soup.  Based on other reviewers suggestions, I used Kale instead of Spinach and light half and half cream instead of heavy cream.  I lightly sauteed the Kale in the pan I cooked the bacon in (with grease removed; just the remnants in the pan to give the Kale a little flavour).  Used Blue Menu (Zehrs brand) italian sausage, casing removed  (half the fat of regular) and Yukon Gold potatoes.  The taste was out of this world!  My DH kept commenting on how good this soup was--which is a real testament to how good this really was.  Thank you for the recipe.

I used hot Italian sausage and skipped adding more red pepper. Also used a small onion and made up the lack with shallot. Milk with cornstarch and baby bok choi as the green. All changes based on what I had in the fridge, since I made this on the spur of the moment. Still, super good! Served with rustic garlic bread and YUM YUM YUM! Will absolutely make again, though maybe better pantry planning next time!

This turned out great! But I made some of the same changes everyone else did- I used kale instead of spinach, spicy italian sausage and omitted the pepper flakes, and used store bought bacon crumbles instead of cooking my own bacon to cut down on the fat. I also used fat free half & half instead of heavy cream, and boullion instead of broth. 
Also, on a side note, do not boil your potatoes for 20 minutes as the recipe states. For thinly sliced potatoes, this is way too long. I boil the broth (with onion, garlic and bacon), add the potatoes then immediately reduce heat to a simmer. About 10 minutes or so is plenty of time on a strong simmer to cook the potatoes through.

Absolutely fantastic! I have made this twice now, both within about a month. The first time I used half and half instead of heavy cream, because that's what I had on hand, and the second time with the cream. Both tasted the same to me. I also used spinach one time and kale the next, and they were both very good. I omitted the onions only because I don't care for them, and I only used 3 potatoes, but they were large russet potatoes. I added the potatoes at the same time as the broth, let it boil about 10 minutes or so, then added everything else while still on high heat (including the spinach, because I liked the texture better a little more wilted) until the potatoes were soft. This is definitely one of my favorite recipes. I wonder if I could make it kid friendly but still delicious if I omitted the red pepper flakes and/or used mild sausage.

Bellissima! It was so easy to make and the flavor is fantastic! I'm even eating it as I type! 

I did add another tablespoon of garlic (heck...I was a garlic queen!), 2 tablespoons of Italian seasoning and didn't have fresh spinach so I used 1.5 cups of frozen spinach.

Fabulous and easy to make. I made 8 servings and it lasted my husband and I 3 days. And on the 3rd day it was just as good as when I first made it. I added a bit more spice to mine and used a bit of flour to thicken it a touch. Other, than that I kept to the recipe.

Absolutely fabulous! Double the recipe or you will be sorry.  I used one package of sweet Italian sausage and one package of hot Italian and added a bit of fennel seed.  I also used kale just because it's so dang nutritious.

Wonderful!! I forgot to add the bacon & would not even bother with it next time. By all means cook the onion & garlic with the sausage & then drain. Also, if you can't find bulk sausage, buy the packaged w/skins & simply remove. I doubled the recipe & used 1 lb mild & 1 1lb. w/fennel seeds.  Followed the advice of others & used kale, but did have some spinach already on hand to use up, so added it as well. I wanted it a bit thicker & added some instant potato flakes, which didn't change the flavor at all ... just gave it a bit more creamy texture. I garnished with a blend of grated parmesan, asiago & romano cheese & YUM!  Absolutely will make again as it was SO EASY & delicious. Corn would be a great addition to the ingredients.

I can't lie, I haven't had whatever 'chain restaurant' soup this is imitating. However, it's still really good. I must confess I left out the bacon because, to me, adding bacon to anything overpowers all the other flavors. So, I tend to try things with & without bacon. I also used kale instead of spinach (per reviews), and milk + cornstarch instead of cream. The "hot Italian sausage" I bought wasn't hot enough for us, so I added 1.5 tsp of crushed red pepper flakes. Also, I think 6 potatoes is a really large number... maybe really small potatoes?! I added 4 and it seemed like so many, I added extra chicken broth + upped the amount of milk I used. Ultimately I left it cooking for 40 minutes after adding the potatoes, and they were super soft - maybe more potatoes wouldn't have been bad? In any case, I really liked this soup. I let the kale sit in the soup (covered, but off, still on the hot burner) for about 15 minutes and it was really good. Next time... will try with bacon!

I made the soup exactly according to the recipe. I've never had it at the restaurant chain (I suspect it's one I avoid), but this struck me as bacon soup - too much bacon and sausage. I'll stick to potato soup, or a winter veg soup that has greens and potatoes.

This was so yummy and really easy to make.  I had to use half and half because I didn't have any heavy cream but it was still delicious. The only thing I didn't like was that the bacon became kind of soggy and rubbery but I think that was because I didn't cook the bacon until it was extra crispy.  I had sliced up 6 potatoes but ended up only using about 4 because there was not enough broth to boil  all 6 potatoes.

This is so yummy. The first time I made it, I let the sausage boil in with the soup - and it made it really rubbery, so... don't do that. :0) Otherwise, the flavor is fantastic.

Really, really amazingly good! I also used milk and cornstarch instead of heavy cream to save on calories, but you don't miss the cream at all. I often order this at Olive Garden because it's a lower calorie option at the restaurant, so I'm guessing they don't use heavy cream anyway.

I have never had the original but this soup was great! I went with other reviewers and used kale, about 1/4 bunch and also used milk in place of the heavy cream adding 3 Tbs cornstarch for thickness. I also added a Tbs fresh fennel. I will be serving this with a salad and bread with olive oil for dipping.

I thought this soup was good, but not the best sausage soup I've had.  I thought it would be a bit thicker and flavorful.  I will say I thought it was better the next day as leftovers.  I followed the recipe exactly.

Sooo delicious. Changed only the spinach, I used Kale instead as others suggested, and added about a 1/4 tsp. salt. Brought it to a potluck and had 8 people ask for the recipe. Thanks "souporsweets" for sharing.

So yummy. I do think next time I make this I will use kale instead of the spinach, I thought the spinach ended up a little slimy. I added a tad more than the 1 cup of cream. This was really good the next day.

Delicious soup! I definately will make this again! The only reason for the four stars is because I thought the recipe called for too much chicken broth - I used 3.5 cans.

Great soup!!  Admission: I did change it up a bit. I thought I had spinach... apparently I used it all up last night.  Once I realized it - the soup was already half way done... so I threw in carrots and celery about 10 minutes after the potatoes went in.  Also, I didn't have heavy cream, so I used half and half.  It worked great.  The beauty of this soup is that it's flexible.  The flavor was outstanding - and I'm pretty sure it'd taste great, no matter what veggies you had on hand.

I am just learning to embrace soup making, and this was a great one.  I used spicy chicken sausage, and kale instead of spinach.  I also used half & half instead of cream because it was what I had on hand.  I also cubed the potatoes and used about 8 of them.  Delicious!

Great soup! While I was making it, I was a bit concerned it wouldn't turn out well, but much to my surprise, it was a hit (with both my husband and my five year old!) I did have to add some corn starch to thicken it up a bit and added some additional seasonings (salt, pepper and garlic powder) - otherwise I'd give it 5 stars!

I followed the recipe exactly and my whole family loved it, even my 3 year!  It was time consuming to put together, however it was definitly worth it.  Next time I'm going to try it with kale like some of the other reviewers suggested.

This soup for me was just ok.  I've had better recipes that are much like this, so I am biased to them.

I've made this recipe many. many times.  This time I used pre-cooked turkey bacon and just threw it (and the onion and garlic)in for a few minutes after cooking the sausage (Iserno's  chicken Italian). Then added the broth straight to that along with the potatoes. Let them cook and added the kale and 1/2 and 1/2 right at the end to soften for a few minutes.  This made the prep a little easier and less messy.

I was a little concerned when I got almost all the way through cooking this and realized there isn't really any seasoning in it (I cook with a lot of herbs normally) but I assumed that most of the flavor would come from the sausage. The sausage stayed in larger chunks despite my best efforts to cut them down and it was a little overpowering. The rest of the soup had a good flavor base and the spinach was wonderful, but it just seemed to be missing something I couldn't quite put my finger on. I will certainly make this again, but will likely reduce the amount of sausage (not a big fan of it to begin with) and try to fill in the missing flavor (perhaps fresh ground pepper, some salt, maybe a little grate cheese on top?)

I love Olive Garden's Zuppa Toscana soup and I get it every time we go there, so I couldn't believe my eyes when I stumbled across this recipe, I had to make it ASAP.  After reading other people's reviews I did add kale instead of spinach.  Other than that I followed the recipe as is and it is super-delicious.  This one will definitely be a keeper.  Thanks for posting this recipe. I love it. :)

A simple, rustic and hearty soup!  I used half chicken and half beef broth, because it was what I had on hand.  As another reviewer suggested, I used the milk/cornstarch mixture instead of heavy cream.  Instead of regular potatoes, I used fingerling and just doubled the amount.  Yummy!

This soup really is super-delicious!  The only change I make is to use 1 whole bunch of fresh kale instead of the spinach.  The boyfriend likes to add a little fresh grated sharp parmesan to top off the bowl which does give it an extra kick, but the soup really is great without it.

My sil liked this a lot and wanted me to send him the link.  It was OK, but I don't plan on making it again myself.  I would suggest that it might be better to put the crushed red pepper flakes on the table instead of in the pot.

This turned out really good! I was skeptical at first since Olive Garden has the BEST Zuppa Toscana and I'm easily disappointed. I left out the bacon and didn't miss it. I used Scimeca sausage, cut the ingredients in half since this was so much. Used just a little of the crushed red pepper because I don't care too much for spicy. This was really good, coming from a girl who's easily disappointed! Thank you for this!

I love Zuppa Toscana and was happy to find a recipe. Like reviewers said, I used Kalp instead of spinach, I tore of the edges and put it in the last 10 minutes of simmering. Also I used spicy sausage. 1lb is wayyy too much sausage, next time i will only use 1/2 lb. 6 potatoes are way too much too. I only used 3 large ones and it still seemed like the soup was more of a stew. For good flavor put the sausage in the soup at the beginning instead of the end. Overall doing these things I got rave reviews for my dinner guests and I personally thought it tasted better than the restaurant style. 5 stars!!

Absolutely loved this soup. Bought the sausages in casing and just removed it. Sauteed regularly. Used 6 slices bacon and 2 containers of chicken broth. Also used 1/2 cup 5% cream and 1/2 cup milk. Like all the others used Kale.
Made some homeade dinner rolls and it was a great dinner!

I substituted in kale, but otherwise this recipe is very close to the Olive Garden restaurant soup.  I've made it a few times for myself and others and enjoyed it greatly.  I used small golden Yukon potatoes but think I would use regular Russet potatoes instead next time.  The Yukon potatoes got overly soft too easy.

I truly expected something wonderful, based on all the reviews; I just don't get it!  I was able to rescue this soup with a few modifications.  After cooking the onions and garlic, I stirred in a few tablespoons of flour, cooking for a few minutes. Then I added the chicken broth and peeled and cubed potatoes.  I used Swiss Chard instead of spinach or kale since it's a wonderfully sweet green. Grated a half cup or so of parmigiano reggiano in so it had some flavor, otherwise this is a thin, bland soup.   It does go together quickly though, which is good, but benefits from thickening and flavor-boosting.

My husband compared this to a soup that he had at the Olive Garden. What a compliment! The only thing I didn't like about it was when it cooled it would seperate and you could see the cream seperated from the oils. It just didn't look appetizing and because of that sometimes missed out on the leftover opportunities. :-)

"You Rock" were the words out of my husbands mouth after I made this for dinner! Per reviews, I used hot italian sausage and replaced the spinach with kale. Other than that, I did not change a thing. You can't go wrong with this recipe, definitely a keeper!  I was kind of disappointed with the orange grease at the top of the soup, but oh well. THANK YOU THANK YOU!

Yummy, made this on a very cold night.  I left out the bacon, just because I did not have any and used milk instead of cream.  I used a whole bag of baby spinach.  Easy, delicious soup.  Cant wait to eat the leftovers today :)

Oh. My. Goodness. This recipe is spot on! (With kale instead of spinach, of course, though)  It was sooo delicious. We made some salad and breadsticks to go along with it and it was an amazing dinner ;)  We didn't add quite a full cup of cream, but it was plenty!   Yum!

I have been making this recipe for 10 years and have made different versions.  I use links and remove the skins of the italian sausage, only use 1 tsp.of the crushed pepper flakes and substitute one cup of shredded sweet potato for the regular potato for a healthier version.  Instead of cans of broth, I use two quart boxes of low sodium chicken broth and I sub thinly chopped kale for the spinach which I find has a better texture.  Also added two tablespoons of flour to half and half instead of heavy cream and shake it up to dissolve and thicken the soup.  Yummmy.

Pretty tasty!  I, like others used kale instead of spinach.  Next time I may try using smoked sausage instead of italian sausage.

Everyone thought it was good. It needed more broth and maybe next time use half and half.

Very good! A little too greasy to me and I will definitely find a way to cook it w/less grease next time but my husband loved it as is. A tip for the spinach. Since I knew there would be lots of leftovers and didn't want limp spinach in the leftovers I just put a handful of spinach in each bowl and topped it with the soup and broth. A few minutes later I stirred the soup and it was perfect. Topped with Parmesan cheese.

Oh my, my new favorite soup! This was absolutely amazing!  I doubled the bacon, used Italian sausage links, removed the casings and browned in the oven. I used one tsp. of the red pepper flakes and it was just the right amount of heat for me. Because it holds up so much better than spinach I used kale instead and while the onion and garlic mixture was sauteing and the sausage was browning I put my chicken stock in the soup pot and threw in my kale so it could start to cook.  Not much gets by without the addition of my usual garlic and onion powders and I also added dried parsley and black pepper. Once done, I added in Fat Free half and half and only because I thought it looked pretty, I placed a big handful of baby spinach into each bowl before ladling in the soup. Thank you so much for one terrific recipe!! Yum!!!!

This was so good!!  Didn't know quite what to expect since I have never had it before.  My family loved it.  Like they said.......how can you go wrong with potatoes, sausage, and bacon????  I didn't have whipping cream, so I used fat free half and half.   Added about 1 Tbs. of Italian seasoning and some fresh basil.  I will definitly make again,

We loved this soup!  Thank you for a wonderful recipe; simple and yet delicious.  I did not have heavy cream, but sour cream worked perfectly.  And while there was no cheese in the recipe, we couldn't resist the addition of some shredded pepper jack and cheddar.  Will be making this soup again for sure!

If you want to make the Olive Garden version of Zuppa Toscana, use Kale instead of spinach and cut back on the heavy cream.

THE BEST SOUP EVER, the only thing I changed was I used a smoked sausage as well as the Italian, I find Italian to be too greesy. But i lost some of the spice and had to add some hot sauce. But what flavor. Huge hit in my house and i'v now had to make it for coworkers. Thank you for sharing such a great new favorite of mine. 
Cheers. P.S for the people who dont like this soup try it again, becuase there is no way this isnt' a 5 star soup!

LOVED this soup!  I sued spicy italian sausage so I left the red pepper flakes out.  It was very filling and flavorful.  My husband doesn't think soup are an entree but this soup changed his mind a bit!  I also completely forgot about the spinach, all in all it was still very good. I will be making it again!

The only thing I do differently is add more bacon and use kale instead of spinach. This tastes even better than Olive Garden! Thank you for the awesome recipe.

LOVE LOVE LOVE! It is "souper" easy to make and the perfect comfort soup. I always make a large batch to take to work for lunch. Having this at Olive Garden, to be able to make it myself, I like having full control of all the salt and cream that goes into this. I have made it with spinach and with kale. Personally I prefer using kale. It tends to have much more of a bite and the texture works very well against the smooth potato. I like to use a combination mild and hot italian sausage, which give just that extra kick along with the red pepper flakes. I can't rave enough about this soup. Make sure to serve with a baguette on the side, you will keep dipping it in that delicious broth and (almost) forget to use your spoon for the rest!

Just like O.G. soup!  My family loved it!  I accidentally put in double the red pepper flakes (Don't do that!!!) so it was a little off, but I could tell that was the reason.  I chopped the spinach into smaller pieces for ease of eating and cooked up an entire package of bacon (and drained it).  It was perfect with homemade bread and salad.

Excellent soup! I thought 6 potatoes would be too much, but it's perfect. Also, I used more spinach than called for and wish I hadn't. Don't mess with this recipe, it's right on!

We liked it. Better than good but didn’t rise to the 5* ‘love it’ category. Made as written other than using more generous portions of hot Italian sausage and bacon, and the hot, rather than mild, sausage likely kept this recipe from falling to a 3*. I now better appreciate other reviewers saying it tasted bland to them . . . not exactly bland to us but didn’t pack an expected big flavor punch for such a highly loved soup. We don’t eat a lot of Italian cuisine but the Zuppa Toscana we’ve had at independent Italian restaurants seemed to have had a bit thicker base than this one. May try tinkering with this recipe to make it more creamy but it won’t be soon as this site has many other excellent soup recipes.

A delicious twist on dinner for a Sunday night.  Unusual flavor for a soup.  Didn't have cream so used plain whole-milk yogurt.  Otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Loved it and will make again!  Hearty and filling and nutritious.

Yum! I had never had this at OG but after hearing a co-worker talking about it I had to try it. I used kale instead of spinach and cubed my potatoes. Delicious!! The only thing I will have to tweak is putting the kale in sooner since it takes a little longer than spinach to cook. I brought leftovers to my co-worker that was talking about how much he like this soup at OG and he said this is better than theirs! My husband ate it and raved on it and that's saying a lot because he is a self professed soup hater.

This was without question the best soup I've ever had.  I sprinkled a little parmesan cheese on at the end but that was the only change.  I even heated up the rest for the following days lunch and i think it was even better.  Thanks!

This soup is AMAZING.  It really is like the soup at Olive Garden.  A few modifications--I do not use the bacon.  I use a bit less cream (I just pour it in until the soup is the right color for me.  It's probably 1/2 C of cream.)  I use kale instead of spinach, since that's what OG does.  Sometimes I use the bulk hot Italian sausage instead of the mild.  I like the extra spiciness!  I have made this so many times, and it is always wonderful!

I've gotten RAVE reviews on this recipe!  My family always expects me to bring the different dish to get togethers and this delivered!  My father in-law said it was better than the OG chain!  I'll take that!  I did make some changes I added garlic to the sausage and the broth, added basil and oregano, used sweet Italian sausage, kale, and used some parsley at the very end for some added pzazz!  All the kids loved it except the ones who wouldn't even try it, and everyone is asking for the recipe...that I won't give them lol.

excellent recipe that very closely mimics the restaurant version with the exception that authentic  zuppa toscana requires kale, not spinach.

This soup was incredible! I made it as stated and it was a serious hit for a dinner party I had. Warning: careful with the red pepper flakes. I was a little heavy handed and it showed! Wooh! Good, hot stuff!

My whole family was dubious about this one - too much sausage! What on earth is kale? (I subbed it in for spinach) - but it was an indisputable hit. Every single person LOVED it. 

Absolutely delicious.

Made according to recipe except subbing kale for spinach.  I'm giving it three stars since the recipe as written almost failed.  What went wrong: 1) I used 6 sliced on a mandoline medium potatoes, organic from Trader Joes so I'm not sure what type they were although they were golden colored, that never turned to mush so the broth was very very thin.  Had to use my immersion (stick) blender to puree it which thickened it up a little bit.  2) Still a very thin soup so I added a cup and a half of potato flakes which saved the soup.  3) Although I drained the sausage it turned the soup orange.  After pureeing the soup it really looked like baby food.  Read other reviews after the fact and some people rinsed the cooked sausage before adding it to the soup.  I've never heard of that before and wished it had been in the directions.  Fortunately, the addition of the potato flakes helped absorb all the sausage grease floating on top so it wasn't as unappetizing as before.  4) Wait to add the red pepper flakes or use a very small amount.  I used less than the recipe called for and it was still really spicy even with using mild Italian sausage.  On a slightly positive note, it's nice to have a meal that I can sneak in some raw kale but this was not a soup for my toddler or preschooler.  My husband and I each ate 1 small bowl but as for the leftovers...it's going to take a long time to finish this soup.  The type of potato used in this soup must be the key to make it a success.

I don't usually rate recipes - but had to say - this is one of the best I've tried.  Didn't have the spinach so just made it without it.  DELICIOUS.  Tastes just like the restaurant version.  Excellent!

This soup was Delicious!!!  It is now my favorite soup!  I made it as written and next time will use half and half or milk instead of heavy cream.  I have a child with a dairy allergy and will the least amount of dairy the better.  cant wait to make it again.

Oh wow!  This is quite delicious, thick and hearty!  I subbed turkey sausage for the Italian to make it healthier and I also added fennel seeds (a must in my opinion).  SO delicious with a crusty bread.  I also added chicken bouillon with milk since I didn't have enough broth.  Next time I will try it with part skim, part half and half to cut calories and maybe add a little bit of potato flakes to thicken.  SO GOOD! Perfect for winter!

For a more healthy twist and a completely vegetarian version, I used vegan Italian "sausage", veggie bacon, vegetable broth, and substituted milk thickened with potato starch for cream. Also, I added chopped celery and kale for more veggies. It came out great! I had the vegan meat products frozen so I grated the vegan sausage and diced the veggie bacon and let them render in olive oil and garlic until crisp to bring out the flavors. Delish!

This soup is the best ever!  I'm not generally a soup eater but I nearly always have a batch of this in the fridge.  Just a few minor tweaks for me - many of which were in the recipe when I received it from a friend:  I use the sage ground sausage because it's my favorite.  Rather than cook bacon, I use real bacon bits from the salad dressing section of my grocery store - cheap and easy!  I omit the onion because my roommate hates onion - don't miss it.  Rather than using chicken broth, I cook the potatoes in 12 cups of water and add four tbsp of chicken bouillon granules.  I use kale rather than spinach and, because I eat this soup so often, I no longer use the cream but have used half and half or even milk. I also use one tablespoon of the pepper  flakes because I like it spicy.  I like another reviewer's suggestion of using cauliflower in place of the potatoes.  I'll try that next time I make it.  I love, love, love this soup.  EDIT:  Tried it with the cauliflower.  Pretty darn good, I must say.  This soup is so, so wonderful!

3rd soup of 52 for the year.  And they keep getting better.  This one leaves some heat on the tongue, which I LOVE.  As usual I altered the recipe a bit as usual, but the core is there and AMAZING.  I added some asparagus, used Turkey Bacon, and didn't add any cream to make it a little healthier.  I also skimmed some of the grease off the top because the sausage and bacon can be greasy.  All together the best soup I have made ever.  The heat is great, the heartiness is awesome and I am impressed.  Might have to get another bowl as I write this.

I used hot italian sausage instead of mild and left out the red pepper flakes. The key to this recipe is a good sausage I think as that is where you get a lot of flavor. I also cooked the onions with the sausage to absord all the yummy flavor and then drained it before adding my broth. I also sliced the spuds thick to give it some body. This is my husbands favorite soup when we go out and he said he "doesn't want any of that other  ever again!" I'm guessing he liked it :)

This is a great soup.  I used venison sausage but other than that I did not make any changes to the recipe.  For the potatoes I used an entire bag of small red potatoes (the kind that are pre-cleaned and ready to steam in the microwave).  I used spinach, but may try the kale next time. Thanks for a great recipe.

It really IS Super-Delicious!!! Perfect, hearty, easy and will make again and again! Note though: I'll leave out the spinach in my children's bowls as they refused to eat it.

Delicious soup.  Will make again.  I did add carrots and celery and sauteed with the onion.  I only used two small red potatoes as we are low carb.  Next time I will use, as others have suggested, cauliflower to replace the potatoes but did not have any on hand.  I used one sweet Italian sausage and 3 jimmy dean breakfast sausages, since that is all I had.  The sausage gave this soup an extra depth that I never had when making a potato soup with just bacon.

Enjoyed the flavor of this soup, made the recipe as directed. Hope it would be thicker; however, it was truly enjoyable.

Excellent! Very easy to make and tastes just like the restaurant. The only change is a little more spinach.

I LOVE this soup!!

This tastes SO MUCH like the Olive Garden's version.  The only thing I MIGHT change--not even sure of this--is I might reduce the amount of red pepper flakes by a bit.  

Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

I followed another user's suggestion to replace the cream with milk and a tablespoon of cornstarch, because they don't make lactose-free heavy cream.  It is some of the best soup I've ever had, I will make it again and again.  Also used kale.

VERY GOOD!!! I used kale rather than spinach. This is a budget and tummy friend meal! My husband loved it also. I forgot to add the crushed red pepper with the sausage and just threw it in at the end right before I added the kale. It was fine. I was very pleased.

Loved it.  I didn't read directions thouroughly and left the sausage in with the potatoes while they cooked.  A little greasy, but still very good.

This tasted just the same as I remember it from the restaurant!  I had to substitute regular ground sausage and added fennel seed and italian seasongings while cooking to give it the italian sausage taste, but made it otherwise exactly as written.  We'll be making this one again for sure! Thanks for sharing!

Almost perfect.  A bit too brothy for our liking, I think next time I'll spice it up more and maybe add cavatelli. Oh and dice potatoes instead of slice but otherwise a great recipe!

DELICIOUS!! Made it with kale. It was a bit on the spicy side, but we are wimps when it comes to spice. The next day the flavors were even more potent. Will definitely make again. We served it with garlic bread knots.

Amazing! Tastes just like the Zuppa Toscana from the Olive Garden. I also used spicy Italian sausages and kale like some of the other reviewers.  I also left out the bacon and used whole milk instead of heavy cream. It was delicious!

This soup turned out absolutely AMAZING! It tastes better than the one from "the famous Italian restaurant". I substituted kale for the spinach and I added in 2 cups of whipping cream (by accident) and it turned out WONDERFUL! I am not going to change anything the next time I make it! It was a hit within my house!

Perfect!!! I made a double batch to feed my family of 6. Everyone LOVED the soup! I did add 1 tsp. of Fennel and only 1 1/2 tsp. of the crushed pepper for the double batch. Again I will say it..Perfect! Thank you for the wonderful recipe! I will make this over and over! One of my boys gave me a hug and said "you nailed it Mom"

This recipe is great! To give it a little extra kick I added some cayenne, cumin, and black pepper. I substituted spinach for kale and shredded some fresh parm on top before serving and it made it taste like perfection.

WOW!!! My mom and I used to always get Zuppa from Olive Garden and we loved it! I haven't had it in years and stumbled upon this recipe and just made it about an hour ago.... DELISH!!!!!!! Fiance is not a soup person and he just inhaled a bowl of it! Super super good! We even didn't have onion and it turned out phenom. I don't have a dutch oven so I just used a pan and a pot... I did add more pepper and xantham gum because I like really thick soups. This was absolutely amazing, it's going with me for lunch tomorrow!!

This recipe can be easily customized to please different tastes & dietary needs. For a bolder flavor I used 2 large bouillon cubes & water instead of canned broth. I am lactose intolerant so I used lactose free milk & 3 tbsp of cornstarch instead of cream. Next time I will use the number of potatoes the recipe calls for (not less) & hot sausage and no red pepper flakes instead of mild. I forgot to add the kale and it still turned out delicious. Thanks!

I've used this recipe forever-- it is so easy and delicious! I do use kale instead of spinach I think it's much more authentic to the restaurant. I also don't take out the sausage and readd it back to Heath through, I just add it all except the kale and cream and just put those two in at the last minute-- delicious!

Absolutely amazing.  This is an incredibly tasty soup - serve with some crusty bread to dip in the soup and a small salad and you have yourself a really delicious and filling meal.  I made an Italian caprese salad - fresh buffalo mozzarella, sliced tomatoes and fresh basil, drizzled with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  Also had some store-bought ciabatta bread with it.  I'm honestly going to be sad when my leftovers run out, this soup is uh-may-zing.  I'm not even kidding.  Also, I made it with the kale, not spinach - makes all the difference.  I would not make with spinach.  Try this recipe - you will NOT be disappointed.

Tastes just like Olive Garden's. Note to self - only use 1/2 - 1 tsp of crushed red pepper flakes.  Our local grocery store makes their sausage on the spicy side.

Love this recipe.  However, i frequently make it on the cheap...leave out the bacon, use boullion, kale (no spinach), and milk (no cream).  Of course the potato, garlic and onion come from the garden.....YUMMY!!!!

I used sweet Italian Sausage, frozen diced onion, frozen spinach and 2  canns of potatoes.  After browning, I didn't add bacon, instead I sauteed the onions, garlic and frozen spinach.  I added the chicken broth and potatoes and brought it to a boil.  I added  a cup of half and half and sauasage and reduced heat to low.

Super delicious!  I did not have potatoes, so I used frozen hash browns ... the rest of the recipe I followed exactly.  The recipe could not have been better.

I love this soup. I use some HOT Italian sausge along with the mild. I make almost 1.5 lbs of sausage... Used 7 slices of center cut bacon and 9 cups of chicken broth. I followed the rest of the recipe exact except for only putting 1tsp of pper flakes because I use the HOT sausage. 2 Handfuls of baby spinach at the end and you are WINNING!!

I have made this recipe a few times now.  I modify as I need to with what I have.  We have a ton of sausage from the butcher so sometimes I cut up sausage links instead of using ground.  Sometimes I use cans of broth and other times I use homemade stock.  I tend to make my potatoes a bit bigger and when done cooking, I take a potato masher and just  lightly mash the whole soup.  I also often freeze this soup into individual servings. Made this soup for a soup exchange and it was the first soup to get picked by most everyone there.  Thanks!

I made this soup about a month ago but forgot to rate it. My husband loved it, I thought it was a little to creamy. I used kale instead of spinach because it is so much heartier. I will make again with hot italian sausage and just not add the red pepper flakes.

Good one! My husband asked me to find this recipe after having it at one of the well-known chain Italian restaurants recently.

He said this recipe was still very good but seemed to be missing something and thinks it may have been that this recipe calls for bacon instead of pancetta?

Excellent! Changed the spinach to kale and decreased the amount of cream and used some milk/potato for thickener. I used chicken sausage with fennel to cut down on the fat- very tasty!

This soup was very easy to prepare and tasted just like the famed soup from OG.  The only thing I changed was I used kale instead of spinach (seeing as OG has kale in theirs...).   Next time I'll make sure I have some cheese to sprinkle on the top just before serving.   I will be making this soup A LOT!

This was super-delicious!  Using what was in the pantry, I omitted the bacon and used Al Fresco Sweet Italian Chicken sausage.  We sprinkled a little parmesan over top before serving.

I didn't have any fresh spinach and didn't feel like going to the store, so I used a package of frozen spinach instead.  I added it before the cream,since it was frozen and then added the cream just before serving.  My hubby and I love a lot of spinach in our soups, so this was perfect.

Soup is absolutely delicious! I used a turkey italian sausage, and used spinach this time since it's what I had on hand.  Next time I'll use kale like the other reviewers suggested. Thanks for the recipe!

AMAZING!!! I loved it and so did my dinner guest! Like everyone else, I tweaked the recipe a bit. Instead of regular russet potatoes I used red potatoes (always my favorite!). I also used Kale instead of spinach like everyone else was suggesting and it came out perfect and still had some texture! Instead of using mild sausage I used spicy sausage which gave it a little kick! Fabulous and Im definitely making it again!

This was great.  My only changes were that I used italian turkey sausage, and I only used about 1/3 cup half and half instead of the one cup of heavy cream, which was plenty.  You will not miss the extra fat and calories!  Next time I will probably add another potato or two. Thanks for a good recipe!

This was pretty good - I followed the recipe to a T other then I only used 1 teaspoon of red pepper flakes and I used some minced onion as I did not have a regular onion hand. My husband thought this was GREAT - I would not add the red pepper flakes next time and I would take more of the leftover bacon grease out before adding the chicken broth. Really liked the spinach in it to give a mild crunch.

I cooked this as is except after cooking sausage bacon onions and garlic I put that in a crock pot with the chicken broth. I cooked on low and about an hour before it was served added the cream and potatos. 15 mins before serving added the spinach (couldn't find Kale in this small town).  This soup is so good on a cold day.

This is very yummy I used cauliflower like someone had said to use in place of potatoe. Added a chopped up habanero to make it extra spicy and used kale instead of spinich like people had said also.To make it even healthier I used a half a pound of sausage.

Very Good! It had just the right amount of zip to it! I used 2 buches of Kal and 7 potatoes, as we like a bit more girth to our soup. Instead of heavy cream I used Lowfat Buttermilk which is half the Cholesterol of 2% milk. It has a bit more sodium though.... choose your demon. I used Bob Evans Itailian bulk sausage which has fennel and other seasonings in it. This is my favorite soup from that unnamed restaurant, and I'm almost giddy that I can make it at home now! Thanks for posting !!!

This soup was good, though not as wonderful as most of the reviews made it sound. I will probably make it again, with a few tweaks. It's not something I would ever make more than 2-3 times a year, due to health issues.  It was a nice little change of pace.

I work on a pig farm. Added just a little bit of rendered leaf lard to the soup. Gives it an incredible richness. Something to consider if you have access to high quality lard. Also, throw in a large sprig of rosemary while the potatoes are boiling. Yum.

This recipe can be made much easier, and less of a big process by following this: Put some olive oil in a big pot, brown the garlic and onions, add the sausage and brown. While that's browning cook the bacon in the microwave until it is crispy and done.  Strain the sausage mixture, return to pot, add bacon and broth.  Let it boil, add the potatoes.  **I sliced my potatoes using my KitchenAid mixer thin slicing attachment...worked perfectly**  When the potatoes are cooked, add the cream, tear some kale up with your hands and you're set.  Next time I will try using 4 potatoes.  I did six, added almost all of them in, and there were way too many potatoes, so I scooped a lot of them out.  Then when we sat down to eat, I felt like I scooped too many out.  I think 4 small-med. potatoes would be the perfect amount.  The recipe was still delicious, and everyone liked it.  I gave it a four because I think the directions could be made much simpler by how I did it above.  Also, I used kale instead of spinach.

Simple & Delicious - but beware - it's 6 BIG servings!  I made for 20 and it fed them all plus supplied enough leftovers to send some home with each guest as well as stock my freezer!  I think that doubling the recipe would have been sufficient.

Wow!! I've made this twice already in one weekend! My husband has been raving about it and he's very hard to please. I used hot sausage the first time without the red pepper flakes. The second I used mild sausage and added some crushed red and black pepper. Both ways were equally good. I also followed all of the reviews and used kale instead of spinach and it was very good! Overall a great soup recipe and my new favorite!

Not bad but not super delicious either. It was just "good" I guess I was expecting a thicker broth which I didn't get. Will use this recipe as a starting point and do a thicker creamier base next time.

Delicious and simple to make. I've never eaten at Olive Garden, so I can't speak to it tasting like theirs, but it's very, very good. Will definitely add this to my soup rotation.

Exellent, re-warms well, just one suggestion, do not fry the bacon with the onions.  Fry the bacon, then remove from pot, (I use lean bacon, so very little fat left), saute onions and garlic, then add bacon back and continue with rest of the recipe.    Great recipe, my husbnd loved it and it makes great leftovers.

This is the real deal.  It's super delicious.  I used spinach, since that's what I had on hand, but I think kale might be better.  Either way, it's awesome and perfect with bread for dipping.

OOoooh my goodness, sooo tasty! There's a reason this recipe is so highly rated! I just made this soup a few days ago and have been feasting on the leftovers since then, and it only improved during its time in my fridge! I just finished it yesterday, but already I am contemplating making more.

Next time I make it I think I will either use hot italian sausage, or add more chili flakes, because I love things spicy. This soup had a kick to it, but nothing too extreme in case anyone was worried. Oh, and I also used kale instead of spinach, and it held up beautifully in my leftovers.

Also, I didn't drain the sausage as well as i should have and the grease was really orange, and made the soup less appetizing looking. I ended up cooling the soup and skimming the top layer of orange off before reheating and serving.

i loved this soup. it was thick and wonderful. though i did make a few changes, i used half vegetable broth and half chicken broth, added some peperoni, used the whole bag of spinach, used one instead of four potatoes, added rosemary and basil, and added some parmasean cheese. it was gorgeous. the only complaint i have is in this soups nutritional value, how ever it was delisious. thanks :)

I loved this soup.  I used kale instead of spinach and sauteed the kale in a seperate pan with olive oil and a little of the drippings from the sausage.  Dont know if it made a difference but the soup was delicious.

I have made this several times and have passed the recipe out to many. This is an excellent soup with lots of flavor. The only change I made was adding italian seasoning. Will continue to make this over and over.

Great Soup! Followed the recipe with the exception of the spinach and reducing the crushed red pepper flakes slightly. Like many others, I used Kale and it is a perfect substitution. I reduced the red pepper flakes to approx. 3/4 teasp. so that my 1 1/2 year old granddaughter could eat it. Our only complaint was that the base was thin and needed to be thickened a little before serving. Thanks for sharing!

Very good. I, too, used kale instead of spinach. This made a lot more than 6 servings, but the crock pot full that I brought to work didn't last long among my coworkers!

Followed exact recipe except I used hot turkey Italian sausage, only 1/4 pepper flakes, and kale instead of spinach. I also left the skin on the potatoes. My husband loves the soup at OG and said this is very similar. He gives it 5 stars but it is too rich for my tastes. It is very high in fat so I will only make it on occasion. Next time I won't use heavy cream.

This recipe is delicious! Only change I made was to use fat free half and half instead of heavy cream and turkey sausage instead of pork.  The spinach at the end adds a really good  flavor to the soup.  Can't wait to make again.

Loved this soup. I used the bacon fat to cook onions and garlic.( I didn't use the bacon in the soup) Just dumped the cooked meat in with the potatoes and let it simmer. Everyone loved it.

Just like Olive Garden!  Seriously!  So excited to have found this recipe.  I used 7 pieces of bacon instead of 4 and when I cut up 5 potatoes it looked like too much, so I stopped there.  Well, it would have been better with the 6...but that's my own fault.  Also used kale instead of spinach and 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream.  So good!!

Made this for the first time tonight and will definitely be making it again! The overall flavor was familiar but with a most definitely distinct Italian twist that sent people back for seconds. I used half n half (all I had on hand) 1 1/2 cup instead of cream, Yukon Gold potatoes (just because I think they have a better taste) and I crushed my own red peppers (approx 5) instead of using flakes. The only tweaks I will try next time is maybe adding some potato flakes to thicken the mixture a bit. Otherwise, was great! Thanks for posting a wonderful recipe :)

Very nice recipe! I used turkey sausage and half n half to make it a bit less fattening. I also cooked the onion and garlic in olive oil as opposed to the bacon fat. I used kale which held up quite nicely in the soup. Will definitely make again.

Tastes just like Olive Garden's!!! I've also made this for my daycare and left out the peppers and other than a couple of picky eaters, the kids loved it too. I've used kale instead of spinach and don't think I'd even try the spinach. The kale holds up well in the soup and gives that perfect bite! Mmm!

I couldn't believe that this tasted just like the restaurant soup! I used Italian chicken sausage and skipped the bacon. I also used about 6 cups of kale instead of spinach, and just poured in about 1.5 cups of skim milk at the end. This made the soup much lighter (calculated to be only about 200 calories for the bowl) and it honestly didn't sacrifice taste.

One son loves this, the other thinks it's fine, but wouldn't ask for it. The one who loves it actually craves it. Different tastes, I suppose. I use kale and turkey italian sausage.

I couldn't get enough of this soup.  I used gnocchi instead of potatoes.  I didn't have any cream so I used milk mixed with some corn starch.  It was FABULOUS!

I wonder where my first review of this went...This is excellent!!!  I used all 6 potatoes and didn't have any problem at all.  I did let it simmer longer than what was stated.  I will be making this over and over again!!!

WAY, WAY, WAY TOO MUCH POTATO!!! I don't know what happened when this recipe was submitted, but there's no way that the potato quantity is even close to being right. But never-the-less, Best zuppa toscana I've ever had. Followed the recipe's instructions (minus several potatoes), and the spice advice of previous reviews. Received positive comments from everyone at the party.

Used half broth and half water. Used real bacon bits thrown in with the sausage instead of frying bacon. Oh, and used half and half instead of heavy cream. It was really good! Will add more potatoes next time. **Make a lot and use kale, more potatoes, and hot sausage without red pepper flakes, no bacon. Still very good and less fat/sodium.

This recipe came out delicious! My husband said it was better than the one we previously fell in love with at Olive Garden. I used homemade broth, and Italian sausage that I made with turkey breast meat only. I also used reduced sodium turkey bacon. I cut the fat but not the taste, it was soooo good! Thanks so much for sharing! This will definitely become part of the regular menu at my house!

I really don't know why I decided to make this soup. All I know is that it is AMAZING! Only change I made was that I used hot sausage and no pepper flakes. Also, I felt it needed black pepper, so I added some in.

I modified the recipe just a little.  Used spicy sausage as our family likes a little more kick.  Then just added some more potatoes and broth.  It is very, very good.  In fact, I'm making this soup tonight for family and friends.

Oh My Gosh! Loved it! I made it exactly as called for in recipe except that I used kale instead of spinach. My son ate the entire pot and when I say entire I mean just that - the Entire Pot, minus the 1 small bowl he allowed me to have :). I baked a loaf of bread and we used it to soak up the delicious gravy like soup.  YUM! In fact, I'm making this tomorrow night when it starts snowing - Can't Wait!!

YUM!  I followed the recipe exactly but only had chicken sausage with spinach on hand.  Would have been six stars with browned crumbled Italian sausage!

Update:  I have made this recipe three or four times now, and I have tried it with turkey italian sausage and with pork Italian sausage.  With kale and with spinach.  I have to say, my favorite is the pork Italian sausage, it browns up very nicely and adds a deeper flavor.  The kale has more texture than the spinach, and the flavor is unchanged.  Still and AWESOME recipe!!

This was a delicious soup.  I made it according to recipe, but left out the red pepper - used 1/2 mild and 1/2 hot sausage instead and kale rather than spinach.  I brought it to a Christmas Eve soup dinner and everyone loved it!  I will make it again.

This was sooo good, the only difference I made was definately the Kale rather than spinach, makes a huge difference.  Not sure how the spinach would have tasted.  I also used less red pepper flakes because my kids were eating this soup with me and aren't a fan of spicy foods.  I did add more garlic than called for.  I added two large cloves rather than just one.  Definate keeper!

This soup has great flavor- even using half and half it had a smooth creaminess with the perfect kick. My red potatoes seemed to hold up pretty well after simmering on the stove for a couple hours. Since my husband doesn't like spinach, I left it out and only added it to the bottom of my bowl. It tastes great either way. I'm not sure if it's because I didn't use heavy cream, but I found the soup to be a bit thin for my liking.

I made this to get rid of some Italian sausage in the freezer.  It looked just like the famous restaurant’s version, but for some reason, it tasted nothing like it.  The only changes I really made (other than using kale like the restaurant does) were to use turkey bacon and low sodium chicken broth; could this have been my problem?  The soup didn’t taste bad, but it didn’t taste like the restaurant version, either.  Hmm, might have been my fault…  Well, anyway, I probably won’t make this again since I rarely buy Italian sausage as hubby is not a fan.  Thanks anyway! :)  UPDATE: I tried the soup after a night in the fridge and BOY, WHAT A DIFFERENCE!!  I think the flavors from the sausage needed to mix with the broth; that’s what was missing from the taste.  Now, the soup tastes GREAT and VERY close to the famous restaurant’s version!  I most certainly will make this again, but I will let in sit in the fridge a day or two before serving—the difference is amazing.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a very good soup.  When ever I make it I wonder why I don't make it more often.  This soup warms you from the inside.  A great soup on a cold autumn/winter night in northern Michigan.  Thanks allrecipes......you never let me down.  Have referred many people to this wonderful site......couldn't live with out you.  Keep up the great work.

LOVED this recipe! Taste just like the stuff you get at Olive Garden but better cause it's homemade! I didn't have bacon on hand, but I do think it would have added a nice extra depth of flavor, so don't skimp if you don't have to! I also used spicey italian sausage out of personal preference, as well as kale instead of spinach and it was amazing!

I followed the recipe, but didn't end up with very much liquid for the soup part. It was starting to boil away while cooking the potatoes. Over all, was pretty tasty, I used mild italian sausage, just way too much fennel for me.

This is a great soup!  If you love potato soup, I definitely recommend this one.  I omitted the red pepper flakes (little mouths over here).  And I used spinach, which was okay the first night, but not so good when it was reheated.  I really vacillated about using kale, but next time I will for sure.  Oh, and I would recommend peeling the potatoes (just in case you're like me and skip this step when you can).  I used a mix of russets (peeled) and reds (unpeeled) and found that the red potato skins were an annoying distraction in the soup.  We served this up with plenty of freshly cracked black pepper for that added zip.

Excellent flavor soup! I preferred to chop the potatoes, instead of slice, and chop the spinach before adding. And to make it healthier, I used Italian turkey sausage and omitted all but one slice of the bacon. And, my family doesn't like spicy things, so I only used 1/2 of the red pepper at first.  However, I did add the whole amount called for, after tasting, and it was not too spicy, even for us. Also, it has a very thin broth. I would of preferred it a little thicker. But, with the good flavor like it has, we really enjoyed it anyway. I will definitely make over and over.. just with our preferences, to be healthier.

This is a wonderful recipe!!  I've never had the soup at a restaurant, so I guess I don't have anything to compare it to.  However, having made quite a few soups myself, this one is by far the tastiest, heartiest soup I've had yet.  I was worried at the lack of seasonings in the recipe, but the bacon and sausage went a long way toward giving the soup a lot of flavor.  The only thing I did differently was to add kale instead of spinach (my hubby ate all my spinach the night before).  I will definitely make this often!

This is delicious and BETTER than the restaurants because you can load it up with all the goodies.  I use Kale instead of spinach.  Kale stays some what crunchy in the soup which I like.  Everyone I have made this for just goes crazy for it.

Very good mix of ingredients.  We do not like Italian sausage, so I used sliced, spicy smoked sausage sauteed until browned.  I omitted the bacon since the sausage was smoked.  I also added quite a bit more spinach but stuck pretty close to the rest of the ingredients.  It was a hit but next time, I'll use a bit less sausage and add more potatoes and even more spinach.

This recipe is so easy, forgiving, and delicious!  I substituted  bouillon cubes for broth and milk for cream since it was what I had at the time.  I also didn't have spinach so I used collards (it is what I had on hand).  I finely chopped spicy sausages since I didn't have it ground.  The soup was delicious.  Served it with homemade bread and some wine - a perfect meal.  My husband and guests loved it - the guests wanted the recipe.

Good flavors.  I used about 4 potatoes (the amount states sounded like a lot!) and the 4 were plenty.  I used half a package of frozen, chopped spincach which was a great short cut.  I thought this soup was kind of thin.  I ate a bowl and was disappointed.  I took what was leftover, made a slurry with about 3 TBSP of flour and some water and wisked that in and brought the soup back up to a boil.  NOW, it is great soup, just needed some thickening to send it to greatness.  I will make again, thanks for sharing.

The *ahem* italian-chain restaurant's Zuppa Tuscana is my FAVORITE food, and this recipe is a darn near replication of it. The only things I change, to make it more like that soup we know and love, is to use kale instead of spinach (it also holds its shape better and doesn't get slimy like spinach) and double the sausage - because we can:). I've made this many times and it's probably the best recipe I've ever gotten off of this site!

This was AWESOME!  My family had a soup party where everyone brought a different homemade soup and this was definitely a hit.  I used kale instead of spinach, and the bagged bacon bit pieces instead of frying fresh bacon.  It wasn't hard at all, just time a little time consuming.  I'll certainly make this again.

I too subbed kale for the spinach. Next time I will chop the kale smaller and cook in the soup for about five minutes before I add the milk (I used lowfat milk). Made with 3 links of turkey italian sausage - in the casing, cut into very small pieces after cooking - and 3 pieces of turkey bacon, cooked separately and then added to the onion/garlic saute. Used baby red potatoes quartered, they cooked in about ten minutes. It was delish, could have been a little thicker, I might add a little flour next time, or maybe not...

This is the best soup recipie I have ever had!!!

I had to make changes according to what I had at home.

I did not have Chicken broth - so I mixed 10 cups of water with 5 boullion cubes!

I didn't have enough potatoes - but it worked nonetheless.  I had white potatoes, next time I will use Russet - they hold together better when cooked.

I didn't have heavy cream - but used "coffee cream" (I think it's the same thing actually).

No spinach on hand, but had some kale - delish.

It is now our new favorite recipe. Thank you for posting!

Really Good! I used Kale instead of spinach; 1/2# smoked sausage & 1/2# spicy sausage INSTEAD of adding Red Pepper Flakes - plenty of flavor from just the spicy sausage! (and I used the casing sausage instead of bulk sausage; removed casing before frying.), I omitted the bacon; and added about 4 cloves of garlic.  Plenty of Wonderful Flavor!

Wow, fantastic soup!  I made a couple of changes because of what I had here.  I didn't have any Italian sausage so I used some J.D. breakfast sausage and added a little Italian seasoning.  It was great. I used a can less broth and about 2 cups cream and 1/2 cup non-dairy creamer (trick I learned from a popular chowder company -- it tastes great with a lot of cream soups).  I put the spinach on the bottom of the bowls and poured the soup over it -- then added a couple pieces to the top for garnish.  Was delicious!  Thank you, thank you for the killer recipe!

I only liked this soup okay, and I don't think that I will be making it again. I followed the recipe exactly with two exceptions: I used spinach instead of kale, and I used half chicken broth and half water. (I suspected that with the bacon and sausage the soup would taste salty enough with some water in it, and I was right.) It was a bit too spicy for me, and the texture was a bit too thin. (It might be improved by removed the bacon before adding the liquids, cooking the potatoes as instructed, and then removing and pureeing some of the potato/onion/broth/mixture and returning it to the pot to make the whole thing thicker in consistency.)

Seattle had snow today, in April (!) and I decided we needed soup.  Being as we so often have "soup days" here, I make many different kinds.  This one will go to the top of the rotation.  Absolutely wonderful.  Super-delicious, in fact!  I thought the sliced potatoes would be too big but they disolved quite a bit--it was kinda like the potato soup my mom used to make but it had meat in it, which is my men's only requirement for soup.  We liked it so much I made it again two days later to serve for dinner guests.  Wouldn't change a thing, perfect recipe.

This was amazing!!! I used mild Italian sausage so I could control the heat with the red pepper. The amount of red pepper in the recipe with mild sausage was perfect. It still had a kick to it, but it wasn’t too spicy or overpowering. I also used kale instead of spinach. Rave reviews from coworkers and it really does taste just like big chain restaurant! Next time, I will probably remove the bacon after frying and just use some of the grease. They get soggy in the soup.

Excellent recipe for a great soup! I followed the recipe as stated and it turned out two wonderfully! Actually I think it’s probably better than the restaurant soup because it’s homemade!
  What I will do differently next time is use 2 cloves of garlic instead of one.  I did use fresh kale instead of spinach and I also added some instant potato flakes to thicken the soup a little because I like a thicker soup.
  I also used better than bullion to make my broth but only because I didn’t have fresh made broth. Will definitely make again

This is the best Zuppa that I have ever eaten.. I used a full package of baby spinach. I added the small amount as the recipe cited but as I began to finish off the pot of Zuppa I would add another handful and heat it up until wilted. This was an awesome recipe. I did not use as much red pepper flakes as called for since I didn't want it as hot with spice. 
Definitely a keeper recipe and one to share with guest. They'll 
think you're a genius!  ??

Recipe is great as base & modifies well. I did make a few tweaks: it still turned out delish! Used bulk hot Italian sausage, subbed half & half for the cream, used kale-no spinach and lastly no bacon. Soup was stellar on a cold midwest night!

This is my go to soup, it SO delish! I usually make this recipe once a month, as soup is one of my favorites! 
The only modification I make to this recipe is instead of spinach, I use Kale. (Olive Garden uses Kale as well  so that is how I like mine.)

I've made this twice. The first time I made it as is and it was good, but the broth did not give it much flavor. Yesterday I made it again. This time I used 6 cups of chicken stock and as I had no potatoes on hand, I subbed a half box of dried tortellini. It was delicious! I will definitely be making this again.

I have made this numerous times! My family and friends love it and never leave leftovers, even when I double the batch. The 2 things I do different, I use bulk breakfast sausage instead of the Italian and I use Spinach in place of the kale because I'm not a fan, but I don't feel the substitutions take away from this awesome soup! Put together a nice salad and some breadsticks and Boom! Perfection.

Just made another batch of soup! Ive cooked this recipe probably a dozen times and it's always fantastic! I do increase the pepper flakes and use Spicy Italian Sausage for a little more heat! I double or even triple the baby spinach because I love it...I use Low Sodium broth, water & chicken base which helps keep the salt level in check! I dont care for kale and prefer this soup the way it is with spinach. I can literaly make a meal out of just the juice with crusty bread! My family & friends cant get enough of it. It also freezes well..Its delishious thanks again for sharing!

Excellent, very flavorful soup!  I did not use bacon, and subbed kale for the spinach.  Cooked it 4 hours on high in the crockpot, waiting until last 30 minutes before adding in the kale and cream.  Hit the spot on this cold winter day!

I love this recipe and so does my entire family. We usually triple or quadruple this recipe and there is usually only a small bowl leftover. The only change I make is using kale instead of spinach.

This is delicious.  I have made it many times. I have made it with hot Italian sausage and like it even better just leave out the red pepper flakes if doing that.   I cook mine in the oven then slice it up instead of removing the casings.   I have also substituted turkey bacon for regular and can't really taste that much difference.  I usually use Kale.   Use low sodium chicken broth or it gets too salty.  Half the amount of cream is plenty, or even half and half.  Once I used I can of beef broth in place of the chicken and that gave it a little more richness so loved it too.  I always add a bay leaf and a little Italian seasoning and fennel.  If making ahead of time wait and add the cream shortly before serving and don't add the Kale or spinach until about 5 minutes prior to serving.  Oh, I even used deer sausage once and it too was delicious.  This is 5 stars no matter how I have made it.  Serve with a skillet or corn bread. YUM YUM

I made this soup a few days ago, and I followed the recipe pretty much to a T, with the exception of using my own homemade chicken broth, and, of course, using kale in the place of spinach.  There was one review that said you might want to slice the potatoes in two thicknesses, to allow the thinner ones to break down in the broth, and the thicker ones to retain their shape and texture.  I did this and found that even after a few days, I still have pieces of potato in the soup. Good tip! I might also be guilty of a couple extra shakes of the pepper flakes, we like a little zip!  This is the perfect recipe, and I think it's even better than the soup that's served at the restaurant. I don't need to look at any of the others, and will go to this every time I need the Zuppa Toscana fix!

This is absolutely fantastic. Sometimes I make it with spicy sausage to make it really hot. Only thing I change is to use kale instead of spinach since it doesn't wilt into mush, and instead of adding garlic with the onions I wait a little longer so that it doesn't burn.

Made it today and came out so good. So simple and easy but tasty. Like everyobe else i use kale instead and cook bacon supe5 crispy and sprinkle it when ready to eat vs cooking it with the soup. Preferred crispy vs mushy bacon.

Yummmmm..

I absolutely LOVED IT!! I did change it around. I added carrots and broccoli with the potatoes. And instead of regular bacon I used turkey bacon. I also forgot to buy more chicken broth I only have two cans but the rest I just added water. Overall everything was delicious and even my family got seconds! It was my first time soup too!! haha

Great soup! My family really enjoyed it and even complimented the soup (don't always get comments on new recipes). I used fresh Italian sausage from the stores meat counter. Only used 4 potatoes (they were pretty good sized). I didn't use bacon since I didn't have any (plus not a fan of it).  I debated using condensed milk since I have a really good recipe for potato soup using that, but decided against it. (Will try it next time). Did use spinach even though others mentioned kale. The spinach was real good in it. This is one recipe that will be made a lot during the winter months!

Made this as written with the exception of using Hot Italian Sausage and subbing a bag of frozen, chopped kale for the spinach.  It is DELICIOUS!  It's spicy but don't let that stop you from making it as the spice is easy to adjust.  Thank you for this great recipe!!
3/4/2019  I've been making this soup for years.  Seriously, if you haven't made this soup, you've got to give it a try.  EVERYONE loves it.

I have made this recipe with changes. The original recipe did not call for bacon so I will save that for my other meals. I use Johnsonville Hot Italian sausage because I want the flavor of the sausage especially when it is mixed with heavy cream. I am not a big fan of any green veggies but Kale works nicely in this dish. I added a few more potatoes and smashed a few on the side to thicken the soup. Since I am using Hot Italians, I don't need to add any hot pepper flakes and I only use Chicken broth that is low sodium. I don't make this often but when I do, I want it to taste just like it should. Since it costs $6-7 to buy a cup of this at the restaurant, I make sure that when I get a hankering to eat it, I make my own.  I would love to freeze some of it but I find that when I freeze Italian Sausage, it loses its flavor. My new bummer.

Great. Even my husband, who doesn't like soup, enjoyed this. I used kale instead of spinach. I also used only 4 14.5 oz cans of chicken broth, because that's all I could fit in my pot. In the future, I will probably use one less potato.

This was amazing and much better than the restaurant soup! I did rinse the sausage after browning so that my soup did not turn orange. I also used kale instead of spinach.  Kale is a bit hardier and does not get mushy.

Read many reviews and made adaptations of using kale, adding celery, carrot strips and mushrooms, even half & half.  I also tried tip of using balsamic vinegar and vanilla for flavor.  It's not bad...just ok.  I'm curious about honey's vote after tasting, and believe that it'll likely be better tomorrow and in the next few days after sitting.  Certainly not a total waste of time...just not as tasty and flavorful as I hoped it would be.

The only changes I make are to use 7 1/2 cups broth and one cup water. I also opt for fat-free half and half instead of the heavy cream just to make slightly healthier. This is one of my favorite thing to make in the dutch oven.

I've been making this for years, but I never constructed it like this before.. better then the way I used to do it. I omitted the bacon and used kale instead of the spinach. I was out of crushed red pepper so I used a sprinkle of cayane pepper and a sprinkle of white pepper. I also used hot Italian sausage. I like it spicy. For those of you with a poor review.. I beg you to make the changes you need to make this work for you and try it again...So good!!

This is so great!!  I make it frequently.  Kids love it and is saves me a trip to the restaurant.  I only made 2 changes: 1) Spicy italian sausage instead of regular sausage/red pepper flakes ; 2) Kale instead of spinach.  Kale holds up better in the soup, esp when reheating.

I did not change much to the recipe. I normally will try to cut fat in recipes if it is saturated, such as meat and dairy. I used a hot Italian Turkey Sausage instead of pork and used fat free half and half instead of heavy cream. Everything else was the same. I liked the flavor, but found it really thin. We prefer creamier soups. First, I added grated Parmesan cheese in hopes of thickening it up. I ended up adding a can of cream of chicken soup. This worked and gave it a nice creamy base. I have a feeling this may be one of those dishes that taste even better the next day. If I made this again, I would try adding less chicken broth and more half and half.

This recipe was such a hit, the kind of meal where everyone goes back for seconds. Paired wonderfully with warm crusty bread. Followed the advice from other reviews, and rinsed the sausage off before adding to the soup so that it didn't stain orange. This recipe as directed is hearty, deliciously spicy and creamy. Leftovers the next day were even better. My new favourite soup!

EXCELLENT! Love love this recipe. Would only change one thing and that is use less or no red pepper flakes. It was still excellent was just a little too spicy for my family. I think it taste almost identical to the restaurant recipe. Oh and I used kale instead of spinach!!

My husband and I really liked this recipe and my husband doesn't typically like soup. We made it almost as the recipe stated. We thinly sliced up the fresh spinach and added our desired amount to our bowls and crumbled bacon on top. The bacon on top added a nice crunch to the texture. We made it a second time and substituted the italian sausage and spinach with chorizo and kale and that was, dare I say, even better. We also only added the bacon on top the second time, omitted the red pepper flakes and made sure to let the kale cook down for about 30 minutes. We will definitely use this recipe again.
(Chorizo tends to be really greasy, so drain off the excess grease)

Make this soup now!!! Soooo delicious! I followed the recipe except for using kale instead of spinach (that's what the famous restaurant uses!) and added the kale about 6-7 minutes from the potatoes being done, before adding the sausage and cream into the pot. I used 6 small/medium sized red potatoes and took another reviewer's suggestion to cut a couple of them thinner than the others. This allows the thin ones to break apart and help thicken the soup, while the thicker ones hold their shape. Very quick and easy to do with a mandolin slicer. I thought the seasonings were perfect. No need to make changes! If you don't want your soup to turn orange, give the cooked sausage a quick rinse under very hot water to remove the excess fat. A keeper!

Good, but needed some help. This makes a LOT of soup, so unless you have a lot of people eating it, I suggest cutting back. I made about a half batch. I don't really measure much, either. I used about a half pound of Jimmy Dean hot sausage, 2 strips of bacon, and half an onion.I follow the recipe except I don't use garlic and I don't add the bacon into the soup. I add whatever broth (homemade) I have on hand and add water to make 4 cups of liquid. It's usually about half and half. I also add the red pepper flakes here as well as garlic powder (since I don't keep real garlic on hand) salt and pepper from a grinder, and whatever else smells good from the spice cabinet (usually cayenne pepper, paprika, stuff like that). As for the potatoes, I use 2 large russets. Leave the skin on, cut them in half and half again lengthwise. I cut them about a quarter inch thick, some thinner to help thicken the broth, and add them in. I bring it all to a boil rather than bringing it to a boil THEN adding the potatoes. I let it simmer down for about 10-15 minutes after they're done to thicken it up. I add half a cup of cream and a good amount of kale, rather than spinach. I've used spinach and it turns to mush on me. After it's reheated to almost a boil, I serve it and crumble the bacon over top of it with some parmesan. Sooo yummy. It usually makes 3-4 servings. Since it's only 2 people that eat it in my house, including me, there are leftovers and they reheat well.

I used kale, instead of spinach since that is what's in the OG version...Also, I made mine chunkier by adding more sausage and diced potatoes. Another reviewer suggested rinsing the italian sausage in very hot water--that was a great idea! Hardly any greasy film! I will definitely be making this again.

We love this soup.  I do add a half package of herb and garlic soup mix for a little extra savory flavor, and I also use a spicy sausage.  I add the spinach at the end, or leave that optional for non spinach eaters.  My son asks "can you fix THAT soup tonight?"  He has also asked that I fix it for his boss who loves soup.

I had never used kale successfully.  Now I can't make this soup enough.  I made it just like the recipe and it will certainly deserve 5 stars.  My husband says I should start a business, however, I think somebody already has!  Thanks for sharing.

Couldn't have enough of this soup on chilly winter day-that is how delicious it was....
Omitted bacon and used yams instead of regular potatoes...
Thanks for great recipe!

This was AMAZING! I will definitely be adding this to my normal rotation. I did however make a few adjustments. I used reduced sodium chicken broth based on other feedback and added salt to taste. I used four large russet potatoes instead of six. Used spicy Italian sausage instead and added less red pepper flakes. I also used Kale instead of spinach and omitted the bacon because I didn't need the extra calories. Will definitely be making again!

So good!!  I used bacon fat to sauté the onions and garlic, but no bacon. I also used chicken sausage and kale. I only sliced two large potatoes because I felt it would be enough, but it wasn't. I'll probably do four potatoes next time. Flavorful. The whole family liked it.

O.M.G.  This meal has become our households favorite!  The only thing I change is Kale for spinach.  I tried a less fat version by putting low fat milk rather than cream...nope,  so I have done a low fat milk with butter and flour rue instead and that works..but the cream really is best. Half and half also works.  Sooooooooooo delicious!  Best recipe I have ever had on this site!

I really liked this, but hubs and daughter allowed me to eat the leftovers alone. Maybe a little too spicy for them; will try to tone it down next time, perhaps with regular sausage.

I absolutely loved this! Better than the restaurant's version! My tweaks, used turkey bacon (less fat and sodium), added fennel seed (1 TBS), used 2 large cans of chicken broth (48oz) (this makes the proportion to the potatoes and sausage perfect for me, plus tons of leftovers for freezing), doubled the garlic, and substituted kale for spinach. I will say I only added the Kale to each bowl before serving because the first time I made it, the kale was a bit mushy with leftovers. This way it's perfect every time!

Great soup!  I used closer to 1/4c of minced garlic (we love garlic!) and about 3T butter in place of the bacon (we don't love bacon :P).  I sliced the potatoes nearly paper thin with my mandolin, took the pot off the burner while they were not quite done and allowed the soup to mellow for about an hour before reheating slightly and adding the spinach.  Served with some freshly ground pepper and parmesan reggiano on top, the only other thing this soup needed was a crusty french bread for wiping our bowls clean!

We made this and threw in some carrots because we like carrots in our soups.  We browned the hot sausage and onions in the pressure cooker, added the broth, garlic, spinach, potatoes and carrots and cooked on high pressure for 7 minutes.  I forgot about the bacon by accident.  When the pressure cooker was done, released the pressure and added the light cream (all we had in the house) to it.  Absolutely delicious!

This is indeed super delicious!  I accidentally bought sweet Italian sausage, so I upped the crushed red pepper a bit.  I also replaced the spinach with kale, just because I had some extra kale lying around.  I used my own canned broth, which is salt-free, so I added a pinch of salt and also a bit of pepper.  I also ended up adding another cup of cream, because kale does not wilt and cook down as much as spinach, and I wanted it a bit more...soupy.  This is AMAZING!  My whole family loved it, and already an argument has broken out over who gets the leftovers!  Needless to say, this will be a staple here.  Next time I will try it as written- with the regular sausage and the spinach.  I also think spicy sausage would be excellent in this.  Thanks for sharing souporsweets :)

As one other had posted, I used kale instead of spinach, add 1 teaspoon of fennel, and leave out the red pepper.  It was really good and my PICKY KIDS wanted seconds!  There was NONE left!  I will be making this again FOR SURE!

This recipe was just as good, if not better than the restaurant's version. The only alteration I made was to add the sausage in with the bacon and onion mixture after cooking to allow the chicken broth to be infused with the sausage taste. I though it was awesome! Thank you for a great recipe.

Really nice flavor, and very satisfying - really delicious served with some crusty rustic bread.  My husband prepared the recipe exactly as directed, but we did have very spicy Italian Sausage - so it had a very nice kick to it.  Next time I make this, I will omit the bacon because I don't like the texture of gloopy bacon.  I will also try to reduce the fat by using italian turkey sausage and whole milk instead of heavy cream.

This was PHENOMENAL! I love Olive Gardens Zuppa Toscana. I was set on finding a recipe just like it so I could eat it right from home, needless to say, this is it! I LOVED it! Plus, It doesn't need any modifications! (Unless you like very spicy food, which we do, I used hot Italian sausage and it was the perfect level of spice. ) I will definitely continue to make this recipe thru the years to come!

The kids beg for this delicious soup. This has become a family favorite! I use kale instead of spinach and add a touch of bacon fat instead of bacon, otherwise I leave it the same.

Tastes just like the restaurant - although I didn't notice until after I bought the ingredients that I should have used kale instead of spinach, it tasted just great!

I also use Kale in my recipe. I think everyone is forgetting something very important, try garnishing with parmesan cheese. It really adds that extra wow and you will never forget this finishing touch.

Really enjoyed this, but giving it 4 stars because my husband didn't like it as much. Bet it was just my choice of sausage though.

So delicious! I too used kale instead of spinach. I used whole milk instead of cream because cream upsets our stomachs. The soup was the perfect consistency for us. I served with Texas toast garlic bread. I will certainly make this again and again.

This was OK, but not great.  We've enjoyed other Zuppa Toscana recipes from allrecipes much more.

The bacon had that unappealing soggy texture after being in the pot for 30 minutes.  Soup was not creamy or spicy enough for us.

This is SO good and one of my favorite recipes on this site! I've never had the chain version but I don't need to after having this. I think this serves a few more than 6 though as described above. I've got a Dutch Oven full of the stuff so these would be 6 very large servings. Good to freeze too which is nice! The quality of this soup is going to depend on the quality of your ingredients. Buy top end sausage from a butcher rather than the commercial stuff in the standard supermarket meat case. Don't buy cheap bacon....buy some thick dry rub cut varieties! I would recommend skimming the fat off the top of the soup to keep it creamier looking (and a tiny bit healthier).

This tastes just like the restaurant version!  Very spicey, so if you like your soup a bit more mild, leave out the red pepper flakes.  I used the spinach, as per the recipe.  I used 6 large russet potatoes, and had to add another can of broth.  It made way more than 6 servings, I'd say more like 10, and it heats up well.  I decided to dice my potatoes so that they would stay together, instead of fall apart in the soup.  A definate keeper.

I love this soup! Tried it at Olive Garden and now crave it often. I did add salt and pepper to taste and left out the kale. It was perfect.

Used mild and hot Italian sausage. Both kale and spinach. Yukon potatoes with skins on. Half and half...delicious with Parkerhouse rolls! This is one recipe I didn't mess up! :)

I have made this time and time again, and people still request it at least once a week!  It's been popular with my husband, my nursing class (80% Mexican), and the wide variety of international guests that stay at our house.  The only change I make us substituting kale (stems removed) for spinach, and adding the kale about 5 min. before serving so it can soften.

Very good with some adjustments, although heartburn-inducing as written. I suggest using high quality sausage only and really squeezing out any excess fat, as well as leaving out the bacon. Seriously, it will still be hearty. I also used milk instead of cream and used the whole bunch spinach. Also double the garlic, as always.

This is one delicious soup. Only thing I did different was use skim milk instead of cream. I don't use cream unless I just have to an a recipe. I just loved it, and I will be making it again soon.

Super-Delicious is the correct name for this recipe.  It was every bit as good, if not better than the popular Italian restaurant.  I made it as written, using sweet Italian sausage rather than mild.  Everyone thoroughly enjoyed this the first night.  I took the leftovers in to work for them to enjoy it also and it received rave reviews.  This will most definitely go in to my cold weather recipe rotation.

Very tasty! Our mouths were on fire after each bite though so I may decrease the red pepper flakes by 1/2.  Also used regular milk w/4 tbsp of cornstarch instead of heavy cream and still turned out thick and creamy.  I used 4 large red-skinned potatoes and that was plenty.  Will definitely make again!

This soup was awesome! The only changes I made were not adding the red pepper and using frozen spinach instead of fresh. I did not thicken up the way some reviewers said but it was still delicious! It's great for leftovers, too. If you're looking for a light meal, this is it. I will definitely make it again!

We cooked ours differently, on the stove top. It was very good. It is a little oily (from the sausage) & am going to try to figure out how to cut down on that for next time but this is definitely going to be something we do again!

Used spicy Italian sausage, omitted the bacon, used beef broth instead of chicken, and kale instead of spinach. I cut the amount of potatoes to only 3 and put 2 cups of sliced carrots in its place. I took the advice of another reviewer and added ground fennel. It was delicious!

I made a triple batch of this for a large gathering. It was a soup salad event. There were 4 soups total and this was the only one that was scraped clean out of the pot! I actually didnt have bacon so I added a spash of liquid smoke and you would never know! I had so many rave reviews and had to share the recipe over 4 times! I spent a ton of money at the restaurant that makes this just for this soup, now I dont have to. Yay! No more wasting money. I can feed ten people for the cost of one trip easily. Thanks

I omitted the bacon and don't think it made a difference in flavor. The sausage gives it plenty of flavor! I simmered it on low and periodically skimmed off the fat on top.

I used low-sodium chicken broth and substituted the cream for 1 cup of milk instead and it was still creamy and tasty. If I had wanted even more broth, I would have just added more milk.

I wasn't sure how much kale to substitute for at first. You really need only about a stalk or two, with the leaves torn off into small pieces.  To be honest, the ratio of ingredients to stock isn't really proportional (ie: there's a lottt of ingredients compared to the amount of broth), but I was afraid to add water for fear of taking away the flavor.

Next time, I'd cut the sausage in half - 1/2 a pound is plenty (but according to the hubby, I should keep it at a full pound, so we'll see. He also thought the ratio of ingredients to broth was fine - apparently at unnamed restaurant, it's supposed to be heavier on the ingredients side than broth). I think I could have gotten away with using a "lighter" sausage - I might try using turkey sausage next time.

Absolutely fabulous recipe that totally deserves five stars!  My boyfriend loved it and it was hearty enough for the main course.  The only change was to sub kale for spinach!  This is a delicious "meaty" soup that is much appreciated by carnivores!

Couldn't be happier with the way this soup turned out!  I followed everything to the T and the only change i'll make next time is 1/2 pd of sausage and maybe one less or smaller potatoes.  It is a delicious easy recipe which my hubby and I ate up quickly.

Wow! It turned out great! It was easy to make with only a few steps. I used 4 potatoes (2 thinly sliced and 2 thick sliced) as others suggested. I used 1 cup milk mixed with 3 tablespoons of starch instead of the heavy cream. I used hot Italian sausage and did not add the red pepper. All these changes were suggested by others reviews, thank you!

This recipe is a winner every time. Even my kids, who are usually very picky, empty the pot. I know some folks have suggested changes here and there but this recipe is top notch just as it is.

This was fantastic!  I don't eat pork so I used smoked salmon and field roast Italian sausage instead and it was fantastic!! I sauteed a little rosemary, thyme, basil, oregano, and pepper flakes before adding the onions.  Also, I was all out of spinach so I added green beans and corn.

Better than Olive Garden's! I followed other recommendations to substitute kale for spinach. I also prefer using Jimmy Dean regular sausage roll instead of ground sausage. It's a little more effort but more than worth it for the finished product.

used turkey sausage and low fat evaporated milk to cut down on the calories and added crushed fennel seeds as another reviewer recommended. wound up needing to add cornstarch to thicken but the flavor was absolutely on the money! ive never been to OG to have this but had it as a guest at someone's house and have been craving ever since -abso friggin lutely delish! and fairly inexpensive. May pair with a nice bread from panera and call it a day!

Really yummy!  I used Kale instead of spinach and only use 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes.  I also used homemade turkey stock instead of the chicken broth.  I probably also used less liquid. Will be making this again.

I love the zuppa toscana served at olive garden, so I was excited to give this recipe a try.   Loved it!!  It is prepared with spinach, nice!!  I made it with red potatoes and not in a Dutch oven...  It turned out pretty nice.  I will definitely make it again!!

Excellent flavor but a bit thin.  I added some cornstarch mixed with a bit of chicken broth and that thickened it up nicely.  I didn't have cream so I used 1/2 & 1/2, that may have been the problem with thickening.  Also, I just added about 1/4 package of frozen chopped spinach instead of the fresh and that worked out just fine.  I'll make this again for sure.  Thanks for posting your recipe souporsweets!

Made this tonight and DH was ecstatic! I followed the recipe exactly (but used frozen spinach instead of fresh). So delicious! Will add this soup to my line-up .. maybe I'll try kale next time, but other than that, I wouldn't change a thing.

After having saved his recipe for so long, and with so many rave reviews, I am so very disappointed with the results.  The soup, while quite interesting, was thin and in our opinion, in need of something more.

Excellent soup!  I only had 2% milk instead of heavy cream.  I used a dollop of sour cream and a dusting of parmesan cheese for garnish.  It was rich, mildly spicey and delicious!

This tasted exactly like that Italian chain restaurants!   So Yummy!   I used Kale instead of spinach and chopped up the Kale and let each individual put in as much as they wanted so it wouldn't get mushy.   Most delicious soup!

Delicious - I have made this soup twice and both times we devoured it.

The changes I made were as follows.  I used 4 potatoes and added spanish rice. 

I will make this again and again.

This soup was fantastic. I added an entire bag of spinach because I really like spinach, but stuck to the recipe otherwise. It is yummy and filling enough to be a meal.

I used kale instead of spinach, added them after potatoes cooked for 10 mins.  Used turkey sausage but pork bacon.  And used 1/2 c. heavy cream and 1/2 c. milk.  Also added parmesan right before eating-to each individual bowl...yum!!

This soup was fantastic!  I used hot turkey sausage and turkey bacon to lower the fat content.  Also used 1/2 c. half and half and 1/2 c. milk.  As others suggested, I also used kale in place of the spinach.  I only used 2 large potatos, this was more than enough.  And next time I would use 1 or 2 cans of lower sodium chicken broth.  It was a little too salty even for me.. a true salt lover!   I wish I could say how well it did after freezing it but there was nothing left to freeze!  Delish!!

Delicious!! the only thing i do different is that i add double the heavy cream. i've given this recipe to family members and they try to do it differently trying to make it better, but they have failed. i recommend to keep it as it is.

This is a great base for a soup recipe.  I made it much meater but healthier at the same time.  I used 1.5 lbs of bulk spicy chicken sausage and double the bacon but used uncured from Whole Foods.  The fat and cholesterol is much lower.  a 16oz serving comes to 270 cal and only 7g of fat.  I also used fingerling potatos and a red onion.

I just made this soup for the 3rd time.....It is SOOOOOO GOOD!  And definitely very filling!!!!!  I used a couple more slices of bacon (because I like it : )  ) and used the milk/cornstarch mixture because I just can't see spending the extra $$ on heavy cream but everything else stayed the same.  You've GOT to try it!

This is absolutely wonderful.  I didn't change much, only that I used turkey sausage and ditalini pasta instead of potatoes b/c I don't care for potato.  The flavor is so bold and delicious.  I sprinkled fresh shaved parmesan on top and served with bread and salad.

Took longer to prepare than recipe stated. My husband said it was better than good, but not great; same with my teenaged sons.  Followed recipe exactly.  Probably won't be making again.

My family liked this soup and asked me to keep the recipe (a good sign at our house).  I used spicy turkey Italian sausage, omitted the red pepper flakes, and used a combo of cauliflower and potatoes.  Instead of heavy cream, I used half and half and couldn't imagine it being any better.

I used hot italian sausage and omitted the red pepper flakes as some other reviews suggested, and totally regretted it! I had to add a lot of cracked black pepper at then end to get the heat I wanted. 

I also omitted the heavy cream because my bf is lactose intolerant. I didn't miss it!

So good! I followed another person's advice and drained the sausage and patted it dry to cut down on the grease. I also used milk and cornstarch in place of cream and used kale instead of spinach, although I think either would be great in it! Will definitely be making again!

Just like Olive Garden! I used only 4 Russet potatoes, but I would use 6 the next time. I also used 1/2# Bob Evans Italian sausage. 1 # would be good too. Perfect as written, but I prefer Kale instead of spinach. It holds up better.

My husband absolutely loves this recipe!  Hint: using a mandolin for the potatoes is a huge time-saver!  I used this recipe to enter a fund-raising soup competition at school (it was called "Souper-Bowl," isn't that cute?) and won first place!  I guess you can now literally call this a "prize-winning" recipe!

We absolutely love this soup!  I double the recipe and there are no leftovers!  It is simple and quick and OH SO GOOD!  We do add salt and use soy milk instead of cream.  (milk allergies)  One of our favorite dishes!

Wow! This is better than the Zuppa Toscana at Italian restaurants! I used small container of lowfat sour cream instead of cream and an entire cabbage instead of spinach. It served more like 10, so yay for leftovers!!!

I have a tendency to never rate a recipe unless I really liked it.  This one has to be one of my absolute favorites from this site though.  The only change that I made was only using 1 t red pepper flakes and I used kale instead of spinach, which added a really nice texture and flavor.  You should try this one!

This was a delicious soup.  Great on a cold winter day.  I eliminated the bacon as it's not one of my favorites.  I made a rux beore adding the spinach to thicken the broth.  The soup was great but the next day when the potatoes had thickened the broth, it was awesome.  I will try and add some small white navy beans next time and maybe not need the rux.  The whole family loved it.  Thanks, this ones a keeper.

This was sensational.  I used turkey italian sausage but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter.  Excellent flavor and was even better the next day.

Thought that this was VERY Good. Made as few changes as I was able to. The soup turned out extremely salty the way I made it.... Otherwise, it would have been truly excellent. We always use Better Than Bouillon for soup stocks. It would have been much better to have used a low sodium broth or stock. Also, I used fresh Italian Sausage from the local grocery that has always seemed a little salty. A lower sodium sausage would also have been much better. The recipe shows only 6 servings but should serve many more. I doubled the recipe to have leftovers and wished that I had made only a single batch. We will DEFINITELY have this again as the whole family loved it. I'll just try to lower the salt content a little next time.

This soup was AMAZING!!!!  I used hot turkey italian sausage, omittied the bacon altogether and used half & half instead of the cream.  Yummy!  Hubby even loved it and he's not a big soup eater.  Try this one out, it's a winner!!  Enjoy!

This is really good. Followed the recipe except for the onions as I am allergic to them added onion powder instead. The soup has really good flavor but was to thin for me so I added some cornstarch to thicken it up some.

This is one of my husband and my favorite soups. We, however, use kale, not spinach. My husband says it's even better than the Olive Garden version.

It was an alright soup. A little bland though. I changed mine up by adding breadcrumbs for thickness at the end and parsley. It needs more "oomph".

I made this recipe just as written, excpet I did use the kale.  This is so good!!  I brought it to soup and sandwich day at church.  It was a huge hit and got many compliments.  Next time I will use the hot sausage, just because I like spicy food.  Yum!

Simply amazing.  My whole family loves this soup.  We found a full pound of sausage to be too much and I also omit the bacon.  It is still very hearty and flavorful but it makes the soup much lighter and less greasy.  Everyone who tastes this soup raves about it.  Try it, it's a winner.

This soup is amazing!  If you love the one that the Olive Garden makes, then rest assured that this one is even more delicious.  The only change I make is I use an entire (small) package of bacon, which is 6-7 slices.  Who doesn't love more bacon, right?!  Slice your potatoes nice and thin so they crumble up after they cook.  Also, use a high-quality sausage... it really does make a difference.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

AMAZING! I followed the recipe but instead of spinach I used kale, and I added shredded chicken from a rotissere and some cannelini beans. It might be the best thing I've made in a long time. I would strongly suggest you make it. :)

Amazing! Just one thing was missing: fresh grated Parmesan like at the restaurant! It was perfect with that small addition (and only four regular sized potatoes, sub kale in for spinach, too).

very good soup, i had chx italian sausage on hand, disagree with all those who say use less potatoes, very hardy filling soup.  Thinking i will put a can of great northern beans in it next time, carrots would also be a nice addition.  But great just the way it is.  Thanks for the recipe

This is the nest soup on a snowy/rainy day. It really warms you up. I followed the recipe, but added more bacon. I recomend using pre cooked bacon (the entire package). It helps with the flavor but keep it from being too hearty of a dish.

This soup was yummy, it's a must try!  I followed the recipe exactly but next time will make a couple of changes.  As many others have suggested, kale would be better than spinach.  The spinach just didn't give it any texture or taste.  I also thought the soup was too runny.  Next time I will use less chicken broth & maybe even some corn starch to thicken it up.

Enjoyed this on a cool rainy night! Made many of the modifications recommended--no bacon, half & half instead of cream, and kale instead of spinach. Also as recommended I used fewer potatoes (4 vs. 6), though I thought it needed more. And a lb of sausage was about right (maybe add a little more of this too).

My husband is a huge fan of this soup at the chain restaurants.  This recipe is an amazing replica!  We were very happy to find it, and it's going to be in our regular rotation of meals!

Absolutely excellent!  I made the recipe exactly as stated and it turned out delish!  For those who had trouble with the milk clumping, the key is wisking thoroughly as you slowly pour it into the hot soup.

This is going to become a regular at my house for sure. I had to adapt this to what I had on hand.... I used ground turkey (seasoned w/ fennel seeds, red pepper flakes, cumin, sage, margoram, onion and garlic powder so it would taste like sausage), I used half the amount of chicken stock andabout 3 cups of fat free milk (plus 1/4 cup of corn starch) in place of the heavy cream. I also left out the bacon and only used 2 potatos I cubed. This was good with some parmesan cheese on top. Thanks for sharing!

Fabulous.  I did 150% of the meat (sausage & bacon) and used slightly less water.  Made my broth using boulion cubes.  Used Kale instead of spinach.  Used a little extra of the bacon grease.

I am very impressed with this soup.  The flavor is fantastic and it is pretty....the only thing that I discovered is that it needs to be served immediately.  It does not keep well, nor re-heat well.....the potatoes fall apart and it will separate on you.....but fantastic all the same!  Makes a ton!

Oh my, I put the soup together this morning so it would be ready for our early dinner tonight. It tastes so good I was temptd to have it for breakfast! Lovely... you'll laugh, but I had to thin my row beet sprouts, so I used some of the young beet greens rather than spinach or kale. It's really good!

I love this recipe...the only thing I changed was I used 1/3 cup onions and 3 leeks ( use just the white part) it gives the soup a more subtle taste of onions and really brings out the flavor. Instead of spinach I used kale and followed the same directions. Also to if you can find butter potatoes (the brand I use is Mountain King Butter Potatoes) try them instead of regular potatoes.

The Italian grandmother of an old friend used to make a soup like this, but sh used escarole instead of the spinach. She also beat an raw egg into it. Delicioso!

WOW! This is way better than the chain soup. I made before work one day and brought it in for everyone in a crockpot. People couldn't get enough! Slicing the potatoes in a food processor and chopping the onion in a food processor made this a quick recipe. I used a 1 lb. sausage roll, which was very good. (had one in the freezer) Heavy cream as well as milk with cornstarch (as suggested by another review) made the consistancy excellent. For the bacon, I had the bag of chopped, cooked bacon - so that was handy and less fatty.  Served with french bread, salad. This is a keeper!!

Excellent! This recipe rocks!!! To make a little healthier I did substitute ground turkey for the sausage and replace the cream with non-fat milk. Due to time issues, I cooked all the ingredients as directed (but a little less time) and then threw ingredients into a slowcooker and placed on low. This was great because it was hot and ready when we finally had time to eat. Just before serving I added 1/3C heavy cream and 2/3C non-fat milk and fresh spinach. It was met with great reviews from everyone in the family! Thanks for Sharing!

This was so great!  I typically don't follow directions on these exactly, so I made a few changes.  I used turkey sausage, no bacon, and almond milk instead of cream.  I used russet potatoes, and they only took 10 minutes or less to cook.  I had sliced them 1/4 inch thick.  When I added baby spinach at the end I didn't get rid of the stems, but tore them up before I added them.

I love this soup, it's one of my all time favorites.  Like other reviewers, I found the spinach too delicate for this hearty soup. And since I'm from the South, I substituted frozen chopped collard greens that I had on hand.  Added great flavor.

Used hot italian sausage instead of the mild/pepper mix and subbed kale for the spinach. If you want praise for your cooking, make a batch of this and share! Im so glad I tried this recipe. I will most certainly make this again (and again and again...)

Yummy! If you're like me and can't afford all the calories that come in the original recipe, you might want to try my changes to "lighten it up".... I skipped the bacon altogether and used milk instead of heavy cream... still delicious! Oh, and definitely use kale instead of spinach. It's a keeper! Thanks souporsweets!

This was the first soup I ever tried making. I decided to go for it because I love the one at the OG so much!! I used Kale as well, but everything else was the same (except no crushed red peppers). I cooked it in a big pot on the stove in the order recommended and it turned out GREAT!! I will DEFINATELY cook this soup again!

Made twice. Really enjoyed. Added salt and pepper, used Kale and 4 potatoes and instead of 1 & 1/4 tsp of crushed red pepper, I just used 1 tsp and added mild rotel tomatoes(on second try and really enjoyed it, I like it spices). Also added a rue to thicken.  Dont forget the parmesan cheese! Thanks a bunch!!!

This soup is amazing, but I would never make this with spinach! Kale is a must in this recipe. I've been making similar recipes for 6 years. The texture and flavor of kale are perfect here, if you've never had it, think romaine lettuce mixed with parsley. Also needed a bit of salt and parmesan cheese for my taste. This might be due to the fact that I crumble the bacon and add it in with the sausage so it's not all mushy in the soup. I always use hot Italian sausage, the flavor is better to me. I still add the pepper flakes. We live in a spicy household! I would give it a 5 except the broth did need a flavor kick with the salt and parm, and the lack of KALE!

This came out well - although there was only 1/2 pound turkey sausage in my freezer which crumbled well after removing the casing. The second change I made was 8 slices bacon, cut into  pieces - because the chicken broth was salt free. If I make this again, I'll dice the potatoes - the thin slices were hard to eat with a spoon. The third change was to use a cup of fat free half and half.  Thanks for sharing.

This soup is fantastic.  I made some changes to make it Weigh Watcher's friendly and it was great.  I love the original version at Olive Garden (I had a roommate in college who worked there and would bring some home for me a couple of times a week) and it was super close!  The changes I made were: I used Jennie-O Italian Seasoned Ground Turkey instead of italian sausage (I also added a bit of fennel seed to give it more of an italian sausage flavor), I also subbed a 50/50 mix of fat free evaporated milk and fat free milk instead of the heavy whipping cream, reduced sodium chicken broth, Jennie-O Extra Lean Turkey Bacon and I used flat leaf parsley instead of spinach because thats what I had on hand.  It was fabulous and 4 points a serving for any other WW's out there!

Very, very good.  I don't like potatoes, especially in soup where they just get mushy, so I substituted with a 1/2 lb of bow tie pasta.  It was delicious and received rave reviews from my guests.

This soup if really good.  I've never eaten it at the OG, just wanted to try something different and comforting since we're actually having some cold weather down on the Gulf Coast.  I followed the recipe - just added fresh mushrooms and celery when cooking the onions, and used cauliflower instead of potatoes to keep it lower in carbs.  Can't wait to make some for my brother-in-law.  He's a food critic - I know he'll love it!

This is an EXCELLENT version of the "famous" one!  I used hot Italian sausage and 1 cup of skim evaporated milk instead of cream.  It made our whole house smell delicious!  I'm making this for guests next time.

I love this soup at "that restaurant", it is just like it. Kale is definitely the way to go. What really surprised me was the chicken broth. That is what provides the flavor the restaurant has. Perfect for cold Michigan winters.

Left out bacon & red pepper, used spicy sausage and kale. Also used half & half instead of heavy cream. Thought it was a bit salty, but still good. I would use less sausage next time.

This soup is fantastic!  I followed the recipe with one exception-I used kale instead of spinach.  I also found that 3 russet potatoes were plenty (instead of the recommended 5).  Will be making this over and over again.  Tastes just like the famous restaurant soup!

Very tasty!!! I've never had this soup at any other italian restaurant, so now I'm curious. Is this better than theirs? Hard to imagine! Followed the recipe, except used hot italian sausage and no red pepper. I think next time I'll add the whole bunch of kale.

this soup was wonderful...I followed the recipe exactly.  The soup was a little greasy even though I drained the sausage on paper towels so maybe next time I'll try it with turkey sausage.  It wasn't too spicy at all.  I used baby spinach and I would probably substitute kale if I could find it but spinach was good too.  The sliced potatoes were beautiful but hard to eat with a spoon so I will cut into smaller pieces next time as well.  Thank you for the delicious recipe

Unbelievably delicious.  I followed the recipe very closely but used chicken sausage and subbed kale for the spinach and used a full bunch instead of 1/4.   We did need to salt to taste.  It was better than the chain restaurant's version, and probably much healthier!  Will make it again and again.

Lol I had a heck of a time making this.  I set the smoke detectors off twice.... but once it was all done, it tasted great.  I didn't have kale or spinach though, but I think there's enough in the soup without it.  I also used hot sausage AND red pepper flakes because I like my soup spicy.  Best of all, no more going to Olive Garden for this.  Thanks so much for posting it.  Love it.

We like it mild, so I skipped the red pepper flakes. I also subbed milk for the heavy cream and kale for the spinach, and we absolutely LOVED it! It makes a ton, but freezes well to take to work for lunch. Deeee-lish!

This is sooooo good. I made a healthier version by using chicken sausage and turkey bacon, and it still tasted great. The texture of the turkey bacon wasn't as good as regular bacon, but it still had a great flavor. If you like a thicker soup, use more potato, but the consistency we got from following the recipe was just like the restaurant version. Yum!

I started getting this from Olive Garden while pregnant and became obsessed!  Now that I've moved to the country and it's quite a drive to the restaurant, I was delighted to find this recipe!  I actually prefer it.  Not sure if it's the recipe since I use the basic ingredients and kind of wing it on measurements or the fact that I can enjoy it from home but either way, it's absolutely amazing.  I have 4 small children and they all LOVE this soup.  I leave out the red pepper and add to individual bowls for my husband and myself.

This was really good! I used red onion, hot italian sausage -- eliminated the red pepper flakes, and chose to go with kale. I also added the tsp. of fennel, which I think really helped give it some additional dimension to flavor. It was a big hit with everyone! I will definitely be making this again.

Very easy, packs a lot of flavor.  Everyone in my family enjoyed this soup.  It was a nice treat on a crisp fall night.  I pretty much followed the recipe (subbed turkey sausage for the pork) and I thought the measurements and ingredients were pretty spot on.  It is an easy soup though to add or subtract things you don't like.  This will be on our winter soup rotation for sure!

Very tasty. I used turkey bacon and soymilk substitutes, and they both worked well. Recommend!

Followed recipe as written except used turkey sausage instead of pork. Amazing flavor combination. My hubby and I both rate this a 10+ and will make it again and again...

It was awesome!  I took the advice and used kale instead of spinach and was happy with it. I used crushed up chiltipin peppers from the garden for my red pepper flakes which are SUPER spicy.  Yummy!

This was brothier and a little less creamy than I was hoping for. Also, I would probably use on about 3/4 lb sausage next time, as it was a little overwhelming. Otherwise, it was good.

"Better than Oliver's Garden!" said my mother. It was really tasty. I cut back on calories with half and half and it was still perfect. Can see myself making this many more times.

I made this pretty much as written. I didn't use canned broth so I sort of guessed how much to use; and some of the other measurements I probably changed. Overall this was a very tasty soup, but I wish it had been thicker. I might try and modify the method to include a flour/oil roux as a thickener, or maybe just use some cornstarch next time. Thanks for the recipe, we really enjoyed it, especially as a way to use use up spinach that has seen crisper days!

This is Super-Delicious! I made as written minus the red pepper flake, while adding more garlic. I served with freshly grated parmesan cheese, and some fresh basil as well.. My husband said this was "special" lol! New family favorite...

My DH and I really liked this recipe,kids not so much(what else is new?????) I did not have bacon and I used a package of chicken sausage.I only used two potatoes as that was all I had but I think I will still not use as many as the recipe calls for the next time I make it,I did want more potato but I think six would be too much for me.I also want to try kale next time too.This will definetly go into my rotation.

This is a really tasty soup as written.  I omitted the cream to lower the calories and fat.  Next time I will omit the bacon and use low sodium broth to better make it fit our diets.  This is worth every calorie and fat gram as written.  I am making the changes so that we can enjoy this soup as regular part of our diet.  It is that good.

This is absolutely delicious!! Leftovers won't last long when you make this soup! I forgot to get bacon so I had to do without. It was still delicious, not as heavy with it. Also I used a couple cups of frozen spinach instead of kale. My husband devoured it, it's his new favorite soup. My 6 year old ate her entire bowl and wanted seconds. I love this! Best of all it's so easy to throw together, from start to finish it took maybe 30 40 minutes to make. It tasted like I had been cooking all day.

This was amazing! I made this with homemade bread bowls and my husband loved it. I think that next time I will use less sausage though because 1 lb was too much for us. I also used kale instead of spinach and added it earlier. I think that next time I will cook the bacon in the microwave and use milk instead of cream to make it healthier. I love when we can make restaurant meals at home!

I made this tonight and it was so tasty! It was almost identical to the restaurant version. My only caveat is to make sure you do not overboil the potatoes because they will begin to fall apart on you. I also made a smaller amount, so I used a half cup of heavy cream which was plenty. I also used kale instead of spinach.

OMG! This soup is soooo delicious. My husband and I ate it for dinner and then again for breakfast. He told me it was restaurant quality... but I think it was better. The only change I made per everyone Else's recommendation was to sub kale for the spinach. I will definitely make this soup again and again! Thanks so much!

I made this soup and everyone LOVED it!  My mother-in-law took some to work; her employees said it smelled wonderful, so she gave each person a sample.  They all lined up with their plastic spoons and got a taste, then they begged for the recipe!  Zuppa Toscana is my favorite at the popular restaurant, so now I can have it anytime at home!  I make a few changes to the recipe.  I use kale instead of spinach.  Kale doesn't get mushy like spinach does, and it brings an irreplaceable freshness and crunch to the soup.  The first time I made it, there was an excess of sausage, so either add more vegetables, or cut back on the meat by 1/4-1/2, depending on your personal taste.  Finally, Hubby likes the bacon crumbled and I agree; square cut bacon detracts from the rustic feel of the soup.  Otherwise, it's fabulous as is!  Another tip: if you have those small packages of red pepper flakes from your last pizza night, 1 1/2 packages are the perfect amount for the zuppa. You'll see: people will be asking you for the recipe, too!  Homemade soup, salad, and breadsticks, here we come!

Ok, I've made this twice in one week, and this time I made a double batch.  I suppose it's not the HEALTHIEST thing for us to be eating this much of, but that should tell you why I gave it 5 stars.  I made it just as the recipe said, except I left out the greens (personal taste).  Also, I served it with grated parm on top, and that added a lot to the flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a delicious soup.  I did make the mistake of following another reviewer's suggestion to add more fennel, and the flavor really overpowered the soup.  My mistake, not the recipe.  I do not recommend adding spices until you taste the soup first and then adjust to your taste.

Wow! This is the best soup recipe that I have ever made, and my family definitely agrees! I also sautéed a bunch of sliced mushrooms with white wine and added this at the same time as the browned sausage. This will be a regular of ours from now on.... it was even better than the famous restaurant version!

****EDIT 3/2010****
I've now made this several times and have it down.  I use reduced sodium chicken broth + about 1/3C  of regular chicken broth.  I then completely omit the bacon and use spice pork sausage.  To up the spice I use about 1/8-1/4tsp of cayenne.  It turns out just right.  I use just over the required amount of cream, and use Kale instead of spinach.  OH! I also use Red Potatoes.

It's not too salty anymore, and frankly is better than the soup at the restaurant.
******************************************

My husband loved this soup and he is NOT a soup person.  We both feel that it is better than the OG version.  HOWEVER, it's a bit salty.  I think that all the canned chicken broth is the culprit (I even used low salt/sodium).  Next time I make this I think I'll go half and half on the broth/water.  Otherwise, WONDERFUL!

I made this recipe with spicy hot Italian sausage (because hubby brought it home by mistake) and reduced the red pepper flakes by two-thirds.  I also substituted kale for the spinach.  It was still a bit spicy for me (the men in the family loved it), but I think with a milder sausage it would be perfect.  The broth really had a good flavor.  It didn't thicken up as much as I expected, but I think you could mash a few of the potato slices to thicken it up if you wanted a thicker soup.

Edit: After years of making this recipe, I add extra greens, use large potatoes and omit the cream. The cream is a thickener, but adds nothing to the flavor of the soup.

This made a good soup... its very rich, so beware! I pretty much followed the recipe but used half and half instead of the heavy cream and kale instead of spinach because i think it holds up better in soup.

Wonderful recipe!  My changes:  left out bacon, used half and half rather than cream, used kale rather than spinach (and a lot of it!!), used fat free chicken broth and added a little salt. Very good!

YUM.  This was wonderful.  I used Spicy sausage from my local butcher, frozen spinach and ham cubes. I was out of a few of the ingredients. I can see that the quality of your sausage would be very important in this recipe. This was perfect.

This soup had incredible flavor.  I was so impressed.  I did like it much better than the Olive Garden verson.  I also used part chicken broth and part bouillon. Worked beautifully. I also used frozen chopped spinach because I had no fresh on hand.  Had it as leftovers today and is even better than the night before!

I made this last night for some young adults (early 20's) and they totally loved it! I served with homemade rolls and I sent them home with all the leftovers. It was so good, we'll definitely make this monthly during the winter months. I did substitute the heavy cream for fat free half n half, just to reduce fat and calories. It wasn't missed!

We rarely have soup for dinner, as we somehow end up hungry and unsatisfied each time. Well, this soup is not only delicious and filling, but a lot more: Actually the best soup we have ever had! We didn't change a thing.

I loved this soup! It's my favorite at OG Restaurant, and I thought it tasted just like theirs.  No one else in my family liked it, but that's because they have no taste  ;)   I used kale instead of spinach, and needed to have cut it into smaller pieces that would fit on a spoon. I skipped the bacon, because I thought it sounded out of place, and I think it was a good call.  Wonderful!

I used hot sausage instead of sausage and pepper flakes.  I also used 1 cup of milk with 3 tablespoons of corn starch.

I LOVED this soup!

I used spinach because couldn't find kale.  I bought the kind in the bag and just added it until it looked right.  I also used low sodium chicken broth but needed to add salt in the end.  

I also used only 1 tsp of red pepper flakes and it was perfect.

I found that it did not freeze and reheat well - the second time around the bacon was chewy and the potatoes were completely crumbled and mashed.

BUT, over all it was delicious and I would definitely make it again!

Excellent recipe! I used hot sausage and substituted evaporated milk which did not hurt the soup. The spinach is a very nice touch.

Loved it!!! Just like Olive Garden. We coulm't stop eating this soup. I used light cream instead of heavy. Worked very well. I agree don't be afraid to use more potato. I will use a couple more next time. Thanks for making my husband a happy man. He loved it.

This is absolutely delicious.  Like other reviewers I used kale instead of spinach and I omitted the bacon.  I also used fat free half and half to save a few calories.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and we loved it.  I was planning to serve it along with our meal but I got lazy and it was the meal.  That turned out just fine because this soup is very satisfying.  Can’t wait to make it again.

I just made this using fat free half and half, turkey bacon and turkey sausage to cut down on fat and cholesterol.  It tasted wonderful but I think next time I'll stick with real bacon or try the bacon bits someone else recommended.  Everything else was perfect.

I'm always looking for recipes to share with my daughter, mom to 5. She is highly allergic to celery and carrots so finding hearty soups without those ingredients is difficult. This one is not only easy, but delicious and is now in our shared recipe files! Many thanks!

This recipe truly is "super-delicious." I took some advice from other reviews which I found very helpful: I used fewer potatoes, only 1 lb. of sausage, added fennel seed, replaced cream with skim milk, and used kale instead of spinach. The soup turned out AWESOME! It was a little salty for my taste, so next time I'll replace some of the broth with water. So glad to have found this recipe!

I have made this at least fifty times now.  My family makes me make it at LEAST once a week.  This is what I do to make everyone go back for thirds: Use the hot Italian sausage in the casings (the ground beef looking stuff has an inferior texture).  I use extra red pepper flakes to make it spicier.  Extra garlic makes it yummier.  Finally, I substitute kale for spinach... The Kale is chewier, but it doesn't shrivel up, and adds a lot of texture.  This soup has made me famous.  Thank you!

Don't see what is so thrilling about this soup. It was very thin. I added some cornstarch which helped a little. I used homemade chicken stock which also helped the flavor. All in all it was fairly boring which I anticipated looking at the list of ingredients. However due to the rave reviews I thought I would give it a try. I will not be making this again.

I love it. I used kale instead and didn't use any bacon. I also browned the sausage, onion and galic in a little bit of olive oil. I will be making this a lot.

Went searching for a 'knock off' recipe after eating at Olive Garden.  This was a hit!  We'll definitely be making this one again.  I used kale since I had some on hand, and only added it to my bowl.  (The kids aren't big fans.)

LOVE this soup!  I used sage sausage and cut back on the red pepper flakes.  Hubby's allergies were getting the best of him so he even ate a bowl (and he's not a soup eater)!

I used both mild Italian sausage and hot Italian sausage - instead of hot pepper flakes!  Everything else I did exactly, but it came out very thin.  Not sure I'll make it again, sorry.

Yummy!!!! My husband found this recipe online and we gave it a go last weekend. I made this soup as the appetizer and fettuccine alfredo as the main course. This soup was so good we made a meal out of it, though! :) 

Two things I will change in the future: I'll use less sausage and about 1/3 the amount of crushed red pepper. We generally like spicy, but this was a bit too spicy for our tastes. Otherwise, it's delicious! Five stars and an easy entry in the Frequently Used Recipe Collection!

Thank you for sharing!

Me and my fiancee loved this recipe.  Tasted so much like Olive Garden.  I did use just two potatoes cause it seemed too much for the what the recipe called for and it turned out just right. I will definately be making this again.

This was really good.  My only complaint is that it is a little greasy.  I drained the sausage and the bacon, but still had grease.  It was still very good. It makes quite a bit also, we gave some way to in-laws.  My husband enjoyed it and this is favorite soup when we go out to eat.

I replaced the spinach with chopped kale and used slightly less potatoes.  Next time, hubby requested more sausage.  I used half sweet italian and half hot italian sausages instead of the crushed red pepper and it was PERFECT.  Just like the OG.  Loved it!

This was actually better than the soup at the Italian chain. It had more kick from the red pepper, so if you don't like the kick, I'd decrease the amount of red pepper flakes. I paired this with garlic-parmesan breadsticks from Taste of Home cookbook. Yum!

Love this soup!  I actually use 2 lbs of hot italian sausage and cut my potatoes into cubes.  They don't get mushy that way.  I cut back on the cream to approximately 1/2 cup.  Just the best!!

I made this for my hard to please husband and I..  He has raved about it ever since.  I love it.  A different, most delicious soup.  Great with a warm, crusty Italian bread.

Finally a soup the kids love.  I tweaked a little. I only used 2 cans of chk broth because I like it thicker and don't want the potatoes to over cook.  I used new potatoes vs. russets. Tried both ways and the consistency of the new potatoes is much better. Make sure you add the bacon or it will be bland but if you forget salt to taste (speaking from experience) I have made this soup several times and it is always a favorite.  It is better than the Zuppa Toscana at Olive Garden.

This is an awesome recipe- easy & tasty. The first time I used frozen spinach and the next time I make this I will use fresh. This tastes better than the restaurant version; thanks for sharing it.

very very good.  We only used 1lb of sausage and cannot even think of using more!  The only thing we didnt like was the thin layer of grease on the top of the soup. It also seems like the potato slices ended up just dissolving.  Next time i will keep them a bit thicker and just cook it a bit longer.  Other than that, the taste was great!!! very yummy. thanks for this recipe, i will be sharing it with lots of people.

Excellent dish.  My girlfriend said it was just as good if not better than the soup she gets at Olive Garden.  Accompanied with garlic bread, this is a very satisfying, filling meal.

This soup is amazing every time! I use spicy sausage which eliminates the need for chili flake. Unless you like more heat. Another recipe I used called for Kale instead of spinach which worked just as well. Make this soup!! You will not be disappointed. ??

I absolutely love this soup and it is easy to make. I use kale removed from the central stem and add it  
 raw to individual bowls. Then pour the hot soup right over it.  I think it is important to cut the potatoes paper-thin, as directed for the best texture. Next time, I want to add about a tsp of fennel to the soup.  Our family leaves out the red pepper flakes because of sensitivity. Instead, I use bacon that is coated with ground black pepper.

I stuck to the recipe and I gave it to two friends and another who was recovering from surgery.  They loved it.  The one friend who had surgery wanted to know if I would make it again for her or did she have to through another surgery just to get a bowl of this soup.  I was so very pleased with the outcome.  Kudos Allrecipes

This soup is soooo good! I’ve made it twice so far and its definitely my go to for a nice hearty soup. I did substitute kale instead of spinach and only a teaspoon of red pepper.

I used cheap sausages I had in the freezer thinking they’d run it, but it turned out great. Spice level was perfect for me but too much for the youngest ones, I’ll make one big dish then split off some for the kids and add hot sauce to the adult one, next time.

Easy to make, and delicious. I used 200ml of 47% fat cream, so it was a little too heavy, but it was could otherwise. I’d use a less fatty cream and/or less next time. I omitted the bacon and put a lot more spinach than called for to get more greens into our diet, and it was great!

My family loves it!! I made some for my parents and they enjoyed it. My boys always leave the juice, so I fry more Italian sausage and add potatoes to the juice. Cook until the potatoes are soft.

I regularly make this soup. I love it!  It is the best and our family’s favorite soup. I reduce the red pepper flakes because I don’t like it too spicy and I also reduce the sausage. I add the 5 oz container of spinach because I like more greens but I can’t wait to try the kale next time.

I made this for dinner one night and everyone loved it.  Even my 98 year old mama who is active as a 60 year old and just as healthy.  I made plenty and it was good that I did.  Mama ate a bowl every day and we still were able to finish it off as a night time supper.

Great flavor!  SOOO delicious!  To me, it's better than the restaurant version.  I have made this several times for family and gatherings.  People always like it. I used spinach and I have used kale.... I like using both - it just depends on if I want the fiber texture of kale or the silky soft wilted spinach.  One important note is that the quality of flavor is largely determined by the quality of the Italian sausage used.

Made this just as the recipe said and it was "off the hook", delicious! My family asked for more 3 weeks later, so I am making it again, but adding more sausage for my "heavy meat eaters!"

Made this for the second time. Pretty much stuck to the recipe. Maybe not as much liquid. Delicious. You could add more pepper if you like it spicier.

I really enjoyed this soup. Instead of 5 cans of chicken broth, I did 3 cups of broth and 3 cups of water. I exchanged bacon for turkey bacon and the cream for almond milk (son is lactose intolerant). I placed the spinach in the bowls then dished soup on top so spinach wouldn't get soggy instead of in the pot.

This was delicious!  Instead of spinach.   I used kale, just like Olive Garden.  Will definitely make again and again!!!

This is such a simple recipe that tastes sooooo good!!! I used chicken sausage and it came out amazing. I’d probably use less of the meat only because I like more broth in my soups. Also used kale, and cut my potatoes into chunks instead of slices. Definitely keeping this recipe to make whenever I want a good soup :)

I alway use hot sausage when making this dish and add anise seeds just a pinch. Whipping cream makes it smooth and we love this dish!!

My husband and I both really loved this recipe.  We first tasted it in December when we visited my sister in Hawaii, and she made it for dinner.  When I made it at home, I did lower the amount of crushed red pepper from 1 & 1/4 teaspoon down to 1/2 teaspoon.  I know my husband found the original recipe to be almost too spicy for him, so I toned it down.  It was still delicious to both of us.  Considering how simple this recipe is, I know I will be making it a whole lot from now on!

I made this soup and it turned out better than Olive Garden Zuppa Toscana! The only difference was I used kale instead of spinach.  I’ll definitely make this again.

I made this and it was so good ! I used kale instead of spinach. I added broccoli and celery for more filling since I did not use any meat. I added spices like Cajun, onion powder and garlic powder for more flavor. I also used 2 pints of veggie broth and 2 pints of chicken broth.

This was fairly easy to make. I did use kale instead of spinach. And a lot more garlic, because you can never have too much garlic.  My entire family loved it. Served with fresh grated romano and crusty bread for dipping. Will definitely make again.

This was absolutely delicious! Just used Kale instead of spinach... and an extra slice of bacon.. oh and it was thick cut bacon! And I didn't have canned broth so I just made my own with water and chicken bullion. My boyfriend and 3 kids loved it! This will definitely be a cold weather recipe I will keep in rotation!

If anyone doesn't like spicey, omit the red pepper flakes. Usually I leave them out but added this time and it was too much for me. Husband likes spicy, and he loved it.
Use a little less onion.

How many WOWs can I give this? Absolutely delicious! I also swapped kale for the spinach and hot Italian sausage for the mild. This will be added into my “special treats” dinner rotation- if it was healthier, I would make it often!!!! Mmmm mmmm. Easy and flavorful. Better than Olive Garden!

Why we waited so long to make this recipe I'll never understand.   Truth be told, we went a little heavy on the bacon, but a couple of extra strips didn't hurt it.  And we used kale instead of spinach because we had fresh kale on hand.  If you want to impress someone with your soup making skills, then this is the recipe you're looking for.  It's Fantastic!

Excellent recipe. The only thing I changed was replacing the spinach with kale (and doubled the kale).  Nearly an exact copycat of the Olive Garden soup.

So easy and so delicious.  The only change I made was to add one dan of white beans at the end with the sausage.  Delicious!

Awesome. Used spicy Italian sausage and a bunch of spinach to make it healthy. LOL. Will be in my winter Zappa list for cold nites.

WOW!!! I wanted something different for my family and this did not disappoint! I used ground sweet sausage. I microwaved my bacon to save on time. I even added a little Parmesan cheese to top it off at the end! Very yummy and easy to make!

I have been using this recipe for years and it is always such a great hit with guests and the family.I tweaked it by using chopped kale Without stems, only using leaves. Much better than spinach in my opinion. At the end when you stir the kale and I also stir in white wine and a tablespoon of butter!

This is a great soup for a cool day, but would be good for any day.
It has the perfect amount of spice. I used the sweet mild Italian sausage. It was so good I ate two bowls.

It's delicious. However I did have to adjust the amounts of ingredients as I went. I followed the recipe exactly and ended up removing or adding some things, depending on how it was turning out. I also used Kale instead of spinach, because I wanted it like Olive Garden's Zuppa Toscana. I'm a first time cook and it turned out great for me. It wasn't too difficult and I highly recommend it.

Love it!
I used spicy Italian Sausage and skipped the first step of adding the chili flakes. Also instead of using Bacon I used 125g shredded Prosciutto and added after the potatoes.

It turned out great. I used hot italian sausage instead of mild, and left out the crushed red peppers to compensate. My roommate said it was still too spicy, but he's kind of a wimp about that sort of thing. One thing that I don't see most reviews saying is that in addition to be super easy, this recipe is incredibly cheap to make. The most expensive thing is the sausage, and even that isn't bad if you shop around. I estimate the price to be right around $10 to make the first time, and then significantly less after, since most of the ingredients can be bought in bulk. (Especially if you use Chicken Bouillon to make your own broth)

The recipe is not only DELICIOUS, but it is very easy to make.  As others have mentioned, I used kale instead of spinach which I feel added a nice texture to the soup.

Terrific soup! I made a couple of adjustments: I substituted hot sausage for mild, and eliminated most of the extra crushed red pepper. Also substituted turnips for potatoes - and they add a wonderful, slightly sweet taste and texture. Also substituted red Chard for the spinach. Yummy!!!

This soup is AMAZING! It’s so simple but filled with flavor! If you love the Zuppa Toscana soup at Olive Garden then you will love this soup too! After reading other reviews I did make a few alterations. I added 1 teaspoon of fennel seed while cooking the itialian sausage (be sure to rinse the cooked sausage under water to avoid your soup turning orange), cut back the red pepper flakes to 1/2 teaspoon, and only cut up 4 potatoes instead of 6 (that was plenty of potatoes in the soup).  Slicing the potatoes thinly only required 5-7 minutes of cook time not 20!! I would 100% make this soup again, soooo yummy!!!!!!

We used low sodium bacon, store bought broth, and home made venison sausage. It was still pretty salty, we are working on a solution there and will update if we come up with one. Great flavor and reheated well for lunch the next day. We were nervous about the thin sliced potatoes, instead of cubed, but it works well in the end

Was expecting some out of this world soup based on the reviews. Followed recipe excerpt added a tsp of fennel seed, and used kale instead of spinach. I didn't like it very much, and wife thought it was just okay. Very disappointing, will not make again.

This was absolutely delicious, this is my new favorite soup. My wife was totally blown away, she has never had this before. I used kale in mine and I think it adds more flavor. I sliced a loaf of French bread and brushed the slices with olive oil then I toasted them and loaded up the toast points with all of that incredible Zuppa.

This was delicious! I followed the instructions of another reviewer and rinsed the sausage with hot water and sliced 2 potatoes thin and 5 thick. It kept the color from turning. I kept the bacon in and just added some black pepper at the very end with the spinach. Such a great fall meal.

I gave it 4 stars but it is super close to a 5! I am not a fan of spinach so I switched it out for kale and I omitted the bacon step because I hate soggy bacon and felt it didn’t add anything to the dish so I kept the sausage fat instead of the bacon fat and it is a huge family favourite. 
We have it at least once a month, add a little Siracha for a kick at the end!

This recipe is easy and delicious!!!  I doubled the recipe, and I diced the potatoes rather than sliced them.  Personal preference.  My family loved this soup.  It is definitely on the make this regularly list.  Wonderfully  comforting on a  chilly, rainy day.

I made it with breakfast sausage and  made it with kale.  Or Swiss chard. Left out  crushed red pepper.  Because it's already in the breakfast sausage.

Making it fir yet another pot luck. I use kale instead of spinach. I'm making a double batch the night before & will reheat in my crock pot at work. It's the most requested potluck dish. Tastes best next day with creamy Yukon potatoes ????

Good stuff!  I used kale instead of spinach as I find it hold up better. I also used cauliflower in the base of the soup - all blended to make it creamier and used fewer potatoes (left in chunks).

I had some kale and chicken sausage on hand and decided to look up a recipe.  This one looked easy and had lots of good reviews so I chose it.  I didn't have bacon so I omitted it.  After reading lots of reviews I decided to use half n half instead of heavy cream and greatly reduce the red pepper flakes and it turned out great.  I also added 1 rib of celery and 2 carrots as well to add some fiber and vitamins and grated in some fresh nutmeg (I always use it for cream based sauses).  My husband loved it and so did I.  I will definitely make this again.

I didn't have bacon and truthful didn't want to put in a third meat product so I just used liquid smoke. It was absolutely delicious. Thanks for this recipe. I'll be making it regularly I'm sure.

So addicting! Everyone in my family loves it. The only thing I did differently was used milk instead of heavy cream, just because I forgot to pick some up. Oh, and of course extra bacon, because, well, it's bacon!

Definitely a keeper....but cut back on the broth and increase the cream. Needs to be thicker and more hearty in my opinion. Maybe start with a roux to make more like a chowder....Also, use spinach instead of kale.

It’s perfect!  Made the broth a bit thicker by making a paste with some boiled potatoes and used hot sausage in place of the mild.  I will often use bacon bits to make it easier and it cuts down on some of the grease but no flavors are lost in my opinion.   I have made this dozens of times and will continue to do so.

This is the second time I have made this...my favorite soup from Olive Garden. I used hot Jimmy Dean bulk sausage plus a little bit of red pepper flake. Like others, I used kale instead of spinach and heavy cream to finish. I'm already excited for leftovers.

I had this soup at Olive Garden and vowed to learn to make it. I found this recipe and, replaced the spinach with kale. It turned out the same as the restaurant! And so easy! I love it and will make it from now on.

I have never heard of this made with spinach so I used frozen kale of course, but I think I may have added too much. I should have chopped the potatoes thinner like the recipe said and not listened to all the comments about that. There doesn’t need to be any fewer either if your potatoes are smaller. I like the red pepper. I could have added more broth

Delicious recipe! I used chicken sausage and turkey bacon which gave plenty of flavor. I made this a veggie-full soup by adding green beans, carrots, sweet potatoes (instead of russet potatoes) and kale (instead of spinach. My boys and husband just asked if I would make it again this week. It looks like this will be a staple!

So... spinach? Nope, kale. Also how can you possibly boil 6 potatoes in 2.75 c liquid, soup for 2 with 6 potatoes?! What I did...
30 oz. Chx broth
2 c heavy cream 
2 handfuls of chopped kale (I'm italian we dont really measure)
Salt n pepper to taste
Now you have soup for 4 or more!

I have made this several times.  I made it as stated except I use chicken sausage and I used Kale like other reviewers recommended.  Delicious.   I have also used Beyond Meat vegetarian sausage for my son who is vegetarian and he loves this.  I have started cutting the broth to 4 cans.   I have added white beans which adds a nice heartiness to it.

Amazing. I can't handle spicy at all so I omitted the red pepper flakes. I added 1 1/2 tsp fennel as recommended by some other reviewers and cubed my potatoes instead of thinly slicing them. The soup is a tad salty so I would recommend using low sodium broth next time but there definitely will be a next time. Pairs well with crusty bread.

Added an extra pound of hot sausage because I like the meat and spice. Will definitely make this again. It’s my favorite soup. OG seems to be a lil watered down lately so I’m glad I found this!!!

Made exactly as recipe stated. Pretty decent potato soup. Made sourdough bread bowls to accompany soup. The bread bowls were a great add.

My family loves this soup when we go to Olive Garden and this recipe was absolutely every bit as good!  The kids had two and even three bowls.  Just the right amount of zest and cream for that unforgettable flavor.

Have made this one several times now as it's a family favorite since the first time.  Today I will make it again but using kale instead of spinach because I have kale in the garden that needs to be used.

I have made this soup several times since finding this recipe! This time I didnt have spinach or heavy cream so I substituted kale and whole milk and it is still delicious.  I also add a sprinkle of green onion on top when serving.

Five stars because this worked so well. I made my own adjustments to it and I think it came out better than the chain version. I used spicy Italian sausage, only 3 big russet potatoes, and kale instead of spinach. I also used a box of broth then filled the pot with water and two teaspoons of caldo de pollo, this prevented the soup from getting too salty. The spicy sausage replaces the red peppers and really seasons the whole soup. Next time I’ll replace one of the potatoes for cauliflower!

Super delicious!!   Made it for someone with dairy allergies.  Left out the heavy cream.  Left out the Red Pepper Flakes so it wouldn't be so spicy.  The sausage was spicy enough.   Substituted kale for the spinach.  Added extra bacon.   It was great.

It’s a good soup but was missing something. There’s a taste that I was looking for maybe it’s Olive Garden’s secret ingredient.

Very good soup. I did take the advice of other reviewers and cut two potatoes thinly sliced to thicken it. I didn't add the cream I don't think it needed it. Delicious

This soup was delicious.  I found it accidentally by putting in an ingredient search of leftover items I wanted to use up.  It was something different from the norm, took less than an hour, and was filling.  We served it with homemade honey wheat bread, pomello (citrus fruit), and Caesar salad.
The consistency was that of creamy broth so if you like a thicker soup base, you may want to add a thickener.

I chopped up 6 regular sized russet potatoes, used 1 cup of 2% milk and 3 tablespoons of cornstarch. Added one tablespoon of chicken bouillon powder at the end. And used kale instead of spinach. It turned out still amazing and creamy!!!

Really good! I tried this with Natashaskitchen.com last time, which is very similar to this one. However, what I didn't like was too much of a flavor with chicken broth and cream. So, this time, I substituted chicken broth with just water and added cream just like in the recipe. Also, I did kale instead of spinach; and ground beef with seasonings (because that's what I had on hand) instead of italian sausage.

One of my all time faves. My son is who a picky eater, loves this soup. I am literally currently eating this now. I use a lot of bacon and fry it to a crisp with chopped onions and add lots of potatoes and kale. I use mild Italian sausage. So yummy.

I made this soup tonight and used a teaspoon of fennel that someone recommended so thank you! I also used kale instead of spinach. However, I would recommend chopping and cooking the kale separately before adding it to the soup! It came out great

Delicious!  I've never had this at 'the restaurant' but heard how good it was so I had to try it.  Followed recipe but used kale since that's used in the OG original.  I also used low sodium chicken stock to keep the sodium content down.  I'm sure it's just as good with spinach.  Definitely will be added to the rotation!

This soup was amazing! I will double the recipe next time! Only thing I altered was I only used 3/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes. It still had a bite! Delicious!

Using kale is a must! It holds up better than spinach and the flavor blends perfectly.

This soup was amazing and so flavorful!  I made it exactly by the recipe, but used a bag of baby spinach.  It was a hit with everyone in my family,n including my 6-year-old grandson!  This will be a favorite!

This was really, really good and I'll definitely make this again. I do agree with some of the other reviewers who said this was a bit salty/had a bit too much sausage in it, so I'll cut back on the broth and add a bit more water next time.  I'm sure it's great with kale, so I might try that too.

I made this tonight with a few minor modifications.  After reading an earlier review I rinsed my Italian sausage in hot water to prevent the soup from turning red. Glad that I did.  I used kale instead of Spinach. I used half-and-half instead of heavy cream and I added cornstarch to thicken it up a bit. I also used a few more red pepper flakes because I like it a tad bit spicy. And I must say it is delicious!  Very pleased!

This is a very yummy soup, and it comes out pretty too. I used low sodium broth, and 2 cups of kale in place of the spinach. Hubby got seconds and even my kids loved it! Except the three year old. She hates everything. Lol. Will definitely be making again.

I change the sausage to hot, and Instead of spinach, I used kale; it was put in at the very end when it will have some bit to the kale and still green and  everything  else is the same.

This is delicious! Had never heard of this soup let alone tasted it. I used Jimmy Dean Turkey Crumbles, real turkey bacon, and the bag of spinach & baby kale. Ground black pepper on the sausage crumble and bacon; also I sprinkled  cayenne pepper over the sausage instead of red pepper flakes. My guy loves the Olive Garden soup and he loved mine just as much!

A keeper! I used 3 red potatoes (very thinly sliced / quartered) and added a can of drained white beans.  Served with grilled cheese sandwich and a IPA such as Cigar City Jai Alai.  Delish!

This was delicious!  The only changes made were we added 4 more bacon slices that I oven baked earlier that day. You can never go wrong with more bacon, right?  Browned the sausage on the stovetop and chunked it up. Initially I was planning on draining the grease off the sausage, but it seemed fairly lean so added the onion to the sausage mixture and then the other ingredients. A great hearty soup!  Serve with a crusty loaf of bread...enjoy!

This is great. I skipped the bacon, but cooked the onions in sausage grease. I used hot sausage and skipped the pepper flakes, and I replaced the spinach with kale. This soup could be made a lot of ways but it's very good.

I love making this soup. Each time I make it I try to follow the recipe but sometimes I don’t have kale or spinach so I’ll use either. It tastes great with or without some bacon as well. Some days I’ll use garlic and some days I’ll go with out it. In the end it always tastes amazing. I love how versatile this soup can be!!

I made this exactly as stated. Tased spit on and is quick. Absolutely loved it. The second time I did chop different thickness of potatoes as the really this ones break down I also roughly skinned them as well. Skimming the top layer of the sausage fat helps if you plan on refrigerating/freezing some. I absolutely love this soup.

This recipe needs way more spice. Use more red pepper flakes and minced garlic. Use kale instead of spinach. Use Jimmy Dean Italian Pork Sausage (ground). Don't skip the onions- you'll need the flavor. Double the bacon. It takes about an hour or a little over to cook the potatoes enough in the crockpot on high heat.

Taste JUST like Olive Gardens Zuppa. I substituted hot Italian sausage for mild and eliminated the red pepper flakes. We add extra kale to it as well. My kids LOVE this soup!

I love this recipe. I prefer kale to spinach however because it holds its shape better. I also use better than bullion chicken instead of chicken broth because it adds more flavor. My family are picky when it comes to spice, so I have to leave out the red pepper flakes. Thanks for posting!

Wow. There’s a reason why this has 4,000 reviewers with 4,000 different palates  and yet it’s still a 5-star recipe. 

My suggestions:

1. Omit the potatoes. You don’t need them. I use slightly more of the added other ingredients to make up for it. 
2. Don’t skip the heavy cream. You will miss the richness of the dish. It’s hilarious that so many people sub the heavy cream for milk and tbsps of flour and yet gorge on potatoes. Heavy cream is good for you, folks. Potatoes aren’t. 
3. Halve the amount of red pepper. It still gives a slight kick without overpowering the rest of the flavours. 
4. Rather than dice or chop your potatoes, blitz them in a food processor until they’re VERY finely chopped but not yet purée. Sautée them in the bacon fat on medium-low (but closer to low) for 15-20 minutes before proceeding. 
5. Take out the bacon once it’s cooked and put it off to the side with the sausage. 
6. Sub kale for spinach. Don’t even think about using spinach. Becomes wayyyy too slimy. Of course it takes awhile to break down the kale so add it into the soup and then simmer it for 20 minutes. 

Also, how the heck can people low score this recipe for “blandness”? Add salt or bouillon, taste, and repeat until flavourful for your palate. LOL. Not rocket science.

This soup was the perfect level of spicy for my husband and I but if you are not a fan of spicier foods, you probably want to cut the crushed red pepper back a bit. Didn’t change a thing and this soup was delicious!

I made this with potatoes several times before I went on the KETO diet. Now, as following the recipe, I put in 1 head of chopped cauliflower instead of potatoes. It’s got less carbs and it taste great! My family loves it!

I make this every year when it starts getting cold. The recipe is great as is, but it's even better if you use kale instead of spinach. It's really easy to make and even easier to customize if you're into that sort of thing. Definitely one of my favorites.

This soup at OG is my favorite soup in the WORLD, so I had to find the recipe and make it.  I will say this recipe is about 99% great...  Only a couple changes I’d suggest..
1) If you have an Instant Pot, use it!  It’s great to make this delicious soup in an hour or less and have it taste like it’s been simmering and the flavors mixing all day!  
2) As a previous poster mentioned, this recipe leaves out the Fennel Seed that is in the OG recipe.  The Fennel is very important to get the nuanced flavor you get at the restaurant.  Also, lightly crush the Fennel Seeds to release their flavor before adding.
3) I’d definitely use hot Italian sausage instead of mild.  Of course the level of heat will come down to personal preference, but the hot sausage will make this more like the restaurant soup.
4) The original version does use kale, not spinach.  I find the kale to be tastier than spinach as well as more in line with the original recipe.
5) Be sure to use russet potatoes.  This is what the restaurant uses, and when cooked in soup they tend to make it creamier than other strains of potatoes.
6) I’d also recommend using Better Than Bouillon Chicken soup base as opposed to your average chicken stock - but I’d encourage using BTB over regular stock in ANY soup or dish that calls for stock or broth.

Other than those little adjustments, great recipe!  I could eat this multiple times a week and I’m not sure I’d ever get sick of it lol

This was good, but a bit salty and way too creamy. Use half a cup of cream (I will likely just use almond milk next time) and cut out the bacon. Sub out spinach for kale and I would probably do half a pound of sausage. One pound was too much for me. I did, however, use Italian chicken sausage and it was just as tasty, but with a little less fat.

I use a whole package of bacon and substitute kale for spinach but otherwise follow the recipe. Never fails to impress!

This is an outstanding recipe!!!! I used turkey kielbasa and added a teaspoon of fennel as another user recommended. My onion had gone bad so I short cutted it with a ton of onion powder. Served with some french bread for dunking and....voila! KUDOS! Thanks!

Delicious... I made a couple of changes because I am not that great of a  cook and I don't eat pork.  I substituted real bacon for turkey bacon and I used Italian Turkey sausage instead of pork. Because I am not that great of a cook and didn't read the instructions before I started,  I cooked the onion, garlic and Italian turkey sausage together.  I also used no salt chicken broth and I chose to use Kale instead of spinach.  I didn't have to add any salt as the sausage and turkey bacon gave it what it needed.  I will definitely make this again.

Four large russet potatoes, and a medium onion chopped instead of the Simply Potatoes (which are good too).  I alternate between making it with chopped baby spinach, or chopped kale.  Serve it with some garlic bread, and a ceasar salad.  It's a family favorite!

Excellent! This was so good, with some pan-fried bread. I did add a little oregano, carrot and celery. I do not eat meat, so I used fake sausage and bacon ( Field Roast Italian)and this should be added last.

Followed the lead and used kale. Gotta drain the hot sausage if you don’t care for the orange color. I still added pepper flakes even using the hot sausage. I don’t like spice but adding the pepper flakes made is delicious. Added fennel to the cooking meat process and cooked all in one pot. I don’t care for having to add additional steps and cooking process that are clearly unneeded.

Fantastic! Finally a soup the whole family likes. I did cut the red pepper flakes in half and youngest child still thought it was spicy in some bites. Swapped the spinach with kale per other reviews, and will do again next time, but tear into smaller pieces. Thank you for sharing an amazing recipe.

A very good recipe. My adjustments:  used sliced leek in addition to the onion, omitted the bacon, used chopped kale instead of spinach, increased chicken broth to at least eight cups and cut the chili flakes in half. In retrospect, using the full amount would’ve given the soup a little more zing. I’ll be sure to add it next time.

It needed some salt and I added kale instead of spinach. Otherwise it was perfect and very simple to make. I will definitely enjoy using this recipe again and again.

It was delicious!!! I added more of the chicken broth and the heavy cream as it was a bit dry. I think that maybe my potatoes were too big and this is what maybe dried it out.

This is one of those recipes that yields something a little bit extra, definitely greater than the sum of its parts. I had regular sausage from a local producer, so I added Italian seasoning while it browned. Didn't add the bacon because I was cooking at someone else's house and couldn't find it, even though it WAS there. :O Used low sodium chicken broth 'cause my Mom always said you can always add more salt but you can't take it back out. This soup is abundantly DELICIOUS! Each person who ladled some into a bowl and took a bite used that word, DELICIOUS. I was one of them. Can't wait to make it for my daughter, the soup connoisseur, who will be here for Christmas.

My family loves this recipe. I do cheat by buying the precooked real bacon pieces in the salad isle at the grocery store. It saves on time. I also use kale or spinach just depending on which one is on sale.

Sent  it off to college with my boys.  They gobbled it down and are requesting more.  (Love how much more they appreciate my food now they do their own cooking).  At home family loved as well.  Just the right amount of heat with the crushed red peppers.  Added Cannolleni beans to extend quantity.  Also did kale.

Delicious!!! I love to cook although I dont consider myself to be an expert. That being said, this recipe was very easy to follow. I followed most of the instructions except for for the broth. I used low sodium broth after reading a few reviewer comments regarding the saltiness of the dish. Also, I prefer kale over spinach, so I made a switch here. I didnt add any extra seasoning...the dish didn’t need any. I've made this soup twice now and I highly recommend this recipe.

This soup is out of this world delicious!! I made a vegetarian version and it was still  wonderfully delicious. I substituted Tofurky Italian Saugage, Morningstar Bacon, and vegetable broth. I also added butter when I heated the broth, this gave it a wonderful creaminess. I  also added Parmesan cheese to it during the final step.  Thank you so much for the recipe.

I cooked the bacon in the morning so I did not use the dippings instead I used oil olive to cook the onions & garlic.  I also used baby kale in place of the spinach.  I needed to add salt.
Served to friends and husband.  Everyone wanted seconds!!

We've made thsi many times.  It  is a favourite at our house.  No leftovers with two teens, a set of parents and a Grandma.  Amazing.  We serve it with a crusty bread and salad.  Not too salty when we use a reduced sodium broth.

Just made this soup. Added fennel as suggested, switched from spinach to kale. Also, used bone broth (versus bouillon or  stock) for what I hope supplies more nutrients.  It was delicious.

Slice potatoes medium/thick or else they will disintegrate. Prefer chopped fresh kale over spinach. Really delicious recipe.

I tried this last night, it was quick and easy and it didn't disappoint.  i went ahead and added an extra cup of heavy cream and i added about 12oz of water to make up for chicken broth. I only picked up 64oz.  We Like spicy so i bought Hot Italian Sausage, next time I'll add a little extra crushed red pepper too.

Delicious! I skipped the bacon and it has great flavor even without it (I love bacon but sometimes it can really overpower a recipe!). I've also made it low-carb by using cauliflower instead of potatoes and that is great, too!

This soup is amazing!  My only change is subbing kale for the spinach.  It holds up perfectly.  I love spinach but sometimes it tends to seem slimy in soups.  Want to make this again and again.  Definitely a hit.  Next time I will quadrupple the recipe and make it in my huge chili pot!!

Very delicious. I used evaporated milk instead of cream, reduced the amount  of sausage and omitted the bacon to make it lighter.

Ive never had soup like this before tonight. I asked my step son what one of his fave meals is, and said Id cook it for him. He mentioned this soup, and I found this recipe. It was super easy to make and didnt take much time. Its also DELICIOUS. I will be adding this into our regular rotation for sure! He liked it better than his moms version ;)

Also, I didnt have red pepper flakes, and it was delicious without them.

I used Andouille sausage which is fairly spicy and has a bit of heat so I did not use the crushed red pepper.  I also prefer this with kale which was also a recipe recommendation. Took me about 90 minutes from start to end.  Family gave it a double thumbs up rating.

This was quite good. I used kale instead of spinach and skipped the bacon. Next time I would probably only add half the cream called for in the recipe, as it was a bit too heavy for my taste. I will also peel the potatoes, as they break down quite a bit and then you end up with strips of potato peel floating around and I'm not a fan of that texture in the soup. Otherwise, very delicious and will make again!

It was really delicious, but a little too much potato (and I only added four potatoes instead of six). I would make it again, but I'm going to try blending before adding back the sausage and kale.

Love this soup!! I use kale and mild Italian sausage (personal  preference) and no bacon. I don’t think the bacon is even necessary because it’s amazing without it and I’m not sure what it would add to it honestly. Definitely recommend making!

This is best version of the Tuscan soup. My family and our friends we enjoy it every time. It is a little heavier than recommended if you watch your figure, but for once in a while you deserve to spoil yourself. I made this soup following this exact recipe for quite few times now. The more I make it the better it is. I no longer cook the bacon, sausage and the onion separate. I first put the bacon in the pan, then I add the sausage and at last the onion and garlic. I let them to saute until the all juice is reduced and the meet becomes crispy. I did not change the rest of the steps. Try it! Is excellent!

Absolutely delicious!  Don't change anything! Except kale is a good substitute for spinach because it holds well in the soup. But both are fantastic in it.

it was delicious, I used kale instead of spinich though. I also added a small amount of salt because I used more chicken broth to get more liquid. I also added more crushed peppers to  the Italian sausage which gave me a little more of a light orange tint to the soup. But it was delicious and spicier!!!

Delicious. Everyone in my family loved it. Even my son who does not eat soups! 
Used kale instead of spinach and coconut milk instead of cream- to make it dairy free. No one tasted the changed ingredients.

Super easy - I omitted the bacon, used breakfast turkey sausage, and used Aleppo pepper instead of traditional crushed red (which has a sharp edge I don't care for). Magnificent!

Because my husband does not eat pork I substitue the bacon for turkey bacon and the bulk italian pork sausage for bulk italian turkey sausage and it is a hit.  I've been making this for  about 5 years now and he and the kids will request it at least 3 times during the winter.

This is my new favorite soup recipe. I first tried it at the Olive Garden. I made it two days later and I will be making it from now on. Very easy recipe to follow and and put your on spin on it. Instead of Spinach, I used chopped Kale. I would recommend this recipe to everyone. Enjoy!!

My husband and son can't get enough of this soup!!!  They don't like kale or spinach in it so I leave that out.  I also add more garlic.  Otherwise, it's an all-year round favorite recipe that they aren't tiring of!  Making more again for tonight!  Thank you, souporsweets, for this perfect easy recipe!

This is delicious everytime I make it. I do substitute kale instead of spinach, as I think it holds up better in the soup.

I substitued cauliflower florets for potatoes to make this Paleo diet friendly.  You don't need to boil the cauliflower as long as you would with potatoes but otherwise I kept everything else the same and it was delicious!

I opted to use spinach as my husband is not a fan of kale.  What I did was add the spinach to each bowl of hot soup instead of to the whole pot.  That way the spinach doesn't get to overdone.  Really delicious!  I did use extra bacon and Italian sausage both hot and mild.

I think this is a good starting point for a recipe that is easily modified to suit anyone's taste.

I used a 5 qt dutch oven and it was very full when it was finished. I would say that it easily makes 8 (2 cup) servings).

I made the following modifications:
-Kale instead of spinach (8 oz package, stems removed) (I added it with the cream and the sausage and cooked for about 5 minutes to soften.
-Potatoes (1.5 pounds, skin-on russets, cut in large, but bite-sized chunks)
-Half-n-half instead of heavy cream (actually, I used what cream I had in the fridge (about 1/4 cup) and the rest half-n-half)
-1/2 tsp red pepper flakes instead of 1-1/4 tsp (next time I would add a little more. My kids said they would like a little more spice, but 1-1/4 would probably be too much for my kids.)
-Chicken broth, I used 40 oz. I thought the 5 cans would be too much.

Next time I might leave out the bacon. I don't think the famous restaurant has it in theirs.

Good recipe. I used homemade Turkey Italian Sausage and turkey bacon. I also added fennel seed to the soup and subbed kale for the spinach (I used an whole bunch). It's definitely needed for the overall flavor. Overall, it's a good recipe and I will definitely make it again.

I want to add another 2 cups to Chicken Broth for next time for more of the soup and add just enough salt before adding in the sausage.
I  would love to make it again for maybe a party or a night in Dinner.

I loved this recipe I wasn’t in search of a copywrite recipe of the Olive Garden one and this was an amazing recipe for the foundation of what I was looking for and to be honest I’m pretty sure i like it ten times more then the Olive Garden recipe!! Which is a huge plus! Okay so I obviously replaced the spinach with kale and used hot Italian sausage instead of just Italian sausage and adding the red peppers although when serving I did use the red pepper flakes for serving as well as some shredded parm.. also I accidentally used red potatoes because I swore that was what the recipe was and it turned out great FYI in case you only have ave red potatoes on hand. Thank you so much for this recipe I really appreciate it! Come on guys give it a try.

This is divine! I used kale instead of spinach, left out the bacon, and added a teaspoon of fennel seeds. I used 3.5 big potatoes cut into thin slices and they acted as a nice thickener for the soup as they got softer. There was a slight orange tint that went away after a bit of boiling. Really delicious and easy.

Used regular Italian sausage so my toddler could eat it and added cayenne pepper to my own. Delish! Will make again. Might try kale next time.

Where do I begin. I made this exactly as written, and it was pretty awful. Overly salty, the cream curdled, the veggies turned to mush. Won't make again.

This soup is so delicious!! I used kale instead of spinach and also rinsed the sausage after cooking. I’ve tried this recipe with hot sausage and mild sausage and preferred the mild sausage version. Adding more red pepper is tastier than the hot sausage, in my opinion. Definitely a keeper and tastier than the restaurant version.

Made this many times now, always turns out yummy. Usually use spinach but sometimes other greens. I don't like all the separate steps and sometimes combine which seems to work fine still. Cream is best. Half & half or whole milk just don't add the richness it needs to complete it.

I like this soup so much!  I had it at a restaurant and it was a little on the thin side, but when your making it yourself, things like that are easily changed.  The only changes I made was to add a little more potato, sausage, a little less of the red pepper (to much spice is not my friend) and left out the kale or spinach.  I didn't like the kale used in the restaurant's version.  Whenever I got a bite of it in the soup, it made for a very unappetizing texture and taste so I'll get my veggies at a different meal.

Awesome.!!  Only substituted full oil coconut milk for heavy cream,  for allo you paleo, non dairy, etc... diets. Good and easy recipe.  Also my wife used kale instead of spinach.

I have made this soup many times, the family loves it! Like others I substitute spinach for kale.  I add a few more pinches of red pepper flake because we like things a bit hot hot hot!

I had spinach in the freezer so was excited to see that's what this recipe called for. I used 10 ounces of mild Italian sausage but wish I'd used the whole pound. My picky 3 year old asked for seconds and ate most of it! So so good. I used swansons reduces fat cream that I had on hand. Looking forward to leftovers for lunch.

This was such a flavorful soup! I did as others suggested - used half of the potatoes, omitted the bacon, added 1 tsp. fennel seeds to the sausage when cooking, and substituted kale for the spinach. Instead of the mild sausage and red pepper flakes I used 1/2lb mild sausage and 1/2lb hot sausage. This gave the perfect amount of heat, for me, but the red from the hot sausage did give the soup a red tinge, which was a little off-putting. Next time I may use the mild sausage/red pepper flakes instead. Also, the soup was a little more liquidy than I think it should have been. That may have been me, as I was worried about overcooking the potatoes and maybe could have let it all simmer longer to become creamier. All in all it was a delicious soup and one my family voted as a keeper. Thank you for posting it!

Love this soup! My go to favorite in the winter.  I use a HOT sausage, and leave out the red pepper flakes.  I like that it makes the broth a little spicy.  I use cream or milk, whatever's handy, and don't even notice the difference.

Delicious!  I used hot Italian sausage and omitted the red pepper flakes.  Substituted half and half in place of heavy cream.  Threw in some fresh thyme.  The flavor of this soup was wonderful!  Also, I am a potato lover so next time I will add extra.  COMFORT FOOD!!!!   Thanks for the great recipe to share with my family and friends!!!

Delicious soup! Used hot Italian sausage and no chili flakes.  
I left out the bacon and didn't miss it one bit. I cubed the potatoes instead of slicing them. Used half and half instead of heavy cream. Kale instead of spinach for more texture.... and low sodium chicken broth. A great easy to make soup and it tasted fantastic. Will definitely make again!!!

We loved this soup!  It tastes like our favorite soup at Olive   Gardens.  I used low-sodium chicken broth and substituted
low-fat evaporated milk in place of the heavy cream.  After browning the onions and sausage, I placed them in a colander and ran hot water over them to reduce the fat. I have made this recipe several times and by tweaking it I don't feel so guilty about fixing it.  You can also use the packaged pre-cooked and crumbled bacon to save time.  I also cut the potatoes into small cubes instead of slicing them.  I'm planning on making this often.

So good and easy. I skipped some steps and reduced the amount overall since cooking for one. So, sliced up one mild Italian sausage and 2 slices of bacon together along with red chilli flakes. When they were almost cooked added diced onion and garlic. A few minutes later added 4cups chicken broth - low sodium- brought to a boil. Then added small bite size chunks of potato (not slices but chunks and only from one potato in this reduced size recipe. When they were cooked added spinach and splash of half and half. Served with sour dough bread and butter. Made 3-4 servings.  Yum! Took only 20-30 minutes from start to finish max. Will make again.

This soup is a no-brainer.  However, I sub the bacon withcl pholled Panchetta.  Kale over Spinach for sure.

I was going to make Italian Wedding Soup and this happened to pop up.  This is one of my favorite soups--ever!  My subs (only because I was going to make Italian Wedding Soup)  I use escarole-instead of kale or spinach.  I didn't add bacon.  I sliced the potatoes too thin and they literally melted away--but it's so yummy  I'm going to cube up more potatoes and add them. I waited to add salt to the end--wasn't sure how salty it would be and turned out 100% fine this way.   Made my own stock,  and I caramelized the onions and garlic and it's alllllllll delicious  I will be making this forever.  Just upped the flakes and I added both hot sausage and sweet and just a half a cup of cream.

This was AMAZING!  Hubby and my mother in-law said it was the best soup they have ever had!  Even my 3 year old liked it!  The only thing I did differently was use fresh kale instead of spinach and only used a small portion of the red pepper flakes.

Great recipe, I did modify it with turkey sausage and bacon since I don’t eat pork. I also used kale in places of spinach for a nicer texture. Otherwise, I followed the recipe and will make it again!

This is sooooo good even with my substitutes. I no longer drink dairy and used almond milk. So my soup doesn’t have the creamy look & not as thick. I’m also reducing my carb intake & used a rutabaga instead of potatoes. They really do taste like potatoes!! I just wish they were easier to cut. I added both kale & spinach. Great recipe!!

I did what others suggested and lowered the red pepper flakes to one-half teaspoon.  My Italian sausage already was reasonably spicy, I think.  It ended up spicy, but not over the top.  I also used Half and Half rather than heavy cream.

Be sure to use mild Italian sausage.  I usually use less red pepper flakes or it can be too spicy for my taste.  I've made this several times.  It's a family favorite.

The soup was amazing! I made a few adjustments to the recipe. I used plenty of kale instead of spinach. I also omitted the bacon and cut the red pepper to 1 tsp, which still gave it a nice kick without being too spicy. I used four small russets and two medium baking potatoes. Next time, I may throw in another potato. Served it with some toasted Italian bread, and it was the perfect dinner!

I made the recipe according to the instructions, but made a few tweeks per the suggestion of other reviewers. I used 1 tsp fennel seed and used milk with 3 Tbsp of cornstarch. I also used chopped frozen kale instead of fresh. The kids prefer it bc they couldn't taste the kale like in the original soup. I just used a small amounting kale in the soup for some color. Too much can overwhelm it. I thought everything tasted great, but there was something missing. I couldn't put my finger on it, but the broth seemed a little bland. maybe if I had simmered the sausage in the broth longer or added some salt it would have been better. It makes a lot of soup so maybe after the ingredients have marinated together, it would be good. I also used low sodium broth so that may be the reason, not too sure. Overall it was still very good and I will make it again

Turned out great, really fulfilling. I didn’t use crumbled Italian sausage, instead I used Italian sausage links. Which I did make sure to rinse as others suggested with their sausage & it helps cut down on grease transfer. Cut them in half & sliced. I did leave out the red pepper flake as the sausage I believe was enough spice for me. Will add to recipe box.

This is truly delicious. I can't wait for cooler weather to enjoy it again. One modification I have made is to add about a cup of fresh-grated Parmigiano-Reggiano to this soup. Freshly-grate Romano would also work but would add a slightly different flavor. 
NOTE: I am can't see the kale substitution as I love spinach and eschew kale.

Made according to recipe (although I did use kale instead of spinach) and it was delicious, perhaps even better the second day.  Perfect amount of heat with the crushed chilies.  Will be making again...highly recommend!

Love this recipe as a base. I make it paleo-friendly by using coconut milk and sweet potatoes in place of the heavy cream and potatoes. I also sub kale for the spinach as several others have commented. I have actually never had Zuppa Toscana from Olive Garden, so I don't know if it is a good copy, but it works for me!

Man is this delicious!  I followed the recipe "almost" to a T :)   I used 8 pieces of bacon instead of 4, because...duh....bacon!  :)  I also used Kale instead of spinach because thats what I had on hand (though my friend makes it with spinach and its tasty that way too).  I also added a little bit of fennel seasoning to it.  I sliced half the potatoes thin and half thicker, so that some would break up in the soup making it thicker, but there would still be some bigger chunks.  And those were my changes.  This soup is really good with some croutons sprinkled on top if you dont have bread to serve with it and a little fresh parmesan cheese.  I will make this a regular soup in our rotation!  My 11 year old daughter loves this stuff!  Thanks for sharing!
I wanted to add that one time I replaced evaporated milk with heavy cream because I didnt have any...and that has worked out great too :)

I am rating this on the original recipe. This is a family favorite my kids beg for. My daughter is not a fan of the potatoes in it though so I switched potatoes out for squash instead. Turned out wonderful. We also add extra spinach each time we reheat leftovers (if we have any).

Don't have a dutch oven, so I didn't use one.  Left the sausage in the pot the whole time. Still turned out great and was very delicious.

Delicious as-is but so much potential to make modifications if necessary! I used 1/2 chicken and 1/2 beef broth because that's what I had on hand. Added more bacon too because who doesn't need more bacon in their life?

One of the best soups I have ever made!!! I followed the recipes for the most part, i did cut down on the amount of potatoes (personal taste) and my boyfriend does not like greens of any sort so I left them out. I will most certainly be making this again and again. TRY IT!!! It is so good!!!!

Husband and son liked it. It's peppery. So if you are not a fan of pepper, cut back n the amount of pepper.

This soup is awesome! I used what I had in the fridge so I added parmesan cheese and used turnip greens instead of spinach. It turned out to be a very delicious soup that my family asked me to make for dinner the next day.

I loved this recipe.  Outside of me adding a bit of black pepper after tasting it, it was awesome.  Next time I will try using Kale for a little more texture.  Just make sure to really drain the sausage well.  If you don't, you'll end of having to skim the extra fat off of the top before serving like I did. :o)

I made this per the instructions with the one exception of using kale rather than spinach as others suggested. This is a wonderful soup and I will be making this often.  It is simple to make and full of flavor. Thanks for sharing.

Special Note: I substituted whole milk in place of the heavy cream, the starch in the potatoes will help thicken it up. Also I used Kale, which is what the OG uses.

Came out perfect! I made 10 quarts then froze about half in 2 cup containers to have later during the month.

I make this recipe all the time.  I use hot Italian sausage and I don't add the red pepper flakes.  It has the right amount of heat & flavor.  I use kale instead of spinach as well. A favorite fall soup.

Very good - I did lighten it up somewhat. First, I used chicken sausage, 1/2 pound. Also, instead of cream I used 1 cup of 2% milk mixed with about a tablespoon of cornstarch.

I used coconut cream because I don't do cow dairy and it was fantastic.  I also don't do pork, so I used beef sausage and left out the bacon which it didn't need.  This soup turned out fantastic!  My husband and I loved it and will certainly make it again.  The broth was delicious!

I made this using swiss chard instead of spinach, and used whole milk (didn't have any cream), but it turned out great! Due to stomach issues, I used just a little sprinkle of red pepper, (wish I could eat it hotter!!) and it still tasted really good.

Loved it! Simple enough. Only thing I changed was no crushed red because it mysteriously vanished from my cabinet. Also subbed heavy cream for rice milk with arrowroot powder as a thickener, due to lactose sensitivity. Great, satisfying soup, and enough to eat from all week :) I served it with crusty dinner rolls.

Excellent. Better to use Kale. Rinsing sausage links before taking out of casings is a must. Used flour to thicken it up a little. Good stuff right here.

Excellent dish. Will definitely make again but instead of potatoes will try pasta. Overall a very tasty soup which is filling. I would just suggest to taste the broth right before adding the potatoes. Depending on one's taste you may want to add some salt.

I had beet tops I wanted to use up so chopped them up and threw them in. I've made this with frozen spinach as well if I haven't had fresh spinach handy. Good soup.

I had never had this soup at the restaurant, so I didn't know what to expect. Wow! It was delicious! Only slight changes (especially since I was cutting down on the quantity).

 I used hot Italian turkey sausage, browned it, drained it and set aside. Wiped out the skillet and cooked the bacon, drained it and set aside.  Sauted onion, then garlic. And then I threw it all into a big pot with broth and potatoes, cooked for about 30 minutes and threw in 2 C. of kale (every other recipe used kale--I have never cooked with it). Added 1/2 &1/2 after the kale wilted. I had used my mandolin to cut thin slices of russets and they held their shape. Can't wait for leftovers tonight!

It turned out so good. I had company and made this soup. I followed the directions except did not double the red chili and did not double the potatoes and there were too many next time only 1/2 the potatoes.

This soup reminds me of a soup I had at Marios in Florence IT
I made a few changes to increase the similarity.  Added about 1/4 cup boars head tavern ham, cayenne instead of red pepper flakes,  one cup paremesan cheese, baby spinach 5 oz plastic tub, 4 cups chicken broth, 4 cups chicken stock.   I used unsalted broth and stock, did not add any salt at all.   It's salty enough from the sausage, ham, bacon and cheese.   
Another change I will try next time is cannelloni beans instead of potatoes.   This soup is great and easy to personalize

Didn't really care for this. It was just alright.  Seemed very salty and just seemed to be lacking "something".  Read the reviews and wondered if it was the same soup.  I will not be making this again. Sorry

My friend's exact words: "Do you know what is better about the real restaurant version?.....Not a darned thing!!!" 
I agree. This is amazing. I only use the full amount of red pepper flakes if all of the people enjoying this soup are adults, otherwise, I use half. 
I also use kale instead of spinach.

Followed the recipe except I substituted kale instead of spinach.   I also use 1 can of full fat coconut milk instead of heavy cream. So yummy, the whole family loves this recipe!

I used half and half instead of heavy cream and double the kale (instead of spinach). Next time I'll try adding fennel and possibly substituting cauliflower for half or all of the potatoes for a low carb option as previous reviewers have suggested. Easiest soup I've ever made!

I make this frequently, but I use a whole package of bacon and kale instead of spinach. Kale holds up much better than spinach, I think, and my family loves it!

Awesome recipe!  I substituted Swiss chard for the spinach and used a little less red pepper flakes.  A little more bacon and cream.  But this was absolutely DELICIOUS!!!  My family LOVED it!  YUM!!!

This is a great recipe, definitely a do-over!  It's fast and easy to make, and tastes better than the restaurant.  Don't slice your potatoes too thin, or they will disintegrate during cooking.  I used russet potatoes (unpeeled), Johnsonville Hot Italian sausage links (sliced) and Swanson chicken broth.  The hot sausage, combined with the red pepper flakes, gives the soup a wonderful spicy flavor.  I also used Kale, instead of spinach.  Absolutely a winner.

This is the most delicious soup I've ever had! I've been making it every week just for me and sometimes guests. My vegetarian husband can't have any, so sad. I wish he could have some too as he hears my guests going on about how amazing the soup is.
It's a keeper!

I made sure to purchase all the ingredients and follow to the letter.  Normally i substitute if i am missing an ingredient.  It turned out very good but I slightly over cooked the potatoes as they where softer than I would like.

Delicious! The only revision I made is that I used Kale instead of Spinach. My family loved it and said it's just like when we go to a restaurant (and even better as the homemade version has obviously more meat/sausage than what is served in restaurants). Served with Italian bread and salad. Will make again!!

This was great! I didn't have fresh spinach, so I cooked frozen spinach in olive oil and then added it. The red pepper flakes flavor of the soup was a little too strong for my spiciness-intolerant tastebuds, but my spicy-food-loving husband liked it. He kept raving about the soup!

This soup was delicious! I didn't use bacon and used far less red pepper flakes, and I added graded carrots for some extra vegetable. I also substituted the spinach with kale. Still a fantastic soup that my husband and I loved and there were lots of leftovers for workday lunches!

My family loved it! It was perfect except the bouillon I used was salty, so I added more water. More potatoes, kale instead of spinach. It was a success for me and I am not the best cook.

This really is a spot on copy of the OGs recipe!  My boys all love it!  This is my second time making this....I have to double it because it goes so fast.  I use the kale because it holds better. 
Thank you for this recipe!  Note:   If you are using the larger baking size potatoes, you will only need about 3-4.

This is a favorite in our house. We usually have it once a week. Made it with kale instead of spinach! Amazing!

Very good flavor! Hubby said it was like a "man's potato soup" with all the meat. I would prefer less sausage but that's just me. I didn't have heavy cream on hand so used milk and cornstarch to thicken. Will make again.

Delicious! I used kale instead of spinach and only 1 teaspoon of red pepper flakes. It was still pretty spicy for my family and I, but we all thought it was better than the restaurant version! Oh, and I did follow the video's instructions to remove the bacon and then add it back at the same time as the sausage.

I signed up to the site just to review this recipe.  I've made it several times over the last couple years, always returning to this site for the basic recipe ingredients, and I've been making minor tweaks here and there to try different things.  First of all, if you're new to cooking, don't be daunted.  This is super easy to make, doesn't take all day, and the people you serve will definitely love it!  It's very much worth the effort!

My tips below are just what I've learned from the people I've served this to:

The first thing I've found is USE GOLDEN POTATOES.  Thinly sliced, the texture of these, and the lower starch content, is preferable.  Russet potatoes are cheaper.  But you'll be happier with golden potatoes.  Use 7-8 golden potatoes, depending on size, over the 6 russets, since they're smaller.

Second, buy mild ground sausage.  Don't buy links unless you want to cut away the "skin" and pull out the meat one link at a time.  I say mild because not everyone likes spicy.  I do, but my kids don't.  It's easier to adjust the spice with the added crushed red pepper flakes.  Speaking of which, if you forget to add those flakes to the sausage while cooking, they can be added to the onions while cooking those.  No difference in the end result.  Start with a smaller amount of flakes and adjust upwards next time you cook if you can handle it.

Third, nix the bacon, but do use bacon fat for cooking the onions & garlic.  The actual bacon doesn't affect a large pot of soup so m

This is our favorite Zuppa Toscana recipe. We use lots of homegrown kale in ours.  I used a pint of half and half instead of half pint of heavy cream and saved a few bucks without any effect on flavor.

Very easy to put together and very tasty.  I added green beans because I didn't have spinach and I doubled the meat because my family likes a crowded soup.  The flavor was very good.  I'd use less pepper flakes if feeding kids or those who don't like spicy.

I thought this was great. I didn't change anything in this recipe (other than doubling everything so we would have leftovers). I was surprised that I didn't taste the salt, given the amount of chicken stock. This is a pretty hearty soup, so definitely filling. Plenty of heat, but I found it to be subtle not overwhelming. Will definitely make again! Thanks for the recipe.

Made it once with bacon, the other time without.  Both times I used turkey sausage and kale.  No spinach.  Red potatoes instead of Russets.  Added grated Parmesan to the broth.  Never had leftovers.  Served with garlic bread sticks.  Perfectly Delicious!

So delicious!! I left out the red pepper because I don't like spicy foods, and it ended up having plenty of flavor in my opinion. I used kale instead of spinach, and ground turkey (I seasoned it with Italian seasoning, salt and pepper) and turkey bacon. And to cut carbs I only used 2 large potatoes and added a bag of cauliflower.

So delicious!  I'm vegetarian and my husband isn't, so I omitted the bacon and cooked the sausage separately.  I used a bag of red potatoes and left the skin on and smashed about half of them after they were done.  I also used kale instead of spinach and we loved it!!

Okay I'll admit that I had never had the Olive Garden soup before, but even though I liked all the ingredients in this recipe, when it came together it didn't do it for me. It was a pretty watery soup with a gritty and slimy texture. Others though who had had the soup before loved it!

This really is a perfectly balanced recipe, with the exactly right amount of spiciness working with together with the cream. And the texture combination of the Italian sausage with the spinach (and I like to add leeks) is equally amazing.  
Definitely a household favorite!

Very tasty. Don't forget the red pepper and don't add more than the 1/4 teaspoon. I added kale. It definitely gives it extra flavor. My husband loved this! I subbed the potatoes for rutabaga so it would be low carb. I also added mushrooms. Delish!

Use hot italian sausage (decased), add tsp fennel to sausage.  Used 5 good sized potatoes cut in small and large sizes to thicken soup.  Potatoes cooked in under 10 minutes so watch the time.  Use KALE, added last few minutes of cooking, and dont be shy.  I used caution with the amount at first but ended up adding more!

This recipe was so easy and extremely tasty. I used Johnson's Ville Mild Italian Sausage, and knowing that it is salty to begin with, I used Campbell's less salt chicken broth. I also used Kale instead of spinach. The soup turned out fantastic, just like the original recipe from the Olive Garden. I have already made this again for a dinner party. Everyone raved about it. Thanks for the recipe!

I used hot Italian sausage and used kale instead of spinach, as others have suggested.  Very good flavor and the kale holds up better to reheating than spinach.  Next time I will add New Mexico green chili, but here in NM, we add green chili to everything including breakfast, lunch, dinner and soups.  The cream will cut the heat of the chili, but leaves the flavor.

I used Kale instead of spinach, it tastes exactly like the soup at the restaurant. Instead of mixing the Kale in the soup, de-steam the Kale and place it in soup bowl and ladle soup over it. You can freeze this soup as well, you may have to add cream when you re-heat it.

i've made the soup twice and it is one of my new favorites. The first time I included the red pepper flakes and it was too hot for my kids. Second time I left the red pepper flakes out. it was still just as good. i used spinach instead of kale and was very happy with it

Great flavor, but too spicy.  Next time, I will reduce the crushed red pepper to 1/2 tsp.  I also used less potatoes (four instead of six.)  I will make it again!

I followed this recipe almost exactly and it was delicious! The only change I made was to use bullion cubes and water to equal the amount of broth called for in the recipe. I rarely follow a recipe this closely and I'm glad I did for this one. There is no need to add or change anything. It's perfect as is!

Love this. I also used kale and to cut back on fat, I. used fat free half-and-half versus the heavy cream. I did use less potatoes and a little less sausage. It came out just great . oh by the way the hot pepper gives it a good zip. I'm going to try freezing some, as someone said it was easy to freeze. That way I can have some on hand when I want it.

Used kale instead of spinach as well and it was delicious.  I used 3 russet potatoes and it was a little too much.  Would be better if the recipe specified an amount in weight or volume.

Delicious soup!  I didn't have heavy cream, so I used half and half instead.  I also thickened the soup with cornstarch.  It makes a large batch, so I was able to freeze half of it for another night.

I liked it, but I made a few easy tweeks. First, I emmitted the bacon, and used kale instead of spinach. The flavor was definitely not complete without salt and pepper.  Next I make this, I'm not going to use as much potatoes and sausage because I want to taste more of the broth and less of the "stuff."

Yum. I highly suggest starting with less red pepper flakes. I used 1/2 teaspoon and it was just right for my husband and me who like a kick, but definitely too spicy for my kiddos. Next time I will probably use just 1/4 teaspoon. Additionally, I omitted the potatoes and added tortellini. I cooked the onions/garlic/sausage/bacon all together, then added the broth and cooked the tortellini for a few minutes, then added cream, heated through, then added spinach just before serving. Delicious, quick, and easy. I will certainly make this again, thanks for the recipe!

Very good! My husband said it tastes just like OG's zuppa. The potatoes overcooked slightly, but it wasn't bothersome.  I also used kale instead of spinach. I had a baguette that I dunked in the soup while it was cooling off. Good stuff!

This soup is wonderful and perfect for a cold winter day. I used a garlic basil sausage from a local Italian market, which really added some nice flavor. The only changes I made were to use endive instead of spinach and milk and cornstarch instead of heavy cream. I'll definitely be making this again!

This was extremely easy to make. As another review stated, it is a very forgiving recipe. I used the kale instead, heavy whipping cream (all the store had) and the smaller of the two containers of broth I purchased (not paying attention) was beef broth. It turned out great. It was not to salty as some said, maybe it was the bacon or brand of broth they used.
I will be making it again soon.

Made this tonight and the SO loved it, I didn't have heavy cream so I substituted a mix of cream and Philadelphia herb and garlic cream cheese, it turned out great! We don't use bacon so often so I removed that from the recipe but it's an amazing soup will definitely make it again.

Loved it as it was, but added twice the sausage, making one spicy instead of the red pepper, left out the bacon, and used kale the second time.  Just like that restaurant.

I made this recipe with a spiced italian sausage - it was the only kind I had - and so I skipped the red pepper.  It was amazing.  Hearty, delicious and flavorful.  It is the definition of comfort food.  Absolutely wonderful to freeze in tupperware and defrost later.

Actually I like it better than what they have at Olive Garden.  I always put in lots of real cream!  So much richer.

AMAZING. I needed an Italian soup to go with our dinner party theme and it was a hit!
I made a few changes - I used spicy sausage and omitted red pepper flakes. After the sausage was done I rinsed thoroughly in HOT water to get rid of a lot of the grease. I made way less than the recipe called for and it was just too much for 4 people. I used 3 cans broth and only 3 potatoes. I also only used 1/2 a cup of cream. I used kale instead of spinach; added the kale just before serving and it was perfect, still a little crunch! Next time I will use low sodium broth and let the guests add to taste.

Easy and VERY delicious!.  I used hot Italian sausage, so skipped the red pepper flakes.  I also wanted a little more broth, so used 2 1/2 quarts chicken broth (10 cups/approx 80 ozs).  The potatoes I used were pretty "fat", so I peeled them and cut them in half lengthwise before slicing them.  Perfect!  Will definitely make again and again!

I made it with Kale instead of spinach and since no one in my family likes fresh onions I used a packet of Lipton onion soup mix in its place. I actually made a mistake and put too much cream, but it turned out really really good!!

Recommendations:  
1. Cook Bacon until VERY CRISP almost burnt, the softer the bacon the soggier it will be in the soup when you eat it.
2. Stir in sausage 1st and let it sit for a minute BEFORE adding cream, this will allow the grease and any orange spice to rise to the top -spoon it out THEN add the cream - or else your cream will be greasy/orange.
3. If you are not a lover of cream - use a lighter cream or use less cream - I wish I had added 1/2 cup then slowly added until the amount was right. 1 cup was too creamy for me.
4.  Do not mix in the greens - instead I bought bundles of kale and spinach and allowed my family to pick their greens of choice, put their greens in their bowl and add the hot soup on top. The soup is so hot it will cook the greens to tenderness in their bowls and this allows for kids who don't want greens as well as offering variety!  
P.S. - we like spicy food- I used HOT spicy sausage as well as double the asked pepper flakes and this was still considered mild in our house. My kids were adding hot sauce to it - go figure.

Very tasty. I didn't have a Dutch oven so I improvised. I don't know if I did something wrong but this recipe isn't as good as some others I have tried on here. I added onion powder, garlic powder and more chicken broth.

Great soup. I only added half cup of half-and-half and kale. I used spicy Italian sausage and low sodium broth and it came out fine! No extra salt needed. It is thin but I don't mind thats how it is at the restaurant.

Excellent.  Perfect for a cold winter night. I didn't make any changes. I always follow the recipe exact the first time. No adjustments needed. Spinach /kale who cares both are good for you . Used spinach. I did eye the patatos and onion as sizes differ .

Soooo good! I followed a few other reviews and used kale instead of spinach. I also used 1 cup of 2% milk with 2T of cornstarch mixed in instead of heavy cream. I would have used cream if I had it but this was a very good substitute.  Thank you for adding a new dish to our menu.... love it!

I LOVE THIS RECIPE! My husband is always begging me to make it. I make it everytime family from Mexico comes as well. It's very easy to make as well!

The only thing I would change from this recipe is the amount of bacon grease used.. I actually wouldn't use any of the bacon grease at all! Yes, you should still cook your bacon to add the bacon bits to your soup but that grease is not needed. The sausage already has enough grease for flavor (even after draining).

Also, I use kale instead of spinach. Don't get me wrong, I love spinach with almost everything and anything but the kale is crunchier.

This recipe will tolerate a lot of adaptations and still be excellent! I used kale instead of spinach. There are many different types of sausage that would work. You can turn the heat up or down by adjusting the amount of pepper flakes added. I have made this several times and each time it tastes a little different but my family just loves it.

This is delicious! Since we don't use heavy cream at our house, I stirred a tablespoon of flour into the meat/veg mixture before adding broth, then used 2% milk. The flavor was great with lower fat. I also only used 4 potatoes and the consistency was good as well.

i didn't add the bacon and it was still very delicious. I added spicey sausage versus the sweet. My husband loved it and wants me to make it again so this is definitley a keeper.

I used hot Italian sausage instead adding red pepper flakes and added zucchini.  Delicious! 
I will make this again and again!

This is a darn good replication of Olive Garden's potato soup. It does depend on what type of sausage you used though. I like the sweet Italian style sausage . Due to the ingredients used, it does turn out salty so I would hold off on adding any additional salt till the product is finished.  
To make this more harty, chunky stewed tomatoes and some beans are added. SOOOO GOOOD.

Very similar to that Italian food chain restaurant's if you replace the spinach with kale.  Be sure to rinse the meat after cooking to prevent too much grease and salt.

Excellent! I opted to use kale and omit the bacon as others had stated in their review.  This soup hit the spot and is perfectly filling. Even my husband liked it and he preaches "Soup isn't a meal!" ;)

I have made this soup at least  5 to 6 times a year... I don't measure at all because some ingredients I like more than others... Soo what I do to mine is I use a full pound of thick cut bacon, 3/4 white onion and a lb of mild sasuage... 4 potatoes cut in different sizes... I do not add any greens cause I don't like them... I do recommend you rinse the sasuage in hot water soo that you don't have that orangeish layer of grease when you refrigerate the soup....

I'm not sure why all the 5-star reviews. It wasn't bad, but I was expecting a lot more based on the reviews. Make sure you have a flavorful sausage, and if your chicken broth is no-salt, you'll want to add some salt in the cooking process. I would also double the bacon.

Best soup we've ever had! 1 tsp fennel does make a difference. I used sweet Italian sausage, only 1/4 tsp of crushed red pepper flakes, kale, only 3/4 cup heavy cream, sliced 2 potatoes extra thin to make it thick and 3 moon-sized sliced.  Needed 1-2 more potatoes though!

Turned out great! So much flavor for not adding hardly any seasoning. I didn't use much red pepper flakes because the little people in my family don't like too much heat, but I'm sure the full amount would be tasty.  I also only did half an onion. I added the cooked bacon in last and used kale (like the famous restaurant uses) instead of spinach. I really think the dutch oven is key in holding the flavors from the sausage and bacon. I overcooked the potatoes a bit because I let the soup simmer for a few hours while at a volleyball game, but everyone still loved it. Will be making again in the future!

This was very good. I used hot Italian sausage and turkey bacon. I added about 2 tsp crushed fennel seeds and used 3 large handfuls of chopped kale in place of the spinach. This is going into our normal Fall/Winter rotation. Served with gluten free cornbread and honey. Delish!

Really great! I used kale instead of spinach and next time I will probably leave out the bacon because I hardly noticed it was in there. I will probably also make a batch without the cream to can next time.

My husband has been making this for me for years, but this week it was my turn to make it and I forgot to have him write down the recipe before he went to work. This recipe looked to be the same as his, so I went with this one. It turned out to taste nearly identical to how he makes it, except it was a little on the salty side. He doesn't add as much chicken broth as this recipe calls for and uses water instead to keep the salt content down a little. I also used kale instead of spinach because thats just what I had on hand and that's what we usually add to it anyway. Great recipe!

This is a great recipe. I made a few personal changes but I think the recipe would've been fine as it was written. I substituted kale for spinach, used low sodium for half of the chicken broth, cut the cream to 1/2 cup, and used red potatoes. I will definitely make again, next time I will add more red potatoes. Awesome recipe!!

My family enjoyed this but we all wished it had more potatoes so next time I will add a few more.  I didn't add the bacon but did use some leftover bacon drippings. Also, I only used 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes and it was the perfect amount for us. We will be making this again.

This is almost a 5 for me, but a few things in the directions made it more difficult than it needed to be.  #1 I wouldn't cook the bacon with the onions... onions cook faster than bacon and you are to remove the bacon from the onions before  adding the garlic.  But now you bacon has pieces of onion on it.  I would cook the bacon in the microwave and use the bacon grease to cook the onion and garlic.  #2 I could cube the potatoes vs. slice.  Although one of my guests loved the slices - thought it was different.  If you go with the slices be sure to break up the potatoes before serving.  There's not much broth so don't be shy about adding more water and or chicken broth.

I used spicy Italian sausage and omitted the red pepper flakes.  I have made this with spinach and with kale.  I like it both ways but prefer the kale a little more because I like the crisper texture.  This is an easy recipe and warm and comforting soup.   I serve with crusty bread.

Doubled the recipe and upped the amount of broth used. I also made a roux to slightly thicken the sauce. Used spicy Italian sausage, so no pepper flakes, and kale instead of spinach. Everyone in my family loved it and I will definitely make it again.

Fantastic! My husband is a big game hunter and we recently made a large batch of Elk Italian sausage. Always looking for new recipes to use our meat in, as big game makes up probably 98% of our meat consumption i decided to try this. And it was very good!  I used kale in place of spinach and cut back the amount of potatoes (using only 4).  New favorite in this house and will be making again!

I omitted the chili flakes (picky eaters who won't do spicy) and also bacon to cut back on saltiness (sodium-sensitive household). We did use regular pork sausage and seasoned the meat then broth while cooking with Italian seasoning.
At the end, about 2 TBS of sour cream was added with a generous shake of Parmesan cheese.
The picky eaters here ate it and even had seconds!

Delicious! This turned out great! I used a little less broth than it said and added a bit more whipping cream to make it creamier. Next time I might use hot sausage to spice it up.

We used kale instead of spinach. We have made it three times now and my kids love it. Today I made a massive batch to freeze for a quick Meal. I'm pregnant and this soup really helps with nausea. I bet it is great for sickness of any kind including sinuses. ;) 10 stars from me!!!

I love this soup so much, even more than Olive Garden's version. I have made it countless times with very few changes. I substitute a dash of cayenne for the red pepper flake since I prefer that taste. I also drain the onion on a paper towel after sautéing it in the bacon grease because I feel like it ends up a little too greasy without doing so, even after draining most of it the first time. I also use kale instead of spinach, and I only add it into individual servings instead of the whole pot to keep it from becoming too wilted with reheatings. Awesome recipe!

This is almost dead on the product you get at the '"popular restaurant". Made it twice and few things I altered are use kale instead of spinach and use Italian Sausage w/red pepper and caramelized onions, (New York Brand?)  I used red potatoes and then Yukon gold the second time. Cooking Technique is good and measurements are good. My husband requested this tonight and I thought it deserved a review. So good, we are stuffed!

The recipe as written was fine, but it was really great after some modifications. I've had the original version at the famous restaurant that shall remain nameless. Based on that, I left out the bacon and substituted kale for the spinach. I know the original version has sliced potatoes, but they're so unwieldy while trying to eat your soup with a spoon. I recommend cubing the potatoes, but you may have to let them cook longer.

This soup is so much better when you use spicy Italian sausage rather than the sweet sausage + red pepper flakes. Also, the amount of potato in this recipe is WAY off - we only needed about 3.5 medium-sized potatoes. We ended up having to almost double the liquid to make up for the huge volume of solid ingredients. I suggest measuring out the liquid ingredients first. Then, while you're chopping potatoes, just keep an eye on your final volume and decide "does this look like an absurd quantity of potatoes for this amount of liquid?" If yes, then STOP! Wish I had told my husband this before assigning him to chop vegetables... I ended up with a mountain of potatoes piled up in a pathetically small amount of soup.

After the modifications I described, this was a huge hit with my picky family.

This really is "Super-Delicious"! Here are my tips :) First,  make sure to add the bacon at the end (with the sausage) or it will be soggy/ bland.  Second, use kale instead of spinach. Third, I used one 32 ounce container of  Swanson's low sodium chicken broth, 3/4 cup water, and 3/4 cup heavy whipping cream (there would have been way too much broth and not enough substance).  And finally, I prefer to use red potatoes.  With these adjustments it is a sure crowd pleaser and tastes just like the real thing! Enjoy!!

I really like it. I'm pretty good with soup, so I knew I would have to adjust the 6 potatoes. I made sure they were rather small and it worked fine. I used organic russet and sliced on the very thin setting of my Cuisineart food processor. They fell apart at 18 minutes, so next time I may use a different potato since I prefer this thinness. I added red pepper flakes at the end. I used 2% milk and though it tasted great, it wasn't as "white" and pretty as I would have liked. I definitely knew I didn't want spinach in this soup so I used bagged pre-chopped kale and tore it into smaller pieces. About two handfuls. Be careful with the potatoes. Use smallish ones. Very delicious. Could omit bacon for sure.

This soup is so delicious! Before I made it, I read some of the reviews & decided to make some changes. I added 1 tsp of  fennel & changed the spinach to kale. I kept the bacon but will probably drain some of the drippings next time. It didn't affect the taste or the consistency but made my waistline a little worried. (Got to keep an eye on my girlish figure. ??) I also paired it with a breadstick recipe. Great for dipping in this amazing broth. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. My family loved it. So tasty!

Okay I did rate it with a 5 because it is definitely a good recipe. I made a few changes with mine only because I didn't have everything that it called for. For a start I used regular Jimmy Dean sausage in a tube, 1 lb as the recipe called for. Once browned, I sliced half of a large red onion, a whole onion would have been fine as well, I was just lazy, so only cut up half. Then I sliced 4 medium sized yellow gold potatoes and threw them in the large skillet. I used 2 chicken and herb bullion cubes with 6 cups of scalding hot water to help dissolve them. If you'd like, you can do this earlier in the recipe so that it has sufficient time to dissolve. I did not have any broth or any unthawed chicken to make broth, which actually worked great, and I'm not a huge bullion user. Cook on medium for about 10-15 minutes. In the meantime, cook your bacon. I used 3 slices of Hormel Black Label thick sliced bacon (any kind will do). I microwaved it on high for 4  minutes. Yes people, I microwaved the bacon, lol. I poured what little drippings that came off of the bacon into the pot after crumpling the bacon and adding it as well. I did not have any kale or fresh spinach on hand so I substituted a fourth of a head of cabbage, approx. 2 cups. I thinly sliced the cabbage and added it and 1 cup of half and half milk (I used half and half instead of heavy whipping cream, I was fresh out). I let that simmer for about another 10-15 minutes. I also used garlic pepper seasoning to taste

My hubby doesn't like onion, so I used one leek (light green and white parts), and I put the pepper flakes in with it. I used 2 boxes of organic chicken broth instead of the cans and the uncured bacon. I also used golden potatoes peeled and kale instead of spinach, chopping it small without ribs and throwing it in with the potatoes. Yummy!

PLEASE NOTE: The recipe should instruct that the bacon be removed and set aside after frying. Then added to the soup along with the sausage at the end, (or reserved as a garnish, table side).  The soup is delicious!!! However, as many reviewers have noted, kale may be the best choice for this recipe over spinach.

This was a fabulous recipe which our family will make again often. This is one of my favorites at the restaurant, but I prefer making it myself and taking my own ingredients into account. I added about twice as much spinach and cut the cream down a little, and it was still excellent.

I've made this recipe three times now.  My family and I can't get enough of it.  I followed the recipe exactly (except adding more potatoes and spinach)!  I place everything in the slow cooker.....leave for my kids soccer/basketball games.  When we return....it's time to EAT!  So delicious.  Can't say enough about this recipe.

My husbands favorite soup, similar to Olive Garden's Zuppa. I have used Italian ground turkey and kale in my recipe and it is delicious.

This was excellent, just the right amount of kick.... I had no idea how much a bunch of spinach was so I guessed, using two big handfuls, next time I will use more.

This soup was very easy and good except for one thing: it was incredibly salty. I used bouillon cubes instead of stock. I saved the soup by adding more water until it tasted just slightly too salty, but now I know I will be adding just 2-3 cubes of bouillon for this entire dish versus 5. For anyone using stock, I would recommend half stock and half water, or low sodium stock.

However, once I fixed the salt issue, this soup was delicious! I love that it uses ingredients I generally have anyway, and that it's a one pot dish! As someone with a small kitchen, decreasing the amount of dishes is a must. It was also easy to monitor because of that, and I am generally on calls or multitasking while making dinner. My only other adjustment was using lactose free nonfat milk instead of cream as I am borderline lactose intolerant.

My family loves this recipe.  We like it spicy so we go ahead and use spicy sausage.  Good, thick sliced bacon is really important or else it just gets lost, applewood bacon adds a lovely flavor, too!  We use kale rather than spinach for the flavor and break it apart into rather small pieces, make sure not to let any stems in.  6 potatoes is fine as far as chunks are concerned, but we like to mince another potato or two and let it cream into the broth, it gives the broth a lot of texture.  Either way, make sure the potatoes are starting to break down before moving on to the cream.  And SOME people need to learn how to account for salt rather than blaming the recipe.  This recipe already has bacon, so keep that in mind when choosing your broth.

Loved this recipe! I made a few minor changes (which is why I rated 4 not 5). Because so many reviews said how much this soup made, I ended up only using half of what it called for the veggies and meat but using 5-5.5 cups of broth and 3/4 whipping cream. I also used kale instead of spinach And I only had kielbasa so I ended up using that instead of ground sausage. It turned out amazing, definitely keeping this recipe!

This soup is amazing and tasty with just the right amount of kick! I made a few minor adjustments.  I used kale instead of spinach.  I also added in an extra 1/4 cup
Of heavy cream (I didn't want to waste the little bit left in the container).  I also added an extra two slices of bacon and two sweet Italian sausages along with the hot ones, which I used instead of mild. You would think this would make the soup too spicy...it did not. My husband us not a big soup drinker but I couldn't keep him away from this soup! So excellent! I'm about to make more! My husband is picky so I'm thrilled!

I've made this soup probably 20 times. I love it, my family loves it, friends we've shared this with love it. I have the recipe memorized in case I ever get the urge to make it out of the blue.

And another thing, I never put any salt in this. I think the bacon and the sausage provide a lot of the flavor. I also like to use kale instead of spinach for the almost crunchy texture.

I was determined to give this less than 5 stars because I thought no salt, no sugar, no chocolate no way it could be as good as the reviews say.  But it actually is very good, easy to make, pretty healthy and very low carb without the potatoes. So 5 stars it gets.   I made without the potatoes & used kale instead of spinach but next time I will try with cauliflower.

This soup is great!  The only changes I made were to use low-sodium broth, and kale instead of spinach.  I only needed 3 servings, so I cut the recipe in half.  If you're doing the same, consider using only 2 potatoes (or 3 smaller potatoes) as the soup thickened up considerably once it cooled.

This recipe was GREAT. I've made it twice and got love from the ones who don't think soup should be a meal. They stood corrected! The only addition is more stock, but that is my personal preference. I like a LOT of broth in my soups:)

I used kale and cauliflower instead of spinach and potatoes and although I used all and then some of the red pepper flakes, the flavor was a little bland. I added salt and white pepper, then shaved some parmesan over the top and it was more interesting. I think it will probably have married by tomorrow and have better flavor.

This was very good.  We were concerned about it being salty so we were careful with seasonings.  It turned out well.  We didn't have enough potatoes so we added a can of great northern beans.  My children gave it two thumbs up.

This soup is incredibly easy, fast and delicious. The only way to mess it up is to add too much water!! I used water and chicken bouillion instead of broth. To avoid it being too watery, add water as you go. I only used 6 cups of water (the recipe calls for 8) and it was a bit watery for my taste but I just boiled it down. 
I tweaked the recipe a bit. I used 5 chicken bouillon cubes with 6 cups of water and instead of italian sausage I used Italian-seasoned Jenny-O ground turkey from the supermarket. I fried up the turkey and then baked it at 300 degrees  for 20 minutes to crumble it. I also added kale instead of spinach. Since I omitted the sausage, it wasn't as salty as I like so I included salt as well.

didnt have bacon so left out; used kale instead of spinach (use a lot since it gets smaller when cooked); quartered red potatoes; offered pepper flakes on side so children can eat; was a bit salty so might try low sodium broth next time, along with cutting some fat by substituting milk for part of the heavy cream.

Excellent soup.  Super Easy.  I chose to use kale instead of spinach.  Delish.

I made this soup for a teacher luncheon, trying to do something different from the usual,... It is one of my favorites soups from the Olive garden, so I decided to give it a try, and it was DELICIOUS!!! Even one of the teachers  call me to compliment the soup and ask for the recipe!!!... I made the chicken broth one day before, and i couldn't find italian sausage, so i bought "original flavor" and added two tablespoons of Italian seasoning.

I loved this soup. However for me and my family using the mild Italian sausage we didn't need the red pepper flakes. and really could omit the bacon as it didn't really add anything to the soup. maybe it was the bacon I chose. I also used kale which I'm sure is what olive garden uses, I was very good. But all in all very very good.. have extra ingredients to make another batch..mmmmmm

Delicious family favorite! Some things I did differently: I used johnsonville hot Italian sausage (I cut the casing off and crumbled it while it cooked). I rinsed the sausage with hot water and blotted dry. I only used two (very large) russet potatoes, substituted the spinach for kale, and added a dash of black pepper and 1 1/2 teaspoon of fennel seed in addition to the listed ingredients. Served with cheesy garlic bread. Definitely a bit spicey, but my seven year old loved it regardless!

This was the first soup that I have ever made, and it came out wonderfully. I did not add all of the potatoes because it seemed like it would overwhelm it, and the only other things I did differently was add some salt and Tony chacheres. I live in Louisiana, which may explain the need for extra spice. It was so delicious, and I know I'll finally be able to impress my mother in law. Thanks!

What an easy and delicious dish.  I will definitely make this again. A complete meal in itself, served with fresh bread.

I only used a pinch of red pepper flakes, as my wife does not care for them. One can always add it to the individual serving to taste.

We used spicy sausage and added fennel seeds, substituted kale in place of spinach, and omitted the bacon. Even our pickiest eater ate it! TIP: Take meat out of the pan and place directly into a fine strainer over a bowl. Over time, the residual heat will help all the orange oil drip down into the bowl. You'll still get all the flavor, but you'll avoid the orange oil floating at the top of your soup. If you use kale, boil it for a few minutes before adding the cream. It's tough, and it needs some time to soften a bit.

This soup reminds me of the Toscana soup at Olive Garden.  I love it and my family also loved it.  I used Kale also and shallot onions to give it a good flavor.  I served it with sour dough bread and it was a hit.  I used turkey bacon instead of pork.  Best soup ever!!!

This was excellent! I halved the recipe and it made what I would consider, 4 large dinner sized portions. I added a 1/2 tsp of finely chopped lemon zest at the end which really complimented the kale without leaving a noticeable lemon flavor.

I made exactly as the recipe called for. My family all said it was better than the OG. I did use low sodium chicken broth which maybe took care of the too salty taste someone posted about. I will definitely make this soup again and again. It is a very hearty soup.

Super yummy comfort food!
We followed the recipe with the exception of only using 1/2 tsp of pepper flakes because I'm wimpy.
Next time I might add a smidge of nutmeg.
Try it, you'll love it!

WOW - was this good!  Followed recipe exactly except I substituted fat free 1/2 and 1/2 for the cream and added twice as much - snowstorm was pending and the store was sold out of cream.  Excellent soup for a cold winter day as the hot sausage and red pepper really heated me up from the inside out.  Will certainly make again!

Great recipe. I've made this soup many times in the last few years. As others have said, kale is key. Also, adding a little fennel seed really does add something that was missing from the original recipe. Also, i suggest not rinsing or blotting the sausage fat. Instead i recommend skimming . takes a bit more time and patience, but you'll get more of that great sausage flavor in the end product.

Couldn't be happier with how this turned out. Made as directed with one exception, I did use hot Italian sausage, and I got it from the meat counter at my grocery store as opposed to the prepackaged sausage. Just amazing soup and even better the next day.

Great recipe that I have made many times.  I do use Kale and I bake my italian sausage in the oven until firm then slice it thin....just so much better that way.  I also use more potatoes than called for.

Very delicious!  The only changes I made were to add good quality real bacon bits at the end with half a cup of sour cream and half a cup of heavy cream.  I find the bacon is not limp and soggy like it is if you cook the bacon in the Dutch oven at the beginning.  For a bit lighter, but just as tasty version, use one cup of half and half cream instead of heavy cream.

I loved it, tasted just like the famous resturant.  I used my grocery store brand mild sausage, only 1 teaspoon of red pepper flakes, and used low sodium chicken broth to cut down on the saltiness.  I also substituted the spinach for kale, which is what the famous resturant uses.  I will make again!  :-) Served with salad and bread.

Was super easy and SO delicious!!! My family loved it! I didn't have regular bacon on hand so substituted jalepeno-bacon which I had waiting to be used for something. Also substituted a super-food mix of spinach/kale/arugula (from Costco) instead of straight kale. Served with crusty baguette... Delicious!!! Will be making this again!

i followed the recipe except I used kale instead of spinach.  I like that I usually have these ingredients on hand but I prefer a thicker soup base.  We liked it but nobody loved it.

edit: eating the day of I'd give it 3 stars.  Eating the next day, the soup is sooooo much better and I'd give it 4 stars.  I'd still prefer  a thicker cream base though to give it 5 stars

I, like others, leave out the bacon and use kale instead of spinach.  I absolutely love this soup!   I have frozen it and would suggest freezing but leaving kale out until you decide to eat it.

Wow just like Olive Garden if you add kale instead of spinach.  Family loved it.  I add one table spoon of butter when saucetting the onions.

Taste just like Olive Gardens. I used kale. Excellent. Very spicy.  I used hot Italian Sausage and still added the red pepper.  My family loved it.

One of my absolute favourite recipes that I've found on here!! I had my inlaws over last night for supper and served this, and my father-in-law exclaimed "this is better than Olive Gardens!" It's also easy to make and it's memorized cause I love it so much!

Kale instead of spinach 
- No Bacon
- add a teaspoon of fennel
- add or subtract pepper flakes depending on your spice tolerance 

One of my husband's favorites.... and money saving since we go to the OG half as often!

I made essentially no changes to the recipe except to double it. I used medium potatoes, and a full pound of bacon (so use 1/2 lb. bacon in a single recipe). It was excellent! I will definitely make this again.

Truly one of my favorite "go-to" meals for anytime of the year, it's especially great for busy families. I make a double  or triple recipe and we eat it for 3-4 days. I know my neighbors enjoy my over cooking issues as well.  You simply can't mess this up unless you used the wrong sausage. Have to use Italian folks!!  Do yourself a favor and make  lots! Your family will thank you!!

I make this almost once a week now due to the family requesting it. I serve it with a crusty french bread  making a great dinner. I have never used spinach and have always used kale.

Super good dish, even for a dummy of a cook like me (seriously)! I was concerned about the spice from the red chili but it is nearly a 0 star spice. Without it, however, doesn't offer enough flavor. So, on my end, really great recipe! ADD black pepper! Adjust the saltiness to taste, start with less and adjust at the end. Almost like the famous restaurant for sure! So easy too. :)

Delicious. i didnt think it would be better than olive garden, but it is. i couldn't bring myself to use a whole cup off cream, so i used about 1/3 and the rest milk. used some hot italian turkey sausage and omitted bacon to help with calories. its still awesome. and of course used kale, lots of it, because i love it.

this was SO easy to make and tasted so delicious! The only 2 things I changed was that I bought low sodium chicken broth and I didn't add bacon (I didn't feel like buying a whole pack for 4 slices). Didn't miss the bacon, the flavor was all there with the sausages! We had friends over and everyone loved it, no leftovers!

Excellent! I also used kale, like many reviewers. Other than that, followed the recipe. I eyeballed the red pepper flakes and my husband thought it was too spicy, but I, loving heat, thought it was perfect!

Absolutely delicious. Have made this soup a few times now. My modifications are: spicy italian sausage (ground), NO bacon, 1 tsp of fennel as mentioned by other comments, and kale instead of spinach. Thanks for the recipe and good bye Olive Garden.

Absolutely delicious soup. The only change I think I'll do for next time is omit the bacon; this soup totally doesn't need it- there's already so much flavour going on. Also, if you don't watch the video you may be confused about the quantity of broth. It is a total of 8 1/4 c. which may explain why some felt their soup was too salty, perhaps they didn't dilute it enough. Awesome soup and good with turkey sausage if you want a lighter version.

Love this recipe. It's wonderful the way it is, but for a slightly healthier spin, I left out the bacon and used diced sweet potatoes and kale in place of the white potatoes/spinach. I also added a can of diced tomatoes, which gave it a little more bite. This is a staple!

I'm obsessed with this soup!!  I used chicken stock instead of broth and kale instead of spinach.  Yummmmm!

This really is that delicious. I added the fennel and I used Arrabbiata in place of  red pepper flakes. I added 10 oz  Italian sausage with 6 oz hot Italian sausage. I added torn kale as others have suggested and I went with cream rather than milk. Served during a soup day fundraiser. So tasty that we had a little for dinner with the addition of fresh three cheese tortellini.

Tastes great.  I changed it a bit, mostly by accident.  I sliced the potatoes paper thin using a salad shooter.  I used a hand blender to puree the potatoes once cooked which thickened the soup. I omitted the heavy cream because it was thick enough. I only used 2 slices of bacon. I would make it again this way.

I made this soup for the first time for my family and at the last minute had guests for dinner. I thought it wasn't going to be fancy enough, but it was a hit!  Everyone loved it. I didn't change a thing, except that I used venison hot Italian sausage. I served with cheesy garlic bread and I was a star!

It was great!  I always LOVE this when I eat it at "the famous restaurant" ...and this recipe tastes just like it!  It does take a bit of time, but worth it.  I followed it exactly, except I too substituted the Spinach with Kale.

I followed the recipe.  Topped the soup with freshly grated parmesan and romano cheeses.  Served with crusty French garlic bread.  Excellent.  I would definitely make this again.  It was a cool, rainy day.  The perfect evening meal.

Fantastic recipe. I always substitute hot Italian sausage and add more heat via ground red pepper, cayenne, and white pepper. My wife craves it.

Love it! Taste just like the soup from the 'restaurant' we all know and love. I replaced bacon with half a tablespoon of smoked paprika (same taste but without the fat from bacon so much healthier) and substituted kale for spinach.

Love this soup.  I do not use bacon and put less potatoes.  I also sliced one thin, so it will disintegrate in the soup and give it some more substance and the rest of the potatoes I sliced in about half an inches cubes.  Great recipe, thank you.

Very good soup, even though I made it vegetarian (without sausage). I added canned corn, which went well with kale and potatoes.  (not sure why Quick is in the title if you have to brown everything first.)

My family loves this.  I'm an eyeballer and I may have slightly overdone the red pepper, but it's awesome regardless.  I doubled the recipe and only had about 20% of the chicken stock needed, so I had to make up the rest with weak bouillon plus sub half and half for the cream.  Still great! I will sub with mini meatballs or something else next time since I'm not all about straight up sausage.

I deleted the bacon. Used half n half. It was great with Kale.
The second day I needed more  greens  so I used mustard greens ( as that was what was in the refrig) and boy that was fantastic it was a sweeter taste.

I used Jimmy Dean fully cooked turkey sausage crumbles..that way no browning the sausage and way less fat. I also omit the bacon and use half & half instead of heavy cream. So good!!

Hmmm I'm still not sure. I made it exactly as written.  Seems to lack some flavor. When it was done and I tasted it I had to add salt. Probably won't make again unless my hubby loves it.

I make this all the time but I tweak it as I do with all recipes. I use kale and  I put hot turkey sausage plus some red pepper (we like spicy) and I like to add matchstick carrots and baby portabella mushrooms for extra nourishment. Low sodium broth also and half and half instead of heavy cream. We have also made this with deer sausage and its awesome! Its our soup to make by far. Better than Olive Gardens.

I will absolutely make this again. It is delicious and loved by my family. I either make my own chicken broth or use organic Better Than Bullion paste which is so convenient. This is a great recipe and my son said it turns out better than the restaurant's. :)

I end up making this every couple months when that craving sets in. Definitely my favorite soup. As others have said, substitute the hot sausage and forgo the red pepper flakes. And kale instead of spinach is a must!

I've been wanting to make this for THEEE longest time and today was the day. I made a few changes  and like most people I had to use kale just to keep it more authentic. Second, I used spicy italian sausage which added a lot of flavor and skipped the bacon. Instead of using heavy cream I used sour cream instead and added a little italian parsley. Honey it came out PERFECT!!

A true keeper! Everybody changes something to suit their individual tastes but that's cool. I used hot Italian sausage. For the greenery, I had a bag of kale and spinach mix which worked great. And I used a bit more garlic. Other than that, I went pretty close to the recipe.

Absolutely delicious! Tweaked by using half hot/half mild sausage, used Kale instead of spinach, added Fennel. Definitely a keeper! Will be sharing with friends and family!

I have made this for years now because my friend worked at this restrant and gave me some clues of how they made it. Only use Italian sausage. No basil blend or stuff like that. Use kale not spinach. I use some heavy cream and some 1/2&1/2. I add 2% milk if needed. I also use three cans chicken broth and two cans vegetable broth. I go with the low sodium broth. Great soup I must say.

Awesome recipe. Better than the restaurant version. I followed other suggestions and used Kale instead of spinach and also fewer potatoes. I added extra broth after the cream to get the liquid to the consistency I wanted. I also added more garlic because I love garlic.  I will definitely prepare this again!!!

I replaced the red pepper with Siracha Chili Sauce that offers heat and I think more flavor.  The fennel was interesting, I don't usually us it but it adds.  Also used Low Sodium Chicken Broth.   I agree with others the Kale holds up better that Spinach.  I actually used a mix of chopped Kale, Collards & Turnip greens.  Gotta go with Wrights smoked bacon and I did boil the sauage for approx. 3 min. to get rid of some of the sodium and chemicals. ( I do this with hot dogs etc....)

I've been making this for a couple of years with the only differences being the dicing rather than slicing of the potatoes and the addition of a half a pound of fresh sliced mushrooms to the onion/garlic sauté mixture.

I've made this several times and it's one of my family's favorite soups!  I use chopped kale in lieu of the spinach but I add it when I boil the potatoes so that it has time to cook.  I also add 2 extra potatoes sliced paper thin and as they cook and break down they will thicken the soup a bit.  Very good soup!  Thank you for sharing!

I have a similar recipe using hot Italian sausage, no bacon and kale instead of spinach. It is a great soup! I've used the mild sausage with red pepper flakes when I didn't have the hot and it is great either way. Now, I'll have to see how I like it with bacon! It's gotta be good, I mean, it's BACON! ;) I think I'll stick with kale though. I feel the spinach would wilt down to nothing.

This was delicious! I didn't have any crushed red pepper flakes, so I diced up 2 chili peppers instead. I also used hot Italian sausage. I didn't have heavy cream (I can't find it here in China), so I used whipping cream instead. This is one of my new favorites.

I've never had the one from the restaurant, but this was excellent! I didn't need a lot so I halved the recipe, using two artisan sweet Italian chicken sausages that I sliced and sauteed in olive oil. Removed them and then sauteed the onions and garlic. I used one good-sized potato sliced thinly, and it was done in 10 minutes. Used milk in place of the heavy cream and added a little red pepper flakes for heat. I subbed kale for the spinach. It's good to have a bag of chopped frozen kale on hand for this purpose. You just microwave what you need; convenient and no waste. I topped the soup with some grated parmesan and chopped bacon. Thanks for the great recipe that I'm sure to make again!

Made this recipe several times. Recently, made it for Soup Night at church and it was a hit. I used reduced sodium broth and Russet potatoes. I also used kale because I didn't know how long the spinach would hold up to the heat since we serve for 1-1/2 hours. If you do use kale, remove the stems.

One of those recipes that actually tastes as good or better than the restaurant version! Although I did double the amount of Chicken stock or else most of the piqued was soaked up/evaporated during the potato cooking stage. And my normally picky children weren't bothered by the amount of spice so everyone in the family enjoyed it!

I'm sorry I didn't follow the recipe but only because I forgot to write it down and so I made it from memory of what I read. So I forgot the bacon and used kale rather than spinach and measured the other ingredients by eye. I did add Italian seasoning, black pepper and some kosher salt to taste. 

This soup I'm going to label amazingly delicious and super addictive (even though I missed the bacon). After eating nearly the whole pot myself two days ago I plan on making it again tomorrow even if it is 88 degrees out.

Thank you this is so much better than the restaurant's.

I've made it about three times. My husband loves it. To me, it tastes better than the one you can buy at the famous restaurant! I usually use milk and corn starch instead of the heavy cream because I don't like buying the cream for just one recipe. The milk and corn starch works great. I've also made my own broth with water,  adobo powder and black pepper to taste. Tasted delicious!

Made this for the second time tonight.  Tastes almost identical to the original!  I also used kale instead of spinach; and Better Than Bouillon instead of the canned broth.  As far as the potatoes, the first time I made this soup, I used a grater to cut them up like hash browns.  This time around, I used the grater to slice them thin...and cut each slice in half.  Either way turned out great.  I only used about three potatoes.

This was extremely delicious. It's been 3 weeks since I last made it and I'm planning to make it again this weekend. I only made mild tweaks to the recipes when I made it. I don't like cooked spinach, so I swapped it for kale; my husband doesn't like cream, so I left that out.

This soup is delicious. Perfect for cold winter nights. I, like other reviewers, used kale instead of spinach and I left out the crushed red pepper because I used hot italian sausage. I also used less potato. I used the little fingerling potatoes, maybe 1 LB and sliced them thin. I didn't make any other changes...I just doubled the recipe because we really can't get enough of it. For those who review it as bland, if you want to try it again, try it with hot sausage. All the flavor comes from that! It is so easy and yummy, it will now be a wintertime staple in my house.

1 29 15 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/143069/super-delicious-zuppa-toscana/ ... Halved the recipe, subbed 4c beef broth with 2c water (Hey, I was short.  ;D) Instead of fresh, I added 8oz frozen chopped spinach.  That's more than the recipe states, I would think.  Before the cream, it tasted a little too sausage-y.  After the cream, mellowed nicely.  If I make again, I'll add less meat anyway - so I can make three sausage dishes from one pound instead of two.  (I also made this ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/penne-with-spicy-vodka-tomato-cream-sauce/detail.aspx ... which I rated five stars.  :) ... In New Orleans,good italian restaurant is Irene's.

So. Good. We've tried a few Zuppa Toscana recipes before, but nothing ever tasted good enough to warrant making again. This recipe has become a new favorite. The only things I alter are the amount of potatoes, (recipe calls for 6 but we use 8 or 9 small gold potatoes, sliced very thin) and I use kale instead of spinach. If you like really spicy soup, hot italian sausage gives it more kick. It's also amazing reheated. We serve it with sour dough bread & salad.

After reading reviews, I changed up the recipe. I took the advice of other reviews and added fennel and kale. I diced the potatoes and  boiled them in the broth ect. for 35mins. I used my immersion blender to purée the potatoes to make a thick soup. I added the sausage and kale and simmered the soup for an hour. I was happy with the results, a nice thick and hearty soup.

Turned out really good! I also tweaked the recipe a bit. I browned the italian sausage with the red pepper flakes, then added the chopped onion and minced garlic. Next I removed the sausage and onion mixture and then browned six pieces of bacon in the same skillet that I browned the sausage in. I drained bacon on paper towel and then crumbled. I added crumbled bacon with about 56 oz chicken broth ( I used about 1 and 3/4 of 32 oz chicken broth cartons). Brought to a boil then added 3 large thinly sliced russet potatoes. Took about 15 minutes until potatoes were tender. Then added baby kale instead of spinach. Once kale was wilted, I stirred in sausage mixture and about 1 cup cream. Tasted and added a few pinches of salt, and more crushed red pepper. Soup was tasty but still missing something. Added about 2 tablespoons of butter to soup which added the "rich" flavor that I felt was missing. Tasted perfect. Only missing breadsticks!

Great recipe I added a teaspoon of fennel with it to give it a bit of a kick. Over all it came out wonderful especially for my first time making Zuppa. The whole family loved it. Definitely making it again.

In my opinion, this soup taste exactly like what's served at Olive Garden; in my boyfriend's opinion, it's better. Either way, great. I used gold potatoes instead of russets, which held their form better. Added 1 tsp each of sweet basil and fennel and used more bacon (maybe 6 or 7 slices), as well as 1 1/2 c of heavy cream. I also used a few extra tsp of chicken bouillon, and still thought it needed salt and pepper, but that was an easy fix to a great meal.

A quick review of the fat and calorie content led me to omit the bacon and substitute 1% milk for the cream with 3 tbsp cornstarch as another reviewer suggested. I also used only 4 medium potatoes which was plenty. I had frozen spinach and used about half of a 10 oz package

Absolutely delicious! This is my fiancée's favorite soup from the O.G & he loves that it tastes JUST like it. I did feel like 6 potatoes would be too much so I used 4 instead, cut them thicker, & did not cook them all the way in the chicken broth but instead let them finish cooking during the heating process of the heavy whipping cream and sausage so that they wouldn't crumble at the end. I used Kale (instead of spinach) and also added it at the time of heating everything through.

I prepared a large pot of this soup for my Sunday school class of about12 people and it was a hit. There wasn't any leftovers of this soup.  I opted to use Kale instead of spinach and I used Jimmy Dean HOT sausage instead of mild bulk and crushed red pepper flakes and it came out wonderful. My favorite soup and my Sunday School Class favorite too.

Delicious! I made this recipe for an office "potluck".  I did make 2 minor changes.  I used kale instead of spinach and cooked the bacon, but did not include it in the soup.  I just used the drippings for cooking the onion and garlic.  I got so many compliments. Everyone who tried it, loved it.

This is a truly delicious soup just the way it is written!  I wanted to make it even more hearty and filling for a very cold November night here in Georgia (Polar Vortex)!!  I made the base recipe and then added carrots, orzo, and a can of creamed corn. I added a cup of skim milk and a cup of fat free half and half with a slurry of cornstarch to thicken into more of a chowder. Thanks for sharing your great recipe!

Easy recipe!!! I substituted kale for spinach and low fat milk for the heavy cream. I added mini shell pastas while boiling the potatoes. It's always a hit with my husband and kids so I keep it in rotation. :)

This recipe is spot on! Oh my, it was delicious. My husband can't stop raving about it. The only thing I did different was use two potatoes (they were huge!) instead of the 6 it calls for. I also used kale instead of spinach. So so yummy. Make this soup. You won't regret it!

I cooked the onions and garlic with the sausage and used real bacon bits, added the potatoes, cooked for 10 minutes and added kale to cook 10 minutes longer. Finished with the cream. Super delish!!!

This soup is a new favorite at my house! It's hearty and delish!  I used spicy turkey sausage, milk and cornstarch to make it healthier. Kale instead of spinach.  I added Bella mushrooms, julienne carrots for a little color, and cubed potatoes with the skins.

This was very good!  I changed it to drop the calories and make it healthier.  I used half and half and thickened it with a tiny bit of flour.  I also used turkey Italian sausage.

Very Simple, EXTREMELY tasty....... I tried Zuppa Toscana on a whim at Olive Garden many moons ago and fell in love with it. It's very flavorful and filling....be careful to drain the fat from the sausage or it will give the heavy cream a redish/pink tinge when done....." molto Bella"   


I did use KALE and I added it between the Cream and Sausage steps. Kale is not as tender as spinach so I cooked it longer about 5 minutes on medium heat.

This soup was just what I was hoping it would be. A good quality chicken broth (or homemade) is the key ingredient. I used mild Italian turkey sausage because it's leaner than pork and cooked it together with the onion, garlic, and red pepper flakes to bring out the flavors.  Substituted kale for spinach and half & half for cream.  If making this soup for the first time you may wish to reduce the red pepper flakes - you can always add more at the end if it's not spicy enough.  Next time I'll add some carrot strips at the end for a little color.

Fried mushrooms in bacon fat, added them to sausage off heat. Added fennel and Italian herbs to the recipe. Versatile and tasty!

I make this recipe often and tweak it each time.  I use Better Than Bouillon, half chicken and half beef. it is the BEST bouillon I have ever used. I will never use anything else again!I also omit the cream to save calories. Chicken sausage is great in this too. Sometimes I don't add potatoes either. But definitely use kale!

Great Recipe! I made this a little healthier by subbing the bacon and sausage with turkey bacon and turkey italian sausage. I also did half organic veggie broth and half organic chicken broth. For heavy cream I combined 1 cup of milk with 2 tablespoons of corn starch and 1 tablespoon of unbleached flour, Whip then all together vigorously then add to the soup and simmer and stir until thickened. Also used baby kale instead of spinach. Great flavor! My partner and I loved it.

Made it just as the directions said,  and the kids and I absolutely loved it! It is a little bit spicy if you have mild taste buds. We only added 1 tsp. Of the crushed red pepper and it still had quite a kick :)

Didn't have cans of chicken broth so I added 8 1/2 cups of water and used 4 chicken bouillion cubes. Also, I added A LOT more spinach. The red pepper flakes made it slightly spicy. Since everyone was feeling a bit under the weather, the kidlets weren't complaining. Really good and comforting.

I made a pork-free, gluten-free, reduced-dairy version of this and it turned out great! Substituting gluten-free chicken sausage (I used Al Fresco brand) and adding a little water with the red pepper worked well. In place of the heavy cream I mixed 1/2 cup of all-purpose gluten-free flour with 1/2 cup of 2% milk. I know this doesn't sound nearly as appetizing, but I can confidently say that it tasted just as good as Olive Garden's Zuppa!

Direct from the mouth of an Italian Mamma Mia, "this was very good!". I used sweet sausage because that's what I had on hand.  The sweet sausage turned out to be a nice contrast with the red pepper flakes. Definitely making this recipe again, thanks for posting it :-)

This is my all time favorite soup! It's so "homey" with the perfect amount of kick to it. I use stock instead of broth for a richer flavor, and add almost a teaspoon of crushed fennel seed. (I never have ground, so I just crush them in a zip-lock bag with my meat tenderizer.) Depending on what stock or broth you use you'll need to add a lot of salt. So good when you're hungover. lol

WOW!  Just like the soup at OG!  Paired with a salad and some garlic bread sticks and you've got a delicious and hearty meal.  I followed the recipe exactly, except my spinach ended up being too old to use, so I just left it out.  Still delish!

I sliced some potatoes thin, others thick. I started the bacon in the pot but finished it in the microwave. I wish I would have blotted the sausage as someone else suggested, just for color sake. I don't think it needed quite so much red pepper flakes and will cut it down to one teaspoon next time. I did add a bit of fennel seed. It is a hot July day ... And it was still appreciated!!

ok, I thought this soup was really good- my husband went back for more- we have never had the restaurant version - Olive Garden? but we really both liked it very well. I didn't have bacon so skipped that and used a bag of kale instead of spinach- cooked it into the soup for about 3 minutes before I added the heavy cream, stirred and then I served w/ crackers- I know it would have tasted better to me on a winter or fall night- unfortunately it was 87 today.....I will definitely make this again- when the weather is cooler:)

This has become one of my favorites. Not only is it absolutely delicious, but it's super simple to make and calls for inexpensive ingredients. My sister and I get together regularly to try new recipes and we're so disappointed when the dish doesn't look like it should ( or taste, for that matter :p) Needless to say, we're foodies so we needed to try to cut down on a bit of the decadence but still keep it flavorful. We used spicy Italian sausage instead of mild and omitted the chili flakes. We also decided to leave out the bacon, we used half and half instead of heavy cream and substituted kale for the spinach. Despite the changes, it was still rich and flavorful, definitely a keeper. Thanks soupersweets!!

This is really good. I use hot Italian sausage vice mild and omit the pepper flakes.  Still has a nice kick to it, but not crazy spicy. I also use kale instead of spinach. Wonderful for a chilly night.

Big hit with my family.  Like everyone here, I added my own tweaks.  I used new red potatoes because they are healthier and not quite as bad for carbs.  Turkey Italian sausage (I use Jenny O) takes a lot of fat out of this.  It was delicious and served with salad it made for a great dinner.

Full-bodied and delicious.  I cut down on the amount of crushed red pepper, just because I don't like hot spices overwhelming the delicate taste of the potatoes and cream.  Serve it with some fresh bread and a salad.  Winner!

I made this soup last night. My kids loved it. It is so delicious!  I had several servings and can't seem to get enough of it. I would definitely make this soup again.  Instead of spinach, I used kale.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This will do the trick...I used only half of the sausage and also kale instead of spinach.  As well, only about 1t of red pepper flakes...just my preference...This was a keeper.  I will definitely make this for company next time.

This soup is nothing short of AMAZING!!!!!! I've made this twice so far and the second time was for a group of about 20 to 25 people. Even the children were coming back for seconds and thirds!! EVERYONE raved about it! I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and rinsed the sausage in really hot water to keep it from being orange and to get rid of some of the grease. I also used kale (a lot of it) since that's what the famous restaurant uses and no one complained, not even my husband and kids who dislike kale. Other than that, I followed the recipe as written. I tripled the recipe to feed the group and everyone had plenty and we had some to take home!!! Thank you so much for sharing this reccipe :)

Love this soup!  I used lactose free whole milk in place of cream and added a touch of corn starch to thicken. The potatoes could do that on their own, but I like them to keep their shape, so I don't overlook.  I did add a touch of garlic salt at serving because I used mild sausage and no pepper flakes. (My family won't eat them.). The extra garlic gives it the needed flavor. This is a keeper!

WOW! This was amazing. I love soup and I figured with 5 stars it had to be great. I read reviews and made the following adjustments, it really was exceptional! Family and guests loved it!
Used low-sodium chicken broth (I can see it would have been way too salty if I hadn't)
Used hot sausage, left out the pepper flakes.
Used kale instead of spinach (added just about 10 minutes before serving).
Cooked 1/2 pound of bacon and reserved some for sprinkling on top in bowl.
Added some black pepper and thyme to taste.
Sliced 2 potatoes very thin, 4 thicker - making all pieces bit sized.
Served with shredded cheddar for top of bowl.

Delicious!  I made a few changes to make it "low fat".  Italian seasoned turkey, turkey bacon and fat free half-n-half.  I couldn't believe how good it tasted.  How sinful the regular version must taste.

Great recipe, although I did add some of my own tweaks. I used kale like others suggested, less chicken broth, and added some ingredients: fennel seed, balsamic and red wine vinegar (added a lot of needed zip), and pecorino romano. I also steamed the potatoes separately while cooking other ingredients to save time. Very good, I will make it again!

I made this exactly as the recipe called for and it was delicious. I might add more potatoes and maybe some carrots next time for volume. I think the potatoes I used were too small.

I always order the Zuppa Toscana at the popular Italian restaurant.  So, I was happy to find this recipe.  It tasted better than the restaurant version because I added my own personal touches.  Used kale instead of spinach, cooking for 5 min. after adding it...otherwise the kale would be too tough.  Added more red pepper flakes, simply because we like things spicy!  Didn't have heavy cream so I used 2% milk and added a few tablespoons of butter.  Because I only had turkey bacon on hand, and used it, the flavor was lacking.  Don't cringe, but to get the bacon flavor, I added a tablespoon of reserved, strained bacon grease I had in the refrigerator.  Like my mother and grandmother, I always save strained bacon grease for certain cooking strategies.  One last thing, I didn't have "sausage" but I had ground pork...to make up for the lack of spices normally found in sausage, I needed to add spices.  So a few shakes of garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, sweet basil, black pepper, and salt were added.  I probably could not duplicate the ingredients exactly if I tried, but it made a wonderful Zuppa!  I share these ideas to encourage others to make it their own.  A soup we truly enjoyed!

I was hoping this would be as good as it sounded and it was!  I left out the bacon since I didn't think it needed it.  Everything else I did just as the recipe stated.  Perfection.

We've just moved into a new house so I needed to double it so I wouldn't have to cook again for a few days.  I also hadn't gone to the store so I had to improvise:  1 lb hot Italian pork sausage and 1 lb sweet Italian chicken sausage - so no red pepper.  I did add a little fennel, crushed.  I also had no heavy cream so I used 2% milk and used baby kale.
I'm having some more now, 4 days later so I had to review.  It is wonderful! I honestly don't know how it could be any better.

The potato quantity is too much. I reduced it to half and the consistency was OK. It was very spicy. Next time I won't use the red pepper flakes.

Yep, that's Zuppa!!!!! A bowlful of deliciousness!!! I used hot Italian sausage, left out the hot pepper flakes, 3 big potatoes sliced in various thickness's, leftover bacon from breakfast, kale, and whole milk oh and no garlic (not a fan) everything else was the same. It turned out great, thick but still just enough broth. I would write more but I'm going back for seconds!!! Thank you Souporsweets!!! - nutcrackernut

I substituted chopped fresh kale for the spinach and added it with the potatoes. Put about 4 packed cups in but think I'll up it to 6 next time. Cut the potatoes 1/8" thick with my mandolin. Very good and the red pepper gave it a nice kick. Midwestern husband loved it- and he's not a fan of Italian sausage.

I also removed 2 quarts for freezing after adding the sausage but before the cream. Cream soups don't freeze well. So with the cup of cream mine was a little richer than the recipe called for. Awesome!

It's really hard to stop eating it!! Simple to make, doesn't cost much, but really good.

Great recipe. I followed it as given but used half and half instead of cream. Next time I will cut down on the red pepper flakes as it was a little too spicey for my taste.  Shari

This is one fantastic soup! I just had my second bowl. I wouldn't change a thing with regard to the ingredients used. However, the recipe was vague about the size of the potatoes, whether they should be peeled or not and how big of a bunch of spinach to use. I used about 5 ounces of spinach, and 9 smallish Idaho red potatoes. Next time, I'll peel the potatoes to avoid having strips of peel and will trim away all of the spinach stems. I'll be making this again soon.

All I can say is 'Yummo!'.  Wow, was this good!  Like some others I used Kale instead of spinach but only because I already had Kale on hand.  Also the sausage I used had cheese in it, that too was already on hand.  I'm a big baby when it comes to spicy (red pepper flakes) but I still added as directed.  I was still able to eat this happily but next time I will either omit or put a little less of the red pepper flakes.

It turned out great, and it was very easy to make.  I did it without bacon and used regular milk instead of cream which made it a lighter version.  Tastes just the one at Olive Garden.

THis soup is outstanding, hearty and oh so good on a cold winter night- a classic Italian peasant soup.  After reading a bunch of reviews, I adapted the recipe, many thanks for the tips!  I used mild Italian poultry sausage patties, instead of pork, and kale instead of spinach. I chunked my potatoes instead of slicing them.  I omitted the milk/heavy cream because I forgot(in the end its excellent without it)!  With the potatoes in the soup for thickener.  I served it with a side salad, and hearty 9 grain bread.  With this Polar Vortex swirling through upstate NY for the third time this winter, this soup is perfect to warm you up and fill your tummy with amazing comfort food!!  Thank you!

Good, not great.  I might use spicy sausage next time, but not sure there will be a "next time".

Loved it!  I used half and half with a T of cornstarch instead of heavy cream. I was going to use kale instead of the spinach, but the store was out, so I used the spinach and it was just as good. I also didn't have any bacon, but I used 3 T of bacon fat I had on hand to cook the onions and garlic in.  My husband used to work for the restaurant which makes the soup this recipe is based on and he loved eating it there.  He said this was just as good, if not better!  I will definitely make again!

I just finished making this soup and it is wonderful.  I replaced the spinach with fresh baby kale and it tasted just like I was at Olive Garden.  Did I mentioned to say that this is my favorite soup at the aforementioned restaurant.  This will go into my ***** five star favorite recipe section of my cook book.  Thanks for a great soup recipe.

I've been making my own "knock-off" recipe for awhile.  I only put in 1/2 tsp. of cayenne, and that gives it enough kick for us.  It depends upon the size of potatoes you use, but I use 3 medium russets, unpeeled.  I slice the slices in half.  Instead of the fresh spinach, I thaw a frozen box of chopped spinach, wring it dry, and add it at the end.  I know the restaurant chain uses kale, but our preference is the spinach.  Also, instead of 5 cans of chicken broth, I use two; one quart of water and 3 tsps. of granulated chicken base. Great recipe!

Awesome, easy and filling! Is on our regular winter menu. I cook the sausage and bacon separately and drain so that the soup has less grease and stays a creamy color.

Very flavorful soup.  Will not use the cream next time and save some calories and fat.  Hubby agrees.

This is a take on the Zuppa di Toscana at Olive Garden, which I love.
I use sweet turkey or pork Italian sausage which I take out of the casings...some use spicy...and kale or swiss chard...I like chard the best.

That's not spinach in the picture, it's kale. And kale is much better since it doesn't disintegrate. And if you don't want to use red pepper flakes, use spicy Italian sausage. Whoever wrote this recipe is making things difficult.

Yep, I've tried this soup....it's a close replica of the Zuppa Toscana soup that is served at Olive Garden.  I have also made it with kale instead of spinach...kale being how the restaurant makes it

This soup is absolutely wonderful. I did use low sodium chicken broth and took the suggestions of others and used kale instead of spinach. However, next time I make it, I'll be leaving the kale out. It's pretty but I don't think it enhances the flavor of the soup. My husband loved it...and he isn't big on Italian sausage. Definitely a keeper.

I make this recipe every year for Christmas eve when we have a house full of people and they all love it. My picky lil eater requests it all the time! I simplify the recipe a bit. I buy real bacon bits to save time, also have been using a soup mix instead of broth, I use a TON of fresh minced garlic about 10 minutes before its ready. And I also use a lot of Kale, instead of spinach. I am told its better then Olive Gardens!

Wonderful soup.  I doubled the recipe for our larger crowd and used half turkey Italian sausage and half normal sweet Italian sausage.  I rinsed the sausage per the recommendations and sliced the potatoes in two thicknesses.  I also used kale (my first time), which was SO much better than globs of wilted spinach.

My 11 year old just loaded allrecipes app on the ipad in the kitchen and he made this soup.  We used what I had on hand: chicken sausage, vegetable and chicken broth, just a few red pepper flakes, and no-fat half and half.  It is excellent and we can hardly wait to have it for dinner with fruit and corn bread.  Yummy cooking lesson for another snowy no-school day!

Absolutely delicious!  While I've never tried Olive Garden's Zuppa Toscana, this recipe spoke to me, and I had everything on hand.  It smelled so good while cooking.  My picky 12-year-old daughter LOVED it!  She cleaned her bowl (and even ate the kale).  I used kale in place of the spinach as a recommendation from other reviewers.  I didn't have any cream on hand, so I used a cup of milk and three TBSP. of cornstarch (a recommendation from another reviewer).  Make sure you dissolve the cornstarch in water before adding it to the soup.  I also used golden potatoes, and instead of adding red pepper flakes, I added cayenne pepper. This is a definite keeper.

This is soooo good!  Made it with turkey sausage to lower the calories (New Year's resolution to eat healthier) and was still amazing.  Wanted to go for seconds & thirds, but stuck to my one little bowl.  Served it with organic whole wheat bread, yummm.  With recipes like this, I may keep my resolution ;)  Try it, I'm sure you'll make it over and over again as I will!

Delicious! I made last winter and I forgot what a great soup it is, especially for cold weather. Hubby always goes for seconds but it is a very filling, comfort food kind of soup.

I didnt use bacon.  I added fresh ground peppercorns powdered parmesan and salt to taste.  I think the fresh ground peppercorns makes this recipe.

Super good. Made just as called for in recipe...no changes. Nice amount of spice, and we like spice. Could have been even a little spicier and it would have been fine. Was super good with bread. Will definitely make again.

I have tried the soup and its a good recipe, I do mine a little different and have good reviews when I serve it, small children can enjoy it also as I don't use red pepper flakes.Instead of ground sausage I use Johnsonville mild Italian sausage links, Olive Garden uses this also, for the two of us I use three links. With a point of a sharp knife I poke about three holes in each link. Put them in a Dutch Oven with about an inch of water. Bring to a boil and reduce heat. Cover and let simmer until water is gone and sausages are done. Remove. Let cool and slice on the diagonal about 1/4 to 1/2 inch wide.Cook bacon, onion and garlic in same pan with a little oil until crispy and remove and drain on paper towel. Peel and cut potatoes, I use about 2 large for the two of us, into quarters. Bring water and potatoes to a boil, cook until done and add prior ingredients. Add broth or water with bouillion and cook until hot. Add 3 to 4 Cups Kale and cream. Simmer about 4 minutes and serve with croutons on top. 
Sausages may be cooked in the oven on a cookie sheet at 300 degrees until done, drain, cool and slice.

Best soup ever.  I made this soup for the 1st time ever and my wife and family couldn't stop eating it. This soup does something to your soul. I added more bacon, little extra minced garlic.  My daughter stomach was growling as I began to cook it. Plus I used kale which has more better nutrients than spinach. I love it

Very good recipe. Made some minor changes: No Bacon, did not drain sausage (Bob Evan's Italian sausage), Kale instead of Spinach, Corn Starch and Milk mixture (about 3 Tbsp corn starch, 1 cup milk) instead of heavy cream. For the broth, I used 9 cups water + 9 Tones Chicken Bouillon cubes. Also, for the potatoes, I used Russet.

A well deserved 5 stars! My husband immediately saved the recipe to the kitchen desktop right after his first bite :-) We have some fond memories of the Olive Garden zuppa toscana, so with the addition of fennel seed this recipe was perfect! Thanks souporsweets!

One of our favorite sloppy Pacific Northwest weather meals! We've changed it up a couple of times and added sliced sausage to the recipe which is yummy too! We also replace the spinach with Kale sometimes. Serve this with some toasted Asiago bread! Amazing.

I use Johnsonville hot sausages purchased at the store. I just take them out of the casings and brown up the meat. I like to leave it in, the spices work nicely with the soup as we like a tad bit of kick in ours.  Very true tribute, we make multiple pots at once and freeze it - no need to go to Olive Garden for soup and salad!  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is worth it. It's very filling and great taste! Even after freezing. Of course I tweaked it...I use 32 ozs of chicken broth and two cups of water. Be careful of your potatoes. Someone said they used 2 large potatoes cut in cubes then one large potatoe cut into larger cubes. Worked very well! I will also season my italian more when cooking. Good Luck with this one!

This was good, but not the best ever, so I withheld a star.  I think I added too much broth for I didn't read that it called for the smaller cans of broth and not the 15 ounce ones.  I think cannellini beans would have tasted good in it.  I didn't bother with all the separate sautéing steps, rather I just sautéed the sausage for about 5 minutes, then added the onions for 5 minutes, and lastly the bacon, before dumping it all the rest of the ingredients on top.  This worked well for ease and for flavor; the only thing that didn't go so well is that the bacon didn't get crisp this way.  I also didn't totally boil it as the recipe states.  Instead I simmered on low with the lid on.

Made this tonight. Turned out very good. Used hot Italian sausage, 4 potatoes, 1 tsp red pepper, lots of fresh kale, 3/4 diced onion, no bacon, 1 can broth, 4 cups water, which made it less salty and light cream. Liked better without cream, may leave out next time.

Wow!  Even better the second day!!  I followed the recipe fairly closely, though left out the crushed red pepper flakes as my family doesn't do spicy.  I upped the garlic to 4 cloves.  I used a whole 32 oz. box of chicken broth and then realized I had an open one in the fridge (not sure how much was in there - maybe a cup?) so I threw that in as well.  I used 3 very large russet potatoes, sliced - and left the skins on as I'd read in another site's recipe.  Not sure if I'll do that again, but it did add some flavor and texture.  Again, following other recipes, I substituted kale for the spinach, and loved it - it doesn't mush down completely like spinach would - and I think it's the first time 2 of my family members have ever eaten kale voluntarily!  I did use the heavy cream, but wonder if some of the other substitutions to cut down on fat would work well - may try next time.  This soup was amazing!  I had some for breakfast this morning..... why wait?!?  UPDATE: 10/11/14 - made tonight with half beef broth/half chicken broth - just because I had both to use up.  Every bit as good!

This was very good but next time I'll tweek it a little. I don't like a lot of broth, so I'll use only 3 cans next time instead of 5. I'll also leave out the bacon because I saw no need for it. I tried Low-sodium broth because of a few reviews, but next time I'll use regular...for more flavor. I couldn't find the spicy ground Italian sausage like one reviewer suggested, but next time I'll look harder because the red pepper flakes didn't make it spicy at all. I used milk instead of heavy cream & of course kale instead of spinach like EVERYONE recommended & I thoroughly enjoyed it. Next time I'll double all the ingredients because this was gone the same night...Lol.

The right sausage is the key to this recipe as well as the kale.  I like a spicy, hot sausage.  The kale is tough though.  I have yet to find a tasty kale for this soup.  We usually have two or three choices of kale at our local store but none have given this soup the right boost.  I do love this soup!

Love this recipe!  Zuppa Toscana at the famous Italian restaurant is one of my favorite items on their menu.  Made this recipe just as written.  Compared it to other 'zuppa toscana' recipes on AllRecipes.com I have made, and this one is the best.  It is delicious, filling, warming and...wait for it...only 170 calories per bowl!

This recipe is awesome and similar to the original. To make it more like the original, I used kale instead of spinach and added a couple extra strips of bacon. Superb!

Awesome recipe as is. You can do so much with it to make it to your liking.  My only suggestion is using kale instead of spinach.  This then tastes like the OG soup!  Yea!  Thanks for sharing!

I have made this recipe for a long long time. I usually go to another web site to find the recipe. I just recently found it here. Its a dead ringer to the Olive Garden that serves it. 

In fact, my wife says its even better. I dont use a dutch oven. I just use a very large pan. I dont use cans of broth. I use Chicken Bullion cubes.

I dont use either spinach or kale. But kale does add a bit of color, which is nice. I use the food processor to cut up my onions for me. Just be careful not to leave them in too long or you will wind up with onion soup. I use lots of potatoes. But use however many you like. 

Depends if you like your soup more patotoeeee. I also put my bacon in a food processor to make it bacon bitee.

YUMMMMM! This soup is so delicious I never have any leftovers, even though there are only two of us in the household. Although we loved the soup, my husband complained it was too "runny". To make a thicker cream soup I made a roux (1/4c butter to 1/4 flour over medium heat and cook until peanut butter-colored) and I wisked that in right after the potatos finished cooking, before adding in the cream. I also use frozen spinach (I usually always have it on hand in my home) and I just add it in frozen. It thaws out so quickly...no need to waste time pre-cooking. This is a family favorite...thanks so much for sharing!!

New favorite! I just switched the spinach for kale.  I also left out the bacon.  Tastes just like the restaurant recipe....better, even!  Bake up some breadsticks and it's the perfect comfort food!

I love this soup!!! I tweaked it just a little bit. I don't use the bacon and only use about 1/3 of the sausage since I'm not a big meat person. I also substitute kale for spinach and use a lot more red pepper flakes since I like spicy foods.

Made this last night and it was delicious. Used kale and honey garlic sausage (weird I know, but it was all I had on hand) added basil, sage, parsley and a bay leaf.
I'm excited to eat it for lunch today!!

Great soup, great taste.  Used spinach.. less potatoes.  Also added white beans to replace some of the potato.  Excellent soup, freezes well.

The person using Campbell's chicken broth.. that's where the salt is.  Try College Inn or one of the better brands that has more chicken flavor and less salty flavor.

Very good and simple. I used red potatoes because that is what I had. I also used swiss chard in place of spinach or kale because that it what I had and it turned out great.

This recipe was just like the one I eat at Olive Garden. But instead of adding spinach, I added Kale. It was very delish. And to keep the soup from turning orangish, I drained the sausage on paper towels before putting it back in with the soup. And I used fresh Italian sausage from the meat department, not the kind that comes in the roll. Thanks for the recipe! It's a keeper!

I cut out the bacon, mainly because it was expensive and still this soup is super tasty. I used hot italian sausage instead and it was fantastic. Spinach was also still tasty.

This is a terrific recipe, I too use kale instead of spinach. Usually this soup gets eaten and there are no left overs, but do you think this would freeze well?

I love soup, so this looked good and had so many great reviews, I figured "what could go wrong?"  I made it as written, with the exception of using kale instead of spinach (wish now that I had just used the spinach, because the texture of the kale ruins it for me),and a tad less red pepper flakes.  I just found it to lack flavor. Probably won't make again, but I'm hoping I'll like it better after it has a day to meld.

This soup is ALWAYS a huge hit in our house. It is very tasty and just hits the spot when it's cold or rainy out. I add kale instead of spinach, a leek, some crushed fennel seeds (if sausage needs some umph) and a dollop or two of mashed potatoes/swede to thicken up the consistency.

This is the best version of this recipe that I have tried. I put about 3/4 tsp of ground red pepper and used kale.  I think the original version uses kale and the texture is wonderful in this soup!  \We always used spicy sausage without red pepper flakes and it was always too hot but this recipe with the mild sausage and adding red pepper as you like is so much better! Definitely a recipe that we will make often!

I loved this recipe!! Made a few adjustments from the reviews: cut up 4 large russet potatoes thinly sliced, added about 7 cups of chicken broth, didn't add hot pepper flakes, and used kale instead of spinach. 
I'm lactose intolerant so I didn't add cream/milk at all, but it was fabulous regardless!! Will be making this again in the future

This recipe is absolutely amazing.  I heated some up for lunch today at work and got compliments on the delicious smell.  This will definitely be a staple in my recipe box, it is so good.  The softness of the potatoes mixed with the saltiness of the bacon and sausage is so satisfying.  The broth is really savory and the soup eats like a meal.  I made two changes.  I included fennel seed, which MAKES the flavor of this soup.  I can't imagine it without fennel.  Also, I substituted kale for spinach.  The kale softens in the soup but does not become mushy.  I added the kale at the same time that I added the potatoes.  I used pre-cooked, pre-crumbled pork sausage which was a big time saver. I didn't add red pepper flakes, and I didn't miss them.  This is a perfect recipe!

Very good--Kale for spinach, and whole milk with cornstarch for cream.  We reduced the amount of sausage, too, and cut the potatoes thin.  Enjoy!

Great flavor but too hot!  Needed about 1/2 the red pepper flakes.  We will be making this again, but with less spice!

Outstanding! The flavor is spot on! I cut it to four potatoes and later added another can of chicken broth when I realized it was still heartier than I wanted. I was worried about it being salty, so three of the cans were Ca and the other three were Sw. I used about half of a small bag of real bacon bits. We primarily eat turkey bacon, but I always keep a bag of those on hand to cook with. Also, it's fine to use frozen spinach.

This is amazing. The few changes I made were turkey sausage, 1 bag of reames frozen noodles instead of potatoes, half & half instead of heavy cream, and added 2 cups of sliced baby carrots. Husband was hesitant to try it but when he did he liked it.

Great flavor.  I made half the amount.  I used ground pork instead of sausage so we used a bit of pepper and spice to give it the flavor needed.  My husband though it was fairly plain until I added the cream, which improved the soup.  Everyone liked it, eating it with no complaints :) My son requested that I make it again.  As suggested by others, I used more potatoes and left them in big chunks.  Potatoes cooked in about 15 minutes.  I reduced the pepper flakes to a small pinch, figuring the spiciness can be adjusted individually. We ate this with butter crackers.

Excellent recipe! Made a few changes, didn't use bacon, used kale instead of spinach and added a few of my favorite seasonings. My mother said it was better than that famous chain restaurant. Will make it again.

Delicious flavor! I gave it five stars, but I had to substitute the sausage with chorizo because all the italian sausage had been sold at my local store.  One change I made was to leave out the bacon, because I wasn't sure I wanted so much oil or salt in the soup.  Also, instead of adding the pepper flakes to the meat, I let them stew in the chicken broth.  Therefore, I cannot truly rate this recipe, but I still think it would have been amazing had I followed it down to a tee.

DH and I loved this, although my 4 yo wasn't much of a fan.  I didn't have any bacon so I omitted it and only had half and half so I added a little cornstarch to thicken it a bit.  I also used a 10oz pkg of frozen spinach.  It turned out great!

My husband had Zuppa at a restaurant and loved it, so I decided to make it for him at home. He says mine is better! (thanks) I've made it lots of times. There are nine of us at our house and we have visitors often, everyone loves it! I always make a double batch and then double the garlic and bacon again. I add 1 tsp. black pepper and skip the red pepper because of the kids. I also use one container of Philadelphia Italian herb cooking creme in place of half of the cream. This is a fantastic recipe!

This was so simple and yet so delicious!!  I used a sausage from Costco with cheese in it, broccoli and red bell pepper.  Also, added cayenne pepper and ground white pepper.  I am very impressed and will definitely make it again.

This is one of my all time favorites!  Like some other reviewers I substituted kale for the spinach.  I also don't think it needs a whole cup of cream (I used about 1/3 cup) and also don't think it needs the bacon.  On the plus side that cuts down quite a bit of the fat.  For the potatoes I like a waxy potato like yukon gold.

Well, I liked this but my family did not.  They just didn't care for the sausage much.  I cut the recipe in half since one of the reviews said it made a bunch, and was glad I did since I'm the only one who is going to be eating it, apparently.  I made with the spinach and added the fennel seed as suggested. Tasty, but probably won't be making again since my family can't appreciate a soup that doesn't come out of a can:(

I had some leftover Kale from making Kale Chips last night and wanted to find a recipe to us up the remaining.  This was very good.  I made a few changes.  I did not use bacon, and to me I really did not miss it.  I also added slices of smoked sausage which added a nice flavor in addition to the sausage.  Instead of cream I used fat free half and half.  This was a very flavorful soup and I added a hefty dose of Parmesan Cheese just before serving.  Yummy.

Not that another review is needed, but since I've never had the restaurant soup, this was pretty good! We had it two nights ago and just finished leftovers for dinner this evening. I used Johnsonville's 1/2 pork and chicken sausage to save a few calories and omitted the red pepper flakes to make it kid-friendly (DH sprinkled some into his bowl). I formed the sausage into dime-sized balls and browned them along with the chopped onion. I used spinach simply because I didn't have kale on hand, and tossed in some sundried tomatoes I wanted to use up. I subbed half and half for the heavy cream, but would prefer it next time with the heavy cream. I am a garlic fiend and tossed a few cloves I roasted earlier in the evening.  Also added a sprinkling of black pepper as it simmered.  Topped our bowls with parmesan and ate with side of garlic bread. Definitely a repeat for us!

Amazingly simple yet oh-so-good. I tweaked the recipe also. I used only 4 potatoes and 4 cans of low-sodium chicken broth. Substituted kale for spinach. Yummy! Will definitely make this again (and again and again).

Hands down, the yummiest on point recipe I have ever made! Very impressed! I was curious why the recipe didn't say to add "S&P" or "adjust seasonings to taste" like most recipes do, and the reason being, it's perfect just the way it is.  AMAZING! My Italian Hubby was impressed :) Next time, will try using Pancetta instead of bacon!

Loved this soup!  Just the right amount of spice and not too heavy.  I agree with previous reviewers, the bacon is not necessary. Kale is the way to go.  I didn't have any fennel seed, but I think that would be a great addition.

I just made this for New Years Eve last week.  My boyfriend loved it.  I froze the remainder of the soup and had enough for two more meals. =)  Delicious!

Have made this soup many times and it's our family favorite! I always use kale and low sodium chicken broth. It's a flexible soup ~ if I feel like extra bacon I add it. Also very good with sweet Italian sausage. The flavor changes with your ingredients, so add what you like. Try it!!

I don't eat pork, so I was never able to eat this soup in the restaurant. I mad it with spicy turkey shady brook farms sausage. Trader Joe's Turkey bacon and Kale. To avoid too much salt. I started with 32 oz of broth. Then balanced the taste added 2oz of water and 2 oz of broth at a time. I also doubled the garlic.

Love love love this recipe!!!! I made a couple minor tweaks such as using certain brands sausage (Fareway stores own mix) & bacon (Oscar Meyer) to get the flavors I like best. From there I just throw it together without really measuring (as I do all my cooking). I use more broth too as I like more liquid though.

This is the best soup I've ever made!  I have a hard time finding good soup recipes.  I left out the red pepper though because my 4 year old doesn't like anything spicey.  She even ate this soup and loved it!  I put 6 strips of bacon instead of 4.  The more the better.  I put about 3 tablespoons of garlic instead of 1 and it was perfect!  I used the chicken boullion cubes instead because i was out of the canned broth.  It still turned out amazing! I used 3 potatoes instead of the 6 because my husband doesn't really like them that much.  I thought 3 was plenty. I used milk instead of heavy cream and used cornstartch to thicken, thanks to another reviewer.  I used a half a small box of frozen spinach.  Perfect soup!

This recipe is perfect the way it is.  I've also tried the Kale in place of spinach as others have recommended.  Good both ways, but more like the restaurant's with the Kale.  Definitely a must try!

I loved this recipe! While I tweaked it to my family's taste, it is fantastic without alteration. In order to make the broth thicker and creamier, I used 4 potatoes and 2 cups of potato flakes. Since it was thicker and creamier, I cut down the cream to 3/4 of a cup. We also like some heat so I used hot sausage links sliced thinly. I did not have fresh spinach available, so I used a 1/2 package of frozen chopped spinach.

What can I say that hasn't been said? 

1. We used Kielbasa instead of italian sausage. 
2. We omitted the red pepper flakes.

It was still stinking fabulous. One of the best things I've eaten in ages.

EXCELLENT! LOVED IT! I did tweek the recipe just a little. This was my first time making and trying this soup. I only used 2 large potatoes and not the 6 this recipe calls for. I also used Kale instead of spinach which I HIGHLY recommend doing. The next time I make this I will add more potatoes and more kale. Can wait to make this again!

I made this soup dairy-free by using a plain soy creamer to replace the milk.  It's amazing and my husband (who can have milk), raved about it.  Changes:  I added zucchini and some extra garlic...it's amazing!

We had an Italian dinner pot luck so I chose this dish. It was sooooo good!!!! It's a little spicy so I wouldn't recommend it for small children. It was a hit at the party so I give it five stars. People were going back for seconds and thirds!!

I have made hundreds of recipes on this site and have NEVER reviewed one, but this had to be my exception. I followed the recipe to a T, except like others I used kale in place of spinach and it was truly AMAZING!!!!  My entire family, kids included LOVED this!  It tastes exactly like the recipe I order at Olive Garden!!!  Thank you so much for sharing, it will be a part of my family's recipe box for years to come!

Wow, I've never had the restaurant's version but this was bomb diggity!  So comforting and delicious and full of flavor!  It was boyfriend approved as well...great for a chilly day or evening.  I used spicy Italian sausage - I always do for any recipe asking for Italian sausage.  Try Trader Joe's...it's my favorite.  And I used kale instead of spinach.  Wow, what a great way to showcase kale!  For potatoes, I used German Butterball potatoes from my CSA box.  Slam dunk!  Definitely a keeper :)

This turned out really well.  I even made it in a crockpot.  I browned the sausages in an oven first, but then everything went into the crockpot till just before serving.  At that point I added kale for the spinach and half & half for the heavy cream.  I even cheated a bit and wanted the consistancy to be slightly thicker... so I added a bit of instant mash potatoes to thicken the soup just a tad.

I made this last week and everyone loved it! I'm making it again for dinner tonight! I did change it up a bit though. I omitted the bacon and used kale instead of the spinach. This tastes just like Olive Garden's Zuppa! Thank you so much for this recipe!! :)

Used kale instead of spinach and turkey italian sausage - great reviews from the family!  Even the kids ate it up!  I also did not keep taking the bacon and sausage out, but kept adding everything into the pot.

LOVE this soup! I followed the recipe exactly except I used kale in place of the spinach. Everyone in my family loved it. Only my seven year old thought it was a little spicy but she still ate it. I will definitely be making this soup often!

I have been making this for years and it is our family's favorite soup.  I do not add quite so many potatoes.  We always use Kale, interesting that the picture used with this recipe appears to be Kale and not spinach.  We also use mild or medium italian sausage and omit the red pepper flakes.  We are also garlic lovers and add 2 cloves of minced garlic + salt and fresh ground pepper.  yummy

We have had this soup in many forms. We have used breakfast sausage in a pinch, with or without bacon, kale in place of spinach (the kale holds up better), added pasta in addition to or instead of the potatoes. We actually prefer it without the heavy cream. Thanks for the delicious recipe! :o)

Very good! I take short cuts, so I used hot Italian sausage,julienned Kale (that I cooked with the potatoes-as Kale tends to be chewy), and some of the already cooked bacon you can find in stores - chopped fine.

So delicious! This last time I did a few things differently: I used hot sausage and only a little over half of the red pepper flakes, and it was delicious! I knew that we would have lots leftover, so I tried leaving the kale out so that it would reheat better. I also completely forgot the bacon last time as well, but it was still fantastic!

My girlfriends & I love this soup when we go out to lunch,have been searching for a recipe for it for awhile. I made this for the first time & it turned out beyond delicious. I doubled the recipe & used chicken stock in place of broth & used Kale in place of the spinach. Also I didn't add the Kale until I served the soup placed a small amount of Kale in bottom of each bowl then added soup over it. This will be made a lot for lunches with the girls & on cold winter nights for my family

Good soup - I added a ton of red pepper flakes but it wasn't spicy at all. Couldn't find hot sausage so will have to do it next time. Broth was extremely thin - used half and half instead of cream so should let it simmer down a little. Used kale and no bacon.

This was DELICIOUS!! Perfect soup for fall or a cold night.  I used Jimmy Dean HOT sausage and omitted the red pepper, it was perfectly seasoned without the addition of salt and pepper.  I cut up the leaves of the spinach and added just before serving... excellent.

This recipe was easy to follow. It was absolutely delicious!!! The whole family loved it. I didn't add as much crushed red pepper as the recipe called for i used about half. I served it with garden salad and garlic bread. Fantastic recipe.

Great recipe!  As other reviewers suggested, I switched kale for the spinach and absolutely loved it.  The kale really keeps its texture.  No need for the bacon.

This was wonderful! My family couldn't get enough! I don't usually review things - but this was just incredible and too easy!  I didn't really change anything - except I just threw my garlic and onion in with the sausage and cooked the bacon separately at the same time to save a little bit of time!  I also used bouillon cubes because I have 5 kids and had to triple the recipe and it was cheaper for me!  Amazing!  Thank you!

Amazingly this was way better than I expected.  It was definitely a soup I will make again.   Because of two little girls in my family I omitted the red pepper and it was still good.    It also was quick to prepare. I had it ready to eat in 45 min!

This recipe was AMAZING! I forgot to use bacon, but it was still delishous, I also used more cream then called for 1 cup I used 2 cups instead instead. Just because I wanted a bit more liquid and a more creamy taste. As the other reviews stated Kale is the better choice it stays crisp. My family raved about it and my dad said it was better then the soup at that popular restaurant. My sister wants the recipe to make for her friends. This is a very easy recipe, oh and on a side note I don't have a dutch oven I just used a regular big pot and I cooked the the other ingrediants in a pan. Still came out Amazing :) Try it!

This is the best soup ever! My husband uses this recipe, the only thing he does different is add more bacon and he uses kale in place of spinach (personal preference). This is a wonderful hearty, warm your bones, kinda soup. Thank you so much for sharing it "souporsweets"!!!

It was very savory, delicious and easy to make. However I feel like it needed more seasoning therefore I added a couple pinches of sweet paprika, cayenne pepper, ground pepper and some fresh lime juice. In the future I will add a little less cream or substitute with half and half instead to make it healthier.

Perfection. Only change I made was adding some chicken in that I needed to use up and using 2% milk instead of heavy cream. Wonderful flavor and absolutely will make again and again!

This is one of the best soups I ever tasted or made. I changed nothing because nothing in this recipe needs to be changed. My family was crazy about it. I will make this recipe when I get hungry again for soup.    If I could give 10+ stars that is how I would rate this recipe. Its excellent!!!!!

Have made this one a ton.  There isn't much that I change to this recipe.  I do like to use red potatoes and hot sausage.  This is a keeper.  Those that I have served it to agree it is like the restaurant version...one person actually said it is better than the restaurant!

Have made this a number of times and it is amazing.  Sometimes instead of cream I just add some milk mixed with cornstarch for a healthier version.  Have added tomatoes and definitely vote on collards vs spinach!

Best soup in the world! Used hot italian sausage in stead of mild, extra crushed red peppers, and kale instead of spinach. Turned out better than Olive Gardens!

My new favorite! This recipe is exactly like the popular chain restaurant! I did however make some changes. I used kale instead of spinach, omitted the bacon, and used fat free cream! Turned out fabulous!

WOW, this is delicious.  The reipe makes enough for a crowd too.  We really loved this flavorful soup.  I never had this at Olive Garden, so I was happy to try it out here.  I used less crushed red pepper flakes because I was afraid it would be too hot for us, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  This would be excellent with hot sausage instead and kale just for a change.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe it SO yummy! I served it to 4 different families and everyone loved it. The only exchange I made was using Kale instead of Spinach. I like the texture and flavor of the Kale better.

This is my family's favorite soup!  Even my 4 yo niece loves it.  I always use 2-3 cups of torn kale instead of spinach and everyone fights over the kale. Also, do NOT peel the potatoes. This is a great, hearty soup that we eat year-round.

OH MY Goodness! This is the best soup. Ever. YUM! I used turkey bacon which is really yum, and I used more that four slices, and it gives it a slight smokey flavor. I used Kale instead of spinach..and that was wonderful. This soup is just oh so good. I wish I could rate it more stars....

Wow this was such an awesome recipe.  I adore this soup in the well-known restaurant, but this homemade version is even better, in my opinion.  Only thing I changed was to use kale instead of spinach.  It has a nice heat to it--but not overpowering (to me at least) and it came out rich, flavorful, and delicious.  I ate two bowls, but should have stopped at one because it's such a filling soup that I felt stuffed later.  Can't wait to have more of it tonight!

I thought this was great, but a little too spicy for our tastes. I used kale instead of spinach. Will be making this again, but decreasing the red pepper just a bit. Thanks!

Very good. I did do a lower fat version, used turkey sausage and turkey bacon. If you go this route, I would suggest using a little EVOO when adding the onion since you aren't going to get the fat drippings like you do when using pork bacon. Used low sodium chx broth and added salt to taste at the end. used kale, also added kale and sausage when adding the low fat milk. tasted great.

This was pretty good and even better on day 2. The Italian Sausage Soup on this site is much easier and is more delicious, though. I made it as written except I only added 3 large potatoes. More would have been too many. I had to add quite a bit of salt at the end to keep the broth from being too bland. I also used half and half instead of heavy cream.

This is my family's new FAVORITE soup.  I have made this many times over the last few months. I almost always tweak recipes,but this one is perfect for me as is. I will try using Kale eventually, but I almost always have spinach around so that's what I use.  I don't add the bacon in the pot, but crumble it into the bowls when I serve...that way, there is a nice crunch to the soup. Update: tried it w/ Kale and it is very good.  I had extra, so I made Kale Chips as a snack while the soup simmered!  :)

I love this recipe.  I use kale for the spinach and since I like it spicy, I use a hot sausage.  This is one of my family's favorite soup recipes!

WOW!!  A keeper for sure!  I used one hot and one mild sausage, ran hot water over meat while draining grease.  Used fat free 1/2 & 1/2 all to make it a little less fatty.  It was remarkable!

So impressed!!  I used the kale instead of spinach, diced the potatoes in @ 1/2 inch cubes, forgot and used Jimmy Dean pork sausage instead of italian (just added some italian spices).  First time ever using kale...it was perfect in this, as the spinach would have been a bit slimy after it cooked, but the kale was great.  This soup is wonderful to make the day before a dinner party...maybe even better the second day as there was no change in consistancy after heating again.  Small kids might think it a bit spicy...but we think it is superb!!

This is my favorite soup!  I have referred this to many people and everyone loves it.  I do use spinach instead.  I use low sodium chicken broth and to the viewer that didn't like because it was too salty.  It could have been the sausage she used and chicken bouillon if used is extremely high in sodium.  Makes a huge difference!  I use Trader Joes low sodium Chicken Broth in the box.  Scimecas italian sausage too, which is delicious! Sometimes I add a little more potatoes and broth, but that's just a preference I choose sometimes, don't have to.  LOVE IT!

Just like the famous restaurant!  I wanted to use kale, but could only find collard greens, and they were fine, but I do agree a heartier green is best.  I am so happy to hear it freezes well, because I love the ease of left-overs.

I thought this tasted very much like the restaurant version.  I only used 4 potatoes and it was more than enough.  Next time I will omit the red pepper flakes  as the italian sausage is spicy enough.  Beware - this makes quite a bit so you will want to have plenty of people eating with you.

I am so excited to find this recipe because my husband and I recently moved to Hawaii and there are no Olive Garden restaurants here! We have been missing and craving the Zuppa Toscana soup and I'm so happy that I can now make it right here in my own kitchen. This recipe is so delicious and really very simple to make. I ended up using only three potatoes but they were very large, and instead of spinach I used kale to make it more like the restaurant. This soup is superb and I can't wait to make it again!

not as perfect as OG's but it was still delicious.  i didn't have enough chicken broth so i just added a few cans of water.  i also substituted half&half for the heavy cream.  a dash or two of garlic salt to each individual bowl made it just right.  next time i'll make sure to not drain the sauteed Italian sausage of the oil so that it will have just a tid bit more flavor.

My 12 year old can't get enough of this soup.  I make it often and use kale when I can find it, spinich works, but can be on the limp side.  We make it extra spicy by using hot sausae and extra pepper flakes.

This soup was delicious!  It tastes just like the one at the Italian restaurant chain.  I omitted the bacon.  Next time I'll use kale. Spinach is too soft and has a slimey texture. Do not slice the potatoes too thin or else they will fall apart during cooking.

This was a HUGE hit.  USE KALE.  Omit the bacon.  It doesn't seem necessary with the pork sausage.  Add fennel seed to cooking pork.  I smashed some of the cooked potato and used a rue to thicken the soup slightly.

This is amazing soup.  I used kale instead of spinach, as kale is what the restaurant uses.  I also used fat free half and half instead of heavy cream and I'm not missing the fat at all.  Wonderful dish.

Very delicious, although the cream brought it way over the top in richness. I think 2% milk would be better to use.

Absolutely delicious!! Pretty quick preparation.   Changes to make it healthier: I used chicken italian sausage (which was so hot I definitely did NOT use pepper flakes), light cream, and turkey bacon.  I also followed other rater's advice and added fennel, only used 4 potatoes and substituted kale for spinach.  I will definitely make again and absolutely LOVE it. Rave reviews!

I followed this recipe and a recipe from another site.  The ingredients were pretty much the same, but the cooking methods were slightly different.  This was very good.  The one thing I would have like to have seen is a slightly thicker soup base.

This is awesome~!  I omitted the cream as a previous poster mentioned and used 2% milk with 3 tbs of cornstarch.  This is a keeper!  THNX!  I also used frozen spinach!  it's what I had on hand and didn't want to go to the store in the pouring rain.

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, except of using a Dutch oven (which I don't own) I used a bog pot on the stove. I cooked the meat on med-high for 10 minutes, and the bacon for 6. Yum

I followed this recipe to the T and it was absolutely delicious! I think it makes more than 6 servings though; my fiance and I each had three bowls and we still have leftovers. That is fine by us though I think we might fight over the leftovers. Thanks for the new favorite soup!

This soup is definitely irresistable. I tried it for the first time a couple of years ago at Olive Garden and was hooked. I prefer to use spicy Italian sausage, a lot of kale, and alot of chili flakes. This recipe also doesn't specify but I love to keep the skin on the potato because it holds the potato slices better. I also use a water and chicken bouillon mix if I don't have chicken broth available. Haven't tried it with spinach but I'm sure it's also good, just not amazing like kale is.

My whole family loves this soup.  I actually think it's better than the restaurant version!  Like other reviewers, I use kale because I like the texture, and I also use spicy turkey sausage.  It's a regular on our winter dinner table.

Almost like a copy kat recipe I got off the internet but it uses 10 cups water and about 3-5 tsp. of boullion.  Just as another reviewer wrote, I add kale and no bacon.  I found the heavy cream to be to much and I use some milk and blend some of the potatos with a hand wand blender. Creamy without the fat.  Hot chicken sausage from Trader Joes and fennel for sure. Have used other sausage too.  Always great.

Simply delicious!!!!  Would give 10 stars if possible. I used Kale instead of spinach.  Added more potatoes.  Added more Kale.  Thank you for sharing a great recipe.  Will be making this again, and again.  I baked the sausage in oven and did what one reviewer recommended.

This recipe is absolutely delicious and tastes just like the soup you can get at the famous Italian restaurant!  My only critique is that is a little too spicy for my taste (and I enjoy spicy food), so I would use 3/4 to 1 tsp of crushed red pepper instead of 1 1/4 tsp.

Delicious! Used kale instead of spinach and had to add more chicken broth because it got a little too thick.

Good Flavor. I was a little confused using sliced potatoes but in the end it worked OK, I did let it simmer quite a while before eating which made the potatoes not really sliced so much anymore but the taste was good.

Super tasty.  I used kale but other than that followed the recipe exactly.  I wish I'd made this sooner since it's going to be summer and not soup weather.

Delicious!!!  The broth of this soup is spot on!  Minor changes I made were I eliminated the red pepper flakes and did 1/2 hot italian sausage and 1/2 regular pork sausage.  Great combo and my kids even enjoyed it!  I also subsituted kale instead of spinach and let it sit a few minutes to soften before eating.  GREAT RECIPE!  THANKS!!!!

this was pretty good.  i made  few subs to make it healthier.  i used turkey sausage and turkey bacon and fat free 1/2 & 1/2 and added kale instead of spinach.  i bet if i had made as is it would have been out of this world and i probably will make as the recipe states just to see how it compares to the restaurant version.

Awesome soup! Only change I made was to use Al Fresco pre-cooked sweet Italian chicken sausage (12 oz pkg) ground up, so I skipped step1.  I also used pre-cooked bacon and sauteed the onion and garlic in olive oil. Followed the rest of the recipe.  Yum! I've used both kale and spinach ~ both are good!

This soup was absolutely delicious! I will definitely use this recipe again. I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because cooking the red pepper flakes in the beginning created a toxic fume in my kitchen! Both my boyfriend and I were coughing from the spicy fumes and we had to stop cooking to let the kitchen air-out. Next time I will probably use less red pepper flakes (maybe just 1 tespoon) and add them a little later to the broth so they're less likely to create those awful fumes...

Made this soup and followed the recipe pretty closely. I didn't have any crushed red pepper flakes so I used 3/4 tsp of Cayenne pepper instead (little warm on the taste buds!). I also added extra bacon to get more of that wonderful taste! Company loved the soup and I served it with homemade Italian bread from this site. What a hit!

Our family really enjoyed this soup.  We left out the red pepper flakes to be more "family" friendly. I made it in a crockpot....adding the cooked sausage, bacon, cream & spinach about 15 min before serving.  Even my 8 year old boy declared it "delicious!"

This soup is AMAZING, my husband begs for it all the time!  I took others suggestions and used less potatoes and kale instead of spinach.  We went to the "chain" a week or so after I made this and dediced this was way better!  Thanks for sharing!

Love, love, love this recipe!  Only thing I did different was use hot Italian sausage.  It eliminates the need to add crushed red pepper.  My mouth waters every time I think of this soup.

This was delicious!  I usually make the lower fat version that is also on this site, but this is much creamier and tastier.  It really does taste like Olive Garden's!  Although I don't remember OG's having bacon in it, it does add to the authentic taste!

This is the best!! I added a little italian seasonings.  Other then that, I followed the recipe as writen.  Zuppa Soup from Olive Garden is a favorite of my husbands and he said this is by far better!  Thank you so much for this great recipe!!

Absolutely delicous...very flavorful.  I made it with hot italian sausage and omitted the red pepper flakes and it still had some kick.  It was a real hit with my husband and will definitely be a keeper to share with others.

Favorite Soup! To make just like "restaurant" I used kale instead of spinach. I also used 1 tsp of onion powder instead of onions since I don't like actualy onions. You must get a GOOD sausage... if you wouldn't eat plain with your breakfast then it won't be good to eat in your soup!

OH MY GOSH!  This was great.  My husband ranked it as his second favorite soup of all times (knowing that he had better say my potato soup is the best).  I made it as called for except for the spinach. Yuk!  We loved it and will have it many more times.  Thanks for the recipe.  Update:  Today we had the soup made with sliced red potatoes with the skin on.  It was even better this way!  We just can't get enough of it.

This soup is delicious!  I have made it twice now and the second time, I doubled the recipe to accomodate my dinner party.  I have substituted Kale in place of the Spinach and it works heavenly.  This soup was a huge hit and it tastes just like that of Olive Garden if not better.  Super easy, super yummy!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Best soup ever!  I made this for a supper club I belong to, and the members said it was the best soup they had ever had.  Everyone was begging for the recipe.  I forgot to add the spinach, and didn't miss it at all.  I think from now on I will omit it on purpose!  For those Canadians: heavy cream = whipping cream.

I got some kale from the CSA and the first thing I thought of was zuppa tusana soup.  (Forget the spinach, that is all wrong as spinach gets mushy.)  I cooked it the day before and waited to put the kale in as I reheated it.   Awesome soup, and I am not much of a soup eater.

Just the recipe I was searching for.  I used kale in place of the spinach, omitted red pepper flakes(2 & 6 yr olds were going to to eat it), half heavy cream and half fat free half & half, and I cubed the red potatoes.  The entire family thoroughly enjoyed.

This turned out great with a few minor modifications. I used pork sausages made locally that claim to be lower in fat, I used fat-free half and half and kale instead of spinach. My husband and his buddy loved it, it went great with the homebread I made. Next time I will add more potato, it didnt have quite enough.

Nice recipe.  Definitely better with kale.  Personally I like a lot of kale b/c it adds an interesting texture to the soup - also makes it a little more healthy and balances the flavor/spice of the sausage.  Make sure you remove the tough stems of the kale.

INCREDIBLE SOUP I modified it slightly for a smaller pot and preference. I used 2 cans chicken broth, 1 quart water, only 2 large baking potatoes (which was PLENTY), and 2 cups of chopped Kale instead of spinach. I love the firm texture of the kale and it was just as I remember the restaurant soup!   This is a keeper!!!

I couldn't believe was able to make something that tasted that good so easily! I would highly encourage readers to try this out. I used half and half instead of heavy cream and thickened the soup up with around tablespoon of cornstarch. I also like almost all other reviewers used kale instead of spinach. You can adjust the spiciness to your liking with the red peppers and add other ingredients such as mushrooms, zucchini or other veggies. Enjoy!!!

OH My God! This is so good! I loved it. I just had a cup and I couldn't believe how good this was. Like another reviewer suggested, I replaced the cream with the milk and it tasted great and I loved the fact that it wasn't too rich. My husband had three cups and loves it. Thank you so much!!!

Delicious!!!  Used lean hot turkey sausage, fat free 1/2 and 1/2 instead of the cream, and fat free/low sodium chix broth, and frozen spinach as I had no fresh.....I also only used 2 medium potatoes thinly sliced instead of the 6 called for....this was sooooo good. My family loved it, I added more red pepper flakes to my bowl. Will make again.....loved it! Thanks!

Easy to make.  Turned out a lot better than I'd expected.  The family RAVED on it.  But I'd prefer it with a bit less fat.  Next time I'll drain the sausage better and use milk instead of cream.  Otherwise, EXCELLENT.

This soup is just happy!!  It's just what I was looking for, when craving the popular chain's version.  Like most other reviewers, I too used Kale instead of Spinach.  Other then that.... Was great.  Thanks for Sharing!!!!

My husband loved this! I substituted a few ingredients because I had them on hand, half & half for the cream, hot spicy Italian sausage and I didn't put the spinach in the big pot, but put it at the bottom of the dish each time we heated up a bowl of it. I will definitely be making it again!

Yummy! I used hot Italian sausage, omitted bacon and red pepper flakes and 1 can of fat free evaporated milk for the cream. I use Herboxo salt free chicken bouillon for the chicken stock. I now make it with kale as we prefer that over the spinach if available. Used 1/4 tsp each pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, oregano and 1 bay leaf for seasoning.

I used hot italian sausage and just a little crushed red pepper and the heat factor was fine. I also agree with most reviews that this is better the next day.  I used a little cornstarch to thicken - otherwise it is pretty then.  I liked it, but probably won't make again.  Not a huge fan of the sausage.

As previous reviewers (and my own restaurant experiences) dictated, I also switched out the spinach for kale, using one bunch, as well as using hot Italian sausage in lieu of mild & red pepper flakes.  This recipe turned out WONDERFUL and was super easy to make.  I will definitely be making this again!

Love this recipe and now we don't have to wait to go to the restaurant to enjoy it.  I followed the recipe, except used kale in place of the spinach.  It was wonderful.  Thanks for sharing!  Update:  We ate at the Olive Garden last night and I had to have the soup to compare.  This is as good or better!!

This recipe is excellent!  The only change that I made was to use kale instead of spinach.  It tastes just as good as OG's soup if not better!

Made this soup last night and for once it filled everyone up like a meal (with soft bread loaves on the side of course)  the flavor was rich and delicious, much like the potato sausage soup I recently tried at a local chains..  YUM!

I made it in a crock pot, and added the cream at the end of cooking.  We added the spinach to our individual bowls.  We also had to add salt.  Tasted good, and I will probably make it again.

Was a very good soup. We don't like ours real spicy so just added 1/2 tsp red pepper. And upon tasting before serving, found it did need something so added 1/2 tsp Italian seasoning, 1/4 tsp fennel. All in all a very good soup

This was absolutely delicious!  It makes a lot, but we enjoyed having the leftovers.  I didn't add the spinach to the whole batch, but added it to each bowl individually as we heated it up.  Very tasty!  My husband loved it!  I looked like a star cook. :)

Loooooved this soup!  My family and our guest went on and on about how good it was, better than the chain restaurant's version! I used kale instead of spinach, but I think either would be good.  Thanks for a great soup recipe, definitely a keeper.

This is spot-on, probably better than the real thing! It's nice to know also exactly what is in the soup, and have control over that.  I throw in a  whole head of kale and my hubby and kids even love the kale (this is a miracle) Great recipe.

Holy cow. This is so much better than O.G.'s! I made (very) few substitutions on this; My in-laws are English, and they don't like really spicy stuff, so we added two more potatoes, a bit more broth and a bit more cream to this, and reduced the red pepper just a bit. SO GOOD! This is definitely going into my steady rotation, especially for the winter. Thank you, souporsweets!

this is delicious, my husband called it the best soup he has ever had and said he hoped there was enough for leftovers tonight!  I browned the bacon a little first, then added the sausage with the pepper flakes, onion, and garlic and cooked it till well browned, drained that and then added my sliced potatoes and stirred them around with the meat for about 10 minutes just to let them pick up the flavors of the meat, then i stirred in the broth and cooked till the potatoes were soft and then added my cream.  Not everyone at my house will eat spinach so we just put a handful of spinach in our bowls and ladled the hot soup over it.  This is a classic "comfort soup" and will definitly be a go to recipe at our house.

Wow, this was delicious!  Thanks souporsweets!  We substituted kale for the spinach and nearly quadrupled it.  This turned out fantastic!  Our friends said it was better than OG's soup because it had the bacon added.  Never tried OG's soup and now I don't need to!  :)  Loved how I could cook the meat, onion and garlic ahead of time and slice the potatoes the night before.  It makes it very easy to serve for company!  Serve with a great salad and some bread and you've got yourself a winner!  :D

This was fabulous. I took others suggestions and used kale instead of spinach and added it just before I served each bowl and it was the perfect texture for the soup.  I also used yellow potatoes.  This soup doesn't leave a heavy feeling, so it's perfect with small salad and bread.  I'll make this again for sure.

Just like the restaurant's recipe- definitely company worthy!  I swap out the spinach for kale.  It holds its texture and crunch rather than getting limp and soggy.

So, so good!  I left out the red pepper flakes because I was giving it to my two year old; other than that, I made no changes.  My whole family loved it.  Will make it again.

Love this soup! I was trying to recreate the one from the Olive Garden but this came out even better.  I ommitted the bacon and i substituted kale for spinach and spicy italian sausage instead of mild.

I don't live near an Olive Garden anymore, so when I found this recipe I was so excited to make it. It tastes just like I remember. This was my favorite soup there!

Hot Italian sausage was used, mild is too sweet.  I only used 2 large baking potatoes diced and slivered fresh kale. I also added fresh cracked triple colored peppercorns.  Too salty, but adequate.

I ran out of red pepper flakes and used turkey sausage. So my review reflects those minor changes. My family and myself did not care for this soup. All the ingredients together sound good on paper but for us it didn't carry through.

I love this soup!  Even my husband who is not a big soup fan really likes it too!  I have made a few changes in the recipe, though.  I substitute Hot Italian Turkey sausage and omit the pepper flakes and I only use 1/2 an onion.  Everyone raves about this soup.  Very Yummy!

Absolutely delicious!  I also substituted kale for the spinach and omitted the bacon and it turned out perfectly, just like in the restaurant.  I ended up using 4 large potatoes and that was plenty, 6 might be too much, but you can always adjust the chicken broth and cream if you have too many potatoes.

LOVED THIS! Great on a cold night! I omitted the red pepper flakes, to tone down the heat for the kids, and I made small cubes instead of thin slices of the potatoes. It was wonderful, simple and pleased the whole bunch! THANKS!

This soup is abcolutely fantastic! I made in on a chilly night when we had family over! Now they want the recipe!! It is exact to the Zuppa Toscana that I had out in a restaurant!! I didn't put quite as much broth as it called for. And it turned out remarkable! Thank you so much for the recipe!!

So good! I've made this about a dozen times and wouldn't change a thing! It also freezes really well and tastes even better leftover (add a little more broth) when the potato breaks down.

FABULOUS!!! i have looked for a while for an at home version of my favorite "italian restaurant" soup and now i have it!  i also used hot sausage, patted the excess fat off, used a little pepper flake and used kale. i love the way the dull kale turns bright green in the soup! absolutely amazing!

This was deliscious!  I would have made it ExACT, however, I didn't have all of the ingredients on hand.  It didn't matter... This was T-rrific.  I used liquid smoke instead of bacon and fat-free half-half.  I made it early in the am and let it sit... So good.  Perfect for chilly wet day!

This soup is delicious! I definitely recommend using kale instead of spinach, as many have suggested.  Also, I like to use fat free half and half and add it just before serving.  This recipe is wonderful and better than the chain's soup!

This was a great recipe. I was nervous because this soup is the reason I go to Olive Garden and I thought it would be hard to duplicate but it wasn't.  As suggested in previous reviews I skipped the red pepper flakes and used Kale instead of Spinach. This soup will be in heavy rotation at my house.

Delicious! Used Kale rather than spinach and a little extra red pepper and I thought it was better than the one Olive Garden serves. BF loved it, I loved it with some extra hot sauce. yummy, and really is perfect for a hot day.

I've been sick and asked my daughter to make this for the family.  She has followed a recipe only one other time with more than 4 ingredients.  AWESOME!  The soup was awesome.  Since I didn't want to waste the other part of the fresh spinach, I asked her to put the whole bunch in.  It was not overwhelming.  This is delicious and I would serve it to my guests at a dinner party.  A KEEPER

This soup was really good. I used kale like many other users did. I also used red potatoes instead of russets, because I wanted them to hold their shape a little better after they were sliced and cooked. Great flavor, a little spicy and really tasted like that popular chain restaurant's soup.

"this is so good, this is so good"  is all i heard when i served this soup.  it has now fallen in the catagory of our top three soups!!! we have never had the zuppa from o.garden.  so had nothine to compare it to but oh my goodness this soup was amazing.  i did add extra garlic and onion of course, and used kale instead of spin.  used 3 small russets i did slice them but i think next time i will cube they didnt hold up that well in the cooking process.  it is so good.  just the right amount of spice.  thanks for the keeper.

I loved this the way I made it. I omitted the onions and spinach (I don't like either). I didn't have any bacon either, but without these ingredients it was still excellent. I used red potatoes with the skin on. Very yummy. Next time I will use bacon.

i have made this a bunch of times.  Fab Soup.  I do soak the potato slices in water while i am prepping everything else.  The potatoes will stiffen and hold their shape after cooking.  Makes for a better looking soup.

This was WONDERFUL. I tweaked it just a tiny bit. Instead of the 4 slices of bacon I used a couple tablespoons of the pre cooked bacon pieces and threw them into the sausage when it was nearly browned. Got the flavor without the fat. And instead of the cream I used a can of low fat evaporated milk mixed with a couple tablespoons of cornstarch. That gives you a little more feel of the cream without the fat also.  And I used kale instead of spinach. Loved it! and so did hubby. I'll be begged to make this again and again.

Turned out really good for the first cool New England day of the year.  I used turkey sausage, browned it with bit of EVOO, onion, green pepper, celery, garlic and red pepper flakes.  Added the chicken stock, 6 cubed red potatoes with the skin on and a whole bunch of chopped kale (no stems).  Brought to a boil and then added the bacon and simmered for an hour.  Finished it off with a cup of light cream.  Served it with the roasted garlic bread on this site.  Hubby thought it was fantabulous!

Easy to make but we prefer less pepper flakes.  Will try again with 1/2 the pepper.

The whole family absolutely loves this recipe.  I used kale instead of spinach and milk with baking soda instead of heavy cream.  Everything about this is DELISCIOUS!!!!

delicious!! ~ although the recipe as is lacks a little flavor, so I changed the recipe a little bit -  lots of garlic, some fresh spices - thyme, bay leaf and a little oregano , to cut the fat a little bit I used turkey sausage (not ground just cut into 1/4 slices)and only added about a half a cup of the heavy cream - next time I'm going to try using kale instead of the spinach :)

We love this soup and it is so easy! I drained the Italian sausage in a colander for at least 30 minutes to eliminate a lot of the fat and used fewer red pepper flakes.  I used chopped kale instead of spinach.  I like the texture that the kale provides.  Will make this many, many more times. Tastes exactly like the restaurant version.

Absolutely amazing soup! We didn't use a dutch oven but a toaster oven. When it came down to putting the ingredients together, it was over the stove top. This soup is up there with Olive Gardens toscana soup!

Amazing recipe. A few changes I made: I did not add bacon, used less potatoes (4), used fat free half and half, and added kale at the end. Since I didn't use bacon, after I drained the meat I just added the rest of the ingredients to the pot in the order given. Perfect!

It's been raining for over a week here and the weather is cooling off.  Surprised my wife with this recipe and she loved it.  She's taking some for leftovers to work tomorrow and said she's can't wait.  Very very good and easy to make.  As a tip I just put some of the spinach in the bottom of the bowl and then poured the soup on top.  Within a minute the spinach was slightly wilted and good to go.

The BEST Zuppa Toscana!!! My whole family absolutely enjoyed this!  I made it exactly as written, I can't imagine changing a thing.  Some reviews suggested using kale instead of spinach but, OMG... it was perfect. It was a little spicy although all ages loved this soup from 3yrs old to 19.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!! Oh yeah, I almost forgot.. I made the parmesan knots from this site to go with it and it was a perfect combination.

I have had this in my Wish list for a long while. i finally made it and boy oh boy was it good! The family wasn't as crazy about it as I was but I am the one writing the review so I say 5 stars! I doubled the recipe and used mustard greens instead of spinach b/c I found a bag of it for .99, I also used 2 boxes of a gratin potatoes w/ the seasoning  and used those in place of the fresh potatoes. I loved this soup!  Thank You Souporsweets!

Excellent!  I've used other zuppa toscana recipes, but this is my favorite.  Using kale is a must, in my opinion.  I completely forgot to add the red pepper flakes, it still tastes great.  The only problem I run across with this soup is the potatoes falling apart.  I may try slicing them a little thicker next time.

This is incredible.. I made this with a few changes.. I used Kale instead of spinach.. I used fat free half&half instead of cream.. I used 5 small red potatoes, and cut down on the red pepper since we dont like it too spicy.. But overall this was great! I also topped with some fresh grated reggiano cheese... Absolutely fab!

Oh my goodness.  This recipe is amazing and so much like that famous restaurant's soup.  I did adjust a few things for my family's tastes.  I omitted the red pepper flakes.  I used Italian sausages instead of bulk sausages -- love the pieces instead of crumbles. Also, using kale instead of spinach is a MUST.  Kale just makes this soup, IMHO.

Awesome! Really easy and delicious. I used Kale instead of Spinach and put that in at the same time as the potatoes. Use hot sausage instead of mild and then you can omit the extra ingredient of red pepper flakes. I also used low-fat milk in the place of cream. Perfect!

Is better than Olive Garden...so good with a crust of bread. I used Kale as well because it held up better than spinach in the soup. I also used a bit more red pepper for an extra kick. I have made it several times and it never disappoints

Perfect name!  This soup is delicious!  I even took some to the neighbor because I was so impressed with the outcome.  My husband loved it and asked me to save the recipe.  We doubled the batch and put a bunch in the freezer for those cold winter nights!

A very nice soup! One thing I did differently - this soup was too runny for me. So, I added cornstarch to thicken it up. It was amazing!

I think I made it wrong or something.  I'll try again - will definitely use kale next time.

I thought this tasted exactly like the OG version, which I like, so I really liked this. I did use kale instead of spinach, milk with cornstarch instead of cream, and hot instead of mild sausage. I kept a sprinkle of red pepper flakes and didn't find the result too hot. In fact, next time I'll add more red pepper. I also tossed in some fennel per another review.   My only complaint is that I found this too thick. I'm not sure what other people did to make it too thin, but next time I'll add a little extra broth or something to thin it out. Regardless, I give it 5 stars for tasting like what I expected. The things I'd like to fix will be easy enough to fix next time. Thanks!

We love it!!  Maybe a bit spicy, so we've cut the pepper flakes to 1/4 teaspoon.  Great way to ear fresh spinach and we pile it on the plate before pouring the soup so it begins to wilt when you eat it.  Great recipe!!!

This soup is really good but there is a FANTASTIC recipe for baked potato soup on this site that has the same consistency. I think next time I will use the baked potato soup recipe and just add in the sausage and spinach. The ultimate comfort soup!

Different but delicious soup!  I added zucchini because I had it.  I did chop the potatoes and used frozen spinach.  I also added fresh oregano, thyme and basil from my garden.  I finished with Parm Reggiano and it was delicious.

I love this soup. This recipe is very simple to make and was a huge hit. You can fiddle with ingredients and it will still be tasty. I did use kale instead of spinach since I have never seen it served with spinach and I left out the bacon as well. I had it in a restaurant without bacon and thought it was better plus it is healthier. I do not eat pork so I did use turkey sausage. No one noticed. lol

The title says it all.  This was just super delicious and just like the restaurant.  I made a few changes to suit our taste.  I only added one crushed dried red chili pepper so it's not that spicy for the kids.  I also used kale, as that's what the restaurant uses.  My whole family loved it.  Even my 5 year old son whom I could not get to eat soup at all, had seconds.  A family favorite.

My family loves this recipe.  I took it to our family Easter dinner and everyone had to tell me how good it was! It was the perfect dish for a rainy day.  The red pepper really makes it great. I also used turkey italian sausage that time, but it tasted the same as when I make it with pork italian sausage.  No one even noticed!! My mom made the recipe with polish sausage and it tasted just as great. Thank you soo much for this recipe!

Wonderful flavor.  Even better with Hot Italian Sausage, especially if you like a bit of kick to the soup.  also added some very thinly sliced carrots for a bit of color.
Just wanted to add that I took this to my quilter's group pot luck and they all wanted the recipe.  I did make it with the hot sausage and they all loved the extra bit of zip.

I made this soup tonight and it is beyond being termed just as good!Good is to small of a word. I had never eaten this soup before and I just loved it. I made mine exactly as directed in the recipe as we love spinach and I would suggest you try it as is before you alter it because you just might prefer this in the original version. I have more for tomorrow in the fridge! Smile!

This soup is awesome!  I manage a senior apartment community & we had a "Soup"er Bowl party.  I made this soup and it was the only one, out of about a dozen types of soups that was completely gone at the end of the event!  The only change I made was to use kale instead of spinach.  It had great flavor!  My husband was disappointed, as he was counting on leftovers for dinner.  I have made it several times since then and he eats several bowls at a time!  Thanks for a great recipe!!

This recipe is for those with ample time and who don't care about the number of calories ingested... It tastes great - for which it gets 5 stars from me. It gets 2 for speed of preparation and 1 for health attributes.

I love this soup (and so do my husband and toddler.)  My only issue is the amount of fat and cholesterol.  I will probably take the suggestion of another reviewer and use turkey sausage next time.

This was pretty good.  I substituted fat free 1/2&1/2 & turkey sausage to cut some fat and calories.  I also added some fennel and cumin as someone else recommended.  I will be making this again.

FANTASTIC recipe! Everyone loved it and had seconds- including my son and nephews! I substituted kale for spinach as others suggested- my husband asked why the "spinach tasted so good" in it- the kale really retained a nice fresh flavor and crispness. I substituted some cut up proscuitto ham both times I made it- didn't have any bacon. It add some nice flavor and texture- I could really take it or leave it though- the soup stand fine on its own without it. The first time I made it, I used ruby gold potatoes, the second time I used russet- both cooked just fine. My husband took leftovers to work and said at least 3 co-workers asked him to have me pass on the recipe! I told him to have them check it out on this site!

This recipe is delicious and also very easy to reduce the fat content. I used all natural chicken sausage and turkey bacon from Trader Joes which really helped. Also could do lowfat milk in place of half the heavy cream. Replacing all the cream will definitely change the flavor, so I keep some of it in. Everybody loved this recipe!

I made this recipe exactly with the exception that I only used half the recommended red pepper flakes because I was afraid it might be too spicy for my 3-year-old.  I thought it was good, but it needed salt, and it also seemed to be missing some kind of seasoning... maybe some parsley or oregano or something.

This was an excellent soup.  It was made ahead and frozen.  Warmed up wonderfully.  Served with sauted naan bread.

Just another rave reviw! I used red potatos, kale, and half & half. I'm not much of a cook and put the kale in to soon, misread the directions, but it still turned out fabulously. Can't go wrong with this one!

This tasty treat has became a staple of the Davis household!!! We use kale fresh from the garden instead of spinach. Made triple recipe and froze for Christmas gifts because of the requests that I get for it.

We love this soup and make it often.  My changes are to use spicy turkey sausage, low sodium broth, more potatoes, and lots of kale for better texture and more body.  The creamy, spicy, comfort feel of this soup is great on cold and rainy days.  Or week nights when you have little time to cook.

i used a mixture of mild and hot italian sausage with kale with this recipe. i also used half and half for the heavy cream but added freshly grated parmesan at the end. the kids didn't even bat their eyelashes with the "monster greens" addition.

Delicious and I used a "quick" version.  I used pre-cooked Johnsville Italian sausage links -- just sliced them.  I was in a hurry, so I used onion powder and garlic salt in place of onions and garlic. I sliced red potatoes and left the skins on. Next time I will use less of the red pepper flakes as it was too spicy for some peoples' taste.

Great soup.  Used kale instead of spinach and I thought it was a little too hot so might cut the pepper flakes in half next time I make it and I will make it again. It really did taste like the soup in the Italian Restaurant.

This soup tastes so much better than it looks!  I've made it several times and it's always delish! Sometimes I use spinach and other times I use kale and it is great both ways.  I've also tried it with heavy cream and fat free half and half with equally excellent results.  You can't go wrong with this one!

I made this recipe, as is, and it tastes just like the Zuppa Toscana at the Olive Garden. I used to work at the OG, and I believe they use kale instead of spinach, though. Either way, this is a super easy and delicious recipe. I recommend to everyone, and I'll be using it again.

I ended up spilling half the bottle of red pepper in the sausage, but I managed to get most of it out.  It was still pretty hot, but it was really good.

I made this for dinner tonight for our family of 5.  It's all gone and I made a large batch!  The only thing I changed was that I had a leek on hand so I threw it in and I used Half and Half.  Don't cut back on the potatoes, unless you have the huge baking potatoes.  It thickens the soup for you.  Next time I make (which I definitely will!) I will make it with a low sodium bacon and maybe turkey Italian sausage.  I found the bacon and sausage I used made it a bit salty for me.  Otherwise, EXCELLENT recipe!  Thanks for posting it!

I love this soup... I used fat free half and half and only 1 large potato, as I prefer a more brothy soup than chunky... i also used Kale... Delicious!  On a side note... I've tried to cut corners and leave the sausage in the pan the whole time, rather than setting it aside and draining it... it still tastes good, but there is an orange grease layer on top of the soup if you do this... doesn't really alter the taste, but it looks a lot better if you drain the sausage (not to mention the extra fat is removed)

I made this delicious soup last night on the coldest night we have had in Texas and now it is darling hubby's (dh) favorite!  I buy organic whenever possible so I made healthy changes to this recipe by substituting: 4 All-natural link Italian Sausages sliced into bite sized pieces (to please dh); One 32 oz.carton Free range chicken broth; organic spinach and I also added sea salt. I also used 5 red potatoes with skins, thinly sliced, they cook faster than the white.

It lived up to everyone's ratings.  It had a lot of flavor, for being pretty simple.  I sliced my potatoes really thin and it only took about 15 min. for them to be ready.  Also, I used kale instead of spinach as suggested and I subbed fat-free half & half for the heavy cream - but that's just b/c I can't afford the extra calories!  I will definitely be making this again - possibly even this winter.

We love this soup.  I substituted rice milk in place of cream and Earth Balance in place of butter, since we don't like dairy.  It still turned out so yummy.

Very nice soup recipe. I ended up making a few substitutions for what I had on hand. I substituted turkey sausage for the italian sausage and prosciutto for the bacon. I also substituted red pepper for the red pepper flakes. And I used milk instead of the heavy cream because that is what I had. All in all, the soup was very tasty even with my substitutions.

This was fabulous and lived up to its description. I used pancetta and kale and it was just like the restaurant. I like my food a bit spicy, but the amount of red pepper flakes turned out to be too hot for me. If you don't like a lot of heat, make sure to adjust that part. I also used turkey Italian sausage and it turned out wonderful. This is definitely a keeper.

Very good. Has a great flavor and can be adjusted to taste easily by changing the type of sausage or the spice. Loved it!

Wow! I made this for an after Christmas dinner party. Big hit. They loved it. Only thing I did different was to put in kale instead of spinach. They all know I'm not really into cooking (although I can fairly well) and were gushing with praise.

Good soup that's different than the usual rotation.  Everyone like it very much... made no changes to recipe as written.

I LOVE this recipe.  I have made it a couple of times now.  The only problem I have is that the oil from the sausage turns the top of the soup orange.

Based on what I had on hand I modified this recipe a bit, but it still turned out terrific!
I used hot italian turkey sausage cooked with casings removed and 1tsp of red pepper, and omitted the bacon (didn't have any).  I also replaced the potato with a head of cauliflower.  I only had one can of chicken broth, so for the remainder I used water and chicken base. 
It was delicious!  
My husband loved it as is, but thought the bacon would make it even better, so I'll definately try that next time.  
This is a wonderful cold weather soup that will be in our regular rotation!

5 stars x a million! If I didn't cook this myself I would have thought someone brought it home from the Olive Garden!  My husband ate 6 bowls...said it was the best soup I ever made!  Thanks so much for sharing!  It is a keeper.  Only change...reduced red pepper flakes to 1 tsp.  Plenty of spice!  Used Bob Evens Italian sausage and fresh spinach and of course heavy whipping cream...not on the Weight Watcher menu!:)  But so worth it!  Next time I am serving with garlic bread sticks and a nice salad with Italian dressing!  Can't wait!  Thanks again for sharing!

Very easy and delicious. My  husband said it was better than Olive Garden's version. I used hot turkey italian sausage, cut the potatoes into chunks (on accident), used a 12 oz. can of evaporated milk in place of cream, and after browning the meat I put everything in the crockpot to simmer for about 6 hours. Turned out delicious!

Great recipe! I used less chicken broth (because I didn't have enough) and substituted water. I also used milk instead of heavy cream, and kale instead of spinach. Everyone had seconds, so it was good!

This soup was great! I did make a couple changes. I used 2 large baking potatoes and used my mandolin to slice them really thin. Only needed to heat them for 6 min to make them really tender. I used kale instead of spinach. And last but not least I added 2 T of sugar to sweeten it up a bit because the kale can be kinda bitter sometimes.

Excellent.  Tastes very close to Olive Garden's version.  My husband said, "best soup ever!".  Update: I made this for my husband's grandfather, who is always putting down my cooking.  Well, he told my mother-in-law that the soup was "excellent"!  She and I were extremely shocked, and I was delighted that it passed his taste test.  Thank you for this recipe!

Fantastic!  I used non fat half and half and the heavy cream was not at all missed.  I also used kale after reading the suggestions of others and only 3 large russets.  I used hot sausage and it gave the broth a red oily film so next time I will definitely buy mild sausage and add more red pepper flakes instead.

This is a good soup, but I followed others advice and put in less potatoes(4).  It really needed all the potatoes.  If anything, I wish the recipe put the amount of potatoes needed in cups measurement because of the range of sizes of potatoes.

I have found the exact recipe for Olive Garden's version. It's the same as this one. I recommend using kale instead of spinach, it adds the right amount of crunch. This soup is absolutely delicious! My family can't get enough of it!

This is so good!  I followed the directions to a T - with exception of the spinach, as I was going to substitute kale but couldn't find it at my local grocery store...but it was great without it!  I will definitely be making this soup again - and my family loves it too!

We (those of us who would eat it) liked this soup.  I didn't use bacon, and it still seemed to be kind of greasy.  I cut the potatoes in chunks to save on prep time.

Excellent and easy.  Bacon is optional, in my opinion.  This is best made with kale if you're going to "hold" it because kale maintains a better texture.

Hubby and I love this soup - we think it is better than the one found at the chain restaurant, mainly because this one is thicker and richer.  Only change is I use fresh kale instead of spinach most of the time (less expensive).  Enjoy!

This is a meal.  I doubled the recipe using 1 large can of chicken broth, a whole bulb of garlic, 1 large bag of spinach, and a cup of water.  I fried up the bulk italian sausage with a little olive oil for 2 minutes.  Then I added the chopped onion and 1/2 the minced garlic. I have never added the bacon. It just doesn't need it and it's one extra step I don't have time for.

this is my new favorite zuppa toscana recipe.  I don't have a dutch oven, so I removed the casing off of 16 oz of italian sausage and baked them for 25 minutes at 350 degrees and then cut lengthwise and sliced diagonally.  In a large pot I sauteed onions and garlic in 1/4 t crushed red pepper and added the chopped bacon when the onions were tender.  Next I added the rest of the ingredients as listed in the recipe; however, I used 2 cups of shredded kale instead of spinach.

Very good!  I didn't use heavy cream--just skim milk and a bit of flour added to it.  Also cut down on the spinach and onion.  Very tasty soup!

I made this a couple of days ago and it was a tremendous hit. My hubby is super picky and he said its a keeper. Thanks so much, this is going into our favorites file! The only difference I made was that I used kale instead of spinach, but I'm going to try and use spinach next.

really really good!  tastes just like olive garden's.  kale is definitely better in this soup, and I only used a 1/2 cup of heavy cream which I found to be enough (I didn't want the soup to be completely white).  I also used the bacon crumbles found in the salad dressing section of the grocery store as they were more afforadable and didn't require cooking.   Will definitely make again and again!

My family said that this is the best meal I've ever cooked!
There wasn't a drop left.  I expected it to be mild because it called for mild italian sausage, but browning it with the crushed red pepper gave it quite a kick.  What a great cold-weather meal.

Very good!! However, I will look for a better quality italian sausage next time. I used a name brand from a supermarket and it didn't have the quality taste of the famous restaurant.

Awesome soup, made this on a rainy sunday with a loaf of bread and it made the day.  I left out the green stuff.  Hubby and kids won't touch anything green.  Tasted just like the Zuppa at the chain italian restaurant we frequent!!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Thanks for the recipe. This  soup is delecious!  I used can spinach instead of kale and I think it made it just as tasty as the restaurant version of which I am a huge fan.

This soup is great, I did change a few things. The main difference is that I used kale instead of spinach. Also omitted the red pepper, other than that this recipe is a keeper. Using the mild italian sausage rather than kielbasa (as another recipe on this site suggests )makes the soup taste just like the one at italian restraunts.

Great soup!  I didn't have any spinach so I left that out.  That was the only thing I changed.  It is not supposed to be a thick soup, it is a thin soup, so do not worry about adding corn starch or anything to thicken it.  

I used red potatoes and left the skin on so that seemed to help hold my thin potato slices together while they cooked.

This was one of best dishes I ever made...so full of flavor! We ended up having it as the main course. I reduced the amount of chicken broth and potatoes by half, and added a little bit more bacon.  Delicious!

I have a similar recipe for Zuppa Toscana. (I can't remember where the recipe came from.) I use kale instead of spinach, heavy cream, russet potato, spicy Italian sausage, crushed red pepper and salt. I don't use bacon, though.

We love this! This is the second time I am making this for my husband and I- I couldn't get enough of it! We made a few changes- 4-5 small potatoes instead of 6, and we used Tofurkey Italian-Style "Sausage" instead of regular sausage, and kale instead of spinach. It is wonderful, reheats well time and again and is delicious.

Thanks for our new favorite soup!

Outstanding recipe!  I was hunting for another recipe and came across this one.  It just so happened that I had everything I needed on hand so I decided to make this recipe instead.  The Kale worked well in the soup.  I did cut back on the red pepper flakes to 3/4 tsp for the kids sake but it was still very good.  Only mistake was not having French Bread on hand to go with the soup.  Next time!

This is EXACT! My fiance orders 3 bowls when we go to Olive Garden and we have been searching for  a great recipe that we can me at home. This is IT! Only differences we had were that we used hot sausage so we didn't need the pepper flakes and we like to use kale vs. spinach. Thank You!

Awesome soup!  I am glad I didn't cut down on the potatoes like some reviews said because I think that is what gives the broth a thicker texture.  Next time I might even add an extra potato.  When I bought the sausage my market only had it in 1 1/2 lbs and I ended up using all of it because I was so hungry and it wasn't too much for the soup to handle.  I can't wait to eat the leftovers!

This soup is quite possibly the best soup I've ever had. Very easy and fast to make which is a big plus. I used turkey Italian-style sausage and kale instead of spinach.  Thank you for a terrific recipe that will go into the permanent file at our house.

I liked this recipe as I read it and liked it even more when I made it. I skipped the potatoes since they aren't in our low carb meal plan (but I did add 2 sm stalks of chopped celery). Once the sausage, bacon, onions and garlic were sauted, I tossed them into the crock-pot. I deglazed the pan with my homemade chicken broth to get some of the flavors into the soup, then added to the crock as well. I waited until 15 to 20 minutes before serving to add the spinach and cream. I thicken with a bit of guar gum. Since the meat was cooked, I set crock-pot on low for 3.5 hours. Served with a crustless broccoli quiche and a homemade low-carb chocolate cake in celebration of the Pope's arrival and His Birthday today. Very good! Could have sprinkled with some Parmesano Reggiano...will do it tomorrow with my leftovers and it will reach 5 stars immediately.

This soup is a winner.  I will make it for my next gathering for sure!  I used 6 slices of the thick cut applewood bacon.  I used a pint of heavy whipping cream, and I used the spicy italian sausage instead of the mild and just tailored the red pepper to taste since my family likes a spicier soup.  Also I used Tones chicken base instead of the broth (it has a more full bodied robust flavor than plain broth).  I added some cornstarch to thicken.  Needless to say last nights dinner was a hit and guess what I am sitting here eating for breakfast :)

Very good. Taste's just like I've tried it in one of my favorite italian restaurants but heartier. Although I did make some changes: I substituted spinach with kale and used bacon crumbles(the real kind)and milk instead of cream. I have made it several times! Thanks!

My family and I were amazed by this recipe!  It's like eating at Olive Garden without all the sodium!  The only thing I changed was to use Jimmy Dean's breakfast sausage roll b/c that's all I had on hand... and it worked wonderfully!  I've always wanted to make Zuppa Toscana at home and now I can!  Thanks so much for sharing!

My boyfriend loves this. I haven't tried it myself since I do not eat meat, but I trust him. Use Cavallo greens or Kale instead of spinach, since that is what you will find in the original version of this recipe (from the popular Italian chain restaurant). If you're in a hurry and don't want to make bacon, just use Oscar Meyer Real Bacon Pieces.

Delicious and tasted every bit as good as the OG version!  I surprised my hubby last week with this one, and he was absolutely floored!  It is one of our favorite soups to get when we eat out, so it was awesome to have the recipe to make it at home, too.  The only changes I made was using kale instead of the spinach and half and half in place of the heavy cream.  I agree with some other users, the bacon could probably be omitted with minimal taste impact.

I really enjoyed it. Can't say it's the same as the OG version - hence not giving it a 5 ... but I will definitely be making it again. Thank you!

My family enjoyed this soup very much.  I made some changes--half and half instead of cream, used part sweet and part hot italian sausage, and darn kids would not let me put any kale or spinach in!  Didn't need the bacon; plenty of flavor without it.  Would be good (and quick) with canned cannellini beans instead of potaotes.  Yummy and will make again!

Use less crushed red pepper...maybe 1 teaspoonful.

I love this soup! I tried it at Olive Garden and just HAD to learn how to make it myself. I don't eat pork, so I used turkey sausage instead and I omitted the bacon. I also cut the amount of cream in half, but it was just as I remembered. I also made garlic bread and a salad to go with it. I highly recommend this recipe!

Very good!  I used 1/3 pkg of frozen chopped spinach instead of fresh, and I added celery, carrot and a can of white beans. Very filling, a lot of flavor, will make again.
