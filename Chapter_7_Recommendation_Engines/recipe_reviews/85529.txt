I'll try this recipe again - but use cream of mushroom soup instead of heavy cream and cornstarch. I'll also let it simmer longer to tenderize the meat more...maybe try it in a crockpot?

I was desperate for an easy recipe with the ingredients I had on hand.... The milk curdled in the pan.. I don't know what I did wrong.

I didn't have a few of the ingredients.  I subbed evap. milk for the heavy cream, no red peppers, dry ginger and canned mushrooms.  But with a little extra worcestershire, some extra evap. milk, and ginger I thought it was tasty.  It was kind of like a stroganoff with a little zip(think vinegar).  Not bad for stew beef.

Ok, not the best.  I had a bell pepper I needed to use up that needed to be sauted as it was past the time when you would want to eat it raw as ti was kind of wilted and wrinkly.  So I set out to find a recipe that I could use it with that I had all the rest of the ingredients to and I found this one.  I wasn't too sure if I wanted to make it after reading the other reviews but decided to go ahead and give it a try.  The recipe was definitely lacking flavor and I had to add a few things to give it at least some taste.  After that it wasn't bad although still could use some work.

I tried this one with regular rice, and I cut out the peppers, because my husband doesn't like them. We loved it!! The only thing I would suggest is to up the corn starch as you go, it was kinda runny at 1st, so I added slowly and it thickened right up. But we like our cream beef to be thick, so I guess its up to your preferance!!

I thought it was great, I added cream of mushroom, celery, a lot of onion, and some extra seasonings.

Often  when I see recipes with low star ratings, I try them in the hope of being able to provide a redeeming five star rating. This was not the case. I took note of the review that said the meat was tough so I decided to cook the stew meat in my pressure cooker.  Success! Tender stew meat.  I then saut√©ed the vegetables, making sure to add the minced garlic and ginger at the end to prevent a burned, bitter taste. I added my heavy cream and cornstarch and it thickened quite nicely.  All this to say this recipe needs seasoning, and I won't bother making it again.
