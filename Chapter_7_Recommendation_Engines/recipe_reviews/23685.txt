OMG Jen - Thank you so much.  This review is from a person who had to go outside when my mom or anyone cooked cabbage!  Could not stand the smell.  This recipe is great. The only thing I did different and proably everyone else knew to do this - but I have never, ever cooked cabbage - I did add salt and pepper and covered it to help wilt the cabbage faster.  Not for too long and when thoroughly cooked, it was still a little crisp and delicious.  I loved it and my family did as well. I am 67 y/o and considered to be a good cook in my circle, but this recipe absolutely tops all of mine.  Thank you so very much.  A fan!

I am not sure what those who gave the recipe "mediocre" or bad ratings were expecting. As one can see, it is a very simple recipe with a very simple result. I would not omit the vinegar, as in such a small amount compared to the volume of cabbage, i dont feel that it could be offensive. but i do think it adds a subtle and important flavor. I also suggest increasing the amount of bacon to your taste. I mean, its bacon, so the more the merrier. i used 5 slices. also, this is one of those dishes that makes for leftovers that get better and better.

I did a vegetarian version - loved this dish.
I fried onion and a clove of garlic in butter rather than bacon, and added balsamic vinegar rather than cider - it was delicious, will definetly be making agin. (I served it with a cheesy tomato vegetable casserole and it was great!)

This is absolutely WONDERFUL.  I covered it after sauteeing the cabbage and bacon together. After sauteeing, I cooked 20-30 minutes covered, and put in the splash of vinegar (balsamic, since I didn't have cider), and it was just incredible!!!!  I NEVER liked cabbage before, was sort of indifferent towards it, but this recipe is INCREDIBLE!!! Yum yum yum!!!!!  This stuff cooks down so very sweet, and I never added sugar...! GOLLY, how wonderful!!!!!

We love this stuff! I use an entire head of cabbage, a whole pound of bacon and sprinkle a little garlic powder on the cabbage while it's cooking. I use lots more vinegar than called for and no water, just splash it on right from the bottle. We love the tang of the vinegar. We can make a meal of this alone.

Let's just say that my fiance has never before brought up dinner two hours later and thanked me again. What a hit! This is top notch comfort food. 
I used butter and omitted the bacon all together. I just can't bring myself to cook with bacon fat - sorry! We used a little extra vinegar as well.  This is quick and easy.

Very enjoyable.  Much better tasting than plain fried cabbage with a little bacon drippings.  If you like spicier, might try sauteing some sliced banana peppers with the onion.

This is a great recipe and I keep having a craving for it.  It is very similar to my southern Mamaw's Wilted Lettuce.  I did double the bacon.  I used the cider vinegar the first time and balsamic the second and really couldn't tell much difference.  Now I know everyone else omitted the sugar but I added about a Tablespoon as I like it sweet.  Served it with barbecued polish sausage and we all loved it.  Very good - thank you so much.

You only really need 4 ingredients for this recipe to be really great: 8 slices bacon fried...whole onion chopped... head of cabbage chopped and salt to taste. Fry the cabbage and onions in the bacon grease until it falling apart. I've been eating this for around 50 years and there is no better food!

Maybe I didn't use enough cabbage (I just used 1 large bag of pre-shredded coleslaw) but the cidar vinegar slightly overpowered the dish. It wasn't bad and I might try playing around with this in the future to get it right.

This is one of my favorite comfort foods.  I make mine a little different though.  I always add about 3 potatoes, and some crushed red pepper.  Sometimes adding either or both ham (instead of bacon) and mushrooms.  It makes it more of a complete meal.  I never add vinegar or sugar.  Pile it all in the pan and add about a cup of water put the cover on and let it simmer down till all the water is gone and the potatoes are done.  I like it all mashed up together in my bowl with butter!!!!

This turned out so delish! I did make changes though because I was trying to make something that reminds me of a dish my parents made when I was growing up. I threw the raw bacon in with all the ingredients from the get go, I used balsamic vinegar and probably tripled it (kept adding to taste as the cabbage softened. I used 5 pieces of bacon and a full head of cabbage. I cooked on a lower heat and it took probably about 45 minutes to an hour. This was soooo good - I will be making this again and again!

Excellent!!!!!

Ths recipe is sooooo good! My wife and I made this. We didn't have cider so we used sushi rice vinegar instead. We also used four pieces of bacon as opposed to three. Turned out HUGE!! This is a keeper and goes great with french onion mashed potatoes and pork tenderloin.

Thanks!!!

I can't tell you how pleased I was with this dish!  I The flavor was outstanding.  The presentation was great.  There is nothing negative, at all, to say about this recipe.  I added about 3 pinches of sugar.  It was a little sweet.  I think I'll go with 2 pinches next time.  I think my salt and pepper to taste needed a little tweeking.  I'll add slightly more of each next time.  Thanks for a fabulous recipe!

This is a wonderful and easy recipe. This is only the second time I made cabbage. The first time I made it was horrible. This is like the traditional southern cabbage we have here. I followed the recipe with a few exceptions. #1. I used three large cloves of garlic, #2 I used more onions (because I love onions and garlic, #3. I used it in an iron cast dutch oven and did not need ANY water, #4. The best tip you can get about bacon grease...use it to sautee your stuff but then use a little more at the very end to add the flavor in since the onions and garlic absorb a lot of the bacon grease flavor, and I also crumbled the bacon on top of the cabbage instead of mixing it in the cabbage. It was wonderful. Thank you!

Another recipe I found here I haven't made in years.  I scaled to 3 servings and left out the sugar and vinegar.  While cooking I cover my cabbage to get it to wilt faster.  Topped with crumbled turkey bacon.

Fantastic dish!  Mild flavor and easy to make.  We like boiled ham and cabbage, but don't often have the time to fix it.  I made this cabbage and heated up a fully cooked ham, served with a side of parsley potatoes, and we had ham and cabbage in a fraction of the time.  Next time I make this, I will double the water and vinegar to keep it from burning.  This one's definitely a keeper.

This is pretty much how I remember my grandmother making her fried cabbage. The cabbage came from her garden, and she would use a half a pound of real thick sliced bacon because she was feeding a lot of people usually. She would cut the bacon into "lardons", and when it was cooked crisp, take it out and put it aside and then cook the cabbage, salt, pepper and only a teaspoon of sugar until the cabbage was carmelized in areas and soft and fragrant. She would put it all in a serving bowl, add the bacon back in, mix it with a serving spoon, and put the vinegar cruet right next to it on the table. Amazing! She has been gone many years, but every time I see this recipe I think of her.

I used Vidalia onions, lots of them, used cubed ham with the half the bacon... and skipped the vinegar, and it was absolutely delicious.

Needed to use up a half head of cabbage and this was a big hit with my wife.  I used red wine vinegar rather than cider; added some thinly sliced apples near end of saute; and used butter instead of bacon.  We will do this one again.

Delish!  I only had about a small half cabbage leftover so sliced that thin, 1 sm onion diced, and used about 1/2 Easter Polish sausage from Paulina Meat Market chopped.  Over Med ht 2 tblsp bacon fat sizzled and added onion until soft then added sausage to brown up a bit.  Added cabbage.  Made a slurry of water, salt and pepper and stirred that in.  after covered simmering for 15-20 min, heaven!  served this with brown rice and hubby loved it.

This is a very excellent recipe!  However after tasting it as written it lacked something. A sprinkle of garlic powder made it perfect. Thanks for this recipe. I love it!

This was good!  I'd never made fried cabbage before, so I had no expectations.  It's amazing how the huge pile of cabbage wilts down and becomes a dinner-for-4 sized amount.  I was sure my pan was too small, but not after a few minutes of cooking!  I will make this again.

Really terrific!  Nutritionists tell us we're supposed to eat at least 3 servings of cruciferous vegetables a week [broccoli, brussels sprouts, cabbage] ... and, this one is very simple and downright delicious.  I served it with bratwurst -- it was a HIT! For leftovers, mix the cabbage with leftover mashed potatoes, reheat and serve with corned beef!  AMAZING!

This recipe is excellent. I followed the directions, then added cubed smoked polish sausage to the cabbage. This was then a one-pan meal. Quick, easy and delicious.

One of my fave dishes - only I use a high quality extra-virgin olive oil instead of bacon... awesome flavor! Cover tightly, cooking over low heat in a heavy pan and you won't need the 2 TBSP water... This dish is best served with southern-style cornbread (buttermilk, no sugar). Yum!

I didn't use bacon, used garlic instead of the onion (lack of onion), and instead of cider vinegar, I used a little of balsamic. Lots of butter turned it pretty unhealthy, but rather yummy!

This was exactly what I was looking for when I wanted Fried Cabbage w/the corned beef I made. It was even better the next day, the flavors melded and I added some sliced pastrami that I had on hand. Amazingly good lunch, I re-heated it in a skillet after getting a bit of crip to the pastrami, delish. Now I am wanting to make it this week!

I FINALLY LIKE CABBAGE! I made this for St. Patricks Day, and usually skip cabbage because I can't stand the taste or the smell, but I had two bowls of this! Even my kids had seconds. I followed the directions exactly, I think it's the bacon that adds extra flavor and makes it so good. (My hubby says everything tastes better with bacon!) Try this recipe!

Excellent flavor! The vinegar at the end is what makes it. For a more heart healthy recipe, try boiling the cabbage with some lean sausage and then frying with cooking spray instead of frying in bacon fat.I added some calorie reduced margerine right at the end to complete it. Tasted great!

I was amazed and how simple and tasty this was.  And even healthy!  I doubled the bacon but used none of the grease, only what clung to the sides of the skillet.  It was yummy.  I eat this as a main dish sometimes.

Jen!

     This recipe is absolutely wonderful!  My 12 year old son, who doesn't like cabbage, enjoyed it so much, that he went back for more!  I chopped up a half of a cabbage instead of using cabbage wedges and I didn't add the cider vinegar.  I have already e-mailed this recipe to family and friends!  Thanks Jen for a wonderful recipe and I will highly recommend this for everyone!

I had to add more vinegar because there wasn't much flavor. I also cooked about half a pound of bacon for more depth. I'd make it again and add some beer to the recipe.

This is a super easy recipe that tastes great! I had a head of cabbage that needing using and decided to give this recipe a try. I made a few changes. I used a pound of italian sausage instead of the bacon because while bacon is delicious it is a greasy mess to make. I didn't need to worry about removing the sausage before adding the cabbage which made the recipe easier. I don't like to measure much so I just used the whole head of cabbage. And I definitely used more cider vinegar. I would just adjust to taste. Everything else stayed the same. The kids. dad, and I all loved it!

This fried cabbage is very tasty.  Even my fiance who states he doesn't like cabbage said it was good.  But who wouldn't love something simmered in bacon grease?  I used a small cabbage head from my garden.  The recipe doesn't state you should cover the pan or stir the cabbage while it simmers, but I feel it should be covered to achieve the desired tenderness.

Awesome!  I made it vegetarian with butter (3T, but I'll use 2T next time).  I also sauteed 3 cloves of minced garlic with the onion.  I also used balsamic instead of cider.

My two favorite words: cabbage and bacon. This is really good. I cook Irish a lot and this is the perfect side or accompaniment to a breakfast. I think the next time I make this, I'll use a touch less vinegar and drain just a tiny bit of the grease. And then, I plan to put a fried egg over medium on top of my serving. Is tomorrow too soon for that? Probably not.

Love this! Such a simple and delicious recipe. Sometimes I add 1/2 bag of shredded carrots to give it a little extra flavor and color.

Really good cabbage recipe!! I misread the directions, well, more like didn't read the directions and after cooking the bacon, used a tab of butter to deglaze the pan and then continued to follow the recipe as written. Turned really yummy.

We love cabbage with bacon. I use pre-cooked bacon to lessen the clean up and saturated fat. I Cook it in the microwave, I use 1 slice of bacon to each cup of cabbage.I never add sugar I add grated Apple instead, a sweet apple with or without the skin.To make this go faster I cook the chopped onion (I use a whole onion)in the microwave in a little oil, about Five minutes till it is translucent then transfer it to my wok pan. I wilt the cabbage in the microwave it becomes a nice bright green. Then add apple and cabbage to wok pan. When cabbage is tender to your liking sprinkle with Cider vinegar and crumbled bacon. This is always a hit.

This was good.  It just didn't blow me away.  I always just cut my cabbage in wedges-leaving the core in to keep it in one piece and fry the wedges in butter with a little salt and pepper.  I like the wedge to get browned on each side. So quick and easy.

I enjoyed this very much.  It's very similar to a wilted lettuce salad.  The only change I made was to use a packet of artificial sweetener instead of the sugar.

I'm usually not a cabbage fan.  For New Year's I wanted to have the traditional meal with cabbage, so I thought I'd try this one.  We loved it and I have made it since then.  I have told several of my friends about this one.  It's also great for anyone looking for low-carb dishes.

My husband and I loved this.   I used white vinegar, and a teaspoon instead of a tablespoon.  The 3 slices of bacon I had were thick sliced.   Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly as written, and it was delicious.

Did not make any changes.  It was a welcome change from the ordinary.  It is slightly crunchy, which my family likes very much; we do not like mushy cabbage.  The sweet and sour is good too; and, of course everything is better with bacon for the bacon lover in you!!! I have made more than once and will make again, soon as a matter of fact.

This was very good. I've never had fried cabbage before but thanks to this recipe, I will eat it again and again. I used pancetta cubes instead of regular bacon. The vinegar gives it a very welcome kick. Thank you Jen for sharing this recipe. Day 2:  This recipe will not only surprise you as the description states, but it will creep up on you and have you walking through the rain and hail (literally) to go buy more cabbage! Just delicious!

I have something very similar to this recipe in a Mennonite cookbook which is currently in storage so I was looking for it online.  We love it on hot dogs with some horseradish mustard and habanero cheese.  Slicing the cabbage on a mandoline makes it go so much faster.

Boo.  I had hopes since I love green beans fried in bacon grease and black eyed peas fried in bacon grease and even ocra fried in bacon grease.  I am NOT opposed to the bacon or the grease.  But for me, this fried cabbage was just plain ol' mediocre.  I love cabbage almost every other way.  My husband on the other hand, has never liked any other cabbage dish I have made and had three helpings of this one.  He really liked it.  Huh.  Go figure.

I made this tonight and I made two "batches". A half a head of cabbage and a half of a yellow onion plus salt, pepper water and sugar. A whole head of cabbage wouldn't fit in my skillet. On the first batch, my husband said he wanted some dijon mustard and that's when I realized I had forgotten the apple cider vinegar. The next batch I added the vinegar. Both were good.

Very good! I used white vinegar instead of cider vinegar and added a little more than it asked for and cooked for about 15-20 min. longer. The flavor really went all through it better. I also covered it while cooking and the cabbage was a bit more tender. So far this is my favorite cabbage recipe.

Delicious!  Just like my Aunt's and exactly what I wanted.  The only thing I did differently was use 5 slices of bacon and I left all the drippings in the pan.  Used the apple cider vinegar at the end to deglaze.  Oh, and I cooked mine longer until it had some nice color and that yummy caramelization. Thanks!

I made this last night...and it was so awesomely simple to make and the flavor was...omg....I couldn't stop eating it!!   Made this years ago, but never thought to splash it with the vinegar....Thank you so much for a GREAT recipe!!!  I did do 2 things different...used chicken broth instead of water and used purple onion for added sweetness.

very good, although it took a lot longer to cook the cabbage down to the texture I wanted.  I also used a whole pound of bacon.  My husband and I really enjoyed the leftovers too!

This has been a family favorite since I was a little girl! Love this recipe! It is definitely a "fly by the seat of your pants" recipe...throw in more 
bacon, a little more onion...it's up to you! I even make a version where I use sliced keilbasa and add cooked egg noodles at the end to make a meal of it. 
To the reviewer that used bagged shredded cabbage - I don't recommend using it, and that is probably why you didn't enjoy the recipe. I've tried that in the past, and the shred is too fine. You need  larger pieces of cabbage - the finely shredded cabbage in the bag wilts way too much.

We are on a sodium restriction diet, we limit to around 800-1100 mg per day.  I used 45% lowered sodium bacon.  Darlin'Husband enjoyed the dish.  He did ask to add more vinegar at table--we regularly use vinegar to sub for salt.  It occured to me that I could use this recipe as a starter to sub for sauerkraut in Braised Sauerkraut Alsacian (Julia Child origen), a favorite winter dish that's been off our menu r/t sodium issues.  Thank you for having this recipe appear in an Easter menu email.

I have used this recipe with sour cream added; put in at the end of cooking.  The creamyness is great.  I too used more bacon and more onion and left out the vinegar and sugar just to see.  It was just as good.

Awesome! I had never had/made fried cabbage before. I did use a whole 12 oz package of bacon to cook to my husbands liking and more onion. We loved it. It made so much, we will be able to eat it all week. Next time, I think I am going to try it with a little red chili pepper.

Disappointed in this one.  Then again, maybe I'm just not a fried cabbage fan.  My biggest issue with this recipe is the way it's written.  First of all the ingredients call for 6 cups of cabbage and then instructs you to cut it into wedges.  How much is 6 cups?  A weight measurement would have been more helpful.  Another problem I found is the recipe never indicates that you cover your skillet while cooking for 15 minutes.  In that amount of time, at medium high heat, the 2 T. of water would have been long gone!  Poorly written and far too vague.  It's no wonder my outcome was poor.

Oh YUM!  If I could give it more stars I would.  My husband devoured this dish.  I did use 5 slices of applewood thick bacon and one (16 ounce) bag of Old Fashion Shredded Cole Slaw mix.  Oh my - everyone I have had try this dish wants the recipe.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful side dish.

Yummy! My husband said it reminds him of  the fried cabbage his grandma use to make. Usually I make a spicy fried cabbage with red pepper flakes and butter but this version is equally as good. I took advise from some of the other readers and added a little bit of garlic powder and substituted balsamic vinegar instead of cider vinegar and it turned out wonderfully.

My husband told me he did not like cabbage when we got married so I've never cooked it, until last night at our Saint Patrick's Day dinner party. It was absolutely delicious, and I added a little extra bacon. Any kind of vinegar will work; I used tarragon vinegar myself. Everyone at my dinner party raved about the cabbage and they all (including my husband) asked for seconds!

The older I become, the more I realize that a simple recipe made with great ingredients can be absolutely FANTASTIC.  This recipe is OUTSTANDING.  This may sound truly strange, but I'm going to make eggrolls with this cabbage recipe!

This was a good, quick, and easy cabbage recipe, but it didn't have a ton of flavor. I think it just needs a little more of everything (bacon, sugar, and vinegar) because the flavor the cabbage did have was good, it just wasn't strong enough! Thanks for a good recipe; I will probably give it another try!

Very easy & delicious.  I've used balsamic vinegar in it instead with good results.

My Bavarian Mother used to make this all the time when I was growing up. I didn't care much for it when I was younger, but grew fond of it later as my taste buds matured.  I made it exactly according to the recipe the first time, and it was exquisite.  I tend to be an experimental cook, and can't leave well enough alone, so I altered it a bit since then....  I toasted 2 cups of pecans (with butter in baking pan @ 350 for 7-10 mins), let cool, then chopped.  After removing the bacon, I added 2 cups of peeled & deveined fresh meduim shrimp to the bacon grease, cooked until pink. Removed them, and set them aside with the bacon. After step 2, I stirred in the shrimp and toasted pecans pieces to the final mix. It comes out excellent every time.

This is very similar to my Belgian grandmother's jut recipe.  She, however, adds nutmeg and a pinch of that makes all the difference.  I, too, add garlic but this recipe is awesome.  My 7 year old begs for it.

This is a great, inexpensive dish that can be thrown together in flash.  And, it tastes great!  I used center cut bacon to cut down on the fat.  My kids won't eat it, but I like to make it for my husband and me.  Leftovers make a tasty lunch the next day.

My husband of twelve years has always made it a point to let me know that he HATES cabbage, so I would never cook it.  Well, I like it, so I finally decided to make it and he could eat it or not.  Not only did he eat what I put on his plate HE WENT BACK FOR SECONDS.  He's now decided that he DOES like cabbage. Just a note, I too was a little afraid of the vinegar so I just splashed it with half, tasted it, added the rest, and it DID make a difference in the flavor.  It was really good. Thanks for this recipe.

I chose to use brown sugar in this recipe  Along with the bacon and vinegar, the taste reminded me a bit of German Potato Salad.  Very good, sweet and savory at the same time.

I loved this stuff! I used turkey bacon and since there wasn't much grease to cook the onions/cabbage in I added in some chicken stock to keep the food from sticking. This was sooo good. I forgot to add the sugar and used balsamic because I prefer that taste. I am making it again NEXT week!

Someone had given me a couple of heads of cabbage and I had no idea what to do with them. This recipe is awesome. I'm looking forward to making it again. The only changes that I made was to add more bacon. Yum!

I made this recipe this evenng.  We had a pound bag of coleslaw from the grocers (w/o the dressing). I used balsalmic vinegar, made the dish a rather dark color.  I used about two Tbs. of b. vinegar, several pinches of sugar and three thick slices of bacon.  Removed the bacon and some grease and then topped it with the latter at the end.  
This recipe was good and I will make it again.  The three of us ate it all.  However, I don't think it's "the best".  I think cabbage is sort of hard to make "delicious".
I would recommend more vinegar for a sweet and sour taste.  Bacon didn't add that much to the dish. It vaguley reminded me of German potato salad.

I took the advice of caroleleah and covered/cooked for 20 mins after the cabbage was sauteed.  We loved this recipe!  Reminds me of the recipe from this site that made me fall in love with Brussel Sprouts:

This cabbage was outstanding!  I added more sugar & vinegar to give it more kick, but left everything else the same.  I think I would drain off a little of the grease next time, as it was a little too "juicy".  Everyone in my family raved about it!  Thanks!

This recipe was delicious.  I used about two tablespoons of bacon drippings (saved from previous fryings) and one tablespoon of butter and omitted the bacon altogether and it was still terrific.  Great with baked or breaded porkchops.

Everyone absolutely LOVED this Jen! Hubby is crazy about cabbage and of course bacon. Tasted something similar to what my Austrian grandmother used to make. My only addition was about a teaspoon of caraway seeds. Wonderful!

I have 4 boys aged 3 to 12 and although the younger ones were skeptical, the older two had second helpings!  We didn't add the vinegar, but I planned on adding it to mine and my husbands portions and forgot.

This is a tasty dish. I added a little garlic and let the cabbage brown nicely. I think any type of vinegar you prefer is nice to splash on at the end. I think it is a great weekday veggie and a little more bacon can't hurt either, just don't put too much grease in so it becomes too greasy.

This was the best cabbage I have ever made and so simple!
I do cook a lot of foods with bacon drippings, but it never dawned on me to fry cabbage. And as everybody knows ....everything is better with bacon!
After making this it has become a weekly staple in our home.
Thank you for a delicious, nutritious dish.

We loved it, and have made it twice in a week, following the recipe closely.  Perhaps used more cabbage and definitely more bacon.  A very forgiving recipe.  Used balsamic vinegar as suggested by other reviewers.  A keeper recipe for sure!

I used chopped sausage instead of bacon--it's easier and not as messy.  I also added caraway seeds to give it extra flavor.

I really don't like cabbage unless it coleslaw, however; my wife grew up on it.  So I tried this recipe and really like it.  I added nutmeg and allspice.

this is very similar to  an old family recipe we have.. omitting bacon. Never thought to add it to the fried cabbage but it was delicious!! will be a NEW family recipe now!! I added onion and garlic to the bacon when frying, and covered the pan, steamed it on low heat,, tender, tasty and never lasts more than 1 day! but , as stated, DO NOT omit the vinegar! you can adjust it for taste, but it really adds the tang to the dish. I have had so many compliments from ppl who claim they never liked cabbage or sour kraut, but gobble tis up!

Delicious as the recipe is written. I did increase the bacon to three slices. I didn't have cider vinegar so I used balsamic vinegar. I have also made this with kielbasa sausage which is awesome.

This dish was fantastic. I used 5 slices of bacon, omitted the water and used balsamic vinegar instead of the cider vinegar. I could have probably eaten the whole pan full, but I stopped when I was full. Thanks for sharing.

We love cabbage, but this is the best cabbage ever!!!  The only thing I did different was I used more bacon then called for. It also helped that we have home raised home cured bacon. Delicious!!!!
Thank you to the person who shared this gem, I will be using it again and again

I thought this was okay. My only change was using 1/2 head of cabbage I steamed in the microwave the day before half way. I also used pre-cooked bacon. I use it in recipes all the time calling for bacon with no issues. I ended up still having to cook the cabbage the full 15 minutes. It didn't seem like the cabbage had a lot of flavor. The bacon and onion flavor were very faint. To top, my cabbage imparted a bitter flavor and turned too brown in spots. I would have been happy to just to have eaten it steamed with butter and salt. I have tried similar recipes on the site for St. Patrick's Day. They turned out well. I will have to see what the difference in those recipes are.

The first time I made this I made it exactly as written. It was a delicious side dish with my pork tenderloin. Another night I made this as a side dish but added freshly minced garlic with the onion. Even more delicious. My family loves this simple dish. So much so I turned it into a meal one night. I made it with the garlic added to the onion again.  When the recipe was complete, I added thinly sliced sautéed chicken and some thin noodles to the cabbage. Filling delicious meal! Thank you, Jen!

I made this yesterday for a get together with a bunch of guys drinking beer & BBQing stuff.  I made it at my house, put it into a large Pyrex casserole dish for transport.  My sampling at home told me it would be well received (otherwise I would have left it at home and went over empty handed).  What I didnt' expect....is that warming it up in the oven once at my destination....made it BETTER!!  It got crispy around the edges and the bacon got crispy again as well.

The guys loved it and next time, I'm going to put it into the oven to get it all really crispy.  I think that's the little kick it needed to make it 5 stars.

Thanks Jen for the recipe.  It was really good & I look forward to playing with this recipe.  Also next time I'm going to use 1/2 head of green cabbage & 1/2 of red for a visual change.

I'll report back.

Tried this recipe with a few modifications since I'm trying to watch my weight.  I sauteed turkey bacon in about 1 Tbs of Canola oil, and used artificial sweetener.  It was absolutely delicious!  Even my "non-vegetable eating" husband loved it.  The vinegar adds a special flavor.  I'll definitely make this again, and again, and again.  Thank you for sharing!

Easy and tasty.  One of the best ways to enjoy cabbage.  Did not measure anything, just used a head of cabbage, probably a little more than 1/4 cup onion, no water, sugar or vinegar.

YUM!!!  This was so good, we had it as the main course!  I used a whole pound of bacon, just over half a head of cabbage, and added some garlic powder.  WOW!!  I will definitely be making this again!  I almost didn't add the sugar, but I'm glad I did!  The vinegar was a very nice touch to lighten it up a bit too!

I loved this, I ate almost the whole thing. I used a whole asian cabbage because that's what I had. I didn't add water because the cabbage was still damp after washing. I didn't add sugar because I just don't like to use it. I used all natural bacon. It's something that I will be eating more often. Thank you!

We loved this.  I used very lean bacon, and ended up throwing in a dab of butter too.   I had no cider vinegar, so we skipped the vinegar, but I cannot wait to try it with vinegar.  I knew the white vinegar would not be the same.  I added a pinch of Stevia instead of sugar since we are on a low carb diet. My husband and I both agreed, best cabbage we have ever had.

My husband and I love to make this recipe!  I usually leave the vinegar off, because my hubby prefers without, and I prefer with a little extra.  It's so good...definitely a staple side dish in our household!

I've been to many church functions and had a sampling of fried cabbage - so this was my first try at it .. and it turned out PERFECT (as written) ..  My 'cook it down' time was a bit longer - but I used 3/4 head of cabbage.  Excellent flavor and texture.

this was REALLY good. like, crazy good. it's not for everybody, because it has what most would probably consider to be a weird flavor, but i thought it was awesome. i got rid of the onions and added noodles, and used balsamic instead of cider. totes gonna make this again.

A pretty good recipe...the sugar and apple cider vinegar balance very well. I also omitted the bacon for health reasons, plus I had bacon this morning :)  I'll try it with bacon next time as I'm sure it's delicious!

Wonderful Jen, thank you so much! I made this exactly as written and was simply amazed at how good this really is. Lately I have been cooking and eating more fresh vegetables and this is a keeper for sure! So much better than plain old cooked cabbage with a little butter on it. I do try to go easy on the bacon fat though. Yum!

Delicious recipe! I omitted the onion and followed the rest of the recipe. Will definitely make again in the future and will likely add a little more of the cider vinegar to add a little more zing.

I did not use bacon or sugar because of my diet, and used balsamic instead of cider vinegar, and this was still very good. It was a bit bland but I added salt and it was great! I will try some bacon bits for flavor in the future.

I didn't make this exactly as written so it's hard for me to rate it accurately, but it was a great basic recipe for me to add to.  I used much more bacon, and added fresh mushrooms.  It was really very good.  I followed some reviews, and let it cook until it got really brown.  I had a little too much bacon grease so next time I will drain some of that off before adding the cabbage.  It was a good hot salad to eat with our sandwiches.

This was excellent! I cooked everything a little longer than it suggests because the cabbage wasn't fully wilted at 15 minutes. I probably let it go for about 20-25 minutes. Also, my sister hates vinegar, so I added the vinegar about 5 minutes before taking it off the heat so that some of the taste cooked out. It still had a nice fresh bite without her being able to identify it as vinegar. :-) We all loved it!

Wow, I have found my low carb side dish for everything I eat!!! This was so delish.  Will try with Splenda, but guessing it may not carmelize like it did with the sugar. Truly a recipe to try. Wow, this was so good!

A new favorite at my family's dinner table, this recipe proves that bacon does make everything better. Don't change a thing -- it's perfect as is.

This is excellent - the bacon gives it a nice flavor. I added some small dumplings - reminds me of a dish my grandmother always made.

This recipe is simple and tastes great--even my husband looks forward to it and he is not a fan of cabbage! Followed the recipe exactly as written.  Hint:  I cut the rest of the bacon slices into appropriate sized chunks and freeze them separately.  I don't tend to keep bacon on hand--this way I always have it around for this recipe!  I don't even thaw it, just throw it in the pan frozen.

This is wonderful. I made it at home and it was a hit. I took it to a pot luck and it vanished quickly. I have given this recipe to several others since finding it. Hint: don't be stingy with the bacon. I used a pound of chopped bacon to 1 large head of cabbage and used balsamic vinegar, (personal preference). Super

I have to say my husband loved this. It was a pregnancy craving for me so I didn't think he would even touch it.  The reasons for only 4 stars.  The vinager did absolutely nothing for me and I love vinager.  Next time I make it I'm going to have more onions, and maybe add a little fresh garlic or garlic chives.  Without the vinager it tastes like spring rolls.

Excellent. I grew up on ham and cabbage in Ireland, but my family's not so into the traditional boiled ham and cabbage, so for a change I got a spiral baked ham, made mashed potatoes and did the cabbage. I sauteed cabbage, onions and bacon together. New twist on ham and cabbbage and everyone loved it.

Very easy! I skipped the bacon and sauteed the onion in olive oil and garlic. Smart Balance light butter works too. I used plenty of salt and pepper and it came out quite tasty. I kept the lid on to speed wilting, and salted a few times more to get the flavor I wanted, and this is now my new way to make cabbage. Thanks for the recipe!

Covering the cabbage definitely helps. 6 cups (about half of a cabbage) made enough for me to LIGHTLY fill 3 pita breads. Flavor was great. I used turkey bacon so I had to add oil to create "dripings". Will make again.

Excellent recipe!  I didn't have bacon (just the crumbled kind), so I just fried the onions in some butter and then added the crumbled bacon at the end.  I am sure that using the bacon drippings for frying the onion would make it taste even better!  Thanks for the great recipe!

AW man was this good! I only glanced at the recipe for a sec then made it so I forgot the water. Dont think it made much difference w/out it. I put in Rice Vinegar since thats what I had and the flavor of thats a little sweeter. MMM this was yummy! At the end I put in a little chopped cilantro just for fun. I think it added an extra layer of flavor. Thanks for the idea, I didnt know what to do with my cabbage! :)

This is so much like the fried cabbage I grew up eating. My grandmother was from Germany and this was a staple. To make it go further, my mother added cooked sea shell pasta, which all the kids loved.

I GREW UP WITH THIS DISH. SO I KNEW WHEN I SAW IT IN THE RECIPES IT WAS AWESOME. I HADN'T COOKED THE FRIED CABBAGE IN A LONG TIME. SO I TRIED IT AND IT WAS STILL AS GOOD AS IT WAS AS A CHILD.IT GOES WELL WITH FRIED CHICKEN, MACARONI & CHEESE, AND HOT WATER CORNBREAD.

Very good recipe. I usually boil my cabbage but only because I never had a good fried cabbage recipe. This is my new way to cook cabbage on New Years. Thanks!

Very nice side dish.  I added a little more sugar than called for.  I also used bacon bits because I was out of regular bacon and it worked well.  My family really liked it.  I will probably make it again.

For somebody that hates cabbage except in eggrolls and cole slaw, this recipe was amazing, I am only giving it 4 stars because it definately needs an increase in bacon, I actually used I think 6 slices of bacon because its what I had left in a package I was finishing up so I just used all of it. My husband who is not a big veggie eater, let alone cabbage gobbled this up and my mom said to make sure I keep the recipe. This is really great!! Thanks!

This was a great recipie, the kids didn't want it for dinner because it had cabbage in it, but when they tried it they actually wanted more.I only gave it for stars because my family and I agreed it needed alot more bacon ...

This recipe was AWESOME.  Like one of the other reviewers, I also used to leave the room when my mom made cabbage.  I ended up with a head of cabbage from a neighbor's garden, and this recipe was the perfect solution to using the whole head.  I did a rough-chop of the lettuce for more texture. Also I only had ricewine vinigar, but the end result was fantastic!  I will definately make this again.

Yum! I used balsamic, as I didn't have any cider vinegar. I really enjoyed this, maybe next time I'll add more bacon.

This is the best stuff. When I cooked it, my son even came in and said, "Wow, that smells soooo good". He didn't even know it was cabbage. I give it 4.5 stars. A good ole southern dish for sure.

This is a keeper! Followed this recipe to the tee, minus the vinegar (I put it on my plate though). My mom said "see if you can give it six stars somehow". Every other time I've attempted to make Fried Cabbage it's been a flop. This was great! Thank you.

This was an easy way to make the classic. I omitted to vinegar, the smell was too pungent and overpowered the bacon and onion tastes. Fmily loved it.

Quick, easy, tasty, but a bit on the greasy side.  I'll definitely make again, but will try turkey bacon instead.  This is a great way to get in extra veggies in the diet.

I enjoyed this recipe so much!  I love cabbage, and right now it is very inexpensive, because of St. Patrick's Day, so I bought a lot of cabbage this week.  Wasn't sure what I was going to do with it all, so I got right on this site to look for ideas.  I didn't change a thing, except that it probably cooked a little longer than specified, while I was making the rest of my dinner, but my hubby and I loved it, and even my oldest son ate it!  And, despite the bacon, it wasn't greasy at all.  My younger son was less than thrilled, but he wouldn't even try it - his loss.  I made a whole head of cabbage-enough to fill a dutch oven size pan, and the little bit left over, was gone by the time I came home the next day.  Definitely one I will make again.  Thanks!

Love this, also like to make it without bacon and instead using a lot of margerine mixed with vegatable oil.  Also have made it with and without onions and like both.  I use more water too, about 1/4 of a cup.  The vinegar is what makes it so good to me!

My son is on a low carb (white bread, pasta, flour, etc) diet so I made this as a side dish for dinner. It was so awesome. I really didn't expect it because it seemed too easy and to plain, but I was wrong. It was DELICIOUS!

Overall, a good recipe though I did change a few things.  There was a little to much grease, but that could be dependant on the type of bacon.  I used more onion and I also added some Tony Cachere's seasoning for some kick and added flavor.

I can't imagine anyone not liking this.  I made the cabbage exactly like written and it was excellent! I had never heard of fried cabbage before but found that it's better than boiled. It's easy to make and tasted great!

This is a quick and delicious way to utilize cabbage and to have a fresh vegie in the winter.
I think that a little soy sauce would be good in this dish also

I have made a variation of this.  To add a new flavor twist I sprinkle to taste with "Schillings Chinese Five Spice", which is a combination of anise, cinnamon, star anise, cloves and ginger.

This was pretty good.  I had to add a little more sugar.  I also cooked the vinegar with the cabbage instead of adding it at the end.

We love this recipe.  I make it almost exactly as written.  I do add a bit more onion and sometimes throw in a few cut up grape tomatoes for some color near the end of the cook time.

Made it with 8 pcs if thick-sliced bacon and one large sweet onion.  Those are the only changes I made.  My family’s new favorite! Hubby eats leftovers cold and says it’s delicious that way too. Made it for my sister and her husband while visiting. They said it was the best they’ve ever had, and Sissie will be making it often too. This recipe is a new family favorite!

This was a fast and fun recipe we had for dinner last night,  I chopped the Bok Choy through it in the woke,  added sausage,  onions and peppers.  Tossed in the corn and shrimp a little sesame seed oil and we were off to good eating. Thanks for the recipe,  it took 20 minutes.

This was excellent.   Especially on a low carb diet.  A real treat.   It will be one of my favorites.  Didn't change a thing. Who doesn't like anything made with bacon.

Reminds me of the Alabama. I made this but didn’t have any thawed bacon but used all the other ingredients. It was really yummy and the vinegar added a nice brightness. I’d make it again.l but add bacon next time.

This was exactly what I was looking for to go with handmade sausages and stuffed potatoes.  I followed exactly, and used 3 slices of bacon, which equaled 1/4 pound.

I followed the recipe exactly except that I used 5 pieces of bacon since that’s what fits in my skillet and come on now, there’s no such thing as too much bacon!  This was a complete hit, absolutely no leftovers!!  Definitely making this again!

I made this and it’s good as is. I made it again but didn’t add sugar and added salt instead. I drained off half the bacon grease and sautéed two chopped garlic cloves with the onions, this worked out very well

Ever since finding this recipe it's been a staple in our home. I like to mix things up every now and then so sometimes I add ekridge sausage, sliced. I add it after bacon then put in the onion. So many things you can do with this.

Yummy summertime side.  Try it with brats. Perfect for outdoor gatherings as it tastes great at any temperature and has no mayo so it will not spoil quickly.

I will NEVER boil cabbage again...OMG, this recipe is a total game changer. Typically we only eat cabbage around St. Patrick's Day, but now that I have this recipe and we eat it frequently. Be careful when adding your salt; I accidentally added too much one time. The bacon adds a lot of the salt, so you don't need to add much. Enjoy!

Turned out great. Only change I made was instead of salt, I added a teaspoon of powdered chicken bullion. The onions and cabbage caramelized a bit and it was delicious.

This recipe brought back memories of my Grandma's Sunday Dinners! I added just a little more sugar, and another splash of vinegar. Perfect! Thank You for a Wonderful Recipe!

I used a whole head of cabbage.  Now the recipe says 6 cups shredded.  It seemed I had too much cabbage for the amount of seasoning I used.  It needed more flavor.  Next time I would use 1/2 of a large head of cabbage .  Also the balsamic vinegar sprinkled on it after serving is very good.

So good! I want to love cabbage being that it's such a cheap vegetable but didn't know how to cook it. Used a whole cabbage, not sure how many cups it was and added a T of chicken bullion granules. YES!

This was just okay for me. I used a whole head of cabbage and a whole onion. I made minimal modifications otherwise, used 4 1/2 strips of bacon instead of 3.  A pinch of coconut sugar vs white sugar (Paleo) and used 3 tbsp. of water instead of 2. I did add about a 1/4 tsp of garlic powder since this just seemed to be a bland recipe. I wasn't wowed by this, but it is good enough for my meal prep side this week. Not sure I'll make it again, but if I do I'll have to add something else to it.

Delicious!  I used 6 slices of pre-cooked bacon which provided plenty of fat.  I also added some red pepper flakes when browning the bacon, added a chopped jalapeno pepper with the onion and increased the vinegar to kick up the flavor.  Finding good side dish recipes for cabbage is difficult, so I will definitely make again.

Delish!  I usually add a bit more sugar, salt, and pepper and another couple slices of bacon.  It often doesn't make it to the next day, but when it does, the leftovers are good too.

Used one small head of cabbage, half an onion.  Removed some of the bacon fat before adding the cabbage. Used vegetable broth instead of water because I happened to have some open.  Added more sugar because when I tasted it, it was pretty bland. Doubled the ACV to 2 T.  We liked this.

As good as this was, it is very greasy stuff, and I'm not sure it is worth all the calories.

Considering no one else complained about the grease, I am wondering if others don't mind a meal swimming in saturated fat or if I am the only one that is picky.  I will read through more of the comments to see what I find.

I found it to be quite bland but cabbage is not in season in alberta so that could be the reason.

I've made this many times, and it has vaulted cabbage to the upper end of my favorite vegetables list.  This is a wonderful recipe to start with, and so easily customizable for individual taste!   I've added halved grape tomatoes, and red or green peppers for flavor and color.  I've substituted chorizo for the bacon because it's what I had.  Hot Italian sausage works too.  I've added black beans for protein.  The possibilities are endless.  Thank you for sending me off on new cooking adventures:-)

I made this because I had some cabbage to use up. What a GREAT recipe! DEFINITELY do NOT omit the vinegar.  It is absolutely necessary for the flavor combination with the bacon. I also added some asparagus. This ended up being my entire meal, it was so good!

This is simple recipe , the taste is mixture of salty, sweet and  a little bit of wine.

Delicious!  I've never had fried cabbage, and I loved it. Will definitely be a staple.  I left out the onions, just used a dash of minced onion.  I think I ate half of it right out of the pan. Yum.
One thing, the cabbage cooked in 5 minutes flat.  I had my burner on med -low. 15 minutes would have been overkill.

So delicious!  I didn't change a thing, other than topping it all with the cooked crumbled bacon as garnish.  
Served it over noodles, along with Braised Corned Beef (another 5 Star recipe), Parsley Potatoes, and Corn Muffins.
I didn't think it could be better until we ate it again the next evening.
Cook This!  Your family and you will ask for it again and again!!

I did not make any changes. This recipe is very close to one I have used for years. I thought the recipe name "fried" was a little misleading - I would call it sautéed.

Like a lot of people, I don't like my cabbage too crunchy. This needs to be cooked a bit longer to ensure that the cabbage is tender, and not crunchy. The touch of vinegar works well, I used rice wine vinegar.

Love this recipe just added more bacon 6 slices and an apple chopped and white wine instead of water. I also used brown sugar instead of white. I could eat this by the barrel!

It was great! My husband and I have it a 5 but kids only a 3 but that's because it's a veggie so it never gets a 5! 2 things I did a little different was added red onion vs. white and added 2 chopped garlic cloves as we love some garlic in this family.

I used turkey bacon in order to make it more heart healthy.  Otherwise the same.  It was so very delicious.  My husband & I loved it.  Recommend it to anyone who loves vegetable and to those who want to eat more healthy.

Outstanding. Made it exactly as given minus the splash of vinegar as a side to corned beef and boiled potatoes. It's a different twist on the traditional corned beef and cabbage well worth a try. The next day I mixed all three items in a bowl and heated them in the microwave for a quick, tasty lunch.

I used thick-sliced peppered bacon, and received thumbs up around the table. We ate the leftovers tonight. The flavors had melded and they were delicious. Definitely a keeper!

I liked it, but my adult son would not touch it.  He is used to our German Kraut Burrocks, which use Cabbage, Onions, Ground Beef with a little Sausage, sautéed, and used as filling for dough pockets and baked.

We loved it.  I didn;t have bacon on hand, so used some fresh bacon crumbles and  bacon fat. that I had in the refrigerator.. Our son and wife were here for dinner.  Our daughter in law doesn't like cabbage, but I noticed that she had two servings. The vinegar is a must.  I had leftovers for lunch.  Yummy!

Would have drained some of the bacon grease. Tasted good, but way to greasy. Will make again with that slight change.

I thought this was good but next time I make it I'll remove some of the bacon drippings before adding the cabbage as it was just a little too greasy for me.  Thanks for the recipe.

This will be my new go-to cabbage recipe!  I used a sub-par brand of bacon, so that part was a little chewy, but this dish still turned out excellent.  My Irish grandma always doused her boiled cabbage in cider vinegar, so that seemed normal to me!  And I cannot bring myself to leave the cider vinegar out....it enhances the flavor so much.  A nice - and unexpected - side effect of frying vs. boiling...it had almost no impact on my stomach.  Often boiled cabbage can come back to haunt the household (if you get my drift!), but I had none of that.  I'm the only one in my home that will eat cabbage, so I had plenty for leftovers and it was just as good warmed up as fresh.  Thanks!

If I make it again, I would garlic, nice ham cut-up apples and give it some coriander, turmeric and allspice. give it a lot  of taste. I would eliminate the bacon for healthy meal.

I have made this for years minus bacon because I don't like bacon in other foods.
I make this with the thin sliced ( not lunchmeat) ham. I cook thin strips until crispy and add at the end to keep crispness. Everything else the same. I especially like this by itself with cornbread, but makes a great side also.

Love corned beef for St. Paddy's Day! But not the boiled cabbage, so I usually make what my American Irish mother called cabbage slaw (cole slaw to most folks). This time  I had both cole slaw AND fried cabbage II. My son took over where I'd left off, and I now have another go-to vegetable side dish.  All 4 of us loved the fried cabbage! The only things different from the recipe was I cut up 5 slices of bacon (and it sure didn't hurt!) and my son forgot the vinegar at the end but it was still great!  We'll try to remember the vinegar next time, which will be soon! Thank you!

Holy Cow! This was delicious!  My hubby had come home from lunch with the guys, raving about a restaurant's "fried cabbage". And all I could think of was, "yuck", because the only cabbage I liked was steamed.  However, when this recipe popped up on a feed, I thought I would give it a try. WOW - WOW - WOW! I followed the directions exactly (even though questioning the sugar and apple cider vinegar (in my mind) but it works! The recipe is superb and the cabbage doesn't smell up your house. I did cover the pan to aid in the wilting process as another had suggested.   This has sure changed my perception of what I thought fried cabbage would be like. It has now been added to the "YUM" section of my recipe box.

Excellent meal!  I used five strips of bacon because that's what I had left in the package but otherwise followed the recipe.  I tasted it prior to adding the apple cider vinegar and it was cabbage fried in bacon fat:  decent but, you know.  Don't omit the vinegar:  it's subtle but oh, so important and elevated this dish to a repeat performer.  Also, even if I use more bacon in future (because, Bacon!), I'd pour off a lot (okay, nearly all) of the grease before adding the onion because, while tasty, it keeps this dish from being diet-friendly.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

really enjoyed this ! Omitted the water. Used a whole head of cabbage , 1 large onion , maybe a bit more sugar and apple cider vinegar. Served it with sauteed pierogies . It will probably be even better tomorrow !

oh my...this was a huge hit on St. Patty's day. Very simple, only a few ingredients, and quick to make. Not sure if the bacon cancels out the healthy aspects of cabbage, but whatever. It was delish and will foresee this becoming a staple. Thanks for the recipe!

Made it exactly as the recipe, with one small exception.  I sliced an apple thinly and cooked that with the onion.  Didn't add any additional salt, because the bacon was salted enough.  Will definitely make this again.

Been making fried cabbage since I was a kid,  but no sugar, vinegar or any of the other stuff. Just fry the chopped up bacon until crispy, remove and drain on paper towel leaving bacon grease in skillet, add roughly chopped cabbage on medium high  heat , stirring occasionally until tender crisp, then add bacon back in stirring to mix. Salt and pepper to taste.  Two ingredients,  easy-peasy.

I've been making this for years. The one thing different is I add a little ground caraway seasoning. Sure beats boiling cabbage to death.

I had never heard of fried cabbage until last month when  coworker brought some for his lunch. I was apprehensive but he encouraged me to taste it. It was really good. When I got home I put cabbage on the grocery list and the rest is history. I've made it at least once a week since then. It's easy & delicious!

Will definitely make it again. I covered the pot with a lid, which helps to wilt the cabbage. I used a whole package of bacon snipped into small pieces. Hey, BACON IS GREAT! MORE THE MERRIER.

I had a bag of cole slaw mix that needed to be  used so I went with that. It had red cabbage in it, as well. I did skip the bacon. For extra flavor, I added a little garlic and onion powder. I wasn't sure about the cider vinegar, but I really liked it here and even added more. I had this with buffalo chicken sausages. I love sauteed cabbage, and I will make this one again! Thanks for the easy and delicious recipe!

My son ate the bacon before I put it in the dish, but I did use the bacon grease to cook this in. Really good even without the bacon and apple cider vinegar. Will try this again with them both.

It does not take as long to make as they note in the recipe, which makes it even nicer!  I used 4 strips of bacon made it a little too grease but I liked that amount of bacon. Next time I will remove a little of the bacon fat.

This turned out pretty good. I didn't measure the cabbage, just cooked up the whole head that I had, so I had to adjust the ingredients accordingly. I omitted the sugar since I'm on a low carb diet and had to double the vinegar as I couldn't taste a difference with just one tablespoon. I also used a whole pound of bacon and reserved 1/4 cup of the grease, half of which was used to cook the onion and the other half added when the cabbage went in. A very tasty dish, and a great way to use up cabbage. I certainly wouldn't call it mediocre, and probably not awesome, but good? Definitely, yes.

I had some shredded cabbage mix that needed to be used up so  I decided to give this recipe a try. So glad I did. The vinegar is just the right thing to take this over the top. I also had an orange pepper that I chopped up and threw in with the onion. Give this a try you won't be sorry.

Very good. Used pinch of brown sugar and extra onion and herbs.  Vinegar was just right.

I did something a bit different with this recipe that was very interesting.  I made one batch using the basic recipe minus the vinegar. Then I tried with different sour liquids. My favorite was a combination of lime juice and a natural apple cider vinegar,  50/50.  I then tested seasonings such as cayenne pepper, crushed red pepper, smoked paprika and some cumin. What a great recipe to make your own. Of course I will make it again. It would be like going to a Mongolian BBQ and the waitress asks you how your meal was. It had better have been good, you put it together. It would be your fault if it wasn't.

This was a surprising dish.  I was not sure of it but had everything on hand and wanted to try something different with cabbage.  I did alter it, I drizzled honey on it instead of using white sugar.  It's a Paleo thing.  But wow was this good, and so EASY to prepare.  And I think it may even be better the next day as a leftover.  It gives the flavors time to really come together.  WOW!  Thank you for this dish.  I see a lot more cabbage in my future!

Cabbage is one of the most underappreciated & underused veggies of all time.  If you are in a really big hurry & don't want to cut up the whole head of cabbage you can use packaged cole slaw.  Throw some cabbage in almost any soup too for some added flavor. Great recipe. Tx.

This is perfect.  The touch of vinegar at the end is the crowning glory.  Love cabbage and can reheat this to have rather than a "half a sandwich" when I'm famished, but it's not mealtime.  Do not feel the urge to add a little more sugar or vinegar.  The subtle difference lets the cabbage shine through.

Truly, a great and easy recipe - even the kids had seconds. Next time will use pre-cooked bacon and olive oil, but the real bacon drippings really make this good. Thanks!

We made this for 2 people and an entire head of cabbage was way too much!! All other ingredients are on per (we like a little extra bacon), but I definitely recommend only a half head of cabbage or doubling all other ingredients (at least!)
P.S. Not a "left overs" type side!

This is the way I fry cabbage with the exception that instead of cider vinegar I serve it with pepper vinegar (like in the South). If you like cabbage, give this a try. Don't omit the bacon, that's what makes it

I make this all the time and have for years.  I will add ketchup at the beginning of wilting the cabbage instead of the sugar,salt and vinegar. My family likes it that way the best. The ketchup adds a lot of flavor. I cover and let it wilt under low heat for a while. Turns out very tasty.

So, so good! This is always our go-to cabbage recipe. We use pepper vinegar instead of cider vinegar because we like the heat that it gives.

Really good cabbage.  Made this according to directions, though may have been less than six cups of cabbage as it was small and did not measure.  The vinegar was a great touch, added flavor with being intrusive.  Will definitely make again.

I cooked everything at medium high heat as suggested in the recipe but my cabbage burned even though I was stirring it about every 4-5 minutes and had a lid on the pan (after the first 5 minutes or so). I  think I will try again and make sure to cover the entire time and maybe cook at a high simmer instead.

This was really delicious. I added some cooked egg noodles, al dente, but I'm giving it 5 stars even with the modification because it would have been delicious either way. I just wanted some carbs in there. The vinegar is a great touch. I think if you enjoy spicy food you could probably add some heat to this and do well, but that's not my thing.

I had no bacon (who doesn't have that, right?) but used ghee (clarified butter) and smoked paprika instead. This ended up being quite the flavorful vegetarian dish. Before adding the cider vinegar I tasted the fried cabbage. Probably didn't need the vinegar, but I splashed some on anyway. Even better with the vinegar!

If you want to knock down the smell when cooking substitute chicken broth for the water and drop in some garlic. This is truly a good recipe so that's my only addition. CARLYON

I didn't have any bacon and needed to get rid of a head of cabbage in the fridge so I substituted the bacon for some strips of pork shoulder. I also added 2 jalapeños and some butter to sauté the onions and jalapeños in. Turned out awesome!

What a great way to jazz up cabbage.  I did use an entire package of bacon for this, with a silly amount of cabbage to pair with.
Only down fall was trying to find a frying pan accommodate that much cabbage until it cooked down. Cooked it in two batches.
Tasted delicious.  Will be cooking again.  Started saving the grease from bacon to use for this recipe.
Certainly not healthy, but very yummy once in a while.

This is a great side for almost any meal but goes especially well with baked chicken. The bacon and onion make a fairly boring side delicious. I make it just like the recipe says.

I would also recommend adding more bacon. I made this recipe according to exact directions and I have to say it wasn't quite as good as I have had, but I live in Deep South and they really know how to do vegetables, however they always add too much fat.  In this case it's better with more fat. I like the lightness and crispness of the cabbage. Beautiful color and glazed sheen on the cabbage.  I am always looking for simple dishes and this site is really the best. Love the ratings system and the chance to see how ppl have chosen to modify recipes.  As I just think about this I am wondering if drained water chestnuts or maybe slice almonds would add some zip to this dish.  Just a thought as the crunch is really good.

I didn't have bacon so I used butter and added toasted pine nuts at the end.  Very, very good!  Thanks.

Great!  The vinegar takes the bacon grease down a bit and gives it a good tang--husband and I both loved it.

I didn't add vinegar only because I forgot, but I'm sure it would be good because I usually add pepper vinegar to my cabbage. Made recipe as is otherwise but didn't measure anything. My 11 yr old son gobbled it up with some cornbread and macNcheese. Comfort food

This was really tasty!  I would perhaps add a little more vinegar and sugar next time for a little more sweet and sour flavor but I really did like it.  Did drain off most of the bacon grease before cooking the onion.  Just couldn't leave that much grease in the pan.  Will certainly make again!

Used smoked sausage, a can of diced tomotoes, salt, pepper, butter and EVOO instead. A bit healthier and tasty.

Added more vinegar (only had regular) and more salt. Very tasty alone or as a side! Next time will try cooking in Pam vs bacon drippings as they were a little greasy.

Okay I am a cabbage lover and I usually make it the conventional way but decided to try something different. I cooked a roll of jimmy deans spicy sausage and sautee'd two small onions adding a lil red pepper flakes. I added the cabbage to the mixture layering the garlic powder and pepper in between each batch. I cooked some uncle bens broccoli and augratin whole grain rice to mix with the cabbage and it turned out delishiouso. I omitted the salt, sugar and cider. This dish is a keeper.

I have been watching carbs so this recipe fit right in.  I was leery of the vinegar but decided to try just a splash of Balsamic Vinegar.  It was wonderful on the cabbage and turned mousy to marvelous.

This is a dish I will be making again and again.

I followed this pretty much with the exceptions of omitting the onions since I had none, doubled the bacon, adding hot pepper flakes and garlic to drippings, salt and sugar in the raw along with mothers apple cider vinegar. I think it is off the hook shut the front door good !

This is a quick, very tasty dish to serve along side of your favorite sausage. I added a bit more cider vinegar because we like it a bit tangy.

Only thing I changed was using some carrots (sliced thin from my mandolin) instead of the sugar. I threw them in with the onions then added the cabbage. 
My family makes a similar recipe except they use a whole pound of bacon, a large head of cabbage and a pound of egg noodles. Since I was making this for my 1 year old I couldn't justify all that bacon. Lol

Very good and easy.  What more could anyone want?  I will probably drain off some of the bacon drippings next time, but that's just a personal preference.  No one in my family likes cabbage but they sure liked this!

Jen, thanks for this terrific recipe.  I've been making fried cabbage for years using Kielbasa sausage or etc. with it.  NEVER occurred to me to mix it with bacon...oh my!  The splash of vinegar was new to me, too & I love the subtle flavor it adds to the dish.  My only change was frying the cabbage in a little oil & butter rather than the bacon drippings; oh & use LOTS of onions (our personal taste).  After making this a couple of times, my hubby & I agree we may never return to Cabbage & Kielbasa again!!

Really easy quick! My only change was using Rice Vinegar and boy was that just the thing to give this 5 stars. I still give it 5 for a great base that I would have never came up with.

This year I purchased a crop share through our local community farm.  And I have gotten a couple of heads of cabbage.  After exhausting the typical cabbage recipes, I tried this recipe to add something different to our dinner menu and it was definitely a winner! I had turkey bacon and pear vinegar on hand used them in place of regular bacon and apple cider vinegar. It was fantastic and definitely plan to make it again in the next few days.

I love the ease of preparation of this recipe. My family really loved the the flavor. Even my son (who hates cabbage) gave it 3 stars. The vinegar was the added extra touch to this easy, flavorful dish. 

As with ANY cabbage dish, DO NOT OVER COOK the cabbage, and DO NOT USE ALUMINUM PANS. 
Cabbage contains isothiocynates that break down into smelly sulfur compounds during cooking. The reaction is even stronger in aluminum pans. The longer the cabbage is cooked the more smelly the compounds become. The solution; a brief cooking time. Cook just until tender and use stainless steel pots and pans.

Simple flavors and easy to make.  Saved a dish by leaving the bacon in the pan and adding the onions before the bacon was finished.  I used a lot of pepper, it really adds to the flavour.  Didn't have cider vinegar, so I used a bit of rice vinegar and regular vinegar.

Good, but it didn't make a whole lot.   but I'm not sure if that wasn't me just cutting the cabbage too large.

I made this last week and it was really good. one of the best recipes I have found on here. I changed it up a bit by adding fish and jerk spice which gave it a spicy flavor.

This is one of my favorite breakfast/lunch dishes. I often fry a couple eggs and top the cabbage with eggs. It's great for those low carbers who can't have toast, but like something to soak up the yolk. :) I never put sugar or vinegar in mine... looking forward to trying it that way.

I left out the sugar and the onions (my husband hates onion) and it was STILL good. I was worried about it having enough flavor, so I put in about 4 minced garlic cloves before adding the cabbage, and it was wonderful.

This tastes almost like a dish I get at a favorite teriyaki place. Next time I'll serve it over white rice. I also added a little cayenne and a jalapeno to give it more heat.

Our family did not like this recipe when we made it exactly like it says.  We definitely did not like the vinegar in it.  For an alternate recipe, we got some tips from my mother-in-law & boiled our cabbage instead.  We fried about 6 slices of bacon in a skillet, crumbled it & added it plus a couple of spoonfuls of bacon grease to the boiled cabbage, and added salt & pepper to taste.  It was delicious prepared her way.

If you don't want tasteless boiled cabbage, try this recipe. Followed Step 1 and 1st line of step 2, however, instead of cooking cabbage with onions & bacon grease, I drizzled a generous spoon of drippings over chopped cabbage in separate large pot. Sauteed it for 10 minutes (be careful not to scorch). I then mixed in onions and added tsp of brn sugar, S&P, good splash of white balsamic vinegar & 1/4 tsp of liquid smoke. I transfered to a ovenproof ceramic dish, covered & set to the side. I was roasting a corned beef in a 325 oven so I prepared this recipe early afternoon to finish in oven during last 1/2 hour. I tossed with the pre-cooked bacon pieces + 1 more dash of vinegar immediately after removing from oven. Good recipe you can prepare in-advance this way. Turned out tender but with texture. Even better next day (lightly fried).

I actually removed most of the bacon grease, and did not add water.  It turned out great, even hubby really liked it.  I used red wine vinegar, I don't ever have cider vinegar (can't stand the smell). - I used leftover coleslaw.

Cut some calories and fat by omitting the bacon and sauteing the onions in 2 Tbs of olive oil.  Add 1/2 tsp of Liquid Smoke. This recipe came out delicious!

This is very good, but next time I would omit the sugar as the cabbage naturally sweetens when it is cooked.  Definitely will make again - a really nice change for a vegetable dish.

I make this with turkey bacon, and a little less onion than is called for.  I also love to splash the end result with tabasco.  That being said, I get cravings for this recipe, and LOVE it.

Really tasty!!  I only had red cabbage so it looked a little funny but was tasty.  Also wanted to use up a leek so I subbed it for the onion.  Added a bit of spinach for iron...quite tasty!!  I usually don't add salt to my dishes as I don't like much salt, but with this recipe you really need to salt it to balance the flavors...too sweet without it (then again my pinch of sugar may have been a bit large). All in all, very good recipe that is relatively healthy and tasty...great combo...my 7 year old and 18 month old liked it as well.

Awesome. Thanks for sharing. I was going to make cole slaw and instead made this. Family loved it. I didn't have the cider vinegar so I used tarragon vinegar. Tastes great.

Excellent. Very flavorful.  Balsamic vinegar is a good substitute if you don't have cider vinegar. Served with the Guiness corned beef on this site and for dessert the Irish bananas.  Great meal for St. Paddy's day!

I forgot to add the vinegar but this was a hit at my St. Paddy's day dinner. Decided to cook this instead of boiling the cabbage. Instead of water I added some chicken broth to the pot. YUM!

I really enjoyed this as a change from usual the boiled cabbage we have with our corned beef.  Hubby wasn't real sure.  I followed recipe as written, only subbing some corned beef cooking liquid for water.  Added a little more s/p to taste.  This actually reminded me of a crispy sauerkraut.

Very good.  I left out the onions and increased the bacon to 5 slices.  I was worried that the vinegar would be too strong, but it was just enough to give the dish a subtle tang.  I didn't think I liked cabbage until I tried this.

It was okay - I was a little disappointed but maybe I didn't do something right, maybe it needed more salt? I don't know...it just taasted like it was missing something, kind of bland. I would try it again but would probably throw in some garlic in the saute - something.

I made this just like the recipe called for and found it ok.  I ended up making it a second time and fried it in the bacon drippings, added salt and pepper.  I added sliced american cheese and covered for about 5 minutes.  IT WAS DELICIOUS!

It was edible but not spectacular.  If I made it again I'd probably use a little more vinegar.  Maybe I overestimated the amount of cabbage.  It's hard to measure 6 cups of wedged cabbage.

Made this for the bf--I don't like cabbage except in egg rolls.  He makes something like this sometimes, but uses water, bacon, noodles, and salt and pepper.  I added more bacon and put onion powder in instead of onions bc I knew he wouldn't like onions in it.  I also tossed in the cider vinegar with the water and the rest of the ingredients while cooking the cabbage, not after.  He asked me what was in it and seemed to like it but also seemed unsure about the cider vinegar.  He also salted and peppered a lot more, so apparently I didn't put enough salt and pepper in it.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was delicious, especially if you cook the cabbage until it is very soft.  I only had bacon bits (probably used too much) and added a couple tbsp of oil since there was no fat coming out when I fried it up.  I was hesitant about the vinegar, but it was a great, subtle tang.  I have a hard time believing that a serving was only 48 calories, especially with all the bacon grease! But if it is true, I will be serving this all the time for sure.

This was really good. I really think this is a meal in and of itself. It's not just another side dish. I used turkey bacon and balsamic vinegar. Next time I will add more onion for more contrast.

This recipe was a hit for my husband and me tonight.  I had half of a head of cabbage that I used earlier for the fish tacos and wanted to use it in something.  It was easy and quick.  I used White wine vinegar and it was awesome!!  I also added extra sugar.  Thanks, no more boring cabbage.

Bacon and vinegar make a good combination. Followed the recipe in terms of ingredients but I just eyeballed them without really measuring. I think it would be important to get the amount of vinegar right, don't want it to overpower everything else.

Super tasty!  My hubby and I gobbled it up.  I had to use balsamic vinegar b/c I did not have the cider vinegar.  I also added a couple slices of bacon b/c we love bacon.  Overall, great taste and easy to make!

This was absolutely delicious!  I used red wine vinegar as that was the closest I could get to cider...  and even though my husband didn't think I cooked the cabbage quite long enough, we both agreed that the flavor was amazing.

This fascinated me how well it turned out.  The whole time I was preparing it, it seemed like it wasn't going to be very good and I thought the bacon would be the best part about it, but I was WRONG!  This was a fabulous recipe and farely easy to make!  Next time I will try someones suggestion of garlic and onion as a sub for the bacon because I try not to eat alot of meat.  As is though, 5 stars!

I thought this was great. I made 1/2 recipe. 1 slice of bacon made barely any grease. I used a splash of chicken stock instead of the water.

Thought this was a good cabbage recipe. Followed the directions exactly, except maybe I cooked mine a little longer. After reading another review somewhere, I think I may use the leftovers to make spring rolls.

excellent! I did add extra bacon and probably 3 pinches sugar. I decided it needed a bit more sweetness about half way through cooking. Very yummy.

Had the cabbage, but no bacon, so I used andouille sausage. Guess it's still considered fried cabbage. Anyway it was very good & tasty., nice & spicy. I'll make it again, hopefully having all the correct ingredients next time.

Awesome stuff! It sounds like such an odd combination for a Northerner like me, but this is great. I normally add extra bacon though.. you can never add too much. =)

I have made this a couple of times already and just discovered this recipe a few weeks ago. I did make a couple of changes due to the fact that I am on the Core Plan through Weight Watchers. I used canadian bacon instead of regular,omitted the sugar, and used a little olive oil to soften up the cabbage. It was fantastic and it had all the right foods in it for my Core Plan. Thanks very much for this recipe!!!

per other reviews, i tripled the bacon and added a minced clove of garlic. also i simmered it much longer covering it with a lid.  thank you so much, my kids now actually love cabbage.  my 11yr went back for seconds, by-passing seconds of her other favorite side dish!

Very delicious! I cut larger pieces of the cabbage and cooked it for less time, about 10 minutes. The vinegar made a big difference too.

If I used one word to sum up this dish it would be YUM!  Even my picky "I don't like vegetables" husband like it and said it's a keeper.  I omitted the sugar and vinegar but added some cayenne pepper and garlic for a little kick.  It was even better the next day reheated.

This was nothing special.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't great.  Will probably look for another recipe next time.

I have never had cooked cabbage before and this was excellent.  I added garlic with the onion as some previous cooks suggested.  I also covered it during the simmering time.  It came out great!  Works great as a low-carb side dish.

This was excellent!  A much needed change from all of the boiled cabbage we have had from the garden.  The only thing I changed was that I used turkey bacon and I cooked it longer as was suggested in an earlier comment.  I will be making this again!

This was pretty good.  I added more bacon, just cause bacon is better with everything, and needed a bit more of a splash of vinegar.  Hubby enjoyed alot which was a good sign, and different kind of side dish.  Will be making again!!

This is excellent!!!!!! The only thing I didnt was add a few patts of butter for a little extra taste. Other than that it was a great side dish. I made this along with the "Chicken A La Good" recipe.

Very good. I added more water throughout cooking so that it wouldn't stick and burn and added extra pepper and some corriander(I need a lot of flavor and tasting it was just a tad bland with just salt and pepper).  The end product was delicious.  Thank you for the recipe!

If you like cabbage, this is a good recipe.  The bacon adds extra flavor as well as the cider vinegar.

I was trying to get rid of some cabbage, and found this great recipe. I had to cook it a little longer than 15 minutes, though. I pretty much followed the recipe, other than that. I wasn't bothered at all by the bacon grease like some others. My family rarely eats cabbage, and loved this. Thanks!

This recipe was awesome, we had a dinner party this weekend and it was a huge hit. We used Canadian bacon which was less greasy but very tasty.

I remember this dish from my childhood.  My 11 year old as well as hubby, really enjoyed.  Great way to get cabbage in my son's diet.  I served it with hot german potato salad heated in the oven topped with keilbasa sausage. German mustard and beer on the side of coarse.  Thanks Jen.

This was excellent. It was even better the second day. The only thing I would change is cute the bacon fat in 1/2. It steams so well to cook. It was just a bit too greasy for me. Yummy and great on ATKINS!

My grandma made this often when I was a child but I had forgotten about it until I saw this recipe. Made this for our New Year's cabbage and it was just like I remembered it tasting. So good that I had the bit that was left over for breakfast the next morning. Thank you Jen for bringing back good memories. I will be making this often.

Quite tasty as is but can be "tarted up". It is hard to find recipies that don't require many ingredients. The only veg left in the house tonight was cabbage and onion,we had a little bacon in the freezer and not much else in the pantry.

We liked this recipe.  I didn't have too much bacon grease as others did.  In fact, my husband thinks it needs more bacon next time.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  Simple, incredibly filling and low carb.  Yes, it is dripping with bacon drippings but aside from loving cabbage which we both do, that was the other major flavors in this dish so no complaints here.  Thank you, we will make this again.

Good.  Nice flavor, but I agree with other comments that you need to drain some of the grease.

Really good flavor that even my teenager enjoyed and she usually hates any item that starts with "v" for vegetable.  Be mindful of the amount of grease in the pan after Step 1.  Excessive bacon grease is not too attractive when the cabbage gets cold and the drippings start to harden.  Nonetheless, I'll make this again.

This was so-so.  We thought it was too blah using the recipe. I ended up adding more onion, bacon (Plumrose Maple Bacon) sugar and vinegar and making it a true sweet-sour dish.    The onion I used was a large sweet Vidalia onion. After the alterations, we loved it!

This was my first time making cabbage as well.  I loved it!  I did add a little too much peper but overall this was good.  Next time I think I'm going to follow some of the other reviews and add alittle garlic powder and a few more slices of bacon.

Very good.  I've made sauteed cabbage before just using butter, salt and pepper.  This is a nice alternative.

I have never liked cooked cabbage but this recipe changed my mind. Very tasty and it doesn't stink up your house like other cooked cabbage recipes!

This was excellent.  I served it with corned beef, and I would have eaten it on its own.  The only change I made, was I only used a tsp of the vinegar, as I thought a Tbsp might be overwhelming.  The tsp added just the right amount of zing.  It disappeared very quickly.

This is absolutely awesome!! I did add a little more bacon as I LOVE it and I didn't have cider vinegar so I used plain white. I also added a dash of paprika and a dash of garlic powder. I made this recipe for myself since my hubby doesn't like cabbage and I ate the WHOLE batch that same night. I will be making this often!

This was good.  I had never had Fried Cabbage before I made Indiana-Style Fried Cabbage which is on this site.  We loved that - I didn't have all the ingredients to make it today so I tried this one.  In comparison I give the Indiana cabbage a 5 star and this one a 4 star.  If I make this type again I think I will add butter.

I usually don't eat cabbage but will eat it from now on because of this recipe.  Very delicious.  I didn't add the vinegar and didn't think it needed it and it was true in my opinion.
