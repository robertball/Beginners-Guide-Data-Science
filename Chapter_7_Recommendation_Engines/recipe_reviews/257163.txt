It made a decent quick late breakfast with toast.   We usually only have 2 meals on Sunday...late breakfast and early early supper.  Used leftover home made chili.  It wasn't quite O T Hodges but it was nice.

I was looking for a recipe for leftover chilli. I wanted to do something with it for breakfast. So, I used my homemade chilli instead of a can. Oh, and I uesd a mixed mexican cheese as well. I like the idea of this recipe. It came out good.

Not a big fan of canned chili so I used some of my leftover chili for a great meal. Scrambling the eggs in the chili works just as well.

The eggs didn't seem necessary in the recipe.  Just made it heavier dish.
