I recalculated the servings to 150 and the recipe made 5 pound cakes using the mini loaf pans. 
I used my own Blueberries that I froze from last season. Some of the comments from friends that I have given the cakes to are: 
The Blueberry Pound Cake is fabulous, delicious & very moist & tasty.   LOVE the Blueberry pound cake, wow, want the recipe.
