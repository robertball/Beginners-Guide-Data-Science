I love the principal here and that's to take any jar of pasta sauce and doctor it to something approximating homemade.  I used Tomato sauce instead of paste,added Italian seasoning and a bit of brown sugar to counter the acidity. As per another website, I also added a pat of butter at the very end - it's supposed to smooth out the sauce and help eliminate acidity.  To put this recipe to a real test, I bought the store's cheapest pasta sauce. The end result is really great.  The benefit of going this route rather than the 'totally from scratch' route, is a shorter cooking time, and, really, a more reliable end product.  I would use this for company any time.

Essentially this is how I do mine as well when I am not interested in making it from scratch. Yeah I know some of the people are harping about using "jar/can" sauce as the base but let them complain elsewhere. Hell, when I make sauce from scratch, I'll be d*mned if I am going to grow tomatoes in a garden and spend a whole afternoon processing them. Bah! I just buy a 30 oz can of sauce, some cans of fire roasted tomatoes and a few cans of paste anyway. Simpler that way. But pre-made jar sauce often needs just a touch more than what the manufacturers put into it anyway.

I omitted the butter and increased the olive oil (to be honest, I have used butter in a tomato-based sauce before and I did not like the end result). I left out the meat because I was using this sauce for a Baked Ravioli recipe. I also cut back on the rosemary a bit because it can be quite potent and I didn't want it overpowering the sauce. I also added a couple tablespoons of brown sugar. I let this simmer for a little over two hours. My jarred sauce was a more expensive quality and I used a good bottle of burgundy. VERY GOOD. You would have thought I cooked this from scratch!

Understand that this spaghetti sauce only will be as good as the jar of pasta sauce that you use, and there is a fair amount of chopping and slicing involved.  This just isn’t a quick weeknight meal where you brown some ground beef, add a jar of  sauce, and then serve over some pasta.  My husband bought a jar of Classico Basil and Tomato Pasta Sauce which has been sitting around collecting dust, so I decided to give this recipe a try.  If you’re going to do this much prep work, you might as well use canned tomatoes (fresh would be even better) and make your own spaghetti sauce rather than using a jar of pasta sauce as the base.  The recipe also doesn't tell you when to add the mushrooms that you've sautéed.  We ate it, but I thought it was just ordinary and not tasty enough to justify all of the prep work and the fairly long of ingredients that you'd be using if you made your own spaghetti sauce. Sorry for the bad review, but this just didn't work for us.

My family loved it! I do make my own sauce from scratch and we do like that better but we all thought this was a great substitute for a quick weeknight dinner. I used some sauce I got on sale, got pre sliced mushrooms, garlic from a jar and dried minced onions so there was no chopping at all. got it cooking before I did the noodles so it had a little time to simmer and it turned out great. thanks for the idea!

What a great idea!  The point of this recipe, as I understand it, is to up the flavor and freshness profile of sauce from a jar.  Even a very good sauce from a jar is still going to taste like sauce from a jar.

This really perked up a can of store bought spaghetti sauce. I didn't follow all of the steps. I just added the ground beef, olive oil, onion, garlic, spices and wine to the sauce. I also added a 1/4 cup of grated Parmesan . I dumped everything into a crockpot and let it simmer on low for 6 hours and it turned out great.

I have done this for years when I was a working Mother and wanted a good sauce without going for homemade.  The only difference in mine is that I don't add the bell peppers, oregano (not a fan) or rosemary to the jarred sauce. I add one can of diced tomatoes, the red wine, fresh basil, onion (It can be dried, but I usually chop a fresh one) mushrooms, and a couple squeezes of tomato paste. Also add a bit of sugar, after tasting. The red wine gives it a richness and flavor level that is delicious, but you can leave it out, if preferred. I use either ground beef, or sometimes cooked italian sausage, sliced. This whole process takes 10 minutes, tops. To the complainers who said this takes almost as long as homemade,  you either didn't try it or you chop very slowly, plus homemade needs to simmer for quite some time to blend the flavors.  This is quick and delicious. Try it, you'll like it.

Kind of labor intensive. Although it is good it takes almost the same amount of time to make it home made. I was looking for something simple and this really wasn't it.

This is what I usually do with sauce in a jar. This time, I took another reviewer's advice and used from instead of white sugar. Really  a unique taste and my husband loved it. Thanks for all the suggestions!

Zero point in this one. You are just making your own spaghetti sauce, esp if you increase the paste or add a can of crushed tomatoes. Unless you have your own garden (and many of us don't), it is more cost-effective to just buy a better jar of sauce!

When the kids were young and I was working full time, I made a version that the kids still call "Hurry Up Spaghetti." Serve over spaghetti squash and you have a healthy alternative to canned spaghetti (which I secretly love!).

We loved it. I was a little short on tomato paste and red wine but it tasted great anyway. I used olive oil instead of butter, frozen chopped onions and peppers, so all I had to slice were mushrooms.

I followed the recipe to a t, and used an expensive tomato sauce. I didn't like it at all, although by boys didn't complain.
