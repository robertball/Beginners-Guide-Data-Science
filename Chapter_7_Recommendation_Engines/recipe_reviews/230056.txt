These weren't necessairly bad, but they weren't to my taste, and definitely not what I was expecting.  While they are glazed, it was more of a savory glaze as opposed to a sweet glaze.  I wasn't a fan but my husband loved.  If I make this again, it will be in a small batch for him, and keep mine unglazed.

I made this for easter this year and they were delish!! The only thing I did differently is I roasted the carrots and the brussel sprouts instead of boiling them. I will definately make this again!

The sauce was a little thick, so I thinned it out with a little more apple juice and another good squeeze of lemon.  Made exactly as written, tasted, and then added a little more cloves to suit our tastes.  We love fresh brussels sprouts, so I'm always looking for new recipes; this was a nice change of pace.

This was a twist on brussel sprouts and it was pretty good.

Sorry...I didn't use beef broth or the brown sugar. Was a lovely dish! Took it to lunch and ate it cold and it was still yummy! Will totally do again!!

I made this recipe just as written except I didn't have lemon juice so I substituted lemonade. I used multicolored carrots and fresh Brussels Sprouts. The vegetables cooked perfect to my liking, soft, not mushy but I would prefer more flavor. I only salted the water when I cooked the veggies so it may have needed more salt. An interesting not fantastic flavor in my opinion.

I made this exactly as written, except I cooked the sprouts and carrots separately because I thought the carrots would take longer--which they did.  Although the dish looked very colorful and attractive with its glossy glaze, I didn't like the flavor. Too strong a clove flavor, but I also didn't enjoy the beef broth-apple combination.

The carrots were good, but the brussel sprouts were just ok.  I'd make this again with just the carrots
