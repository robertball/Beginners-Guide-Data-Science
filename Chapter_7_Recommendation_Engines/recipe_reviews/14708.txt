OK, EVERYBODY, LISTEN UP!  If your complaint is that the meat was TOO DRY, then you need to get out your meat thermometer and USE IT!  The #1 reason that pork is "dry" is that you have overcooked it!  Pork should be done to an internal temperative of 160 degrees.  There should be a touch of pink to it.  Sorry, some of you are from the old school of NO PINK IN PORK, but that is just simply not true.  This was an absolutely DELICIOUS recipe.  My teenage son came up from the rec room to inquire what that AMAZING SMELL was!  We ALL loved it!  I'll be making this again and again!  Only substitution I made was using white wine vinegar as I did not have apple cider vinegar on hand.

This is an AWESOME recipe and the way I made it will probably be the only way I make a pork roast from now on.  I used about a 3 pound pork loin roast and the first thing I did was make a mixture of
1 1/2 Tblsp. fresh rosemary, 1 tsp. garlic salt, 1/2 tsp. dried thyme, and 1/4 tsp. freshly ground black pepper and put that along with the roast in a plastic bag, shaking it up to coat the roast with the mixture and let in sit in the refrigerator for about an hour or so.  After taking it out again I continued on with this recipe just as written and did also add about a tsp. of caraway, as one other reviewer suggested.  I put it in a smaller pan so that the juices wouldn't evaporate as quickly and when it was done we used the juices as au jus.  IT WAS WONDERFUL!  Great flavor, very moist and tender.  I think the vinegar helps with that.  I served oven roasted vegetables from this website with this, butternut squash, and apple crisp for dessert.  It was a very memorable meal that everyone enjoyed!

Great recipe. I do mine in a crock pot on low for about 6-7 hours. It turns out great...and the drippings make a great base for a nice gravy. A great way to do a pork roast.

Great recipe.  This was the first time I've made a pork roast.  I used fresh thyme and added more cider vinegar as it evaporated during cooking.  During the last hour of cooking, I added chopped potato, onion, and carrots, tossed with a small amount of olive oil, garlic salt, ground black pepper, and balsalmic vinegar, to the roasting pan.  I also added some chopped green and red bell peppers, zucchini, and yellow squash to the veggie mixture the last 20 minutes.  Served with cranberries, green tossed salad and crusty bread.  The roast was quite juicy and had great flavor.  Wonderful!

I loved this recipe. My husband is very picky eater and generally does not like pork. A friend gave me a loin roast so I was searching for a creative way to fix it. I used balsamic because that was what I had on hand at the time. It was heavenly!!! My 9 year old also loved it. He poured some of the juices over his mashed potatoes and raved about those also. Will definitely fix again...as a matter of fact, I have one in the oven right now. I would recommend monitoring the doneness because it got done faster than the recipe said.

Very good, and the deal about smell in kitchen I don't get. I had no problem, but I'm a man and we're not supposed to smell as well as women! Anyway the main thing about this recipe is the cooking time. I used a 5 lb boneless pork loin and it was at 170 degrees after 2 hrs! So start watching it at around 2 hours. I hadn't yet put the sourkraut around it yet so had to take the roast out and just bake it by it's self. I also used a great cranberry sauce to spoon over the servings. Take  1 can cranberry sauce plus 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1 cup orange juice and heat on stove until desolved and spoon over meat. Very good. Time to go I am now hungry!

Very moist and tasty. A few changes:  I used    1/4 cup balsamic vinegar in place of cider vinegar and added 1 can of beef broth to the mix.  I sprinkled the roast with meat tenderizer and granulated garlic in additon to the salt and pepper and garlic cloves. I added 4 peeled and cut potatoes and 3 carrots during the last hour of cooking. Total cooking time was 3 1/2 hours for a 5 lb. roast.  The sauce made an excellent gravy. My husband is a great cook, and rated this recipe 5 stars.

Best ever!  I felt like I was eating at a 5-star resturant!  This is one to keep and cherish - I will serve this the next time I have company.

I added a little sage and some caraway seeds to the rub, omitted the salt (hubby can't have any) and doubled the amount of bay leaves.  It was to die for!

This is unbelievable.  I am always looking for an easy pork recipe, and this fills the bill.  I upt the thyme a little and used a small 8X8 brownie pan.  The juices didn't burn up in the pan.  The vinegar smell lasts for a short time, and gives way to delicious smells.  I can't say enough about this recipe.  I use so many complex recipes with lots of ingredients.  This was a great change of pace.  I served the loin with spaetzle.  They soaked up the au jus.

I decided to use this recipe for a holiday roast and it was well received by my guests, as a matter of fct they raved about it and wanted the recipe. Contrary to what others have said my house did not smell like vinegar.  That might have been because I used considerably less vinegar marinade. The recipe called for what seemed like too much so I reduced the marinade by almost half. Plus I used a combo of rice and apple cider vinegar.  The next time I will try a combo of rice and balsamic to see which one I liked best.

Great recipe! I had a 3 lb roast and it was finished in 2 hrs. I did keep it covered for the first hour and basted as recommended. It was well done, but tender and did not dry out. I also put a pan of sweet potato and apple chunks tossed in olive oil and sea salt in with it for the last hour, and they turned out perfect with the roast. I also made a gravy with the drippings left in the pan. Definitely doing again - thank you!

Pork roast is not my favorite but using this recipe as a starting point it was delicious and is company-worthy.  As a "seasoned" cook, I usually customize recipes to our taste or using ingredients on hand:  I used additional seasonings of rosemary, crushed fennel seeds and lemon-pepper and placed it in a zip-lock in the fridge for about an hour.  I pan seared it before placing it in the oven and used about 1/2 cup chicken broth.  Because it was small (2 lbs) it was done in about 1-1/2 hours.  The thickened broth made a wonderful gravy.  I'll be using this recipe in the future.

Instead of cutting slits in the roast, I coated it with garlic powder, onion powder, sea salt and fresh ground pepper before braising the roast in hot oil/butter until it had a nice sear on all sides. After that, I set the roast on a plate and threw in two sliced onions into the hot butter and lovely roast bits and scraped the pan. I let the onions saute a bit until nicely browned, then added half the amount of vinegar and finished scraping the bottom of the pan, then added the thyme. I poured the onion-vinegar mixture in the bottom of the roasting pan, then placed the roast on top of it. My roast took just a little longer to cook because mine was a monster but when it was done, it was fragrant and falling apart and all kinds of noms. I don't know that I would use vinegar again unless I WAS serving it with mashed sweet potatoes or an apple side dish. Next time, I might try this with either white or red wine. As is, it's a tastyrecipe with the ingredients called for with a couple changes thrown in. NOTE: Basting is key to make this so moist and fall-apart-y. You don't have to do it constantly but every half hour or so is sufficient.

I, too, had some problems with losing the moisture before the roast was done. I added a bit of apple juice to the pan and covered it, once the original juices ran out. The end result was a fully cooked, moist and flavorful roast. The seasoning on this recipe is just right. I'll be saving this one.

Delicious recipe!  I cooked this in my crockpot and used the same basic ingredients.  I substituted tarragon vinegar for apple cider and added 1-2 sliced apples to the crock for the last hour or so.  I served the apples over the pork.  A new favourite!

BEST pork roast I have had.  Everyone loved it.  Tender and juicy.  (Whoops...I forgot the bay leaves...still yummy.)  My only note is that it was done WAY sooner!  I was glad I had a thermometer in it.  After one hour, it was already 158 degrees (but keep in mind it was a much smaller roast...maybe 2 pounds).  The rest of dinner wasn't ready, so I just turned off the oven and let it sit there for about 30-45 minutes.  Then I had it rest outside the oven, covered for 10-15 minutes while we finished making dinner.
After slicing, I returned it to the pan with juices (adding a couple Tbsp. of chicken broth to thin it out and break off the bits from the bottom of the pan) and put it back into the oven to warm.  Moist and delish!  Thanks for a great recipe.

I used this recipe with a pork butt since that was what I had. Cut down on the vinegar to 1/4c per other suggestions.  Also added olive oil and made a paste per another suggestion.  Since the pork butt is slit in the middle, I rubbed half the paste in the cavity with sliced onion and rubbed the rest on the top.  Also put entire roast in a baking bag.  Great results!  Very moist and delicious.  I usually make a pork butt with just salt, pepper and garlic along with onions and other veggies in the bag.  This had a great taste.  First hour vinegar smell was a little worrisome but not to worry....it didn't affect the taste adversely.  It was wonderful!  Family scarfed it up and asked for more!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I decided to try this recipe in my slow cooker, so yesterday morning I added all the ingredients into the crock pot around 7 am, put the crock pot setting on low and we ate at six last night. I was very impressed with this recipe! The meat came out very tender and juicy and the flavor was subtle, none of the spices were overpowering. Great comfort food, will definitely make again! Thanks Teresa.

This was an extremely easy recipe and it turned out delicious.  Like many other reviewer, I used half balsamic vinegar and half cider vinegar.  Watch the cooking time closely (mine cooked much faster).  The roast was juicy, spicy, and everyone loved it.  Don't worry about making too much; the leftovers are just as good as the first day.

One of my all time favorites, especially for holidays.  I add a little orange juice & balsamic vinegar to the apple cider vinegar and it is even more special.

This was yummy! I was a little nervous with all the vinegar and wow did it sting my eyes when I opened the oven to baste the roast, but all my worrying was for nothing because this was delicious! I didn't have garlic cloves, so I used minced garlic and I didn't have dried thyme, so I used ground thyme. I didn't measure the salt and pepper.. just sprinkled it on instead.. results were wonderful. Easy to make and my husband keeps asking when we are going to have that again. Thank you for the recipe!

Wonderful!  This recipe leaves the roast juicy and flavorful.  There didn't seem to be enough pan juice for basting, so I just mixed another batch of sauce and poured that over the roast while cooking.  It's very simple to make but you wouldn't guess so with such a rich and tangy flavor.

This was a really fast and easy recipe. The roast came out very tender and flavorful. The only time the vinegar smell was obnoxious was when I opened the door on the oven to check the roasts' progress. Geez, talk about turning your mouth inside out! Try this recipe.

I am famous (or should I say infamous according to who you talk to)for adlibbing on recipes. Well it just so happened I was out of apple cider vinegar and ended up using 3/4 rice vinegar and 1/4 balsamic vinegar for this recipe. It was fantastic! I think next time I'll go 1/2 and 1/2 and pierce the roast all the way through with my skewers so that when I baste it, the flavor will go all the way through. I could not believe the flavor that balsamic vinegar gave to the glaze. Maybe some of you would want to try it that way too. I would never have thought that vinegar would be good on a roast. Thans for putting it online!

I did not like this at all.  It was very bland, and it took much less time to cook than the recipe called for.  I usually love pork recipes that call for stuffing the meat with garlic, but this one was not a hit at my dinner table.

I thought at first this was gonna  kinda bland - but it was so tender and flavorful! I did use red wine vinegar and balsamic together. That's the only thing I changed! It was great! i also too it out at 155 degrees. Perfect.

I made this last night and it turned out great!  Like other reviews I rubbed a paste with olive oil, salt, pepper, onion powder and thyme on the meat before cooking. I also added 2 cups of chicken stock after the first hour of cooking.  I added a cornstarch flurry to the juice after cooking and the gravy was really tasty.

This is one of the easiest pork recipes I've ever prepared. I made a few slits in the meat and filled them w/minced garlic. I mixed the rest of the ingredients in a ziplock bag and let the pork marinate for a couple of hours. As other reviewers suggested, I used a pan just big enough to fit the roast to help prevent the liquid from evaporating too quickly. Basting Is A Must! The kitchen smelled strongly of vinegar while it was roasting, but the flavor turned out great and was not overpowering. I had a 2 lb roast and used a meat thermometer to pull it out at 160.

This makes a fabulous roast if you do it right. It is not for those skinny pork loin roasts and if you try to do it with one of those you'll need to cook it for a lot less time. I have made this many times and what makes this recipe special for me is the bay leaves! So I now use A LOT more bay leaves. I pretty much cover the bottom of the roast with them, then half way through I turn the roast over and pull off all the bay leaves and stick them under the side that is now facing down. That way the bay flavor infuses into the meat. I've seen lots of recipes with the garlic and I wouldn't skip that step, but the bay leaves mix with the garlic in an amazing way. Also, keep in  mind, the vinegar smell may bother some people while it is cooking, but they won't complain about the flavor of the roast when it's done. I've tried using a number of different vinegars, but ultimately they'll have that smell no matter what you do when they're boiling off. I like either the cider vinegar or balsamic. (Though FYI: Bobby Flay recommends sherry vinegar in place of balsamic for recipes and I tried it and thought it was gross!) :)

UPDATE: 12/14  I now use more bay leaves, I stick them to the roast all the way around (maybe four per side) and I use more garlic and more thyme. However, I now use half white balsamic vinegar and half vermouth. It cuts the vinegar smell a bit and the flavor is still awesome. My family loves this as sliced lunch meat after too. It's like an herbed deli meat.

Fantastic recipe.  Entire family loved it.  I had a smaller roast, so I covered for 1/2 the time, and only cooked for 2 hours.  Added onions, carrots, and potatoes to the pot for last hour.  Made gravy with cornstarch from drippings which was excellent!  Thanks for the great recipe.

We liked this recipe and will use it again.  The roast was perhaps the most tender loin roast we've ever done and the taste was very good. Cooked to internal temp. 170 F in open pan with a rack, adding water to pan later on.

Very good. I made this in the crock pot and it turned out great. The only think I changed was I added a bit of beef stock (paste) to the crock pot for added flavor. Highly recommended!!

This recipe teeters between 3 and 4 stars in my book.  Definitely earns 5 stars for simplicity based on how it's written, though I always sear the roast before cooking it and substitute white wine for the vinegar.  I think it's tasty and simple, just wish the exterior flavor carried through the entire roast.

I followed these directions to the T, I had to add water to the pan as the cider vinegar mixture dried out. It was still delicious and I will definately make again. As to the vinegar smell we didn't mind it went away after a while

Superb!  Definately the only way to ever make pork again.  A must to use a meat thermometer and remove at 160.  Roast was so flavorful, moist and tender.  I served this with mashed potatoes and stewed cabbage from this site.  My family cleaned their entire plate and my 14 year old son had seconds and cleaned the second plate as well.  I put the garlic in the slits and made a dry rub of seasonings similar to another reviewer and left it in the fridge for 24 hours in an airtight ziplock bag, then followed the recipe as written.  Everyone should try this roast.

This recipe made a fabulous-tasting, juicy roast.  Don't be alarmed at the smell of vinegar when you first put the roast in the oven.  It dissipates after 30-40 minutes.  Thanks so much, this recipe is delicious!

Just as many reviewers wrote, this was delicious! I added some rosemary & sage, and used a much smaller roast. Even with the smaller roast, I increased the amount of seasonings, as we enjoy lots of flavor. Used garlic powder instead of fresh and it was great! Since I only had about 1/3 cup of apple cider vinegar left, I also used a small amount of balsamic. The flavor was so good and the roast, taken out when the internal thermometer read 170 degrees, was moist and juicy!

I just made this dish for new years and it was the best, moist pork roast I have ever made.  A few important factors are key for this dish.  Whomever wrote the review about the meat themometer was so right.  Use it and take this out of the oven at 160 degrees.  I put minced bay leafs on top and baste often.  I added about 1/3 cup of water after about an hour of cooking from evaporation.  This is so easy and soooooo good.

Very good.  Flavorful and moist.  I added rosemary as some had mentioned.  Also, I was worried about the vinegar since some had complained about it.  So, I added 1/3 a cup of vinegar and 1/3 cup water.  It tasted wonderful and there was no vinegar taste to the final product.  We'll make this again.

I made this recipe over the holidays for my sister and her husband who were staying with me for some time. My brother-in-law is very particular about his meat. This roast was delicious!! Everyone enjoyed it and my brother-in-law, who NEVER eats left-overs, ate off the roast for 3 days. I used white-wine vinegar instead of apple cider vinegar. I had to add more liquids to properly baste. Overall very good.

I'm not sure if I did something wrong - but this was very disappointing.  The pork was tender but the flavor was not very good.  I will not make again.

I have made this twice now exactly as described (*with two procedural exceptions, see below) and it turns out beautifully for me. I make it in a covered cast iron oval roaster. *I never baste, and I remove the cover at 2 1/2 hrs, check the temp and then continue to roast until the required temp is reached. This gives me a nice browning on the top.

Cooked as instructed with a 3 1/2 lb bone-in pork roast.  I also added some cut potatoes after about 1 hour cooking time to the pan with a small amount of butter.  It was perfect and my kids loved it!

This roast is wonderful!!!  I didn't even do very much basting.   I covered my roasting pan with foil for an hour (after about a 1/2 hour of browning).  It was done 1/2 after that for a total of 2 hours in the oven.  There were lots of juices that made a wonderful gravy too.  I just poured the drippings/juices into a saucepan, added around a cup of cold water that had 2 tablespoons of cornstarch whisked in, then cooked & stirred until it thickened and served with mashed potatoes.  So juicy and flavorful.  Thank you for a real keeper of a recipe!

Pretty good.  Bf liked it.  I can't say I was that big of a fan, but to be fair, 1) I wasn't that hungry and 2) I'm not a big fan of pork roast anyway.  I didn't think the cider vinegar was too strong.  I added some rosemary to the pot, and I used more garlic than called for.  I had minced garlic, so I just used that instead.  I cooked it in the slow cooker like another reviewer did.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a good (and simple!) recipe that I would make again.  Like many reviewers, the 1/2 cup vinegar evaporated very quickly (and I used a pan only slightly larger than the roast).  I added another 1/2 cup of vinegar and then probably about a cup of water during the cooking time and was left with about 3 Tb of au jus (GREAT flavor - just wanted more of it).  The roast was quite lean so that was likely part of the cause.  I roasted it to 150 and let it sit for 10 minutes to rise up to 160.

Next time I'll start with 1 cup of vinegar, 1 cup of water and a few Tb of olive oil, and will use a bigger pan so I can toss in some potatoes during the last hour of cooking.

My partner and I tried this over the weekend for a quick prep and easy entrée for a dinner guest. Prep was a cinch and took next to no time. The pork loin I got was pretty lean making for no drippings in which the loin could cook, so I added some olive oil midway through baking. Also, the roast was only 2.5 lbs. I baked for 1.5 hours, and still exceeded the desired internal temp, so I was concerned the meat would be dry. Not so! It was still wonderfully juicy and tasted great. Served with baked parmesan asaparagus and rosemary/garlic roasted red potatoes. I plan to use fresh thyme -- and lots of it -- for the next occasion to bring out the flavor a bit more. Regardless, this recipe was a genuine hit!

My husband tasted the 'small' amount of garlic (he hates garlic), so he wasn't crazy about this one.  Personally, I think the next time I would marinate it first, since it didn't come out as tender as I hoped.  I also added bay leaves under the fat top layer, as another reviewer suggested, but I didn't like that at all!  I don't feel that the 1/2 cup of vinegar was enough liquid for this recipe.  I'll make some adjustments the next time I make this one.

I added rosemary and garlic salt to the spices, put them all in a bag, added the roast and shook to coat. I also seared the roast on ALL sides and used Balsamic vinegar. Basting is a MUST! This was GREAT!

Best pork roast I ever made! Juicy and tender. Be patient though, after the vinegar cooks down it will smell much better.

This was my first time making a pork roast. The meat was very tender but didn't seem to have much flavor. I rarely eat pork so I am unsure what to expect. I cooked it in a crockpot for 7 hours on low and added 1/3 c. water (to tone down the vinegar). The juices smelled great but it didn't seem to really get into the meat as I had hoped. I will probably make again & try the oven.

This was delicious, a must try, I added garlic powder, rosemary and seasoned salt to the rub, cooked it for about an hour and a half(I had about a 3 lb roast).  I basted it every 15 minutes and I also skewered the meat so that the juices would soak up through the middle of the meat as well.  Easy to make and well worth your time.  I served this with creamed corn, cranberries, sweet potatoes and a ceasar salad.  5 Stars all the way!!

I'm 17 and scared to make this recipe...because if the recipe turned out not tasting good I would have a hungry angry family after me. No need to worry. This recipe is amazing...simple...delicious and fun for beginners like me.I hate vinegar even in salad dressing so I was skeptical...but I had no reason to. Once the tyme and meat juice mixed with the vinegar it makes this sweet delicious gravy...it smells unpleasant only for about 30 to 45 minutes then it turns into a delicious smell that will make your mouth water. I made fresh mashed potatoes with carmalized onions...it was SOOOO GOOD !!! my only complaint about this recipes is that disappears quickly...I will make two at the same time next time...and there will be a next time

This is a great recipe!  Very easy, tender and tasty. Instead of baking it in the oven, I cooked it in the crockpot for 10 hrs - m-m good!  I cut the recipe in half, but next time I won't - the leftovers were just as wonderful. It's a keeper!

Although this roast looked beautiful when it was done, I probably won't make it again. First of all, to say the house stunk would be an understatement! The smell of vinegar was so over powering the first hour it was cooking my husband (who loves vinegar!) went outside so he could breathe! Also there is no way you could baste the roast following the recipe. Within the first 1/2 hr of cooking all the liquid was gone. I had to add at least 1/2 cup of water to the pan every time I went to baste it and also added 1/4 cup melted butter over the top of the roast after 2 hours. Although I had some great tasting gravy, the roast itself was only OK. But I will eat the leftovers!

My husband actually ate FOUR helpings of this recipe....and he soesn't usually eat very much roast-type foods. He LOVED it! I thought it was WONDERFUL also. The smell wasn't intolerable, even though I was pregnant at the time....not the most pleasing either, but well worth it! Thanks Teresa!

I have made this twice and it is just wonderful! The roast browns just enough and is sooo moist. I used a 21/2 boneless loin since it was just me and my husband. The vineager smell is noticeable for a while-- but who cares!! Thanks, Teresa, for a really great recipe.

Wow...This was wonderful!  I was out of Thyme so I used rosemary vinegar and Balsamic vinegar.  The house really stunk of vinegar for the first hour or so,  but it was worth it.  I made gravy from the drippings and it was wonderful.  Thanks for sharing.

OUTSTANDING!  The first time I made this I overbaked it slightly.  I now only go by the internal temperature.  This is one of the tastiest pork recipes I have found.  I did, however, double the garlic and added several more by leaves to the bottom of the pan.  Would (and have) recommend this to anyone.

This was an excellent and easy way to cook a pork roast for Sunday dinner.  I live at altitude in Colorado so I had to add some water to the pan, which released the carmelization on the bottom of the pan and made it even more flavorful.  I probably added at least a cup of water to keep it from drying out.  I basted throughout.  I used minced garlic to stuff in the pork....probably a tablespoon or more.  If your pork roast is too dry, you're cooking too long or too hot.  This is a slow roast process; the vinegar keeps it moist and you should not be tasting vinegar when cooked correctly.  I also added onions and carrots the last hour of roasting.  Delicious!

This was a great recipe.  I did make a few adjustments, but not many.  I added more salt and pepper because one teaspoon isn't going to flavor a whole roast.  But that's up to personal taste.  I used red wine vinegar and mixed it with apple cider, salt and pepper, powdered garlic and onion.  I used rosemary instead of thyme because that was the herb I had handy.  I added potatoes, carrot, and onion for the last hour to roast.  I took the meat out and then cranked the oven to finish off the veg.  It was very flavorful and very juicy.  I will make this again.

Good, but a bit too much smell and flavor of apple cider for me.  Will try again with less cider.  And, 6-7 hours in crock pot as one person suggested was way too long for mine.  It was overcooked in just 3 hours.  For gravy, I followed the instructions on the Kitchen Boquet bottle, and my family LOVED it!

From a seasoning standpoint, I liked the combination,but if I ever make this again I'll try using a different cut of meat, like a pork tenderloin.  This was my first time to make a pork roast that wasn't the pre-seasoned type in a bag, and my family and I were disappointed in the dish overall.  But I'm attributing this to the meat (we used a Hormel pork butt roast).  Didn't care for the pork flavor itself or the toughness of this roast.

I cooked this in a crockpot so it was wonderfully easy, and the roast itself made plenty of juice so I didn't have to add any other broth or water. I did periodically bast it.  But ugh, wrong cut of meat.  I don't think all the seasoning in the world could redeem the taste and texture of a pork butt roast.

I used a pork sirloin bone in roast. It turned out great. I did add an apple at the begining for a little sweetness and half a packet of onion soup mix with 1 cup water. Next time I will use a boneless roast and I will double the vinegar sauce. It was definetly a hit with my husband.

I followed the recipe exactly except I cooked it in a slow cooker on Low for five hours (my slow cooker thinks it's an oven!) I thought it was pretty good, but even though I cut the slits and filled with garlic as the recipe states, the flavor was only on the outside of the meat so I served it with a vinegar based barbeque sauce. It did make great sliced pork barbeque sandwiches! If I want a pork loin that I can eat without "doctoring" with sauce, I will stick with the Balsamic Roasted pork loin recipe on this site. If I want an easy barbeque recipe, I'll try this one again. Thanks!

I wish you could have smelled my house while this roast was cooking!(i mean that in a good way) lol..I wasn't sure about all that vinigar but it was so good. I added some Rosemary but otherwise followed the recipe as written. And i avoided the temptation to overcook pork like i usually do.  Moist and delicious.

This was delicous. I made axactly as the recipe stated. I cooked for 1 hr 20 min for a 2 lb roast. It was tender and juicy. The vinegar smell was unpleasant at first while cooking.

We love this recipe!! You can get pre portioned Pork Loins at Costco, just the right size for this recipe. I did make a couple of changes: About half way I switch to apple juice instead of vinegar and I baste every 15 minutes the whole time. A really simple and tasty recipe!

I used Rosemary instead of thyme and also used red wine garlic vinager instead of cider vinager needless to say this recipe came out great I went by the internal temp rather than cooking time and it came out really moist. My best pork roast to date. Would really reccommend.

I made a 1.5 lb pork roast in my crockpot on high for 1.5 hours. I really liked the seasoning but unfortunately it didn't cook long enough to temper the strong flavor of the vinegar. Luckily I love the flavor of vinegar. I added the rosemary as the other reviewers said, also chopped up half an onion and threw in some frozen baby carrots. The vegetables came out delicious!!!! I love the vinegar/thyme/bay/rosemary infusion in the carrots so much I am planning to experiment on a cold carrot salad with the vinegar/thyme dressing. Maybe simmer it all on the stovetop and then chill. Thanks so much for the great flavoring! Oh the meat was tasty as well, I should have started it earlier and slow cooked it though!

This is GREAT!! I used my slow cooker and put 4 small bay leaves and 1 onion sliced on the bottom and on top of that I put a 6lb. shoulder blade pork roast with the garlic slivers(a must). I only had 1/4 c. of cider vinegar so to that I added 1/4c of apple cider to make 1/2c liquid. Poured that over the roast and cooked it on high for 7 hrs. The roast came out so tender and juicy, I've never had it like that before and the gravy was out of this world.  This will be the only way I'll make a pork roast again.  Thank You Teresa for this awesome recipe.

I was not impressed with this, unfortunately. The pork came out moist enough, but the taste was very lacking. Very, very bland (obviously pork isn't the most flavorful meat in the world, but the seasonings didn't help any). I followed the recipe exactly and just wasn't happy with the results. I made a simple gravy from the drippings which made it decent, but I won't make this one again. Thanks anyway!

I just took the roast out of the oven and let it sit for 10-15 min.  I was very leery of the vinegar but this is the best pork roast I think I have made~!
I cooked it in a cast iron skillet(my favorite!) with a lid since I wasn't in the house to baste...didn't add additional liquid and it is excellent!!   Thanks!!

Added rosemary and garlic salt.  Otherwise, followed the recipe.  Great flavor, but a little dry.  Next time, I will cover the roast.  I think that would bump my rating up to a 5!

Excellent!  I altered it a bit by using a bit less vinegar and adding enough olive oil to make a paste.  I also used sea salt, sage and pepper in the rub.

Retain the drippings for a gravy.

This was good, but I had an odd experience while making it.  I followed all the directions carefully, but put it in the crockpot for 8 hours on low.  About 2 hours into cooking, the garlic had turned BLUE.  According to the web, it was likely a reaction between the garlic in the slits in the roast and the vinegar I poured on top (not a danger, totally edible).  By the time the roast was done, the color had faded to a brownish green that didn't seem to alarming.

This turned out great and looked cool too.  Everyone commented on what a great (fancy) cook I was-little did they know how easy it was to make.  One small problem-I didn't have a roasting pan so I put it in a 9X13 and that must have been too big because all the juice evaporated off within the first 30 min.  (Also-my house really smelled like vinegar for the first hour).  I freaked out when I saw the juice was gone, so I added 1/4 cup of water.  I had to do this about 3 times because it kept evaporating off.  Not sure why, but the roast tasted great in the end.

This was a very good recipe. It got good reviews from everyone who ate it.  I've never made a pork roast by myself before, so it worked good.  My boyfriend says "no Thyme", but I didn't listen this time(I go a little crazy sometimes). I cut the amount of vinegar, as I had only a 4 pound roast. I used the same amount of garlic, though.  I also added garlic and onion powder, too, just a pinch. Two hours cooking time was perfect (every meat thermometer I,ve owned broke). It came out great though, the tastiest pork roast I've ever had.
Thanks for the recipe.

Very good.  I followed the recipe to a T, but fearing this would be too dry, I let the pork sit with the ingredients in the fridge for a few hours.  I think that made it a bit more tender.   I also basted every 20 minutes. Even with that, the pork is very flavourful but still a bit dry.  This definitely needs a side sauce.  I tried the cranberry, orange juice, brown sugar sauce (1 pt cran to 1/2 pt oj to 1/2 pt brown sugar) and heat that up. Made a great sweet sauce for garlicky pork.  Yum.

This was delicious.  I used fresh rosemary and thyme from the garden.  I subsituted 1/2cup of fresh apple cider mixed with a 1/2cup of balsamic vinegar for the apple cider vinegar.  I ended up adding more of this mixture part way through the cooking. I made a thin gravy by mixing the juices with beef broth and boiling it down.  Easy and tasty!

This was great.  We only used one bay leaf since we don't really care for it and cut up some onions and placed roast on top.  Took pan drippings added flour, a little milk and fresh sauted mushrooms for gravy.   Very Very good.  Thanks for the post.

I really enjoyed this roast.  I've been experimenting with pork roasts and this one is pretty good.  I followed another reviewer's suggestion and added 1/3c of the vinegar and then 1/3c of water.  It turned out well and made a very nice and tangy gravy.  Will make again.

I really tried to follow everyone's advice with adding water instead of some of the vinegar.  It didn't turn out well.  I felt so bad that I had to waste such a beautiful roast.  I liked the way it smelled when it was done, but wow was it sour tasting.  I love to cook with vinegar.  Try making Tangy Slow Cooker Pork Roast - it is delicious - a family favorite...

I actually wanted to give this recipe a 3, but I'll go with my husband's 4 because it really did turn out well. I just prefer more flavor. To me it was a very mild, almost bland tasting pork roast. I made it exactly according to the recipe and I think it will be better tonight chopped up with barbeque sauce for sandwiches. It wasn't dry at all, which was good. I also put baby carrots around the outside, which really tasted like the other ingredients. My kids wouldn't eat them but I liked the different flavor they took on. They were a little tangy. The meat really didn't take on the tang, though. Will try a different recipe next time.

I really loved this recipe.  It had an elegant flavor but was so simple!  I used an oven bag and added cut up turnips, carrots and celery (I also didn't trim the roast but cooked it fat side up).  It came out very moist and flavorful.  I was a little worried the veggies would taste too vinegary but they were great.  Thank you for sharing!

This was very delicious and the taste  was very simple.  Not too many ingredients to overpower the taste of the pork and the thyme.  I was a little concerned while it was cooking as the vinegar was taking over my kitchen and it was starting to burn my eyes but it turned out fantastic.  I served it with oven roasted vegetables with thyme and sage and it was a meal fit for a king I must say.

Excellent...Very tastey...I was very impressed with the flavor of this roast. So simple and easy and I also like the fact that all of the ingredients are always on hand , no need to go to the store.  I plan on making this roast for Easter this year. Thanks a bunch.

This was absolutley the best roast I have ever had.  The changes I made was that I rubbed olive oil all over and used a bit of fresh rosemary in addition to the thyme.  There wasn't enough juices to baste so I added a stick of butter and it also made a wonderful gravy!

I used a loin with this, and unfortunately, it turned out very dry. There was very little liquid to baste with. Next time, I will try it with a more "fatty" cut.

I tucked the garlic into little pockets I made with a knife.  Rubbed the salt and spices all over the meat.  Browned it all over in a little oil, added a pinch of rosemary, then pressure cooked it with the bay leaves and balsamic vinegar in the electric pressure cooker on high for 20 minutes, letting the pressure release naturally.  The vinegar was very mildly tangy.  Boy did it make the best sandwiches the next day!

This is a wonderful pork roast recipe!  I did not have apple cider vinegar, so I used red wine vinegar instead.  It gave it a wonderful flavor with the garlic and thyme.  Very juicy and tender.  I steamed some veggies and added them to the roast for the last 30 minutes of bake time and it was all wonderful! Thank you.

This was excellent, very flavorful and tender as well.  Have made this several times since finding the recipe.  Yes, it makes the house smell like vinegar, but it is well worth it.

This is really really good.  I used more thyme than the recipe called for.  I would reccomend turning on the exhaust fan as soon as you put this in.  Our whole house smelled like vinager for the first two hours of cooking time.  But it was worth it.

Easy, inexpensive, special for company and really delicious.  Some mentioned the meat was dry, and I think that is because you used a loin roast.  Loin is wonderful for butterflying or quick cooking, but has very little or no fat, and therefore can dry out.  Use butt roast if available.  The internal fat maintains the juiciness of the pork and is easily drained off the juice for gravy.  I let mine cook in the oven at 250 degrees for about 4 hours and couldn't be happier.  I did add water (didn't have apple juice or chicken broth at the time) and it was delicious.  I recommend this highly.  Bon Apetit

This is our favourite pork roast recipe. We just love it. It's never been dry. Moist, flavorful and the scents while cooking? Oh, my goodness! We've made this at least 10 times without a fail.

If you use a thermometer and bake to 145 internal temp, yes I said 145! it will be PERFECT, moist, tender and flavorful! I did several large roasts for a gathering. Took out and let rest for at least 15 min. before slicing. 45 people raved. What you don't understand is that the internal temp continues to rise after you take it out of the oven. Therefore if you bake to 160 it will continue to cook and be very dry and tough.

Fantastic!  This is a keeper.  Used fresh Thyme from my herb garden and red wine vinegar and keep a close eye on internal temp....it was moist, tender and amazing.  I whisked some Dijon style mustard into the juices and a few drops of lemon.  Perfect!

I found this recipe to be fair.  That said, I'm also a picky eater.  The other members of the household said it was good, but it's wasn't a rousing endorsement.  There was nothing wrong with this recipe, nothing that I would do differently, it just didn't strike me as super flavorful.  I think I'll stick with my other pork roast recipe for now.

Simply wonderful. As per another reviewer, I used 1/4 cup of balsamic and 15 oz. of beef broth.  The gravy was fabulous.  I also cooked in crock pot and it was extremely moist.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

I know there is a debate about whether or not this smelled bad while cooking.  I vote on the side of bad! When cooking, it has a really strong vinegar smell.  So much so, that I almost thought about scrapping the whole thing halfway through the cooking process. BUT I saw it through and I'm glad I did.  It tasted much better than it smelled.  I added rosemary to the seasonings. I sliced up onions to use as a "rack" then placed the bay leafs on the onion, followed by the pork. Also, the liquid kept drying up and I added 1/2 cup of water twice through the process. I only used a 2lb roast, so for anything bigger I would greatly increase the liquid.  I cooked to 150 and let it heat to 160 while it sat. Added flour to the drippings and made a gravy at the end, which was really good. The husband loved it!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was quite nice.  I'm not a pork fan, so it's hard for me to get excited, thus the four stars.  I followed the recipe to a T excepting cook time and I didn't have an oven bag, so I used a covered baking dish.  I added sliced onions at the very beginning with the plan to make my veggie side using the roast's juices.  I added carrots and mushrooms about 30 minutes into the process.  I started checking the meat temp after twenty minutes, basting every 10 minutes.  The meat reached 150 after about 50 minutes, so the carrots weren't quite done.  I took the roast out at 150, but had to leave the veggies in the dish for another 15 or so minutes (time demands).  The carrots ended up slightly crisp, which everyone liked, and the overall flavor of the veggies was a hit (juices from the roast/vinegar & spices).  On the whole, this was a decent meal - one that I would serve again - but it's not "wow."  Note:  I served this with the above mentioned veggies and yams.  They all went well together.

This was very tender & had a lot of flavor.  I used a 3 lb pork roast.  There wasn't enough sauce so I added an additional cup of apple cider vinegar with thyme & poured it over the pork about half way through cooking.  I also added about 4 oz of beer, light ale actually, to the bottom of the pan.  Don't know if this was necessary but it blended with the vinegard & thyme quite nicely.   Will definitely use this again.  Thanks

My girls could not stop eating this meat!  I found the au jus evaporated very quickly.  So, I used 2 cups turkey broth to baste the meat with.  So good!  Thanks!

I made this roast with a very good quality loin roast and it was quite good.  It could have been the lean cut of meat, but it was slightly dry.  I added water to the vinegar as many suggested, and the juices tasted excellent, so I'm glad I did.

Fantastic!  Used a boneless pork rib roast and it was sooo tender.  I would definately recommend using the meat thermometre rather than just judging by time.  Very nice flavor and made excellent left over sandwhiches as well.  Thanks for sharing.

I used pork tenderloin in this and it tasted okay, but I felt that it was missing something.  I might make it again, but add a different herb to it instead of the thyme see if we like it any better and then go from there.  Easy enough to make but not as amazing as I thought it would be after so many 5 star reviews.

Excellent, and easy, recipe.  My only problem was that the meat was underdone, though I used a thermometer.  Next time, I'll cook it a little longer.  This recipe makes my on-sale, dollar-a-pound pork roast taste like an expensive cut.  Thanks very much.

At the last minute, I discovered I didn't have cider vinegar, so I used a combination of apple juice and white vinegar.  (I see now after the fact that others have made the same substitution.) It still tasted delicious!  I can't wait to try it with the correct ingredients.  Oh, I also cooked the roast in foil for the first 2 to 2-1/2 hours and then uncovered to brown.

Amazing! This pork was very tender and moist! A big hit! Gave leftovers to mother-in-law. Big brownie points. I would use at least 5 or 6 garlic cloves and smoosh them before putting them in the roast. We love garlic in our home.
Using this again next week. Thanks.

This is a very good roast pork recipe. Keep an eye on it though, as my roast was done within a hour and a half and as a result it was a bit dry when company finally arrived. The smell as its cooking was not as bad as I feared based on other reviews. Good leftovers too!

My husband gave this roast five stars, but I gave it four because the drippings seemed to lack "something".  I will make it again and try one of the ideas that a previous reviewer suggests.  Thank you for the recipe!

This was my 1st pork.  I actually loved to aroma in the house of the cider but my husband said it was burning his eyes.  I thought it was a delious pork roast.  and for being my 1st, not bad at all.  I had a smaller roast so I cut down the cooking time, but in the end even my husband was pleased.  thanks

Wanted to try this but was skepitcal because of so many skeptics!  Decided to test it on a smaller 1 1/4 lb. pork tenderloin for just the 2 of us.  DELICIOUS!  Inserted the garlic slices, seasoned and then browned the pork in a lg. oven proof frying pan, mixed together about 4 tbls. cider vinegar and thyme, poured it over meat, put it in oven in the fry pan and baked until temp. read 165 (we like it slightly pink and it cooks after you take it out).  It took about 30 min. During that time I did add water as needed and was able to baste the meat with it since it deglazed the pan and picked up the bits from browning the meat. I will definitely now use this recipe on a large roast and am glad I found another quick recipe for a small pork tenderloin.  Thanks submitter.

Delicious.  The pork was juicy and delicious.  I used fresh thyme with the apple cider vinegar and a little bit of choppped red onion.  The pan drippings I added condensed french onion soup and added black pepper and flour to thicken.  Tasted great.

My family loved this.  I wasn't so sure with the vinegar smell, but sure enough, it was good.  I took someone's advice who tried the recipe previously and added rosemary as well.  Delicious!

okay, this is the first majority on this website that I've disagreed with... I just wasn't impressed with this; not much flavor (I followed the recipe exactly, with extra garlic), and the smell of vinegar was almost overpowering.  I had to make gravy for it to have much flavor at all. Definitely not a keeper. Sorry!

The vinegar in the recipe intrigued me.  Never thought to cook pork with vinegar.  I was out of apple cider vinegar so I decided to mix some apple juice with the white vinegar I had and added some of the fresh rosemary I had an abundance of.  It was simply delicious.  Will definitely do it again.  Will have to try the cider next time.

This is a GREAT recipe! The cider really tenderizes the meat and it comes out wonderful! I substituted beef a couple of times and it was just as good and added a little olive oil and beef stock to simmer with the roast. I also threw in some baby portobello mushrooms which came out kind of tangy and complimented the roast. GREAT!

I used a pork loin for this recipe. I was careful to only cook it to 145F internal temp. and it was nice and juicy. There were not enough pan drippings for basting, but it was still fine. Not the best ever, but has lots of flavor for how easy it is.

As some of the other reviews have said, it makes your house smell like vinegar for a while, but boy is it worth it.  This is an easy recipe and is very flavorful.

I've made this twice. Once with a pork loin and once with a pork butt roast.  It is a wonderful flavor and I received tons of compliments. I served it on New Year's with saurkraut and the other time with garlic mashed potatoes and broccoli.  Give it a try, it's easy and tasty.

It came out moist, tender and flavorful.  I loved the aroma of the cider vinegar in the house.  I am looking forward to trying this again, and possibly using a different cut.

It did not take anywhere near 3 hours for our 5lb. roast to reach 160!  In fact, it was in for just over 2 hours (at 325 degrees, as directed) and was a bit overdone.  Would do it again though-- easy with good flavor.

I, frankly, was a bit disappointed....and so was my spouse.  It does takes only a minute to prepare....but I was surprised the ratings were as high as they were, because I wasn't overwhelmed by the results (and I followed the recipe exactly)....oh well...guess you can't win them all!!!!!

This roast was so moist and easy to prepare that I will certainly make it often!  The cider vinegar sets it apart from other recipes and helps to keep the meat moist during cooking.  I didn't have garlic cloves so I just sprinkled garlic powder on the top.  Great!

Really quick and easy to make, and the taste is complex.  I was a bit sceptical with all that vinegar, but it really makes this recipe something else.  I added a few more bay leaves, used a bit of apple cider in the vinegar and complitmented the dish with homemade applesauce.

Like everyone else who has reviewed this recipe, I got raves at Christmas dinner.  Nice replacement for a tired turkey or ham dinner.  Very tasty.  I played with the amount of thyme and garlic a bit.  Thanks for sharing this one!

The flavor was nice, but (and it could be the fault of our stove or meat thermometer) doing the roast to an internal temperature of 160F resulted in it being a little underdone for our tastes.

This is fantastic!!  As others have said, I kept adding chicken broth and apple cider vinegar to the pan as it evaporated. The au jus was amazing! Don't skip it. Basted it often as well. I added caraway. USE MEAT THERMOMETER so it doesn't dry out. I removed it at 155/160 to let sit.    Next time (Oh yes, there will be many, many next times!) I may try it with tenderloin and shake it in a bag with spices and marinate, as suggested here.  Wow, thank you for sharing this. I think this would be great with chicken as well.

I seared the roast in a French oven coated with rosemary salt and pepper. Roasted at 325 for a few hours and then threw some potatoes in.

I used balsamic vinegar because of the comments that the vinegar was too strong. I like balsamic vinegar quite well and decided if it was too strong that was OK. Well, it wasn't too strong and it was delicious! I did have to shield my eyes the first few times I opened the oven to baste because the vinegar is strong up front, but toward the end I didn't have to. I cooked the 3 lb roast 1.5 hours on convection roast and it was perfect at 165 degrees.

I used fresh rosemary and fresh thyme rubbing the roast with both and placing in a bag for 1 hour before slitting and putting in the garlic. I simply poured the plain vinegar over the roast to begin. Additionally I used foil to make a pan within a pan making it easier to baste.

I served roasted zucchini and brown rice using the left over drippings on the rice. Delicious! My husband loved it and I will definitely make it again.

We really enjoyed this recipe!  The preparation was simple and it was cooking in the crock pot within minutes.  It was a last minute decision to make this so I had to make a few slight changes.  My roast was fresh out of the freezer, so I used the garlic press and spread the garlic on top of the roast.  I was a little shy of the total amount of apple cider vinegar so I used balsamic vinegar to make up the difference.  I put the crock pot on low & let it cook about 8 hours.  Delicious!  I used the juices to make gravy, adding some brown sugar to offset the twang of the vinegar.  This was an excellent, savory holiday dinner main dish.  The recipe is not something for every day, it is something I’ll use for special dinners. Thank you for sharing!

This is the first time I've made a pork roast in the oven and the family loved it!
I used a 3 lb roast, slivered an onion on the bottom of the roasting pan then placed the bay leaves on the onions and the roast on top. I only had 1/3 cup of cider vinegar so I topped it up to the 1/2 cup level with balsamic. Covered at 325 deg it was done in about an hour and a half (we're quite a ways above sea level here). After it was done, I wrapped it in foil to keep it warm and moist then made a gravy from the juice using some chicken stock and flour. After it was ready I sliced the roast and swirled it back in the roasting  pan before serving with mashed potatoes. Absolutely delumptious

My roast was very small, just over a pound and was done in  45 minutes. Because of the quicker cooking time it didn't brown, no fault of the recipe, so I put it on a baking sheet lined with foil, sprayed it with olive and put it under the broiler for a few minutes. Even though I was using a smaller roast I kept the ingredients the same except for the pepper, I cut that back to 1.2 tsp.  I love pork roast cooked with slices of garlic inserted into it but hubs doesn't so I made a paste with the seasonings and massaged that into roast and let it sit in the fridge for a few hours, taking it out one hour before I planned on cooking it. If I make this again I will sear it before roasting.

This was pretty good, although like others, mine did get a bit dry.  I put mine in the crock pot on low for about 7 hours.  I probably should have shredded it up a bit after 5 or 6 hours and let it finish cooking in the juices.  I think that would have helped it.  Otherwise I made as written and it was flavorful.  I didn't mind the vinegar at all.

So savory and pull-apart delicious! All I added to it was that I turned the meat juices into gravy with around 1/4 c. of teriyaki sauce. and 1/2 c. flour. Very satisfying recipe!

This was amazing and so tender,  I could have eaten the entire roast myself. I cooked it in the crock pot and when I started to smell the herbs (about 3 hours) I took the temperature, cooked for another hour on low and it  was perfect. I will definitely make this again!!! SO good!!!

I made this without the vinegar, and wrapped it in a foil packet before cooking.  Roasted at 300 instead of 325 as well.  The garlic flavor permeated nicely, and it was very tender (if not pull-apart-with-fork tender).  I would consider stuffing it with other things as a next step.

Made this with 4lbs (2 roasts at 2 lbs each) for Darla and the girls' visit in Oct 2013.  RAVE reviews, even from all of the kids!  Used re-hydrated minced garlic rather than fresh.  Went well with red beans, mashed pots, and apple crisp.

This was delicious! Of course, didn't have the cider vinegar - subbed balsamico - and took other reader's suggestion about adding the broth. I had two 2lb roasts and the total time was about 1 hr 15 mins. I have a slow oven so I bumped up the temp to 375. After I took the meat out, I scraped all the drippings into a pan & used it for a gravy base. Yum!

My favorite recipes are the ones it's impossible to screw up. For example, I forgot that my oven is antediluvian and cooks things about 100 degrees hotter than its setting, but this recipe STILL came out delicious. I also didn't notice that the vinegar I poured all over my roast had expired in 2009. Still came out delicious. I used minced garlic instead of slices, and I was worried that the flavor would be unevenly distributed. And yet Husband stopped shoving the meat into his mouth only long enough in between bites to moan about how amazing the roast had come out. 

Watch the cook time (as that fluctuates with most large cuts of meat,) baste periodically, and this dish will come out beautifully.

It was good but the flavor didn't soak in, making most of the meat tasteless.  Had to season on the plate...For some reason this didn't make good leftovers, either. But still liked it...so 3 stars.

I fixed this for our Thanksgiving dinner. I always dry out pork but this turned out moist and delicious.  Had many compliments!  The meat themometer said it was over cooked but it was just about perfect, don't know what happened there, it was a new themometer.  I will diffently use this recipe every time I make a pork roast. I used 13lbs for 20 people.

the recipe was good. i scaled it to 6 servings and it was done in 2hrs. i made the mistake of not basting it enough. You will double the vinegar mixture, I also tried the 1/2 balsamic and 1/2 rice vinegar.

What is wrong with me?  Everyone seemed to love this recipe.  All I can say is our house smelled like vinegar the whole time it was cooking.  When it was done (and three hours is way too long) I had to scramble to find a way to make the gravey something my family would eat.  And even though I marinated with the sauce through out the cooking process the roast was no more tender then normal.  Sorry Joe, I wanted to love it.  Maybe it's just me.

This had such a wonderful flavor.  I was afraid of the vinegar, but it was not overpowering at all.  Mixed well with the seasonings.  As read before, I needed to add a little water at the 2 hour mark as all the juice had evaporated.  Very moist and tasty.

I made this roast for Thanksgiving and it was DIVINE!  The pan drippings made an excellent gravy!  There was not much juice in the pan halfway through cooking so I added some extra water and vinegar a couple hours in. 

The meat was VERY tender and perfectly balanced with the seasonings.

My family LOVED it and I will definitely be making it again!  Thank you for sharing such a great recipe!

This recipe was great and easy to use. My family loved it. The roast was very tender and fell apart with a fork. I cooked vegetables with the roast for a delicious meal.

It is a good and easy recipe. But cooking time was different for me, may be my oven is not so good. So watch it closely! Other than that - good!!!!

The meat was moist. However: I did not care for the taste. Maybe too much bay leaf? I perfer a sweet pork roast! Sorry I will not make again.

Very good and easy. I substituted the vinegar with white wine vinegar combined with apple juice b/c I didn't have any apple cider vinegar on hand. Will make this one again.

This was great! My whole house smelled great and both my kids and my husband came home asking what was that wonderful smell. The roast was very tender and extremely flavorful. My husband doesn't like leftovers, but he asked to take it to work as a sandwich the next day.

My dh and son loved the tenderloin and they give it 5 *'s, but the flavor of the vinegar seemed to overpower the meat.  It was extremely tender and juicy.

This was the best pork roast I have ever eaten!  It smelled delicious and it didn’t have the vinegar smell others complained about.  I will definitely make it again.

I was skeptical when I tried this recipe. I am not a big meat-eater (I make a lot of vegetarian meals), I have never cooked any sort of roast, and I've never cooked pork for that matter. But I bought a pork roast on sale and decided to try this recipe. YEAH! It works and it is delicious and easy.  I just followed the instructions but put it in my crock pot on "LOW" for about 7 hours.  In addition to the ingredients, I added a cup of water and made sure that I turned the roast a few times in crock pot.  The meat just fell apart, was moist and delicious. I will make this recipe again!! (What a relief!!)

This was the first pork roast I have ever made it I was pleased with it, however it was a little dry.  I made it in a crockpot for about eight hours and added some rosemary as well.  I would make it again, but with a few changes to make sure it didn't end up so dry.

This was good, but I did overcook a little, was a little on the tough side.   Will likely make again.

Made this for my brother when he was out visiting.  The man ate like a "pig".  Needless to say, it was very good...it smelled good cooking...not like vinegar.  I've got one thawing right now and I'm making it again...this time in the crock pot!  Can't wait!  Thanks for sharing

Excellent recipe!  The house did smell like vinegar for a while but it was worth it.  I didn't read the part about cutting the garlic into slivers so I put my garlic in the cuts as whole cloves.  Still tasted great and was less work.

My family loved it for our Christmas dinner.  It was very easy.  I didn't have any cloves of garlic so I used the minced garlic in a jar. I just shoved it down in the holes and it worked out great!
