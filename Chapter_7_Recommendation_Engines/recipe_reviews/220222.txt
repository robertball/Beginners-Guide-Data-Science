Slight modifications - did not have exact cheeses so used cheddar jack in place of Monterrey jack and provolone in place of Swiss. Turned out great!

This is delicious. I used all cheddar cheese because that's what I had in the frig and I didn't use mushrooms because my husband doesn't like them but I don't think you can mess this up. It's a very good recipe.

This was FANTASTIC! I used thin asparagus fat-free half-and-half and a frozen un-thawed pie crust. Delicious and beautiful. The tweens ate it with ZERO complaints (or compliments to be honest. But who cares right? They ate it!)

I will start off by saying this is an extremely good pie but there are a couple of problems with this recipe. One it's not very quiche-like. The middle isn't firm it's actually kind of watery. I think it was all the extra fluid from the asparagus and the mushrooms. Despite 5 eggs it's not very eggy? I would put this more in the realm of a pot pie than a quiche. Two the asparagus makes it hard to cut without having the filling fall out everywhere. This could be remedied by peeling the stems but next time I will just dice them because I like the extra fiber. Three this recipe is a little salty what with all the cheese. I may leave the salt out entirely next time. I did make a few modifications. I left out the Monterrey Jack because this recipe was already insanely calorie dense and I figured one type of cheese would be enough. I'm glad I did because of the saltiness. I also left out the rotisserie chicken instead using two chicken breasts cooked in just lemon juice and green onions for filling. This made it nicely tart which complimented the asparagus and cheese flavor. Overall I would definitely make this again. It is a really good pie even if it's not a quiche.

I used this recipe as a basis since it was basically what I wanted. Since a lot of reviewers said it was too salty I didn't use salt at all. I also didn't use the herbs listed...I just used the "Salad Elegance" spice mix from Penzey's since I didn't have parsley. I also made it as individual tartlets rather than a large pie. (The filling (asparagus plus chicken cheese mix) would have easily made 6 - 7 tarts but the egg mixture ran out at four. I'll mix up another batch of eggs to use with the remaining filling. ) Tartlets still took about 40 minutes to cook so I imagine a larger quiche would have taken even longer to firm up. But it was VERY GOOD!

Love the chicken in the quiche but overall not enough flavor to balance the asparagus with the chicken.

Attention: the recipe calls for way too much filling I actually attempted to stuff it all into one pie crust (9" deep dish) and it made a huge mess because about 2 1/2 eggs spilled either on the floor on the way to the oven or in the oven itself. So I would suggest cutting the recipe down to at least 3/4. Also it did not cook all the way through in the time indicated. Other than that the recipe is tasty! And I will try it again.

Great recipe but a bit too salty (will cut amount in half next time possibly because rotisserie chicken had a lot of flavor). Chicken tastes great in this dish! Subbed mozzarella since didn't have swiss. The asparagus steamed at 4 minutes was perfect (the ones on put on top were too crunchy after baked however (will skip that next time). Overall it was a really good breakfast family was really happy!

Loved it perfect brunch/lunch hostessing food. Instead of rotesserie chicken I used 2 baked chicken thighs and some red tobasco sauce instead of the mild green. It was perfect????

This quiche is very good. I used a conglomeration of cheeses and substituted asparagus for green beans based off of what I had in the refrigerator. With those changes it was still yummy. I'll definitely make it again.

I made a few changes: I didn't have a pie crust and heard from other reviews that it runs over so I used a buttered casserole dish instead. I had to cook longer b/c it was deeper next time I'll use a bigger pan. also sautéed the asparagus with garlic for about 5 minutes before adding to the pan. I used grape tomatoes sliced in half all throughout instead of just on top. I only had cheddar and reserved some of the cheese for the top.next time I'll try the other cheeses. I also sprinkled shredded Parmesan cheese on top. Great dish for a pot luck.

Great recipe! Followed the recipe except used mozzarella instead of the Jack cheese and a can of chicken to save time. It did make a good deal of chicken and asparagus so because I used frozen crust I divided the chicken and asparagus mix into two shells. I made a second egg mixture and it fit perfectly. I now have one to freeze for later. It was not at all watery and the veggies were tender. Will definitely be using this recipe again!

One of my favorite recipes in a long time! I make quiche on a regular basis, but I have repeated this recipe several times in the last month since first finding it. Note: today I decided to add just a hint of fresh basil chopped up in addition to recipe. I also don’t keep Tabasco, so I use a pinch of cayenne powder as substitute. And I always add Trader Joe’s 21 Seasoning Salute when I am mixing eggs for any quiche. I love it because this dish easily freezes. I cut in single size servings and reheat as needed since it’s just me.

This is a very good recipe.  I used rachlette instead of Swiss and blue cheese in place of the Monterey Jack, because that is what I had.  I also make my quiches in a springform pan so they are easier to serve.  I will definitely make again.

Great basic quiche recipe that could be altered by using different meat or veggies or even different cheese. I did use ham instead of chicken and some cheddar and more monterey jack because that is what I had on hand. I also did not bake it in a crust but made it so that it would make its own crust by adding just a little more flour than the recipe called for. It was a big hit!

I followed the recipe as written and it was a great spring supper. I only had one issue. I used a 9" store bought frozen pie shell. It may hold less than a homemade crust. I had enough filling for two shells but tried to mound it up and drizzle the egg mix over and around. Not a good plan. The excess egg ran over te edges and the quiche turned out more like a casserole rather than a quiche. Next time I use half t the chicken mushrooms and asparagus or plan on filling two pie shells.

There was way too much filling for a 9" pie plate. I ended up using a deep dish plate instead. It was a bit bland for my taste. The family complimented but didn't ask for more so there are left overs. Oh well. You can't win them all.

I changed the recipe to fit my family's needs. All ingredients were added except I didn't use a pie crust or chicken with mine. I used a little more flour about a cup of cherry tomatoes quartered and 3 more eggs though. I layered the same as instructed but used a 13x9 sprayed with cooking spray. I really like the changes I had to make to the original.

Had all ingredients except pie crust and it was good even without the pie crust.
