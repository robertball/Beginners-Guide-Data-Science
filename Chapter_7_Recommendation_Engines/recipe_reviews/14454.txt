Great salad.  Would have never thought to mix all these ingredients together to create something this good.  Don't like Spinach, and I'm not crazy about mango, but I gave it a chance and found it to be very interesting and delicious.  I was afraid this would become a bland mess of stuff mixed together, but was amazed how you can taste each and every ingredient separately and yet each one goes so well together with the others...  

Will be making this again SOON! A

Fantastic! The dressing makes this salad zing, and it really improves if you can make it at least a few hours ahead of time.  It's punch comes from the combination of pepper and mango-- I recommend using only white pepper, as it's intense bite is a nicer compliment to the mango.  Yet, if you only have black pepper, you will  still create a great tasting salad.  We enjoy this with Seared Scallops with Spicy Papaya Sauce (found on allrecipes.com)

While I liked everything together the dressing was very tart, not necessarily a bad thing.  I used raspberry champagne vinegar as I didn't realize I was out of white wine vinegar.  I will reduce vinegar by at least half and up the sugar a tad next time which will still make enough dressing for this amount of salad.

I doubled the amount of everything except the spinach and fed 5 for lunch.  We had plenty of leftovers.  Mango was a delightful addition.  The dressing was very tart and I added about 1/8 c of sugar.  I would add more next time.  Husband and company loved the salad.  I will make it again.  It was great with soup and sourdough rolls on a cold day!

Really great presentation!  Left out the avocado, and my wife vetoed the dressing after tasting it.  We used a bottled light raspberry vinegarette instead.  I was concerned it might be too sweet, but the salad got raves.

I bought a bigger salad bowl so that I could make this salad again.  I love the combination of mango and avocado - it tastes great and looks very colourful.

This salad was really good, although it definately had way too much vinegar in it! Next time I'll cut the vinegar in half and add pine nuts for crunch. Definately very good and I will make again. Thank you!

A nice salad.  I left out the tomatoes as I didn't like the idea of mangoes and tomatoes together.  I found the dressing a little on the bland side, I would probably use a balsamic vinegar dressing next time.

I just had to add some cheese.  I thought it needed just a little bit more flavor contrast.  Feta this time but I think blue Cheese would be better.....

I didn't even need the vinagrette since the mango and avocado were older and kinda mushy. Delish.

I really liked this salad with Seared Scallops with Spicy Papaya Sauce. Only changes I made were to substitute rice wine vinegar, and omit the mushrooms - somehow I could not stomach the idea of mushrooms with mango and avocado! Different and delicious, will make again!

I made a small change based on the reviews that didn't like the strength of the vinaigrette.  I made it with rice wine vinegar, and used a little less than is called for in the recipe (2T less).  No other changes, and the salad was DELICIOUS.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This salad was nice, but the dressing was awful.  It tasted like pure vinegar and overpowered everything.  I was disappointed in this recipe.

I like all the ingredients in the salad, but I kept the dressing in a separate container, and it had congealed by the 2nd day!  There was no saving it.  Not sure what I did wrong.

My husband first made this for me for Valentine's Day a few years ago.  We love it!  It's great to take to potlucks or to a friends house for dinner.  Everyone's always excited by all the colorful ingredients.

This salad will definitely make you ooohh and ahhh. It makes your taste buds dance and wish you were on a tropical island enjoying the sun. My husband and I went to Cancun for our honeymoon. I wanted to bring back memories of that time for a Valentine dinner. It certainly did the job. Absolutely wonderful salad! The only thing I would change is to lower the amount of onion.

This is a good salad on the day you make it, but the next day the flavors of the onion were too strong and I didn't like it quite as much. I think it's a great salad when you have company and will probably make it again.

An amazing combination that was amazingly successful.  I did use only half the spinach.  And then had to cut way back on the vinegar for health reasons - I used 2T. of the oil with only 2T. vinegar plus 3T. water and it was just sharp enough for us. I'm sure it would have been just as good with all the spinach. - nanonline

Beautiful presentation and very flavorful! I used seasoned rice vinegar just because that is what I had and about 1/2 Tablespoon of sugar. It makes a huge amount of salad. Next time I will chop the ingredients smaller just so it is easier to eat and I think it will allow the flavors to marry well.

I loved this salad!  I took the previous reviewer suggestion and used white pepper.  I loved the proportion of vinegar to oil.  With this in mind I served this salad with Dorsey's Fried Oysters (on this site).  It was absolutely perfect.  Plan on making this salad tomorrow again.  A great combination of flavors and beautiful too.

This is great-the mango and avocado together make a nice blend of flavors.
