Don't be afraid to use more than just a pinch of the oregano and going heavy on the salt and pepper.  I love the sweetness of the apple with the kale.  I almost wanted to add just a little bit of honey to the dressing.  I'll play around with the dressing because I will have this again tonight with my dinner.  Thanks, Her Royal Highness!

With my garden overflowing with self seeded kale and cilantro this was the perfect salad to use them up. Quite tasty and refreshing. After reading the review that mentioned adding honey, I decided to add a dash of agave syrup. Very good and I will definitely make it again

It was a very delicious salad.  I did add honey to the dressing which mellowed out the dressing a bit.  It is still good as left over the next day even with the dressing added.

I took a bite and said to my husband, "This is the BEST kale salad I've ever made!"--trying to get more calcium in my diet and I love kale, so I feel pretty savvy in the kale salad dept!  I made it exactly, and then added a bit more to make it even more delish and healthy; added roasted beets and grilled tofu.  So good that the next day I ate it for breakfast!
