This is basically our standard green bean casserole recipe with some minor modifications I've made over the years.  It's ALWAYS the first to disappear at potlucks when there are other versions of green bean casseroles and people often ask why it seems to taste so much better than the original one on the French's can.  I always use French-cut green beans, add a (drained) can of sliced water chestnuts (coarsely chopped) and stir 3 ounces of the French fried onions into the casserole along with ALL of the cheddar cheese.  Heating the ingredients in the microwave is really an unnecessary step.  Bake in a flat casserole dish 30-35 minutes or until hot in the center.  Then sprinkle the other 3 ounces of French fried onions over the top and bake 5 minutes more.  We much prefer the cheese stirred INTO the casserole and NOT put on top.  When doubling the recipe, using one can of water chestnuts works fine since a whole can is almost too much (but we like the crunch!) for a single recipe, depending on personal taste.   If I'm trying to extend the number of servings for a double recipe then I generally use 2 cans of water chestnuts for that.  A tried and true yummy favorite of many – thanks, Jan!

Green bean casseroles aren't my favorite vegetable casseroles to make, but as far as they go, this one is great! Instead of microwaving I put everything in the casserole (minus 1/2 c cheese and the fried onions) at 350 for 20 minutes, sprinkled on the rest of the cheese and the onions, then baked for about 7 minutes more. Quick and easy.

This was pretty good and will probably be my go-to green bean casserole recipe from now on. I did make a few changes right off the bat based on the reviews of others and it turned out great.

Here's what I did:
- Use french green beans instead of cut
- Skip microwaving ingredients
- Instead, mix everything together (beans, soup, ALL of cheese, and half of french fried onions) in a casserole dish
- Bake for 30-35 minutes at 350 until hot in the middle
- Add more french fried onions on top of casserole
- Bake for another 5-10 minutes until onions are browned.

These changes made it great! I will definitely make this one again. Very easy to throw together if you have all the ingredients so a great little casserole for weeknights.

I followed Memphisbelles advice and made with cannned french cut green beans, didn't microwave and mixed in the cheese and onions (didn't add the water chestnuts) but did add some real bacon bits. Double the recipe if you need a 13X9 size. They were licking the pan clean at the party I took it to...I love when I'm asked for the recipe...thanks.

Talk about kicking it up a notch!   Jan, this was a perfect example of how small changes can make a BIG difference.  This was so good, that my family asked me to make it AGAIN the day after Christmas!  And the reviewer who questioned that this was a recipe?  Any time you combine two or more ingredients, it's a recipe!   And an awesome one this was.... thanks for sharing.

This is the third time I've made it; and we've gotten awesome reviews.  The bowl is always cleaned out.  I've preassembled this the night before and taken out an hour before to sit at room temperature and then cooked as described.  Awesome and easy!!!

Made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. I used fresh, yellow and green, beans for color (if you use fresh, microwave beans for about 5-7 min on high before adding other ing.) and mixed everything all together(including about 1/2 of the fried onions) except a little cheese which I set aside, to add to the top before baking. I also mixed the cheddar cheese with about 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese before adding to the top. I didn't add the remaining onions until right before serving, to keep them crunchy and it was delish!
REMINDER: Do not add milk to soup before using. I am sure that is why some people complained about it being "runny"

Excellent !!  I too followed other reviewers suggestions - mixed all the cheese and 3oz of the french fried onions with the soup and beans...added about 1/2 can loosely chopped water chestnuts...a couple shots/splashes soy sauce...heavy sprinkle garlic powder and about 1/4 tsp black pepper - baked at 350 for about 25 minutes..then added the remainder of the french fried onions to the top and back in the oven for about 12 more minutes - Turned out to be the best green bean casserole ever !!

Make it two weeks in advance to save time on Thanksgiving (or any occasion)!!  I made only a few modifications to this already wonderful recipe.  I doubled the recipe (we always want leftovers!) and added one extra can of cream soup (I used two cans of cream of mushroom and one can of cream of celery).  I also added 2 teaspoons of garlic powder and some salt and pepper to taste (otherwise it can be rather bland).  I used a Mexican blend of shredded cheeses (actually, any cheese blend that includes cheddar would be fine), and I mixed the cheese right in with the rest of the ingredients.  I also added one small can of water chestnuts, chopped up into small pieces, to add some crunch.  I mixed up all the ingredients (except for the final can of onions that is used for the topping), transferred it to a greased 9x13 glass casserole dish, covered it tightly with plastic wrap, and froze it (unbaked, of course) two weeks before Thanksgiving. One day before I want to bake it, I move it from the freezer to the fridge to thaw.  Two hours before baking, I take it out and set it on the counter (still covered) to allow it to come to room temperature.  Bake at 350 degrees until hot (I actually stir it about halfway through the baking time, just to help with even heating).  If you double the recipe, like me, you might need to add 10-15 minutes to the baking time...just check it every 15 minutes to see how it's coming along.  Add the onion topping for the final 5 minutes.  Delicious and easy!

I love green bean casserole, but I never thought of putting cheese in it before. Why, I don't know because cheese makes everything better! :) I mixed all of my cheese and half of the onions into the green bean mixture. I didn't bother with warming it in the microwave. I took the suggestion of another reviewer and added a can of water chestnuts (something else I never would have thought to do, but was such a yummy addition, I will do it that way from now on!), sprinkled it with a little salt. Baked it for about 35 minutes, then topped it with the rest of the onions,  and broiled it for 5 minutes. This was very good, and got a lot of compliments, including from my mother who typically does not like green bean casserole, but she LOVED this! I can see this with the additions of mushrooms, or bacon crumbles, maybe just a little splash of soy sauce. Mmmm.

This was okay. Definitely needs some salt. I'll probably omit the cheese next time, or at the very least, not put any on top. It made the onions  chewy instead of crunchy.

This recipe is great on its own, so by me suggesting my additions, it is still worthy of 5 stars without them...I feel the need to mention this because I know a lot of people don't like when you rate something after changing it up.  But if you want to make it a little more "gourmet" try adding the following to taste:  black pepper, garlic powder, crushed red pepper, pinch of dried thyme, dried parsley flakes, a dash of soy sauce, and about two tablespoons of sour cream.  I don't put the cheese on top because it tends to make the dried onions chewy, but that is just personal preference, most people will not complain about extra cheese!  The definite keys to this recipe, whether altered or not, is the addition of the cheese to the mixture and no milk or any other liquid, keep it thick and you are pretty much guaranteed to not have a runny casserole.  I also do not microwave it prior to baking, I just mix it all up and put it in the oven, I find it stays thicker this way.  Definitely one of the better green bean casserole recipes I've come across.

I made this as one of my side dishes for Thanksgiving.  It was WONDERFUL and turned out to be a big hit with my guests (most of them don't usually like green bean casserole)...I did add more cheese than it called for, and lightly added some onion powder and a dash of salt and pepper to the mix before I topped it with the fried onions.  I am definitely going to keep this as 'my' green bean casserole recipe!!!  I must confess that it is just as good (if not better) the next day...when I got it out of the fridge the day after Thanksgiving, I was eating it before I re-heated it...it was great cold!!! :)

i would have given it 5 stars had it used fresh green beans.  just use fresh and steam them until almost tender, and the recipe comes out much better.  you don't end up with that canned bean taste which i hate.  also, adding some crunchy bacon bits adds to the flavor.

Totally delicious, and super easy to prepare. I went a little heavy on the cheese and stirred in some of the french fried onions because that's how I roll, but this is a classic recipe that is great even as leftovers!

Really good recipe, but I find canned green beans to be far too mushy, so I thawed two packages of frozen green beans. The microwave step is not really necessary, but may help if you're in a time crunch.   I mixed the cheddar cheese in with the soup instead of putting it on top and all I had to do was add about 20 minutes to the cooking time in the oven.  Turned out perfect!

The cheese makes all the difference. I cooked it at 350 for 25 minutes and then topped with 3 oz of Frenchs fried onions, cooking for an additional 5 minutes. DELICIOUS! No microwaving needed

I microwaved the soup and 3/4 cup of the cheese together and added 1 tbsp of Worcestershire sauce (although I think soy sauce would have been better).  Then per other reviewers' suggestions I added 4 ounces of the french fried onions and mixed this all together with 2 cans of french cut green beans.  I placed the remaining cheese and onions on top and baked approximately 20 minutes.  Green bean casserole has never been my favorite but this recipe was very good- thanks for sharing Jan!

I chose to do this recipe following MemphisBelle's suggestions: add all of the cheese (grated a little extra for the top since I'm a serious cheese lover), added water chestnuts, added 1/2 of the onions to bean mix, omitted microwave step and just baked longer.  I was not disappointed.  Even the folks who "don't eat onions" ate it and liked it! I'm keeping it!

Giving a 4 only because I used the alterations from another reviewer...this way is for sure a 5!  Skip the microwave, use canned french cut green beans, add 1 can sliced water chestnuts (I sliced the slices in to 1/3's and 1 can of water chestnuts is ok for a single or double batch) combine all ingredients in a casserole dish except for 1/2 the onions and mix well.  Bake at 350 about 30 minutes, add the rest of the onions on top and bake 5 minutes more.  Brought it to Thanksgiving this year and everyone loved it!  Warmed up the very little bit of what was left over in the microwave and it was just as good as before, if not a bit better.

Made this a year ago to bring to my in-laws for Thanksgiving - was absolutely awesome! I used whole frozen green beans.  If you use frozen beans, I recommend defrosting/heating them first in order to more easily mix in the soup and cheese.  Then I just popped it all in the oven.

Used french style green beans, mixed in ALL of the shredded cheese and 3 oz. french fried onions with the green beans Sprinkle generously with garlic salt. No need to heat anything in microwave, just mix and bake. Bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes uncovered, then add the french onions on top and cook for another 5 minutes. Delicious!!

Love this recipe .... made it for Thyanksgiving this year & everyone loved.  It has been requested that I make it again for Christmas dinner.  I mixed the cheese in with the beans while cooking instead of putting the cheese on top.  It turned out great!!  YUM-O!!!!

I made this in a microwave-safe casserole dish from start to finish. I've made it 3 times and the time it took in my microwave varied anywhere from 7 to 10 min.  This is BEST green bean casserole I've ever had!

This recipe was a big hit at my family's Thanksgiving dinner. However, I used the roasted garlic variety cream of mushroom soup. It gave it a really good flavor.

Very tasty and very easy to make.  I used a recommendation from a previous review and included water chestnuts.  Took to a church dinner and it was the first to disappear.

This is the best green bean casserole my family has ever had.  The cheese is a definate plus.  Very simple and great tasting is always an A-plus on my list.  I use more soup, another 1/2 can to make it creamier.  YUM!

I've never in my whole life had greenbean casserole - it just was never something that my family enjoyed. I really liked this recipe. Next time I might play with the recipe a bit to give it a little more flavor (tasted like it was missing something). What a quick recipe!!!

Either it was the fresh picked green beans that I used or "Cream of Mushroom Soup I" that I substituted for the canned stuff, but this recipe rocked my socks off! I was skeptical and thought, "Ok. I need a green bean casserole. I guess this one will do for my mock Thanksgiving dinner." Boy was I wrong. So good I came back for seconds. For my mock Thanksgiving dinner, I served this dish, "Slow Cooker Thanksgiving Turkey," homemade turkey gravy from the drippings, carrots, and "Awesome Sausage, Apple and Cranberry Stuffing."

WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL??
People posted 5 stars and raved about this recipe and I'm going, "Huh?"
I just needed a very simple, quick and easy green bean dish so I went with this. It was, well, green beans.
I wouldn't call this a "recipe" though.

I had never even tasted green bean casserole before but figured it must be good since everyone else eats it. Well I hated it, and so did my son. The taste was horrible. I don't blame the recipe, I just didn't like it.

Another great dish served for Thanksgiving!  I used 2 cans of French fried onions as I wanted to have enough to add more crunch on top once everything was done.  My daughter loved it as her favorite and requested it more than once a year!  Thanks for sharing!  :)

This is a good basic recipe.  Like other reviewers, I add 1 cup of shredded cheese to the mixture, a 1/2 can of chopped water chestnuts, about a tablespoon of soy sauce, and half of the FF onions to the mix.  EXCELLENT!!

I couldn't figure out why this recipe missed the mark for me. I realized later that the traditional recipe from Cambells has soy sauce in it. I think this recipe would be perfect with the addition of that ingredient.

This is now my famous green bean casserole around my family. I am always asked to bring this. I used french style beans, also mixed in 1/2 of the fried onions, and  mixed in all the cheese to the mixture like a reviewer suggested. It was perfect. Thank you!

I found frozen green beans to be much less mushy.  If you unthaw and squeeze the water out of the green beans, this dish turns out great.  Thanks for the base recipe.

I love this recipe too! My only suggestion, use either fresh or frozen green beans. The canned ones have an aweful brownish appearance and aren't as healthy....they also taste too salty.

This is definitely a case of bury it under enough fat and salt and they'll eat anything. No one in our house likes green beans, but they all ate this. Not at all healthy, but it did get them to choke down the beans in order to get the cheese, creamy soups, and fried onions.

Very good.  I used frozen green beans and found it needed a little longer time in the oven - about 15 - 20 minutes.  Really yummy though.  I found the onions stayed nice and crunchy.

Sorry about the poor rating, but I had 8 children in my house (Ages 1 1/2 TO 12) and not one of the kids liked this recipe. Will not be making this again.

This is a wonderful recipe!  I just made it for Christmas dinner.  I am so surprised that something so easy, with few ingredients, could be so good!  Fabulous!  I guess keeping it simple works!  Thank you:-)

Tasted very bland and boring. I’d call this slumming it in the kitchen food.

Hubby and I both love this one and it is sooo easy. I cut out a couple of the steps by just mixing the soup, green beans, and cheese together at once, warm in the microwave for a couple minutes and then go on with the rest. I also love this with Campbell's Roasted Garlic Cream of Mushroom; it adds another layer of flavor. Delicious!

Awesome! I made a few minor modifications based on personal preference. I used 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup, and added some sauteed onions. It was great and I'll definitely be making this again. Hubby said it was the best he has ever had!

I followed this receipe perfect, but it seemed runny. I wasnt impressed with the cheese added. I think I will stick with the regular way. However, my family loved it! Even though they mentioned I put to much soup because it was runny. And I didn't! I followed it to the T! It did hardened up the next day for leftovers and tasted better. I don't think I will try this again!!

I tried making Green Bean Casserole before I discovered this recipe and I hated it. I decided to give it another try using this recipe and I LOVE IT and so does my family. It's not a mandatory dish every Thanksgiving and Christmas.

I'm not a green bean casserole professional, but to me this recipe was like eating  straight cream of mushroom out with mushy bits in it. I had to add chicken and potatoes to it, which really helped out, but that wouldn't be a green bean casserole, haha. I will probably make my green bean, chicken, potato casserole again though!

This really is the best green bean casserole especially if you follow memphisbelle's instructions. Use french style green beans and mix  everything together including half of the fried onions and pour in a casserole dish. No need to microwave anything. Bake 30 minutes and then top with the rest of the fried onions and bake 5 more minutes. Turns out perfect every time and couldn't be easier. I also add a jar of pimento strips into the mix for color and extra flavor. This is a big hit at my house.

It's just the same green bean casserole most people make but with cheese on top.    Add to the soup a splash of milk, generous black pepper and a splash of worcestershire and all is well.     It definitely needs those add-ins for a little more oomph in my very humble opinion.

Excellent recipe! I took some of the suggestions from other commenters, and added half the french fried onions and all of the shredded cheese to the mixture. I didn't microwave, but baked in oven until hot, and then added the remaining onions on top before broiling to brown them.  I made double the recipe, using frozen green beans from my garden in a 9x13 baking dish. Excellent! Thank you!

Loved this recipe. Perfect combination of simple and tasty. We used Del Monte French cut green beans seasoned with Garli Garni and Lemon Pepper, and added some bacon crumbles to the mix. It disappeared quickly at the Christmas party.

I always add cheese to our green bean casseroles now! And I like to add black pepper and a splash of soy sauce. I really don't think I could ever enjoy a green bean casserole w/out cheese now...Thanks for sharing this simple yet wonderful addition!

LOVED IT! It was my first time making it and it sure was a hit. I followed someone else's review and added in a can of sliced water chestnuts. I ended up chopping them up more because the slices are too big. I also ended up doubling the recipe and mixing the french cut and regular cut since I was out of french. They worked well together! I didn't heat in microwave either, which seems to be an unnecessary step. I placed it all in a 8x11 glass baking dish. Awesome dish!

I must admit that I actually didn't have very high hopes for this recipe. I honestly thought that since it only has 4 ingredients it would be too "plain", but I was pleasently surprised. Everyone loved it! I didn't microwave any of the ingredients first- just mixed it together and threw it in the oven. So simple and so good!

I have never been much of a green bean casserole person and I love this!! I mixed my cheese in and also some of the onions instead of adding salt to taste. Everyone loved it!! So easy to make!!

This was really good. The cheese in the green beans made it really rich, but next time I will put all of the cheese in it and not on top. Definitly a keeper though!

Pretty good but I used fresh green beans. I boiled the beans for just a couple of minutes and then mixed the soup with the beans in the casserole dish. i mixed bread crumbs with cheddar cheese in a bowl and then sprinkled it on top.

This green bean casserole was good but I felt as if it was missing something.  I would suggest adding an onion and a little bit of garlic to give it a little more taste.  Otherwise, this is a great starter recipe!

Holy cow, this was excellent.  Very easy to prepare.  I just made it for Thanksgiving dinner and it was a hit.  I did double the recipe for our family of 5, and it was WAY more than enough.  Lots of leftovers..  Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe was very good.  I added some crumbled bacon to the dish and everyone gobbled it up at Easter Dinner.  I am making it again tonight for my hubby and me.  This is a recipe I'll make often.

Good recipe, it was all eaten at our family get-together.  The Onions on top were soggy and I would prefer them to be crunchy, so I would reserve 1/2 to add at the end.  I added a can of mushrooms, which was good.

I only had 1 can of green beans, so I added 1 small can mushroom pieces and 12 sliced black olives to the mix.  I tossed in 12 tsp of black pepper as well.  A hit!

I made this last Thanksgiving and my family really enjoyed it and asked that I make it again this year.  However, I used fresh green beans instead of canned.  It's very easy and quick to make.

The addition of cheese really elevates this classic recipe.  After reading reviews, here's what I did with GREAT results:   2 cans cut green beans, 1 can french style (don't know why I like the combination, just do), 1 can soup, 1 cup cheese (I like a mix of 2/3c Mexican + 1/3c Colby Jack, all of it IN the casserole), couple dashes low-sodium soy sauce, 6-8 grinds fresh black pepper, 3 pinches garlic powder, 3 pinches dried thyme, and 3/4c fried onions.  Mix, pour into baking dish and bake 30-35 mins.  Then add more fried onions on top but no cheese.  (I love a cheesy casserole but more really isn't needed here.  If you ARE going to add cheese on top, do it *before* the fried onions.)  I did not use the whole 6oz can of onions.  Baked an add'l  5-7 mins to lightly brown the onions.  Everyone loved it!  And so easy to make.

Made it with fresh green beans instead of canned beans and I did not microwave them. Steamed the beans until al dente then added and mixed in the soup and cheese.  Not one bean was left over.

It was so delicious. I didn't grow up with this traditional dish on the table for family events.  I thought to serve it last Thanksgiving for my brother, and we both agreed, it should be a "new" staple of family dishes.

This is comfort food for me, as my family has had this one on speed-dial my entire life. It's a safe bet with everyone due to its bland nature. 
I've taken a few liberties at dressing it up by toasting 1/3rd of the onions ahead of time and using them in the bottom of my dish, after buttering it. This adds a nice texture and helps hold the form of the casserole. I also use Sharp cheddar and Asiago mixed in with a splash of moz for the creaminess.

Cheers!

My family loved this!!! I used a corning casserole bowl for keeping to one dish. I added a dash of garlic powder and about a quarter of an onion, diced tiny, to the gr bean/soup mixture. I thin layered on top: cheese, fried onion, cheese, then another fried onion layer. Nice crunchy top, rich creamy taste. So very easy to make last minute  using microwave until time to brown the top in the oven, which i did using stored heat from cooking earlier dishes.

I used the changes that memphisbelle mentioned, minus the water chestnuts, and I loved this version. On Thanksgiving, I am going to add the water chestnuts and I would recommend a m ild cheddar cheese. I used sharp and it was a bit too much.  I still gave it 5 stars because it was that good.

It was very good and very tasty.  Easy to put together and worth the wait.  Used to have this recipe, but lost it over the years.  Thanks for giving it back to me.

I made this to recipe. You can't find a much easier side dish.  I made it for a last minute covered dish, family gathering and everyone loved it.  My wife said that she was not normally a fan of green bean casserole but she gave this one a thumbs up.

I made it with the canned French cut beans and it wasn't good.   The French cut beans get lost in the cheese and soup.   I really  don't like the canned beans either.  I will take the extra time and use fresh  green beans.

I made my own French onions at home by letting some onion rings soak in milk and then coating them in flour before frying. I also added my regular seasonings such a seasoning salt, onion powder, garlic powder, and pepper to the green bean mixture. Came out great and I will for sure be making it again

I make green bean casserole every year for our Thanksgiving meal, but this year I switched to this recipe and it was the BEST green bean casserole we have ever had.  Even my husband who is not a huge fan of green bean casserole said he enjoyed this recipe.  I put the onions on top of the cheese and they were crispy, brown and delicious.

Thought maybe this would be better than your average green bean casserole, but it's just as disgusting as the regular one.

I've made this yummy dish a handful of times in fact I'm making it as I type this lol anyway my recipe is very similar to this one except with a few minor changes I use:
2 (14oz) cans of del monte fresh cut green beans
3 slices of chopped Canadian bacon (aka ham) or 3 crumbled pieces of low sodium bacon (to make it heartier)
1 can(10oz) of Campbell's mushroom soup
1(8oz) can of mushrooms
1/2 cup cheddar cheese 
1/2 cup mozzarella cheese (for topping)
 1/2 cup milk
4 oz french fried onions divided

Toss the greenbeans,chopped Canadian Bacon/Low sodium bacon,mushroom soup,can of mushrooms, 1/2 cup cheddar cheese,1/2 milk, & 2 oz french fried onions together in a 9in circular pan bake at 350 for 25 mins add mozzarella cheese& remaining french fried onions & bake 5 more mins :)
It turns out delicious. my boyfriend loves it so I'm happy lol

Wow!!! I have to say, I was a little hesitant with the cheese. But it was so amazing, I'll never make green bean casserole another way again! The only thing I did differently was I mixed in about 1/4c fried onions in addition to the onions sprinkled on top. It was my family's favorite part of the meal. Can't wait to make it again! Thanks!

This recipe is AWESOME. The only thing that I add is black pepper, minced onion and extra cheese (to taste) to the mixture. It really makes a HUGE difference in flavor!! This is one of my favorites! My husband and daughter can't get enough!

4* is for the original recipe but I used others' suggestions + made it into a CHICKEN casserole: mixed green beans, FF onions (didn't have but around 3 oz), 1-1/2 c. cheese, soup, sliced water chestnuts, black pepper, garlic POWDER & real bacon bits in 9 x 13 pan. Mixed in precooked instant brown rice. Topped w/ some skinned roasted chicken (from deli) cut into chunks & pushed these down into casserole so they wouldn't dry out. Topped w/ about a 1/2 c. of the drippings from bottom of chicken container mixed w/water. 350 around 25 min. Would have been better if I'd had more FF onions on top. No extra salt was needed. Good & fast!

This recipe is okay.  Honestly, I don't find the addition of cheese to improve the original green bean casserole recipe of beans, cream of mushroom soup, and fried onion rings.  Simple is best in this case.

I've made this recipe a few times now, and have yet to be disappointed :)  All I can say is Mmmmm! It is so good. I love the creamy flavor and texture to it. It's also very quick and easy to make. Will definitely be making this dish again, because I can't get enough of it!

What a hit! Great dish, The first one i made was perfect, i used 3 cans of cut green beans (Del monte), two cans of campbell's mushroom soup, two huge cups of cheese and 1 1/2 containers of french fried onions. Cooked in oven @ 350 for an hour. everyone had 2 helpings lol and asking for more.. I had to make a second dish but with the holiday not much was open, the corner store had everything except Campbells soup, just had the cheap stuff.. was not as good as the first one.. Campbell's is a must!!

I don't know how this differs from what my mom usually makes at holidays but... it does... and I didn't like it half as much. Maybe it's all the cheddar- makes it almost sour. Didn't rekindle the warm holiday meals I wanted to remember.

I served this dish with Thanksgiving dinner, and even my grandkids raved about it!  The only modifications I made were steamed fresh green beans instead of canned, and I added a few cubes of Velveeta cheese to the beans and mushroom soup.  Microwaved everything, mixed the melted cheese and beans well, then added the shredded cheddar cheese and fried onions on top.  Baked until the the onions were slightly browned.  SO good!

I can't say if the recipe needs tweaking or if my family just isn't the "green bean casserole" type, but we weren't impressed.  Take into consideration that we have never had green bean casserole before.

This is pretty much the standard recipe with cheese added to it, but that one addition does make a difference! I made this last Thanksgiving and it was superb.

This is a very easy recipe. I use fresh green beans and blanch them first. I also use parmesan in addition to the chedder to give it more color. I havent tried it with the french fried onion yet because I can never seem to find that at the store!

Good, but would definitely be a little bland as written. I sauteed some onions and garlic in butter, then added the green beans and mixed everything else in. Good, but not great. Definitely missing something. Thanks! :)

This was a great twist on a classic!!  I added a few shakes of soy sauce, but otherwise kept it the same.  I doubled it for a Christmas potluck, and the entire 13x9 pan was gone!  Thanks for sharing!

Definitely 5 stars with the suggestion to add 3 oz of cubed processed cheese (Velveeta) to the mixture while heating to mix flavors.  Baked with shredded cheddar on top with onion.  Way better than any other version of this I have had in the past.

This is a very good dish.  My husband loves it.  I put all the cheese into the mixture, so the onions will be crunchier.  I also don't really like the strong flavor of the cream of mushroom soup, so I used cream of celery soup.  DELICIOUS!

Very Very good... even those who dont normally like green beans thought it was good... per other reviews i did add cheese into the mixture not just on top, and quite a bit since the family is cheese lovers.  Next time i will just put all cheese inside and none on top only the onions, as what was on top got a little hard.

Yummiest green bean casserole I've tried! I used frozen beans rather than canned. I added a little bit of minced onion and garlic powder and I mixed all the cheese into the beans. Since I made it the day before and cooked in on Thanksgiving, I just popped the whole thing in the oven with the other casseroles for about 30 minutes, rather than microwaving it. I'm eating the leftovers today and it's even better the next day, with some cold, crunchy FF onions on top. Thanks for a great recipe - our new family recipe!

Just a quick note: if you don't like fried onions (which I don't) try topping this with crushed cheese crackers (like Cheese Nips).  It complements the taste (starchy and salty) and it's a lower calorie substitute for fried onions.  Otherwise this recipe really impressed me.  Not only was is easy to make, incredibly creamy, and took no time at all, it was delicious.  I brought this to a bunch of college boys who I figured probably wouldn't even glance at it (since it's neither turkey nor stuffing) and they scraped the casserole dish clean!

This is a great recipe, and so easy!  I served it for a family dinner, and it will definitely be on the table again at the holidays.  I found it unnecessary to microwave the ingredients first.  And, I used at least 2 cups of cheese-- the more cheese the better in my book.  This one is a keeper!

As one reviewer said, it's the same old green bean casserole with some cheddar cheese in it and on top. You either love it or hate it! It's very easy, though.

My family really liked the addition of cheese to the traditional Green Bean Casserole, but I thought it wasn't as flavorful, I missed the Worchesters.  Next time, I will follow the Campbell's soup recipe and add the cheese.

I made this for the first time at Thanksgiving and it was a HUGE hit!  I'm not sure why since there are only 4 ingredients but everyone raved about it.  I will definitely be making this for every holiday gathering since it's so easy and so good.  Also--I used the 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup and 2% cheese to lower the fat and calories and no one knew the difference!

I love this recipe, I make it all the time! Never use frozen, like someone already said. What I use is the Salt Free canned green bean (french cut) and it's amazing. I hate the green beans with all the salt in them and this kind tastes just like steamed green beans.

I made this recipe for thanksgiving. I added a can of mushrooms, used 2 cans of french style green beans, I stirred in 2.5 ounces of french fried onions and some cheese into the dish and baked is a little just as the cheese was melting then I put the french fried onions on top of it and baked it until the onions were golden brown. It was a major hit, as a matter of a fact it was the only food that there wasn't any leftovers of. Will definitely be making this again.

I also love this recipe, and learned it from my grandma. we use the water chestnuts as well but slice (the sliced) water chestnuts into quarters. omit the cheese totally, stir in half the can of onions, put the other half on top (about 5 mins before done) and stir in salt and pepper and also a teaspoon approx. of creole seasoning. also it makes it great if you grease the dish with butter before you pour it in!!! all in all excellent!

This was really good...I used fresh green beans but didn't have enough so I had to throw in some canned corn...still turned out yummy. And I used cream of chicken, because I really dislike mushrooms, and again still liked. Only I don't think it makes the best leftovers, so make sure that you can finish it. Thanks for the recipe!

This turned out delicious!  I love green beans but have always thought green bean casserole was pretty bland.  So I appreciate the reviews that suggested adding roasted garlic mushroom soup, which is what I did...excellent.  Everyone at my office devoured it.

My 11 year old daughter made this for a church potluck dinner.  It was a huge hit.  The pan was scraped clean.  The only changes she made was to use 2 full cans of french fried onions.  She also used italian cut green beans, which she and her dad bought by mistake but really helped to make the recipe special.

I made this dish last thanksgiving - there were about 25 people and there were 3 or 4 green bean casseroles there - mine was the only one that was cleaned out.  Everyone kept raving about it - needless to say - this year I am in charge of all the green bean casseroles! I know it is the cheese that makes it so good & it is so simple to make!

This was the first recipe I tried from this site, and I was very pleased!  Very yummy.  I'd eated it many times, but never made it myself before.  A+++!  Only thing I did differently was I used American cheese instead of Cheddar.

Perfect original recipe , I only used half the cheese and mixed it in I didn’t put any on top and for the onions I used the small 2.8 since i accidentally bought the smaller one and it turned out to be the perfect amount. Mixed 3/4 onions in and the rest on top !

I made this using the recipe ingredients but I added some sliced canned mushrooms. I mixed in a bowl and put it in the casserole dish, added just the onions on top and put it in the oven. I didn’t use the microwave.

I just made this for the first time, and used some of the suggestions from others.  It was soooo good! Like others, I made some of the suggested modifications. I did a double recipe. I used fresh green beans and cooked them about halfway before mixing with the mushroom soup, Mexican blend cheese, and about half of the fried onions.  I also added some garlic salt, about 1/2 tsp of Cayenne, about a tsp of soy sauce, and 4-5 cloves of fresh, diced garlic.  I baked the whole mixture for about 20 minutes and then added more fried onions on top.  I put it under the broiler but some of the onions burned quickly so I picked off the burned ones.  Be careful how you do this last step to have a crispy onion top.  It was still fantastic and got the most compliments of the entire meal.  The flavors blend together so nicely you don't get an over-powering mushroom or cheese flavor.  Even both of my picky-eater teens loved it.  This one's a keeper!

I loooovve green bean casserole and this is a classic recipe how I remember this from my childhood. I used FRENCH style green beans, and mixed the soup, cheese, and green beans all together with no microwaving required, plus a handful of french onions in the mix then did a sprinkle of salt & pepper. Then I put the casserole in for baking for 30min. I added about 5 more minutes of baking AFTER putting the french onions topping on top plus sprinkled additional 1/2 cup shedded cheese spread out EVENLY on top. The results were easy & delicious ! I liked the nice crunch on top with the french onions ! Will make this again ! :)

I loved this- best green beans ever, and fantastic leftovers as well!  I skipped the microwaving step, as many other reviews recommended.  It worked well, except the frozen green beans I used were just a little too firm at the first serving (great when leftover).  So I would probably cook the frozen green beans a little bit before putting them in the casserole... This recipe makes WAY more than 6 servings.  I doubled it at Christmas dinner for 8 and couldn't possibly eat all the leftovers.  I added a can of sliced water chestnuts, garlic powder, soy sauce, and some sour cream when the mixture ended up looking too dry.  Subbed cream of celery soup.  Put all the cheese inside the casserole, half the onions inside the casserole, and the other half on top.  Made the day before Christmas, put in fridge, set on counter 1 hour before baking.  Fantastic!

I used fresh green beans, specifically the ones from Whole Foods that are packaged similar to spinach and trimmed. I had to cut them into smaller pieces at home which wasn’t annoying at all it’s just a little extra step. One 14 oz bag is enough. I agree with someone else’s comment that the microwave part isn’t necessary. I also followed the same comment about adding a can of water chestnuts (that I had to cut into smaller pieces myself) which added that nice little crunch. I think mixing half of the fried onions in and then adding a layer on top near the end and baking it more enhances the side dish even more! Brought this over to my Mom’s for a Hanukkah dinner recently  and it was a hit with the fam!

This classic dish is always a favorite. I give it 4 stars for the original recipe as is, however as others have stated it can be a 5 star with some tweeks. I use 2 cans of soup, 2 cans cut beans, omit the milk and add 1/2 cup sour cream instead, 1/4 tsp garlic powder and a little more pepper. I also don't heat it up first and I added all the cheese and 1/2 the onions then more onions on top without more cheese. Mixed it all together in a bowl then to dish and I baked mine for an hour and the onions were perfectly browned and crisp and the sour cream with extra soup made it pop and it was so creamy and delicious. Will make it like this always in the future.

I made this gluten free by making my own onion rings!  To make the onions rings, add two to three eggs and 1/2 cup of cream or milk.  Dip in arrow root and fry!!!    Next, follow the recipe!!!

Read through reviews, and will make modifications next time. Original recipe was very salty. I will add mushrooms next time and skip microwaving. I used French style green beans and think 3 cans would be better than 2. The condensed cream of mushroom kind of overpowered the green beans. But otherwise very simple and easy to make any day of the week.

This is a great recipe! The only difference I made was by adding the cheese to the mixture instead of on top. Delicious and a big hit at our Thanksgiving this year.

This was the most popular dish at Thanksgiving which was lowkey frustrating because I spent literally hours on stuffing but maybe twenty minutes on this. Go figure! Simple but delicious. No microwaving necessary, by the way.

I've made this three times and have modified it a bit. My family loves it! I am not fond of mushrooms, so I use cream of celery soup. We're cheese fiends, so I use a bit more cheese than is called for in the recipe. Also, I would encourage the cook to use a shallow casserole dish for great surface area. There are a lot of fried onions and you don't want a pile of them to overwhelm the green bean mixture.

I like to add a few drops of Tabasco, and some Worcestershire sauce (to taste).  I stir cheese into the casserole, & 1/2 the French Oniona.   Topping with 1/2 the French Onions, for last few minutes of baking.

Love this recipe. The cheese really adds something.
I tried using white cheddar and the family commented it didn't taste as cheesy so make sure to use yellow cheddar.

My Family wants green bean casserole every year at Thanksgiving. This year I decided to make two of them. One was regular without cheese, and I made this recipe with cheese. My family and I were not impressed with the addition of the cheese.

I made a few modifications like other posters...used the entire bag of shredded cheese, used all the crunchy onions on top, and added half a can of chopped water chestnuts. Also a sprinkle of garlic. I feel like I missed the salt, so next time I would add salt. It came out creamy, crunchy, and tasty! A big hit with the family.

This has become a favorite in my family. I make it as described by Memphisbelle and skip the heating in the microwave.  The waterchestnuts and bacon bits add take it over the top.

Delicious! Goes super quick. I agree with the person before who mentioned microwave is unnecessary-just bake it all in the oven.

I don’t like canned green beans so I used fresh green beans and cut them french style. It’s a little more work but worth it. Used 1/2 cup cream. Really tasty.

I use this as a base recipe with some modifications. I prefer frozen beans, which i cook in butter and/or pork fat for about an hour, until soft. I crumble up some bacon and mix it in with the green bean mixture then crumble on top. I sometimes also add fresh sauted mushrooms.

I used this recipe instead of the standard- WOW!  Just adding the cheese made such a difference!  I just used the ingredients though- I didn't follow the instructions as she wrote them.  I mixed up everything together except half the onions, which I sprinkled on top before baking.  It was so good the family requested I make it that way all the time!

I've made this many times now for holidays and regular dinner nights and it is always well received! I spray my casserole dish then dump my green beans, mushroom soup, some of the cheese and half the can of fried onions in, mix it and spread it out then top with the remaining onions and cheese. Simple and delicious! I've made it both with cut green beans and french style and it turns out fine every time.

From other reviewer - this is great - use French-cut green beans, add a (drained) can of sliced water chestnuts (coarsely chopped, prob don't need whole can) and stir 3 ounces of the French fried onions into the casserole along with ALL of the cheddar cheese. Heating the ingredients in the microwave is really an unnecessary step. Bake in a flat casserole dish 30-35 minutes or until hot in the center. Then sprinkle the other 3 ounces of French fried onions over the top and bake 5 minutes more. Cheese is better stirred INTO the casserole and NOT put on top. If doubling the recipe, using one can of water chestnuts works fine since a whole can is almost too much (but we like the crunch!) for a single recipe, depending on personal taste.

Excellent recipe, but I did follow the lead of others, and combined all of the cheese with the other ingredients, added a half can of chopped water chestnuts, and about 1/4 teaspoon of pepper. Rave reviews!

Love it. However, it is bland so second time I added 1 tsp of my home made season salt (1 cup salt, 1/4 cup black pepper, 1/4 cup garlic powder, 1 pinch of cayenne) before baking and it made all the difference. I also boiled the green beans in chicken broth, strained them, then added the mushroom soup and cheddar cheese to them and heated all together on the stove top. What a difference. I also didn’t add cheese with the French fried onions because it changes their crunchy texture to a chewy one. I definitely recommend these changes for a more savory flavor and better consistency.

Love this recipe. I even customize it with diced jalapeños and chicken and use cream of chicken vs mushroom. I’ve even used sour cream instead of soup and it was yummy.

Its pretty good! I literally like making this now, but im not sure what I did the first time I made it because now the flavor was off. I would add some seasoning to the beans because making it as described was really bland. It could of been the mushroom soup that I used. I didnt use campbells like I did the first time.

I didn't have any fried onions so I added 1/2 of a medium onion and 2 cloves of garlic that I soften in a skillet.   I also added a dash of Worcestershire sauce.   I also just mixed all of the cheese in.   I'm not a huge fan of this dish in general, but this was good and I will make again.

I made this recipe over the holidays at least three times. The only thing I changed was the soup. Here in Texas we have cream of poblano or cream of jalapeno soup so I used one of those because I don't like the taste of mushroom or celery soups. Each time I made it the casserole dish was empty. Thanks for delicious side dish!

I charged myself with making green bean casserole last Thanksgiving. I had never made it before and used this recipe. It was a hit! I substituted fresh green beans though because I don’t like canned. Many people have since told me this is the best green bean casserole they’ve ever had!

Was a nice change and delicious.  It disappeared and people were "arguing" over the last scoop. LOL  I loved that it took half the time to cook as well and didn't tie my oven up to cook other things.  I made it for Christmas dinner and then again 2 days later, it was such a hit.

We made this for Christmas dinner. One reviewer suggested mixing half the cheese in the mixture prior to baking and she skipped the microwave cycles. We did the same and I added 3 slices of chopped jalapeño. Viola, everyone said it was the best they ever ate. Admittedly, it was very good. I will make it for other than holiday meals.

Everything is better with cheese !!  The only thing I did different was put about a cup of the fried onions mixed into the green beans.  Baked in 350 oven for about 30 minutes then sprinkled on more fried onions on top and baked until they were crisp.  Delicious thank you for the recipe.

I typically hate reviewing after changing the recipe, but it was very simple, quick, and delicious, so I am. I switched out the cream of mushroom soup for cream of celery soup as I dislike mushrooms. Still delicious and easy to put together!

I was looking for something different to make for my family and decided to try this casserole. I've never made a casserole before. It was super easy, quick, and simple to follow. As for taste, it was too bland for my liking. I had to add more seasoning. Nothing special about this dish!

I made this into a main dish by browning a pound of 93% beef before proceeding with the recipe, heating up the mixture in the same Corning Ware dish that I cooked the beef in, making it a one dish meal. If you have only frozen beans, be sure to overcook them so they taste more like the canned. Quick and good enough. I don’t usually use canned items, but I was very happy with this and plan to keep the ingredients on hand for an emergency meal for six.

I was looking for something new to add to my traditional green bean casserole. I doubled this recipe and followed it as directed. However, I did add a bit of seasoning to the mixture to liven it up a little. I prepped the casserole the night before  mixing in one of the cans of onions. The next day, I pulled it out 2 hours before I wanted to bake it and topped it with the second can of onions just before baking. Although this recipe was tasty, I don't know that I would call it "Best Green Bean Casserole". If I were to make this again, I wouldn't mix the onions into the mixture the night before, instead I would do that right before baking. Solely because I prefer a lot of crunch in my casserole. Thank you for sharing your twist on this dish!

This was the BEST GREEN BEAN CASSEROLE ever.  I wanted to try something a little different than the classic recipe.  Being a cheese lover, when I saw this recipe, I knew I couldn't go wrong.  It got rave reviews from the family, and this will be the recipe used from here on out!  (I did add some onion flakes, and some garlic powder)

Love this easy peasy recipe. I did listen to reviews and made a few changes.
I mixed 2 cans French style green beans, one can cream of chicken only bc I'm not a fan of mushroom, one cup cheese and garlic powder to taste with a pinch of salt and pepper. Mixed without microwaving and put in a 8x8/9x9 pan. Cooked at 350 for about 20/30 mins until bubbly. Added French fried onions and cooked for about 10/12 or until crispy enough. Was really good for being so easy! People who didnt like green bean casserole tried it and actually ended up eating it all! Definitely double recipe if you need for more than 4 people or if you have big eaters ??

Took suggestions and mixed in minced chestnuts. Mixed all the cheese and half the crunchy onions into the casserole itself. Delicious!! I love the crunch without the onion flavor. It’s borderline too salty of a dish for me but when eaten as a side (as it’s meant to be) it balances out perfectly.

Definitely the best version of the standard green bean casserole recipe. I followed others' suggestions and mixed all the cheese in as well as added the chopped water chestnuts.  This is a keeper!

This was delicious and went over well at the family Thanksgiving dinner. I used cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom as my sister hates mushrooms but it was still wonderful. Will definitely make again.

I doubled the recipe and added bacon and fried onions in the mix.  I cut the bacon and cooked it on the stovetop.  I then removed most of the bacon fat,  added the green beans and cream of mushroom soup, shredded cheese,  and a couple of handfuls of the fried onions.  After all was mixed well I placed it in a baking dish as instructed, and topped with cheese and fried onions.  OMG!!! Delicious!!!

Great recipe. Added into it the follow:
Sauteed enoki mushrooms and onions and sweet peas and a cup of garlic herb bread crumbs and it was a hit at Thanksgiving!  Only thing is I had to bake it much longer than expected because I used fresh long green beans.

We always make this with fresh green beans. Much better in my opinion and better for you. We cut the tips off the green beans and cut in half. My family used frozen for years but loves it now the way we use fresh. Also, we add some soy sauce to the cream of mushroom mix. Yum! :)

I made a half batch to try it before taking a "new" recipe to Thanksgiving (who takes untested recipes to Thanksgiving??). It is delicious. A cheesy twist to the good ole' French's recipe.

Read the comments, skipped the microwave, and ended up mixing the green beans, mushroom soup and cheese before placing it in the oven. After baking for 25 minutes, I sprinkled the onions and baked it for another 5 mins. Husband loved it! Will definitely be making this again!

This is how I've made green bean casserole for years and it always gets complements! Sometimes I add just a little milk and a dash of black pepper. All the cheese goes into the mixture, not on top. The cheese is what sets it apart without being overwhelming. But I've never tried jumpstarting it in the microwave. That sounds like a great idea since there is competition for oven space on holidays.

Love this recipe. I used fresh green beans, steaming for 3 1/2 minutes.  And sautéed some onions in butter before adding the mixture together. Tastes just like my Grandmothers Thanksgiving casserole!

The second time I used extra large can of Libbys french style beans and sauted half of an onion and mixed it with one can of mushroom soup and half cup of sour cream also three strips of crispy bacon  crumbled and added about four ounces of cheese    Topped with remaining cheese. when chesse melted and dish was bubbly added layer of french fried onion for topping.  TRY IT!!!!

I added real bacon bits to the casserole and it was so very good. First time to both make and eat. I am so glad this was a requested dish to a meal I was invited to, otherwise I would have continued to miss out on this deliciousness! Leftovers are better than the first time!

I've made this about three times and it's always been a hit! I did decide to put the cheese as the base versus on top of the casserole to let the onions soak a little of the casserole. Either way, it's always delicious!

This was a weird dish. I ate lots but I didn’t know why. It was a very comforting dish but it was not great on flavour. Definitely needed salt and I did put the cheese under the onions so they were crispy. I will make again but will tweek. Just like Riley41 said I would also omit the cheese as I didn’t taste it even though there was a cup in it.

I’ve never really been a fan of green bean casserole, but I was asked to make it for a family gathering and I found this recipe. Let me tell you, it was a hit with everyone, including myself. The only thing I changed was to add a bit more seasoning and I mixed some of the French onions into the casserole as others suggested. This has changed my outlook on green bean casserole and I’ll definitely be using this recipe again.

This is a great recipe, and you can add and make changes to your taste. This is what I did: 

I chopped fresh onions and cooked until soft in a little olive oil. Removed the onions and placed on paper towel to remove any excess oil. Mixed 1 can cut green beans and 1 can French cut , mushrooms soup and about 1/4 cup sour cream. Added the onions, the cheese and the french fried onions, and a pinch of dry mustard, mixed and baked. Once done I added more french onions around the casserole and cheese in the center and placed back in oven for an additional 5 minutes until cheese melted and french onions are crispy. Delicious.

I followed the directions exactly and it is very good!! I made it for Thanksgiving last year and the family couldn't get enough. There are never any left overs. I made this 3 times since then and I ammaking it again for lunch with our family this afternoon. Highly recommend!! I think the cheddar cheese is what makes it better than other casseroles.

I made this for thanksgiving and for Christmas dinner.  For thanksgiving I made it as is with some minor modifications. I seasoned with garlic salt and I used velvetta instead of cheddar cheese. Turned out great. It was completely gone. It did need salt.  For Christmas it was a larger crowd so I doubled it by using 5 cans of beans and 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and 1 can of cream of chicken soup. I added garlic salt and regular salt. This time I used cheddar cheese.   Next time I will use Velveeta instead.  The trick to making it extra yummy, add some fried onions to the mixture not just on top.

Made this for Thanksgiving and it's so good I'm making it again for Christmas dinner.  Took MemphisBelle's suggestion and added chopped water chestnuts, all of the cheese mixed in, and 3 oz of the fried onion into the casserole, with the remaining fried onion sprinkled on top for last 5 mins of baking.  Delicious!

Gone in 60 seconds. No microwave. I simmered the fresh green beans in chicken broth for approx. 12 mins.(set aside) I sauteed some fresh chopped mushrooms with diced onions & real bacon bits for a few minutes. I added the mushroom soup with a little cheddar cheese and heated it up.  Mixed it all. Put in pan & sprinkled with parmesan and a little cheddar and baked at 350 for a few minutes. Added some of the fried onions and baked for 10 minutes. Added more onions and baked for 15 more minutes. Went to a party of 25 people. (mistake: I only tripled the ingredients) It was gone before my GF could take her coat off.  Tons of praise from 12 yr olds to 80 year olds and everyone in-between. I guess my first time on this one was a "hit." WiLL make again!!

I used this recipe last year for Thanksgiving and my family requested that I make it again this year.  It is amazing.  I read a review that said to cook the green beans and cream of mushroom for 20 minutes then add the cheese and onions and cook an additional 7 minutes.  This keeps the onions crispy.

I liked this casserole even though I forgot to buy the French’s onions. Will make it again and use some of the suggestions of the water chestnuts, stirring the cheese into  the beans and also some of the onions.

This was an easy, fast, and tasty dish. I made it exactly as the recipe said. The reason for only 4 stars is that my family was not wild about the cheese. Next time I will leave that out.

My family loves green bean casserole. I omit the flour and white sugar. I always add 1/2 or more of the 10.5oz can of cream of mushroom along with more or less of the sour cream mentioned. I also prefer Frenches Crispy Fried Onions mixed in with the creamy mixture of French cut green  beans. This recipe is a great side dish for any holiday gathering.

This was a truly delicious first for me.  I've never made this casserole  before but I will from now on.  The only change I made was additional cheese; I used a full cup plus 1/2 cup .

I really wanted to like it, and maybe I did something to mess it up.  I made it with green beans, cream of chicken soup, cheddar cheese and the fried onions, but also added some bacon bits for flavor.  I made it as the recipe suggested but had the cheese mixed in.  I added no spices at all, no salt or pepper, but it was extremely salty, to the point of being almost inedible, and I have no idea why.  I was really excited about it and all I can think is try to find low sodium cream of xxx soup?

Very good traditional dish. Do not be tempted to add additional cheese because this dish is already “greasy”.

This is a 5 star recipe using the changes from Memphisbelle's review. I made this last Thanksgiving for both sides of the family, and now it is requested of me for every family get together, from both sides! For me, one whole can of water chestnuts is a little much. I think half a can, up to 3/4 of a can, is perfect. I also like to use sharp cheddar cheese for a stronger flavor.

You think that as basic as this recipe is, that it wouldn't be that great... This turned out amazing for my family today!! Ended up using a 22.6 oz can of cream of mushroom and adding extra mushrooms to mine, plus paprika, truffle dust, lemon juice, garlic powder, and black pepper. Best green bean casserole of my family to date, as told by my dad and uncle! Easy to make too! Doing this next year, but maybe with bacon....

Just made this up real quick for Thanksgiving dinner. Pretty much stuck to the recipe although I did cut back on the cheese and seasoned the beans a tad since canned beans can be so bland. My green bean casserole is always a big hit!

This is so good. The only thing I do differently is skip the microwave heating because I make it ahead for Thanksgiving and other holidays. I also add water chestnuts cut up for a nice crunch. So good!

Good recipe but can be made better by adding sautéed diced onions and Worcestershire to the soup. I also use cream of mushroom with garlic soup to add more flavor.

Add about 2 tablespoons of parma cheese and some salt and pepper.  I have also added one can cream of chicken and one cream of mushroom together with 4 cans of green beans for a large casserole.

Loved the cheese idea, but didn't make a very creamy sauce, needed the milk, Worcestershire, and black pepper in the cream of mushroom soup.

This was the first time I ever made a green bean casserole and I was a bit nervous.  I shouldn't have been because it came out awesome!  I did add some chopped up cooked bacon though and it added a little something extra.  My family said they would love if I made this again.  Yum!

I did make a few modifications since I am allergic to mushrooms. I used Campbell's cream of onion soup and I smashed 3 roasted garlic cloves into the soup mix. Wow!  what a difference. Yum, yum

I made this for Christmas. I thought it was ok. it would have been better if it was made with French cut green beans. my fiancee loved it minus the French fried onions. I would make it again, if I was asked to. I wouldn't go out of my way to make it again.

I added 3 heaping tablespoons of Capers and about 3 teaspoons of Worcestershire sauce to this recipe. The added flavors were spot on. Everyone really enjoyed it so much, there were no leftovers.

I usually despise canned veggies of any kind and don't eat the usual green bean casserole BUT this was dynamite!!!  I made it for our Xmas eve dinner and I couldn't believe how good it was!  I added chopped chestnuts for extra crunch and used the French style green beans.  DELICIOUS!!!

This was the first time I had ever made green bean casserole and I can say it was a success. Instead of pre-made crispy onions, we fried our own onions and used those in and on top of the casserole. Delicious!

Use 3 cans Del Monte French cut beans or green .  I used Progresso Creamy Mushroom soup and that bumps it up (portabellas).  I agree with other reviewers, skip the microwave step and just combine everything in the casserole dish.  I thought this was much better the second day, so I will make ahead in the future.  I also stirred in some chopped fresh onion for more zip.

I had to push myself to give five stars, only because I can't call green bean casserole a gourmet treat. That said, though, it was a hit and my personal favorite of our Christmas dinner. Only differences I made was to not add cheese, might try that next time, and I used a tiny bit of half&half included in the milk portion. Also, I added a splash of worchestershire sauce. Thanks! This will be my go to.

Made it and it was really good. Careful, tho, if you're limiting salt in your diet.  Canned veggies are saltier than frozen and creamed soup concentrate is as well.  I hadn't used those canned fried onions in 20 years because of a bad experience, but they're really good now and add some great crunch to the topping.  This is what I love about these recipes and the feedback -- it lets you try things that you wouldn't normally try without other readers' comments.  Good on 'ya.

Very good! I followed the suggestions of the top reviewer, and it came out great. Did not use the microwave, just mixed in a large bowl before adding to the casserole dish. To the french-style green beans,  I added a small can of coarsely chopped water chestnuts and added all of the cheese.  Added half of the onions to the casserole; after 30-35 min, topped with the remainder and baked for 5 min. Black pepper always works good here, so I also added a little of that.

This was delicious--my husband even liked it, and he's not a fan of green bean casserole. I used no-salt-added, french cut beans (2 cans), 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, cheese, water chestnuts, french onions, and a bit of soy sauce. I'll definitely make it this way again!

I tried this recipe to put a spin on the basic green bean casserole. The cheese makes a great difference and everyone enjoyed it! However, I DO NOT USE THE MICROWAVE ON MY FOOD and I do not put the cheese on top of the french onions, I put the french onions on top of the cheese =)
I will make this again and again any day. Canned French cut green beans a must!

Always remember to put the cheese before the onions! Just thought I'd add that. lol. but this recipe was great when it got a little love in the form of garlic powder, salt, black pepper, and onion powder. Will definitely make again.

I made this for a Thanksgiving meal with family. It was a big hit! People liked the addition of cheese to this standard casserole. I did add an extra can of French cut green beans. I mixed the cheese into the casserole and half of the French fried onions. Toward the end of baking I added the rest of the fried onions to the top and finished baking.

This was fantastic! I followed the recipe but used the suggestions of MEMPHISBELLE and stirred the onions and cheese into the casserole. I think it was better as leftovers!! I loved the crunch the water chestnuts added to the dish. Usually it is kind of a mushy dish but that gave it a great crunch. Easy and delicious!

I've made this version of green bean casserole the past few years now for Thanksgiving, and it's a huge hit with the whole family. I've experimented with different cheeses too: cheddar, swiss, and gruyère so far; all are good. Simple recipe, easy to fix, and very tasty.

For a 9x13 pan, I add a 13.25 ounce can of either sliced button mushrooms or stems & pieces, thoroughly drained. And, yes, mixing about 4 oz. of shredded cheddar and a cup of the crispy fried onions directly into the casserole does improve the standard recipe. For an extra crispy topping without adding too much onion, I grate 3 to 4 oz. of Swiss or cheddar cheese on top (no more than that), then I spread 2 cups of French's crispy fried onions, and lastly (believe it or not) 2 cups of whole regular corn flakes (not sugar frosted). The corn flakes are neutral tasting, add lots of crunch, and shield the fried onions from over-browning. (BTW, this topping works on other casseroles, too.)

I added some bacon and extra milk because my family prefers the mushroom soup to be "saucy". The bacon really added a nice complementary flavor to the dish.

This was the first  time I've eaten this casserole. My family loved it and so did I. There was nothing left in the dish. I doubled this recipe but one thing I would not double are the fried onions. They were a bit too much. I will make this again.

By far the best green bean casserole I have had. It wasn't as soupy as the traditional green bean casserole and the addition of the cheese in the dish and on top was a plus. I did change up the soup to cream of celery since none of us here is crazy about mushrooms.  Thumbs up...great recipe, Thank you

I have to make this again for my son two days after Thanksgiving.  The only thing is I've picked up for the second time around is Italian Green Beans so I think my son won't care.  He polished off the first making of this and wants more.  He loves the addition of the cheese to it.  He's the only one who wants it and I don't mind making it for him.

This is very good, better than the normal green bean casserole. Thanks all for the tips, I did mix the cheese before baking and reserved some onions for the last 5 minutes of baking. I think this worked very well.

Made it for thanksgiving.  I had a big crowd so I tripled the ingredients and used the stove top to warm everything instead of the microwave before transferring to a casserole dish in the oven. Absolutely the best hands down for a first timer like myself!

Very good!! I also skipped the microwave and mixed the cheese into the green beans instead of sprinkling on top.

Made it for Thanksgiving today, used french style beans, cause that's how I remember it as a kid, and it was a perfect blast from the past. My 9 year old loved it so it will definitely get made again.

I've never made Green Bean Casserole and wanted to keep my first time simple. I couldn't wait until Thanksgiving so I made it tonight (the night before.) I followed the recipe as instructed and it was delicious. DO NOT add more salt. Although canned beans are unseasoned, the salt in the cheese and the soup "should" suffice. DO NOT mix-in the onions into the soup/green beans/cheese mix...from previous experience with these onions, they will get soggy. Just top the casserole dish with them before placing it into the preheated oven. About 12 minutes was enough for me.

Best GB casserole recipe I've made.  As others suggested, I added water chestnuts to the recipe and they gave it a really nice crunch.  I agree with some others that the cheese on top makes the onions soggy so I added that to the mixture and didn't bother with the microwave.  Baked for 30 minutes, added onions to the top and baked 5-10 more.  I used a 9X13 inch dish and could easily have fit another can of green beans.  It went fast at my potluck that's for sure.

Doubled the recipe to serve 10, however, I still only used one 6oz container of French fried onions, filled a 9x9 foil pan.

Simple and delicious. I didn't have canned green beans so I rinsed and drained half bag of frozen and this turned out fabulous. My favorite part is the crunchy topping!

I made no substitutions. My husband loves this casserole when it's done right and can't stand it when it's not done right. He loved this casserole. The onions were a little too done for my liking, but the next time I will only bake it for 20 minutes. There were no leftovers when dinner was done.

I saw that one reviewer said it needed more salt, but I have to say I disagree. The French fried onions have all the salt you need. Also, didn't add cheese on top so the onions don't get mushy. SUPER EASY! And super tasty. :)

3-27-16 > Made this for Easter Family Dinner and to everyone's surprise  including myself it was the best we have ever had.  By mistake I bought French cut green beans and opened all four cans to drain (double batch) so I had to use them.  The only other change was the topping, 1/4 cup of cheese, more FF Onions then finished off with the remaining 1/4 of cheese then FF on top.  Every bite and some crunch to it...very, very good...thanks!

I use frozen green beans to avoid salt so I boiled the green beans in some water to a just tender bean state before finishing the rest of the recipe as listed.  Family liked it well enough that it joins the rotation for the green bean dish.  It's quick and easy too.

I made this with the cheese and fried onions mixed in as others suggested.  It was really good and my kids even ate it.  The only other change I made was to add some salt and pepper as I thought it needed a little more seasoning. I will definitely make it again! Thanks.

The green bean casserole that I remember eating 25 years ago. I have tried other variations of GBC's and this one still sets the mark. I always try to make things my own. I added 1/4 purple onion into the mix to add a little more texture and color to dish. But the recipe is perfect as it is.

I make green bean casserole for every holiday.  I plan to try this version soon.  I do have a question.  Cover or not cover while baking? I rated the recipe only because it was required to submit my comments.  Hopefully the recipe will be a 5.

Good recipe to start! My modifications included, using half the crunchy onions in the mix. I used cream of celery soup instead of mushrooms. No microwave. I did a small version to test out the cheese. I like my topping very crunchy and with cheese it melts then gets crispy, so it is just a shelf of hard cheese. I put the cheese on top of my mix, then spread a layer of onions on top of that. Had a great crunch and you don't get a slab of cheese when you take a portion.

I make this in my crockpot.  I use frozen green beans instead of the canned variety and add a dash of Worcestershire sauce.  Cook on low 3-4 hours then top with cheese and French fried onions, cook another 30 minutes and serve!  Yummy!

This was a good variation to the regular recipe I doubled the recipe, and did add a cup of fresh crimini mushrooms, mixed cheese in the sauce and added about 1/3 cup milk.  Baked it all first then sprinkled the top with the onions and cheese and baked a little longer to brown the top.  I also added some pepper to the mix.  The whole pan was devoured. The cheese was a nice addition for sure.

My husband loved this, I thought it was ok. Added garlic powder, black pepper and soy sauce to the mixture. I like how easy it is to make, I can't comment on how it compares to the "regular" green bean casserole because I've just moved to the US and this is a new dish to me. But I think I will make this often.

Really great recipe - & not just for the holidays!! I made just a few small changes... Cabot White Sharp Cheddar (1.5 - 2 cups instead of just one), Cream of  Chicken (instead of cream of mushroom due to allergies), & the French's White Cheddar French Fried Onions (about 8-10 ounces because I love the crunch)! Great recipe!!

I added some sliced almonds & sliced mushrooms when adding the shredded cheddar cheese to the mixture.   It was very quick  & easy, and my family loved it!

Used the ingredients as listed and mixed all together except for onions. (I did not use the microwave.) Put in the refrigerator the night before and added onions day of and it turned out delicious.  Very, very good!

I substituted condensed cream of celery soup for the mushroom soup, and that worked well.  For those who want a green bean casserole without the mushroom flavor, this is the way to go.  It was delicious!  Next time, I'll try adding some crunchy bacon.

Easy, quick and tasty - left mine in the oven a little too long which caused the French onions to overcook slightly. The wife not too crazy about the cheese on the top, might omit that next time

Made exactly as written and that's what my rating is based on. It was definitely better than the standard green bean casserole but not quite a 5-star ... the cheese does add a lot to the recipe!

I love this recipe! Only things I changed or added was garlic powder roughly two teaspoons, dash of salt and pepper and half cup sour cream. I prefer canned French cut style green beans or fresh blanched green beans. I don't cook it in the microwave either I combine all ingredients in a pot on the stove taste to it as it cooks to adjust ingredients to taste. Then I mix in the French onions, pour into a casserole dish and top with more French onions. No cheese on top either. Everyone loves this side dish!!

I slightly modified the recipe by adding the water chestnuts and I did not microwave the ingredients as directed.  I mixed all ingredients, including the cheese, baked it for 30 minutes.  This recipe is great!

I don't like the taste of cream of mushroom soup. I use cream of chicken and keep everything else the same. It just wouldn't be Thanksgiving without green bean casserole.

Always make this recipe for Thanksgiving with some variations. I use slivered almonds instead of water chestnuts as some reviews suggested and omit the cheese on top. Thanks, Jan. By the way,  originally from Memphis.

I make this dish every year for Thanksgiving and it never fails to disappear! Even my wife (who dislikes onions--I know, nobody's perfect) loves this casserole. This dish is savory, warming, and--best of all--a cinch to make.

This is a really good green bean casserole.  I used 3 cans of green beans and probably used a bit more cheese and onions.  So good and reheated the next day just fine for my lunch.  Keeping and repeating this one. Thanks for posting!

very good! I usually like to thin the soup out with a half cup of milk, but I was out and used chicken broth intead. I also used a little soy sauce mixed with the soup as well. No leftovers!

This is a great recipe! And yes, you can "get away" with frozen green beans!  Personally I think they taste SO much better than canned. I just throw them into the frig the day before to thaw and then dump them in and cook.  Yum!!

This was great, I hate canned green beans though so I used fresh (1 lb), steamed them until they were just a tiny bit firmer than I would normally like to eat them, and then baked the casserole for about 20 mins. I also used sharp cheddar cheese--I don't think it would have been nearly as good with mild cheddar.

Having read the reviews, I doubled most of the recipe for a 9 x 13 pan. I used on 1/2 cup cheese, and added a large can of water chestnuts, chopped.  I put most of the french fried onions in the mix, just saving enough to cover the top.  I mixed all ingredients and baked it for 25 minutes.  Put the rest of the onions on top and popped it back in the oven for about 7 minutes.  Delish!  Thank you!

I added 1/2 can of chopped water chestnuts, did not pre-microwave anything, & mixed in 1/2 the fried onions into the casserole with the cheese (I think this really helps it not become too runny). I can only give it 4 stars because everyone else liked it but no one had 2nd helpings besides me (I even had 3rds!). My husband's family aren't big green bean casserole people so I still think it deserves 4 stars. Personally I thought it was great! Even better than my mom's!

Use fresh beans and steam/cook in microwave, then after mixing in mushroom soup, add half cup milk also!

I make this all the time, it's easy and yummy! I always add some sauteed onion (might be too much with french fried onions but I adore onions), extra mushrooms, pinch of garlic. Depending on who's partaking, I also sometimes add bacon bits, especially around the holidays to make it festive colors.

Followed the recipe as written and commented on, it was excellent. The big difference was to mix everything and then cook. Truly worth trying.

This is your basic green bean casserole but...still tasty! I didn't put the entire 6 ounce can of french fried onions on the casserole--I thought it was a bit too many onions for too little casserole. My family, nonetheless, really enjoyed this!

A good recipe, made better with low-sodium cream of mushroom soup, stirring all of the cheddar cheese into the beans, as well as adding a can coarsely chopped water chestnuts (as suggested by Memphis Belle). If you're using fresh green beans, make sure to pre-cook in the microwave for a good five minutes, stirring at least once.

WHAAAAT??!!!!!This is so freakin' good. Excuse my languish. I tried this before at potlucks and all u can eat buffets and I used to think 'whats so great about this?'. Then I thought I need to add a veggie side to my thanksgiving dinner and chose this becuz its one of those traditional dishes. I followed the recipe except I used frozen french style green beans, just make sure you thaw them out before use. So delicious. I'm not a big fan of canned veggies, except maybe corn. Thank you thank you, my new addition to holiday meals. Yipeeee!!!!

Very good recipe.  I did make a few changes.  I added pepper...lots of pepper, garlic powder, dash of paprika, and 1/2 chopped onion.  I think I might add bacon next time.  Everything is better with bacon :)

This is a holiday staple in  my family. We like to add some of the french fried onions into the mixture along with the cheese and also top with both. Very yummy. It's also good with a can of mushrooms added in and even some crumbled bacon. There is never any left around here!

just threw everything in a boal, mixed it up and put in the casserole dish - didn't microwave anything.  Adding cheese in w/o putting on top was perfect.  I put some FF onions in the mix, too, as well as on top - just a light sprinkling - turned out great - not good when the sides are better than the bird!  LOL

Well, to be honest, the frozen green beans needed either more time in the micro-wave or in the oven. My beans didn't seem done. Next time I will boil the beans on top of the stove. Once I put the onions on top, and put them in the oven, I had to limit the time they cooked or the onions would have burnt up.I will see how my family and friends receive it in a couple of hours. Happy Thanksgiving!

Sounds delicious, can't wait to try next week. However, sorry if this is an odd question but... Is there no need to add MILK with the soup, as in the original recipe? Not sure if it's missing or not necessary.

Awesome!  I made this for dinner last week by itself and it was fantastic!  I'm not a green bean person, but I absolutely love it.  I used an entire large can of the fried onions on top, which made it nice and crunchy.

Loved this one w/ a reviewer suggestion to add a can of sliced water chestnuts! I put the onions on top only from another review and thought this was a good suggestion too. After all, we love the onions for their crunch.

I like to make a recipe the first time through with no changes to give it a fair shot. This recipe is just perfect as is and does not need any changes. Making this at Thanksgiving is so convenient because it is quick and easy to prepare and it cooks at the same time and temp as the *Sweet Potato casserole II* recipe found on this website which helps tame the cooking chaos.
I heard nothing but MMMM's over this one.

I love this recipe! Some of the reviews say it needs more flavor but I think most people who cook often know to add salt, pepper and/or garlic ect. to your own liking. Most green bean casserole recipes are very similar to this but I'd never thought of adding cheese. I used conds. cream of mushroom and chicken, added my own garlic, salt and pepper and it comes out great. I also mix cheese into the casserole as well as on top.I made it this year and last year.

eh.  i felt like it didnt have that much flavor.  i followed the recipe exactly.  the best part was the fried onions for sure.  otherwise, it was kinda bland and boring.  people did eat it all up at the potluck i brought it to, so i cant be too upset.

This is now one of the dishes I prepare for potluck dinners. I steamed frozen French-style green beans instead of the canned variety (I seriously cannot stand canned vegetables), and it turned out great. I mixed about a third of the French fried onions into the green bean mixture and sprinkled the rest on top. A great way to get my veggie-hater of a hubby to eat something besides meat and pasta! :)

This is standard for our green been casseroles for family functions.  I don't think I have ever made it the way the can says.  

I also add a couple cans of mushroom pieces.

I changed the cream of mushroom soup to a homemade cream of mushrooms where I used soy butter, soy milk, and tofu sour cream. Then I mixed veggie cheese into it. My kids absolutely loved it. This is for people who have allergies to milk products.

My father wanted classic green bean casserole this Thanksgiving, so this is what he got. The rest of us were pleasantly surprised at how tasty this is. I followed the recipe exactly, using canned french-cut green beans. Super!

I prepared this recipe for Thanksgiving and found it to be good.  I've prepared other green bean casseroles and found this recipe to be comparable to the others.  I wouldn't say that this was the "best", but it was good.  I would use this recipe again.

I liked this a lot but am giving only 4 stars instead of 5 because it seems so unhealthy.  Still, when you need a green bean casserole (Thanksgiving), this is the one to go with!  I used frozen green beans (thawed) and stirred 3 ounces of the CHEDDAR FLAVOR French fried onions into the casserole along with ALL of the cheddar cheese. I used Healthy Request soup.  I did not heat anything in the microwave.  Baked in a 9x13 dish 30-35 minutes or until hot in the center. Then sprinkled the other 3 ounces of French fried onions over the top and baked 5 minutes more. I liked this better than the standard Green Bean Casserole Recipe and will definitely use it again.

This was pretty good. I doubled the recipe and used frozen green beans that I thawed most of the way. I stirred about 1.5 cups of cheese into the casserole along with 1 (6 oz.) can of fried onions and used another can of fried onions on top. I did not bother microwaving the ingredients - I just put them into a 9X13 pan and cooked it at 350 for about 30 minutes before putting the rest of the onions on top.

I made this for a family dinner we had.  They don't think I can cook.. so I had to prove them wrong.  They put me in charge of a vegetable and so I made this.  It turned out really good.  I gave it four stars because the only thing i didnt really like about it was that the style of green beans it calls for wasn't my fav.  Other then that it had great flavor and was a hit at the dinner!

This was an easy, no fuss recipe.  I used an minced garlic, cream of celery, diced onion and just a bit of fresh cilantro.  Good recipe, and you can always add to suit to the number of people you're feeding.  Also, I've tried using fresh mushrooms as well, they look wonderful.

This is only my second time ever eating green bean casserole and this recipe was great! I used a bit more cheese to the top (because I was using a larger pan). I also use crushed nuts instead of fried onions and it added some extra protein  with the same great crunch.
