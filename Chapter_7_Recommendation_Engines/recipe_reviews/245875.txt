I made this using mostly fresh ingredients. I'm not a fan of canned food at all. I used fresh tuna, potatoes and green beans, it was really good. I will definitely make it again. I only give it 4 stars those guys because I didn't exactly follow the recipe.

The salad dressing makes this recipe! I used all fresh ingredients.
