ok the first time we made this it turned out like fudge. We made it again and realized we messed a ingredient up. It turned out perfect!  I gave this recipe a bad review at first. I am now recanting that review and giving it  5 stars.  yes!!  I will be making this again.

Very good chocolate pie!  Next time, although, I am going to double the recipe so it fills the pan completely.  Very dark, dense, rich chocolate pie and easy to make.

This was a very delicious pie.  The top bakes up crunchy and the middle is like pudding.  The only bad thing about this pie: waiting for it to cool. But once it sets up it is perfect.  This is going in my  permanent recipe file. I didn't want to share.  If you are a chocolate lover, you will love this wonderfully rich pie.

This is a wonderful recipe! My boss loves chocolate pies, so I made him one for Boss's day and one for his birthday and he loved it!  The walnuts made a wonderful addition to the pie as well.Several people have asked for the recipe. I would not change a thing!  This is a great recipe that I plan to use again and again. THANKS!

This was hands-down the best pie I've ever made. I had a very large (probably 10 in) glass pie pan and I used the No roll pie crust II recipe for the crust. I baked the No roll crust for 10 minutes prior to filling. I used the whole filling recipe in this one (large) crust. The crust was wonderful and the filling for the pie was incredible!   I didn't have walnuts in the cupboard, so I substituted chopped roasted pecans for the topping. I baked it about 5 minutes longer than it called for and added about 1 tsp of additional corn starch, as I was concerned about a runny filling with such a deep pie. The texture and consistency turned out perfectly, but did require refrigeration for the full 4 hours to "set" in the middle. I couldn't be happier to have this "go to" recipe in my kitchen. Thank you so much for sharing!!

Great pie!!  It reminded me a lot of the other recipe I have that uses sweetened condensed milk and unsweetened chocolate.  But THIS pie is way cheaper and it's so easy to make!  A great find!

I thought this recipe was Easy, and Fast!  And Delicious!!!!!! I had many people ask me for the Recipe......It's very tasty. But make sure to put tin foil loosely over the top so the crust doesn't burn. Splendid!!!!!

This is a keeper! I made this pie for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit. Good thing the recipe is for two pies! I baked one with and one without the nuts. They were both excellent! This will be a new holiday regular for my family.

I made these pies as a nod to my mother who was famous for her pies. I wanted to find a pie very close to hers to make it feel the holidays. My siblings and the kids are in love. I've made them twice now and making them tonight to celebrate NYD. Thanks for this recipe- ig1010

It was delicious!!! I didn't have any pie crusts on hand so I made a graham cracker crust, and it worked out fine.  The filling was super creamy, loved it!

I was out of walnuts too, and i also use a few handfuls of prepackaged pecans. I did have my doubts but this pie is amazing!!! I am going to get more walnuts and make this again, it can only get better. I love the crunchy topping and rich fuge like center.

I have tried so many chocolate pie recipes and I was never quite satisfied with the results until I tried Good Chocolate Pie. What an understatement the name is.  This is the best chocolate pie ever!  I've served it several times now and everyone loves it.  It cooks perfectly every time and is wonderful with or without the walnuts.  Definitely a 5-star recipe!

Really good chocolatey pie!  Quick and easy to make.  Consistency is similar to a flour-less chocolate cake.  Next time I'll use a chocolate wafer crust to make it even more chocolatey!

Hello delicious. It wasn't really what I was expecting, much better. It was NOT chocolate pudding in a crust. It tasted like an old fashioned chocolate pie. I didn't realize it was for 2 pies though. I filled it to the brim and it spilled over. Probably would have been better if I had used 2 deep dish pie crusts. I also forgot to buy nuts. It was a really good pie without the nuts, but if you like nuts (I do) it would have made it even better. I don't believe in using margarine so I used salted butter (I don't believe in using unsalted butter either). I also couldn't imagine not adding salt to a recipe that had so much sugar in it. I think it did worked out fine. Nice!

A local grocery store used to sell a chocolate pie that my brother in law and I LOVED! The store closed and we were so upset that we could no longer purchase that yummy pie. I searched for recipes and ran across this one. It tastes almost just like the one we have been missing. I prefer it without the walnuts and could eat this whole pie in one sitting!!!

I was expecting a light and airy pie and this is not it! Its more like a fudge pie with a brownie topping. It was okay in very small doses, but I made 2 and threw one away because it didnt get eaten.

I expected a dark, creamy rich, chocolate pie. This did not have the texture or flavor I was expecting. Next time I will use a recipe with real milk chocolate, not cocoa powder.
