I love me some Chef John. This was a really great recipe; I just modified it a bit based on taste preference and ingredient availability. Instead of butter I just used olive oil, and since I couldn't find Andouille, I just bought a different smoked sausage. I added some hot sauce for a bit of extra heat, I used a large can of diced tomates, I used two green peppers instead of one, I used wild rice instead of brown, and I used chicken instead of shrimp. Tasted quite delicious!

The portions are relatively small...keep that in mind when deciding on the # of portions. I doubled the amount of tomatoes and it was just right...

This is now my favorite Jambalaya recipe....next time I am adding chicken in place of or in addition to shrimp....

This was so good! Only issue was I didn't crack the lid took cook the rice so it ended up taking much longer than 45 minutes to cook. However it was worth the wait, will definitely make again.

Missing Instructions About Boiling!

This recipe is awesome. It has just the right amount of spice, and has become a new favorite around my house. The instructions left out that you need to bring your rice mixture to a boil before covering it, turning on low, and simmering for 45 minutes. If you do not bring it to a boil first, this will take more like 2 hours to cook. Even with bringing it to a boil, it takes more like an hour, just like it does when you make brown rice by itself. Other than that, this is a great recipe!

I really like the ingredients, but I had to tweak the order and timing of cooking to make the recipe work. For instance, the rice is better if cooked separately from the sausage and vegetables and the shrimp need to be added well before the final 5 minutes to cook properly and augment flavor.

OMG I LOVE Chef John! I have tried several of his recipes (his Caramel Chicken and Mac-n-cheese are also favs) and this one gets the most compliments. Delish! Made as written is terrific, but I like to substitute chicken smoked sausage to reduce fat content and use rotel instead of plain diced tomatoes because I like the extra kick. This is the BEST jambalaya recipe on the site (and I've made many). Kudos!

Well, i looked at more than one recipe- this one seemed to be key w/ ingredients... But i also followed advice of other reviewers. Came out WONDERFUL... with a few adjustments... First- ADD GARLIC! 1-2 cloves minced is perfect. I did use white rice as a preference in taste & time- minute rice added (cooked) in when adding shrimp is perfect!!  Can't really place brown rice on this one- jumbalaya is a more hearty dish & brown instead of white rice makes me feel it would not fit well. Due to spice preferences- i also added a wee bit more cayenne & pepper. Adjustments to the salt are definitely as stated! Adjust salt & peppers to taste! You don't want a salty dish (the sausage has enough salt) and you dont want a dish too spicy to eat! Adjust everything to preference. That is key to a great recipe like this. Thanks to Chef John! This is a keeper- just needs adaptation for each cook's preferences. :)

If you like HOT food you might LOVE this as written, but it was WAY too spicy-hot for us and I only used 1/4 tsp of cayenne and smoked sausage, not hot andouille. I added a squirt of tomato paste from a tube and a minced clove of garlic and it added that "something" I felt the flavor was lacking. My rice got too well done, I think it would be better to cook it seperately and add at the end or something..

this recipe is so easy and delicious. almost all of the ingredients were ones that i already had in the kitchen. i had some leftover chicken that i shredded up and threw in the pot and some extra keilbasa from a beer-tasting party i hosted. all i needed to get was a green pepper from the store. i also used leftover cooked rice and the jambalaya was ready in half the time!

Delicious!!  I pretty much followed the recipe - I may have added a little extra tomatoes.  I used chicken andouille sausage without the casing as I don't eat pork.  The only change I would suggest is the addition of tabasco sauce as I think the dish was missing a little tang...  Super easy and will go into my regular weekday dinner rotation!!

Amazingly addictive! Chef John and this recipe rocks. Doubled the recipe but closely followed as written. Used RoTel Diced Tomatoes w/ Habaneros and Aidells Cajun Style Andouille sausage, both of which added welcomed spiciness & heat. One issue in the written recipe is confusing . . . last ingredient listed is green onions. But in step 3, it instructs to stir in tomatoes, ONIONS, and other ingredients. In step 5, last direction is to garnish with green onions and seems to correspond with it being last in the ingredients list. We took a guess and added green onions in step 3. After making it, decided to watch the accompanying video. By luck, this was the intent as the video shows him reserving some of the thinly sliced green onion tops for garnish. This is among our favorite soups - - probably in top 5, and will be in our rotation file.

Yummy! Next time I'll use low sodium chicken stock or half water, as it was a little too salty.

Chef John is my new hero.  Followed Cindy18lou's suggestion of low sodium broth, but otherwise followed the recipe. Doubled easily to make for a large group and everyone loved it!

Very good recipe. I added a diced yellow pepper, a whole can of diced tomatoes and an extra half cup of chicken broth and reduced the salt by half. Even with the added liquids, it was nowhere near soupy. I also threw in a good tablespoon of chili-garlic paste and a tablespoon of dark brown sugar after tasting when I threw in the shrimp. I would probably have used molasses instead of the sugar but didn't have any on hand. 

For the person who said the portions are relatively small, this yielded almost 6lbs of jambalaya! That's 1.5 lbs per person for four servings. As cooked with the above amendments, I feel this could easily serve 6. 

Overall, high marks and thank you!

This was very yummy!  I didn't have a green bell pepper, so I has to use red, and it was great.  I used long grain brown rice, and the cook time was about an hour and a half.  Turned out great! Pretty spicy, my husband loved it!  Next time, I would have put the shrimp in earlier, but overall, great!

I made this on the first snow this year since I wanted something to warm us up. I'll say I do like this base recipe. 

I  followed the recipe (doubled)  but noticed the ingredients list had no onion except the green onion, so I added a whole medium onion with the other veggies.  I also along with the Cajun sausage  added 2lbs of chicken thighs, cubed in 1" pieces. 
This is a very easy recipe, no roux or odd ingredients so I really like it in that respect.  As I added the chicken stock and rice I nearly stopped myself, and I wish I had.  The rice is just mush really.  When I make this again, I'll leave the rice on the side, make it dirty rice probably, since adding it to the pot just made it gruel like consistency. I'll add SOME chicken stock to thin it out some for a more gravy consistency but not the full amount and no rice
I also put some scallops in for more seafood flavor and it was a great addition. 

In short, this was more soup-like, jambalaya to me should be drier than this was.   Great flavor and a good "quick"  recipe alternative for full blown gumbo but the rice addition makes it oatmeal like mush.

This was the best soup ever! I have never made jambalaya and did not have the correct sausage on hand, so I used just plain smoked sausage.  Everything else was just perfect!! If the excessive amount of cumin and paprika scare you, it is essential to the integrity of the soup to use it.  I put extra hot sauce on the side.  What a dish.  Everyone loved it.

I am very disappointed. First of all Jambalaya is not a soup. It is not gumbo. It should not be liquidy when finished. I followed the instructions and my rice was way over cooked like mush, and I had to scoop out 2 cups of liquid. That's not what jambalaya is supposed to be.

FANTASTIC !  I liked it with the brown rice. The only change I made was I used Spicy Italian Sausage that I had in the freezer left over from A SAUSAGE, PEPPER AND ONION dish I cooked. I also added 1 cup of OKRA cut in 1/4 inch pieces. Definitely will cook this again.

Although it was quite tasty, it was a pain getting there and the recipe is misleading.  I used the brown rice that the recipe called for and at the 45 minute mark the rice was extremely crunchy.  I then started to add on cooking time in 10 minute increments until the rice got to a state that was edible.  I think in total the rice cooking time took about an hour and a half, double what the recipe called for.  By that time the liquid had been absorbed and the dish was a tasty stew.  The shrimp cooked quickly thereafter.  I also ended up using 12 ounces of sausage (3 sausages).

This was a very flavorful dish. Mad my own shrimp stock with the shells, and used it in place of the chicken stock. Awesome!

I am by all means no jambalaya expert but thought this was wonderful. I doubled the recipe and added 1 tbsp or so of homemade reduced salt Cajun season. Followed everything else exact.  Used brown rice and cooked 55 mins because it felt a little "crunchy" but decided maybe that's the way brown rice is suppose to be. I actually loved the texture the rice gave it. I was worried after reading other recipes that had so much more spices but chose this one because of the video and reviews. It was perfectly seasoned.  Highly recommend you try it.

Followed the recipe exactly. By 45 minutes the rice was still crunchy. I even let it come to a boil before turning down to simmer. I let everything but the shrimp cook for a total of and hour and a 1/2, at least and the rice finally softened up. I recommend leaving out half the veggies till half the cooking time is past, so you get a little crunch from the peppers. I might even reduce the broth to 2 1/2 cups to make it closer to actual jambalaya, without letting it simmer for hours. I will use this recipe again, but with some changes.

Excellent and easy! I made a few adjustments from the beginning. I used olive oil, 2 cans of diced tomatoes with garlic and onions, added 1/2 C extra rice, used chicken broth, and did not add any salt. I would surely make this again.

Very good! Made as shown, except: used sweet Italian sausage, didn't have cayenne pepper so used 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes. Used uncle bens short grain brown rice and like others had to cook a little longer than stated. Also used lower sodium chicken broth. Will definitely make again!

Really did anyone who reviews this really make it?  Ok, the the dish was tasty enough after I made modifications,  let’s get the obvious faults out of the way. The ingredient list has no onions.  How the heck can you do you make the trinity without the primary ingredient.  The instructions do say to add onion . Instructions ingredient list mis match.  Not the first time on the internet.  Second issue.  You are suppose to toss in the trinity with the tomatoes etc and as the recipe is written, add the rice and stock.  I could not bear not to sautéed the the onions , celery and peppers . So I did for 10 minutes.  I probably should have done for another 15.   Ok, I sub white rice for brown as I was out of brown.  I cut the liquid back for the .5 to 1 rice to water ratio for white rice,  I had to add a lot more.  Yes this was spicey and I don’t mind that. I keep my spices fresh and my cayenne is potent.  The killer on this recipe is the amount of cumin.  I hesitated when I saw the amount but, let’s make as written,.  If I had followed my instinct , this might have been decent jambalaya. As is, it was a good dish, but jambalaya it was not. Even after sautéing th trinity, the celery and peppers were a little too crunchy.  The cumin kind of over powered the dish.  I like cumin in my Indian, Tex-Mex and Mexican cooking, not so much in my creole/Cajun. 

Made as written this recipe would have been a complete disaster

I made the recipe exactly as posted and it was very good. I was hesitant about the amount of paprika but it is perfect. i did not add additional stock and am happy I didn't as it was not as thick as expected. Will make this again and probably invite company to share.

I loved this recipe. I made some substitutions to accommodate the ingredients I had/didn't have: I used long grain rice instead of brown rice; cooked it for 20 minutes and then 5 minutes with the shrimp; used Vidalia onion instead of green onions; added two chopped cloves of garlic; didn't have Andouille, but used some leftover pepperoni. The rest of the recipe remained the same. It was D.E.L.I.C.I.O.U.S.

After shelling the shrimp, I heated the shells in butter for 1 min. then poured the chicken stock over and simmered for 20 minutes, no need to waste good shrimp shells! This is what I strained and added to the mixture when it was time to add the chicken stock. We prefer white rice, so used a long-grain white and cooked it for 30 minutes. Added the raw shrimp, stirred and cooked for 5 more. Perfection!

I usually make a recipe exactly to spec the first time out, but my culinary muse was in a wild mood for this recipe: double shrimp, more sausage, okra, smoked paprika, shrimp paste, chipotle chiles in adobo sauce, pureed tomatoes — oh my!  Chef John's recipe was a great springboard.

Is 1 tablespoon Cumin correct?  I made it with the amount indicated and it is way too much.  I had to dilute it with additional tomato sauce.  Cumin has an earthy aroma and taste and if you reduce the amount to 1 teaspoon, it would be better.  I love spicy foods, however, that amount of Cumin almost ruined the recipe.

love all Chef John recipes
Since I was looking for a gumbo recipe with andouille sausage and shrimp, I added okra, garlic and some olive oil and pour over rice (aside). Delicious !!!!

The flavor of this dish was amazing!  It was so tasty-- I had seconds. I just happen to have chorizos (Spanish sausage) and that was the only change. I thought that the paprika was too much but I trust Chef John so much that I used 3 tablespoons of paprika. Chef John was so right. It was just perfect. I can't wait to make this for company very soon. Thanks, Chef John.

Loved this recipe. Quick to assemble and super flavourful. I did make one change, I used Jasmin rice instead of brown rice as such I reduced the cooking time to 20 mins and it was perfect. Next time I make this I will reduce cayenne pepper slightly as my 9 year old found it spicy.

The thing that makes this recipe so wonderful is the brown rice vs. white rice.  The texture of the brown rice takes you right down to New Orleans .   Thank you Chef John for sharing your recipe.  PS, I add a little extra stock to make sure there is sauce on the end.

Yummy!   I followed the recipe, except used red pepper instead of green and creole seasoning instead of cayenne.  Next time I will follow  advice in other reviews and will cook the rice separately (it took much longer than an hour) and I'll reduce the salt.

I don't normally rate recipes if I change them, but Chef John's basic recipe was so good, I gave him 5 stars. Only changes I made: added chicken breast chunks and used chorizo instead of andouille. Excellent!

Very flavorful. I did add more ingredients. I added 1 can of sweet corn, 1 can of crab meat, 1 can of minced clams with juice from the can. The spices have a lil heat but not overpowering. My 10 year old was able to eat it. Next time I will either soak the brown rice prior to using it try another type of rice. The brown rice was too grainy for my liking. After cooking for 1hr it seemed as some of the grain didn't soften.

This was great! They forgot regular onion in the ingredients, but talk about it in the directions. I added 1/2 onion. I also used jasmine rice because it was what I had. First time reviewing anything, but this was worth writing about.

I make jambalaya about twice a year, everyone in my family loves it. I decided to try a new recipe this time, wow, so glad I did. I usually struggle with tomato products/liquid and the consistency of the rice. This was so much easier and came out perfect, spicy and delicious with no struggling at all. Thanks for the great addition to my recipe box.

This is definitely a keeper! I added 4 cloves minced garlic withe the veges, Rotel for the tomatoes and Aidelles chicken andouille sausage, substituted minced onion for the green onion & used 2 precooked Hinode brown jasmine rice trays for the brown rice.  I added a bag of frozen okra just before the shrimp. We loved it!

The flavor is OK and the rice turned to mush and the sausage and rice burned while it was simmering (on low!!!)

This was very good!  I followed the recipe exact - except I also added some chicken.  We thoroughly enjoyed this for our dinner, with a loaf of rosemary bread.  Had a bottle of Riesling, which went well with this.  We also added Cajun seasoning to it at the table for some more heat and flavor.  I'm so glad there's enough left over for my lunch tomorrow!

Yummy and easy. I didn't have shrimp, so I used chicken sausage only. I also didn't have diced tomatoes on hand, so I added a 1/2 cup of a nice, organic spaghetti sauce in its place. I replaced the green pepper with a red pepper, again, what I had on hand. I honesty don't think you could mess this lovely, easy Jambalya up! Thanks for the great recipe Chef John! I will make is as directed next time! I'm sure it will only be that much more tasty!

Made it again. It was great with all the right ingredients too!

This was one of the best new things I've made in a long time. Had to remind my husband not to eat any more lest he make himself sick. It was really good. Followed recipe exactly, but threw in a handful of ready-grilled chicken breast (just because it felt right) and only tomatoes I had--a can of stewed tomatoes. Perfect. Cooked in exactly 45 minutes as promised (I can't figure out the 2 hour experiences--ours was perfect, and I just used regular old brown rice). Thanks Chef John !!!

I made this today and it was fantastic! Loved the recipe, was not too difficult and followed the instructions pretty closely. I will be definitely be making this again - next time I will substitute the brown rice for white rice which probably goes better with the dish. I will also add less stock, maybe 2.5 cups of stock instead of three. And lastly, the portions where pretty small, next time I will increase the amount of ingredients so that there will be more left over.

The taste of the Jambalaya was absolutely fantastic, I will make it again. For sure.

This was very good but we thought it was a little on the extra spicey side. I would scale back the cayenne just a smidge then serve with hot sauce for those who like the extra kick.

This is a delicious recipe. I cooked the sausage separately and then drained it on paper towels. It cut back on the grease without decreasing the flavor.Thanks Chef John.

I liked this, but will probably not make it again.  I put the brown rice in and mine took 2 hours to cook.  If I do make this again, I will cook the rice separately and then add it to the dish.  It's also possible you have to add the rice, bring the pot to a boil and then turn to low.  I used brown rice, as the receipe stated, so not sure why it didn't work out for me.  This dish is pretty spicy as written, so take that into account if you are dealing with eaters who can't handle a lot of heat.

I made a roasted chicken. Short story is I was running late asked hubby for help and as a result dusted the entire chicken and veggies with the other dark red powder, cayenne! My roasted chickenis turned into soup at the end. I was a little faint of heart when it came to turning an overly cayenne encrusted chicken into soup! It seemed to me that Jambalaya may work, though it was a step from traditional, but I knew the cayenne, cumin, and paprika would be fine on the chicken as well. So I bravely pressed forward.
   Andouille sausage and short grain brown rice are apparently hard to find where I live. So I used a smoked pork kielbasa and long grain rice. I used 50% less sodium fat free broth, I omitted the salt added in the recipe. So it was sausage, chicken and shrimp. It was amazing. Everyone took second helpings and the chicken worked without issue (If for instance you don’t like shrimp or want to make it very heart healthy and get rid of the sausage which was my only demon in this.) Basically any and all three meats work fine with the spice load! Definitely a keeper recipe! And a great changeable recipe when you need it! 
Chef John...No nonsense cooking for no nonsense people. Aren't we all sick to death of grown male chefs that behave like 12 year old female drama queens!I know I am! There are a host of general good and basic cooking skills you can learn from Chef John. I have several of his recipes, never been disappointed. He's so relaxing I could listen to him forever!

I love love LOVE this recipe!! I have made this at least 5 times now. I have a no salt Cajun seasoning that I use along with low sodium chicken broth. The first time I made it, it was too salty. And the brown rice is best, I love the nutty flavor it gives and I love the texture. I used white rice in a pinch once, and I didn't care for it.   Oh, and once everything is in the pot, bring to a boil before simmering. Otherwise you are looking more at 1-2 hours of cook time...

Update: This base works great too when you have other meats you need to use up. My favorite is using leftovers after baking a ham. Very good recipe, and can be modified in a myriad of ways and still taste great!

Only change I made was to add 1-1/2 chicken breasts at the beginning - added to butter a couple minutes before adding sausage. This was delicious and will be making again.

What can I say?  Another hit from Chef John!  This one I made as written with the only exception being the use of white rice as that's what I had on hand.  I wouldn't change a thing with this recipe!  I used Johnsonville's Andouille sausage. Delicious!  Thanks again Chef John for this recipe!

This recipe had good flavor but it came out far too salty, even though I used homemade stock (which has so much less salt than regular canned broth). It was so salty that I had trouble eating it and will probably just toss out the leftovers. I would recommend leaving out the teaspoon of salt and just tasting it at the end of cooking to see if any needs to be added. Mine was also much soupier than I expected so I will probably only use 2 cups of stock if I try making it again; it took a long time to cook enough of the liquid out for it to be easily edible.

This was a great recipe! I never leave a recipe alone and I made some adaptations. I used Italian hot and sweet sausage because that's what I had. I also added a chopped jalapeno and left the seeds in plus a dash or two of Crystal hot sauce for some more heat. I used half wild rice and added earlier and then added half brown rice at the end. This was delicious, I will certainly make it again!

Oh my, this was wonderful!!  I added some chopped garlic when I was browning the sausage (cuz I think garlic should be in everything), and some sweet onion to the rest of the vegies and it turned out great!  This is a delicious recipe that can be tweaked to appeal to many tastes, I will definately be making this again.

Made this recipe last night and the family LOVED it. I made a few changes just based on personal tastes and what I had on hand. 
-I used sweet Italian sausage instead of Andouille because I had some leftover in the freezer
-I used 1 chicken breast, cubed, since my husband doesnt care for shrimp
-used about 2 1/2 cups brown minute rice
-used 1 full can of petite diced tomatoes
-Used 1 medium sweet onion instead of green

Other than those basic changes, I left the recipe as is and was pleasantly surprised. I added some cajun seasoning to my portion (family doesnt like spicy, I do) but it had the perfect stew-like consistancy and flavor. I liked being able to do it all in one pot. The kitchen smelled wonderful too!
Definitely a make-again!

Amazing flavor!  The perfect mix of heat and sweet; salty and spicy.  The only change I made was using white rice.  I didn't have brown on-hand, and it turned out wonderful.  It took 35 minutes with the white rice and the shrimp were perfect in the 5 minutes suggested. Love Chef John's recipes and videos...and this is one of my favorites!

Fantastic!  Made some changes to vegetarianize the dish: used Gimme Lean "sausage" instead of andouille; used kale instead of peppers, added 1.5 cups brown rice; 3 cups vegetable stock; 1 cup tomato; and added red beans last 10 minutes instead of shrimp.  My husband (major meat eater) LOVED this dish!  Everything other ingredient and measurement was the same.  When eating leftovers, added 1/3 avacado, diced--amazing.  Thank you Chef John!

Great! I made this last night and the whole family loved it. It was super easy. I had to sub a couple of things (used basmati instead of brown and left out the green pepper), but it was very easy to adapt. Will definitely make again!

This was really good, although not as stew-like as I had hoped. It may have needed to cook a bit longer, and used less liquid to get that heavy, thick consistency one expects from jambalaya. The flavor was right on, though!

I've made this once, and I followed the recipe exactly.  The results were AMAZING!  I had chicken sausage on-hand, so I substituted and it worked great!

2 minor shortcuts and different rice: had to use Zatarain's Creole seasoning instead of the listed seasonings (had too much of the stuff, had to start using it) but it has most of the same things, plus a couple others and SALT. Used 16oz frozen cooked peeled deveined shrimp that I thawed ahead, reduced shrimp cooking time to about 3 minutes. Used long grain white rice, what I had on hand.  Followed everything else, even cooking times, and it was EXCELLENT - better than the jambalaya I had 2 weeks ago at a 'New Orleans' style restaurant!

This was excellent.  I left out the shrimp and used poblano peppers instead of bell peppers.  Also added extra fresh tomatoes, celery, plus one shredded carrot.  I'll definitely make this again.

I used Shiritake "rice" to cut the starch (blood sugar) content and did do the optional shrimp.  It worked out very much as described despite the substitution.

This was so, so good!  My husband loved it.  I made the recipe just like the directions, except I used avocado oil instead of butter, and added 1 tbsp of Worcestershire.  Just delicious!!  I’m a pretty good cook and not usually in love with recipes, but this one was really wonderful.

Rice was no way cooked in 45 minutes! I suggest that you cook the brown rice separately and add it to the other ingredients at the same time as you add the shrimp. The dish is quite spicy but I think that depends on the spice of the sausage. This makes a big serving. The two of us ended up eating it over three nights. It is wonderful with good bread.

Excellent recipe.  I have made a lot of Jambalaya, and this the best recipe yet.  I used smoked ham instead of sausage, as I was trying to use up leftovers.  Otherwise, followed recipe as directed.  Very, very good.  Plus, my husband loved it!

Tasty, easy dish...used ingredients I had on hand, so chili powder instead of cayenne, smoked sausage instead of andouille(sp), sprouted rice instead of brown. I used 14 oz. can of diced tomatoes instead of 1/2 cup called for.
Will make it again.

Better than I expected.  The brown rice was interesting, but I did have to google the texture of cooked brown rice to verify I hadn’t under cooked it.

I really was disappointed in this. I followed the recipe as stated. The cumin was strong in the recipe and really made it taste like chili. Also I think it needs some onion and chicken. I won't make it again.

I sautés the sausage, then removed and browned some chicken cubes.  Added the sausage in and continued with recipe.  So delicious!!!  As per some of the reviews they said it would be a bit soupy...  to counter act that I cracked the lid halfway through.

I liked this recipe. I followed one cook's advice and cooked the rice separate so it wouldn't be too heavy. I also used a cajun blend I had in place of all the spices, I found 1 rounded TBS was adequate for my taste. I also added an extra dash of cumin. No leftovers! (good and bad!)

this is a really great recipe. I avoid the celery since I'm allergic and usually add some green Chile in with the vegetables for some extra spice and flavor. always turns out wonderfully although it usually takes more time for me to fully cook the brown rice.

I did use the brown rice, and if you're at altitude, (5000' here), it takes a LOT more liquid and a LOT more time for the rice to become tender. I used tomato/chicken bullion and it was great.

I have a very unfortunate pork allergy and substituted with chicken.  I also grabbed chicken broth instead of stock. I doubled the recipe for lots of leftovers and WOW! It turned out PHENOMENAL!!! Even cold!!!

EASY!! And quite good:) Next time we agreed we should use canned tomatoes since using fresh didn’t lend enough tomatoey base to it. Also, I used long grained white rice since I prefer it.

I had jalapeno sausage I needed to use, so I omited the cayenne and it was super tasty! one change I will make next time is to add the veggies a little later, after I add the rice and broth. They just got way too mushy and were kind of pointless when overcooked.

This recipe makes a great base template for jambalaya with whatever ingredients are on hand. No sausage? Use chicken breasts instead, cut into large chunks. No green onion? Use yellow, red, or white onion instead. No celery? Substitute another aromatic — like a big handful of cilantro, rough chopped, stems and all. Then, instead of plain salt, use celery salt to season. The spices really make this dish, so don't skimp. If smoked paprika is on hand, use it to add more complexity to the stew. If the pantry happens to hold Mexican-Style diced tomatoes, put those added flavors into the pot instead of plain diced tomatoes. The brown rice is excellent — use it if you've got it, make it plain old white rice if you don't. It's a versatile dish that lends itself well to adaptation with whatever is available. This is, after all, what jambalaya is all about!

I thought this dish tasted very good, although I did cut the spices in half. I don't understand the complaints about the dish being soupy. Two cups of the stock was absorbed by the rice, unless of course you are using cooked rice. (In which case you are not following the recipe)

I loved the seasonings.  I added some zucchini that I sauteed in some minced garlic and butter. I added it towards the end with the shrimp which had been precooked. It did have to cook a full hour for the rice to be done. My zucchini was a little too over cooked so I will have to consider that next time.

Very yummy dish and very easy to make. I added a little more rice into mine because i felt it was soupy, but other than that i will definitely be making this again. It heats up well as a leftover too.

I have another jambalaya recipe I have used from this site for years. However, I have tried and enjoyed several of Chef John's other recipes. So, after looking at the spices, I was excited to try this one. Unfortunately,  it was pretty much a miss for me! I will go back to my original (Bubba's recipe from this site) from now on. Because we have a lot of people to feed, I doubled the recipe. The brown rice was not my favorite in this as I don't feel like added, but rather took away from the flavors. The spices were actually overpowering and we LOVE spicy at our house. I'm hoping my family will eat this, and afraid I may end up throwing a bunch of it out.

Jambalaya lends itself to substitutions.  I did not follow the recipe to the letter by using the sausages and seafood I had in the fridge BUT the basis provided including the veg, spicing, cooking methods will bring me back to using this recipe  again and again.  Simple but tasty!  What more can you ask.
PS:  I am confident an all veg option would be great too.

I liked the consistency of this recipe; a bit firmer than what is normally served at restaurants. The recipe is generally simple and not as labor intensive a recipe as with chicken. I tried both brown rice and good ol' Uncle Ben's and either turned out well.  Really lovely flavor!

This was so easy to make, and really good. I only had basmati rice and yellow and red bell peppers on hand, so that's what I used this time. I mixed the cumin, paprika, and cayenne together before I had second thoughts about using that much cayenne and cumin, so I only used 4 tablespoons of the mix (it would have been 5 and 1/3 tablespoons had I used the entire mix) and it had just the right heat for my wimpy family. 
Next  time I'll use green bell pepper and brown rice as written, but still decrease the three spices to see how it turns out. The yellow and red peppers did add nice color variation, though.

This was excellent.  The only thing I did different was mix sweet and spicy sausage for more kick and cooked the rice separately.  A lot of wonderful flavors in this dish.

Excellent. Pretty rich tasting. Fills you up quickly. Unfortunately, as I was carrying the last bowl down to the den to finish it, the bowl slipped out of my hand and shattered at the bottom of the stairs. Went everywhere. :+(       I will definitely make this again.

Great base recipe which allows for some tweaking to suit the individual. I increased the spices and added some chilli powder, bit more tomatoes, a yellow pepper, Spanish onion, and a large shallot. Cooked the veggies and sausage with sesame oil instead of butter. Cooked the rice separately with the chicken broth.

Sauteed chicken instead of shrimp,  used white rice (didn't have brown, but would taste great in this recipe). Used 1/4 tsp of Cayenne to make more family friendly... Had a nice kick still which I loved, but still too spicy for my 8 yo.

Very good. Followed almost exact except used a 15 ounce can of chopped tomatoes and forgot bay leaf. Taste was excellent. I agree with others about letting it come to a boil before covering the rice.  I did and think my rice still could have used another 10 minutes. But overall no complaints. Spicy and delicious on a wintry night

So tasty. I added summer sqaush...zucchini would work, too. Great with brocolli too...great with veggies. Chicken sausage worked well. Rotel tomotoes, though I had to tone the heat down a bit with some cream of chicken soup...my husband does not eat "hot and spicey."

Great recipe.  I added a medium yellow onion 4 cloves of garlic and a can of diced tomatoes.  I did add the rice, but if I made it again I will cook rice on the side,  shrimp cooked for about 10 minutes. Overall very good

A good base for a recipe but not one I'd use again without some major changes. It's not exactly BAD but it's also not GREAT and definitely not what I'd say a jambalaya should taste like. In all, honestly, if you want a jambalaya I'd suggest trying out another recipe on this site and taking a pass on this one.

The two biggest issues were too much salt and too much liquid. I'd probably cut the initial salt by half to start with and then add more to taste before throwing in the shrimp because you can add but you can't take it away and it was far too salty. Also I followed the directions exactly and even cooking it an extra ten minutes with the lid off at the end wasn't enough to reduce the liquid to a reasonable amount. I would reduce the liquid added by half a cup next time and see if that's enough.

For seasoning I'd probably halve the cumin because it was overpowering and maybe add some thyme.

Also be aware that five minutes is not enough time to cook the shrimp on low heat so you can set the timer to five minutes and then keep watch over them until they're cooked through. Mine took about 10 minutes.

Other than that I would also change some of the vegetables and proportions. Rather than green onions I'd switch to maybe half of a regular onion since I have those on-hand more often and I didn't notice a significant flavor change from using the green. I'd add some extra of the bell peppers and celery and maybe even some carrots as well since they soak up flavor so well.

This is a good recipe as is. I followed the directions for all except that I used a red pepper instead of a green pepper. I this would be good with less meat and shrimp for the same amount of sauce and rice. We enjoyed the spiciness and will definitely make it again.

I will definitely make this meal again. Great winter meal!  The changes I made were to saute a cup of chopped onions with the sausage and add a teaspoon of minced fresh garlic. Also, I cooked the rice separately and so did not need the chicken broth.

I used hot turkey sausage to cut fat. I added 1 cup of tomatoes instead of 1/2. Little less cumin and used white rice that I cooked separately and added in the last 5 minutes. Wonderful recipe.

Super easy prep.  Added three cloves garlic , thin sliced red onion and subbed white rice in place of brown rice.  ( Other wise followed recipe).This cut the cooking time down to about 20 minutes before adding the shrimp. I will definitely be making this again.

Made as directed, omitted the salt and cayenne for the kids and added a little extra shrimp.   Next time, I'll use 2 3/4 chicken stock.  Would be easy to sub any meats you want such as chicken, chunks of halibut, crawfish, etc....

This receipe was fantastic!!! Naturally I had to make a few revisions... Doubled the recipe (who doesn't want leftovers?!?!?!!!) Used a 27oz can of crushed tomatoes instead of diced, added 2 tblp of garlic powder, and added chicken (3 breasts sliced and added at the same time as sausage).  As another reviewer mentioned, bring it to a boil before you cover it, this is a must! Cooked for close to an hour and a half, but SOOOO worth the wait! It was delicious!

Definitely a solid foundational recipe! I recommend doing it as-is FIRST, then adding your own variations after that (with the exception of doing white rice first, brown is just weird :)

Here's what I'll change next time...

* White rice instead of brown (and cook 20 min instead of 45)
* 1/2 cup rice instead of 1 cup - personal preference
* 1.5 cups stock instead of 3, because of above
* More vegetables (I added zucchini, will also add garlic & onion next time)
* Add shrimp in with 8 minutes left

Delicious!  I just love Chef John's recipes!  Followed recipe almost exact, with the exception of doubling the fresh chopped tomatoes and adding  fresh chicken tender meat chopped up after the seasonings were added.  Did I just make gumbo-laya? maybe.... Regardless,  it was delicious with margaritas on the side!

I have made this recipe a dozen times and I love it.  I usually add a little more sausage than strictly necessary because it is so good. I also usually white rice because I always have plenty and it still tastes great.

Not very complicated to make and tasted great! We used white rice (since it's what we had on hand) and adjusted the cooking time accordingly and it was excellent. Who knew you could get so much flavor from just a few spices?

Loved it!!! I adapted it for the crockpot but kept the ingredients  the same, except I added a splash of white wine and gave it a dash of cajun spice when I plated it. Rave reviews from my guests. Husband said it tasted like something he would order from our loca creole restaurant. Thanks Chef!

Heeding other reviews I made the rice separately and used Basmati. I used one onion and added one jalapeno. I didn't bother with the bayleaf and used San Marzano canned tomatoes. It was spicy and good just the way jambalaya should be.

Only fair.  I think there are many better Jambalaya recipes out there.  Matter of fact I made a better one today!  Love Chef John but this is not his best.

It wasn't bad. Not at all. But it just didn't have the depth of flavor you get when you make the stock with a bunch of ham hocks and a whole chicken and use bacon fat to make the roux. Of course, this version is less likely to kill you outright, so that's something.

I used chorizo rather than andouille sausage, and added minced garlic, garlic salt, curry seasoning, 1 can Rotel tomoatoes with chilis, chipotle seasoning, and 5 finely diced basil leaves. It created a very small spicy kick but was excellent!

I followed the recipe and it turned out very nice. I would say the spices make the heat between mild and medium, so adjust accordingly. Next time I will add a bit more cream as it was fairly thick. Did not even notice the lack of meat. I will make again for sure. (and it is fairly quick to put together)

Suuuper delicious! We added some more hot sauce to make it spicier, other than that the recipe was perfect for us.

Made it for my husband just before lent.  He told me it was great.  Just the right mix of seasonings.  Just the right amount of heat.  It was easy to make.  I may put a little more sausage in it next time.

I made this excellent recipe for 16 people (I made two batches of 8 servings each to keep the seasoning balanced) and it was delicious!  It was easy, great flavors, and everyone loved it!  Even better the next day!

Great recipe!  I didn't have celery or green onion so I skipped that and had two pounds of shrimp that needed to be used and it turned out great. I fried up a small regular onion with the sausage. Had to add at least another cup of broth as the rice cooked and definitely have to cook it long enough for the rice to soften - I went 50 minutes at least. It was so yummy. Next time adding chicken and cubed ham and decrease shrimp. 2lbs was a little much but still good. Used half brown rice and half basmati - would not recommend as they cook up differently. White was done earlier but brown was not. I think brown is the way to go - more hearty.

I don’t like to use butter in my meals so I skipped the butter/sausage step. I simply tossed the chopped veggies in a pot, added the tomato an spices and let simmer for a few minutes and finally added the rice and the chicken stock. A way healthier version with all the flavour!

Loved the flavors and the heat from the sausage & cayenne. Never thought I'd make Jambalaya from scratch but I can honestly say now this will be the only way I make it from now on!  Made exactly as written.  Another great recipe from Chef John! Thank you!

Made it exactly as written, but wished I had read some reviews first.   1.  It really is way too salty.   2.  The brown rice wasn't finished cooking at 45 minutes, so I went an extra 15 minutes.  It is a bit soupy still.  Next time, I'll cut the salt by at least half (if not altogether) and use white rice instead of brown, and will likely cut the cayenne pepper in half as well, but that's just a matter of preference.

Great recipe.  Quite easy to make and everyone found it very tasty with just the right amount of kick. The brown rice was a big hit. I did add some some tomato sauce (passada) which worked well and I will add in the future.

Garlic powder addition is a nice bonus.  If you don't have shrimp, tilapia seems to do well in the dish.

Substituted Smoked Beef Sausage for the Andouille in preference to family members who don't like it so spicy. Used instant brown rice and shortened cooking time. Still came out great!

DE-LISH!!  I used a little too much cayenne pepper which made it a little too spicy so I added a Tbl spoon of cream and lemon juice to bring down the spice.  It was so good, we barely have any leftover in our family of 4.

So delicious & easy to make! Used prepackaged smoked turkey sausage, frozen uncooked shrimp but I didn’t have Creole seasoning so used Cajun instead. Also got to utilize my cast iron Dutch oven which is always a treat. The dish was pretty spicy to my family but they still devoured it and my husband even had seconds! I will probably use half the Cajun spice (1/2tsp instead of 1tsp) But I wouldn’t change anything else. Lots of flavor and a perfect cold weather dish. It’s so filling that I didn’t have to serve it with anything else! Thank you O.P for this fantastic recipe :)

Great flavor, the only change I made was cutting the cayenne pepper in half because I husband doesn’t like really spicy food. Recipe does not make a lot, I thought with a pound of shrimp and half a pound of sausage it would be more. It’s probably enough for 3 people.

This is my go-to recipe for jambalaya. It’s quick, easy and delicious. (I use quick cooking rice so it goes faster.)  I usually make exactly as written but tonight I swapped out the sausage for leftover ham. Awesome! Another winner from Chef John!

We used sweet onion instead of green, added garlic and precooked the rice as others recommended. cooked 15 min added shrimp and cooked 5 more minutes. very filling and satisfying for a cold night.  I'd make it again-fairly simple and tasty.

I made this for dinner.  By accident.  I used a 14.5 oz. can of diced tomatoes with the juice.  I cut the cayenne pepper by half, and I forgot to add additional salt or pepper.  I needed to add the remainder of the can of chicken stock to keep it moist enough. I didn't need to cook it for 45 minutes.  I cooked it just until the rice was done.  Mike and I loved it.  He told me several times after dinner to be sure I saved this in my favorites.  Then he suggested I start a new file called Mike and Dee's favorites and only put the really special recipes like this one in there.

Excellent! I actually followed the recipe to a T!  Question though, it says to add the onion and  green onion.  Is there supposed to be onion in this?  Recipe is missing boiling instructions for rice - just bring to boil before simmering with lid on.  Measurements are perfect! I even added the shrimp frozen to the mixture.  Definitely will make again!

I've made this twice and was very pleased both times.  However, in my effort to keep it low carb I decided to substitute riced cauliflower and added the last 5 minutes of simmering with the shrimp.   The recipe is definitely a house favorite!

Delicious! I used a shredded rotisserie chicken in place of the shrimp and added garlic. all else I did as directed. it was perfectly seasoned and not soupy at all. I served cornbread muffins on the side.

I doubled the cayenne because we like spicy. Very easy to make and delicious. Was even better the next day as leftovers.
Thank you for sharing this recipe:)

I used a white onion in place of green onion, and a hot Italian sausage (couldn't find andouille). The paprika, cumin, cayenne spice balance is perfect in this recipe, spicy, but not overaggressive.

Great just the way it is! Since I'm not too thrilled with green peppers but understand they're an integral part of creole cuisine, I used half of one.   I also added shredded carrots, about half a cup.  Thanks Chef John!

Delicious!  I used a little less of the spices because I used rotel tomatoes.  Uncle Ben's brown rice I used only required 20 min. to cook.  I browned the sausage, took it out of the pan and put it back in at the end.

My husband & I both loved this recipe ,will definitely make again. I used chicken andouille sausage to cut back calories and fat. Do not expect the rice to be cooked in 45 minutes it took much longer.

I added chicken breast pieces because I had thawed them, and used a can of diced tomatoes.   Next time plan another 15 minutes and hold the chicken for the first 20 min to half an hour.  I used 1 tablespoons of paprika and it was plenty.  Not for the faint of palate!  Oh yeah, found andouille sausage at Winco!   2019  notes:  made as written but had a surprise lack of paprika, so I left it out and added just a shame of garlic powder.  Used fresh tomato.  The fam gobbled it up!

Yummmmm.  This was the first time I tried making Jambalaya.  There is a lot going on in this dish.  Unbelievable flavors and textures.  It's got a snap to it but not too hot.  I cooked the rice separately to make sure it was thoroughly cooked and doubled the tomatoes and added some cubed chicken.  My husband and I loved it and will definitely make this again.

The seasoning was good (although I did add a little Cajun seasoning too). But I wish it had more vegetables. I put in extra of what was called for, but it wasn't until I was done shopping that my mom reminded me okra is good in it too & maybe jalapeno. Next time I'll modify...

I used smoked paprika and wished I hadn't. Overall it was just okay. I did as some others suggested and pre cooked the rice and used 1/2 of the broth. I probably won't make this again.

Turned out really good. I did use the brown rice. It took longer then 45 minutes to cook the rice. A little more then an hour.

This is a wonderful jambalaya. Because we like spicy foods, I added McCormick Creole Seasoning and increased the cayenne to 3/4 teaspoon. I also used Uncle Ben's white rice because that's what I had on hand, and decreased the cooking time.  At the end, I added the shrimp, covered the pot and set it aside to let the shrimp steam.  So easy and SO good!  Chef John has never failed to impress!

Very tasty but the rice was too mushy for my liking. I will definitely make it again because the flavour was great but will reduce the liquid (stock) by about a cup and a half.

Hi, first time making Jambalaya and I was way surprised how easy it is!  This recipe rocks, did cut down on spicey and substituted Old Bay for cayenne and only half on cumin, but I thought it was delish ! ! !  will definitely make it again and will add okra just to give it a try. The great thing is you can add bits of veggies and doesn't take away from the wow flavor !

This was spicy and delicious.  I didn't use bell peppers, as my husband is allergic. And I used unsalted broth. It was still excellent.  The only thing I'd add next time is more rice. This is going to be on my favorites list for sure.

Cumin? Ugh. Between the cumin and paprika it tasted like chili. It was inedible, but it wasn't very good at all.

I made this as more of a hearty soup. I added chicken along with more tomatoes. Of course, I increased the stock to get a soupy consistency. Delicious!  Thank you, Chef John.

Very good. Suggestion...Remove the shell from the shrimp tail before adding it to the mixture so you don't have to peel it off when eating the dish.

Loved it! I just added more chicken broth and brown rice to make more... I was concerned that the rice would take a long time so I kept the temperature up longer and watched it.

Remember to bring the chicken broth to a boil before turning it down to low to cook the rice. I used two pounds of shrimp, twice the amount of tomatoes,about 12 oz. of sausage and doubled the amount of onions. Really enjoyed the taste!

I made this to the recipe unfortunately it was very bland with a weak taste. Next time i plan to add 2 TBSP Hickory BBQ sauce, 1 TBSP Worchester sauce and 1 TSP red chilli flakes. That will make it more interesting.

The only changes I made were to double the tomatoes like another review suggested and let the mixture with rice come to a full boil before covering and simmering. My whole family loved this. I will definitely make it again!

Best recipe for jambalaya I have ever used. Right amount of spice, rice, chicken and sausage. I have always precooked rice, and did in this recipe, using the stock that I cooked chicken in.  Besides that, used this recipe. A very satisfying meal, and pretty simple to follow.

Tasted good. Used rendered bacon fat instead of butter and sauteed some garlic before I threw in the sausage. I might use less chicken stock next time (or more rice) as it came out a little too soupy for my tastes, but overall it was a big hit with the family!

VERY good!!   I used a full 14 oz. link of sausage. and Red bell pepper instead of green. (taste preference).   I also added one half of a sweet onion, chopped and a "box" of fresh baby spinach.

Fantastic, made some changes due to available ingredients, subbed chorizo for the andouille, added bay scallops and cooked bbq'd chicken, added corn niblets and sliced okra(1/4in slices) and pearl onions

I Loved It!  I made a big pot of it with the addition of chicken breast chunks.  I also did not season the vegetables and I used white instead of brown rice (preference). I seasoned the shrimp and chicken before adding to the pot.  I will for sure prepare this recipe again. Thanks Chef John! :>

I used regular old smoked sausage because I didn't have any other sausage on hand. Still came out spicy and amazing. Good comfort food.

Super good but spiiiiicy!!! Substituted chorizo for the andouille and diced two fresh (Jersey) tomatoes for canned; stayed with the brown rice and added a chicken breast. I loved it but need to cut back a bit on the paprika, cumin and cayenne for hubby. Definately a keeper.

I kept the seasonings the same but doubled everything else. Added 2 cans of whole corn drained and 2 lbs Boneless chicken thighs (cut into cubes). Served with Garlic bread and a simple salad.

Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great. Had just returned from a vacation in New Orleans and hoped to duplicate what my husband ate and loved from NOLA restaurants. He said mine was even better!! #victory!

So good...I've made this a number of times and we love it. Sometimes, I use Andouille, sometimes, Italian because my butcher doesn't have andouille. I add chicken, and sausage AND shrimp at times. It's a dish to have a lot of fun with. Just follow Chef Johns steps to maximize flavor, like when to add the cumin, paprika and cayenne.

Awesome Recipe - I like to add more rice, diced tomatoes and stock to give me a bit larger servings (lunches for the week). Would also recommend dicing up your sausage rather than larger chunks as the flavours don't seem to penetrate the larger pieces and take away from the dish.  I've made this at least five times now, and love it each time.

We doubled the recipe and they ate it all!   We subbed chicken for shrimp (food allergy) and it was delicious!  Next time, I'll make it a day before to let the flavors blend longer.  Great dish for a crowd!

This is a nice dish and I agree with other reviewers :  cook the rice separately.  Also, it was a little soupy but that's okay because overall it has a very nice , fresh flavor. I did add leftover chicken to mine too.  Thanks.

The best jambalaya recipe that I've found.  I've made it a couple of times, using two chopped Italian Roma tomatoes (about a cup, chopped) and a chopped chicken breast added with the vegetables.  I use just 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper, and it's got a nice kick, without burning.  And, I like the brown rice cooked with the vegetables and stock, as directed - it soaks up all that good flavor!

This was great!  The next time I make it I'm going to add in some cooked chicken.  And maybe do a roux to thicken it up a little and not use as much stock as I did.   Definitely a keeper recipe!

I love Chef John's recipes and I love jambalaya, so I was pretty jazzed up to give this recipe a try.  I followed the recipe exactly.  My husband and I thought it was OK.  I think the brown rice threw it off just a bit.

I followed this recipe with these exceptions: no celery, only because I don't like it; instead of green pepper I used part of red orange & yellow peppers. My electric 'chopper' ended up pureeing the peppers, but it actually added a lot of flavor. I used leftover chicken & gluten free sausage since I had both on hand. Yummy! Can't wait to have it for dinner again tonight!

My family loved it. I did add more sausage and more chicken stock and cut back the cayenne pepper because my wife doesn't do well with food that's too spicy. Other than yah it was awesome. Also used white rice instead of the brown rice.

another excellent recipe from chef john. i made no changes and it turned out great - like restaurant quality great. i usually do the cooking and was discussing with my g/f that i needed to start doing half recipes as the recipes as written are typically for four people . we may do that in the future but i’m glad we didn’t start with this recipe.

I cut the paprika in half and didn't use cayenne since my family doesn't like things too spicy.  This was EXCELLENT!  Chef John never disappoints.

Yum!..my family loved it.  I did swap out ingredients based on what I had on hand ( used 1 lb. ground turkey instead of sausage & red pepper instead of green) and I added 3 cloves of fresh, pressed garlic in while browning ground turkey, dried oregano and fresh sage with other dried seasoning.  Used a whole can of tomatoes (14.5 oz) instead of 1/2 cup, the shrimp were perfect....The recipe doesn't mention regular onions in the ingredient list, but does in the recipe part, so I used some finely chopped red onion that I had in the freezer, was perfect. I will definitely make this again...it's so easy & quick to put together, very minor prep work and you can easily adapt it to your taste.  It's so nice to have a meal that cooks all in one pot....my only regret?...that I didn't double the recipe because I didn't have any leftovers, it probably tastes great the next day!

The trick is doubling the sausage. And then doubling the shrimp. And why not a bit more sausage for extra measure

The end result was pretty good but definitely not one of Chef John's best recipes. The flavors just weren't there like in authentic jambalaya. Also, I was confused by the fact that onion (in addition to green onion) was listed in the steps but not in the ingredient list. I guessed and added half an onion, diced. I really liked the addition of the shrimp at the very end. They stayed extremely tender.

This was a very easy recipe to make and it smelled great. There was a little kick from the spices but the flavorweas bland.  I also didn't care for the texture.

I made it with a few modifications. I used boneless chicken thigh seasoned the night before in some chicken seasoning (Emeril). I am not a shrimp eater. I cubed them in 1 inch size and sautéed them in the butter until semi cooked, then I added the Andouille sausage and browned lightly. I also added a diced clove of garlic to the vegetable mixture. I had a handful of cherry tomatoes which I sliced and added .  I accidentally bought crushed tomatoes, but that worked well too.  I have never really cooked brown rice and on hindsight I would have added a cup and half of rice as the tomato mixture added more liquid than if I had just used diced tomatoes. I also would have used low sodium chicken broth or leave out the salt all together. Otherwise the recipe looks good and is very tasty . I also cooked it about 15 minutes longer.  I will probably serve it with plain brown rice for those who want additional rice on the side and of course, I think a pan of corn bread or crusty French bread would be a fine accompaniment.

Great recipe!! I didn't have all ingredients so I amended it to what I had in the house and my families taste.
Used Chicken sausage, can of diced tomatoes, 1Tbs smoked paprika, 1 Tbs green chilis, and water in place of the broth. My son hates peppers so I left that out and I didn't have celery. It came out great and I will definitely be adding chicken or crab meat next time!

I made this for my super picky husband and he LOVED it!  The only adjustment I made was leaving the bell pepper out because I HATE bell pepper.  I will definitely  make this again but next time I will double the recipe!

I just made this and it came out very good. The only thing I did different is that I used a 14.5oz can of diced fire roasted tomatoes and I added about a teaspoon of chopped garlic with the green onions. I also used two cans of chicken broth. I will make this again in the future.

Added leftover chicken...Yum
03/01/17:  I put everything but the shrimp in a crockpot and used jasmine rice.  I put the shrimp in the last 30 minutes.  Perfect.

This recipe is easy to do and I like being able to follow-along with the video. It's the first jambalaya recipe that my husband and kids likes. I've tried others and failed, but this one is a keeper. 

As a side note, this is a (mild) spicy recipe so if you have kids, you will want to cut the cayenne in half.

This is very good, however it was WAY to spicy for our taste. My kids wouldn't have been able to eat this at all as it's written. I think next time I will only add about half the cayenne pepper and maybe add some tomato paste. I certainly couldn't have added any hot sauce to it, and we like spicy stuff... But this has a lot of kick to it. Overall very good.

My husband and my father really have been enjoying Jumbalaya soup from the grocery store deli but I am sure it has way too much sodium in it.  I decided to  try this recipe and hoped it would be as good.  It was wonderful.  I only made minor changes - I added 5 cups of broth to make it more of a soup,  used white rice and eliminated the salt.  It was a big hit.  Both my dad and husband said to make sure I saved the recipe and my sister wants a copy!  I will be making it again and maybe try adding chicken.

02/12/16:  I doubled the recipe.  Browned meat in olive oil and not butter.  Used turkey kielbasa and turkey ham plus added some chicken. 2 cans of tomatoes instead of fresh.  Cut cayenne back to 1/4 tsp.  Used white uncle bens instead of brown and added 1 can of tomato paste.  Everyone loved, yet it was one of the simplest I've made.

Relatively easy recipe, and very tasty.  Next time I will cut back on the cumin to suit our personal preference.  Too late I read some of the reviews re the cooking time.  I had to double the cook time, so the next time I make this, I will bring the broth to a boil before adding the rice.  Review update.  I've since made this again, and adjusted seasonings to suit our tastes, and we love it.  1 Tbs. paprika, 1 tsp. cumin and 1/4 tsp cayenne.  Also added 1 tsp thyme and 1 tsp creole seasoning.  Still bring to boil after adding rice and stock and simmer.

Very good! It came out a little thicker than thought it would be, so  added another cup of chicken broth at the end. It was still a little too thick, so maybe I used the wrong rice. Maybe it absorbed all of the liquid. Besides the extra chicken broth, I wouldn't change anything.

The first time I made this I used mild Italian sausage, (I couldn't find andouille  anywhere!) I weighed my shrimp after defrosting it, and I used long grain parboiled rice. As a result, the dish was too greasy, there was WAY too much rubbery shrimp in the dish, and the rice was kind of blah. The second time I made this I used Kielbasa (a popular andouille   alternative) weighed my shrimp in it's frozen state, and I used white long grain rice. I also sauteed the completely defrosted shrimp with 2 cloves of minced garlic in 1/2 TBSP of butter before adding it to the pot for the remaining 10 min of cooking time. Now I can say this dish is simply amazing. If using regular long grain white rice (which I highly recommend) cut the 45min in step 4 down to 30 min or your rice will get mushy.

I have made this twice; the first time just as written, except using hot Italian sausage.  It Was superb!  The second time I added 3 cloves chopped of garlic and forgot the cayenne pepper.  Honestly, it was even better.  Make sure to use the low sodium chicken broth, if you don't have homemade.

Made it as recipe was listed. I love hot stuff a lot. This is just a tad to hot, but not unbearable. Biggest reason for not 5 stars is. I think when the chicken stock is added, it needs to be brought to a boil, then turned down to low. The way the directions say, is to just add it and turn to low. The rice won't cook this way,......at least not in 45 minutes. I had to turn it up after I realized it wouldn't cook. After I did that and brought to a boil and turned down, it was fine. Very tasty! Will make again with that one change.

I doubled the recipe. When I did I used half hot sausage and half polish sausage.  I also used a 15 oz can of rotelle tomatoes and a 15 oz can of petite diced tomatoes. We are kind  of wimpy here when it comes to hot spicy stuff.  But there were no complaints a d everyone loved it. Including my 14 month old grandson! 
I made it for super bowl Sunday and everyone loved it. I have had to share the recipe already!  I will definitely make it again!!!

This was yummy! I added some scallops, a cup of frozen okra & a cup of rinsed kidney beans. Also, I added a teaspoon of smoked paprika, 2 minced garlic cloves, fresh parsley to taste, a tablespoon of molasses and a half of a jalapeño. Mmm! It turned out thick and filling- using the one cup of brown rice, as suggested. Definitely would make this again.  Happy Fat Tuesday!

Takes a lot for me to give 5 stars, but this recipe crushed.  Kids devoured it, and I woke up the next day thinking about it.  Had chicken so used that instead of shrimp and added after sausage was nice and browned.  Also took advice of another reviewer and cooked rice separately.  I think recipe has typo where it says add both green onions and onions.  Who knows, but only used green onions.  Yummy!

Wow this was delicious! First time making Jambalaya so I was worried my boys wouldn't like it, but they loved it!! The only changes I made was that I doubled the recipe, used a can of diced tomatoes. I also let it come to a boil and cooked it for one hour.  I also used large shrimp, next time I will use med shrimp.  This was just amazing!!!

Excellent! Doubled it. Added garlic did not add salt. Also had to add more broth so it would be more of s soup-ish. still was thick . Otherwise made it just as written. Thank you Chef John!

Loved it!  Here are my changes:
* I large RED bell pepper
* I used one Tablespoon of Smoked Paprika & one Tablespoon of Sweet Paprika.
* I used a can of Rotel intead of the 1/2 Cup of diced tomatoes.
* I made everything the night before--except I didn't add the shrimp until the next day. It was spectacular!!

I added chicken and garlic. I used a can of petite diced tomatoes. Only two cups of chicken stock. Cooked the rice separately. I really liked it, but will add Rotel next time. My sausage seemed boring compare to the dishes I've had at restaurants.

Good flavor. It's not  cajun, but when you don't leave near Louisiana, this will certainly work. I followed a couple of suggestions and after adding rice I brought it to a boil, then covered it and simmered. I also added chicken instead of shrimp.  I used a whole cooked chicken I bought from the grocery store. I will certainly make this again.

Loved it.  Oh!  Used white rice instead of brown which worked fine.  The one lb of fresh ocean shrimp as $13 so entire five servings ran about $17.  Will make again!

I am not a cook by any means I am a preparer.  I make dinner by following recipes to the letter.  I made this jambalaya for dinner tonight and it was great.   The only complaint is the ingredients list called for green onions but the cooking instructions called for onions  then green onions later to be added..  I assumed the list of ingredients  just omitted the cooking onion.  Thank  you for the recipe and a great dinner.

I saw this recipe yesterday and knew I had all the ingredients so tonight it became dinner and was enjoyed by all, totally. I followed the recipe word for word, ingredient for ingredient and it came out very good and delicious. Only one thing I would change for next time and that is to cut the sausage just a tad thicker. To me it was too thin but otherwise very good and will make it into my rotation of meals to cook.

I will likely change the order in which things are added. Since the rices takes about 45" to cook, I would remove the sausage and add it in again once the rice is cooked. In order to lighten it up a bit, I used olive oil to sautee and substituted turkey sausage for the andouille. I also used pre-cooked shrimp and added it the mixture at the end of cooking time for about 10" to warm them.

Recipe instructions said to add onions and green onions, but onion wasn't on the ingredient list, though green onions were. I added diced onions. My wife thought it was too hot so I would cut back on the cayenne next time, but I like hot and thought it was good. I would make it again, but brown the sausage for less time and add less cayenne.

I made a large pot and had everyone going back for seconds!
Made a few modifications that worked beautifully: Added about a pound of finely diced chicken to saute with the sausage, used sliced  beef Smokies that added quite a bit of flavor (I cut them in thirds), added 1 tsp Gumbo Filet, added 1/2 c of frozen corn, used 1 whole can of diced tomatoes,  also used 1 1/4 c brown Jasmine rice so increased chicken stock to 5 c. This recipe is flexible enough to be creative!

So delicious, Thanks Chef John for this simple and incredibly delicious recipe. I'm prone to a little more heat so I was generous with the cayenne and even added extra red chillies, Zow!  Used 2 1/2 cups of chicken broth  and 1/2 bottle of New Castle beer, AMAZING flavor explosion. Can't wait to make this again and serve it over GRITS!!!

The whole family liked this.  I used white rice (that's what I had) and it cooks much faster.  Cut the time to 30 min. & the rice was a little over cooked. Should have checked at 20min. Or cooked it separately.   I will use the brown rice next time.  My shrimp took 7 min. once added.  Still was a hit.  Not too spicy for the kids & dad had 2 helpings. :)

It was okay.  Like someone else said, the rice would cook better on its own.  I used quick cook brown rice, and the sausage was overdone by the time the rice was soft.

The flavor was a little too much paprika for me, and not enough kick or tomato taste.

This was so good. I only had half of the paprika and couldn't tell the difference. I didn't have green onions and still couldn't tell the difference. It doesn't make a lot so keep that in mind. So looking forward to making this again.

This was so easy to make, and it turned out really good. I overlooked the celery on the ingredients list, so I forgot to buy it. I just made it without and it was still amazing, even though I may have offended the Jambalaya Gods somewhere. Next time I'll use the celery and I'm sure it'll be magical.

pretty much followed the recipe but did add chicken.  Also cut spices in half but could have maybe used 3/4 instead.
I did cook the sticky rice separately and added it to the pot.

Taste was good.  We used chicken instead of shrimp just because we didn't have shrimp.  Our only complaint is that the cook time/temp seemed off.  We cooked it on low for 45 minutes, but the rice was still hard.  We bumped up the temp a bit, and then it cooked just fine.  I'd just check it about 20 minutes through to ensure it's hot enough to get the rice tender.

Good Flavor, Easy to prepare, but rice didn't cook enough, left it on simmer 15 min more than 15 more, then put in microwave.        Use white rice, never fails to cook.    I love brown and wild rice but it should be cooked first.  Disappointed in the crunchy texture.

Delicious and, equally important, quick to make. Slight change to satisfy our tastes; substituted beer for 1/2 cup of the chicken broth, added some garlic, and doubled the cayenne. Use fresh tomatoes if possible.

I didn't have cayenne so I put in chili powder instead. I'm a wimp for spice so I love how it turned out with the chili powder! Very flavorful. I love every Chef John recipe I've tried so far.

I added a couple diced chicken tenderloins and left out the shrimp. Also added 50% more of the veggies, used the thick green onion with a medium onion on the end. Added light garlic powder, and a couple splashes of Worcestershire sauce. And halved the rice, but cooked extra rice in the rice cooker in chicken broth. It came out almost like a rou or gumbo, and it was very good. Everyone added more rice to their desire. Also slow boiled with frequent stirring for 20 minutes covered, then simmered/covered for 10 minutes. Best jumbalaya Ive ever made.

My whole family loves this! We are making it again tonight.  Last time I didn't have sausage but had chicken to finish up.  I also used red pepper seasoning and Italian seasoning as I was out of cumin and paprika.  Turned out really nice. Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

This was good, but WAY to spicy. I would definitely reduce the Cayenne. (It is possible that the sausage I used influenced this).

This jambalya is delicious! We doubled the recipe for a dinner party and it was perfect.  We prepped all the ingredients earlier, so it was a breeze to throw together a hour before we ate and I was able to hang out eith everyone.  It is a little on the spicy side, so if you are sensitive you might want to adjust the cayenne and choose a mild sausage.

Made this for dinner tonight and it was a huge hit. It will be added to my menu list. I followed instruction to the letter except I used a whole fresh tomato from my garden instead of 1/2 cup. I thought the serving size was ample. I served it with salad and cheddar cheese biscuits. I can hardly wait to make it again!

Very good!  I had to make a couple of changes, simply because I will not buy andouille at the supermarket, too bland. I can get fresh made kielbasa so I always substitute that for andouille and chorizo. Very tasty!  I also added chicken  because I like all three in my jambalaya.  I know it is not traditional, so don't jump on me. I enjoyed this so much that I am going to make it again this weekend for a party.

To answer your question of the difference between Cajun and Creole.  The Cajuns were exiled from Nova Scotia in the mid 17 hundreds to southern Louisiana by the British.  They were French speaking.  Creole is a mixture of Cajun and Afro-American.

I love this recipe! I made it today after reviewing several jambalaya recipes. As others have said, it has a very nice mixture of spices that gives it a great flavour. I will definitely make it again. Thanks for another great recipe Chef John!

Wow! We were SUPER stoked with this recipe. The rice we cook on the side and place in the bottom of bowl to be covered by jambalaya. Also, we used sweet onions and left out the cayenne. The Andouille sausage was spicy enough for us.
We cook the andouille sausage whole in the beginning with the peppers, stock, tomatoes, onions and celery. Once cooked, about 20 minutes, we added shrimp to cook about 7 minutes on Med High heat.
Was Perf.
Thanks chef John.

This was so fun and day to make. I love how the ingredients are so colorful. I'm a flavor junkie so I'm always adding to a recipe. I've made this twice and it was great the first time but a little bland for my palette. This time, along with the mentioned ingredients, I added :scallops, a table spoon of soy sauce, garlic powder, time, creole seasoning and topped with cheese with sweet Cornbread on the side..... I COULD HAVE FAINTED IT WAS SOOO GOOD!!!!

I added chicken and used white rice but  it still turned out great! If you want to add chicken just brown it in the butter in the beginning when you brown the sausage.

Love this recipe!  I do double it and only change is I use a large can of petite diced tomatoes and a package of mushrooms.  Great the first day but butter the next day.  Next time would try white rice and 3/4 tsp cayenne.

This recipe was great and easy to modify to our taste. I added jalapeño, carrots, and chicken. I also used white rice for my husband's taste and used 29 oz of diced tomatoes. I used 1.5 cups of rice as well.  This recipe was delicious. We served it over corn cakes because we love corn cakes.

My husband and I liked this.  I used turkey sausage, so didn't need to cook it ahead of time.  I used about 1.5 TBSP of paprika and 1/8 tsp of cayenne to keep it less spicy for the kids and me.  I used a whole can of tomatoes, and left our celery.  I omit salt (as always) but did sprinkle some celery salt.  I had about 5 c of chx stock, so I went ahead and added 1.5 c of rice.  I could have added more.  I tossed the sausage in with the shrimp at the end.  You do definitely have to boil the rice before turning down!

I can't believe it, I just made jambalaya for the first time in my life! Heck, I just tasted jambalaya for the first time also! Thank you Chef John for the video. It was easy to make, and thanks to the video, I knew how it should look at each step. Hubby loved it!!!! Funny how we came to have it. He called me from work asking if I ever had jambalaya, then he stated that we had sausage, and wondered what else goes into it. Well I knew just where to go, and the rest is history! Who knew?!

This was a quick and easy recipe to follow. I added about 1/2 pound of cooked chicken breasts and made sure the shrimp was seasoned. I didn't have regular brown rice so I used Brown Minute Rice and it turned out really good.

This was excellent, and perhaps better the second day. I prefer brown rice for almost every dish and this was no exception.  It took about 50 minutes to get just right.  My friend said this was the best jambalaya she has ever had.  She said the rice wasn't "mush like in most jambalaya."  I credit the brown rice for this.

So I only rated this a 4 simply because I tweeked it a bit based upon some things that I like. I bought the canned diced tomatoes flavored with garlic basil and onion. I also added a bit more of the chicken stock, along with some garlic, onion powder, and a tad bit of sugar to help break up being so spicy. Also, when I saw the recipe I thought oh I have brown rice at home not thinking it was precooked brown rice but that didnt cause any issues except cut my cooking time probaby in half. I think its a great recipe to add to your collection. My husband LOVED IT!!!! And I am always into looking for something new for us to eat. so this one has been added to my recipe box!

My 4 year old and wife devoured this meal. The only change is that I substituted chicken for shrimp.  Besides that it's perfect as is .

I absolutely loved this recipe.  I didn't have fresh tomatoes so I used 1 can 450ml Italian Chunky tomatoes. I added crimini mushrooms cut in half, substituted Medium Italian Sausage and baby bok choy in place of the celery. I used 2 tsp smoked paprika in place of the 2 tbsp, 3 oxo cubes in water for the chicken broth. I marinated the shrimp in some spicy Italian salad dressing and 1 tbsp lemon juice, prior to adding to the mixture. The flavor was so amazing.

This recipe was excellent!  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of the shrimp.  I substituted chicken as I was feeding a large group and I was unsure if anyone had a food allergy.  I doubled the recipe and and took it to a family reunion in a crock pot.  Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe.  I will be making it again this weekend as we have our first weekend of cool weather.  A piping hot bowl of jambalaya will be perfect.

Great recipe!  One additional thing to try: boil the shrimp in their shells (that's where much of the flavor is), pull them out to shell them, and cook the rice in the shrimp-boil water (augmented as needed with stock) to maximize the shrimp flavor in the finished jambalaya.  Brown rice needs to cook a lot longer than white, but it's worth the time.  I also cooked the shrimp and rice separate from the other ingredients and then mixed them all together for about 25 minutes to get the flavors to meld.

I agree with Chato on cooking the rice separately and shrimp needing more time to cook. I used a cup of white, uncooked rice instead of brown, and cooked it separately on its own. That way you only need to add a cup to cup and a half of chicken stock to the jambalaya (I used chicken broth). I also let the shrimp cook with the rest of ingredients for 10 minutes rather than 5, that way the texture of the shrimp feels more done. I scoop the rice in a bowl and top it with the jambalaya for each serving portion. I find that if I add all the rice to entire jambalaya pot, it get's too mushy when you re-heat left overs. I also added about half a can of corn, and it added a nice flavor and texture. Other than that, great dish and just the right amount of spices.

This is wonderfully spicy and tasty. I cooked Minute Rice separate in the interest of having it done sooner. I didn't have quite enough shrimp, so I diced up chicken breast and added it. I used frozen asparagus pieces in place of green pepper since I have a family member who hates peppers. Added extra celery. I did not add the cayenne pepper because I couldn't find mine, and I honestly felt it would be plenty hot and spicy without it, and it was.

This is an outstanding recipe for a fairly quick, easy, and delicious jambalaya.  Purists may disagree, as this version does not begin by cooking a roux to a nice, deep color; but frankly, it's the time and care that's required to do this step properly that often deters me.  I frequently need a quicker approach and, until I tried this recipe, I hadn't found one that still delivered a great, fresh flavor.  This one does.  I made it according to directions but found that I needed a bit more liquid (I had to add almost a cup of water) to get the rice to a fully tender stage without burning the lot, and yet, the broth that was left was still too thin for my liking.  I thickened it with some sliced okra and that worked well.  Other than these minor points, it's a really excellent recipe.  My family raved about it and dived in for seconds.

I did a "one and a half" on this recipe instead of doubling it.  It's absolutely perfect.  Just the right amount of spice, flavor, and seasonings.  I'm forever adding extra salt to stuff, but not for this recipe.  I used Basmati rice, so my cooking time was only about 45 minutes.  That was the only "tweak" I made, and I don't see where any others would be necessary either.  Perfect.

This chili is super flavorful.  I was worried it wouldn't have enough heat for my taste but followed the recipe anyway. I didn'have white beans so substituted them with black beans.  It was a huge success and my family loved it.  I'm also into a colourful presentation and this chili was beautiful.

This morning i bought some huge prawns, not because I needed them I just couldn't resist them they looked so plump and succulent and thought what should i do with these. Then thought Ahh I know Paella or Jambalaya, preferring to make the Jambalaya i then set to work in finding a recipe. Of course straight away my first visit is to Chef John and yet again as it is every-time he came to my rescue. I'm going to go with this recipe but will be using a bag of mixed seafood  and  the prawns i got I will use to garnish the top. Thanks yet again Chef John cant wait to try this and will let you know how it goes.

added chopped onion and cooked the rice separately, also doubled tomatoes because I like them. Very good, not too spicy as written.  Remember to remove bay leaf.

Everyone raved about this jambalaya last night, and I followed the recipe down to a t. I was a bit worried when as I had doubled the recipe and once I did that I noticed that it called for 1/4 cup paprika! I've never used that much paprika in anything in my life, but it was perfect! Not too hot, just right. Everyone went back for seconds! Thank goodness I doubled it!

I liked it a lt, but Hubby found it too spicy.  I will try again and cut back on the hot spices next time.

I gave this five stars, but I changed the recipe A LOT based on what I had in the kitchen. 

I substituted dark roux (from a jar) for butter, and that gave it a really nice smoky, earthy flavor. Also added some soy sauce and worchestshire sauce (per another recipe). 

No tomatoes on hand, so I added a squirt or two of ketchup. 

Didn't have celery, so left that out. Lots of cayenne 'cause we like it hot. Yum!

Next time I will cut back on the cumin and about a quarter cup of the broth.
Other than that, it was easy and good. Much better and healthier than the box type.

It tasted very yummy, however I did have to adjust the recipe. I added in more rice and also used dry crushed bay leaves instead of fresh since that's what I had on hand. My stove was being kind of finicky, so I had to simmer the jambalaya on medium heat for two hours in order to get the rice to cook. I also used chicken broth instead of stock, and it still tasted really good.

Just FYI: I didn't follow the recipe so much as I used it for guidance and used what I had on hand and it turned out great.  I had some Greek Style Sausages that had feta and spinach in them.  I took off the casings and cooked it then added in onion and green pepper and celery. Be sure and use Hot Hungarian Paprika for flavor.  I never knew there was a difference until I splurged and bought it wow what an improvement!  The other bulk bottle I had for years from the Big Box Store, in the trash,  yuck!  Also to speed things up I used some leftover brown rice I had in the fridge, heated it up with the stewed tomatoes and threw in the sausage mixture and added Worcestershire and a few shakes of Cholula Hot Suace yumm.  Dished up my young boys who don't care for shrimp then threw in some de-veined cooked shrimp and the rest of us dug in.  Looking forward to trying it again and follow the recipe a little closer when I have more time.  But don't hesitate to try this and ad-lib as you need to!

I have never made jambalaya, but I wanted to make it AWESOME. So of course I went with Chef John's recipe. He's never failed me before. I made a whole frigging VAT of this stuff, and spent the night power-texting my friends about how good my dinner was. They were so jealous that I brought them some the next day at work, and one of my friends declared it better than his spouse's, which is sayin' a lot. This is a freaking awesome recipe. I loved it. I'm craving it right now. I'm sad that it's all gone.

DELISH!!!! Wow! I be no means consider myself a good cook, I can follow a recipe and this recipe was easy. 
Changes or additions I made: I added skinless boneless chicken thighs (Chopped and cooked ) when chicken was pretty much done , I started following the recipe. I was in a time crunch, so I added spicy diced canned tomatoes ( instead of fresh ) and I used Jasmine rice instead of brown rice (per past reviews I didn't want to risk brown rice not cooking or taking to long ) also per past review , I did NOT add the salt. Recipe, was quick, easy and my family and guests LOVED it. I was making this especially for my son (who is super picky and a great cook) he loved it and Mommas job was complete!!! I will make this dish again , saved it to my recipes, Thanks Chef John for sharing such a delicious easy dish!!!

The brown rice didn't take 45 minutes; it took over 2 hours to cook. I had to start a side pot with white rice as a back up. Very frustrating. The flavor was okay, but when you're eating while you're mad all because of rice....doesn't make the meal enjoyable at all. Will not make again.

The dreaded substitution list: hot italian sausages, whole can drained diced tomatoes (about 4x what is called for in the recipe), added bacon instead of butter for some nice fats and parboiled rice. I didn't have to cook it for 45 minutes to get the rice cooked, which is a blessing on a busy night. Followed everything else to a T.

Even if the bottom burns a LITTLE it adds a very nice caramelized, spicy flavour to the dish.

I made this for Fat Tuesday and it was tasty. I used leftover rice so I didn't use the chicken broth and didn't cook the rice in the dish. If I made it again, I would use some tomato sauce and/or paste to make the broth thicker, if I wasn't cooking the rice with it.

Wow!  What great flavor!  I made it tonight - used a can of diced tomatoes, 12 oz of andouille sausage and no shrimp - just because that is what we had in the house.  We made it with brown rice and it took 45 minutes - I think we would like it even better with white rice - but yummy!  We LOVED it with warm crusty bread!

I'm a big fan of Chef John and this dish is 1 more to add to the collection! I read a number of the reviews and tweeked it just a little. I used olive oil instead of butter and added a full 14.5oz can of diced tomatoes. I used regular hot sausage since that was all I had and cut up a chicken breast and added it 10 minutes before the end. I also added some hot sauce and cut up a small jalapeno pepper as I like a nice kick! I missed one of the reviews that said to bring the batch to a boil after adding the rice as this info is left out in the recipe description. Be sure to do this or it will take longer to cook. I left it for an additional 10-15 minutes. Really delicious and very simple!

So amazing!
I hate modifying recipes, but knew it would be too spicy for my kids if I didn't.  I used 1/2 the paprika, cumin and cayenne that it called for. I only had 3 oz of leftover summer sausage that I used instead of the andouille.  I didn't have any green onions on hand so used 1/2 a small yellow onion instead.  Olive oil was used instead of the butter but everything else was the same.  I'm sure the flavor would have been even more incredible had I followed it to a "T", but considering how spicy it was with 1/2 the amount of spices, I'm glad I did it for my kids sake.
Will certainly make again.....and again....and again!

I added a chicken breast that I browned along with the sausage. Also added some garlic and used the canned tomato/green chiles that others mentioned. It made lots and can't wait for leftovers. Excellent!

This is seasoned perfectly. No need to adjust anything in this recipe. However using what I had on hand I used 1 white onion and white rice instead of green onion and brown rice. I cooked for only 20 min after adding the rice so to not overcook it. It really would be even better with the brown rice, heartier. I thought for sure that there was too much water in this recipe but it really is great the way it is. Tip: simmer the shrimp shell/tail in your stock and strain for added flavor. My husband raved after every bite.

This is an excellent recipe.  I was short on several ingredients so I had to substitute so I can't comment completely.  I do think that chopped onion has been left out of the ingredients list.  It is mentioned in the instructions though.  I will add more later.

This is an awesome meal! I didn't have green bell pepper on hand and made this without it and I increased the amount of onion. I live at 6,000 feet elevation and it took 1.5 hours for the brown rice to get tender.

The first time I made this it was way too salty for my taste. So I took the advice from one of the reviews and used low sodium chicken broth. I also used unsalted butter. It was fantastic!! I will be making this again :)

I loved this recipe! I only changed a little bit for my own personal tastes (mostly added more spice). Although, I added chicken breast and that was delicious (can't have too much meat!)! This will be seen on my table again in the near future...

Very good, did Italian sausage, chicken, kolbasa stick for flavour and shrimp. Cooked brown rice in my rice cooker for 45 minutes then added it to the pot. Very flavourful with spices in recipe, added fresh basil and oregano cuz I had it on hand.

This was really, really good. I made it the night before and then we reheated if for dinner the next night..it got even better with time. My husband loved it so much (when I went to heat up the leftovers for lunch the next day, the container sat empty in the sink).

Great recipe! It took me a little longer because I used longer grained rice. It was also a very spicy recipe, will need to reduce the spices next time. Otherwise, great recipe!!

My family and my neighbors loved this dish -- it was soooo good we just had to share. Weeks later my husband still talks about how much he enjoyed it. Perfectly seasoned and simple to make.

This was an easy recipe for me to make (I am not a cook by any means) and I thought it tasted great. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because I think next time I will have to cut the heat down just a tad. I got quite the burn on the tongue, lol.

I love this recipe. The only thing I had to modify was the amount of Cheyenne by reducing it. The original recipe was delicious just extra spicy for my taste. The brown rice worked well with the other ingredients, creating a great texture. I would love to to try this recipe with okra in it. Love Chef John's recipes. :)

I added an extra tomato and cut down the chicken stock to 70ml. I followed the advice of another reviewer and added precooked brown rice to cut down on the cooking time. Overall, a quick and delicious dish!

This recipe was easy to make and I received rave reviews from those who tried it.  I just added garlic powder and increased the tomatoes as other reviewers suggested.  Instead of using diced tomatoes, however, I used canned tomatoes from the garden.  Yummm!

Excellent!  Even after I took out all my husband would not eat.  I jokingly said that I made "Jamba" since I left out most of the cumin, used smoked beef sausage, and didn't dare add green pepper so I suspect it's even better with all that added!  Next time I will use homemade stock since I had to add in another cup of uncooked rice (cooked on the side in water) to cut the tremendous salt. I loved the fact that this recipe used brown rice too excellent nutritious grain!
