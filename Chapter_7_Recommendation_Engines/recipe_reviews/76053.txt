I seldom give any recipe less than 5 stars.  I just figure if I don't have anything good to say....  This time I will make an exception, because I think this has potential, but falls short.  Many things can make a difference in this recipe.  The spicyness and size of the meatballs used makes a huge difference.  I thnk that you should always use fresh lemon juice in a recipe like this.  The flavors between bottled and fresh are tremendous.  I think the soup could use more orzo too. I also think that this recipe should have at least one more egg.  When you make any kind of egg/lemon sauce it should be creamy.  This broth was very liquidy.  Following the recipe exactly made a very tart soup without a lot of body to it.  I will try again, but with modifications.

Followed some of the hints - extra orzo, also used more zucchini, and put quite a bit of cayenne in my meatballs.  It was FANTASTIC.  Everyone loved it - the spice was a really nice balance to the citrus.  mmmmm!

Just made it in the crock pot. Substituted spinach for the zucchini and used Cottage Inn's wine wine and herb chicken broth.  My husband was dubious about it when he saw it (he HATES Italian Wedding Soup) but when he smelled it he said he'd try it.  He ended up eating two huge bowls.  We sprinkled some parmesan cheese on top too.  Easy, quick, toss it all together and walk away! OH, and I forgot to add in the egg and lemon juice!!!

WOW! The perfect comfort soup! I added a bit of chopped spinach and onions along with the ingredients listed. I highly recommend this soup!

Loved this recipe, really easy to make and adapt for yourself.  I did do a couple of variations just with stuff I had in the house.  I cooked this with rice instead of orzo and used green peas (added during last 10 minutes) instead of zucchini.  Also, I added just a little bit of Greek seasoning that I had in the house.  I didn't use the eggs at all (allergic to eggs).    The best thing about the recipe is that it reheats nicely for leftovers, so my husband and I ate this for a couple of lunches later that week.  Very hearty!

This recipe was better than expected!  My entire family loved it so we've added it to the normal dinner routine.  I used the meatballs I buy at Costco which made it a very fast recipe and perfect for the weekday rush our family is normally in.  I will definitely be sharing this with my friends and family.  Thanks!!

I wanted to use left over meat balls from the night before.. I'm only giving this 4 stars because I didn't follow the recipe exactly.  I didn't have Orzo so I replaced it with tortellini.  Replaced parsley with sage.  No zuchini so I just left that out.  I used two extra cans of broth and left out the egg and lemon all together.  It was good.  My boyfriend loved it.  Very quick and easy.  I will be making this again

Super yummy and very comforting! I love the basic recipe. I used "party" sized meatballs, which were bite sized. I did not have any orzo in the cabinet, but I had some dried cheese tortelini. I also added a bunch of tiny broccoli florets. That made it a one pot meal. It was great. I can imagine orzo would give the soup a nice texture. I loved the tangy lemony broth. I'm thinking that fresh herbs tossed in right before serving would be nice next time. From what I gather, after doing a recipe search of avgolemono, that you can really make this soup your own. This is a great recipe to get started. Thanks!

I really love this soup, it's so simple and really has a wonderful flavor.  I did find that it tastes better after it sits overnight.  I didn't change anything in the recipe and it was very popular at home.

This is currently cooking in the crock pot at my house for dinner tonight...SMELLS DELICIOUS!...can't wait!
**UPDATE: I really liked this soup, it was very hearty and had a great taste.  I added spinach instead of zucchini to it and used the small frozen Italian meatballs.  I had no complaints myself, and my father-in-law to be really liked it too!    Everyone else, however, could not eat this!  My 6 yr old daughter couldn't stomach the looks of the soup long enough to even taste it...and I have to admit, it's definitely not a pretty site...but if you can get past the looks, the taste is well worth it!  My fiance also couldn't stomach it...he had texture issues with the spinach and the pasta.  I would highly recommend not adding the pasta until you're ready to eat it so the pasta doesn't get mushy...so leftovers may be an issue if you have a texture issue as well.  Definitely worth making and trying!...Just don't look too long at it! :)

I gave this original recipe a 1star because my husband hated it ...I really thought it was disgusting!  My eight year old refused to eat it and my two year old spit his out!  
I made it again without the lemon and egg mixture a few weeks later and it was okay...maybe a 3star.

Great soup! We added more spice to the broth, Maggi and Worcestershire to spice it up. We used Danish meatballs. We added the orzo just prior to serving so it wasn't mush! Great thanks!

Yum!  Even my very picky 3 year old eats it (but I don't let him watch me cook it because of the Zucchini base.)

Made my own meatballs from another recipe on this site.  This soup is SUPER YUMMY and I will definitely be making it again!  Perfect stick-to-your-ribs soup, especially for cold weather.  Made my house smell so good!

Kind of odd twang from the lemon.  I am on the fence with this one.  We ate it all.

Delicious!!! I must admit I used this recipe as a base . . . but SUCH a good one. I put it all in a crock pot. Two thinly sliced onions, 5 cloves crushed garlic, two chopped carrots, 10 oz frozen chopped spinach, two small cans mushrooms w/liquid, some Kalamata olives with their juice, thawed meatballs, chicken stock, and lots of cooked basmati rice. After abt 4 hrs on low I added the lemon and eggs (3 eggs, 1 whole lemon.) Seasonings included pepper and a blend of pasta seasonings. The lemon/egg thing was GREAT!!! We loved it. Thanks for the great start.

Great and Easy Recipe.  Didn't have meatballs and didn't have time to make them, so just cooked ground turkey and added that to the soup.  I reduced the pepper to 1/2 teaspoon (because of the children), didn't add zucchini because wasn't in the refrigerator, used fresh lemon juice and increased the orzo to a very generous cup. I have made the recipe twice and both times my 5 year old, 2 year old and husband loved the soup.

This was a pretty good soup. I quartered the meatballs so they weren't as big. I didn't add the egg because then my daughter wouldn't eat it. It's a great use for orzo!

Absoulutely amazing! I made it for my roommates and they raved! Use a little sugar to offset the lemon juice if its too bitter for your taste. Extremely hearty and a great treat, a real stick to your ribs kind of  meal. This one is going in the permanent collection!

For a taste/ease ratio, not bad.   My husband really liked it. And, my kids always like anything with meatballs in it.   However, as one of the other reviews indicated, I also would put more orzo in it next time.  And, would definitely use fresh lemon juice.

Made this exactly as is and loved it.  Simple and easy to make.  I am sure the meatballs make a difference overall.  We used "Home Style" frozen meatballs rather than "Italian".  Excellent!!! Second time around I used what we had, Orecchiette pasta and spinach and it was just as good!!  Thank you!!!

Different! Easy! Delicious! I used a handful of frozen spinach instead of the zucchini. This dish seems exotic, in spite of it's simple ingredients and the ease with which it's put together.

I modified it a bit and the outcome was delicious.  I decided to add fresh spinach, chopped onion, and chopped carrots to increase the amount of vegetables in the soup.  I skipped the egg and used lemon & pepper seasoning instead of the lemon juice.

Great soup for the time involved-quick to make!  I unintentionally put less than the amount called for of chicken broth in the soup and the result was a thick and creamy soup/stew.  I was skeptical about adding the lemon egg mixture, but found that it tasted good.  Next time I make it will use homemade meatballs and the correct amount of chicken broth :)

Pretty good soup, Next time I think  I will add more veggies, maybe some carrots and celery, to add a little more nutrition and fiber.

I wanted some soup because I was sick.  I decided to try this one because it looked so easy to make, and I am so glad I did.  I followed the recipe almost exactly.  What I did was cover the soup while it was simmering, and I didn't leave it uncovered like it says to do.  I wanted more broth to eat, and I just wanted to eat one bowl of it.  It was so good that I ate two bowls!  My husband loved it so much that he said I should give this recipe 10 stars.  This is a keeper for sure!

My husband and I both loved the thick consistency of this soup.  We took other reviewers suggestions and used almost a cup of orzo, halved the lemon juice,  used bite size meatballs and sprinkled in some Cajun seasoning.  My husband said the only thing we did wrong was not doubling the recipe so we could have leftovers!

Yummy yummy soup!  But way too much lemon juice.  I used bottled lemon juice, and next time I would only use half as much as the recipe calls for.

DELICIOUS!! I added a few things, but I'm sure as-is the recipe is a 5! I added 1 shredded carrot & a little extra orzo, as it's my family's favorite. An easy recipe that we're gonna keep!

We really loved this soup, but I also changed it a little.  I added a bit more orzo and a bit more stock.  I made my own meatballs and added some carrots and broccoli to it.  It came out delicious and I'm sure I'll make many different versions of this!

I was very pleased with how this recipe turned out. Even my picky eater raved over it.  The orzo is a great change from everyday pasta and the lemon juice gave it a surprisingly perfect zing.  The zucchini was barely noticeable but it was nice to know the family was getting a green veggie that they don't normally eat.  The recipe was majorly easy with an impressive outcome as far as taste, however, it's not the prettiest dish. I will also add this recipe to my list of potluck dishes.

Really good recipe...I found it less oily if I bake the meatballs first in the oven.  I hardly ever give out five stars but this definitly comes close.  My husband LOVED this recipe and has now fallen in love with orzo...thanks

Doubled the orzo b/c my husband doesn't like zucchini. Added the extra egg someone suggested. Used ikea swedish meatballs - this is absolutely the best soup I've ever made. I guess I learned eggs are the key to a creamy recipe - not cream!

Like one of the other reviewers I didn’t have zucchini and I used grated carrots.  I used my own meatballs and halved the recipe to serve 2.  We hound it delicious and a little different than usual winter fare.  Will definitely make it again.

Absolutely one of the best soups I have ever had.  I did add a bit extra lemon juice, but only because I love lemon.  it pairs perfectly with the Mediterranean Kale recipe.

After reading all of the reviews, I made the following adjustments:  
increased the orzo to 1 cup, added 1 extra egg, used 2 zucchini, quartered the meatballs to make it easier to eat and added the orzo to the pot after simmering for 20 min.  Everyone liked it and even had seconds.  I liked my bowl with a little extra lemon juice.  Next time I will try with turkey meatballs because it seems liken it would go a better with a chicken stock based soup.

This recipe turned out amazingly well - better than I expected considering the simple ingredients and the fact that I have never made or eaten this kind of soup before (so didn't actually know what flavor I was aiming for). I quickly learned that the broth is the most important ingredient. If you have bland broth then this soup will be bland too. I am vegetarian so made veggie broth using the "Garden Veggie" brand cubes (4.5 cubes to maybe 5-6 cups of water). The flavor was pretty great just with the cubes, but I added onion granules to match it a little closer to real chicken broth. Dry parsley and ground pepper went in too. I followed someone else's suggestion and added a couple dashes of cayenne pepper because we like a little spice, but you can do without it. I also used Quorn meatless/soy-free meatballs. Near the end of simmering I added the beaten eggs (2) with about an 1/8th of a cup of fresh lemon juice, which thickened it wonderfully.  Served with soft Italian bread. I had to fight with myself to slow down and savor it because it was just incredible. Hubby loved it too and he is a harsh critic. Absolutely will make this again.

The taste was good .... but it doesn't look good. After adding the egg to the soup it leaves the broth not so appetizing to look at. I didn't want to tell my husband what was in it until after he tried it, but he keep asking me, what was the white stuff in the broth? He also didn't like the way it looked.  tasted good but I can't make it again

I have never reviewed or rated a recipe before, but this sounded so interesting and I made it tonight and it is WONDERFUL!!!!!  I LOVED IT!!  DEFINITELY A KEEPER!!  Was a little peppery for my hubby, so may cut back the pepper a little for him.  After reading all the reviiews before making, I did cut back the lemon  juice just a little, added an extra egg, more Orzo (1 cup) and used carrots and celery because it's what I had on hand.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!!  VERY VERY YUMMY!!!  Can't wait to take it to our next pot luck at work.  Also, so easy to make and quick!!!  5 STARS from me!!!

This is a must try for a winter recipe! I have a love affair with homemade soups, so does my Hubby, this is one of our favorites! In the top 2, it's a toss up between this and lasagna soup :))
You must make these changes: Use 1 cup of orzo and don't put it in until the last 10 mintues, fresh lemon juice and for peets sake make your own mini-meatballs with fresh minced garlic(don't leave this out), s & p, red pepper, breadcrumbs, then saute them for a few minutes and throw them in the soup to finish.  YUMMO

I've made this soup numerous times and it's always delicious.  Sometimes I even follow the recipe!  Other times I add grated carrots, onion, basically whatever I have handy.  Even my very picky daughter loves this one.

This was so simple, and with so few ingredients that it will be a regular weeknight staple at our house.  I added a little sauteed onion and used chopped kale and spinach in place of the zucchini, but other than that I would leave it as is.  Delicious!  I will make a low carb version next time by leaving out the orzo, but that would be for a dietary reason, and certainly not one of flavor or texture.  This was a home run with my family ~

I thought this was great and I took some liberties with it.  I had leftover homemade turkey meatballs and Italian sausage from spaghetti that I was tired of eating, so there was still some tomato sauce on my meat and it had some sauted onions, etc, but I just dumped it all in there and I used spinach instead of zucchini.  I also increased the amount of orzo - didn't measure, but probably doubled it.  It was so good.  I almost feel silly rating the recipe with all these changes I made, but I never would have known about using the lemon juice and eggs to thicken and just never would have dared to try this without this recipe as a starting point.  Thank you - I would make this again as I did or using the recipe.  But it really is a great way to use up leftover spaghetti sauce with meatballs.  The tomato sauce changes it a bit, but I liked it and even my 5 year old gobbled it up!

I've made this soup several times and decided it was time I rated it. This soup is absolutely wonderful. I normally make my own meatballs using ground turkey.  The orzo adds such a nice texture to the soup.

This was really, really tasty.  Like others, I added more broth and instead of zucchini, I added shredded carrots and sliced green onions and fresh parsley.  If you use low sodium broth, you will probably want to add some salt and pepper.  We will definitely have this again.
