It takes a lot longer than 20 minutes for the gelatin to thicken, so plan accordingly.  I would have liked a little more cheesecake flavor, but I did use reduced-fat cream cheese, that was the only deviation from the recipe.  The strawberry flavor comes through well, and that flavor is the more prominent.  As I always do with pies of this type, I put it in the freezer to make slicing easier.  All it takes is several minutes at room temp, and you're ready to plate. There was more filling than the pie shell would hold, so I poured it into a couple dessert cups for a pudding parfait.  Next time, I'll try fat-free evaporated milk and sugar-free Jell-O to lower the calories, but this is an easy dessert with good eye appeal.

I was looking for something I could make with what I had on hand, and most of the recipes I found called for whipping cream.  The evaporated milk in this caught my eye.  I followed the recipe exactly, except for using raspberry gelatin instead of strawberry.  I didn't have any problem with it setting up, but the texture was kind of odd, fizzy and fluffy.  The taste was just ok.  Those who had trouble whipping the evaporated milk, it must be COLD.  I popped the can in the freezer for about 20 minutes and it whipped - not quickly, but it did thicken. The gelatin will thicken in 20 minutes if you put it in the freezer instead of the refrigerator. However, there is no way you can "fold" the cream cheese mixture which has the texture of soft cookie dough, with the jello/milk mixture.  I ended up gently stirring them together.  This recipe gets way too many dishes dirty for the end result. Not worth making again.

This recipe was easy to make and it looked great! I used a regualr white cream cheese and whipping cream instead of evaporated milk, which made it heavier, so I think the evaporated milk would do more justice. However, it was too sweet for me: I like the tangy type of cheesecake. Next time I would surely use this recipe again but tweak it with less sugar. I am sure the strawberry gelatin could easily be exchanged for lemon, pine-apple or peach to your liking.

Quick and easy recipe. Tasted more like a strawberry pie than cheesecake but it was very good.

Thanks!  This was easy to make and pretty cheap.  I reduced the filling by 25% and it fit my pie crust perfectly.  I used splenda instead of sugar and fat free evaporated milk.

Mine turned out great, even though I kind of winged the recipe. My evaporated milk wasn't cold and I mixed in the gelatin when it was warm (not hot) and it turned out fine. I made it with a graham cracker crust and my family of four ate the entire thing in one sitting. I used raspberry jello instead of strawberry.

My mom has been making this cheesecake for years, but uses lemon jello instead of strawberry and it is delicious.

Just popped this into the fridge. I found this as a variation of classic gelatin no-bake cheesecake  using a packet of unflavored gelatin (yes this goes back a long ways!) So, kudos for a quick, easy pantry ready ice box dessert. The recipe is fundamentally the same proportions to the one I already had except I did use only 1/2 c. sugar   and it had perfect tang and sweet balance. I omitted the evaporated milk bc I didn't have any --  and blended the softened cream cheese  into the warm strawberry gelatin, so yes I made changes to mirror the recipe I had - but no issues with fitting into a store bought graham crust  - was very easy & refreshing for a quick dessert with not enough calories to sneeze at!

It was too sweet for us and the strawberry flavour was not that strong.  There was too much cheesecake filling for the pie crust. I make an almost identical one with lemon jello which we really like

I have made this recipe using different flavors of jello to go with same flavored fruit; raspberry jello topped with fresh raspberries, etc. This recipe is quick and easy and pretty much fool proof. My family loves it!!  I do cut back the sugar by 1/4 cup though as its a bit sweet.

The evaporated milk has to be very cold for it to rise. Put a can in the fridge at least 24hrs before whipping.

This is pretty foolproof. It has a lovely colour and texture. I probably will not make this again though. With the same effort I can make a 'real' cheesecake. Thanks anyways... it was still good and I enjoyed trying something new.

I used lime jello and 1 c Greek lime yogurt in place of the evaporated milk. Worked great. This pie was totally gone within an hour. Perfect cheesecake for us. Thank you
