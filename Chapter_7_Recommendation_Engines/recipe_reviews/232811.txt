Easy and delicious!  A few changes I made:  1 cup of chicken is not enough- I added closer to 2 1/2 cups. Also, I added 1 tsp minced garlic and a few tablespoons of the sour cream mixture to the tomato mixture to help bind it.  I added fresh cilantro on top after baking.

I used more chicken (2 cooked breasts) and 2 cans of Rotel.  Flavor was really good. However, there was too much sour cream sauce.  I love sour cream but it was a bit overwhelming.  If I make it again, I would not put less of the mixture on top.

Yummy, easy to make.   For me, in trying to eat a bit healthier this is a good  "not from scratch but maybe better for us than fast food" recipe. You can make it even easier -use chunky salsa of your choice in place of these three ingredients - can of tomatoes, can of green chilis and chopped cilantro.  We used low sodium cream of chicken soup and reduced fat cheese.  The recipe makes a lot of 'sauce' ... next time I may double the number of tortillas to make more enchiladas, up the amount of chicken & veggies in the filling ... and maybe even add black beans if the family agrees.  I think with those additions the ratio of sauce to enchilad will be more to our preference.  We had a salad with ours, but next time I think I'll just shred lettuce and dice some tomatoes and serve on top of the entree for some freshness.

These turned out great! The sauce is perfect. I recommend filling with a lot of meat since there’s plenty of sauce to offset it.

This was sooo good and my family loved it!  We really like onion so I put in a little more than called for.  Also an 8 x 11 pan was stop small for all of the sauce so dumped in a 9 x 11.  Perfect!

This was so good! I used prepackaged seasoned shredded chicken due to time constraints and left out the onion all together. You definitely need at least 2 cups of chicken - no way 1 cup will be enough. I also used low carb tortilla shells but they tasted the same and I couldn’t tell any difference.

I didn't have any cilantro so used some of the green chilis in the sauce. Added garlic because, well it's GARLIC! Very good and I used leftover baked chicken there was plenty left over because it is just my husband and I.

We omit the onion and the cheese on top to make it more low fat and less greasy.

Ok... these enchiladas are ok. The sauce is nothing special, I'm not a crazy fan about flour enchiladas but I made them for my boyfriend because he is but I will admit the chicken mixture makes them really good. Will I make them again? No, but I like to try new recipes to try them myself not just rely on reviews.

After reading the reviews I also used 2 cups of chicken.  I can see where 1 cup would not be enough.  My husband & I did not care for the taste, to me it tasted "processed", not sure if it was because of the cream of chicken soup or the green chiles.  It sounded good and I had high hopes for it, but, I will not be making this again.

These are absolutely and a definite guilty pleasure on a lower calorie lifestyle. My boyfriend, who is all midwestern casserole loving, requests these at least once a month. Thanks for a great recipe.

Made it with out the cilantro because me and my family do not like. Tasted great and def need more chicken than what it calls for. Another quick tip is to used canned chicken taste just as good and you have a quick home cooked meal!

Great and easy to make. I used a more chicken than the recipe called for as I had to make more than 8 for a pot luck at work. Everyone loved them!!
