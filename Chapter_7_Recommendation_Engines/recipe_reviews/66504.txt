these were pretty good, i didn't have any tapioca starch so used plain old corn starch instead.  kids loved them warm with garlic butter at dinner.  thanks!

I hadn't eaten this bread since I was in the Peace Corps. The bread was wonderful--chewy and tasty and I didn't need a brick oven to bake it!

I love these. Perfect. Thank you for this great recipe. They remind me of a Brazil style cheese bread. Super easy to make. Well, your fingers get a little sticky but that is worth it.
