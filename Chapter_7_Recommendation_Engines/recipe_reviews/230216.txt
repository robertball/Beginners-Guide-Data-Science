The soup was easy, quick and sooo delicious. The one thing that I changed was that I added four more cups of water. The soup was still full of flavor.

This recipe was simple, concise, and delicious! Very easy to prepare, just loved the flavors! The only difference was I added some egg noodles and salt & pepper. Terrific turkey soup! Thank You for sharing.

I thought this was okay, but a bit bland. I also added way more vegetables than the suggested amount, because I figure extra veggies are always good for the family.

Super simple and delicious soup.  As per the title I made it a true leftovers soup and threw in a bit of extra stuffing and even some mashed potatoes . Don't worry, they both dissipate into the soup.  I had doubled (plus) the chicken broth in place of the water, added a garlic clove with the onion, and a sprig of rosemary with the parsley and thyme.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  Left it on a low simmer for a couple of hours adding a bit more chicken broth.  Threw in some egg noodles the next day.  Yum!

The recipe was great with a couple of changes.  We used 8 c. Of chicken broth for flavor.  More vegetables, including potatoes, a little kitchen bouquet for deeper flavor, and rosemary instead of thyme.  My family loved it.

No onions. Added milk and flour for a heavier broth and a few garlic cloves. Family loved :)

Great soup that can be improved with the addition of uncooked white or basmati rice.

This soup is wonderful!!!  I added uncooked pasta and fresh mushrooms and it was delicious.  Along with the broth, I did add a spoonful of chicken broth paste which added more flavor.  YUM
