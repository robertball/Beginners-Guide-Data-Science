If I had left out the cayenne and the 3 T. of sugar, this might have been a good side dish. As written, however, and even though I cut WAY back on the cayenne, this was a strange combination of sugary sweet and fiery hot that just didn't work.

i thought this was so unusual and really good.  i gave the recipe 4 stars because i thought 3T sugar would be over-the-top sweet, and i think i was right.  i cut the sugar back to 2T which was really good, but i acually think 1T would be the perfect amt. i only used abt. half the onion called for b/c that's all i had, but that worked just fine.  i was worried that the beans would get mushy after cooking for so long, but they held up just fine.  the title sums up exactly what this dish tastes like, so if sweet and spicy is not your bag, you best move on ;-)

I loved this recipe.  I used a can of fire roasted crushed tomatoes and threw it a 4-oz. can of mild diced green chilis because that's what I on hand.  I also skipped the cilantro because I don't like cilantro.  The only change I'd make is to use a 1/2 t. of cayenne pepper next time because it was just a tad too hot for my taste.  But the dish has a wonderful flavor.  1 serving over 1/2 cup brown rice, with a green salad on the side, was perfect.

We make this dish a couple of times per month. Very simple and very flavorful. Ingredients are always on hand. Sometimes we serves over a cooked bag of Success Brown Rice though it's fine alone too.

I made this for a barbeque and got raves from my friends.  They still request that I make these again!  Next time I will try brown sugar instead of white sugar.

I would have rated this recipe a "5" for everything except the amount of sweet and spicy... I would never add as much sugar and as much cayenne to this as called for.  Simmering uncovered for about half the time was enough to evaporate the liquid and leave a nice thick sauce around the beans. This was delicious served with rice cooked in chicken broth.  My favorite black beans and rice recipe...use Rotel tomatoes with cilantro and lime juice!

I liked the concept of the sweet/spicy flavors, but this was just much too spicy for me, and I even cut back on the cayenne pepper. My husband liked it better, though it did make him break out into a sweat!

My husband just loved this "different" recipe - truly a good combination of sweet and spicy!  I mixed it with cooked rice, and served it with mexican meatloaf.  It was a hit!

I followed the directions exactly and these just were not for us.  The sugar was all we tasted.  I probably would not try these again even with less sugar.

This was incredible! I served it with Carribean Chicken. Definitely worth it and I liked being able to get the beans ready and then just let them simmer while I made the chicken. Makes for a hassle-free dinner.

Very good and different. I fried a jalapeno with the onion and garlic and added extra water so I could throw in some instant rice. At first bite the sweet taste seemed odd, but it really grows on you and you go back for more. I will be making again! Thanks for recipe!

A different and delicious way to serve black beans!  I usually simmer for an hour covered, then remove the lid and simmer for an additional 10-15 minutes to allow the mixture to thicken.

These are the best black beans I've ever had!  I just love the sweet and spicy flavor mixture.  I always make these whenever we have people over for a taco dinner.

I serve this at least two times per month. Typical meal consists of steamed rice and leftover rotisserie chicken all mixed together. Delicious! For the spice-wimps, I cut back the cayenne to 1/2 tsp. 

Thanks, Robin! Love this!

I did not like these. I think it was the cinnamon in them.  They had an odd smell and noboby liked them.  I even tried adding bacon, but still didn't work for us.

This dish was great, my husband loved it too!  I did make some adjustments to the recipe: 1) I didn't have diced tomatoes with chilies, so I sauteed a jalapeno and 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes with the onion and used plain diced tomatoes, 2) Substituted white kidney beans for the black beans (didn't have them on hand), and 3) like other reviewers, I reduced the amount of sugar to 1-2 Tb.

Apart from adding more cilantro and cayenne, I pretty much made this as written. It turned out great - hearty, flavorful and healthy. I served it over plain white rice, but it would be great in flour tortillas. Nice recipe. Thanks, Robin!

Holy WOW! These are amazing! I left out the sugar, I've started following the "Eat to Live" diet/lifestyle, and they were plenty "sweet"! I used "Italian" style canned tomatoes and I think that's what made the recipe. I added a 4 oz. can of chopped green chiles since they had not been in the tomatoes like the recipe calls for. My freinds who have tried RAVED! It's great over rice...but it's also fabulous alone as a thick stew. Try it...you'll LOVE it!

Very tasty.  Spicy but not too much.  We served this over a chicken burrito made with cream cheese and the flavors complimented each other nicely.

This is one dish we never get tired of. Easy to make and delicious, especially with Mexican food but great accompaniment with anything. I don't personally care for onions so I omit those. I ran out of cayenne and on a whim tried a few drops of habenero sauce and that has gotten rave reviews. Don't let the habenero frighten you, I use 2 to 3 drops for extra mild and 10-12 for spicy. Give this recipe a try, you'll find it will soon become a regular dinner menu item.

I took this to a BBQ and it got raves. A good amount of heat without being to much. Tone down the cayenne, if you don't like it spicy. I will make this again for sure!

This was amazing! The changes I made were to reduce the cayenne to a dash, use  2 tablespoons of brown sugar, and increase the chili powder to a tablespoon and the cinnamon to half a teaspoon. Oh, and I left out the cilantro because we don't like it. It makes enough to be the main dish for my family of three.

This dish is similar to one I had in a Cuban restaurant. I was very happy to find I could make this at home. I used agave syrup instead of sugar and it was just right. Sweet and spicy! These beans are an excellent complement to a Cuban sandwich. I spooned the mixture over rice, and made the perfect meatless meal. Thank you so much, Robin!

I’ve made it three times but right from the beginning I thought the amount of sugar and cayenne was way way too heavy. I use 1 tablespoon of sugar and a quarter teaspoon of cayenne and I added half of a lime. I serve it over Chinese noodles and grated cheddar cheese to make the dish complete.

I had leftover black beans I needed to use up, and this looked like a good recipe.  But the sugar ruined it for me. If I had left that out, the rest probably would have been good (though I left out the cilantro and cayenne because I didn't have any, so I'd like to try them next time). But sweet chili just didn't work for me. I kept adding more spices, extra tomatoes, salt, etc. to try to balance out the sweetness, but nothing worked. I might try this again sometime, but I definitely wouldn't add any sugar.

Absolutely delicious! 

I made one or two tweaks to fit the ingredients I had on hand. 

I added a chopped banana pepper to a can of stewed tomatoes. No cilantro (due to an allergy). 1 TBS of maple syrup instead of sugar. 

Everything else was as written. I have served this as a “breakfast chili” a few times. Love it more and more! Thank you!

My husband and I really enjoyed these on our tacos! The intial heat seems a bit powerful (we're "mild" people) and is well balanced once combined with other ingredients. The sweetness is pure bliss!

I made it and used some other items. I wanted to use some veggies before they went bad. I processed some celery, tomatoes, onion, carrots, and cilantro. I also added some frozen corn. I substituted honey for sugar and added some Siracha.  It turned out soooo yummy over some rice.

I love this recipe and what I like the most is that I can enjoy it hot or cold.  The only thing that I changed is that I use two cans of beans to cut down the powerful Cayenne Pepper.  Other than that, We Love It!

I liked this, but I didn't think it was fantastic. The sweet flavor was interesting...I don't think I've had the sweet/spicy combo before, so maybe it just wasn't what I was expecting it to be.
