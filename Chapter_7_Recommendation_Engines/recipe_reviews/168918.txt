Wow- super sweet!  We all liked them, but agree that they are almost too sweet. Next time I will use half the amount of cool whip and candy bars, which will help. Tip- make several hours ahead of time to give this a chance to cool in the fridge, much better that way.

This was soo yummy. I made some modifications for what I had on hand. I baked mine in a 9x9 pan, used half and half for the pudding (had some that needed to be used up), used a bag of toffee bits from the pantry instead of the candy bars, I spread 1/4 on the brownies after breaking them up, 1/2 on top of the pudding,and  the rest on top of the cool whip along with some drizzled chocolate since my brownie mix had a frosting packet with it. This was easy and utilized things I had on hand. Even my DH ate this and he is not much of a sweets eater!

This is rich and excellent! I used 1.75 bags of toffee bits already crushed instead of crushing the candy bars myself. Took it to a barbecue and it was a hit. Also used a dark chocolate brownie mix. Chocolate heaven!

Everyone loved this and it was so easy to prepare.  I made it in a 9x13 pan and used the toffee chips in a bag.  I think next time I might make 2 boxes of pudding however, this was incredible as is.  Thanks so much !

Yummy! We took this to our son Potluck Dinner for Boy Scouts. They all seem to enjoy it. I did only use 1/2 the pudding suggested and only 4 candy bars. EZ to make.

SUPER easy & quick - huge hit! Used lite cool whip and heath toffee pieces (saved time)- sprinkled them on top of pudding and then on top of whipped topping, then used caramel sundae topping - yum!! Definate keeper - may try with french vanilla pudding next time.

This was so yummy! I dont even normally like pudding, but it was so good. My son is in love with this. I changed a few things, i baked the brownies in an 8x8 pan( i like thick ones) used only about a 1/3 of a bag of toffee bits,and just dolloped the whip topping on each serving. Fantastic, i little sweet, but so good.

What's not to like?  Brownies, topped with more chocolate and toffee!  I even made the brownies following the low-fat method on the box, and you couldn't even tell with everything else going on.  I also just used toffee bits instead of the chocolate covered bars, and 1 container of whipped topping.  Pan size is not specified in the directions, and because I didn't want the brownie layer to be too thin, I used a 9X9 pan.  Using 16 ounces of whipped topping would have been way over-kill for this pan size, but may work if you are using a 9X13 pan.  Kids really loved this one!

This went over very well for all of my family.  If you love brownies and chocolate in general, this will melt in your mouth.  The only substitution I made was using the heat and serve chocolate pudding because it was all I had on hand.   For busy mom's, this dessert is pretty easy, goes together quickly, uses convenience box mixes, tastes terrific, and is an all around winner recipe! If you are afraid of it being too sweet, don't add the final layer of heath bar crumbles.

Made this for a holiday potluck and everyone loved it. I only used half (one tub) of the whipped topping called for, which easily covered a 13x9 size with a thick layer. No need for so much whipped cream. Also, I only used 6 Heath bars, not 8, and the brownies were totally covered in toffee.  I might make these again but will try making toffee from scratch (it's just butter and brown sugar) and pour it on top of the brownies, then put the pudding on top of that. Hmmm.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for a potluck at church.  Everyone loved it.  I was able to make the brownies in the morning before work and then finished when I got home.  I also used the bagged Heath pieces and I didn't use the whole bag.  Just enough to give it a crunch.  I might try nuts next time!  Thanks for an easy, yummy dessert!

Nice and easy recipe! I wanted it thick, so I used a 9x9 pan. One pudding mix was perfect for that size, and used only a dollop of whip cream on top of each piece. I didn't have toffee, so I used chocolate shavings. It's way better the next day, after it's chilled. Thank you!
