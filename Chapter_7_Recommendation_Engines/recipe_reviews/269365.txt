As always, 5 stars from this recipe submitter. Loved the chili flakes! I did end up adding another 1/3 cup barley after turning it off. The only barley I have in my area is quick cooking barley and I think it needed the extra for thickness. Loved this recipe and I've loved every recipe from this recipe submitter so far. Thanks Bren! Make her recipes...they are winners!!!

Made this yesterday.  It was great!  Everybody loved it.  Only thing I would change is adding 1 cup barley.
