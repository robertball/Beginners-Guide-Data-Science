This was so delicious!  It was definatley the hit of my Thanksgiving dinner, only wished I had doubled the recipe.  I set aside some of the punch and froze it in ice cube trays to keep the punch cold longer, I added mandarin oranges to the cubes for decoration.  FABULOUS

I made this for our Christmas Party 2001 and instead of apple slices, I floated an ice ring with fresh cranberries frozen inside.  The punch was a GIANT HIT!  Some people added a little to their champagne or their white wine. It made such a hit my mother in law heard the reviews and asked me to make it at the family celebration.  Try this one, you'll like it!

I used this recipe for a Family Christmas gathering for 18 people. I made a double batch and needless to say there wasn't any left. The kids and the adults loved it. The cranberry and gingerale give it a little more kick and a little less sweetness. The apple and orange juice give it a unique flavor. My aunt just asked me for the recipe for her granddaughter's christening. If you make it I recommend you make a lot, it goes fast.

I made two batches of this for our Thanksgiving family gathering.  One for the kids - made with ginger ale; the other for adults- made with champagne.  They were both a big hit!  We added ice cubes made of gingerale with a manderin orange slice frozen in each cube. My brother in law said "This really tastes like Sangria !" 
I had to quickly make another adult batch - it was yummed up !

This was so simple and delicious--I will definately make it again.  I like the look of sliced oranges on top better than apples.

Everyone at Thanksgiving dinner very much enjoyed this punch.  I froze cranberries into ice cubes to give a little extra visual punch!

Delicious!  I made this for a bridal shower, and the ladies loved it.  Beautiful color, and a really wonderful taste...not your typical punch.  Will definitely make this again for special events.  (Little tip--when making an ice ring, take into consideration the size of your punch bowl.  My punch bowl was too small for the ice ring I'd made in my bundt pan, and I had to wait a bit for the ice to melt before I could serve the punch.)

Very good.  Had a little bite to it from the cranberry, so I added about half a cup of sugar.  Tastes similar to one of the Twister drinks...  Nice change from all the syrupy sweet punches.

This is delightful.  I made a double batch for a cookie exchange party - and had 7 requests for the recipe in the first 15 minutes . We used champagne - not Asti - and floated fresh cranberries and very thin mandoline-cut slices of Granny Smith apple on top.  It made for a lovely holiday punch.  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

Great recipe, make a half batch minus the ginger ale,  ahead of time, lay out your ice cube trays or dishes and place mandarine orange pieces and cranberries in each one and add the punch mix, then freeze, mix the full batch as directed, then add the frozen decoration, as the frozen pieces melt they will only add to the flavor of the punch instead of watering it down.

While it was quick, I would suggest fresca instead of Ginger ale to cut some of the tartness. I used it in a black kettle with floating ice hands for a halloween party.

I had never made punch before so when I was asked to bring beverages for a bridal shower I looked on this site and found this recipe.  It was more than excellent!  I got lots of compliments at the shower for the delicious punch, so much that I decided to make it again the next day for a church potluck.  Again it was a hit. Thank you!

Perhaps with the addition of champagne this is tasty, but this blend pretty much tastes how you would expect: like juice mixed with ginger ale.  It does present well and the color is excellent.  Otherwise I didn't find it very exciting.

Yum!  Very easy and everyone loved the floating apple look.  I was worried that they would brown but I had this punch out for hours and they didn't even start to turn.

Wonderful flavored punch.  I chose this punch because it did not call for x-tra sugars or heavy syrups.  Just a nice tasting variety of juices and soda.

Yummy. The floating apple slices are a nice touch. It really was perfect for our Thanksgiving dinner party. Harvest-like and not overly spiced like other apple-based punches.

I made this for my daughter's communion party and the adults as well as the kids loved it! Grown men were drinking this non alcoholic punch instead of beer!  It is a great unique punch recipe. Thanks!

I had this at my baby shower.  I was reluctant to try - I don't like apple juice.  I am glad I did - this is the most refreshing punch I have ever had.  Everyone loved it.  It went fast!

My assignment for in-law Thanksgiving-festive drink.  I was worried, but decided on this recipe due to it's simple portable ingredients.  The many people who reviewed it were right!  It was a big hit and I even got requests for the recipe.  It will become a holiday favorite I'm sure.  I adjusted the ingredients a bit for the size of crowd I was serving.  I used one gallon of apple juice, 64 oz of cranberry juice, a carton of orange juice, and two 2-liter bottles of ginger ale. I then slices clementines to serve on top.  I put the ingredients in the freezer for just a couple hours because I wanted them ice cold and the orange juice got slushy, but that was a happy accident!  It was great!

Delicious.  I like it so much I made it twice in one week.  The second time I used White Grap-Raspberry Concentrate (because they where out of Cranberry) It was really good but I like the Cranberry version a little better

My family pretty much DEMANDS this drink when we have big get-togethers now. I first served it a year ago at Thanksgiving. My 3-year-old calls it "Thanksgiving Punch," no matter when we make it! It's fantastic!

Made this for a Baby Shower and this was my first time making a punch.  It was very good.  I would suggest doubling the recipe.  This was gone in no time and there was only eight people at the shower.

I made this punch for my sister's baby shower and it tasted really good. I floated mandarin oranges in it rather than apples.  Very refreshing and very easy to make.  Unfortunately, although I drank 4 glasses of it, no one was really interested in it so it went to waste.

Made it with a 3-year-old and a 7-year-old.  They thought they were hot stuff being able to pour the liquids into the punch bowl. They loved everything about this punch and asked for it the next day.  For me?  Not the best punch I've ever had.. not by a long shot. Used this recipe exactly, then tried tweaking it in terms of the juice concentrations to cut the sweetness. My husband took a swig of the original recipe and said it was far too sweet.  On Day Two, though, I mixed the juices and put in the fridge so that the kids can add their own soda.  That helped a lot.  After reading the rave reviews here, am wondering if the brand of ginger ale matters. I used a store brand which may have been sweeter than say, Canada Dry.  

I'll keep trying this for the sake of the kids.

OK, revised this upward. Way upward.  It is now the definite favorite in our house without any soda.  The juices blend well together and we have a pitcher in the fridge 24/7.  I did find that the best "fizz" is cranberry Sierra Mist which may only be out for the holidays. Also tried it last night with sparking apple juice and that was tasty as well.

Much too sweet for my taste.  Several other people made the same comment at our party last night.  I don't think I'll be making this again.

12/28/05 - I did end up making this once more because I had baught too many ingredients.  This time I substituted 1/4 of the Ginger Ale for water, and it was VERY good.

Was expecting more of a flavour hit with this but it just didn't deliver. Used ready made cranberry juice as I can't get frozen concentrate here. That may have been the reason it wasn't quite punchy enough.

This is an easy punch to make and adjust on your own.  I needed a nice punch for a birthday party for my 87 y.o. mother.  This was a huge hit.  Thanks for sharing it with us, Michele!  I will definitely use it again.

I was looking forward to usinge this recipe (for a very large gathering...at least 200 people) because of all the great reviews of it.  I went and bought all the gingerale, apple juice and orange juice I needed.  When I went to look for the frozen cranberry juice there was non to be found at the leading stores in our area.  I used regular bottled cranberry juice out of necessity...I am I afraid I cannot rave about the punch after all this.

Wow!  My family loved this punch.  We usually get sparkling cider for special occasions, but I was looking for something of a larger quantity for a large dinner party and this punch was perfect.  Everyone had several helpings.  I served it ice cold, I had refrigerated all of the ingredients prior mixing them.  All of the kids liked it better than the sparkling cider that comes in a bottle.  I will be making it again and again.

This is very quick, easy, and tasty. My store did not have frozen cranberry juice so I used frozen white grape/raspberry instead and it was delicious. Next time I'll double it though because everyone wanted more when it was gone.

Made this for my daughter's birthday party and it was gone before I could blink! This is so yummy that everyone was constantly asking for more. I recommend having enough ingredients to make a 2nd, 3rd, or 4th batch! The apples are a really tasty snack after soaking in the punch for a while

Perfect blend of flavors! I love that it's not overly sweet like some punches can be. Super quick and easy to throw together.

It was a hit, next time I'll use 7-up instead of ginger ale since they taste the same, I didn't know this till I bought the ginger ale and tried it, duh!

**5 STARS** I made this today for Thanksgiving & it was such a hit!! I used Ocean Spray Cranberry Juice instead of the concentrate.  I will definitely make this again!! ~Update~ Made this again Christmas Day, was enjoyed by all ~NICE~  ** ANOTHER UPDATE **  Alright, this punch is the most requested drink here at my house! It is available 24/7 now & my kids range from 9 to 20 years old.  What I do is I mix the cranberry, apple, & orange juices & keep that ready in the fridge.  The kids fill their glass about 3/4 of the way with the juice mixture & the rest of the way with diet Gingerale (that I also keep handy in the fridge).  It's nice to know they are getting something healthy to drink instead of just plain soda.

This morning I put together this punch for a baby shower, and it was delightfully well received.

I wanted to make a bigger batch and couldn't find cranberry juice concentrate at my grocery store, so I altered the recipe like this:

1 gallon 100% apple juice
64 oz 100% cranberry juice
1/2 a can of frozen orange juice concentrate
2 liters gingerale

and I took the tip of a previous reviewer and floated orange slices on the top, which really looked beautiful.

The punch was a bit hit, and I'm eager for another occasion to make it!

Everybody loved this.  The thing I liked the most about this recipe is that it isn't loaded with a ton of sugar and is not as sweet as some punch recipes tend to be.  It is very quick and easy.  I floated sliced oranges on top but I think frozen cranberries, as other reviews suggested, would look nice.

Tried this for a bridal shower recently and it was a huge hit. Many women asked me for the recipe. Instead of using frozen cranberry juice concentrate, I used apple juice concentrate and cranberry juice instead of apple juice. Turned out excellent!

This one got RAVE reviews. I only made one change. I didn't realize it called for frozen cranberry concentrate and I used regular cranberry juice in equal parts as the apple juice. Worked great.

Made this last night for my party for the non alcoholic crowd.  Doubled the recipe and it was all gone by the end of the evening.  Even my drinkers were tasting it. Very refreshing and festive with the floating apples.  Will most certainly make this again!

This is a winner!!  The punch is so tasty.  I used the idea of the frozen cranberry ring rather than the apple slices.  It was such a hit on Thanksgiving, after making two batches, that we are now going to make it for Christmas as well.

This was amazing! I couldn't find cranberry juice concentrate, so I used passion fruit juice concentrate instead. So delicious. Also, I doubled it, and used a full 4 liters of ginger ale. It was the only thing totally consumed by the end of the party!

I doubled the recipe for 14 people this Christmas and still ran out.  Served it in half servings per glass and then added either champagne or ginger ale.  Terrific winter punch! Repeating for New Years!

Delicious punch! We made this for our Christmas party, and it was a great non-alcoholic beverage for those who didn't want to drink. I didn't add any ice - the chilled apple juice and orange juice + the frozen cranberry juice kept it nice and cool all day. There wasn't a sip left at the end of evening. Sweet (but not overly sweet!) and tasty!

So good! I made it for Christmas brunch. Not a drop was left! I did add one cup of Apple Cider to it. The only thing I would do differently would be to double it. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this punch last night for a holiday party, and it was an absolute hit!  I doubled the recipe and it was completely gone by the end of the night.  Everyone raved about the punch, and ate the apple slices too - a definite keeper, and it's so pretty too!

I always want to serve warm cider for Thanksgiving but it is often 80 degrees here in Texas. LOL Thsi was a wonderful substitute! We loved it! I made up teh juice in a punch bowl & then added ginger ale to teh kid's glasses & champagne to the grown-ups. The only changes I made were to float a couple of frozen cranberries in w/ teh apple slices. Thanks Michele O'Sullivan...this will be a welcome addition to our future Thanksgivings!

My husband and I thought it was delicious and so did the kids. I was serving it for adults though and none of them enjoyed it(too sweet) until I spiked it with champagne. I would make again, for a different group of adults.

I had planned to make this Christmas eve, but decided we already had enough stuff to eat/drink.  So instead, we had it Christmas morning with breakfast and it was a huge hit.  Everyone loved it!  I only bought enough to make a single batch and wished I would have had the ingredients to make more.  I'll definitely be making this again.  I didn't use the apple slices as I just made it in a pitcher for breakfast.

Made this today for my sister's baby shower and yum!!  The only slight change I made was adding two 2L bottles of soda.  I read some of the reviews and wondered if it might be too sweet, but not at all - it was perfect! I also had a bottle of champagne on the side for those who wanted to spike it, which was also delish!  Will definitely use again.

Yes!  I've finally found my "go-to" punch recipe!  Delicious and easy.  I've make it four times in the past week and everyone loves it, from kids to adults.  Made it non-alcoholic with champagne on the side...the best of both worlds!  Looks very festive in a beverage server with floating apples and fresh cranberries.

Made this punch for holidays and it was great for non alcohol drinkers. Used Granny Smith which added some green to the reddish color. Very delicious. Would make it again.

This recipe was a bit bitter but I think adding some sugar would definately make it better.  It was beautiful to the eye.  I made mine into more of a slushy form, it was really good then I had ice rings with cranberries inside it added a nice touch to the punch bowl.

Always a fun punch to serve at bigger events.  You can also substitute Sprite for Gingerale which makes it a little sweeter.

This punch is really good - I used one bottle of champagne instead of the ginger ale and within 15 minutes had to mix more.  I was asked for the recipe many times during the evening!  Delicious!

Great recipe!  I've served this at several parties and it's always gone.  I have used ginger ale and champagne and both are outstanding.  Garnish with sliced oranges for the prettiest appearance!

I made this for my son's first birthday party.  The night before, I mixed everything except for the ginger ale.  I froze four small 1/2 cup sized bowls full.  At the time for the party I dumped the punch in a bowl, dropped in the frozen punch and poured in the ginger ale. I loved it although some thought it was too tart.

Absolutely delicious! I used a little less ginger ale and added about half a bottle of champagne. It was a huge hit!

This is delicious!  Not as sweet as the usual drink mix and sugar punches... just better!  My Thanksgiving company loved it.  The second time I made it, I used 48 oz. of apple juice to make it go farther.  Still delicious!!

Extremely easy to make, but makes a nice presentation especially once you cut the apples up and let them float in the punch.  I made this for our Thanksgiving dinner, and my whole family loved it, even my 3 picky teenage nephews.

I have tried this one without the floating apples several times since seeing it.  The cranberry gives it a tart taste that is refreshing.  We used it as our special drink for Christmas.  I use frozen apple juice and a whole 2 liter bottle of Ginger Ale and even used an orange fruit juice that we usually have on hand to keep from buying extra OJ just for this drink.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving this year (with champagne). My only mistake was not making enough. People were actually waiting in line for more! I have already had several requests for the recipe and I will definitely be making it for Christmas!

My four year old son loved this and he's hard-to-please!  I found it okay and would drink again but it's not a must for me...possibly because I'm not much of a juice drinker.  Will definitely make again for kids though.

Get together with the girls for Chickweekend every few months, it was the day drink of choice.  Used half the ginger ale and a bottle of champagne, light and very refreshing and a little champagne always makes the day better.

Very Yummy!  I made this for a baby shower.  I cut the apples to resemble lilly pads and placed a rubber ducky in the bowl.  Everyone loved it!  Will be making again soon!

This is one of the best punches I have ever tasted.  I make it for all my parties and I get a lot of requests to bring it when I go to someone else's party.  Instead of a sliced apple, I use a large can of pineapple rings and the juice.  It adds a nice flavour.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!!!

I have used this recipe several times and is always a hit.  Baby Showers, Bridal Showers with champagne, and it has become a regular at church functions.  I find it works well to freeze all ingredients the night before and then add the ginger ale or champagne just before serving.  Enjoy!

I served this at a Memorial Service and everyone just loved it.  The color theme was orange so the punch matched!  I also like this recipe because it makes just 12 servings or multiply it many times for 150 people.  The apples looked very nice floating in the punch as well.

This was a huge hit at our Thanksgiving dinner.  We replaced the ginger ale with 2 bottles of Asti Spumante.  For garnish, we floated a layer of fresh cranberries and placed orange slices on top.  We served it in a drink dispenser on a wrought iron stand.  It was beautiful as well as tasty!

Good but would alter next time. I might make it more 'festive' by using apple sparkling cider rather than standard juice.  All the juices in this punch really tame down the carbonation from the ginger ale, and it ends up being a fancy... well... juice!

This was a yummy punch I made for a church fellowship. It was much more economical than apple cider. It does not have a real noticeable apple taste but it is really good.

I made this for our Christmas dinner.  Very crisp and refreshing.  Not too sour or sweet, just right! Great flavor.  My mother in law could not get enough.  I think she would have drank the entire pitcher!  Will be serving for ALL of my future dinners.

I made this for our thanksgiving dinner, and it was soo delicious. Everyone loved it kids and adults alike. I froze mandarin oranges in ice cubes and put them in there, it was so cute. The apples taste really good after floating for a bit too! i plan on making it again for my christmas eve party tonight. :) very good recipe, i'd recomend making it. :)

Everyone loved this punch at Christmas... I gave Mom the list of ingredients for this and she forgot the apple juice.. We just added more of the orange.  As the punch bowl got low we just kept pouring more cranberry, gingerale and OJ... The apples on top were pretty and added a little bit of flavor as well! :)

Delicious! I used frozen cranberry fruit cocktail, which is sweeter than just cranberry juice, so to nip the tartness I added 2 tbps. sugar for every 2 cups of punch. Enjoy is yummy recipe!

A good, easy autumn punch and a pretty colour.  Everyone said they liked it.  It's easy to adjust quantities to serve a crowd.  I followed the advice to use orange slices to garnish; I mixed navel oranges and clementines for a fun variety of sizes.

Excellent Punch. I served this at my son's birthday party and everyone finished 2 batches. Since it was near Halloween, I froze some of the apple juice in latex (no powder) gloves and dropped it in the punch when ready to serve. People got a kick out of the hands floating in the punch. I will definitely make this again over the holidays.

This recipe served 8 adults and 2 kids well. I used sprite instead of ginger ale just because it's what I had on hand. My mom stated "This is good" (and she ALWAYS has something to say). I will use it many times again I am sure.

We have this punch every year for the holidays.  It is delicious and a nice change from the regular beverages that are served.  I like to add just a bit more ginger ale than is called for.

I made this punch for Thanksgiving and it was not my favorite, but it wasn't bad either. Everyone else thought it was just OK too, but they ended drinking it all! Although I loved the way it looked with the apple cut up in it. But I probably won't be using this recipe again.

Absolutely fabulous!  We doubled the recipe and served this at Christmas and there was nothing left!  I'm definitely making it for New Year's, and I'm never going to buy the bottled sparkling cider again.

This was just okay.  I guess I didn't really like the taste of the ginger ale.  Maybe I'll reduce that if I make it again.

This is great for the kiddies at a holiday party. They feel included with their "own" type of drink. And for those adults that choose non-alcholic drinks, this punch can still look pretty in a lovely glass with a garnish.

This was pretty good, but the cranberry taste was a little much. I just added more apple juice. I think next time I might add a little sugar, too. It was really tart. Other than that, not bad.

I made this for a recent babyshower I hosted. Everyone liked it very much. Since the theme was ladybugs...I froze plastic ladybugs into a ring and floated it in the punchbowl, cute touch. I did not add the sliced apples since the ice ring was in the way.

I could not find frozen cranberry juice concentrate anywhere, so used grape instead.  Turned out ok, but the grape flavor really overwhelmed all of the others and I think cranberry would have done so too.  I was hoping for something more apple-y and fall-like.

Very good!  Just made this for Thanksgiving and it was perfect for those who didn't want anything alcoholic Although it would probably be excellent spiked with rum).  Would make again.

I was looking for a Christmas party punch and tried this one.  It got compliments and recipe requests .... and I really liked it too, even though I'm not usually a huge punch fan. It's a tasty blend of flavors without being overly sweet.  Yum!  Will definitely make it again.

this was okay, but too tart.  We watered it down a lot with more soda & apple juice.  I also added cranberries with the apple for looks.  I am not sure what I would change, but it's a good base.

My mother-in-law has made this for the last two years at the holidays and we love it! I made it for the first time myself recently. I cannot find frozen cranberry juice anywhere, so I had to use another flavor. I chose White Grape with Raspberry (my MIL uses mixed berry). I also neglected to read that it only calls for 1 1/2 liters of ginger ale and I used the whole 2 liter. It's fantastic! I'm making it next week for my son's Scout Christmas party! Yum!

This punch doesn't look very appetizing, (it turns brown when you add the orange juice), but it tastes great. It is perfect for any function you would hold during the fall season.

A great drink for thanksgiving and birthday parties. Sometimes you might want to go a little easy on the apple slices (if you choose to use them). My kids really complained about them. Otherwise, the punch is amazing!!! (I don't really understand why the kids don't like the slices, they taste almost as amazing as the punch itself once they've soaked for a bit!

This punch was very easy and quick to prepare. I served it at a bachelorette party and it was pretty good. It was mixed with gingerale and then some of the girls put some champagne in it for a kick.

Excellent punch!  We didn't change a thing.  Doubled the recipe for a group of 15 and it was gone in no time.  Everyone went for more than seconds.  Plan on making it for the next party. Thanks

I made this for my daughter and son-in-law's coed baby shower. It was a huge hit with both the men and women. Several people asked for the recipe. I would definitely make it again. I am so glad I made a double batch because it saved me from having to make a second one. The only thing different I did was I froze blueberries in apple juice  small bowls to add to the punch as "ice."

I couldn’t find frozen cranberry juice concentrate, only cran-apple so I went to the local natural/organic market and got a bottle of unsweetened cranberry juice concentrate and added to taste, it was the perfect accompaniment with Thanksgiving dinner. This time, dinner was with non-drinkers so we used ginger ale but the next time...and there will be a next time...we’re going to use champagne. I highly recommend this recipe, it is perfectly balanced and quite festive!

I made this using a juice blend of cranberry and blackberry and blackberry ginger ale.  To continue the theme, I added blackberries and orange slices with the apple slices.  On the side of the punch bowl, I placed a bottle of spiced rum for those who wanted a spiked punch.  Very good!

I made a batch of this for our housewarming party this October and it was a hot for afuots and kids alike! It almost filled my 3 gallon drink dispenser and was all gone by the end of the party. Since I made it nonalcoholic I spiked mine with some champagne in the glass and it was delish!

This was VERY sweet (which the kids loved), which is why I'm giving it 4 stars. I served with liquor (spiced rum, honey whiskey, champagne) on the side, for adults wanting a little something "extra". Great flavor, but very sweet. Would recommend ginger ale over lemon-lime soda to cut down sweetness. Kids had leftovers the next day, and tasted similar to sparkling cider. Thanks for the recipe!

Made this for a baby shower held in Dec. 2016.  Was very well received by guests & Mom-to-be!!  Used frozen apple juice & cranapple juice from the bottle and bottled oj. Didn't have gingerale, so used Sprite.  Also put mandarin oranges & frozen cranberries to float in the punch.  Was visually a lovely punch & was tasty, too. Several guests asked for recipe.  Definitely a keeper.

This punch is great! I make it every year for Thanksgiving and my family just drinks it right up. I like to float thinly sliced apple rings and cranberries in it to make it more festive.

I made this drink for Thanksgiving and it was a HIT! I had to refill 3 times. I ended up running out of gingerale so I used 7-up.  I will definltey be mking this again.  I added fuiji apples and fresh cranberries.

I made this with the champagne substitute instead of ginger ale and everyone seemed to like it. It was pretty easy to make although I had a tough time finding cranberry concentrate at the store. It was perfect for a fall wedding/baby shower.

Very tasty! Loved the apple garnish, had almost all the ingredients on hand so I was already excited to make it. Used it as is for a kid friendly event then brought home the leftovers and added sparkling spirits to it for adults. I recommend doubling the recipe so you have enough for both! We definitely be making this again :)

This punch was a crowd pleaser. I made two different batches for the birthday party. The first one I made exact to recipe. the second batch I had "help" from my two year old and 2 l of ginger ale went in along with extra 12 oz of apple juice and the result was still excellent. I love forgiving recipes.

Super easy punch with ingredients that are inexpensive. I've made this for several holiday gatherings and other family events. It's good with sparkling wine and a little vodka for the over-21 crowd.

This is a go to for me.  Always good.  Sometimes I replace the ginger ale with sparkling wine for the adults, or just add vodka.  Good either way!

Not sure why this is a 5-star...I had to add a few tablespoons of sugar. I found this punch too tart for my family's taste.

I was looking last minute for a not-so-sweet punch to accompany a Thanksgiving luncheon for 165 people (from all over the world) today.  Found this and it was perfect!!  The color is wonderful, it's easy to throw together, and it has just the right amount of tartness to counterbalance the sweetness of the pies for dessert.  Added a couple of frozen cranberries to each glass for an added touch.  Will definitely make this again.

This was very delicious! I think some people may have had less than satisfactory results based on what brands of juice they were using. There is a huge difference in flavor on different juice brands, particularly orange juice. I bought Old Orchard apple juice frozen concentrate, prepared it and used the recommended amount. Also, I used Old Orchard brand "Cranberry Blend" frozen concentrate because that was all I could find. I purchased a not-from-concentrate pulp-free orange juice (like Simply Orange) because I am a picky OJ drinker. The overall flavor wasn't overpoweringly apple or cranberry- it was very refreshing and not too sweet.

This is great!!!  We don't drink so this was really good.  I decided to make this last minute and our local store did not have frozen cranberry concentrate so I used Fruit Punch concentrate and it worked super.  I will however make this again and try the cranberry!!

Served this at T-giving dinner, everyone loved it.  Mixed all juices together night before and added ginger ale at last minute to save on prep time.

I made this for thanksgiving.  It was yummy, but not like "woa!!!". The apple slices gave it a nice touch though.  I'll make this one again.  Thanks!

I made this for a ladies luncheon I had and it was great!  I used the apple slices for a festive look and it was so tasty...even my kids loved it!  I will try it with Champagne in place of ginger ale next time-that sould be even more tasty!!!!!

This is really good punch.  I made this for a dinner party and wanted something non-alcoholic; this was a really good choice.

By far my favorite punch! It has a beautiful rich red color, and it disappears fast at parties! I've had to make quite a few copies of this recipe to give to those who requested it.

Love this recipe, I couldn't find frozen cranberry juice, so I substituted white grape juice with fabulous results. Great any time of year.

Served this punch at my father in-law's memorial services a couple of weeks ago.  I could not keep the punch bowl full! There were at least 150 people or more there. It was a huge hit. Everyone wanted the recipe.

This is very close to the punch my grandmother has made for Christmas and New Year's for as long as I can remember.  The only difference is that she garnishes with orange rather than apple slices, which I prefer the look of.
