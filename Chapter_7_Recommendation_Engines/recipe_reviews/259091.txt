Was on the hunt for a mango lassi recipe that wasn't just yogurt, mango and sugar, as I KNOW every lassi I've ever had was spiced in some way.  This recipe hits the lassi spot!!

This was very tasty! I used orange juice for the mango juice. I used lactose free yogurt. It made 2 eight ounce glasses. My son really enjoyed drinking this after his workout.
