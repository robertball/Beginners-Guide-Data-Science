I used margerine in place of the butter, added a teaspoon of garlic powder to the melted margerine mixture and sprinkled a little parmesan cheese over the biscuits before I baked them. I followed the instructions on the biscuit container when I baked them, 350* for 14-17 minutes. Mine were done at 15 minutes. My family ate every single biscuit. I paired this with Garlic and Ham Scrambled Eggs.

This is a quick and easy way to get fresh bread on the table even if it isn't homemade. I added a little minced fresh garlic, but otherwise stuck to the recipe as written--except for the cooking time! Be careful, as the package directions state to bake these for 8-11 minutes, not 15-20!  Mine were done at 11 minutes. Great little biscuits, not overpowering at all with the herbs. Fluffy and light, moist, and pretty too!

Add a litle crushed garlic to the main mix and sprinkle with grated parmesean cheese before baking.

Very good and super easy to make.  I would recommend following the cooking time on the biscuit package.  I almost over-cooked them at 13 mins.

Very Good. The only reason I did not give this a 5 star is the cooking time. I suggest to follow the package directions for cooking. I didn't even pay attention to the package directions until it was too late. Mine came out a little burnt on the bottom. Next time I may sprikle a little bit of parm cheese on top and see how that tastes. This recipe is a great way of making a regular canned biscuit into something special. If your thinking of making these, go ahead and do so, you won't be dissapointed!

We enjoyed these. The flavor was really nice. A good way to doctor up canned biscuits.

These were fantastic.  I loved everything about the biscuits.  Try to chop the fresh herbs as small as you can.

This is a pretty good recipe. Things I would change is use less basil and rosemary. There was no need for that much. Also change the amount of time it is cooked. Taste wise the only problem is that you want to eat them right away because they don't taste good later. The fresh flavor is incredible. I'll admit I ate three.

Very quick and tasty variation to regular dinner rolls. I made this for company and it was gone before I knew it! Thanks!
