Well I did make a few adjustments as needed per my refrigerator inventory, but nonetheless it turned out SO GOOD!  First off I used gluten-free bread.  I buttered both sides because I added a little garlic powder and crushed rosemary to the inside and wanted it to stick.  The extra spice really makes a difference. For cheese I had baby swiss and cheddar slices and made sure I had a slice on each side of the sandwish so as when it melts it helps hold everything in. I diced my avacados and crumbled the bacon. Then grilled on low with a lid on my pan. It was amazing and a sandwish I will add to my make often list.
