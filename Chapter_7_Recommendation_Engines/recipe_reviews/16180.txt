Turkey burgers tend to lack flavor on their own and can be dry. I like to add chopped onion, garlic and onion powders, black pepper and either lite teriyaki or soy sauce to the ground meat.

These were great! I substituted the beef bouillon for a couple eggs. Added some chopped onion and seasoned the turkey with parsely, garlic powder and salt & pepper.

Very easy, but lacks taste.  I wouldn't waste my time with this recipe again.

I'm not a big fan of beef boullion, but it really did make the burgers taste more like beef.  Neat trick.  However, these are only moist enough if you use "ground turkey" rather than "ground turkey breast."  But then they are definitely not "low fat" coming in at almost 50% calories from fat.  Will try again adding some conditioning, such as egg whites (or egg substitute) and ground oats or whole wheat bread crumbs.  Thanks for the idea about the beef boullion.

They were very good and very moist. I only used 1 beef cube and added 1/2 tsp. salt, 1 tsp. soy sauce, a couple of grinds of pepper, and a tsp. of granulated garlic. I am definately going to make this recipe again!

I have to say, I was skeptical making this for my family (I will try just about anything for myself). I added about 1/3 cup red bell pepper chopped finely and 1/2 cup onion. I only added 1 buillon cube crushed. THIS WAS GREAT! My picky husband loved it and my 10 year old wanted more! I have to say, next time I will double the recipe as 20 oz of ground turkey only made 4 burgers. THANKS Rich!

Definitely easy.  Tasty but I was looking for something with a little more flavor.  Good, but it didn't knock my socks off.

Sorry for the bad review but these Definitely don't taste "just like beef" and are actually quite bland. Go for extra lean ground beef if you want a beef burger.  Go for a more flavorful recipe if you want turkey burgers.

Turkey burgers that don't taste like turkey....these were fantastic. Normally they come out dry and PLAIN. I added onion and 1 beef bouillon cube, garlic and onion salt.
