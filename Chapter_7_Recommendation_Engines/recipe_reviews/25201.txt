I was concerned when making this stew if it would seem like it was missing something since there are so few ingredients.  My husband and I both LOVED this stew.  It was very flavorful & filling and didn't need anything else other than crusty bread to soak up the stew.  I didn't use a beer but added extra beef stock instead.  I also floured the meat before cooking - it seemed to thicken up the stew.  I cooked it for 3 hours & the meat was tender & perfect.  Great recipe.

This is AMAZING, crazy good!!!  I make it quite often.  I use cans of Rotel diced tomatoes with chilies, and I do add sliced mushrooms, and saut√© with the onions.  I don't season or flour the meat cubes before browning at all.  There is no need to.  The spices, beer (I use Sam Adams Boston Lager) meat, tomatoes, etc, all work together very nicely to make a delicious dish.  I eat this as is, or in burritos, tacos, the best super nachos ever,  on a bun as a delicious twist on a sloppy joe, put leftovers in your spaghetti sauce, endless meals with this one.  Add more seasonings or peppers if you like real spicy, or cut them out if need too.  You'll still get a great dish.  By far, my favorite recipe on AR, and I love a lot of them!

Yum,Yum,Yum!

This is soooo good! I made a few changes. I browned the meat, onions, and garlic and put it in the crockpot instead of cooking them on the stove. I feel that it could of used a bit more beer, so next time I'll use a whole bottle for 3 servings instead of half a bottle.

I have been cooking for 40 years and will say this recipe should always get 5 stars.It is delicious and when someone says it is bland maybe taste buds are shot.lol I also hate when someone changes the recipe and gives it a low rating.My rating is based on ease of cooking,flavor,costs and how much is left after eating.It is a great meal with my homemade french bread on a snowy day.

Really nice - almost surprisingly so. I thought I was going to play with this recipe, and perhaps thicken it, but it did some excellent stuff while it was cooking and turned out really well without my help. The broth is rich, but simple, and does enough thickening on it's own. I threw some cilantro and fresh jalepeno on top and called it delicious. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this as written. It came out great and was thick without using flour. I chopped up some carrots and threw them in also. Excellent.

This is a great recipe that is very easy. I read the reviews and floured the meat before frying. I used more beef broth and left out the beer. I also threw it all in a crock pot after frying up the meat and cooked it on high for 5 hours. We will be having this again.

This was outstanding! I used frozen, roasted New Mexico chiles instead of canned and simmered closer to 3 1/2 hours. The meat was tender and the flavor was wonderful.

I have made this recipe for my family quite a few times and we always enjoy it.  I usually make it with pork, rather than beef and adjust the spiciness to suit our preferences.  I have also halved the recipe, which also worked well.  It is excellent served with rice.  We also like to top it with sour cream.

I just read this recipe from my email and after reading the recipe ingredients and reviews, I just wanted to share a comment. 
Try the recipe first. By looking at the ingredients, I find it hard to believe it would be bland.
After trying, then alter the recipe to your liking. I find it hard to understand when people try a recipe, doesn't care for it and says they won't make it again without trying to perk it up. I love the reviews when people share their twist on the recipe. Many great ideas!

I'm sorry but this dish is completely flavorless.  The only good thing I can say is the chuck (stewing meat) comes out very tender but any meat will simmered for 2 1/2 hours.

Excellent dish!  I made this according to directions, even tho i was a little short on beef.  To give it substance, I served it over homemade corn tortilla chips, and topped it with a dollop of sour cream.  Really gave it a southwest flavor!  Will make again and again.

I love this recipe. I used a can of 'hot' green chilles and that gave it a real kick; also added juice from one lime.

This was excellent!  I browned a chuck roast in my pressure cooker.  Removed it and sauted the onions and garlic. Added everything else along with the beef and cooked it at 15 lbs pressure for about 50 minutes.  I served it over brown rice and cornbread on the side.  This is a keeper!

I didn't have much beef, so I halved the recipe. Other than that I didn't make any changes. We really liked this and will make it again. Served it with tortilla chips.

I loved this stew. The only thing I changed on the original recipe was I ommitted the beer, and added 1.5 c beef broth, total. It also made for good leftovers. I heated leftovers on the stove, and added a can of corn, a can of black beans, and another can of green chilies and simmered for 45 minutes. Turned out great!

A nice recipe in case you like the beef and the adding of beer gives it a special touch. I didn't use so much beer however!

Thought of this more as a chili recipe than a stew recipe. Served all by itself with a little cheese sprinkled on top.  Liked it better than regular chili.  Very Yummy!!

This was delicious. I added some carrots and potatoes and used tomatoes with chiles since I didnt'have any canned green chile peppers. I used the crockpot and it was very tender and tasty.

This is the best Green Chilie Stew ever!  I doubled the recipe, used a large roasting pan, and put it in the oven at 350 degrees. I would use a crock pot if singling it. I didn't have a beer so I left that out, but added a couple of bay leaves off my tree.  It made a wonderful Shabbat meal!!

I love green chilies so I was looking forward to it but it was ok.  It seemed like a dish that wasn't sure if it wanted to be a chili or beef stew.

I follow the recipe exactly. I add dark beer. Potatoes and carrots at the end. Great taste with a kick at the end. My family love it.

I am giving this a qualified three stars. I cooked it in a crock pot instead of on the stove top and that may have made a considerable difference in the final product. The recipe seems to be a cross between a traditional green chili stew (made with pork instead of beef) and my Tex-Mex chili recipe.  Seemed like an interesting idea so I gave it a shot.  I substituted Muir Glen diced tomatoes for the Roma tomatoes and I prepared it in a slow cooker.  I think that was a mistake; it turned out more like a soup than a stew.  It was good but not what I expected.  I will make it again but will use Rotel tomatoes with green chilies instead of diced tomatoes and I will roast and dice Anaheim's of Hatch green chilies instead of using canned.  I will also dust the meat with flour before browning.  I will let you know what happens :-)

I didn't really care for this much, but my husband ate his whole bowl. My kiddo was kind of indifferent. I was worried that it wouldn't be flavorful enough so I added about half a can of tomato paste. I probably made a bad choice in the type of beer I used, but it was all that was in the house. I think I'll probably stick to the more veggie-based stews in the future.

Made it today. Wonderful flavors and super easy. I followed the recipe but may need to add more beef broth for additional liquid. I will make this again for sure. Easy on the food budget too.

We loved this stew. Made it the first time per directions ( minus the beer-due to medication), and the second time we tried the same recipe but used pork.  Both are great over noodles, rice or just with crusty bread  and a salad. The second time I did add a little more thickening , but this was a matter of personal choice.    I may tweak it a bit more to suit our personal tastes but Thank You very much for offering  this recipe

This stew is delicious. I served it over rice and the combination is excellent. At the end of the time that was suggested to get the meat tender,  I added some sugar and it made the flavors come together.

I'm on a low carb diet and this one really satisfies my hunger. I've made it sever times and love it. I double up on the green chiles and it it wonderful. I make a huge batch and freeze it in serving size containers to take to work. Yum!

After reading all the reviews, I followed most of the advice of a poster who spiced it with more jalape√±os, cumin and Mexican oregano. I served it with mexican rice garnished with Serrano peppers, lime zest, juice of half a lime (per bowl), fresh avocado slices and fresh cilantro. It is a definite keeper. I also used a very dark beer which gave a deeper flavor.

This "Beef, Green Chili and Tomato Stew" recipe was quite good, and the flavor combination of green chile peppers with cumin reminded me of "chili con carne." If I were to make this again, I would quadruple the onions since I love onions in "chili," and fry the cumin with the onions to take the "raw edge" off it. I transferred all the ingredients to my slow cooker after browning, and mine was done after 6 hours on low. Thank you Kimber for sharing your recipe.

Interesting and different.  Simple to make, with tons of flavor.  If I make this again, I'll replace the beer (I used Bass ale - perhaps not the best choice?) with more beef broth.  Frozen leftovers reheated very well (tasted even better!).

I half the recipe since there is only two of us but it still makes enough to have some for leftovers, and it freezes well too.  I use stew meat instead of the chuck roast and add the onions and garlic when I brown the meat in the Dutch oven.  Very good recipe, we have this on our meal rotation for at least once a month.

Holy COW!  I've made a lot of beef stews, but this one has to be one of the best!  It's amazing.  The only variation I did was to thicken it with a bit of corn starch (after it was done).  It would have been great without the thickening... and I didn't add much corn starch...  maybe a quarter cup (dissolved in a bit of water)
I served it over rice.

As others, added Rotel tomatoes.
My secret ingredient is to roast bell peppers on the grill and add them. Then, using smoke chips on the BBQ, cook the Stew on the grill for several hours, allowing the smoke to infuse the Stew. Wow!

I followed the recipe and put this over Chipotle style rice. I thought it was too sauce heavy and lacked flavor. The beef itself was great... Really tender.

They only change I made was I used 2 cans of rotel diced tomatoes with chilies. Used Dutch oven instead of crock pot. 
Much better this time! And it made enough to feed an army!

Wow! Were did all the flavor come from. At first l thought I would add a few things to make it pop. However I always try to follow new recipes  as written  first.  Will differently  make again  and not change a thing.  Very good and fulfilling.

I used venison roast instead of beef. I have made it twice (once for hunting camp) in the last week, serving it over rice. Very good!

I have made it  3 times now.  I do have access to canned chilies so I used fresh ones after
removing most of the ribs, I also added a fresh red pepper. 
It is wonder full!!

I halved this recipe and only simmered for about 2 hours (the meat was tender by then, and we were really hungry), but otherwise, I followed the recipe as written.

We really enjoyed this! It's very flavorful, but I think I was expecting the chilis to give it a little more kick than they did. I would definitely make it again as written and highly suggest it, but I think I'm going to try adding another can of chilis to it next time just to try it out.

This is a great fall and winter recipe!

This sight is my go to. The meat was tender. The flavor was zero. I always double the spices on dishes. I love food and we all have different Pallets. That‚Äôs what makes food good! No flavor for me here. Cook on my people!

I made it as the recipe reads  and it was perfect.  I made it again, following the recipe exactly, but this time I used the  slow cooker for convenience (8hrs on low) and, it was as delish as the first time.

A winner!

Turned out delish! I used a couple cans of stewed diced tomatoes with the green chilies included. One bite and we decided it tasted like a chili Colorado and made burritos with sour cream guacamole and cheese. Will definitely make this again!

I made this per directions and realized it‚Äôs your garden variety chili without beans. A very tasty chili but could have made it much cheaper with ground beef. I still think it has potential but when I make it again, I will double down on the green chilies and cut the cumin by 2/3. I would also add a few bay leaves and might sub the beer with a good red wine.

This was simply wonderful.  My husband and I loved it and it will be a new family favorite.  Since we like a little carbs with our meal, we served this over rice, but  you could also add some small red potatoes that were pre-cooked if you want.

My thanks to all those who offered suggestions so I could tweak it and I hope to make it the best I could. I used two (2) cans of Rotel tomatoes with chilis, and instead of whole tomatoes, I used one (1) can of stewed tomatoes. I added 8-ounces of sliced white mushrooms to the onions (1-white/1-yellow) when they were sauteed,  plus 3 extra cloves of garlic. As for the meat itself, after thawing the chuck roast, I rubbed it down with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and crushed rosemary; wrapped it in plastic wrap, and marinated it several hours. I removed the roast, cut it into chunks, then added a bit more of the spices before marinating again, this time overnight. This, in hopes of giving the meat more taste and flavor. Be sure to use a high-quality beef broth. I also let it cook 3 hours instead of 2-1/2, and the meat was fork-tender, the flavors well-blended. As a single, since I can't eat it all in a day or two, about 6 servings were put in small freezer bags then a larger one, and I'm looking forward to seeing how the leftovers will do. And yes, I did add a can of beer...but a glass of Pinot Noir was a graet accompaniment. I look forward to preparing it again as we approach fall and winter!

Tvery tasty, however liquid too thin.   Perhaps dust meat with flour would thicken the gravy.

This is a simple but flavorful recipe. I added for Yukon gold potatoes and a 1/4 cup of dry parsley to make it more like a stew.   Vert tastey when it was done. I‚Äôll certainly make this one again.

Very tasty and very filling. I substituted diced tomatoes for the Roma‚Äôs. My only question to the cook is ‚Äî- it seems like the calorie count is very high for the actual ingredients that are in this. My husband I and I valued up each item and is more like 300 cal. per  serving.

I made the stew with a couple of modifications and it turned out well. I use diced tomatoes with dice green Chile‚Äôs because that‚Äôs what was in the pantry. Used the crock pot for the simmering. I serve over a baked potatoe. Can‚Äôt wait for the leftovers.

I cooked it as written but in a crockpot.  The smell was wonderful but there was too much liquid.  The meat was tender and delicious.  We put it over white rice.  Even with 2 cans of mild green chili‚Äôs, it had no heat.  I think next time I would leave out the broth, double the spices and up the heat a little.  But some of us had seconds, so it was very good.  Plus we served it with a fresh baguette and butter.  I liked the beer in it as it gave a wonderful aroma and added to the flavor.  Would make this again with changes.

The man in the liquor dept convinced me to use Guiness beer for this recipe.  Don't do it!  It was too bitter for my taste and was difficult to tone it down.  I'm sure the recipe is great without this major drawback.

Wow, I made this stew, we could not get enough, it is sooooo good. Had it with egg noodles and a veggie salad. We here in Ca. Must have a salad with every meal. Bought a more tender piece of meat so to not have to cook it so long, it‚Äôs too nice to stay indoors. The best, Thank You  will make it soon again.

I will definitely make this again. It had a great flavor! I decided to wrap it in tortillas with sour cream and shredded cheese. The flavor of the meat and tomatoes was really suitable for the Mexican style dinner! It was (of course) way too soupy, and I ended up dumping out a lot of the liquid (after everyone‚Äôs burritos were dripping...). Next time I‚Äôll add half the broth and half the beer and see if that helps. I did use Italian style diced tomatoes since that‚Äôs what I had. 

It was NOT good on hamburger buns, which I tried once since the recipe made so much.

This recipe was OK. I honestly did not like the fact that it was too acidic. I added a bit of flour to the meat to thicken. I am not sure if I would make this recipe again. Is not as extraordinary as everyone else mentions.

This was delicious and I will certainly be making it again.  I added some carrots and served with rice.  Next time I  think I will add potatoes, and it will be a one pot dish!

I had an eye of round roast thawed out and really wasn't in the mood for roast when this recipe made its way to me in an email from Allrecipes.  I decided to cut up my roast and give it a try.  I sprayed my pan with PAM and only used 1 TBSP of oil.  I threw the onions, garlic and beef in together to brown, then added the other ingredients.  My favorite green chili stews have potatoes in them, so I also add 3 large red potatoes to the mix, as well as extra Hatch Green chili (we like our green chili stew with a kick).  Wow -- was it good.  My family loved it.  The best part -- it was so easy to throw together.  Thanks for a tasty recipe!

This is one of my favorite stew recipes.  It has so few ingredients and yet it turns out so well.  I don't even like beer or green chilies and I still love it.
1/19/18  I tried this on corn tortilla chips as some reviewers suggested.  It is not nearly as good this way.  I think a lot of the flavor must be in the "juice" so draining it with a slotted spoon to put it on chips was not a great idea.

WOW!  This was incredibly good.  Made as written except I used some green chilis from New Mexico that I had in the freezer.  I had it over long grain rice and my husband had his over noodles.  Wonderful flavor, tender meat.  Was afraid my husband would be upset that I used a roast for stew rather than using it for pot roast, but it was a hit.  Will absolutely make again, and often!

Made this according to the recipe and it was very tasty. I only have Cherry Wheat beer and that gives the stew a nice flavor. My husband and son loves it.

I've made this a couple times now. I added some diced potatoes also which my husband & I both really liked. I used hot hatch green chilis that I'd frozen over the summer. We both like spicy but I'm sure the mild chilis would be just as good.  This is an easy dish which comes together pretty quickly.

This was amazing.  Even my picky eats-like-a-child boyfriend loved it.  I made as directed and served over cheddar jalape√±o sour cream mashed potatoes with a dollop of sour cream on top and a small sprinkle of cheese and fresh sliced jalape√±os.  But honestly, this is great on its own.  The leftovers were delicious too.  Adding this to me repeat pile.  I will say I did take the lid off the pot and let it simmer away for an additional 30 ish min but I really wanted it cooked down and "stewed".  I may have just had it covered too far during the cooking though.  Great recipe!!

I tried this recipe in my slow cooker with only a few changes. I added some smoked paprika because I like the flavor it adds and I used canned diced tomatoes with garlic because I really really like garlic. It was good the day I made it but it was outstanding after a rest overnight in the refrigerator. It was not spicy at all so if you like mild, make it per the recipe. If you want a spicier chili, add the heat of your choice. Next time I think I will add some peppers such as jalapenos to spice it up.

We have never used green chile peppers before, but really like their flavour.

The recipe was not made exactly as written.  The beer was left out due to personal preference.  However, it was very good.  Those who liked more heat added "Chipotle Tabasco".  Definitely a repeat in our house.

This was easy and delicious with so few ingredients.  After reading other reviews, I used flavored canned tomatoes and I used four cloves of garlic (my preference).  The only thing I would say is that it did not make 9 servings as the recipe says.  For my family's portions it made about 6:)  Definitely serve with bread to soak up the delicious juices.

Followed the recipe as written. I found it to be bland and could not taste the chilis at all.
I was however able to save it by adding some additional spice's.
I would not make this again. I guess here in the south we are just use to more flavorful food. I can't think of any other reason why it would have received so many stars.

Really easy to make and tasted wonderful.   Only thing I might do next time would be to add some of my home grown chilli peppers.

Absolutely delicious! The best beef stew I have ever made and tasted! I followed the instructions almost to the tee with one minor adjustment. I added salt and pepper to the beef prior to cooking.

I added a few ingredients to ensure a flavorful stew since all the basics were already in place! I added smoked paprika, hot hungarian paprika, allspice, seasoning salt rather than sea salt, ketchup, italian seasoning rather than oregano, extra chili peppers, & corn starch/water for thickening within the last 45 minutes of cooking. Looks great, smells even better and tastes delicious!

A 4+.  Very good.  Had only about 1/2 the green chilis needed; could have used more.  Had only 1 1/2 hours to simmer.  Served over egg noodles.  Will make again!

This is a perfect recipe, the only modification was, I used fresh green chillies rather than canned, adding most about ten minutes before switching the fire off. to accompany it, rice, and mixed veggies (quickly steamed cabbage and broccoli, and added fried mushrooms with garlic). Excellent dinner fro friends.

Made this as written. I thought it was very good but it had more of a soup consistency than stew. My husband wanted it thicker so I added some "loaded" instant potatoes to thicken it up. We took this to the cabin and everyone raved!!! Will definitely make again.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I trolled for something simple for dinner and in which I had all of the ingredients handy when I stumble on this one. 

It is Hatch's Green Chili roasting season here, so instead of canned green chili I used freshly roasted mild Anaheim green chili from a local farm.  I also used diced tomatoes rather than Roma tomatoes as they were handy.  I also made this without onions as I have difficulty eating them.  

The recipe was rich in flavor and everyone really enjoyed it.  I'm certain I will make it again.

Delicious! Everyone enjoyed the stew; the gravy was sopped up with hunks of bread. Like other reviewers, I added carrots and mushrooms. Maybe I will even add potatoes next time.

I thought for sure things were missing. And Worcestershire sauce? Really? I made it as written EXCEPT to salt and pepper the meat and onions/garlic individually. (Trying to build flavor.) I really love the flavor of this stew and will make it again! It's kind of like the green version of chile Colorado. Excellent!!

This is super easy to make. I will add some fresh jalape√±os next time because we like our food spicier than most people. It was delicious and if making it for company would make exactly according to recipe.

Made this at the weekend. Everyone loved it. The only change I made was to brown the entire roast on both sides before adding everything else, and then letting it simmer. It fell apart naturally, and was easier for me than browning the pieces individually. 
Also, next time I will use less oil. Thanks!

I followed the recipe exactly, and it was so bland - not much flavor at all.  I had to doctor up the finished product quite a bit and even then it was just edible.

This dish is very tastie.  I used red wine instead of beer and carrots.  The short ribs I used are not separated but sliced the long way and thinly.   Thickening wasn't necessary because I floured the meat first and browned.

This was a very good stew but of course I felt compelled to make a couple of changes (try as I might, I just can't seem to follow a recipe exactly):  I substituted ancho chile powder for the cumin (just can't abide the taste of cumin in anything, and the amount called for in this recipe would've made the entire house stink for a week IMHO).  I also added some peeled/cut potatoes and carrots for the last 30 minutes of cook time.  I think I'd prefer this without the potatoes and carrots, just served over rice as recommended, but Better Half wanted the veggies and claims he doesn't like rice, so I agreed to add those items for his benefit.  Overall this tasted great and I will make it again!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent recipe!  The only change I made was using one can of mild green chili's and one can of hot green chili's.   I also agree with another reviewer that you don't need flour.  The sauce comes out perfect as it boils down.  I served it over creamy polenta and grated some Parmesan Reggiano cheese on top.  Yum!

I absolutely loved this stew!   As I was cooking it, I tasted it and ended up adding another 1/2 teaspoon each of cumin and oregano, along with liberal salt and pepper!  Always taste and season as needed during cooking.   I also had a bag of microwave steamer new potatoes.  Cut the potatoes into small pieces, sealed the bag and cooked them according to package directions.  Added these hot potatoes to each bowl of stew when served!  Really, really good!!   Served with good, Italian bread w/butter.  Yum!!!

This is fantastic! I made a few changes. I used the whole green chilies and rough chopped them to get more flavor. I also coated my meat with flour and onion powder when I browned it to add extra flavor to the meat. Can't wait to make it again!

Will make it again and will reduce the amount of oil to two tablespoons since the fat from the chuck roast will render down.   Salt and pepper to taste is an essential.

Followed recipe as instructed.  I guess if you like something that was overly seasoned with oregano then this is for you.  That is all my husband and I could taste: oregano.  What a waste with all the great ingredients to be overpowered by oregano.  Very disappointed.  Should have listened to my instinct and not added it.

If I could give this 10 stars I would! The family loved it! My brother inlaw said "make this EVERY TIME I come over!"

I didn't change or add a thing - just halved the recipe and used whatever beef stew meat (I didn't pay attention to what I was buying - it cost $5.99/lb) the grocery store had. The beer I used, if that matters, was Pacifico. I served it with ice-burg lettuce and tomato salad, and basmati  rice.

Simple. Delicious.

Loved this recipe.  I added small new red potatoes with skins on and baby carrots to the stew after browning meat and sauteing onions and garlic.  The beer really added flavor.  I will definitely make again.

This recipe should be called beef and tomato stew. That's all I could taste and thought it was awful, so I started adding more spices to give it some flavor. I added more salt and pepper, cumin, onion powder, and chili powder. It was a waste of a lot of meat and other ingredients. I won't be making this again.

In place of the canned green chilies, if fresh are not available, I use Bueno brand frozen. More flavor than the canned. A little roux added for the last hour thickens the stew.

This is a flavorful, tasty chili and we loved it.  I made it in two batches - one for my hubby who is allergic to pepper and chilis and one for me who loves spices and chilis, etc.  Both were excellent.  My husbands left over portion was  excellent served over scrambled eggs in the morning for breakfast.  My leftovers were  wrapped in a tortilla with eggs and onions fried together and eaten as a burrito.  Don't miss this recipe - quite good!

Oh, this was really good--better the next day. It was a little too spicy for me, so the second day I cooked three small sweet potatoes (cut into chunks) and added them.   It cooled it down some, but it didn't affect the flavor. I'm makin' this again

My spouse does the grocery shopping (believe me, I'm NOT complaining about that!) and brought home a lb. of beef that was not exactly beef cubes but not exactly ground beef either, but something in between, so I decided to try it in this recipe. Other than changing the measurements to a bit less than half, the only other change was to use a can of Rotel in place of the canned tomatoes and canned chilis. We both thought it was delicious! Served it over brown rice with shredded cheddar and sour cream.

Loved this - did not have any beer on hand and it was still great.  Used Rotel tomatoes with mild green chilies in addition to the chilies in the recipe.  Will definitely make this one again.

I made this recipe with a little over a lb. of stew meat and only one can of green chilis.  I thought it smelled weird at first with the beer; but once this cooked out it tasted wonderful. I added fresh spinach and zuchinni during the last 20-30 minutes of simmering as I was looking to make a vegetable beef/tomato stew.  This was very good and I will definitely make this again.

The only reason I didn't rate this five stars is because I didn't exaclty stick to the script. I didnt use beer although next time I will try it out; I used tomatillos instead of canned tomatoes; and I used fresh chiles. I put all my veggies under the broiler untill charred a little, blended and then cooked as the directions say... actually, now that I think of it I'll just add my own recipe because I did modify this recipe a lot.

Awesome!  I doctored just a bit by adding a diced red pepper and poblano that I had to use or toss.  market had stew beef at a better price than chuck roast so I used that.  It was so good--served it over rice and had veggies on the side.  Tomorrow night I'll be using the leftovers in a pulled beef enchilada!  THANK YOU for sharing this one -- it is a keeper for us!

I made this chili this past weekend.  I thought it was very good.  The only thing I will do differently next time is to use less vegetable oil because I didn't really need 1/4 cup.  I will also roast my own green chilis (Anaheim or Hatch).
