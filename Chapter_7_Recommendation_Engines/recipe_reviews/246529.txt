Well, I had to work with what I had on hand.  I had to use bacon,  which I diced small.  I had to use a shallot instead of a green onion.  The only kale I had was black kale, so I chopped it and massaged it with EVOO.  I also sprinkled the potatoes with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and cayenne as they cooked.  I topped it with cheddar cheese and a fried egg.  This was so good that I can't wait to make it again.  I realize that this isn't even close to the original recipe, but without chef John I wouldn't have been inspired.  If you don't have everything on hand...improvise!

This is so unbelievably tasty, you'll never make hash any other way! I made it with and without kale, and it was a hit either way. Make sure you dice your own potato's, yes it's a hassle, but it makes a world of difference. Also, make sure you rinse of the starch once you've diced them or it won't come out as well.

Nice one Chef John!

Chef John, I always enjoy your recipes.  This was tasty, but I'd like to say that you should tweak the name of this dish because it's a bit deceiving!  I say this because folks like me, who are familiar with the traditional Irish potato dish known as Colcannon (which is potatoes that are boiled and mashed with cabbage )  will read your hash recipe and say "where's the cabbage?!"  M y very Irish brother-in-law brings either Colcannon or Champ (potatoes boiled & mashed with leeks)  every year for Thanksgiving !  We especially adore the  Colcannon, so the title of this recipe intrigued me to check it out.  It is a great brunch side dish as is., but I'm going to try it with cabbage  next time instead of the kale.  I think it will be equally tasty!

I made this tonight and it was a smash hit. Filling and comforting as I made this for supper.
I didn't have enough pancetta so I used uncured bacon to make enough to match the recipe. I also used olive oil instead of butter. 
I will definitely make this again.

I made this with leeks instead of spring onions (as Chef John suggested) and tossed in a few sliced mushrooms as well. Fantastic! The leeks give a much better flavor than just using yellow onions in typical home fries. Finished it off with smoked sea salt on the poached eggs.

Delicious! I used pre-boiled and chilled yukon golds, peels on. I only had a yellow onion, so I subbed that for the green onion, I doubled the quantity of kale and pre-cooked the chopped kale a bit. Otherwise I followed the recipe. Next time, I will push the potato/kale mixture to the sides of the pan and lightly fry the eggs in the middle instead of dirtying another pan with poaching. Great with a glass of Reisling!

I made this twice! Once with white potatoes and again with sweet potatoes using bacon both times. I really liked the sweet potato version and it is healthier too! I used 4 cups of kale the second time, and it could have easily handled more - I will double the kale next time. I omitted the cheese on the healthy version too and I didn't miss it at all. Absolutely delish with eggs on top...and I can't wait to add in corned beef on my third go round.

Delicious. I added jalapeno to it. Made it even better. Have made this over and over again and is even good when you cut some calories by taking out the cheese or using bacon grease only.

this recipe was a lengthy process, there was lots of prep for potatoes, onion,  kale and bacon. cooking times for potatoes and browning bacon were only a fraction of the actual time. it took me approximately two hours. even though salt was listed as one of the ingredients it was not incorporated in cooking, but wasn't needed anyway. so for the reasons listed along with the fat content i would not make this again.

We loved this.  Both hubby and daughter raved as they ate.  I did change a few things, but nothing really significant.  Didn't peel the potatoes (the skin is my favorite part), and I skipped out on the cayenne for my daughter's sake.  No added salt--the bacon and cheese supplied plenty of that.  And I used medium boiled eggs (steamed, actually, in an egg cooker) instead of poached.  This is a side dish for us, one that I need to do when the rest of the meal is in the crockpot, because it involves a significant amount of prep for a side dish.

I loved this recipe, and will use it more when I have fresh potatoes, onions and kale in the garden.  I followed the recipe pretty closely but used yukon gold potatoes instead of russets, and I left out the butter.  I used bacon because that is what I had on hand.  My freshly gathered farm eggs poached and put on top made it extra good.  I served it with a red leaf lettuce, avocado and grapefruit salad.  Perfect!

I have to say I did make this with a few changes, but that's what Chef John is all about right, making the recipes he provides into yor own. I didn't do much differently  just left out the pancetta and kale and I also used leeks instead of green onion.  DELICIOUS. My family devoured it. Thank you Chef John!
