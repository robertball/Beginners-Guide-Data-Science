just great, with a few revisions.  i doubled the onions like others did, added a good amt. of garlic powder, and added 1/2 T of cayenne.  i also cooked the shrimp (2 lbs of med. sized in 1 T butter and a little olive oil) w/the cream cheese and spices thinking the flavors would meld better than cooking the shrimp first w/only the onions (and fresh mushrooms which i also added), knowing that shrimp cooks fast and it still had to go under the broiler.  i also added more white wine and milk--didn't measure--no need to, it's pretty obvious when to quit as the original recipe is just too thick.  served it over linguini and would never put it over rice.  really, it was *divine* and everyone loved it here inc. my 11-yr-old son.  thanx so much for the recipe!

This is exellent and very easy to make. Strongly suggest increasing the green onions by 2 more Tbsp. and increase the cayanne pepper to 1/4 tsp. Gives a perfect amount of "zing." Using the amount of pepper called for is blah..........trust me on this one. Next time I think I will add some mushrooms and maybe some garlic. This would be  good company dish served in puff pastry tart shells.

I'm not normally a seafood lover, but I thought this was wonderful.   Used pre-cooked, de-tailed shrimp, and made the following changes in accordance with reviewer's suggestions:  1. used 5T green onions (about 3 scallions total), 2. added two cloves of crushed garlic, 3. added only about 6 oz cream cheese, 4. increased white wine to 1/2 cup, added BEFORE cheese so it could reduce a little bit.    It turned out wonderfully-- savory and rich, and not too seafoody.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

This was sooo good but incredibly rich. It was exactly the flavors I wanted. My changes were only that I used butter instead of margarine added garlic and used shrimp and scallops. When I sauteed the scallops a lot of moisture came out so I added that to the sauce which worked really well. The best part is my husband hates this kind of stuff so I have a full serving for lunch tomorrow as well.

Kind of like a creamy shrimp scampi. I added mushrooms and stirred in some linguine noodles before broiling. I didn't use the bread crumbs but Parmesan instead. I will make again with maybe a T or two more of milk or a little less cream cheese.

This was good but it is indeed very very rich. The only thing I did differently was to use Neufch√¢tel cream cheese and half Swiss half Provolone. I think this would work with grilled tuna steaks too. Thanks!

This is a wonderful recipe it really gives shrimp a new direction that is so very bold and different from the norm... it went over really well and I even have requests for it... on a scale of 1 - 10 it's a 20

This was a really nice meal. I used precooked shrimp doubled the green onion and added about 1/2 tsp. of minced garlic. I used reduced fat cream cheese which was fine but I could kinda tell so I won't do that next time. The sauce was incredibly thick so I doubled both the milk and chicken broth (in replace of the wine). Even with the extra liquids it was very thick and rich. I served it over rice as many reviewers suggested but after having had the dish I think that pasta would have been MUCH better. Oh- and I doubled the bread crumb mixture over top. It turned out great served with steamed asparagus.

Great Recipe. Sorry I don't usually measure but here were my alterations to the recipe. 1/2 yellow onion. 1 bunch green onions italian blend cheese and Sauvignon Blanc wine over angel hair pasta. This is a really rich dish and it was great for a special dinner for my husband. Enjoy

Very good. Next time I might use dry sherry instead of white wine to give it more taste. Added minced garlic it's a must and used Panko bread crumbs.

Very different and VERY rich. I took the advice of a previous reviewer and added more scallions and cayenne pepper which gave it more zip. Served it over plain white rice with asparagus spears on the side. I think it may also have been good served over toast points or puff pastry. As only two of us had it for dinner we had leftovers and it was just fine reheated in the microwave the next day (maybe even a little better as the flavors melded). Thanks for this elegant albeit sinfully rich shrimp dish. Will definitely make it again in the future.

This was just ok. I made the recipe pretty much exactly as written - I did add quite a bit of chicken stock and milk to thin the sauce a bit but it didn't seem to help. It was SOOOO THICK - way too thick. It would have been good with probably 1/3 of the cream cheese. Won't be making this one again.

EXCELLENT! What a treat this was and easy to make! I used precooked shrimp and it was fine (same quantity). I used 2 or 3 entire green onions and I'm glad I did! I also tossed in a little extra Swiss cheese too and doubled the bread crumb mixture for extra topping. Overall a very pleasing dish! I had lots of compliments on the recipe! Thanks for the post!

This was absolutely delicious. The only thing I would change is less swiss cheese because it overpowers the taste of the sauce.

The flavor was good but EXTREMELY rich. My mother who was visiting loved it but my husband and I were not too fond of it. So if you are not used to eating rich food like us I would not recommend.

I don't like most seafood except tuna so I tend to try taking recipes with shrimp/crab/etc and replacing with tuna. Sometimes works & sometimes doesn't. This actually worked well with tuna. I didn't add anything extra to it and thought the "cream" part of it was very good -- I didn't think it needed more zing because of the richness of it and that was even using fat-free cream cheese & Swiss cheese. (So no I don't "just trust" whoever said it was blah.) I tried this with pasta and didn't think much of that. Since I didn't use shrimp I didn't feel right actually rating it but it seems it's going to "make me.":-)

Changed this recipe a little--used garlic instead of onion and a Monterey cheddar mix instead of Swiss and also added some cayenne pepper. Instead of broiling in the oven I just added some cooked rice to the sauce on the stovetop and ate it like that! Yummy! The flavor is very nice with just a slight kick---Easy and quick too. I will make this again!

My Wife and I made this dish during the past weekend. Although we usually try to follow a recipe exactly as posted the first time I did follow the instructions of other reviewers with regard to additional onions and pepper. I also added approximately 1/2 tsp of crushed garlic to the shrimp while saut√©ing within the butter and onions. This dish was exemplary our entire family enjoyed this dish. My compliments to its original poster. We will be making this again very soon!!!

I didn't care too much for this recipe. The taste was fine but the thick texture of the cream cheese was not for me.

We LOVED this recipe! Per the other reviews I would add more green onion some garlic mushrooms and more pepper. It makes enough sauce that 2lbs or more of shrimp can be used. Awesome as is though we will be making this often!

Good base for a nice shrimp scampi-like dish! I had to add one cup more fluids because it was way too thick otherwise and I wanted the consistency to be more sauce-like in order to eat it with pasta. I added 1/2 cup of chicken broth 1/4 cup wine and 1/4 cup milk. I also reduced the cream cheese to 6 oz. I added bell peppers and peas for more flavor and color and doubled the red pepper (cayenne). I felt the flavor lacked a little in the end and added black pepper and sugar to taste. I skipped the bread crumbs and broiling step because I don't have a broiler. I just mixed linguini into the sauce and topped with parmesan and had an excellent dinner my hubby loved! Now I can make a great white cream sauce for pasta when I don't have any heavy cream at home:D!

Wonderful flavor but it was a bit too thick and I followed the recipe carefully. I will make it again because it is really good but I will thin the sauce.

Decadent rich recipe. The only reason 4 stars is that without my adding extra spices it would not have had enough flavor for me. I added cayenne garlic ground pepper jalapenos and cilantro. I doubled the milk since it was too goopy. I made it tonight and put it over rice. Next time I need to get those calories down - I will try light cream cheese and half the swiss cheese.

Butter in place of margarine panko bread crumbs. We also used 2# of shrimp and upped all but cream cheese to compensate....amazing. Left overs were great on french bread rounds. Very rich and creamy

This had a good flavor I did add more green onions as others had suggested however the sauce was really thick I think next time I will cut back some of the cream cheese and maybe add some half & half or chicken broth to thin it a little. Otherwise it was great!

Pretty good! 

We added cayenne, lots of garlic, and a bit of salt and pepper; we tripled the green onion and doubled the milk wine, too.

The bread crumbs didn't brown for us even after an extra couple of minutes, but we're not experienced with broiling, so maybe we did it incorrectly.

Next time, we'd add mushrooms, asparagus, or both and add still more green onions. We'd continue to thin out the sauce with a bit more wine and milk.
