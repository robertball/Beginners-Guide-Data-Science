This is a great "feel good" drink.  We ended up going out for more ingredients to make more for company the next night.  I garnished with umbrellas and flamingo stirrers.

I'm definitely keeping this one around!  This was very easy to make and it was fast, too.  I'd say it was well worth the wait but there wasn't any wait!  Ha ha.

Really easy to put together and had a nice fruity flavor.   I couldn't find frozen pineapple conentrate anywhere, so, I had to use pineapple juice.  I definitely think it would be better if you could find the frozen concentrate.  Mine had a stronger banana flavor than pineapple and I am sure it was because the pineapple juice I had to use was more diluted than the concentrate would have been.  I think if you can't find the concentrate you would have better luck using fresh pineapple instead of pineapple juice.

This was pretty good.  I liked the combo of sweetness from the banana ( mine was really ripe ), and the slight tartness of the pineapple juice.  I know it said sprinkle cinnamon to taste which was optional.  I did sprinkle some, but I think I'd like it more without the cinnamon.  Also I think it was too liquidy.  So next time I'll omit the cinnamon and add more ice cubes and less liquid.

Whipped this up for the wife. She loved it. I only had pineapple juice not from concentrate so left out the water completely. Added 3-4 more oz of juice. The banana still comes through. We got a good balance of both.
