Even the non-vegans loved it! My sister-in-law has always loved carrot cake, but when she went vegan and gluten-free this year she thought she’d have to give up on it. I was determined to find a good recipe to make it for her, and I’m so glad I stumbled on this one! The only adjustment I made was to substitute coconut milk yogurt for the soy yogurt (because my store didn’t have soy). Since I did that, I didn’t add the coconut flakes because I was concerned that it would be too much coconut. It turned out SO well! The cake was “springy” (not dense or dry) and delicious, and everyone absolutely loved it. I will definitely be making this again.
