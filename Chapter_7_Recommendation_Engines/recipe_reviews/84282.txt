Awesome!  This was wonderful and exactly what I was looking for.  I'm kind of mold-stupid so I had to make it in two halves and then stick 'em together w/ frosting, but my family ate the whole thing.  :)  I used a homemade german chocolate frosting...  Thanks for the great recipie!

My lamb cake mol is very old, bought for my first Easter. I thought I try a new recipe having always used a doctored box cake. I was surprised at the left over batter, enough to fill a bunt pan.

Flavor is good but is not a true pound cake, which is my preferred cake for a lamb mold as the dense cake come out of the mold better.. Bake time of  1.5 hours is too long for my mold. . My mold pan instructions said 50 minutes and that's what I did. Also a ton of batter left over, which I could see before I even started pouring.  No need for toothpicks and left out nuts. Despite fluffier cake got it out of mold with only minor issues.
