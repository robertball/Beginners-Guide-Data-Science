Good recipe.  Tasty and easy to prepare.  Lettuce makes a nice compliment and adds texture.  

I made the following modifications to the recipe:

1.  Used black beans instead of kidney (just a personal preference).

2.  Put taco seasoning, tomato sauce and diced tomatos in the pot with rice in the *beginning* of the cooking process instead of the end (so rice would absorb flavor).

3.  Because I added sauce and diced tomatos in at the beginning, I decreased water by 1 cup (used 2 cups instead of 3).  I still had to cook the rice with the lid off to cook off liquids, so in the future, I will probably try decreasing water even more.

4.  Added a bit of cheese on top and a couple of tortilla chips on the side.

Will make this recipe again.

This is a super easy and tasty burrito stuffer. As previously suggested I cooked the rice with the tomato sauce and taco seasoning. I, also, added about a cup of frozen corn, a small can of chopped black olives and I used a large fresh tomato instead of the can of diced tomatoes.

This was excellent, everyone loved it!  My husband has eaten it for 3 days straight now and is still raving about it.     I used all of the recommendations by the last reviewer, NADROJ451.  I used instant brown rice which meant I was done with dinner in about 15 minutes!  We've never had black beans before, or a meal without meat for that matter so I was pleasantly surprised!  This looks very appealing and is very filling.  This moves to the front of my recipe book!

This was great!  I gave it a 4 because I made some changes.  I sauteed some onion, garlic and 1/2 head of green cabbage in canola oil until soft, added the rice and taco seasoning and sauteed then added the water and beans.  After the rice was cooked, I added some frozen peas and a can of tomatoes with jalapenos (I think an additional can of tomato sauce would have been too much tomato).  It turned out great!  Made a lot of food, my hubby loved it and we used it as burrito filling!  Very healthy, cheap and satisfying-thanks!

My family loves this dish!  I use black beans and sometimes just the rice w/ no beans.  I also omit the lettuce.  I  put everything (spices, tomato sauce) in from the get go as some reviewers suggested.  Great way to get picky eaters to eat brown rice.

This recipe was good! I added ground turkey and used "seasoned black beans" I also put all the ingredients together and used the smaller can of tomato sauce. We really liked it.

There was just too much tomato taste for us.  I will try this again and just add a can of Rotel tomatoes, also substitute black beans for the kidney beans.

Excellent recipe if you cook the rice in the tomatoes and sauce instead of just water.  I decreased the water and used Ro-Tel tomatoes since my family likes things spicy.  And I've used every bean imaginable for this dish, except the kidney bean.  Just our preference.  Very tasty and very easy.

This was really good! I used white basmati rice as I didn't have brown, used pinto beans in lieu of kidney and had to ditch the tomatoes 'cos I didn't have that either. However, just using the tomato sauce with the addition of a can of enchilada sauce, and our favorite spice; cayenne, we all loved this. Good recipe HeatheR!

This stuff is so amazing! I added 2 T of homemade taco seasoning to the rice while it was cooking; I also left out the tomato sauce. I don't think it would have been necessary. I did not cook the lettuce, instead lining a flour tortilla with it before topping with the rice mixture, some cheese, and some fresh cilantro. Better than Chipotle! Update: made this again, this time used the tomato sauce but not the diced tomatoes. Turned out soupier and I didn't like it as much.

YAHOO!  I added a small can (8 oz) of Rold Gold thick & hot tomato sauce (it has garlic, onion & jalapeno added) and one (8 oz) can of Jewel brand sauce.  WOW it was pretty spicy!  Needless to say my children didn't eat it, but I LOVED it.  I also used left over white rice (although I prefer brown) and a can of Rold Gold Mexican Fiesta tomatoes, which I didn't drain due to the "thick" sauce.  Easy & tasty, my kinda recipe.  Thanks HeatheR!

This was wonderful. I just cut the tomato sauce down to 8 oz can, did not add the lettuce or beans. I kept the beans on the side so the kids would eat it, but I added my own beans when I ate it. I added a can of mexican corn. I also had cooked the rice with the tomatoes the entire cooking time. Family loved it. SO HEALTHY!

Another adaptation: Omit the tomatoes, paste, and taco seasoning, and substitute your favorite salsa! I used Nature's Promise medium, added some shredded cheese, and it was delicious!!

I've been trying to find a tasty way to add brown rice to my diet, and this was it!  I substituted a can of black beans for the kidney beans, and topped it with a little diced onion and some cheddar cheese.  The flavor was wonderful, and it couldn't have been easier.  My 10 year old daughter would not touch it, but then, she doesn't like anything anyway.

Delicious!  I did make some changes though.  I did not use lettuce at all.  Since I did not have tomato sauce, I used spaghetti sauce that had chunks of veggies.  Because of that, I eliminated the canned tomatoes.  I also took the advice of other reviewers and cut the water down, using only 1 cup of water.  I also cooked the rice with everything else.  I just dumped everything into a pan and cooked it all together.  It couldn't be easier!  Great recipe!

I followed this recipe almost exactly except used white rice and black beans.  "Four" servings is an underestimate...I would cut the recipe in half next time.  It makes a great stuffing for burritos, just add meat, sour cream and cheese.  As a side dish, its a little strong - the taco seasoning really takes over.  I will use this same idea in the future.  Thanks!

The rice was great.  The recipe could serve an army and I was only making it for myself.  I originally left the lettuce out, but added some to my plate and I loved it.  I used black beans in place of the kidney beans.  I wanted mine a little more spicy so I added some hot sauce, mmmmmmm.

Sigh.  I really, really WANTED to like this.  It was just a big ball of tomato-flavored mush, and leftovers were even worse.  No one in my household wanted more than a few bites.  And it definitely made too much, to boot.  I won't be making this again.  Sorry.

Amazing, easy, and delicious!!  Perfect combination of all ingredients.  I didn't add any salt or pepper, and it tasted great.  Only thing I would change would be to add more lettuce.  I hardly could taste/feel the texture of it;  could use maybe 1/2 cup more to get more crunch.  Very filling rice.  We used it as a side dish, but if you have enough of it, you could enjoy as a full meal.  So good!!!  And you know if I didn't mess it up, it's a very easy dish!  :)

Following the recommendations in some of the reviews I decided to put most of the ingredients in at the beginning and bring to a boil and than add the rice, as opposed to boiling the rice only in water. I put in a can of sauce and a can of diced tomatoes and cut the rice down to one cup. I also added saffron and chili powder in addition to the taco seasoning. I added fresh cilantro along with some diced onions, garlic and green and orange peppers in addition to the beans. This recipe made a larger amount then expected. It was slightly more tomato-y than I would have liked and I think next time I will make it a little more spicy. All in all an incredibly quick and simple recipe.

This was good, but needed a little something more. I wanted to use up some brown rice, so I thought I'd try this one. It looked like it was too saucy, so I only used about 1/2 the tomato sauce called for. I also ended up leaving out the kidney beans when I realized the can I picked up at the store was actually chili beans! After tasting, I ended up adding onion, a finely diced jalapeno and a little red pepper, plus some cumin. Then it was great!

I tried this recipe out on some family members that came over for a grill.  It was a huge hit.  I will be making it on Sunday for my granddaughters baptism party.  We are doing a Mexican grill party with Carne Asada, this rice dish and etc. etc.
Thank you for sharing this with all of us.  Oh, I too added all ingredients to the water with the rice (omitting the shredded lettuce).

Very tasty.  It does make quite a bit of rice though, so either halve the recipe, or invite the neighbours!  My 10-year old son thought that added corn niblets might be a nice added touch and I think I agree.  We'll try that the next time.

Good stuff!  Didn't have packaged taco seasoning so I added garlic powder, cayenne, salt, pepper, oregano, chili powder to season.  Tasted great!  Had a little kick but that was of my own doing.

I made this and used instant brown rice, which cooks a lot faster, adding the tomato sauce, tomatoes and seasoning in the beginning like many others suggested, and also added a cup of frozen corn, and only used half the water. I thought it had plenty of spice and flavor and added a little sour cream and cheese to my serving. Very tasty!

I first tried the recipe as someone suggested, by adding the tomato sauce at the bigining along with the seasonings. Because I used the regular brown rice and not the instant,it didn't get done . It took something like 2 hours to cook it, I think it has something to do with the acid in the tomatoes..I am going to try it again and wait to add the sauce at the end like the original recipes says. (I also found the tomato flavor a little much, so next time about half the  tomato and  sauce )

I made THREE revisions to this recipe and it worked out quite well: 

1) I didn't have taco seasoning mix, so made my own seasoning packet consisting of 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, 1/2 teaspoon cumin, and 1 teaspoon Kosher salt. I added these seasonings to the boiling water to cook with the rice.

2) I added two tablespoons of tomato paste into the water to cook with the rice (and left the tomato sauce and diced tomatoes out of the recipe). 

3) I used black beans instead of kidney beans.

The flavor was EXCELLENT. My rice, however, was undercooked after 45 minutes, so I suppose I will have to simmer at a higher heat next time. As someone else has suggested, the rice can also be used as a delicious filling for burritos. 

I will definitely be making this again, and again! Thank you for sharing.

Very good and very easy. I love one pot meals. I doubled the recipe and also cooked my rice in the tomato sauce / seasoning mixture. I used white rice as I didn't have brown, added half a chopped onion and finished it off with some sour cream and cilantro.

So, so easy and yummy, too! As the description suggests, this recipe was altered easily to what I had on hand but I followed the gist of the recipe. The best mexican rice I've made and, by far, the fastest and easiest! I had leftover brown rice (~1.5 cups) that needed to get used up. I sauteed some chopped onion, red and orange pepper, and a handful of chopped fresh tomatoes until all was tender. I added my rice, and poured in some leftover italian flavored tomato sauce, basil, oregano and garlic I think (b/c that is what I had on hand!) I had a tablespoon of chopped cilantro that I needed to use after making burritos, so I threw that in with some leftover canned corn (I usually do not care for canned corn...), and probably 1/3 can of pinto beans I had in the fridge. I sprinkled taco seasoning to taste as well as salt and pepper and I enjoyed this more than the burrito. Thanks for the great recipe and suggesting that it is practically made to be altered to your tastes or what you have on hand! I was worried about my tomato sauce, but it had all the tex-mexican flavoring that I hoped for. Yummy! Great way to use up leftover ingredients!

The only things I did differently were to use canned corn instead of kidney beans, and I sprinkled the shredded lettuce on top. I served it with Chicken Flautas from this site. A nice meal! Thanks!

I did not care for this recipe.  I followed another reviewer's suggestion to add in the tomato ingredients in the beginning, which seemed to make the rice simultaneously raw and burnt.  I will make this again to see if the original method works.

I usually just make a boxed Mexican rice for the sake of easy prep. This was better than the boxed stuff and just as easy. And I like that it is whole grain. Next time I will use tomatoes with green chilis. I did not stir in the lettuce. This make a huge amount.

It was just okay.  I made it adding the taco seasoning to the water so that the rice would absorb flavor.  I also added corn but halved the tomato sauce in the end.  My husband didn't like it and thought it was too tomatoey.  He said it just tasted like rice w/ canned tomatoes.

I thought this recipe had way too much tomato flavor - would suggest only one can of tomato sauce maybe - and could use much more lettuce.

I followed the suggestions to add all the wet ingredients first, and reduce the water.  And all I had was white rice.  It had a very nice flavor but was gummy.  Next time I will make it as the recipe says!

One of my favorite dishes to make. For me being "Semi-vegetarian" this can go as a whole dinner for me (it has protein carbs, and veggies in it). I like my food a little spicy, so I add a few sprinkles of cayenne pepper to the rice when I add in the taco seasoning mix. yummmmy!

This was really good but kinda salty. I might not use tomato paste next time or at least use the no salt added kind. Overall this was yummy. I might add a can of white corn next time for fun.

This was easy, but didn't taste like any sort of Mexican rice I've ever had. Too soupy and tomatoey, not nearly spicy enough. Won't be making this one again.

Oh, my goodness, where do I start. I love this dip. (For that's what it became when I made it.) I used black beans instead of kidney, my tomatoes did not have chile peppers in them, and I dipped tortilla chips in it. It was fantastic. I will so be making this a lot.

Very fast and easy.  This is a good recipe to have for one of those days you can't decide what to have for dinner.  I had all the ingredients on hand!  I added the lettuce after it was all cooked though.  I like the contrast of cold and hot.

Great side dish!  I followed the advice of another rater and cooked the rice with the tomatoes/sauce/taco seasoning--this really gave the rice a nice flavor; however, I had difficulty getting the rice cooked through (I had to add a bit of water during the cooking process).  Will definitely make this again the next time we have a Mexican main dish.
