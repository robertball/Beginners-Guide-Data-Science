This was excellent and perfect as written. Okay, maybe I added more than a pinch of red pepper flakes but the heat level is easily adjusted to suit your tastes. 5 star recipe all the way! Thanks for sharing!

This recipe surprised my husband who is not a big cauliflower fan. For half, I added some red sauce for him.  An instant hit!  It is now on regular dinner rotation.

This was odd. It was an odd combination of ingredients, and the dish ended up kind of watery. The ricotta didn’t really do much in terms of flavor. Overall, I didn’t love it, but I didn’t dislike it. I probably wouldn’t make it again, but my picky husband ate it, so that’s a plus
