This is a great recipe for leftover roast (beef or lamb). I pretty much followed the directions, except I didn't use any salt or pepper and didn't need it at all. Thanks for this recipe, I wind up with leftover roast that goes bad because it didn't get eaten....that won't be the case anymore.

Fantastic!  I prepared a whole, roasted lamb for Thanksgiving dinner.  I needed something to do with all the leftovers.  I searched allrecipes.com and came across this offering.  My partner and I loved it!  I added mushrooms and sliced carrots.  This will definitely add to my recipe box.

An outstanding result from simple ingredients.  Since we're watching glycemic indices, I used 2 cups cooked barley instead of the potatoes, and it was superb.

Loved this recipe!  Have been looking for one using leftover lamb. Only made 2 slight adjustments.  I sauteed the onions in the same pan as the one I cooked the bacon in (draining nearly all the fat).  Also, after trimming and cubing the lamb, I put it in a saucepan with 2 cups of water and 3 beef boullion cubes and simmered for about 10 minutes to get some flavor, strained the meat and used that to make fresh gravy (tasty!). This one is a keeper!

I assembled this using leftover boiled potaoes & leftover pot roast.  Results were tasty and hubby took a second helping!  Very easy to assemble.  Thanks for the recipe, Amanda.

This dish was quite good, but I think the bacon overpowered the flavor of the lamb.  I was planning to leave the bacon out, but another reviewer said the "bacon made the meal".  Oh Well.. despite that, I used leftover potatoes as other reviewers suggested and the meal was a hit.  Thanks!

This was fantastic!  The lamb I used was a bit tough (haven't had the best luck with the recipe I used to cook it in the first place, but gets unique flavor that I like) but this recipe turned the lamb to butter!  It was amazing.  I followed another reviewers advice and simmered the lamb in beef stock then used that to make the gravy.  I made the mistake of thinking my bacon was too thick and so used half of it but my husband and I both wished it had more bacon.  It was amazing.  The potatoes had great flavor, the lamb was just as tender as could be, the onions provided a nice bit of flavor periodically, and the gravy was great (which is interesting coming from me, considering I generally hate gravy).  We will make this often and enjoy it each time.  Thank you for sharing!

Was looking for a recipe to used up some leftover lamb when I came across this particular recipe. Everyone in the family loved it right down to my picky eater. This was easy to prepare and made just enough to have leftovers for lunch the next day. 
I did the following changes. For the potatoes I used large reds because that was what I happen to have had on hand,sliced them 1/4 inch thick with my mandolin and rather then boil, I steamed them  to make it easier to get the correct consistency without the fear of over cooking. I chopped the bacon before frying then once browned and removed from the pan, I proceeded to saute  the onions in the bacon fat which I believe added to the flavor of the dish until they were soft. I layed according to the recipe direction, then placed the dish in the oven cooking according to the directions and served with a side salad. This recipe is a keeper.

LOVED this recipe.  I used two packs of brown sauce with 3/4 water suggested, with a little brown cheese added, so didnt add any salt of pepper as enough flavour in the brown sauce. I used 6 small potatoes and three carrots. I also used raw lamb chops so cooke din the oven for two hours.  Was sooo good with flatbr√∏d and cranberry jelly.

This was okay -- had to use up the leftover lamb from Greek Easter.  We also had some Greek sausage left, and I so I threw that in too.  Would be good maybe with some peas mixed in with it.  Good comfort food - will probably make again.

3 stars - good use of leftovers - potatoes delicious (like a good roast potato).  Overall dish - bland.  Not sure what herb or spice to liven up.  Perhaps, mint or a bit of mint jelly in the gravy

Very pleasantly surprised by this.  I added some chopped carrot and celery in with the onion.  I didn't peel the potatoes which gave some nice texture, and used about twice the amount of gravy which the recipe called for.  Turned a left over lamb leg into a hearty meal

3 1/2 but my fault, added fresh slised portabella mushrooms, turned gravy too liquid. Other than that was ok. Will try again with precooked mushrooms ( got to have them) maybe top with crumbs

I give this more of 3 1/2 stars.  It was good, however, I used leftover mashed potatoes instead of sliced and it turned into a gloppy mess.  It did taste very good though.  I will make again if I have leftover lamb, but use the sliced potatoes as written.  Easy prep and tasty, works for me!
Thanks for the post Amanda!  p.s. - Don't forget the bacon!  it really makes the dish...I used hickory smoked, and it was delicious.

Cooked this dish last night using left over lamb - WOW - wonderful tastes.  I added two mushrooms.  I will definitely be cooking this one again.

I was pleasantly suprised, first time I have tried making this dish and it came out delicious.  The bacon definately gives this dish a lot of flavour - so dont skimp on the bacon. I followed the recipe mostly, using "BISTO" for homemade gravy and only added sliced carrots,peas & corn - the gravy was a perfect consistency, not too runny or thick. Nice comfort food in winter.

added some mushrooms.  Turned out a little soupy, but I didn't have a rectangular casserol dish with a lid so I had to use a circular one.  Even with the circular dish being bigger than it was suppose to be I would recommend using a rectangular one and just using tin foil to cover.  It was still a fabulous way to reuse my lamb tho.  Really good.

Great use for leftover lamb or beef.  I think it would be even better with some peas and/or carrots added.

We really enjoyed this. I chopped the onion instead of slicing and sliced leftover lamb. I also added a knob of butter to the top layer of potatoes when I took the cover off to help them brown. The only reason this isn't a five is that it was a little salty for our tastes but that was probably the bacon I used. My husband said yes you can make this again with out any prompting always a good sign . Thanks.

The first thing out of my husband's mouth was "tasty."  I'm so glad to have something to do with my leftover lamb because we love roasting lamb.  I think I may make subtle tweaks like to saute the onions first and use leftover potatoes (like a previous reviewer).  I've never tried prepared gravy and found I liked it!  I may have been a bit generous with the ingredients because I used a 2 1/2 quart casserole and still had to leave out some potatoes and cram the lid down.  Thank you!

Made this with leftover roast beef.  It was OK but nothing special.  Will probably not make again as there are other ways to use leftover roast that we like better.

This is quite a tasty dish. I saved the drippings from when I roasted the lamb and used it to make the gravy. Really added flavor. I also used my rice cooker to cook the barley (instead of potatoes) and the whole casserole was so yummy. And filling.

What a delicious dinner!  It‚Äôs a very ‚Äúhome cooked‚Äù kind of family meal with lots of flavour. I used red onion which worked out well.  Rather than pre-cooking the potatoes I sliced them very thin on a mandolin and baked everything together in the oven.  I removed the cover for the last 10-15 minutes to brown the top. Definitely one to make again!

This was pretty darned good. I followed the recipe exactly.  Next time I make this I'll add diced carrots for a more rounded dish, whether that makes it less of a true Lancashire hotpot, I don't know, but for me personally it would be more appealing to have some colour in the dish.  Good way to use of leftover lamb roast.  Thank you to the recipe poster.  By the way, this makes lots.  I cut the servings to 4 and could easily feed 5 or 6.

This was wonderful. The only things I did different was saute' the onion in the bacon grease, and I did no add salt because of the bacon. We had unexpected guests for dinner, and they went for seconds!! Will be making this again. I imagine that my grandfather would be proud.

I added carrots and used up some already roasted (with garlic) fingerling potatoes as well as some left-over lamb gravy instead of the beef.  It was delicious!

I used leftover pot roast instead of the lamb or roast beef.  I also forgot to add the bacon but it was still good.  This is a great way to use up leftovers!
