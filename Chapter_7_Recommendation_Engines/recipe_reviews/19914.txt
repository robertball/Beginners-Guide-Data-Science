Absolutely delicious. Made a few changes since there were mixed reviews about the mayo topping and the lack of seasonings. Well first I used 2 cans of crabmeat, tripled the mustard, crackers and  worchestire, added some garlic powder, minced onion, parsley and chili powder. To the fish I brushed on melted butter mixed with some lemon juice and garlic powder. To the mayo topping I used about 4 TB and added about 2 TB of sherry to smooth it out. Turned out absolutely delicious, although next time to make it more resturant quality I'll skip the mayo mixture on top and instead make a sherry cream sauce from roux, and pour it on just before serving for a more impressive presentation.

I made this recipe last night...I had purchased the crabmeat on a whim and happened to have flounder in the freezer.  I did not have any green bell pepper or mustard powder.  I used one tsp dijon mustard in it's place.  It turned out very well, but a little bland.  Definately needed more salt and I wish I had added some Old Bay, which I did have in my spice cabinet, but forgot about.  My family enjoyed it, but agreed it needed just a little more pizazz.  The mayo and egg yolk mixture on top was very good...reminded me of hollindaise sauce. It looked very nice on the plate, like something you'd get at a quality seafood restarant.  I will definately make this again!

Completely Awesome!  I have to admit I am impressed with myself...and I owe it to the recipe.  It tasted just like we were in a restaurant...even better.  I substituted the saltines with a buttery round cracker and dashed in some old bay.  My three year old even ate it.  Thank you for a great recipe!

HELPFUL TIP:  For a more gourmet look, I decided to put the crabmeat in the middle and wrap the cut strips of flounder around the meat, ...kind of like you would if it were bacon.  I thought it looked a little better :)  I also added salt to the fish.  Then I added several dashes of old bay and garlic to the crab mixture.  If I don't have green pepper, I use red.  It's no biggie, and it brings some color to it.  I only had a few eggs left and needed them to make something else that night, so I didn't make the topping this time but it does taste delish!!!!!!

Two words: DEE LICIOUS!!! I used two huge red snapper fillets because I couldn't find flounder. Seasoned them with a mixture of melted butter,Emeril's Essence,and minced garlic. For the crab filling I used ritz crackers instead of saltines and dijon mustard in place of mustard powder. Seasoned the filling with plenty of Old Bay. I had my doubts about the sauce but I made it any way and I'm glad I did. As other members have said,it looked like an omlette on top but a very tasty omlette. This dish is on the menu at my next dinner party. No need to get all fancy with fresh crab. Canned works just fine.

Wow! I prepared this recipe with fresh flounder and used imitation crab meat in the filler.  Alterations to the crab mixture:  added chopped onions and Old Bay.  This recipe was so easy to use, with ingredients I already had in my cabinet (besides the seafood!).  I increased the stuffing quantity and "wrapped" filets around mounds of crab.  Was unsure about the mayo/egg sauce but it was the perfect touch!  Makes a wonderful presentation and really tastes terrific.

3.5 stars.  It was a very easy recipe, but I think it lacked some flavor.  It's a good base recipe; I would use more worch. sauce, maybe even marinate the fillets in the sauce before.  The crab topping was good (still lacking some spice), but the fish was pretty bland.  I think it would work better if you baked it in a pan that was a bit too small, that way all the juices and sauce/juices don't run all over and instead get absorbed by the fish & topping.

Oh my God!!  This must be what they serve when we go to heaven, because this recipe was out of this world!!  I used canned crab meat which made the preparation go quicker.  Also, for next time, I will use less mayo and butter to top the flounder, then what the recipe calls for.

This dish looked awesome!!! And it was easy enough to serve on a Wednesday night! I followed a few reviewers suggestions to add some Old Bay and extra worchestershire sauce, but I found it a little salty for my taste. I'm sure that when I try the recipe as written it will be perfect!

This was delicious - the whole family loved it!  I used 2 cans of crabmeat and 2T of mayo in the stuffing because I knew they would all love more stuffing.  I also used Panko breadcrumbs instead of the saltine crackers (about 1/3 cup).  I folded the flounder over the stuffing.  My son was upset that there wasn't enough for him to have another serving!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Very good and also adaptable. I didn't have enough crabmeat on hand so I used one can of crab and one can of baby wild shrimp. Also used 1 tsp. of dijon mustard instead of the dry, added 1/2 tsp. Old Bay, and used only half as much butter to cut back on fat, subbed red pepper for green, and omitted the salt and the mayo/egg topping altogether.

Delicous and beautiful. The only reason I didn't give this recipe 5 stars is because I made some changes.I sauteed 1 clove of garlic in butter and lemon juice, brushed that on the cod. I then added mushrooms a little lemon juice and onions to the stuffing. I drizzled the rest of the butter,garlic,lemon mixture over the stuffing.I added a little horseradish and cayenne pepper to the sauce.The result was to die for. I will be making this often. Thanks for the recipe!!

Very, very good!  My flounder fillets seemed awfully thin to me, so I made a "sandwich" out of this using the crab as the filling.  We enjoyed these very much and will have them again.

I made this recipe exactly as written. My family enjoyed it and we had no leftovers. I couldn't give it five stars because everyone had suggestions for additional flavor (Old Bay, green onions, bread crumbs). I will definitely make again and pump up the flavor a bit with Old Bay and possibly a smidge of red pepper.

My husband and I loved this recipe- during dinner, he said "I love you" 7 times... but maybe he was talking to his plate. Adjusted crab mixture as others did, increasing Worchestershire sauce to 1/2 tsp, adding 1 tbsp Old Bay and 1 tsp dried parsley. Spread topping thin, only used 1/2 of it.

We loved this!  But.... I added old bay and without it I really don't think it wouldn't have been as good.  I made it with tilapia (our favorite) and I used a pinch of red pepper powder also.  I used a large can of lump crab (about 2 cups) the one in the seafood cooler, not the one next to the canned tuna.  I then doubled everything else.  Everyone in my house loved it and that is not the norm here.  With old bay it is def. a 5 star recipe.

Made this dish last night using Sole and it was simple & delicious! Here are the adjustments I made:
Doubled the worcest sauce & honey mustard, added 1/2 tblsp. of garlic powder and old bay, and sub red for green bell pepper and added 2 tblsp minced red onion. Also sub bread crumbs for saltine crackers. Half the butter & add 2 tblsp. lemon juice to it. I used only 3 tblsp. mayo for the sauce & added port wine to the sauce mixture....came out great! I folded each filet with the filling and then topped with sauce as directed. Great recipe! Thanks!

My husband didn't like the stuffing & I agreed that it lacked flavor.  Could use the addition of a cheese topping.

Very good.  Just what I was looking for.  I used Old Bay in mine (not too much) and highly recommend everyone doing the same.

Excellent, very tasty, no problem with anything being too this or that.  I did substitue tilapia for the flounder, and diluted the sauce on top just a touch with some evaporated milk (all I had at the time).  It's only 180 calories per serving, too (though most of those are from fat *L*)

Great, easy recipe. I did do a few things differently. I used a can of jumbo lump crab meat which worked out to a little more than a cup and had no cartilage in it. I used red bell pepper and prepared mustard (just squirted some in). I substituted 3 tablespoons panko crumbs for the crackers. My final changes were due to the comments in other posts about blandness. I added about 2 teaspoons of lemon juice to the egg yolk/mayonnaise mixture, then sprinkled the sauce liberally with parsley and bay seasoning after spreading it on the crabmeat. I was also surprised by the amount of liquid floating in the pan after the first cooking time. I used a baster to remove the excess liquid, and I think that helped everything hold together better. It was delicious!

We used the Old Bay seasoning that many others recommended.  However, next time we will use the cajun seasoning because this dish (for our taste) needed another level of flavor.  

Other than that, the recipe was right on the money.  We are 2 and used the 12 oz. pack of frozen flounder fillets and a 6 oz. can of crabmeat - this resulted in the proper ratio of stuffing and fish.  We also left off the mayo topping and made out own butter/lemon juice drizzle.

Update: we had these again tonight with the planned changes.  We used 1.5 tsp. Zatarains's seasoning instead of the Old Bay and the flavor was right on the money.  This time we also substituted shrimp for the crabmeat and it was just as good if not better.  Served with a nice Chardonnay and we are still happy hours later!

This was great. I am the only person in my family that really likes fish, and tilapia is the only fish any one else will eat at all, so that's what I used. I added celery and onion, wanted to use Town House crackers but forgot to pick some up at the store. It was very good. My husband wanted thinner pieces of fish...and the 8 year old didn't like it at all. But the rest of us thought it was pretty good. The stuffing is good enough that I think I may have found a new crab cake recipe. I did add Old Bay per other suggestions. I'm not sure about the topping, it may just be a way to use that yolk; I didn't notice that it added any flavor, it may just be presentation.

I am so glad I went with this recipe!!  I was really nervous about making it, but it was much easier that I expected.  Really took no time at all to prep.  The egg sauce on top was the perfect touch. I added my own special seafood seasoning to the fish, but it would have been amazing even without it.  I made a couple other changes - I used ritz crackers instead of saltines, and did not use paprika. I also used 2 cans of crab.  My husband was freaked out that I was using canned crab, but once we ate it, you absolutely could not tell. I cannot wait to make this again!

I made this tonight and there wasnt one left.  It came out so delicious.  I did as one reviewer suggested and used 20 round buttered crackers instead of the saltines.  I will definately be making this again!  This recipe is a keeper :)

I made this for my husband and myself.  We LOVED it.  He said it was restaurant-quality in taste and appearance.  After reading the reviews I also tripled the mustard (I used dijon), crackers (I used Club), worceshire, and then added garlic powder and Old Bay to the crab mixture.  I also sprinkled both side of the fish with garlic powder and Old Bay before putting the crab mixture on.  It was GREAT!!!

I have made this several times now, and it is quite good.  I have used several different kinds of fish too.  Flounder, basa, tilapia, and cod.  All turned out good!  I have tried it both with and without the mayo topping, and I am in the "with camp" I think it adds a little something special.  I do like to add some Old Bay to the fish before topping it, but I stay true to the recipe other than that.  Thanks for a good week night meal that looks and tastes like a weekend meal!

Love the concept but somewhat bland (fish more so than the stuffing.)  Next time would use old bay, butter, lemon, garlic on the fish and more salt and worcestire on the stuffing.  Additionally, would be sure to spread stuffing THINLY over the fist.  Mayo topping was unnecessary but good for looks. . . would look further for tastier topping.

Mmmmmmm...this was GOOD! As recommended by others, I added Old Bay Seasoning to the crab stuffing. I also made a few other changes. I couldn't find flounder, so I used dory. Also, I added about 2 tablespoons of parmesan. I also reduced the butter to about 1 tablespoon. 

I did add the mayo/egg topping and thought it was good, but maybe unnecessary. I don't think it added enough to the recipe to justify the extra calories.

I'm giving it four stars even though I had to add some old bay to give it a little more flavor and used fresh parsley. I squeezed some lemon on top and served it with homeade rice pilaf.

I've made this once for my husband, and he liked it so much I decided to serve it for a dinner party! Everyone loved it. The only change I made was adding Old Bay to the crab.

Absolutely fantastic recipe. Coming from a very picky fish eater, this is very high praise. The fish was moist-not overdone with the suggested cooking times.  I cheated and used a ready made cajun crab dip from the market, but made the top layer exactly as instructed  DELICIOUS!! Definitely will make again, even when Lent is over!

This recipe deserved a raving review. It was excellent. My husband was full of compiments and my daughter had a second helping, which is unheard of in this house. I did not have saltines, I just used crackers that I had on hand. I did add Old Bay seasoning as was suggested by others. Easy, elegant, delicious. A must try.

To improve the presentation I held  the fillet (tilapia) in the palm of my hand, placed a scoop of filling in the centre then tucked the ends around and placed it tucked side down on parchment paper. As suggested by others I spiced up the crab mixture with extra garlic, Worcester finely chopped onion and celery. Rather than overcook the fish, I turned on the broiler, poured the sauce across and broiled for about 90 seconds until browned. I also reduced the mayo in the sauce by half. Looked lovely and was delicious. Served it with broccoli soup, twice baked potato topped with cheese and green beans.

Great easy recipe! I did add some old bay and left out the peppers but that is just my taste.

Everyone gobbled it up! Will be making it plenty more time Thanks

This recipe is better than what you get in most of the restaurants!  I did use a few of the suggestions:  I added a little onion with the green pepper (2 tsp.), used 5 town crackers in place of the saltines and I seasoned the butter with garlic powder.   Next time I make it I may use a little less fish and stuff a few mushrooms as a side.   My husband and I loved it!  Definitely a keeper.

I saw this recipe online about 10 years ago and have been using it ever since!  The only things I use differently are to add to add Old Bay and -believe it or not- use the imitation shredded "krab". Before any of you crabmeat fanatics cringe at the use of imitation, I say TRY IT FIRST!!!  I LOVE crab, but actually prefer the "krab" for this recipe, as it has a slightly sweeter and lighter texture (not to mention less expensive as a bonus!). I've made it both ways and it is simply scrumptious with several types of fish.  I wrap the fish around a mound of the stuffing, and with the creamy sauce poured over top, it looks like a 5-star presentation!  Family and friends are always impressed and ask me to make it again and again.  Definitely an easy, keeper recipe.  Did I mention leftovers are yummy too?????

I omitted pepper, salt and added Old Bay. I also used fresh parsley, omitted green pepper and used Ritz crackers in place of saltines. It was excellent! My family are not big mayonnaise fans but they did not even know it was in it. They thought it was some type of cheese sauce on top and definately could not taste it in the crabmeat.

Finally, a crab stuffing like you would find in a nice restaurant!!!  Yummy Yummy Yummy!!!  I did not make the sauce because I wanted to taste the stuffing as it was.  I would like to try it though, so perhaps next time.  The only change I made was that I added a dash of Old Bay.  Not sure that it even made that much of a differnce or not.  Thank you for a great "catch"!

We prepared this dinner without any changes to the recipe and served it to our family of 7 young children.  We called dinner "chicken-fish" (imagine fish face saying moo) to get them to try it.    There were very little leftovers.  I can't wait to make this recipe again!

I made this recipe last night and thought that it was excellent and very easy to prepare. I do agree with the comment that Constance made on her review of the dish, so I ommited the mayo topping and subsituted it with the sherry sauce and added Old Bay to the crab. It was superb!!! My husband commented that it was restaurant quality and had two helpings! This is a very impressive entree that will be a hit at any dinner party. Thanks for sharing!!!

Prepared almost exactly as written and it was beautiful, delicious, and EASY! I really wanted to get my camera it was so attractive! (I did add a half dozen or so shrimp that I had in the freezer which I cut in 1/2 inch slices that added some color and I used fresh parsley.)

My husband really enjoyed this dish, I however didn't like the sauce on the top to spongy for me would prefer it with a holliandaise type sauce and would cut out the salt completely too salty for me but over all pretty tasty. I didn't use the green peppers and used ritz crackers instead of saltines and added a bit of chesapeake bay seasoning. Also for the topping I used 4 tbsp mayo and added a little water because it was very thick. Just want to add if you really like crab you might want to double the stuffing I topped three fillets with what the recipe called for.

I must have done something wrong.  My fish was mushy after cooking it.  The crab stuffing was wonderful but the fish just fell apart. I used frozen which had been thawed in the refrig for 2 days.  It looked kinda funny after the first 15 min so I poured off the liquid before putting it back in but I think it was too late.  This is my fav at Red Lobster.  I was really disappointed it did not come out better.  Any suggestions?

OMG!!!! The Crab stuffing is fantastic!!! I made a couple of additions/changes, only because ofwhat I had in my pantry. Instead of dried mustard, I used Dijon mustard, plus I added some Old Bay. I used an ice cream scooper and scooped two scoops on top of each piece of fish. I wasn't going to use the sauce, but glad I did.  This is a recipe I will make over and over.

This is delish!  I only added a little old bay seasoning to the crab stuffing mix and I used ritz crackers bc that is all I had on hand.  Other than that, I stayed true to the recipe.  I used canned crab meat and it was wonderful!  The egg yolk\ mayo sauce made it like a gourmet dish!!  I did have to turn the oven on broil to ' bubble/brown' the sauce on top, but it turned out wonderfully. This will definetly be a staple recipe in my kitchen from now on!  Thanks for this easy and wonderful dish!

YUM!!  I used Cod that we had caught this summer and had in the freezer.  I followed the first part of the recipe but used club crackers instead of saltines and spicy mustard in place of the dry, since that is what I had in the house.  I didn't add the egg or mayo at the end and was very happy with how this came out.

Loved it. I, too, doubled the mustard and Worcestershire. Also added about 1/2 tsp. of Old Bay seasoning, and I believe this made a difference. Not bland at all. I did not put the yolk and mayo sauce on top of the stuffing as it didn't sound good to me. I think it was fine without it.

Fantastic!  Here's the couple of changes I made: 
1) Used red bell pepper vs. green:  red seems sweeter and not as overpowering as green, IMO
2) Replaced the 1/4 tsp salt & white pepper with 1/4 - 1/2 tsp Old Bay seasoning.
3) Used only 2 Tbsp butter.  Used half to "grease" a foil lined baking pan instead of coating the fish.
4) Used kosher salt and fresh ground black pepper on the fish before topping with crab
5) Substituted more Old Bay for the paprika

This is a dish you can definitely add more spice to, if you like it.   Also, I used tilapia because that's what I had, and it worked very well.  I think any mild white fish would be fine.   I'd advise not skipping the yolk/mayo topping, it's richness really takes this from a plain old fish recipe to a company-worthy meal.  Thanks DTHOMRN for a great recipe!

I just made this last night for my girlfriend and I for New Years Eve.  It was delicious.  I only used 2 medium fillets but made the full amount of stuffing.  Quick and easy.  I had a piece left over which I microwaved covered on 50% power for 1:45 to reheat for lunch.  It was still fantastic.  The stuffing might even have had a little more intense flavor warmed up.  I will definitely make it again.

I followed the directions "exactly" and I was so disappointed. It had no flavor and the mayo-egg yolk mixture had a "baked egg" consistency sitting on top of mushy tasting fish. I was extremely disappointed and will not try this one again.

Very nice flavours. I used imitation crab and it turned out wonderfully. Neither my husband nor son like mayonaise so I served it on the side rather than putting it directly on the fish.

Pretty good, but didn't make the sauce because of the reviews. Now I'm wondering if the sauce is actually what takes the dish from okay to great.

Maybe 3 and a half.  Not allot of flavor for my time.  I used imitation crab and no other deviation from the recipe.  It was rich but not especially flavorful.

I made this last night for myself.  I made more filling as I love the crab.  I did make a mistake and mixed the eggwhite with the mayo instead of the yolk.  Would you believe it was delicious!  Great for those watching their cholesterol.  Will definitely make again to see what it is supposed to be like with the yolk.  Just Delicious!!!

Easy, Quick, and Flavorful!  I added a pinch of garlic powder to the crab mixture and substituted red bell pepper for green, it made nice color.  You can use any type of cracker as well.  I didn't have saltine so I used a butter cracker, like ritz.  I will make again.  Looks very nice, would be a good meal with company.

Great Recipe.  I doubled the topping, and used seasoned breadcrumbs instead of saltines.  I would also recommend seasoning the fish before adding the topping.  Don't get so carried away with measurements with the topping.  I also added Old Bay seasoning to the fish and topping.  My family loved it.

Great Recipe! I am not a fan of flounder so I bought medium size shrimp, butterflyed them and used the crab stuffing inside.  It was very delicious.  People raved about it for days.

Very yummy. We do not care for mayonnaise so I substituted it in crab mixture once with tartar sauce and the second time with sour cream and it tasted great both times. I omited the egg and mayo topping completely. My best fish ever.

Great recipe.  Skipped the peppers because I didn't have any, added old bay seasonings, and added a tablespoon of milk to the egg/mayo sauce so it wouldn't turn into an "omelette" like some had complained.  Turned out great!

Excellent dish!!  Make sure you remove as much moisture from the fish as possible
!  I found that frozen vacu-seal fillets stay together better than fresh fish.  This is a definite keeper!!

This tastes just like something I once had at a seafood restaurant!  I did make a few changes though.  I used imitation crab meat, ritz crackers in place of the saltines, left out the green pepper, used fat free Miracle Whip since I was out of mayo, and instead of using the mayo/egg mixture at the end, I just brushed on some egg that was beaten in a small bowl. Served with some flavored rice and a salad, it was a great meal!  Will definetly make again and again!  Thank you for such a wonderful recipe!

This was quite good.  We didn't have any crabmeat, but we did have some shrimp, so we used this instead.  Very tasty.  The children didn't like the stuffing part, but they did enjoy the fish.  We thought it was great, and there were no leftovers!  Thanks!

This was delicious and very quick and easy to make. Perfect for those nights when you do not have alot of time to prepare dinner. Since Flounder is hard to find in the Northwest I used Sole for this dish. Before adding the mayo topping I did drain some of the fish juice out. I also used reduced fat mayo.

I prepared this for my mother's birthday dinner using skinless, boneless chicken breasts instead of flounder.  I used backfin crabmeat from crabs we caught then steamed in Old Bay, beer, salt and vinegar.  Everyone thought it was as good as the crab stuffed chicken we get in our favorite restaurants in Ocean City, Maryland.  Can't wait to try it with freshly caught flounder.  Delicious.

Very, very good. Needed much more of the Worcestshire sauce and the spices. I do not like fish and neither do my kids, but we loved this. I purchased two boxes of flouder fillets and needed a good recipe. This is defintely it. Another small note about this recipe. They do not have real crab in my area, so I purchased imitation crab and it seemed to work very well. I suggest you try this.

We thought this recipe was easy and DELICIOUS.  I told my husband "it was good enough for company."  And he said, "Yeah, GOOD company, like when you invite your boss and his wife over for dinner!"  It was easy to prepare, a complementary blend of ingredients and an impressive presentation.

I’m not a fan of bell peppers so I used jalapeño in its place. I took out the seeds and membrane. Came out delicious. The significant other loved this recipe.

This was really a wonderful light dish in my opinion. I loved it! I used imitation crab (2-8 oz pkgs) so I doubled the ingredients in the crab mixture. I added garlic as I'm a garlic lover. I accidentally mixed the paprika and parsley into the crab mixture instead of sprinkling on top at finish. I used sweet red bell pepper in place of the green bell pepper (sweeter & milder flavor vs green bell to compliment the mild crab and flounder). I didn't have saltines so used ritz crackers instead. I did not double the mayonnaise egg yolk mixture that you spread on top so not as heavy a dish. I added some garlic and paprika to that mixture. Then melted 4 T butter and drizzled on top. When it was time to increase the oven temp to 450 I sprinkled shredded Parmesan cheese over top and baked til melted. LOVED this dish!

I gave this recipe 4stars because it is a good base...but reading the comments and the recipe itself I knew it had to be jazzed up a bit.  I used flounder and laid it in a baking dish. I brushed it with butter per the recipe and added, sea salt, fish seasoning, lemon juice, garlic, and fresh dill.  I wrapped it with plastic and put it into the fridge to marinade for a few hours.   For the crab. It, I used real crab meat (yes...it set you back)

In reading the reviews, the common theme was the need to add some additional spices.  I generally followed the recipe, but added Old Bay and used black pepper instead of white pepper. I also brushed the flounder with a garlic butter mix

Fantastic!  I am not a fish-lover but was asked to do something different for dinner, so got some flounder and crab and made this. My only changes were to add green onion instead of the green pepper.. otherwise, followed this recipe to the T.   Thumbs up from the entire family

This was incredible. Easy to make. Tastes  just like what you would get in a restaurant! I would serve this to company.
I used tilapia and followed the directions. Awesome!
My husband said its 10 stars:)

My husband loved this!  I used crab cakes my "fish lady" had made, instead of making the crab mixture, which saved a lot of time.  We loved the topping, which gave it a restaurant look. I plan to serve this to friends coming over for a small dinner party.

This needed to bake WAY longer than the time stated. After thirty minutes, my fillets were still translucent, and they were fairly thin to start with. Took the advice of others and seasoned the fillets. Used Dijon mustard (didn't have mustard powder) and a whole egg. Did without the sauce on top. Sounds good, but probably will not make again.

DELICIOUS!! I added 1/4 tsp old bay to the crab mixture and used pimento and green onion in place of the green pepper then garnished with green onion and lemon wedges. In my opinion the fresh squeezed lemon juice at the end brings everything together. We loved it! This recipe is definitely one for the recipe box:)

This is really important: DO NOT USE ARROWTOOTH FLOUNDER. If you do, the entire dish will turn into a mushy paste. I recommend using sole. I've also tried the recipe with snapper and it worked well.

The recipe "as is" is pretty tasty. I modified it slightly by using butter crackers instead of saltines. I also pan fried the fish before adding the crab layer on top and then baking the entire dish (but reducing the baking time).

This is a great recipe!  Since I am a Marylander, I of course added a little Chesapeake Bay Crab Seasoning (J&O) and a splash of sherry to the crab mixture.

I have no idea why this recipe is rated so high!  I followed it exactly and we normally love flounder, but this recipe was runny and soggy.  It barely had flavor and was not tasty at all.  Very disappointing!

This recipe deserves 50 stars because we didn't have any leftovers (and that says A LOT in this house).  It was super easy to make and very tasty.  The only change when I make it next time is to cut back on the butter just a bit (personal preference).  Tasty, attractive, and devoured by all.  That's a keeper in my book!!!!!

I personally didn't care for this dish. I thought the crab stuffing over powered the dish and you lost the great taste of the flounder to the crab. I think if I make this recipe again I will use a lot less crab if I use crab at all.

Oh My GOD! This may have been the best thing that I have ever eaten in my ENTIRE life!!!!! My boyfriend and I spent the night together for Valentines day making this delectable dish and boy, am I glad that we did!  I was skeptical about the boxed stuffing, but it really was great! This is VERY filling, so one portion of this ABSOLUTELY feeds 4 without a problem! Thanks so much for such a wonderful recipe!

Absolutely delicious!!!  This dish is beautiful and very tasy.  I've made it twice.  I used flounder the first time and talapia the next. I prefer the tilapia.  I also used real crab the first time and the fake stuff the next.  Both were good. Very good recipe!!!

I was sooo disappointed!! Fishy taste!!! I used 2 cans of crab and a can of baby shrimp rinsed and drained. Followed the advise of using Old Bay on the fish and in the stuffing and followed the recipe after that.   So fishy we could barely finish one piece each!!

This was great!  I made more of the crab stuffing (double) for 6 total filets because we all like crab, but the taste was amazing.  This was one of the best fish dishes I've ever had.

This dish was very easy to make. I added marsala wine to the topping as it needed more flavor. I doubled the worchestershire sauce and added more pepper. The stufifng was great but next time I'll add baby shrimp. Overall, great tasting and easy to make.

Delicious!  We really loved this.  I used olive oil mayo (which is about half the fat/calories as regular), and I did not use as much of it as the recipe called for.  But the dish still turned out OH so rich and tasty.  Yum!

This was very good, and an attractive dish. I used frozen flounder from the grocery store, and canned crab meat, but believe it would be MUCH better with fresh fish and crab meat.

Very nice, an excellent light(ish) dish.  Complement it with rice pilaf and some buttery carrots and your off to the races.  Make sure you use REAL crab and not the fake stuff!

I love seafood, and this comes out amazing.  Be careful not to over-do the mayo.  Ive made it this way, and also with shrimp scallops or clams in the stuffing...Thanks for a good recipe.

I tried this recipe because we happened to catch a flounder in one of our crab pots.  Since the main ingredients were both less than an hour out of the water when I made it, this recipe took more than the stated 10 minutes prep time.  It was definitely worth the time it took to clean and fillet the fish, and cook and pick the crabmeat.  I wish I could share some with the folks who used frozen flounder and canned or artificial crab.  With fresh ingredients, I can't imagine anyone rating this recipe less than five stars.

I started laughing when my husband said, "This is restaurant quality."  I then told him that's what a lot of the reviews had said.  I made a few changes based on some of the other comments.  Instead of green pepper, I used red pepper, and I added an extra cracker and the Old Bay, too.  I'm not sure that the egg yolk/mayo added a whole lot to the flavor, but it did make it look pretty with the paprika and parsley on top.  I backed way off on the amount of parsley, only because my husband doesn't like anything that tastes too "green," but this turned out excellent and everyone liked it.

This dish turned out really great, I did substitute the flounder for Catfish and after reading the other reviews I added a Creole seasoning (closest to OldBay). I made the topping but with only 1 tablespoon of mayo and 4 of milk.

I cut the receipe down for 2, so was a little difficult to divide an egg!  But, it was wonderful.  I followed the recipe exactly, but added a little more melted butter to drizzle at the end.  My husband said it was as good as any fish he has ever had in a restaurant.  I'm sure that fresh fish & crabmeat from the fish market helped greatly.  Will definitely make again with the mayo sauce.

This recipe was delicious! We made it for about 22 people and they absolutely loved it. It does need a touch more of cajun seasoning in the actual stuffing. And maybe some garlic. But it was really resteraunt quality.

I've made this meal twice now and my husband and I absolutely love it. I used cod the first time and salmon the next. I also used low fat mayonnaise, smart beat margarine, and low sodium saltines to make it a little healthier. I have to say I liked it with the cod better than with the salmon, but it's an easy dish to prepare that would impress any guest in your home.

Oh my, it is not often that I rate a 5 star recipe so low.  But this dish was not very good.  I followed the recipe exactly, but we felt the crab was dry and rather salty with the worcestershire, saltines, and salt.  Don't get me wrong, we ate the meal, it is just not something I would make again.  Sorry.

My fussy husband loved this recipe, I used Orange Roughy and Salmon since that is what I had at home,  very good.  Also added the additional worchestershire and Old bay as recommended and used fresh parsley instead of dry.  I'm sharing this one with my sisters!!

really good - something different.  I tried this for the first time for a small dinner party.  Everyone loved it. I even used imitation crab meat as someone else suggested and it tasted fine.

Nope, not for us... the other reviews were right, it tasted like an omlette on top - didn't go with the flounder.

Great recipe!  I substituted red pepper for the green pepper because I had it in my fridge and I also added some fresh jalpeno pepper (I wanted to use it up).  It was great.  My husband, my harshest critic, loved it too.  I will definitely make it again.  Thanks!

Very good recipe.  The egg yolk and mayo toppping was a little strange.  Once it cooked it was like a little omelet on top.  I think something saucier on top would have been better.  Made great leftovers too!!!  I will definitely be making this again, and I'm going to try something different on top.

I modified a bit.  I used haddock instead, about 7 ritz crackers instead of saltines, red bell pepper instead of green and green onions were added to the mayo/egg mixture the last six minutes.  This was fantastic with mashed sweet potatoes and spinach.

This dish would rival any restaurant's.  I made a couple of changes.  I left out the green pepper, added 1 Tbsp of Old Bay to the filling,  and doubled the crab filling since I had a pound of crab on hand and my husband feels you can never have too much crab.  This was just what I was looking for.  Thanks!!!

This dish was very fishy tasting and tasted overcooked.  The flavoring in the crab mixture was very tasty, but the flounder just made it too fishy tasting.  I love crab, but am not the biggest fish fan, so I think I should have just eaten the crab plain, like always.  My husband didn't like this either.

I substituted crushed whole wheat Ritz crackers for the saltines.  I spread the mayo-egg yolk mixture on half the fish.  It looked prettier with the mayo-egg yolk but we liked the fish without the extra topping better (which is fine since the mayo adds extra calories).  I think the crab stuffing needed some more zip and some of the reviewers have said they've added additional seasonings (Old Bay, parmesan, etc.).

This recipe had a lot of flavor, and despite the large number of ingredients, was easy to prepare. We made it with halibut instead of flounder and enjoyed it very much.

VERY good recipe. I first tried it for my husband's birthday and we really enjoyed it. I added small shrimp (steamed) to the crab stuffing, it gave the stuffing more texture if that's your thing. We're defintely having this again!

My husband and I love fish but my kids don't.  When I tried this recipe they scarfed it down and wanted more. My husband is on a reduced fat diet so I used fat free mayonaise and 1/8th cup butter.
I sprinkled on a little fresh parmesian cheese at the end. Yummy recipe! Thanks.

I gave this 3 stars as written, but I followed others'  suggestions and added more seasonings: onion and garlic powder, additional chopped pepper,  and extra Worcestershire sauce. I used Panko break crumbs in place of the saltines, and added the whole egg to the filling, omitting the mayonnaise topping.  The result was delicious!

This is really good and easy too.  I bought some real crab claws and cleaned all the meat myself so that took some effort but the results were great.  Next time I want to fresh flounder along with the real crab meat.

My husband loved it.  He requested a stuffing with more crab and less bread crumbs or bread and this was perfect.  I mixed up the egg yolk/white part in the recipe but it still turned out good. It was served with risotto and asparagus. I will make it again. Delicious.

This was pretty good. Made it with red snapper so the filet was thicker still the cook times were spot on. Change I would make for next time is to season the fish first. It’s kind of bland if you don’t get a bite without the topping.

I used prepared crab cakes and added some stuffing mix, lemon zest and parmesan cheese. - the seasoning in the stuffing mix was perfect.  This was a great recipe to put the mixture on top of the filet - not a fan of rolling fish up . This version cooks quick - with rave reviews from family.

I followed the recipe to a "T" but the flounder came out like mashed potatoes.  The crab topping was very nice.  I purchased the flounder at Safeway just a few hours prior to making and it smelled and felt fine when I worked with it.  I think using a firmer fish like snapper or redfish would produce better results.

Loved this. The only change that I made was adding a tablespoon of lemon juice to the mayonnaise topping.

This is a nice recipe, I reduced the amount of mayo in the topping and it still came out nice. It is a little mild for our taste next time I will add Parmigiano Reggiano to the topping for more flavor and some tobacco to the crab.

Gave this a 4 because I made some additions.  I used Black Drum and fresh NC Blue Crabs (friend catches them), added Old Bay (1/8 tsp.), minced garlic clove, Scallions, and used Butter w/Canola oil and Panko Bread Crumbs instead of crackers.  It turned out great!  I am sure it would be good as the recipe was given.

Perhaps I should call it "Black Drum w/Crab stuffing".

Made this for dinner and my husband loved it.
I added 2 tablespoons bell pepper and 2 tablespoons  chopped onions and made a different sauce. 
Sauce:
3 tablespoons butter 
1 tablespoon flour 
1/2 cup chicken broth.  
Melt butter over medium heat. Stir in flour until smooth. Gradually add broth and bring to a boil. Cook and stir for 2 minutes until thickened and bubbly. Drain liquid from baking dish. Spoon sauce over fillets. Sprinkle with parmesan cheese. Turn oven to broil and melt the cheese.  ***Got the recipe from Red Lobster copycats.***

I found the bell pepper to put a bit too much water in the crab mixture. I did add minced onion and also a package hollandaise (which is egg yolks & lemon) instead of mayo & egg yolks (I had a lb Of fresh crab meat.) it was fantastic!

Definitely adding this to my fish rotation. Used fresh flounder, left out the bell peppers, substituted hot sauce (Cholulu) for Worcestershire, with canned Blue Crab. Wife gave it an A- (she's TOUGH on Seafood) and I'm giving it a solid A. Not sure there's any recipe that would give a Flounder filet 5 stars, but this one is about as close as you can get.  Pay attention to the cooking instructions. Followed them to a "T" and I wish I had taken a picture. They were as beautiful as they tasted.

I really enjoyed making and eating this recipe! The ease of prep and great taste makes this a winner. I used greased muffin tins to shape the fish into a round shape leaving the center open for stuffing. Baked as directed in the tins and served over a green salad. I did post a picture of this presentation.  We all loved our easy and healthy meal. Thank you, we will be having again and will be serving to guests.

The taste is great and the ingredients are solid.  The technique, however, is not.  The initial 15 minutes of baking at 400 degs overcooks and dries out the flounder.  5-8 minutes is plenty, as flounder is an extremely thin fish and bakes very quickly.  Add to that another 5-6 minutes at 450?  And it is PLENTY done.   A better way to ensure a cooked stuffing without drying out the fish is to pre-bake the stuffing for 10 minutes at 400F in a small bowl just prior to loading it onto the fish.  Your food will be safe, and the fish will remain moist.

I've been serving this recipe for my annual holiday party since 2010.  According to my guests "this must be on the menu!"   I follow the recipe  (no  changes) it gets rave reviews and many people ask for the recipe.  In the last few years I've had to substitute fresh flounder (Whole Foods is unable to get fresh flounder) with American Place.  I've never told anyone and still get rave reviews.

Absolutely, without a doubt the best stuffed flounder I have ever ate, much less prepared. Don’t change a thing on this one. And kudos to the chef because the instructions are precise and easy to follow.

Absolutely delicious. I haven't eaten flounder in like 20 years because it's a boring fish. Love the way recipe  dressed it up. Family surprised at how tasty it was. No changes made to recipe, none needed.

Made this last night & the hubster loved it! I made the recipe as written, except (unfortunately) I took another reviewer's suggestion & added cream sherry to the yolk & mayo topping and it was too runny. Next time, & there will def be a next time ;0), I will just stick to the recipe, as I usually do with the "first tries"... only thing I would change is a bit more salt & some Old Bay (that was my reason for  4 stars instead of 5)... Thanks for a great new dish!

Basically followed the recipe with the addition of capers in the final sauce.  It was great, and I will definitely make again.  Having read some of the reviews, I think next time I may try some of the changes.  Many suggestions sound delightful.  Definitely a good flounder dish.  I served it with rice pilaf and steamed fresh broccoli.

This recipe is fantastic! I used it with fresh mahi, upped all crab dressing ingredients, plus added a tsp chopped Vidalia onion. Lightly salt & peppered fish before topping, and otherwise followed the recipe to the letter. Came out perfect and PRETTY! Oh, I also cut the fish into serving sized pieces before topping with crab so each was ready to lift out individually when cooked. So happy to have this recipe, THANK YOU!!!

When I first saw this recipe, to be honest, I thought the "egg" topping looked too "eggy".  But, no.  It is absolutely delicious!  I used a frozen crabcake brand for the stuffing, Panko bread crumbs and Old Bay seasoning on the top on the first round of cooking and when I added the sauce on the top the second round of cooking I topped the sauce with the parsley and Old Bay seasoning.  I loved this recipe....will use regularly.  Pure Yummyness!!!

We loved this recipe. I didn't have a green pepper, so used a red one and I added some finely diced onion to it. I also sprinkled grated Parmesan on top of the sauce and used fresh parsley in the last step. Excellent!

This was very good and I'll make it again. I did follow the advice of some other reviewers and added a little garlic to the crab mixture; otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. It is missing something (maybe fresh parsley rather than dried) to bump up the wow factor. But my family enjoyed it, even my teenage daughter who "doesn't like fish". This recipe is a keeper, though I would probably reserve it for special occasions due to the cost and the rich texture of the dish. It paired very nicely with a crisp citrusy white wine.

Not great. May have been the rif I made. Put 3/4 of stuffing between 2 pieces of flounder-rest on top with egg glaze. Was just not tasty. Really disappointed.

I thought this was good, not great.  I do not feel the extra sauce added much except calories and will omit it next time.  What I really like is how quick and easy this was to make and my young children ate it without a fight.  I will make this again, but I will season it a little more on my and my husbands portions.

I've made this recipe several times in fact we just ate it now. My husband ate faster than I've ever seen him eat. I asked how he liked it and he just said, "good recipe".  Actually high praise from a picky eater like him. I've always made the recipe as written but after the 1st time, when I was trying to use up a can of crabmeat, I just bought a prepared crab cake to use so I didn't have so much crabmeat left.  So I just omit the tablespoon of mayo in the crab mixture and do the rest as written exactly.  Today I was out  of white crackers so used Ritz and didn't notice a difference. This is a wonderful recipe that I will make often.

Omgggg this is scrumptious! I'd give it 10 stars if I could! I followed the recipe except I used tilapia cuz it's what I had on hand. I also added some red onion and the green part of the green onion to the crab mixture. I made the amount of crab mixture in the recipe but only used 3 tilapia filets and it was perfect! I suggest doubling the crab mixture if using amount of fish recipe calls for. I thought the yolk mayo topping sounded weird but reviewers loved it so I'm so happy I made it! Next time I'll double the mayo yolk topping too. Delish!

This turned out absolutely delicious. I omitted the green peppers, but other than that, I followed the recipe. I made coleslaw and potato pancakes as sides. A great meal.

Substituted cooked shrimp for canned crab, and prepared mustard for powdered. Reduced the butter, mayo and bread crumbs ... and it was still great! Very versatile, amend as you wish and it's still a crowd pleaser.

I made this and it was just like being in a five star restaurant.  The presentation is amazing.  I used wild flounder and wild crab.  I followed the recipe exactly and added some things based on other reviews.  I seasoned the fish with cajun seasoning, old spice,  black pepper and tumeric.  For the butter mentioned in the recipe (but not on the ingredients list) I melted a 1/2 a stick of butter and sautéed it for a couple of minutes with four cloves of garlic.  OUTSTANDING!!!!!!!!!

We liked this very much as written without using any of the melted butter. I did use spicy cheese crackers instead of saltines which probably added some umph. I couldn't figure out why you would need to add butter and egg yolk to the mayo mix for the top, so I didn't and none of us missed it!

My husband loved this so much he told me 3 times while he was eating and once after dinner. Thanks for the recipe. Only changes I made were not using the mayo/egg yolk mixture and instead of crab I used cooked seasoned crawfish tails.

My husband liked it a lot. Me, I liked it, I only wish that the fish held up a bit.  I'm not sure what I did wrong, perhaps I didn't pat the fish dry enough. Also I knew that hubby wouldn't like the egg/mayo mixture on top, so I left it off.

Very good but I found it slightly bland so next time I used a béarnaise sauce over the fish while baking and also changed the crackers to ritz for a sharper taste.My family loved it this way,

Awesome crab stuffed flounder recipe! I made this awhile ago and couldn't find the recipe, but kept looking. I'm so glad I did. My husband loves it! I now have it saved to my recipe box. I especially like the sauce on top.

Just made this tonight and my better half said it was the best thing I've ever made. I used Ritz crackers instead of saltines and they added a nice, buttery taste. Will definitely make this again.

I rarely write reviews because I usually make so many modifications to recipes that I don't think it's fair to review the original recipe. But, I followed this recipe to a T and it was delicious!!! OK, I have to admit to one change--I sprinkled my fish with seafood seasoning before brushing them with the melted butter. I only had 4 flounder fillets so I got more of the yummy crab topping on each piece. Definitely a winner!

I didn't have crabmeat so I used shrimp.  I cut 5 big shrimp into small pieces, followed the recipe with the seasoning, used panko instead of crackers, didn't use green pepper, put a whole egg in and mixed with mayo.  I didn't do the egg yoke with mayo topping because I didn't have time--maybe next time.  I have to say that when I was mixing the stuffing, it didn't look too great and I wasn't sure how it was going to turn out.  I used tilapia fillets, brushed with olive oil and put salt & pepper, a little Old Bay Seasoning on the fillets, spooned the stuffing on top, then I cut up some fresh spinach to put on top of the stuffing for some greens.  Covered with foil and baked.  It was delicious!!  My kids said it's a make again!  Thank you so much for this simple and delicious recipe.  A great alternative to the same old way to make fish.

Very good recipe however I made some changes.  I used fresh tilapia fillets, I seasoned them and marinaded them in a lemon pepper marinade. I also added diced red onions and some cajun seasoning to crab mixture. I omitted the final step for the topping.  Very flavorful!

Excellent!  I made just a couple of changes to work with what I had.  I used Tilapia fillets and the crab meat (about 1 1/2 cups) was what I had picked from steamed Maryland blue crabs so of course, they had Old Bay on them. Normally, I wouldn't go to the trouble but I had already picked the crabs and was looking for a recipe to use it. So when I make this again, I'll definitely add some Old Bay. This was absolutely fabulous!

Ok, but not great--the crab really overpowers the flounder, and for a recipe with so much expensive seafood I wasn't particularly impressed with the flavor.  As suggested, I had increased the amount of mustard and worcestershire sauce, plus added some garlic salt, onion powder, parsley and chili powder to the filling.  I also added 2 tsp. of lemon juice and a 1/2 tsp garlic salt to the butter that I spread over the fish and thinned out the mayo sauce with 2 Tbsp. of sherry.

This was delicious! Depending on the size of your flounder... adjust the melted butter. My flouder werenot that big and I got a lot of smoking from my oven from the excess. Still a fabulous recipe!

A great recipe and our main stuffed fish keeper.  Great with Rock-fish as well.  A bit rich, but what a treat whenever I am LUCKY enough to catch the fish!

Great base for the "stuffing", I will use it again & again I'm sure - I think my problem with this one was the Flounder itself.  I prefer a whiter flakier fish.

Awesome recipe. Being that I live on Lake Superior in Michigan's UP, I used a whole whitefish from a local fish  market and canned lump crab meat for the stuffing that filled the body cavity. Followed the recipe exactly other than that and it was epic.

Pretty good. I followed the recipe closely but with some extra seasoning (Old Bay in the crab mixture, salt & pepper on the fish). Had to get the right ratio between crab stuffing and fish, otherwise the crab taste overwhelmed. And it could still have used more seasoning.

We just had this for dinner.  I substituted onion for pepper, artificial crab for real and chopped it up real fine and Ritz insead of Saltines.  My husband raved about it and now I am too.  Thanks for a delicious dinner.

I always order this when we go out, but now I don't have to!  Delicious!  I did alter it a bit...sorry.  I used 1/2 cup crab and 1 can of tiny shrimp.  And I probably used about 20 buttery round crackers.  I rolled the fish around the stuffing and put the sauce on the fish.  Excellent!!!  Thank you so much!

Delicious!  I used salmon instead of flounder as my grocery store only had frozen flounder and I didn't have time to thaw it.  I prepared and cooked it according to the recipe and added a little bit of shredded cheddar cheese to the crab stuffing.  It was delicious.  My husband's favorite fish is salmon and he said it was the best he'd ever had.  He loved it with the crab on top.  We will definitely make this over and over.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I have made the sauce as written and also with a little added Old Bay.  I think the extra spice gives something to the recipe.  I have also used tilapia instead of flounder and it has been very tasty.  Absolutely a recipe that will be made many times in my kitchen.  Thanks DTHOMRN!

This was delicious! My hubby and I caught 2 stripers last night and I wanted to make it all fancy for him (at least for the first filet). I made the recipe exactly as written, only exception is the mustard. I used spicy brown mustard as it was all I had on hand. Still turned out great. Hubby cleaned his plate and asked that we eat the leftovers tomorrow night. (fine with me, easy dinner tomorrow!)

Big hit - I have made this a few times.  I use either townhouse or club crackers instead of saltines.  I also added more veggies (carrots, celery and scallions) to the stuffing.  I have used flounder, haddock and sole and all have worked great.

This was very good. I saw the recipe last night and just had to try it, though I didn't have all the right ingredients. I subbed shrimp for the crabmeat, and tilapia for the flounder. As per some of the other reviews, I used ritz crackers instead of saltines and added some old bay seasoning to the stuffing. I also added an equal amount of finely chopped onion as the green pepper to the stuffing for some more flavor. I seasoned the fish with salt, pepper, and lemon juice before topping it with stuffing. Next time I will use a little old bay on the fish as well. I think the reason many people found this dish a little bland is because the fish is so mild. Extra seasoning on the fish is probably all this dish needs. I will make this next time with crabmeat.

Really good recipe! I followed it almost exactly but added a bunch of old bay to the crab mix. Oh, and I didnt have white pepper so I just used regular black.

I am going to give this one another try. I could NOT find fresh flounder anywhere and had to buy frozen ones. I should have bought tilapia.. I also bought the wrong kind of crab. I'm sure this is so much better done right. I was so disappointed in my mess ups.

Awesome recipe.  I made it for my hubby for valentines day.  I used salmon, because that's what he likes.  I also followed other suggestions to season with Old Bay, and I added a little lemon juice to the fish, crab, and mayo topping.  I used canned crab (can't afford the lump stuff) and it was still wonderful.  The egg yolk mayo topping really made it.  The hubby and both kids loved it.  Will definately make this again.

This is a pretty good recipe.  The first time I made it turned out better than tonight. lol. I did add some Tony Cachere's and a tsp of green onion to the crab mixture to add more flavor and doubled the worch sauce.  I also used the smaller pan idea, and it worked well.

Good, but needs some zip.  Might add some cajun seasoning to the crab next time.  Would be the perfect addition to add some zip.

This was just okay, although I did cut out the mayo egg sauce.  I made it as it and then tasted to crab topping and found it to be incredibly bland so I added old bay, lemon, and then doubled up on the rest of the seasonings. The crab topping was just not strong enough to carry an unmarinated piece of fish.  Maybe this is where the sauce could have added a lot to it, but I just didn't want those calories.

This recipe was fabulous and easy.  I followed others' tips by doubling seasonings of mustard, Worchestershire, salt and pepper.  I also used Italian flavored bread crumbs instead of saltines.

This was very good. I made it last night for dinner and my fiance loved it. The only thing I changed, was I did not make the egg yolk/mayo sauce, and it was still very good. Oh, and I added some Old Bay and lemon juice on top before I baked it. Very good recipe.

I liked it, my wife was so so on it.  I added the Old Bay like everyone recommended, but I guess I didn't add enough.  I will definitely try to make it again with some more spice and possibly a different fish that has more flavor.

This was delicious!  I even made it with imitation crab meat and light mayo because that is all I had on hand and it still turned out wonderful!  Adds a lot of flavor instead of plain ol' fish.

This was the best.  I actually made more of the stuffing and it was great.  I will be making this fish again.  Tastes like something you would get at a restaurant.

I made a couple of changes, left out the mustard and worshestershire sauce and split the meat 1/2 cup crab with 1/2 cup shredded shrimp, but over all it was OK. The stuffing was delish but the flounder got soggy and had almost no flavor left. I will try again.

Diana, my family loved this recipe!  Thank you.  I did make the following changes.  I added Old Bay Seasoning and left out the salt.  I also only used 3 T of mayo for the topping.  I'll use this one again when my family visits.

I didn't have flounder, so I used tilapia. Since the mayonnaise topping got mixed reviews, I used it on two of the fillets and topped the other two with cheese. Both were very nice, but I prefer the cheese. Either way, the fat content probably outweighs any health benefits of the fish! Thanks for the recipe.

Overall, I liked this recipe; however next time I will leave off the egg yolk and mayonaise topping (doesn't add much but calories)and cut the paprika and parsley in half.

Excellent recipe; although I did add Old Bay to the crab mixture.  Also added Old Bay to the mayo mixture and eliminated the paprika.  (There has never been a crab (or fish) born that hasn't called for Old Bay!!).  Thanks for a great recipe.

The crab and flounder combination is wonderful; however, the flounder needs a little more sprucing up. Otherwise good.

The first time I made this, I only had a 6oz can of crab and it turned out perfect.  This time I made the recipe exactly and it was dry and somewhat bland.  I am going back to using only 6 ounces of crab with the rest of the ingredients in the original proportions, it's much better that way!

We tried this as-is.  My husband LOVED it, but i thought the same as some of the others--leave out the mayo topping.  I'd almost prefer a bread crumb topping, if anything at all.  Still pretty good, though, worth 5 stars!

This was an excellent recipe for those of us who don't like fish!  The flounder was mild and the crab was delicious.  I didn't use the mayo topping.  Didn't need it to enjoy this wonderful dish.  My family asked me to make it again!

I made this as directed except I used buttery round crackers instead of Saltines and left off the mayo/egg topping.  I'm not a big fan of fish and my husband really doesn't care for fish although he will eat a little once in a while, but we both liked this.  He said "It's okay for fish," and that's a big complement coming from him, especially since he claims to hate crab.  :)  We don't eat white fish that often, but when we do this will be one of the recipes I rotate.

This is also excellent with shrimp in place of the crab !!! I also used crushed pretzel sticks instead of saltines. We have had this twice this week, once with flounder and once with catfish fillets(economical and still delicious)...

I don't eat fish but everyone else said that it was good.  It didn't make a lot of stuffing though.  After reading the other reviews, I added old bay and omitted the final mayonaise topping.

This was great!  I doubled the seasonings and used Old Bay and cheese to the topping.

Very good.  I used cod instead of flounder and it turned out perfect.

Very tasty and everyone thinks you went to so much trouble.  I skipped the butter & only used 2 tablespoons of mayo.  To compensate, I added more salt & seasonings to the fillet before adding the stuffing.

I bought flounder at the store and wanted to find a recipe.  This was wonderful!  My kids ate it without any fuss, although they both hate fish. The recipe is quick, easy and would be perfect for either a last-minute dinner or a formal evening of entertaining.

Everyone in my family LOVED this.  It would make a great presentation for a company dinner.  Even my seafood haters LOVED this.  And it was so easy.  This is my favorite flounder with crabmeat recipe I've found so far.

I made this last night for the first time, and it was so easy and delicious! I did add a little bit of Old Bay seasoning, but other than that I did it exactly as the recipe said. I really liked the topping too. Sounded weird, but it was really good!

This is AWESOME!  My kids, who NEVER eat any kind of seafood, insisted they wouldn't like it.  I made them try a bite and they ate it all and asked for more.  I omitted the cracker crumbs from the crab mixture, and added garlic powder.  Even the leftovers were delicious the next day!

Very nice dish to make yourself look good. I used halibut and it was great! I found that we ended up with a dinner conversation concerning the mayo/egg topping that consisted of nobody knowing what it was. I expected that the topping would melt and spread. Rather it sets up and tastes much like a boiled egg.

We used a different white fish and it still was a favorite for our family.  A little work to prepare though....
