I was surprised that a recipe so simple could taste so good! A nice change of pace from more traditional spreads.

This was a decent recipe. It was something new for me to shred pears (I used a box grater for the first time too). I don't know pears very well and I used d'Anjou pears if it matters. I microwaved this for a total of 8 minutes before I tried it. I'm not sure what kind of consistency I was supposed to look for - it certainly wasn't jam-like and the "shreds" were still pretty noticeable. Maybe I should have cooked it even longer in order to transform the consistency. Anyhow I tried this on both cake (a pretty plain vanilla ring cake with a little glaze) and on ice cream (French vanilla). It was a pretty tasty accompaniment for both (especially when warmed up and put on the ice cream) but nothing spectacular. But I think I'll still make this again since I have more crystallized ginger I want to use up.

I felt this spread was okay but nothing fantastic. The spread came out very sweet and surprisingly bland and it was completely overpowered by the gingerbread I served this with. Definitely needs a little je-ne-sais-quoi to boost the flavour.
