Love this chicken!! I am a health nut, so I nixed the parmesan (though I'm sure that would be great and if I had some lowfat parmesan I would add it) and I used italian breadcrumbs instead of cornflakes because it was all I had. It was SO tender and the ranch gave it such a kick! I just mixed the breadcrumbs and ranch powder in a bowl, sprayed the chicken with cooking spray, and pressed them in the mixture. Then I baked it as directed. It was easy, healthy and de-lish! Try this one!

This was dinner tonight--last minute choice. I didn't have cornflakes so I subbed in crushed Ritz crackers. I used my own homemade dry ranch dressing mix. I didn't use the whole amount of butter called for. What I did was rolled the chicken in the coating and laid it in the baking dish, then drizzled a little butter over the top. Very simple. The boys loved it. NO leftovers. Great for a family on a tight budget who forgot to meal plan.

One of the best recipes ever. Quick and easy to prepare, and so yummy. The chicken is always moist and full of flavor. I never have leftovers.
I always use less butter called for (by a few tablespoons) and also substitute olive oil too. So I might do 3T olive oil and 3T butter. I also like to drizzle the leftover OO and butter over the chicken before baking. Be sure to check your chicken after about 40 minutes, because mine always cooks in a lot less time than an hour.

I've made this for a few years now, and my husband and I have always loved it.  The breading mix does make more than necessary, so I pour the breading mix over the chicken and pat it in, then save the rest to use again the next time I make this.

This was really good. Here are my alterations:  -used chicken legs and 2 pork chops I had left over (seasoned with black pepper, garlic salt, paprika, and few shakes of seasoned salt).  -changed the cornflakes to panko breadcrumbs seasoned with parmesan cheese, garlic powder, italian seasoning, parsley, and red pepper (really brings out the flavors).  -dipped the meat directly into the ranch and then into seasoned breadcrumbs so I omitted the butter.  -baked at 375F for about 40-45 mins.

So good! My husband and I usually don't like breaded food but this is so good. I marinated the chicken breast in ranch dressing for a couple of hours, then followed the recipe. Probably could have nixed the butter. It made way too much breading though, it could have been halved for our liking.

Instead of using cornflakes I used leftover cheddar and sour cream chips I crushed up.

We all loved it!!! All I had was chicken tenders, they came out great after baking 28 minutes. Wish I would have made more. This recipe will be used again. Thanks, it was so quick and easy.

Excellent and very easy.  This has become a mainstay at my house.  My 3 year old loves it.  I passed this recipe on to my sister-in-law - she also relies on this recipe as one of her mainstays.  I make up the mix and leave it in a seal container to make preparation easy when I don't have much time.

I used to made this year's ago but I'd forgotten about it and how good it is. I did change it up a little...used Panko bread crumbs (didn't have corn flakes on hand). It was really tasty! Thanks -- will keep it in the rotation!

Yummy change for ordinary chicken breast. A word of advice, we made 2 chicken and forgot to adjustment the amounts and it was way too salty.

I have made this recipe many, many times and it is always a hit! My daughter and her fiance just returned from their honeymoon in Italy and while they loved the food there, she asked me to make this for the night they return...nothing beats those great comfort foods!

Loved this recipe, and my husband loved it too. I'm always looking for another chicken recipe. I was short on time, and luckily, I just happened to have all of the ingredients. I think it even made the chicken so much more tender, although I had pounded the chicken out flatter. Thank you for this good recipe! It was a hit!

Sooo good and SOOOO fast to make.  I didn't alter anything, but I did use chicken tenders, about 9 of them.  Just keep chicken breasts or tenders in your freezer along with ranch dressing mix and Parmesan cheese (in freezer) and you will always have a great meal ready to make!  Thanks Launa! :)

I have been looking for a good breading for baked chicken and I believe I have found it.  This breading was delicious!  I used it on bone in chicken pieces and bumped the time up to an hour or longer as needed.  The breading turned out golden brown and crispy but the chicken was still juicy.  Great recipe! Thanks.

Have made this twice- and hubby always loves it.  Good for a quick, warm weeknight meal.  Served with the "Easy Mushroom Rice" from this site.  Quite good.  Will likely continue to make again, especially b/c of its ease.

This was good.  The problem I have with breading and baking, it that that top is OK, but the bottom of the breading on the chicken gets soggy and nasty.  The taste was very flavorful, and the family all liked.

I marinated 2 breasts overnite in Italian dressing.  Used bread crumbs, parm cheese, and ranch dressing (not a whole package).  Came out delish.

Here I was thinking I came up with this great recipe lol.  Anyway, I make mine a little different.  I put ranch in a dish (I don't measure, but I use just enough to coat two chicken breasts-it's just me and my boyfriend).  I use a brush to coat both sides.  I then put both pieces in a second dish that has aluminum foil on the bottom and sides-if you don't use foil, you have quite a mess in the dish to try to clean after cooked.  I just apply breadcrumbs directly to the chicken in the dish that it's to be cooked in.  That way, each piece has lots of breadcrumbs.  Sometimes, I add a little basil and oregano to the breadcrumbs.  Then I bake at 350 degrees for roughly 45 minutes-I cut one piece of chicken to see if it's done.  I do not use cornflakes, parmesan cheese (although, I may try that tonight), ranch mix (I use the real stuff), or butter (sounds like a very unhealthy addition for no reason).  Mine always comes out great, I make this about once a week and my boyfriend is always super excited.  This is definitely worth trying, the chicken always comes out really moist.  The only reason I gave this a 4 was because the recipe calls for 1/2 cup butter, then people wonder why their kids are obese!

Very good but very salty. Worth cooking again but next time I will only use 1/2 the pack of ranch salad dressing mix. I also used chicken cutlets and cooked in my electric skillet with a little olive oil. So yummy with a crunchy coating.

I have four little cowboys to feed every night. When they ask, "What's for dinner?" and I tell them, "Chicken," their eyes light up and they ask, "Ranch Chicken?" They absolutely LOVE this recipe and it's so easy to make! I NEVER have leftovers with this delicious chicken recipe!

Family loved this!  I used bread crumbs that I had on hand instead of the cornflakes and dipped the tenders in an egg/milk wash before dipping into the crumb mixture.  I then used the butter to pour over the chicken before baking for about 40 minutes.  Delish!

This is SO good!  The first time I made it, I had to make it again within a couple of days!  I've also tried it with Italian dressing mix and another time with taco seasoning.  Both were also really good!

Just tried it for the 1st time - loved it!  Next time I will nix the butter and cut back on the parmesan - I think it will be just as tasty.

Great recipe. So good that I passed this along to a friend and she and her kids fell in love. The only thing I changed was the package of ranch...I used fiesta ranch instead of the regular ranch. mmmm good.

This turned out great! We don't eat cornflakes so I crushed up some croutons and only used a half packet of ranch and no butter! Turned out wonderful, I will make this again!

I've never rated a recipe before but felt like I needed to with this one. I was amazed at how juicy and flavorful this made the chicken. My family raved about it, which doesn't happen much with the meals I serve.

I made this for the first time tonight and it was delicious! My husband even said it was really yummy and he is an amazing cook! The only thing I did differently was use 4 chicken breasts instead of 8. There was only a small amount of leftover coating so I spread it over them (before baking) for a little extra crunch and to avoid waste. I will definately be making this again!

Nothing miraculous, but good flavor, none the less.  Enjoyable and not too fattening, which is nice.  Recommended for a not too fussy dinner.

This is an amazing recipe for how simple it is! I made it last night for my boyfriend and his brothers and they adored it. The chicken was so juicy! Next time, I might try double breading it. After all the breading is the best part. I served it with cambell's 3 cheese marcaroni. I will definately make this again!

absolutely loved this! i made some changes though, i didnt have any bread crumbs or cornflakes so i used chexmix cereal (it was the closest thing i had to cornflakes) i also used less butter and instead of baking (b/c of oven issues) i cooked the chicken in a skillet with olive oil. the crust had a great flavor and did not get soggy. i will be making this again!

Per other reviewers, I made a couple of changes, but I wished I had made more.  I used flounder and dipped in egg prior to breading.  I also baked at 375 for 25 mins.  The fish tasted so salty, I could hardly eat it and there was not enough breading to do the 6 pieces of fish I had.  I did not rate it lower because I think it has potential, with some changes.  Also, I do not use salt with my food, so this might have made a difference.  Next time I will add 3/4 cup of Parmesan cheese to the mixture or use 1 cup of Italian Panko bread crumbs to 1/2 packet of Ranch dressing mix.

This was really easy, my family loved it, and baked in the oven instead of fried so I liked it. I wasn't a fan of the ranch flavor on this, but I would eat it again if it were served. My guys liked this quite a bit. I was out of corn flakes so I used panko bread crumbs instead.

Quick and easy dinner for the weeknights after work when all I want to do is just throw something in the oven and sit and chill for a bit while it's cooking!  The fact that hubby and son love it too makes for an easy "what's for dinner?" choice.  I never have any cornflakes, so I use italian breadcrumbs and it always turns out quite tasty!  I also like it because I don't really have to measure anything either!

This was quite tasty.  The coating has a nice crunch from the corn flakes.  My husband and I prefer a buttery cracker crust to the corn flakes, but it's worth a try because everyone's taste is different!

I followed the recipe and it was very tasty! A little too salty with all that ranch mix, so I might cut that in half next time.

I have made this for years.  It is great as is but I like to coat the chicken in plain nonfat yogurt instead of butter then coat with the dry mixture.  A little more healthy & super moist.

I love this dish, so simple to make and it is a hit.  I use bread crumbs instead of corn flakes and use fresh parmesan cheese that I shred.

Pretty good.  Husband really liked it.  I found it needed less time than stated in the recipe.  Mine cooked for 40 minutes and some pieces were overcooked. Liked the flavors.

Really great recipe! I used bread crumbs instead of cornflakes and didnt use the ranch dressing but it was still very tasty. I also sliced the chicken breasts and stuffed them with a pesto sauce....yum yum!!

I didn't have the package of ranch dressing on hand so I smothered the chicken for a couple hours in the fridge with ranch dressing.  This chicken was awesome.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

These were nice and crispy and had great flavor, but I didnt' really taste the ranch seasoning! Still good and the kids loved them. Thank you.

I made this lat night for my husband and me and it was fantastic!!! I followed the recipe as is, except for the cornflakes... I had bread crumbs in the pantry. There is one thing I may alter in the future, and that is the amount of butter. It called for a tad too much butter for me, but it was still great. The chicken was super easy to throw together and get into the oven last minute! While the chicken was cooking I whipped up some pasta and green beans for the sides and viola, dinner was done. We will definitely be saving this recipe and using it over and over again!

This was pretty good, but the ranch flavor was pretty subdued. I only made 3 breasts so I set aside half the breading in the fridge to use at another time. I think the chicken did not need to cook QUITE that long, maybe 35 minutes would have been enough. It was good, but not very moist and juicy.

This recipe is the reason my husband married me.  It's fast, easy, and oh so good!  I usually cut the chicken breasts into strips, or use tenders.

Although this was edible, it wasn't nearly as good as I thought it would be.  It was far too salty, and otherwise tasted like any other baked, breadded chicken.

Two days after making this recipe, my boyfriend requested I make it again. The combination of cornflakes and ranch was so yummy. It created a soft breading underneath with crispy edges ontop. I made three chicken breasts in a glass pie dish. The chicken came out wonderful. I can't wait to make this again! I've already shared it with my other family members. The best part is, all the ingredients were already in the kitchen. Yum!

Delicious!  I made this gluten free by using gluten-free cornflakes bought from Whole Foods.  I also didn't have a Ranch packet on hand, so I just used the spices from the Ranch Dressing II recipe on this site.  It turned out great! Though if I make it without the ranch packet again, I might add a little more salt since the original recipe is allowing for the sodium content of the packet.

The ranch dressing gave it too much of a kick according to my kids. Other than that, I thought the coating came off rather easily. I will cut down on the butter next time, or cut the chicken into smaller pieces.

This recipe is very good.  The ranch flavor is not overpowering.  It has been a hit with everyone I have given the recipe to.  I have had this recipe for years since I am a Taste of Home subscriber.  I definitely recommend it!
