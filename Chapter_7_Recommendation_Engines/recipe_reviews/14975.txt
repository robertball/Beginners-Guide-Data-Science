I was not pleased at all with this recipe as is. I made these for a church bake sale and was very disappointed. The texture was WAY off--they crumbled. I cooked them in tart shells and it was awful. I made a second batch using semi-sweet chocolate and those turned out fabulous! I think that may be the key. The color is more like milk chocolate than fudge, but the texture is way better and so is the taste. And by the way, I live in Tennesse.

Wow, very rich and chocolaty!  People really liked this and it needs the vanilla ice cream to balance the strength of the chocolate.  Too strong for my mom though and almost too strong for me.  Needs to be served warm so it doesn't crumble.

This is our family's favorite chocolate pie.  Mine calls for 8 oz. semi sweet chocolate instead of unsweetened. I sub 1 T dark rum for the rum extract, and the consistency is much better with the extra liquid added.  My recipe also says to refrigerate at least one hour before serving. It is very rich, and best served with whipped topping or vanilla ice cream.
