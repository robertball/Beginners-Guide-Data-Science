This recipe wasn't at all what I expected, but the kids sure have enjoyed it.  The marshmallow on top of shortbread is an odd combination.  Both parts taste good, I just wouldn't normally put them together.  I would never choose this recipe to bring to a potluck, but it will stay in my recipe box since my children like it so much.  They excitedly call it the "marshmallow cake".  :)

I used coconut flour to make these gluten free and I melted some chocolate chips for the top.  They turned out very well, but next time I shall use half the ingredients for the crust to make it a lot thinner.

I followed the instructions for the shortbread and the marshmallow, but turned mine into rocky road bars -- adding melted dark chocolate and chopped walnuts between the shortbread and marshmallow. I also put some on the top for looks.

Everyone loved it, said it wasn't too sweet. I liked how airy the marshmallow came out.

Amazing!  Always wanted to make marshmallows and the crumb shortbread bottom set it off beautifully with a slight almond taste.  A real keeper.  I photographed the many steps, so worth the effort.
