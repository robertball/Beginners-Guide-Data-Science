I used a whole pound of fresh strawberries and equal amounts Truvia sweetener in place of the Splenda. Upping the strawberries to a full pound was the perfect amount for this recipe. It balanced out the tartness of the lemon juice. VERY good. We drank the whole pitcher in one evening.

I did boil the strawberries and a lot more of them – probably a cup or so. But I didn’t add the Splenda at this point as I have never cared for the aftertaste I detect after it’s heated.  I didn’t find it necessary to simmer it for 10 minutes – five was enough.  I strained the boiled strawberries to eliminate the pulp,  then poured the resulting strawberry juice right over ice I put in the pitcher, so it wasn’t necessary to cool it first. I added the Splenda to taste, a little less than called for. This is so pretty, refreshing, and a little more interesting (tho’ not necessarily better) than traditional lemonade. We love it.

Followed the recipes exactly and it was great... perfect lemon flavor.  Some said they thought that the splenda had a funny after taste after cooking.  I did not find this to be true at all.
