Very good simplet salad...I think I should have used small shrimp then what I bought. Didn't think about that until after I mixed with the other ingredients...salad shrimp probably would have been best. Do let the dressing meld with the shrimp mix because when tasting it in the beginning, rather salty. But does go away when chilled for several hours. Made this for my daughter and she reall liked it. But did ask that I make again with more tomatoes too. As well as smaller shrimp.

While I do enjoy more heavily spiced foods on occasion, I generally prefer fresh food, simply prepared, with a minimum of distracting spices,  added flavors  or ingredients.  But this time I was surprised.  It was okay to satisfy my hunger but I found it astoundingly boring.  In this instance the whole definitely was not equal to, let alone greater than,  the sum of its parts.

I really liked this salad.  Very simple.  Several people said to use the smaller salad shrimp for this, but I enjoy the flavor and texture of the larger shrimp, so just cut each shrimp into thirds and it made the pieces similar to the other ingredients and soaked up more dressing that way.  It was a nice filling main dish salad with some garlic bread and nice glas of chardonnay!!

This is a really delicious and quick shrimp salad. I did add some avocado and served it over mixed spring green
lettuces. Since I did not make it ahead of time to chill it for 4 hours, I put the shrimp mixture in the freezer for about 20 minutes before placing it over the lettuces.
Great with dinner rolls and a glass of pinot grigio!

I wasn't able to chill for more than two hours. Maybe that would have helped with flavor. I did use cooked small salad shrimp....because that made sense for this dish.  It was very good and filling! A nice simple dinner salad, I did add mushrooms that needed to be used, but followed recipe otherwise. Thank you for sharing!

Super simple. I used the smaller shrimp just cause they looked better in the grocery store .
