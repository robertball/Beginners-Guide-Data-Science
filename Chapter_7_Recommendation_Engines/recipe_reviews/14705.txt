I've been making this recipe for a while now, but with these changes: I sear the pork chops on the stove before placing them in the baking dish (you can add seasoning while searing if you like; I use a cajun seasoning) and I don't add water to the mix. Simply put the onions on top of the chops and spoon the soup over the top. It ends up making a great gravy so you can serve them with mashed potatoes :) (I know, you shouldn't rate a recipe with changed directions, but I think these changes would alter some people's opinion of the recipe)

The recipe looked too bland for my family so I seasoned the chops first then seared them. But the recipe also needed something more for taste. I added a bag of onion soup mix to the mushroom soup, instead of using water I used sherry and let the flavors meld about 30 minutes then smothered the chops with it before baking.
Served it with egg noodles once and white rice another time.

This recipe was great!  Very easy to make and the chops were incredible juicy and tender!  I pre-seasoned mine with some minced garlic, fresh ground pepper, salt and thyme rubbed in to both sides but the mushroom soup definitely made it very tender.  We will definitely be making these again when we need a quick loin chop recipe.

This is great basic recipe! I did season my meat before browning with Garlic powder, S&P,and Accent(MSG). I added an extra can of mushrooms,too. I have done this in the oven but today it was hot and just kept it on the stovetop, covered, on low for an hour and it came out so tender! Easy meal, no fuss! Serve with mashed potatoes or wide egg noodles and it makes a hearty meal! Also works with lean boneless country ribs!

the tastiest, easiest way to make pork chops and they stay so tender and juicy!  i would put a touch less water in it next time though, the "gravy" turned out a tad thin.

This is a really quick and easy recipe. The added onion makes a big difference! The pork chops come out wonderfully juicy and with a simple side dish and salad, you have a great meal!

This was very good. I would recommend using less water to have more of a gravy consistency.

Yummy comfort food.  Only thing I did different was to season the chops, brown them, then sauteed some fresh mushrooms and put them in the soup mixture.  Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this recipe was really easy and very good.  The chops turned out really tender and the sauce was excellent.  I did make one change though.  I added one third cup milk and one quarter cup of water instead of all water.  The sauce was still a little runny, but it was really tasty!

This recipe was nothing special.  Not much flavor--and I like bland food.  It wasn't terrible, but there really was nothing good about it.  I doubt I will be making these again..  It is quicker and much tastier to bread and fry pork chops instead.

Baked it for 2 hours and the meat was perfectly tender, added white and brown rice along with the wild rice, Also used Lipton Onion Soup Mix in place of the onions, similar to another recipe on this site. Everyone loved it!!!

Simple flavorful and fast for after work supper. I did not cook as long as indicated since I was using fresh pork. I seasoned meat initially with salt/pepper/paprika and then the onions etc. Will do again.

I liked this recipe but followed LEICCA's advice in the reviews and used white cooking wine instead of water, and onion soup mix. I also added some sour cream to thicken up the gravy. It was delicious!

I had high hopes for this recipe, but truthfully, I found it to be very bland and boring even though my husband liked it.  I added, 1 1/2 t. worcestershire, fresh mushrooms, garlic powder, onion powder, and pepper and this recipe still fell short of my expectations.  I think maybe adding onion soup mix would perhaps give it a little more kick if I decided to make it again.

Not bad. I think that the idea of the minced garlic helped.  I also think that it is important to use thick chops to assure that they won't dry out. Thanks fr a very easy quick meal!!

Loved this recipe -- it was very easy to make. I made some changes: I salted and peppered both sides of the pork chops before placing them in the dish. I also chopped up 3 cloves of fresh garlic and added to the onion/soup  mixture. Next time I will reduce cooking time just a bit -- probably 45 minutes total. I served with mashed potatoes and frozen mixed veggies and I poured the sauce over them. Very tasty and my husband loved it!

Not bad...I enjoyed it. I cooked instant rice right in the sauce at the end. It didn't make for a pretty presentation, but it was pretty good for a weeknight.

This is great, I added more spices the second time around and a squirt of lemon juice and it was good too, I also used this recipe for chicken as well.

This turned out great, and I used several of the suggestions included in other reviews, by first seasonings and searing the chops. Then I combined cream of mushroom soup, package of onion soup mix, a little water and a little bit of chopped onion. Baked for the recommended hour. However, the flavor of the onion soup mix was too overpowering (husband agrees). Next time I try this recipe I might use half of the soup mix package.

Really did not like this. Was pretty flavorless and one onion ended up being way to much. Maybe if I would of put another can of cream of mushroom soup. But on the bright side the pork was definitly cooked all the way through

Whenever my picky husband and daughter say that a "baking" recipe tastes better than the usual "frying" version, the true chef deserves 5 stars!!! Thanks again for a great Sunday Dinner option!
