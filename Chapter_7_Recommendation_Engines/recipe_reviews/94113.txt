I make a version of this recipe all the time and in my opinion it's the only way to make an eye roast. This post may help some of you. First I like to preheat the oven at 500 for 20 min. it gets the walls of the oven nice and hot so it holds the heat longer. Then with a pastry brush I paint the whole roast with a browning sauce you can find it in the dry gravy mix section at your local supermarket it comes in a little bottle with an orange lable and lid. Then I season the roast with garlic powder,salt,and fresh ground black pepper. once the roast is seasoned I place it on a roasting rack in a shallow roasting pan FAT SIDE OF ROAST UP! VERY IMPORTANT. AS THE FAT MELTS IT BASTES THE ROAST! Put it in the oven for 7 min. per pound then turn off the oven and leave in for 20 min. per pound. DO NOT OPEN THE DOOR TO PEEK AT THE ROAST. WHEN TIMER GOES OFF REMOVE FROM OVEN AND LET THE ROAST REST FOR 20 MIN. VERY IMPORTANT TO LET REST! SO THE JUICES SETTLE DOWN INTO THE ROAST. SLICE THIN AND ENJOY!! YOUR GONNA LOVE THIS RECIPE I PROMISE YOU. SO EASY!

I had a 4 lb eye of round so I cooked it at 475 for 28 minutes. We had some unexpected delays, so I decided to just leave it in the oven rather than take it out after the 2.5 hours. It was probably in another hour or so.

This was done to PERFECTION for us! We like our roast beef bright pink all the way through, but not rare. This hit it spot on!

For seasonings I rubbed the roast with a combination of salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, paprika and thyme. I probably used about a teaspoon of salt and about 1/2 teaspoon of each of the others.

Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

The most bizarre sounding recipe I'd ever heard and one of the best roasts I've ever had. Whatever thermodynamics were at work here were great. The outside was seared and crusty while the inside was medium rare, tender and juicy. The flavor combination was delicious. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.

You know, I never make comments on anything over the internet..but have to on this recipe.  I was unbelievably surprised!  Following the directions to a tee (except using my own rub for the meat) this eye of round came out perfectly!  My husband is in the food business and was also amazed that an eye of round could come out so tender and juicy and very full of flavor. We like our meat medium and it came out slightly pink. For those who like it more done I would suggest turning on the oven to 350 after the 2 1/2 hours and check the temperature after 20 min.  I'll also try this method for other types of roast as well.

I'm always on the the lookout for easy,...if not to say idiot-proof recipes,...that make my time in the kitchen minimal!This certainly fit the bill!As others,...I followed the recipe,...using a 7 lb. eye of round roast!Following this method,...I had to leave the roast in for 49 minutes at 475 degrees!I was skeptical,...especially when my smoke detectors went off!But,as instructed,...after the time required,...I dutifully turned the oven off for the 2 1/2 hours!What transpired after the time required...was nothing short of awe-inspiring!It had the perfect hue of pink in the middle,...and was mouth-wateringly succulent!This will be my go-to roast beef recipe 'til the end of time!I thank you,Lyn,...for making this guy's life just that much easier!Bless your heart!!!

THE BEST!  i had a 5 lb roast, and we don't like it too red (well, I do, but the kids get kind of grossed out).  To get it a little closer to medium I roasted it at 475 for 39 minutes.  after 90 minutes in the turned-off oven, the meat thermometer read 125, but I figured it had definitely been up to at least 145, as it should be.  I took it out and covered it with tin foil.  While the roast rested, I put fries in the oven and made up a package of Aus Jus mix, adding the small amount of juice and scrapings from the bottom of the roasting pan. The roast was sooo warm and juicy when I cut into it!  I got out my handy, dandy Electric Food Slicer, and sliced up the roast very thin.  Then, I warmed the beef in the aus jus for a few minutes.  Finally, while the meat soaked, I make up some 'Weck rolls.  Slice fresh deli kaisers, place them face down on a cookie sheet, and brush with a small amount of water.  While still damp, grind coarse salt on the tops of the rolls.  Pop them in the oven for a few miutes to toast.  Serve sliced beef on the rolls with aus jus on the side.  Horseradish is a great compliment!

I foresaw a problem with this recipe because I have an old gas oven with very poor insulation, I knew it would be stone cold before the roast was done.  Instead of turning my oven totally off I left it on around 200 F.  I didn't have very many juices in my pan for doing this, but the initial high temperature locked moisture into the meat and it turned out great.

Before this recipe, I had never made a roast. I'll admit, I was really scared to do it the way that the recipe suggested, at such a high temp. I only had a 1.5 lb. roast so I didn't cook it as long (7 mins per lb., so I only had it on high for about 10 mins). It turned out perfectly!! I was so happy, and I ended up making a rump roast yesterday the exact same way. My family loved it. Thanks for the fabulous method...I will never cook a roast any other way!

This recipie is awesome. I was also skeptical when I read it. My family doesnt like their meat rare so I cook it for about 9 minutes per pound. I also make holes in the meat and insert sliced cloves of garlic, then season with salt and pepper. Comes out perfect everytime. Another plus... its so easy!!!

Tender, juicy, absolutely superb!!!   5 stars with no modifications for a cut of beef that is known for it's toughness!  For my family's personal taste, I created a paste of fresh garlic, dried minced onions, fresh cracked black pepper, hickory smoked sea salt (from William and Sonoma), tsp of liquid smoke and olive oil.  Spread the paste on the roast and let it come to room temp (an hour +) before popping it into the oven using the exact directions stated in the recipe!!!!  Came out beautifully.....  Sliced the remainder of the roast extremely thin and used the leftovers the next day in french dip sandwiches.  To prepare the Au Jus: mix 1 tbsp minced garlic, 1/2 tbsp rosemary, 3 bay leaves, a cup of low sodium soy sauce, 1 tsp peppercorns, 6 cups of low sodium beef broth and bring to a low rolling boil for 30 minutes or so.  Strain and serve with the sandwiches - try this recipe I GUARANTEE you will not be disappointed!  Thanks LynB for the submission!!!

I was very sceptical when I first tried this recipe. Wow. A cheap eye of round melts in your mouth. I have been on a high protein diet for some time now and this recipe fits right in. I trim every bit of fat and silver skin off the roast and what's left is pure heaven. If you use a bigger eye of round, lower the time to 5 minutes a pound or it will over cook. LOVE IT !!!!!

I can see that my opinion is clearly in the minority here, but I was disappointed with this recipe.  I've made it twice now, hoping for a miracle - no such luck.  The recipe isn't necessarily at fault - the meat reached the stated temperature and was a beautiful pink color, BUT this cut of meat is TOUGH.  It also had very little taste.  This was the type of meat you start chewing and it just gets bigger and bigger in your mouth!  YUCK!!!  Sorry to disagree with almost everyone else who reviewed this recipe, but we will stick with a chuck roast or a standing rib roast.

Bottom line: 

    Awesome result!

Key takeaways:

    7   minutes/pound at high heat

    20  minutes/pound at lowest oven setting (200 works fine) will do the job (no need to leave for 2 1/2 hours and that may not be safe according to USDA et al.)

    Turning oven off for low-temp portion may yield unpredictable results due to oven heat retention variability.

--------------------------
My story...

Found a "Manager's Special" eye round roast at my local market while shopping for other stuff and picked up an "organic, vegetarian fed" 2.3 pound roast for about 8 bucks.

I've had problems with this cut being tough in the past and decided to Google for a better way to cook it.

Found this recipe and, to my great astonishment, it worked perfectly with some slight modifications.

I had a 2.3 pound "eye roast" and, so, cooked at high temp (475) for 16 minutes.
    
2.3 lbs * 7 minutes/pound high temp = 16 minutes 

My oven is old and probably not well insulated so I decided to put it on "warm" for the low-temp part which is about 180-200 degrees.

Based on another comment here, and my own cooking "spidey sense" I guessed that it would only take about 20 minutes/pound to finish off the cooking.

Started cooking at 7pm, high temp for 16 minutes, went to 200 degrees, took it out at 8:10.

Internal temperature at center of thickest part was about 127 degrees which should yield "rare" on the thickest part.  

On a roast, carry over cooking will  will bring the temp up about 10 degre

As a precursor: we like our meat medium-rare, and we have a family member who is especially picky about that. Also, we used a 2.5lb eye round roast that was even in diameter along the entire length. Our oven is electric and very well insulated, so it holds it's heat well. I combined the advice of some of the reviewers and did the following:

1. Used Gravy Master to cover the roast, then added plenty of garlic salt and ground pepper to make a nice spice crust.

2. Placed the roast in a roasting pan and put it in a 500 degree oven, lowered the temperature to 475 degrees and cooked it for 7 min/lb x 2.5 lb = 18 min.

3. Did NOT open the oven and lowered the temperature to 200 degrees (which our oven may not have even gotten down to). Left the roast in for 20 min/lb x 2.5 lb = 50 minutes.

4. Removed the roast and let it sit for 10 minutes before carving.

Results: the roast was medium to medium-rare but closer to medium, with a nice medium-pink hue throughout the length of the roast. We all prefer it a little darker pink but regardless, the meat was incredibly tender. The tenderness was what you'd expect of medium-rare and it was even more moist than you'd expect for medium-rare by any other cooking method we've tried, so overall it was VERY enjoyable. This is definitely the only way I'll cook roast beef from now on!

Future modifications: I would like to get it closer to medium-rare, so I will lower the time of 20 min/lb at 200 degrees to 12-15 min/lb.

I cater a large number of events each year - from small gatherings to large receptions and have always hesitated when it came to serving beef, as I never knew how it would turn out for sure.  Last month I was hired to do a very upscale wedding for 250.  The groom's only request was that I serve some sort of beef - preferably tenderloin as some part of the meal.  Scared to death at the idea of ruining a $10 a pound piece of beef, I came straight to allrecipes in search of a no-fail way to cook it and found this delightful recipe.  I did a test run on an eye of round roast and was absolutely delighted with the outcome.  When the bride and groom came for their tasting, I served eye of round cooked in this manner as an appetizer three ways - on bruchetta brushed with garlic/olive oil, chilled and wrapped around chilled asparagus that had been dressed with a vinegarette and on tiny homemade yeast rolls spread with a homemade horseradish cream.  The couple raved about all three and approved the dishes for the reception.  They both said it was the best tenderloin they had ever had.  I proceeded to tell them that it was eye of round and that if I served it instead of tenderloin they would save a considerable amount of money (about $7 a pound) that sealed the deal!  Needless to say, the guests raved about the beef "tenderloin" and I was bombarded with requests for how it was cooked.  I confessed that it was not tenderloin and referred them to your website.  THANK YOU!

IF YOU HAVE A GAS OVEN: I only gave 4 stars for not indicating electric or gas which would have prevented a number of FAILS.  You will have to leave your oven on, just at a very low temp for gas stoves. Followed directions with a few adjustments for a 2 lbs eye of round. Rubbed w/EVOO, salt, pepper, Slap Ya Momma seasoning. Let it cook at 475 for 14 min, reduced to 200 degrees for 50 min and turned the oven OFF for 40 min WITHOUT opening the oven at any point. Gave me a perfect medium rare plus! Will definitely do again.

I can't believe how good this turned out. I like ours medium well so here's what I did: I used a 3-1/2 lb. roast rubbed with olive oil, salt/pepper, and sliver of garlic stuffed to the sides of the meat. Preheated the oven to 500F for about 20 mins then turned down the temp. to 475. I roast for 9 mins/lb. then when the time was up I turned down the oven again to 195F for 30 mins. Finally turned the oven off and let it sit in the oven for another 2 hours. Perfection!! The outside was seared and crispy saltyness heaven! The center inside is perfect light pink. We had it for dinner and then lunch  the next day on french roll! Yummy. Can't wait to make it again.

I wasn’t skeptical of the method as much as I was of my 5 year old Frigidaire gas oven being able to retain enough heat to cook the meat. So, acting on my gut instinct, I followed the recipe up to a point. I kept the oven completely off for the first 1.5 hours of the 2.5 hour cooking time, the outside of the oven was very cold to the touch, so I turned the oven back on to 180 degrees F and cooked it at this temperature for the remaining hour. Prior to cooking the 2.87lb roast, I inserted garlic cloves, sprinkled a generous amount of salt and pepper, garlic powder, and placed a few bay leaves on top for fragrance. I also coated the roast lightly with olive oil. This cooking method doesn’t yield much au jus, so I supplemented it with a pre-made au jus which worked perfectly. The only thing I would tweak slightly when making this recipe again, is the end cooking temperature. In the last half hour of cooking I will increase the oven temp to 300 F so the roast will be warmer when served. I would give this recipe two thumbs up with the additional adjustments I mentioned. The roast turned out tender and moist and very tasty with a pink center. It was not tough or dry and my family really loved it! Take a look at my photo of the end result! Thanks.

Love this recipe... I've made this several times (with different seasonings each time) and it always turns out perfect. I wanted to write this review because of some of the reviews from people who have tried this recipe and found that the roast was cold or too well done. Before seasoning the roast, I make sure it is fully defrosted, let it sit at room temp for about an hour, and pat it dry. This prevents the meat from "steaming" in the oven and getting tough. You also want to add the seasonings to the roast no more than 5 minutes before cooking, as any salt will wick the moisture out of the roast.  I use a Le Cruset rectangular casserole dish, which is a heavy, 4-inch deep ceramic dish that holds in the heat. Using a metal baking pan won't do this, and I think that's why some people end up with cold/ underddone roasts. A corningware casserole dish may work as well, but since I got my Le Cruset as a gift, I use it especially for this recipe. My oven is a 20-yr-old GE electric and works great for this recipe, but newer "convection"-type ovens may cook the meat too much during the 21 minutes that the oven is running at 475. Anyway, hope this helps anyone who tries this recipe for the first time. It's definitely a favorite of ours, and it helps to keep the food budget under control because we can buy the eye round when it's on sale and still have a great Sunday dinner.

Well, I couldn't resist buying a 6 lb. eye of round roast as the Giant by me had a big sale on them. Now, I love roasts but never know what cut is what, so I went looking online where I came across this recipe. I read reviews and saw that although they were mixed at times, they were overwhelmingly good so I decided to give it a try. My version - In the bottom of the roaster I put two onions sliced thick, two turnips, carrots, & parsnips. I rubbed the roast with chopped garlic, salt, pepper, rubbed sage, and thyme then placed it on top of the veggies. The roast had a thin layer of fat on one side but still I drizzled a little olive oil over the top and gave it a pat and inserted a thermometer that can be read outside the oven. I cooked it 42 min. - 7 min./lb, as stated in the directions. I shut off the oven a bit nervous that it wouldn't turn out.  About two hours later the thermometer/timer screamed that the meat was at temperature.  I was astonished.  I took the meat out and let it rest on the cutting board as I gave the veggies another 20 minutes at 475 to get good and caramelized.  My husband and I had been salivating the whole time it cooked. As the first cut was taken we saw the beauty of a perfectly cooked roast.  So moist inside!  And for us, there was a good amount of juices in the pan that I made a gravy from (for the mashed potatoes cause goodness knows the meat didn't need it!). We both agreed the recipe was a keeper and are savoring leftovers!  Thanks so much!

Fantastic!  After 35 years of searching I finally found a way to make a perfect roast beef. I sprinkled only a 2.06 pound eye-of-round roast with McCormick's Grill Mates Montreal Steak seasoning and I cut the recipe cooking times exactly in thirds.  I baked it for 14 minutes and let it sit in the oven for 1 hour 40 minutes.  It was perfect!  The roast cooks evenly all the way through so no slices were too well-done and none were too rare. This was so perfect I can't rate it high enough!

My recipe is even simpler and faster... and just as good. Preheat oven to 500 degrees and roast at
500 at 5 minutes per pound. Turn off oven and wait
only 1.5 hours to remove and carve. This yields a medium rare roast. Lots of pan juices and nice crust but very tender inside. My favorite roast.

Using this recipe with a few alterations resulted in the best roast I have ever had in my life! I rubbed the outside of the roast with some kosher salt and browning sauce. I was in a bit of a hurry but given a little more time I probably would have cut some garlic into the meat and used a few more seasonings. I cooked the roast on a broiler pan so that the drippings could be used to make gravy. This is just a personal preference but I like my meat well done. And turning off the oven after 20 minutes to leave a roast sitting in there for 2+ hours doesn't seem safe or conducive to it actually being cooked through. No oven is going to stay warm for 2+ hours after being turned off. Instead I cooked the roast on 475 for 20 minutes. Then turned down the oven to 350 for one hour. Then turned it down to 200 for another hour and a half. Some parts were still a bit pink for my liking. Perhaps next time I will try 250. Instead of being chewy like most roast recipes, the meat was moist and tender. And the gravy was a perfect addition. Definitely a recipe to save and use over and over again. Maker sure you use an eye-of-round roast, I also tried it with a top round and it just wasn't as good.

I followed the advice of other reviewers - rubbed the roast (2.5 lbs) with EVOO, sea salt, and some Italian seasonings. Put it in at 500 degrees, lowered the temp to 475 and cooked it for 20 mins. Then turned the oven down to 200 degrees for 2 hours. Then turned the oven off and let it sit in there for about 25 mins. It was medium - exactly how we hoped it would be. Super delicious and easy! THANK YOU Lyn!

My roast was only 1.71 pounds. I spent at least an hour going through reviews to create my own spin on it. Final result: Seasoned the meat with steak seasoning, garlic powder, onion power, salt, and pepper. Preheated the oven to 500 for 20 minutes. Baked roast on wire rack (pan below to catch drippings) for 12 minutes. Lowered temperature to 170 and baked for an additional 50 minutes. When I took it out of the oven, I let it sit for about 15 minutes. The results were amazing! Great flavor, and the roast came out a perfect medium rare temperature. It was also super tender. Will definitely make this again!

This meat was so tender that I almost thought I was eating Prime Rib. I followed the recipe of 7min per lb and as others suggested, instead of turning the oven completely off, I turned it down to 200 degrees for 2 1/2 hrs. The meat was medium rare and warm to eat. The only way I will ever cook this meat again!

I notice that some people have success with this recipe and others don’t. You can use this method for any roast… eye of round, bottom round, rump, chuck, or tri-tip. This is what I do. It sounds complex, but is actually very easy. First, you can use any marinade, or rub you wish. The results are in the cooking method and nothing else. Since every oven cooks differently, you will need to use a thermometer. I have one that can be set to a final cooking temp. You place the probe into the thickest part of the roast and it has a cord that extends to a battery operated module outside the oven. Just set your temp… e.g. 140 degrees and the alarm will sound when the roast is finished cooking. Heat the oven to 500 degrees. Once the oven is pre-heated, turn down the temperature to 475 degrees. Place the roast into the oven with the probe inserted and the temperature timer set. Cook for 7 minutes per pound then turn off the oven and let the roast set. The temperature will continue to rise. Once the temp is approximately 75 % of your desired finished temperature, open the oven door!!! The internal temperature of the roast will continue to rise. Once the temp starts to drop (110 to 115 degrees) close the oven door. Let the roast sit until the temp is approximate 70% of your desired finished temperature… about 100 degrees. Then turn the oven back on at 350 degrees, until the temp rises and your alarm goes off. Remove the roast from the oven and let set for 20 minutes, tented with aluminum f

When I told my husband that our 3.5 lb. Eye of Round roast would only bake for 24 minutes...you should have seen the "are you crazy?" look he gave me...lol. We began by making slits in the roast and stuffed it with sliced garlic cloves, about 4 cloves total, salted all over and left fat side up. Another reviewer suggested the oven be pre-heated well, about 20 minutes before placing the roast in it. Once in, after 24 minutes @ 500, I turned it off (without peeking of course!) and let it sit for about 2 hours & 15 mins. Now, we were both very curious of the outcome and decided we would check it with a meat thermometer before serving...just to be safe. The thing is, it's not an accurate reading because the meat is cooled down after sitting in the oven for that long. That hadn't occurred to me. So, we cut into it and found the most juicy beautifully cooked medium rare Eye of Round we had ever seen! Man,oh man it was so good we were salivating while slicing it. The juices it creates in the pan was excellent over the meat on our plates. This method will be THE method for this cut of meat forever in our house. No more dry Eye ;) Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

2 1/2 hours is too long, you risk bacterial growth due to cooling.  1 1/2 hours will be plenty, really, especially after cooking it 7 minutes per pound - I usually find 5 minutes per pound enough.  I don't use salt, because I don't want to leech the juices.  I use cracked peppercorns, and coat the whole thing.  I also throw in some baked potatoes, then reheat them briefly in the microwave, while slicing the roast.  This is a very popular dinner with company.

This came out perfect based on the other reviews.  Preheat the oven at 500 for 20 min.so it gets the oven nice and hot. I rubbed the roast with a combination of salt, pepper, garlic powder, paprika and thyme. Place it on a roasting rack in a shallow roasting pan FAT SIDE OF ROAST UP! VERY IMPORTANT. AS THE FAT MELTS IT BASTES THE ROAST! Cook for 7 min. per pound then turn off the oven and leave in for 20 min. per pound. DO NOT OPEN THE DOOR TO PEEK AT THE ROAST. When timer goes off remove from oven AND LET THE ROAST REST FOR 20 MIN. Perfect crispy crust and tender juicy meat. It made a delicious sauce as well.

Total failure tonight with my 2-year-old, proven GAS oven.  I suspect that this is the reason the reviews are either delight (5 stars) or despair (1 star) with no middle ground.  Electric = success; Gas = failure.

NOTE: I've been using this recipe often since I first saw it; this is a bigger roast than usual so: Just did a 6 lb roast and it's less rare than desired - same stove, weight before cooking  was accurate - so be aware that above maybe 4.x lbs. you might want to reduce the cooking time somewhat.  Spice suggestion: Montreal Steak Seasoning (whohoo!).  The recipe still gets five stars from me!  Go for it!

***** Recipe Redux - I decided to try for even more rare.  On my 3rd (and 4th) ventures into this fine recipe, I dropped the cooking time to 6.5 mins/lb. and it worked out just great.  It was done just the other side of "Moo" and a splended time was had by all (except the cow). BTW
I have used under-$3.00/lb eye round from my local wholesale club with fine results.  *** end of update *** original review to follow:
I read the predominantly excellent reviews and expected good things.  I was NOT disappointed.  My first try was a 3.2 lb. seamed eye round roast from my local Kings supermarket.  Since most of us here like it Really Rare (barely cooked in the middle), I timed 22 mins at 475 degrees and let it stand in the oven for 90 mins.  Used Montreal Steak Seasoning and a bit of this and that and WOW.  Totally impressive and might just be the best roast beef I've every had.  Certainly the best I've ever made.  BTW my stove is a 5-yr. old gas-powered middle-of-the-line Frigidaire Gallery (same as Tappan, among others) that I believe is still in production.  Thank you Thank you!

I guess my oven doesn't hold temp. At the end of cooking the roast was raw. Interal temp was barely 80 degrees.

Don't be lured by the description.  This recipe takes a very tough piece of meat and turns it into a perfectly cooked, tough piece of meat.  Sure it's pink and juicy inside and smells great, but you still wont be able to chew it.

Buy a slicer to slice this wafer thin, or invest your time in another cut.

As others mentioned, I was skeptical and a bit nervous about trying this recipe.  My eye of round roast was only 1.92 pounds and I thought it might be too small to come out nice and rare.  I bit the bullet though, and roasted it for 13 minutes at 475 then turned off the oven and left it for one hour.  The roast came out perfect!  As an extra added bonus, I put a small pan of chunked potatoes tossed with olive oil and a bit of onion soup mix in at the same time as the roast and they were done as well.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

I had a smaller roast on hand (1.5 lbs) than the recipe called for but I used the same cooking time- 7 minutes per pound. It turned out perfect. My family loved it- it was tender and favorful. I have already added it to my family cookbook. The only thing I did differently was to season it witha prepared steak season (Chicago style).

This was so excellent! My hubby n I were spoiled by working at a restaurant with great roast beef, and now we can make it at home!  I used an herb rub, just a basic combination of season salt, pepper, garlic and onion powders, and a little italian seasoning mixed with veg oil kind of thing (a take on the 'herb rubbed sirloin tip roast' recipe from this site.) Also made sure to let roast come to room temp b4 cooking. Holy cow it was AWESOME! Turned into a perfect, moist, medium rare delicacy! A 6 lb roast was gone in an hour! This would get 10 stars if I could! TYTYTY Lyn for the recipe!

I have been making my roast (almost) this way for 20+ years.  I only salt & pepper my roast, I preheat oven to 500 degrees, but my total cooking time is 2 hours no matter what the roast weighs.  I cook it about 7-8 minutes per pound, then turn the oven off, DO NOT OPEN, 15 minutes before the 2 hours is up, I turn it back on the 500, (for 15 minutes, it takes that long to preheat) and then my roast is done.  Always delicious!

I was skeptical, but made this following the directions and it was very good. I don't know if I would serve it as a stand alone roast, but I allowed it to cool, then sliced, tossed it with the drippings ( I had added some olive oil and fresh rosemary before cooking) and let it sit over night. I have  small catering business, and I made it into small silver dollar sandwiches with arugula, St.Andre cheese and horseradish sauce. Yum.

GRILL WINNER
I used my natural gas grill since I did not want to heat up my kitchen. I had a 4 lb eye of round so I cooked it at 475 degrees F for 28 minutes. I preheated the grill to 500 degrees F for 40 minutes while the seasoned roast came to room temperature. I placed the roast on oiled cooking grates, closed the lid and turned the heat down. I watched as the grill’s temperature lowered to 475 degrees F where the grill maintained the temperature for 28 minutes. I turn off all burners except for my smoker burner. This burner maintained a 200 degrees F temperature. After reading the reviews using a gas oven, I choose to maintain a low heat in my grill since there is no insulation to retain the heat. After 2 ½ hours, I placed the roast in heavy foil for 1 hour. I sharpened my 8” slicing knife and was able to cut very thin slices. This recipe made one of the best roast beef sandwich I have eaten. Since the roast was medium rare, which I like, it still had very red juices when I sliced the roast. I’m planning on using the beef in stroganoff, beef manhattans and BBQ sandwich. I have found, the thinner the slices, the beef is very tender where a thicker slice is chewier. Hope this helps anyone wanting to try on their grill.

Wow, what a great recipe. And what could be better than delicious, easy and inexpensive? Yes, you do have to take leap of faith with this one, and I'm so glad I did. Since I'm a fan of "two-fer" dinners, I started with a 4 lb eye of round to insure leftovers and made my own rub of olive oil, a bit of gravy browning sauce and a TINY smidge of liquid smoke, sea salt, pepper, garlic and onion powders and paprika. I used my hands and rubbed the mixture in well over the entire roast, then placed it on a Pam-sprayed rack in a baking dish. I cranked up the oven to 500 and left it on a bit per other reviewer suggestions, turned it down to 475, then followed the 7 min/lb rule and turned the oven off. I planned to take it out 3 hours later, but had about a delay, so roast ended up spending about 4 hours after the initial cook time. My oven holds heat well, so roast was still warm. Outside looked dry and the ends, of course were well done (but tasty) when I sliced off a bit to sample. But cutting into it revealed a beautiful pink, juicy center and oh, so delicious. My 10-year had 4 servings and even my picky 12-year old son had seconds. In my opinion, would have been even better if I'd taken it out at the 3-hour mark (I like mine more on the rare side). I served with Horseradish Sauce on this site and the meat just melted in your mouth -- yes, do slice very thinly. The leftovers will make perfect French Dip sandwiches for dinner later this week. BEST roast I've ever made!!!

This recipe was really good. I followed it almost to a tee. The only adjustment that I made was with the temperature because I prefer my meat well done.

One of the best Roast I ever made, adjusted recipe for family liking,(no one eats meat with any word rare in it).
Preheated as instructed, cooked at 475 degrees for 21 minutes (3lb Eye of Round).
Seasoned with, a dash of Garlic Powder, Onion Powder, Natures Seasoning, Salt & Pepper. 
Reduced heat to 200 degrees for 1hr. 30 min.
Covered w/foil oven off, about 1hr.
So ready to eat, no sides were eaten (homemade mashed potatoes, fresh green beans cooked for a few hrs. But all the family wanted was The Beef!

Excellent.  Mine was a 5lber so I let it roast for 35 min (according to the directions).  I was leery about cooking it this way since it was a pricey piece of meat but I am glad I did.  I will be making my roasts like this from now on.  I used a rub from another recipe from this site (Herb Rubbed Sirloin Tip Roast) and it was great.

Well, it has my 5 stars too!  My eye round was nearly 7 pounds.  I cooked at 475 for an hour(my guests only like well done) before turning oven off.  The doneness was perfect! It was tender & I wouldn't consider roasting any other way!  I have just one question:  Why did I learn of this recipe only when I reached 65? lol  Oh and, I'm thinking now of getting a good slicer so that I continue to enjoy such great roast beef sandwiches--both hot and cold!  I throw one of these in the oven every week.  We eat cold roast beef sandwichs, hot roast beef sandiwches and give the dog about a cup daily.  Every time I've made this it is absolutely perfect!  Sometimes I can't believe that I'm actually getting these results considering I have a reputation for using the fire alarm as my timer!

I was so suprised to end up with a perfectly med rare to med cut of beef that WAS tender. I followed the recipie RUBBING plenty off salt and pepper into the roast before putting it into the oven. The key is to 1 follow the directions.  2 slice as thinly as possible against the grain. 3 either serve with a flavorful sauce or serve on a sandwich w/ ajus.
I was very happy w/ the result. Thank you for simplicity and taste

Awesome!!!  I had a 2.9 lb Eye Round Roast.
  I made a paste and coated it all over with: 
olive oil, 
minced garlic (and some of the juice),
onion flakes,
salt & pepper 
  Then I followed the directions almost exactly except that because I have a gas oven I took the suggestion someone had made and instead of shutting off the oven entirely, I turned it down to 195.  My husband doesn't like rare beef, (but I do) and it came out just perfectly medium-pink.  There were a few pinker slices for me too.  If I ever make it for another occasion where others like it more rare I might just take it down to 175.  But overall I was so proud of myself for this roast!!  It was DE-OH-Licious!  Tender, juicy, and the crust was so tasty.  I will make this again and again!

Excellent. Followed recipe to a tee. Did a rub of garlic salt and pepper. Also did a Bottom round roast. Just tied into a roll with bakers cord. Turned out perfect. Make sure you know the weight.

Incredibly easy and delicious--the meat was tender and full of flavor.  I wanted to jazz it up a bit so for a 3# roast,  I made a paste of 5 garlic cloves minced through garlic press, 1TB chopped fresh thyme, generous amounts of salt and pepper and rubbed this on meat.  I also made a mushroom/wine sauce by sauteing for approximately 10 minutes on high heat: about 2 cups sliced mushrooms, 1/4 cup coarsely chopped shallots, 2 tsp. fresh chopped rosemary, 2 chopped fresh bay leaves.  Deglaze with 1/2 cup red dry wine, boil for a few minutes, add 1 cup beef stock, boil for another few minutes and add 1/4 cup heavy cream.  Add drippings from roast to this sauce, heat and serve with sliced meat.  Everybody loved it.

Am updating my review to 5 stars from 1 star because when done in an electric oven the results are fabulous.  This is how we do our holiday prime rib every year and every time it's absolutely perfect.  The directions need to start with "Preheat ELECTRIC oven" because this will definitely not work in a gas oven!  Here is my original review:  I wish I had taken the time to search out the bad reviews.  If I had I would have realized that this recipe is best not attempted with a gas oven.  I followed the recipe exactly, and I mean to a T, and it came out looking and smelling wonderful but the inside was still raw and barely warm.  I served medium rare slices from the ends but they were tough as leather.  I use a method very similar to this for our Christmas rib roast and it comes out incredibly.  But we always prepare it at our daughter's home and she has, you guessed it, an electric oven.  So in an electric oven I've no doubt this probably will be a 5-star roast.  But I'll be sticking to the crock pot for tougher cuts of beef from now on.

For all the Medium (pink) lovers.....I had two 2lb roasts. Preheat oven for 20min. at 500º. In the mean time, I prepared the meat with a nice coating of Worcestershire sauce, and 1/2 tsp each of Kosher salt and pepper. In the oven for 13 min. (Do not open oven). Then reset the oven temperature to 150º for the next 2 1/2 hours. Cooked Medium and juicy!

DELISH!  Wanted to try a roast beef but was always afraid.  Got a small 1.5 lb eye round for my family of 4.  Sprinkled all sides with a little salt, heavy on the pepper, onion powder, meat tenderizer and  garlic powder.  14 minutes at 500 and then turned it off for 1.25 hrs.  Amazing!  Never thought it would work but it came out perfectly light pink in the center and you could cut it with a fork!

I have made this roast many times by now. I've made some changes, instead of salt and pepper I use the rub from the " Herb Rubbed Sirloin Tip Roast" on this site instead of salt and pepper. My roast is usually about 5-6 lbs. Leave it in the preheated oven for 25 minutes and then turn off the heat. Leave it for 45-60 in the oven with the heat turned off. Take it out and let rest for 15 minutes covered with aluminum foil. Just about as good as a prime rib. The 2 1/2 hrs. mentioned in the recipe is way too long. I have a gas oven so that may make a difference

My old way used and I used to serve dry and tough meat.  Using this way - wow!  The meat was juicy and tasty.  I got raves over this one.  One hint, leave the roast out of the refrigerator about 1 hour before cooking to bring its temperature down.  Also, I used a spice rub the night before and let the flavors permeate the meat for about 24 hours.

If you like your beef very rare -- see the pic that accompanies the recipe -- this recipe may work well for you. But we like just a little pink, so this didn't cook the beef enough for us. After cooking my 1.6-lb. roast at 475 for 15 minutes, I turned off the oven and left it alone for almost three hours. When I finally checked it, the roast was cold -- and still bloody. I had to slice it into inch-think slices and turn the oven back on to 350 for another 30-35 minutes before the roast was medium well as we like it.

I was anxious to try this recipe as I cook for a family of 4 and found there was this 3 lb eye roast to cook in the fridge.  Since I know this cut of beef is not the most tender, I was anxious to give this highly rated recipe a shot.  The household does possess a very pricey electric oven (Dacor) so I knew the equipment wouldn't be an issue.  I used the 7 mins. per pound at 500 degrees version.  The meat was rubbed with olive oil, salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder. After the 21 mins., I reduced the temp to 200 degrees and cooked the roast for 1/2 hr.  and, uncovered, of course.  Then I shut the oven off and left it untouched for one full hour.  Couldn't wait to see the end result!  I was very happy to find--the meat was beautifully rare to med rare, oozed juice and just the right amount of blood (not overly so).  Best of all, it was so tender the children ate 3 helpings of it, sliced thin.  I was a bit rushed for time and didn't make the gravy from scratch, so in the bottom of the pan (BTW I cooked it in a LeCreuset dutch oven!) I simply mixed in a jar of store bought au jus gravy.  The sample photo you see of the meat is pretty much what we ended up with and I would classify this as a winner of a recipe.  The meat, after an hour of sitting in the turned-off oven was still hot & the hot gravy poured on top finished off the heating after slicing it.  I served with my own terrific sauteed potatoes/onion/mushrooms & tossed salad with balsamic dressing.  GREAT!!

I have used this recipe two different times and it turned out amazing!  I rubbed some minced garlic on top along with some minced onion, garlic pepper, and kosher salt.  I followed another tip to cook it 9 minutes per pound and it turned out amazing!  The meat was brown all the way through but very tender not chewy.

I always go through the reviews.  I read the most helpful/5 stars as well as reading the lowest ratings so I can get a feel to how the average person might fair.  I have to say that I was concerned after reading some of the 1 star ratings about it being raw in the middle, but after making this recipe several times, if you buy the right piece of meat it is as easy as people say it is.  I buy the English round from Sam's club (it looks like a big beef tenderloin with the fat on the top side).  I use a pre-made rub from Penzeys spices called Chicago Steak Seasoning that basically has the same ingredients many of the reviews have used and it turns out great.

Like others, I was stunned at how well this method works! I left out a star only because I would prefer more spice; this was a bit bland. However, I did make a gravy with the drippings and made up for it completely.

I highly recommend this method and thank you for posting the recipe. Next time, I will add Montreal Steak seasoning or a similar rub to the outside.

I had to try this recipe because of the cooking method. I wasn't disappointed. I put a meat thermometer in during cooking and it went up to 146 degrees at its highest, which is medium, but with the oven off dropped during the last 1 1/2 hours to 132 degrees. I don't know why but when I sliced it, it was  perfectly medium rare. Wow, great recipe.

Like many others mine did not reach 145 degrees medium rare. I tried this recipe twice. In the future I will turn the oven down after 21 minutes to 225 degrees to maintain heat. This temperature is often used to slow cook beef in a smoker so should be sufficient. Otherwise the roast is delicious but tough by their recipe.

Did a small roast, 1.8 lbs. by this method and it turned out perfectly.  Did 15 minutes on high and left it for two hours.  I made  rack out of baby cut carrots, one potato cubed and a half large onion cut in 1/2 inch slices.   Got perfetly roasted veggies to go with the roast and no burning or smoking in the pan.  Used a non-stick biscuit pan, just the right size with no room left over to burn.

omg!  I loved the simplicity of this.  I bought an eye of round the other day not realizing it wouldn't create a pot roast that would fall apart.  But found this recipe and used a spice rub with paprika, cumin and brown sugar and this ended up being so delicious for the last couple days.  I cut it into the thinest pieces and we've been making sandwiches.  When I took it out of the oven and was slicing the UPS guy came by and I had him try some and ended up printing the recipe for him.  Thanks for a simple and delicious recipe.

The only way to save my little 2 lb roast is to slice it extremely thin and cook it in bbq sauce for sandwiches. Eye of Round Roast is known for being a really cheap and tough piece of meat. Never Again! Don't bother even if it's on sale!

Followed this recipe to the tee and it was absolutly great and so easy.  For me, the doneness was right on target; however, other members of my family would have preferred a little less red.  So next time, I am going to try 9-10 minutes per pound instead of 7 and see how it comes out.  This roast was tender and juicy thru and thru.  Thanks allrecipes.com for this fabulous recipe.

My new favorite way to cook a lean roast.  It's quicker than other methods and doesn't get dry.  Instead of turning the oven off after the first 21 minutes, I have to leave my oven on at about 175 for 1 hour or else it's very rare.   I slice very thin for roast beef sandwiches when I have parties.  I love having a main course that doesn't take a lot of tending to while I'm trying to do other things.

Just two of us for dinner on a snowy day -- seasoned a 2 lb eye round roast with salt, pepper, and dried thyme leaves.  Roasted at 500 for 14 minutes -- turned off oven and left it in there for 2 hours.  It was fork-tender and delicious!  My husband is not a big beef eater -- and he asked for seconds!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This will definitely be my go to method for cooking this cut of roast beef from now on.  I rinsed the roast in a little red wine vinegar, rubbed with olive oil, minced garlic, rosemary, truffle salt and pepper.  My roast was 2.68 lbs and I cooked for 19 minutes, ended up letting it rest in the oven for almost 3 hours.  I personally went for the end pcs as it was probably more rare than medium rare in the middle.  If you like yours a little more done I might suggest adding just a few minutes to the cook time.  Thanks for sharing the recipe Lyn.

This was a great recipe.  My kids loved it.  I used the advice of others and added more spices to the rub, garlic cloves cut into the meat, and keeping my fancy oven on at 170 degrees since the fan will cool it down if I just turned it off.

I'm doing the Weight Watchers Core Program, and eye of round roast is on my food list. It's typically a pretty flavorless, tough cut, but this method really turned it into something yummy! And I'm going to take the leftovers and throw them into a pan with some bell peppers, onions, carrots, and teriyaki sauce, and voila! A filling for lettuce wraps! I'm going to try this with other cuts, too. Why not?

Loved it left it in for 2 hours instead of 2.5 and it was perfectly medium rare.
I rubbed it with oive oil and worsteshire sauce then dry rubbed it with a spicy seasoning I have.
My husband was shocked how weel this method worked. We felt like we were cooking green by having the oven off for 2 hours.
Thanks for a great recipe.
(Don't forget a nice spicy horseradish sauce on the side)

It came out very tender & delicious.  I roasted a 2lb eye of round for 22 minutes, then let it sit in the oven for an hour.  This was perfect!  Nice, hot & still enough "pink".  Definitely a keeper.

Important: Make sure your oven is clean before you try this roasting technique or you will get a lot of smoke in the kitchen.  I learned this the hard way, don't be like me: clean your oven!

I seasoned my 2.3 lb roast with salt, pepper,garlic and onion powder. Let it stand about and hour at room temp. Once the oven was preheated to 500* I let it stay at 500*for 20 minutes. Put thermometer in roast, Lowered it to 475* and cooked for 16 minutes (about 7 mins a lb). I turned the oven off and in an hours time it was already up to 130*.  I took it out when it hit 135* but being it only took an hour to cook, it wasnt even close to dinner time yet, so I put tinfoil tent on it.  Temp went up to 147* after sitting for a while.  When I cut it, most of it was pink (thick side) but the skinny side of the roast was gray, way over cooked.  Next time I will plan dinner for an hour after I turn the oven off and take it out when it hits 130*  The meat was very tender and juicey but would have liked it a bit bloodier. The family loved it and I will never make a roast any other way again! I gave it 4 stars because if I left it in the oven any longer without using the thermometer to tell me it was done,it would have been a piece of dried up leather!

Since I found this recipe it is the ONLY one I use for Eye of Round roast.  Honestly, you cant get any easier or more perfect of a recipe.  Last night I tried it with a little bit of minced garlice, salt, pepper and Olive oil and it was FANTASTIC! Today we had the leftovers.  Even better the next day. :)

This is a fantastic basic cooking method.  I wanted Italian Beef so changed it a bit  I marinated a 4 lb roast by using 3 envelopes of Italian Dressing, 1/2 tsp of Italian Seasoning, 1 tablespoon minced garlic, 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes, 1/4 cup olive oil & the juice of 2 lemons.   Mixed this all together then placed the roast in a bag & poured in the marinade.  Massage the meat & let it sit at least overnight then cook according to the recipe.   If you can, turn the meat several times while it is in the marinade.  Mine actually was in the marinade for about 18 hours.   I did find that it did not need to stay in the oven for 2 hours.  I pulled it when the temp read 145 degrees & it still ended up more medium than medium rare.  A meat thermometer is a must for this recipe.   I wrapped the whole thing in foil & refrigerated the cooked roast overnight which helped to seal in the moisture & allow the seasoning to penetrate the meat even more.   Sliced it paper thin for sandwiches tonight.  My sons said it was as good as Portillo's and if anyone is from Chicago, you know that is a true compliment.  Now I just need to work on the Portillo's chocolate cake!

I made this recipe using Montreal Steak spices and it turned out very tasty and quite tender. It reached 145 degrees quicker than the recipe indicated but I just left it in the oven until I was ready to serve it. I will definitely make it again.

I used this receipe but made a few changes, as other reviews have, to spice up the flavor.  We have a large herb garden and I love to use 'em rather than lose 'em.  Grabbed a few sprigs of thyme, lemon thyme, oregano, parsley and rosemary.  Threw herbs in a blender with 6 garlic cloves, crushed blackpeppercorns, crushed mustard seed, dry mustard, crushed fennel seed and blended well, after blending added EVOO to form a paste.  Spread paste all over roast then topped with garlic salt and Kosher salt.  
I had marinated the eye round in refrig for 2 days after sprinkling eye with Kosher salted and ground pepper.  This process really tenderizes the eye by allowing connective tissue to breakdown and also allows eye to pick up salt/pepper flavors deeper into the meat.  

I also add potatoes/carrots/celery/halved vidallia onions into pan to cook with the meat.  Cut all pieces into large cubes/chunks and toss in a gal bag w/ EVOO.  This adds flavor to pan drippings (what you have for a lean cut) and adds some oil to fat.  When cooking is done, I let meat stand prior to cutting and cover vegs in another dish.  I do this so I can make gravy w/ drippings.  To pan - add butter if no/little drippings, add Cognac to deglaze and add some mushrooms over med heat.  When shrooms done, while whisking add flour making a roux.  Looks messy but will taste great.  When roux is darkened, add Better Than Bullion beef stock (careful, can be salty), reduce while whisking.  Add cold H2O to thin.  Yum!

I have made this recipe so many times and I cannot believe I've never rated it.  The 5 stars says it all!  Although I'm a very good cook, I must admit I'm not very good at preparing beef, especially roasts.  Somehow I always seemed to dry them out...but, no more!  We like our beef medium well, slightly pink, no blood.  So, I made this on 500-degrees for 9 min./pound.  Then reduced the temperature to 475 for 5 min., turned the oven off and left it for 2 1/2 hours as directed.  I made several slits in the roast and inserted pieces of garlic clove.  Because we wanted a crusty, crust on the roast, I crushed spices in my trusty wooden mortar and pestle I was given by a dear friend while vacationing in Brazil.  Onion powder, garlic powder, kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper, a pinch of thyme and dried rosemary leaves.  Oh, I also drizzled some olive oil over the roast.  The result was wonderful!  After thinly slicing the meat and dipping it into the pan drippings, we had it on crusty bread with Creamy Horseradish Garlic Spread from this site (also a wonderful recipe).  Served with sweet potato fries made in the oven and a pasta side dish.  Yum!

This strait up does not work unless you have a brand new top of the line oven that will retain heat like a champ. 

Electric, gas, makes no difference. I have a decent electric oven and after 2.5 hours it was barely warm. 120 degree middle and it was only a 2 pound eye of round. Had to turn the oven back on, finish it off in 10-15 minutes, and it ended up being fine. But I think letting it cool down to room temperature in the oven was a waste of time.

Id only made a roast beef once before, and it was horrible, but I gave this one a chance, since it seemed so easy. I cut 10 holes in the roast, and put a small clove of garlic in each hole, and I seasoned with whatever I could find in the cabinet. I baked it fat side up, as a reviewer had mentioned, and it turned out amazing. My roast was 2 1/2 pounds so I cooked it for 18 minutes, and turned the oven off. I took it out in 2 hrs and 15 minutes, and let it sit for about 40 min, while I mashed the potatoes and used the fat drippings to make gravy!! (That was easy, slowly adding about 2 tablesspoons of flour and about 1/3 of a cup of water to the dripping, mixing the whole while) It was right between MR and M, and was soooo great. My husband, who is a total meat and potatoes guy, said it was the BEST meal I had ever made him, and wanted me to print out the recipe so he could keep it to make sure I didnt lose it!!!

Very different way to cook a roast.  I had never heard of this method before, but I will use it again.  The meat was loaded with flavor and very moist.  I used a round end roast tonight, but would like to try it with an arm or chuck next time.   Also, as a suggestion from another AR user, she said to try the seasoning from "Roast Sticky Chicken - Rotisserie Style" on the roast.  The seasoning was wonderful and added a lot of flavor to the meat.  Paired the meat with the "Potatoes and Carrots" recipe from the AR website.  Hit the spot on this Blizzard 2011 night in Indiana.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I was skeptical on cooking the meat this way. I cooked the 2 lb eye of the round for 14 mins & then left it in the oven for 2 1/2 hrs. It came out perfect..Lt pink all the way through. My husband said this is the best roast beef I've ever cooked. Thanks for such an easy recipe. I won't cook my roast beef any other way now

I believe this recipe is tailored to home cooks with consumer grade ovens that are poorly engineered and have very little thermal insulation. The lack of thermal insulation in these low end ovens mandates a 3hr cook time due to excessive heat loss. If you have a DCS, Decor, Bosch, Thermador, GE Monogram, professional type oven, after the oven is turned off, the heat retention is much higher due to better insulation, and the roast cooks at a higher avg temp than the low end ovens. I have found that 7-min per pound at 500-deg, convection off and oven off with door shut for 45min, will yield the pictured medium pink results if cooked in a professional oven. It's probably an accurate recipe if you are in the unfortunate position of having to cook with a consumer grade appliance.

THIS WAS AWESOME!!! I was very nervous so I took others suggestions... I preheated the oven for about 30 mins at 500 degrees and I read that someone used a pizza stone to keep the heat in while the oven was turned off so I did that too.. I seasoned my roast w/ just salt and pepper and a cut up alittle garlic and put that top too than I put my roast in the pan w/ the fat side up, I had a smaller 2lb roast and I wanted it more med so I cooked it at 9 mins per lb instead of the regular 7 mins per lb and than I turned it off and didn't touch it. 40 mins later (20 mins per lb) I took it out and left it on the stove top, uncovered, while I made the sides and my hubby kept itching to cut it but I wouldn't let him. THIS CAME OUT GREAT!!! It was perfectly pink inside w/ just alittle juice coming out of it. My kids didn't love it, too rare for them but me and hubby thought it was perfect! My only complaint is that it needed WAY more spices for our taste but that's a personal preference. I made garlic mashed potatos and I bought an Au Jus mix and made that to go with it and that went really well w/ this meal. DEFINATLY give this recipe a try.. you won't be disapointed!

Wow!  My roast was only 3.75lbs.  I only kept it in the oven at 500 for 9 minutes.  Having a gas stove that is at least 12 years old I took the advise of a few other posters I turned the oven down to 175 (the lowest it would go) for another hour and a half. It came out perfect.  Oh and if you don't have a clean oven...500 degrees will set off the smoke detector.  Ugh.  :)

Along with everyone else, I too was questioning this recipe. So when rump roast went on sale I wanted to try this. 5lb roast for the family into the oven it went. As the oven I am currently using has a questionable seal, I greatly reduced the oven temp rather than turn the oven off, until the last 45 min. The roast was perfection!!!!! I will never oven cook a roast any other way from now on. Thank you, thank you, thank you. So nice to be able to roast a leaner cut.

The roast is fine, but the time it takes is completely pointless, especially if you are trying to cook anything to accompany your meal.  When I make a roast, I usually have yorkshires or potatoes in the oven roasting as well, and this won't let you do that.  Just stick to the usual guidelines and your roast will taste the same and in a third of the time: preheat to 550f, reduce to 350 once the roast goes in and cook 18-20 mins. a pound.  Check meat temperature towards the end: 140f for rare, 170 for well done.  As another poster wrote, make sure you let your meat rest.

JUST DON'T OPEN IT!!! I doubted the recipe as many had...and am truly amazed!  Restaurant quality!  I have an oven that doesn't keep heat well, so I put a 3 1/2lb. roast on for 18 min at 500, let it sit for 2 hours (my oven was cold by then)and then on for another 30 min. at 300 degrees as I read others' comments and to bring the warmth back to the meat.  I'd maybe tailor it to your liking if you like it well done.  I like rare meat and mine was a bit more than pink.  I am a believer and will try this everytime!

Excellent - I put a raisin paste on it - tastes like a gourmet meal!  In a food processor place raisin (I used some dried apricots, as I ran out of raisins), garlic, red wine and rosemary and blend into a paste. Coat all sides of the roast and marinate overnight.  Then I followed the recipe above.  My brother gave me the idea - I would never have thought of anything like it and it takes incredible!

I was afraid this was going to be dry and tough with no liquid in the recipe, but it ended up tasting like the best roast beef I'd ever had - perfectly pink and oh-so juicy in the center (even the leftovers in a ziplock bag were juicy the next day!).  My only change was using steak seasoning.  I would have killed to have some horseradish in my house that night...  I'll definitely be making this again.

I have worked in many a restaurant  where we used this EXACT method of cooking  roasts, and have never ONCE had it fail in over 20 years of using this method.. I have seen several people rap this method and I only have a couple of tips I can add that we have used in the restaurants:


1. Make sure your roast is at room temperature. If it is cold, it will come  out cold.. It MUST be at room temperature.


2, Do not just pre-heat the oven and  then slide the roast in. You not only need to pre-heat the oven to the indicated temperature, but then let the oven continue to be on for at LEAST 30 minutes.


3. Make sure that your roast has a fat cap on it, and that you place the roast in the pan FAT SIDE UP. This is after seasoning it. An extra lean roast will come out dry. I usually buy the Swift brand in a Cryovac bag at about 7 pounds and cut the roast in half. Swift includes a nice fat cap on their Eye of Round roasts.


4. At least in my ovens, I found that 6 minutes a pound is best. So if it is  3.5 lbs, you are going to cook it at 500 degrees for 21 minutes, then kill the heat.


5. Have the roast  all properly seasoned at room temperature, and in the pan BEFORE You open the oven door. Pop it in, close the door, start your first timer (for the cooking phases)  and when you come back at the end of the cooking  resist the urge to "just take a peek". If you open the oven door, you will lose a bunch of heat.


6. Optional but HIGHLY recommended. Brush some Kitchen Bouquet all over

I've been trying to figure out how to make a roast the way my Nana did every Sunday for years.  I don't know if this was her method, but it sure comes out as good as hers!  I brushed my roast with olive oil and rubbed fresh ground salt, fresh ground pepper, garlic powder and thyme all over it.  Then I followed the cooking instructions exactly.  Delicious. My husband says its the best roast I've ever cooked.  I agree. We've been married 27 years. Thank you!

Bought this 4lb. Eye of Round Roast @ Walmart for $13.00 today. Cooked it @ 475 for 17 min. then turned the oven off & let it sit in there for 3 hours. Took out & let it rest for 30 more min. before slicing.  I ended up with 16 nice size juicy, tender slices and boy oh boy was it the BEST!!!  I was at first skeptical of trying this out & after reading some reviews I decided what the hell, and now I am a beliver:)  Here is my picture of how mine turned out>

Gas Oven Users - beware! The oven does not stay warm enough to cook the meat. I took the advice of others and instead of turning the oven off at the required time, I turned it down to about 180 and cooked for 30 minutes, then turned off completely w/out ever opening the oven door. Sliced and meat was pretty bloody - popped back in the oven @ 350 for 15 minutes and that seemed to do the trick (being on the rare to med/rare side).  Did not get the "melt in your mouth" meat that others did - rats!  Did baste w/ browning sauce prior - added a little flavor, not much.  Probably won't try this one again.

I bought one of these roasts for my husband's birthday meal and THEN went online looking for a recipe. This one popped up, and so many people said that this was the only way to cook this cut of meat. It seemed like a weird cooking method to me, but who am I to disagree with a thousand reviewers?

I'm glad I took the leap of faith. I rubbed the roast with salt, pepper, seasoned salt, garlic powder and onion powder and cooked as directed. The roast came out of the oven much smaller than it went in, and looked possibly overcooked on the outside. But it wasn't! 

It was cooked absolutely perfectly, flavorful and juicy. Best of all, the pan drippings, thickened with a little flour and cooked with a can of beef broth added made the easiest and best beef gravy I have ever tasted. It was deep and rich in color and flavor and complemented the roast perfectly. We wanted to lick our plates, it was that good.

This is an exceptionally tender & delicious roast.  I followed the recipe to a T.  The only problem that I had was there were no drippings in the bottom of the pan.  This did not effect the tenderness of the roast but I didn't have any drippings to make the gravy.   Any suggestions?

Simply fantastic! Did this with a Beefalo round roast, and it turned out delicious. I would usually do a round roast in the crock-pot and it would come out good, but a bit blah. This was such a nice change. The only change I made was after I applied seasonings (seasoned salt, garlic powder and pepeer, I seared the outside of the roast in a bit of olive oil. That quick sear, in addition to the high-temp cooking put the nicest, flavorful crust on the roast. Perhaps the best part of this insanely easy recipe was the fact that I could turn the roast off after the alotted time, and take a nap! Nice bonus! :)
Oh! I forgot! The next day, the leftovers of this rival the texture/flavor of the deli eye round in our local supermarket that sells for $9.99/lb.

Another 5-stars from me.  Every time I've tried en eye of round or sirloin tip it's a tough, bland failure.

This was perfect!  I inserted a meat probe before putting in the oven so I wouldn't have to open the oven during cooking.  3.1 pound roast, 22 minutes at 475F, then reduced to 180F.  After one hour I turned on the temperature probe and simply waited for the meat to reach 145F.  Rested for 20 minutes, and it was a perfect meium throughout.

Enough drippings for a rich, delicious gravy.

I'm not sure what happened to those who gave a 1-start review.  I'm glad mine turned out.  Couldn't be easier.

I am sorry but this cut of meat will never be tender. I have tried this recipe twice. Thinking a miracle would happen the second time. But no. I used the exact times and temps for the weight of roast (Choice Angus) that I had.  I used olive oil,  sea salt, fresh ground pepper and garlic  for the rub. Let the roast sit for 20 min. before slicing thin. Nice taste but will never be tender.

Well, I can say my round roast looked pretty much like the photo.  That's it.  Followed the instructions completely, and ended up with a hunk of meat so tough it is inedible.  In addition, at 500 degrees, my entire house filled with so much smoke that it set off the smoke alarm in the kitchen.  By the end of the cooking time, the meat was at room temperature, and thus had to be put back into the oven to warm.  A truly bizarre recipe.  Wish it would have worked.

I followed the directions exactly as stated.  Meat was undercooked and tough.  Will not be making it again.

Success! My mom uses this method, and it makes a great roast. I had a 2.25 lb roast, which I smothered in a paste of salt, pepper, garlic granuals, and grapeseed oil. I cooked the roast for 16 minutes at 475, 35 minutes at 250, and then I turned the oven off for about 20 minutes. I turned the heat back on to 250 for about 10 minutes before pulling the roast out of the oven. I roasted the meat fat side up and let it rest before slicing it. Also, be sure to let the roast sit at room temp for at least 1/2 hour before you cook it, and preheat the oven well. Many thanks to those who mentioned the difference between gas and electric ovens as well as fancier, better insulated ovens - smart!  My oven is gas and is a non-fancy apartment model (LOL). I have a very high quality roasting pan, which does retain heat, but 2 hours with the oven off would have left me with a cold roast. If you're making this, read the reviews and adjust your recipe accordingly. I served this sliced thin with au jus and a little mix of horseradish and sour cream for dipping. Yum!

I've made this several times, and I've tweaked the recipe over time.  I make a mixture of spices and 1T of flour to rub on the roast, then cook it at 475F for 30 minutes.  Then I reduce the heat to 200F for 2 hours.  It turns out about medium and is dripping with juices.  Because I rubbed the roast with flour, there is a perfect gravy starter on the bottom of the pan, which I ad 1 cup of water and 1T of butter too.  Yum!  I would recommend this recipe to anyone.

I followed the recipe exactly, and the thermometer actually dropped in temp as the oven cooled. I turned the heat on to 300, and now it's almost done. It's been in the oven for 3 hours. I have a normal oven, nothing special about it. Will not make again.

This is fantastic! I brushed my 3 lb roast with Gravy Master, seasoned it with 1 tsp of salt, 1/2 tsp Worcestershire black pepper, 1/2 tsp garlic powder and 1/2 tsp of thyme (premixed together). Had guests for dinner and told them I was trying a new recipe. They begged for leftovers to take home. Served it with Alexis chipotle sweet potato fries, fresh green beans seasoned with green onions and sweet red pepper and a spinach/pear/Mandarin orange salad with rasperry vinaigrette dressing. This was definitely a winner and emailed my daughter a copy of the recipe.

I too was a skeptic but WOW...the best eye round I've ever made or tasted...moist, tasty, and tender! My roast was slightly larger (almost 5lbs)so I preheated and roasted to 500 degrees for 30 minutes. After that I set the oven to 170 degrees for the remainder of the time. The roast was a little more medium-well but still yummy. For seasoning I combined advice and coated with both olive oil and Kitchen Bouquet, rubbed generously with minced garlic and sprinkled on seasoning salt and italian seasoning. This will now be my go-to eye round recipe!

This recipe was a disaster in our Electrolux Icon oven.  During the 500 degree phase, smoke from burning fat filled our kitchen.  After turning off the oven and waiting 90 minutes, I opened the door, inserted a meat thermometer into the 3.75lbs roast and found that it was 156F.  It was overdone and dry.

I have had to teach myself to cook over the years and have never attempted to do a roast until yesterday. It was so good and I am very proud of myself.  It was so easy, especially if you have to run out (like I did) becasue you shut  the oven off and you can leave! Perfect and yummy.  I did cook it longer per pound (about 9 min per pound) as none of us are real rare meat people.

Excellent technique, searing at high heat then slow(er) roasting. I did not turn the oven off. Instead, I to turned it down to 200 for the balance. The result was a perfect medium-well roast. Thanks!

(the jus is excellent too! Spice well...)

I was so scared to make this, especially because I have a gas stove, I'm kind of a beginner cook and I rarely ever make a roast and they haven't always worked out well for me.  I read ALL of the reviews and put my 2.1 lb roast in on a rack/shallow pan with olive oil, fresh minced garlic, salt and pepper for 15 min (yes my fire alarms also went off) and then turned oven off.  Sure enough after one hour my oven was cool to touch so I turned it on to about 180 for the second hour.  I very anxiously took it out and was shocked to have the most moist/tender roast ever.  It was pretty rare but so tasty it was mouth watering.  DH says turn oven on the 180 for the full two hours next time and we might get color just right but we gobbled it up anyway!  My 13 years old went bananas over it.  Thanks for recipe and all reviewers' help.

Followed directions except seasoned my own way. We like medium rare, and this was perfect. Unbelievably flavorful for this type of roast. Definitely like horseradish sauce with this, but very good without. Just another excellent recipe from All Recipes!*****Update*** we have cooked this several more times at 7 minutes per pound it is a little too rare for the whole family at 9 min. the outside of this roast more suits the kids and the center is more med. rare - using a newer gas oven

This recipe made me sign up for this web site!  I cook pretty often, but have always been afraid to try making roast beef.  I figured it would come out like chalk.  The prospect of throwing away meat is more than I can take.  Well this came out just like meat at a restaurant or expensive deli.  I have to say I did use a different cut of meat (a round roast from the butt because it had a good layer of fat on top and nice marbling through the meat).  I did NOT allow the meat to reach room temperature before I cooked it.  I pulled it from the fridge, rinsed and tied the meat with twine (I have read this helps the meat to retain its round shape and juices.)  I seasoned it with Kitchen Bouquet, salt, pepper, and garlic.  "Painting" the meat with Kitchen Bouquet made a nice deep crust on the outside.  I followed the cooking instructions, only adjusting for the weight of the meat I was cooking, which was 2 lbs.  I allowed the oven to reach 500 and waited an extra ten minutes to make sure that the oven was really hot as was suggested in another comment (thanks!) then I lowered the temperature to 475, shoved the roast in the oven and let it roast for 15 mins, then I turned the oven off and did NOT open the door.  Two hours later (people around here do not like really rare meat) I pulled out a piece of meat that looked like it had been on the grill a tad too long.  I stuck my meat thermometer in and the meat was at 140 degrees. I let it rest for 15-30 mins.

I had a 3.75 pound roast and after reading many reviews, here is what I did:
Took the roast out of the fridge and let it sit for about 45 minutes.  Preheated the oven to 500 and kept it there for 20 minutes to really heat up before putting in the roast and turning the temp to 475.  Cooked at 475 for 24 minutes (a little less than 7 minutes a pound because we like it more on the pink side).  

At this point in the original recipe, you shut the oven off, but since I have a gas oven that doesn't hold heat very well, after reading other reviews I turned the heat to 175 rather than shutting it off completely.  I went with the 20 minutes per pound suggestion, so was planning to keep it in for 75 minutes.  

At the end of the 75 minutes my meat thermometer read 120.  I was hoping to be a little closer to 130, so I turned up the heat to 200 and left it in the oven another 15 minutes.  At this point, it read just under 130, and since we like it really pink, I took it out.

Let it rest for 15 minutes and then sliced it thin.  It was pretty much a perfect medium rare all the way through.  Tender, juicy, and delicious.  My whole family loved it (a rare occurrence in my house!).
 
Next time I think I'll go down to 200 degrees (instead of 175) right after the initial high-temp portion.  I think the 20 minutes a pound timing will be perfect that way.

This is a great 'guideline' recipe, but oven temps very tremendously, so I would advise careful monitoring.  Letting the meat  come to room temp prior to roasting is also very important.   I used a meat thermometer and my roast reached 140 within 1 hour of turning off the oven.  Actually a little too done for my taste, but still flavorful and relatively tender.

This is the 4th time I made this eye roast this way. Again it came out tender like a fillet minion. It was so tender and juicy. I did a 4 lb roast sprinkled it with fresh ground pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, seasoned salt. If anyone gets a tough roast then it is time for you to replace your oven because it is the oven not the recipe. I have a new oven and it holds the heat so the meat was juicy and tender. I also suggest that you use a 3.5 or larger cut of eye round anything smaller will be tough. I saved the leftovers and cut it on my slicer real thin for roast beef sandwiches with provolone cheese and long Italian hot peppers on real crispy Italian rolls two days later  and everyone loved it "super tender"!!!

I found this recipe in a Vampire Romance novel of all places and thought what the heck, lol. So the next roast of beef I bought went into a 475 oven for 20 minutes and then I turned the oven off and waited for two hours. I've had problems with beef roast always being tough or tasteless from over cooking. You know the kind where you chew forever and it's horrible? This way to cook a roast turned out to be THE BEST ROAST BEEF EVER! It was by far the most tender beef roast I've ever cooked and the flavor was outstanding. I love the fact that you can just leave it in the oven and don't have to constantly watch it to see if it's done. You do not have to have any certain cut of beef. I can see this working on any of them. Basic rule- 7 minutes per pound then turn off the oven and wait.

I really liked my roast beef dinner tonite! i had 5 helpings and also used a creamy horseradish sauce from allrecipes also. I will admit I was nervous reading this recipe and really went through the reviews before I decided to go for it.. However I didnt follow the recipe completely. I did go with a review I saw here. ((peanutbutterboy.com))) 
1st of all I was nervous because I have a gas stove Im not sure if it would have held heat sufficiently. When I saw this review and the size of the roast was almost exact I decided to try it. I did rub down the roast with gravy master and some montreal spice mix I had on hand. Then went with and preheated 500 degree oven. put roast in turned to 475 degree for 18 mins. Then turned down to 200 degrees with a meat thermo in the thickest part. I went with the 20 mins per pound concept, but, the temperature didnt work out with the timing. Thank goodness I wasnt working with a set time. I did bump up temp to 250 till we hit 143 degrees.. and we were hungry so we took it out,let it sit for 10 mins and it was the best roast beef I have had in a long time. It was just like the picture listed. Would have liked it a little bit more med, but again we were hungry! will become a standard recipe for roast beef for us! It was tender and tasty and I cant wait to have a rb sandwich tomorrow with the horseradish sauce too!! a nice asiago crusty bread is the ticket! Thanks it will be one i can play with using different spices etc for the rub

bought 2 of the eye of round roasts yesterday at costco figuring I would give them one last try. they always turn out with great flavor but tough and chewy. I was going to try them in a crock pot but decided to try this recipe since there were so many positive reviews. All I can say is it is the poor mans prime rib! Not quite as good as prime rib but cetainly a more affordable alternative! I pretty much stuck to the recipe and put only salt and pepper on it before baking. I did turn on the oven again (200) about 30 minutes before taking out since I was worried it would be cold. It was fantastic! Thanks so much I can finally cook a great roast other than a standing rib roast. Thanks also to the person who suggested the le cruset(?) type pan to cook it in, never thought to use that I usually cook them in glass but the porcelain/iron pan works much better.

Have a similar recipe for roasting a turkey and being a fan of roasting at high temperatures and with great success I thought I'd try this one.  

I started with a 4 lb. chuck roast that wasn't completely thawed out, so I defrosted it fully in the microwave.  Then I rubbed the roast with seasonings (actually a bag of McCormick seasonings after I decided not to use the plastic bag method (which is actually steaming, NOT roasting) and then cut slits and inserted cloves of garlic into the entire roast.  Preheated the oven to 500 degrees and placed the roast (fat side up) into it for 25 minutes, then turned it over and cooked the other side about another 8 minutes.  The idea is to seal the roast with crispy exterior while the interior remains juicy.  After this, I turned the roast again back to the fat side up and added quartered potatoes (about 5 medium ones) and about 3 quartered onions and 5 carrots.  I then placed these around the roast and put it back into a 375 degree oven for 1.5 hours.   Everything came out perfectly roasted - crunchy on the outside and juice and tender on the inside.  I also drizzled olive oil on the meat before I added the seasoning rub and also drizzled olive oil on the potatoes, carrots, and onions.  Magnifico!  

A word of caution:  before using this method of cooking be sure to test your oven to see if it actually is correct in temperature.  If not, you will not get good results.

Given the good reviews, I was very dissapointed by this recipe. I followed the directions exactly for a 3lb round roast. When I took it out of my gas oven after 2.5 hours, the oven was stone cold, the roast was only 110 F. I sliced into it and it looked like prime rib, so I counted it done, but the juices in the bottom of the pan were NOT cooked, so it seems like there could be a food safety issue possibly. The roast was moist, but not softened at all the way it would with a slow cook/low heat method... I wonder what type of ovens the people who found this good are using.

This method of cooking has finally given me what I wanted from an eye round roast!  It was tender, juicy and pink in the middle, just the way we like it!  I did tinker with the seasoning a little.  I put Worcestershire on it and Stubbs mesquite smoke flavoring.  Then I sprinkled the roast with garlic salt and Penzey's BBQ 3000.  I had a 3 pound roast and the drippings were fabulous!  Just remember to slice this roast in 1/4" slices, at the most, across the grain.

A fool proof way to cook a roast!!! Because of my oven, I set it to 200 after the initial sear. I also rolled it in peppercorn, spices & sea salt before I popped it in the oven. It was perfect and I will be doing it for Easter, too.

Found this easy, roast came out tasty, altho I would have preferred a little more "pink" which means I'll just reduce the cooking time..  I had a 5lb roast.. cooked for 35 min at 475.. maybe I'll  just do a little less.  otherwise awesome

I had a 4lb roast and extended the cook time to 10mins per lb instead of 7 because I prefer my roast cooked more than rare. I even cooked an additional 10 mins before I turned off the heat. I knew my oven will stay hot so the roast would continue to cook. After time was up I cut into the middle and it was still to too rare so I baked at 350F for an additional 30mins then let it sit covered for 30mins. When I sliced it, it was still pink but more medium well and the juice was pink not clear. It was NOT tender at all, but very tough. I fault myself for purchasing the cheap cut and expecting it to be tender. I just couldn't justify spending $65 on a prime rib when the eye of round was $15. I think I will go back to my regular way of cooking a roast and save the cheap cuts for stewing.

My roast was only 1.72lbs. so I only cooked it 14 minutes, but after 2 1/2 hours of sitting, it was ice cold. I read other reviews about reducing sitting time, but was affraid my roast wouldn't be done. it was done rare enough, just cold.

I had never made a roast before 2 days ago when I read this recipe.  I have had the stereotypical grey, dried out eye roast and was a little leery of how to succeed with this.    This recipe is absolutely amazing.  I now have 2 more eye roasts in the oven which I'm cooking for a big family dinner tomorrow.    I found that the 7 mins per pound was accurate but that my oven didn't retain the heat necessary to bring the roasts to 130º.  I read in the reviews that one person boosted the heat a bit by setting it to 225º rather than to "off".  I found that it worked well for me to turn it off (after the requisite time at 475º) for about an hour or more until the temperature peaked and then to turn it on to 225º to give it a boost in reaching 130º.  After resting, I sliced into an absolutely PERFECT eye roast.  The icing on the cake, however, is that it is actually BETTER the second day...tender, pink, doesn't need reheating.  Once you've tried this method, you won't ever need to look for another.

Following this cooking method is the best advice I have ever got when cooking an eye of round roast.  I like to marinade my roast with a grainy mustard, salt, pepper, mrs dash, rosemary and fresh minced garlic, as well as about 1 cup red wine and 1/4 cup olive oil.  I let this sit in a sealed bag in the fridge over night, turning occasionally.    I bring the roast out of the refridgerator 30 minutes before putting it in the oven to bring the meat to room temperature.  Like another reviewer I like to preheat my oven really well so I turn it on to 500f once I take the roast out of the refridgerator.  Then I follow the cooking instructions to the letter, 7 minutes per pound and leave in oven 2 1/2 hours

Absolutely perfect sliced roast beef.  This is what I have been looking for to make good french dip sandwiches so I shaved it pretty thin and it worked out wonderfully!  Followed the directions to a T and I couldn't have asked for more.**** I've made this probably 10 times since I first reviewed it and it's still the best method of cooking this tough piece of meat.  I have a meat slicer and I put it on fairly thin slices, absolutely perfect for french dip.  I also have taken the slices and chopped them up with a knife and heat with some BBQ sauce for chopped beef BBQ.  Absolutely awesome.  The price of roast beef in the deli is at least 9.99/lb, and a 3 lb roast is only 7.00 total.  For the two of us a 3 lbs roast makes about 6-8 individual meals, for 7 bucks.  Can't beat that :)

I agree with another reviewer's comments....right on.  It's better to take minutes per pound.  With my oven, had I taken 2.5 hours it would have overcooked the meat.  Here's my variation: 1 hour out of the refrigerator to warm up (crusted with kosher salt and fresh ground pepper).  With a 2.8 pound roast,   7 minutes per pound at 500 degrees, then 20 minutes per pound.  My oven dropped to 200 at the end of 60 minutes and the roast was 136 on the instant read.  200 degree oven temp. is the  magic number.  I turned the oven to 200 for another 20 minutes and it went to 146.  Tented for another 15 min.  Just past med. rare, wonderfully pink and tender . LOVE this method, will do it again!

WOW! Unbelievable! Work up your courage and try this unique recipe to make eye of round tender - very tender. This works!      I've been making really good roasts for 40 years - except for eye of round which is usually dry and rather flavorless.  Lyn B's outrageous sounding recipe has solved the problem!     You will probably hold your breath when it's time to finally open the oven to see what's happened to your roast.  I didn't think it was possible for beef to continue to roast when the oven is turned off for so long.  My family loved it to the point of eating the whole 4 lb roast for dinner. "I couldn't believe they ate the whole thing!"       I've subsituted rump roast and sirloin tip roasts and they are just as tender and juicy.  Do yourself a favor and try this recipe.

This did not work for me. I have a brand new oven but it did not stay warm. After an hour I became suspicious when the door of the oven wasn't even warm. I opened the door and the roast was cool enough to touch with my hand. The thermometer was barely registering. I think a high heat start believe with slow roasting is key to a tender roast, but you need to supply some heat--the oven will not cook your roast if you turn it off. I finished cooking it at 300 degrees and it came out fine.

Excellent! Who would have thought such a budget-friendly cut of meat could turn out so succulent and delicious! I had to do some simple math to convert the 3-lb. cut noted in the recipe to fit my 2-lb. purchase, and I coated the meat with coarse sea salt and dried parsley since that's what I had on hand. But it came out absolutely perfect :)

This was really good despite the fact that my oven obviously DID NOT hold in the heat. I even did what a couple of the reviewers had said 1) let meat come to room temp 2) heated oven for 20 min. I had a smaller roast (2.12lbs) and it still didn't heat it all the way. It was at the end of the 2hrs and 10 min and it read 108 degrees. I turned the oven back on to 350 and cooked it for about an hour and checked it. It eventually got up to 150 I let it rest for about a half hr sliced it up and it was awesome. It was tender and juicy and full of flavor! When I make it next time I will try switching it to 200 after the initial 500 and check it after an hour or so and go from there!

Sorry, this did not work for me.  The roast was mostly raw (and I like rare meat).  Had to cut off the ends and put it back in the oven to finish cooking.

This was a fantastic way to cook this kind of cut.  My advice would be the following:  * Definitely marinate the meat for additional tenderizing.  I used a version of one of the earlier marinades on here, a combination of apple cider vinegar, dijon mustard, rosemary salt and papper.  I made cuts into the meat and pushed the marinade in, then let it sit for about an hour.  I would probably do longer next time, even overnight.  * If you have a remote thermometer I would definitely use that, so you don't have to do any guesswork on what the meat temperature is or open the oven while it is cooking.  My electric oven tends to run pretty hot.  I had a 6.5lb roast, let it cook at 45 minutes at 500 degrees.  Shut the oven off and I let it sit.  The internal temperature got to 145 degrees in an hour and I let it get to 150 degrees after another 10 minutes before pulling it out.  I covered it in foil and let it sit on the counter for another hour or so before I sliced it.  Meat was perfectly medium on the inside and well towards the ends.  Nothing was too dry and all of the meat was moist.  If I'd left it in for the entire 2.5 hours it would have been way overdone.  * I used an electric slicer to make extremely thin cuts of the meat and then kept them in au jus gravy based on the pan drippings.    Everyone seemed to like the meat and I will definitely use this recipe again.

Outstanding!  I was quite wary of the instructions - I thought it would be cold and very rare after 2.5 hours, but it came out great! Perfectly med-rare, sliced thin, it is a delicious roast beef.  Garlic, salt and a little pepper make it even more flavorful. (Thumbs down to the reviewer today who was disappointed... s/he obviously opened the oven door or didn't heat it properly.

The flavor was great and the meat was tender, but still a bit to rare for me.  I'm going to try it again, but a bit longer the 7 min per pound at 475.

awesome recipe - the cooking directions are  perfect if you use a medium to large roast - for a small roast, go down at least a minute per pound - and then flavor to taste but definetely use some garlic  smart idea; place finerling potatoes in the baking pan and raise the roast up above on a rack - I coated the potatoes in extra virgin olive oil and sea salt and they turned out as perfect as the roast - give it a try

If you want this to work at ALL in a gas oven, you'll need to do what vectorgirl (and others) suggest: imitate the slower rate that an electric oven cools by "stepping down" your temperature (e.g., 475 for recommended time, then a step to 350/375 for 45-60min, followed by a step to 225 for an hour or so).  Of course, this takes all the "easy" out of the recipe, hence the 3 stars.  It also is kinda dried out, probably from the constant dry/gas heat.  Thus, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone with a gas oven.

After 3 hours, the meat temperature was 112 degrees. Had to cook it for an extra hour at 350 to get it to the proper temperature. Came out gray and overcooked, just like I remember (not fondly) my mom cooking it.   I thought this recipe would rid the need to sear the meat (and clean the extra pan). Wrong. Four hours, and ruined meat.

Perfection!  I love recipes like this - simple, tasty and bullet-proof.  Only changes I make are the rub each time.  Tonight I used a McCormick Mesquite seasoning and it was AWESOME! Additionally, I cook for 12 minutes per pound to get our desired doneness.  Used this recipes about 6 times now and love it more each time!  TY!

OMG..This roast recipe is fantastic. Thank you, thank you, thank you!! I altered the recipe a bit by cooking for 9 minutes per pound and turning the oven back on to 350 degrees for the last 15 minutes. It was cooked perfectly and I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli and asparagus. The family loved every bite, lol.

To perfection! I had a 3 lb Eye of round roast. I followed cooking instructions to a tee. For the crust I used Kosher salt,garlic powder, tellicherry black peppercorns(grinded). I put them all together then pasted them around the roast. Fat side up. Thank you for the recipe and other ideas!

I wouldn't have believed this would turn out so beautifully. I, too, was disappointed that the meat is no longer hot by the time it's done, but I served it with piping hot gravy to counteract the temperature - very good, and very easy!

Had a hankering for comfort food tonight.  Aside from prime rib, I haven't had good roast beef like mom/grandma made in decades.  Found and tried this recipe and YUM!  Used salt, pepper and minced garlic as well as a little olive oil.  Cut it thin and it was tasty and tender.  Perfect with mashed potatos, gravy (had to use package since no drippings) and green beans.  Good enough to serve to guests!

I made this today for the first time.  It turned out perfectly.  It is definitely a keeper.  The meet was rare and juicy.  I brushed with olive oil and seasoned with grill seasoning and garlic powder before baking.  I will make again.

I wouldn't have tried it except I read the reviews that said it worked and it was delicious. It worked and it was delicious, so I thought I'd add my voice to convince someone who is thinking about trying this method of cooking a roast. Go ahead and enjoy!

I am writing this as my roast has just been cut and I am ready for my guests. I would never have believed it could be this great if I hadn't tried it myself.  I did add my own seasoning to the roast and I cooked it at 9 minutes per pound.  I sliced it thinly and put it in a tray ready to be heated when the guest arrive and I make some mushrooms and put them over the top.  It looks awesome and the roast was not tough at all...Great recipe.  This will be my way of making eye of round year after year....
Thanks for sharing this recipe.

We were highly skeptical about the recipe but we tried it with a 5.2 lb roast.  We were shocked.  It came out exactly perfect, lovely pink swirl in the middle, tender, juicy, and wonderful.  We never had a roast come out like that.  The temp was 140 when it came out.  This recipe is a winner.  We still are surprised it worked but it really does.  This is an absolute winner and you can't go wrong.  Just suspend your disbelief and do it and you will be pleased with the results.  BTW, the photo does not do the meat justice...ours came out just as wonderful as could be.  A little hot gravy on the side and there you have it.

2 day marinade and 500 degree roast and wait - too chewy for me. I do not usually buy this cut, but I thought I would give it one try.

I ended up taking the largely uneaten roast and slow cooking it into a beef barley soup. It was good in that!

I bought 2 of these Eye Round Roasts without knowing that it was such a tough cut.  The first one I made turned out absolutely awful, had to feed it to the dog.  Then for the second one, I tried this recipe, and let me tell you, it turned out so moist and tender!  Thanks very much for the tip.

Perfect!  For a relatively tough cut of meat, this method of roasting really does the trick.  I bought a package of two eye of rounds from Costco totaling nearly 4 lbs. (I'm feeding six people).  I crusted them both with kosher salt and cracked pepper and roasted them in a 9x13 baking stone (no roasting rack) for 9 minutes a pound since we don't want it screaming when we cut into it.  The oven was on for 35 minutes, then off for 2 hours.  It was perfect doneness for us, still warm, and tender and moist. I used some of the meat drippings for the Simple Beef Gravy recipe also on this site.  Served with mashed potatoes and green bean casserole, it was a perfect dinner and all six of us loved it! I've used a similar method for a standing rib roast so this method did not seem odd to me and I expected good results.  This is a keeper and going into my recipe box.  Thanks Lyn B!

Edible. I started by heating the oven to 500 and then waited a good 20 min to let the oven walls heat up, as another reviewer suggested. I brushed the roast with olive oil and sprinkled on meat tenderizer and Montreal steak seasoning. My roast was 1.8 lbs so roasted at 475 for 14 min. Shut the oven off for about 2 hours. I let it stand briefly before carving, but it was already quite cold. It looked beautiful and when sliced thin, was pretty tasty, but it was freakin' cold!!! My oven is not super new, but it's not an oldy moldy either...I would say 7-9 yrs old maybe. We live in Minnesota so it's still pretty cool here this time of year and I want  HOT roast beef. We put it back in the oven (sliced) at 300 for about 5 minutes, which heated it up a bit, but then it was too tough. I was amazed it worked as well as it did (I had a back up plan of brats, just in case and although we didn't have to resort to that, it was not a great meal for us). IF I ever decide to try again, I would definitely do as other reviewers suggested and turn the oven off for maybe 1-1.5 hrs, then turn it back on at a low temp for a while. My roast had a pop up timer and not surprisingly it never popped, kinda gave me the creeps but we ate it anyway and so far we're not sick. All in all, nice idea, needs work in my opinion. Maybe my oven just sucks worse than I thought!

We followed this recipe exactly and after 1 1/2 hours, i decided to check on the roast because the oven did not feel even slightly warm and I figured any cooking it would've done should be done by now (obviously meat doesn't cook in a cold oven). I am so glad I did check. The roast was still cold and raw. So, luckily, we were still able to save dinner. I will not be trying this method again.

Great recipe for a tough cut of beef. Used Montreal Steak Seasoning, adjusted cooking time slightly for a 2.5 lb. roast (17 min on high) came out perfectly pink, juicy and tender. Nice drippings for gravy. My husband said he couldn't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch the next day! Would definitely cook again.

Couldn't have been simpler.  Rolled it in Montreal steak seasoning.  Perfectly cooked and tender.  Enough juice to make excellent gravy. Wonderful leftovers for open faced roast beef sandwiches the next day....Great stuff!

Great recipe for a tough-to-handle cut of meat. Luckily I read the reviews that discussed the difference in cook time for gas ovens! For gas ovens, preheat to 500, lower to 475 and cook 7 min/lb, then lower to 180 for 20min/lb. Turn oven off and let sit an additional 40 min. This recipe has never failed me!  I also make a paste of canola oil and pepper, garlic salt, onion powder, and Nature's Seasons and rub on the outside before it goes in the oven. Absolutely delicious!  (If you have leftovers, they make a great Philly Cheesesteak!)

Simple, elegant and best of all, fool proof. If you follow the directions exactly, you will get a very nicely cooked roast. Exactly 7 minutes per pound on the first stage and you're set.
I made mine with a 3.5lb eye of round. I liberally salted it, sprinkled some rosemary, thyme and a little Montreal steak seasoning. I let mine rest for going on three hours, and it literally came out of the oven at 140degrees. I let rest for about 10 minutes, tented under foil, and sliced about 1/4" thick.
Word of note, because somebody is going to need to hear this.... Use a SHARP knife when slicing. If you don't you're going to think the meat is really tough, and it's not. The outside is a little crusty and dried due to the cooking method. Just so you know.
This recipe goes in the rotation, which is about as good a praise as I can give.

I chopped up potatoes and carrots and put them in with the roast, not sure how it would turn out. I got back (starving) from the gym 21/2 hours later to an unbelievable dinner! My boyfriend was delighted as his only job was to turn off the oven (and clean the kitchen hehe). This recipe goes in my cookbook. Foolproof!

Used a 2.3 pound roast. Altered the seasoning for a spicy kick. (Red pepper flakes, paprika, cayane pepper, black pepper, garlic cloves ). 

I left in oven for 1:45 minutes. 

The most juices roast !!

It was amazing. I let the oven preheat to 500 fpr 20 minutes, and then rubbed my roast with steak seasoning all over. It was perfectly pink inside, and seared on the outside to perfection.

I've been using the crock pot to cook this tough cut of meat but I'll be using this as my go to now.

this recipe turned my 4$ piece of meat into prime rib!  No kidding. I even forgot to turn the oven down when I put the meat in, but it was perfect!    Before it went in I rubbed it with Worcestershire sauce, garlic and Montreal steak blend. Fabulous- looks just like that photo!!

We have an older gas oven, so, in light of the difficulties some reviewers had keeping their gas ovens from cooling down too quickly, I thought of ways to retain heat. I used my trusty cast-iron skillet instead of a roasting pan.  I put a "rack" of potato wedges, onion wedges & carrots in the skillet. I placed a "poor man's pizza stone"(6 unglazed terra cotta tiles) on the oven racks.  And, after the initial 18 minutes for our 2.6 lb. eye of round, I turned the oven to its lowest setting, 170 degrees, and left it alone for 2 1/2 hours, not expecting anything like the rave reviews I read.  It is the juiciest, most tender roast ever!  Crusty & well-seasoned on the outside, moist & just-right-pink on the inside.  My husband sliced very thin slices, and we had it on challah rolls (it's a chilly Passover/Easter week).  Thank you, Lyn!  Your technique is amazing!

Easiest Fool Proof Beef I have ever made. I followed the recipe exact  except I did add garlic to the roast along with the salt and pepper. My oven is old and not 100% accurate so I preheated to 500 and left it there for 20 minutes to make sure the oven was nice and hot, then I set the oven to 475 as directed and cooked my 2lbs eye of the round for 17 minutes, shut the oven off and left it for 2 hours. I let it sit for 15 minutes before I cut it. Perfection, my husband raved over it.

I thought it was very tender but you have to watch how long you leave it in the oven. It cooked faster then advertised. I am glad I hooked up a meat thermometer so I could keep an eye on it.

5 stars for ease and tenderness! :D I had a 2 lb roast and no clue how to cook it. Thank you for this great recipe. I added some liquid smoke to the salt and pepper for seasoning, roasted in 475F gas oven for 14 minutes and then at 200F for 90 minutes. Very tender, medium cooked roast. Thanks again!

I made this last night and it was amazing!  I only had a 2.3 lb roast so I cooked it at 475 for 15 minutes and then turned the oven down to warm for the 2 hours. It was the most moist roast I have ever made!

Everyone loved it!!  I have a gas oven, so after the initial 7 minutes per pound cooking time, I turned the oven down to 175 degrees and cooked for another 20 minutes per pound.  The temperature was exactly 145 degrees when I removed it from the oven.  After letting it sit for an additional 20 minutes, I sliced it very thinly and served with horseradish sauce.  The meat was medium rare, tender, and delicious.  Will definitely serve again!!

I've tried this recipe several times with different cuts/qualities of meat and there is a small "miss" percentage. Sometimes the meat is just not moist enough to withstand the high initial temp and it dries out. But since I've started brining the meat for at least 3 - 4 hours (in frig)before baking (overnight is ideal)it's a home run every time.. Regardless of meat quality.. The brine solution allows the meat to absorb more water and the salt tenderizes/flavors the meat.   A few added tips.. Make sure the meat is covered completely by the brine solution. Take roast out of the frig and let stand for 30 minutes before cooking to bring to room temp. The meat will cook much more evenly... I also coat the meat with EVOO and a beef dry rub before cooking. I prep the roast as soon as I remove it from the frig. The EVOO & spices have a chance to absorb into the meat while it stands for 30 minutes. Actually - I'm cooking one for dinner tonight! Can't wait! :)

I was truly amazed that this turned out as well as it did! It was perfect, done just the way my family likes it. However, I have a question, once you take it out of the now cold oven - do you just warm it in the micro-wave? I did that, but I was so afraid it would no longer be as moist. Any suggestions?

I was absolutely amazed how perfect this turned out.  I had a 2 1/4 pound eye of round, let it come to room temperature for 1/2 hour while oven came to temp.  I sesoned the meat with olive oil and Montreal seasoning and followed the instructions to the t. I let it rest for 20 minutes when I pulled it from the oven and couldn't believe it when I sliced into it and it was PERFECT! Thank you this will be the only way I cook roasts from now on.

Love this roast!  Great flavour & great way to cook a tougher cut of meat! Super easy to make, cooking time is spot on - coated outside of roast with lots of salt & pepper (added a little Montreal steak spice as other reviewer suggested. Have made quite a few times - always turns out excellent.

As a life long lover of eye round, this is the best I've had.  You may want to tweak your temp and time a tiny bit depending on your oven and how rare you like it.  Be sure to salt the outside generously prior to cooking. I even use a little Montreal steak seasoning. Game changer!

Ok......I read just about EVERY SINGLE review....yea, I was bored at work....I tried this with a Top Round roast.....I preheated at 500, put it in the oven and left it at 500 for 29 minutes (my oven was pretty clean but it still gets smoky in the house)....my roast was about 3.3 lbs.  I have a gas stove, so I took that in account and left it at 200 for 90 minutes and I must say.....I am VERYYYYYYY full right now!  My roast was awesome!!!!  I posted a picture if you care to look.  I don't like blood red rare, so mine is more of a med to med-rare, but it was very tasty!  I'm going to try it next time with a more expensive cut.  My 13 year old is very happy!  He might not eat again  for a whole 2 hours now!

Yahoo!  I love this recipe... not that I'm lazy... just love a perfectly cooked and tender roast!  I cut slits and placed garlic sprears, randomly.  I seasoned with black pepper and garlic powder!  Such a fail-safe/ go to recipe!

I cook all my roasts like this now.  I season the roast with salt, pepper, montreal steak seasoning and garlic powder.  I also surround the roast with quartered red potatoes and sliced carrots (potatoes and carrots coated with olive oil and italian seasoning), everything cooks at the same time with this method and it's awesome!

This recipe is amazing. I just made it for Easter to go along with a pasta dish. My son and I are on a diet so we couldn't eat the pasta. I decided to try this roast. I was really nervous about turning the oven off after 28 minutes but I just trusted all the people here and went for it! I made a four pound roast so I followed the 7 minutes a pound at 475 degrees and then turned the oven off for two and a half hours. The big reveal was that the roast was pink in the center and very juicy..My son took a piece that I sliced and said it was so delicious and tender. It was! This will be my go to recipe..It was so easy!

This recipe deserves every good thing that has ever been said about it.  I followed the suggestion to pre-heat the oven to 500 and then wait 20 minutes before putting the roast in (then reducing to 475).  Otherwise I did not deviate from the instructions one bit and it was outstanding.  I had a round roast that weighed exactly 3 pounds so I was feeling pretty lucky when I landed on this recipe.  My husband got nervous when he looked over at the oven and it was on 500; I explained the recipe and then he got nervous again when I turned the oven off.  At one point he even walked over, turned the oven back on and said, "just to be safe."  I think I shouted out "NO!" and he quickly turned it back off. :D 

When we finished dinner he said, "I believe that is the best roast I've ever had."  It was SO delicious.  Any leftover meat can be used to make a knockout roast beef hash too.

Raw meat is what was put in the oven and after 3 hours...raw meat is what came out. The roast would not even register a temperature on my meat thermometer. I followed directions exactly. I have an electric oven which tends to run a little hot when baking, so I was surprised (and hungry)when the 2.14 lb roast was uncooked. Considering that the roast was smaller than the 3 lbs described in the recipe, if anything I expected it to be a bit over done, not raw.

Absolutely awesome!!! 
I was a little skeptical, but tried it anyways, and resisted my urge to make changes to the recipe.  I cooked a 7lb roast, cooked it for 39 minutes, and let it sit for 2.5 hours.  Was perfect, and the gravy was fantastic.  Pretty happy about it, as I had guests for dinner & it was devine!  Thank you for the great recipe!!!! ** (My oven is a gas convection.)

This is the easiest roast beef recipe I have ever tried.  Juicy, cooked to perfection.  I roasted 5 lb. roast for 35 minutes, followed the directions to the letter.  The small end of the roast was medium well, center medium rare (pink), perfect.  Temperature gauge read 135-140.  The outside crust held the juices in the roast.  Gravy made with unsalted broth, thinly sliced onions, wine, pepper (a dash of salt).  Tasted like the best restaurant offering.  Everyone present asked me for this recipe.  Thank you, Lyn.

Excellent and super tender. Never had a eye round roast so tender like this before (love my mom, but growing up hers where always tough on the ends and raw in the middle)! 

Made some modifications… Used a 3lb roast, cut into half since it wasn’t defrosting fast enough. Coated the halves with olive oil, Goya all purpose seasoning, onion powder. I also let the meat come to room temp in insure even cooking. Preheated the oven to 500* (let the oven sit 20 mins after it was ready). Put in roasting pan and put it in the oven (with a meat thermo) and let it cook at 500* for 10 mins. Dropped the heat down to 170 then took it out then the thermo said 135; about 35 mins or so. It rested for 25 mins and it was the perfect, juiciest medium rare!

This receipt is absolutely the best.  Follow the instructions and you will be guaranteed a perfectly done roast that  you can cut with a fork.  I've done 2 pound, 3 pound, 5 pound and it never has failed me yet!

No kidding...this is, by far, the best way to roast a eye of round. The slices were moist, a perfect medium and delicious. A real money saver as well. Thank you!!

Didn't work for me though followed directions exactly. Am aware though that my oven is "slow". Nice outside and inside is plenty juicy. Finishing it with some heat, it won't take much. Will try again but will probably keep a little heat (200) on it.

Start with this first and you will have plenty of time to prepare everything else for the dinner.  It was absolutely delicious.  I was tempted to open the oven but I waited.  The roast was so tender I couldn't believe it. Five stars here!

I loved this roast!! It is an inexpensive meat and I purchase it often, usually with disappointing results. This recipe sure did produce a delicious and tender meal. The only thing I noticed was that when I pulled the meat out of the oven after the 2.5 hrs it was sitting in the warmed oven it was not hot. I turned the oven on to 500o again for about 15 mins to warm it all the way through again just before serving. The simplicity of the salt and pepper rub made it easy to pair with any side dish or salad. We will use the recipe again for sure!!

I'm a a single old guy and not good in the kitchen.  Never got raosts because I never knew how long to cook them.  I bought an eye of round roast because it was on its last "sell by" date and was dirt cheap.  Stumbled upon this recipe and it was perfect.  Now I buy roasts even if I have to pay full price!

This roast was delicious and a nice change from a slow cooked roast. Just a few tips for those of you who do not have a brand new oven. I'm a student and my oven, although electric is about 15 years old. The problem with it is that a lot of the oven heat rises through the burners, so I lost a lot of heat during the time when the oven was off. Therefore, if you don't have the newest of ovens, keeping the oven on around 200 is a good idea to ensure it stays warm in there. The roast still turned out great just took a little adjusting and extra time. Would definitely make this again!!

BE CAREFUL ABOUT OVEN COOLING OFF.
 
My 5 year old oven has a cooling fan so when I turn the oven off it cools off pretty quickly therefore the meat did not cook.  I used a meat thermometer and turned the oven back on to 350 degrees about 1/2hour before the 2 1/2 time was finished and kept an eye on the thermometer until it reached 155 degrees (we like out meat medium). It was light pink in the center.  I will say that the meat was quite tender and I will use this method next time.  The orignal poster should revise her instructions for those of us whose oven cools off!

Okay, I was leary of this recipe but I've made it two times now and it is so delicious. It's perfectly medium rare each time. The first time I followed the recipe exactly, perfection. The second time, I inserted garlic chunks and wrapped it all up in a pound of bacon. It was PERFECT. Make sure your oven can hold the temp for the whole time; use an oven thermometer to check. Could it be that some ovens don't have enough insulation? If you see the temp dropping below 175- 200, I'd turn the oven on for a bit. Also, slice it VERY thin, this is key. Also, don't put any vegetables with it, just meat.

I was a little reluctant to try this recipe, but boy am I glad I did!  I had a five pound roast that I invested the time in to tenderize and marinade.  I first punctured it on all sides.  I then made a marinade of olive oil, soy sauce, red wine, crushed garlic, black pepper and cumin.  The meat marinated for 24 hours; I rotated the sides a few times.  

I roasted the meat for 28 minutes and then followed the recipe to a tee.  I could not believe how moist and delicious the meat was!  I will definitely try this technique with other cuts of meat.

This came out sooo good! I made the following variations- I used a 1lb eye of round roast because I was only cooking for 3 people.I rinsed it, dried it really well with paper towels then lightly oiled it&used a combination of Montreal Chicken seasoning, garlic salt, salt&a ton of black pepper to season it.I used the time recommendations that PJL4965 posted in her review only I cooked it for a 10-11 minutes at 500 degrees because I like my meat a little more medium. I left it in the oven for 20 minutes, took it out and let it rest 15minutes. I served it with homemade mac&cheese, soooo good! Next time I think I'll serve it on a sandwich with provolone cheese & au jus.

The is the worst cut of meat to attempt to roast. It comes out tender and moist but tastes horrible. Place it in a dutch oven with some carrots and potatos and let it cook for 6-8 hours until it falls apart. Roasting it will not satisfy anyone who enjoys a well cooked pieceof beef.

Tried this tonight and WOW!! is all I can say.  I have a 13 year old that is a picky eater and I actually got him to try it and much to my suprise he liked it and said he would eat it.  This was probably the best roast that has ever been made at my house by anyone.  Great recipe!

Thanks!!

I almost never comment on anything over the internet but I just could not help my self on this recipe! It is amazing I have used it twice already and both times my roasts were delicious! The second time I used this recipe on a petite sirloin roast and it was so tender it melted in our mouths! My husband raved for days about it! You can use this for any type of roast.Once my oven preheated to 500 I waited an extra 20 minutes before I put my meat in and then cooked it accordingly to the pound of my roast. I brushed my roast lightly with olive oil sprinkled salt and pepper over it and stuffed it with pieces of garlic and let it sit for 4 hours! I highly recommend this recipe!

Awesome!  I made this after a day of housepainting and it was wonderful to have a great dinner with so little work.  I did use a little meat tenderizer instead of salt and cooked 9 minutes per pound, as someone previously suggested, because the hubby doesn't like rare meat.  Still, it had a nice light pink middle, was juicy and delicious!  Served it with sauteed baby portobellos and tomato slices - what could be easier?

I will use this over and over! So good!!! My rub: 1 tsp. salt. 1/2 tsp ground pepper. 1 tbs. herb blend (I use a grilling mix with rosemary, sage, thyme and more) , two dashes of cayenne. 1 tsp. of garlic powder. Using mortar and pestle, grind all ingredients into powder.

AMAZING, quick, easy, delicious.  So many things you can do with this, put it in the oven, put timer on and leave...no fear of leaving oven on.  We have done it many ways - love it on crusty warm rolls with horseradish, au jus and swiss.  I wish I could cook more meat this way!  if I can, please someone let me know.

Purchased a 1.5 lb. eye of round roast (on sale for $4.60) so no big loss if this recipe didn't work. What happened was what I have been trying to achieve for years.... how to get a tough piece of meat to taste so tender and delicious! There were just enough pan drippings to make a nice gravy, too!

This is the best techique for roasting eye of round ever!  I use it everytime and change up the seasonings to match my mood.  Thanks a bunch for this one.  I have used it now for over a year and thought it was time to show some love.

This turned out like SHOE LEATHER.  I will return to cooking this the traditional way.  Braising is so much better.  So sorry to have ruined a nice cut of inexpensive meat that is flawless to normally cook.

NOTE: If you have a newer premium oven with a cool down fan, this recipe may not work. An older, heavier, good old American-made electric oven works best.

I first rated this recipe on 3/17/10.  While the roast was good it was absolutely overcooked. It was not juicy or pink inside.  I have since purchased a thermometer that you can put in the roast and close the oven on the wire that connects to the temperature screen you sit on the counter.  I HIGHLY recommend one of these thermometers for this recipe. I cooked the roast as directed then set the internal temp to 145*.  My roast was finished in one hour!  My oven apparently holds heat very well and my roast would have been over cooked if I let it go another hour and 30 minutes.  I spent about $10.00 on the thermometer and it already paid for itself! The roast was perfect!  I wouldn't hesitate to do this again.

This did not work for me.  I followed the directions exactly and the roast and oven were ice cold.  The roast was medium rare - a little too rare - and it was very chewy/tough.  The internal temp of the roast was only 110.  I will never use this method again but will go back to my tried and true method for this type of beef even if it's more work.  I have a 5 year old gas oven.

Excellent recipe just like the Fool-Proof Prime Rib which we had for Xmas Eve came superb. Only thing I would take from that recipe and add to this is after you let the roast sit in oven UNOPENED for 2 1/2 hours turn the oven back on to 350 without taking roast out leave in there for additional 20-30 mins depending on how you liike your meat

THIS DID NOT WORK.  EYE OF ROUND 2.78 LBS.  FOLLOWED THE DIRECTIONS TO A TEE.  AFTER THE 2 1/2 HOURS THE INTERNAL TEMPERATURE WAS 105 AND DROPPING.  DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW IT WORKED FOR OTHER PEOPLE.  MY OVEN IS NOT OLD AND IS ACCURATE.  DON'T KNOW WHATELSE TO TELL YOU.

I have made many eye round roasts, and this by far was the easiest and best tasting.  This was my second time making it and just as good if not better than the first time.  My roast was 3.35 lbs.  I brushed on olive oil, then rubbed on meat tenderizer, seasoning salt, garlic powder, salt and pepper.  Cooked fat side up.  As the others, I preheated to 500, then turned down to 475 and cooked for 1/2 hour, then turned oven off and cooked another 2hrs.  Came out PERFECT.  VERY moist, easy to slice and not a piece left (had hoped for atleast a couple pieces to make a sandwich with tomorow).  Highly recommend to make this way.  Just make sure you DONT OPEN THE OVEN during the process.  :)

This recipe is excellent.  I have prepared prime rib in a similar manner, but did not realize it would work with a cheaper cut of meat.  My family LOVED this! Season to taste- garlic, etc, as other have suggested. Leftovers are even better!

after following directions to perfection, the roast came out of the oven barely warm and raw.  our oven is new, holds heat well... not sure what happened or how everyone else seems to get good results with this recipe, but we will never be trying this again.  the roast is currently back in the oven... and  the heat is on this time.

Outstanding, tender and perfectly cooked. I used a 3 pound eye of round roast..I put salt and pepper on it and inserted a meat thermometer as I was not sure about the method.  I cooked it as directed and let it sit for 1 1/2 hours...the thermometer said 140 so I turned the oven back on at 350 for 3 minutes just to heat the oven back up, as my oven has a fan to cool it down. It was perfect. I put the roast on a cutting board to rest and then put some water in the pan and back in the oven.  I got wonderful Au jus from the pan.

So easy & so good! I felt like I was at Sunday brunch! I used a small roast (2 pounds) and just left it in the oven until hubs got home from work. Result was not as pink as I would like, but still good. I did, however, break the cardinal rule of cooking beef: I forgot to let the meat rest once it was out of the oven. My counter got most of the juices. Lesson learned & fingers crossed that the meat is still good for roast beef sandwiches tomorrow. :D

Excellent!  Nicely browned and seared.  The doneness for ours was medium rare.  The meat doesn't come out of the oven 'hot-hot'...just 'warm.'  However that's typical for slowly cooked meats (like prime rib served in restaurants; never really hot) which aren't prepared in a slowcooker or simmered stovetop. Anyway...tender, juicy and I was very, very surprised by this inexpensive cut of meat ($1.88/# on sale) turning into a restaurant quality entree' (seriously)!  I used a 2.3# beef round roast sprinkled with coarse salt, coarsely ground black pepper, garlic powder, then placed in cast iron dutch oven (uncovered).  Turned-off oven after 20 minutes, and removed pot 2.5 hours later.  I'd wanted roast beef for French dip sandwiches, but after seeing/tasting the result---decided a roast beef dinner was more 'fitting' *laff*  It was also great not having a pot simmering on the stove, or a pan in the oven, heating-up the kitchen during warm months/season ;^)

This recipe was great! I didn't know how big my roast was, so I left the oven on for 30 minutes. It was just slightly pink. I used a steak seasoning I had in my spice cupboard, instead of salt and pepper. I used a chuck roast, so it was a little tough, but the flavor was great. I'll be sure to use eye of round next time. I made a sandwich for lunch today. I added swiss cheese and horsradish sauce. Yum!

I've made this twice.  Once exactly as the recipe states and the second time following the recommendations of ssteinerX.  First time was great, second time was EXCEPTIONAL!  My husband loves roast beef and stated at least 5 times "this is the best meal you have ever made!"  (I made this with Traditional Mashed Potatoes" from this site) Definitely try this cooking method.  Tender, moist, delicious eye roast.  note: I added thinly sliced garlic into the roast.

I had previously rated this a 5 star,  because it is very good.  However I have found it to be  inconsistent.  I have made this 4 or 5 times now and never as good as the first time. I think if your roast is 3 pounds but long and skinny you need to cut down the time in the oven. Anyway,  be careful because it can easily become dry and over cooked.  Still very good when it turns out right.

Yes, it's done, but it's cold. It's an OK way to use a not-very-tender cut of beef.

This came out perfect.  I actually forgot to turn the temperature down and the roast was still pink and very tender.If your roast does not have alot of fat you can trim the fat off of a few pieces of bacon and lay the strips across the top.  I will definitely make this again.

I did as another review suggested & roasted at 500 degrees for 7 minutes per pound, then turned oven OFF and kept roast in UNOPENED oven for 20 minutes per pound.  Delicious!!!  Will work this into my regular rotation.  Easy way to have "steak" for dinner for 5 people on the cheap!

I gotta say... I rely on this web site so often... not just for the great recipes but for the people who comment and revise the recipes. Thank youuuu!  I did a 2.11 lb eye of round roast tonight -- preheat to 500, turn down to 475, cook for 15 mins, turn down to 250, cook another hour (about). I have a probe thermometer that I can set to sound the alarm at a certain temp... I set it to 160, but should have set it to 155 since it was less pink than I like when it was done. I put a LOT of cajun spices on the top and sides and a fair amount of salt, based on what I read here... was too salty so I learned something. Despite that, it was wonderful, moist, tasty and went great with potatoes and broccoli. I'm looking forward to a RB sandwich tomorrow. Thanks, All Recipes community!

This was very good! I would cook it a little longer per pound, since I like my roast cooked a little more than medium rare.  Otherwise I loved it.  I don't do the cooking, but I tried this and will definitely make it again.  It is a little cold when it comes out of the oven so it will need to be heated, I think.

I have always used moist cooking for tougher cuts of meat. I came across this recipe in searching for a different way to cook an eye of round roast, and decided to try it tonight because of the positive review. 

I made a 1 1/2 pound roast because there are only two of us. I injected it with an herb and garlic injectible marinade and seasoned it with Kansas City Style steak seasoning, Canadian steak seasoning, garlic salt, and a little Cajun seasoning. With the seasonings, I used, it looked pepper crusted. I preheated the oven to 500, turned it down to 475 and cooked the roast for 14 minutes on a cast iron roasting pan. I wasn't sure how long my oven would hold heat, so I reduced the temperature to 180 degrees and cooked the roast for 2 1/2 hours. 

The roast turned out absolutely wonderful. It was full of flavor and very tender, not to mention so easy to prepare. I'm looking forward to trying this cooking method for the next london broil I make.

I made this tonight with a 2.78 lb eye of round roast.  I followed the directions exactly.  My roast went into a 500 degree oven at 4:04.  I then reduced to 475 for 19 minutes turned the oven off and it was at 140 degrees at 5:30!  I know, I know, thank god I had a thermometer in the meat or we would have had shoe leather for dinner.  I was shocked and my dinner timing was off.  I have a brand new oven that must hold heat really well.  My advice to folks who got a roast over cooked or undercooked get yourself a meat thermometer.  My other tip is to over season your roast like it is going to be over seasoned.  I put what I thought was a lot of seasoning, but the roast could have taken a lot more of salt, pepper and garlic powder.  I will make this again because it is easy, but I will gauge my time better.  Thanks for sharing.

My first time making a roast and it was a big success - it even works with an older electic stove. To prep, I rubbed the roast with olive oil and a little kosher salt, and pepper, stuffing minced garlic in about 10 holes throughout the roast. I placed the roast and about 1 cup of water in the bottom of a shallow casserole dish and after preheating to 500 for at least 15 minutes, I cooked my 2.6 lb roast fat side up for 22 minutes at 475.  Then, as directed, turned off the over and hoped that my 10 year old oven would do the trick.  After 2hrs and 15 minutes, I pulled it out, foil tented it, and let it rest for another 15 minutes. I then removed the roast from the dish, placed the dish on the stove on medium, and made gravy with the drippings by adding a little more flour and water and heating gently for about 10 minutes on the stove.  Sliced very thin and served with the gravy and potatoes and broccoli.  Perfect.  Thanks.

I read the recipe and didn't think it was possible...even with all the great reviews. Then I tried it. Wow. I don't know how it works, but it works. It took a cheap, tough cut of meat and turned it into some of the tastiest beef I've had in ages. I like mine rare, so cooked it  for 6 minutes per pound and took it out after about 2 hours. Perfect. Juicy. Tender. Warm. Got raves from the people I served it to. Thanks for a keeper.

WOW!  This turned out fantastic, i never thought to cook a roast beef this way.  The only thing that i had a hard time with the roast smoking up my house!  I think it may have been the lack of liquid.  And next time, i am determinately using a disposable pan or lining my pan with tinfoil, this made such a mess on my dish that i don't think i will ever get it clean.   It sure was a yummy roast though, usually, unless i cook the roast til it is falling apart, my roast is tough.  :) Not now!

Wow I was so surprised at this dish.  I did it exactly the way the recipe read and was impressed with a perfectly medium cooked meat.  However I pulledi t out about a 1/2 hour early and it was cooked perfect but it was a little cold.  I hate to nuke the meat but maybe my stove doesn't stay as hot for long.  I think next time I will take it out even earlier so it is hotter.

I'm giving it three starts because the timing didn't really work for me, although the flavor was good, we only tasted a slice or two of it last night and I'm going to try to slice it very thin today. It was a 2.5 lb. roast, so I cut the 2 1/2 hour standing time in the shut off oven down to about two hours. It was like totally rare in the center. So, I put it back in for around thirty minutes with the oven on at 300, then turned it off for another thirty minutes. It was much better. I used the seasoning from another reviewer with the ground up raisins, etc., that was pretty nice, i added a spash of olive oil to the mix.

Rarely do I feel motivated to write a review, but this has to be the exception.  I have cooked dozens of roasts and none ever came out like this.  It was perfectly pink on the inside, juicy and delightful.  I will never cook another roast any other way!!!

Absolutely EXCELLENT !  I fixed this for Christmas dinner yesterday, and heard nothing but raves from the family.  My roast was just under 4.5 lbs, and I followed the directions exactly; cooking at 475 for 31 minutes, and then turning off the oven for the last 2 1/2 hrs.  I had seasoned the roast with salt, pepper, and rubbed about 3 tsp. of horseradish over the entire roast.  A spectacular hit, and everyone's looking forward to leftovers this evening.

This was delicious; the flavor can't be beat!
I had a 4 pound roast, though, and cooked it for 28 minutes, then let sit in the over for 2 1/2 hours.  Since this (The sitting time) is the instructions for a 3 pounder, I thought mine would be good and pink, which is how I like it. Instead, it was very dry, and brown throughout.  Next time I will definitely use a probe or adjust the cooking time. As I said, though, the flavor of the meat was wonderful, there were enough pan drippings for a yummy gravy, and the middle pieces had some juice to them. 
I seasoned with kosher salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder.

Just made this for the first time. It was great. Perfectly done on the inside. My roast was the narrower end of a 6-lb. roast. I made sure that it was still cold when I put it in the oven and adjusted the cook time slightly because it was just under 3 lbs. The roast was perfect medium rare (just like the picture above) and very juicy. We sliced it thin. It wasn't tenderloin tender, but it was not tough by any means. And the juiciness made up for any chewiness. I'll def make this recipe again. Great recipe. Thanks.

A 2.5 eye round turned out perfectly. Try this.  You will not be disappointed.  I'll never buy deli roast beef again.  Salt, pepper, and garlic powder did the trick wonderfully.  The true test?  My dog sits patiently waiting for a slice to "fall off" the carving board. Deli roast beef?  He won't eat it.  (What does he know that I don't?)

Perfection! I've been cooking for more than 40 years and this is the first time I've had an eye of round roast turn out perfectly! Believe me I've tried every method. But this is great! I followed the directions to a T, setting the timer to turn the oven off at exactly the right time (7 minutes per pound). I didn't peek. And what did I get? Fancy steakhouse quality beef! You would have bet it was prime rib! Thank you so much for this recipe.

I use to cook eye rounds all the time and they were always like shoe leather, so then I would throw the left overs in the crock pot all day. Then I finally looked up another way to cook eye rounds and found these type of recipes and have been cooking them like this ever since. I WILL NEVER EVER COOK AN EYE ROUND ANY OTHER WAY. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS.

We made this last night followed the recipe to a T. I even was baking cookies all day and had oven at 500f for 30 mins, to make sure it was good and hot, before I put roast in. When I took it out after sitting for 2.5 hours it was pretty much raw in the middle. Had to put back into the oven and roast it for an other hour and half.

I agree with most of the other comments.  This roast came out perfectly - medium rare, moist and melts in your mouth.  This will be my go to roast beef recipe from here on out.  I get my meats from my local farm so it's a little more expensive than going to the market (but worth it as it's all pasture raised and delicious)! Now with this recipe I can skip the more expensive cuts and enjoy outstanding roast beef with the eye of the round. Amazing!

I prepared exactly as written. Used a meat thermometer that I could monitor from outside the oven. I have a 37 year old Hotpoint electric oven. Thermometer read 145 degrees one full hour early!!I pulled the roast, let it rest, and it is beautifully cooked. Thin warm slices slathered with horseradish mayo are yummy and easy to chew!Just glad I monitored. Apparently my oven really stays hot even when turned off!

I left my 3.3 lb eye of round roast out on the counter for an hour to come to room temp, then brushed lightly with gravy master liquid, let it soak in a bit, then blotted with paper towel so it wouldn't overpower and would still crisp up on the outside. Like others, I used extra seasoning (s&p, onion powder, garlic powder, celery salt, paprika powder), set my gas oven for 500, put the roast on a rack in a roasting pan, reduced the heat to 475 for 23 minutes, then reduced the temp to 180, for an hour. I checked after that first hour and my instant read thermometer was just above 130, exactly where I wanted it (we like rare beef, but not bloody). I took it out and let it rest under foil for around an hour. It was a perfect pink throughout, and crispy on the outside! I also used the "Beef Au Jus" recipe (slightly tweaked) from this site. Delicious!

This is the ONLY way I make roast beef, and not just eye of round roast, it works on ANY cut of beef roast.  Just follow times/temperatures indicated and you will have perfect medium to medium rare roasts every time.

Awful sorry to say. I had a 2.5 roast and cooked it 17 minutes.  And took it out of the oven after 2 hours with the oven door closed and it was awful.  Over cooked and dry.

I tried this recipe on Sat 16 Aug. /14 it turned out perfect, I only had a 1 kg roast {a little over 2 lb.} I cook it exactly as the recipe said. I used salt and pepper and garlic salt. I was wondering if this would work for other kinds of roast, I am going to try a sirloin tip roast. As I am from Ontario Canada, North Bay, as are hydro cost are so hi I think this is a very economical way to cook a roast. By the way I for got mention the roast was very tender. Try it you will love it

This is absolutely the easiest recipe and the best part is the roast beef is perfect every time! I made this as the first roast beef I ever made and it was delicious. Even my toughest critic (not my child, my mother! Lol) said it was "...absolutely delicious. You must make it for me again."  That is high marks in my world. In fact it has been several months since I made that first one and I've made it a couple-3 times since....in fact I have one in the oven now. Thank you to Lyn B. for this fool-proof method for cooking a roast.

Delicious!  The success of this cooking method will depend upon how accurate the temperature of your oven is and how well your oven retains heat.  Adjust cooking time +/- according to your individual oven.  If you have a very old oven that is not well insulated, this recipe may not work for you, as heat retention/residual heat is IMPORTANT to the success of this recipe.  In addition, the meat MUST be completely THAWED and at ROOM TEMPERATURE, inside and out, before going in the oven.  Hope this helps!

I have made this recipe several times now. It is AMAZING. Roll the roast very lightly in olive oil then load it up with seasoning salt--a lot of it cooks off, so you'll have it right just when you think you're starting to overdo it. Let your oven heat for an extra twenty minutes once it has 'preheated.' Seven minutes per pound first, then fifty minutes per pound once you turn off the oven. One you have taken it out, let it rest for ten minutes before cutting or serving.

Tried this recipe tonight after reading a number of reviews and loved it! Taking the advice of several reviewers, I left the fat on, rinsed and dried the meat, brushed the exterior with Gravy Master, then seasoned with salt, fresh ground pepper and garlic powder. Baked uncovered fat side up on a grill in a roasting pan at 500 degrees for 24 minutes for a three pound eye roast, then turned oven off for 2-1/2 hours. When I opened the oven afterward, it was cold (as mentioned by another reviewer, I don't think gas ovens hold the heat as well).  I made a judgment call and put it back in the oven for 20 minutes on 350 degrees.  Took out and let rest for another 20 minutes, then sliced to a beautiful assortment of medium and medium well done (more pink slices than red).   I and my guests enjoyed it tremendously, taking seconds as well. I cannot believe the ease of cooking this way. I added water to a small amount of drippings to make a small amount of gravy.  Can't wait to make it again now that I know it really works.  The finished product looked like a professional chef cooked it.

Great Recipe!! I use it more of as a guideline i heat my oven to 550 instead of 500 and i season with Lawrys season salt, garlic powder and black pepper then put it in a ziplock over night. Other then that i follow the directions as stated. Made it several times and always have trouble getting it to the dinner table without everyone eating it up first.

I tried this recipe three months ago and the results were INCREDIBLE.  Never have we had such a delicious roast.  I coat mine with salt, pepper, a bit of thyme, marjoram, onion powder, garlic and cumin.  It sits overnight then I take it out to reach room temperature.  From there on, I follow the instructions to the letter.  It ALWAYS works, is ALWAYS perfect and we now make it for guests.

Was so skeptical to try this, but SO glad I did!  I always swore in the past that I would never buy an eye round roast again - just cannot believe the fantastic flavor and how tender this turned out!

One word; Awesome. I didnt believe the meat would still cook in a cold oven just sitting there. Boy was I wrong. The kids loved it and didnt use ketchup or A1 as they usually do. It was perfect. Pink and juicy....def will make again...!!

I was very skeptical when reading this recipe because it didn't seem right.  I read the reviews, sure that someone had a "correction" to the recipe.  I will never doubt you again Lyn B!  This was so easy and I followed the directions exactly.  The only change I made was to use Cajun spices because here in Louisiana you are required...LOL.  It was one of the easiest meals I've ever made and my husband just RAVED about it.  This one is a keeper, thanks!

Used a Gas oven with a 5 pound roast.

Rubbed roast with garlic pepper, olive oil, garlic salt, kosher salt and pepper.

475 degrees for about 30 minutes

200 degrees for about 3 hours.

Perfect medium roast!

Are you kidding!!!  I don't know about your oven but my oven starts to cool down after about 20 minutes.  After 2 1/2 hours my eye round was raw.  The oven was ice cold the way it should be when not turned on!!

Made this tonight for the very first time. I followed the tips from another review and brushed on Kitchen Bouquet, sprinkled some fresh ground sea salt and pepper, garlic powder, and I added a little onion powder. However, cooking it as directed per the recipe was far to pink for me, so I cooked for an additional 30 minutes on 450 F after it sat in the oven for the 2½ hours. It came out perfect. I served it with baked beans, green beans, and the roasted new potatoes (I added carrots too). The new potatoes recipe was on this site too. My husband said this was his favorite meal all year, and probably his new favorite. It was super easy to make, I'm not much of a cook and I think it turned out great!

We tried this and loved it.  My roast was still a little bit frozen when I put it in the oven so I let it sit for just a little longer and the center was nice and medium-rare.  Excellent recipe!

I used a 6lb roast, have a 1955 gas stove/oven which I have serviced every year to make sure it is up to par.  Oven/Stove Guy always tells me that if they made ovens/stoves the way they did back then, he would be out of business.  I wished I would have gone with my gut, but instead followed reviewers advice as far as "leaving the oven on at least 140F" for the next 2-1/2 hours because gas ovens don't retain heat. Used a bit of olive oil to coat roast then heavily seasoned with Kosher salt, pepper, fresh basil, oregano, thyme and rosemary placed in oven turned down to 475F and it smelled amazing.  I used the 7 min/lb. method (next time I will use 5min/lb. and then turn my oven off). I turned the oven down to 140F and luckily decided to check my roast after 1-1/2 hours.  The temp was already at 140F so I took out covered with foil loosely for approx. 20 min. and then began to carve. To my surprise, the roast was already medium to well done. We like rare! It still tasted/smelled AMAZING and there was a very small section of a faded pink left. Used the juice for gravy and it was AMAZING. Had a chunk of the roast left, two days later sliced it up very thin, heated AuJus to boiling, turned off, placed the thin slices in AuJus as needed and served to company. They LOVED IT Served with mashed potatoes, gravy and fresh spinach. I will definitely make again but use the 5min/lb. method and then TURN MY OVEN OFF! Apparently my oven retains heat JUST FINE! Thank YOU for this RECIPE! A++

I put a simple dry rub on the roast first, coarse salt, pepper, garlic and onion powders.  Followed the rest of the instructions and WOW, how simple, and tender, tasted like prime rib and didn't even need a knife to cut it.  Everyone was impressed!

So this is probably the dumbest thing I have ever done, but it turned out awesome! I had a moment of total dizziness and FORGOT that I was cooking a PORK roast instead of a beef roast. I did everything the recipe said and tossed that bugger in there with salt, pepper, garlic powder, a little oregano and some chili powder and cooked it at 500 for 22 minutes before shutting it off. It sat in the oven for an hour and 15 minutes and it ended up coming out AMAZING! It was the most tender pork roast I've ever made. Who knew you could cook pork at a high temp and have it come out so amazingly moist and tender? I can't wait to try this recipe with a beef roast!

Cheers!

Wow, AWESOME!! I cooked a 2 3/4lb roast for 20, then did the closed-door as written. I had a thermometer in it, and it only went up to 136, so was worried. But it was cooked PERFECT when we cut it, rare without being too rare. Lots of juice. I did make a 1 clove minced garlic/salt/pepper/1tsp olive oil paste & smeared all over prior to roasting-YUM. This is definitely the way I will cook eye round from now on. Thanks for sharing!!

Only OK.  I followed the instructions exactly and have a Jenn-aire electric oven.  It did not leave enough drippings for a gravy.  The roast was rare (bloody).  This was not nearly as good as my recipe.

Salt, pepper, and garlic powder eye of round roast.  Brown in small amount of oil.  When brown, add one can of beef broth and bake covered in a 300° oven for three hours.  The meat will be tender and will slice beautifully for sandwiches . . . and plenty of drippings for gravy.

I tried this for supper tonight, completely following the directions.  At the end of 2.5 hours the roast was not warm enough.  I'm glad I tried it during a regular week night meal, and was not serving it to guests!  

I am willing to try this technique again, but I would first marinate the roast, and I would also turn the oven back on to low during the last 30 minutes.

well I tried this and I love a rare roast but my roast just did not seem to cook.  I have a relatively new GAS oven less than 3 years old but my roast just never seemed to cook once I turned off the oven.  Should the recipe be different for GAS ovens?

Wow!  This was so easy, tender, and so delicious!  Patience is the key, and resisting the urge to open the oven door.  Like others, preheated the oven at 500 degrees for 15-20 minutes, then roasted the seasoned 3.25 lb eye of the round for 7 mins per lb (approx 21 mins).  I then turned my gas oven down to 200 degrees for about 1.5 hours.  After taking it out, me meat thermometer read just under 145 degrees. I let it sit, covered for 15 minutes, then sliced thinly with my electric knife.  It turned out medium rare, and although at first I thought it might be a tad too rare, I received tons of raves.  Very, very good!

We liked this.  I was looking for a recipe to use an eye of round roast with; I had tried the Prime Rib Roast method this way.  I did take another reviewers advice (since I was short on time) and cook at 475 for the required number of minutes, then turned my oven temp back to 200 degrees. Since we like our meat med. well to well done, I allowed the meat to cook an additional 45 minutes at the 200 degree mark (and didn't open the oven door).  This brought the roast up to 72 degrees C and it was light pink in the middle.  Next time, I will likely cook the roast an extra 15-20 minutes to have this suit our needs.  I used Montreal steak spice to season the outside of the roast and put a little olive oil and balsamic vinegar on the roast prior to putting on spices and cooking.  This created a very juicy cut of meat; we were pretty pleased with this.

A friend gave me this recipe back in the 80s and it has never failed me. There is one thing she adds that makes it even better. Take a knife and plunge it into down into the top of the roast in two places every inch or so. Then push a clove of garlic (halved lengthwise) down into this pouch into about the middle of the roast. Let the roast sit like this for an hour or so before cooking, or even overnight in the refrigerator. Remove the cloves as the finished roast is sliced.

Made this today - 4 lb roast 28 minutes in the oven and then oven off for 2.5 hrs - locked the oven door to keep the peekers away and keep heat in. It came out perfect sliced thin with beef both poured over. Used garlic salt pepper and put slits in meat and stuffed some garlic gloves in. This one is a keeper - i have been trying many roast beef recipes and all dry and too well done or rare - this was just right for all. My original post was 10/2012 and just wanted to say I only cook roast beef like this now and making today for at least the 20th time and thought I would edit my post to add that tidbit also as a lot of others have posted 90 minutes after turning off is fine and the meat is still warm to eat which is what I just did for the first time with a 5lb roast

Tried this last night and it was excellent.  I was concerned because some of the reviews said the meat was raw and cold at the end. I have a very old electric oven and had no problems. During the 21 minutes at 475 I could hear it sizzling and it smelled good already. I can't imagine how sitting in a heated oven after that it could be cold and raw!  I wonder if some of the reviewers were opening the oven to check the thermometer??

Comes out perfect every single time! I first cut some slits in the roast and put garlic cloves inside, then I make a rub with olive oil, salt, pepper, garlic and oregano. My family loves this.

I have accidently bought beef Eye of Round roasts several times. Usually no matter how I cook it, it comes out tough.

This recipe - it came out the least toughest I've ever had with this cut of beef! That being said, I had a 2.5 lb roast - cooked it for 7 mins per lb, then left it in the turned-off oven for 2 hours instead of 2.5 since it was 1/2 lb. smaller. Well, it ended up being medium-well done. Unfortunately, I like it rare to med-rare.

Next time I will try it like a previous person said: 20 mins. per lb. in turned-off oven.

I don't know what I'm doing wrong but my roast didn't cook.  After 2 1/2 hours my thermometer registered 125 degrees.  I had to turn on my oven and cook it an additional 1/2 hour at 425 so my family could eat.  I used an envelope of onion soup mix as a rub.  The gravy was awesome.

WOW! I tried this recipe last night for the first time. My whole family agrees, this is the best roast beef I have ever cooked. I followd the recipe exactly. The only change I made is I rolled the eye of round in salt to make a crust. It came out wonderful!! So tender and juicy....Thank you for a wonderful recipe. I will never cook a roast any other way.

I love this recipe.  It works every time for me.  I usually leave it in overnight and the next day for dinner we have a beautifully tender, juice roast. I usually only use a 1.5 - 2 lb roast and I season it with my regular blend.  Perfect every time.

I only had a 2 lb roast and cooked it for 20 mins because i read some reviews and most people said it came out med rare and i like mine med to med-well.  It came out so delicious i only seasoned it with salt,pepper, garlic powder and some paprika  that some suggested on a review.  7 mins a pound is so true. Everyone should try this method of cooking super easy and i don't think anyone can mess it up.   Going to give this as a recipe for a bridal shower that i have to go to this weekend.

I have tired this recipes several times and the eye round ALWAYS comes out perfect. I am not even interested in making an eye round any other way. Simple is sometimes the best. Enjoy.

This recipe for Eye Round Roast is simply AMAZING!!! It's so easy, and the result is outstanding! I tried it for the first time tonight for a small dinner party, and although I was a bit hesitant and nervous at first, all doubt was removed when my husband began slicing the roast. I breathed a sigh of relief and heated up the gravy. I highly recommend this recipe. You can't go wrong!

This is by far the easiest way to make a roast as long as you don't need your oven for a few hours!  I had my dinner timed out so that when the roast came out, I got the sides in, which were done in the amount of time for the roast to sit.  I used a combination of garlic powder, fresh ground pepper and some cajun seasoning all over the roast.  Everyone was wowed at how good it was.  I made the mistake of deciding to "sample" it to make sure it tasted okay and it melted in my mouth.  I ended up sampling about five times and dipped it in the juice that it cooked in.  I also followed another reviewers suggestion and put the fattiest side up.  It glazed beautifully.  We had leftovers because I cooked a really big roast for the amount of people eating and the leftovers were still awesome, which says a lot for a beef roast dish.  Not dry at all!

I cooked a 4 lb eye roast using this method today, but I missed a step..forgot to turn the oven down to 475 when I put the meat in.  It was more well done than usual but still very tender and tasty. Perhaps you folks who like your meet less pink might like to try  this.

Seems obvious in retrospect, but if you're cooking a smaller roast, pull it from the oven sooner than 2.5 hours.  I made a 2.5lb eye round roast using this method, and after giving it the full 2.5 hours, it was overcooked in the center (up to about 155).  Probably should have pulled it out 30-40 minutes sooner, I'm guessing.

oh yumm. I had a 4lb tip roast, turned out so yummy I like my cow still mooing. So I cooked it @475 for 7 minutes per pound then turned it down to warm (gas oven) as suggested by gas reviewers. I LOVE it cant believe it took my 29 years to figure out how to cook this!

This is the easiest roast to make and the best tasting! I love that it is pink inside and so tender! For years I have been trying  to make the perfect roast and wanted the pink center. I have tried in the crock pot, oven and oven bags. None compare to this!! I have made it for friends and family and all loved it!! Thank you for sharing.

AMAZING.  This is the best roast I've ever had.  My son doesn't care for rare beef, and I just wanted it pink in the middle.  I used seasoned salt and black pepper to coat the roast. I cooked the roast at 475 for 8 minutes per pound, then instead of turning my oven off, I just turned it down to 200 degrees.  It's the most juicy, tender roast I've ever had...done to perfection.

This is literally the first time I've ever taken the time to write a review, but after making this today, I felt compelled to do so.  I followed the recipe almost exactly (only difference was I added garlic powder and onion powder).  I like medium-rare and if you follow this recipe, you will end up with well done.  The flavor is wonderful, but would have been even better had I not cooked it so long.  My piece of meat was 2 1/2 lbs, I started by cooking the suggested 7 minutes per pound (cooked mine 18 minutes) and then turned off the oven.  I actually took the roast out after 2 hours, not 2 1/2 and still had well done.  Next time, after I turn oven off, I will leave the roast in the oven one hour tops, cover roast (still in pan)with foil and leave on the counter to cook just a little more and tenderize (will allow at least 20 minutes for this last step...I promise, meat will be so much more tender if you have time to do it).  The juice that was left in the pan was so delicious and made this meat dish come together (my husband compared it to prime rib sauce).  Time was a big concern when I was making this, I was worried about it coming out overdone, and I was right.  Like I said, if you like medium-rare, stick to 1 hour...definitely not 2 1/2 hours.  Flavor was awesome...huge hit with my husband,5 year old son, and 4 year old daughter!

I followed the recipe to a T, even took the meat out a little earlier than suggested because it was looking pretty shriveled thru the window. Worst roast ever, and a complete waste of money as the roast was inedible.

Fabulous - I have never cared for Beef roast.  This recipe changed that.  Follow it to the tees and you will have a wonderful treat.  A friend stopped by and we told her we'd made a great beef roast last night for dinner.  We gave her a healthy slice.  When she finished it, she asked for more.  That says it all.

I made this in the middle of the night to avoid heating the kitchen during the hottest part of a Florida day. I rubbed the roast with Montreal Steak Seasoning and followed the recipe exactly, except for removing the roast from the oven two hours after turning it off. I was too tired to wait longer. And what a great idea it was to refrigerate it until the next day! the fat layer on top of the pan juices came off in one piece. I sliced the roast and heated the slices through au jus. Perfection! Thank you!

I struggled with getting the roast up to temp.  I followed the instructions, however, my roast was closer to 4 lbs so I tried to compensate and cook accordingly.  By the time the 2.5 hours was up, the roast was only at 135 so I had to turn the oven back on and cook for about another hour.  I took it out at 140 and tented it and it finally came up to 145... it just took forever.  The roast was OK.  It could be more tender, but it was not too tough either.  I made simple beef flavored gravy to accompany this dish and I am very glad I did.  I personally think this cut of meat is bland and the gravy definitely perked it up.  
Not too good, but not too bad either.

We used out own spice rub but followed the cooking method exactly. The meat was excellent. It was tender and still nice and pink. The leftovers were perfect for roast beef sandwiches the next day. I'll be making this again!

Packed this roast in Montreal Steak Seasoning (spice jar from Costco) and put in a large baggie for 3 hours. Dropped to room temperature and then followed the directions and the suggestions of other reviewers. I left my gas oven off for 1 hour after cooking it for 7 min a lb. and then turned the oven back on to 185 for the last 1 1/2 hours. Let it rest out of the oven on the stove top and then sliced super thin. Had a great dinner and wonderful sandwich meat for the next day. Served with a Red Tomato/Blue Cheese/Italian Dressing Salad and it was the perfect summer meal. Where was this when I was driving my kids to baseball/football etc. practices! Will become a staple!

I followed this recipe to a tee, and was excited to try it since of all the rave reviews. When I finally opened to oven, my roast was cold and the inside raw. After waiting so long, especially with a roast that would have taken me less than 1 1/2 hours the tradiional way, I was a little upset. 
In the defense of the original poster, I must add, my oven is old, and probably doesn't hold heat in as well as those who gave this recipe high ratings. But for us with older ovens, I would not recommend this recipe.

This was the easiest roast that we have ever made.  I was leaving the house and I left my mother with the simple instructions...she thought that I had completely lost my mind!  LOL  

I sprayed the roast with Olive Oil spray and then used a blend of garlic powder, salt, white pepper and rosemary.  It was outstanding and I will never make roast any other way!

I was very leary of this recipe but decided to give it a try anyway.  I preheated my oven at 500 for 20 mins., cooked my roast for 7 mins. per pound, then let it sit in the oven for 3 hours.  After letting the roast rest for 20 minutes I cut into it only to have it bleed out all over my plate.  Not even close to pink except around the edges.   I ended up covering and roasting it for 2 more hours at 325 until it was done - just light pink throughout.

This is the ONLY way you should cook Eye-of-Round roast. We use this method all the time. Results are always perfect!

The only change we do is to turn the oven back on, set to 450, while making the rest of dinner. When the oven reachs 450, out comes the roast. This warms up the roast again to a nice eating temperature.

I bought a 2.2 lb CAB eye of round, preheated to 500, cooked at 475 for 18 min, left in oven for 2-1/2 hrs...looked like the picture, but not what I would call tender...required steak knives.  I prethawed the frozen roast.  WHAT DID I DO WRONG?  My wife said it was an old animal...I doubt that.  Glad I didn't make it for company!

So simple it's flawless, I did follow a reviewers tip and set the oven at 200 degrees for the final hour. Cooked to perfection and a pleasure to carve.

I have to admitt I was worried making this dish but I figured I would give it a whirl.  I followed some users advice and brushed my roast with browning sauce then made a powder blend of salt, pepper, granulated garlic and onion powder. I sprinkled that mixtuer all over the roast which was 6 lbs.  I preheat the oven to 500 for 20 min then put the roast in but I kept a meat thermometer in the fattest part of the roast.  I cooked at 500 for 42 minutes than let it stay in the oven.  The thermometer went off at 140* way before the 2 1/2 hour mark.  I would have had a really well done piece of meat if I left it in as long as this recipe said.  I reccomend this meathod but definately use a thermometer because the time definately varries depending on your oven.  The guests really loved it but the roast really needed to be a bit warmer because the timing was off because the roast did not need 2 and 1/2 hours.  This is why I give it a 4 instead of a 5 star rating.

This was great - it reminded me of my dad's roast beef. :)  I drizzled a bit of olive oil over the meat and sprinkled it liberally with Montreal steak seasoning.  A keeper - thank you!

well... Im among the people who this didn't work for... I like one ladys idea of taking the roast out of the fridge a bit early and letting it warm up a bit. I might try it again that way because I really like the idea of using less energy to cook it. Maybe it works in only certain kinds of ovens? I followed the recipe exactly but when I opened the oven the oven was cold and the roast was cool, I moved it to the cutting board with my bear hands. When I cut it open it was too rare and I like rare meat. I reheated the oven to 500 and then put my lid on my pot and poped it back in turned the heat down to 475 and cooked it for another 20 min. It was done perfect on the inside after this but tough and overdone on the outside. Also we used a bit of salt on our slices because we like it that way.

I am so glad I tried this. I was skeptical at first because the oven needs to be shut off but the meat was cooked to perfection. I added coarse ground sea salt and cracked peppercorn rub to the outside. I then followed the recipe as described. Delicious! Best way to make a roast beef that is so very easy.

I had a backup dinner planned in case the roast failed, but I am happy to say the roast was awesome!  I used the roast/convection option on my oven with just the salt and pepper..I will be more creative next time!

So yummy and easy! My only tip is dont rely on the thermometer when you pull it out, ours said it was 120 but when we cut it open it was perfect, I think the roast had cooled off abit and was at temperature before. A must do recipe, soooo good!

After the 2.5 hours I had to turn the heat back on because it was only 130 degrees inside. Once it reached 145 it was still tough like a brick.

Well, my girlfriend told me about this recipe.  I couldn't remember the cut of meat, so I called her from the store- she tells me its a rump roast- so that is what I bought.  I get home and see it ssupposed to be Eye of round roast.  OOPS!  So I freeze it for another day.  I pull it out and thaw it.  Its a bit over 5 pounds and still a little frozen so I cut it in half, pat it dry, put on garlic salt & pepper and cook it for 35 minutes- 7 minutes per pound.  Let it stay in the off oven for 2.5 hours- take it out and it was PERFECT.  Beautiful.  I will never go back! Thanks for an awesome recipe- now we know it works for a rump roast too!

I gambled and served it to company without having tried it previously. I used a rub, and they couldn't stop raving about it. Yes, the rub helped, but the meat was perfectly cooked and juicy all on it's own.

What an interesting recipe!  When made as this recipe calls for, the meat is rare.  I keep the heat on longer as I don't like it quite so rare.

wow, this was wonderfull, did like suggested, let the meat come to room temp, used montreal steak seasoning,kosher salt,worshire ,garlic. Delish.I have a gas oven , so I did not turn off, just turned down low, cooked it at 475' for 25 mins and after a hour was rare for 3 lbs. left another hour for medium. I did add alittle water to pan after an hour.  Had to get a bigger roast this time to have left overs....

Good recipe but, you need to let the meat sit out for about an hour to get to room temperature or it will end up raw in the middle. Raw not rare. I love a good rare roast beef.

In my opinion this is the very best eye of round roast you can prepare.  It's moist on the outside and tasty on the outside.

I was doubtful of this recipe at first because i've never ever cooked a roast before and my husband isn't really a fan of pink meat.  so it was crucial i didn't mess this up!  It was the most succulent wonderful EASIEST recipe i've ever made and my husband cleared his plate in seconds.  because we don't like rare meat too much instead of turning the oven off for 2 1/2 hrs...i left it on at 250. It came out perfectly  cooked and tender as ever!

I did everything the recipe called for and my roast was a little tough.  Also, my oven was cold after 2 1/2 hours.  I believe an oven must hold the heat very well for this recipe to succeed and I'm not sure most ovens do.

Unfortunately this does NOT work in a gas oven.  Unlock an electric oven, once you turn it off ... IT'S OFF!  I am going to try again and reduce the temperature to the lowest possible and see if it works.

This was the worst way ever to make a roast. I did exactly as the recipe said. The temperature of the roast after 2 1/2 hours was only 100 F. Will never make this again. I will stick to my old fashioned way.

Definitely makes the meat tender. Add a little more time if you like it medium.

WOW! Was totally skeptical but went with it anyway. I am so glad that I did and so was my hubby. Came out perfectly med-rare. Super juicy. I coated the outside with Montreal Steak Seasoning and wouldn't change a thing. Thank you so much. We were so worried that the time that it just sat in the oven wouldn't cook it but it sure does.

I was not impressed.  I followed this recipe to the T, using a 2 pound roast.  It came out dry and tough.  I ended up using the leftovers to make a beef noodle soup, and even after simmering the meat for almost two hours it was still tough.

Well, I tried this with a 2.5 lb roast and a new gas oven and at the end of the 2 1/2 hours had a roast that barely registerd 100 degrees on the meat thermometer. I followed the recipe exactly and found that it didn't work at all.

Soooo, good.  Used fresh ground pepper, sea salt and Tastefully Simple's Garlic Garlic.  Did, indeed, taste like prime rib done right!  Can't wait for leftovers.

I have read that this recipe doesn't work with gas or old ovens.  My 80 year old gas oven worked wonders with the eye round roast!  I took it to a potluck and everyone was surprised at how tender and tasty the meat was.  I will be making this again. :)

Excellent.  Followed directions exactly.  I used a 2lb eye round roast so I put it in for 14 MINUTES at 475 and then turned the oven OFF for 1 HOUR 40 MINS.  I marinated the eye round roast in a packet of onion soup mix overnight and it was unbelievable.  Unsure of the turnout I went to a local wireless store (while the oven was off) and purchased a new wireless phone for my fiance in case the meal did not turn out well.  Afterall, it was a birthday dinner from me to her and my first time making a roast with such an inexpensive cut of meat.  The dinner was perfect and she liked the cell phone too...

Wonderful recipe!  I've made this several times now and it turns out perfect every time.  It's such a cheap cut of meet, yet it tastes much more expensive.  Just don't forget to NOT cover the roast.  My mom covered it, and it turned out very tough.

We found this a bit tough. Not all ovens are created equal, and although we followed the recipe, the roast needed MUCH more time to cook. Eye round is a tough piece of meat, and i suggest cooking this longer than directed, that is, if you want meat that is not rare and chewy!

Just like others, I thought this was a strange way to cook a roast, but as others mentioned, I was sold. The roast turned out tender and delicious. I thought for sure that it would be like shoe leather since it is such a tough cut of meat, but we were pleasantly surprised. I had a small cut, 2.5 lbs for 3 of us and cooked it about 15 minutes at 475, then turned it off for 2 hrs. I will most definitely make this again!

Excellent!!  Because I have a gas stove I shut the oven off for an hour and than turned it onto 200 for the rest of the time and it came out perfectly.

No kidding - this is the hands down best way to fix this normally tough but flavorful piece of meat.  Let the salt sit on it for a while before you cook it and use kosher salt.  Awesome technique.

This is good. I did use a dry rub on the beef. Followed the directions, and it turned out very good. If my oldest daughter was eating over, I would have to cook it a little longer. I would make this again.

I prep the roast with kosher salt rub, cover with moist kitchen towel pop in coldest part of fridge for 2-3 days. WEIGH the meat before, and after!!!! The timing is to finished meat weight. Don't like so much salt..brush, or rince it off, pat dry, season, or not. Bring meat out for an hour or so prior to cooking!! Be sure of your oven temps.  EZ~~

This roast came out fantastic.  Perfectly pink all the way through.  My only complaint is that I get a fair amount of smoking during the high temp part (enough that I need to open a window or two so not to set off the smoke detectors) AND I will definitely line my roasting pan with foil as it's a real pain to scrub clean afterwards.  But nevertheless, this is how I will make my roasts from now on.  YUM!

This is a great recipe! I have made it many times. The only change I make is to stuff roast with several cloves of fresh garlic. Very moist and flavorful.

So I didn't have the cook time + 2 1/2 hrs.  I like a medium roast so I cooked at 9 min/lb for my 2.3 lb roast.  I then put in 195 degree oven.  It was done in an hour and 15 minutes.  Instead of taking it out and tenting it I turned it off to make sides and that was wrong cuz it got med well.  But it was so good and so juicy.  Next time I will try the total shut off method or if I have to have the low oven method I will definitely take it out earlier.  This was a great recipe.  Used Montreal steak too and loved it.

My family loved this recipe.  Seasoned with fresh cracked pepper, garlic salt, and A-1 Sauce.  Cooked for 8 minutes per pound (my family prefers medium vs medium rare).  I have cooked this multiple times, try LOCKING the oven door which provides a much tighter seal and consequently much better results.

The flavor wasn't the best, but that was my fault - inadequately seasoned.  But for an eye to be as tender as this was is pretty amazing.  My roast was large - take advantage of extra time.  Also, my oven was cold at the end, so the roast was a well ... easily remedied by turning it up for a little while, just to heat, and then letting it rest in the oven for a very short time, then out.  This is all going to depend on everyone's oven, though.  All in all ...GREAT.  Will definitely do this again ... and I made a big roast so that there was enough for the Beef Potpie recipe from this site with the leftovers.  Not bad for a meat that's less than $2/pound in this economy!

I have made this recipe twice now, once with a small eye round and again with a big one, adjusting the time per pound and both times it came out PERFECT.  Thank you!  I will cook my eye rounds this way from now on =)

I've only just started to get into cooking.  When I told my wife what I was making--and more importantly HOW I was going to make it--she was just as skeptical as all of the other reviewers seemed to have been before they actually tried this recipe.  My meat thermometer never reached the 140 degrees referenced in the recipe.  So, I was worried that it would not be done enough.  However, I decided to stick it out and not vary from the recipe.  I did introduce minimal originality on the seasoning.  I lightly rubbed the beef with Worcestershire sauce and soy sauce.  Then, I rubbed in moderate amounts of salt, pepper, and Montreal Steak Rub.  But, that's really it.  My wife and I were both very doubtful about whether the high-temp approach would actually work, but were quickly won over once we took the roast out of the oven, sliced it and enjoyed its tender consistency, moist texture, and excellent flavor.  I will forever fix eye of round roast this way going forward.  Thanks, so much, to the source of this recipe.

THIS IS A KEEPER! I will never cook it anyother way when I'm yearning for a good roast beef sandwich! It's so easy and effortless to prepare. I did tweek it the last time I made it by adding some seasonings but the cooking instructions were the same. Thank you so much for sharing.

What an excellent method for cooking a roast!  I used a rump roast and it turned out perfect.  I was very surprised at all the nice dark drippings that were on the bottom of the pan.  I browned some chopped onion in the drippings and was able to make some outstanding gravy.   Thank you for a great recipe!

Lyn... this is genius.  I've heard of cooking a roast this way before, but never tried it until i saw your recipe.  Today will be the fourth time i've prepared it...in as many mos. Done two at a time like this before for guests, and for my picky eating German born husband and Island born daughter.  I seasoned and timed the cooking to our (and our guests) liking and it's always been a hit!  Very, very easy and always absolutely perfectly seasoned, moist and tender.  I had to let you know!! ...Thank you kindly for submitting it!  :)

I have to say I was skeptical, but my roast was so tender. I did cook additional 10 mins at beginning as we like our roast more on the med to well and then I kept the oven on at 275 mostly because I have a gas oven and it cools quickly. I put slivers of garlic in the roast and used salt and pepper. Awesome that a round roast can turn out so tender. Thank you for sharing

This was so easy and delicious.  I was a bit skeptical because it seemed too easy - but I fillowed the instructions exactly and my roast was perfectly cooked.  I only gave it 4 start because I think it could have used a bit more seasoning...maybe garlic or onion powder.  Other than that - it was perfect.

All I can say is this was EXCELLENT. I had never cooked anything this way and I have to say I was concerned, but this roast was so good, my husband loved it!
You won't be sorry if you try this. Just remember to slice it thin, it will be moist and tender.

Just made this roast today...a 2 lb. one.  Followed the directions regarding time.  I sprayed it with olive oil and sprinkled it with garlic powder, salt and pepper.  It was perfectly done to a medium-medium rare temp.  Absolutely delicious.  Thanks.

Turns out perfect every time. My husband's comment was that he liked it more with each bite! I rubbed mine in Pappy's seasoning (which can be difficult to find depending on where you live). I also roast it a minute or two less per pound.

My family prefers this a little more done so 9 minutes a pound works really well in my house.  Probably the most tender eye rib roast I've ever cooked.

I can't give it 5 stars, because it ended up being tough on the inside. Maybe I did something wrong. I might try again with a smaller piece of meat.

This was the easiest roast I ever made and also the best!!  I shy away from eye-of-rounds because they are so tough, but my roast (2.65 pounds for 19 minutes) was tender and perfectly rare in the middle.  Thanks so much for posting this recipe!!

Delicious!  I used salt, pepper, fresh minced garlic, worcestershire, and rosemary to season, cooked my 3 pound roast for 21 mins, and let sit for like 1 1/2 hours.  It was juicy and delicious...we made it last night and just sliced the leftovers for sandwiches.  I will always use this!

What a great way to cook a roast! Cooked a 2.4Lb roast for 18 minutes and then left it and played with the kids. 2 1/2hours later it was cooked perfect and the kitchen wasn't hot! Thanks!

I prepared this recipe for 34 people. I increased the recipe accordingly and prepared as per recipe. It was incredible! Not one complaint, the meat was tender, juicy and had an excellent flavor. the pan drippings made an excellent gravy. Everyone was pleased. I cook every Wednesday for our church dinner, 20-50 people and this meal was a hit with oven roasted potatoes and green beans.

This meat is so good - tasty and tender and inexpensive if you find it on special. I make a lot of meat for my husband and this recipe can't be beat! I had no trouble with the meat being cold either, but I have a very good oven. Too bad I can't heat my kitchen to 500 degrees in the summer, but I'll make this whenever I can find it.

I have always wanted to try cooking this piece of meat.  The last and only time I've cooked it it came out tough and we sliced it for dog treats. Thanks to your easy recipe I found a different cut to enjoy.

my boyfriend tried this and it turned out great!  The meat was tender with the pink middle that I love.  He put a little tenderizer on it and it was a whole sirlion tip cut into quarters but it was awesome!  No matter what cut meat...I recommend...

We had a 3.8 lb Eye-of-Round Roast. After preheating the oven to 500 we turned it down to 475. We forgot the 20 minute mark so it roasted for 40 minutes before we turned off the oven. The roast was completely done, no pink. But perfect if you like a more well done roast. Next time we'll back off on the roasting time for the pink middle. This is the first time we had tried this type of cooking method so I was a skeptic. Ready to order pizza for our guests as a backup. No need for the backup, hardly any left overs either. We'll certainly be doing this one again and again.

This is a great recipe if you have a meat slicer.  First i select a combination of spices that I like and spread them in a cake pan the size of the roast.  I then roll my roast in the spices.  This evenly coats the whole roast and doesn't waste a lot of spices.  I set a baking rack inside my roasting pan and follow the directions.  This makes an excellent roast beef sandwich.

This was awesome. I wasn't sure how it would turn out, I'd never heard of making a roast this way. This roast turned out SO incredibly tender and was done perfectly.

I coated the roast with worchestershire sauce, then a tiny bit of tenderizer. Then I rubbed it with a little olive oil, and rubbed kosher salt, fresh cracked pepper and really finely minced red onion and garlic all over the entire roast.

The flavor was AMAZING and went right down in to the center of the meat (I didn't poke it). I think it's because of the cooking method. This recipe absolutely will become a staple in our house - thanks!! Also, thanks for giving clear cooking times (7 minutes/pound) because our roast was 1.7 pounds and it was extremely useful to know how long to leave it at 425. 

Best roast I've probably ever had! Every single person was raving about it all meal long and the rest of the evening. Not many meals do that, but this one does.

I was nervous to cook it this way, but, boy, oh boy, is it the best way to do any roast!  You will not regret it.  I like meat that is medium to medium well, so I definitely cooked it about 9 to 10 minutes per pound at 475.  Turns out really delicious and everyone loves it.  :)

I used a 2.5 lb roast.  I brushed it with olive oil first, then rubbed on a "roasting rub" mix.  It came out perfectly - my family loved it.

PERFECTION!!!! I let the eye-of-round come to room temperature before cooking, which resulted in a medium-done roast. Everyone, including myself, raved over the roast. I also used Montreal Steak seasoning. I cannot wait to make it again!! The best eye-of-round I've ever had, hands down! PERFECT!!!

This was my first attempt at a roast like this. I had a 6.5 pound roast and it turned out fantastic!!! I will do this again. I could not believe how tender it was. I made it for Christmas dinner. My brother said it was like prime rib. I rubbed  kosher sald pepperand garlic salt on it. Wonderful. 
Thank you!

My family LOVED this roast. I did it in my Nesco Roaster - which only goes to about 425 degrees.  After preheating the roaster, I left it on high for the time indicated, then turned it off for 4 hours.  It was perfect!  Tender, pink, very juicy.  I had to leave a note on top of the roaster: "Do Not Lift Lid!" - because everyone always wants to peek!

This is probably the easiest recipe I have ever made in my life. I had a 1.5 lb roast, so I left the oven on for 10 minutes, and took it out after 2 hours. It came out perfect, and I mean PERFECT! It tasted almost like prime rib, just tougher - make sure to slice it very thin!

This is great...so easy! I would like my roast a little more pink. Mine came out medium-medium well. If anyone could say to do less cooking time or take it out of the oven sooner than 2 1/2 hours? I will be making this easy roast again!

Absolute best way to cook a roast.  I've cooked two using this method and raves came from all our diners.  I believe part of the success is due to slicing the meat thinly.  Thank you to the recipe poster - with this method I am assured of a good outcome.

Greetings Everyone!  After reading the poor reviews, I must say the roast should be allowed to warm to almost room temperature before roasting.  Results will be dramatically better!  Love to all !

I made the recipe as written except I let the roast sit in the oven for 2 hours (instead of 2 1/2) as I had a 2 1/2 lb. roast.  It turned out awesome.   I will never make a roast any other way.

Turned out great!  I preheated the oven for roughly 20 minutes, cooked my sirloin tip at 500 for 7 minutes per pound and let it sit in oven for 2 hours. 
Seasoned with olive oil, garlic and rosemary. 
I also removed all visible fat, chopped it up and covered top of my roast with it - the fat melted away and basted the roast!

This roast turned out perfect.  I tried it on a sirloin tip last time and it was equally as good.  This is the only way to do a roast.  Also saves on energy, but then I'm cheap (frugal)

This technique produces a consistently yummy (tender, juicy) If you have a gas oven, you should NOT turn the oven all the way off, just down to 200.

So easy to make and delicious! I always cook roast in the crock pot with potatoes and carrots and was looking for something different. I have a small family of 3 so only had a 2 lb roast and cooked for the 14 minutes and let sit for 2 1/2 hrs. I was really skeptical because of the cooking method, but it turned out perfect! Made gravy from the drippings and mashed potatoes. My meat and potato loving husband said it is the best thing I've made. His new favorite dinner. Thanks LynB for a delicious recipe!

Awesome!!!! I have made 4 eye of round roast using this recipe & they all came out delicious. I will never cook an eye of round roast any other way ever. The last roast I made I cooked it at 5 minutes per pound for a rare roast & it was so good. I put it through my slicer (thin cut) and it was divine. Everyone asked me for the recipe & I mean everyone. Love this method, it turns a tough cut of meat into a tender, melt in your mouth roast. The flavor is great & the drippings yield a nice dark brown gravy, yum! Thank you for sharing this recipe Lyn B, I swear by it now. It's a winner in my book!

Cooking a less tender cut of beef using this method produces a juicier, more tender result than just roasting it the traditional way.  I preheated my gas oven to 500 for 20 minutes. Turned it down to 475 and cooked my 1.72 pound roast for 12 minutes (7 minutes per pound).  Turned oven to 200 and cooked an additional 34 minutes (20 minutes per pound).  Tented it with foil, turned the oven off and let it rest in the oven for 30 minutes. It came out medium rare with enough juices to make an awesome gravy.  Don't be afraid to try this one. As others have mentioned, if you have a gas oven try dropping the temperature to around 200 and cooking 20 minutes per pound for the final cooking rather than turning the oven off and letting it sit for a couple of hours. Gas ovens have a tendency to cool much quicker than electric. You'll just have to tweak it depending on your oven, however, the basic high heat-low heat method is spot on.  I have also used this cooking method for prime rib and the result was just as amazing.

This recipe works so well that I now use no other for this inexpensive cut of meat.  I submit the following possible explanations for those who have had failures:

1) Did not follow instructions precisely!
2) Did not calculate cooking time correctly based on weight of roast.
3) Modified cooking instructions (because thought too simple?).
4) Opened oven during cooking or resting time to check on roast.
5) Cut meat before or during resting time.
6) Knife not sharp enough to cut meat thinly.
7) Did not cut across the grain.
8) Oven not calibrated correctly.
9) Does not like rare/medium rare meat so extended cooking time or cooked roast again (failure ensured!).

It worked!  I had my older son take the meat out of the fridge 1 hour before. I could't make it home in time so I had him turn the oven to 500, then rub a little olive oil on it and generously seasoned it with Montreal steak seasoning.  I had him keep it at 500 for the first section, (because we were running a little short on time). Then turned it off.  Only did a total of 2 hours due to time restriction.  During the last 20 min we turned it on to 250, just to make sure it was warm.  We let it rest.  The meat was tender, delicious and cooked perfectly!  This is a keeper.  The left over meat makes delicious sandwiches! PS We have a gas oven and it turned out great the way I did it.

This is a really great recipe for cooking an eye round roast. However, I have found my cooking times to be less than the recipe, so I always use a digital meat thermometer that allows me to constantly monitor the meat's temperature. Not doing so would have meant well-done meat in every case. Using the meat thermometer, I get a medium-rare roast every time!

We made this for our family Christmas dinner and it was loved by all! I had a 7lb roast so I cut it in half to avoid long cooking time. I followed the recipe exactly and it was seasoned nicely with just the salt and pepper. It was a little over done for our preference (we like MR) but the tenderness of the roast more than made up for it. Next time we may try 20 min per/lb rest time as others did or cut the 2 1/2 hrs to 2 or less

I was skeptical.....and it has taken years to get my husband to eat anything but shoe leather so rare is out of the question. I am always looking for ways to cook the perfect roast....rare in the middle and medium to medium/well on the ends.....this was not only perfectly cooked but incredibly tender for an eye round!

This recipe is so easy its crazy! ONE thing: Let meat sit out to room temperature 1st. Either in microwave or on the counter. I made it the 1st time and it was so good the next time I made breakfast then put it in the oven, had a nice nap, and Voila! Done! It is a great recipe for me because I make my meat for roast beef sandwiches. Let the meat get to room temperature so the muscle doesn't tighten up.. The cooking on this is great.

The meat was really tender!  I do recommend cooking at 200 degrees for 20 mins/lb instead of turning off the oven. Easy to make and no fail recipe.  Best of all, it's a low calorie dish!

the meat is still full of blood,even though i added 2 minutes per pound to have it more than medium rare. when i took it out of the oven the internal temperature didn't even reach 100 degrees. i did try the meat and it was tough.

I made this recipe,for my Saint Patrick's dinner. I had a 5 lb roast, I just added another 10 minutes to the suggested cooking time, as I did not want it too rare.It turned out perfect,and very tender. My guests loved it. I would rate it as excellent. It will be the only way I will cook a roast from now on.

I used a top round roast, rolled it in seasonings and put it in the oven at 475 for the recommended time.  Then I turned the temp down to 200 and left the house for several hours thinking about how I could fix the piece of leather that I'd likely come home to.  Was I wrong!  I am not a red meat eater but it really tasted good to me and the guys in my family loved it--perfectly medium rare.  I still can't believe it worked so well.

I was hesitant about this recipe, a tender roast left in the oven for over 2 hours while the oven is turned off!! We'll let me say, I was proven wrong!  This was the most easiest, tender and juiciest roast I have ever made.  I used an Espresso steak rub to season my roast and sprinkled about four packets of soy sauce (left over from Chinese takeout) and let it marinate in the fridge for about 4 hours.  I don't know what forces of magical cookery were at play, but I will definitely make this roast again.  Thanks for sharing!!

Absolutely perfect.  I have a built-in oven so I turned it down to 200 degrees.

This was wonderful!!  I used a chuck roast that was about 3 pounds.  I brought it to room temp then rubbed EVOO, salt, pepper and garlic powder on it.  I let my oven sit at 500 for about 20 minutes to get it really hot.  Put the roast in for 15 minutes and then shut it off for about 2.5 hours.  The meat was rare but that's how we like it.  I will for sure cook my roast like this all the time. I served this with horseradish sauce. DELISH

My local grocer has a buy one get one free sale; I have never cooked eye of round before.  So, I was a little nervous that it would be money down the drain.  Following this recipe, as odd as it sounds, gave me a tender delicious roast.  I will absolutely be purchasing eye of round in the future, now that I know how to cook it.  Thanks Lyn B, where ever you are.

Incredible!  Having guests over & needed the oven. After the high temperature cooking I removed roast from the oven, wrapped in foil & placed it in a cooler. Three hours later it was PERFECT.

I cooked a nine pound eye of round roast for Christmas dinner using this technique and it worked out famously! I was skeptical about turning my oven off so I decided to set my oven to 200 degrees F. Actually, I could have turned my oven off because the roast ended up being medium-well done even though I took the roast out of the oven 45 minutes early. The roast was juicy and my picky son ate it up.  FYI I did use a meat thermometer to monitor the internal temperature of the roast. Great recipe! I will be using it again!

Thanks, Vanessa

I had 12 people over and this turned out delicious - first rubbed the meat with oil, rosemary and garlic. I was afraid it would be tough, my whole family enjoyed it as it was lean - even the fussy kids!!

I don't even like roast beef, but this was great! I made this roast last night and it was amazing! It was a little "pink" for us at the end, so I followed the recommendation of one of the comments and after the 2.5 hours I turned the oven on to 325 for 20 min and it was perfect. Enjoy!

I was so excited to try this recipe. I followed instructions exactly as stated. The meat was beautiful, and had a good flavor, but it was so tough! You just keep chewing and chewing....crazy! Maybe I'd try it again but with tweaks. I didn't throw it away...threw it in a crockpot with Mexican seasonings and had a nice Mexican shredded beef at the end of the day.

It works! We had a 1.5 pound roast, and so we tried it at 10 minutes at 500 and then 30 minutes with the oven off, but it wasn't quite done. We put it back in as the oven heated up for Yorkshire pudding and took it out when the oven reached 450. 1/2 an hour later when the pudding was done it was perfectly cooked. Next time for a roast that size I might leave it at 500 for 12 minutes and another five in the  oven when it is off. Still, it got perfectly brown and had a great flavor. This was a great method.

Like many others I was very wary making this dish.  I had friends coming round so I split a 6lb joint and made pot roast with one half as a back up.  I need not have bothered.  It came out perfectly and was the juiciest and most tender piece of beef I have ever made other than a mega expensive roast that served only half the people.  Sliced thin on sandwiches with yummy English mustard and your left overs soon disappear.  Highly recommended.  I posted a pic and you can clearly see the moist pink meat.  Thank you so much for this recipe.  PS my friends were very impressed!

Mine came out PERFECT but I did not follow this recipe, I followed what a commenter (PJL4965) posted.  I preheated my electric oven to 500 degrees for 20 minutes before I put my roast in.  I also used a basting brush to spread gravy master over the top of the roast and seasoned with garlic powder, onion powder, sale and pepper.  I then put my roast in for 7 minutes per pound, then turned my oven off and let it sit for 20 minutes per pound.  Afterward, I removed from the oven and let it sit on top of the stove for 20 minutes to let the juices penetrate.  DELICIOUS!!!

Having ruined many roasts, I don't trust any method, but this ensures a tender roast nonetheless. There are variables to consider:  e.g. is your roast still cold from a thaw? is it larger or smaller? Rack placement in oven? So far, the best rendition of this is using a probe thermometer and not letting it rise above 130-135 degrees as it will continue to cook when it is resting and usually reaches a rare-medium-rare temp.  500 is too high to start and smokes out my oven if it isn't spotlessly clean. 450-475 is a good starting temp.  Also, fresh herbs and especially garlic will burn, so be careful when choosing your crusting herbs. The best coarse of action is KEEP AN "EYE" on an eye roast.

I liked the idea of a quicker high heat, however it did not work for me. Cooked according to directions in a gas oven for 24 minutes at 475 degrees. Internal temperature reached only 85 degrees. After reviewing what others said I covered the roasting pan with foil and cooked for another 45 minutes @ 350 degrees. This resulted in a medium done roast, juicy and tender and delicious.

I think there is a minimum cook time.  I did a 1.5 pound eye and  followed instructions and it was not near done after time (120 degrees).  I will do a larger hunk next time, but think there is probably a minimum time to get things going.  I ended up starting the stove, at the end, for ten minutes at 350 and then it was overdone (new higher end stove too)

Pleasantly surprised!!!

I used the gravy master tip from previous reviewer.  Definitely added some flavor and gorgeous color.  When it was getting close to the time to take out roast, I put in a meat thermometer (should have done that to begin with).  It was below 140 (lowest reading on my thermometer).  I started to panic and turned oven on.  It overcooked.  BUT STILL... it was juicy and tender.  I CANNOT believe an eye of round was that juicy and tender.  Oh also, I baked potatoes in foil for the same time I cooked the roast.  They came out great!

My only reason for 4 stars... flavor.  The meat lacked flavor.  The end pieces with the gravy master were good.  The rest didn't have much taste - great texture but no taste.  I might try stuffing in some garlic next time or making a gravy or au jus to go with it (although I had almost no juices).  Don't forget to let the meat rest.  I cut mine a little too early.  Will definitely try again!

I followed this recipe to the letter. Using a 2.24 # eye of round roast (electric oven) it came out great. I cooked it for 18 minutes and left it for 2 hours. I used garlic shoved in three slits I made, fresh cracked peppercorn, kosher salt, and 1/2 of a beef bouillon cube crushed. I had sliced it as thin as I could and the meat was tender, tasty, and warm. It was medium (done) and delicious. To reheat, I plan on making a beef stock and using the boiling stick, I will toss the slices in and let heat for a few minutes. It's important that the slices are thin. I'm not a fan of leftovers often but I'm actually excited about this one.

This came out great.  My roast was a little smaller, so I only cooked at 475 for 15 minutes and then left it in the oven for 1 hr 45 minutes.  It was medium when it came out.  I personally like it a little more rare, but the flavor was fantastic and there was no fuss with thermometers, etc.  I do wish I had put the fat side up as another reviewer has suggested.  I got a smaller roast because I am only cooking for myself and hubby, so don't be afraid of this if you want to use a smaller roast.  I used a 2.10 pound roast, and there was plenty for both of us and I sliced the rest for sandwiches during the week.  Eye of round is a very lean roast, so you do need to slice it very thinly.

It is not super brown on the outside, but I don't consider that an issue.  The flavor, just seasoned with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, was perfect.
Great recipe!

Tried this for Sunday dinner.  It's best to let the roast come to room temp. before cooking at least an hour. I did mine pretty much like the recipe for rib roast by Paula Deen.  I roasted  a 2# roast for 18 minutes at 475 the shut the oven off for 2 hours.  I turned the oven back on until the thermometer came up to l45, about 15 minutes.  Take it out of the oven and rap in foil for at least 15 minutes.  It also is very important to slice the roast beef very thin.

This turned out great. I always read reviews before making a recipe but never bother to write my own. This time I will. I had. 2-1/2 lb inside round roast and wanted to end up with something tender and tasty for a change. This method worked! I did marinade the roast in a mix of 1 can of beer, 1 T steak sauce, 1 T Worcestershire, 1 T soya sauce, 1 T barbecue sauce, 4 bay leaves, 1 T freeze dried garlic and onion and fresh ground pepper. Put all in a ziplock and marinate for 8 to 24 hrs. I roasted at 475 for 18 mins turned down to 200 and left in for 50 mins. Let it rest covered with foil and towel for 20 minutes. Sliced it up and served with roasted potato/carrot/onion/ celery mix and steamed broccoli. With a little bit of gravy and horseradish, Best Tuesday night supper ever! Hubby said "wow this is good" and he is a picky one. So try this method and if you have a cheaper piece of beef, try my marinade!
Bon appetite !

Meat was chewy, not tender like i expected. Also, it needed more seasoning for flavor. I ended up cutting the meat up, throwing it in a frying pan with some sauce and it turned out great.

I would have normally roasted my eye roast at a lower temp, with water, and covered. I was very reluctant to try this and thought no way was it ever going to be done. Well, I first basted it with a little Wegman's basting oil, garlic salt and cracked black pepper and into the oven it went as per the instructions. At the 2 hour mark I knew the oven couldn't still be hot, which it wasnt. (gas) I removed it from the oven and turned the oven back on because I just knew it wasn't going to be done. I got the electric knife out and began to slice it. PERFECT! There was no need to put it back in for a longer roast time.I did slice it and cover with foil and held in a warm oven until the side dishes were ready. Will never make it any other way!!

I was nervous about this recipe, the boyfriend and I prefer our meat on the rare side.  I seasoned it with salt, pepper, and rubbed some garlic cloves on the meat.  My roast was 2.5 pounds...I cooked (fat side up) it 18 minutes at 475 (after preheating to 500).  Because we were short on time, I lowered the temp to 175 and left it in for 40 minutes, took it out of the oven and let it sit for 20 minutes, sliced it thin and it was perfect! Will make this again for sure!

Made this last night because I knew I couldn't be home at dinner time. I used a 5 pound eye of the round roast from Sam's. I rubbed it with olive oil, seasoned well will coarse kosher salt, fresh cracked pepper and garlic and then cooked according to the directions. My hungry family came home to a delicious meal! Hubby said it was only lukewarm and had to reheat a bit, but the roast was beautifully pink in the center, juicy and easy to slice. 
I really wanted veggies with this but I didn't know if that would interfere with the cooking time. I tried it anyway and I was delighted with the results. I cut up yukon gold potatoes, carrots, and onion into bite sized chunks, tossed them in olive oil with salt, pepper, garlic and rosemary and then spread them around the roast on a half-sheet pan. The potatoes were done perfectly, the carrots were still a little crunchy and the flavor was delicious! 
Thanks for the great recipe. I'll definitely make this again.

just by looking at this recipe i know it will be a success.i do a similar recipe for my pork roast.i also say if you want to brown first then go for it.there are details that recipes dont tell you.one key is you need to start with room temp meat.if youre going to put a cold roast in that hot oven it wont even start actually cooking it until that chill is off.could take up to 20 minutes..so to all the unsucessful reviews i say if you didnt start with a room temp meat give it another try.slice thin for a less chewey meat.you really cant go wrong..lizzz

OMG. 3 lb roast for 21 minutes at 500. Then shut off oven and kept in for 1 hour. Removed from oven and tented with foil. 
Seasoned with onion soup mix, drizzed olive oil in pan and on roast, added small red potatoes cut in half and sliced onions over it.  Only way to make a roast.

I'm a former vegetarian who still struggles with cooking meat properly. It came out med-well, just like my husband likes. I was thrilled when he cut it and said "perfect" (very rare for him to say that) :) It was perfect tasting, too. I followed the recipe nearly exactly, along with a few reviewer tips such as, I waited until the oven was at 500 degrees for more than 20 min (I roasted my potatoes during this time). I also made sure the roast was fat side up. I marinated it with wisticher sauce, garlic, lots seasonings, S & P, melted 2 tblsp butter into it.
Thank you!

Very good. This is definetly a recipe where the meat should be at room temperature before starting. I found that out the hard way.

Wow - I was so leery about attempting this recipe, but it turned out great!  The meat was so tender and juicy.  I just rubbed on Montreal Steak Spice and stuck the roast in the oven as I was getting ready to go out.  Then I turned off the oven before I left to do some errands, and came home to a perfectly cooked roast.  Plus, there were plenty of yummy juices in the pan to make some really great gravy.  I will definitely be using this method to cook my roasts now!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!

Wow! Really surprised me how tender it came out. I am officially writing my 1st review because of it. I added garlic to the rub that was the only change and also cooked it 1 minute longer per pound as we like it medium well. Will definitely keep this recipe on hand.

I usually do not buy round eye roast because it's too tough.  However I came across this recipe and decided to give it a try and boy was I surprised.  I cooked the roast exactly as the recipe (temperature) but I stuff garlic into the meat before baking.  The roast came out absolutely tender and juicy.  I would highly recommend this recipe and wis giving it a full 5 stars! My whole family loved it! I will be saving money this Christmas by cooking this roast as opposed to buying prime rib for my 25 guest.

Not very good for dinner as a roast but made excellent sandwich meat. Line pan with foil next time to ease cleanup.

I was very skeptical about just leaving it in the oven with the oven off, but it came out perfect! I added fresh garlic, seasoned salt, and dried minced onions. Juicy and very flavorful!

Tip: Before roasting, have roast at room temperature. I like to wipe down my roast and season it well with my favorite seasonings, so use your favorite too. Then I wrap it in plastic wrap and let it sit out of the fridge for a good 40 minutes. There is really no need to turn the oven down. Just roast, fat side up for the 7 minutes per pound and then turn the oven off, no peeking!! Do not open the oven door for the 2 and 1/2 hours! Spend the time preparing the rest of your meal or, go watch a movie! :D

Without a doubt this is the best way to cook an eye of round.  Here are some tips I've read here or elsewherer
1) rub with kitchen bouquet before cooking to give a nice consistent brown
2) adjust cooking time to size of roast - 7 mins per lb.  However, if smaller than 3 lbs leave in oven for 2 rather than 2 1/2 hrs

I have to say, this was one of the first recipes I found on this site and it is still my favorite. It was so hard for me to get used to not checking on it! But it turns out perfectly every time I've made it. Every once in a while I've used garlic and/or onion powder along with the s&p but for the most part, simpler is better with this one. A couple of times I've sliced some onions and put them on and under the roast which gives it a really nice flavor too. My husband loves it like that.

Wow! Easy to make and a hit with the family! If my husband likes something new that I make, he usually says, "You should make this again."  If he really likes it, he'll say "You should make this every week."  Well, for this recipe, he said "You should make this twice a week!"  I just rubbed it with olive oil, sprinkled Montreal Steak seasoning, paprika and herbes de Provence on it and popped it the oven.  I also served it with mashed potatoes and a terrific gravy recipe I also found on this website called "Simple Beef Flavored Gravy" by Sal.  Yum, yum, yum.

After all of the good reviews I was very disappointed. I used a 2.63 pound eye roast. I cooked it slightly longer because I wanted it med at least. It was very cold and very bloody. No one ate it! Will not make again.

Use a deep baking pan.  My oven is destroyed and it will take a day of cleaning to remove all the burned on grease.  My house smoked up terribly.  The roast was fine, but I dread the oven cleaning that is to follow.

This was delicious! I didn't keep it in the oven for the whole amount of time because I was worried about overcooking the roast. After I turned off the heat I only kept it in for about an hour. The inside was pretty red when I took it out, which is fine for us, but next time I may leave it in a little longer to get on the pinker side of red. I served this with Horseradish Sauce from this site and it was delicious. Tender and juicy!

I had high hopes after reading all the great reviews and comments.  I followed the recipe exactly, only added a little Mrs. Dash.  This was too, too rare and tough as could be.  Family was disappointed.  I cut it all up and will end up putting it in the crockpot for stew.  Live and Learn.

I just made this yesterday - finally! - and the family is still raving about it.  Nicely cooked on the outside, juicy and tender on the inside.  Since we longed the "italian-roast-beef" flavor we used to have in our favourite deli back home, I went ahead and added powdered garlic and oregano.  De-li-ci-ous!!!

I had been looking all over the web for the cooking method that produces this very texture and it was here all along.

Thank you for posting!

I was a bit nervous about this one, but it turned out fantastic!  Will definitely do this roast again.

I have never had a bad recipe until this one. My oven is commercial grade and this roast NEVER Cooked.  Try one where your oven stays on!

I love this recipe!! It is super easy and works everytime.  My husband likes his roast more rare so he cooks it at 6 1/2 minutes per pound and leaves it in the oven for 2 hours after turning off the oven.  That is a little rare for me but is a variation.

So, I could not resist buying a beautiful looking eye of round roast when it was on sale....figured there were plenty of well-reviewed recipes on my favourite website. Well, I should have resisted the temptation.  My piece of meat was exactly 3lbs (I whooped with joy)...I used my meat thermometer as well......BUT I think what the recipe failed to state was that the instructions are only good if it's a "fat"/"round"/"chubby" piece of meat as in a squat, short but nicely round piece of meat...my eye of round was a long and thin roast. So, it reached temperature of 145degrees BEFORE I even turned off the oven to let it sit. However, I FOLLOWED all the instructions to let it sit without opening the door - the result - the temperature continued to rise and I was left with almost a rock hard  piece of meat, no pink in sight, not even gray...all brown. So - what's my lesson here.... ALWAYS TRUST my thermometer AND keep in mind if yours is a convection oven....now if somebody can suggest how I can salvage this once beautiful piece of meat, I will stop crying... :-(

I have been meaning to let you know, I made roast beef this way for my nieces graduation party, and it turned out fabulous!  Most teenagers will head for the chicken fingers and the junk, but once a couple of them had the roast beef, they all went gung ho!  A few are waiting until I make it again so they can come to dinner, guess it will be a houseful tonight.

Thanks for the great and easy recipe.

The roast was a little over cooked for our taste.  Next time I will not leave it the full 2.5 hours.  Over all, the was great and we will definitely try it again!  Thanks for sharing.

I have to say, this was the best roast beef I have ever made. It was juicy and cooked just perfect. The next day, my husband took this on a sandwich for lunch and he said it was just as good as the night before. I highly recommend this method for this cut of meat.

This roast is so good! At first I was skeptical because I have never cooked a roast using a high temperature technique as I have always been a low and slow kind of guy. I tried it and the family loved it!

Went exactly by directions given and had a 3 lb roast. At the end of 2 1/2 hrs. it was cold and bloody!  Could not tell that it was anymore tender than it cooked any other method.  No roast is going to cook in a cold oven and the oven is going to be cold after 2 1/2 hrs. and that is what I told my husband....only tried this method to write a TRUE & TRIED review!

Perfect, I followed the directions of others.  I put a few garlic cloves in the roast, as well as topped it with onion powder, salt and pepper.  It was 2.25 lbs, so I did 500 degrees for 16 minutes and 200 for 25 minutes and it turned out great, moist and wonderful flavor

Followed exactly, but after 200 hours I checked the temperature of my oven and it was already down to 120 degrees with a 1/2 hour to go. I took it back up to about 200 degrees and turned it off for the rest of the time. I never opened the door, and it's a fairly new oven, but it was about 68 degrees in my house. Anyway... at the end of the cooking time it was only 125 degrees. Luckily my husband is coming home late so I cut a couple slices of the ends that were medium rare (even at the very end) and put it back in to cook at 325 so it will be done when he gets home. It was delicious though.

This recipe was great.  I call it my "eye of the storm" roast.  With the hurricane we are running on a generator and this was perfect because I didn't tax the power a lot to have a great meal.  Will definitely be a "go to" recipe.

Made with eye of round and sirloin roast. (Sirloin is more tender). Use more salt than you think - lots more. Lots of garlic and onion powder with salt and pepper.  Fat side up is important too.  I also drizzle with olive oil to brown quickly.  I’ve also made with a paste of Dijon, garlic, Worcestershire, salt and pepper.  The pan juices are very good either way- dip the meat in it after you’ve sliced it thinly.

I use almost this exact recipe for Prime Rib at Christmas time. I make one change, though. I leave the roast in the turned off oven for 1 hour then transfer to a platter and cover with heavy duty foil for the remainder of the time. This frees up the oven for side dishes and gives you time to make gravy too.

Perfect recipe. Hard to say it takes a cheap cut when I'm paying over $3.oo per lb. but this roast was so tasty and although you could'nt cut it with a butter knife was very tender.

I used this recipe with 6.25 eye of the round roast that I cut in 2 pieces.  I cooked it on 475 for 24 minutes, and let it stay in the warm oven a bit longer because of the size.   It came out perfect.  It was pink and juicy and will be my only recipe for eye of the round from now on.

This is a fantastic recipe BUT....you DO NOT have to wait 2 1.2 hours to open the door!  You will, as many have said, have a cold roast to serve and heating it back up will just overcook it.  I open the door when it feels cool, I mean cool is cool so why wait an extra hour.  After about an hour, hour and fifteen minutes, it's fine to open and serve :)

My husband who has always been so specific about searing and baking time and temp on our roasts was thrilled with the results of this method. We are converted! We'll be doing our eye of the rounds this way from now on.

Amazing!   I was very skeptical, but I will never cook a roast any other way. I followed the directions with the exception of letting the meat come to room temp before cooking. I rubbed it with a light coating of canola oil, garlic powder, salt and pepper and roasted it according to the directions provided. Wow! delicious, perfectly pink and moist. My family is still smiling

I really wanted to like this, but it didn't work for me. I followed the recipe, adjusting the times for a 7-lb eye of round roast. I read lots of the comments before starting and therefore preheated the oven for a good 20 minutes before putting in the roast. I cooked it for 47 minutes (a bit less than 7 min per lb), then let it sit for 2 hours. I used a meat thermometer but it was a little hard to read it through the oven door. I think the meat's temperature went up to 150F near the end of the cooking at 475F. After I turned off the oven it gradually went down and just under 130 when I took it out after 2 hours. The roast was overcooked (closer to medium than medium-rare), which is tolerable. But the real problem is that the meat was very tough and chewy, even when sliced very thin. I will be going back to pot-roasting these cheap cuts of meat.

This doesn't work in a gas oven!  Wish I had read through all the reviews before attempting this recipe.  Like others have said, electric oven= awesome roast, gas oven= cold, raw roast.

This may just be my inexperience (or a leaky oven) but each time I've made it the meat has come out close to rare, which is a problem for the guys in my family that like their meat closer to medium. Shall keep trying, but thanks for the recipe.

FABULOUS each time I make this.  I vary the flavors on it, according to my mood (smokey, garlicy, teriyaki, or as written, etc) but regardless of the rub outside, the inside it perfectly done.  My kids prefer this to a roast in the crock pot or steak on the grill.  I prefer the ease of this with our active life AFTER the kids get home from school.  

Thank you for sharing!

I was nervous about trying this for the first time when I was throwing a dinner party but sure enough it worked like a charm! I seasoned the meat with onion powder, garlic powder, and salt, and I threw some fresh garlic into the pan. I cooked the 2.5 lb roast for 18 min before turning off the oven and keeping my fingers crossed. The results were amazing -- an evenly cooked roast just pink enough but cooked all the way through! This was a big hit.

This roast worked beautifully. I actually used top round since it was on sale when I went to purchase the meat. Reading others posts concerning gas ovens and realizing that my apartment oven probably won't work the same way, I did modify certain things. I used a 4 lb roast and seasoned it with kosher salt and pepper as well as some fresh ground dried rosemary. I used a meat thermometer because I didn't want to play a guessing game of sorts and set the thermometer to medium rare. I sprinkled all three spices generously and then put the into the oven after it had preheated for 30 min. I then cooked to the 7 min per pound and then turned the temp down to 220 (lowest my oven went...) and used the meat thermometer to tell me when to take out the oven. Let the roast rest for the recommended amount of time and this was hands down an amazing roast and I plan on using this technique over and over again. In fact, I went and bought a few more roasts on sale and froze them in order to make this meal again!

WOW super easy!  I used kosher salt, fresh ground pepper, then I defrosted several of those frozen minced garlic cubes from Trader Joes, and spread a thin layer all over the roast.  My oven does not hold heat so I followed other peoples tips. Roast 9 minutes for every pound.   I heated oven to 500, then reduced it to 475 when I was ready to put the roast in.  Roasted it at 475 for 27 minutes, then reduced heat to 220 for the next hour and a half.  Came out just a little pink - just the way the husband likes it.  I like mine a bit more rare so I'll reduce the time on my next roast.  VERY EASY, especially for a terrible cook like me!

Great recipe for a small tough roast, it came out tender and perfectly cooked.  I altered the directions slightly by increasing the per pound time to 9 minutes (because I had a small 2.2 lb roast & we don't like rare meat).  It came out perfectly medium pink and more tender than I could have imagined.  Thanks for the creative use of temperature!!  What a great tip.

Very, very easy & very, very good! It is by far the best recipe for this cut of meat I have found. I served it with a brown gravy made from the  pan scrapings, veggies and flavored rice. YUM!

Like many others, I was skeptical of this unorthodox method of cooking a roast.  I am now a believer.  I went for 9 minutes per pound and it produced a wonderful medium rare cut that had juices distributed throughout.  I would suggest slicing very thinly as this provides the tenderness mentioned by others.

I too, was a little skeptical about this method, but honestly this was the best eye round we've ever had...very tender and delicious...I roasted some cut up potatoes with the meat and they came out delish too!   I will be cooking my roast like this from now on....thank you!

I knew instantly that my oven would NOT stay warm enough to cook this through as it has a fan that kicks on as soon as you turn the oven off until the oven cools down.  So after the initial high temp cooking, I reduced the setting to 220 and finished cooking until the meat thermometer read ~140-145 (I like rare).  It only took about 2 hours after turning it down to complete. 

VERY good, I was worried that the cheap cut I bought would not tolerate it but I am looking forward to some fabulous leftover sandwiches. 

Only thing I would say is line the baking dish with foil, the high heat at the beginning burned the juices to the pan. (I did mine on a rack and it was nicely browned all around.

I have always found an "Eye of Round" roast difficult to cook. I've experimented and tried to find a way to tenderize it. I found this recipe and was excited to try it. I followed it to the letter, used my own flavoring etc., and allowed it to cook as per the instructions. Sadly, it was every bit as tough as every other recipe. So, the hunt continues to find a way to cook a juice, succulent, eye of round roast.

Won't do this again... roast came out tougher than if I'd just roasted it at 350 like I usually do - and having the fire alarm going off every 2 minutes during the high heat faze... I'm sure the other tenants in this building are ready to kill me.

Recipe was great.  I had a problem with my oven, however.  As soon as I turn it off, a fan turns on to cool it off, so it won't hold a temperature for long like the recipe would like.  So, I started like everyone else, then let it be off for 1 hour then turned it on 200 degrees.  Told the husband to take it out to check it, but he forgot (I was at the store).  Luckily, it turned out perfect.  It baked at 200 for 2 hours maybe.  So it was in the oven for 3.5 hours total, I guess.  Next time I want to try it at 475 for the 21 minutes and then 200 the rest of the time until done.  I served on toasted french loaf with a homemade Au Jus sauce- recipe from another website- can't believe there wasn't one here.  Yummmy!

ok  I was a doubter, but this really worked,  we don't really care for rare  so I cooked for 9 min. per lb.  I did an herb rub and italian dessing the night before then added some left over sauce from "Marinated Baked Pork Chop" recipe on this site (excellent)  this roast was flavorful and tender.

Juicy and tender this was delicious! I could barely wait to see it after the first hour because it just smelled so good! I punctured the roast with Garlic and then topped with Onions (after the initial seasoning) and I don't think I've ever had better!

This turned out so good! And it was amazingly easy. I followed the recipe exactly except I used montreal seasoning in place of the salt and pepper.... Turned out yummy.

I just made this.. I made the mistake of not pulling it out after 2 or even 2 and a half hours. Mine was 2.42 lbs so I only cooked it 17 minutes. It's still pink in the middle and tender but the ends were dry. I prefer it more rare but it was my fault. I did make the au jus and it's pretty awesome considering I got side tracked sleigh riding in ATLANTA..Go figure

i agree with another reviewer in that this may not work as well with grass-fed beef (which is what i used)- i also think it may not get very tender unless there's more than a tiny strip of fat on there.  i sliced mine thinly and it definitely tasted good, kind of tough though.  but again, i think its all in the cut of meat.

I actually used a bottom round roast (a 5 lb'er).  This method of cooking beef is the best.  The roast came out almost tender, was only slightly pink in the center, and made plenty of au jus (sp?).  If you have the time...you must try this method.

Was very nervous about cooking the roast this way but I always over cook roasts in the oven so I thought I would give it a shot. This will be the only way I cook a roast in the oven from now on. Turned out great!! Nice and pinky-red in the middle, just the way we like it.

absolutely awesome.  I have made this over and over.  Perfect for weeknight meals and special occasions.  I made for Christmas dinner and used pan drippings to mix with Better than Bouillon gravy mix that I cooked with minced shallots, sliced mushrooms and a cup of red wine.  It was Divine !  Fantastic.  I have one in the oven now.

I tend to buy the more affordable cuts of meat, but after landing a great deal, I saw this recipe & thought the rating proved it was one i should try....Tho my hubby TRIES to avoid red meat, he kept going back to the stove to "pick" There were barely any leftovers(ALL the boys in my house love a good piece(s) of meat!!! That searing technique really worked!

I was very skeptical when I first looked at this recipe.   But I didn't have much time and thought what the heck, let's try it.  It was not just good.  It was great.  I did not change a thing.  My husband loved it.   What a great recipe, thank you for sharing.     Mary

OMG, OMG, OOOMMMGGGGGGG!!!!!!!!  This is THE BEST "recipe" for roast beef!  As another reviewer said, I can hardly wait to try it on other cuts tooo!!!  I admit, I panicked a little when others said it was undercooked, so I left it in for an additional 4 minutes (big whoop ;)  It was amazing!!!  I cooked it in the evening for tomorrow nights dinner and had to put it in the frig right away so that I wouldn't eat any more.  Folks, you've got to try this.  Who ever "invented" this recipe is a genius!  Thanks you so much!!!  I'd give you a 10 if I could.

Absolutely PERFECT!!!!!!    I allowed the meat to come to room temperature and massaged it to relax the muscle fibers before popping it into the oven.  It was VERY tender!  there wasn't enough drippings to make much of a gravy, because it was all contained in the roast.  Fine with me!

I have made this roast twice now. It does come out perfect, as far as doneness, but it also comes out cold. How do I reheat the roast without it drying out?

After reading the rave reviews, I guess I was expecting too much from an eye roast.  It was certainly an easy way to roast the meat.  I added only a little garlic powder with the salt and pepper, I made no other changes.  I had a 4.69lb. roast and roasted it at 475 degrees for 32 minutes, then turned off the oven. When I took it out of the oven after 2 1/2 hours the temperature of the meat was 142 degrees.  The oven was almost cool, but I figured it had probably gotten up to 145.  The meat was a nice color and it tasted OK, but I was really disappointed that it was NOT tender. I'll slice the leftover roast on the meat slicer, let it simmer in the gravy and hope that it will be more tender for sandwiches.  I'm glad that it was on sale.  I won't make it again.

This was incredible and easy.  I made some gravy from the drippings - yummy.  My roast was only 2.7 pounds (cooked at 475 for 19 minutes) and it came out closer to medium (slightly pink) than medium-rare but it was very tender.  Next time I will use a larger roast.  I seasoned it with salt, pepper and garlic powder.  My picky eater went back for seconds, TWICE!

AMAZING flavour!! so delish - the only disappointment is that for me cooking it this was doesn't produce much as far as jus...which just means so gravy....the roast was to die for - and thats saying a lot for me, typically I don't really like a lot of meat!

If my oven is a unit that constantly cools with a fan even when it has been turned off, do I need to leave a temperature setting during the cool down period? Does not the fan running during the cool down time cool the interior of the oven too quickly to have the roast interior reach the desired temperature?

Make sure that your meat is at room temp before placing in the oven.  I cut that corner last time and ended up with an extremely rare middle.  To rectify the situation I place the rarest cuts on the stovetop in a gravy that I had made from the pan drippings.  Even with the mishap, still no complaints at the table!

i don't even like meat. no, really. i have been off again/on again vegetarian for years just because i am not a meat fan. but this was perfect. i rubbed with salt and pepper and brushed on browing liquid. 2.5 lb roast was at 500 for 20 minutes and then sat for over an hour. everyone agreed this was a perfect eye of round roast. i have another just waiting for the same treatment :)

Rubbed the roast liberally with salt and pepper and a little garlic powder. The high temperature really seared the seasoning on the meat forming a beautiful crust. Loved it!

The best eye-of-round roast ever! I've used many recipes from allresipes but have neve registered until I used this recipe since I wanted to rate and comment. Mine was 2.1 lbs so I roasted it for 18 minutes at 475 after heating my electric oven at 500 for 30 minutes. I did use an electronic probe thermometer to measure the internal temperature to be sure. It took about an hour until it registered 145 degrees internally. I let it rest 15 minutes tented loosely before carving. Incredible! There were so many drippings I made a gravy in a seperate pan making a roux first then adding half the drippings and just making a simple au-jus with the remaining drippings.   Cook with the fat cap up. I did rub my own spice blend in as opposed to just salt and pepper. I did coat it rather heavily with kosher salt.   It came out perfectly med-rare. I can't wait for the sanwiches tomorrow.

Great, easy and quick in terms of prep work.  I had a 2 lb eye round.  Had it at 500 degress for 4 minutes, then 475 for 11 minutes, followed by half an hour at 170, it was a little too red for me.. will keep it at 170 for an hour next time.  Tender and tasy.

I have to admit, I was worried when I finally opened the oven and it was not really warm, but I got out the meat thermometer and the roast was perfect!!!  I took leftovers to work for lunch and my co workers asked how I made such a beautiful dinner, when I told them they were amazed! I have avoided eye of round for a long time because I didn't know how to cook it so that it would be tender.  The only other time I cooked it was years ago. I braised it and ruined dinner.  This recipe will save me a ton of money!  I can buy eye of round for at least a dollar cheaper than other cuts and much less than ground beef.  I bought 3- 3lb roasts on sale this week, now I will be buying more and playing with seasonings depending on what side dishes I make.

Tried this twice, just in case I did it wrong the first time, but no it was terrible both times! Either I bought the worst/toughest roast BOTH times or this is a myth of making a hard piece of meat to cook into a tender miracle.

Amazing!  This was as easy as you promised and delicious!  I love the fact that the oven was off after 21 minutes of cooking!  We had a 3 lb roast and I went looking for a recipe.  I'm so glad I found this one!  I sliced it very thin and arranged it on a small platter . . .  a family of five including three picky eaters all loved it and we have over a third of the roast left over for another meal!

This recipe was sensational for an eye of round roast. It didn't work that well with another roast I tried though. It still deserves 5 stars. I will most certainly use this recipe again.

This was a great recipe for this cut of meat. I rubbed my roast with Olive Oil (Mild, not EVOO), fresh ground pepper, kosher salt, and fresh pressed garlic. I made a gravy from the pan drippings, and served it with mashed potatoes and broccoli. It was a hit. Used leftovers to make Beef on Weck. YUM!

Had a small roast just over 2 lbs for 4 of us.  Was skeptical about this recipe but gave it a try.  Roast was in oven for about 17 minutes then shut it off.  An hour later the internal temp was 155. We had put a movie on and there was still another hour left, as soon as the movie ended I pulled the roast out of the oven, the temp had dropped to 140. Heated up some gravy, sliced the roast, put it in the hot gravy to warm it up a little. Served with mashed potatoes and corn.  This was awesome and so simple! The beef was delicious.

I made this roast tonite but instead of salt and pepper, I coated the roast with dry McCormick Montreal Steak seasoning.  Excellent and super easy!!  Anyone can do this!  Perfectly pink and wonderfully seasoned!  Will be using this recipe again!

I followed this recipe and even left it in the oven for a little while longer.  It was delicious!  Perfect for me, but I like meat on the rare side.  My husbnad felt it was too pink for him so I added a can of beef broth to the pan drippings and put the thinly sliced meat into the pan and simmered for a couple of minutes, not too long at all.  You can see the color changing, so it doesn't need to be in the liquid long.  Then served the meat and used the broth as a gravy.  It was delicious!  Will definitely make this again.

I have ruined many a roasts by not cooking properly; and eye of round quite honestly, scares me since mine have always been almost tough and dried out. This recipe is a winner! I followed directions exactly and it was delicious sliced up and used all week for the best sandwiches!

OK, this is fabulous!! I did a 3 pound eye of round, 21 minutes at 475 after the 500 preheat. Then turned oven off and checked it at 90 minutes. It is perfectly done and so tender that I cannot believe it! Like most, I was skeptical, but don't be. Have faith and carefully follow the directions. Has anyone tried this on a roast other than an eye of round? Curious as to how it worked, if you did.

This is absolutely the best way to make a eye round. Like it about med to med-well. Baked about 9 mins. per pound at 500, then kept oven on warm for about 2-2.5 hrs. Simple and delicious. Thanks for the recipe.

My husband absolutely loves this recipe, which is the highest complement you could get from him because he hates roasts.  The meat turned out juicy and had a good beef flavor (close to prime rib, yum!), not the dried out roast beef taste I grew up with.  I use a meat thermometer, so in my oven the roast cooks to 145 degrees one hour sooner than the recipe states.  I season with McCormics Montreal Steak Seasoning.

I was skeptical but this was perfect! I wanted to report what I did for others who like me may be using a much smaller roast.  Our eye of round was 1 lb. 3 oz.  I preheated oven @500 for 20 minutes. Lowered temp to 475 and put it in oven to roast for 8 minutes.  I turned off the oven and let it sit another 30 min. but it was too rare so I turned oven back on to 325 and roasted for 30 min.  It came out perfectly seared and pink throughout.  I might keep it at 475 for 9 min. on a roast this small next time cutting down on the sitting time after oven is off.

I'm a vegetarian, so I followed the instructions exactly when I made this for my family for Christmas dinner.  I can't rate it myself, but my husband thought it was excellent--a teeny bit on the dry side, but the cut he purchased had almost zero fat on it.  Will definitely cook this again!

Great results. I added garlic cloves by making small holes in the roast and pushing them in. Next time I will reduce cooking time to 19 minutes per pound, since I'm using a convection oven.

The meat was delicious! My only concern was that when I pulled it out of the oven, the internal temp was only 115 degrees (far short of the target 145 degrees). The meat was cooked to the right degree of rareness for us. Perhaps it was my oven's insulation that caused the problem? We will definitely be making this again as it was one of the best roasts I've ever made.

Very good - you have to try it to believe it. I preheated the oven at 500 for half an hour. I had a 3-pound roast and cooked it at 500 for 20 minutes (forgetting to lower the temp to 475), and then turned off the oven and let it sit for 2-1/2 hours. I used garlic salt, pepper, and thyme as a rub before cooking. Result: nice flavors and a tender roast done to perfection (a bit pink in the center).

I followed this recipe exactly, but my roast wasn't up to temp after the 2 1/2 hours. It was only at about 110 degrees and still basically raw, in my opinion. Possibly it was just my oven? Whatever the reason, I probably won't use this method again.

This was JUST wrong! I followed the directions to a "T" and the meat was not rare...it was RAW 80 degrees. After an hour at 350 it was perfect but I have issues with uncooked meat being left to harbor bacteria for 2- 1/2 hours! Won't be making this again.

Hmmm...not sure if what the problem was, but mine only reached an internal temp of 120, so it wasn't done. Another reviewer suggested keeping the oven on 200 degrees instead of turning off entirely. I might try this if I attempt this recipe again.

works every time!  I don't follow the seasoning directions exactly, and sometimes I don't season at all!  I always end up with a moist and tender roast.  I often shred or slice thinly to make aujus sandwiches or similar recipes calling for shredded or thin sliced beef.  This is one super easy recipe!  Thank you!

So easy and great. I just put a little olive oil on the roast and then rubbed some sea salt, pepper and garlic on it. SO YUMMY!

I was so skeptical but then read the reviews and they are ALL correct-this is the BEST recipe!  I added garlic and onion powder along with salt and pepper and it was so delicious that there were no leftovers!  Tender, moist, a little pink in the center, and excellent!

Years ago, I cooked roast with a recipe just like this which I had gotten from my cousin.  I had forgotten about it so I was happy to have my memory jogged!  I never salt meat before cooking it so I did not add salt, but added TONS of black pepper.  My old recipe called for cooking at 500 degrees for 5 minutes per pound and leaving in the oven for three hours.  Not sure what size roast I used.  Anyway, this is the BEST way to cook Eye of Round roast.  It's delicious with a horseradish cream sauce on the side!

Holy moly, this is the BEST roast I have ever made. And so easy, I couldn't believe it. I rubbed the roast with salt, pepper, rosemary and minced garlic. I followed the cooking instructions exactly even though I only used a 2 lb roast. My husband (who is extremely picky and rarely eats anything I make) said it was the best roast he has ever tasted. He loved it. It was very moist and had the perfect pink center. Thanks so much for submitting Lyn B!!! You've made me very happy.

Wow, the easiest roast that I ever made! I did rub olive oil along with fresh chopped garlice along with salt and pepper. I did turn the oven back on after the three hours to give it just a little more cook time, about 1/2 hour because some family members like it on the medium well side. The roast was tender and juicy and it was the first time that I made a eye roast and totally enjoyed it.

I was skeptical but now I am converted!  Only way I will ever cook a roast again if I have the time.  It was a beautiful bright pink inside!  I used Montreal Steak Seasoning as a rub and brushed Kitchen Bouquet Browning and Seasoning Sauce on it which gave it a great color.  Update:  Just want to thank Lyn, the submitter.  I discovered this recipe in 2009 and EVERY roast I have made since has come out PERFECTLY using this recipe.  My family loves their beef to be a bright pink inside and I have never failed them - or me - with this recipe.  No stressing anymore!  I am making a roast now and just chilling!  Thanks.

UNBELIEVABLE!!!!! I have always cooked the cut of meat in the crock pot until it fell apart and used it for sandwiches. Never again! We have a small family. My roast was only 2.2 pounds. I cooked it at the 475F for 16 minutes. I shut the oven off and we went to the beach. 3 hours later, it was juicy, tender and a perfect medium. Who would have thought! Spent 15 minutes adding baked potatoes and a steamed veggie. What an easy delicious meal! Thanks.

Tried using this with a different cut, and I have to say, stick with the directions. I will try this again, as I have found a grocery store that carries eye-of-round roast (the place closest to me doesn't carry it). I highly recommend using more spices, as I had problems covering the roast. As other members said, have the fat on top, it really gives it a nice glaze. Next time I will also put garlic cloves into it.

Wonderful! I made it last night for my husband and I and it turned out beautiful. I used my own rub, and served it alongside Rosemary Red Potatoes and a spinich salad. Best dinner for the price that there is. Looking foreward to the leftovers for dinner tonight.

Did this same technique with a Chateaubriand cut and it was excellent as well... Painted my roast with the brown sauce and seasoned with garlic powder and fresh pepper. Follow everything else as listed and enjoy. There are many cuts of roasts you can try with this same technique. Let others know what cut of meat you tried following these same instructions. Would love to hear...

This is a great way to make homemade roast beef! The only changes I make are to give it 5 1/2 minutes per pound at 475 (but i like mine a little red in the middle) and take 1 packet of Liptons onion soup mix and crush it with a mallet then roll the roast in it. then do it in a roasting pan with a rack. Thank you for for showing us how to make great roast beef at home! note! make sure to pre-heat your oven atleast 30 min, and when you turn it off lock the oven door, and wait atleast 2 hrs before opening! this recipe really works!

Fantastic!  Easy!  It was overcooked (we're a RARE family) but it was so tender and flavourful we didn't care!  I will adjust my timing for the next roast but I believe this is still a 5 star recipe.    The only way to cook this cut of beef!

It worked! Seriously this is the first time I have made a roast that turned out so well. I did need to turn the oven back up to 170 deg for 10 - 15 minutes at the end to heat it up... it was cooked nicely thru but did need some heating up at the end. Will definitely make it again... and again...

Like others I thought this would MAYBE be good.  It was outstanding.  I had a 2 pound roast.  I cooked it at 475 for 18 minutes.  Then turned the oven off and let it sit for almost 2 hours.  It was more on the mid rare side.  I had to bring it up to mid well for my family.  Believe it or not I did this after I sliced it in the microwave!  Still extremely juicy and flavorful.  I did smear BETTER THAN BOUILLON beed flavor on the outside of my roast along with garlic, salt, pepper and CREOLE seasonings.  Made the best au Jus around.  I poured the au Jus in a skillet added water a little bit more BETTER THAN BOUILLON and rice flour (we are gluten free).  Gravy was fantastic.  I will be making this FOR SURE again.  My roast HATING husband gave this a 9 out of 10.  He has NEVER eaten more than a bite of roast in 12 years I have been with him!  That says a lot.

I have never  rated a  recipe, but I  just had to, this was the easiest recipe and transformed an eye of the round into a delicious dinner. Whatever you decide to rub roast with it will be great, I will be making this roast again this weekend.

Finally I did not overcook a roast!  This was great, although I did rub with olive oil before adding salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  I also added an inch of water to the pot, so I could have a little base for a gravy.

WOW!  This really turned out great!!  I rubbed the roast with liquid browning sauce and coated well with garlic powder, sea salt and black pepper (next time I will also add some olive oil).  I followed the roasting just as the recipe states and it was perfectly medium rare and tender.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I followed this recipe to the letter. For seasoning I used Kosher salt, black pepper and onion powder. Right before plating I turned on the broiler just to warm up the roast abit. It was perfect! So tasty, so tender....

Just a comment about this review, luckily I cheated and opened the oven door about 1.5 hours into the 2.5 hour wait time, I put my instant read thermometer in and it was already just between 145 and 150.  So I took it out and cut it, thank goodness, it was juicy and still pink in the middle, not too rare and just perfect.  I think if you wait the entire 2.5 hours without opening the door, you will end up with a cold roast!

Best Roast I've ever made Thanks to this recipe!!  I used a 4lb rib-eye (special occasion) was not shy at all with the salt, pepper and minced garlic.  Followed the heating directions all the way up til the last hour, I did turn the heat up to 120 for about 15 mins as the outside of my over was really cooling down.  It was PERFECTION!!

Are you kidding me?  This was the easiest recipe I have ever made in my life.  Competely fool proof (even for me!) All you have to do is follow the directions and no peaking.  Couple of additions I made based on previous feedback: I coated the roast with olive oil and then used salt, pepper, garlic powder and paprika.  I used a teaspon of the salt and pepper and half a teaspoon of the others.  Delicious! It was juicy and medium to medium rare...All I can say is NUM!

I made this for Christmas dinner yesterday, and it was awesome!
I had a 5 lb. eye,rubbed it with Olive Oil and seasoned. I put it in for 35 minutes at 475, then turned down to 175 for about 2 1/2 hours. I was going to turn it all the way off, but decided I didn't want it cold, so I left it on for warmth. Took it out,covered with foil till I got done with dinner prep.
I have never had one come out so good-when I started to slice it,the juices just ran. 
The one end was alittle more than medium, the other end was still pink, so it was perfect for the mix of tastes we had.
So tender I couldn't believe it.
 Definitely will do this one again!!!

I was amazed that this actually resulted in a tender juicy roast.  It was really hard not to pop open the door to check the progress.  I did have to turn the oven back on after the prescribed time as it had cooled somewhat.

If you need to eat super-lean meat, but hate how tough and bland, THIS is the recipe you've been looking for.  I made this using a 2.36 lb eye of round roast and cooked it for the 7 minutes per pound stated and left it in the oven for 2.5 hours, let it rest for 20 minutes and WOW.  I almost couldn't believe it!

I only used the McCormick steak rub and it has plenty of flavor for me.  I might try injecting with garlic next time.

Yummmmm. I agree, this sounded like a crazy way to prepare beef. So, glad I tried it....Perfect! I read reviews and followed the recipe and timing with only a minor adjustment. I baked for 9 minutes a pound because I'm not a fan of rare meat. I was afraid a 2 lb. piece of meat was small in comparison to others and would come out dry or need some temperature adjustment..not so, it was perfect. My husband said it tasted like prime rib (although I served an eye-round that was on sale!! Yippee a sure keeper.

This is the first and only roast I have ever made that was not only edible, it was delicious.  I am stunned.  NOW I understand why people serve roasts! I will tell all my friends about this method of cooking lean roasts. Thank you.

I just tasted this roast and it was excellent. I am very impressed that such a tough cut can come out so juicy and tender. I have a 40 year old oven and knew that it would have trouble holding heat once it was turned off. So I baked my 2.7 lb. roast at 475 for 18 mins. and then turned the stove off for about 45 mins. I then turned it back on at 175 for about an hour. The roast came out medium which is more done than I normally like but really tasted very nice. Next time I will cook it at 150 for about 50 mins. I made a "crust" for my roast which had flour,bread cumbs,pepper(lots0, salt, garlic and onion powder in it along with a dash of montreal seasoning. This came out very nice, just remember to coat the roast with olive oil and only cover three sides. The one that goes down in the pan should not have any crust. I forgot and had a little mushy stuff under my roast.
One last note,my husband is from England and when I had him try this, he said it tasted just like his Mom's sunday dinner. Which I take as quite a recommendation.

I also thought this recipe was strange, but this was the only recipe I could find on this site for the cut of meat my honey bought on sale at Costco...It turned out delicious!  Not only is it great the night I make it, but we LOVE using leftovers to make steak and cheese subs...MMMM!  We make this recipe all the time now!  When I make it, I use no salt but generously sprinkle Tenderizer on it, otherwise it's too chewy.  Thanks for a really unique recipe!

It was COLD! I took the roast out of the oven after the 2.5 hours, and the meat thermometer didn't register.  I cut it open, and it WAS cooked through to a nice, pink, medium rare.  But it was barely room temperature.  I had to heat the oven back up to reheat the roast to serving temperature.  And fortunately, we were all healthy adults--I would have been worried about serving meat that sat at room temp to anyone with a weak immune system.  Also, there were no drippings, so no gravy.

I tried this with a 3.14 lb. eye round roast. I extended the 475F cooking time by a minute or so for the extra .14 lb.
It came out ok...a lot of the juices ended up at the bottom of the pan. I had set it in a shallow casserole dish with a small pie rack to hold the roast above the dish a bit. Juices are bound to leak out no matter.
I've saved the juices and plan on slicing the roast into paper thin slices using my Krups meat slicer, then put them in the juices to add flavor, then use Reynolds EZ Vac qt. bags and freeze for future Au Jus and rolls dip. I bought this eye round from Vons and nowadays it comes to Vons in a plastic bag the butcher has to cut in half and trim the fat. Also, I noticed this cut wasn't as red looking as I have seen in the past, lighter red. So...what I'm getting at is the success of this method depends on the quality of the cut you get and your oven's ability to retain heat. All in all, not that great a difference from the usual 325F method. I urge all to purchase a home use type meat slicer where you can cut it into paper thin slices or slightly thicker for dinner plate serving.  

All in all...a good method.
Previously...with the slow 325F method per pound, the eye round roast seemed to cook too much towards the outside, with the inside being too undone.  This hot start method seems to eliminate that.

I followed this recipe exactly, and when the time was up the meat was barely cooked, pretty much raw.....maybe because I have a new oven?

Absolutely delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly.  After the 2 1/2 hours the oven was just barely warm, but the carry-over heat in the roast maintained a safe temperature.  I sliced at an angle with a very sharp knife to help keep the juices in every yummy slice.  And the left-overs (not many left-overs) that made up my roast beef sandwich the next day made a very special lunch!  

One hint.  When slicing thinly, do it in the pan you cooked the roast in.  If any of those yummy juices escape you can recapture them mess free!

Excellent recipe. Thank you so much for sharing.

I marinated the roast for 2 days in a garlic herb store bought marinate, I found this recipe online and decided to try it, I didn't think it could be so juicy and tender, but my only complaint was that my husband and I found the meat cool to the touch when eating. Otherwise, even though it wasn't hot, it was awesome, and would do this again.

This is a great recipe.  I followed a couple suggestions made by other reviewers.  I brushed some vegetable oil on the roast, then sprinkled on some Montreal Steak spice.  I cooked it on the high temp for 21 min, then at 200 degrees for 45 minutes since my oven doesn't hold heat well.  After removing the roast from the oven and letting it sit for 20 minutes, I sliced the roast and found it too red/bloody for my taste.  I placed the slices of roast back in the pan with the juices and cooked it for 5 more minutes at 400 degrees and it was PERFECT!  My son who hates roast beef said it was "okay" and the rest of the family loved it.

I like eye of round roast but had to cook it so long to get it tender.  This turned out so good and there was no leftovers so next time I will make a bigger roast.  My neighbor used this recipe for a venison roast and it also turned out great. I will definately be making this again. A++++++++

I can't believe how well this roast turned out!  My husband walked by as I was cutting into the roast to see if it turned out and went on and on about how perfect it looked, perfectly pink in the center.  My mother-in-law tried a bite when she stopped by, and couldn't believe such a tough piece of meat could turn out so good.  I now want to try and make another kind of roast with this method. WONDERFUL!!!

I have to say I LOVE this recipe.  So easy.  Even my husband who is the "roast expert" in our house was amazed, especially since I didn't tell him until after I was done how I cooked it.  Today I'm making this again with the Montreal Rub as other reviewers had recommended.  Thanks Lyn for this recipe!!  I now love making roast again.

This turned out well, though I didn't have much juice.  Next time I will add some garlic and maybe some other spices for more flavor, but the meat was tender. So much better than the eye round shoe leather beef I remember from childhood (sorry Mom!)

Super!  And SO easy!  I coated the beef with Montreal Steak Seasoning (got the idea from Rachael Ray) and it was incredible!  Mine was 2.7 lbs, but I still followed the recipe as if it were 3 lbs.  I would say it came out med to med-well - would definitely decrease the cooking time next time to achieve more of a med-rare roast beef.

I am not a big fan of beef but will eat it occasionally. This was an outstanding roast. I did use kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Can't wait to have some on a sandwich. Extremely easy,moist and tender. Bravo!

I put my 2 lb roast in the 500 F oven for 20 min, 3 hours early. It was cold when I took it out, but cooked to perfection (med/rare)!  I have had only mediocre results with roast beef in the past, and always had to cook the meat longer than specified though my oven temp is precise. This recipe is easy, economical, tastes really delicious, and I don't have to WORRY about it! Next time I'll take it out of the oven sooner. Thanks Lyn B-will definitely use this again.

Easy peasy!
   I read many of the 1 and 2 star ratings before I started my roast. 
   If I had to guess why those folks were not successful, I'd have to say any or all of the following facts occurred. 1) Miscalculating stove-on time to weight of meat. 2) Stove not properly preheated before placing roast in oven and reducing temperature. 3) Somebody opened the oven door for a few seconds to just look and make sure the roast hasn't been stolen by stove ghost! 4) Oven thermometer /temperature gauge is incorrect. 5) The cook is used to eating overcooked pot roast. 6) The cook's cutlery is too dull to slice paper thin pieces of meat. 
   I used a dual-fuel gas/electric stove and a large cast iron skillet to cook mine.
   This will be my chosen method for eye of round roasting from now on. -Kenn

Came out wonderful , I used Garlic powder rather than garlic salt. My roast  was small a little less than 3 lbs. Also, I have an electric oven, and I should of lessen the cook time-But all in all it was Tasty-coated it well with black pepper

I made this with a 2# top round roast (also a tough cut).  I seasoned with salt, pepper and rubbed with minced garlic and horseradish sauce. It came out delish!  Will definitely use this technique again.

Turned out amazing!!! I used to shove a roast in the crockpot and cook it for hours and then slap gravy to make it somewhat presentable... never again. It was very tender and juicy and soooooo easy!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Followed recipe to a T. Came out a hard, tough piece of meat. Although it was a nice pink color in the middle, some pieces were easy to chew, others were not. Not sure why I didn't work for me but certain I won't try it again.

This roast turned out great! I pounded peppercorns in a bag with a tenderizer mallet and the covered roast with that and kosher salt. Other advice was correct, if you have a gas oven you have to set at 200f to ensure heat. Delicious flavour. Made gravy with it too

This is a joke right? Not tender at all, horribly tough. Ended up throwing it away. How is it possible that 1400 people say this made for a tender roast and yet mine was inedible.

I very rarely rate recipes but this is an exception. The very best meal I have ever made, hands down. in 30 years of marriage. Followed the tips of reviewer PJ4695 --the most helpful positive reviewer.  My 4.4 lb eye of round roast was tender, juicy and tasted wonderful. Put carrots, quartered potatoes and celery in a pan, drizzled with olive oil and sprinkled with salt in the oven at the same time and they came out perfectly done. Think next time I will put them in the same pan with the roast. The drippings in the pan (added a bit of water in the bottom, under the rack,  before I started just to keep it from smoking) were so good.  Wonderful recipe!  This is now my go to  special occasion meal. Many thanks!

I really  dislike giving a bad review but this wasn't to our liking. The inner part of the roast was quite tender but the outside was unchewable. I followed the recipe as it is written.

Followed this recipe to the tee and unfortunately it came out very rare in the middle. I put it back in the oven on 350 for another 15 min and it came out with a little pink  in the middle.

My family enjoyed this recipe. I did feel that the roast was a little to bloody for us. Next time I will cook the roast just a little longer before I let it rest for 2.5 hours.

I have a good remote oven thermometer, so I cook it for about 6 minutes per pound at 475 then turn off the oven and wait until the alarm on my thermometer goes off at 140 degrees.  It doesn't take as long with my new oven because the door fits very tightly and the temp comes down very slowly.  

Perfect every time.  I also use this for whole pork loins.

Can I give this more than 5 stars? This was hands down the best roast I have ever made. I made it for slicing for sandwiches.. put it on some yummy bread with a little mayo and horseradish. Life changer! I won't be looking for any other recipe!

I did use a traditional roast dry rub prior to cooking, but other than that I followed the recipe.  This was the best roast I have ever had.  I served with au jus and a side of garlic cheddar mashed potatoes with a side garden salad.  I will definately make this again!

Followed directions to a T - in a gas oven and the 3lb roast was well done and beyond chewy. I'm so glad that I didn't try this out with family coming over and only wasted it on my own family (of which I can handle their ribbing of jokes - over embarrassment during a dinner party). 
Not sure what recipe I'll try next - but this one won't be in my arsenal - very bummed that it was a no go.

The best way to make eye of round very tender and perfect pink color - I did paint the outside with Kitchen Bouquet and sprinkled with  lemon pepper and  garlic powder before it went in the oven and it was fabulous! I made some au jus  to pour over the meat - 1/2 C red wine and 1/2 C boullion simmered on the stove until reduced by half then add 2 T cold butter -whisk 1 pat in at a time - add in garlic powder and salt and pepper to taste --  slice the roast into thin slices  and serve   with the roast

This is THE BEST recipe for a roast.  My family raved!  It is now "my signiture" roast!   I usually make my roast in the crockpot with veggies.  I love the ease of a slow cooker - this was just as easy......only difference is that you can't just dump and run.......but after you turn the oven off, your free as a bird!!!  I was worried that it wouldn't be crock pot tender, no worries anymore.  It was not shred able like a crock roast, but - IT TASTED LIKE PRIME RIB!!!!!! Perfect medium pink throughout. The best part is that this recipe very basic and you can 'jazz it up" according to your family's taste.

I followed the cook time exactly and it cooks it perfectly! I add a little salt, pepper, onion powder and garlic powder to the outside of the meat prior to cooking.

So easy! I follow the directions as stated and it comes out perfect every time. Very moist and full of flavor. I usually just use course salt and fresh cracked pepper, but tonight I tried a Hawaiian seasoning mix (salt, pepper, and ginger) -- wow!! It's a family favorite!

I've mad this several times using Montreal steak seasoning instead of salt and pepper, roasted as directed and cooled. I then sliced it on a meat slicer, thinly, for the best roast beef lunch meat imaginable.  Yum

This is going to be my ongoing new way to roast the beef.  Roasted the beef a little longer on the high temp.  We don't like the meat quite so red, then continued to roast it at 275 deg. for 3 hrs.

This was excellent. I had never used this type of meat so I was very nervous. My husband bought 7lbs chunk so I cooked it for 49 min and left it in the oven for 2 1/2 hours. One end was done the way we like (just a little pink part left) but the rest wasn't especially for my husband who likes it well done so I put it back in the oven and cooked it the same way for 14 minutes and left there for an hour. Done!  I also made the pan gravy  with 2 TBS meat drippings, 2 TBS flour, 1 cup water, and salt and pepper.  Slice it as thin as possible and it will melt in your mouth!

This is the ONLY way to make an eye roast. I buy the two pack at Costco and package/freeze each piece. I always make this on a Sunday in order to have my day to myself with literally minimal dinner-cooking time.  In summer you can throw together a salad  and in winter choose separately roasted root veggies or a simple side like rice. I like Montreal seasoning rubbed on the meat.

The only way to roast an eye roast! Comes out perfectly every time! (increase/decrease time for larger or smaller cuts) - I used a 4 pound roast,  coarse-cut a couple of carrots and onions  to prop up the meat from the pan (lined with foil for easy cleanup), seasoned the meat and let cook for 28 minutes, then let sit in oven for 3 hours -- cover and let rest for about 10 minutes and it is unbelievable!

This was FANTASTIC! I followed the advice of another who put a rub of garlic (whole clove mashed through garlic press) kosher salt, mixed up pepper(black pepper will do) ms Dash onion and herb, and some oil, only enough to make it like a paste..rub it all over the meat and follow the directions of preheat oven to 500 degrees, turn it to 475 when you put the meat in 7 min per lb. after that time is up, then turn it to lowest setting (170) at 12 min per lb. DO NOT OPEN THE OVEN!  Best pan drippings EVER! It smelled like I was making garlic bread. lol  The whole family LOVED this! Lots of flavor! P.S. The key is to slice it THIN! The thinner the better!

I always cook my roasts in a bag, but this looked interesting and it was buy one get one free on the eye of round roasts. We love our roasts medium rare and it can be hit or miss when I cook roasts. Well, with a family of very picky eaters I can let you know they ate the entire 3.25lb roast. You would have thought you were eating prime rib. No more bags for me!!!

Just made this and loved it. My roast ended up sitting for 2 days in the refrigerator, seasoned with salt and pepper and basted with  browning sauce, so I don't' know how much that changed things but it was very tasty. I sliced it and made French dip sandwiches, served with au jus.

First time making eye of roast, this recipe made the most perfect roast, juicy very tender and most importantly NOT chewy or dry, my kids loved it as well. I made gravy from what was left in bottom of pan by adding a little water and flour brought it to quick boil stirring constantly was delicious!

Absolutely AMAZING. I never review anything even when I love it but I just had to with this one. I was a little scared because of the mixed reviews and I have an older stove. Used salt, pepper and garlic left it marinating over night, cooked it for 25 minutes at 475 (I don't like med rare meat), waited an hour felt my stove and seen it was pretty cold so I put it on 150 for one more hour. Came out amazing. Melts in your mouth! When I get a new stove I will be trying the recipe as written. DON'T change ANYTHING you will not be disappointed

Perfect every time.  A larger piece of meat may be too rare in the middle for your taste, beware!   Be sure to slice it thinly and served best au jus.   Butternut squash and risotto are great accompaniments.   Yum!

Made this today and used this recipe, we love medium rare and this high temp recipe is one of the best ways I have found to get it right.  Ours was 3.04 pounds and I preheated to 500 degrees, BUT only for about 5 minutes, then reduced to 475.  It came out delicious but a bit too rare in the center of the roast which was about 6 inch diameter roast.  After reading thru a few of these, I'll try to preheat to 500 degrees about 20 minutes or so before placing the roast in to cook and reducing to 475.  It was seriously delicious.  Used balsamic, salt and lemon pepper on the exterior and it was great and not overpowering.  Enjoy!

I made the following adjustments:  preheated my convection oven to roast temp of 500 degrees. Coated roast with fresh ground black pepper, garlic salt and that's it.    Placed 4.0 lb roast in it for 32 minutes as we enjoy beef with just a touch of pink.  Set timer for 31 minutes as a compromise to the "medium" 28 minutes.  Removed the 4 lb roast after exactly 2.5 hours.  Still couldn't touch handles of roasting pan with bare hands.  Wrapped in foil and heated veggies and made pan gravy.  At that temp and a 1/2 cup beef stock I easily had 4c of gravy added ramikin of flour and water to thicken.  Terrific gravy from drippings due to high hear I am sure.  All visible fat prior to roasting was gone.  Used cuisinart carving knife to cut thin slices of beef.  Served with mashed potatoes, corn, and Parker house rolls.  Enough roast beef to feed my two teenage sons French dips for lunch.  Win win.  FYI, I do my Christmas prime rib the same way.  High heat and turn off.  However, I have a really good built in double convection oven.

Super simple and turned out great!  I didn't see anyone say how to cook two separate roasts at the same time (i.e. the way Costco packages them), so here's what I did.  I got a large cast iron skillet and put a layer of onions in the bottom.  Then I coated each roast in about a T of olive oil, followed by freshly ground sea salt and black pepper, and garlic powder.  I rubbed the spices all around the roast, but especially on the fat cap. I placed them in the skillet on top of the onions, leaving plenty of space between them.   I figure since they were about 2.5 lbs each that I could treat cooking two about the same as cooking one 3-lb roast.  So I put it in at 500 F, then to 475 F for 21 minutes.  I then turned the oven off.  After one hour I checked the oven and it was only at 170 degrees so I set it on 180 and turned it off again as soon as it reached temperature.  

After two hours hours with the oven mostly off, I pulled the roasts out and covered the whole pan with foil for 20 minutes before removing the roasts and onions for slicing and serving.   I then used the drippings (which there were a lot of) to make gravy.  The gravy was amazing, the roast was tender and juicy.  Everyone liked it best super thin, almost shaved.

I have been making this for a few years now and it has always come out fantastic...I do try different rubs instead of the salt...Have also used different cuts of meat and it is always good...Got a mock tenderloin in the oven now and my mouth is already watering...My first review but this is a recipe I am truly passionate about....

Wow! Amazing results, I followed the instructions exactly, and I can't believe how soft and juicy the meat was! I made a paste with fresh garlic, salt, whole peppercorns, Italian seasoning and olive oil, and rubbed it all over the meat before roosting. Really great flavour! 
I created an account on this site just so I could rate this recipe, that's how good it was. Def will be making this again

I was skeptical about this cooking method, a 9 lb roast at stake, and no backup if it flopped. Well, THIS WAS AWESOME! I took a chance. PERFECT! So easy. I'll admit, it was tempting to open the oven door a few times just to check, but I didn't.  Only used salt, pepper, and granulated garlic. I did lay the roast on a bed of sliced onions, as I usually do meats when roasting like this. Keeps the bottom from sticking. I've used non-stick alum. foil, but, with a non-stick pan, this works great. The au jus was fantastic too. At 7 min per lb, mine was a perfect medium. I figure I'd reduce it to 5.5 or 6 per lb and see where that gets me. Awesome as is though. This is a keeper.

I cooked it in an electric stove.  For the remaining 2 hours I kept the temperature at 170 as one in my family doesn't like pink meat.  It still was pink but delicious.  I cooked it without vegetables at first.   To solve the pink, I put it in a cast iron Dutch oven, cut up 2 onions and some carrots, put it back in a 350 degree oven for an hour.  It was perfectly done, juicy, and tender.  I'd only ever cooked with chuck roasts, but after this experience, I'd definitely cook thus again. I seasoned it with Tony's as I'm from Louisiana.

I had a two pound eye of round. I tried the above recipe and when I pulled out the roast it was 112.7 degrees. So I started the oven at 375 degrees, put a temp probe in the roast and set it for 130. I like medium rare. It took about an additional 20-25 minutes to get to 130. I rested it for 10 minutes as I was hungry. I cut the  first two slices and it was great looking and was tender as advertised. So if you have problems with the roast not being up to 145 degrees, which is way over medium rare, then you can continue to cook it till the degrees you like. No problem. This recipe to me is 4 3/4. Luckly I don;t like 145 temp for roasts, so it worked out great from me to get it to 130 as I like it.

It could not be easier. It could not be better. Did a 4.3lb roast, came out perfect - the leftovers are great too.  The gravy - OMG good - (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/chef-johns-mushroom-gravy/).  For a while I was in my mom & dad's kitchen - not a better place to be.

My husband and 2 year old loved this.  I followed the recipe, except for adding some onion powder and paprika to the rub.  Since I had a 2 pound roast I cooked it 14 minutes.  Turned out perfect.  I've been a vegetarian for 15 years and still am, but my son has multiple food allergies, including milk, eggs and legumes, so I've just started learning to cook meat for him.  The ease of this recipe was perfect for me!

had a 3.5 lb roast patted with Fall River rub and garlic slivers inserted.  Next time wait to put on seasonings until right before you put in the oven. Heated oven at 500 for twenty minutes and then pot in roast for 19 mins at 475 and shut off oven. Took out after 2 hours. We were disappointed in that it was really medium well with just a few traces of pink. It was tasty and not tough but definitely not rare like the picture.  And we wanted rare. This may be our oven or the fact the rack we used elevated the roast to right under the heating element and burned the garlic slices we put in.  Next time try 7 mins a pound and then turn off oven for an hour and a half. Will try again.

Fantastic recipe.  My best advice is to know your oven.  Since we don't usually cook at such high heat, few of us have tested the outer limits, and this takes a leap of faith.  I know next time to drop the high heat cooking to 5 minutes a pound in my oven because we like our meat medium rare.  How your oven retains heat is important. I was afraid it would be undercooked based on reviews, but my WOLF professional works well.  There was NOTHING left for sandwiches!  Also used an A1 dry rub on the outside - the house smelled like a steakhouse!

I tried the recipe as stated and it was not done. Right now, my roast is back in the oven so it can cook to an edible temperature. It's most likely necessary to keep the oven on at 200 degrees to help cook the meat so it can actually be eaten.

This is my first roast beef and i took the courage to try on this method "High Temperature Roast Beef". I am having a 5.2 lb eye of round beef and set the temperature to 500F (260c)for 35 min. I was eager to turn off the oven much earlier as it generated lots of smokes during the process. I keep holding it and shut off the oven immediately after 35 min and keep the roast in the oven for 2.5 hrs. The results really surprise us. Mid well with nice center pink and very juicy.Thank you very much.

I've tried this recipe and it's delicious! I was wondering if you could use other types of roasts with this recipe... Like a sirloin tip? Also, would you use this cooking method for a 10lb roast? Maybe roasting at 500 for 70 min would be too long? I'm kind of new to cooking so any help would be appreciated :)

Only changes I have made are to add salt and pepper and let sit overnight and to cut small slits in the roast to add sliced garlic cloves. I make more than I think we will need and use leftovers for sandwiches and chill

Unbelievable!! I had a round roast and was sick of crock pot roasts and tough oven roasts. I tried this assuming it would be burnt on the outside and raw or dried out on the inside. Boy was I wrong!! The BEST round roast I have ever had! Wow, who knew!!

Loved it.  Easiest roast ever.  Usually, my oven roasts are too tough and  crock pot too tender - falls apart.  This was perfect.  Very tender, but easy to cut.  Looked like roast from caterer.  I was nervous about oven being off for that long so halfway through, I turned it back on low (175 as another person recommended).  A little pink for my family and lukewarm, but perfect for me so I sliced off some for the cats and me, then put back in oven on 350 for about 20 minutes to make hotter and less pink.  Still very tender. Family loved it.

I do tweak this recipe, but the basics are the same. I make a paste using 1T olive oil,  1T kosher salt, 1/4tsp black pepper, 1/2t rosemary, 1/2t dried thyme. Cover the roast with the paste (top, bottom, both ends) and I cook just as directed. I have never had a bad roast using this method!

I used a 5 lb roast and thought it had a lot of flavour. Not as tender as I would have liked and a little to pink for my liking.  I roasted at the indicated temperature for 40 minutes and then turned the oven off and left in the oven another 3 hours.  Next time I will add another five minutes to the roasting time at 475 and leave in the oven for 3 hours. The gravy was amazing.  My guests thought the roast was delicious.

Loved it! My first time making a roast beef. After reading several recipes, I came back to this unusual recipe, especially reading that the rib eye cut can tend to be on the tougher side. I thought to myself, how can I go wrong when all but one gave it a 5 star. Sorry SBelle, maybe something wrong with your oven. Besides the s&p, I coated mine with olive oil and sprinkled garlic powder all over. My husband and I were quite impressed with the outcome. For the chew factor, very important to slice it very thin. We tried a piece slightly thicker and found it to be better on the thinnest slice.  The taste was also quite delicious, I must say. We were so impressed that I am going to cook a larger one for Thanksgiving and bring it over to my Host for dinner.

We did this a week ago and are doing it again tonight. It is amazing, of course you really can't use your oven but probably putting potatos in with the roase would work, going to try that tonight.

I expected a lot from this recipe based on so many positive reviews. I followed to recipe exactly, and the meat was still tough. I must say the 'done-ness' was perfect (medium rare), but I won't bother with this again.

OMG I like everyone else was skeptical of this recipe. Let me tell you it is as good as everyone says. I made a mixture of butter, garlic, salt, pepper and rosemary and rubbed it all over the roast. Delicious, moist and well flavored. A winner!

I found the roast to be VERY tough. It was juicy, and it was the right amount of pinkness, so I don't think it had to do with the amount I cooked it or the method. It just didn't tenderize at all. :(

I had a top round roast, at 3.5 lbs. Looking for a way to cook this I found this recipe. Following the recipe and adding some thyme, rosemary, paprika to the seasoning. This came out perfect. Some where near medium rare, maybe just a bit more medium. I will be using this method for now on.

THE BEST. EASY. TENDER. The only difference I did was leave it in the heated oven about 15 mins longer before shutting it off. PERFECT. This is the only way I cook a roast now.

This recipe always produces a juicy and tender roast It is fool proof! I have an old gas oven that doesn't hold the heat, so I leave my oven on 200- 225 instead of turning the oven off, and the roast always cooks just perfectly!

A REAL WINNER!  The roast I bought seemed really tough, because I had the hardest time getting my meat thermometer in it; I was afraid I would snap it.  I followed the recipe as written, calculating the correct minutes by multiplying the weight by 7 minutes.  I also rubbed some baked potatoes in butter and wrapped them in foil and put them in the oven as well.  The meat was not up to temperature at the end of the roasting time, maybe because of the baked potatoes.  I heated the oven to 325 and threw my green bean casserole in with all of it.  I baked in 10 minute increments to check the internal temperature.  After 20 minutes, it was all ready.  The roast was quite rare at one end, but the meat was amazingly tender and delicious.  The potatoes were the lightest, fluffiest bakers I've ever had, and the skins were soft and yummy.  I will definitely use this recipe again, including the baked potatoes and green bean casserole.  My family loved it.

Thanks so much for this. Its was very tender and the juices released were perfection. My oven has poor insulation though so i had to keep the heat about 150 for the  2 1/2 hours.

I've made this about 4 times and each time it's a crowd pleaser.  It's a fool proof way to cook an eye of round.  The trick afterwards is to slice it ultra thin, I have good success with my electric knife or a fishing filet knife.

The whole family loved this recipe!  It really is the best recipe for eye round.  The meat texture is the best of any eye round recipe that I have tried...and there is a nice selection of done ness...meaning the ends get nice and well done and the inside is a perfect medium for my daughter who doesn't do well done!!  All I do is salt pepper and garlic powder on the outside...and it makes a great gravy also...all in all a great find!!

I tried this tonight with a 2.82 lb eye round roast.  I just took it out of the oven after 2.5 hours.  I cooked it precisely as the directions stated, adjusting the time in the 475 degree oven for the ever-so-slightly reduced weight.  The temp showed as 120.  Very difficult to correct that with passive heat I've just let dissipate in pulling it out.

Amazing.  The house didn't get all heated up and the roast beef was the most tender and juicy and done to perfection.  I did it for a little less time to make sure it was medium and it was just delicious.  Made the best birthday dinner for my other half.  Go figure, turn the oven off.  I also did a separate pan with roasted potatoes and put it in the same time & they were perfect.  I did add olive oil to those.

I have tried this kind of roast cooking for prime rib only in the past.  This method worked fantastic for this lower cost cut of beef.  I can't say it was "tender", but cut the slices thin, and it is fabulous for flavour.   For 1/4 the price of high end cuts, it's more than a great substitute, & don't be shy to serve to company!   .  Cooked to perfection med rare according to recipe!  Leftovers are going to be great sandwiches or hot beefI I put the raw roast in a zip-loc  with seasoning of S&P, Lawrey's, onion flakes & Worcestershire sauce, marinating for a few hours in advance, &  I wouldn't be shy to over-season more to your taste preferences.  It's all a matter of taste.  Definitely will keep this in the arsenal of my favourites and it won't kill the budget.

I was skeptical when I saw this.  Having been comfortable in a kitchen for over 45 years, thought I had seen it all.  But I just had to try.  Coated the roast with that Steak Seasoning from Montreal :) and followed directions exactly as written.  A perfect roast!  Can't believe it.  Best one I've ever made.  Highly recommend and it couldn't be easier.

I tried this with a 2.7 lb roast, an electric oven and a lot of skepticism. The meat did turn out incredibly tender and juicy for a eye of round. I cut an onion into large chunks and put it under the grid supporting the roast, with some home grown garlic. The fat drippings made the onions heavenly. The roast itself I rubbed with fresh thyme, cracked black pepper, celery seeds and then brushed it with peanut oil. 
No salt as it would draw moisture out of the roast. Additionally, I attempted to bake potatoes alongside the roast. The ones I used were small, about 3 inches in diameter. You will be pleased to know they turned out perfect. The reason I only put 4 stars is that, judging by my experience, the timing of the recipe is not flawless. When I decided to checked on it after 2h, The meat was cooked nice and pink, but the temperature had went back down to 120°F - it wouldn't have cooked more, only kept cooling down. By the time I had it sliced (1/8" thin with a slicer,) it was only luke warm. I had to layer it on a cookie sheet and shock it a bit in the oven in order to serve a warm meal to my friends. I'll definitely do this again, but next time I'll cook it 8 minutes / pound rather than 7, and then leave it only 1h30 rather than 2h30.

Very good recipe!  It was easy and worked well.  I had a 2.3 lb. eye of round so I cooked it for 14 min. then turned off the oven for 2.5 hours.  My wife got impatient, so I took it out with 15 minutes left.  It was exactly 145 degrees, which is medium rare.  I am going to get an oven safe meat thermometer so I can track the temp next time.  I like to get it to around 125 or 130, then take it out to rest.

I should have known better. When I saw that the end temperature was going to be one hundred and 45°, I should've known better. To me the way I like my beef which is medium-rare is about  one hundred and 25° because the temperature will continue to increase while resting.  145° isn't anybody's idea of rare except for the department of agriculture who want to make sure we don't die from some disease which is not not present anymore in the US. Especially if you start off with an oven temperature of 500°, 140° is ruined.   I pulled  mine an hour and a half early, and it was still ruined. By that time it was already across 140°

Great recipe! I highly recommend brushing the roast with Gravy Master and using Snider's Prime Rib & Roast Seasoning along with Garlic Powder to season the roast prior to cooking. Absolutely delicious; both my husband and I can't wait to eat the leftovers!!

Absolutely amazing!  If you don't like rare, it's not for you.  Crazy excellent roast.  Only used sea salt, cracked black pepper, and garlic powder.  I'd give this over five stars!

Gas oven!  Wish I would have read the review from the person with the poorly insulated gas oven before I waiting the 2 1/2 hours...my oven was stone cold and my roast was extremely rare on the inside.  Next time, I will keep the oven on 200 degrees  for the 2 1/2 hours.

I believe this recipe was a bit too simplistic.  My 7 pound USDA CHOICE roast turned out a bit too well done for our liking (which also made it less tender than it should have been.)  This would have been avoidable if I had, had a thermometer with a cord that I could read outside of the oven. Unfortunately, this method does not allow you to use a standard thermometer until the time is up.  I dutifully kept the door shut with just a hope and prayer. I highly recommend people to make a purchase of the corded type thermometer if using this method. Ovens vary, (I am starting to think my oven runs hotter than it registers.) thicknesses of roasts vary,(mine was a long slender roast) and even the marbling of the meats vary and affect cooking time.  If you like your roasts rare to medium rare, you will want to know the temp of the meat. All in all, I can't complain. I'm not saying this is a bad recipe or that my roast was total flop.  It was quite good, if you like your meat medium to medium WELL.

I tried this last weekend and I was surprised how tender it came out. My husband commented that the meat would be good for french dip. I bought another roast this weekend just for making sandwiches. Both times, I rubbed the roast with olive oil and Canadian Steak Seasoning.

OMG. It was absolutely perfect.  I put three little slits in my roast and slid some garlic in them.  I was always afraid of eye round because of the toughness. Great recipe. Thank you

Eye round was a favorite in my family.  Mom's dad had been chef at Waldorf-Astoria 1920's-1930's.  First came upon this hi heat recipe in a Craig Claiborne collection.  A beautifully lean cut comes out scrumptious.  Of course we slice it thin.  Uncle who was a SIL to the chef usually did the carving.  I watched and learned to carve roasts, too.

Eye round was on sale this week so I googled a recipe.  We have had this cut before and it was very tough.   When I found this recipe, I was skeptical.  Sounded too easy.   I cooked it exactly per the directions and it was DELICIOUS!   It was cooked perfectly and was so juicy.   We sliced it almost paper thin and my husband couldn't believe it was an eye round.  Thank you for the recipe . . . it is now a family favorite.

My fiance is a beef guy. He knows what he likes and that's that. He wanted an eye of round roast. I wasn't sure what to do with it. But we bought a 5.2 pounder.I cut it about in half. Rubbed some steak seasoning we have on it. Added salt and pepper. I saw someone recommended cooking with the fat side up to baste it as it melts. So I did. I followed directions as far as cooking time. Turned it off, went to the store. Came back. It was great! He kept commenting on how good that roast was!" All through the night he made comments. "Wow, your roast was amazing. I really liked that roast! "We need to have that again!"

I usually find round roasts tough and flavorless, its a cut of meat that I rarely buy because of that. I ended up buying a few on sale and decided to try this recipe as written. I have to admit, I was very skeptical about the results. To my amazement, the roast turned out a perfect pink, tender, delicious and full of flavor! This has to be the best round roast I have ever tasted! I am going to try this method on other cuts of beef as well. Thanks for such an easy and amazing recipe!

I followed the directions with a 3lb roast and it didnt make it to the 145.  After 2 1/2 hours of waiting it only reached a temp of 115.  I never opened the oven and have no idea as to why this didnt work.  I was very disappointed in the recipe since my entire meal was ready except for the meat.  I wont use this again. OH and by the way, I have a brand new gas oven with no insulation problems

I had a 4.14 lb roast and had it in the oven at 475 for 29 minutes and then it was in the turned off oven for 3 1/2 hours because I got busy and forgot it was there.  It was still very rare for everything except the ends.  I cooled it well, sliced it thin and refrigerated it overnight.  The next day I add some au jus to the pan, covered it and put it in a warm 200 degree oven for about 1 1/2 hours.  I used salt, pepper, thyme, garlic powder, onion powder, and smoked paprika as seasoning.  The flavor of the meat was really good but it just was not tender.  I can't give it less than a 4 star because I adjusted the cooking times and that may have toughened the meat up.  I also used commercial beef because I ran out of my grass fed beef.  I will try it again when I get my next side of beef in.

I cooked thisexacly as recipe suggested for my family. The roast was wonderful. When my grandchildren (ages 5 and 8) left to go home, they grabed several slices and left with them in hands. I thought my daugher would fuss at them but instead she grabbed on too. There was only enough left to make one sandwich.

It came out a little more done than I prefer, because I used a thermometer. I added about 30 minutes of cooking time @ 200 degrees to try getting the temperature to 145. Time for a new thermometer.
It's very tasty, and will make a killer roast beef poorboy, with the pan gravy on it.

This recipe was a real hit in my household tonight! I have made "Roast Beef" before but have always played Russian roulette with it in terms of roasting times. My family likes their meat medium where as I prefer to have it medium well. Tonight I prepared my top round roast with a dry rub that consisted of garlic powder, sea-salt, black pepper and red pepper. I place the roast on a bed of sliced onions in a roasting pan (on a rack) with about 1.5 cups of beef stalk at the bottom (I did this for moisture and to make the pan easier to clean at the end). I preheated the oven (a 10+ year old electric oven) to 500 degrees and decreased to 475 degrees once preheated. I cooked the roast for 23 minutes (it was just under 3.5lbs) and shut off the oven for 1 hour. At about 1 hour I turned the oven back on to 200 degrees for an additional hour. I then removed the roast from the oven and covered for about 15 minutes before carving. Everything worked out perfect! The meat was perfect all the way through (medium well on the ends and a perfect medium in the center) and this was a concern as I did not purchase the best cut (about a $11 roast from my local market). I will definitely try this again -  my family compared this to prime rib! AMAZED!

I was skeptical, but I gave this one a shot. I used a beef loin, I had to cut it in half to make it fit in the pan, because that's what I had in the freezer. Since I cut it in half it came out to 2 3lb. pieces, so I used the cooking times for a 3lb. roast. Did the initial cooking before I left for church and turned off the oven before leaving. Came back 4 hours later and pulled it out of the oven. The outside looked like it had a dry crust on it, but when I started slicing it, HEAVEN!!! The beef loin tasted/looked like prime rib and was tender enough to cut with a fork. I want to try this again in a dutch oven and cover it after the initial cooking to see if that keeps the outside from drying out. Thanks for posting this one!!!

I love this recipe! I have made it several times with a 6-7 pound roast. I usually usually do a little bit less than 7 minutes a pound as we like it a bit rare. It has worked every time.

Love this recipe. Easy, inexpensive & my children love it. Medium rare perfect, tender & tasty. Sliced really thin it is also great for sandwich meat after. Didn't believe it at first,,,,,,thought I was taking a big chance. Was glad to be wrong.

Excellent! I read rooj's note about not having a tight fitting oven & we don't either so I also left the oven on low instead of shutting it off.  It did get a little dried out on just the outside but I think that is because I did leave it on a little too long.  Will do more "by the book" next time.  Regardless, the inside was moist and very "prime rib" like. Sooooo good!  This recipe is so easy & good I will be making it many times.  (I added a little au jus after it was done & horseradish sauce.. omg... restaurant worthy!)

I made this tonight - followed the recipe exactly with a 3.5 lb top round.  After reading all these reviews I expected it to be pretty tender, but after my first bite I couldn't help a big "wow"  -- it was so good, not chewy at all.  And there was lots of au jus in the pan to put over the slices.  This is one amazing recipe!!!!

Delicious and easy as pie! I made a wet rub with some kosher salt, granulated onion and garlic and a splash of Worcestershire sauce. Cooked the 3# roast for 35 minutes at 475. After slicing, looked just like the photos. Mmmm!

made this and it was fine...but I think you really need to keep the oven on really low instead of off....my roast was a bit too rare and the meat wasn't hot enough to serve. Some folks claimed it was their ovens but my oven is new and higher end. Also I added lots of extra seasoning.

Yummy!  I was a bit hesitant to try this recipe, but I am so thrilled that I did.  It was excellent!  I can honestly say that my eye of round looked like a picture!  My husband was thrilled, as I normally overcook eye of round.  Thanks for sharing!!

I guess I'm one of the unlucky ones with a dud oven even though it's electric. I followed to the letter with a 3 lb.roast. But the inside never got over 130 degrees. 

Would love to try this recipe again as I think it may work, but would like to hear what to do if your oven just doesn't retain the heat like the author's obviously does.

I have used this recipe twice so far and the meat turns out really moist and tasty. I generally tenderize the meat by using a vinegar or citric based marinade.  I follow the directions as above, except we like our meat a little more well done.  I do turn the oven off after roasting the 7min per lb, however after about 60 minutes I turn the oven on to 250 and cook for 30 minutes.  At that point I check the internal temp.  I usually take it out when the temp reaches 150.  I then let it rest for 15 minutes.

i dont cook beef very often, and cant remember when i last cooked a roast. eye round was on sale, put it in the freezer.  too big for just us.  i called some friends, then got my recipe book out.discovered this was a tough cut of meat....decided to try the internet.  found this.  was intrigued. figured we could have pizza as a back up plan.  it was FABULOUS. everyone LOVED it. tender, tasty.  THANK YOU.

Turned out great!!  Was surprised too by leaving the oven off for so long...it was a little cool when I served it so next time, I think I'll warm it up before serving.  I had a 4.65 lb. roast, preheatead oven to 500 and then cooked for 32 mins. on 475 and let sit for 2 1/2 hrs. in oven and 20 mins. out of the oven with foil over it.  I do suggest making a gravy which I did have and made.  Otherwise, I think it would have been a little dry.  Made baked potatoes and broccoli and cheese with it.  Yummy dinner and definitely a keeper!!!!  Thanks for sharing!

Amazing!  Who'd have guessed an eye of round could be so tender, moist and tasty.  I had a small roast and, because we like our beef fairly rare, I cut the time at 475 to 6 minutes per pound.  The roast was perfectly done, medium rare.  The juices were plentiful.  I could have made a wonderful gravy, but served the thin slices au jus...to rave reviews.

I was a little scared to try this, despite all of the positive reviews.  I've now made it 3 or 4 times the exact same way because people keep asking me to make it again.  Everyone who's tried it has loved it.  I use a different seasoning mix (paprika, salt, pepper, garlic powder, cayenne, oregano and thyme...add olive oil to make a paste and rub into the roast) but the cooking method is spot-on.  Just make sure to slice the meat as thin as possible...this helps keep it tender.
UPDATE:  I've started leaving it in the oven for only 2 hours after the cook time instead of the full 2 1/2 because I typically like my meat closer to medium rare.  WONDERFUL!

The reviews on this recipe made me think it guaranteed even with the style of cooking that was quite different than usual. However this did not work for us.  It was cold, tough and raw.  I know it wasn't the quality because we only purchase top quality organic grassfed beef and have not had any problems with any other cuts. I have seen other reviews that did not have success question the use of a gas stove which is what we have I don't know if that was the cause...

I prepared a 2lb eye round roast just as you suggested...only 14 minutes at 475. It was perfect. I think cutting it thin is important too. My husband took seconds which was a first! Now I want to try this method on a really good cut of meat to see if it melts in my mouth!

Was simple - but way over-cooked.  Pretty much grey throughout.  Could be because I used grass-fed beef, which is a lot leaner than conventional beef?

I've used this technique several times, all with success. Brushed with a homemade browning sauce (basically brown sugar heated just to point of melting burning and beef broth cooked down to half), sprinkled with favorite seasoning salt and fresh black pepper. Fat side up and followed the times adjusted for size of roast. I did leave the oven at 500 degress for initial period. Rest for 15-20 minutes. Medium rare, very tender, and juicy. Easy carving.

I am using this recipe tonight for a second time.

I have read some unfavorable reviews and the only comment that I may have is that my oven has a covered element which holds the heat & continues to cook even when the oven has been turned off.

Another comment is that I do own an oven thermometer that has a probe placed into the meat and then a thermometer that sits on the counter and I can see the internal temp.

I paint the roast with olive oil, add salt & pepper & use the Tastefully Simple Spices Onion Onion & Garlic Garlic.  Its outstanding.

I've used this recipe many times previously with a round roast. Tonight I tried on a small rib roast because whenever I made prime rib it never tastes like when you get a restaurant and not worth the extra money. This time is was worth it. Just seasoned with freshly ground salt and pepper, little onion powder. My rib roast was only 2# so I roasted at 475 for 14 minutes then down to 225 for an hour then back to 375 for 20 minutes to get the roast hot. INCREDIBLE!! "Like butter!" Thanks Lyn for a great recipe!

Followed directions exactly except that I let the oven stay off for 2 hours and then for the last half hour turned it back on at 325 for 30 minutes.  Came out perfect medium rare and tender!  Next had roast beef sandwiches on french bread with aujus sauce.  FANTASTIC....hubby raved about it all.

I was unsure about the recipe but always willing to try new things I went for it, It was the best eye round roast I ever made! I did cheat a little cause I was unable to walk away from conventional thinking and turned the stove on 1 hour into the wait time and brought temp back up to 350 and shut stove off again, I also did this 30 min before i removed from oven, as a result of my tampering the roast was a little more done than i would have liked but was still awesome! I made with a rub of garlic salt, fresh pepper and paprika and served with an Au Jus sauce, there were no leftovers

I tried this recipe last week and it was a complete hit with my husband and myself.  This was so easy and really effortless, juicy and delicious.  I served it with horseradish sauce, mashed potatoes and vegetable.  I will make this more often, especially for a dinner party, and pass this on to friends and family. - Helen

I had a 6 pound roast.  This recipe was good, but not great.  I love searing our meats on the the outside, and though there was a nice crust on top, it did not sear on the sides.  It was also more done than we'd like (per recipe, this cooks to medium - slightly pink in the center.)  I love the idea of letting the roast sit in the oven to cook, however, so will tweak the timing and perhaps bump up to 500 from 475.

Got a little spooked by all the smoke. After 45 minutes (6 pounder) I was worried about only being at 95 degrees. So I let it ride at 225 for an additional 30 min. Was pretty good but must admit I slightly overdid it. Would ease off on that extra time and try again.

Really good way to cook.  The McCormick seasoning packet used seemed to be a little spicy for the kids.  I think it was peppercorn and garlic.  Others seemed to really like the Montreal flavor so I might try that next time.

I made roast beef last night using the same method as this recipe.  It was the first time I tried it and my husband LOVED IT!  I had to leave the roast a little longer in the oven but as we did not have a set time for supper it did not matter.  I did marinate the roast for most of the day to add more taste but cooked exactly as this recipe.  I am not a big fan of roast beef but am looking forward to making beef and barely soup from the left overs.  Thank you for this recipe.

I was extremely skeptical about this recipe after learning the eye round cut was very tough and typically used to make jerky. However, I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of the seasonings, I made my own rub with a little bit of this and a little bit of that, the roast came out AMAZING! It was perfectly cooked throughout, well done on the ends right down to a medium rare middle. It saved my dinner party!

I have made this roast many times and it always comes out perfectly cooked. I do however season my roast first. Rub with a bit of XVO and use Italian seasoning as well as S&P.

Awesome recipe! My new favorite way to cook beef, beats my old favorite meal of pot roast. Can't screw it up. My oven doesn't hold the heat well so I leave it on between 180 - 200 degrees for 2 1/2 - 3 hours after the initial high heat. Last time I made it had to hold it a bit longer so I just turned the oven off and let it rest in there for another hour, and then on the counter for 20 minutes. It was at 155 degrees and I was afraid it would be dry and over done. To my surprise it was great, very moist and juicy. Still pink, but not red, just perfect for my kids, who hate rare meat. I had seasoned it with the browning sauce, per another suggestion, and my usual steak seasoning blend of seasoning salt, garlic powder, onion powder and pepper.

I made this with a bit of wonder and it turned out perfect. I've been also looking for a good way of cooking a beef roast so i could make thin slice sandwich meat and this was exactly what I wanted.

This is soon easy and works every single time. You must read the recipe and make sure that you have the correct pounds to time ratio! Otherwise you could end up with a tough over cooked mess.  Likewise if you peak than it won't get cooked.  Every oven is different so I wouldn't trying to make this when you have a deadline just in case your oven has a problem retaining heat.

Cooked according to recipe.  I failed to put anything on the roast so it was just a little bland.  Definitely juicy and tender; will try again and rub down with seasonings.  Very easy and hubby loved it.

I followed the recipe, and according to all of the other reviews felt it was a "must-try"...however, my husband or myself did not taste a difference in taste or tenderness, I will definitely go back to the way I usually cook my roasts in water/stock and seasoned in a covered roasting pan. Not impressed! Sorry...

Excellent Recipe. I've been a butcher for 15 yrs and always told my customers this way of cooking this roast and its a great way to do a rib roast . Also ask your butcher to tie the roast with butcher twine this will help lock in the juices of the meat.

I followed the recipe exactly and the meat was way overdone and chewy.  Very disappointing.  
I'm not sure if others' ovens don't have too good of a seal, but mine stayed hot after I turned it off.  I was skeptical, but trusted the recipe and all of the rave reviews and left the roast in the oven.  
Please use the meat thermometer and take it out as soon as it reaches the temp!

Who knew making a roast was so easy!  This has become one of my go-to weeknight meals - always a hit with the family and the left-overs are just as good as the original meal.  Have played with the seasoning a bit - found our family prefers it when I use Vegeta as a dry rub.

I was skeptical about turning off the oven but I'm glad I did. The 5-lb. roast I made came out a little more done than I prefer (it was perfect if you like medium), but it was still juicy and good. I cooked it at 475° for 35 minutes and left it in for 2.5 hours as directed. Next time I'll take it out of the oven earlier. I seasoned it with coarse sea salt, cracked pepper, a package of Lipton onion soup mix and some fresh chopped parsley. Great flavor! I added a cornstarch slurry and flour to the juices and cooked up some wonderful gravy.

My husband found this recipe and wanted me to try it. I was very doubtful, it seemed too simple and I was expecting it to be flavorless. It was really very good! I've made this 3 or 4 times since finding the recipe. We love it sliced up in sandwiches.

Didn't like how raw this was.  It was tender because it was to rare.  Won't be using this recipe again.  I even put the thermostat on a low setting and still it was bloody.

I thought this would be tricky since I'm not great with meat and my oven is finnicky but I followed the directions (and the comment to baste with browning gravy from the orange labeled bottle) and this was QUITE delicious! I served it with a sauce made from 3/4 cups sour cream, 2 tablespoons of prepared horseradish, 1 chopped chive stalk, and garlic poweder and salt to taste. What a dish! Thanks for sharing!

I just made a 5.8 pound eye like this, but I used 275F for 4 hours after the 500F for 50min. 
It came out like the most expensive roastbeef, the tender of the round I could not belive the result. Wife loved it and so did I.

Thanks Lyn B.

I made this last night for my family. It's very easy to make and really fast. The only thing I added was, a gravy made out of the drippings. Went great with the meat and potatoes.

I tried it with bottom round.  I had a lot of success with the eye of round so I thought I would give it a shot.  It came out really good!  I just use montreal steak seasoning and follow the directions to a tee.  Perfect!

This was really good. I had never made a roast before, so I was nervous, but it came out pretty well. I used a 2.62 lb roast and kept it in the oven for 18 minutes. It came out medium-rare, but I prefer medium, so I think next time I will do 9 or 10 mins per pound rather than 7 mins per pound. It was really easy though and I think it's a great recipe for a first-timer.

This method worked great.  Effortless.  Erred on this first attempt on side of medium versus rare.  Came out slightly more done than I prefer, but still quite tender for this Walmart special where I rarely buy beef.  Used Montreal steak seasoning all over.  I did, however, put masking tape around the oven door to keep the curious and hungry from letting the heat out.

Wow - this roast is fantastic! I've shared this recipe with several girlfriends, it has come out perfectly for all of us. I served it with the horseradish cream sauce (another recipe) for Christmas dinner. Hubby said it was the best dinner I made in 15 years of marriage. Again - wow! I made it exactly as written.

I tried this method of cooking the eye of the round. It was a disaster. My roast didn't reach 100 degdrees after 2.5 hours. Either my oven is really off temp or I read the directions wrong. Neither is true. Wouldn't do this again. My dinner was over an over late.

Followed the directions exactly and couldn't have been more pleased.  Added whole cloves of garlic to the roast then salt and pepper and put it into the oven for 2 1/2 hours.  WONDERFUL.  Thanks!!

this was incredible!  The only change that I made was to rub chopped garlic on the roast before cookinbg.  The cut I used was very lean so there were no drippings.  When I took it out of the oven, I was afraid it would be dry, but it was just the opposite--incredibly moist and juicy!  All of the kids loved it including the ones who are not big meat eaters!

I was skeptical with the turning off of the oven but the 2.5lb roast came out very juicy though just a little bit more rare than I like my roasts done so I will just adjust it next time around. Also, I found the meat was just luke warm at the end of the cooking time and needed to be warmed up in the microwave for a minute. I altered the recipe in that I marinated the meat overnight and that added very nice flavour. I will definitely make this again but will increase the roasting time prior to turning off the oven.

i dont know what happened but the meat was cold after the 2 1/2 hours of leaving it in the oven shut off. i followed the recipe exactly, even had a 3 pound roast. i think if i followed the advice of one of the reviewers and only left it in for 1 to 1 1/2 hours it would have been ok. tasted good but cold

I did everything exactly as the recipe called for and my roast came out tough.  It had the lovely reddish pink color that I prefer in my roast beef and steak, but was not tender.  So, to save dinner, I got out my slicer and sliced it very thin.  I will try this again and hopefully it will come out better next time.

This recipe is my new favorite roast! I jazzed up the rub by adding chili pepper, cumin, paprika, garlic powder and celery seeds and the finished product was to die for! I also took the leftovers and sliced the meat as thin as possible to make deli sandwiches for the rest of the week. For 4 dollars a pound, it sure beats buying deli roast beef and it tastes even better than the store. Next time I might have to make all of it into sandwich slices because the leftovers went so fast.

I absolutely love this recipe.  I've made it twice since I found the recipe and both times, the meat turned out great.

This was so delicious! Of course I seasoned it to what I was preparing and it was my hubby's favorite part of the meal! I made the roast Middle Eastern style *salivates* I rubbed the meat down with 2 tbsp soy sauce, 1 1/2 tbsp olive oil, 1 tsp marsala, 1 tsp cumin, 1 tsp cinnamon, salt, and pepper. Heat a large skillet to a lil more than medium high. Once the pan gets real hot sear all sides of the meat. First on the fatty side then brown the rest. I followed the rest of the recipe and the meat was so tender and juicy!!! Like I said, my hubby's favorite roast now (and mine), that's awesome. ^.^

I had never cooked this cut of beef, when I found two large roasts on sale I thought what the heck, I'll give it a try. I followed the directions exactly, and it's a good thing as we had guests coming over...both roasts were perfect, looked just like the picture. THANKS FOR THE RECIPE!

I never leave a review for anything but this recipe is so easy and delicious it deserves one!  I use garlic salt instead of plain salt and like someone suggested place roast fat side up so juice can run over meat as it cooks.  Another tip:  Sam's has this meat at a reasonable price everyday!

I will never cook my roast another way again. My mother thought I was crazy cooking my roast this way but it turned out PERFECT! I added a pinch of salt, a sprinkle of pepper throughout, and just shook on my regular meat seasonings, garlic powder, onion powder, italiano and or steak spice, then patted some minced garlic over top and cooked it exactly as directed. Everyone LOVED it. It was a tiny crispy on the outside, a bit pink and wonderfully juicy on the inside but cooked just right! This is a keeper!

I wanted so much for this to be perfect.  The only variation I made was to add onion and garlic powder.  I used a 4 pound roast and started at 500 degrees, the whole thing. But it was well done and although it tasted great, I was looking forward to medium rare. Next time I'll adjust the times and hope that works.

Super easy recipe, but after the 2.5 hrs the roast platued at 128 degrees (I used a 2.25lb roast).  I had to add 15-20min. to the cook time at 350 degrees and to bring the temp to 137.  The meat did turn out tender and the family loved it.

This was the best and easiest roast I have ever cooked.  Have had issues with drying out or not cooked enough in the past.  Since this recipe I have had a great roast every time.  Thank you soooo much, love it!!  More important my husband and kids love it:)

Amazing recipe and it works!  The house smelled glorious for the time and my wife and I could not wait to eat.  The meat was rare, tender and ever so delicious.  Plus, it saves on your electric bill and is a truly "green" recipe using the remaining heat of the oven to cook.

I've made this twice now, and the roast comes out well each time. Still not as moist as I would like, but to a perfect medium-rare.

I had a 2.8 lb. roast and it turned out tough and under cooked. Followed the directions and even cooked it longer at 200 F for another 30 minutes in case the oven was an issue. Don't recommend.

Just as advertised!  Followed the directions to a 'T' and  ended up with a tender, moist and tasty cheap piece of meat.  Next time I'll cook a bigger one so I can make french-dip sandwiches the next day.

This was really good. My oven is newer, and has a cooling mechanism, so it did not hold the heat. That is why I rated it 4 stars, I had to keep my eye on the temperature the whole time. I was looking forward to leaving it and forgetting it. 
I rubbed it with onion powder, garlic powder, crushed red pepper and a little bit of salt. The crust over the meat was fantastic. 
Like everyone, I was skeptical, but this is worth a try!

The cooking instructions on this roast worked out perfectly in my gas oven. The beef is tender and cooked to perfection every time. 

Instead of just salt and pepper, I make a blend of salt, freshly cracked pepper, oregano, garlic powder, and thyme powder. For spice, I'll sometimes add ground chipotle or habanero powder. I sprinkle it quite liberally over the entire roast and stud the meat with whole garlic cloves before baking it in an uncovered Dutch oven. 

When I pull the roast out, it always has a beautiful crust on it and about two tablespoons of drippings left in the pan. I sometimes add a little bit of beef stock to this to create an au jus. Other times, I'll make a pan gravy. And sometimes, I'll just thinly slice the meat and place it in the pan in order to soak up some of the juices. 

This roast is delicious!!! The roast beef is perfect for sandwiches or just as an accompaniment to a simple green salad. I can't wait until eye of round goes on sale again so I can stock up and make another roast or two!

I've read some other reviewers complain about the meat looking good but still being tough after preparing it this way. To that, I have to say it is extremely important to slice this meat thinly. I have a deli slicer that works great, but when I don't want to pull that out, I make sure that I use a very, very sharp nice to get super thin slices. 

I like to cook two roasts at a time so we have one for dinner and then cold roast beef for the rest of the week.

OMG, used this recipe two weeks ago and it was the best roast beef I have ever cooked.  It was tender, moist and flavorful.  Just bought another roast and of course, will be using this recipe again.  Great energy saver too!

I loved this!  Cooked a 4 pound roast for 35 minutes and let it sit for 3 1/2 hours (since we returned home later than expected) and it was the best ever.  The extra minutes cooking made the roast just a little pink in the middle, which is how my family likes it.  The biggest advantage to this recipe is I know exactly when it will be done, instead of having to check the thermometer several times.  And it came out a hundred times moister and more flavorful that when I use my slow cooker.  This is the only way I will cook my roasts from now on!

I usually follow recipes that say to put the roast in a 350 degree preheated oven for so many minutes per pound while using a digital oven thermometer to hit the target temp but the roast always came out with the outer part of the roast overdone and dry with just a sliver of the middle medium rare as we like it. If I adjust the temp or time the outer part is still dry but the center is too rare. This recipe is fantastic! I followed the directions using a 3.87 lb roast, in a gas oven, except I did not reduce the temp from 500 degrees. I left the roast in for 21 minutes then turned the oven off. After about an hour and a half the temp was at 123 degrees (my target was 130) and then dropped to 120 degrees. I turned the oven back on to 180 and watched my thermometer until it got to 130 (about an hour) and took the roast out, and let it sit for about 20 minutes before carving. I could not believe how evenly the roast had cooked, even on the ends! I inserted slivers of garlic in the roast, then generously salted and peppered it. Once the roast was done, I brushed on about a 1/4 cup or so of soy sauce, letting it stand. Amazing how moist and tender this cut of meat is using this recipe. I will be using this technique on other things from now on, such as pork roasts and hams. Thanks for this great way to cook a roast!

Had zero expectations for this one. Bought 2.3 lb grassfed/grass finished eye of round without a plan and then found out I can't braise it and if it's not prepared properly it can be tough and tasteless. Sprinkled liberally w/ garlic powder, sea salt, fresh ground pepper and thyme. Started in 500 oven w/ fat side up (very thin layer of fat), turned down to 475 for 16 mins, left for 1.75 hrs and got nervous b/c oven felt kind of cool on outside. Turned oven on to 250, when preheated took roast out and temp was 135. Put back in for 20 mins at 250 and then roast was exactly 144. Covered w/ foil for 20 mins. Carved beautifully. Not tough -- not butter soft  either but very nice. Try it! I was pleasantly surprised. I would serve to guests without hesitation as part of a buffet dinner.

Unbelievable! My husband Loved it, he said it was done to perfection. Never thought that a eye-of-round roast could ever turn out this tender and juicy! 
 Definately recommend this recipie! Mine turned out eacxly like the picture.
My Roast was 3 3/4 lbs  did the oven at 500 for 15 minutes turned down to 475 for 1/2 hour then to lowest setting (170 c) fo 2 1/2 hours stuck a meat themometer in and it said medium rare. Took it out of oven let it rest 10 minutes an sliced it thin and it made the absolute best Beef Dip ever!

Not sure if it was my oven (I'm in a new rental apt.), but the outside of the roast was pretty tough and the internal temperature only was at 120 when I tested before cutting.  Make sure you know your oven well before experimenting with this recipe!  I had to put the roast back in the oven for another 15 minutes at 375 degrees to reach the internal temperature of 145.  I would definitely recommend testing the temperature before letting it rest to assure that it has met the right temp.  

I also followed some suggestions to add spices as a rub before cooking - be careful with the amount you use as it will overpower your pallet if you use too much.  Use a modest amount and let it marinate for a bit - trust me... the roast will absorb the flavors.  Otherwise you run the risk of only tasting the spices and not the meat. (Not a good combination when you end up with a tough exterior like I did.  We ended up cutting off the edges... what a waste!)  The end result was a pretty tender center, and I'm giving the recipe the benefit of the doubt, but rating our experience with spices and all, I would have given this recipe 3 stars.

This is the easiest, most fool-proof way to roast!  I use this method all the time and the results are always consistent.

Excellent! We warm it again after it sits, and it really is wonderful. We fix a 3 lb roast and my family of 4 eats most of it at 1 sitting.

Wow, I am impressed.  I was totally prepared for a raw slab of meat when I took this out of the oven, but it was perfect!  Juicy, tender and tasty.  I used montreal steak seasoning.  I do want to point out to check the over through the door while cooking.  My oven was smoking from the combo of high temperature and the fat rolling down the meat.  I think the meat I had was a little more fattier than your average though.

This couldn't be easier. I also cooked it for 9 mins. per pounds, per a few other reviews, as I don't like it SO red in the middle....I may cook it a few more minutes before turning the heat off. However, it came out very tender and it good! I also used garlic powder along with the salt & pepper that I coated the roast with. I will certainly make this again.

All I have to say is OMG!!!! This is an incredible way of cooking roasts!!!I was always hesitant to make a roast in the oven for fear of it being too dry. This method completely changed me. I used a 2.5 pound eye round roast and rubbed it with a seasoning packet I had from omaha steaks - it was dry bell peppers, dried garlic, salt, pepper, and sugar.  After I turned the oven off, I was very skeptical and let the roast stay in for 2 hours.  I checked it out and saw it was a tad bit too red for my household so I turned the oven back on at 400 degrees and cooked it for another 20 minutes.  The roast came out pink and juicy. It was the best roast I ever made.

I was so excited to make this recipe. Made it yesterday. I was disappointed when my roast was not done after the time given. My oven did not hold the heat. next time i am going to leave it in a little longer from the beginning.

Wow, great recipe. I am not a great cook so I usually go to my parents for info. My mother told me that top round roast is tough meat. Thank goodness for this recipe. I followed the directions as is. I sliced the cooked meat really thin, soaked it in some au jus and made some of the best beef dip sandwiches I've ever had. My parents were very pleased! Thanks for this wonderful and easy recipe.

Best roast I have had in A long time. I used the recipe with garlick powder onion powder thyme salt and pepper. The outside was crusted and the  inside melted in your mouth. Looks just like the picture.

This was good for eye of round.  Not exactly melt in your mouth as some suggested (but melt in your mouth is prime-rib and this does not exactly match that).  Extremely easy to prepare - I cut up a bunch of root veggies, tossed in olive oil and threw some rosemary on top and which cooked with the roast and we had a perfect one dish dinner with that.  Key to making it seem tender is to cut it very thin.

This recipe turned out very nice! I added my own herbs and spices, and since it was a 1.5 lb roast I shortened the cooking time and turned the oven to 250 for the last half hour. I was surprised how tender and juicy it was...

Like many others, I was a bit worried that this method would not cook the meat all the way through, but it worked like a charm! I only used Lawry's Seasoning Salt & Pepper (because I served with gravy), but would probably add a little more seasonings next time to give it a bit more flavor.

I made this only because I bought this type of roast and it was an interesting technique; however, we did not find it very flavorful. It was moist in the center, but overcooked on the outside.  We topped it with gravy and ate it, but I will resume making my regular roast recipe.

FIVE STARS PLUS!  The best roast I have ever had.  We cooked the roast in our Le Creuset.  I think that had a lot to do with the success - it holds in the heat.  Many reviews stated that their roast came out cold.  It's the cookware you use.  If you like rare meat, follow the recipe exactly; if you like more well done meat, add about 10 minutes before you turn the oven off.  BEST ROAST EVER

I made a very similar version of this recipe several years ago, it came out perfectly!  The only thing I would suggest is to make sure your oven is fairly clean -- the high heat will burn off anything in there and "perfume" your kitchen!  Anyway, I forgot about this recipe and am very excited to find it here and make it again!

I just have to say that this recipe is one of the best I've ever tried! I followed it exactly as written, only added a little onion and garlic powder to the ground sea salt and pepper. It was a big hit with my family. This will be a sure thing in my menu from now own! Thank you!!

This came out really yummy but a little underdone.  Next time I think I will leave this in the oven another 5 minutes @ 475 F a little while longer before turning the oven off.

I was skeptical I mean seriously? Turning the oven off and leaving in there for 2 hours? But I'm here to tell you my 6 lb beef eye of round came out tender juicy and tasty! I followed directions put in for 42 minutes for 7 minutes per pound of meat then 2 hours of time with oven off. I used McCormick Grill Masters Steak Rub. I recommend this recipe.

I didn't like this one.  Maybe my expectations we're too high.  I expected it to be very moist and very tender but got the opposite result; dry and tough.  Not only that, it was nearly cold too when I pulled it out of the oven.  However, I gave it two stars because it was tasty.  I used garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper, parsley, and dry thyme.

I did not have much luck with this recipe.  I was very excited to use it because it looked so easy!  However, my beef was very tough after 4 hours.  I did use an organic GRASS fed roast so I'm wondering if that made the difference.  Grass fed beef is extremely lean so sometimes certain cooking methods don't work.  Next time I think I would follow the recipe as is but then after the two hours I would put it in a crock pot and leave it for 6 - 8 hours.

I did exactly what the cooking instructions said and when there was still an hour and 20 min. left on my timer, the internal temp. was 145...after about 10 the temp started dropping, it never reached the suggested temp of 160.  So, I had to turn the oven back on at a much lower temp and the meat was over done.  I will not cook it like this again, but for those of you that it worked great for, good for you.

AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!! I would have never thought of doing a roast like this but this was GREAT!!!!!!!!!! My husband loves roast beef and every time I try to make it it comes out a greyish color all the way through and has the consistency of shoe leather. But this was PERFECT!!!!!!! I marinated my 3lb eye of round in vegetable oil and McCormick's Meat Marinade Seasoning Mix and it was DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!! Crispy and slightly blackened on the outside, pink and perfect on the inside and SO MOIST!!!!!!!!!!!! I will never cook roast beef any other way ever again!!!!!!! THANK YOU LYN B!!!!!!!

If you've never cooked roast before, this recipe will sound very odd to you. Just trust it. I made it the first time with a 1.5 pound roast, and it came out just beautifully. Great recipe!

good idea however it doesnt come out as tender as people are claiming.  Maybe the people that made this roast are used to a roast being shoe leather tough.  I would not recommend this recipe to other people.......unless of coarse you like tough meat...

First time I cooked at a temp so high -- but it turned out great.  I used the rub from Herb Rubbed Sirloin Tip Roast (recipe from this site). Whole family loved the roast and the house smelled great.

The best eye of round roast I've ever had! Fast, easy, and very, very moist. It splattered a lot and made a little mess in the oven.

Wow. This is unbelievably good. If it's too rare for some, place in pan with au jus and cook a little longer - won't make it tougher.

WOW...I too had my doubts, but tried this anyway and to be honest it was awesome.  I scheduled my dinner for 6:30 and quite frankly was a little stressed, but my family wants me to make my roast this way from now on...THANK YOU!

I can't thank you enough for this recipe! I have been trying for years to make a beef roast that was as tender as my mom's. This works with any cut of roast that is on sale. I've used eye of round, top round, bottom round, and sirloin tip. Perfect EVERY time. I just usually "cook" a little bit less to make it more rare, and vary seasonings with garlic powder and onion powder. SO easy and SO good! Thanks!!!!!

My Mom made some type of beef (Beef Au Jus) when I was a kid.  She couldn't remember the cut of beef she used.  This is it!  It works with other cuts of beef, too, thought not always with such great results.

Mine turned out very good. It sat on the counter for about 15 minutes before I put it in the oven. I used a 2.5 lb roast, rubbed it with olive oil, salt, pepper, and garlic and then cooked for 18 minutes at 475; then lowered the oven to 180 for an hour; then 200 for another hour. It turned out looking like the pic -- medium (?). After reading all the reviews, I was afraid my oven wouldn't stay hot, so I kept it on. Next time, I think I'm just going to leave it on 200 for 90 minutes (longer if more meat). I also made a simple gravy; there weren't a lot of pan drippings, so I added beef bouillon and some roux and it came out quite tasty. Whole family loved it.

The flavor, doneness and tenderness were very, very good. My roast was not quite cold, but not exactly warm either when I served it. I used salt, pepper and minced garlic to season. My kids LOVED it.

The roast came out tender and flavorful.  I added a light rub of garlic and onion powder, which accentuated the natural taste nicely.  This is an easy and great way to cook eye-of-round.

Gotta say..I was pretty skeptical..but followed the recipe exactly as written. The only thing I changed was to add garlic powder and onion powder along with the salt and pepper. The roast did come out perfectly cooked..but my only problem was that it wasn't very warm after sitting in the oven for the 2 1/2 hours. That's why I only gave a rating of 4 stars. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Didn't work for me.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The internal temperature of the roast never got above 120.  The outside of the roast was edible but the inside was tough as shoe leather.

Wow I cant believe how well this worked, perfect. I used a steak seasoning and it was great. We have a electric slicer my husband uses for his beef jerky, and I used if for the first time with this recipe. It worked perfectly the meat was thin and juicey, just like deli roast beef at a  fraction of the cost.

Did 9 min per pound, and left it in oven a lot longer after turning off heat (because I was out), and it still had red "juice" come out when I poked it and was pink on all but the exterior 1 cm around.  Hubby really liked it; I prefer a browner look. Rubbed it with s+p and spices before baking.

I'm still in disbelief.  PERFECTION!  I am absolutely THRILLED with the outcome of the eye of the round roast that I prepared today, just as the recipe/preparation suggestions recommended.  Tasty, tender, perfect level of medium-rare slices of roast.  I prepared same type of roast last week, cooking it as I'd cook a beef tenderloin, and the eye of the round did not come out well at all!  I was so discouraged.  Then, I decided to try it again, but with this prep method, and voila', it was well worth it!  A $14 roast tasted like a tenderloin that would cost $60!  I'm sharing the good news with my friends, and I have a feeling that the local market will be getting lots of requests for eye of the round roasts now!

AWESOME! I never comment on things like this but this recipe deserves comment. I never imagined eye round roast could be so tender and juicy. It was a good as any prime rib [and better flavor]. I can't wait to make another! I added adolph's, garlic and steakhouse [grinder] seasonings to the rub. I was hoping for med-rare so I cooked it 8 min per pound. I was a little behind schedule so I left it in the oven for 2 hours at 175 degrees; it was a perfect med-rare. My husband said it was the best beef he has ever had. The daughter said it was in the top 3 of all my dishes.  My toddler cleaned his plate and he won't eat beef unless it's a burger or spaghetti. This so easy and saves time and money so I will be doing this a lot.

Well, I am not a cook, but I try recipes once in a while, because I never ever made roast beef before, iI decided to try this one. I did everything by the book, but, when I pulled out o the oven the meat was very well done. Now, I think  because I have a new GE Profile, and is very well insulated. I tried again today, and instead of 2 1/2 hours, I left sitting in there for one hour, still came out well done. Does anybody out there have the same oven and can tell me how long should I leave on the oven?  And the meat was bigger. That's all the problem I had, but the meat was good and juice!!! And delicious, but I would like a little more rare!!! I am afraid to take out to soon . Please help!!!! Tx

I made my roast over the weekend and it turned out perfect!  I placed a digital thermometer in the roast b/c I was concerned with how insulated my oven was.  I'm glad I did, b/c after about 1 hour the temperature of my roast started to drop!  I put my oven on 200 for the 2nd hour and it went perfect!  Thank you for the EASY recipe & tip :)

My wife brought home this piece of "mystery meat". We weren't sure what to do with it, but it was on sale.  I found this recipe and decided it had good reviews so we gave it a fling.  WOWSERS! Fast, straight forward, delicious. Closest thing to prime rib.   Recipe called for sitting time of 2.5 hours. Ours was ready in about 1 hr.   I would strongly urge those of you that enjoy it more on the rare side to pull it at internal temp of 135-140.  One last thing that made us feel good about the cooking process is the electronic temperature gauge. Plug in the long needle into the thick part of the meat, set it to the internal temp you desire, set the alarm, and PRESTO there ya go!

This recipe did not work for us, at all. The temp didn't stay steady nor did it climb, it dropped! I guess if we wanted steak tartare, then it would have been perfect. I had to re-cook the entire thing which resulted in a piece of shoe leather. I know how to cook, and this isn't the cooks error it's the recipes.

I was skeptical too, but this really worked!  My roast was smaller than the recipe called for, 2.15 lbs, so I adjusted the cook time to 15 minutes.  I took it out after sitting for 2 hours and 10 minutes and it was perfect!  I used a spice rub of garlic powder, onion powder, thyme, paprika, black pepper and seasoned salt.  Also, I let the roast sit out for half an hour before cooking to let it come to room temperature.  Will definitely make again!

Honestly thought this wouldn't work but it did!  YUM! I made a wonderful gravy with the drippings and we'll be eating sandwiches for the next few days!  I did leave my oven on 170 for the first ninety minutes.  The oven has a fan and I knew it wouldn't keep the heat.  Great recipe - game changer!

Okay, I had read about this recipe many years ago for prime rib but was always afraid to try it on such an expensive cut.  I had this eye of round roast that I didn't know what to do with.  I was tired of dried out meat in my crock pot and found this awesome delicacy.  My 17 year old son said it was the best roast I had ever made!  Don't be afraid of it.... if it turned out for me it will work for anyone.

I was skeptical.  But I had bought a whole eye of round and had it cut into 3 smaller roasts and the first one I cooked the way I always have and it was very tough, so I decided to give this a shot.  I can't believe the two roasts came from the same cow!!  Thanks so much for sharing this.

Oh my god! This was great! I was surprised by this recipe, but I'll try anything once. I'm used to stew meat, but this is a whole different world. I followed the directions, invited some friends over for the experiment, and ended up with some of the best french dip in history. Darn, this was good. I'm a lifetime fan now. And, I'll tell all my friends. WOW

I can not tell you how easy this was and how delicious it was!  The hardest part was leaving the oven closed for the 2.5 hrs as the odor teased me!  I embellished with onion powder and garlic powder in addition to salt and pepper!  My picky family ranted, raved and devoured!

The flavor was good, and the recipe couldn't have been easier.  But my roast was not tender at all.  The only difference was that I used a 2 lb. piece of meat vs. a 3 lb. one, but I did adjust the cooking time accordingly.  Not sure what went wrong.

What is the temperature in your oven at the end of the 2.5 hours? I have a gas oven and because it is vented (there is a direct passage from the inside of the oven to the outside of the oven) the temperature in the oven really drops off quickly after I turn the heat off. After an hour and a half the oven temperature is down to 120 degrees F. I think I will have to keep the oven on but keep lowering the temperature to simulate the temperature drop in an electric oven. Thanks, Jon

Our garbage ended up with our piece of meat- not our stomachs. Didn't work at all. Our roast was raw and the meat thermometer didn't even START to climb (and we have a brand new oven- less than 5 months old).

This was a huge hit at our last big dinner. I got an ANGUS eye of round marked down at the butchers. I have to plan better because I tied up my oven before I was done with everything else that needed the oven. THIS was truly wonderful. It melted in your mouth and everyone was ranting about it.

If you have a smaller roast, you may want to cook it a little longer per pound, or it may be a bit rare.  It was great with the rub.  It was a very tasty roast, and I will make the next one this way also.

I have made this roast twice now.  I had a 2lb cross rib, just enough for my husband & I with left overs for beef dip sandwiches.  This last time I cut slits in the roast and inserted slice garlic, then rubbed with a little liquid smoke, salt, & pepper.  I cooked it for 8 mimutes per pound, then left it in for the 2 !/2 hours.  It was awesome.  This is now my go to for Roast Beef.

So simple yet so amazing.  I've been cooking for 40 years & this is the best roast I've ever made!  My roast was 5+ pounds, so I allowed extra cooking time for that.  I also added a little granulated garlic to season.  I served it with our favorite horseradish sauce. You would have thought that I spent all day in the kitchen!  Thanks for the recipe Lyn!

For failures, blame your oven. I am giving this 4 stars because I believe this recipe may be correct. Did try this recipe on a 4.8 pound eye of round roast. Pre-heated to 500F, put roast in and followed the 7 minute rule? at 475F. Came out 2 hours later stone cold, same as the oven. Should have followed another members suggestion at keeping the oven at 200F. Your oven like mine does not keep the heat in.

I never thought an eye of round roast would be as moist as this recipe produced. On the plus side, the simplicity of preparation and cooking was a snap with good results. Even though I followed the instructions to the letter, the roast came out at 160 degrees, meduim in my book, rather than 140, medium rare, the way I like it.

Perfect! I prefer my beef a little more on the rare side, so I only did 6 minutes per pound rather than 7. I also brought it to Ron temp before cooking and seasoned it lightly with liquid smoke, Maggi sauce, garlic powder, salt and pepper before roasting. Perfect every time.

Very good. We rubbed the roast with some cilantro and oregano as well. Also every hour he turned our oven back on till it got warm again (our stove does not hold heat that well) and after the two and a half hours it took to cook we added five minuted on at the end at 475 to keep the meat from being so bloody. Turned out fantastic.

Followed the recipe exactly, it turned out perfect! My husband was really impressed which isn't easy to do as he is the head chef. He was so impressed with how this turned out that this will be the only way we will cook it from now on. I did serve it with Aujus and horseradish sauce on the side as another reviewer sugested. Thank you for sharing the recipe!

Have made this several times now and it always comes out perfectly.  This time I paired it with Slow Cooker Mashed Potatoes and Simple Beef-Flavored Gravy.  Delish, and solved the "can't open the oven to put in sides" dilemma.

I thought this roast was delicious, although I wish it would have been more tender.  I took a knife and pierced the meat so I could place some slivers of garlic into the meat.  The garlic premeated throughout the roast.  It came out medium which is how my husband likes it.  I prefer medium rare.  Will make again.

Loved this recipe! I, like many others, was a little sceptical of making this, but it turned out perfectly medium rare. Made it for my parents and father-in-law and they were all amazed!

I made this EXACTLY per the recipe.  I seasoned my 3.14 lb. eye of round roast with very coarsley ground sea salt & coarsley ground (McCormicks)seasoned pepper blend.  The meat came out tender & slightly pink inside. However, there were just not enough pan drippings in the bottom of the roaster rack to make an Au Jus sauce.  Next time I'll buy an envelope to make up an Au Jus sauce.  (I just felt it needed some kind of broth or dipping sauce)  But my "carnivore" husband loved it and even ate the leftovers the next day (cold) on a sandwich roll with spicy brown mustard!

I dunno, I think you probably have to have a well-insulated oven for this to work.  I followed the directions dutifully with a small roast (2.25lbs), and even left the oven on for a few extra minutes.  The roast was too rare to eat - it was thoroughly bloody and registered about 90 degrees on the meat thermometer.  I've put it back in at 350 and will probably have a dry, bleh roast in a few minutes.  Our oven is a little old so that's probably the issue - I wish I had seen the review where the reviewer had successfully left their older oven on at 200 degrees.

This turned out great. I seasoned a lovely 2.75 lb grass-fed well-trimmed roast with freshly ground black pepper and sea salt, and roasted it at 475 for 19:15 (calculated that whole 7 minutes a pound thing). I ran into a little bit of a dilemma... I used a meat thermometer, and it read 140 degrees after under an hour with the heat off, but then began to cool off. After about two hours it was down to 113 degrees and so I decided to turn the oven back on to 275 and let it get to 145 before taking it out and tenting it for awhile. I have no idea if this was the right move, but it sure tasted like it. This made a purely delicious roast beef, even better with a little horseradish.

This was great. I wanted to cook a good dinner for my son (and the rest of the family) tonight before my son goes back to college from his long Christmas break. I picked up a 5 lb roast from Costco (first time I ever bought meat there). I usually tend to overcook roast beef but this was really good. It smelled great cooking at the high temperature and I actually only left in the turned off oven about 1 1/2 hours. I couldn't stand waiting (and everyone was hungry) so I cut into it and it was perfect. The only thing wrong was that it wasn't real warm. I needed to cook something else in the oven so turned it back on at 350 and the meat was warm after about 20 minutes. I will definitely make it again.

The best roast I ever made.  Usually my roast come out over cooked and rough.  Don't buy roast that much due to that fact.  With this recipe I am going to be making more roast for dinner now.  You can't go wrong...it is an easy tasty recipe!  Thank you for sharing!

I usually cook a tougher piece of meat in the crock pot for long hours, but, I thought I would try this recipe for something different and it worked perfectly for me.   I cooked exactly as stated, but, used some different seasoning instead of just salt and pepper.  It was cooked perfectly and was great the next day sliced thin on an au jus sandwich.

Wow!  I don't like roast beef and my daughter doesn't like London broil, but all 7 family members scarfed it down.  It tastes so much better than London broil and regular roast beef!  There was not a morsel left.  This will be a family staple.

have made this now numerous times (even tried the recipe using prime rib) every time it comes out perfect!  I do have to have a separate fan running under the kitchen fire alarm but it's so worth it!  I'm so happy to have found this recipe!  I fed the eye of round to guests and didn't tell them what cut of meat it was and got tons of rave reviews!

This was fabulous. I was leary as well when reading it. I marinated in grill master garlic peppercorn for 12 hours. Also, I let the meat sit out 20 minutes prior to cooking. A good knife and oven are key. For those who said it was raw might need to have your oven calibrated. It was medium on the ends and med-rare in the middle. Perfection. Thanks so much.

Excellent way to cook an Eye of Round. I was a bit skeptical at first, but glad i listened to all of the good reviews and tried this recipe. I let the oven warm up for about 30 minutes after I preheated, and let the roast stand for a half hour. I used a simple rub of rosemary, kosher salt, black pepper, and olive oil. The after resting out of the oven after the 2 hours was up, the roast was sort of cold, but I made a two-mushroom gravy and it heated it up nicely when served. It was a challenge finding stovetop sides to make considering my oven was in use, but I just did a twice-baked potato and cooked it for 10 minutes while the roast was setting w biscuits. Beautiful meal, everyone was very impressed. Will make this again, it came out just medium, I think I will cut time down to 6 mins per pound, because we like our meat a little more rare. Thanks Lyn!

I used the exact directions to cook my eye-of-round steak (important to note that this recipe is for this type of cut).  I just changed the rub...used the herb rubbed sirloin roast recipe.  Was DELICIOUS and tender.  May reduce to 6 min. per pound/2 hours next time for fun.

I live high altitude (6800 ft)  I was afraid of making roasts anymore due to past disasters...often too dry or overdone.  Meats tend to dry out quickly here.  This recipe I have made 3 times, and as long as I watch the meat thermometer it has come out fantastic!  The seasoning tastes so good!

I would not go so far as to say this is the best roast I have ever had, but it was very good.  I had about a 4 1/4 lb roast.  I preheated the oven and cooked for exactly 20 minutes at 475.  I seasoned with kosher salt, pepper, granulated onion, and garlic/herb mix.  I put it in a roasting pan on a rack and put bacon strips on top.  The high heat made the bacon smoke, so I am not sure I would do that again.  Since the roast was so big I set the oven temp to 175 in case the oven cooled down too quickly (I have a very old range).  I left in the oven another 3 hours and it was done perfectly.  When I took it out of the oven it looked kind of shriveled up and not that appealing.  But when I sliced it, it was perfect.  Pan drippings (after straining out the burned pieces) made a really good old fashioned gravy (dark and flavorful).

Wow! I was hopeful, and assured by the number of positive reviews, but still a little doubtful until the roast came out of  my oven. Beautifully blackened on the top and tender medium rare through the middle. This recipe delivers exactly what it promises, and with a very inexpensive cut of meat! I made this for the protein  portion of a wine-focused dinner with friends, and so, seasoned only with salt and pepper. The taste of the meat was excellent, and there was just enough fat (i did not trim any away before cooking) to balance out the tannins from a couple of big reds that showed. Thanks so very much for a great recipe.

So glad I found this recipe. Had no idea what to do with this roast and my husband and I werent in the mood for pot roast. 2.75 lb roast cooked for 20 minutes, turned oven off for 1 hour...it was done.  Any longer it wouldnt have been as good.  I think the cooking method all depends on your oven. We used the left overs for philly sandwiches.

This turned out really well, although I made some changes that I think improved the recipe. I used a 1.6 lb eye of round roast. I marinated the meat for a little over 24 hrs in the frig, which I think was the secret to the tenderness and flavor of the final product. I made a simple marinade of apple cider vinegar, dijon mustard, minced garlic, and salt and pepper. The vinegar really helped to tenderize the meat. I cooked the meat at 475 F for 12 minutes and then turned the oven off. I was shorter on time than I expected, so I turned the oven back on to 200 F after about a 1/2 hr. About another 1/2 hour later, I decided to check the meat since it was a much smaller roast than the recipe calls for. It was perfect with a light pink center. I might even take it out earlier next time. I sliced it very thinly and served it with an au jus sauce I made and with some horseradish. It turned out great. Eye of round is great because it is a leaner cut of red meat and is usually pretty inexpensive compared to other cuts of beef. For anyone who is trying to eat healthy but needs a red meat fix once in a while, this is a great option if you make sure it is well-trimmed of all excess fat. Thanks for the great cooking technique!

Very tender and juicy roast.  Next time I will probably leave roast in oven about 5 more minutes.  My roast was 2.25 lbs and I cooked for 16 minutes.  I served with roasted potatoes and with the drippings I made au jus gravy using 2 cups water and 2 tsp better then bouillon.  Made french dip sandwiches with the roast beef.  Had my husband slice the meat super thin using our meat slicer.

Make sure you know your oven.  The cooking time is essential to producing a cooked-to-order beef.  We like it medium-rare at our house so we don't leave it in the hot oven as long as the recipe calls for.  It's always come out moist and juicy for us.

Very juicy, but came out overdone for my taste.  I used the method suggested and pulled it after 20 min/pound, which for me, a 4 pound roast meant 80 min after the 28 at the high temp.  I have a newer oven so when I opened it, it was almost as if I hadn't turned it off =(  I should have used a meat thermometer, so that is my fault.  It was very juicy and flavorful at med-well, however.  Thanx!

Awesomely easy and awesomely tender!  I have had bad luck with getting a tender roast and this method did the trick.  I did make some seasoning changes since I felt it needed a little something more, otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.  My changes were simple: in addition to the S&P I rubbed it with savory, thyme, garlic and onion powder.  My family loved it and it also made great sandwiches!

Amazing!  I used an herb rub that I also found on this site and just followed the recipe.  I'm glad I read that it was important that the oven door remain shut, because I would have peeked!  This was so tender and moist, I could hardly believe it.

Wonderful roast. So simple. I used the HERBED RUB PASTE FROM THIS SITE----HERB RUBBED SIRLOIN TOP ROAST. Lots of flavor. What I really liked was putting it in an extremely hot oven for 20 min. then leaving meat in over for 2 hrs. I let continue to set until I was ready to serve dinner.  Meat was juicy, pink all way through and tasted wonderful. This will be great addition to our meals and so nice for roasting in the summer. Kitchen/house will be kept cool while it cooks.

The only reason that I am not giving this a five star is that my roast turned out extremely rare. I cooked it for the recommended amount of time and then turned off the oven as the recipe directed and after the time was up, I discovered that the roast was cold. I cooked it for an additional 15 minutes because the outside looked done and when we cut in to it, the roast was unedible in the very center. (was completely raw) Other than that, the texture was good, very much like ham. I think that next time, I will leave my oven on at 200 and see if the results change!

I too thought, "This sounds bizarre, but what the heck, I'll try anything once."  I'm really glad I did!  I have an older (not good at heat retaining) oven, and people who like their beef a bit more cooked, so I roasted mine for about 9 mins per pound. I seasoned it with olive oil, salt, pepper, and lots of garlic.  It was room temp when done, and I reheated a bit but it came out beautifully!  Thanks much for the recipe.

this was fantastic-since my son and his family like their meat a little more done, I extended time to 26 min. Then just turn the oven off. Its so easy, and the aus jus left in the baking pan added to the flavor.

Though I, like others it seems, had my doubts, eye of round was on sale and so I figured it would only be a small monetary loss if for some reason it didn't quite turn out- boy was I impressed!  I cooked the roast exactly as directed- seasoned with rosemary, thyme, cayenne pepper, garlic and oregano, shoved it in the oven, set the timers and out came this incredible roast,cooked just right on the outside and to a beautiful pink in the middle.  Quite impressive, served with garlic mashed potatoes, it has become a household favorite!

If I didnt try this recipe, I wouldnt of believed it would work and taste sooo good. The hardest part believe it or not.. was not being able to open the oven and take a peek lol. I took some other reviewers tips about cooking 9mins per lb, as my kids dont like too pink of meat. I put rub on it and used a rack.  Wanted to make gravy at the end, but was worried it would have a burnt taste. Has anyone else had this problem? Anyhow..now I will be more apt to buy eye of round when it comes on sale, as I know how to cook it properly..!!!!

I have a gas oven, and I too had a slightly raw (and hard to slice) roast. I think next time, I will keep the oven set to warm after the high temperature and use a thermometer I can leave in the oven. It was very tender, just a little more rare than I would have liked.

Great results from an easy recipe!  We like our meat a little more well-done, so I kept at 500 a little longer than directed and then let sit in the oven for 3 hours.  The meat was the perfect color for us and was still tender.  I sliced and served on biscuits with a horseradish sauce.

I cooked a 2lb eye of round with a chipotle pepper rub and followed the cooking instructions of this recipe.  The roast came out perfect.  The cooking time was less than 2 1/2 hours because the roast was smaller, but it was perfect.  I will cook all my roasts like this from now on.

Wow, I didn't think this would work!  I usually don't care for pink beef, but this stuff was soooooo good!  All of my Super Bowl party guests loved it.  Next time I'll trim the roast a little more than I did.  In case anyone is interested, I rubbed it with montreal steak seasoning, garlic and herb mrs. dash and mccormick's worchestershire pepper blend.  Will definitely make again!

Made this for Christmas Day.  Turned out perfect medium rare.  I had a 4 lb roast so adjusted the time to 8 minutes per pound and it came out great. So very easy and will make it again.

Although I was skeptical about turning the oven completely off, I tried this recipe and it was excellent. It was the best  roast I have ever cooked!  The kids loved it as well. Thanks so much for the recipe.

I followed the directions exactly and at the end of the 2.5 hours my roast was only at 120 degrees so I turned the oven back on and finished it up.  It was, however, a lot more tender than I know this cut of meat to usually be so I thought maybe one of my kids may have poked their nose in the oven and let some heat out.  Not sure and they deny it.  I will definitely try it again and maybe next time keep a closer eye on the oven.

THANK YOU SOOOOO MUCH!!  About 4 years ago, I bought an eye of round roast from a grocery store that actually no longer exists here. Behind the meat label was a recipe much like this one that I used and LOVED.  I have never seen anything like it anywhere ever again and have been trying, in vain, to cook a roast without making it tough this whole time! I am not one to leave my oven on low and leave for the day, and I often do not have the time to sit at the house while a roast slow cooks. This is a beautiful recipe for people like me who are always on the go, but still love the taste of a slow-cooked roast at dinner sometimes.  I use a LOT of garlic in my recipe though. Like many others I've read, I use salt & pepper, as well as granulated garlic powder, other seasonings, and a couple cloves of garlic chopped and inserted into slices made into the meat.

Made this today as I was looking for an easy recipe that would cook while I took the kids ice skating!  It came out perfect.  I seasoned with S&P plus placed sliced onions on top, held on with toothpicks.  It was a perfect dinner after a cold day on the ice!

I bought a meat thermometer (just in case) and ended up misreading it with my dim oven light.  I was a little disappointed when my roast did not seem very brown, but that was probably my fault, I forgot to adjust my rack before putting the roast in to the hot oven.  I should have waited a little while to ensure that it was still 500 degrees!  Even with my thermometer goof and the rack goof--it came out great.  It was the best beef I have ever had.  I have always like steak, because I can attempt to have it medium rare.  But I had never tried anything like this.  I made it for Christmas dinner yesterday--and my husband and parents loved it.  It is truly idiot proof!  I demonstrated that.  Mine was 3.49 lbs and I roasted it on high heat for 24.5 minutes, then turned it down to 200 for 70 minutes (20 minutes per pound)!  Will make this again!

This is a cooking technique that I am very interested in perfecting.  I had a 4.1 pound roast that I did a brine-marinate thing with.  I had a recipe with bourbon, brown sugar, cilantro, lemon juice, worcestershire, soy sauce, thyme, and water.  I cut slits into the meat and stuck garlic in about ten different places and then floated in the meat in the liquid for 24 hours.  Then...475 for 24 min and then one hour in the oven with it off.  It rested on the countertop for 20 minutes.  It was a gorgeous medium rare (on the rare side) and the trick was to slice it SUPER thin, otherwise, it was tough.  I had to slice by hand, so it was super tricky.  But it was deeeelish!

Like many others, I was very surprised that this cooked up the way it did.  Perfect medium rare and juicy.  My only negative would be that it did not "tenderize" this eye-of-round to my satisfaction.  I wonder how this would work (the high temp method) for a standing rib or tenderloin?  Would I use this again, maybe not with the same cut of beef, but the concept of cooking is wonderful.

I was skeptical, but it turned out delicious!  I used a 2 1/2 lb eye of round, injected it with cajun marinade.

This came out way underdone. 3.5 pound Eye of Round and it was seared on the outside but rare all the way through. It also never got over 95 degrees. Put back in after pre-heating to 425 then lowered back to 250 for another hour to bring it up to a proper temperature and medium-rare.

I have to give this recipe 5 stars mostly due to, hello....EASY!  And of course it tastes fantastic. Used only olive oil and MCCormick steak rub. Made it twice already this week.  Have 2 teen age boys and a husband who loves to eat.  Great for left overs and a quick meal.  Wasn't sure my 22-year old Tappan electric oven would retain the heat but it certainly did and it only goes to 475 to start with.  Will make it again and probably again!

I was skeptical about this recipe, but it sure came out well. The meat was cool, but adding gravy took care of that. I had also added some baked potatoes in the oven in some foil, and they were still warm. Very tender, will make this again!

I'm glad I found this recipe because I didn't know Eye of Round was such a tough cut but I DO know that my roasts are often very tough and chewy. 
This recipe worked like a charm and I'll be trying it again.

It was DELICIOUS! I thought that turning the oven off sounded ridiculous but I gave it a shot anyway and I'm glad I did.
I left it in for 2hrs and turned it back on to 300 when there was a half hour left.
I think Next time I will aim for 1.5 hrs instead because I like it a little more red.  My guest preferred medium well and that's what I got so it worked out great!
I put chopped garlic, salt, and pepper on the meat.  My guest hardly believed that was all I put on it!
I will surely make this again.

Thank you so much for posting this recipe!  From now on this will be the only way I cook my roasts.  Last night, I cooked a 2 lb roast - 14 mins and then with the oven off for about 2 hrs.  It came out med-rare and perfectly tender.  I had some of the left-overs for lunch today and its still perfect.

I had two 5lb roasts that I ended up cooking at the high temp for an hour, then at 200 for about 2 hours. It turned out pretty well though I could have been more adventurous with spicing.

I was worried it wouldn't come out, but my roast was delicious, a little on the done side, but my family loved it.  I coated the roast with garlic salt and ground black pepper before roasting it.  Simple and easy!

Thank you, Lyn B., for this wonderfully easy recipe!  I followed it exactly, using a generous amount of Lawry's seasoned salt & pepper.  A perfect medium-rare roast beef!

Wow, I was worried the entire 2 hours or so that this was in the oven but just like most everyone else it turned out perfectly! ALL my family went back for seconds. I bought this meat as a managers "special" markdown not realizing it was a tough piece of beef, boy am I glad I found this recipe it did turn out like a high price cut of beef. I will use this again and look for more markdowns! Thanks so much!

This was really, really good.  One of the best recipes I've found in a long time.  I put S&P and some dried onions on the meat and had it sit for a couple hours in the fridge.  The meat was only about 1.5 lbs. so I did the high temp for about 20 minutes and then it sat in the oven for about 1 hr 45 min.  Then it rested for about 20 minutes.  It was rare, but very tender.  My 3 year old gobbled it up.  Will definitely make again!

This really does turn an inexpensive roast into a gourmet dinner. Make some Yorkshire puddings and roast potatoes whilst the meat rests and you have a meal to please just about everyone.

Delicious recipe!  Like others, I was kinda sceptical, but it worked fabulously.  A $6 roast that turned out like it was worth much more.  
I have to tell all my friends about it!

I was sooo doubtful about this recipe and was sure the roast would not cook right but tried it anyway due to the high ratings and I'm so glad I did! it came out so perfect! i just marinated it overnight with some A1 new york steakhouse marinade and followed the directions exacly. this came out so juicy and a perfect pink center! I will never cook an eye of round any other way again!

Holy Cow--it really works!  I followed the recipe just as written, and we had a delicious Sunday dinner.  The roast was perfectly pink in the middle as promised.  I wonder if this works with other cuts of meat???  Thanks for this unbelievably awesome and easy recipe!

I was unimpressed.  The roast cooked GREAT with this method (have cooked standing rib roasts in similar fashion), but honestly I didn't like the taste/quality of the cut of meat.  Think I'll just stick to my old standby of grilled "London Broil" for sandwiches.

This was the most amazing and tender roast I had ever made...I'm always working and running. I had my daughter put it on when she came home from school..She liked the fact that she didn't have to keep watch on it after 20 min..by the time I came home and made side dishes it was perfect..not to rare not to well done just perfect..my hard to please kids actually had seconds..Even my mom was very pleased w/dinner..Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

I must admit that I had my doubts about theis cooking method, but this is the best eye round I've ever had.  I used an external, programmable meat thermomter during "cooking"  to let me know when it was actually done (it helped avoid any temptation to open the oven door!).  The roast came up to medium temp before 2.5 hours were up, so I had to let it rest for over 1/2 hour while scrambling to get the side dishes done - but even then it was absolutely perfect!  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent. I served this thin sliced, open face on fresh french loaf with au jus covering it. Meat was done med. rare in the center, for a 3.5 lb. roast, at 25 minutes at 475 degrees plus 2.5 hours resting time.

I made this last night precisely this way and it is absolutely, as promised, the most tender and delicious roast one could ask for!  I would like to ask Lyn B, the original cook, how she thought of it?  It's not what I'd intuitively do with a cut of meat like this, but it's a major new addition to my "book of tricks."  Thanks, Lyn!

I am blown away at how delicious this came out.  I have cooked eye of round for 30 years and it has never come out this good.  The taste is amazing.  It really does taste like prime rib!!!

Hands Down- A Keeper!

I did not get the juice that others wrote of to make a gravy- but then again- it didnt need any gravy.  I cant wait to try this with different seasonings than I did- I used sea salt and fresh ground pepper and garlic powder-  I cant believe how tender this came out.

PERFECT roast! I followed it to the letter and it was THE most tender meat we have ever eaten. Will make again and again and I've already emailed the recipe to my mom and plan on letting all my cooking friends know that this is the ONLY way to cook an eye-of-round roast. Thank you for sharing! :)

Very easy to prepare, piece of cake to cook.  I rubbed olive oil and coated with garlic, pepper and salt.  Served with horseradish sauce on the side, potato and a veg.  Perfect change from a crockpot roast.

This recipe was a good one.  It was really simple for someone that's not that savvy in the kitchen.  Unfortunately, the dinner still turned out bad.  It wasn't the recipe at all though.  This is the first time we had ever tried this cut of meat and it is the toughest meat that I've ever had.  The flavor was great but we won't be having this again.

This was so easy, I used garlic salt and fresh ground pepper and it had plenty of flavor. The center was quite tender, although the ends were a little tough. I really enjoyed it.

Super easy and delicious! I’ve made this twice so far. The first time following the recipe exactly. The second time I marinated the roast over night with red wine, balsamic vinegar, extra virgin olive oil, garlic, S&P,  & rosemary.  Patted dry and placed a before following the cooking instructions. Made a sauce with the drippings in the pan this time too. Amazing!  You could easily experiment with different marinades for this recipe. I will probably use this recipe often.

This looked so good I forgot to take a picture and turned out to be the best roast only thing I did different was I omitted the salt and pepper and covered the roast liberally with SALT GRASS STEAK SEASONING the day before.

I would have never purchased or prepared this cut of meat until I stumbled upon this recipe. I added thyme and a little garlic powder with the salt & pepper for seasoning. I also made sure that the oven temperature was at 500 for a good 15-20 minutes before putting the roast in the oven and cooked it fat side up.

Came out beautifully! I used the top comment’s cook times since I had a 2.3 lb roast to do and it was just right on the temp. Cooked it for meal prep, froze half and then left a piece to sandwich at lunch. Was very hard to consume in sandwich form. Meat was soft but didn’t want to pull apart, it’s possible I had silver skin on it. Smells great! I used Montreal seasoning on all sides for mine. The dogs also approved!

I echo all of the previous comments! This is a great recipe, and so easy (if you have the prep time). I followed the recipe exactly but used a 3.4lb roast. We like our meat more on the rare side, so the cook time was perfect. It was medium-rare to medium, and so flavorful & juicy! The only thing that i haven't gotten the hang of yet is how to cut "with the grain". i will explore that more though - this is husband approved :-D

Most important thing to know  ABOUT  is USE  MEAT THERMOMETER....  the kind that you place in meat, BUT has a wire attached to an EXTERNAL temp read out box.  That way you do not open the oven to check the temp  of meat.  I made this using the tips from rhe PHL4965 review., since  I had the browning sauce he mentioned( Gravy Master). Just a note if you use that browning sauce.... brush it on, do not pour it on.  A light glaze will do just fine. A good  size sprinkling of  garlic powder, and ligh sprinkling of Kosher Salt & decent sprinkle of   course cracked pepper  over the top .Use more Kosher salt if not using the browning  sauce  . Rosemary fine crushed  would also work well in this.  I may add that next time..  Also next time I am going to get an extra head or 2 of fresh garlic. Cut each head in half through  the equator, then drizzle with oil  and wrap in heavy duty foil&    roast . Then serve rhe roasted garlic ( individual  cloves squeezed  out ) along side .

Most people who complained appear to have an oven that didn't hold the heat.  I had the opposite problem.  Following the recipe exactly, using a 2 lb. eye of round, I heated the oven to 500, put in the roast, immediately lowered to 475 for 14 minutes, and then turned the oven off.

Fortunately, I had inserted a remote thermometer.  Watched the temperature climb and became concerned as it reached 125 (serving temp for a rare roast) within a half hour.  After a few more minutes I snatched it out, but it got to 145 by then - which is medium for a roast, and far, far too overcooked for this cut of meat.

It was chewy and dry.  I sliced as thinly as possible and served with a wine reduction to add some  moisture back in. Threw the rest away.  #1 - avoid this too-lean cut of meat for a roast. #2 - go with low and slow, watching roast temp (searing outside first, perhaps). #3 - always use a temp probe.

I had a 2.48 lb roast, preheated my roaster at full heat for 15min, salt, pepper, seasoning salt generously, cooked it for 20 min then turned off roaster. Let it continue to cook for 45min. I never opened the roaster the whole time. It was a perfectly cooked, beautiful med rare! So easy and delicious! I impressed myself!

I did as directed. The roast was only 2.29lbs, so roasted at 475 for 17 minutes before turning oven off .  left in oven for slightly less than an hour. 
 Roast was rarer than we wanted, but very chewey.  Good flavor, but would not use these instructions again.

I had doubts, but it was wonderful.  I had a 2.5 lb roast and used an electric oven. Cooked it at 475 for the recommended 7mins per lb. Others said the fan that does go on when at a high temp dries it out. So used the bottom oven at 200 for an hour.  Meat was amazingly tender with lots of au jus.  Thank you! It was a very nice xmas dinner!

I used a steak seasoning instead of salt and pepper. It tasted really good. I will make it like this again.

Cooked just as directed. Did not see much of a difference than cooking it my usual way at 350 degrees for 20 minutes/lb.

I have made my last two eye roasts this way and they have turned perfect medium rare both times.  This is the way I will be fixing them from now on.

Excellent but we are still playing with time per pound as we like it a bit more rare. Easiest main dish I've ever made!

I was nervous this would be too rare. It was the best Roast I have ever made! I followed the directions exactly. I had a little over 2 pound roast so I roasted it for 14 minutes and it stayed in the oven for 2.5 hours.
Perfectly medium rare and so flavorful. I coated with garlic salt, Mrs. Dash (garlic/herbs) and fresh ground pepper.
This is going into my rotation. Good enough for special occasion dinners.

I have an electric oven so I turned it down from 500 to 170 and it baked for a couple hours. I had a thermometer in it so it was easy to know when it was ready to come out of the oven. It was perfect and super easy. The gravy came out well too.

Did exactly as stated. 3.7 pound eye of round. Checked electric stove oven with two thermometers for accuracy. At 500F thermometers read 497F. Inserted meat thermometer in center of roast. Cooked at 500F for 25 min. Turned off oven After 1.5 hours thermometer beeped at 135 F. Opened oven. took instant read thermometer in center of roast. Yep 135F.  (Note: all thermometers were checked for accuracy before use.) Took roast out of oven. Nice crust, med rare, but meat was still as tough as an old shoe. The roast would have been well done if left in the oven as long as recommended. I feel I did everything right. Roast was fresh and did have a layer of fat on one side.

Way over cooked.  I seasoned this with Uncle Chris’s Steak Seasoning and let it marinate for 24 hours.   I followed the directions and cooked this at 7 minutes per pound and then shut the oven off and left it for 1.5 instead of 2.5 hours  to be sure it was a little rare.   The meat was 158 degrees when it came out of the oven.    Rare is 115 to 120.in a professional kitchen.   The flavor was good and will be ok once I put it through a slicer for lunch meat.

The meat was very tasty but it was cooked too much and somewhat dry.  I followed all of the directions and my roast was the right size.  I would do it again but use a bigger roast or cut down on the cooking time.

First time I have cooked this way.  I was a little skeptical on being tender.   I was pleasantly surprised not only by the tenderness but the perfect doneness.   The taste was wonderful.

This works perfectly in an electric oven, however with my new gas oven, it cools off so quickly the meat does not continue cooking for long. I have to turn the oven back on and continue cooking, so I probably won't continue using this method. Works great for an electric oven though.

Ok so for whatever reason I am the worst at any and all things "Roast" HOWEVER this recipe is super easy and I was busy when I needed to turn the oven off so I texted (part where I went wrong) my daughter to see if she could do it and 15 mins later I realized she never responded so it cooked longer than it needed to and still...really good.

4.17 pound roast, followed the directions to the minute, it came out raw in the center.  

Newer Ovens release heat in some cases more quickly...our gas oven does i learned, despite costing thousands of dollars.  Had to "re-cook" ...suggestion going going foward, instead of doing the first 21 Mins at 475, do it for forty or so minutes instead.

I was nervous to try this, but so glad I did!  It was cooked perfect!  And so easy! The only hard part was not peeking and worrying it wouldn't be cooked. So good, juicy and tender. I sliced the meat on the thinner side which was more tender then the few thick cuts I had. 
Tomorrow will be cold roast beef sandwiches for lunch.

Good in theory. Glad I read reviews but still mine was overcooked. I’ll decrease the time quite a bit next time. Mine was 4 lbs and I had a bit of braising liquid in a Dutch oven so it does make sense. First time mistakes. Next time!!!

This was the best eye of round recipe I have ever made.  I have always had trouble getting this cut o f  meat to be tender when I want it  to be rare.  It’s such a lean cut that  I  hardly ever buy it.  The grocery store  was running a great special on them that I decided I would try this recipe from allrecipes that had been sent to me online.  I am so blade I did.  I followed the recipe as is- it turned out rare, tender, and super flavorful.  Definitely a repeat customer:

I added pressed garlic to the roast. 7min per pound and 2 hours was too long for a small 2lb roast.. Meat temp was 151 and medium well. Will have to try again now that I know our oven doesn't lose temp. Taste was fine. Meat was tender just overcooked for us.

I’m sorry it did not work well for me , it was very tough , and dry was not happy with it at all . I did it just as it says to , I was very disappointed. And no flavor at all , didn’t even smell it cooking , just set off my smoke alarm.

I followed the instructions and the roast stopped cooking at 133°. I had to turn the oven back on and it was not ready in time. And I know it’s not my oven because my oven is brand new.

This is the recipe I have been using for 3 years I want to thank you !  It cooks perfect every time my 16 year old son just loves it.  I have used both gas and electricity for cooking it and either way it’s always perfect.

This was perfect for me and tender.  I forgot to turn the oven off at exactly 28 minutes for the 4 pounds and it was still nice and tender.  They family said it would have been perfect if I turn off the oven on time.  I will be making it like this again.

I've made this recipe 3 times and all with wonderful results!  I make this cut of beef for sandwiches, to eat instead of deli beef, which has far too much salt, and other mystery ingredients.  Last time I made this I had a 4.5 lb eye of round.  I used the temperatures in the recipe - preheated at 500, then dropped to 475, and I kept the roast in for 25 minutes (about 5 min/lb).  I turned off the oven and checked the roast temperature - it was about 130.  I left it in 10 more minutes, temped it (140) and took it out and let it rest about 20 min.  It was a perfect medium rare.  I slice it thin with a sharp knife, and it makes a perfect sandwich!  ALSO  - it freezes perfectly!  I made a big roast so I can freeze for sandwiches later.  I froze it in 1 lb chunks using a vacuum sealer.   When I thawed it a few weeks later, it was perfect, and even better if possible!  This recipe may not work for those who like their beef well-done.  I think 2 hours or more would make a very over-done, tough piece of meat.  Check the temperature of the meat at 1 hour, and maybe set the oven at 200 so the roast will keep cooking until you have your desired temperature.  I will make this over and over again!!

I’ve made it twice.  Both times I prepared the roast by piercing it with one of those tenderizing gadgets (sorry I don’t remember the name) and marinated the roast overnight in a concentrated beef stock and olive oil with lots ogAbsolutely perfect both times.  If you have a deli style meat slicer , let this roast cool overnight in the refrigerator and slice it into wonderful shaved sandwich meat.  Perfect im a bun with an au jus dip!

I tried this recipe because I had just bought an eye of round and wasn't sure how to cook it. Followed the instructions exactly as written. Very easy to make. Gave it 3 stars because when finished the meat was still a little tough for my liking.

I think this recipe is about as good as you can get for this cut of meat.  The meat wasn't great, it wasn't bad, but it was OK.  But my kids and I were underwhelmed, especially after reading all the reviews.   Except for the pinkest part in the middle, the rest of the meat needs to have something on it like gravy, steak sauce, mustard, etc.  I'll slice up the leftovers and use them for sandwiches, but won't be making this again.

I use top, or bottom round.  It finishes medium-rare, and is always tender.  Sometimes I pat onion powder & garlic powder or salt onto it.  Sometimes I drizzle with teriyaki sauce then sprinkle with ground ginger.  Sometimes just salt and pepper.    However you want to season it...it's very versitile.

It was very good. I followed the directions exactly however it was cooked a little too much for me otherwise I would have given it 5 stars. Next time I am going to cook it at 6 min per lb. to see how that works.

I love this recipe, I use this method now for cooking all my roasts. I have bought nothing but the cheapest cuts since I read this and have rarely disappointed. You have to make sure you are getting the cheaper cut of a high grade beef to begin with - there is only so much a cooking method can do.  I have actually started doing this with boneless leg of lamb as well. Uses less energy and the cook is excellent.

I've been seeing recipes for high heat cooking; I tried this recipe; I will never make it again; nor any other 'high heat' recipe; it did not work; still uncooked blood around edges, internal temp never got near 145;  unappealing roast to say the least; I do not recommend this for anyone who is already a chef, as it is disappointing

I make this with top round and it is wonderful, mouth-watering  rare to medium-rare meat. The hard part is finding a roast that is 3 lbs or more at my local markets.  If my roast is a little smaller  I reduce the time the meat rests in closed oven by about 10 to 15 minutes.

This was super simple and sooooo tender. The only thing I did differently was after the initial high temp roast was to turn my oven down to 200 degrees for the last bit instead of turning oven completely off. Sliced thinly and served with roasted potatoes. My roast was 4 1/2 pounds so the initial roast time I did was 28 minutes. Definitely making again!!

This is a wonderful recipe and the roast comes out perfect. BUT you must have a newer oven for this recipe to work. The reason is insulation. The new ovens are very insulated and will stay hot for a long time.

Followed the recipe to the letter. After the exact time prescribed, the temp was nowhere near 145. I put it back in the oven which was now Stone cold. I put the oven temp to 175 and left it another half hour. Internal temp was still only 130. I decided I must have a faulty thermometer and took it out, covered it will foil and got on with side dishes. After 20 minutes I cut the fist slice. Almost completely raw and cold in the centre. Back in the oven at a higher temp. The 
first slice was decent enough so I bit into it. Chewy and not at all tender. Now it's 7:30 and I have carrots and potatoes to serve. Very disappointing. I think this recipe depends on your stove. Mine is brand new and heats up and cools down quickly. I will go back to my tried and true roasting method!

It would help to know if the roast was at room temperature when put into the oven;  I always put beef in the oven at room temp.  That might be the reason some people had their roast turn out raw.   I'm going to make this tonight and will edit my review.

I slipped garlic cloves into the roast, sprinkled the top with celtic sea salt and cracked pepper, marinated for two hours in apple cider vinegar and amino acids, then continued as the recipe called for.  Fantastic!!

Just made it and it came out perfect! Honestly, I didn't think it would work. I followed advice from others. Left 2.2 lb roast out for about 40 minutes so that it reached room temperature. Cooked for about 16-17 minutes at 475 degrees, then used warm setting on stove for curing time. Adjusted curing time based on 3 lb roast calculations, roughly about 1:45 mins or so. Internal temperature of roast was about 140 degrees when done.

2 1/2 hrs if you like it medium. It was great, but I'll shave 15.minutes next time  - roast beef should be rare!

I followed this and had the best eye roast. I did forget to turn oven down to 475 and it stayed at 500 for 7 minutes a pound then I turned it off.  Following one reviewer advise I timed about 15 minutes more per pound for it to "coast" and it was almost exactly that amount of time for thermometer to reach 135. I took it out and tented it and let it sit until we were ready to carve it later. Perfect. I did follow cooks Illustrated and salted it 24 hours ahead of time and wrapped and refrigerated. I got it out to get to room temp before baking and baked in on a rack uncovered. Spices were Penzey Chicago rub and maybe a total 1 teaspoon oil rubbed over it before cooking.  Perfection.

I had a 6.3lb eye of round roast.  I trimmed off all the fat except for the top side, but did thin that some.  Cooked it as the recipe said, 7 minutes per lb. (rounded down to 42 minutes) and rested in the oven for 2 1/2 hours.  It came out beautiful, tender and juicy.  I did a heavy dusting of garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper before roasting and the crust was delicious too.  My wife and kids also loved it!

Followed through with instructions. I added a little of my own seasoning. Meat tenderizer. Since my family does not like meat that is rare, I cooked it for 20 mins per pound and still came out wonderful.

I've done it exactly as written with many different sized Eye Roasts (adjusting the cook time obviously) and it comes out perfect every time! Thank you for this full proof and super easy recipe!

Welll... I purchased my roast from cCostco and followed the directions perfectly. Tough does not tell the story. I did make a sauce, beef broth, garlic, Bay and Worcestershire sauce, simmered.  You can tell your meat is tough just by watching the meat on your plate absorb the sauce!  Next time I will go with my instincts and pot roast it.

Made this in my gas oven, so followed the instructions to keep oven at 200 degrees for the 2 1/2 hours, after it's high temperature roast time was completed.  It came out perfectly.  Tender and delicious.  I love the recipes I find on this website.  I do get such a laugh though,  when people don't follow the recipes, and then complain about the results.  I think you should do the recipe as written, the first time u try it, and then if u like it,  feel free to try your inspirational changes.  Thank all for the recipes and ideas I find here.

No changes. Covered roast in salt an placed in refrigerator uncovered the day before cooking. Held dry out the roast. Came out ok on the next day. Place in refrigerator and served the next day. Was able to slice in much thinner and it tasted great. Will make again.

We like our beef rare so I roasted at 475 for 21 min. and let sit in oven 2 hrs.  It was pink but not rare so will adjust time in oven to 1 hour.  Flavor was great with nice seasoned crust...sliced super thin

The roast cane out exactly as stated, but it was a little to rare for my palette. I will try again, but will cook for an additional 30 minutes as per one reviewer's suggestion.

OMG!  I made a 3.2 pound roast in my "newer" electric oven (american) according to these directions and I was THRILLED with the outcome.  I truly think that the type of oven makes a big difference.

Our roast turned out succulent and moist after resting for 20 minutes.  It was NOT tough.

My husband took the leftovers to work the next day for lunch for his friends.  While I was packing  his lunch I noticed that the meat was still juicy (even though it was cold and straight out of the refrigerator). 

His coworkers asked about the seasonings.  This recipe is less about the seasonings and more about the method.

Thanks for a great recipe!!  You've made me look like a star!

The roast was.not tender at all. My family was not happy that I wasted a perfectly good roast that way. I did my next.one.the old fashioned way & it was perfect! I will keep my options open.for.something else from your site. Love most.of.the things I try & am looking forward to the next.one I try. Thanks

never thought about the sides until it was in the oven and oops..no place to put the potato casserole until it was done.  
put the roast in the toaster oven on low once it was done to keep warm but I think it was a bit more done than I wanted.  
Lesson learned, do sides that need no simultaneous oven time.  
Will make again, was a great way to cook this cut of meat

I made this using bottom round roast as eye if round is not cheap in my area. Followed directions exactly sliced it thin and it was best roast ever! I only cook them this way now! Get the slicer out and slice super thin and it makes the best roast beef sandwiches. On the rare occasion there are left overs I freeze them in boil n bags with brown gravy, served over pasta rice or potatoes and frozen veggies it makes for a great week night meal I can have on the table in under 20 minutes.

I have used this method to cook eye of round roast numerous times and have never been disappointed. The roast turns out perfect every time and is so tender. The leftovers (if there are any) are perfect for sandwiches.

I tried this recipe exactly. At the end of 2 1/2 hrs with the oven off the roast was cold and tough. I warmed it at 350 for 30 minutes. It was better. It did look like the picture. Next time I will turn the oven to 160 for 2- 2 1/2 hours.

My roast was 2.5lbs.  At the end of cook time the roast was too red, still a bit tough and cold.  Not sure how same amount of time could have worked for the called for 3lbs. I reheated oven to 350 and cooked for about 10 more mins.  That fixed it... Otherwise quite good.

It turned out great, however, I had to put it back in the oven at 350 after the 2 hours to warm it up.  It was cool by then.  Was medium rare.

Very easy! However I will marinate the roast or spice it up next time. I like a bit more flavoring. Had to leave oven on 200 else it automatically cools itself. So I did 15 min per pound after the initial 7min per lb. Rare!! Maybe 17 per lb next time.

Super easy and turned out great. Added potatoes to pan (well -salted skins) and they cooked along with the roast. Last 10 minutes, sauteed carrot chunks and onion in olive oil with dried herbs (I used mint and tarragon) , then braised in white wine until tender crisp, splashed with white wine vinegar before serving. I will do this again.

Make sure you watch the video!!!  I read the reviews, followed directions to a T.  only difference was I used a glass dish. (Which wasn't specified anywhere except video)  Ruined a perfectly good swiss and bacon stuffed roast,just because I used glass instead of metal pan.

This is a great recipe for tender meat. I also wrap the finished roast in aluminum foil for 5 to 10 minutes to lock in the juices.  Delicious

I followed the directions but after the directed cooking time, the roast was not nearly done.  I reheated the oven to 375 degrees and baked till done, about 30 minutes.  It wasn't bad, it was just tough.  My range is not old, and though I haven't tested the temperature, this is the only failure I've had.

I made a mistake in my calculations and over cooked the roast. Make sure you cook for 7 minutes per pound and you'll be fine.

Since hubs and my daughter prefer all meat non-red, we tried the option discussed in the reviews of: 39-min at 475 followed by 90 min with the oven off and closed. It was still a bit pink. It was more done than I would have preferred, but sliced thin, it was well received, and I did enjoy it. Methinks the  original recipe would be even better. There was nice flavor in the drippings, which we decided to make into gravy with browned butter and browned flour... since we had mashed potatoes instead of bread or popovers.  So surprised by the simple process. Thank you so much!

We loved it! I coated it with salt, pepper and Montreal steak seasonong. Then cooked the 1.3 lb roast at 475 for 10 min, shut off oven and left in about 90 min. I wanted it not red in center or even overly pink bc was afraid my little one would be grossed out by rare meat. I'm not going to lie...I overcooked it a bit. I was med well but I will next time try 7 min at 475 and leave in 50 min to see what happens. We are all of this slices very thin... amazing flavor and I will tweak this recipe. Yum yum

how do you make a side dish if you cant open your oven? slice up some potatoes, ham and onions, place in a glass bowl in layers with cheddar cheese, cover in foil  and put in with the roast  - when you roast is done, so are your scalloped potatoes

Had to be reheated using a new gas oven. Next time, I’m not turning it off... leaving it at 225°F. 1-3/4 hours. A slow cook after the sear should do good. I’ll play around with it. The garlic didn’t soften with this recipe... aint nobody got time for that.

I followed this recipe closely but it did not turn out at all. I finished my side dishes as the time wound down. When the timer went off I didn't even need gloves. It was below room temperature, my thermometer barley even recorded anything. Totally bummed.

I used this recipe last week, and it turned out well. I added more seasonings (garlic, celery flakes, creole seasoning, and onion. ) I had a larger roast, so I adjusted accordingly when timing the high temperature roasting.  I had doubts the roast would be done after the long cooling in the oven. But it turned out great - not over or under done and moist on the inside. I would make it again, and, if I did, I might shorten the cooking time a little bit because my family likes it more rare.

I've made this many, many times. It's a great way to cook a tough piece of meat. We use several pressed garlic cloves and cover the meat. Follow that with a generous coating of salt and pepper. The high temperature will start the crust on the roast. If you like it rare to medium rare, only leave it in the oven for an hour and 15 minutes or so or it'll be too well done.

I have a lot of children and need the meat to be a bit more done, so I baked for 9 minutes per pound. It was so juicy and tender!! A new favorite way of doing a roast.

No changes and I rubbed a McCormick's Grill Mates Montreal steak seasoning all over the roast before baking.  A hit with my family and I'd never cooked a roast of this type before.  Now when this Eye-of-Round beef roast is on sale, I'll buy it again just for this recipe.

I made this with a bottom round roast.  I rubbed the roast with oil and seasonings and sealed in a plastic zip lock bag overnight. Took out the next day to bring it to room temp. Then followed the cooking process. It turned out very good a nice pink and quite tender. will make this again.

This was simple and the roast came out great!   I was a little worried as there was really no way to make a good gravy, but roast didn't need it. It was moist and flavorful.  The only change I made was to sprinkle the roast with salt, pepper and onion powder before cooking it.

At the suggestion of many, I went out and got one of those in-oven thermometers that goes off when it gets to temp. Definitely glad I did that because it never got to temp! I noticed it slowed way down and eventually stopped at 128 degrees. Luckily I was keeping an eye on it and after several minutes of it not moving I turned the oven up to 250. When it still didn’t move for several minutes, I turned it up to 300. I let it go a little longer than I normally would have since the temp rose so slowly at the end, so I took it out at 135. Sadly, when I cut into it it was well done. I will say, it came out very tender for a cheap, lean cut of meat- especially being well done. I think that was thanks to the slow cooking. However, I think it ended up cooked through (despite the thermometer reading) because of the varied heat at the very end. I would try this method again for a cheap cut, but maybe leave it at 475 maybe another 7 minutes before turning the oven off.

I used kosher salt and garlic pepper and seasoned a 3 lb eye round roast in the morning, cooked in the evening. I did the high temp for 20 minutes. But, then I got nervous about the timing and the whole "turn off the oven" aspect. After about 20 minutes off, I turned the oven back on at 200 degrees (electric oven). I pulled it out to check after 1.5 hours of cooking and it was 132 degrees. I pulled it out and let it sit, so it went up to 140 or so. It was delicious and perfect medium rare!

I have made this using standing rib roast, beef tenderloin and strip roast. All have come out equally delicious. I have a gas oven so half way thru I put the oven on warm and it comes out a perfect medium rare to medium. Perfect for Sunday supper.

I have a brand new high end gas oven. I followed the directions exactly and after 2 1/2 hours the internal temperature of the 2 pound roast was 101 degrees. It was so tough that when I tried to remove the thermometer it got stuck and pulled apart.  Back in the oven it goes..a little more time at a regular roasting temp and it should be salvageable!

Such an unusual method but the meat came out perfectly. I salted the meat early and let it sit in the fridge with the salt on down a few hours. Next time I’ll add more seasoning. Delicious that night with gravy and potatoes and even better the next day sliced thin with au jus on a roll

Taste was good. The timing did not work for me. It ended in a hangry family and need to microwave slices.

This was great! So nervous about doing it,but so happy I did! I took the suggestion of the first review to put the “gravy master” sauce on the roast before hand as well as garlic powder. I wanted to roast carrots as a side, so when the 2.5 hrs was up I turned on the oven up to 425 and kept the roast inside while it was pre-heating. Once per-heated, I took the roast out and put the carrots in while roast was settling. Turned out perfectly medium-rare!

I used only a 2.25 lb. roast, and it turned out beautifully!  The only problem was that it was cold at the end of the roasting time!  How can I retain heat for serving?  A foil tent?  It was
really delicious!

Finally tried cooking a roast like this, ours was 2.5 lbs so I cooked it in preheated oven at 525°for 12 minutes and then shut off oven.
Make sure you let it sit out for while to get to room temp prior to cooking. It was delicious and all plates were  clean, definitely doing this way from now on.

This was just fantastic!  As other reviews recommended, I lowered the oven from 500 after 24 mins to 200 since I have a gas oven and then removed it after 2 1/2 hours.  I marinaded the roast in a packet of Montreal steak seasoning in the fridge for about an hour beforehand.  I then filled my crockpot with vegetables, poured the marinade over the vegetables, and cooked on high for 3 hours.  Wow!

I Made this for the first time today and it was delicious and so easy. I pre heated oven to 500 for a good 20 minutes, then put roast in and turned down to 475 degrees and cooked for 15 min. (I only has a 2 lb roast). When time was up instead of turning off I set  temp to 200  and cooked for for 40 min.  Then When that was done I shut off and left in oven for another 40 min and it was perfect.  Served with gravy , mashed potatoes!!

This is a perfect way to dry roast other beef roasts.  500 degrees 7 minutes per pound. Turn off oven, never open oven door for 2 1/2 hours.  Makes a fantastic med rare rib roast. Perfection!

Removed roast from fridge for an hour (2 lb). Preheated oven to 500 for 20 mins. Brushed roast a few mins before roasting with very soft butter & seasoned with Montreal Steak seasoning. Roasted at 475 for 6 mins per lb.....12 mins. Turned off oven & let sit for 2 hrs. Awesome. We like it a bit more rare so next time I will roast 5 or 5.5 per lb & try removing at 90 mins. But this was delish! Thanks for sharing!

The recipe was simple..the flavor was there....I’m just wondering about the cooking procedure. Was this cooked in an electric oven? I have gas and am wondering if that’s  perhaps why it didn’t really cook correctly because of venting?). When I pulled it out of the oven at the correct time...it was actually cool to the touch?? definitely did NOT need oven mits! I’ve cooked many dishes in this oven without any problems but have also never turned it off to keep cooking for such a long time..... thoughts out there?

I followed the cooking directions exactly and to my surprise the roast came out exactly as described!  I did use a roasting rack though and next time I will probably cook it in a pan with foil (uncovered) it can simmer in the juices and I can easily save the au jus for leftovers.

Soooo good! I read the reviews and was hopeful my experience would be similar with this normally tough cut. IT WAS AMAZING! I followed the instructions to a tee, paired with mashed potatoes and broccoli and wish I'd made gravy but it didn't really need it. So incredibly tender! I like mine a little more rare, I think next time I'll try a few minutes less.

I have no idea what I did wrong! I had a 3.65 lb roast. I preheated the oven to 500, the dropped it to 475 for 21 min. then turned it off. 2.5 hrs later I cut into it and EW!! Cooked all the way through. Tough as leather. What did I do wrong!?

This roast is so easy to make, and it turns out so tender. It's a favorite in our house! It's a perfect recipe for those hot days when you don't want the oven on for hours but you want to have a nice roast for dinner.

This recipe is wonderful.  The only changes I have made was to add different seasonings each time I make it.  We have tried garlic, southwest seasonings and a barbecue dry rub.  Each time the roast turns out perfectly!

I made an eye roast for my 87 year old dad as a surprise a couple months ago, and what a surprise it was!  It was tough, dry and darn near inedible!  Obviously, I didn’t do my research!  Just tried this method, and holy moly, this is so fantastic!  It’s moist & tender & absolutely perfect!  I’ll never cook a roast any other way!  Thanks so much!

This recipe made a eye of round roast from the clearance bin taste like  a much fancier roast beef.  We especially liked it cold on sandwiches with horseradish sauce.  Trying it again today with another clearance bin cut (chuck) to see if it works for that too.  Where has this recipe been all my life!

I did this with an eye of round, skeptically ... and it turned out tasty and tender.   I did cook it in aluminum foil to keep it moist, and was glad I did.

Used a 5 1/2 lb roast so I roasted it at 475 for 40 minutes per the 7 minutes per lb instructions. I also cut celery, onions, carrots, and potatoes into bite-sized chunks and placed them underneath the roast, highly recommend! I think the vegetables further flavored the roast and were a perfect side dish.

Followed this recipe to the letter. After 1 hour, my (1 year old electric) stove was cool to the touch, so I read the comments and saw instructions to turn our stove on low for the rest of the time if that happened. So I did that for another hour. The internal temperature of the roast was 65 degrees. Never making this recipe again!

I followed the top reviewer's suggestions, and for the most part, they worked well. That included brushing with browning sauce, then salt, pepper, garlic powder, and I added onion powder. My roast was only 2 lbs, so I did 14 min in 500F oven, then left in oven 40 min (20 min per lb), and let rest 20 min. I would have preferred this more on the rare side; a little too done for me. Maybe the size makes a difference? The next time, if I use a roast this small, I will either try lowering the temp to 450F or cutting down on the bake or standing time. I sliced it very thin, and it's very good. A little more rare would have been that much better, though. Thanks for the recipe. UPDATE: Used leftovers to make Beef Mushroom & Barley Soup as well as  thinly slicing beef into strips and stir-frying briefly in pan that I stir-fried multi-colored pepper strips with garlic. Both came out great!

The only way to make an eye of round.  I make it all the time.  I have a meat slicer and sometime slice it very thin and immerse it in Au Jus with Italian seasoning.

I've done this twice and ruined two perfectly good roasts.  There's got to be more to the instructions.  What temperature should the meat start at?  I just put a 3.8 lb roast in for 27 minutes at 500 then turned off the oven.  It's been nearly 2 hours and the temperature is 104F.  It hasn't risen a degree in the past 15 minutes.  I'm going back to my tried and true method of putting it in a 225F oven until the internal temperature is 135.

It was still raw! This recipe should be removed from the site, as I followed directions to a "T" and it ruined my dinner. I had to re-cook the roast and by that time it made the meat so tough-uggh! DON'T USE THIS RECIPE.

This was the first time I made Eye of Round like this, and the only way to go. I've done this with a number of different cuts now. Rump Roast, Sirloin roast, (which can be a hit or miss cut)  We are empty nesters, so whatever is leftover, gets put on the slicer for sandwiches. This cooking method has not disappointed yet.

It was ok.  Easy to make, but it could have been done a little more (even for me).  Needed to warm it up a little after slicing.

my roast was almost 3 lb so I seasoned it put it in the pan and roasted it at 500 for the 7 minutes per pound and left it in there untouched for an additional two and a half hours. At the end of that time I removed it and it was a little less than lukewarm and I would call it rare! being as I was counting on that for dinner I had to Nuke it luckily it was a good piece of meat and still quite tasty but certainly not tender. this recipe just didn't work for me, I'm sure I just did something wrong, that seems to happen more and more over 50!

I followed the recipe exactly, and preheated the oven for 20 minutes as suggested by another reviewer.  I used a digital thermometer with a probe that beeped when the roast reached 145 F.  That only took about 1-1/2 hours, so I was glad I'd used the probe.  It smelled delicious while it was cooking.   After letting it sit for about 15-20 minutes to let the juices reabsorb, I sliced it thinly and it appeared to be about "medium" - just slightly pink.  By the time we sat down to eat it looked, and tasted, medium-well.   I imagine that it would have been extremely well done had I left it in for 2-1/2 hours.  The flavor was good, however it was not tender and was way too overcooked for our taste.  My husband and I decided we MIGHT try it again, but only IF we can get a roast on sale, as I found that eye of round is no longer an inexpensive cut.  If we do try again, I will pull it out when the internal temperature is 130-135 F, but I'm not sure we'll bother.

I seasoned it with kosher salt, pepper, Italian seasoning and garlic powder.  Used the 'warm' feature on my oven instead of shutting it off - hoping for a more medium than medium rare.  Worked great!  Hubs loved the crust from the fat cap and the spices.  Will make again!

This is a great recipe for an inexpensive cut of meat. You really need to follow what it says. It's very strange to cook something this way, but it works. Slice it thin with some horseradish sauce and au jus. Everyone will enjoy it.

I See a lot of folks having trouble with gas ovens... I too have a gas convection oven, however mine came out perfect ! The only modification was I did not turn oven down for initial roasting. Left it at 500 for 5 min per pound . Also I preheated for about an hour beforehand...maybe that helped ?

We enjoyed it as much as the tenderloin we had New Year's eve.  Sliced very very very thin - great on a fresh Kaiser roll.  Need a super sharp carving knife to do it.  Have made this roast three times now  --  I coat with olive oil enough to hold the Montreal steak seasoning on and let her fly.

Great Recipe!! I totally season the meat in seasoned salt or Montreal seasonings. I do cook it longer, like 40 minutes and it still comes out MR to Med!! For the well or MW folks I saute up some Au JUs and then slice the meat and cook in Au Jus to desired temp. We have this rosat often, and it makes for a great sandwich the next few days!

Excellent. Have to admit I was skeptical that a cheaper roast could be as tender and tasty as mine turned out—I was proven wrong. Even ended up putting it still slightly frozen in the 500 degree oven.  Followed the recipe exactly.

I made this recipe again tonight. Comes out perfect every time! You don’t have to use an eye round roast. I used a try tip tonight and it worked just as well. I covered my roast with olive oil, salt, pepper and garlic salt. Put it in the oven for 14 minutes as we had a small 2 pound roast. Like clockwork, two hours later, it was absolutely the best. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

My 2 lb roast had not completely thawed.  I dried it off and coated it with avacado oil and inserted 5-6 garlic slivers in small cuts the seasoned with sea salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder.  I preheated the pan and oven for 20 minutes then put the roast in for 20 minutes to ensure it thawed.  I did not turn the temp down.  I also inserted a digital remote thermometer and when it reached 148 i let it rest. I sliced it super thin and it was absolutely delicious.  I sautéed onions and celery in butter and when it started to sweat i added some flour and let that cook for a minute before adding beef broth and the fond. It turned out fantastic and all plates were empty.  A definite keeper

This recipe turned out perfect for me - the whole family loved it and I will definitely make this my go to recipe for cooking a beef eye round.  I'm only giving it four stars because I feel like this could be hit or miss depending on your oven and how well done you like the meat.  I followed the suggestions of some of the other reviewers, making sure the roast was at room temperature and the oven preheated at 500 degrees for a good thirty minutes before putting the roast in.  I cooked a 3lb eye round at 500 (not 475) for 21 minutes and then turned the oven off.  I removed the roast after 2 hours, checked with a meat thermometer (it read 125 ).   I then let it rest for 20 minutes before carving.  It looked dry and crusty but was a perfect, tender,  medium rare.

I don't usually buy this cut of meat however the sale was to good to pass up.   I found this recipe and was a little unsure but this is the only way I will ever make this roast again.   I am even looking forward to another sale of the Black Angus version of this roast.   So easy, perfect center, AND TENDER plus the taste is delish!!!   I made it just as stated I may add a little garlic powder when I make it for tonight, maybe.   You need to try this!!!

Love this one, I coated the roast in Montreal Steak Spice and let it sit out for a few hours (covered) to bring it up to room temp. Then roasted as listed and LOVED IT!!! I’ve done this ones for several dinner parties and always get asked for the recipe. Thank you for posting!!

The recipe was a success!  I followed it as written, except I didn’t turn the oven off after 26 minutes(my roast was nearly 4lbs) instead I lowered the oven to 200..and left it in for 80 minutes.  I was pleasantly excited.  The one issue I had was the lack of taste...I should have seasoned it better.  We sliced it thinly and enjoyed a slight pink center and tender treat!

Making this for the 2nd time.  My first was last Christmas and it was amazing!  Crusty and browned on the outside and perfectly med rare on the inside.  I'll never cook a roast beef any other way. Super easy and great with yorkshire puddings.

This is my go-to recipe every Christmas.  I do put seasoned salt on the roast.  If  you have a guest that won't eat rare meat, have a saucepan with beef broth on the stove and quickly dip their meat in the hot broth.

I had seen this recipe before but didn’t use it.   Having just used it and had a wonderful result, I regret not using it prior to now.   I am a very experienced cook and this recipe produced the most delicious eye round roast I have ever eaten!  I am very grateful.  Thank you!

I really liked  this technique for this cut of meat but the resting time in the oven is way too long. I followed another reviewer's suggestion to go by 20 minutes per pound. I went a little longer because I was scared it would be too rare but it actually would have been perfect. Will do that next time!

I followed the recipe to a T and my roast was undercooked and cold. The meat was still tough and raw. I never opened the oven and weighed my roast for the right cooking time. The only thing that could have been wrong on my part is that it’s very cold in my house.

I followed the directions except for adding some garlic powder along with the salt and pepper and I was very happy with the results.  My roast turned out medium, hot and pink inside and was very tender when sliced thinly.  I will definitely use this recipe again.  The leftovers were excellent with brown gravy over egg noodles.

Followed the recipe, but meat only reached internal temp of 122.  Apparently not good for gas ovens.  Cut it up into thick slices and back into the oven to finish cooking in its drippings.  After the second cooking, it was very tasty and tender.

I rubbed the roast outside with salt, pepper and seasonings I like and I did not lower the heat to 475.. Either my oven does not get hot enough or it does not hold the heat long enough as I had to fiddle with the time. Once I got that figured out - perfection. A friend uses a version of this for his New Years prime rib and it is awesome.

The cooking method worked great!  I roasted the meat a little longer than called for because preference:  Took 3.7 pound roast out of the refrigerator about 30 minutes ahead of time, then preheated oven to 500, at that temp for about 10 minutes.  Put roast into oven and lowered temp to 475, roasted for 30 minutes.  Turned off heat, left in the oven for about 1+3/4  hour.  Removed from oven, inserted digital thermometer, covered with foil and waited until internal temp rose to 145, about another 30 minutes.  It was still fairly dark pink inside which was okay for me, but if I had the same size roast I would leave temp at 475 for about 45 minutes to cook it just a little bit longer.  The only real change I made was to sprinkle roast with garlic powder along with the salt and pepper.  Next time, I'll add one or two fresh rosemary sprigs to the pan.  All in all, a terrific way to cook a roast - it doesn't get much easier than this.  One last thing - be sure to slice it as thin as you can.  I served with horseradish sauce and some blue cheese salad dressing.

I can't believe this worked! I followed the directions exactly. When I pulled it from the oven, it looked incredibly dry - almost like a loaf of bread. I left it to rest for 20 minutes. Then I was amazed at how tender and juicy it was when I sliced it. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a great way to make an eye of round roast gourmet!  I  had a smaller roast, around 1.8 lb., so I cooked for 12 minutes at 500 degrees.  I didn't lower it down to 475 because I wanted a good browning on the outside.  I left it to sit in the oven for 2 hours, since my roast was smaller.  If I had a larger roast, I would of had to turn my oven on low for the last few minutes, because I noticed at 2 hours that my oven was barely warm on the inside.  I served the sliced meat with a horseradish sauce mixture of 1/2 cup sour cream, 1-2 tbs. dijon mustard, 1 tbs. horseradish, and parsley.  It paired so well with the meat.  I also rubbed the outside of the meat with a little more seasonings than just salt and pepper.  I can't wait to make this again!  Thank you for the recipe!

Perfect!! My mother in law does this with  a prime rib roast, and works great if it's not too big like over 5 lbs. The only thing I do differently is I always use kosher salt on beef as it makes a nice crust and I use lots!! Use this recipe to make French dip sandwiches!! Yummy!

I made this for the first time yesterday. I followed the directions exactly. Everyone liked it. It was tender and juicy. The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars, is because it wasn't very warm, after following the directions. Next time I think, that I will cut the cooking time by 15 minutes and turn the oven back on for 15 minutes at the end of the standing time, at maybe 350.

Take it out when internal temp is 120 and tent with foil for a full 30 minutes before carving. 145 is insane. There is no way the pretty pink meat in the picture was cooked to 145. Otherwise the technique is right on.

I made it just as instructed.  I thought it was perfect, but it was a bit rare for my husband.  That was easily fixed just by cooking a bit longer.  Great way to fix a roast of this kind.

I think this turned out very well & was a really easy way to make a roast.  I had enough drippings to make gravy too which was a plus!

This was soooooooo easy and turned out amazing!  I had a 4.5 lb roast so I cooked it at 500 for 30  mins. Then shut the oven off and let it sit for the 2.5 hrs. I think it could have been taken out at 2 hrs and would have been great too. It was a LITLLE more medium cooked then I would have preferred but I think my natural gas oven cooks things a bit faster so I'll have to adjust the initial high cook time to be a little less then the suggested 7 mins per pound. It was very juicy and tender however so I was very surprised at that! And there was plenty of beef juice to make a fantastic gravy! Thanks for this recipe!

I took the suggestion of other gas oven users and turned the temperature down to 200 degrees after the initial 21 minutes at 475. The roast came out beautifully. Flavorful and juicy. You'll never turn it into a tender cut of meat like a rib roast. It's just too lean of a cut, but this is a superior method for roasting.

I seasoned mine with Adobo and cooked it exactly as directed - it was DELICIOUS! However, my mom likes her meat well-done and she was visiting, so I put the heat back on for a little while longer at 350 to get rid of the red. STILL DELICIOUS! I will be making my roasts like this every time!

Roast was raw with an internal temp of 117 degrees. Maybe it was the oven itself. I'm a renter, so not quite sure how old it is. Was really hopeful that I could finally make an eye of round that was tender. I won't try this again, at least with this oven.

I used a small toaster oven. 7 min per  pound at 500° , then turned the temp to 200° for  2 hours  and it turned out a perfect medium rare! I used garlic salt, cut slits in the meat  to insert garlic cloves. I kept heat on as I felt the small oven would not  hold the heat. I will certainly make this again !

To make the roast tender I had to put it in the slow cooker for another 3 hrs. The roast was very tasty but I can't recommend it for a main dish. However, I loved the way it married up with sandwiches. Sliced right, with a little juice and some sport peppers on a piece of Italian bread it would be a great Chicago style Italian Beef sandwich.

It was Christmas day and I was cooking a lovely roast. I followed directions exactly. The family waited excitedly. I have 2 people who only eat the ends of the roast because they don't like rare. I took my roast out. Everything was ready and the table was set. When my husband cut into it I was very unhappy to see that it was nearly raw. The complete roast was raw and needed to be recooked.  I will not be brave enough to try this Ever again.

I'm not sure what cut of meat I had, so I was a little nervous about this method,  but it turned out tender and tasty.  It was 140 F when we took it out of the oven.   like it medium rare and it was closers to medium.

I followed the instructions about NOT opening the oven AT ALL after turning the heat off and my roast did not finish cooking.  Because of the injunction to NOT open the oven, I didn't find out that it wasn't done until just before we planned to eat.  I had to finish it up in the microwave.  
This might work for someone who has a better insulated oven and/or a meat thermometer that  stays in the meat while it cooks.  I think it might work for me if I transferred the meat to my slow cooker after the initial high heat searing.  I'll give it another try with our next beef.

I was very skeptical about this recipe;but  I thought "why not give it a go" and so I did. It was tender and just a hair over medium.The roast was tender and juicy. I will use the technique again ,but I will be a bit more free with the spices. I stuck to the S&P but next time I will blend in a bit of garlic and onion powder. I did miss my roasted veg and will have to think that out for next time (which will be soon ,since it was so nice).

Less is sometimes better, as with this recipe. I made it exactly as written and it turned out delicious. I sliced the roast super thin and used the juices from the roast to make an a jus to serve with it. Heavenly!

This recipe works beautifully for so many different cuts of beef.... eye of round, sirloin, london broil, etc.!  It is pretty much the only way I cook a beef roast in the oven.  I usually marinate my roast first, but even just a basically seasoned piece of meat comes out great with this cooking method.

The recipe is awesome.  I added Cajun seasoning with the salt and pepper.  After the roast cooled, I sliced the meat on a meat slicer and poured left over juices on the meat.  It made great roast beef sandwiches.  This is much better and healthier then deli roast beef.

I've been cooking since 15, but never attempted roasted beef before! This was easy, simple and came out delicious! Timing is critical,  so make sure you start early enough in your day/afternoon. Can't wait to try again and include olive oil kissed veggies.

I used PJL4965 recommendations because I had made before and knew this worked. Roasting 7 min per pound at the beginning makes this perfect for us! Can't wait for lunch!

After making this several times as written, it came consistently came out very rare, too much for us --- possibly my oven?  not sure......this idea is based on KacyBeth's review......This time we cooked it 9 minutes per pound, and rather than let it sit in the oven for 2 1/2 hours, it sat for 2 hours 10 minutes, then without opening the oven door, turned up the heat to 350 for the last 20 minutes.....took it out and let it rest for 20 minutes.....one end had just a hint of pink, and as it got to the thicker end, it went from pink to dark pink.....just perfect.....tender and delicious.

My husband loved it. Served with horseradish sauce. I cooked it a little bit longer. It was raw inside with 7 mins per pound. I doubled the time to get 160 temp inside for medium but the time I serve it, it was medium well. I will definite make this again but a little less time in the oven. I have to remind myself of the meat continue to cook after taking it out of the oven

When I took the roast out of the oven, I thought it was burned.  But the inside was nice and red and it tasted great.  My husband loved it.  Will make it again.

We bought this cut of meat for the first time didn't know what to do with it . Found this recipe and it is a slice of heaven on a plate. Love it, Love it, Love it. I agree with other people (Do Not Open the Oven) it is so worth the wait. And we rubbed minced garlic from the jar on ours too. Thank you so much for sharing. It is truely a keeper !!!.

It still boggles my mind how this method works but it came out SOO good.. I ended it at a little under 2.5 hours and I could have truly taken it out 20mins or so sooner, It was pink on the inside but I would have liked maybe a little less cooked. I like several others used some other spices in the rub I used and the crust was soo tasty & delicious... 

I will def use this EVERY time as my go to method for roast. Only downside for me is I usually make a gravy and with this there is no juices in the pan...  But the roast is soo good  you dont need the gravy.

I followed this recipe exactly, and it produced a tender, beautiful, perfectly cooked roast.  My only problem (and why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars) is that a part of the roast  was soft to the point of mushiness, with the consistency of pate, and this really detracted from the flavor.  Did anybody else have this problem?  I really would like to hear from other members because this is a great recipe, and I would like to make it again without this happening.  Thank you.

This is now the only way I'll ever cook a roast.  It's easy to switch up the seasonings to suit your taste.  I will cook slightly less next time, as my husband likes his roast beef "rare".  Ew.  It really does make a normally tough piece of meat tender and juicy.  Thank you for posting this recipe.  I've been doing it all wrong for years!

Honestly, I do not understand all of the rave reviews for this  roast beef technique.  Either my oven runs comparatively hot (which, as far as I can tell, it does not - it actually runs slightly cool according to thermometers) or I simply like my roast beef far rarer than the average American.

I roasted an eye of round subprimal using this method and it came out medium-well, light gray and pink all the way through.  It was, sadly, ruined - at least to our tastes.   We need our beef to be at least rare, hot red in the center.  I even tend to like it nearly "blue".  If you like medium/medium well roast beef, then this is a great technique to follow to the letter.

This was delicious.  But the temp reached 145 an hour early - since we needed to eat anyway we took the roast out and ate it.  It was delicious but not as tender as I would like.

I'm getting another roast the same size and try it again, only leaving it in for the full 2.5 hours regardless of the temp.  Very interested to see how it comes out!

Very good as long as it is thinly sliced.  I also rubbed and herb mixture all over and pan seared it on all sides before putting it in the oven.  Turned out awesome.

Followed instructions exactly. Cooked my 5.99 lb eye of round for 42 minutes, let rest in off oven 2.5 hours. I have never seen my husband enjoy anything I've made in 15 years so much ! Sliced for lunch meat in ziploc baggies in the freezer.

I normally never leave a written review but this recipe deserved it. I had been eyeing up this recipe for a while but was a little nervous to try it. I had a few day old roast in the fridge so I figure if it went wrong I wouldn't be as disappointed. I followed this recipe to the tee (and I tend to add my own stuff to recipes) and this came out crazy amazing. I literally set it and went out shopping. When I came home the oven felt cooler so I wasn't feeling too confident....until the first slice in. Best roast EVER  and cooked beautifully. Pink on the inside with a crusty outside.

I usually stay away from the eye roast because it doesn't have much flavor and comes out dry.  Eye roasts were on sale so I bought one and looked up a recipe for it.  I decided to use this recipe and it was delicious!  The roast was moist and full of of flavor.  I will always use this recipe for eye roast for now on!

Delish!!  Really wasn't sure what to expect but it was better than I ever anticipated.  Used to cook it low and slow but I will never do it that way again.  Cooked perfect!!!  We like our meat rare/med rare and that is exactly what it cooked too. Follow this recipe to a tee and you will get a great crusty roast on the outside while rare and juice on the inside . Yummm

This recipe was awesome.  I did use my own spice rub but was unsure on how to cook the roast.  This recipe was spot on.  I did the same as another reviewer and had to leave for a hike and did get back till well after the 2.5 hrs that it called for leaving the roast in the oven.  It was slightly warm and ready for us starving family members when we got back.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!!

This really did come out very tender for an inexpensive cut.  I cooked it in a high-sided roasting pan with sprigs of fresh herbs, whole cloves of garlic and pepper corn. I will definitely make it again.

I cooked up an 8.4lb eye of round with a 58 minute cook time before turning the oven off. after 2 hours I could tell that my oven had literally no heat left in it so for the last 20-30 minutes I put it on at 200 just to keep a little bit of heat going. I still let it rest for a good 20 or more minutes afterwards and the meat was perfect and a great temperature. Pink and juicy just like at a restaurant, if not better. 

It made enough juices for Yorkshire puddings and a good amount of gravy. 

If this recipe doesn't turn out for you then you are doing something wrong. The cut I used was huge and super cheap. It should have been terrible but was fantastic. 5 stars for sure

I made the recipe following some of the other reviews. I'm glad I did because I think if I left it in according to the original recipe it may have been over cooked. The change I made was leaving it in the oven 20min per lb after turning the oven off. I had a 3lb roast, so left it in for an hr and let it rest after taking it out. It was a beautiful medium, warm, juicy, and tender. I used garlic salt and fresh ground pepper as seasoning. I will try to play around with new seasonings the next time I make this. There will definitely be a next time :) Kids (ages 3, 9, 10, and 12) approved of the recipe.

I made this recipe as directed.  The roast was flavorful  and the drippings were delicious.  On the negative side the roast was lukewarm.  My Kitchenaid oven if fairly new.  I would try again but rather than turn off the over I will try  degrees .

This recipe is the real deal.   The only adjustments I made was for the weight (5.5lbs) and 90 minutes into the "sit" time - I brought the oven up to 275 seeing my oven doesn't hold heat too well. 

Could've sworn I was eating prime rib - makes excellent sandwiches the next day - no more deli roast beef for me.

This is a good method of cooking this cut, ez and came out tender and full of flavor, super easy ! I used a mix of garlic powder,  sea salt and cracked black pepper, rubbing it in thoroughly then letting roast come to room temp before cooking. Love to slice thin against grain, layering slices on plates with a small dollop of straight horseradish. Sublime.

I'm not one to review many recipes but I have to say something about this one. I prepared my roast with a mesquite blend we had laying around. I was very nervous because I've never cooked a roast like this before. I pretty much always make roasts in my crock pot but I wanted something different. I waited that 2 hours, opened the door, let my meat rest and sliced it up. OMG. It was the best roast I've ever eaten. I will make that cut exactly like this every time. It's marvelous.

Made this for first time. Only changes were adding rosemary, thyme, wrapping up tight with plastic wrap and letting sit overnight in fridge before cooking.  Just remember it is still round steak....not the most tender cut. But a little time and a sharp knife that can cut thin makes a huge difference in the final product.

I had a 4.3 lb eye of round roast and went exactly by directions. It smoked the whole house up and messed the oven (high end 30" kitchenaid) up big time. When the waiting period was up, it was so tough I could barely stick the meat thermometer into it. I used a butcher knife, cut it half into and banished it to the crockpot...hopefully it will be fit to eat after a period of time in there.

Absolutely delicious! Even my kids will eat this ...and we finish it, sopping up the juices with the meat, and pretty much licking the pan clean! absolutely do not open oven until it's time to take it out! Also, follow PJL4965s advice, especially about timing. If you do this right... And it's a very simple idea... You will love it. This is now a family favorite.

Au Jus for roast - mix 1 tbsp minced garlic, 1/2 tbsp rosemary, 3 bay leaves, a cup of low sodium soy sauce, 1 tsp peppercorns, 6 cups of low sodium beef broth and bring to a low rolling boil for 30 minutes or so. Strain and serve with roast.

This is such an easy way to make a roast! Love it! I always let the oven heat up to 500 for about 20 mins before I put the roast in and then cook it 7mins per pound. I also season the roast with garlic powder and onion powder. Yum!

Delicious. I purchased a 2.5 pound roast, on sale because it was approaching it's sell by date of 6/13 on 6/11. S, I didn't have much invested in this 'experimental' method of preparing an Eye of Round Roast. Well, I followed the directions but added about 5 additional minutes to the cooking time; because someone (who shall remain nameless) opened the oven just to take a peek. The roast was delicious but a bit too rare for my tastes, so I put it back in for another 20 minutes at 350 and it was perfect! It was juicy and flavorful and I only seasoned it with salt, pepper & garlic salt. I don't think my oven gets as hot as it should, nor does it retain heat like a newer oven. Anyway, it was tender and a hit with everyone, including the peeper ;-). He said it tastes like prime rib.

This is the best roast I ever made. I added extra ingredients for the taste; garlic, spices, and lemon, which is perfect. I love the look of it and it tastes SO good! Strongly recommended! Definitely making more in the future.

Used a 4.6 lb room temperature eye of round.  Bound with string and spiced. Cooked on a broiling pan fat side up with about 1/2 c of water and a full onion cut into rings in bottom pan. Old electric Frigidaire stove. 
1. Preheated oven at 500 degrees. Waited 20 minutes, then turned down to 475.  
2. Cooked 7 min/lb for 32 minutes. 
3. Turned off oven; did not open door. 
4. At 1.5 hours roast temperature was 120 (probably rare). Oven was cold, and wasn't sure if an additional hour sitting would cook to the desired temperature.
5. Preheated oven to 180 and cooked for another hour. 
6. Let sit for at least 20 minutes.

Meat was moist, very juicy and pink.  Would definitely use this recipe again.

Followed this recipe exactly as written. Unfortunately the meat was very tough.  It was medium rare and very juicy but just didn't make the tender.

Very similar to the method I use for standing rib. I had a smaller roast so adjusted timing but no changes (okay, I added garlic powder) - turned out great as I expected. I think some of the negatives about the cut being tough may be over-cooking (eye round must be rare) or carving issues.

What they will say is true. The roast came out just as I like it .  Beautifully medium rare. I will definitely cook it this way again .

Super, super easy.  Was not pink like shown.  I have a 6.5 lb roast and I cooked it for 49 min before turning it off.  I was afraid it wouldn't be done but I believe I actually overlooked it.  Tasted good, though.

I started out making this exactly as described but added garlic powder as a seasoning. During the cooking time, my kitchen did start to fill with smoke and I needed to turn on the fan.  When I opened the oven after 2 1/2 hours, I was shocked that the oven temp was not hot at all. My insta-read  thermometer showed an internal temp of 148 degrees and I became concerned that the roast was not cooked enough. So, I roasted it for 15 minutes more at 350 degrees.  That additional time was not needed,  as my roast ended up being on the med-well side of medium.  But, that being said, it was tender and absolutely delicious. The pan juices were dark and thick and delish.  My husband really loved it too. Will make again without the additional time.

GREAT FOR ROAST BEEF AND GRAVY SANDWICHES!!
This recipe is great to make Roast Beef and Gravy sandwiches for a crowd.  I buy a big 7lb whole eye of round from Costco.  Make the roast beef as per directions...except for 7lb i don't heat it at 475 as long as I should.    After, I let it cool and slice into thin slices and add gravy... any packets of brown gravy will do.  I use a few for a 7lb roast.   I add the drippings to the gravy and then layer it in my crockpot and warm it up on high.  Don't worry if your meat is pink as the gravy will continue to cook the meat.   It is a huge hit every time I make it for a crowd.  Serve with nice crusty buns, mustard and horseradish.

Made a two pound eye of round and changed my timing to 14 minutes at 475 and then turned the oven off and let cook another 24 minutes - perfectly medium rare!  Loved the ease of this recipe for roasting smaller cuts of beef.  We have plenty of leftovers for piled high French Dips with au jus from the drippings - can't wait!

Paired with "best steak marinade in existence" and it turned out great. GAS oven user so throw a temp prob in the meat and just make sure you have a slow steady rise in temp.  I put it on 200 degrees  here and there just to maintain a warm oven. Wife was pleased and it wasn't tough with the marinade.

Made a rub with salt, pepper, oregano, Rosemary, and thyme. Brushed with olive oil and applied the rub.  Came out medium -medium rare with time per pound. I let the roast sit out with the rub while the oven preheated(maybe 20minutes). Remember to cut across the grain when slicing.

I grew up on this roast cooked this way and I love it the one thing that you should say in the article is that it doesn't matter how much the roast weighs over the three pound example that you give because it's just going to be longer and longer they're all about the same or maybe they fluctuate a little I would not tell people to cook it at 7 minutes per pound exclusively I would say the maximum time that this roast should be cooked would be perhaps 35 minutes before you turn the oven off

Best roast I ever made! My oven must hold heat well because it was a little over done. Next time i will turn the oven off sooner to get a little more pink center. I will never cook an eye roast  any differently. Thanks for the easy and super tasty recipe!

I made it as directed. I cut the roast very thin. It was actually tender. It is a tough piece of meat, but cooked this way it is good.  I plan on using it in Teriyaki stir fry, philli cheese steak sandwiches, and in beef Manhattans this week.  It will work perfectly.

I was very skeptical as I'm not much of a cook and was very worried that this wouldn't taste so great.  OH MY GOODNESS!!!  This was incredible!  I did add some garlic powder, as one reviewer recommended, as we love garlic.  My husband likes his meat pink/rare so he was in heaven as I can never get it right for him.  Did I mention I don't cook?  The only thing was that at the end of the 2.5 hours it was only slightly warm.  That's probably our oven - new one to be installed shortly.  I highly recommend this recipe!  This is definitely a keeper and when family comes to visit I'll have to make this for them and wow them!  Thank you for this delicious recipe!

I did this exactly as described. The only difference was using a convection oven.
It was rare and cold when I pulled it out after 2 1/2 hours. I sliced off what we were going to eat and heated it up on a skillet.
The rest of the roast is going in a crock pot tomorrow....

I have made this at least 10 times.  Whenever I see Eye Round on sale, I scoop up a couple of roasts and put in the freezer.  I have a deli slicer at home, so will slice up for sandwiches for lunch.  It is foolproof.  I do use a digital thermometer, when it hits 145 degrees, I pull out of the oven.  Perfection.

If you love deli roast beef this the way to do it  yourself for half the price. The secret to this cheaper cut of meat is to cut really thin or shave it. I like to season and refrigerate over night and then follow cooking directions. We use this for sandwichs  so much cheaper and tastes alot better.

I made this according to the recipe, along with cabbage and potato salad for a big  Sunday style dinner. Came out great!!! I cook the roast beef this way when I want sandwiches later. The perfect recipe, comes out perfect every time. I've been making it this way ever since I came upon the recipe.

First attempt at this recipe and it was AWESOME. I followed reviewer"PJL4865" steps and wow, can I get WOW. I basted with "Gravy Master" seasoned with kosher salt and ground pepper and herb de provence. oh, and brought the roast to room temp before cooking.(goes without saying for any large piece
beef). paired it with some mashed potatoes and fried corn, and a glass or few of quality red wine.

This is the only way to cook an eye round roast. I live alone and found this teeny roast (1 1/2 lb.) but the dilemma was how to cook it since after 40 years of cooking I'd ruined many a roast. I heated the oven to 500, seasoned it with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Lowered the heat to 475 and baked it for 10 min., then turned the heat off. Set for 1:30. It was perfect and even had some drippings for a little gravy. Delish!

I've made my eye round roast this way several times and it always comes out perfect. The only thing I do different is to turn my oven down to 170 degrees instead of shutting it off completely.

Turned out perfectly.  I would recommend making a day in advance since it's even better the next day.  I made a quick au jus using the drippings, water, and some beef broth.  Poured it over the sliced beef to keep it moist which kept it delicious even after warming up the leftovers.

My organic top round beef roast came out wonderfully tender and nice and rare as we like it.  Very juicy.  Definite do-over !
 I  used my meat thermometer so I could remove it form the oven to be rare.

This was delicious. My roast was just one and a half pounds, so I cooked it at 475 for 13 minutes, turned off the oven, and left it sitting in the oven for an hour. After taking it out of the oven, I let it sit on the counter for about 10-15 minutes, but when I sliced it, a lot of the juices ran out. When I make it again I will let it rest for at least 30 mins to keep more of the juices in. I definitely will make this again.

They only way to cook eye of round or prime rib roasts. If someone doesn't like it rare just take their slice and put it in a hot skillet with a little au jus until it's the way they want it. That's what restaurants do.

Awesome recipe and method. I followed the instructions exactly. Then had to leave the house, so I left the  meat in the oven, uncovered for about 4 hours more. When I got home, I covered it in foil, leaving it in its juices in the oven. We ate it about 4 hours later ( a total of 11 hours after it first went into the oven) and it was tender and delicious. Most surprising was that it was pink all the way through never cooking more than necessary. It was perfect! Thank you for this great recipe!

It was not at all done.  I thought I had done something wrong and double checked the instructions but I had followed it exactly.  We ended having pizza for dinner.  Cooked this the rest of the way and stored it for the next night.

Cooking now...I know it will be delicious.  I put 15 fresh garlic cloves directly into the roast....just stab with a knife and insert the cloves. After 475 degree cook, dropped to 200 degrees for 20 minutes per pound.  When done, let it rest in the refrigerator or freezer to firm up and accommodate slicing very thin. (I use electric slicer) Heat up some aus jus gravy with sliced green peppers ....place thin sliced  roast in preheated gravy....enjoy

Came out raw and cold. I see now others' comments about this with a gas oven. Next year I will try again, instead reducing heat to see if I can emulate the process manually. Upon discovery, we finished cooking ours at 350° until the juices ran clear and a slice looked done. Mine was dry reheated the next day, albeit very well flavored, and my husband says cold slices are juicy.

Amazing!! This was my first time making an eye of round roast. I was worried how this would turn out at first but it turned out delicious!! Seasoned with just Adobo. I was worried the roast would be to rare, so I kept mine at 200, when it tells you to shut it off. This gave me a nice pink inside, which worked well as some people in my household to not like rare. Everyone in my family raved about it, so now have a new recipe added to my list.

sorry to disagree with all of the positive reviews but this was terrible. I followed this exactly. It was done to the perfect temperature, that is the only nice thing I can say about this,  but it was so tough. It was the worst meal I have ever made. I usually do a tough cut of meat like this either in the crock pot or braise it and it always melts in your mouth.

I was skeptical because of the bad reviews, but encouraged to give it a try with all of the good reviews.  I weighed my roast!  I also wrapped the roast in kitchen twine and rubbed with a paste of oil, thyme, salt, pepper and 1 glove of crushed garlic.  I let this sit for an hour at room temp.  I preheated oven to 500 for about 20 minutes, turned it down to 475, then did 7 minutes per pound, then turned it off and did the 20 minutes per pound..  I mostly followed what PJL 4965 wrote (thank you!).  She also mentions to turn the meat upside down to roast as there is a slight layer of fat on the bottom of this roast and it absorbs into the meat instead of melting out in your pan.   When all was done, it was fabulous.  Tender, juicy, flavorful.  I was worried that it was looking too well done, but I resisted the temptation to open the oven.  I let it rest 15 minutes with Al foil lightly placed on top to hold in the heat.  I was really worried!  But when I cut into it, it was perfect.  We like our meat with a light red to red interior.  I'm a fan.

This came out perfect.  I cooked a 4 pound roast and adjusted the times accordingly.  It was pink, tender and juicy.
A few tips: 
Turn on an overhead fan, the oven may smoke when pre-heating.
Add sliced onions to the pan, they will caramelize and flavor  the au jus.
Cook the roast fat side up so the juices melt into the meat.
Toss quartered red potatoes in olive oil and your favorite spices (salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, rosemary, etc.).  Lay flat on a cookie sheet on the rack one level below the roast. The potatoes will be ready when your roast is.

This cooking method was an epic fail, at least from my oven. The meat came out tough and chewy. I've had far better luck with high temp then a low temp for 20 minutes per pound

This was delicous and it did cook perfectly in our gas oven.  I did turn it to 500 and preheat for 20 minutes as another reviewer suggested to make sure that my oven walls were hot.  Then I left the oven at 500 during cooking since my roast was 3.4 lbs for 21 minutes.  We did not open the doors for 3 hours.  Easy and family loved it!

My second shot with this recipe was significantly better than the first. PJL4965 provided the best tips - preheat the oven for 20 mins and specified the length of time for each step (high heat/no heat). I started the entire process for a 2.5lb roast at 1:00, and just left the roast in the oven until 5:30. It was warm, and tender when sliced thinly. For a challenging cut of meat, this is an easy way to make it taste delish!

Followed the recipe and it came out fabulous. The most tender eye of the round I have ever made. The only change I made was that I seared it the night before.

I really like this method. I heated my oven up to 550  and as suggest by others I let it stay at that temp for a 20 minutes or so. I then put my tied up eye roast in and turn the temp down to 475. I cooked at that temp for about 25 minutes and turned off the oven. After sitting in the oven for the a little over an hour or so, I checked the internal temp it was only about 140-145 so I turned on the oven for half an hour. Let the roast rest for about half an hour tented. The meat was pinker than I would like it but it tasted very good. Next time I will cook it about 9 minutes a pound as I like it just under medium.

I put garlic powder and onion powder on it also. It was a 2.5 lb eye round roast, cooked it for 17 minutes, then let it sit in the oven for 2 1/2 hours before serving. OH MY GOODNESS! So delicious!!!!! I will always cook it this way from now on.

When I took it out it was 100 degree internal temp. Not cooked. So I turned on oven and cooked longer. Wondering if it's my oven? Oh well. Kind of disappointed.

I tried this and read reviews for turning oven down to 190  degrees for gas ovens for 30 mins after the 7 min per pound at 475 degrees  prior to turning oven off for 2 hours.  Meat still very tough and chewy.  No one in my family liked it. Sounds like it's an amazing recipe for electric ovens.  Perhaps someone  can share a better conversion recipe for gas ovens.

I have to say, I was quite skeptical about this recipe before I tried it. However, I am happy to report that this is fantastic! Mine came out a bit more medium than medium rare (as I was aiming for), but I'm also cooking at high altitude so I will scale back the initial cooking time at 475 degrees the next time around.

Roast was perfectly done, juicy, brown on the outside and pink in the middle, but internal temp was no where near 145°.  Much lower. I seasoned with salt, pepper & paprika.

The roast cooked perfectly. Next time, I would add more seasonings. I plan on making a really large portion of this for a party (15 pounds). Does that mean I need to cook the roasts in oven for at the lowered temp for 1hour, 45 minutes and then turn off the oven?

Tried this last night.  Had a 4.25lb roast.  Came out fantastic except I would do 6 mins a pound.    Mine came out about medium vs medium rare.  By the way, the pan drippings were fantastic for an au jus.  No one complained so it was a hit.

It's a nice technique , but it took me three attempts to perfect it. Each range hold heat differently so I cut the oven time by 15 mins . I rested the roast on a few carrots and celery stalks and a half of onion this gave the gravy a boost in flavor and it elevated the roast for even browning. On the third attempt it came out perfect. The first two roast were good but a little closer to medium for my taste and recipes that I used it for after the initial  dinner. It worked well in a Philly style cheese steak recipe and a French dip on a kaiser roll.

Perfect!!! My two children and husband all ate it and enjoyed.  I followed the tips one reviewer and covered roast in Gravy Master, garlic powder, salt & pepper.  I preheated oven to 500 and put roast in 7 min. per lb., then shut off oven without opening and let cook another 20 mins. per lb.  Nice crust on the outside and super juicy inside :)

This recipe is a failure for me.  The roast spit juice all over my oven, and the oil burned.  My house filled with smoke.   I won't be trying the recipe again.

Made the recipe as directed but instead of shutting oven off after 21 minutes, I set to 170 for 2 1/2 hours, then shut it off and left it in for another hour.  It was done medium throughout and the flavour was excellent.  However; still very tough.  Slicing it super thin made it o.k. but will try a different recipe next time.

Worked perfectly. I used Santa Maria steak seasoning and had a two pound roast it came out great.  Just be sure to trim off all the fat on the outside of the roast it's not needed.

Very very very disappointed in this recipe.  Cooked it like it stated and my husband and I felt like we were eating leather.  It took forever to chew.  Ended it up using the left over for stroganoff after simmering it in beef broth.  Then it was tender and fell apart. Never using this recipe again.

The only way to do an eye of round roast.  Comes out perfectly each time. The key to tender slices, is to have a very sharp carving knife and slice as thinly as possible into rounds.  Don't  slice it with the grain or it will be tough.  Great as leftovers, especially if you have a meat slicer.

I've been making Eye Round roasts all the 41 years I've been married. This past Sunday I came across this high-temp recipe and decided to give it a try. WOW! The raves were ongoing ... And I too have to admit it was PERFECT!
If you like medium rare beef  these are the perfect instructions with this recipe.  You won't be sorry.

My roast was only two pounds so I did this, and it came out delicious: I roasted it at 500 degrees for 14 minutes (7 minutes per pound), turned the oven off, and left it in there for another 40 minutes (20 min per pound as recommended by one reviewer). Then I let it rest outside of the oven for 20 minutes or so. I surrounded it with whole red potatoes tossed in olive oil, salt and oregono, and I gave the potatoes a 10 minute head start in the very hot oven.

Pre- heated oven for 20 min at 500 degrees.  Cooked fat side up for 5 minutes per lbs and turned off heat.  When internal temp reached 123 degrees we sliced the most tender piece of roast beef you have ever tasted.  So fool proof it was embarrassing.  Don't open the door till your timer beeps at the desired temp.  We used a 6 lbs bottom round roast.  I will try a cheaper cut next time as many suggested.

This is a great way to cook a tough piece of meat. I use a pan or bowl to cover the burner of my stove which vents the oven heat and cook it a few less minutes at 500... Seems to work great at about 3-4 minutes a pound.

Best roast beef ever. Tender and perfect. I'm not sure about the bad reviews. Maybe poor quality of meat. Slice it thin for sandwitches. Way cheaper than buying sliced roast beef. I will make this over and over again. Wow

The only way to make this meat in the oven in my opinion. I make this all the time. It always comes out tender and juicy. I sometimes stuff it with onions and red peppers.

I have done this recipe many times at first my problem was that the oven seemed to lose its heat fast, I am guessing because its gas, and there is no "element" that stays hot anyway after some modifications, I find its best to have it sit out for an hour or so, basically so its not so cold when you put it in the oven, as it takes "work" to bring the meat to temperature. I also found its best not to  have anything else in the oven too, I also have the temperature set to 200 degrees My oven is fairly new,   but great recipie, !!

This recipe takes a cheap cut of meat and makes it into a pretty spectacular dinner! My oven doesn't hold heat too well, so I have to intermittently switch between turning the heat off and turning it on to low a few times, but the meat comes out medium rare pretty much every time. Thanks!

delicious but it cooked much faster than planned.  I removed the roast after 1.5 hours and it was medium well, we would have liked it closer to medium.

We rub ours with beef base, McCormick brand is what we usually have, and make sure to roast it with the fat side up.  We let it cool for a bit and then thin slice it (think sandwich meat thin) and eat it for a few days!  Love it!  I wouldn't thick slice or chunk it up, it would be too tough I think.

One suggestion:if the roast isn't already tied, use butcher's twine and tie it at 2 1/2 to 3 inch intervals. This will give the roast a more even profile, and a more even result.

Amazing how this really works!!! I forgot to turn down the temp so the 3.45 lb. roast was in the oven for 23 minutes at 500. Let it sit in the off oven for 90 minutes. It turned out more of a medium/medium well but was still tasty and juicy.

I was so looking forward to my 2.7 lb roast. However when I opened the oven door after 2.5 hours, the pan was cool to touch and the meat thermometer wouldn't register a reading. Although it was nicely browned on the outside the inside was raw.  My gas oven is only a few years old and has never given me problems.

It comes out just like on the picture! Mine was done well. The onlything is that after 2,5 h in the oven it came out to be warm so it lost some flavor...

I wish I would have spent more time reading the reviews, because my gas oven was ice cold and my roast was basically raw. I sliced it up, poured melted butter over it and threw it back in to heat it up again. Disappointing, since my whole meal was ready but my roast wasn't.

DON'T BE AFRAID!!
A FUN Experiment that worked out very well
This recipe proved to be a very tasty & worry-free way to cook a roast.
I bought an eye round piece--2.92 lbs exactly.
I preheated my electric, small, self-cleaning wall oven to 500 degrees.  While waiting for the oven to heat up, I rubbed the roast in EVOO.
Then I poked it in several places, with a steak knife, to make pockets, pushing  sliced garlic into those pockets. I sprinkled the entire piece w/ a generous amt of McCormicks Hamburger Seasoning (the 1 in the plastic shaker), sea salt,  table pepper, & garlic powder.
Then I put the meat into a square, ceramic roasting pan, made by Portmeirion--fatty side up. (Make sure the pan is placed in the exact middle of ur oven.)
I turned down the temp to 475. I cooked it for 22 minutes. Then I turned the oven off & locked it. I intended to leave it in the hot oven, in the off position, for the called-for additional 2 1/2 hours, but decided to open the oven at the 2-hour mark--30 min early. I was glad I did--it was 9pm on a week nite--my family of 4 men were starving, so I was dying to see if it was ready before the expected 2 1/2 hour wait.
The meat thermom registered 145.
We used an electric knife to cut it into 1/2" slices.
The meat was salty & crispy on the outside, beige (done) on the outer circle, & a nice circle of light pink in the center & throughout. 
And OMG, the aroma while it was roasting! A friend stopped in, & said "Oh Man, it smells delicious in here."

Great recipe! I had already marinated mine in balsamic vinegar and garlic and onion powder. I poured out the marinade and rubbed salt and pepper in per recipe. It tasted like a fancy carving station prime rib without the fat. It was great and will make wonderful sandwiches with leftovers.

This is now ABSOLUTELY the only way I cook a roast of beef. So simple, and turns out so well. Incredibly moist and delicious on the inside, and a very tasty thin browned layer on the outside. Five stars for sure!

This is THE only way to cook an eye round and so easy especially if expecting guests you can time it perfectly.  Even though the meat is red and very rare, it is definitely cooked and has such a juicy tender consistency.  Its been a hit time after time!

Cooked almost like they recommended  500 heat oven for 21 mins for 3 pound roast.  Then to 450 for 40 mins and was worried would be too rare  Put to 475 for last 20 mins.  Came out medium, no pink but was juicy.  VERY disappointed.  next time will put oven to 425 for the 20 mins per pound next time.  put on espresso coffee rub and it tasted great!

I have a gas oven and it took some watching over @ 170F off and on.  I used a remote thermometer and I'd turn the oven on and off according to the temperature.  But it turned out wonderful.  My boyfriend is still raving about the leftovers.  I'm so happy!!  I think SBelle probably overcooked her roast.

I love this method!! I generally use the McCormick Steak seasoning and it comes out fantastic, even though some of the spices get a little over done. I have to let mine cook a little longer before I turn my oven off because it does not seem to hold the heat well enough to cook it through enough for my family's taste.

Love the recipe. Stab holes in the roast and stuff in Garlic pieces. The house smells like garlic and it cooks down nicely and is very edible part of the roast.

Also, you can make a Roux with flour and the drippings and combine that with Campbell's Beef Consomme and water to make a very nice Au Jus.

After following the directions, meat was at 110 degrees. Not even close to being done. I have a gas stove, and perhaps that's the problem, as some others have reported. I'm trying to salvage dinner, but I guess we are not eating dinner any time soon.

This is absolutely the best!  We like ours medium-rare, so I left the heat on for 30 minutes instead of 21, and it was perfect.  A few minutes before taking it out of the oven, I prepared a horseradish/cream sauce to pour over it after I sliced it.  It's so easy, and it gives you plenty of time to prepare your side dishes.

I don't know if it didn't work for me because my house is cold so the oven temp didn't stay hot after it was shut off or what but this isn't for me.  I'm glad it worked so well for others.

I followed the recipe to a T however my roast was slightly over-cooked and came out medium-medium well. The flavor was excellent and my husband did enjoy it, but I couldn't quite figure out why it was so over-cooked. I have a convection oven that does hold it's heat rather well but even though by the end of the time in the oven my oven was cold the roast was still more cooked inside than anticipated. I did doctor the marinade a little bit by brushing on my favorite Dijon mustard and gravy master marinade with a little bit of garlic powder and salt and pepper which gave the crust a lovely flavor, not sure if that affected the outcome at all but I doubt it. Next time I will cook it a little less at the 475 and hopefully it will be less overcooked. Thanks for a great start on a new recipe!

Delicious and SO easy.  Followed directions and resisted the urge to open the oven.  Smelled so good, and the family devoured it.  Will make this again and again!

It was not as tender as I expected, but the flavor was there. I'll tinker with this recipe a bit, to see what I can do to tenderize the Beef.

I have done this roast twice now and both times it turned out perfect. I had a 7 lb. roast and cooked it the 7 min. per lb and then followed the rest of the recipe. I had plenty of liquid for gravy, just added some beef broth and it was delicious.

This is the only way to cook an eye round roast in my opinion.  I don't eat much beef but my family loves it.  I made fried apples and roasted potatoes to go with it along with au jus. Delicious!

Extremely disappointed. Followed recipe to a T and it was tough. If anyone has eaten good cuts of meat this is not the recipe for you. I'm sorry but this is the first recipe I have given a negative review in over 12 years of using this site.

I had a 4 lb eye of the round with NO fat on it.  So beyond that fact, I also have a gas oven which, while not that old, is probably not that great in quality.  So I took the cook at 200 route for 20 min/lb out of pure fear.  Since every variation called for not opening the oven at all during that no heat/low heat period, I put a sign on the oven stating "DO NOT OPEN".  My younger brother apparently can't read well and opened it for about 2 seconds.  The roast turned out great (considering there was no fat).  But I guess I'll have to re-do this again to see if that minor change in heat made a difference or not :)
Agree on on super thin slicing and the need for some sort of side dipping sauce.

I made this for our Christmas dinner. It was fabulous and I will definitely make it again. The family loved it. Before putting it in the oven I coated it with olive oil, and used salt, coarsely ground pepper, and garlic powder to season it.

This was excellent!  The internal temperature of the meat at the end of the 2 1/2 hours was only 128 degrees (rather than the expected 145) but the meat was cooked perfectly.  I don't know if the roast cooled to a lower temp than stated, or maybe it's our meat thermometer.  We were surprised it was so good!  The meat was very tender!

Excellent and super easy.   ETA:  after reading reviews on this recipe I am compelled to edit mine to include the detail that I have a 1950's Wedgewood stove (gas oven) and this recipe comes out perfectly every time.   I've also made this recipe in an electric oven.   In my experience there has been no difference in the result between electric or gas.

I tried this for the 1st time today.  I usually cook mine in a slow cooker and it always comes out so juicy and literally falls apart but I wanted a nice roast that I cold slice and have for dinner and then use left overs for sandwiches... I have a fairly new gas stove (1 1/2 years old) and this did not hold the temperature.  I followed it exactly and after 1 hour was skeptical.  I usually can feel how hot the oven is when I touch the outside and this felt cold.  I am glad I did because it was not even cooking.  Disappointed as it had a lot of great reviews but obviously my stove does not hold the heat like others do.

I just bought an eye round 2lb and said all right let's cook this baby up. I coated the outside with various spices and followed the cooking advice. It was once of the best meats I cooked. The meat came out perfect medium rare. I have a fillet knife and sliced it real thin. I made a horseradish sauce and man I was stoked. My son and I ate it watching baseball martinis in hand.

I used a 2.9 pound top round cut instead of an eye round. i pulled the roast out of the oven at 130 degrees - medium rare  - and it was delicious. I use a Thermapen to test the temperature and do not depend on a timer.  My only surprise was the roast which went into the oven at 40 degrees was cooked to 130 degrees within the 21 minutes on 500 and then only 40 more minutes in the oven with the temp turned off.  I was not ready with the rest of the meal as I thought I had two hours to wait.  But we worked fast and made it all work. Maybe my oven held the high temperature more than others??

The meat was raw because I have an older oven that did not retain heat.  Will try this again turning oven down low instead of off.  It was juicy but I am now awaiting a very late dinner as I have to cook meat and other dishes are getting cold.

I never thought my roast would be good using this recipe but it was fantastic! I followed the directions to calculate cooking times using a 5 lb roast and it was done perfectly. The center was a dark pink and it was very tender. I have used this recipe 8 or 9 times now and never had a bad meal. I will not cook a roast any other way. Thanks so much for the terrific recipe!

OK, this is what happens when one screws up on a simple recipe!  I misjudged the weight of the meat and cooked it up front for a lesser amount of time (I guessed it at 2 lbs, husband says it was 7 pounds).  I followed the recipe to a "T".  Guess what, it still turned out wonderful!  I just sliced it extra thin in case it would be tough.  It was tender and succulent.  This recipe is a keeper!!  Not many recipes will tolerate someone to screw up and allow the outcome to still be perfect.

Ok so I will start with the good part...first of all the flavor of the meat was fantastic.  I seasoned it with garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper.  It was still a pretty tough piece of meat (however if you cut it SUPER thin, it didn't bother you).  The problem was getting a knife to cut it that thin I suppose.  My 4.5 year old picky daughter ate all hers so that's good!  I think next time I will just stick with chuck or rump roast. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I used slightly smaller piece of meat, but this recipe cooks rare, if you want med well, cook longer. (someone else did 28 min.)

I used this recipe as my dear hubby had an accident with the crock pot. This recipe is a winner. I didn't believe it would turn out with the results that everyone was raving about. They're right. It was tasty, done to about medium (pink inside) and tender. After standing it sliced as thin as if I'd used a deli slicer. I'll be using this recipe again.

I had never heard of cooking a roast this way and was a little skeptical before I read all the reviews.  However, I wanted to try something different so I wouldn't end up with a tough, dry roast.   I am so glad I tried this.  My roast was done just the way I like it, and the thin slices melted in our mouths.  Now I can turn an inexpensive cut of beef into a tender roast.  Thanks, Lyn!

This is a great and easy method for cooking this cut of meat.  I recommend you use a thermometer and we prefer a medium rare temp.  My thermometer has a medium rare for chef at 135 and I will use next time as this was a little too done. This is a great recipe to cook ahead of time and cut very thin for a more informal gathering and it can be used for sandwiches.

Prepared the beef on the gas barbecue... Since the grill unit is considerably less insulated than a common oven, some cooking adjustments were needed. Following the high heat blast, the gas was turned to its lowest setting for 60m minutes, then shutoff completely thereafter. This recipe is a real keeper; however, no method of preparation can transform eye of round into prime rib! — Skip.

the roast did come out perfect med which is perfect for my family, but, the cut of meat was tough, beyond tough, and barely warm....i used 2nd half a couple days later and sliced as thin as possible and did make a good panini with it. next time will use better cut of meat, the idea is good but u only get out what u put in, so use a better roast or even beef tenderloin which is probably what i will use next time, if i do make this again

I am impressed, the cut of meat I had was looking like it would be the toughest I'd ever tried to cook. I was sceptical about the recipe, but it turned out superb. Cutting it against the grain is also key, this will make great leftovers for sandwiches too.  Before browning, I made little slits in the meat and stuffed sliced garlic in them. Extra yummy.

I tried this for the first time today. I should have read the reviews before though. I heard about it at the hairdressors and was very excited. I followed all the stpes for a 3 pound Eye-of-the-Round Roast. It smelled wonderful in the early stages, but lost any aroma as the time passed. When the 3 hours were up I took my roast out. All of my sides were ready to go, unfortunatly my roast was only at 100 degrees F. I couldn't figure out what I had done wrong, then realized I have a gas oven, which does not hold the heat!!! We sliced it very thin, and had dinner, it was very tasty and every one enjoyed it! I think after reading other reviews the next time I will either add a little low hear for the last 45 minutes or so. But will defiantly do thins again. I like the ease of it and the fact that I am saving energy!

This recipe gets 5 stars, not so much for flavor (because it is very simple), but because it is cooked PERFECT every time. I have overcooked roast beef so many times but never worry about it with this method. Also, I can put it in the oven while the kids are eating snack after school and it's ready at dinner with no fuss. LOVE THIS METHOD OF COOKING BEEF. Thanks so much!

I tried this recipe yesterday for a Sunday dinner.  I followed the recipe to the minute, and although it was very tasty, I did find it a little chewy and slightly tough!  My roast was 4lbs. and I did it at 475degrees for 28 minutes and then 2 1/2 hours with the oven off. It looks pretty much like your photo, but it was a little tough. I don't have a slicer, so my slices were as thin as I could get them with my carving knife.  Any ideas or suggestions??  What can I do with the leftovers? If I re-heat it'll only toughen the meat more, yet there is too much left to simply throw away.
Please help!!!!

Roast turned out tender, flavourful and perfectly pink; it was cooked exactly to our liking. As others have suggested, I'm going to use this method on other roasts. Cannot wait!!! Thank you so very much, Lyn B.

This turned out fantastic.  I had a 2.8 pound roast and trimmed off 4 minutes at 475 degrees. It was tender and pink.

Was very tender and juicy. I cooked mine at 9 mins a pound at 475. My family doesn't like it very red.

I was skeptical of this recipe and how it would actually cook  but it was perfect!
I added smoked paprika as the seasoning. No complaints form my family when I served this!  
I will be making roasts this way from now on.

I have used this a number of times for game roasts -- both Caribou and Moose and have been extremely please with how it it works with those meats.   I have made Moose roasts in many other way, but will only use this from now on.

I made this tonight and was worried about it not being done. I used a 2 pound eye of round. I seasoned it with several different seasonings like I do for my steaks. I followed the cooking times other reviewers had posted since my roast was smaller. It was the BEST roast that I have ever made! This recipe is a keeper and I am sharing it with friends and family!

This roast was perfect, I made it for ccompany and there was none left by the end of dinner. I love working with spices so I used seasoned salt, an all in onespice, and garlic powder. I also rubbed a little of canola oil on it. Remember to modify the time based on size. My roast was slightly smaller so I kept it in the oven for 2 hours. I added the pan drippings to a brown gravy mix and it tasted authentic, not like a mix was used. Enjoy!!

This cooking method was amazing! But I did need to add some cooking time at the end to make it medium well done.  But this receipe must be made with some kind of gravy or horseradish sauce as it alone is a bit bland.

Very easy and delicious.  My mother-in-law was suspect of the cooking time and the limited seasoning, but she gave it an enthusiastic thumbs up.  Will definitely be adding this to the recipe box for use again.

This was a good recipe for a tough cut of meat but I was not WOWED by it. Don't get me wrong the roast turned out good but I think with some alterations it could move up the ranks. I will defiantly try again with some modifications.

I usually create a flavorable rub adding garlic, minced onion, red pepper and a few other spices to the salt and pepper.  Delicious every time.

Love it, I've only used an eye round roast once, which did come out very delicious. Thought it would be way too salty, thought it would dry it out, and it is the opposite in both aspects, a surprise and great learning opportunity. I have used it 2 times in a row for the big Family Christmas gathering and it is amazing, instead I used a standing rib roast. I have the butcher cut the ribs off, but have him tie them to the roast and it is just incredible, problem is, we ALL want a rib, and there is never enough! Thanks for submitting this recipe.

This was amazing. I used browning, salt, pepper and garlic powder. DO NOT OPEN THE OVEN!! My husband was scared the meat was going to be cold after letting it rest (double foiled) but the came out warm, tender and juicy. We were all pleasantly surprised. This is officialy my go to recipe for eye of round!!

The only reason I gave this 3 stars is because the roast tasted great after I turned the oven back on after an hour to continue cooking it. I touched the outside of my oven one hour after starting and it was just a little warm. Opened it up and it was not really warm inside. I guess this could just be my oven but it seems to work for everything else I use it for. I'm glad that I turned the oven back on when I did or we would of had a rare roast at dinner time.

Family loved it! I was a bit unsure and wanted to open the oven several times! But please don't!!! You need to follow cooking directions in order for this to be cooked properly. I did add pieces of garlic cloves to roast. I also bought an Angus organic roast. 
3-1/2# well served family of 4. Great energy saver too!

I did not care for this recipe. I have been making beef roast for 20 plus years and it is my favorite meal, but this created a MESS in my oven probably take us and hour or two to clean, and was overcooked.  The flavor was ok, but burnt.

I purchased an eye of round planning to cook it as a pot roast, and then I found this recipe. I follow a similar recipe for a standing rib roast and have used it on a prime rib roast... creating the best roast I've ever had. BUT, my eye of round roasted with this recipe disappointed. While the outside was seared and the inside was evenly pink, the meat is tough. I wasted what would have made a great pot roast.

We followed the recipe exactly and it was just okay.  The meat was more of a medium rare and was a little on the tough side.  Perhaps more seasonings would have made it more enjoyable.  I will probably avoid round roasts in the future.

I think I would try this method again with a different cut of meat.

I was really excited about trying this recipe BUT it was not successful for me.  I have a gas oven.  I followed the instructions using a 5.5 pound eye of the round and cooked it for 39 minutes at 475.  I then turned the oven off and let it sit for 2.5 hours.  When I opened the oven and inserted the meat thermometer, it only registered 120 degrees.
I managed to salvage dinner by reheating the oven to 500 and cooking the meat for another 40 minutes.  It was still somewhat juicy and tender.
  I'd like to try it again if I can get some suggestions on cooking it right the next time.

This is a wonderful way to fix a great meal with little hassle.  The only thing I changed was I made a rub of thyme, basil and garlic and rub it in with a light olive oil prior to placing in the oven.  It was amazing! Thanks.

WOW! Need I say more. I tried this last night while someone I am dating was coming over to meet some of my friends. Of course I wanted to impress every one, and I did. I did cook the 3.10 pound roast for 23 minutes, and like others said I was skeptical of it being undercooked. It came out like the photo, and the only thing that i can suggest is after cutting it to let the blood drain out. I felt that looked unappealing, but the meat was medium to medium-rare after it drained. I did prep it with olive oil, pepper, and sea salt. In addition, I cut slits in the meat and stuffed sliced of fresh garlic into them. Completed the menu with oven roast potatoes (canned) marinated in olive oil, sea salt and rosemary. (which i cooked in the toaster oven for about an hour, then boiled for a little after. What a great pairing. Serve with Merlot, it brings out the flavor!

Wish I could give this 4.5 stars, but it's not possible. 
The cooking method worked out pretty well as a base. It does seem like the roast might need to be marinated before cooking, but it wasn't terribly bland or anything. Also, the meat wasn't perfectly tender, but still fairly tender.
While the roast was cooked properly at the end, it may be somewhat cold. We weren't sure about reheating so we just piled on the hot gravy made from the drippings.

Tips: If you cut your own roast from a larger piece, figure out the weight by multiplying the weight of the original piece you bought (marked on package) by the fraction you are using. If you forget to do this, you can also try to use bags of frozen vegetables to try to estimate the weight.
It's also probably best to keep the big strip of fat on the top of the roast when cooking so that the fat can go into the meat when cooking.

AMAZING! I never new it was sooo easy to make a tasty, flavorful roast.  

When I bring my roasts home from the store I first douse them with Liquid Smoke,then rub it down with a mix of: salt, pepper, garlic powder, minced onion, and dried oregano before placing it in a freezer bag for storage.

The roast I had was only about 2 lbs. I am sure a larger one would work better. Mine was pink in the middle, but too hard on the outside edges. That may indicate the oven was just too hot for such a small piece of beef. I cannot say it was very tender, but it was edible, if you cut small bites.

I love this recipe.  I use steak seasoning to season overnight then I follow your cooking guide.  I love that I can put it in the oven and cook it for 7 minutes per pound, run and pick up my son 45 minutes away and come home and have dinner ready in minutes.  I've cooked it twice so far. Thank you, thank you!

This was perfect! I haven't cooked eye-of-round roast for quite some time because it has always been dry. Not this time. I just rubbed in some salt and garlic pepper and cooked exactly as the recipe stated.

Absolutely perfect directions!  I have always preferred pot roasts because I usually mess up oven roasts but never again with this formula.  The ONLY way I will roast in the future.

I am floored every time I make this roast. It comes out perfect each and every time. I still can't believe how easy, simple and no-fuss this recipe is. I make it exactly how the recipe outlines. I serve it with mashed potatoes, a veggie of your choice and horseradish on the side. A definite winner.

Pink in the middle, juicy and tender!  I wasn't disappointed.  Mine was a 2.78 lb roast.  I preheated the oven to 500, put the roast in, turned heat down to 475 (this was at 9:43AM) turned the oven off at 10:01AM) went to church, came back at 11:45.  Took the roast out, made gravy and mashed potatoes; we ate approx. 30 minutes later.  I'll be using this recipe again.   THANKS!!

As with most of the other reviews that gave less than 5 starts, mine after 2.5 hours was still raw in the middle. So, I took it out, sliced it up and its back in the oven, hopefully not tough.

Hm, it was a little closer to medium well at 7min/lb and then sitting in the oven for 2.5hrs, I will probably do 5min/lb and 2hrs of oven time next time.  otherwise its pretty good!

My husband & I was very uncertain about this  recipe.  I decided to give it a try.  The whole 2 1/2 hours I kept questioning this recipe.  When we took out the roast and my husband started slicing it we were overjoyed with the perfect color of the center of the roast.

For those of you who doubt this recipe, just go all in. I just had the most amazing beautiful, juicy, bright pink roast FROM A RUMP ROAST. I was so nervous about using a different cut of meat (and mine was smaller to boot) but it turned out wonderfully!! I went 500 pre-heat, 475 for 9 min (only 2 lbs roast), then 1 hour with the oven turned off. It was a deep pink, perfectly med-rare-rare, which my family loves. BRILLLIANT!

Very good, definitely do not go over the 7 min per pound rule.  Season the outside well (my particular version has heavy black pepper, garlic powder, olive oil and a bit of mesquite and salt).  Enjoy!

For those of us who cook at high-altitude.  Was skeptical about the high temp strategy as the temp is lower at altitude, but this is how it worked.  Cooked at 500 for 7 minutes per pound and at 200 for 20 minutes per pound.  I spread paste of garlic, red onion, herbs de provence, olive oil and salt & pepper all over and held at room temp for an hour before putting into the oven.  Sliced thinly and it was delicious!  Hardly any drippings, so used butter, flour, chicken stock and few Tbs condensed mushroom soup - about half a can.  Little worcestershire sauce too.  Yum!

This is absolutely amazing. It is forever in my recipe box. I, like others, had my doubts. I did however turn the oven on at the end for about 15 minutes to warm it at 350. I rubbed it with salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder. We ate it for the following week on sandwiches and salads. DELISH!!  My only question...can I do a rump roast of similar weight like this or any cut of meat for that matter??

The Best, simplest roast beef.  I prepare the beef and then give my 13year old instructions. He puts it in the oven and I have a wonderful meal to come home to.

I had my doubts, between the temp and asking hubby (typically limited to grilling) to cook this for us tonight.  The recipe is soooooo easy!  It turned out nicely, although it cooked a little longer than required, so it wasn't med rare like I prefer.  It was still juicy and tender.  Will defintely use this recipe again.

This had so many awesome reviews...so I went for it, BUT My oven did not seem to hold the heat...cause after 2.5 hours a temperature didnt even register on the meat thermometer...so at 8pm, I just put it on 350 and ate a really tough piece of meat an hour later:/ Now I have to figure out what to do with all the leftover tough meat...about two pounds of it.  Maybe alot of broth or gravy?...hmm.

When I first stumbled upon this recipe I was perplexed.  The thermodynamics at play here are amazing.  This turned out great and came out somewhere between medium rare and rare.  

I made a few changes - I used about 3 cloves of garlic, made slits into the meat and stuffed them into the roast.  I also tied the roast as it was a little malformed.  

An important suggestion - make sure you put the fatty side up so it melts into the meat.

Next time I think I will try this with montreal steak seasoning!

I have made this roast several times, followed all the directions exactly, and have had great results.  I usually serve mine with Horseradish Cream, some type of potato, and green beans.  It's a very nice dinner.  I've had one issue though, my roast usually turns out barely lukewarm.  It is adequately cooked just not warm enough.  I hesitate to turn the oven back on out of fear of drying out my roast.  I usually roast the meat uncovered in a square pyrex baking dish.  I'm wondering if a more insulted dish would help or if I covered it.  Curious if anyone has any suggestions about this because I LOVE this recipe.  Thanks.

After all the wonderful reviews, I was disappointed in the results.  I did not turn the oven off after the 21 minutes but left it at 200 degrees.  The roast measured 140 degrees after 2.5 hours & was extremely rare (bloody).  I cooked it longer to make it edible.

What a great way to cook an eye round. I took the advice about only leaving in oven for 1 hour and my roast came out pink in the center. Also, used a meat slicer and sliced it thin. Delish!!!!

Try this recipe!!!! Best roast I've ever made. Perfect medium rare tender, juicy. My family loved it. And it is soo easy. I had a 3 pound roast added garlic salt and a rub. Roast took about 1 hr 50 min. If you like your meat well done adjust time. Will defiantly make again and recommend to family and friends.

The only customization I made was adding garlic powder and using a salt substitute instead of real salt. This was really tender and moist. My husband loved it.

I tried the recipe following the instructions exactly, but my 3 lbs. eye of round roast turned out undercooked, with a meat temp. reading of 110 degrees (F), measured at the center of the roast. I used a gas oven. Is this recipe written for an electric oven? 
I'm curious to know.

Great recipe!  VERY easy to make, you can easily modify by adding whatever spices you like to the roast with the salt and pepper.  I added garlic powder.  When cooked I sliced it thin and served with crusty rolls.  This was a huge hit with my husband and my kids!

It's true! The easiest roast we ever made.  It was wonderful and tender.  We will definitely be making this one again.  We used dried onions flakes, two different types of spice mixes that include garlic and a small touch of liquid smoke.

I used a chuck roast - it came out awesome.  Only 4 stars because I would have liked a little more flavor than salt and pepper - next time I may cut slits in the meat and stuff in some garlic cloves, or sprinkle with garlic powder.  All in all very good - tender and moist.  I did 8 mins per pound at 500 because we like our meat a little more cooked than medium.

Delicious!!! I was a little unsure if the meat would be cooked enough by shutting off the oven & just leaving it in there so I turned it back on after a little while to 350 but it was great & even could have been cooked a little less so next time I will just leave the oven off as the recipe states! I also added some onion & garlic powder to it, next time I will either buy or make some gravy to go in it too!! Great recipe :-)

I followed this to a "T" and the roast came out perfectly. It was a consistent pink in the center with a nice crust on the edges.

This is an awesome and easy recipe.  I took the drippings and added  some beef broth and simmered it down to make au jus and it was delicious.  My husband raved about it.

I was just as nervous as everyone else about the whole "turn the oven off and let it sit" thing. Mostly because I just didn't trust my oven. So after about 2 hours with the oven off, I turned it back on at 300 for the last 30 minutes, then took it out and let it rest for 20 minutes under foil. It turned out absolutely perfect. Very pink, but not too rare for everyone. I will definitely use this method every time from now on. Awesome.

Awesome! Instead of using salt and pepper I used Emerils Steak Rub. Made this @ Thanksgiving and I have it in the oven right now as I type this review. The smell is fabulous. By far the best eye of round I have ever had! Thanks for sharing...btw, meat comes out melt in your mouth tender...mmm mmm

This roast was incredible. It's amazing how such a simple recipe can be so tasty. Like all my cuts off beef, I heavily salted it, and let it sit in the fridge for a few hours, so it would be flavorful on the inside.

I, like so many others, was very skeptical but this turned out perfectly! It was without a doubt the best roast beef I've ever made. My Mom made eye of the round all the time and I hate to say it but this was better than hers. I HATE my oven and worried that it wouldn't cook this properly but it was perfect. My family loved it. Thank you so much for this easy yummy recipe!

I am cooking the roast per the instructions as I write this. I am amazed at how the thermo is creeping up after I turned the heat off. I even put an old blanket over the oven to insulate the oven a bit and keep the heat in. I'm up to 104F after only 40 minutes. I'm keeping it in until the 2.5 hour mark if it kills me. (Mr. instant gratification here.)Thanks.

Don't do what I did :) I was worried the meat would come out cold, on the medium rare side and the hubby or kids would open the door. I preheated to 500, dropped to 475 then lowered to 250, when the thermometer read 155 I took it out and tented it.  BIG MISTAKE, it came out dry and tough which was completely my fault for 'over-thinking' this. Might have been ok at 180-200 but 250 was just too high. Next time I will cook per directions without concern! The only thing I did do right was to turn the exhaust fan on high, the ceiling fan on high and open the kitchen window, at 475 it got pretty smoky in the kitchen.

This recipe turned out perfectly and tasted great.  I wish I knew this technique 10 years ago.  There is no better (and easier) way to cook a delicious roast.

I will rate this a 3 only because it was easy. I followed the directions to a T. My roast came out very dry and overcooked. I will however try it again and alter the cooking time. My oven for some reason seems to always cook fast. I mean you would think that sounds silly, but it's true. I have a thermdor single wall oven. Anyone who has this problem, beware of the cooking time. I hope it works out better next time!!

Roast was flavorful but chewy. I followed the advice of other reviews to get a medium well roast but I think that was why the roast was so chewy. Next time I'll try it as is.

I followed recipe exactly and when I took the temp. after 2 1/2 hours it was really low, but when I cut into it is was medium well. It seems the meat just got cold the last 1/2 hour so I will just let it sit in the oven for 2 hours next time. The meat came out great though. Thank you for this recipe!

Like other reviewers I was skeptical when I read this recipe, however it really worked! Our roast came out med rare. I would have preferred it be a little more done, but it was very tender and juicy for such an inexpensive cut of meat. My husband even commented on how good it was and he is the biggest critic ever! So this is definitely a keeper!

I am recently retired and finally did a BUDGET.  After the shock wore off I encountered a good sale on eye of round.  This is a very inexpensive cut and I had visions of shoe leather dancing in my head. I followed this cooking method, sprinkiing some STEAK SPICE I had on hand instead of salt and pepper, and the result was excellent.  NO SHOES and very tasty.  Thanks for the tips I really need the savings!

This is the only way I'll fix an eye of round. Before baking, I rub with olive oil and pepper, and then make several small slits in the roast and insert slivers of garlic. It adds just a faint flavor that is wonderful!

This was my first time making a roast in the oven and it was perfect! I seasoned the roast to taste and cooked it on a bed of chopped potatoes and carrots tossed in olive oil and it was the best roast I ever had.  I have a smaller oven that doesn't have the best seal so I set the temperature to low instead of turning the oven off, as some other reviewers did, but I turned it off for the last half hour. I'll be using this method anytime I want a roast- thanks for posting!

I purchased a eye of round roast and was looking for a way to prepare it. I found this recipe and was impressed with both the ease of preparation and the number of 5 star reviews. I made it exactly as the recipe indicated and it came out better then I could have imagined. So simple and so delicious. Make this and you will not be disappointed. A definite keeper.

Not sure if I cooked for too long or this recipe doesn't work, because it was well done.  Too well for me.   Will try another larger cut next month, with less time in the oven.

EXCELLENT! This is the best roast I have ever made. I usually use my crockpot for our roasts, but it went to appliance heaven. I haven't ever cooked a roast in the oven. I followed this recipe to the "T" and my roast was amazing. The family loved it!!!

Great recipe. I cooked mine an additional 10 min at 350 right before we ate, as it got a little cool. I also covered mine with rings of onion and put a little olive oil on top too. Great sauce. Great roast!

This was perfection in my oven.  Though it was done in 65 min (3.8 lbs) .  Thank goodness I had  had preset my thermometer for 145 deg.  I keep my pizza stone in it and had used the oven earlier in the afternoon so it still retained some heat which roasted this a bit quicker.   Will definitely be a repeat for cooking roasts.   Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Just read all the reviews, it seems odd, but everyone can't be wrong. I'm trying this tonight, even though it's for Sundays dinner. I'll re-post with my results.

Absolute perfection! I took out the roast twenty minutes early because we like ours a little rare/medium rare. I will always cook a roast this way and I want to roast prime rib using this method.

This is the best way to do roast beef. My family just love it every time. I use any tough cut of roasting meat and put salt, pepper and any rub I have on hand onto the meat before roasting. I follow the recipes cooking directions and it comes out perfect. I recommend everyone try cooking roast beef this way.

This is not my favorite cut of beef, but I made a salt,pepper, garlic, onion rub and then followed the instructions to the letter...  I sliced it considerably thinner than the photos show...more like roast beef and then smothered that in the not so plentiful aujus.  It was excellent.

I am giving this 4 stars because of the cooking method not really the flavor of the beef. I have a great GE Profile over that has a probe as well so periodically I would just turn the probe on to check the meat temp. It mas at 145* in about 45 minutes. My Eye Round was 3.5lbs. I did like the sear it gets on the outside and the fat side UP is a MUST! If your oven holds heat, watch this beef. ...................That being said, the flavor was just ok. I have a go to rub that is so simple yet so delish that I still can't believe I use it. An old beef farmer gave it to me after I had the best roast on the grill I EVER had. All it is is meat tenderizer over the entire piece of beef and then cover the whole thins in season salt. THAT'S IT!!!!!! I usually use that on steaks and strip's and what not but it would have been PERFECT here! Thanks for a new technique though with my roast. I liked that aspect.

A new favorite for me.  I'm making it for the second time for dinner tonight.  The first time I sliced it up and served it with a rice salad with balsamic dressing.  Tonight I will serve it with some smashed potatoes topped with feta since that is all I have on hand.  Make sure you put a good seasoned "crust" on your meat, it adds a wonderful flavor.

This recipe only works if you have a self-cleaning oven because then it is well insulated to hold the heat longer. It also helps to have your oven preheated for at least 20 minutes before putting the roast in. If you like your meat medium-rare, then this recipe is for you!

I was skeptical but it worked!  I sprinkled it liberally with Harris Ranch grilling spice blend - tasted good.  First night ate it as cooked.  Second night sliced thin and made bbq beef sandwiches.  Third time around used leftover beef to make roast beef hash. Not an ounce of waste!

Followed the directions except removed from the oven when digital thermometer read 150 degrees.  This usually shortens time in oven by 30 minutes. Used lots of Montreal Seasoning and it is always great.

Excellent recipe.  My roast was a bit smaller at 2.2 lbs, so I cut down the cooking time to 2 hours after shutting off the oven, and the could have used even less time than that, being so much smaller than 3 lbs.  Upon removing the roast from the oven, I was very concerned that it would not be done as it did not feel very hot.  I was nervous that the oven may have lost heat too quickly and the roast was not cooked.  But, it turn out perfect!

Absolutely fantastic! I am so glad I tried this recipe even though it made no sense. The roast was very tender, moist, slightly pink inside and delicious. It came out perfect and my oven is 70 years old (a family heirloom). I followed the directions exactly except for substituting garlic salt for regular salt. My husband and I were both so impressed and, I have to admit, amazed. This is definitely a keeper. Our thanks to Lyn for sharing this and to all the gutsy people who tried it and wrote such glowing reviews.

I used an inside round roast, about 8 lbs. My husband was skeptical, but was wowed when it was finished. This will be my fav recipe for roast. Only thing I did different was put some cuts in in it and inserted some garlic slices...yum. Thanks so much for an awesome recipe.

I was very sceptical as well but this turned out fabulous.  As a note, I prepared a 3lb grass fed roast which was VERY lean and had almost no fat.  To ensure it turned out jucy, I did my salt and pepper and  I wrapped it in bacon.  WOW--everyone said it was not only tender, but the smokey bacon flavor really added to the overall deliciousness.

Along with everyone else,  was a bit skeptical with ow this guy would come out. What I added to my marinade was the spanish mojo with garlic salt, pepper and smoked paprika. I let it sit in the oven for the recommended amt of time and when it was done, my family and I were surprised by it's tenderness. (I cooked a 3 lb eye of roast). I will definitely be making this again.

This is SO great! I really enjoy a recipe with very little preparation or effort and MAXIMUM gourmet results!  I used Worcheshire Black Pepper and sea salt to season the outside.  This roast is fantastic! It will see my kitchen table quite a bit from now on.  Served with creamy horseradish sauce.  Can't say enough good things about this recipe!

This recipe is good but I think it's really calling out for garlic! I make a paste of garlic powder, onion powder, salt & pepper and olive oil. Smear it all over the roast and wrap it in plastic wrap. Let it sit for a few hours or overnite. I put it on my rottis - 475 at 15 mins per pound. Then take it off & wrap in foil for 20 -25 mins. Sliced thin on sourdough bread with horseradish sauce & pickled onion- doesn't get much better than this!

I am rating this 5 stars only because I am sure it's amazing when followed correctly. I made the mistake of thinking I could throw this in a slow cooker and get the same results. Um...no. It was super tough and over-cooked. Follow the recipe as is! Everyone is happy with the outcome! Now I have to go buy another eye of round, and try it the RIGHT way!!!  ;)

I'm not a huge roast fan and this was my first attempt at making one on my own.  Turned out perfect!  And, my husband even opened the oven door once before I explained to him that he needed to resist the temptation.  I had a 3.5 lb roast.  I asked my husband if he'd like to cook it or if I should make an attempt.  He said go for it!  I rubbed my roast with kosher salt, pepper, garlic powder, Italian seasoning and paprika.  Cooked for 24 minutes and then turned off oven for 3 hours.  Roast turned out a wonderful medium.  My guests - which were family - told me it was wonderful.  And, even my husband, who is a career chef, told me it was really good.  That's a huge compliment from him!  Usually he's critical of EVERYTHING he eats!

This is my family's favorite recipe and we always serve it for Christmas and New Year's Eve.  It has always turned out perfect and it doesn't even need gravy like most roasts. I just can't believe how easy it is.

This came out great! I was scared also since this was my first roast I'd ever done. I did change some things though. I found another recipe similiar and kind of mixed the 2 together. I put the oven at 500, then turned down to 475 when I put the meat in, then cooked for 21 min, turned off oven and cooked more 20 min per pound. I also added a bunch more seasonings. Took and hour and came out great!!!! Perfect pink throughout! Will be making this again for sure.

We make this roast a couple of time a month.  It is the best lunch meat ever!  We also thick slice it at dinner time.  I love to season it with a thick layer of an italian herbs and seasoned pepper rub.  It comes out wonderful!

WOULD NOT HAVE BELIEVED IT UNTIL I TRIED IT.  WANTED IT MED. RARE AND WOULD HAVE ACHIEVED THAT IF IT HAD NOT BEEN MY FIRST TIME TRYING.  WILL NEVER COOK IT ANOTHER WAY BECAUSE THIS WA PERFECT.  GRAVY FROM THE DRIPPINGS OVER MASHED POTATOES WAS THE JOINT!

I use this method all of the time now!  A tip if you are shorter on time ... just drop the temp to 225-250 .... close to the same results in about an hour less time!

Best roast I have ever made... I used a McKormick envelope of pot roast mix to season the roast. After cooking at high temp, I turned the oven down to 250 for 2 hours.  I then made a mushroom gravy using some of the pan juices... delicious!

You have to have a great oven to do this... I started with a 4.5 lb roast..I did 6 minutes per pound (looking for rare)..and then 2 hours and it was medium... and tough.. not as tender as I would have liked...it's only tender if you cut the slices 1/4" or less...I would do this again.. but I need a meat slicer..this makes GREAT sandwiches!!.. good flavor

Decided to make this for Thanksgiving dinner as my son had requested roast beef and gravy.  I should have listened to my instinct but got swayed by all the positive reviews.  First of all, I did not use eye-of-round but rather a sirloin tip roast.  I brushed it with olive oil and made a rub with onion powder, onion salt, garlic powder and black pepper.  As I was worried about having rare meat which I do not like, I cooked it 9 min/lb and turned down the heat to 200 degrees F for 1/2 hour and then left it in the oven for the remaining 2 hours.  It was quite raw and the few end pieces we could eat were too chewy for us.  It went back in the oven for an hour at 350 degrees F for an hour (meant to leave in in only 1/2 hour but forgot about it and cooked it longer).  It was quite well done but not chewy and actually quite tasty.  I may try a variation on the high temperature method by cooking much longer by pound and reducing oven off time.

Excellent roast beef.  I used 4 pounds and my only issue was it was a little overdone, and the thermometer never got to the correct temperature.  I used the rub someone provided with thyme and paprika (etc) and it was ever so tasty!  And the family LOVED it.

I was disappointed initially, but it turned out okay overall. This was not done in the alloted time, however, next time I will bring my roast to room temperature before I put it in the oven. Then I think it will be okay.

Has potential. The biggest thing is not knowing how its cooking. I have an old stove so it did not hold the heat. I think I will try it again but leave the stove on around 200 like some others have said. We did have to use the microwave to get it done but it did taste good.

Great reviews from all my guests.  I rub the roast with olive oil, sprinkle with  cumin, garlic powder, pepper corns and refrigerate for 24 hours.  Use the high temperate instructions above and the roast comes out of the oven tender and juicy.  I've made this recipe three times, and each time it's been great, everyone asking for the recipe.

Very good.  I would like to add a bit of water next time to make some gravy.

Awesome!  We both liked this a lot!  Not a big fan of my meat being rare so I cooked my roast 11 mins per pound at 475, then shut off the oven a didnt peek for 2 hours.  Did have to reheat this when it was done but it was juicy and flavorful.  Also added several cloves of glaric to the inside.  This is a keeper!

What a good recipe! I'm glad I found it. I also cut a few slits on both side of the roast.  I inserted small pieces of fresh minced garlic. It turned out great.

this was very good and so simple. i seasoned with montreal steak seasoning, preheated my oven for 30 mins. then put the roast in at 500 for 15 mins, then turned it down to 475 for 15 mins. i wanted my 3 lb roast to be well done. turned the oven off anf locked it for 2 hrs. made a gravy from the drippings and a can of beef broth. the hardest part of making this was not opening my oven for 2 hrs, when i knew there was food in there lol.

I too was worried that tonights dinner would be a disaster however was pleasantly surprised by how wonderful this turned out!  I cooked it as recommended by PJL4965 ( preheat oven to 500 - then cook at 475 degrees for 20 mins, 7 mins per lb thereafter, and then let it sit for 20 mins on the counter.)  The roast came out perfectly, medium rare, and was enjoyed by everyone! This is definately a keeper and will be highly recommended !

This is great! Eye of round is no longer pot roast fodder. Now pot roast can be relegated to the cheaper cuts.

Before making this recipe, you should know whether your oven retains heat well or not.  Apparently mine doesn't and the roast was far from even being rare after sitting 3 hours in the oven.  I'll definetely make this again, though next time I'm going to turn my oven from 500 to 250 and see what happens.

This really does come out very rare, my fiance and I made it the other night and were not pleased.  Followed directions exactly and the meat was on the tough side.

This recipe didn't work for me, I followed the recipe exactly  with the exception of the spices.My roast was 3.1 pounds at the end of the 2.5 hours my meat thermometer only registered 130. I had to turn the oven back on and continue to cook it.  The  roast did turn out fine in the end. I don't think I will ever try this again.

Wasn't too crazy about this maybe it's just the cut of meat
