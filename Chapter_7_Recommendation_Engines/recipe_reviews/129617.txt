The wonderful thing about All Recipes is that it is used by a very diverse group of people.  So while this recipe seems very basic and to some even ridiculous, please remember that to a kid just learning to cook this is very valuable.  Also, just because we grew up eating these, does not mean that someone in another country did. So remember that there are people here trying to learn new things to make before you go bashing this recipe for being too simple!

HELPFUL HINTS THAT MAKE THIS A FAVORITE: Just as is, it truly is an All American favorite, but everyone knows there are ways to make this better! First, they come out better (like tx toast) when your skillet is on low.  They have time to cook evenly w/o burning.  Also try spreading a little lite mayo on instead of butter (also less calories) if you want a crispy sammie that is so delicious!  Third, there's always wheat bread&fat-free cheese, but if you're not dieting & want the best ...it's my opinion that potato bread w/melted cheese is!!  If you've got pepperjack cheese, that's always a nice twist too ...as well as a sprinkle of garlic powder.  Then add a slice of tomato in the middle.  Mmmm Mmm Mmmm...  Either way, this is definitely a comfort food I always turn to with a side of tomato soup!  This mommy makes this quite regularly! With the temperature cooling, what better time to have one.  Plus, none of the kids fuss!

Simple is sometimes best!  But I do have to use Velveeta cheese with this recipe.

allrecipes.com caters to all ages.  I for one think it's great that they include simple recipes.  Kids who are learning to cook come on here and this is a great start for them to use the stove.  Obvious to adults, yes.  For some kids, no.  Plus, the process for them is more fun if they get to print out their own recipe rather than making Mom or Dad's recipe (even if they are the same).  I know my niece was very proud to do this yesterday and showed everyone her recipe.  Thanks for the recipe AR.  Made my niece's day!

Well, I made this for the first time 35 yrs ago, hard to remember the details now, but my kids remind me of how good it is.  1 tsp of butter is a bit skimpy, I need MORE!  TIP - If you burn it by "accident" (it does happen)carefully carry sandwich to the sink, with a sharp knife scrape off the burnt part. (make sure to rinse the sink, so your mom doesn't get mad).  Happy Cooking!

Absolutely the best grilled cheese recipe I have ever cooked. But I did make just a few changes. First off I was thinking cheese was not all it is cracked up to be. I used tuna. I toasted the bread and added the tuna. Then I added cheese on top. I grilled it and it was perfect, Thanks allrecipes. I never would have mastered this recipe without you.!

Since Americans tend to eat too many calories, this sandwich is a good choice. The only change I would make is to substitute the white bread for Whole Wheat or multi-grain, and maybe add another slice of cheese if protein is a concern. Otherwise, it certainly is the "American Sandwich."

This is the classic grilled cheese sandwich. I use quite a bit more margarine though. I dip mine in ketchup, the rest of my family loves tomato soup with these.

Just wanted to share our version of this American classic: we like to add sliced pickles to ours. Hubby enjoys jalepenos in his. Sometimes, if the mood strikes, I even add a touch of worchestishire sauce to the butter.

This was the first thing I taught all my kids how to cook when teaching them to use the stove. It has become a staple in my household. It's hot cheesey gooeyness is the ultimate comfort food, add a cup of tomato soup and it's a little piece heaven on earth.

This is the simplest toasted cheese recipe - and one that I've been following since I was 10!!  Occassionally, I would slip bacon and sliced tomato inside or even shaved roast ham or beef.  My husband is an odd ball though, a toasted cheese isn't a toasted cheese without a fried egg in it!

I also have had these since I was a little girl.  Was my family the only family that used a "press" back then (and now) by pressing the sandwich, whilst cooking, with the bottom of a pot big enough to cover the sandwich?  Comes out nice and flat--like it was cooked with a panini press.

I like to pour about two teaspoons of olive oil in a heated skillet. Then quickly place a slice of white bread in the pan and immediately remove to coat one side with oil. Place the second slice of bread in the pan, swirl around by hand to soak up the remainder of the oil, place two slices of American cheese and the first slice of bread on top. Grill about two minutes a side. This is quick, easy and healthy.

You can't go wrong! Mix and matches the cheeses for variety. 
Great with a Cherry Coke or Peach flavored soda.

OMG!!!!  This is so good!  I had a little left over bacon, and you know what??  I put it on the sandwich BEFORE I put it in the pan and the cheese melted on top of it and it tasted so good!  This was really incredible and can't wait to make this for my family on Thanksgiving!

These are delicious, but the easiest way to spread the butter is to melt it in the pan and move the bread slices over the butter after it is melted, place the cheese on one slice of bread and cover with the other. Just a hint!

Wow! This is the most original recipie I've found on here. GREAT b/c it tastes good & is easy to make!!  I personally prefer to use 'real' cheese instead of 'processed cheese' but its great both ways. (Really, I just wanted to be the first to review something :)

Sometimes I like to sprinkle garlic powder on the buttered sides before grilling, but I have to watch the flame so the bread doesn't scorch. Also, instead of a pickle, I take mayo and mix in a bit of horseradish for a dip. It's awesome!

This is a sure winner! Tip: Put 1tbsp. of butter in skillet, then lay down 1 piece of bread. Add cheese on top of slice of bread, then lay other piece of bread over cheese. Flip sandwich over w/ spatula, but ADD another tbsp of butter before flipping! Grill until golden brown, crispy on the outside , soft on the inside.

Yes, it uses what my friend calls fake cheese, but it is the classic, and totally cheesy.  I like almost any grilled cheese, from plain to fancy, but this is the one I actually crave from time to time.  With tomato soup of course.

Recipe is much better using mayo instead of butter to coat the outside of the bread. My family has always used mayo in place of butter because it gives it a sweeter taste and a crispier outside. :-)

This sandwich brings back childhood memories. I use Mayo instead of the butter and it works out great. This is one of my favorite sandwiches. Pure Comfort food!

If you've never made this you have to! It is a classic and oh so yummy.  Adding a slice of ham to the sandwich is also yummy.

Who doesn't like grilled cheese!  I prefer mine with a smidgen of mustard and thin slices of tomato in between the two slices of cheese.

When I make grilled cheese, I often cut up a slice of ham and put it in between the slices of cheese.  The sandwich then turns into hot ham and cheese!

I use kraft velveta it melts the best. Oh so yummy and gooey. For variety sometimes I add bacon or tomatoe. If I want it spicy I add jalopinoes.

Yeah, this is how you make a grilled cheese sandwich. I never thought to follow a recipe, though. :=)

This is a good standby.  I like to make it with sliced swiss cheese and thin slices of fresh apple in between.
