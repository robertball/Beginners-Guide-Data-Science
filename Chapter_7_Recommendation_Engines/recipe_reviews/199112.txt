This marinade was absolutely delicious!! I had to pan sear mine in a cast iron and topped with some reserved marinade at the end of cooking. I'm sure grilled would be ever better. I use this marinade now on lots of stuff.YUM!

Very tasty and easy to make.  I added cilantro to the mix and topped it with a fresh cherry pepper after grilling.  Spicy and delicious.

Won't let me edit my original post. The correct grill time is NOT on the recipe. Waaaay too long.

This was alright.  A little plain by itself so I made a caper cream sauce to go with it.  1/2cup cream, reduced and 2 tablespoons of capers.  I could eat that sauce with just about anything I think;o)  I would make it again.

This recipe would be great if the cooking time weren't so horribly off. Tuna steaks cooked 7 minutes per side are like giant pieces of thick plastic. Go with 3 minutes per side on the grill and check them to see if that is about what you like. Also, double the amount of olive oil so that the marinade can spread across both sides of both tuna steaks.

I wasn't sure I'd like this but I tried it as written and it was excellent.  It was simple to do and it tasted terrific...not too spicy, just flavorful.  I plan to use this marinade often.

This is a favorite in my house.  I usually double the amount of lime juice and crust the garlic gloves with a press instead of mincing.

I made this tonight and it was good, although it could have used more marinade.  I even added a little more olive oil as someone had suggested in one of the reviews I read.   Definitely don't want to cook tuna steaks more than 3 minutes per side, which is what I did. I used a cast iron skillet on med high heat, served with a mixed veg and fingerling potatoes, which made for a nice meal.   Will try this again.

The combination of the pepper, garlic, lime juice and avacado is a real taste treat!  I added extra lime juice and garlic, and included the zest of the lime.  Substituted a rub for the pepper.  Pan seared in a cast iron skillet due to time.  Can't wait to try on the grill...

Fresh and bright flavors.  My jalapeño was  slightly lacking in heat, look forward to more fire.  I used the whole recipe for 2 6 oz. pieces of tuna.  Reserved appx 2 teaspoons to top after grilling.  I slightly overcooked (for our taste) but still enjoyed.  Served with tomato and avocado salad.

This is our favorite recipe!  My husband has made this numerous times (sorry for the late posting) since it is my favorite meal.  He doubles the "sauce" so I can "dip" my meal in.  Southerners love their dips/sauces...especially with this meal.  Delicious!!

We just used this recently when grilling our ahi tuna and it was delicious.  So easy and very tasty!  I would probably marinade it a bit more but otherwise I don't think I'd change it much.

This turned out great.  I added some shallots to the mix, and sauteed everything together, then marinated the steaks overnight so they would absorb the flavor.  I kept some in reserve for topping the fish after words.  I will definitely make this again!

My husband and I are doing weight watchers and this recipe was super friendly for the program!  I was skeptical since I much prefer sushi to cooked fish, but I loved it!  I didn't have any olive oil on hand so I did vegetable, but I will try it again and use olive oil.  Thanks for sharing this one!

This recipe was great!  The only changes I made was first I doubled the recipe, then I added soy sauce instead of salt and 1tsp of fresh ginger!  Will definitely make it again!

This is one of my favorite ways to eat seafood; scallops, shrimp, any fish for that matter.  I use this marinade for whatever fish ends up in my fish  tacos- so good and I don't find it spicy, just very flavorful.

This was the first time my husband has eaten tuna steak.  He really liked it.  We are slowly changing our diet to include more fish.  This will be a recipe we use again.

We made this with Blackfin Tuna we caught in Key West. The recipe was outstanding! Simple & flavorful. We added cilantro & marinated for 2 hours in fridge. Really blown away with the simple flavor & how pretty the presentation is! Made it on indirect charcoal grill so it was nice & smokey. Using leftovers for smoked fish dip!!!

Loved this recipe! Only thing I added was some lime zest. Paired it with an avocado mango salad that had cashews, mint and cilantro. It paired so well with the Tuna. The Jalapeño marinade wasn't too spicy.. It was perfect! Will make it again in the near future.

Loved the marinade. I decided to marinade mine for 2 hours and only grilled the tuna 2 1/2 minutes each side.  Next time I will add a little cilantro to the marinade.

I love spicy food and I was really sad when I found this but did not have any jalapeño peppers however I substituted with crushed red pepper. I also cooked on the stove since it's a polar vortex outside right now. I used chili infused olive oil and added a few shrimp. I had this over a bed of spinach with some feta cheese and a light vinaigrette dressing. Really quick easy and tasty.

This was a nice tuna recipe, but I found myself wanting a little something more, like a sauce.  I did have to call a last minute audible and sub lemon juice for the lime juice when I discovered we were out as I was prepping the marinade (too many mojitos...?).  There wasn't a ton of heat, so don't be afraid of the spice if you're not a spicy fan (I did deseed and demembrane my jalap, though).  THANKS for the recipe, JasBradley!

Wow! Doubled the lime and an extra little pour of olive oil, then reduced it slightly with a splash of white wine and cilantro.  Also because I would rather not fire up the grill in a snow storm I seared it for 3 minutes on each side in the cast iron skillet like some other reviewers suggested, removed the blackenned fish and and then did the sauce super quick.  My husband loved it and so did I.

Delicious! I have also used this marinade on swordfish steaks, and it was just as yummy! This is a new favorite at my house.

This is an amazing marinade!  We used it the first time on tuna but now more often use it for shrimp to put in tacos.  Absolutely delicious! I live in an apartment with no access to a grill so I just saute the tuna or shrimp and get to use the cooked garlic and jalapeno from the marinade as sauce/garnish. Yummmmmm!

I made these last night for when my boyfriend came back to town.  Always nervous serving a new recipe, but wow, what a success.  Marinade was easy as could be.  Only changes were that it marinated 3 hours because his plans got delayed.  Also, I seared each side quickly on the infrared burner, then moved it to the regular grill and spread all the good bits and pieces of jalapeno and garlic on top. I only cooked 5 minutes total, because I like tuna raw on the inside.  One fantastic piece of fish.

Loved it!!  True keeper, we had 1.5 of steaks so used 2 jalapenos, we like spike.  But flavor was excellent. Also only cooked for 5 min per side, like it a little pink still inside

I made this recipe exactly and it was amazing.  I do like my tuna rare so that is the only change I made; searing it just a few minutes on each side.  Loved the flavors and my husband gave rave reviews. I might use this with chicken or steak...so yummy!

I agree with others that the grilling time was too long. I did 5 minutes on a side and it was slightly overdone. 3-5 minutes a side depending on thickness would be better. I would add more jalapeno next time, it didn't have much jalapeno flavor. Garlic/lime was nice.

I thought this was going to be spicy, so I cut down on the jalapenos.  When I made it, I prepped it, froze it, and threw it in the cooler to take camping. After it thawed and I cooked it, there was a fabulous jalapeno flavor, and a good balance of lime, but it was not spicy at all.  Made for a wonderful dinner while camping.

Doubled the marinade so I would have a little left over to top with before serving. My wife and I both like it spicy so I made a chipotle mayo for dipping on the side.
It was a very good simple dish  as it should be with tuna being the star. I will definitely make it again with shrimp as others has mentioned.

I don't know why I didn't rate this the first time I made it, but made it again today and it was just as delicious as it was the first time.Due to circumstances, I ended up marinating the tuna for about 3 hours. I doubled the ingredients for the marinade, included a tblsp of chopped Cilantro, and used the excess marinade with a bit of cream and reduced to make a  sauce for serving. I don't have a grill so I cooked the Tuna for 2.5 minutes each side in my frying pan. Served it with guacamole and creamed cauliflower. Perfect low carb meal!
This really is a great recipe. So simple but so delicious.
Thank you, Jas...this a keeper.

This was fine, but the jalapeno flavor gets lost. Next time, I'd use more of them and marinate for longer.

Followed the directions, except added more olive oil.  Only marinated for about 15 minutes.  Grilled the tuna steaks about 2 minutes per side at about 500 degrees.    They were a little overcooked, but that was my fault.     My husband and I both loved them!   I could have used more marinate to pile on top after grilling.  Next time I will double the recipe.

This recipe is fantastic! I put the doubled marinade ingredients in my little smoothie maker and pulsed it - also added about 1/4 t salt and 1/2 t black pepper to the marinade rather than salting to taste at the table. It was SO GOOD! GREAT recipe! I cooked the extra marinade in a little saucepan as the tuna was grilling and topped each steak with a generous portion. Wonderful. 3 minutes per side was a titch rare for our tastes, so I'll be doing 4 next time. Thank you for a great supper, Mr. Bradley!

One of the most amazing marinades for Tuna I have ever made! However, I must say, I bought two of the best Yellowfin Tuna steaks from my local organic store (cut from the loin). The combination of a good tuna steak and marinade, made this dish outstanding! I put the tuna steaks on the grill...tasty!!

Ok- so I rated this three stars. I made this recipe as written with two exceptions: 1) cook time 2-3min per side 2) added cilantro. This recipe is seriously lacking- I have made quite a bit of seafood recipes in my years and this one was a disappointment. First of all there is zero reason to marinate this... So here is what I would do next time: I would salt and pepper the steak and cook it (grill or pan sear) and then I would make a white wine sauce using those same ingredients. I would plate the meal and drizzle the sauce on it. This will allow much better flavor in every bite. If you choose to make this written recipe please be sure to salt and pepper the steak itself- not just the marinade like it states.

This will become a staple in our household, super tasty and healthy. Given prior reviews I made extra marinade, used less for the kids and more for the adults. Made in a scan-pan and it formed a beautiful crust, kept the tuna moist.

Very delicious!  I did drizzle a little Kikoman Teriyaki sauce just before I put it on the grill.   A hit for the whole family!

This recipe is a definite keeper.  The marinade is excellent and not too spicy.  I even mixed a little left over marinade with heavy cream for a drizzle on the finished steaks.  The only reason I did not give this recipe 5-stars is because the timing is off.  If you cook your tuna steaks that long be prepared to chew!  They'll be dry and tough.

Recipe was pretty darn spot on; however, after reviewing the comments we decided to add fresh cilantro as well to top things off. I highly encourage you to not follow the cooking time and only do it for 3 minutes on each side. Don't be afraid to add more lime juice too!

Really easy and absolutely delicious. I used a bit more olive oil and had to swap lemon juice with the lime juice and used cayenne pepper instead of black pepper. Since I had the time I marinated this for 6 hours in a freezer bag.
The combination of flavors was very nice and the tuna stayed juicy and aromatic.

Made this for DH and he liked it.  He wishes there would have been a little extra of the jalapeño sauce to go with it.

This was my first time ever having a tuna steak before. (and my picky husband) The only thing I changed is that I used coconut oil instead of olive oil.  This is a fantastic recipe that I will make again. I didn't tell my husband what it was until he ate a bite and he loved it too!
