I really like this soup. I did change a few things, but only because I'm trying to be vegetarian. So, obviously, I left out the meat. To compensate, I added another bell pepper and a bit if extra rice; I also used some homemade veggie broth I needed to use up instead of beef base and the water. Not huge changes, just preferential. Thanks for the recipe!

I have made this twice in the last three weeks! I halve the recipe because I don't have a big enough pot for more. It still makes about 8 bowls of soup! The first time I made it we didn't have diced tomatoes so I cut up 4 whole tomatoes and that tasted better than canned. I didn't have beef base so I used one tablespoon of powdered boullion (for the halved recipe) I also substituted cooking brown rice for white boil in bag rice. The first time I only used one bag, and the second I used two. Both were good, but adding two bags made it heartier. Using fast rice cut cooking time by nearly half. This soup tastes better the second day too!
EDIT: Even 2 years later this is a staple in our house, especially during the winter months.  I have since simplified the (halved) recipe to this:

1 1/2 green peppers,
1 medium onion,
1-2 teaspoons minced jarred garlic,
1lb ground beef,
2 -14oz cans diced tomatoes (standard size can) undrained,
2 -14 oz cans tomato sauce,
1 regular carton beef broth,
2 cups water (omit if you buy the 50% more free carton broth-combo of broth and water should be 6 cups),
30 grinds of black pepper
2 cups (when dry) white rice, cooked before adding to soup.

This is a good start and mirrors the stuffed pepper filling pretty well.  My suggestion though is to use beef broth, not water for the soup and rice.  Also, use ground chicken or turkey with some ground chorizo (beef or pork) combined instead.  Somewhat healthier and much more flavor, also less grease.  The last issue is this might call for a little too much sugar.  Ketchup is already loaded with sugar so cutting the brown sugar in half might be just as good.

I made a few changes based off what I had on hand. The biggest one being that I used a box of Uncle Ben's Brown Rice & Quinoa Roasted Red Pepper instead of plain brown rice. I've gotta tell you that this added a ton of flavor and was quite delicious. I left out the brown sugar altogether because I knew it would make it too sweet for my liking. Lastly I added some celery for extra crunch. This is a recipe where you can substitute a little here and there and it is very forgiving. Thanks for sharing!

I made a few variations to this, & it turned out excellent. I added a T soy sauce, used the chicken broth suggested, but only 2 qt. & added the rice uncooked to the soup right away so it would cook in the soup broth. I like thick soup, so this was perfect for me.

I used this recipe as a starting point and made the following changes:
32 oz beef broth instead of the 3 qts water and tomato sauce,
family size tomato soup instead of the ketchup, beef base and brown sugar.

The flavor was fabulous and the whole family enjoyed this soup.  It made enough for my family of six plus a gallon to freeze.

This recipe  is really good.  I used yellow and red peppers and cream of tomato soup vs adding the ketchup and brown sugar.  I take some over to elderly family and they really enjoy it as well.

This was a very yummy soup.  I did add red peppers with the green and it was awesome.  

I had plenty of time so I just added the rice to the soup and let it cook away.

I make this recipe pretty often, people always rave about it when I serve it to them. I make a few changes either for my liking or to make it more keto-friendly. I dont add the ketchup or brown sugar and instead add probably about a 1/8th cup worshtershire sauce. I substitute a small amount of the water for beef broth (8oz) and dont add the beef base. I also dont add rice but instead buy the steam-in-the-bag califlower rice and add it towards the end already steamed. I'll occasionally add other veggies, like corn or zucchini to add more heft to the soup. This soup reheats really well, which you will probably do because even a half recipe makes a lot of soup.

Family loved it. Made a few changes no garlic, no brown sugar, and only cooking for 2 so less tomatoes. Still had plenty of taste and filling.

This recipe is so good and it makes a lot!  I added dry rice and the appropriate amount of water to cook in the soup mixture.  So, I tweaked the method a little To make it less complicated.

I didn't have a couple of things called for so I adjusted it. I used chicken bouillon granules, a cup of salsa (med).. 16oz. of my homemade ketchup that had no sugar or corn syrup in it!   And left out the brown sugar.  Put it all... the regular rice, raw, thawed HB meat in my electric pressure cooker for 20 minutes.  Amazing!

This was a very popular soup with the family and extremely easy to make,  the leftovers were scooped up by the next day and that is rare around here!  My personal taste would have liked a little more variety in the flavors, some extra spicing and less tomato "overload" but no one else seemed concerned about that.  Be sure to prepare the brown rice separately and be positive it is done before you add it to the soup- brown rice has a way of being stubborn about cooking all the way through and you don't want to run the soup because it is now full of crunchy kernels you can't remove!  I think the author's suggestion of instant brown rice is a good one, and an additional time saver to boot.

Got this simmering on the stove following recipe mostly as is, and after tasting wasn't too impressed. It seemed a little flat and the flavor balance was a bit too on the tomato side for me.  If I think about the proportions I typically use for stuffed green peppers the pepper is the most dominant flavor. It's not a bad start, if I go by this again I'll double the green peppers. I left out the ketchup and the sugar, I just didn't see the point of including those flavors, and helped out the flavor with a teaspoon of Penzey's Berbere seasoning which gave it a bit more depth.

I put the rice right in the mix and added water to make the soup. Add any flavor or Mrs. Dash to taste.
