Great sauce.  I plan to tweak it a bit, but this is a really good start.  It's not too sweet, not too vinegary, not too ketchupy, not too mustardy.

This was great on ribs. I cooked the ribs for an hour in a rice cooker with 3/4 cup of this sauce, 1/2 cup broth, and 6 ounces beer. The only change I made was to add a few drops of Sriracha hot sauce when it was simmering.

I give this a 4 star review, with the 5th being because of my twist and additions to it.

I like to use recipes as a base, and the tailor them to my liking. Sooo....here's what I did.

I added 2 diced jalapenos, 1 diced poblano pepper, 1 (7oz) can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, a dash of cumin, a splash or two of liquid smoke.

It starts with a hint of sweet and heats up as it finishes!

My first attempt at homemade BBQ sauce- what took me so long? Pretty darn tasty- only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because I had nothing to compare it to. I really like the texture that the blender gives, and it makes for a nice even flavor. Froze half of it and it tasted just as good after thawing as it did when I first made it. Used it to dress a southern pulled pork recipe from this site. Yum!

Excellent sauce, but the recipe was far too tangy for me, so I added an extra 1/4 cup of brown sugar. After that minor change, DELICIOUS with the leftover sliced brisket.

This was very easy and very good even though I cheated a bit and used dried onion and didnt use the blender.  Next time I will because I think it will be even better!

I've never really liked any homemade barbecue sauces, but I think that's just because I hadn't yet stumbled on this GREAT sauce--it's zingy with a great spicy finish. I didn't have enough chili powder on hand, so I improvised the chili powder with cayenne, cumin, a bit of garlic powder, and paprika, and also added ground black pepper which made it nice and toasty tasting. 
I have a habit of improvising as I cook, even when I try new recipes (oops) In any case, here's a list of the additions I put into my batch of sauce:
Soy sauce (low sodium, though that's just a personal preference.
Frank's Spicy sweet sauce
a bit extra brown sugar
and the improvised chili powder I mixed up

I used this sauce in a crockpot with some pork chops, and WOW were they good, and tender! I plan on trying chicken next :)
