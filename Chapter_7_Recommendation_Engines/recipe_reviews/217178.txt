BEAUTIFUL!  This has to be one of the best looking coffee breads around!  It was a fun thing to make and has so many possible ways to flavor it.  I used the "Cheese Filling" recipe from this site and spread it over the dough prior to cutting the strips.  I was looking for a cheese danish flavor and it went so well with the raspberry.  I used a pizza wheel to cut the strips and also used a pizza pan for baking it.  To apply the raspberry preserves, I used a pastry bag so I could squeeze a nice amount into the blossoms.  So YUMMY!  Love that raspberry flavor!  Thank you Sarah-May for sharing such a BEAUTIFUL YUMMY recipe!

Awesome! Blossom!  The texture of this bread is spot on; light and fluffy center crumb and perfect crust.  Instructions for the blossom is superb!  Used regular active dry yeast and 6 cups of flour and the dough was somewhat tacky, but not to worry, flour your hands to handle the dough and after the first rise, the dough will be perfect.  My dough rolled out two 15" discs.  I cut 6 wedges per quarter and the first disc came out perfect.  I baked it for 30 minutes and then quickly brushed on soften butter all over the blossom and filled it with apricot/pineapple preserve.  For the second disc, I made one of my favorites~Cinnamon Roll Blossom~Deliciously stupendous!   Spectacular presentation for various combinations of fillings!  Definitely a Treasure!  Thanks  Sarah-May!

Sarah, you most certainly have a winner here. This was fabulous and like the others have said, the dough was incredibly easy to work with. I did end up using a total of about 7 cups of flour before it was over with though. I don't know if the humidity here just required more or what but it was wonderful. They turned out HUGE. Since I had two to serve to my guests for Easter brunch, I did one with raspberry jam and flavored the glaze for that one with almond extract. The other one and probably my favorite was filled with a lemon-pear marmalade and topped with almonds. The glaze on this one was the one you recommend and I mean to tell you that this was a very nice and a really unexpected treat for everyone here. There really are so many things  you can do with this and I intend to try some other combos soon. My daughter and I put these together and I think that for her to see that yeast is not as intimidating as she thought, she may give it a shot herself. UPDATE; I made this again for Mother's Day and took the advice of WFDM, using almond paste for one, and the lemon -pear marmalade for the other. I also spread each filling on the dough prior to being cut so that some of it would be intertwined in the bun. Great idea and one I'll be doing from now on. The almond paste was a bit too stiff to spread, so after breaking off pieces of it, I used my rolling pin to press it into the dough. Worked like a charm.

We loved this bread, it had wonderful flavor.  However, I took the advice of SHORECOOK and made the cheese filling from this site.  I have NO idea how she got the cream cheese not to ooze everywhere while twisting the strips.  My first "blossom" I did as she did - spread the filling before cutting the strips.  This resulting in ooey gooey mess all over my counter, hands, the pan, everywhere, and not much filling in the rosettes.  My second blossom I formed first and the added a big dollop of cheese filling in the wells before baking. While this worked way better, this shape does not lend itself to holding much filling at all, and a lot of it oozed out onto the pan.  None of this was the fault of the recipe, though, so can't rightly take any stars off.  Either way, we loved the taste, but I would probably not repeat the shape next time, as we like more than a teaspoon of filling per serving.  Also, one last note - the instructions say to roll to a 12-in circle, mine were MUCH bigger than this.  If I did repeat this shape, I would make 3 smaller blossoms, not 2 huge ones.  All in all, I WILL make this bread again, just tinker it to suit our tastes.

Amazing.  I'm Ukrainian and grew up with my baba's Easter bread so can attest that this bread's texture is spot on.  It is also NOT bland and is the way it is supposed to be.  My only comment is that with the raspberry and glaze, it was too sweet for us and more like a danish.  I would cut the jam and glaze in half next time.  The "flower" thing did take some practice, but the second one was much prettier.

Really fun, pretty and super rich bread. All in all, just delicious! I absolutely loved the lemon flavor in the dough. I thought the glaze was a nice touch and went well with the raspberry jam, although I went quite light when drizzling it on. It's nice that this recipe can be halved easily. I wasn't serving a large crowd so I halved it but used two whole eggs. On the other hand, if making the whole recipe, the great thing is it's versatility in that you can vary the jam, glaze and other add-ons to give variety when making two loaves. I really look forward to making this again and trying on some different flavors. Thanks for bringing this recipe together, Sarah-May!

Fantastic recipe and much easier to make than it looks! I've made this 3 times and I've come up with some steps that make it even easier: 1) I cut the recipe in half and make the dough in my
bread machine; 2) I place the dough on the parchment-lined pizza pan after I roll it into a circle and cut and form it right on the pan; 3) I use kitchen scissors instead of a knife to cut the dough into strips; 4) After I form the center petal, I twist all the remaining strips first, then form them into petals one after another. Also, I didn't care for the lemon glaze, so I use a simple vanilla glaze recipe. If you're confused on how to cut and form the petals, check out the photos of the recipe. They're very helpful. I LOVE THIS RECIPE!

When I looked at this bread, I was expecting to eat a pastry but when I ate it, it was more like a dinner roll with the drizle of sugar and jam. I would use the dough recipe again because it is very tasty for a roll. The shape is wonderfull!  it came out just like in the picture or even better!!! I am going to use this shape again for sure. Thank you so much for this beautiful presentation.

Excellent. As per others' suggestions, I used the Cheese Filling in this recipe, making holes to put it in after the dough had risen. After I baked it, I also added some raspberry jam, and I used a more mild glaze with just a little lemon zest so that it wouldn't be too lemony and conflict with the cheese filling. It was delightful and looks wonderful.

This bread was easy to make, looks beautiful and is delicious.  Similar to a danish, I may as well play with the shape, as I would prefer a flatter design.  But it is wonderful as is and you can fill it with whatever suits your taste!

Awesome. Dough was easy to work with, rose beautifully. I had oranges, not lemons, so used orange zest and juice. It was excellent; went very well with the lekvar/prune butter and cream cheese filling I used in it. 

Also, made it ahead by shaping the dough and placing it in the fridge for the final rise. That worked well, but give the dough an hour to come to room temp before you cook it. I didn't, and had to cook it for 12 extra minutes.

Thank you Sarah-May for this recipe! The step by step photos were a big help in making it. I made half a recipe to "road test" the recipe and the family really enjoyed the bread.  My dough did make a circle a bit larger than 12 inches, which made it a bit harder to fit all the "petels" into place.  Next time I will trim off dough if I need to.  At the time I made this, I didn't have a lemon on hand, so used a bit of lemon extract in the dough---next time I will wait until I have the lemon, as the lemon zest is a must!!  I used a seedless, black raspberry jam, but will experiment with other jams or a cream cheese type filling.  Thanks Sarah-May for a wonderful recipe.

Wonderful bread!  This is such a versatile recipe! I made one loaf lemon and the other cinnamon/nuts.  I did use the cream filling recipe that other reviewers recommended but only spread it about 1/4 inch thick.  The filling was absorbed by the bread giving it a VERY slightly gooey texture but no discernible "filling."  I am planning on trying this out with breakfast foods inside (ham and cheese, sausage, bacon, etc) and making them for Christmas morning!  There are a hundred ways to change this around and I am excited by every single one!  Thank you for such a GREAT recipe!!!

Made for Easter breakfast.  The dough was very nice to work with and had a very nice flavor.  It baked up nice and fluffy as well.  Moist and flaky - LOVE that!  One blossom I used almond paste with more ground walnuts and some candied citron.  The other blossom I used a cream cheese mixed with powdered sugar and strawberry pie filling.  This was a fun recipe to make with the kids, too.  Will be enjoying this recipe again, and SOON!

This is a great recipe!  I made my first batch 2 days to take on a picnic with us.  The only change I made was to use 1/4 wheat flour and 3/4 white flour. very good!  I'm in the middle of making a second batch today.   I skipped the lemmon zest and subbed Vanilla Soymilk for the milk. I divided the dough into 3 parts since the first batch seemed to thick.spread 2 T butter and sprinkled cinnamon/brown sugar on 2 of the rounds before slicing and rolling (per request from my husband) and going to put cream cheese in the third.  thanks for posting this!

It's long past Easter but I couldn't resist this recipe. It's adorable and the dough is a dream to work with, I will use it for other shaped breads. I only have traditonal yeast so proofed with some of the warmed milk and made the dough using the standard method. There were no lemons in the house so I added a TBSP of vanilla to the dough and made the icing w/heavy cream and vanilla. After shaping I put the pans in the fridge overnight then  let them come to room temp and rise before baking the next a.m. (took approx 2 hours). The photos were a great help, thanks for adding them. Two minor issues: IMO the dough needs more salt, I would increase to 1.5 or 2 tsp. The bread did dry out fairly quickly, I would try reducing the bake time by a couple of minutes next time.

My family really liked this bread.  I found the recipe easy to follow and the pictures were very helpful.  I'm not giving this a full 5 stars as I found the bread to not be as soft as I would have liked it to be after cooling.  But while warm this was delicious

Last Thanksgiving I baked a loaf of banana bread to my bfs parents house and to my horror, it was terrible.  I still don't know why, since I have been baking blue ribbon bread sine I was 9.  I was determined to redeem myself at Easter.  This recipe did the trick!  Everyone loved this beautiful and delicious bread.  Now I am in charge of bread for every family dinner.  Thank you so much for this "fancy" bread idea!

Beautiful AND delicious! What more could you ask for in a holiday treat? I didn't have a fresh lemon, so I couldn't include the lemon zest in the bread dough, but it was still fantastic. I can't wait to try this using a sweetened cream cheese filling in place of the fruit spread. Thanks, Sarah-May, for a fantastic treat!

This is an awesome recipe and really customizable.  I did one with jams from the fridge and one with the cheese filling recipe like another reviewer suggested.  I really enjoyed the cheese filled version without any jam/jelly, but both were really good!

This bread was simple to make and delicious to eat! I cannot believe how beautiful the dough was to work with. I halved the recipe, just to make 1 loaf, and mixed everything up in the bread machine (I did use 2 eggs and added a extra flour as needed to the machine to make up for it). When the dough cycle was complete, I proceeded with the recipe. After cutting the strips, I brushed the whole thing w/ melted butter and sprinkled it w/ cinnamon sugar and spread on some orange marmalade. Twisted and shaped it as directed (which was SO EASY to do...great instructions Sarah-May), and let it rise from there. After it rose, while the oven was heating, I put more orange marmalade into all the crevices, and brushed it with the leftover melted butter, only because I didn't want to waste it. It only took about 15-18 minutes in my super hot oven. It smelled sooooo good while baking and baked up so beautifully! I could hardly wait for it to cool so I could glaze and eat it, lol. LOVED the tart lemon glaze w/ the sweetness of the bread...PERFECTION! The possibilities are endless with the fillings for this bread, and I'll be trying many different kinds! Thanks, Sarah-May, for an EXCELLENT recipe! :)

Very pretty and tasty. My son loved it.  It is definitely a process, but nice end result and I am not a great bread maker.  I followed the directions exactly.

disappointed that the bread tasted bland so, it was a good thing the recipe called for glazing. Expected more for all of the time it took.

This was very delicious. It was also fun to make. Don't let the lengthy directions deter you from making this bread. I love the slight lemon taste from the zest. I followed the recipe to the letter, and nothing needs to be changed. Good going Sarah-May for such clear and precise directions, not to mention a beautiful Easter bread.

This was really delicious and easy to make. It came out looking beautiful, family could not believe I made it. I was not crazy about the tangy glaze so next time I will just use milk instead. This is one of the best breads I have made, definitely a keeper. I also added chopped walnuts on top for added pizazz!

Just made it, turned out perfect! Thank you Sarah. I made the rosettes as mentioned, but I made them Individual. And sprinkled with cinnamon sugar. And they came out really nice, moist & delicious. Thanks for the exact recipe. A keeper.

I poured all liquid ingredients in the bowl and let my Kitchen Aid do its thing.   And then after an hour it didn’t rise.  Ah geez, I forgot to add the yeast.  Back in the bowl and let my Kitchen Aid have at it.  So, despite my cantankerousness, this was wonderful. I loved the addition of the lemon zest.   I used peach preserves from a local farm which was a perfect compliment to the richness of the dough.  This is a beautiful coffee bread that is delightful.

Must be rasberry jam. Amazing. Put a little sugar on top of it with the egg wash.

What a nice presentation this makes! Made this for my baking class this week - they all loved it. I put everything into my KitchenAid stand mixer - all the dry ingredients first, then the wet.  The assembly instructions are excellent but the photographs, especially of the cut dough, especially help. The one thing I'll do next time is not tuck the outer "flowers" too close into the center flower.  Orange zest can be substituted for the lemon for an alternative pleasing taste.

oh my, this bread was the star of our Easter! I had company and got enthusiastic reviews and compliments galore. Didn't change a thing, the bread is moist, pretty and not difficult at all, but people wonders what a great baker you are... a word of advice, be sure to form the blossom on the baking sheet directly, otherwise you could have some problems moving it, and you most certainly will have to reshape it. Can't wait to try it with lemon curd instead, but Nutella should be great indeed too!

Loved it but it dried out very quickly. Thankfully it was yummy enough that it was all gone and we didn't have to worry about leftovers.

I made this as a date project with my Mom. She knows a lot about making bread so some tips that you can’t know without practice I got from her along the way(dough consistency etc). It took all afternoon but it was super fun and the final result was fabulous. My Mom was even asking for the recipe!

So much fun I made with my daughter. We only changed the flour to whole wheat organic un-bleached. She used Raspberry and I used Loganberry both were delicious.

I just finished making, very easy instructions to follow, I watched the video to see how the flowers were made and it was fantastic.  Easy, fun, delicious, I ended up using canned cherries for my “filling” and they were perfect,  I used a cream cheese powdered sugar drizzle on top, it made it very festive.  I didn’t change a thing, followed the recipe, well accept for the cherries instead of jam,  and it worked perfectly, thanks for the recipe

This dough really needs more salt, it comes out a bit bland without it. I'll double it next time. Also, I recommend baking the loaves on two separate baking sheets as they do not fit properly on one and you'll end up compromising on shape.

Fun to make, and was totally a hit at Easter brunch!  I cut the recipie in half and only made one bread but afterward wished that I had made two. It's sweet like a light sweetbread but not quite as sweet as a pastry. The jam and lemon icing really made it come together.
