Cut recipe in  half.  2 skinless, boneless chicken breast. Used half green bell pepper & half yellow bell pepper.  Had diced black olives in the house.  Added 1tbl of cornstarch & 1tbl sugar to thicken the sauce up.  Served over white rice.  The whole family loved it even the kids!

I probably changed the heart of the recipe by doing this, but I omitted the olives because I didn't have any on hand!  Still, I'd never cooked chicken in orange juice with peppers before and it was very good!  Made for a sweet, soft chic.  Will make the right way next time!

I didn't use a whole chicken, but rather a couple of boneless, skinless breasts so my measurements were a little different and I am not big on exact measurements anyway, but the basic flavor I am sure was the same.  Oh, and I had no red pepper so omitted those.  I used freshly juiced OJ from my Juiceman and I thought the flavor was very nice.  Different, but nice.  I think maybe some white rice would have sopped up the sauce very well, but I didn't have any.  Never having had Colombian food, I can't comment on that, but overall this was pretty good and easy to make.

The chicken came out very tasty and tender, I added some chicken spices to marinate it in for about 3 hours. However, there was too much juice. Should have added some flour or sugar to thicken it up. Serving over rice would also be a good idea.

Great, easy dish!  I served over rice (which helps soak up the extra orange juice) and pinto beans.

A tangy twist on the standard chicken.  Very simple ingredients means I'm not feeding my family a bunch of junk.  I sauteed the onions and peppers in olive oil before putting them over the chicken & then served it over brown rice.  My husband said I could definitely make that again!

Not much flavor.  The skin had a less than desirable texture.  The chicken cooked up well though so it wasn't a total loss.  But husband ended up eating a bowl of canned soup.  Overall not one of the best recipes on here.

I cooked it longer uncovered at 400 because the sauce was too runny

The flavor was good.  I didn't have OJ, only low-cal pineapple juice.  The sauce was very thin so I drained it off and will reuse the veggies in another recipe.  I sauteed the veg and garlic before baking, too.  The suggestion to serve over rice is good, to soak up all the juice.  Good, kind of different favor.  Not my fave, but worthy of trying once anyway!

Didn't change a thing. My husband and I did not care for this. Thanks anyway.
