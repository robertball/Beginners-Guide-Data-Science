I loved this, really delicious. I did make a small change, I added 5 cloves of garlic finely chopped, added during step 2. These were earth shaking, my gourmet club loved them also. The first time I made them I ate one before the club assembled and it's a good thing because I would not have gotten even one after the gang got finished. The next meeting I was ordered to make them again, this time I made a triple batch, they all vanished. Thanks for sharing

I am so glad that I saw this recipe! When I try a new recipe,I don't change a thing. I don't feel that it's fair to change a recipe and then review it. These don't need any changes. They are just wonderful the way they are. Perfection in a mushroom cap!

Delicious recipe.  I tried it once as written, but to make it a 5, I recommend a little tweaking that I tried the second time:  I included the (chopped) mushroom stems in the stuffing, and I added a little sherry, Worcestershire sauce, and fresh horse radish, and I used fresh dill, rather than dried.  I also used a combination of baby Portabella and button mushrooms. The choice of mushrooms had little effect on the end result, but I have a slight preference for the Portabella flavor and texture.  With those minor modifications, this is my favorite stuffed mushroom recipe ever.

i love crab and shrooms and cheese, how could you not like theis? well you need to  love all, and if you do, you will make this over and over again as i have, the touch of wine is great, didn't have enough butter so mixed it with some imperial margarine, turned out great, choose the right size of shrooms, so that the rest of the stuffing, does not go to waste, well it wont, because you can freeze it, do not freeze with stuffing in the shrooms, please tryt his at least once, i have turned non shroom lovers into shroom lover's with this great recepie, it will be at arms lengths at all times, as an anytizer!

Made 2 batches.  One as written.  Group liked them.  Many said there was something missing.  Batch two I added more onion, a bunch of fresh minced garlic, a pinch of crushed red pepper and a decent sprinkle of smoked paprika.  They loved them.  My crew loves bold flavors, so purely a matter of personal taste.  Just know who you are cooking for and adjust the recipe accordingly.  I cook by sight, feel and taste, not necessarily measurements.  Overall a fantastic recipe and you can't go wrong.

Not sure which recipe was posted first because they are both the same (Savory Crab Stuffed Mushrooms) but OMGeeeee!! Yummm!! I added a tad of Garlic, Worchestershire and Horseradish to the stuffing and used sweet onion and seasoned dry bread crumbs instead of green onions and soft bread crumbs (only because thats what I had) and added the stems that I chopped up to the filling.... Will DEFINATELY be making these again!!

I made these for Christmas dinner (appetizer) and they were a hit.  I am a diver and spear lobster which I had on hand in the freezer.   With that being said I used lobster meat instead of crab.  Chopped it fine as were the instructions for the crab.  Yummy!  Can't wait to make these again.  Thank you for the recipe Lisa.

Sure sounded tasty -- so followed the recipe exactly.  We've enjoyed far better recipes, which were full of flavor.  Our guests did not finish these (and they love good food!).   Too me, these were a waste of expensive ingredients.

I didn't have an EGG!! But I don't think it made a difference. They sure are cheesy. They have a very mild flavor so I added a scant 1/4 tsp of cayenne. Was very good.

I used less than 1/8 tsp of dill, and it was perfect. Dill is a very strong herb to me, and it can overpower a dish. All other ingredients I used exact amounts, and it was so delicious!!!

Gosh, these were good! I changed a couple things -added garlic with the onions, cooked the crab with the garlic and onion, and added Perfect Pinch Lemon Herb Spice (didn't have Dill) - but the base recipe would stand on it's own. Will definitely make again and share. They have an amazing taste...must be the wine!

GLUTEN FREE VERSION. I've used Diamond ranch flavored crackers, or GLUTEN FREE panko crumbs, omitted salts,  added celery diced.  And even swapped 1/2 the crab with minced clams! Delish!

These are super easy to make and taste delicious. With the left overs that didn't fit into my mushroom caps........I made a crab cake out of it and fried it in butter......OMG good! I might just use this recipe to make up some crab cakes. Definitely give them a try.

I made these for a gathering of ladies...I modified slightly by add ing the garlic that was recommended, and I also added a little of Old Bay's seasoning, as I didn't have dill...I also used almond flour instead of the bread crumbs (maybe ? C instead of Â½ C) to keep it Keto...They were delicious , and got rave reviews...It's a nice, easy, tasty appetizer that could be modified to Keto.

Followed the original recipe but I didn't use dill, added a few drops of hot sauce and used canned crab meat.  My husband loved it and asked that I make it again, which he never does!

I followed this exactly. Actually I forgot to add the bread crumbs but thatâ€™s not what makes this just a so so dish. Maybe I didnâ€™t buy an expensive enough crab, the mushrooms were too juicy after being baked, the crab flavor was a bit stronger than I anticipated. Maybe I just donâ€™t have a crab stuffed mushroom loving crowd. Over half of them were left and I had to throw the rest away. Maybe I will give it another try another time.

I barely got to eat any of these when I served them for a Xmas eve open house. They were very good. I made them exactly as written. I will definitely make them again, but I think I would add a little something extra for flavour. The crab is good, paired nicely with the dill, and I used panko for the crumbs, but maybe a seasoned jack or a seasoned panko would give it a little extra something. Still, very easy to make and they were gobbled up, so definitely making this again!

I used portobello mushrooms, and canned crab however I didn't have any eggs so I had to omit it. I just baked them for half the amount of time. They were so good my husband thought there was sausage in them. I may just omit the egg purposely next time.

Although very good because I love mushrooms, you couldn't taste the crab.  Next time I'd get a better grade of crab and forgo the canned in water version.

Made these 2 days ahead...popped them into oven and they turned out as a crowd pleaser.  Have enough stuffing left over, which I froze, for another batch.  On my list of favourite appetizers.

I was surprised how good these were.  Iâ€™m used to making stuffed mushrooms with breadcrumbs, chopped mushrooms, butter, and sherry.  These were so much easier. No need to core the mushrooms and very tasty.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Will be making them often.

Ugh!  Tasteless.  I used bay shrimp instead of crab, so expected some taste difference, but they were bland and had no flavor.  I had wondered where the flavor pop would come from, with only green onions, crab, bread crumbs, Mont. Jack, etc.  I chopped the stems and sauteed them with the green onions (and used more  than called for--but still could not taste them.  I topped half with Monterey Jack and half with parm-regg, and the parm was definitely better.  But no flavor to speak of!

Used imitation crab and it was a bit underwhelming. Prep was awkward when stuffing the mushrooms but it turned out okay. Ended up making way more stuffing than I had mushrooms for so I can make it again, though I expect it'll go good on crackers.

I will make this again for sure. I did tweak the recipe a bit. Left out the wine. Only had Colby jack cheese. didnâ€™t measure anything  just winged it. Had some snow crab legs leftover from a previous meal and used the meat from them. They were very savory and rich and delicious!

I was disappointed with the results as written.  The flavor was blah.  There was a distinct lack of "pop".  Fortunately I had prepared horseradish sauce for the prime rib which gave the 'shrooms the oomph they needed.  Next time I make them I will add either dijon mustard to the stuffing or some heat (wasabi sandwich dressing)

I followed this recipe exactly as written. And I would have to say that they were pretty good. Next time I will add a little more salt and pepper and more garlic.  That being said, they disappeared quickly.

Added a couple spices that we like but no major changes. Will definitely make this again.

These looked so delicious and easy so I decided to give them a try.  The presentation was priceless and I was so proud when I presented the dish to my husband.  But, they were very bland and tasteless.  The only thing that really stood out was the crabmeat and the butter.  So disappointing.  Will not be making them again.   I also added some garlic to the onion and butter at the beginning and some chopped spinach.  My son in law liked them, but he likes bland food.  I would say that if I made them again, I would certainly do something that would add more flavor.

I make these every year for Christmas and other special events with only a couple modifications.  We skip the dill since it's not a favorite herb in our home (sometimes I swap it for tarragon); I sometimes use chopped shallots instead of green onion; and as another poster mentioned, I add the chopped mushroom stems when sautÃ©ing for extra flavor. To keep it healthier I use much less than 1/2 cup butter before stuffing them, but otherwise the recipe is a winner.  Don't skip the step of pouring some white wine in the pan while the mushrooms are baking--it makes all the difference in the flavor!

I've made these several times several ways and family and friends loved them. I've made them for myself because they're a good all day snack or meal when you're busy.

Can you prepare this before hand and reheat when guests arrive? It sounds delicious.

Delicious and easy to prepare. I used 9 big white mushrooms from Costco and had just enough filling left over for an omelet.

This recipe makes a great addition to the one I already used.  The white wine and cheese were an addition I hadn't though of yet.  Delicious!!
