I doubled the amount of ranch per butter for under the skin, and increased the sprinkled butter over top some, but not a lot.   I did this because another reviewer said that they could not taste the ranch.   With my increases, the taste of the ranch was faint and I felt it more increased the saltiness, which was not really desired.   However, the overall taste of this turkey breast was wonderful and the breast was juicy.   I would not increase the ranch over what this recipe calls for again.   I have to admit that half-way through the cooking procedure I was a bit skeptical.   It really didn't smell that great.   But when the time was right, the flavor was there.    However, I wouldn't quite rate this 4 stars, but more like 4.6 or so, just enough to tip it to 5.   A turkey, slow cooked looks pale, mushy and unappealing.   Add bacon and it looks worse.   After it was fully cooked, I put this under the broiler to brown up just a bit.   I feel this recipe needs that extra step.   Don't expect a big ranch flavor with this recipe because you won't find it.   But you will find a nice balanced flavor that yields a tender juicy bird.

I used a fryer instead of turkey breast.  I also didn't put it in the slow cooker, but baked it for 6 hours at 250.  The kids loved it!

I used bone-in chicken thighs (4 total) in the slow cooker. It smelled delicious, so I was super excited.  The chicken was moist and tender, but I only gave it three stars because I could barely taste the ranch seasoning, which was kind of a bummer.

It is moist, I'll give you that, but the bacon and ranch dressing mix did not help
