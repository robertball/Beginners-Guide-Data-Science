I made for a party and everyone really enjoyed - the entire salad was gone!  To alievate any "mushiness", I drained the oranges on a paper towel as well.

I have made this several times now for group dinners and it has been deemed "excellent" each time.  My husband and I decided that it was a bit too sweet with the rasberry dressing so we substitute baslamic vinagrette-yum!  This salad does not save well-the leftovers are mushy and wilted.  But, there may not be many leftovers, as it is so delicious!

This salad was absolutely delicious and so pretty to look at! The flavor was so tasty, not too sweet, but different and good and it was eaten by all age groups. I did drain the oranges on a paper towel before placing in salad. I also only used half the amount of dressing and it was perfect! I will add this to my rotation of salads. Thanks for a new recipe, Carol!

I got so many compliments on this salad from my family.  The health nuts and non-health nuts enjoyed it.  It was truly something for everyone.  I am making it again at Christmas.

I can't say enough about this salad. It is my all-time favorite. I love every ingredient and to put them all together is the perfect meal for me. My daughter and I like to use Raspberry Walnut Vinaigrette. I have had this for lunch 3 days this week! We are adding this salad to our Thanksgiving menu this year. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was not so great; it became very mushy quickly and was not anything extraordinary taste-wise.  I thought with all of the different flavors - apples, walnuts, cheese - it would be yummy, but I will not make again.

Liked almost everything except the pink dressing. Too pink! Not appetizing, and it was my own fault.  I opted for Raspberry Pomegranate (Ken's Steak House brand) and it was just too dang bright! Next time, I'll go with a balsamic vinaigrette, which I think works fine with fruit, a nice contrast. I subbed feta for the cheddar and added sunflower seeds and a few rice noodles for crunch. But really, it was the dressing that I liked least. Not at all appetizing to look at. Pink pink pink!!

I made this salad at Christmas and my whole family loved it!  It was dubbed as "elegant" by my father.

Excellent! Made for Christmas Eve dinner and everyone loved it, and I even forgot the cheddar cheese.

Really fresh! A great salad for a hot day. I had it with BBQ beef and went really well together.

This was good and I will make it again. I would, however, recommend the dressing be served on the side as any leftovers won't last otherwise.
