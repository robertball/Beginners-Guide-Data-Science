I would increase the half and half a bit more to give it a bit creamier texture.  I left the skin on and mixed it partially to leave chunks, which were appreciated by all.

Made as written and these turned out great! I struggle with mashed potatoes as they tend to get gluey but not these. The texture was perfect.

Excellent recipe!  The taste and consistency were great and looked attractive in the casserole dish. Also leftovers heated well the next day.
