I only let it cool 15 minutes before adding the chocolate chips and they started to melt, so I just kept tossing mixture until everything was coated in chocolate....mmmmm

This recipe is very versatile. You can make many changes, and it still turns out great. I made it for a morning Bible study group, so I didn't want it too sweet at breakfast time. I doubled the recipe, only used Chex and Honey Nut O's for cereal, only used peanuts for nuts, used half of the brown sugar, half the white chocolate chips, half the nutmeg and ginger, and increased the cinnamon by 50%. My husband and I both thinks it's great. He said it's addicting, so I better seal it so I have enough to take Monday.

Extremely good!  I made it with honey nut chex, kix cereal, walnuts, pecans, plain animal crackers.  Doubled the sauce.
