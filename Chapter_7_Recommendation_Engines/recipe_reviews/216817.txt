Wonderful sandwich that's quick, easy and delicious! I used a loaf of Italian breaf. I toasted the bread in the broiler first, salted the tomatoes in order to get the water out of them and added a little cracked black pepper. I didn't bother putting this in the oven but enjoyed this with just the bread being toasted. I cut in into sections and wow - excellent without a ton of effort!

We have eating a version of this a long time.  But first, toast bread and rub raw garlic on it while it is still warm.  1/2   Cheese goes on bread first, then tomato, rest of cheese, then basil.  Yum!!!

Great sandwich. Fresh ingredients - use ripe pomodori - and you'd never know the bread was a leftover.

This sandwich was pretty good, but I used sun dried tomatoes packed in olive oil for more depth of flavor, and only used one-half tablespoon of olive oil after that. Overall, a good classic. :)

I just love tomato and cheese sandwiches.  Didn't have a whole tomato so I cut up a handful of salad/grape tomatoes to cover a piece of whole wheat bread.  Used shredded mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, 1/4 tsp each of EVOO and balsamic vinegar.  This is so light and heavenly.  These would also be great with a slice of provel cheese.  I will be making these again and again for sure!

Delicious and refreshing dish.  The only thing I would do differently is maybe chop up the fresh basil to be sprinkled and used sparingly.  I love Basil but this is a strong dose of it as a whole leaf on a sandwich.

I LOVE this combination....!  But of course, you have to work with what you have.  I only had the garlic Texas Toast (thats in the frozen food area) - so this is a MUST from now on - you MUST try it with the garlic Texas Toast guys!!  Oh, and make sure you toast it in the oven 1st, then flip it over to put the fresh tomato (I sprinkled basil on the tomato) and mozzarella cheese on it - then back in the oven so it can melt good.  I loved the drizzle of balsamic dressing to top it off!  THANKS FOR MAKING MY MIDNIGHT SNACK A HIT!!

My family loved this easy to make meal.  I was worried the bread would be soggy from the tomato but is wasn't.  I highly recommend for a quick and elegant meal.

This was soooo tasty and light! My children loved it as well. I chopped my basil instead and didnt use olive oil because I used a balsamic vinegar that was made with olive oil.

I made this two ways. Half as the recipe is written, and half with a piece of prosciutto tucked in there. My boyfriend couldn't have loved the prosciutto version more,  and he is NEVER excited about food. I did end up baking everything about 11 minutes and then broiling for about 3 minutes. I have to say it was fantastic.

More please!  What a simple, fast from start to finish, delicious snack!  I made mine on crostini and nuked it, making it especially speedy, and a chiffonade of basil made it especially pretty.  No balsamic vinegar for me, thank you very much. I like my "Caprese-style" with a drizzle of olive oil only.

These are exceptional.  So tasty with fresh tomato out of the garden.  We enjoyed them as an appetizer.  Can't wait to have some more!

Simple, delicious and made with tomatoes and basil from my garden made them oh-so-fresh! We ate these with asparagus soup for a light dinner one night. Even my kids enjoyed them, which I found odd since they cringe at any sort of "leaf" in their food! Thanks for sharing!

Kinda bland.  Used a basil leaf.  1st bite pulled the entire leaf from the sandwich.  Next time I will chop up the leaf.

Super yummy -- next time, I will toast the bread a bit first after putting some olive oil and balsamic on it, then top it with the tomatoes and mozzarella.  The fresh basil leaves which really adds to the flavor profile.

This was good.  However, I think I prefer the tomato, basil, mozzarella, oil & vinegar as a salad with a slice of Italian bread on the side.  This way it saves heating the oven as well.

Amazing! My family loves this combination of ingredients but I've usually made it as an appetizer, without heating it. As a heated sandwich - this is definitely a new favorite of ours! Thank you!

This was good!  My reasoning though for only 4 stars is because the tomato put directly on the bread made for soggy bread...even when toasted.  Luckily I used a nice hearty piece or it would have been inedible.  I would say mozzarella first.  Flavor was great though!

It was bland to us. I used grape tomato, mozzarella, and chopped basil. I might use pesto on it next time or something to up the flavor. Still good but needs that extra umph!

Yes, I'll make it again.  I used a baguette size loaf of bread and made it an appetizer to go with our Italian dinner.  I did add garlic by scraping a bud over the toasted bread.  Since my bread was small I chopped the tomatoes.  It was a big hit.  Thanks

What a great blend of flavors.  Our market was out of fresh basil, so I used fresh tarragon, and it was delicious.  I took suggestions from other reviewers:  toasted the bread, doubled the cheese, and added prosciutto.  Don't forget to drizzle  the olive oil and balsamic vinegar... that is what transforms this from good to great!

After seeing Deb C's picture and review, I thought this would go great with the lasagna we had for dinner tonight.  I had 3 slices of garlic bread in the freezer to use up.  I proceeded with the recipe using the garlic bread.  It was delicious.  I really liked the flavor that the little bit of balsamic vinegar added.  Since I used the garlic bread, I omitted the olive oil.  Served this with 'Grandma's Best Ever Sour Cream Lasagna' and 'Easy Fried Eggplant' both from AR.

I sliced up a baguette and toasted it before adding the other ingredients.  It came out wonderfully.  Simple, tasty, and appealing – how can you beat it?

I absolutely loved this, and so did my guest. I didn't use the olive oil, and used Italian bread. My family did not like it at all, but they're weird.

This was pretty good, although a little bland.  If I make it again, I'll broil it for a while to add a bit of taste.

Really good. I toasted the bread with butter and minced garlic first to prevent it from being soggy. After reading other reviews, I opted to layer the cheese first, then basil, then tomatoes. I used a combination of monterey jack and mozzarella for more flavour and I skipped the olive oil and drizzled it with reduced balsamic vinegar. Delicious!

Awesome.  I rubbed a raw garlic on a pita then assembled.  A definite keeper.
