I made this for the Super Bowl and it was a major hit.  I made a variation that worked out well.  I combined all of the ingredients except the hot sauce.  Then I divided it into four and added a different hot sauce, ranging from Roasted Garlic to INSANITY, to each one.  I then made four mini balls.  That way, I had a cheese ball for everyone's taste.  If you do this, note that you will need more pecans.  Maybe a cup.  Also, make sure you keep track of which ball has which hot sauce.  I labeled mine, both on the baggie in the fridge and on the platter.

Since I didn't have any crackers handy, I decided to make a dip instead of a cheese ball.  I used 6 oz. cream cheese and added a cup of sour cream.  I also added a little extra of the celery and onion (maybe 1 tbsp. each?).  If you like more blue cheese, you could add it.  The "dip" was fantastic!  Several asked for the recipe!

This is delicious.  I wanted to make something interesting for Christmas and ended up making more for New Years.  My children, who love blue cheese yet don't like onions, found it irresistable.  I never had time to put pecans on it, did not matter.  I also tried more spice on the second batch and found it just as appealing.  TRY THIS for something new and delicious!

This was the second cheese ball I ever made and it was really good.  I formed it into the shape of a baseball (for my son's birthday party) and used some pepperoni for the laces.  I was a real "home run" with my guests.  Man that was cheesy.

I thought this recipe was a little bland as written.  I thought all of the flavors needed to be stronger. I could not taste the cayenne or hot sauce at all, so I increased to at least 1/4 tsp of cayenne and 10-15 drops of Cholula hot sauce.  Next time, I would probably add 1-2 more TBS of celery and onion, too, for more texture.

I've made this twice in the last two weeks to rave reviews.  I used 4 ounces of blue cheese (the Danish Rosenberg Mellow Blue kind)and I used red onion instead of cooking onion and added a few more dashes of Frank's Red Hot Sauce and a generous pinch of cayenne.  I have used both chopped pecans and walnuts successfully.

I served this with fresh grapes and crackers.  It was excellent and at the end of the evening there was nothing left.  Since that evening friends have call to ask for the recipe.  I would recommend this to anyone.

Made this within 2hrs of needing to serve it. Put in the freezer to speed up firming process. The guests really liked it. Would use less onion next time and a dash more hot pepper. The minimal leftovers tasted great the next day. Will make again.

There are few things I like better than a good cheese ball.  This one did not disappoint- plus it was a great change from the dried beef-green onion one I usually make.  Using the advice of previous reviews I added more onions and celery. I doubled the cayenne pepper, added a little salt and added a dash of celery salt.   I used 4 ounces of bleu cheese because I really like the flavor.  Do not skip the pecans.  I got a lot of compliments on this-- even from a person who doesn't like bleu cheese.

This recipe is awesome! made last night and doubled the recipe. Only thing i did diffrent was add some galic salt.I also par melted the cheese in the micro so i could blend it easier.If you melt in micro, you will need to refrigerate and form it several times before it will hold its shape.

Our family loves cheeseballs and this is one of the best we've tried.  I used reduced fat blue cheese and reduced fat cream cheese and you can't even tell.  I was out of tabasco so I used about 8 drops of chili sauce and left out the cayenne pepper.

This is great with crackers but goes well with celery and other veggies too!

I really love this recipe. I made this last night for Thanksgiving and even though turkey day isn't for another two days, I HAD to taste it and it is really good. The only changes I made were to use Neufchâtel and add more Tabasco. Using Neufchâtel made the mixture softer but that was easily resolved with the overnight chill.

this is a wonderful and simple recipe. I needed to bring a cheese plate to a Halloween party, so I prepared the cheese exactly as mentioned except I added 2 drops of blue food coloring (for effect)then I rolled the chilled cheese log in Black sesame seeds instead of nuts and served it with a darker colored cracker. It was great looking and perfect for the occasion. It was a rave and gone almost within the first 15 minutes of the party.

I made this for a dinner party and it was a huge hit. I did not have any tabasco or celery so that was not added but I did add in some parsely and garlic and coated with dry roasted almond chunks. So yummy!

Great Idea but needs more blue cheese flavor. I would probably double the blue cheese amount and then add additional spices. I expected it to have that blue cheese tang, which it didn't. The pecans were a nice touch. I mixed those in with the cheese ball as well. I would make this again but add more blue cheese.

After reading some of the other reviews, I planned ahead for adjustments. However, I did make this cheese ball as written so I could judge for myself. I agree it is a bit bland as written so my ingredients measured as follows: 8 oz cream cheese, 4 1/2 oz bleu cheese crumbles,2 heaping Tablespoons EACH of celery & sweet Valencia onion finely chopped, 5 drops Tabasco pepper sauce, 1/4 teaspoon ground red cayenne pepper, 1/4 teaspoon each of onion powder & garlic powder. Blended all ingredients till smooth and creamy, then placed in the refrigerator to chill for 6 hrs. Shaped it into a ball and covered again! Covered the cheese ball with diced pecans and ate with crackers.  THIS RECIPE IS EXCELLENT & the added Bleu cheese really is a huge hit for the Bleu cheese lovers! Thank you so much for sharing your recipe. Anyone making this for the first time really should make as written & then decide for themselves to tweak or not to tweak to their palate. :)  Definitely will make again ... soon!!!

I was surprised with a solid 5 stars that this wasn't better tasting.  I could barely taste the blue cheese (and I used all 4 oz.) and I couldn't taste the hot sauce/cayenne at all (and I sprinkled generously).  I think this recipe has potential but next time would add even more blue cheese and more hot sauce.  Hmmm...I wonder if a touch of chunky blue cheese salad dressing would do the trick!

Why is this called a Roquefort Cheese Ball when you use Blue Cheese 1 star for the recipe as is 5 stars if you use Roquefort( NO celery grated carrots instead)

Using ground smoked almonds instead of pecans is excellent as well...great crunch and smoky flavor matches well with the strong roquefort flavor.

Followed the recipe exactly.  It was fantastic, the entire cheese ball got eaten in just a couple hours.

Okay I made this bad boy! Matter of fact I doubled the recipe and added the following. 1/2 cup of Cabot Extra Sharp white cheddar. 1/2 cup Tillamook Sharp Yellow Cheddar. Frank’s Red hot wing sauce. Crushed black pepper, crushed Red Pepper and crushed bacon bits. Thanks Ruth for the great recipe

I make this recipe, exactly as stated, every year at the holidays.  I finely chop the pecans, so it looks a little different than the picture.  I double the recipe because otherwise it would be gone in an instant.  Serve with Triscuits or celery for dipping.... so good!

I despise blue cheese AND cream cheese but made this for my hubby who loves them both. Read the reviews and my blue cheese crumbles come in a 5 ounce container and so I used it all. He loved it but the spiciness got lost or so he said. Next time I will double the cayenne and hot pepper sauce.

If you are a fan of blue cheese I think you will like this.  I followed the recipe but added some chopped green olives.
