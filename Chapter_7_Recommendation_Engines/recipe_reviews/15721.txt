This is one of the best cakes I have ever tasted.  I changed it just a little bit by adding 1/4 cup of olive oil (I don't use the extra virgin because the taste is a bit strong, but it also works).  I also used half the cinnamon just because my husband is not crazy about it, but in the end I could still taste the cinnamon at just the right level.  Instead of folding the walnuts in I sprinkled them over the top for presentation purposes only and it came out lovely.  I shared the cake with relatives and then had to turn over this recipe shortly after.  Thanks for sharing it with us!!

This cake is wonderful at breakfast or as a snack. I knew the apples I was using would stay firm and not give off a lot of moiture, so I added 1/2 cup of plain yogurt to the batter. It was moist but not soggy. The amount of sugar is perfect, and the same for the cinnamon. I didn't have the specified size pan, so I used a 10.5" cast iron pan without any problem. I love the glossy, deep golden color of this cake. It's old-fashioned in the best sense of the phrase. I wish I could tell you what it was like after being refrigerated, but it disappeared while it was still war,!

Although the flavor of this cake is good, it is very dry.  The fresh apples add some moisture to the dry ingredients, but next time will add 3/4 Cup of buttermilk to the butter and sugar.

Everyone loved this cake! All I changed about this recipe is that I added 1/4 cup of applesauce and the moisture in the cake was perfect. My family is begging me to make another one!

I think this deserves higher than 5 star. In less than 5 days I have made 3 of these cakes and I had to use my bundt cake pan, but they are beautiful and oh so delicious. This is a real KEEPER for me.

I grated the peeled apple into the mixture and that really helped the texture and made it a bit more moist. It is an extremely flavoursome cake, and I baked mine with walnut halves on the top to mark out the slices. Delicious!

I was surprised I liked this cake so much, and that it came out as well as it did.  A note: the cake batter is very thick and it almost comes out like brownie batter. When the cake bakes it's more like a coffee cake. It's very good though.  Hope the info helped.

My 3 year old grandson and I baked this wonderful cake today. I changed it up just a smigeon, my kids like it spicy. I added a pinch of nutmeg and allspice. I also followed anothers suggestion and added 1/2 cup of yogurt for moistness. It turned out wonderful! I am going to make this one again and again. A keeper for sure!

This recipe needs tweaking, but can come out very good. I doubled the recipe and used it for muffins instead. Instead of 2 cups apples, I used 2 large Granny Smith apples. It does come out TOO dry, so I added about 1/4th cup apple sauce. The resulting muffins were moist, and even better apple flavor. Great place to start, would be great with vanilla ice cream fresh out of the oven! Didn't need quite 45 min in the muffin tins, about 40. I omitted the walnuts.

It was good, but definitely needs some kind of liquid added to it--it was more like cookie dough than cake batter.

I wanted to use up some apples but did not want apple pie.  This was a great find. I made a recipe and a half because I used a 9x13 glass baking dish (didn't have cast iron anything). I added 1/4 cup buttermilk as others suggested and sprinkled cinnamon sugar over the batter before baking.  I eyeballed the apples so I may have used more then called for in the recipe. I baked it about 50 minutes and I covered it with foil the last 10 minutes so it wouldn't over brown.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for a great recipe !

I baked this deliciously, moist cake for all of the ladies at Game Day this week (except me, all of the ladies are above 70!!) and I was told it would be standard fare at all of Game Days.  My husband attended this event and he is an "apple" person.  Roses, roses, roses for this recipe!!

Husband LOVED it and he is my worsted critic.  I was a little concerned with the batter consistancy at first - it looked like a 'crumble type' topping.  Boy, was I glad I went ahead and baked it.   This summer I will be baking this outside in the grill when it is too hot to bake indoors.

EXCELLENT! This recipe is quick and tasty. I followed the directions, but may have had a few more that 2 cups of apples. My cake turned out very moist. I will definitely make this gain!

I made a few revisions to keep the cake healthy and incorporate more moisture.  It turned into a very moist, scrumptious cake!  I didn't have all-purpose flour, so I did 1 cup of brown rice flour with 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour.  I halved the sugar and added 1/4 cup honey with two eggs because I had some rather small eggs.  I added a teaspoon or so of nutmeg and 1/2 a cup of unsweetened applesauce.  I didn't measure out my apples, but it looks like I ended up with about three cups instead of two.  My cake was done in 30 minutes and the texture was anything but dry!  I cut the apples up in very small slices, so this probably helped them soften with the shorter bake time.

Delicious cake. Fall is upon us, craving something like an easy snack cake. I was concerned about it being dry (thank you, Reta Forbes!) so I added a capful of vegetable oil into the mix. Thanks to msthomas for addressing my concerns of batter thickness: I thought I missed an ingredient, very much like brownie batter. The little bit of vegetable oil made it super-moist, and you can add about a half-cup more apples, too. Reading these reviews before baking helped. It came out perfect!

I really liked this.  I took advice of others and added a scant 1/2 cup of applesauce and I'm glad I did - I usually make recipe exactly as given, but in this case I just happened to have some left-over sauce I needed to get rid of, so I threw it in.  One Gala apple finely chopped gave me 2 cups - - - served with whipped cream which gave it just the right amount of sweetness/moistness.  Thank you so much for recipe :) - UPDATE:  Increasing to 5*. day after my review, we went back that nite and had another piece.  SO MUCH BETTER after having sat for a day! The moisture from the apples & applesauce turned this into an incredibly rich and moist delight!  Am so pleased :)

Ooooooohhhh so delicious!  This cake is moist and flavorful.  A most enjoyable way to appreciate the bounty of my apple tree.  I absolutely love this and will make it often.

This was a great cake!  I had some Apples that I needed to use, and this was a great way to use them!  I baked mine in a regular cake pan instead of a cast iron skillet, and it came out great.  I also didn't put any nuts in it, and added a little extra apples.  I topped the cake with cream cheese frosting, and we couldn't stop eating it!  You could also make muffins or cupcakes out of this recipe.

This is fantastic! I made half the batch in a small cast-iron skillet and poured the rest into a cake pan. They both turned out great and all of it was devoured by various family members within 24 hours! The only change I made was to leave the apple peel on. No reason to peel it off!

I've made this a dozen times now. everyone loves it. I  usually add 1/4 cup of plain yougurt or apple sauce to give it moisture. i use honey crisp apples so they don't release as much moisture as the delicious apples. I  love this cake with chai tea or coffee. it's just delicious. thank you

I should have read the reviews first.  I would have added applesauce or yogurt as  others suggested.  The batter was very thick.   It was still a delicious apple cake and will definitely make again.   I liked the idea of using the cast iron skillet.

Very good! I followed the advice of others and added 1/2 c. yogurt.  Has a big cinnamon taste, so if you don't like that I would suggest using less.  It's wonderful for breakfast as it is similar in texture to a coffee cake.

Having made three of these in the past 24 hours, I've got to say, this is an excellent cake! Not too sweet and very flavorful. I took the suggestion of other reviewers and added a 1/4 cup of apple sauce to the batter. I forgot to peel the apples on one, but it still turned out very nice. In my apartment sized oven, 30 minutes at 350 degrees was plenty.  Thanks for this great recipe!

I usually bake with honey instead of sugar, so in addition to honey I added a bit of cream and milk and it came out pretty well (since the prev. reviewers complained that it was too dry). I think the amount of cinnamon called for is a bit much. I used only 1 tsp of cinnamon.

If made, as written, this recipe does not work. I made it as written and I had a fine, crumbly mixture that resembled wet sand. I then added an individual applesauce cup that lucky I had on hand and it finally came together as a cake-like mixture consistency. It tasted fine, but was on the drier side. SO 1 star as written, the recipe does not work. With adjustments 3-4/5 stars.

Great cake. Easy way to use up apples. I added a snack pack sized apple sauce just to make sure super moist. Will try adding lemon glaze after it cools.

I added 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce, as many had suggested, and about 1/2 cup of raisins to the mix.  Those were the only changes.  This recipe is easy, easy, easy and the results are a flavorful, moist, and addictive apple cake.  I have many apple cake recipes but this one will become my go-to if I'm looking for a sheet pan style cake.  I baked it in an 8" or 9" square baking pan.

I have a 12" cast iron pan, so I doubled everything  and it worked out great!  Family loves the fact that I replaced 1/2 of the flour with whole wheat-they consider this a breakfast food instead of a dessert.

This is a delicious and moist version. I used cinnamon and allspice instead simply because I preferred these spices with the apples. I also used brown sugar instead of white. I think it was better with the brown sugar.

I used fake sugar since my hubby is diabetic. I baked it in the iron skillet that I love. It turned out moist and delicious. I added walnuts, two very ripe bananas and used 1/4 cup applesauce.  He loves it.

This is a good recipe with just a little tweaks. I made it in an 8" square pan instead of cast iron. Don't own one. I read all of the reviews before making it so what I did was add 1/4 cup of raspberry yogurt  and about a quarter teaspoon of allspice. It was delicious. The library where I work is having a bake sale this weekend and I am donating 2 pans.

This apple cake turned out very moist and tasty.  Made in my new cast iron skillet.  I did add an extra half cup of diced apples, other than that followed recipe.  Will definitely make again.

Great recipe! I added a tiny bit of water because it seemed a bit dry.    It was fun to cook cake in my skillet. Thanks for the recipe!

Used a little less sugar.  Next time add 1/4 C applesauce  for added moisture.

It just didn't  have the flavor or texture that I expected. I added some buttermilk and roughly chopped the apples (with peel) in the cuisinart. I baked it in my favorite cast iron pan. It baked beautifully and looked great but something was missing.

This has to be the greatest thing since slice bread. It's soooo good and easy, for  those of you that are afraid to try something new, trust me,an orangutan can pull this off lol. The only thing I added was raisins. When it was done, I made a few slits in the crust while the skillet was still very hot, being from Maine, I had to drizzle maple syrup all over the top, you could hear it sizzling. At home, they call me (Chef-Boyar-Zippy ;)

The battter was all crumbles so I added 1/2 cup milk and that was perfect. Also shredded apples to give more moisture. It's baking as I write and I expect it to be perfect! Also sprinkled mixture of cinnamon and brown sugar on top!

While mixing the batter I found it was very crumbly and wouldn't have worked at all so I added milk until it resembled a very thick batter. The cake cooked much faster than the 45 minutes indicated. The end result was not too bad but I think I will be deleting this one from my recipe box.
