I made this for my family this Thanksgiving weekend and I think I'd give it 5 stars with a few changes, but 4 as is.  Definitely increase the bacon to 1 pound or more, I used 1 pound and it didn't seem like quite enough bacon flavor.  Also, next time I'd double the onions and saute green/red peppers as well.  It needs more flavor.  Following others, I increased to 14 eggs and I used 2-1/4 cup milk.  I cubed the bagels, it was too difficult to slice thin and used "The Works" (everything) bagels.  I also doubled the cheese, but I think it would have been good to put one cup between layers and a 1/2 to 1 cup on top.  The parsley didn't do much for the dish, but some added spices would be great.  Needed a little more pepper and I'd add a small amount of salt if your diet allows or let everybody do their own at the table.  All in all, this was easy and very good, it just needed some modifications and more seasoning.  I think we'll try it with diced ham next time.  It is a keeper.

This was awesome!! I tore the bagel's into bite size pieces so that it would be easier to cut.  I then sprayed some butter spray on the bagel-bites and I then lightly toasted them in the oven under the broiler.  I thought it seemed like them may end of soggy.  I also doubled up on the bacon after making it with the called for amount and it looked like not enough. I put a little extra cheddar after the final layer and it looked beautiful. This recipe had everyone calling for the recipe!!  I can't wait to make it again and add some tomatoes, bell peppers and whatever other vege's are in the fridge.

This is good tasting, but took a little longer to prepare the night before than I had thought. Also fitting the dish in the fridge overnight can be a problem for some. One problem I noted was the toughness of the top layer of bagel slices. It's a nice idea, but they came out very hard and tough, requiring a knife to eat. You need to either leave off the top bagel layer or make a larger amount of the egg filling so the top bagels are completely covered.

I have made this several times and it always turns out great, the bagels are never mushy.  I use 14 eggs, 2 1/4 cups of milk, and 1 whole lb of bacon.  I add 1 cup shredded cheese, salt, pepper, 1 tsp mustard powder, and 1 tsp onion powder(because I don't feel like chopping and cooking an onion) to the egg mix.  Then I tear the bagels up into pieces and let them sit in the egg mix for about 1/2 hour while I'm cooking the bacon with the "Bacon for a family or crowd" recipe.  I use scissors to cut the bacon into pieces and mix it into the egg mix.  I spray a 9x13 with cooking oil spray and pour the whole bowl in.  I top it with some parm cheese and another cup of shredded cheddar.  I top it with aluminum foil and cook for 30 minutes, then I take the foil off and cook it another 20 minutes.  It turns out puffy and beautiful.  This is my favorite breakfast casserole, and I've tried MANY.

This recipe is wonderful!  I made this for my husband's family Christmas morning and it was a big hit.  I did make some changes after reading other reviews.  I used everything bagels (chopped), used turkey bacon, added 2 extra eggs, added an extra 1/2 cup of milk and omitted the parm cheese (just used extra cheddar).  Also baked at 375 for 40 minutes.  I will definitely make this again and again!

I made this recipe for a brunch with my Moms group and it was a big hit (even the kids liked it!)  The only things I did differently were I ended up using a smaller pan (which meant thicker layers, so I had to cook it a little longer 45min.), and I covered the casserole during the first 15/20 minutes.  Then I uncovered it for the remaining baking time.  The top layer didn't get burned or wasn't tough and everything cooked through nicely. Lastly, I used turkey bacon instead of regular bacon. This recipe is a keeper and I will definitely be making this dish again!!!

I made an 8x8 version to feed 4.  I sauted the onions seperate because they just burned with the bacon and were all greasy.  I used plain bagels and they worked great.  This dish was picture perfect and the tops of the bagels were golden at exactly 30 mins.  

8x8 version:
6 slices of bacon, diced;
1/4 cup chopped onion;
2 plain bagels (sliced into 8 pieces, 4 placed on bottom and 4 on top);
1/2 cup shredded sharp Cheddar cheese;
5 eggs, beaten (could use 4 eggs);
1 cup milk;
1-2 teaspoons chopped fresh parsley;
pinch of pepper;
2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese.

My family enjoyed this recipe.  I added 2 extra eggs, left out the onion, and added extra cheese to the top towards the end of baking.  I also added the crumbled bacon on top at the end of baking (we like the bacon crisp.) When I cooked bacon inside the casserole, I notice it gets chewy. I cooked it at 350 for 45 minutes...it came out perfect!

Ok I am the minority on this one.  Neither the hubby or myself liked this one.  It was very inexpensive...which is the reason I wanted to try this.  The onion was overpowering and it just didn't do much for us.  I know we would much rather just have some eggs and a bagel.  Thanks for the post anyway.

I served this when we had a houseful of guests... they LOVED it!  I did add an extra egg or two, as some have suggested and it worked well.  I will say though, that any leftovers heated up the next day, are not as good!

I used "Everything" bagels and cubed them and also added a green pepper. Everyone liked it and my dad even asked me for the recipe! Next time, I will make it in a muffin pan so I can easily freeze individual portions.

I wasnt able to get any of this before it was consumed!  But others had given it rave reviews! I made a few changes.  I had used mini bagels- about five, and also cut down the amount of eggs to about 9-10. I used a metal calphalon 9x13 pan.  I cut up the bacon into peices before cooking it and added it in pan with onion.  I also put some cheese on top of last layer of bagels. Was not too dry or hard on top!

This is good, basic egg casserole recipe.  Definitely add an extra egg or two to make sure the top layer of bagels is covered with the egg mixture.  Variations on this recipe are endless, leave it simple for the kids, or go crazy for the adults.

I too increased the eggs, skipped the parsley and parm cheese and added extra cheddar.  I also used pre-sliced bagel "chips" (day olds that the bakery slices up) and it came out good.  Even though the top layer was covered in egg it still came out tough.  Overall pretty good and I'll likely try it again.

Very good!  I did not refrigerate this at all I just threw it together in the morning and had brunch with it.  I think it did fine that way!  It did seem to take a little longer though, not sure why?!  Great flavor though, thanks!

This was a very good recipe not using bread.  I used the thin bagels and did like many said, cut them into cubes.  I will make this again and again.

We did vary the recipe a little. We added way more bacon and ham, but i didnt let it sit over night. It was a favorite!

This was SOOO good.... you get a much better result using bagels as opposed to bread as with other  brunch casseroles.  Some slight adjustments (or at least I thought they were slight adjustments....:)   Like other readers, I also toasted and chopped the bagels, scattered them onto the bottom of the pan.  Whisked the eggs and milk together with everything else, including the cheddar cheese, pouring over the bagels.  I used 'everything' flavoured bagels, a good cup of chopped ham (slightly browned) rather than bacon and omitted the parmesan.  The best adjustment / surprise however, was the sprinkling over the top of sliced canned jalapenos (about 1/2 cup) - that really tied it all together.  Served with salsa and sour cream.  It puffed up and browned beautifully.  Everyone loved it.

I'm not a great cook but this recipe turned out terrific, even with changing it to lighten it up.  I used turkey bacon fried extra crisp, egg beaters, and a combination of low fat cheese and fat free cheese.  I also baked it 45 min at 350 the night I made it, and it microwaved beautifully for several days.

This is a wonderful make-ahead breakfast casserole that is super easy as well as delicious. My 14-year-old son loved it, as did my husband and I. I did make one substitution - I substituted chopped ham for the bacon. This is a very eye-appealing dish that I would not hesitate to make for guests or to take to the office for brunch. I would warn, though, to be very, very careful when trying to slice the bagels so thin. If you have a bagel slicer, be sure to use it.

The first time I tried it with egg beaters and very large bagels.  Too mushy and bland. Now I use small lenders bagels and turkey bacon.  I also add 10 more minutes to the bake time.  I make this every time I have company staying over.  It compliments sweet pancakes/waffles.

We ate this dish, but weren't overly impressed with the recipe as written.  I followed the recipe as closely as possible, except I did add a couple extra slices of bacon and used onion powder in place of chopped onion.  There just wasn't much flavor.  All in all, just OK, so I probably won't make again.  UPDATE: I had leftover sesame bagels so I made this again with some of the changes suggested in the reviews.  I upped the bacon to 1 lb., used 14 eggs, and 2 1/4 c. milk.  This time I used the onion and added garlic powder.  Much better with these changes.  Chopped bell pepper would be a nice addition, too.

The first time I made it I followed the recipe exact and found it to be a little bland but good enough to try again. After reading the reviews I changed a few things and now think this is one of the best egg dishes ever!  I read a few reviews say they cut the bagels in smaller pieces and so I cut bite size chunks and it was moister and much easier to eat. Also there is not a lot of flavor and I didn't want to use everything bagels so I used peppered bacon (I also used 1lb rather than 1/2) and it made it GREAT. The flavor was perfect! I skipped the parmesan because the flavors did not work well together imo and put it all in a little bit smaller dish and adjusted the cooking time and it turned out much more moist. This is a fabulous recipe and perfect for a mom of 3 all under 5 since it is meant to be prepared the night before. I think the peppered bacon made a huge and very tasty difference-I highly recommend you try it :)

Really great!!  I made this for my husband's office.  Everyone loved it!!  I doubled the recipe and made everything low fat.  I used Egg Beaters instead of the eggs.  I was a little nervous if it would cook the same and it turned out perfect.  I used low fat cheese and lean turkey sausage.  It's much easier to tear up the bagels instead of slicing them.  I couldn't believe how it puffs up when cooking.  This is my new favorite dish.  I even used English muffins because I didn't have bagels and it was still good.  If you want to try something everyone will like make this bake.

We really like this breakfast casserole.  I followed the recipe except for adding more sharp cheddar on top, (about a cup), in the last ten minutes of baking.  I was sure to push the top layer of sliced bagels down into the egg/milk mixture so it wouldn't dry out while baking.  I think this would be a good company breakfast, and I will make this again.

I liked this casserole and would personally only give it a 4. However, I'm giving it a 5 because I made it for Easter Brunch this morning and it's the only thing that was completely eaten and I don't have any leftovers.  Everyone just loved it.  It was  super easy to make which is a big plus when cooking for 10 people.  I used 14 eggs instead of 12 and used smoked sausage instead of bacon.  I also topped it with Colby Jack cheese instead of Parmesan.

Excellent!  I made for Thanksgiving brunch and it was a huge success!  Very filling.  I made 2 batches for 9 adults, but had just enough with 1.  I made the recommended adjustments by increasing bacon, decreasing onion, using everything bagels, increasing cheese, increasing parsley and ommitting the parmesan.  A recipe worthy of being put in my recipe box.

Thank you so much for helping me break my breakfast casserole monotony. I did as others suggested and added 2 more eggs as well as using 3 1/2 Asiago cheese bagels, cubed. I prefer sausage to bacon so I used that too. Oh! I also added 2 tsps of dry mustard.  Fantastic!

I made this casserole this morning to take to my in-laws and there wasnt one piece left. I love breakfast sandwiches, but need the convenience of a casserole - this fits the bill perfectly. I debated whether to slice or cube the bagels, like some other reviewers and I decided to slice them. It came out wonderfully. The only changes I made were adding more bacon ( I used a whole pound) and more cheese between the layers and sprinkled on top. It took a few more minutes to bake,also. I did not make it and let it soak overnight. Made it in a matter of minutes, stuck it right in the oven and it came out delicious.

This is an easy to make recipe, great for brunch for a big group. It's especially a day saver b/c you prepare it the night before, so very little effort in the morning. It tastes great freshly hot from the oven. But it's a bit on the heavy side for our family, soooo much egg and milk. But then again, once in a while, for a big brunch group, it's an impressively easy dish to do. I added some cut up German sausage in addition to the bacon, gave it an additional dimension. Basically, it's a baked omelet. I skipped the parmesan, didn't really see the need for it. Was perfect with only cheddar in the mix.

Loved this egg dish, especially that it is prepared the night before.  I was using mini bagels, so I cubed them instead of slicing them.  Also used turkey sausage instead of bacon.  The entire family loved this one!

This is certainly a very easy and convenient dish, but I think I would rather just have bagels, scrambled egg and bacon. The top layer of bagels was a bit hard, and the bottom was a bit mushy.

I prepared this casserole for a noon brunch. Needless to say, it stayed more 8 hours in the fridge. Even though it was really good, I think it might be a good idea to let the dish sit at room temperature for a couple of hours before baking... I would have prefered the middle of the dish to be more set. Otherwise, it is very fast and easy to prepare, and it's subtle enough to serve when you have company.

This was delicious.  I also used bacon (about a pound), cubed asiago bagels (3 1/2), 14 eggs, 2 1/4 cups of milk & 2 tsp. of dry mustard.  It makes house smell terrific while baking & easily can be warmed if necessary while prep'g other dishes.  I will definitely make this one again, but instead of the Parmesan cheese the recipe calls for, would try shredded asiago.  Thanks very much.  Reviews really help me in deciding if a recipe is worth trying & your site is just a great place to "shop" for the right dish to make.

Very good and pretty simple. I used "everything" bagels to give it a little more flavor and I think next time I might add a little nutmeg, or use spicy sausage instead of bacon to give it a little extra kick.

Why not add another pound of ham, salami, and any other greasy processed meat you can think of, add some heavy cream, extra cheese, and just wait for the heart attack to happen!

I made this for the 1st time. I have picky eaters and this was a really good recipe that all my children enjoyed. I cut the bagels in bite sized pieces, omitted onions, doubled cheese, used cilantro instead of parsley, added 2 extra eggs, and used bacon bits instead of bacon. I also made salsa verde to drizzle on top when it was done.

A nice and simple, make the night before breakfast casserole.  This is also a really good recipe for bagels that are a little past their freshest days.  I made as written, but the next time I would like to try this with browned sausage or chopped ham.  A half pound of diced bacon was good, but a little lost in the dish.  I took this out to my parents house to enjoy it with them, and, they did.

Good make-ahead breakfast.  I used Everything bagels cut into large chunks, a full pound of bacon, and green onions.  I was a little concerned that I had too much bacon but I think now that 1/2 lb. would not have provided enough flavor.  Same with the bagels. I think it's definitely better to go with something more than just plain.  When served, the dish still needed a little salt and pepper.

I, like many others, found it easiest to tear up the bagels instead of slicing them. I also used a bit of extra bacon and added some extra Parmesan cheese for added flavor. Some broccoli, spinach, or mushrooms, or a combination of them could be a wonderful addition!

This was so easy to prepare the night before and let the bagels soak up the egg mixture, then bake in the morning.  I chopped some green pepper and fried with the chopped onions and bacon; Also found it easier to cut up the sliced bagels into smaller pieces.

I made this for christmas morning.  It will be made every christmas from now on.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I really packed the parsley into the teaspoon and was worried it would be too much, but that was the best part about the dish.  I put the bagel bottoms and tops on the bottom layer so the egg mixture would easily be absorbed.  I have made it already one more time with the same outcome, everyone loved it.   My husband says he eats breakfast every morning (j/k) and this is his #1 favorite so far.  He highly recommends it....so do I.

Well I am the exception as I didn't like this at all. I found the onion to be waaay to overpowering ( I would either use half the amount or not at all) and that was about all you could taste. It was heavy, and tasted like a spongy bagel. I won't be making this again even if it did look beautiful it left alot to desire taste wise. Thanks anyway

This was a quick and easy recipe to throw together.  I used 1/2 bacon and 1/2 turkey bacon, and I liked the flavor combination.  As other reviewers suggested, I used the "Everything" bagels.  Overall, it was a really good recipe and I will make it again.

I've had better recipes. If I make this again, I definitely will add more spices. This was pretty bland

This recipe was a HUGE hit at our staff brunch. I did some tweaking to the recipe also; substituted ground sausage for the bacon and baked it at 375 for about 40 min. as opposed to 400 as my first casserole cooked and browned too quickly. I omitted the onions by accident, just forgot. I also used the garden style egg beaters and this was the perfect flavor combination. I made if for my family the next day since I had left over bagels and my brother who said he normally doesn't go for egg bakes LOVED this recipe and even had the leftovers for dinner! I will recommend and make again!

I made this recipe on New Year's Eve so that I could have a nice, no fuss breakfast for guests the next morning.  It was excellent and everyone wanted the recipe.  The only things I changed were:  #1--I used onion bagels, and I cubed them because I don't have a bagel slicer.  #2--As per other reviewers suggestions, I used two more eggs. I will make this again, THANKS for the recipe!

I opted to use 3 1/2 onion bagels, and cubed them.  I used 14 eggs and added salt and extra cheese.  I kept covered with foil, and increased the baking time to 45 min. Quite tasty!!

I've been using this recipe for years and it's always a hit! I usually use sausage instead of bacon. You really can adjust the recipe any way that you want!

We thought it was very tasty.  I did cut the bagels into chunks,  used 14 eggs and 2 1/4 cups milk per suggestions.  Also added salt and I sprinkled chopped green onions on top of the bacon layer (didn't use any other onions).  Also added more cheese.  The bagel chunks that were on top did get nice, crispy and browned.  This makes a great dinner as well as special breakfast.

I made this recipe with bread for 80 residents at a resthome/hospital for their evening meal, they all loved it one layer of sliced bread on bottom and one after the bacon and onion instead of the bagels

Yum! This was delicious!! I used parmesan flavored bagels and added a bit of garlic with the onions. I also didn't make it the night before, but otherwise followed the recipe. I will definitely be making this one again!!

I used everything bagels and chopped them into bite size pieces. I used 12 oz of bacon and doubled the cheese. I also added dried Italian herbs. I brought it to a weekend at the cabin and both couples asked for the recipe easy to make and a crowd pleaser.

I made half the recipe, baking it in a 9” round deep pie plate, spiraling the bagel slices in the pan for a more attractive presentation.  After reading the reviews, I cut the slices even thinner than suggested to be sure the liquid was totally absorbed.   The only change I made was to increase the baking time.  This was a wonderful brunch recipe and looked beautiful served on a cake plate.

Great recipe for Christmas morning. Followed the suggestions from other reviews - used everything bagels and more bacon. Next time I make it, I would also add some green pepper and even more bacon.

Not bad, I loved that you could make it the night before and bake it the next day. I made this meatless. I enjoyed this, I will make again if I have some bagels to use up.

With all the great reviews I couldn't wait to try this as I love bagels and needed a change from the regular bread/egg bakes.  It was very disappointing. I couldn't even see the bacon and the bagels were too bready for the ratio of egg. I won't make it again. I did cover it with foil the entire time it baked and baking time was adequate as listed.

It wasn't bad.  I don't know what I was expecting because it tastes just like a breakfast casserole that I make with english muffins so I was a tad disappointed, but that has nothing to do with this recipe.  I gave it 3 stars, because it was good, but didn't have the "wow" factor.

This recipe was a HUGE hit when I had to feed some hungry men before they went skiing.  I added some diced ham and mushrooms into the mixture.  Instead of slicing the bagels thin I sliced them in half and then in 4ths.  It looks very pretty and tasted great.  For reheating it's best to use a toaster oven.  This will definitely be a repeat!

I thought this recipe was just okay.  I cut down the amount of the sausage and used both bacon and sausage together.  I thought that the bagels would make a little bit nicer texture but the bottom layer of bagels just kinda turned to mush with the eggs.  It was a very fluffy bagel/egg layer but you couldn't tell that there were bagels on the bottom.  I followed the advise of previous reviewers and covered the dish for about half the baking time then uncovered for the last half.  I didnt want the top layer of bagels to get chewy, but they turned out a little mushy too.  I would say do not cover the dish at all and let the bagels get a bit chewy.  The dish all in all tasted pretty good but I have definitely had better breakfast casseroles.  My Dad did go nuts for it though so I am fairly pleased =).

A-one! I followed this the way it was written (well, I did put in extra bacon and eggs) and it was very good! Still good the next day as well!Not bland in the least.  I might want to try variations another time but this was very successful! Thank you!

I made this for dinner tonight and we really enjoyed it. I did make a few additions which were as follows. First, I cut the bagels (I used onion bagels because that is what I had on hand) into pieces for easier serving and eating. I chopped up some green pepper and fried that up with the bacon and onion. I also cooked up some breakfast sausages and chopped and added them to the mix. I used more cheddar than called for and also added some shredded pepperjack as well. I will definately be making this again! Thanks for posting. :)

I made this for my family for Christmas breakfast and they loved it.  I did increase the bacon to 1 lb. and the cheddar cheese to 2 cups.  I used an applewood smoked bacon.  It was awesome.

This was fantastic. My favorite egg bake dish so far as there was a good balance as far as quanities between the amount of eggs and bread. I will always make ths one from now one.  I didn't use onions as my husband doesn't like them. Although I was ready to sneak them in until my husband saw the onion on the counter. Used a pound of bacon, which didn't seem like too much. The bacon gave it a great flavor and I didn't miss the onions at all. Baked for 20 min. Perfect!!

I made this dish for our Christmas Eve breakfast 2007 and everyone said how wonderful it was. So when I decided to have a brunch birthday party for my daughter I thought I might try something new. Well that didn't happen. As soon as my dad heard I wasn't going to make this dish, he was very upset and requested that I make the "Bagel dish" instead because he liked it so much. So I came back to Allrecipes.com and found the recipe again to make for the brunch. Within 2 bites of everyone eating, "Oh my gosh Melissa, this is so good. I want the recipe!" I think next time I might try using a little more bacon though. Other than that, this is an awesome dish!

I added more eggs and diced the bagels per other reviewers. Used ham instead of bacon, also added mushrooms, garlic and spinach. The dish was okay, though the eggs could have used more seasoning. The bagels "disappeared" but gave a nice fluffy texture to the eggs. I'll probably make it again, but season the eggs more.

I too cut up the bagels into bite size pieces, and I added more eggs to cover. Everyone loved it! Great recipe, but kind of expensive for all ingredients.

I baked this on a girl's weekend and it was a big hit and easy to make ahead.  I fried up red onions (instead of white) along with zucchini, mushrooms and some garlic and just added it to the bacon and put it over top of the chopped bagels.  From there I covered with the egg and left it in the fridge for 8 or 9 hours.  **It appeared to be cooked after about 35 minutes (firm to touch), but when I cut it open, it was still kind of runny.  It needed another 10 min. So don't assume it is done without checking first. 

Everyone absolutely loved it and I will make this dish again!

After reading a few reviews about the recipe I wasn't quite sure about it! Made it for Mothers Day Brunch using others suggestions, 4 Everything Bagels from Panera cut into bite size pieces, 1 lb bacon, 14 eggs, 2 1/4 Cups Milk, added 2 tsp dry mustard and omitted the peppers.  I also left it covered with foil the entire time in the oven to avoid the hard top that others encountered. This turned out great! It looked beautiful and really was a change of pace from a regular breakfast strata.  The kids loved the bagel idea.

This was a hit at Easter Brunch.  We accidentally used a whole pound of bacon, but according to my husband, there is no such thing as too much bacon.

This recipe gets 5 stars for making it easy to feed a large group of people breakfast -- one that's both hot and enticing when it hits the table.  Changes I made: I used a full pound of bacon (instead of 1/2).  Likewise, I cut the bagels into bite-size pieces.  I also added 1/2 a red and yellow pepper, diced, for added flavor and color.  And instead of Parmesan cheese, I added extra cheddar to the top before baking.  Finally, I covered the dish with aluminum foil for the first 20 minutes of baking.  Results: The top layer came out soft (not hard as other reviewers experienced).  I would definitely make it again for a brunch or large family gathering.

Good recipe - I used cubed whole wheat bread instead of bagels and refrigerated the prepared dish for about 6 hours instead of overnight.  It turned out to be very good but next time I will also season the bread for added flavor.  Will definitely make again!

My family is hard to please, beginning with my husband. This one is a winner! I am always on the lookout for dishes I can make ahead of time, having a family of 8 and going to school full-time and work part-time. Casseroles are great and this one didn't let me down. I think next time I will use turkey bacon so the fatty pieces won't gross out my little ones. Doubled the recipe of course and used extra bacon, baking in two bundt pans. Will use again!

very yummy breakfast casserole! went with ham instead of bacon, and added extra egg as others suggested. also didn't let it soak (just straight into the oven), and used "everything" bagels which turned out toasty and delicious (and beautiful). will definitely make again, maybe add some brocolli!

I thought this was very good. Using the bagels gave it a really nice texture and the onions gave it great flavor. Very quick and easy, I made it after everyone left on Christmas Eve so that I could bake it for Christmas Brunch. It was a huge hit. Great recipe.

This is a quick and super easy recipe which turned out wonderfully without setting in the fridge for at least 8 hours (I had forgot about that part).   I also made a few adjustments like others - chopped 6 whole bagels, used 14 eggs, 2 1\4 cups of milk and 1 box of pre-cooked bacon (omitted the parm and parsley).  Will be making again but not sure if I will let it sit overnight as the bagels on top came out nicely toasted.

Also done without bacon on a portion for those who don't eat pork which turned out great!

I made this dish for a staff meeting. Everyone enjoyed it! I did use 14 instead of 12 eggs and I used 2 1/4 cups of milk instead of 2. I also added salt into the egg mixture. Next time I will add more bacon to even out the amount of egg. I also added cheese on top. Overall I reccommend this recipe because it was good and very easy to make. Great if you are trying to feed a crowd!

thought we'd try this make ahead breakfast over the holidays. overall it was tasty but i thought the texture was too soft. i'd give it 3 1/2 stars but am going with 4 stars because my boyfriend enjoyed this dish much more than i did. no changes were made aside from making a half recipe. thanks muse!

I tweaked it as per some suggestions (ie, more bacon, 14 eggs, assagio bagels and cheese)----it was eaten but no one thought it was anything special. I was glad I made it for a family brunch where the feedback was honest.

We made this during the holidays for brunch.  This was a huge hit.  I used cheese topped bagels instead of plain.  Also added some mushrooms and green peppers to the bacon mixture.  (I would leave the green peppers out next time though.)  This was very tasty!

The first time I made this I took it to work for a potluck; everyone liked it. The second time I made it was for a bridal shower, and I assembled it at home, and then took it to my mom's house to bake. First of all I forgot that it needed to prepared the night before, and then I forgot the recipe at home; I couldn't remember what temp to cook it at, and ended up cooking at 350. I won't do that again! It took way to long to cook; everyone was waiting! I also made it without reading the reviews first. I think next time I will increase the eggs and milk used like others suggested; as my top layer of bagels did get a little hard. All in all an excellent recipe.

I used this reciepe at my one year old birthday party.  The party was at 10:00 am, it was a great brunch option and everyone really liked it. I think it would also be good if there were some veggies in there. (mushrooms,bell pepper...)

Being an adventurous chef for my 3 brothers and dad, I made this and instead of bagels i used whole wheat burger buns, added 1/4 cup ranch dressing to the egg mixture with 1 t prepared horseradish, and also got the idea to crumble feta on top! It is such an awsome recipe, my boys thank you EVER SO MUCH!

This was a huge hit! After reading other reviews, I made a couple of changes. I used cheddar and herb bagels instead of plain and added sliced mushrooms with the bacon and onion.  Also, I didn't have any parmesan, so I just topped it with more cheddar before baking.

Everyone loved this casserole. I did not add the onion. Instead I chopped up two green onions and sprinkled it over the crumbled bacon. I also used soy bacon. Next time I will use everything bagels or another flavor. This was so quick because I made it the night before.

This was very good. I made it for some neighbors and they loved it. I used a pound of bacon and no onions. As others suggested, I used two more eggs and about 1/2 cup more milk. I also skipped the parmesan. It did need to bake a little longer too.

Made this for all the elder women in my family. They were very impressed! I did cut back on onion and skipped Parm. cheese.
Do recommend the bagel pieces on the bottom be the "crust" ones to make sure they soften.
Very tasty

Very good-I used the suggestion to use the "everything" bagels.  I gave this as a gift for my brothers family at Christmas Eve for their Christmas breakfast-everyone loved it-I made one at home as well.  Always a favorite

Excellent!  I have made this for Easter,a bridal shower, and at Christmas time and everyone loves it.  It's a little different than a regular egg casserole because of the bagels.  The bagels get a little crunchy on top and this makes it great.  This recipe is a keeper!

This recipe was good.  I omitted the onions and topped the casserole with feta cheese crumbles.  The feta cheese added a wonderful taste.

Really good.  I made this a while back and forgot to review it immediately but I do remember it turned out.  It is very similar to many other breakfast casseroles I have made, but I remember thinking the bagel substitution was clever and really tasty.  We halved the recipe and switched out some cheeses, including fresh Parm which we had.  Good recipe.

I used a corning ware pan, and it was a bit hard to clean.  I also modified the recipe to be low fat.  Substituting tomatoes for bacon, and fat free cream cheese for the cheddar.  It completely changed the nature of the dish, but it was quite tasty they way I did it.

I didn't asemble this recipe overnight but somehow it still turned alright. (I did watch it like a hawk while it cooked in case something went wrong.) I also put murshooms in there and I think that is a welcome addition.

After reading other reviews I made some minor changes i.e. cubing the bagels & making sure there was enough liquid to cover them all.  I also used fresh mushrooms, ham instead of bacon, used cheddar on top instead of parm, etc.  Awesome!!!

This was a great breakfast to serve overnight guests!  Not only did it taste wonderful but it eliminated all the rushing around in the morning, since I put it together the night before.  I cubed the bagels instead of slicing them, and I used whatever kind of bagel I had in the freezer.  I think I ended up using two or three different kinds.  This is definitly a keeper!

This is a great idea. But the top layer of bagels came out way too tough. I cut that and also did not fry the bacon with the onion. Something about onions and eggs! UGH! But overall the recipe was great. I needed to alter it a bit. But it is now a favorite!

I've prepared this recipe twice... I used egg substitute instead of real eggs and didn't think it affected the outcome much. I've also tried using turkey-bacon and liked it better that way. Overall, it's a keeper!

I was looking for something that did not start with frozen hash browns and this looked great, and it was.  the hardest part was slicing the bagels into 4 parts,  I used  more bagels than suggested because I just ruined some slices.  The taste was great.  I added some extra meat, hot breakfast sausage.

Okay, hubby doesnt like bacon, so I did breakfast sausage and cooked it with the onions. But at the end of cooking, it was really liquidy. So you cant really do this all in one day. It has to sit overnight I think. The top was very hard after cooking. And it didnt call for any salt...it just didnt taste very good to me...idk. Maybe it is different  with bacon...

This was edible but not good. First, it was hard to tell if it was done because the bagels sticking out the top were covering up the eggy center that took longer to cook. Then it didn’t have much flavor. It was definitely not an improvement on the ingredients. My family would have much preferred toasted bagels, scrambled eggs with cheese, and bacon all separate.

We didn’t love this. I love smithfield bacon so I used extra bacon and cheese but it didn’t have enough flavor. I planned it specifically for a birthday breakfast and it took longer than expected and by the time the eggs were firm the bagels were a little crispier on top than I’d like, I would give it 40 minutes. It was okay, no one cleaned their plate. I probably wouldn’t make again. It wasn’t bad, just not that great.

Pretty tasty. I did use extra bacon and cheese. I halved recipe because it’s just my husband and I. For that size I doubled bacon and used a half a pound, diced small. Lots of bacon flavor. Topped casserole with some of the bacon onion mixture and sprinkle of more cheese. It did need more baking time for me. About 40 - 43 minutes.  Overall good recipe but we like our regular strata better.

I had to add about 15 minutes to baking time. This casserole is delicious and I will make it again. I think I will cut or tear the bagels up as suggested by some other reviewers. It will be easier to eat, and help with a more even distribution throughout the casserole. I used everything bagels and added a touch of granulated garlic. I also added about a quarter cup of red bell pepper, diced.( For my personal taste-love the flavor & the color!)I may add more next time because I didn't get any in my slice.  For presentation purposes(and any excuse to get extra bacon), I plan to add some crumbled bacon and sprinkle a bit of cheddar cheese on the top. Thanks for this awesome make- ahead breakfast idea that works well for a crowd.

Keeping true to the recipe ingredients, the only modification I made was to half it as there are just the two of us. We have lefties for another morning.
My husband and I enjoyed the recipe as written, found it flavorful enough for a breakfast casserole, and filling, although light, as opposed to a heavy potato egg casserole. We love the smokiness of the Smithfield bacon and wanted more of it. All in all, a very solid breakfast/brunch casserole with the ease of an overnight sit. Thank you, Muse!

I made this for today for Memorial Day breakfast with the whole fam, not one complaint. They chanted “bacon bacon” as I cut the casserole lol. Some changes I made was adding two extra eggs,  full package of Smithfield  bacon instead of half  and a whole onion. If you like seasoning I suggest using maybe a everything bagel for a little more of a flavor punch or just adding some salt. All in all this was really really good just as it is!

Great, big breakfast that’s easy to prep ahead of time. Good for weekends when you are hosting family. It’s like a breakfast sandwich casserole!

I made half the recipe and my 4 year old great nephew helped.  It turned out really tasty and was fairly easy to make.  YUMMY!

I'd like to give this 3 and a half stars if I could. It came out good although I would probably add more bacon and cheese next time.

I only used 1 bagel layer as the egg mixture seemed a little small for another layer to cover (and I used extra large eggs). I did add the whole pound of cooked bacon and a few leftover roasted vegetables from the night before. I don’t think it needed more bagels and I didn’t have to worry about the top layer of bagels being hard and chewy. Everyone loved it.

We do our bacon in the oven, less mess. Thick cut w/ oven on 375 for 22 min. on a parchment lined baking sheet, and we cooked a full pound. For this recipe, we added the onions right on to the baking sheet w/ the bacon. The smaller pieces came out pretty carmelized and the larger ones were still cooked well. I also omitted the Parmesan (we were out) and the parsley (simply because my plant didn’t make it through the winter this year). I used whole grain English Muffins in place of the bagels since I only had one bagel left. Other than that, followed directions (except we seasoned liberally w/ blk ppr) and ended up with an easy and FANTASTIC breakfast dish for my little family on Easter morning. Even my picky 6-yr old loved this! I may try to sauté or roast several cloves of garlic to add next time!

This turned out awesome with the usual tweaking - Made w/ everything bagels, went 50-50 on bacon & sausage ( 1/2 lb each), added green & red pepper, hot sauce, more cheese.  

Baked 20 min covered, 20 min uncovered.

I served it at my B&B today and guests LOVED it.

This was excellent!  Tasted more like an egg dish than a bagel or starchy dish.  I diced one bagel and used five eggs and made two individual servings so cut back on proportions of other ingredients...otherwise, I pretty much followed the directions.  I used Monterey Jack since I didn't have cheddar on hand...was a great substitute but would use cheddar in the future.  I still finished it off with Parmesan - yum!  The dish was not soggy at all as some reviewers thought it might be...it was much firmer than breakfast casseroles made with bread.  I'll definitely be making this again.  I highly recommend it!

A sad recipe at its best.  I like breakfast casseroles but this one leaves a lot to be desired,

Better to make a bagel breakfast sandwich which I did and added a slab of canned green chili.

One of my families favorite  thing to eat for breakfast are Lox and bagels with scrambled eggs  so when I saw this recipe I thought I wonder if it would work with smoked salmon. I tried it and it came out great and was a big hit. I sliced everything bagels thin,  toasted them and spread them with a thin layer of cream cheese on both sides, then placed slices of smoked salmon on top of the bagels, sprinkled the whole thing with chopped green onions, put the tops of the bagels on and covered the whole thing with 12 eggs, 1/2 & 1/2 and salt & pepper that I had put in the blender so they were well scrambled. Then I stirrred  2-3 Tbls chopped chives into the egg mixture and poured it on top of the bagels. I did it the night before  suggested and baked it the next morning. I garnished the top with more chopped chives. It was so good and looked very appetizing. Great idea for a family brunch.

Almost followed the recipe perfectly, but forgot about the Parmesan Cheese!  Would have been 5 stars, I am sure, if that had been done.  As it was, it could have used more seasoning.  I thought salt ... but my guests loved it as it was.  Two asked for the recipe! Served it at a brunch accompanied by a garnish of colorful fresh fruit.  Pretty!

Great recipe!  Followed the recipe but used what I had on hand.  Turkey bacon instead of regular & onion powder in place of onions, added a couple of pinches of salt in the egg mixture.  Made it very easy to prep.  Also, didn't make it night before so let it sit about 10 mins before baking, and it turned out fine.  Used Thomas' whole wheat bagels that are not very dense.  Think that is why it saturated quickly & worked well.  The kids loved it!!!

I made this yesterday for Easter brunch.  I assembled it the night before and doubled it.  I also added 1 cup of Cottage Cheese to the egg mixture and would consider adding green chilies for a little kick next time.  It was WONDERFUL!  The bagels do not make it as breakfast sandwich-esk as I thought which turned out perfectly.  This will be a go too for me for years to come, the fact that you assemble everything the night before makes this even more perfect.

Made this according to the recipe. I was hoping it would turn out more as sandwiches, but it's more of a casserole. Flavor was good.

After following advice of top reviews i'd give 4 stars with those changes . My hub and 3yo really enjoyed it but it was in edible to me due to the texture. I'll make again but keep it to the skillet.

I cut the recipe in half and it turned out great.  I did tear up the bagel for better cutting and I made sure I pressed all the bagel down in the liquid with a spatula prior to soaking.  I added cheese to the top layer like other suggested and did bake for about 40 minutes.  Definitely making for next year, my family loved it.

Excellent, easy to prepare.  Even my most picky child loved it.  I used lowfat milk and everything bagels for a switch.  I prepared it on christmas eve before going to bed and then popped it in the oven while we opened gifts.  It was prefectly ready when we were done.

I'm always looking for easy breakfast entrees, and this make-ahead recipe certainly fits the bill.  I thought it sounded a bit bland, though, so I supplement the onions with 1/4 cup each of diced green and red peppers, plus 2 diced Roma tomatoes.  (The tomatoes are my favorite part.) I actually use a little less bacon (1/2 of a nitrite-free 12 oz. pkg) but add 1/2 tsp salt and several dashes of tabasco.  I reserve some of the cheese for the top but don't increase the total amount.  I haven't had any trouble with the bagels incorporating into the egg mixture, maybe because I use a square 10" baking dish, not a 9x13.  Usually they disintegrate so much that you can't even detect them. Wouldn't call this fabulous but it's quite good, and it's a nice switch from other standard egg entrees. I will definitely make it from time to time.

I agree with other users that this is a good casserole, but a little on the bland side.  After working with the recipe, I think I have found what works best for us:  * use 14 eggs * instead of using white onions, use green onions * beat a softened package of cream cheese until smooth, then add in the green onions & keep beating until well blended, then proceed to add in the egg mixture * use 2 cups of cheese & a whole lb of bacon.  Not exactly healthy, but it is very tasty...

Delicious!  I make this for company all the time.  It's so easy and tasty!  I love bacon, so I make a whole pound, then cut off the fatty pieces.  I also use dry onion, because that's what I have on hand, usually.

Used whole wheat bagels, and received raves. This one's getting added to my recipe book.

this was delicious!  hubby doesn't like onions so i just left them out and put in extra bacon but i'm sure it would totally round out the flavor.  i sliced the bagels in thin rounds so that they'd be easy to layer and pressed it down so that the egg mixture covered all the bagel.  this is important so that it doesn't dry out.  very tasty brunch dish!  serve with fresh pineapple and strawberries to kick it up a notch!

YUMMY! The only thing I changed was the cheese portion. I love cheese so I added a lot more than what the recipe called for. It was delish! I have made it for family gatherings twice now and it doesn't last long!

I didn't realize when I started to make this that you were supposed to refrigerate this for 8 hours before baking.  It was morning and we were hungry so we through it together and baked it.  It still turned out great and was actually even better the next day!

Easy and good!  Don't believe some of the others out there.  This is just fine the way the recipe reads.  Of course, if you want to add more fat (which makes everything better), yeah, add more cheese bacon, or if you are like me, sausage.  Next time I'm going to try it with chorizo.  If you are using the 12 eggs, be sure they are the 'big' ones.  As the other posts say, if it doesn't cover the bagels, well, add more then.  Great office dish too.

This was just ok for us.  The idea is good, but I think it gets lost somewhere in the baking.  I was thinking it would be like a sandwich in a casserole...it wasn't.  I doubt if I make this again.  I think the bagels kind of ruined this one.

Looked beautiful, but tasted just ok.  The bagels got lost in it.

I made this for my daughter's confirmation brunch and it was a big hit.  The bacon and onion taste with the bagels was very good.  I will definitely keep this in my recipe box.  I as a little different from the regular breakfast casseroles.
