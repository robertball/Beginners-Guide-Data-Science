I doubled this recipe and took it to work.  Everybody liked it.  It was super fast and easy to make and economical.  It could easily be used to stuff tortillas and top with cheese and sauce for a quick vegetarian meal.

Took this to my BUNCO group and it was well received.  Very easy and very tasty.  I had already dumped in the cheddar cheese, then noticed it was intended as a topping, but the dip was still attractive and delicious.  If you buy your taco seasoning mix in bulk like I do, 1 ounce equals about 1/4 cup.

Great reviews!  It's very hearty and tasty. I don't have a slow cooker, so I  heated it slowly over low heat in a regular pot.  I recommend hearty chips because the dip is pretty heavy.  Thank you for giving me a use for that Bean with Bacon soup I had!

I make a version of this using refried beans, 1 cup cheddar, 1 cup salsa, dash of hot sauce and whatever else I feel like throwing in there.  Heat it up, put in a sm. crock pot and chips.  Yummy!

I did not like this at all! I think the taco seasoning and bean soup was not a very good combo.This did not go over to well for me. Lots left over.

A great blend of fiesta flavors going on here. I used freshly made pico de gallo for the salsa and spread the Taco Bean Dip on crispy tostada style tortillas prior to melting the cheese.

Followed the recipe to a "T". We all loved it. About as simple as could be. I found a new favorite dip to alternate with Buffalo Chicken Dip.

I did really like it, but I found that the taco seasoning was a bit strong. Next Time I don't think I'll put the whole packet in and try a different salsa next time. But overall a very good recipe for a get together.

It never lasts long! Everyone finishes it wherever I take it! Already made it twice, and the third coming up very soon.

One of my all time favorite old recipes.  I always use the Lawry's Taco Seasoning so it tastes like all the church pot lucks I knew as a kid.
