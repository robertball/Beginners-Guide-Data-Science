This is a great recipe.  I substituted creamy peanut butter for the peanut butter chips and it still came out fantastic.  Thanks for the recipe!

This cake is SO GOOD!  I made 2 round layers with peanut butter frosting and mini chocolate chips on top and in between the layers.  For the frosting I used pre-made cream cheese frosting mixed with natural peanut butter.  I also used natural peanut butter in the recipe instead of peanut butter chips.  Everyone at my husbands birthday party said it tasted just like a Reeses peanut butter cup - yum!

I made this for my Dad's birthday and it was a hit! He requested a peanut butter chocolate cake...and this is what I thought would work. It's definitly peanut butter chocolatey..and VERY MOIST! One suggestion...since it doesn't call for a certain frosting...I would recommend adding butter cream frosting to another peanutbutter-chip-and-shortning-mixture. Then after you frost it..sprinkle chocolate chips and your leftover peanut butter chips on top. That's what I did. Enjoy!

Excellent. I made this for my son's birthday, at his request. The cake is moist and dense - just the way we like it. I baked it in a bundt pan for 1 hour, frosted with pb frosting and decorated with mini choc chips and chopped peanut butter cups. Thanks for the recipe - I see a repeat in our future. ;)

This cake is wonderful! I substituted 1 cup creamy peanut butter for the pb chips and shortening. I baked it in a bundt pan at 350 degrees for one hour and served it with the Fluffy Peanut Butter Frosting recipe from this site. Moist and delicious!

Hmm.. this was a keeper! My hubby couldn't find just peanut butter chips so he got the Toll House chocolate and peanutbutter chips. This was fabulous. Oh be careful b/c water is not listed on the ingredients but is listed in the recipe. I had to add water after dividing the chocolate and peanutbutter parts.

Oh my goodness. If you are a peanut butter and chocolate lover this is the cake for you. I followed the recipe with a couple of changes based on previous reviews. I used a cup of peanut butter for the chips and added a cup of semisweet chocolate chips to batter. I cooked it in a heavy bundt pan for 50 mins. Cake is so moist. I used the satiny chocolate glaze to which I added 1/4 cup peanut butter. It is pretty rich with these changes but oh so good.

This cake was very tasty though there wasn't a very pronounced peanut butter or chocolate flavor like I anticipated. It baked up beautifully though filling the pan completely and had a light texture. I was in a hurry and needed a quick frosting so I used Betty Crocker chocolate with the leftover peanut butter chips melted and stirred in before spreading it. That PB/chocolate taste was more pronounced and really yummy with this cake.

This cake was very dry. I may have done something wrong because other reviewers really loved it. I didn't like it at all but some other people at the picnic said it was pretty good.

This was a really moist & delicious cake. I had an abundance of peanut butter that I needed to use up so I used about 3/4 peanut butter instead of the chips. I also used a yellow cake mix because that's what I had on hand and made it in a bundt pan. I added the satiny chocolate glaze from this site (with a heaping tbsp on pb added to it). I said all of that to say that this recipe is pretty versatile and you can easily alter it with what you have on hand. The result is incredible peanut buttery goodness!

Pretty good! Everyone enjoyed....not dry at all and I used 1/2c crunchy PB and 1/2c creamy PB in place of the chips. I too made in a bundt pan and glazed with a can of chocolat frosting that was microwaved for 30-40 seconds until pourable. Sprinkled mini choco chips on top. Pretty presentation. The only think I would do different next time would be to use a yellow cake mix instead of the white....Dont get me wrong I love the taste of white cake mix....but I think with this recipe it was kinda batteling the flavor of the PB and a yellow mix would have gone better... Non the less a yummy cake.

Very good! I would have liked it to be more chocolatey as the prevelant flavor was peanut butter. Maybe not making all the batter peanut butter flavored and then dividing it but instead dividing the plain batter and flavoring each half seperatly would work. It was very tasty with fluffy peanut butter frosting (from this site).

Never had a peanut butter flavored cake before. This is excellent!! I used creamy peanut butter in place of peanut butter chips. It seemed to me that a cup and a half was too much batter to be adding in to the cocoa mixture because when I went to drop it over top by the spoonfuls it almost completely covered it. I thought there was no way to swirl it in without totally mixing the two batters and coming out with a light brown cake BUT it worked. The chocolate swirl looks AWESOME! I topped it with a simple icing of milk and confectioner's sugar. It took 40 minutes to bake. Definite Keeper!!!

This is my son's favorite! It is the cake he has for his birthday every year by request. I have made it every year since I first found the recipe on allrecipes.com. almost 8 years ago. I even made it as a full sheet cake for his high school graduation. It is a wonderfully moist cake with great flavor.

If I could give 4.5 I would It is delicious however I baked only 25 mins or so at 350 gas stove in the 9 13 pan I used peanut butter instead of the chips and shortening I added chocolate chips to the melted butter as well as cocoa because some reviewers said it wasnt flavorful enough I agree it has a hint of peanut butter and chocolate but not prodominent KNowing this before you make the recipe does help I do recommend making the cake it was perfect density and delicious

This was really a awesome cake. I was in a pinch for a dessert quick. THis was easy and everyone was acting like I did something special. I only changed one thing I had no PB chps so I used Jif instead in the same amount. (1 Cup) worked perfect and deliciously! I put it in a floured bundt pan and frosted it with this sites "Sour Cream Chocolate Frosting" and it was perfect. That was the best icing I have ever made so easy too. This was a happy recipe emergency this ones a keeper. THanks!

I used melted creamy peanut butter instead of the chips. I also increased the amount to 2 cups of peanut butter this helped cover the "white cake" flavor. Next time I make this I will reserve about 1 cup of batter and use the cocoa powder to flavor that instead of the butter mixture. I didn't really taste the chocolate so I think this will enhance that flavor more. I made it into a double layer cake with milk chocolate frosting.

Yummy in my tummy! I made a chocolate peanu butter frosting and topped it with peanut butter chips. Thanks for the recipe. I may have mixed it too much or it's just the recipe but I thought it was a little too dry for my taste not that I didn't thoroughly enjoy it!

Absolutely delicious. Very moist. I made the cake as specified EXACTLY. Cooked in a bundt pan. Topped the cooled cake off with homemade chocolate frosting and chopped cocktail peanuts which added a bit of saltiness to the sweetness. Will definitely make this recipe again.

I absolutely loved this cake!! It had a light peanut butter flavor mixed in with the chocolate. The cake is very moist and attractive. I frosted the cake with home-made fudge icing. Yum! This cake was the hit of our family party.

I did this recipe as a favor to a friend. I found it to be a fairly easy and nice recipe. She needed it for a coworkers birthday and said everyone raved over the cake. They all liked it so much she let them think she made it. I used the special butter cream frosting and just added some melted peanut butter chips like in the cake.

The cake was very moist and good but it did not have a strong PB or chocolate flavor. I would have definitely liked to have tasted more peanut butter and a richer chocolate. The consistency of it was very nice though and baked great in a Bundt pan for 50 minutes. I also added the "Satiny Chocolate Glaze" to it.

This recipe is very good and moist. I doubled the ingredients for a larger sheet cake. It baked well by doubling. I also used parchment paper on the bottom which I believe is a must. For the frosting I used the Wilton icing/frosting mix in a box. I really like the flavor of this frosting. All you do is add butter and milk. I took a previous suggestion and tossed the remaining peanut butter chips in the frosting. My wife said it gave it a nice peanut butter flavor. One warning...my oven was recently calibrated (by me) but still baked the cake at 350 degrees in 30 minutes. So...be careful of your cooking time. Thanks Jan for the recipe submission!

I made this as a two layer cake for my boyfriend who loves peanut butter and chocolate. I used the buttercream professional icing on here for both filler and frosting then used chocolate and peanut butter chips to cover the top and sides (used creamy peanut butter instead of chips for the actual recipe). The cake came out reaaally moist and rich you can taste the peanut butter! And the batter was delicious too:) But I think this would do better as a sheet cake with a little bit of chocolate topping instead of a two layer just so you know ahead of time. Way too rich! (Not a bad thing!!)

An excellent cake moist and tasty. My only suggestions is to use either a vanilla cake mix or just add vanilla to your white cake mix. Also instead of peanut butter chips I used the real deal choosing a creamy peanut butter for a more intense flavor. To kick it off I used a milk chocolate frosting this way I feel the two flavors combined better creating a peanut butter cup taste. Delicious!

I made this exactly as recipe stated only I used a bundt pan. It was very good. It doesn't need a glaze as it's very moist as is however next time I think I'll make a chocolate glaze and maybe crush some reeses peices on top. (I saw SunnyBird's picture and it looks like this is what she did - so pretty!) Anyway I had to make another of these as one of my children was very upset that she didn't get much of the first one I made! It doesn't last long!

The only downside to this cake is that it gets a few bowls messy. I Made this for my friend's birthday and it was a hit. The birthday girl even said it "made her birthday." and everyone at the party gobbled it up. Iced it with chocolate buttercream frosting and sprinkled chopped up Reese's cups on tops.

It was delicious and quickly gobbled up. I did not have pb chips so I used 2/3 cup of creamy pb instead. I used a Bundt pan.  It did not swirl. The chocolate sunk to the bottom so it more like a cake with a chocolate layer and a pb layer. Used yellow cake mix because I didn’t have white. For frosting... just used some canned frosting.  I spread some on the top while the cake was still warm so it drizzled down there sides.

The cake was okay - a little on the dry side. I did use peanut butter instead of melted peanut butter chips but I don't think that that would affect the moisture. I made a 2 layer cake with fluffy peanut butter frosting as the filling. Topped with chocolate ganache and more peanut butter frosting. My daughters really liked this but they are the peanut butter lovers in the family.

My wife and I enjoyed baking our first cake together. We made it for our twin sons (boys) baby shower. EVERYONE LOVED IT!!!!...and surprised that we made it ourselves. It was our way of doing something for them together. We will definitely recommend to others!!

Was simpler than I thought... made a great birthday cake for my husband. Tip... I melted the rest of the peanut butter chips and mixed it into some store-bought cream cheese frosting... it was great!

I used a cup of creamy peanut butter instead of peanut butter chips and I threw in a little vanilla. This went over awesome! It was rich and moist and dense and the peanut butter lovers were in heaven! I left the leftovers for a family with kids and they brought their friends over just to taste the cake.

This cake was delicious! I used peanut butter instead of pb chips as the others suggested. I made a ganache of semi sweet chocolate chips and whipping cream which I drizzled over the cake. I topped it off with some finely chopped peanuts and chopped mini peanut butter cups. What a decadent dessert! Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Followed recipe to a t except I subbed semi sweet for pb chips. Sprayed and powdered my bundt pan and baked for close to 1 hour as per another reviewer's advice. Tastes amazing; definitely a strong chocolate flavor all around. But half the cake clung to the pan! Was planning on bringing to a bake sale but now have to rethink my plan...:(

I made this cake exactly as the recipe states with the exception of using peanut butter instead of chips. The final product was very dry. As another reviewer said the flavors weren't very pronounced. Everyone loves chocolate & peanut butter but I wouldn't make this recipe again.

This cake was not good. The flavor was off and the cake turned out dry and crubmly. I followed the directions and didn't make any alterations. Don't know what happened but I won't be making this again.

This recipe was used for my son's birthday. He loves peanut butter. Although the cake turned out nice I was a little dissapointed at the taste. I was hoping for a burst of flavor and this recipe just didn't get it. Next time I may add more peanut buter chips and more cocoa as well as some vanilla and a full cup of brown sugar. I will exchange some of the butter and shortening with applesauce to help reduce the fat content. I found a recipe for peanut butter frosting and then topped the cake with mini chocolate chips it made a great presention. Still a good cake but for my family's taste we would like it kicked up a notch.

This cake was very good everyone who tried it really enjoyed it! One thing I was well into making the cake and realized I was out of eggs. I subsituted a healthy splash of milk instead and this cake came out wonderfully! I used peanut butter frosting which was the perfect complement! Will definitely make this one again!

This was delicious! The only thing I would change is to put a little more of the chocolate batter in it. Yummy even so!

I was looking for a specific recipe to get a great result. This recipe is fabulous and not too complicated but instead of peanut butter I used Lotus Biscuit spread the result was delicious

These were so moist and delicious. I used peanut butter instead of chips cause that's what I had on hand. I also doubled the amount of chocolate batter before I added the one and a half cups of the peanut butter batter to it. I wanted them equally chocolately and peanut buttery! I made a ganache w/bittersweet chocolate and cream and they were fantastic. Thanks!

This cake was really good. I used a bitter cake mix instead of a white cake mix and used creamy peanut butter instead of chips/shortening. I frosted it with a peanut butter butter cream frosting. Got rave reviews from everyone who tried it and I thought it was very tasty... I will be making it again for sure.

I make this for work a lot and it is always a hit. It's great for peanut butter and chocolate lovers but isn't too sweet.
