This was a nice simple, lemon-limey cocktail.  I only had white rum, so I improvised and added a touch of lemon juice.  I never have "real" lemons/limes for garnishes, so I used my usual cherries for garnish.  I enjoyed reading the story of how this cocktail came to be/be named.  Cheers, (and thank you) callistobug!
