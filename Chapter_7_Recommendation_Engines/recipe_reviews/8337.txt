This is an awesome cake. We really enjoyed the blend of favors. To reduce the fat, I cut back the oil to 1/2 cup and replaced it with 1 1/4 c. plain yogurt. I also didn't have blueberries, so I used frozen saskatoons (native to our area)instead. I also cut back the sugar by 1/3 to 1/2 as we prefer cakes that are less sweet.

With minor variations, this is the classic Hummingbird Cake – and it’s a good variation at that!  I liked so much about this recipe – the addition of blueberries, dicing rather than mashing the bananas and the additions of both nutmeg and cinnamon.  Coating the pan with ground coconut was interesting, however, I didn’t do that as I was using specialty cakelet pans which didn’t make that particularly practical.   While I wouldn’t say the cake is greasy, I do think reducing the oil by 1/4 c. wouldn’t hurt.  This cake is rich, heavy and sweet, so in my view no icing is necessary – in fact, I would recommend against it.  A simple dusting of powdered sugar is all this needs; although a very runny powdered sugar glaze just to shine it up would be nice too. (Note: My cakelet pans were 6 (one cup) individual molds.  I used two of these pans for one recipe yielding, then, 12 individual cakelets.  I baked them at 325 degrees for about 30 minutes, covered with foil toward the end of baking to prevent overbrowning)

Oh so good.  Very moist.  I didn't bother with processing the coconut.  I just added it along with the fruit and nuts.  This is a definite make again recipe.  I'm anxious to try it with other fruits such as mixed berries, nectarines or cherries.

This is a nice moist cake.  Couple of things though...the author never mentions when to add in the pineapple and it only took about 1 hour to bake in my oven.  I love the blueberries and bananas, but I think the next time I make it I will use applesauce instead of pineapple.  Just my personal preference.

Love, love, love this cake! I didn't change a thing except toasted the pecans 1st. Added the leftover coconut powder to the batter.  This is very moist & very delicious.  Thanks Danapiana!!

Very good!  I was short on cooking oil so used half cup melted butter and half cup of oil.  I cut the sugar back to 1 and a half cups.  The cake took 60 minutes to bake in my oven.

This is very good, thank you!  I think I will definitely sub applesauce for oil next time--I just don't have applesauce in the house right now.  This makes a LARGE bunt cake--it really fills up the pan.  I was worried it would spill over, but it didnt'.  It rose over hte pan but no batter spilled in the oven, so that's all good.  This cake ends up very crispy on the outside and very moist and fruity on the inside.  It's very flavorful--my kind of cake (I'm picky--I prefer cakes with fruity flavors).  Thanks for the recipe!

A flavorful, light and tasty Bundt!  The only change that I made was 1 cup oil and substitute the extra half a cup with applesauce.  I really liked the touch of coconut "powder" used to grease the pan!  I had no trouble getting this cake out of the pan.  Delish!!

Fantastic.  I am a gourmet cook/baker.  I made this cake for company, and they loved it too.  I did, however, make a change.  I felt 1-1/2 c. of oil seemed like too much, so I added 1 c. of canola oil and 1/2 c. softened butter.  I added 1/2 c. of flaked coconut to the buttered bundt pan (not powdered), and I added another 1/3 c. of flaked coconut to the batter.  I also increased the baking soda by 1/4 tsp, and sprinkled with powdered sugar after the cake cooled for about 15 mins. out of the pan.

I made this for my daughter's first birthday and it was wonderful.  We used the castle bundt pan and decorated with candies and homemade vanilla frosting.  The pecans were omitted, plus I mixed the coconut flakes in with the rest of the batter.  Thanks for sharing it with us!

I made this for a friend at work, for her birthday.  Usually chocolate is the request but this time she asked for cake with fruit so I found this recipe, baked it last night for the first time and was enjoyed by all today at break.

I changed ingredients as follows: reduced sugar to 1 1/2 cups, reduced oil to 1/2 cup, added 1 1/4 c low-fat vanilla yogurt.  I omitted the nuts and pineapple as we had company that was allergic.  It still was moist!  Definitely only bake it one hour - no more.  I served crushed strawberries over and squirted a little bit of Reddi-Whip.  Looked decadent, but was much lower in calories than the original recipe.  The coconut gave it the powdered sugar "look" and sweet taste.  Everyone loved it!

I sit here writing this while I munch on a piece of the cake! I had fresh coconut and needed a way to use it.  I didn't powder the coconut, just used it grated and threw it in with the rest of the fruit.  I didn't have blue berries or nuts, although I think the nuts would be fabulous!  I also used only a 1/2 cup of oil and 1 cup of applesauce and the cake was very moist and yummy!  I only cooked it 1 hour, any longer would have burnt it...  thanks for a yummy recipe.

This cake was a real hit. I served it at a dinner party along with bakery treats - which were passed over in favour of this cake. Next time I'll reduce the oil and replace some of it with applesauce - just to be a little healthier. Thank you so much for this recipe!

Yummy!  Too lazy to process coconut so just threw it into the mix and floured the pan instead.  Bananas were very overripe, so mashed instead of diced.  Subbed 1/2 cup applesauce for 1/2 cup of the oil.  Only took about 1 hr to bake in my oven.  Even with changes, still delicious.  Next time, might even try reducing sugar, not because of taste, just trying to cut down on sugar.

This tastes great!  It is more like a bread than a cake, though.  Like other reviewers, I added the coconut to the batter instead of making a powder for the outside of the cake.  I will add more coconut next time I make it.

very moist.  I loved this cake ( and I really don't like cake that much )  The only reason I gave this a 4 star is because of my Husband's input.  He would liked to have tasted more coconut.  I did use half of the oil suggested and the other half applesauce.  The cake held very well for several days ( there is only two of use to consume this )
 Please do try this recipe...a nice mix of fruits and a moist cake indeed.

I really enjoyed this cake, but I did make a few substitutions.  I didn't have blueberries, so I added a third banana instead.  I used a cup of whole wheat flour in place of a cup of white.  I used a little less sugar than called for, and I used pineapple tidbits instead of crushed.  I also added about half a cup of coconut to the batter.  The result was delicious!  Thanks!

I baked my cake for 1 hour and 10 minutes, and the outside was very dry - I think I must have hit a banana when I tested it at an hour.  Even so, it was a fantastic cake - with all the fruit, it would be great for brunch.  Will definetely make it again.

very nice - dense and heavy but that is okay - i used applesauce instead of pineapple, plus toasted the pecans and added 1/4 cup chopped pistachios. Also used raw sugar not table, and just 1.25 C oil. Was done at 1 hour so use the toothpick test to not burn- split top will be a clue of being done. Next time will add about 1/3 C honey to make a bit sweeter

I have made this before, great recipe to add or make emergency substitutions with. If you don't like using so much oil...sub with some mayo which can also be used instead of an egg or two, oats instead of coconut in the case of allergies, it all works great with this cake. My son doesn't  like cake at all, he loves this "banana berry bread"  wink wink

This a delicious cake! I made it for a friend's birthday and was a little hesitant about taking a cake that I had not tried out the recipe before. I should not have worried...everyone loved it. I did make a few changes after reading some of the reviews. I used 1 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of applesauce (homemade applesauce is great for this!) and I added the coconut directly into the batter as well as adding about 1/3 cup more. To "gussy up" the presentation because it was a birthday cake, I drizzled a butter icing over the top after it had cooled and then added a homemade blueberry sauce on top. Probably over the top but it sure looked good!

The second time I made it, doubled all the ingredients, but used 5 eggs, not 6. Used yogurt instead of oil, added shredded coconut to dry ingredients. Got 24 design cupcakes, friends and family love it.

This recipe is the bomb as is. Also very flexible. 2nd time making I used 1/2 oil & 1/2 apple sauce. 2 bananas & 2 cups assorted berries( strawberry,raspberry,blueberry)and sliced almonds.  Baked in 9x 13 pan about 40 min. Then iced with a confectionary sugar glaze with almond extract. Incredible.

Made it gluten free and came out deliciously crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. Stuck to the center of the pan, will brush melted coconut oil on the pan next time to remedy this (used cold butter this time) added 1/2 tsp of xanthan gum due to gluten free flour

Very good! A very moist cake. It was eaten quickly. I altered it of course because my picky family does not enjoy coconut or nuts. I subbed one cup of applesauce for oil and just put in 1/2 cup of oil. I added some chopped frozen strawberries and we liked that. I did cut down the sugar 1/2 cup in the batter but sprinkled some powdered sugar on the top of the cake. We loved all the fruit in it. It was a hit! Will make again!
