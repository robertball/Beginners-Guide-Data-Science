Nothing could be easier and more impressive for a contribution for a family potluck, office party, or other event where you are asked to bring an appetizer.  

No cooking.  No real prep.  Easy-peasey and I got tons of compliments.  

If you're looking for a quick, easy way to candy your own walnuts, I suggest this:

Melt 1 tbsp butter in a skillet on medium heat.  Add in 3 tbsp honey and mix, then add in 1 1/2 cup walnuts.  Cook for 5 minutes or until walnuts are toasted.

Spread onto parchment paper and let cool for 1 or 2 minutes.  Separate any nuts that are clumping at this time, then let cool completely.

I have made this several times using Gorgonzola. FANTASTIC!!!!  So easy and so tasty. Do use a quality balsamic as it makes a big difference. I am asked to bring this dish to all the potluck a and give out the recipe every time.

Super easy and soo yummy!  Used a balsamic glaze as mentioned in a few other reviews (available in the grocery store right next to the balsamic vinegars).  Glaze has such a nice thickness and sweetness; I just put a dash on top of each of the filled cups and can't imagine using a regular balsamic after trying it that way.  Will be making again and again!

Easy, pretty and tasty. I used soft Gorgonzola instead of blue cheese which can be rather crumbly.

Life saver!
 This is so yummy! I had to make an appetizer to share at a pool party and these were amazingly good! I didn't use glazed walnuts, just chopped and everyone loved them. Thank you so much for this keeper!

Loved it.  I will surely make it again.  The endive leaves were rather large so I cut the  in half.  Worked out great and made enough for 8 people.

This was delicious and easy. I did chop the raisins and pecans coursly and added 1T light sour cream, which helped hold it together a bit. Then, I topped it with Trader Joe's balsamic glaze; its thicker so makes a very nice presentation.  I did use Gorgonzola; even my friends who don't typically like blue cheese loved this appetizer!

Light and healthy, this appetizer was a huge hit with my foodie golf buddies. I'll definitely be making it again. Only one change, I didn't need 3 heads of endive, two worked well for 2 dozen or so appetizers.

Tweaked the basic recipe ... used goat cheese, added a chopped apple, and plain yogurt as a binder.  A fresh, crunchy, healthy option in my hors d'oeuvres arsenal.

This was just as quick and easy as everyone said. I was afraid that without something like cream cheese holding the ingredients together that it would be a mess, but somehow it held together and everyone loved it. I deleted the balsamic. I tasted it with and without and I preferred the flavor without the vinegar. The balsamic vinegar  just masked the other favors. It's a keeper!

This is a winning snack for any occasion! It offers so many delicious flavors in just one bite. I modified the recipe a bit by reducing balsamic vinegar and sugar to create more of a syrup to drizzle. No matter how many of these endive cups you make, they'll certainly be devoured.

Instead of cranberries used chopped dried apricots.   Very good. Everyone enjoyed these great finger foods.

This was very successful.  I mixed the nuts with the cheese and cranberries and added a small amount of Greek yogurt to help them stick together.  I didn't bother with the vinegar because I had done it ahead of time and the guests arrived early.  Next time I'll try it with the vinegar.
