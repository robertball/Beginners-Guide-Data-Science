Instead of using custard cups, I poured it into a 8 1/2 by 11" pan. I baked it at 350 for 45 minutes. It was DELICOUS. A really nice change from plain bread pudding.

OMG!  I have no found a replacement for pumpkin pie this thanksgiving.  This was unbelievable.  I used heavy cream b/c I was planning on using another recipe when I went grocery shopping.  I also used Challah bread which I think made a difference.  I tripled the recipe and made it in a 9x13 pan.  Served with vanilla icecream and carmel sauce.  Everyone thought it was HEAVENLY!!!

I am rating this based on ingredients, not preparation directions, because a great recipe can utilize many serving options. I made this in a 2.5 qt casserole dish, with approximately 2x the ingredients. The only reason I adjusted anything was because I had a 12oz can of pumpkin, which is 2 cups, and wanted to use it all. Therefore, I used "about" 2x everything, making it a little more pumpkiny, and with slightly less sugar and milk, and 1 less egg yolk. Finally, I tried raisins instead of chocolate chips, and mixed them into the batter. It was truly fantastic. I look forward to further adjusting this to suit my family's taste in the future, and I plan on making it for the holidays this year. Note: I'm at a high altitude, and I didn't have any problems with this at 350 degrees for 40 minutes.

Very good recipe! I went for broke and used fat-free milk and this still tasted fantastic. I doubled the recipe and made this in a 9x13 pan. The only difference was I used 4 whole eggs rather than 2 eggs and 6 egg yolks.  I used pumpkin pecan bread, which I think really made this good. I also took a frosting recipe from a cinnamon roll recipe and spread it over the pudding fresh out of the oven and sprinkled a little brown sugar over the top. I omitted the chocolate chips. The family loved this! Definitely going to make again.

Wonderful....I added a little more pumpkin, maybe an other half cup.....really, really great!! Freezes well.   But we took the rest out of freezer the next day and baked it and it was gone in no time fast... I had doubled the reciepe!!! Next time I think that I will leave the chocolate chips off and add raisins to the bread pudding mixture....

This was yummy.  I am hosting Thanksgiving for about 20 people this year so since it's the end of September, my husband & I thought we should start thinking about what we will serve and test out some recipes before we serve anything new.  I made a few adjustments...I used a regular casserole dish instead of individual ramekins.  Also did not use cloves at all and instead of whole milk, I had a container of half and half to use up.  Very good!  When I make it in a casserole dish again, I will double the recipe.  Also, instead of chocolate chips I added some of the little Heath bar toffee bits to the top.  Hubby ate almost half the dish last night with some Reddi-whip on top. Neither of us is a huge pumpkin lover, but this was very good.

OMG - This is the best pumpkin dessert ever!  I used 1% instead of whole milk and it was still wonderful.  I will definately be making this over and over again.

I doubled the recipe and cooked it in a 9 x 13. I also used challah bread. Very good. I think it could have had a little less cloves.

Delicious!  I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9x13 pan instead of custard cups.  Per other reviewers suggestions I used whole eggs and omitted the chocolate chips.  I also used fat free milk, a whole 15oz can of pumpkin and increased the spices slightly.  I have served it with both whipped cream and custard and have gotten rave reviews!

I had never made bread pudding before and decided to try this because my family loves anything pumpkin.  I made it exactly as written. This was so good and so easy to make.  I will be making this again-especially around the holidays!

Fantastic!!!  I only made a few changes: used Soy Milk (it's what I had), used French bread from Panera (mmmmm....) and I cooked it on low in my crockpot for 3 hours.  Probably should've cooked it for 4 hours because I tripled the recipe, but it was still a huge, and delicious, hit!

Excellent Recipe!! I made this for a company potluck and everyone raved about how delicious it was (even though I even baked it for too long and it was too brown. this was my first time making this). I did make a few modifications though. I used Carnation evaporated milk, doubled the spices, added 1/2 teaspoon ginger. I used normal cheap whole wheat sara lee bread. I also tossed the bread in 1/3 cup of butter before pouring the egg mixture. I let everything sit for 24 hours in the fridge before baking out. I also sprinkled granola and almonds over the pudding right before baking it and I did not add any chocolate chips.

Great hit for dessert - moist but not soupy - I added raisins and chopped pecans for more texture and a pinch of ginger.

As my 3 year old would say "it is tasty". My 15 year old made this today for us. Doubled the recipe and used regular choco chips and skim milk and pumpkin pie spice. Next time will forgo the choco chips.

Wow, is this good!  Made mine with cinnamon swirl bread, whole eggs and skim milk, then omitted the chocolate chips.  Everyone raved about it.  We've found a new holiday dessert favorite!

This was FANTASTIC! Two of my favorite desserts  are bread pudding and pumpkin pie so this was a hit at my house!!!! Neither me or my wife care much for chocolate so I left off the chocolate chips and it was just delicious. I will make it again and again! Thanks for such a great and original recipe!

We really enjoyed this recipe - great mix of flavors and fun to serve in individual ramekins. We used croissants, and that gave it a great flavor. The best part was the topping where the brown sugar and chocolate chips had melted a bit. Next time, I would sprinkle the chips throughout. We served ours warm with a little vanilla ice cream. We will definitely make this again!

I'm not sure how to rate this because my boyfriend told both he and his mother that this was the best dessert he had ever had in his life. I on the other hand though it was kind of gross.... and I'm the chocolate lover... not him! It tasted like a big mushy chocolate chip cookie. The chocolate completely overpowered the pumpkin. I would definitely use more pumpkin, 1 tsp cinnamon, the same amount of cloves and nutmeg, and raisins instead of chocolate chips.

absolutely delicious, and a huge hit this T'giving!  the comments were really helpful; used whole eggs instead of separated ones like koolandblue suggested; baked it in a corningware casserole dish, and omitted choco chips.  i used leftover bread that i'd made a week earlier.  really great flavour and texture -- it may look a little messy or squishy but don't be fooled -- tastes amazing!

I know it's totally unfair to rate a recipe when I've totally changed it, but that's one of the great things about this site - you can get other ideas. I just took this out of the oven, and can't quit "taste testing" it. I think I may have to make another one for the guests!     I used 2 whole eggs, canned pumpkin pie mix, 1 t pumpkin pie spice, left out all of the other spices and chocolate chips. Doubled it in a casserole dish, and sprinkled it with brown sugar and cinnamon. Unbelievable!!

I did not put this in individual ramekins but I did make exactly as written.  I am going to give it 4 stars because I didn't like the chocolate morsals on top.  I felt like this needed a caramel sauce or butterscotch morsals or something different.  I even thought just leaving the morsals off would have been better.  Other than that, I thought it was very tasty.  Something different....I will definitely make this again but I will change it up a little.

Delicious alternative to pumpkin pie.  Instead of individual spices, I just used a tsp of pumpkin pie spice.  I also left off the chocolate chips and served with caramel sauce, vanilla ice cream and whipped cream.  NOM NOM NOM!

My only changes - I added some vanilla and I used 2 eggs and 2% milk.  Well, I used 6 eggs actually cuz I X3'ed it.  I made enough for a 9X13 to take with me over the weekend, and then another 8x8 to leave here at home with the family.  I am not expecting any leftovers in either pan :-)

Omitted the chocolate chips (didn't have any) and added an extra cup and a half of bread cubes as it appeared pretty runny as written.  Overall, pretty good texture and taste.

I doubled the recipe and baked it in a round casserole dish. It took over 1.5 hrs to cook and was a tad mushy inside but excellent flavor. Next time I'll put it in a lasagna pan and use a bit less milk and egg. Yum yum!

I made this today & it was pretty good, even my granddaughter liked it. I served it warm with a scoop of french vanilla ice cream on top. I did make a few adjustments. I used all of the whole egg, dark chocolate chips, condensed milk, & italian bread. I mixed the brown sugar & chocolate chips in with the rest of the items. I will definitely be making this again.

This recipe is good, but could use some minor changes. I would probably cut the cloves amount in half and increase the cinnamon by half. Also, maybe add a little bit of ginger? I happened to have some left over cream cheese frosting from something else I baked and small spoon of that on it was perfect.

Made exactly as written - absolutely delicious!  Using individual ramekins is great because each one is a single serving.  If you make it in a pan you'll be tempted to eat half the thing in one sitting because it is SO good.

OMG! Who knew - pumpkin + chocolate= YUM?!  I used 2 whole eggs and 2% milk and I don't believe it made a bit of difference in taste.  Only change I made was to quadruple the cinnamon as I love it.  I don't have custard cups so just used my glass 9 X 13 baking dish, baking it for the 40 min.  Came out wonderful!  My son now wants this for Thanksgiving instead of pumpkin pie!  Thanks so much!!

This is a great seasonal bread pudding.   We especially loved the pumpkin/spice flavors!!!  This could be a great dessert as well as breakfast dish.  I didn't have large custard cups so I baked them in large size muffin tin.  No need to put tin into water.  It baked just fine.  No changes were made other than I added half cinnamon swirl bread and half plain white bread.  We loved it and will definitely make this again!!

I love Pumpkin and this was really delicious.  I used Libby's Pumpkin Pie canned mix because it was what I had on hand and added a shake or two of pumpkin pie spice.  The amount of egg mixture to bread was perfect for me... I like a pudding texture more than a dry bread texture in a bread pudding - very moist and tasty.  I will try it exactly as is the next time - thanks for sharing!  Will be made at my house often - definitely during the fall months.

I made this bread pudding this evening and it was one of the best desserts I've ever come across.  I picked up a loaf of artisan style white bread at my local bakery (I think it was an italian bread), cut it into 1-2" chunks and dried it out a little in the oven before putting the custard over it.  I cooked it in a glass cake pan and left out the chocolate chips.  The best part of this dish is the little crisp brule on the top from where I sprinkled the brown sugar.    I ate this with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and some caramel sauce.  I will DEFINITELY make it again!!

This is so delicious! I just ate two bowls BEFORE dinner right after it came out of the oven, so I probably ruined my dinner tonight.  I don't care for pumpkin pie, but here the pumpkin flavor is not strong. After making Pumpkin Apple Streusel Muffins (from allrecipes), I had just less than a cup of pumpkin left from the can, and this was a perfect way to use it up. I used 2 eggs instead of 1 egg and 3 yolks, and I totally forgot the chocolate chips, but it doesn't need them.  Baked in a casserole dish 7x10 for 45 min.  (Here's the vanilla sauce I made to go on top: 1/2 c sugar, 1 Tbs cornstarch, whisk together in a pan, stir in 1/2 c water,  boil 1 min. stirring constantly. Remove from heat and stir in 2 Tbs butter and 1 tsp vanilla. Serve warm.) This is definitely a great Autumn dessert!

I love bread pudding and this one is perfect for the fall.  I used 2 eggs instead of the separate yolks.  Otherwise I stuck with the recipe.  I added a little vanilla glaze at the end, but it was just as good without.  My kids had whipped cream instead and loved it.  I will definately be making this again - possibly again this week.  Love, love, love it!

My alterations:  2 whole eggs instead of the  one egg and 3 egg yolks the recipe calls for, 2% milk (what I had on hand), 1/3 cup sugar, 1 cup pumpkin.  Also, I didn't use chocolate chips at all, but found the brown sugar a very nice addition to the tops of the pudding.  I doubled the cinnamon, halved the nutmeg and kept the cloves the same, but the clove flavor was overwhelming so I'll half or eliminate the cloves if I make again.

I thought this recipe was very good, it's just not my favorite type of dessert.  It was easy to make, and turned out fluffy, creamy and the flavors blended together nicely.  I think I would prefer something with a little stronger pumpkin flavor.  Still, if you're looking for a Pumpkin Pie alternative, this is one to try.

Win-win!  The delicious taste of pumpkin pie and the comfort feeling of bread pudding all in one! I did not add the chocolate chips.  I forgot to add the brown sugar before baking, but sprinkled it on when out of the oven. Very good!

We love bread pudding in general and this one is one of our favorite in Fall season. I make it easier by using 2 whole large eggs instead of 1 whole and 3 yolks, and I like to mix in the chocolate chips which I use a  hand full of  ( it doesn't need to be exactly  3/8 of cup :-) )
Also, when ever I make any bread pudding I use what ever stale bread I have around. That would usually be a piece of a French baguette, the last English muffin in the bread box, a leftover hamburger or hot dog bun, and  complete the required amount for the recipe with toast bread. The same way I make "clean the fridge soup" to use all the  1 or 2 pieces of different vegetables in the fridge, I make  bread pudding to clean my bread box..

I took some of your tips, and I did double the recipe and make in a casserole dish (baked for 50 minutes and it was perfect) and I omitted the choc chips, and put raisins in.  The real clincher for this dessert? I put a salted caramel sauce that I make over it, and a dollop of freshly whipped cream.  The guests at my dinner party LOVED it and went for seconds.

I LOVE the addition of pumpkin in this recipe! But I skip the chocolate chips and sub in raisins. I also use all brown sugar in place of the white, use just a dash of cloves and bake in a casserole dish instead of individual cups. Great recipe that my family adores and a nice little twist on traditional bread pudding

This is a fine recipe, but my two-star rating is because the cloves, in my opinion, need to be cut in half, at least. If you like a strong cloves flavor, you'll love it.

First time making any kind of bread pudding and it turned out surprisingly great!  I doubled the recipe, used the whole 15oz can of pumpkin and an extra cup or 2 of buttermilk bread cubes (thought there was too much batter).  Baked in a 13x9 pan for about an hour until the knife came out clean.  Forgot the brown sugar on top but made whip cream and it was sweet enough.  It was custardy but firm, great pumpkin pie taste.  Would definitely make again, great way to use up day old bread.

Thanks for this recipe! I love bread pudding, but I've never been a huge fan of pumpkin. I loved this. I made it for my fiancée who has been craving something with pumpkin. He loved it and ate it with buttered pecan ice cream. I used honey wheat bread as it was what I had one hand. I also made a yogart maple glaze to go on top. It was awesome!!! TY again!!!

This was delish. I doubled everything except the cloves and cooked it in a large casserole. I mixed the choc chips in, but didn't think they added anything. I also used 1 loaf of raisin cinnamon bread and a couple of slices of bakery white bread.

Wonderful! Did in 9x13 pan. Doubled almost everything, used 4 whole eggs, used 1% milk. Used 1 loaf of white/italian sliced bread. Used butternut squash. So good! Took to a brunch the week before Thanksgiving. Hardly any leftovers.

Used three eggs and 1% milk, 1/2 t. cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg.    Still turned out fantastic.  My family is already requesting it again!

I followed it exactly by the recipe.  Not bad, but I think people raved over it more than I am about to.  My only complaint is that the cloves are WAY too overpowering.  I would much rather the cinnamon and sugar stand out.  Also, a handy suggestion is that a muffin pan works just as well if you don't have custard cups.  I sat it in a dish of water, because I didn't know if that step made a difference.  It cooked well.  If I make this again,  I will follow the recipe, but eliminate cloves completely.

I gave it a 4 because I made some changes, first I thought it was delish, and a welcome change from pie! I used 3 whole eggs, 1 can of evaporated milk, 1 can of pumpkin, and 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice and butterscotch chips. I baked it in a casserole dish, so I had to bake longer about 1 hour! I will make again Thanks!

Wow - this was delicious! I had some leftover cinnamon raisen bagels that were going stale so I used those instead of bread. Fantastic! Really great pumpkin flavor and I served with caramel sauce and whipped cream to make these over the top. I baked in a 9 x 9 ceramic dish. Thank you for another great way to use up leftover pumpkin!

Fantastic!!! Made it in a glass deep pie dish, with butternut squash instead of pupmkin, (Cant find any in Spain).  Used 1 cup skim milk and 3/4 cup of light cream and white chocolate insted of milk chocolate.  The best bread pudding I´ve had yet, thank you for such a wonderful recipe!

I loved this! I prefer it without the chocolate chips. Instead I pour caramel sauce over it before serving. It is delicious and so easy! I will be making this recipe for many years, I'm sure!

This was tasty, and would be great for a holiday party.  I'd serve it in small portions, as the flavor does become overpowering if you serve larger portions.  I made a 9" x 9" casserole dish for my husband and I, but we never finished it.  We got tired of it after the second time we dished it up.

These were delicious! I'd made ramekins in pottery class and this was the first thing I made in them. I only made four and used egg substitute, low-cal bread, and skim milk, and this was still really tasty!

This was a very tasty way to use the second half of the can of pumpkin. Like others, I used one large pan instead of individual cups and it cooked about 45 minutes for me. I made a few changes that were fine: instead of milk I used one cup half and half and 1/2 cup Greek yogurt, omitted chocolate chips, and doubled the cinnamon and vanilla. I also topped with a confectioner's sugar glaze when it cooled. Thank you for the great recipe!!

So delicious!  After looking at many other pumpkin bread pudding recipes, I chose this one because it seemed the easiest to make and had pretty basic ingredients.  I doubled the recipe,  cut back the sugar slightly (mixed brown sugar with regular sugar), left out the chocolate chips and baked it in an 8" x 11" baking pan.  I lost track of the baking time - it took about an hour and we knew it was cooked when the knife came out clean.  We are really enjoying this pudding and even tastes better the next day.

I used my cast iron instead of cups and did double the batch. I added ginger instead of cloves. Also didn't want to waste the egg whites so I made a meringue for the top. It was so good. Thank you very much!

Excellent recipe.  I made this for a dinner party and made it in the morning so all I had to do was pop it in the oven when we sat down to eat.  Letting is soak for hours work out great!  I baked it in a oval 8x5 corning dish, and left out the cloves since I didn't have them.  We served it warm with vanilla almond milk ice cream.  Everyone raved about it.  You can alter to suit your own tastes.  Love this recipe and will be making it again!

I would skip the chocolate chips next time. They made this a bit too sweet, and also buried the pumpkin flavor. I'm thinking pecans or walnuts instead would be perfect. I also didn't have custard cups, so I baked mine in an 8x8 pan (still in a water bath) and it came out great. All in all, good bones to this recipe though.

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it!  I subbed lite coconut milk for cows milk as my husband is lactose intolerant, used day old whole wheat sandwich rolls,  used 3 whole eggs and left out the chocolate chips.  I also baked in 9" dish rather than individual cups. I made warm rum sauce, forgot it until half way thru dessert but no problem.  It's a def keeper.  Thanks for sharing!

I've made this a few times now, and always tastes great.  Changes I make... double the recipe, but no chocolate (as i don't think it needs more sweetness). I cook in 8.5X11" pan, raise the temp up to 375 and bake until toothpick comes out clean (approx 45 min).  tasty!

I am feel like I followed the instructions exactly, but it came out bland like there was not enough sweetness to it. I may try it again but I will use something else to sweeten it up a bit.

Followed the recipe pretty closely. I oroginally chose because I had leftover egg yolks to use, so the pudding/custard idea was good. Instead of individual cups I baed mine in a casserole. It was a little hard to judge doneness, but after 45 minutes & a clean tester I thought it was fine. Everyone liked it, but I was not thrilled with the texture i.e., too soupy. Maybe next time I'll use stale bread & a more shallow pan, but I will try it again since it was pretty tasty.

So, so good! I wasn't sure about the chocolate on top and so I skipped that and sprinkled raisins on top before baking. That didn't go so well, they kind of charred, but I just picked them off and we ate it without them. It was fantastic. It's perfectly sized to take as a dessert to a small dinner party, 4 or 6 people tops. Anything more than that and you'll have to double it. I baked it in an 8x8 dish for 45 minutes and it came out perfect. Next time I may mix the raisins in, or I may try it with the chocolate and see how that goes too. Overall, very easy, and very good!

I had made something similar to this several years ago, but couldn't find the recipe and this one was similar enough that I tried it. Absolutely scrumptious! Because I was serving this at a dinner party, I had to make it ahead of time. When it came time to serve, we simply popped the custard cups in the microwave for about 30 seconds to warm them up and then topped with rum-infused heavy whipped cream. I remembered the original recipe called for challah bread, which I could not find at two different supermarket bakeries. Instead I used sweet French bread, which worked wonderfully. I also used 3/4 cup 1% milk and 3/4 cup fat-free half and half, which worked just fine for the whole milk.

Made this today....doubled the recipe since I wanted to use the whole 15 oz can of pumpkin.  I used 4 whole eggs as another reviewer suggested.  Replaced chocolate chips with raisins and added a couple extra slices of bread to make it a little drier.  I needed it drier because I baked in mini muffins tins, hoping to make it a "finger food"....hoping they set up a little firmer from the extra bread.  Delish!

Outstanding!  I was worried that I ruined it because I accidently put in twice as much nutmeg.  I also cut back on the brown sugar.  I omitted the choco chips this time, but will try it in the future.

I did not care for this at all.  I made it exactly as stated and found there was too much egg mixture for the amount of bread cubes.
