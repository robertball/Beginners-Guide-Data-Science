This recipe was a God send as they are a favorite of my husband, but unheard of in this part of the country. I cut the recipe in half for a small dinner party.  My guests enjoyed them with Kaluha, Bailey's, and/or brandy.  This is not a "make ahead" recipe as the egg whites will disolve over time and the fluff makes the drink.

Absolutely great recipe for Tom and Jerry's.  As mentioned, do not make ahead, but this is simply wonderful for holiday parties.  Very yummy, and you can adjust the alcohol to taste.  It even tastes good with no alcohol for any children or under 21 guests at your gathering.

Tom and Jerrys are so yummie! I have also made them a different way.whip some whipping cream and fold into the beaten egg whites and instead of hot milk....use hot water. Very good too.

This was a nice after dinner treat.  I cut the recipe to two servings and used an electric mixer to make the egg whites frothy.  It wasn't as creamy as I would have liked (personal preference), so next time I will use cream in place of milk.  Perhaps, Bailey's, as  others suggested, would also make it creamier.  Thank you Verushka for sharing your recipe!

My aunt made the best I have ever had and her batter lasted for days, You filled a cup with batter, and a shot of liquor, rum, whiskey whatever you wanted, then put your boiling water in to fill all the way to the top and ate with a spoon until you reached the liquid with the liquor which was still at least warm yummy never could get the batter as stiff as she got it and keep as long but it was good and the kids liked it with just the boiled water added to batter when they were little
