I only made the sauce from this recipe and it is wonderful.  We had 10 people for dinner with a Tenderloin and everyone asked me for the recipe.  I made this dish the night before and to warm it I placed it over a pan of water and heated.  I did use more Gorgonzola cheese than the recipe calls for.  Cut back on quantities because it's so rich people only take a little bit.

I think this is sinfully good.  To the negative reviews on the calories... HELLO!! It doesn't take a genius to see it's a rich recipe but to rate it poorly for that reason is nonsense.  Thanks for a great recipe! :)

I made this with less parmesan cheese (simply b/c of preference) and half and half instead of heavy cream to reduce the richness but added cayenne pepper to give the sauce a kick. In addition I sliced the tenderloin into small half dollar size pieces and plated them along with potato pancakes. Everyone had a second helping

Rich and delicious! Definitely not for those counting calories! I made this for two filets so I cut back on the sauce. This is one of those sauces that you have to do to your tastes. I used one cup of light cream and brought it to a boil and let it reduce a bit. I used two to three ounces of gorgonzola cheese and about three tsp. of parmesan cheese. I added salt, pepper, nutmeg, and a bit of cayenne. I added the crumbled bacon right to the sauce. I seasoned the filets as we usually do for grilling. Once they came off I poured a bit of the sauce over top then topped them off with sliced green onion. Perfect with grilled baked potaotes and a garden salad!

I made this for Christmas and it was a BIG success! The only thing I would do different is cook the sauce first and let it cool and then spread onto the steak when they are done. I had no left overs just them wanting more! Thank you very much for sharing.

I use cream of mushroom soup with skim milk whisked in to make up volume instead of cream here. I also add some sliced mushrooms near the end of cooking, and increase the Gorgonzola a bit (okay and I add a bit of garlic... I love my garlic!). Make sure to use a nice, high quality cheese. I tried it once with an amazing goat Gorgonzola, and another time with a cheaper pre-crumbled variety. You can definitely taste the difference and I think I'd have to double the cheaper one to get the same flavour out of it.

Seriously amazing.  The only change we made was using chives in place of the green onions because we have a ton of those growing in our garden.  YUM!!!!

This was amazing!  Soooooo good.  I was able to make the sauce ahead of time, which was nice.  I used a little more cheese (maybe 5 oz.) and it was a little much, so I added a little more heavy cream.  I also omitted the nutmeg.  Can't wait to make it again!

I have made this twice now. The first time I let the sauce "reduce" for an hour but the sauce seemed really running in the end. I decided to try it again and let it cook down longer. What a difference!!!!!  It took about 90 minutes to reduce the cream. I used 3 cups of cream instead of four and in the end still had enough sauce to serve another 4 people! The sauce was wonderful. I highly recommend it.

I let this simmer for about an hour and 15 minutes. it did only reduce by about a third. In my opinion it could have used a lot more gorgonzola as i found this to be quite bland. i don't know if it is because i did not add the nutmeg ( i cant stand nutmeg) or what, but nothing I need to rush to make again.

This is to-die-for good!! But I think the sauce is what makes this recipe - I almost give it top marks for the gorgonzola cream sauce alone!

The sauce is heavenly.  I couldn't get it to reduce even with cooking for over an hour, so it was kind of a thin sauce, but I probably just had too big of a batch going.  It didn't matter, it still tasted great.   I made this with tenderloin cut into filets in the recipe, but I also served the sauce with sauteed chicken breast chunks with butter and fresh grated parmesan (mother-in-law doesn't eat red meat), and the sauce complimented the parmesan chicken sooo well.  Will definitely make again with steak or chicken. Yum.

Amazing recipe! My husband is a huge fan of bacon, so we also wrapped the filet in bacon before grilling.  I fried the bacon for a minute or two before wrapping the steak with it because I like my steak very rare and was afraid the bacon wouldn't be cooked enough.  It worked out perfect.

Used Danish Blue cuz it was on hand. Scaled and had less heavy cream than I thought so ended up half that and filled in with half and half.  Didn't boil, just simmered, didn't need near the time to reduce, in fact I had to add more half and half to thin once ready to plate.

This was great. I cooked and let cool down quite a bit before pouring over beef and it did thinken up. I also added a little more gorgonzola, just a bit more, which is strange for me because I'm not a big fan of gorgonzola. I also decided to wrap the filets in bacon rather than chop. Will make this again. I served with herb angel hair pasta and garlic brocoli rabe.  Fabulous! Thanks!

Absolutley LOVE this sauce. It's perfect. Not necessary to use heavy cream, I use 5% every time and it turns out fantastic! Makes a lot but leftovers are so good on pasta. My family/friends actually prefer this sauce on pork tenderloin rather than steak.

This is the first recipe I've rated.  My husband kept raving about it!  We always rate our experimental meals 1-10 and I don't think any meal has been rated over an 8....We gave this meal a 10!  We cut the recipe in half, but still had an abundance of sauce.  I'll just have to find what else goes with gorgonzola sauce!

So good.  This is one of my favorite meals.  A local restaurant makes a filet with gorgonzola cheese, rock shrimp and asparagus.    I steam the asparagus and shrimp, grill the filet, put it in the center of the plate, put a few shrimp and asparagus around the steak, and drizzle the sauce over all of it.  Thanks for the recipe.  10 stars!  I recommend making the augratin  potato recipe on here.  Just search for garlic augratin potatoes, and sort by rating.  It's the highest rated one on here.  Complements the fillet just perfectly.

I made this last week for me and my boyfriend, and he freaked out; it was so good! We both agreed we had never eaten a better homemade steak. To make the meal for two, I used 2 cups of cream but still 3 ounces of gorgonzola cheese (the perfect, perfect sauce). I also pan-seared the steaks instead of grilling them. They were so delicious! Sided with garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus, this is a meal that I'm sure I will use again, especially if I'm trying to impress someone. (: Thanks for sharing!!!

absolutely scrumptious! I prepared this "recipe-as is" except 1 oz. more gorgozola.  It's fabulous and my husband agrees.  This makes such a large amount of cheese sauce that I used the remainder in the sauce for penne pasta with grilled chicken breast the next night! Just added grilled chicken and steamed coursley chopped broccoli. Perfect a second time!!

Great...one of the best steak sauces we've ever had.  We recalculated the recipe for 2 but the sauce, bacon & onion was enough for 4.

Found this to be a very good basic recipe.. I had leftover crawfish left from a seafood boil that I added to it so eliminated the black pepper totally since would be crawfish were spicy & I used blue cheese crumbles for the cheese.

Best recipe I've made in years!! I could put this sauce over cereal, it's that good! I will be making this one again and again.

One tip...do not add cheese and spices to reduced cream until the steak is done and resting.

I use flank steak instead of filet.  Slice thin on a plate, drizzle with cream sauce, sprinkle with onion and bacon. Makes a beautiful presentation and tastes fabulous!

I made the recipe as is. The key to the sauce is using a wide-bottomed pan....more surface area for the heavy cream to evaporate. I started with a smaller pan and it was taking forever (like other reviews said). As soon as I switched to a large pan it reduced by half quickly!
Make sure you really like gorgonzola cheese before you make it. The sauce was very strong. I only used about 1/4 of the sauce on our fillets and it was plenty!

I followed this recipe EXACTLY (for 2 servings) and it absolutely delicious.  My boyfriend told me this dish was "restaurant" quality.  I served this with grilled asparagus and that was plenty.  The Gorgonzola cream sauce is very rich, so the asparagus was the perfect compliment.  The only thing I would change would be to cut the sauce ingredients in half.  It only takes a small amount for each filet, so it was a shame to throw out what wasn't used.

This is amazing!  I do add 1/8 tsp of cayenne pepper.  I usually have 1/2 left over and make it with grilled vegetables (asparagus, red pepper and squash) mixed with bowtie pasta.  Thank you very much for posting this.

I made this the other day.  The flavors worked beautifully together. (but I left out the salt, my preference).  My husband & I enjoyed it with a glass of Merlot.  We both said (at the same time),  that I should make this again.  I would love to make this for a small dinner party. Thanks for sharing....

This was fantastic!  The heavy cream did take a full hour, if not more, to reduce.  I accidentally (don't ask) added 4 ounces of Gorgonzola instead of 3, but it worked.  Our dinner guests were happy people.  I have a vegetarian daughter, so I made some pasta, and one of our guests put the sauce on some of it...and loved it.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

I made this for Valentines day and it was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly as far as ingredients but I did use less cream to make a smaller quantity of the sauce (there were only 2 of us). I just eyeballed the Gorgonzola & Parmesan according to my taste and just added until i got the consistency I wanted (and it didn't take a full hour to get the cream to reduce/thicken nicely- I only used about 1.5 cups and we had plenty of sauce for 2 people to use generously). It's very flavorful & rich- definitely my favorite cream sauce I've ever eaten on a steak! I wasn't sure about the nutmeg- I like it but my husband doesn't - however I went for it & we didn't notice it in the finished product. However, the sauce was so good, I will make it exactly the same next time as I can only assume it's in there for a reason! I also seasoned the steaks according to this recipe and would follow this again- I did them stove top in my grilling pan. I paired this with roasted asparagus and the whole meal was a success. Great recipe for a special occasion at home- yet, it wasn't difficult, only took me about 40min start to finish so it was feasible for a working mom with a toddler to pull off with little hassle.  *we don't care much for onions, so I garnished the top with the bacon crumbles & a little fresh parsley which added color and also seemed to work nicely with the cream sauce.  Can't wait to make this again!

Do not, I repeat, do not try to substitute fat free half and half in this recipe.  I will try it again one of these days with heavy cream.  The only reason I gave this two stars is because it's my own darn fault!

This sauce is really good and a nice way to dress up steak. It makes a lot and is very rich so I'll probably try cutting the recipe in half next time. I wasn't paying attention and the cream boiled over so keep an eye on that! I also added Cajun seasoning as I thought the sauce was a bit bland without it. Have made several times and really enjoyed it, thanks for the recipe!

This sauce is delicious.  You just have to use it immediately because if you let it sit, it starts to thicken up pretty quickly. I used this on filet mignon with mushrooms and my husband loved it commenting, "Wow, what I do to deserve this special meal?" I will be making again, but will probably try on other cuts of steak and chicken too.

This is very good, something like you'd get in a 5 star restaraunt!  I added cayenne to spice it up just a tad.  I'd suggest cutting the recipe in half b/c it makes way more than you need for 4 steaks.  However, I reheated the leftovers slowly on the stove, using a small whisk and it came out perfectly~

It was OK. It did not add to the flavor of the meat. Won't make again.

I only used the sauce from this recipe and it was fantastic! For our tenderloin just sprinkled on steak seasoning and grilled.

I'm giving this 3 stars b/c for the amount of time this took it wasn't worth it. Good flavor but I had to add  much more gorgonzola than what was called for

OK, so I changed the recipe.  so shoot me for rating it 5 stars but I can't help it.  with the few small changes that I made this was AMAZING!  As another reviewer suggested I used only 1 cup cream with the full amounts of everything else.  I did add a pinch of cayenne but couldn't even taste it anyways.  the only slight problem I had was that the sauce did not thicken even with the reduced amt of cream.  Ended up adding probably a bit more than a T cornstarch.  Perfect.  Nice and  thick, good flavour, especially with the bacon and green onions.  for my steaks I wrapped them in bacon and broiled them after brushing with some olive oil, salt and pepper.  To die for!

I made this for New Year's Eve dinner and it was fabulous! The only changes I made was to the sauce- I used half n half and reduced fat gorgonzola simply because that is what I had on hand. The sauce does take one hour - and needs 'hand holding' so plan to spend the time. And, don't forget the nutmeg- it's a must. This is a 5 star dish suitable for a special occasion.

This sauce was awesome - it did take some time to reduce down, but well worth it.  The gorgonzola was not overpowering but rich and delicious.  We enjoyed the sauce on the sides we prepared as well - asparagus & baked potato.  It was a wonderful Valentines Meal - at a fraction of the restaurant cost.

This sauce was amazing! We were practically drinking it.  Even my 16 yr old daughter loved it.   I followed the recipe exactly except I used blue cheese instead of the milder Gorgonzola.  Easy to make too- so try it!

My daughter, who is NOT a cook, surprised me with this for my birthday dinner. When I heard what she had made I was prepared to order pizza but instead was blown away! It was incredible! As another reviewer said, the sauce is amazing would be excellent on many other things. Thanks for sharing a recipe that made a novice look like a pro! It has become my requested birthday dinner now.

Incredible! Followed recipe exactly except added 1Tbls. Cajun seasoning to the sauce for a little flavor. Only complaint, grilling steaks to 130 degrees, then tenting for 8 minutes brought them to medium well (we used thick fillets). Next time, will cook less.

The sauce is great it tastes almost exactly like an olive garden sauce I love. I put my meat in the crock pot for 3 hours on high to make it real tender.

I make a recipe for a gorgonzola sauce/fondue to serve with garlic crostini. I use equal measures of heavy cream/gorgonzola cheese. Reduce the cream by half and add cheese. I expect it would be very light on the cheesy taste with this ratio which is the reason most people are adding more. I am not going to skew the rating for this recipe as I haven't made it.

This was simple and yummy!  I used Montreal Seasoning on my steaks because I always do- but otherwise made the recipe as is.  The sauce made a great spread for leftover sandwiches as well.  Thanks for the recipe!

It was restaurant quality! Next time, I'll decrease the amount of cream by half; just too much sauce left over! Otherwise I'll be making it again!

I made this for my husband and I.  The sauce was delicious!  It didn't take quite as long for the heavy cream to reduce, but I kept my eye on it so it wouldn't burn.  I'm looking forward to making this for guests one day soon.

My sauce didn't turn out well because I used a cream starter instead. By the time hubby got the steaks off the grill it was as thick as paste.  Both hub by and grandson said it tasted good but I was underwhelmed. Next time use nonfat half and half and thicken if necessary. Also I think I prefer the flavor of blue cheese instead of Gorgonzola to compliment the rich steaks. Maybe next time I'll just use crumbled blue cheese on the steaks or hamburger just before it comes off the grill.  Less calories and a complimentary flavor with beef.  Or combine blue cheese with Panko and put under the broiler for a minute or two.

Absolutely delectable!! I got the filet mignon steaks from the Fresh Market, and the quantity of the steak was Un-Real. The sauce? AMAZING! The Gorgonzola cheese mixed with the parmesan was so gooood! Served with steamed asparagus, baked potatoes & French bread.

I followed directions exactly as written and couldn't have been happier. I'm all about flavor and this recipe is full of flavor. How could you go wrong, bacon, thick cream with cheese flavor with onions. The wife loved this and so did I. I will make this again and will try with chicken breasts as well. Thanks for the recipe. This was really outstanding for me to rate 5 stars.

I made just the sauce and poured over bacon wrapped filet mignon and grilled asparagus; it was a huge hit. My family loved it! Will definitely make again!

My boyfriend is a big gorgonzola fan and I decided to make this one night for dinner. I actually used a little more gorgonzola than the recipe called for and we were not disappointed. I will be making this recipe in the future.

So delicious!! Used a New York strip. Doesn't overwhelm taste buds but pushing them to the limit of satisfactory!  Didn't add the nutmeg but so good thanks for the recipe.

I don't have a nice outdoor grill, so I cook the steaks in the broiler for only 2-3 minutes per side.  The cream didn't turn out that well for me (hence the three stars); it was still runny after an hour of simmering. In retrospect, I would use only three cups of cream and add cornstarch to speed up the thickening process.

This is delicious!!!! It took just over an hour and we ate it in minutes it was so good!  Love the sauce!  We had some fresh New Jersey corn and asparagus on the side and the flavors came together nicely.  Certainly not an inexpensive meal but well worth it!

My dad and I made this for Christmas dinner. The sauce was a pain in the , but MAN was it good. The only people in the family who aren't demanding it every year are the people who generally do the cooking and were humbled by the deliciousness. Not difficult, and the leftovers made by far the best mac'n'cheese I've ever had. Unfortunately, regular steak and mac'n'cheese are ruined for me now.

Amazing. FABULOUS. Better than any steak I've ever had in my life. Everything is there... the different array of flavors, the different textures, the exquisite sauce. I don't think I'd do anything different.

Do NOT do heaping scoops of the cheese though. Follow the recipe to the smidgeon, otherwise it's imbalanced.

Using food available in the fridge I substituted blue cheese and grilled rib eye steak. I did not have any bacon. Oh well. 

I had lots of cream sauce leftover so we grilled steaks again a few days later. 

Tasted great.

Made it with mashed potatoes and garlic string beans.  It was a perfect meal.  I might consider throwing some butter in the pan with the steak and vegetable oil next time.

I used this recipe for the cream sauce itself (my husband grills the steaks :) and it was delicious, but I used half of the cream, 5 oz. of the cheese, and the same amount of the rest of the ingredients as I wanted a thicker sauce.  It was delicious and turned out exactly as I wanted.  I thought the nutmeg was an unusual addition, but it gave it a really nice flavor.  Even though I halved the amount of cream, I still had quite a bit left over, so I steamed some broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots and mixed it in with them, and that worked well too.  The sauce is delicious and versatile, and I would definitely like to make it again.

The sauce did take longer than the recipe said in order to reduce by half.  When I made it with my filets, I liked it.  I came here to say that when I had the leftover sauce with chicken, I liked it even better!  Made the full recipe of sauce if not more, because you can eat it on anything!  Well, any meat at least.

It was delicious. Couldn't find Gorgonzola cheese in my area so I used Brie cheese. It was amazing. Would love to try it with Gorgonzola cheese.

Made this sauce last night for my wife for Valentines day.  But instead of using Gorgonzola, I used Smoked Gouda!!  I'm sure the Gorgonzola is good but the smoked flavor of the Gouda along with the lemon asparagus was perfect.  My wife sopped up the sauce.  Very good!

Used three cups heavy cream and more Gorgonzola. No nutmeg. So delicious , really didn't need to bother with the bacon and scallions.

The Gorgonzola sauce is incredible, one of the best things I've ever tasted.

This sauce (with the addition of nutmeg) is Ina Garten's recipe and it is absolutely delicious! It's wonderful on beef and would probably be great on asparagus or green beans, too.

Observations:

Despite following the recipe exactly, sauce was consistency of milk when pouring over steaks. I didn't wash my pans after dinner--don't judge ;-)--and, next morning, the remaining sauce in the pot was thickened and what I would consider the correct consistency. So, IF I made this again, I'd allow time after cooking for it to sit and, hopefully thicken.

Speaking of there being remaining sauce--this recipe makes A LOT of sauce. I served a family of 5 and still had LOTS left over. I'd probably half it next time.

I've seen other commenters mention it and so did my (adult) son: it's bland.  I'd add some spices to increase flavor.  Or, as my son suggested, try it again using bleu cheese instead of Gorgonzola.

I made mine in a cast iron skillet for Valentine's Day and I came...so did my husband. It was so good and so filling we decided to sleep for the rest of the evening.

Recipe was really good. I made this for a small New Year's Eve get together. We all used the sauced sparingly so it wouldn't overburden the steak. If you do the same, prepare for a lot of leftover sauce. As a side recommendation, the leftover sauce goes well in an omelet with any leftover bacon and chives you may have left over as well.

This is a wonderful recipe, although I used ribeyes in lieu of the filets.  The cream sauce is very good, but I believe that it could easily be cut in half, as we had quite a bit leftover.  This is a definite keeper in our house.  Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome!!!  Made tonight, and the only thing I forgot was the green onion....didn't need it.  Bacon I used was ready made kind and just crumbled ontop.   The filets we made inside (storms) so we preheated the gas oven to 425 and baked 9 minutes each side, and they came out medium rare which is what we were aiming for, too rare and hubby gets grossed out.   Sauce I made in a medium stainless steel sauce pan with a copper bottom and it only took 40-45 minutes to reduce once I got to the right temp.  And as another reviewer noted  this is a "to taste"sauce and you either add or reduce the cheeses and salt/pepper to your liking, but the nutmeg makes it so don't omit it, taste the sauce while adding the ingredients.   Made with farro and asparagus, the sauce was great on the asparagus.

Very yummy! I love recipes that involve the grill.
Like an idiot, I stopped watching the cream and it boiled over. It didn't thicken up like I thought it would, but if I let things boil over, I guess I am not that great of a cook. I would make again!

I made this recipe for our contest in school! It was awesome! I am a culinary student and our head chefs loved the dish! The texture of the sauce and flavor was perfect. The fillet mignon was so great(setting in foil really worked) it was medium cooked. I was so happy that the chefs loved it! It was an achievement..Thank you Shawnalton and allrecipes.

INCREDIBLE SAUCE--MUST TRY!! This sauce is so yummy & even my picky husband loved and requests every time we have filet steaks. I have even made the sauce to drizzle over chicken and it was amazing!! This was really easy to make and I feel like its impossible to mess it up...comes out perfect every time. Thanks for sharing!
