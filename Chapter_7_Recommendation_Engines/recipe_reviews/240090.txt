This really is the easiest smoothie ever. Two ingredients...not much that can go wrong here! The consistency was perfect for my tastes and I liked that it wasn't too sweet like a lot of smoothies can be. None of my stores sell 16oz cans of pineapple. It's either 8 or 20oz, and obviously the 8oz size is what is required for 1 serving. (Just an FYI for those looking for 16oz cans.) This is easily customizable with other fruits, or by adding a scoop of whey protein. Thank you j9tomas, i'll be making this one often!

Four stars because I added 1T of agave syrup to sweeten. Really enjoyed it that way. Very easy to make.

It was quick to make and tasted pretty good. I added some sugar to it for taste since the pineapples I got weren't so great. Overall pretty good.

Can't get an easier than this, and it's very refreshing! Would be a great thirst quencher on a hot, summer day. Perfect as written.

Followed this simple recipe exactly as written. Super easy and super delicious. My 5, 8 & 11 year olds all enjoyed it. Will be making again and again.
