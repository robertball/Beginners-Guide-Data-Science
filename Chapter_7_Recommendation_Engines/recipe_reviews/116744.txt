This recipe is great! I made it using chicken breasts instead of the thighs - I like the white meat better! To flavor it a bit more, I sliced the breasts in strips, made a bit more of the sauce and marinated it for about an hour and a half before cooking. Also, I cut some lemon slices on top to give it more flavor. Absolutely awesome!! It has a real greek flavor so I served it with rice and greek salad. Try this recipe!!!

I LOVED this recipe! So quick and easy, and it got so crispy and wonderfully flavorful! I mixed it up the night before and let in marinade in a zip lock bag over night, and then just baked it in the oven, and served it with some rice and fresh broccoli. Totally great recipe! :)

This was excellent although I used chicken breasts.  Next time though I will cut the breast pieces in half as they were too thick and required a longer cooking period.  I will make this often.  Thanks for a great recipe.

It was a great tasting recipe and so easy to make!  I used two chicken breasts instead of chicken thighs, and i doubled the recipe because i found the recipe given didn't coat two chicken breasts quite enough.

A good quick 'n easy chicken recipe. One thing--I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and clean up was awful--definitely use a foil lined pan!

I made this recipe and enjoyed its flavor, it however needs a little more in the ingredient department of the sauce. I would suggest more 1tbs extra honey and lemon juice. Plus a dash more garlic.  I would also suggest this as an adult meal.

This was soooooo good.  I just had the leftovers and those were even better!  I used chicken breast sliced in half instead and it turned out really well.  Next time I'd use either 1/3 less of the oregano or I would crush the oregano so the flakes don't feel strange in my mouth.  At times it tickled my throat which got annoying.  I'd add a little more garlic because we love garlic and slightly more salt.  Other than that, it was really good!  I will definitely be making this more often.

this recipe was great! I added an extra clove of garlic since we are big on garlic in my family! turned out awesome and hubby LOVED it. I definitly recommend lining the pan with foil. I used a glass casserole dish and it had to soak overnight and still took half hour to scrub it clean!!!

Easy to prepare and makes a delicious light flavor.  I will increase the amount of honey and lemon next time to give it an extra kick.

I took the skin off of my chicken to cut back on the fat. This couldn't have been more simple. My family loved this chicken. They ate every single piece.

This recipe as great! As recommended by other reviewers, I cut the oregano just about in half. I also used twice the amount of garlic since my household likes it so much!

This was pretty good but will tweak next time by adding my own spices along with the other required ingredients. Overall, this was good though.

I'm a newlywed and novice cook so I was really worried about how this would turn out since I'm such a newby but it turned out to be a big success! My husband really enjoyed it as well as me! Although, next time I think I'm going to try doubling the sauce how someone previously suggested and letting the sauce soak into the chicken overnight with a ziplock bag as someone else had also recommended because although it was tasty I didn't taste the sauce much in the chicken but I did sip the sauce on it's own and it way tastier than how it was in the chicken. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

This is great! I marinated my chicken in lemon juice, honey, and cut oregano for about 3 hours before I baked it. Then, when I baked it I just coated each strip in honey, sprinkled the herbs and pinned the lemons on with toothpicks. Just pour your marinade in with it to let it simmer while baking to add that extra flavor.

My husband and I thought this dish was decent. It's  nothing to get really excited about, but it's pretty good for a quick weeknight dinner serviced with rice and veggies.

Very simple and easy!  Great alongside a Greek salad, since the lemon is so zingy.  It'd be awesome to figure out how to make this without having to baste the chicken, though.  Maybe by turning this into a slow cooker recipe, somehow.

This sounded so good, and reviews were positive so I tried it. Unfortunately for me my first time trying it was for a pot-luck dinner. I followed recipe as given and it was not to my liking. I certainly won't be trying it again. This is the first negative review I've ever written about a recipe, but I have to tell it as I see it.

This was a great recipe and really quite easy.  I was looking last minute for a recipe that I could just throw together and this one fit the bill.  I quite like cooking with chicken thighs.  I only made one modification: I used fresh oregano as opposed to dry (I always prefer using fresh herbs).  If you're looking for something to just toss in the oven because you don't have hours to cook something, this one is a great pick.

This was really good! This will be one of my baked chicken thigh go-to recipes. I'm not the biggest fan of oregano, so I was a little skeptical. Instead I did 1 teaspoon and it turned out great.

I used the same exact type of ingredients but I had to either double or triple some of them because the dish needed more flavor. I let it marinate for 5 hours and baked it at 350 degrees. Overall the flavors were great I enjoyed the sweet and tangy. I will make this again.

The man said wow before he had even finished the first bite. I used breasts because I had them thawed, and fresh oregano from my garden.

My husband loved it.  I did double the sauce (as my family likes things with more sauce).  As others, I did increase the lemon juice amount and when I put it in the oven I put a pat of butter on each piece and drizzled more honey.  I used cod for me (the rest had chicken).  It was wonderful!

I have no idea how to rate this.  My dh didn't like it at all.  He wouldn't say why but just that he didn't like it...then later he dipped a leftover broccoli in the baking dish and said the sauce was good.  My kids ate it up but I gave them honey to dip it in since it seemed a little lemony.  I don't eat meat so I can only go by their reactions.

This recipe is pretty good, my family enjoyed it.  My only complaint is that it needed a bit more sauce as the spices got a bit too dry on the top.  Nothing that can't be fixed though :)

This was very good.  I added extra garlic as suggested.  But, I only added one teaspoon of ground oregano and I thought it was a tad bit too much.  I also added sliced lemons to the top.  Turned out great.  Will make again, but will cut back on the oregano.  We had green beans and boiled red potatoes with it.  My hubby took the juice and used it on the beans and taters and really liked it.  I used heavy foil to line the pan and had no clean-up afterward with the pan.

This was pretty good, and my kids liked it a lot, particularly my 5 year old son.  It really needed to be seasoned with salt and pepper.

This recipe is so easy!  I love the sweet sauce.  However, I added an extra tablespoon of honey and lemon.  This made my chicken a little more juicy and left some juice left over to add on top.

Made this last night and it was really good. Me, my husband and picky two year old all enjoyed it! I used a 12 pack pack of bone in thighs (skin removed) and cooked 25 min at 400 and 30 min at 350. I tripled the sauce and marinated the thighs for about an hour before cooking. Used slightly less oil and oregano since I was tripling the recipe. Also added a teaspoon dried dill. Served over white rice with pan sauce and it was yummy!

This turned out to be very family friendly.  It didn't taste like "kid food", but all 3 kids enjoyed it! I used fresh oregano, and cut boneless skinless breasts into strips.  Will definitely make again

This was great! I used boneless, skinless chicken tenderloins (healthier) and marinated them for a few hours. I cooked them in a pan (it was quicker) and it was delicious!  I used the ingredients listed, except I added two extra splashes of lemon because, upon tasting the marinade, it wasn't very noticeable, and I'm all about the lemon flavor.  Thanks for this recipe! It's now a staple.

Thanks for sharing this great recipe! Made this in my electric skillet and added more lemon juice, more garlic, more oregano and some capers for the sauce and threw the lemons in it to cook. What an incredible flavor! The skillet cut about 10 minutes off the cooking time as well. Turned the thighs about half-way through cooking and the sauce reduced into this amazing glaze.

My family really enjoyed this recipe, I cooked the chicken on the grill. The flavor of honey and lemon juice together is great. I marnated the chicken in lemon juice and honey for 2-hours. I omitted the oregano after reading other reviews. Instead of oregano I sprinkled lemon pepper over the chicken it added an additional flavor.

A TERRIFIC meal!  I really enjoyed this recipe for a different way to make chicken!  Everyone loved it!  I made it with boneless skinless breasts and slices of lemon on the side.  It was an absolute hit!

Very good !  I used boneless breasts, though. I sprayed a glass baking dish with cooking spray first and didn't have any problem with the clean-up.  I served this with spinach, and used the pan drippings to flavor it. Great meal and one that I will make often.

I absolutely loved this recipe! I used chicken breasts instead of the thighs, and I had cut mine up in bite sized pieces (I was only cooking for one and to cut the cooking time down I cut the chicken up). It could've used a little more juice to create more of a sauce but that is my only complaint. I also had made a parsley rice pilaf (a recipe I too had found on this site) and it went wonderful with this dish. I definitely will be making this again!

This chicken tastes surprisingly so good! I did a little alteration and added a 1/2tsp salt and a little pepper, broiled it for the last 7 mins and it tastes sooo much better than i thought it would!

I was looking forward to this LEMON chicken after reading the reviews.  However it didn't taste much like lemon!  It might is you marinade the chicken overnight and thicken the liquid so it sticks to the chicken.

I used BLSL thigh fillets instead and cooked them in a cast iron skillet on the stove top as I have learned that I much prefer chicken cooked on stove top than baked. I like the seasoning very much and the caramelizing of the honey on the stove creates a nice brown colour to the chicken. Very pretty and tasty dish and really easy to whip up. 5 stars for great taste and ease of preparation. Will be making this again for sure!

The honey made it very sweet which was kind of an odd flavor that my husband and myself did not care for. I would leave out the honey and add other spices including SALT. The skin on my chicken thighs did not crisp up very well. I would suggest doing the last 5-10 minutes on a higher heat.

I thought this chicken was very good, but REALLY needed salt.  Also, my thighs must have been a lot bigger than the poster's, because mine needed an extra 20 minutes to cook through.

For my family this was too much Oregano taste.  I will need to adjust the honey/lemon and reduce the Oregano to make it something they would enjoy.

I made this for dinner last night and my husband went crazy for it! The only thing I did differently was add a tablespoon of melted butter to the mixture. My husband took the leftovers to work today and mixed it in with salad and ranch dressing and the combination was really yummy.

This was really delicious--what great flavor! I was only using 3 chicken thighs but I went ahead and made the sauce just as written and used it all. My husband loved it too. I will definitely be adding this one to my recipe collection.

This is easy and tasty ! We are overgrown with oregano so I used fresh and tried it both in the oven and on the BBQ. For the BBQ needs a longer marinade but both were good and the kids ate it!  I really like the fact that the marinade is not salty as I prefer to season afterwards - previous recipes I've tried had a lot of soy sauce. This is better, will be a regular.

I made this recipe with some jasmine rice and my picky 3 yr old really ate it up! I susbstituted dry garlic seasoning for the garlic cloves and used cooking oil infused with roasted garlic for the olive oil and it still came out delicious. I basted every 10 minutes or so...The honey really brings everything together. Definitely a do-over!

My family loved this!  I used 3 large chicken breasts cut in half and added an extra clove of garlic.  The 45 minute cook time was perfect.  I lined the pan with foil to make cleanup easier.  The chicken came out juicy with just enough sauce.

This was a good recipe! I used chicken breasts since it was all I had and I tripled the sauce recipe. After the chicken was done I took it out and added some corn starch to the sauce to make a glaze. Came out fantastic!

Good base. I marinaded breasts for an hour in the sauce, then pan seared them. Next time I'll try it with rosemary and more lemon....perhaps even using zest.

I would like to give this more stars and maybe I will once I do as the others did and let the chicken marinate for an hour or so. I used thighs and drums, the oregano flavor stood out and I think it could of used a little sea salt. I will try it again, thanks for the recipe.

WOW, I had 4 thin chicken cutlets defrosted and came across this recipe.  I cut the cutlets up, marinated them for about 30 minutes and [as another reviewer suggested] cooked them in a skillet.  I cooked a boil-in-bag packet of rice, removed the chicken and put the rice in the skillet to absorb the left over juice.  It was SO delicious that I'm defrosting a bag of shirmp right now, and will use the same marinade to cook them tomorrow.  DELICIOUS and so super-fast.  This is a keeper.  Thank you!

This was very tasty and yet easy if you use chicken breast.  I actually used frozen breasts and mixed all the ingredients together (used butter instead of olive oil b/c of what I had on hand) and poured over the frozen chicken and baked in a glass dish in the oven.  Be sure to turn the breast over a couple times and/or baste them to get the flavor throughout.  Revised:  Last few times I made this it wasn't that good.  Too much lemon and not enough honey I think.  I had doubled the marinade and it didn't come out the same plus I used the olive oil instead of butter.

This recipe - slightly modified - was made by my grandmother for me and I've made for my kids with great regularity and has long been a family favorite.  The changes in how I make it: no garlic or honey (garlic sounds good and I love it, but would imagine it takes away from the lemon/oregano purity), but yes to salt and pepper; use 2 lemons, cut in half and squeezed over the thighs, then put the lemon halves in the dish while it bakes; coat the thighs with a bit more oregano than this calls for so all thighs are evenly coated.  This is the best use of lemons in a non-desert other than over fish.

Incredibly easy, incredibly good. My husband said this is the best chicken he's ever had.  I baked it at 400 for 30 mins (as I was baking some Roman bread to go with it), and it turned out perfectly.

First of all, I was disappointed that the chicken came out more like oregano-honey chicken than anything. The lemon was only a faint accent, nothing major though. Secondly, while I basted the chicken thighs regularly (about 4 times in the 45 min of cooking), they still came out dryer than breasts typically are.

I recommend that the chicken be soaked in the lemon juice for a short time before cooking, and that maybe only 2T of honey be used. Secondly, I typically cook chicken for 45 minutes, but I rotate it every 15. I was hoping that it would come out crispy as someone claimed it had, but all I had was dry chicken.

I really hate to leave a poor rating on this recipe, because it has the potential of being great. But not only is it misnamed (with barely a hint of lemon), but either my oven or the instructions went horribly wrong, and produces very dry chicken thighs (I prefer thighs because breasts always seem to be so dry).

I added 1/2 tsp salt but it still could have used more. I think it would be better with lemon slices and less lemon juice as it seemed a bit watery and plain....but it sure did smell good!

I love this recipe.  It also works well in a slow cooker.  I mixed the marinade and chicken, then left it in there for about 6 hours on low.  It's awesome.

I loved this!  I accidentally got a bag of frozen chicken legs instead of breast & I don't even like chicken legs, & it turned out good.  Here's what I did: since my chicken was frozen & I don't like turning on the oven in the summer, I cooked them in a pressure cooker w/ water & some lemon juice for about 20 mins. When it was done, I poured out the water & I drizzled the mixture on top.  Awesome!!! I will make this many, many times.  Thanks for sharing!

We enjoyed this recipe. It's super easy and quick to put together. I used a little more lemon juice and added sliced lemon to the top of the chicken. I thought it was delicious. I will definately be making this again.

This is a great recipe; simple, easy and I always have the ingredients on hand. I prefer thighs anyway but I do double the sauce so I have extra to pour over rice. The chicken isn't sticky but it is just as yummy. My 6 year old daughter says " Mom, this is the best chicken ever!"

This was Wonderful !!  Though I used a whole chicken...cooked the norm at about 1/2 hr per pound at 400...basted about every ten minutes...in a covered roaster pan on a rack..started with butt side up...turned it over when browned (about an hour and a half) Results : Tasty..Tender..Moist and oh so Flavorful !

I made this recipe and it was a keeper.  Prep time was short, the baking directions were perfect, and the chicken was moist.  The only reason for not giving the recipe five stars was that the flavor of the chicken was sort of weak.  Overall, great recipe.

We thought this recipe is great. I like our food very lemony so I uped the lemon juice by taking 3 peeled lemons in the food processor, strained it and poured the whole thing over the chicken. Instead of using dried oregano I used fresh oregano, but remember that you only need a fraction of fresh to dried otherwise it will taste a bit of bitter.

This was okay. I used pork loin chops instead as that was what was thawed. There was absolutely no color to this dish, even with chicken I believe it would have looked like boiled chicken. It had a good flavor. However I'm not a big fan of "sweet" taste in my savory foods and I could really taste the honey's sweetness. I even used less than the recipe called for. I gave it 2 stars because it was edible but it lacked something. Quite boring, I won't be making this again, even with chicken.

I was eager to try this after reading the initial reviews I saw ... to much disappointment!!! Way too bland!! I served it over jasmine rice ... the sauce/drippings over the rice was kind of tasty - but no one in the family liked it. And we're stuck with the leftovers.

I made the sauce for this recipe to go with homemade Chicken-Style Seitan cutlets (fake chicken made from wheat gluten), seitan recipe from "Vegan Yum Yum" cookbook.  I substituted agave nectar for honey.  The sauce was on the bland side, next time I'll add a bit more salt and slice the "chicken" into strips, but otherwise, this is a great recipe.  I served it with capellini pomodoro and steamed pea pods.

My family loved it.  I cooked it on top of the stove in a heavy skillet.  First I added the olive oil, garlic and some onions.  I added the chicken browning it on both sides.  The lemon juice, honey and herbs du provence was the final step.

This recipe sounded good from the reviews and the simple ingredients, but it took about half an hour longer to cook than noted in the recipe.  It also never got brown enough.  I had to put in it the broiler to get it browned, but then was a bit overcooked.  I would add some salt and pepper and some more lemon juice and honey as well.

This recipe looks delicious!!! I'm going to take everyone's suggestions and see how it turns out: lining the pan with aluminum foil, lots more garlic, marinade ahead of time, using breasts and cutting them in half. I'll let you guys know how it turns out!

This was probably the best chicken recipe I've ever tried. I used boneless, skinless thighs, and as advertised, the honey+herbs+lemon juice coated the chicken beautifully. I amended the recipe by using slightly more honey (almost three tablespoons) as well as a fancy rough citrus salt. I set the oven to 400 and was pleased with the crisp glaze the juices formed on the meat. I recommend basting frequently.

I tried this as is - except I used 1/2 the amount of oregano. It turned out bland, needs salt or something. Just not very good.

A new favorite!  I used lemon zest and flour to coat the chicken and it turned out great!  Served with couscous and zuchhini.

Simple and tasty!  I would recommend serving with rice to spoon the extra juices over, especially if you don't eat the skin (where most of the flavor is).  I didn't do this, but will next time!

My "I never cook" husband made this for us.  It was really good and juicy.  We had a lot of the juice leftover and it was a little greasy for my liking.  I would adjust for that.  If I was making it myself it might have gotten 5 stars.

This was very very good. I added some onion to it since I love onion, but other than that, I left it exactly as is! Very tasty and a huge hit at my house.  (people are fighting for the left overs!)

Wonderful! Chicken was very moist and good flavor. I used chicken breasts instead of thighs. I cut them into strips, marinated for 1.5 hours and used all the recommended oregano. We loved it! And it was so easy. Thanks so much!

I ADORE LEMON CHICKEN and this is yummy! Here's how I tweaked it:  First I browned the thighs with skin and drained off most of the fat.  Then I sauteed onions in a little bit of chicken fat.  While the onions were browning, I sliced up a bunch of potatoes and laid them around the chicken pieces.  Then I poured the onions over, then the mixed lemon sauce. I left out the olive oil from the sauce because there's still plenty of fat in the thighs. Also, I basted every so often. AND OH MY GOODNESS!  How those potatoes absorbed the flavor! My family went nuts over this one!

This is a great recipe - quick and easy to prepare with great flavour too!  We love chicken thighs and I used 8 boneless, skinless and they were yummy and moist!  I did scale back the oregano by about 1/2 tsp as it seemed like a bit much.  Served with simple steamed carrots and Balsamic Roasted Red Potatoes (from this site too)!  A keeper!

Very good.  I doubled the marinade and poured it over 6 chicken breasts.  Served with rice and steamed broccoli.  The oregano was a little much for my picky children, but my wife and I loved it.

I've started making this several times a week.  The mixture of honey and oregano remind me of being in Greece - I use frozen fresh oregano and it seems to make a big difference in flavor.

The flavor on this was good, ease of prep great, and it was very tender.  Not a show-stopper or anything, but a quick satisfying meal.  Do use a meat thermometer to insure the proper temp.  You can avoid under and over-cooking that way.  I used 3 very small boneless, skinless breasts and kept the "sauce" amount the same so I could put the extra over steamed broccoli.  I cooked brown rice in fat-free, reduced sodium chicken broth and garlic powder for an easy side.  Due to the other reviewers saying the oregano was too strong, I cut that in half.  Perfect!

We tried this recipe and we did enjoy it, yet found the amount of oregano a little overpowering.  Maybe go a little less next time, but we loved the lemon and honey flavours together.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was exactly what I was looking for to make for dinner.  I substituted chicken legs.  I thought it was wonderful and would eat it again.  Hubby thought it was just okay, and my kids wouldn't even touch them.  I think because the glaze browns, they thought it was BBQ sauce, which they don't like.  If everyone else in the family would have liked it, I would have rated it a 5.
