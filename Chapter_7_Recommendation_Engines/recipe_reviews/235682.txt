Don't cook the tortilla too long or you won't be able to roll it (I learned the hard way).  All you want to do is heat it a little.  I made one with 1/2 tsp cayenne, and it was W-A-Y too spicy for us; about 1/4 tsp (or even a little less) for an 8" tortilla was the perfect amount of heat for us.   You'll just have to figure out what works best for you.  You'll taste the sweetness first, and then the spiciness kicks in later.  Great snack for the kids, too, just leave out the cayenne.   This is a quick little dessert that seriously takes just minutes to make.  We enjoyed it!

Good Lord! If you dare use this much cayenne pepper, be prepared to call the fire department!! Way too much even for uber spicy fans!

Try spreading a little sweetened cream cheese before rolling it for additional richness!

We loved it but made some big changes. Added butter to the tortilla first; then the sugar cinnamon combo let it cook for a minute. Skipped the cayenne, slid it onto a plate and went straight to honey and rolled it up. Topped with whip cream. It was a huge hit.

Delicious! I make these all the time. I love spicy food though and I had to half the amount of cayenne pepper so start with less then add to taste.

Its a great sweet & spicy dessert in a pinch. You can't beat the flavor per time spent making it.
