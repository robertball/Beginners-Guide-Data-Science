Very tasty. I didn't have red wine vinegar, so I used red wine and basalmic vinegar instead. Might try it with chicken breasts too.

This was not to our liking at all. We wasted a pound of very nice pork on this and could not eat it. What the hey?

My husband and I were totally unimpressed by this. It doesn't have very much flavor, except the red wine vinegar. Maybe with more cheese and some salt and pepper or something... I won't be making it again.

Kudos to this recipe for being full of flavor.  You need to like red wine vinegar to like this!  I ended up making 3 pork chops because I had a lot of the apple and cheese mixture.  However, that is likely my fault because I didn't measure anything and just dumped.  Anyway, so I increased the sauce by 1/2 to accommodate for that change.  I thought that it was a bit difficult to wrap the pork chops around the mixture, and bf was cranky about the toothpicks in the pork.  I didn't chop the apple very finely; I'd recommend doing so, or maybe even making an apple pesto in the food processor.  Bf thought they'd be better with sweeter apples.  Thanks for the recipe.

I should have known better then to try this.  Anytime you 'boil' meat in a liquid it makes it tough and tasteless.  My DH and I both did not care for this at all.

There's a few tricks to this meal that we've figured out over cooking it dozens of times.  First, use pork tenderloin.  It's much better, less tough and more flavorful, you get 2 servings per 1/2 a tenderloin (they usually come cut lengthwise).  Second, reduce cooking time in half.  All you need is 15 minutes for it to be done properly.  Third, ditch the toothpicks.  Use roasting twine, and tie up the meat once rolled.  Also, red wine is a good hack instead of vinegar if you don't have red wine vinegar.

Great recipe, although with some modifications.  Used a tomato garlic cheddar rather than regular cheddar.
Browned the pork loin, then covered and let cook without adding the vinegar or water (and without making a gravy at the end).  We chose to reserve some of the apple to marinate with red onion and champagne vinegar with a touch of apple cider vinegar.  After the pork loin was finished, we added the apple/onion mixture to the pan to deglaze and added some steamed kale.  
Reserved a bit of uncooked apple and shredded cheese to top the pork loin and apple/onion/kale mix once done.

Great flavors together, thanks so much for posting this recipe.
