Great recipe - fantastic touch with the soy in the mushrooms.  Some slight variations for my health conscious family:  Burgers: - Seasoned with 1 egg, 2 tbsp of water, 1/4 dry multigrain breadcrumbs (can use regular), 1 small onion finely chopped, 2 tsp of dijon mustard, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp pepper, 1/2 worcestershire sauce for every 1 lb of lean ground beef. (Didn't use the meat tenderizer since the water kept it moist) - Added swiss cheese to each burger when cooked and on the grill. (Can be done in a pan as well - make sure to drain the fat)  Mushrooms: - A little extra virgin olive oil instead of butter - Added 1/4 tsp minced garlic to warm olive oil - Brought the temperature down to medium and lay fresh sliced mushrooms flat on a skillet and let it stew in its own juices rather than stirring.  This brings out the full flavour of the mushrooms. - Added the soy at when the mushrooms were near cooked (last minute or two)  Additions: - Using the same olive oil in the mushroom skillet, added 1 medium red onion cut into thin rounds and sautéed. Okay to stir. - Used multigrain thin bread bun thins (Earthgrains 100% Multigrain Thin Buns are really good - can be found in any grocery store, Nature's own multigrain sandwich rounds are great too, Dempster's Thinfuls are available in Canada, but not as healthy at the others) - Used baby spinach leaves instead of lettuce on the buns - Added a few hot peppers to top off the burger for a little kick  Amazing - will be making more often

This was just okay, I made some modifications and hoped it would be more like a restaurant mushroom-swiss burger. In addition to the seasoning salt, I also added freshly ground black pepper and minced garlic to the ground beef. I sautéd fresh baby portobello mushrooms instead of canned and also added grilled onions. Still, it was good but not great. A nice base recipe I'll keep experimenting with.

Delicious!  Super fast to prepare too.  We didn't need any other stuff on our burgers.  I used less soy sauce because I didn't want the mushrooms to get too salty.

If you want to kick this up a notch, and make it taste like restaurant mushroom burger sauce, stir a little dollop of sour cream into your mushroom mixture after you've taken it off the heat. Perfection!

As written I would give 3.5 stars. I made this a couple times trying to improve upon it to fit our tastes and I found adding a can of Golden Mushroom condensed soup, in lieu of the soy sauce, to the mushrooms really gives it a thicker and much tastier sauce. Fresh mushrooms cooked in butter up the flavor as well.

The soy sauce was not something I would have thought to add, but it certainly gives the mushrooms that savory flavor.  Yum!  I also add garlic butter to my buns before I laid them on the skillet I'd just cooked the mushrooms in.  I love Red Robin's mushroom Swiss burger and this came super close for a fraction of the cost of eating it at the restaurant.  Thank you!

This was a nice change! I added extra seasonings and garlic to the burger mix, though. Loved the mushrooms with the soy sauce! I even added onions.......Mmmmmmm! :o)

This is a great change from the usual toppings. I've been trying different combinations lately to escape burger boredom. This is too simple not to try.

Great quick and easy recipe!
I did the same as Carrie, added onions :)
gave it a dash of Worcestershire sauce for some more addeed flavor and cut back a tad on the soy so not too salty.
Fun dinner for all!!!

Made these exactly as the recipe called for them to be made!  I think reviews  that include any modifications are not a true review of the actual recipe.  We enjoyed them every much!  Easy to make and husband enjoyed them -  we will definitely make them again!

I made this for my roommate who likes mushrooms and swiss cheese. To my surprise, my Husband also liked it, even though he doesn't like swiss. I will make it again. Thanks.

First of all the mushrooms: I will probably sauté mushrooms this way from this point forward...they were so savory! Those mushrooms are really what makes this sandwich so good.

Soy sauce is a nice surprise with the mushrooms.  Soy doesn't overpower but rather adds a savory aspect.  I caramelized onions before adding the mushrooms , worked out well.  Found a smokey Swiss and it hands down beat any restaurant burger we've ordered!  Hubby and I both enjoyed this one, thank you!!

Very delicious...my daughter does not really like burgers but after taking the first bite of this she says she now likes burgers if made from scratch like this instead of burger joints or frozen patties.

We grilled the burgers, didn't have meat tenderizer, so just used the salt and pepper. Also used fresh mushrooms and sauteed them in a cast iron pan over the grill. Great burgers!

A simple mushroom Swiss burger that is great comfort food too. I used fresh mushrooms and teriyaki sauce instead of soy sauce as I ran out of soy sauce. Overall, this recipe is what you would expect mushroom Swiss to taste like.

This was a great hamburger.  I didn't have meat tenderizer so we put A1 in the meat and that was great.  I also used fresh mushrooms and added onion in the saute pan too.  We put the onion mushroom stuff on after the melted cheese and I wish I would have covered the mushrooms with the cheese.

I did not care for the canned mushrooms. I made 1 with canned mushrooms and the other 3 with fresh. We all had the same opinion and ended up scraping tne canned mushroom topping off and putting the fresh on. The burgers then were great!

Only change was I used dehydrated onion and about 2 Tbsp. Worcestershir sauce and ground black pepper. Just not ctazy for burgers.
