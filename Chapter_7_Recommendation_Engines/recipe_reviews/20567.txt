How is this perfect for kids or anyone?  As a treat, yes... but to pretend it's healthy is crazy.  There is no fresh fruit, it's all syrup based canned. Then add sugar and fake whipped cream and white flour.  Wow.   It may be tasty, but treat it like a once in a while sugary dessert.

I had made this in the past but lost the recipe.  This is a great dessert but be warned that this recipe makes A LOT!  I followed it exactly just used the colored marshmallows for Easter.  Next time I'll only make 1/2 a recipe b/c that little bag of pasta is deceiving!  It has a nice cool, light, fruity taste -perfect for a hot summer's day dessert.  It looks a little different but if you convince people to try it, most love it!  Make sure and serve it well chilled.  Thanks for reminding me how good this is!!

I used this recipe the first time I ever made frog-eyed salad.  It was a hit at the bbq we went to.  The next time we were invited back they requested that we bring this salad.  It may have even been the reason we were invited ;)!  Each time I made it I was not able to refrigerate for 8 hours for one reason or another.  Both times I put the bowl in the freezer the morning of and stirred every 15 minutes until it was chilled through and not quite freezing to the side of the bowl.  Then I refrigerated and added the rest of the ingredients right before we left for the bbq.

Well to make it a bit more 'fresh' as a reader suggested, I myself dont like the canned fruit, so I used fresh fruit that was in season and did my own whip cream. To make it thick and to stick I used fresh OJ and heated it with cornstarch and water to make it thick. Recipes are a guidline and u can cahnge them often to your liking I do it all the time. Use a sugar subsitiute or just dont add it - its not that hard really. Only add things you like. I made this for St Patricks day and I colored it green (the whip cream is what I colored).

This is my favorite salad! It is so yummy; definitely a comfort food around our house. I've tried many different recipes and this one is my fav. I just wish there were a way to take out the eggs, though, because some people in my family are allergic to eggs. Anyway, appreciated the tidbit about being able to freeze it. I add a little cinnamon to mine and coconut; adds a little extra something to it. I also put vanilla in the "sauce."

I'm so glad I found this recipe. My aunt used to make it and I loved it. It's a wonderful way to get in some Vitamin C, and a pretty healthy/low-fat desert. I used splenda instead of sugar and added bananas before serving. I think it'd be great with some apples tossed in too. Will make again.

I was so glad to find this recipe, we always make frog eye salad for big holiday meals.  Before, I always used the recipe on the back of a certain pasta, but my grocer discontinued carrying that brand.  This recipe is even better anyway.  As for the lady that complained about it not being healthy, there are some easy substitutions to make.  Whole grain pasta, fresh fruit and Splenda, you can even use real whipped cream just before you serve it. Delicious!

I loved this recipe!  I wasn't introduced to this salad until a few years back but I never attempted to make it myself.  A few weeks ago I did and it turned out great.  The only thing I did different was to used pineapple tidbits and also some crushed pineapple instead of the bigger chunks. I felt I was able to enjoy more of everything in one bite instead of eating a big chunk of pineapple and nothing else.  That's how I prefer it but either way this recipe will be my go to from now on!

I get requests for this all of the time it's so good! I intially made it for a Big Love marathon party (we had funeral potatoes, frog-eye salad, carrot salad, and jello). It reminds me of tapioca pudding (due to the little round acini de pepe pasta) and ambrosia salad. I highly recommend this, espc. for potlucks and any parties. Easy to make and forgiving with substitutes. You can use fruit cocktail instead of pineapple and mandarin oranges. I use homemade vanilla whip cream instead of the frozen kind. Fantastic recipe! Very happy!

My mom made this all the time growing up in Kansas (big hit with everyone I knew in KANSAS). My husband and I moved to Virginia and I made it at a potluck at work and nearly everyone hated it to a point they told me that pasta and fruit shouldn't be mixed together. I was given the hardest time for months. Definitly not an east coast thing.

This salad is wonderful, it's my  personal favorite.  I make it every Thanksgiving and Christmas.  Children just love this recipe.  Be prepared to have a large bowl or cut the recipe in half, because it will make ALOT!!!

This was great! I cut the recipe in half because its just my husband and I, and it still made enough to last us 4 days! I also left out the cherries and marshmallows. Finally, I made whipped cream from scratch rather than using cool whip.

This came out great!  I was missing our old local Deli's Frog Eye Salad, and found this recipe.   I think I might try some of the others' suggestions next time and add the vanilla.  I think that might add to it.  No complaints though.  I tried to make it a bit more healthy by using only fruit that was in juice and not syrup.  Also, I don't know if I'll make it in winter ever again... it just had such a light, fruity, summery taste it made me bummed that it's only January, haha.  Great treat though for picnics or potlucks.  Does make a LOT!  Thanks Jannet!

The way it is, is perfect. But there are a couple of things I like to do differently. I like to use the crushed pineapple that is packaged in water. I then drain the liquid from this in a measuring cup and add enough water to equal the pineapple juice. I feel like if I add the other fruit it would have more of a canned fruit cocktail taste. But I do add an extra can of pineapple.(chunk, tidbits or crushed and include this juice to the measuring cup) Taking the time to make the sauce is what gives this recipe it's deliciousness. Give it a try.

Since introducing this salad to my friends and family I always get assigned to bring this to almost every reunion and barbecue! I omit the cherries and use the fruity flavored marshmallows to make it fun for my kids.

I skipped a step and used instant pudding and substituted a 20 oz. can of crushed pineapple for the juice. I left the cherries out as I never put cherries in this recipe. My sister uses green grapes though.

I first had this recipe when I lived in Kansas. It is light and fruity, my kids love it. I bring it to pot luck dinners and always double the recipe so there is a batch for home and a batch to go. You can always add more fruit, I like to throw in some marachino cherries for the color and I love cherries. The name makes it a good one for Halloween, but it is really wonderful in the spring and summer also because it is light and cold.

My daughter is allergic to the hydrogenated oils that are in cool whip, so I just used 1 pint of whipping cream and 1/4 cup sugar, whipped, to replace the cool whip.  This is still one of my favorite sweet creamy salads for summer. It makes a lot, so it's great for family parties and barbeques.

I love this! I begged the woman that used to bring this to family funtions for the recipe. She said "NO!! It's a family secret!!" After a few years of driving her nuts. She relented. The only difference between my version and this one is the eggs. My recipe calls for 2 whole eggs. Just thought I'd pass that on in case someone out there only had 2! Cuts down a little on the bad cholesterol! Ha! Ha! Ha!---But the Carbs really make this a YUMMMYYY TREAT!!! We All LOVE IT!!!WHOLE FAMILY!!!! Merry Christmas from Ramona, CA

I loved this salad but my family...not so much. I think it's the pasta. It's a bit strange and they think it's too much like tapioca. I thought it was fun.

I altered it a bit - removed the cherries and marshmellows and up'd the quantity of oranges and pineapple.  It was a hit!

Everyone thought this was "ambrosia" until I told them otherwise.  I think I like ambrosia better, although this makes a ton and is easy to fix.  It might have been better if I had sprinkled some pecans in it, but that didn't occur to me until later.

I really like this salad.  I had an cook out and some liked it and some didn't.  I think the people who didn't like it were intemidated by the noodles.

No changes needed!!  This is a fantastic option for any event - graduations,  reunions, work pot-lucks, picnics, etc.   Often requested and always a hit!  Recipe makes a lot, but, it refrigerates well.

Love this dish. I did not substitute anything or make any changes to the recipe. This makes a lot so it is great for for holidays and large gatherings. Because of the pasta size and shape in this recipe it is very reminiscent of tapioca.  This is just like the Frog Eye Salad I get from the Apple Spice Junction.

Good recipe, I liked being able to make part of it the night before.  I added chopped mangos, only one can of pineapple,  and used real whipping cream. makes a ton, great for a group.

My friend's mother also made this salad, the only difference was
she didn't add the mini marshmallows, which eliminates some of the sugar and still tastes great.

Very good. Something different to bring to a picnic.  You definitely want to make it ahead of time and let it sit overnight.

My family has been making this exact recipe for years!!  My mom would make every Thanksgiving for as long as I can remember and I continue the tradition (so going on 30+ years).   It is always good and makes great leftovers when in the mood for something sweet.  I usually leave out the cherries, but good either way.
