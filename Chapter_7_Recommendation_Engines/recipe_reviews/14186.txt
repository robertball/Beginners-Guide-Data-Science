I used strawberries, raspberries and mandarin oranges in addition to the toasted pecans. Cut the sugar in half for the dressing. I thought the dressing looked funny after blending, but wow this was a great salad. Also marinated the chicken breast in a mixture of white wine vinegar, orange juice, garlic and herb seasoning blend and a little olive oil. YUM.

Oh, MY!  This was absolutely DELIGHTFUL!  I had accidentally run out of red wine vinegar, so used a raspberry vinegar instead... it was wonderful.  I used oranges, and when you took a bite with bits of each the explosion of flavor in your mouth was pure extasy.

This is the BEST salad, I work as a Food Service Manger in an Institute...and when ever we have guests we use this salad as a house salad, for the fruit we use mandarin oranges, grapes, raisins, we use either pecans or almonds roasted in butter and brown sugar...ummmmmmmm

Don't pass this one by!!!  Yum!  This will be my new favorite meal to pack for lunch.  I used canned pineapple because that's what I had, and it was perfect.  The dressing is great - I cut the amount of oil about in half so it is not so full of fat.  I have tried this dressing over a number of different salads.  It's great with baby spinach, fresh pears, and feta cheese.

Good, I am doing low carb so I used 4 packets of Splenda instead of sugar and used spinach instead of bibb lettuce. I used 2 strawberries and cut them into thin slices to lower the carb count. I will make this again

Delicious.  There's no need to make a full recipe of dressing.  I made a half recipe (also reducing the sugar by another half) and it was more than enough.  I used two of those ready-to-eat bags of mixed greens, and tossed them in the dressing before putting them on the plate.  It was so healthy-tasting and fun.  Yum.

Love!!  This is a great recipe as it is.  The only changes I made were subbing a Spring mix salad blend for the Bibb lettuce and adding feta cheese.  I made this with strawberries, but it would be great with other fruits as well.  The sweet and tangy dressing was just right.  I loved that it came together easily with ingredients from my pantry.  The toasted pecans added flavor and a nice crunch.  It was a nice, light meal that was perfect for a summer evening on the deck.  I can't wait to make it again!

This is very similar to one of my favorite salads that they serve at a local restaurant. The recipe tasted almost exactly the same except I wouldn't have added as much vegetable oil to the dressing...it tasted too much like it. Strawberries are my favorite in it and I always add chicken.

This was an awesome salad!  the dressing was amazing, however i did cut the sugar in half and it was still wonderful!  I also sprinkled some star pastini over it and fried tortilla strips to go with it.  The pecans taste wonderful if you toast them in just a little bit of butter and also salt.  Love the recipe and will definitely make again!!!

The girl I had over wanted the recipe for the dressing.

Loved the dressing.  I originally cut the sugar in half, but ended up adding the rest in b/c I think it was really needed to balance out the vinegar & give the dressing more flavor.  I don't necessarily like sweet dressing, but this was very, very good!  Used the called for amt of oil & all the rest of the ingredients & used my blender to mix it all up.  It was thick, but once on the salad it was fine.  Yummy!  Oh, and I used clementines and plain old pecans (not toasted...)

Great and quick to make!  The dressing is very good but obviously the source of most of the calories as for most salads.  That being said, it was great as is. I used raspberries but will experiment with other options.

I would have given it 4 stars personnally but I had to give it 3 as the rest of my family didn't like it. I made the dressing exactly as indicated but if I were to make it again I would cut back on both the sugar and the oil.  Go light on the dressing on the salad - it is quite sweet and very oily.

My husband raved about this salad.  The dressing is comparable to any restaurant's.  Used raspberry balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar. Excellent!

This is a terrific recipe that won me rave reviews from my guests. I made a few changes based on other reviews and what I had on hand or couldn't find in the store, but I think the dressing is the cornerstone and the star of the show that makes this recipe 5-star and extremely versatile. I made this underway on a sailboat, so to save steps I skipped marinating the chicken as other reviewers suggested, though I thought I might regret it. Instead, I sprinkled the chicken with a mixture of a little bit of (believe it or not!) Montreal Steak Seasoning, Everglades Seasoning, garlic powder and cinnamon (sounds weird, but is delicious!) on one side and salt & pepper on the other. This blend of flavors, though off-the-cuff, went beautifully with the flavor of the dressing. My grocery store didn't have Bibb lettuce, so I bought pre-packaged Boston mix, which turned out looking just as pretty. I used strawberries, blueberries and mandarin oranges, arranged prettily with the pecans, creating a beautiful color contrast. I did as other reviewers suggested and cut the amount of oil, but maybe too much as the dressing was a bit too runny. I agree that blending (instead of just whisking) the dressing is a step you don't want to skip if at all possible.  I sometimes wonder why people give recipes 5 stars if they make all kinds of changes to it, but this really deserves it whether you customize or not.

I love this recipe! Tthe amount of oil is high so I cut it down to 1/4 cup olive oil and plain vinegar but threw in some strawberries in the blender as well to spruce up the favor. Still had way more than enough. Next time I shall use 1/8 and a dash of everything else. The nuts are totally optional. You just can't go wrong with this recipe. It is completely flexible.

This made a delicious and satisfying summer meal.  After reading some other reviews, I decided to marinate my chicken in a mixture of white wine vinegar, olive oil, garlic, orange juice, seasoning blend (I used Penzey's Mural of Flavor) and a little honey.  The chicken was juicy and tender with a great flavor.  I also used raspberry wine vinegar, a little less sugar, and no onion in the dressing.  It was such a nice complement to the strawberries, pecans, & chicken!  I grilled a few pieces of garlic toast alongside the chicken the last minute or two of grilling and ended up with a wonderful, warm-weather meal!  Thanks for the recipe - it's sure to become a "go-to" meal especially in the summer months!

Excellent. My dinner guests raved about the blend of flavours and the dressing. My modifications were as follows: I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup. I reduced the oil to 2/3 of a cup. I minced half a shallot and this was sufficient onion. Even in making these changes there was more than enough dressing. I substituted diced pink grapefruit, orange, and pear for the strawberries. Lastly, I used red and green Baby Romaine instead of the Bibb lettuce.

I recommend not tossing the salad with the dressing. Serve it on the side allowing your guests the opportunity of satisfying their individual needs. 

I have made this salad with chunks of cooked salmon (skin removed) and it was excellent as well.

Thanks, Karena.

This salad is easy, yummy and pretty, but I just couldn't put all of that sugar in (I think I put in about half) and be careful not to overdo it on the onion.  I used the amount of onion called for, but maybe the onion I used was larger than average?  Also about 1/8 teaspoon of Cayenne, gave a tiny little kick that I really liked.

This was a nice, refreshing salad to have for dinner last night, especially since our temps have been in the 90s!  After reading the reviews I decided to cut the sugar in half, but after tasting it, I added another 2 t.  My dressing was very thick and I had to add some water to thin it to drizzling consistency.  I added mandarin oranges along with the strawberries and had a beautiful, yummy salad!  Thank you!

I liked this, as did my husband, and I will probably make it again. But, it is surprisingly mild. It seemed to lack a little.... je ne sais quois. Maybe I'll try adding another vegetable or some cheese next time, and/or using raspberry vinegar, as another review suggested.

This salad is simple, with few ingredients, but varying the fruit and/or type of greens provides a lot of flexibility.  I made this recipe with raspberries, and will try others.  The dressing was excellent.  Great fresh taste.

Awesome recipe; this is great for those nights when you need a quick dinner without sacrificing taste. It is also a very forgiving recipe - use less sugar or oil if you prefer; I've also substituted dry roasted peanuts or almonds for the pecans and sliced mango in place of the strawberries. Delicious!

Very yummy salad. The onion should be half of a SMALL onion. I used half of a large onion and even though I thought it was a bit much I wanted to try the recipe as is. It was still delicious but by the end of the meal my eyes were burning!

I loved this salad because it was fresh and light, perfect for a summer day. I didn't have red wine vinegar so I used a Japanese seasoned vinegar and because of that I added less than a quarter of the sugar, but I still thought the dressing was a little too sweet. If you were using an unseasoned vinegar then some sugar is necessary but I will use the same vinegar as I did before but leave the sugar out completely next time and then I think the recipe will be worth 5 stars!

Wonderful!  My kids loved it.  I used a rotisserie chicken rather than grilling my own just because I'm lazy and pressed for time.  The dressing was great.  Even my kid who hates onions liked the dressing.  :-)

Great dish. I made it with raspberries, blueberries, green and red grapes and mandarin oranges. Marinated the chicken in orange juice, garlic, wine vinegar and a mix of spices. Fantastic meal, I'll be making it again.

Fabulous; tastes like a restaurant salad.  I used red onion in the dressing and the kids asked I flavored it with starwberries; it was pretty and tasty.  This is a keeper.  For faster prep, I keep grilled chicken breast strips in the freezer. I used only 1/2 cup of veg oil for the dressing.

Very nice flavors, though I thought 1/2 an onion was too much, and will cut back to 1/4 next time. Did not have pecans or strawberries so I used walnuts and raspberries over iceberg lettuce, and threw in avocado, tomato, cucumber and mushrooms. Thanks for the recipe!

This was just ok. Tried to save time and used a rotisserie chicken.  Think that may have been the problem because it was lacking some spice.  Maybe also doubling the sauce as some reviewers have suggested would help also

I found this recipe about a month ago and it is wonderful!  The salad dressing is very versatile...we've used various fruits, different types of meat and lettuce.  We grilled pork chops and used apples, walnuts and the cherry craisins - yummy!  The first time I made this recipe, I mistakenly added ground nutmeg to the dressing.  It was awesome.  So I've never tried it without.  I also substitute dried minced onion in place of fresh, splenda in place of the sugar, and grapeseed oil is really good in place of the traditional vegetable oil.  I would definitely marinade your meat, if you have the time.  For the chicken, try the McCormick's Grill Mates - Baja Citrus - it's very tasty!  Thanks for the great recipe...we've made it several times already and it will be used just as much in the future!

WOW.  BEST salad I've had in quite a while.  Made this last week for the hubby and was worried about the thick consistency of the dressing.  Not anymore - this will be a new staple in our house.  Can't wait to make it again!  (PS - used 1/4 instead of 1/2 cup of sugar - still awesome.)

My family loves this salad!!!  I have made it 4 times in the last 6 weeks and they cheer every time.  Tonight I used toasted almonds instead of pecans using what I had.  Cooking the chicken on George Foreman Grill really make this a fast meal.

I was out of oil so I used italian dreesing and then just omited the onion and used some wine I had in the fridgeand 1/2 the amount of sweetner using truvia.No pecans and used spring mix,spinach and a little romain instead of bibb and was still amazing! I will make this again and again. Thank you shor sharing!

Good. Dressing has a bit too much onion. I saved some time on the chicken by using Tyson grilled and ready. Overall took me 15 min.

Excellent!  The toasted pecans were a great touch, and next time I'll probably add more than the recipe calls for.  For the dressing, I recommend using half of the sugar and half of the oil.  That's how I made it, and it tasted delicious.

Wow!  This was really good.  I used iceberg instead of bib lettuce, and added radishes because my 5 year old loves them.  I only used 1/3 cup sugar and 3/4 cup oil for the dressing, and used fresh strawberries.  Will definitely make again- everyone enjoyed it.

This is a GREAT salad! I cut the oil in half to reduce calories and fat.  My husband agreed that this was the kind of salad we usually only get in restaurants.

I made this salad tonight, my picky daughters & myself LOVED IT! The changes I made was I only used 1/2 cup of vegetable oil. Others thought the sauce was too sweet, I think it came out perfect. I used 1 head of iceberg lettuce. I marinated the chicken in creamy italian dressing for 10 mins before cooking. DO NOT let the pecans cook for 8 mins, I almost burned them. Add 1 teaspoon of butter to the pan & let them brown on LOW HEAT for about 3 mins. I also omitted the onion & the mustard. I don't think its needed. I used strawberries and 2 mandarin fruit cups and added te juice to the sauce. YUMMY & DELICIOUS is what I have to say about this recipe. I will DEFINITELY make this again!

Made this tonight as it was easy and my wife was so deserving of a break + with one guest coming I wanted something different. Fantastic! Only change I made was substituted white for brown sugar. Everyone loved this salad. Thanks for sharing.

I had some friends over so we had 4 picky kids plus adults to feed.  This was great because the kids could still pick out the foods they like to eat and leave off any dressings & eat a good meal.  I served it with pears and craisins.  It was delicious & we had cornbread on the side.

This recipe was great...I did make the following modifications- I only used 1/3 cup of sugar in the dressing- it was perfect blend!! For the pecans, I used 2 tbs brown sugar and I Can't Believe It's Not Butter!!  By mixing the dry ingredients only, I was able to keep the salad for two days, as it makes a great addition to any menu.

My husband and I thought this recipe was pretty good except for the salad dressing. I made the mistake of mincing half a red onion for the salad dressing and it was way too much onion and the taste was too strong. We ended up eating it with zesty italian dressing. I cooked the chicken in the George Foreman grill too and that turned out good.

Yum! The dressing is fab! I find that the full recipe for the dressing is too much, though. I usually decrease the amount of sugar, and sometimes, use Splenda instead. I always use strawberries. :)

I can't get enough of this salad. I've made it every which way depending on what ingredients I have on hand, strawberries or oranges, pecans or even regular untoasted roasted almonds, it still tastes delicious! The dressing makes all the difference. Definitely, definitely a keeper.

OMG! I made this last night and I have to agree with reviewer Cliff when he said ".. when you took a bite with bits of each the explosion of flavor in your mouth was pure extasy". He is absolutely right! I had my doubts about this recipe but I'm sure glad I made it. I followed the recipe with two exceptions. Reduced both the oil and sugar to 1/2 cup each (as others suggested) and blended well (daughter hates onions). Added fresh strawberries (sliced very thin), canned mangos and canned mandarin oranges (also cut into tiny pieces). Excellent recipe. I worried it might be too healthy to be decadent. Boy was I wrong! I didn't think anything this healthy and low in calories could taste sooo good. It was sinfully good! Thanks sooo much for the recipe Karena! Definitely going into my year round rotation!

Great salad! Instead of vegtable oil, I used extra virgin olive oil, honey roasted almonds, Splenda(instead of sugar) and of course, strawberries.

For the chicken I used the recipe from the site "Unbelievable Chicken".  I made that for dinner and double the chicken and then used it for this salad the next night.  Incredible!  A great summer meal with a glass of wine!

What a great recipe for dinner on a hot day! I combined the advice of several other reviewers and reduced the sugar in the dressing to 1/4 cup, the vegetable oil to 2/3 cup and used 1/2 a minced shallot for the onion. To toast the pecans, I put them in a 325 degree oven for 4 minutes - no problem with scorching this way. I did use strawberries, as local ones have just come out, but look forward to trying this recipe with other fruit as others have suggested. There is also dressing left over to put on greens. Thanks for the recipe Karena

This is also great if you take out the chicken and replace with 3 oz. cream cheese cut into small chunks (freeze it first) I also add chopped onion. Sounds weird but it is my signature salad!

Made this as a side salad to dinner with out the chicken and it was Fabulous.  Used only 1/4 red onion.  Color of dressing not great looking, but taste great.  I agree, this is quality salad you usually get out.  Easy to make and everyone from 20YO male to 70 YO female loved it.  Had a little trouble w/pecans, burned them twice.  8 min on med high seems like too much.  Cooked them on low and watched carefully.  Will make again, thank you!

We LOVED it!  My husband, who usually is not one for something like this, (he gets hungry soon after eating), actually really enjoyed it, and wants it often.  This filled him up.  I thought there was a bit too much oil for us in the original recipe and used the dressing suggested by another reviewer - 1/3 cup sugar, 1/3 cup EVOO and 1/3 cup red wine vinegar. We had frozen grilled chicken breasts in the freezer, so that made prep easy and fast. I also had some pineapple chunks left over and put those in, too.We had crunchy whole wheat ciabatta bread with it - Wow!

To really add a little more depth of flavor, coat the chicken with Mrs. Dash Garlic Herb blend. I have only done this in a skillet lightly oiled with olive oil, so am not sure if it would burn on the grill or not. This gives a great contrast of flavors with the sweet dressing and fruit.

I loved this recipe. I usually never make my own salad dressings, but after making this one I'm going to try and make my own from now on. I used fresh rasberrys and cut up orange slices on this salad, but I can see using just about any kind of fresh fruit. I also added slices of fried up wontons for a little extra crunch. If you love sweetness on chicken and like salads with life, you won't regret making this one.

Great recipe for someone who is unfamiliar with the mechanics of salads.  I now feel prepared to experiment with other ideas!

OMG!!! So Good!  The only change I made was to add only half the sugar.  I made it with apples, but I can tell it would be good with any type of fruit - very versatile.  My husband loved it too - Said it was the best dinner salad he has ever had!

I marinated my chicken in some zesty italian dressing (let stand about 5 min. before cutting into it to hold in the juices very tender & juciey). I also changed the vegatable oil to 1/2 evoo and 1/2 vegtable oil. Toasted whole almonds in the toaster. Instead of ground mustard (I was out)I put in some yellow mustard from the fridge. My husband loved it, wants to know when I am making it again he says this week would be good for him.

I used fresh strawberries, then added a few to the dressing mixture.  It was delicious!  Canned chicken would probably be better than grilled.  Will try it next time. :]

My family loved this and is begging for more. I did alter the dressing recipe adding only 1/3 cup of sugar instead of 1/2 cup. Also I used oranges because they were on sale but can't wait to try it with berries!

I needed a side salad to go along with our dinner and came across this recipe. Since it wasn't our main dish, I left out the chicken - and it was wonderful! The onion was a teeny bit too strong (I used a yellow onion), but I think it would have been fine if I hadn't left the chicken out. I also served the dressing on the side so the leftovers wouldn't get mushy.

Great recipe! Others suggested reducing the oil and sugar and I did so. The dressing was delicious. I had no vegetable oil so I used EVOO and shallot instead of onion. I used Romaine lettuce,fresh strawberries and forgot the pecans. For the chicken I marinated it overnight in the white wine vinegar, orange juice and herbs of Provence. This gave the chicken a great flavor. I would use this recipe again and try other salad greens and fruits.

Wonderful recipe.  Simple, easy and elegant...and so very adaptable. Even if you change the fruit, the nuts and/or the method of cooking the chicken, it will still be delicious. I baked the brined chicken at 360 for 20 minutes, with a light basting of balsamic vinaigrette (grilling was not an option) but otherwise followed the recipe. Alas, there were no left-overs. Everyone asked for the recipe. This is definitely a keeper - so simple to prepare and so good to eat.

I used raspberry vinegar, 3/4 cup of oil and 1/4 cup of water and replaced the sugar with Stevia.  It was a huge hit with the friends I made it for who asked for the recipe for the dressing.

Dressing was wonderful! Used Hazelnuts instead of what was recommended in recipe. Used clementines as fruit - unfortunately they had seeds. Overall, a very good chicken/salad recipe. Would recommend it.

This salad is awesome.  As Karena wrote it is beautiful in presentation and taste.  The only changes I made were to use Splenda instead of sugar, and I added some crumbled feta cheese.  It is one of the best salads I have eaten.  Give it a try!

This salad is amazing. Mom and I loved it. The dressing is incredible although I halved the oil and substituted the sugar for splenda for calorie saving purposes. I also marinated the chicken overnight with a mustard dressing, salt and pepper. Thanks Karena!

This was sooo good! I made this salad with left-over "Yummy Honey Grilled Chicken (kabobs)" recipe from this site. It was so delicious! I made a few changes - I added diced red onion, Persian cucumbers, and chopped sugar snap peas to the salad part. I changed the dressing to reduce the sugar and oil - I used 1/3 cup red wine vinegar, 1/3 cup sugar and 1/3 c. olive oil. I added the other dressing ingredients that were called for in the original recipe. I will make this again! Great dinner for leftover grilled chicken!

This is so good. I made it as is and used strawberries. I did lightly season the chicken when I grilled it. I absolutely loved the dressing. I would make this without the chicken too. So Good. I will have to try it with other fruits too.

Crisp, cool, and refreshing on a sultry night in the Second City.  Swapped out the pecans for sunflower seeds to give a more summery pizzazz.  Also, goat cheese lended a creamy element that was the perfect balance for the crisp produce.  Will definitely make again, after we finish the extra dressing, that is!

On a hot summer night in Texas this was delightful and refreshing. Used EVOO, honey roasted pecans and fresh strawberries. I think most fruits would work with the dressing depending on the season.

My fiance and I loved everything about this salad.  In fact, he said I could make it anytime.  Flavors combine nicely and dressing is delicious.  I did reduce sugar and oil as suggested by others and marinated my chicken breasts in balsamic vinegar.  May add blue cheese crumbles next time.  I think it would add a nice kick.

EXCELLENT!  A couple of modifications that really made it:  marinated the chicken in Caesar dressing I had, caramelized the pecans in sugar, and used red onion.  We really enjoyed this and it's sure to be a summertime favorite at our house.

Super easy and quick and makes plenty of dressing. I used black pepper and mustard. I took it to a dinner party and had several people comment on how good it was and they also asked for the recipe. Will make again!

This is one of my favorite salads.  I always have the dressing prepared in my fridge, it's that good!  Equally delish using all given ingredients or using raspberry vinegar.  I use 1/4 of splenda instead of the sugar when making this.  Everyone I serve this to loves it! :)

This was really good!  I made it with a bit less oil, almonds instead of pecans since that is what I had and used some leftover grilled chicken that had been marinated.  Not one drop was left.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Delicious Salad.  Will definitely make again.  Didn't put all of the dressing in the salad, left some out so people could add more if desired.

This recipe was incredible!!!! My twist was using 3 small bags of salad greens and adding 2 small cans (drained) of mandarin oranges. I also marinated my chicken overnite in italian dressing before browning it in a pan with olive oil. My guests ate this as their main dish and devoured it minutes. Next time I'll double it. The dressing was perfect.

This is quite possibly the best salad I have ever eaten! Made the dressing as is, AWESOME!!! Marinated my chicken in mango juice then grilled it, tasted great! I added mandarin oranges as well. The one thing I will say is to be very,very careful when toasting the pecans(if this is your first time doing that, it was my first) they can burn very easily. Thank you so much!!

This is one of my favorite salads, especially if we are having guests over. I do change up the sugar and oil ratios in the dressing. Ilike my dressing more tangy than sweet. Awesome recipe!!

For the best flavor marinate the chicken breasts.  The dressing is wonderful!  I usually use 1/2 cup of olive oil in place of the 1 cup of vegetable oil.  sometimes I make it even faster by using store bought roasted chicken and a box of washed mixed baby salad greens.  Strawberries are my favorite but if they are out of season this is great with canned mandarin oranges and blueberries too.

Sooooo tasty!!!  All of the flavors went together so wonderfully.  We used strawberries, which we didn't think would go well with the other flavors.  Boy, we were wrong.  There was a small bit leftover, which I added more greens to and ate for lunch the next day.  Even the leftovers were amazingly tasty.  I can not wait to make this time and time again!!

10-25-15.    Made again for dinner last night, with some minor changes. Produce market was out of strawberries, so I had to use fresh clementines.   Also, I ran out of pecans, but had plenty of sliced almonds. I toasted them up and in they went. Lastly, to my surprise i was out of red wine vinegar.  I had plenty of white, so white it was!  Even with alterations this received rave reviews from the family!!

The dressing makes this salad!  Delicious!  I use strawberries and dried apples for the fruit, grilled the chicken slices and some red pepper slices on a panini press, and substituted spinach and romaine lettuce for the bibb lettuce.  Added a few slices of carrots, celery, and radishes too... and left the salt out of the dressing.

This was a very good salad.  I served it as a side dish for friends so I left out the chicken but added green onions and feta cheese.   Sooooo yummy, we all could have skipped the rest of the dinner and just ate this. I will cut back on the sugar next time and make it for my lunch.

This is a great salad! Even my boyfriend loved it. I did exactly as CarolinaGirl did with strawberries, mandarins, raspberries and half the sugar. Except In the dressing I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. It gives it better consistently, or maybe I'm just a biased Italian :) Def will make again!

I made the dressing with pomegranate balsamic vinegar and a little over 1/2 the sugar and only 1/2 the oil.  I also added a handful of fresh raspberries.  I liked it, but the family wasn't crazy about it.  I probably won't make it again.

Just made this for dinner tonight & even my husband loved it (who only uses Thousand Island on salads no matter what)!  We both loved the berries (strawberries & blackberries), the sweet dressing (I used 1/2 Splenda, 1/2 sugar and 1/2 veg oil 1/2 olive oil), and I marinated the chicken in balsamic vinaigrette as another reviewer suggested.  Definitely will be making this again.

We really enjoyed this salad.  I followed the recipe except for using just 1/2 cup oil, which didn't seem to make it any less flavorful.  I made the recipe for just two--used 1 chicken breast for each plate, 1/2 bag of mixed greens for each, 1/2 the strawberries and pecans, and 1/2 the dressing recipe.  Seemed just about right for a main dish meal.  Was delicious.  Will make again.

I pounded the breasts to a uniform thickness and marinated them in lemon juice, olive oil and fresh garlic before grilling.  This dish was delicious and received many compliments - particularly on the dressing!  Yum.

I loved it!  I used two little onions from my garden, and the dressing seemed a little oniony to me.  My husband loved it though!  I also marinated my chicken in a mesquite marinate and added Webers Kickin chicken spice to it as well.  Marinated for many hours then grill and cut it up!  SO GOOD!

Made this for weekend barbeque. People enjoyed it. Want recipe. I personallly think dressing is too sweet, will add less sugar next time, and instead of walnuts maybe add sliced pecans. Will make again.

it was an excellent salad. I used 1/2 of a red onion and it gave the dressing a pretty pink color. I will use this dressing for lots of salads. It's delicious.

Thank you so much for this idea. I'm not a huge salad eater but recently have had to change my diet and mixing the fruits in really gave me the kick I needed to try it. I will be enjoying this one again.

Good recipe. I didn't use the fruit though. I just used regular salad greens and vegetables. I grilled chicken strips on my indoor grill and used regular bottled dressing. It still tasted pretty good. I may use the fruit the next time.

We made this with strawberries and the little yellow mangoes. My expectations were not high as the recipe seems basic but this is fantastic.

Made for company dinner. Made dressing as described and perfect. Added mandarins (small can drained) and purple grapes cut in half. Served with crusty rolls/butter. A nice light menu for weary travelers.

Absolutely delicious salad that my whole family loved.  4 stars instead of 5 because of issues with the dressing.  The amount of dressing was WAY too much for the amount of salad, so I'll have to find a way to use up the leftovers.  Also, the level of sugar was too high.  I halved the amount of sugar, and  it was still VERY sweet.  It could have used even less.  I prefer a 2:1 ratio of oil to vinegar in my dressings, so I cut the oil to 2/3 cup, and that was just right for me.  I plan to make this recipe often (with my modifications).

I thought it was delicious and would  give it  5 stars, my husband who is very fussy thought it was OK but not great.  I would make again, there is so much he does't like that you have to take with a grain of salt, he did not even use the dressing.

The best salad dressing I've ever had.  So simple, yet delicious.  I marinated the chicken in pineapple juice and let the family choose their fruits - strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, pineapples, and mandarin oranges.  Dinner and dessert!

This was great! I did take the advice of others and cut the sugar in half; it was still too sweet! So I added about a tablespoon or so of dijon mustard and a dash of worcestershire sauce. Much better. The pecans really made it; next time I'll add more. Fruit on hand was strawberries and blueberries. A very refreshing and light meal!

I've made this salad MANY times.  My son has called me from college several times asking for the recipe.  You have so much flexibility when making this salad.  Whatever fruit you happen to have on hand works great.  I typically use strawberries and blueberries in the summer and will use canned mandarin oranges in the winter.  As others have done I too reduce the amount of sugar in the dressing significantly.

This is my go to recipe for a great salad. I have made it 10 times at least and everyone LOVES it. I rarely review recipes but finally realized this one deserves it.

This is my family's FAVORITE meal - ranking right up there with pizza! I have shared this recipe more times than I can count. You can make it ahead of time so it is ready to serve when you get home from work. We LOVE this recipe. My kids don't like onions, so we omit them, and we use spicy brown mustard instead of dry because it is what we have. Serving this with fresh French Bread to soak up any remaining dressing is fantastic!

This recipe is delicious!!!  Any fresh berries go well with it!!!  I roast my pecans then pour a little maple syrup while pan is still hot and caramelize the maple syrup onto the pecans!!!  To die for!!!  One recipe is more than sufficient!!!

This was the best salad ever! My husband and I couldn't believe how good it was.  I did what several reviewers recommended:  reduced the amount of sugar in the dressing and marinated the chicken before cooking.  I didn't want to fire up the grill for just 2 pieces of chicken, so cooked it in a pan on the stove. Oh yes, and I just used the romaine and iceberg lettuce I had on hand.  Wonderful wonderful!!
For the marinade, I used a little each of the following: orange juice, pineapple juice, powdered garlic, Montreal Steak Seasoning and olive oil - just things I had on hand. The salad dressing is what makes this salad, no matter what other ingredients you add.

Absolutely fantastic. I used a spring mix and included crumbled goat cheese. Good enough to make me create an account and give it 5 stars.

This is delicious.  All of my family, including my two twenty something boys, loved this.  I made the mistake of using a red onion (out of white) and the dressing looked like pepto bismal, but that it tasted wonderful.  I also added feta cheese for a little more salt to counter the sweet from the dressing.

Definitely cut the sugar in half.  I cut it by a third, and it still was quite sweet, especially with sweet fruit.  Very easy recipe for a warm day.  I marinated the chicken for a bit in a balsamic dressing that I had only a little left.  It gave the chicken some flavor and gave me a container to put this recipe's dressing in.  Serve with garlic bread.

Awesome. I don't normally like vinaigrette dressings, but this was phenomenal. My son, who hates onion loved it, even after I told him what was in it, and gave it a rave review FoodTV-style. I did use about 3/4c oil and a little less than 1/2c sugar. The slight spice from the pepper and the onion flavor was perfect. You could use onion powder or onion salt, as some strawberry spinach recipes do, but I think the fresh onion just makes it much better. I used a spring salad and some spinach because it's just what I had around. Everything else I always have around, so this is a fabulous quick spring or summer dinner when I can't think of anything else. We used strawberries and mandarin oranges, but I think this would definitely work with pears, apples, raisins, dried cranberries...just about anything you can imagine on a salad. I was specifically requested by my pickiest eater to have this again and often. Great recipe. Thank you!
