It says mild curry powder.  Curry is a mixture of spices.  ANY change you make to a curry, and it becomes yours and not the author's.  PLEASE at least a few of us need to rate it AS IS.  It's not like chicken recipes where you get to say "3 more minutes in the oven and a squeeze of lemon saved this recipe."  

A curry is something you accept or don't accept.  

That is my story and I'm sticking to it.

I think this rendition of a mild curry is excellent.  As another reviewer stated, it didn't have any of the sweet spices.  I am a home chef for a food publication and just recently, a recipe was given to me that required "curry powder."  I bought a bottle, but it's at work, since I also fix lunch for the office.  I was desperate because it was the last night to review the test recipe.

This mild curry powder was a fantastic base for the "curry gravy."  It lends itself to hundreds of variations.  

But just let this one be.

This was an amazing mild curry powder.  I especially loved that it did not have any of the sweet spices that are put into curry powder nowadays but that really make it taste like garam masala.  The only things I changed was substituting prepared dijon mustard (1 tbsp) for the mustard seeds and adding some chili powder (not mexican kind).  When I used the mix in a curry dish, I also added a bay leaf.

I have made this twice, the first time exactly as written (using a spice grinder) and I wasn't impressed. It didn't have a nice blend of flavor and the cumin seemed to overwhelm the blend. But it was mild, which I was looking for cooking for young children.    The second time I used 1T of cumin seeds instead of ground cumin and that seemed to improve the flavor a bit.

This worked great for us.  I did not have corriander and used peppercorns in place.  Very good recipe for a basic curry powder!

Awesome used in Madras Curry chicken!  Smells great too.  I subbed some things like Garam Masala instead of gr coriander since I didn't have any on hand and used 1 tsp Chinese hot mustard for the mustard and red pepper flakes.  It turned out nice for the kids - you might up it some for some added kick.  Will keep in pantry for many more recipes.  (We mixed it with  1 cup yogurt and basted/baked chicken drumsticks with it - AWESOME!)

VERY mild.  I was running out of my regular brand curry...this was nice for a change and easy, but I prefer McCormick's - I know...sad but true.

Used this for a chicken curry salad tonight when we didn't have any more curry powder. Tasted great! Used 1/4 tsp ground cayenne pepper instead of 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper.

I was a curry virgin and this blend was great for me because I didn't have to wonder whether I would open a readymade jar and find that it was spicier than I liked. My whole family enjoyed it; we thought it was flavorful and fragrant without being too hot. In fact we might even add a touch more chili next time.

Perfect! I ran out of curry powder RIGHT in the middle of a recipe (of course) and found this in time to save my lamb curry. :-) Thanks!

I thought it was very tasty and was relieved to find a make-your-own for this. I have purchased the jar kind...but don't think I'll be going back to that. I did add 1/8 tsp. of onion powder and 1/4 tsp. of cayenne (I like it spic-ay). :) Thank you so much for the recipe!!

I've been using this for Vietnamese curry, and it's delicious!!  Love it!!  I don't change anything from the original recipe.  I put onion and garlic in the Vietnamese curry, so you do need to have those in your recipe when you use this mild curry powder.  This recipe is better than any other I've tried.

I MADE A CURRY FOR SEASONING BULGAR.  FOR 8 SERVINGS FROM THE RECIPE INGREDIANTS, I ADDED:
 1/4t POWDERED ONION
 1/4t GROUND BLACK PEPPER
 1/8t GROUND CLOVES
 1/4t GROUND NUTMEG
THE PERSONS EATING THE BULGAR SAID THE CURRY FLAVORING WAS EXCELLENT.  CURRY IS A MIXTURE OF VARIOUS SPICES AND HERBS; AND CAN BE ADJUSTED BY ADDING OR DELETIN GTHE INGREDIANTS

I don't care for curry, generally, but I enjoyed this one. Some other raters talk about the lack of 'sweet' spices, so I guess that is why. It is very mild (to MY mind, though my hubby thought it had a kick). It was a little work, grinding some of the spices, but I liked it enough that I plan on making some to keep in stock for next time. Fabulous recipe!

I'm new to curry and my itty bitty local market doesn't stock the prepared version.   So to save myself a 20 mile trip to the big city I made this using ingredients available locally. I plan on keeping it as a base and working from there. So happy I found this recipe.  I know I'll build from it again and again.

In the middle of trying out a new recipe, I realized we were out of curry which was one of the main ingredients that I needed. A quick online search lead me here and I had everything on hand to quickly make it. Great flavor for a mild curry. Thanks!!!

Very good flavor. I was without mustard seed and red pepper flakes, but I subbed 2 cardamom pods and chili powder in lieu.  I tried it on curried rice and it was outstanding. If you need a recipe for curry powder, I would recommend this, it does the trick.

Started making my favorite shrimp curry recipe and discovered I was out of Yellow Curry Powder. Probably had that can for 10 years. Anyway, I decided to look for a recipe to make the curry powder myself since I had already started the dish. This recipe was easier than a few others I found. I had all the ingredients on hand....and it was terrific. Tasted just exactly how my dish has tasted that I have been making for 50 years!!! That's right 50. I didn't change a thing.

I made this curry powder to use in Fruity Curry Chicken Salad (recipe on this site) and it tasted fabulous!  I like the fact that this spice mix has minimal heat to it.  I enjoy some dishes very spicy and others milder, and this will allow me to add however much heat I want by adding some cayenne or red pepper flakes or any other source of capsaicin to taste in each recipe.

Flavorful, and savory, this made a wonderful yellow curry. Thankfully, it also emptied my stock of coriander which gave me the perfect vessel to store it in. Pro tip: use a mortar and pestle on those mustard seeds first; if using a food processor, they may not break down fully.

I can't believe this got so many good reviews. In my opinion, this blend was disgusting. It was bland, and the cumin overpowered all the other flavors. I had to really debate between 1 and 2 stars, and only went with 2 because it was  at least edible. I found a curry blend recipe on another site with way more mustard and turmeric, way less cumin, chile powder instead of red pepper, and a little bit of cardamon and cayenne, that tasted much better than this recipe.

I will definitely keep making this! Used with Goya coconut milk, carrots, scallions, portabella, and chicken. Was mild, so we added more flakes to our dish. I've saved this recipe, but will double the red pepper in the future. We love spice!

Great Mixture. Works great for quick curry recipes, when you don't have the time to slowly add the ingredients a little at a time.
