My family loves the chicken and dislikes the sauce. We eat this regularly, but use a chipotle ranch sauce instead.

When I read the recipe, I was skeptical about the sauce with the combination of chipotle peppers, yogurt and peanut butter.  I overlooked this due to the various glowing reviews of the sauce.

I wish I trusted my instincts.  The sauce ruined an otherwise good recipe.  If the sauce combinations of recipes gives you pause, trust your instincts.

I was a little weary of the sauce, but it is really good on the pitas.  It tasted a little strange when I tasted it on it's own, but it really compliments the pitas well.  My husband didn't even use the sauce, and he loved them.  Very easy, very healthy.  Great recipe!

This reminded me of a mole sauce recipe I make. Love the sauce, made wraps vs pita's. A definite make again recipe. I too added garlic and onions.

Really, really good.    I added garlic to the onion and bell pepper saute and only used 1 1/2 chipotle peppers and 3 tbsp peanut butter (instead of 4) in the sauce.  For those of you who are as skeptical about the peanut butter as I was, don't be...it works and you can't really tell it's there. I think I would still stick with 3 tbsp peanut butter instead of 4, otherwise the peanut butter taste might be more obvious.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  I found that the sauce was still too spicy for my family's taste (even my husband thought it was too spicy, which is rare).  I also thought there was too much sauce, you could probably cut the recipe in half.  Then again, maybe if it were less spicy, we would have used more sauce.  I loved the spices used on the chicken and I really enjoyed how everything tasted together.  In the future I will probably use only 1 pepper, maybe even a little less.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

Like others, I used a little less peanut butter because the reviews made me nervous. I happened to love the flavor of the sauce, but my fiance hated it (he found it "offensive"). It definitely is different-tasting, so I think people either love it or hate it.

Great recipe!  I was looking for something fun and different for a summer dinner and this was it!  I agree with other reviewers that this makes a ton of sauce, I will half it next time. It's quite spicy so you don't need a lot.  I marinated the chicken for a few hours with those spices and some extra virgin olive oil and then grilled the chicken.  It had great flavor.  I prefer all meats grilled though.  Thanks for the recipe, will make these again soon!

A family favorite!  My husband especially loves the blend of chipotle and peanut butter... It's spicy, but the peanut butter takes out some of the kick... We've added fresh broccoli pieces a few times and some fresh peas once as a well - it tastes great with both!  As it's getting warmer, this is our family's most-requested list!

Peanut butter added an odd taste. Could use less of it or none at all. Other than that, it was tasty.

I made this for a picnic for my wife.  I was a little worried about the sauce at first so I used it sparingly.  I spread it on the pita and then added the chicken to it.  It was great!  We both loved all the flavors coming together.  Because we didn't use a whole lot of the sauce, we have enough for another round of pitas.  Great recipe!

This was good but the sauce was a little strange for me.  I think it definitely needed some honey or sweetness to it.  I might try again with a few changes though.

I like fast and easy and good. This filled them all. I too added olive oil to the rub and used as a marinade then cooked the chicken on the grill.  The sauce was great, everyone loved it and I made it as written. My husband not only had seconds but was making sure I made enough for his lunch the next day.

Very good with a nice flavor, I added a little more of the Peppers b/c my family likes it spicy.  Even my Husband, who does not like chicken, enjoyed this meal.

These were very good!  I made them for a tailgating event and they went over well.  My local grocer did not have chipotle peppers, so I used Tabasco brand Chipotle Pepper Sauce.  It worked wonderful - just add a little at a time until it has the taste you desire.  I'll definitely be making this again!

I was a little scared of the chipotle's cause I don't like spicy food. This sauce with the pitas was great. You could use the sauce on lots of other things. Very good and fast to make.

When tasted alone, the chipotle sauce was a little too smokey for my taste buds but when added to the sandwich, it was very good!  Will make again!!

I don't know how to really rate this recipe because I only tried the sauce. I was wary, and still am. Perhaps it needs to chicken or the pita to make it more palatable. I would probably agree with others that it was quite odd, and didn't seem to agree with the chipotle and peanut butter mix. I'll keep experimenting to see what other options might be.

Really good, could not find chipotle peppers so the sauce was a little too mild. I am not taking off points for that, but i rarely give 5's. Husband liked it. I may grill the chicken next time. I think grilled chicken tastes better than any other method of cooking.

An easy, healthy, AND tasty recipe.  I'm a garlic lover so added a couple cloves to the onion/red pepper saute.  Also, I didn't have any pitas on hand so made tortilla wraps instead.  Finally, for all you wild game lovers out there, I substituted pheasant for the chicken.  Delicious!

you would think that peanut butter wouldn't go well with this, but you can't really taste it and it has a wonderful texture. great use for leftover chicken and for lunches.
