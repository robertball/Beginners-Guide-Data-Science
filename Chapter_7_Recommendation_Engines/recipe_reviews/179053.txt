This soup is cooking right now. It looks/smells good. I needed to alter the recipe because there didn't appear to be enough liquid. I had to double both the salsa and the chicken broth. I dont think the measurements are correct

I thought this was a really good base recipe, but I made some changes. I thought it was a bit bland, so I added extra salsa, some green chiles, some cayenne pepper and a couple carrots. Also, I served it over a bed of rice covered in a little cheddar cheese. It was awesome. Even my picky 5 year old ate it!

Absolutey Awesome !!! I give 5 star ratings quite often because that's usually the rating that the recipes on Allrecipes are that I pick to try. But this one is outstanding. So very simple and S-o-o-o-o very tasty. Two thumbs up !!! The only thing different was I used 3 cans of beans 'cause we're bean lovers and my wife threw in some Corn Tortilla chips and it turned into a tortilla soup. This will be a fixture in our house for many years to come.

Super delicious and easy. Following the suggestion of another reviewer I shredded the chicken and doubled the liquids and it came out perfect. Put a little cheddar cheese on top, a dollop of lite sour cream and some cilantro. This will become one of my regular recipes.

Followed directions mainly but added 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper and chopped cilantro for garnish and it was great.  Felt unsure about the recipe having flavor but I was very suprised.  My husband ate all the leftovers

DELICIOUS!  I made this soup for my niece who is watching her weight...and now I have to make it for her almost weekly.  She and her boyfriend LOVE it!! I added cilantro at the end and WOW, what a dish!  I cooked it on the stovetop slowly and it thickened a bit...thanks for a healthy, delicious recipe. Annie T., Bklyn, NY

Great recipe!  Simple, healthy, and you already have most of the ingredients on hand.  I skipped the slow cooker part - what's the point of a slow cooker if you have to cook the chicken before hand?  I simmered on the stove and it turned out great.  I pretty much followed the recipe, adding shredded carrots because I needed to use them up.  I always add more seasoning.  Overall great recipe - thanks!

Delicious and super easy (the way I did it).... I just threw 3 whole frozen skinless boneless chicken breast halves into the crockpot with all the other ingredients (except I added the beans the last hour so they wouldn't get all mushy) and I substituted a 15 oz can of mexican style diced tomatoes for the salsa... cooked on low for about 10 hours, shredded the chicken, put back in and added the beans and cooked for another hour.  WONDERFUL!

My husband and I love this recipe.  I did use the salsa verde after reading some of the other reviews.  It made the recipe!  It was just him and me eating it so it took us 3 days but it got better over time.  Will be making this again and often!

This was very good in the end, but I could see some obvious ways to improve it right off the bat, therefore I did. Brown the chicken whole and then shred it. Since you're dirtying a pan by browing the chicken anyway, add the onions to the pan to sautee first instead of putting straight into the slowcooker. When all is done, use a little of the broth to deglaze the pan with. I could see the amount of cumin called for being really overpowering, so I only used 1 teaspoon, and made up the other with chili powder. I used freshly cooked beans and low sodium broth and this soup was still fairly salty and very flavorful, so beware if you use canned beans and regular salt broth. Rinse the beans really well. I also found I needed to add a lot more broth. I'll be adding this one to our favorite soup folder as everyone loved it.

For us, Campbell’s Kitchen recipes tend to be a bit bland probably because they sell more products if targeting a broad population. Knowing that, we upped the spice and gave it some heat. While browning the chicken, added a seasoning mix, and dumped everything into the slow cooker. Added 2, thinly sliced habanero chili peppers, seeded which definitely gave this a suitable kick for us (one may be enough if only wanting mild heat). 2 cups of sliced carrots were added simply because they were leftover, and didn’t want them to waste. Used 2 cups of low sodium chicken broth instead of 1 3/4 cups, and glad we did. We were pleased with this dish, and it will be made again.

I did not make this soup in a slow cooker, but did it in a kettle on top of the stove.  I substituted white kidney beans for the small white beans and canned whole kernel corn for frozen. 5 stars all around. Served it with tortilla chips on the side. YUMMY!

Delicious and healthy! And easy :) 

As with most soups, the quantities are pretty flexible. . . I just kind of added more of this or that till it tasted right and had the right amount of liquids and solids, etc.

So I ended up doubling the broth, the salsa, and the garlic. I also used 2 cans of chicken instead of frozen. I sauteed the onions and garlic together and browned the chicken with it before adding it to the crockpot. I reduced the cumin a bit and also added about a tsp of chili powder, a Tbsp or so of brown sugar, half a can of green chiles, pepper, and onion salt.

Next time I'll add canned diced tomatoes and more sauteed onion. 

Serve with sour cream, grated mozzerella cheese, fresh cilantro, and chips! It's basically taco soup without the rice :) Yum!

This was okay. Too spicy for my daughter, and I wasn't wowed, but my husband thought it was excellent. Three stars from me, Five from him. The only change I made were to use black beans instead of white (family preference). I used cooked, shredded chicken, and Medium Pace Salsa.

I had to change this up a little bit to avoid running out to the store just for the salsa. Instead I used a can of diced tomatoes w/garlic and olive oil from Fresh and Easy that I had on hand. I added 1/4 cup of chopped pickled tamed jalapenos to the tomatoes and then hit it with my immersion blender. ( I have picky eaters and one refuses to eat any chunky tomatoes, peppers or onions.) I also added 1 Tbl. of homemade taco seasoning (from this website) to this along with the rest of the ingredients and slow simmered it on the stove top all afternoon. Amazing even with the substitution. Hurray for immersion blenders.

Everyone must make this meal!!!! It tasted so amazing!!!! 
I did not cook the chicken before putting in the crockpot...like someone said earlier whats to point of using the crock pot then....I used about 2 cups of chicken broth to make it a bit more soupy and added 2 cans of beans. I did not have garlic cloves or onion so just replaced with adding garlic salt and onion powder....put all of that with corn and salsa, had a random jalepano leftover from cooking something earleir in week so sliced it open and put it in whole for flavoring and of course the cumin and let it go on low for about 7 hours....omg!! It was amazing...topped with some cheese and it was great..I can't stop thinking about how good it was!

My family liked this, but I used black beans. I also didn't have time to cut and brown the chicken, so I just put a couple of chicken breasts into the soup and shredded them when the soup was done. Served with cheese, tortilla chips and sour cream. Yummy!

This was good. I ran out of liquid so I would increase that. Also, being pregnant, I had a problem stomaching the chicken. I decided this would be very good with just different types of beans. I will try that next time.

I had some of this soup in the can as a demo at BJ's, but it was about $3 for 2 cups and high in sodium.   It was SO good, I came here to see if you have recipe.   Thank you so much.

My kids loved this soup! It was zesty without being spicey hot. I did alter very slightly. It needed more liquid so I added 1 more cup of broth and I only added 1 teaspoon of cumin instead of 2. I will Definitely be making this again.

Just okay, nothing special.  I didn't have any Thick and Chunky Salsa, so I used my homemade salsa.  Maybe it wasn't spicy enough.

This was so great and easy!!!  I did make a few modifications. First, we always like having leftovers so I doubled the recipe. While I cooked the chicken in the pan I tossed the pieces in chili powder. I didn't have white beans, so I used one can black beans and one can pinto beans. I also added a bit of cayenne for some extra kick.  I'll definitely be making this again! It was so easy.

I used dry white beans (canned foods are unhealthy) and brought them to a boil, let them sit and cool for an hour then threw everything into my slow cooker on high for 5 hours.  This was Very Good - no leftovers.  Will make over and over again.

Great slow cooker soup.  I used already cooked chiecken so this came together in minutes.  I had 1/2 can leftover black beans, so I threw those in with the white beans.  Topped with sour cream and cheese, and everyone enjoyed it.

This was very good.  I did not pre-cook the chicken but I did saute the onion and garlic in EVOO before adding to the crock pot.  I also used Rotel instead of salsa and added a can of diced jalapenos.  Cooked everything on high for 5 hours. Turned out great!

This recipe was a good start. However, I recommend adding a can of V8 juice. As is this was pretty thick. I added additional salsa and chicken broth after I realized that it was not going to yeild the extra soup I had hoped for and was still left wanting more of a tomato base. I served it with tortilla chips and fresh avacado and cilantro ... wouldn't dare serve without because it is kinda plain! Green chilies may also be a good addition. This could also be converted into a vegetarian soup omitting chicken and replacing chicken broth with vegetable.

We enjoyed this soup (really more like a stew) but found it to be just average (3 stars).  I did not cook the chicken breasts but just threw them in the crock pot along with the other ingredients.  They were easy to shred at the end of cook time. I was surprised that no salt was called for or needed. Next time, I will probably add more beans, chicken broth, and salsa. **2nd night - husband insisted I raise this soup to 4 stars.  I added more liquid and the flavor was better.  Might be one of those soups that is better the 2nd night.

This was fantastic!  I made some changes... first i used 1lb ground turkey because that's what i had.  I cooked the turkey with the onion and garlic and also threw in some shredded carrots to cut down on cook time.  I used 2 cans of chicken broth, 2 cans of navy beans and 1 can of corn.  I increased the salsa to 1 1/2 cups (actually used Pace picante cuz it's what i had).  Put in some extra cumin and also added 1 tsp of onion powder and 2 tsp of chili powder and about 1/2 tsp or so of crushed red pepper.  Brought to a boil and let simmer for about 45 min.  Added 1 box of frozen chopped spinach and cooked for another 15 min.  Yummy!  Was fairly spicy but i love it that way!

I skipped the skillet and went with the slow cooker. I also changed the salsa from Pace to Gunpowder Salsa which has, in my opinion, a better flavor. I added the juice and zest of one lime and a teaspoon of red pepper for a little heat. If I make it again I'll use noodles instead of beans as a variation. All in all I had to tweak this recipe too much too give it more than 2 stars.

I've made this many times and it can't be fouled up - perfect when you don't have exactly the ingredients the recipe calls for.  No matter how you make this - and many will change things up - the basics of chicken, broth, salsa and beans make a terrific soup.

Very Good!  I put my partially thawed chicken breast in the crock pot at the same time I put everything else in.  When the chicken was done, I shredded it and returned it to the crock pot.  I also added an extra cup of broth and an extra cup of salsa.  I'd make this again!

Just ran across this recipe the other day and decided to make it today. Cooking now, but have been tasting often. :-)  Absolutely delicious.  Definitely a keeper!  I did add double the chicken broth and a little more Salsa to taste but that was only changes.  Will have with crispy corn chips in place of crackers, like I always do with Chili.

This was really good after I made a few changes.  I made it on top of the stove cooking the frozen chicken breasts along with everything else in 2 cans chicken broth a 1 can rotel instead of salsa.  It was too mild for us so I added one chopped jalapeno with seeds, 1 T. chili powder and 1/4 tsp cayenne.  Topped it with shredded cheese.  Yummy!

Very hearty and flavorful. I skipped the browning step and tossed the frozen chicken straight into the crock pot, then cooked on high for 1 hour and low for 4 - turned out great!

Wonderful recipe!  I have to admit I changed it up a lot simply due to lack of time.  I used leftover chicken breast and added chopped fresh mustard greens and 4 cloves garlic.  I was out of salsa so I used a can of chopped tomatoes.  I used one can white beans and one can pinto beans and used canned corn.  I added some black pepper. I cooked it just over an hour and my husband and I loved it!  Thank you so much!

Really good.  Don't cook the chicken before adding to the crock -- just throw it in raw.  After cooking on high for that long, it shreds easily making it like a stew.  I only cooked mine for 5 hours.  You can even put the chicken in frozen, though it will probably need the entire cooking time for that.  UPDATE:  when I didn't have time for crock put, I cooked chicken in oil, when done, added ~4 TBSP flour, cooking for a minute before adding remainder of ingredients.  (actually used black & pinto beans instead of white and forgot the onion.  If I had remembered the onion, I would have cooked it at same time as chicken).

Wonderful, hearty, and healthy.  I added the cilantro for the entire cooking time and did also double the chicken broth.  Each serving was topped off with tortilla chips and shredded cheddar cheese.  My family loved this.

Great on a cold winter night! I made the following adjustments: I boiled 3 chicken breasts, green onions and two cans of chicken broth. It wasn't even to fill up my crowd but it was filling and good. I might try adding some crushed chips to the top next time and maybe black beans in addition to the white beans. Still a great soup. Oh cooked on the stove in no time.

I made this soup for supper yesterday and it was fabulous! The only thing I did differently from the recipe was use dried white beans instead of canned, as I already had some soaking. It had plenty of liquid and was soupy. I used medium salsa, which gave a hint of spice. I served sprinkled with grated sharp cheddar and crushed tortilla chips like crackers. I am now eating it for lunch and it might even be better the next day. Will definitely make it again!

This is a great soup! I added carrots, and a bit more broth and salsa to ensure leftovers. My chicken was a bit dry, so next time I might just add the cooked chicken prior to serving, or maybe half way through the cooking time.

I used black beans instead of white beans, and also added mushrooms.  Cooked in a pot on the stove for about 4 hrs. Everything was tender and tasted great; the soup is a meal in itself w/ the chicken and vegetables.

Great soup!  Tasty, healthy and satisfying with a piece of crusty bread.  The salsa adds just the right amount of spice.

It was a great soup!! My whole family loved it!  Now I did not have white beans so I substituted for kidney beans and I used canned white corn instead of frozen. Also did 1 1\2 cups of salsa.  I also sliced a french loaf with some parsley-lemon butter. Mmmmmmm!

Followed other's suggestions and doubled salsa and chicken broth. Used black beans, not white, added about 1/2 cup of wild rice, and used very thin chicken breasts. Threw everything in the crockpot just before going to bed and cooked for 8 hours on low. Did not cook chicken first. When I woke up and stirred the soup, the chicken breast just fell apart. I didn't need to shred them. Took a bowl to work for lunch and wasn't to thrilled with the results, but for my second bowl I added salt, pepper, and grated parmesan cheese ... WOW .. what a difference these 3 additions made!! It gave the soup the kick it needed. Also, adding wild rice makes soup nice and thick so I always add it when making soup.

You can't go wrong with this. It's just spicy enough but not too spicy. The white beans add an extra dimension.  This is a GREAT alternative to regular chili.

Very tasty. Could use more spice, though. I served mine with tortilla chips, cheese, and sour cream. (I hate when people give 1000 words on all the things they did differently. Just review the recipe!)

I didn't have any Pace salsa so I substituted Tomatillo salsa and it turned out great. Didn't make any other changes. Will absolutely make it again and will continue to use the Tomatillo salsa, my husband thought it was one of the best soup's I've made.  Did use the crockpot, felt it allowed the seasoning to meld together.  Next time I will shred the chicken as others have recommended.

Was delicious and so easy to make. I'd recommend sauteing the onions for a few minutes before putting in the crock pot.  I used a rotisserie chicken and shredded it instead of cooking chicken breasts, otherwise, made exactly as directed.  Wonderful!

Very good! I used chicken tenders - cut to bite size chunks. A couple of dashes of hot sauce during cooking - like others I just prepared on  stove top. Served with dollop of sour cream and cilantro - preparing this for Super Bowl!

I made a quadruple batch of this (to share with new moms.) It was delicious and satisfying, but could use a little oomph in flavor. I'll use medium or spicy salsa next time.
