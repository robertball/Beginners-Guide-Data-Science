These are "Savory" little biscuits nice hint of tomato flavor! These are easy to put together and a great base for add-in's. I cut the recipe in half and used 1/4 tsp. each of salt and baking soda. I added 1/4 tsp. of garlic powder, 1 tsp. of Italian seasoning, and 2 Tbsp. of Parmesan cheese to give it a little pizzaz. Next time I might even add in some chopped sun-dried tomatoes. I did end up adding a little more tomato juice to the dough. I rolled these out on a lightly floured surface and cut it with a mini- biscuit cutter. I baked these on parchment paper and they baked up beautifully in ten minutes. I topped them with melted butter - YUM!

I really enjoyed these. They had a nice tomato flavor. I used spicy vegetable juice cocktail so it had a little bit of a kick to it, Will make them again

Batter was a little thin to roll out- just made them as drop biscuits.  Very good flavor.  Will make again.

These were just okay for me.  They have an unappealing, unbiscuit-like, orangey color and an off flavor, rather than a tomato flavor, which I didn't detect at all.  The texture seemed off to me too - hard to describe, just didn't seem right. Was the balance of baking soda off because of the V-8 perhaps? Further, probably because of the V-8, they were too salty. I much prefer biscuits made with buttermilk or milk, and a higher baking temperature of 425-450 degrees.

This sounds like something my mom used to do when I was a kid. We grew up poor and she had to make due with whatever was on hand. All six of us kids thought (I still do ) she was the best cook in the world. She could feed an army on just a few items in the pantry and fridge. I can't wait to eat these! Thanks for sharing..

I cut the recipe in half and followed the recipe exactly.  Baked them on parchment paper and they turned out to be perfect with the homemade chili we had for dinner tonight.  We all loved the taste of tomato in these. They would be also good with soup.  Thanks for posting, michellej.  These are a keeper !

I have a brother who can take a can of peas and a dozen eggs and make a gourmet meal! These were wonderful! I added a little shredded sharp cheddar cheese bc reading the recipe brought to mind having a grilled cheese with tomato soup so it seemed like a natural thing to do. They were delish! Thanks!
