GOOD RECIPE , SIMILIAR TO TOLLHOUSE EXCEPT FOR THE USE OF SHORTENING. I USED HERSHEY'S SPECIAL DARK EXPRESSO (4.5 OZ.) BAR THAT I BROKE UP INTO CHUNKS . ALSO  ADDED CHOPPED PECANS . THE EXPRESSO CHOCOLATE REALLY GAVE IT A GREAT TASTE WITH  THE KAHLUA . NEXT TIME I WILL ADD AT LEAST ANOTHER HALF A BAR IF NOT A WHOLE ONE AND GO BACK TO BUTTER .

While this is a good cookie I had a difficult time not rating it three stars rather than four simply because there's nothing special or extraordinary about it at all.  I found that very disappointing.  Given the name, you'd expect to taste both coffee and chocolate in the cookie but you don't - and if you don't, what's the point of adding it?  I don't believe this cookie would have tasted any differently had I omitted both the coffee liqueur (Kahlua) and the chocolate syrup. Still, I can find no fault in the cookie itself, which bakes up nicely and holds its shape.  Can't help it tho' - there is nothing to distinguish this from other chocolate chip cookies so it won't be something that will stand out in my memory.

This is one of the best cookies we've tried in a while. We also tried it with pecans and it was just as moist.

These cookies were very rich to me. 2 cups of chocolate chips is way too many. I was looking for a recipe that didn't call for butter since I was out. These cookies were just ok for us.  Make sure you have lots of milk handy with these cookies! Very sweet.

Wow, these are good!  The coffee flavor is so subtle, and more pronounced as an "after taste" than while you're eating the cookie. (I left out the chocolate syrup) HEIDI IN TN may be on to something seriously amazing with that Dark Espresso bar... The hunt begins for one of those.

Delicious recipe! I used butter flavored shortening, 6 Tbs, of coffee liquor and 1 bag of Hershey Special Dark Chocolate Chips. I sprinkled them  with coffee bean salt I made previously.  I also added 2 tsp. vanilla to the batter fearing that the coffee liquor flavor may disappear as some mentioned, which mostly did. The liquor only had a mild, almost after taste, quite pleasant.  The good chocolate, liquor and salt enhanced these cookies deliciously, an adult crowd pleaser!
