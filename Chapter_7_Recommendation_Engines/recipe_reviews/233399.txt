I don't know if I'm losing my ability to handle spicy foods but using the freshest spices I could find in the amounts listed made for excruciatingly hot corn on the cob!  (I used 1 tbsp of ground smoked chipotle and 1 tsp of plain old paprika.) Also, it took a long time to char the corn on my bbq, but I think it really added something to the flavour of the corn.  All in all, I really enjoyed this and will make (a milder version) again.

Great recipe! I don't change any of the ingredients but rather the cooking instructions. I have some picky eaters on my hands that do not like eating corn on the cob. So I cut the corn off and use a grill pan and just add the ingredients to it then. Comes out great and makes a great side to bring to events.

What a great recipe!  Didn't want to fire up the grill just for the corn so I used an indoor electric grill (similar to a Foreman) and it took a little longer, but the corn caramelized perfectly.  The only alteration to the recipe was that I used plain greek yogurt instead of mayo.  Delicious!

This is so delicious.  Must use ANCHO chili powder, much milder than chili powder. This is flavorful but not spicy.  I try to make my corn like this as much as possible.  Yummy yummy.

An snazing blend of of flavors.  For the one who said this recipe is hot, make sure you use ancho and not chipolte pepper.  Ive nade with both (awesome either way) but we like spicy.  I made this with a black bean salad with fish tacos and received raves all around.   Tip: on a rainy day, I coated the corn with a little olive oil spritz and "charred" it in a skillet then proceeded as written and was really good as well.

I followed the recipe exactly, except I used up what I had left of feta and Parmesan  cheese (instead of buying cojita ). I made this for dinner when my father came to visit, he said, "I grew up in the Midwest and have eaten a lot of corn - and this is the best corn I've ever had!"

I don't have a bbq so I used boiled corn. I also didn't have the special cheese. This recipe was still delicious. So happy I stumbled across this. Will definitely make again.

I made this and cannot believe how delicious it turned out. I didn’t measure everything. Just took mayonnaise and added like juice and paprika and a spicy seasoning I like from a local store. I “grilled” on a skillet after boiling. Slathered with melted butter. Then the mayonnaise sauce. Sprinkle with cheese and top with spicy seasoning. DELICIOUS! Not sure I’ll ever eat corn the same old way again!!

Chef John has some fantastic recipes,this is just another to add to my recipe box..
I substituted chipotle sauce from chipotle peppers in can,since I couldn't find ancho chili powder at my local market.
 My girlfriend who doesn't like mayo devoured the corn. Definitely a keeper

I like this corn.  Now that it's finally in season, I've made this a couple times.  I find the key is to not use too much mayo/spice on the corn as the key is the grilled corn flavor.  Too much of the spread works against the whole idea of delicious grilled corn.
I'll be making again, and again.

I omitted the butter and added a sprinkling of cayene pepper for a little more spice. Otherwise it was perfect. New family favorite.

No changes, followed recipe precisely. Having never tasted ancho chili peppers, I think, I tasted it out of the package and it tasted like tobacco. I was worried that the recipe would be a bust and cautioned my family. 
BOY(!) was I wrong. 
All of us really enjoyed Chef John’s Elote “Mexican Corn on the Cob”. 

Chef John for president.... or maybe not, why wish grief on him.

This was awesome. I used chili powder and a bit of red pepper flakes instead of the ancho chili pepper powder. Also substituted feta cheese and Parmesan cheese for the cojita

Turned out great, as expected. A little bit more chilly could be added for nicer heat on it.

I made this for the 4th of July. I will probably always eat corn on the cob this way from now on. Family loved it. Only variation I made was that I added mexican sour cream to the mix in the same amount of the mayo. Added the lime juice directly in the mix. I made the mix ahead of time put it in a ziploc bag and took with us in a cooler. Cut the corner off at the bbq and everyone could squeeze it right on their corn.

This was awesome! Didn't have like so substituted with lemon and it was still great. Made more than enough for 8 pieces of corn.

Have been making this exact recipe for 2 years now, a family fave!  Sometimes have to substitute Parmesan for the cotilla cheese depending on what's available in local stores, that is not a huge problem but we prefer the recipe as written.  Thank you!!

This dish is absolutely amazing.  Perfect.  And the Smoked Paprika MAKES IT! Don't skimp on that.

First time I made this recipe and we loved it. I did not have the ancho so I used chili powder. Everything else stayed the same. BEST corn we've ever had. The fresh lime really makes this . Come snow time when I usually don't use my grill, I will find a way to do this with a frozen bag of corn either oven or stove top. The cotijo is also a wonderful, wonderful addition.

I didn't boil the corn first just grilled longer probably 20 min total. This was the BEST corn I have ever eaten. It's a must try!

We had the best Mexican grilled corn at a restaurant in Sedona and I wanted to try and make it for ourselves. This one seemed the closest, but I did make a few changes/additions. I did not have ancho chili powder so used chipotle instead.  As others have commented, chipotle is MUCH spicer, so will use ancho next time. I didn't have smokey paprika, but the chipotle more than made up for it, so used regular paprika.  I used a 1/4 cup light mayo and a 1/4 cup sour cream and mixed in some cilantro. Then, in trying to match the restaurant version, I added crushed corn nuts (ya, it sounds weird, but it works) - just sprinkle it on with the cojita cheese. It was so delicious and really close to the $14 side dish from the restaurant.

Very tasty & no modifications so 5 stars.  Also gets 5 stars when done as a cold grilled corn-off-the-cob salad.

Great flavor! I only boiled the corn for about two minutes and it was perfectly done when the kernels began to caramelize on the grill.

This is definitely in my favourites.  My husband and I visited my sister who made a version of this.  Since we don't have the awesome seasoning she purchased in New Mexico, I found this recipe to be as close as I could come. Thanks again, Chef John!

I bought the Ancho and the smoked paprika,cojita.  I ate one piece of corn without squeezing lime on it. NO flavor! The corn was charred nicely on the grill too.  Putting lime on the second one is the only thing that had flavor.

I had to take it off the cob, but was still yum! Also, changed the peppers to just - half teaspoon of chipotle pepper. Added garlic salt, and season salt as well... I have a picky eater on my hands.

This dish was pretty  good. I  used parmesan cheese instead of cojita and could not find ancho chile pepper so used a little red pepper instead. It was good and pleased my family, but it wasn't spicy at all which was disappointing. This was probably because I used the wrong type of pepper; in the future, I would probably use cayenne pepper or another spicy pepper. I also feel that boiling the corn didn't do anything. Next time, I would just put it directly on the grill.

We've been eating this for the last 20 years and I can't believe I've never made this at home.  We call it SoVia (south of viaduct) corn.  We'd head out and look for our favorite push cart guy and eat one while walking and take another home.  With that being said, I think it was the ancho-chile that we didn't care for.  It was a bit chalky.  I made a new batch using cayenne and it was great.  Thanks Chef John.

I didn't have the exact cheese but I used a mexican blend and it turned out phenomenally! Do you think this recipe would work as a corn salad? If you grilled the corn, took it off the cobb, then combined it with the ingredients and served it the next day?

Great recipe although I didn't have the Ancho Chile Powder so used Chipotle Chile Powder instead. We had this corn with the Baja Fish Tacos and my husband loved it all!  Actually, I liked this corn so much I would eat just it for a meal!
