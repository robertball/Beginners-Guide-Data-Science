this is a totally awsome and delicious recipe.  I made it with my daughter who loved helping and it was eaten in literally 15 minutes.  All my visitors want it.  Recommend for all to make!

Very good, and I didn't have to buy any fancy ingredients. It was really creamy and sweet. Probably next time I'll use less sugar.

My "large pot" wasn't big enough. But, I followed the directions, froze it, went back to it and I couldn't scoop it out of the dish. If I let it thaw a bit, it will be fine.

I did not like this recipe.  The milk consistency the flavor of the flour and corn starch everything was wrong.  Making this simple would've made this better.  When you have a good mango you don't disguise the flavor.  I should know I grow mangos and avocados but when I saw this recipe I became curious. It was such a waste of time and ingredients........

Not bad but not a favorite.  I followed the recipe exactly and the ingredients.  Still came out a little ice block to me. Maybe it would be cool to use this a flavored ice cube in a fuity drink. You have to use heavy cream or whole milk or it will be a block of ice.
