This soup is great! I also question the reviewer that said the recipe states 2 tablespoons of pepper.  The recipe I used only listed one tablespoon of pepper. I actually added and extra 1/4 teaspoon of pepper.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon of cumin, added no salt, and used turkey bacon.  Perfect.  I pureed about 3/4 of the soup.      When I was in the grocery store purchasing the leeks a woman told me to soak the leeks because they contain "sand".  I thought she was nuts but I did soak the leeks for about 10 minutes and sure enough, there was sand at the bottom of the bowl! Not sure if this is true for all leeks but you may want to chop the leeks and then soak before using.      Thanks for the recipe.

I made a few adjustments so that I could cook this soup mostly in my crockpot. I doubled the recipe and threw the potatoes in the crockpot with the organic chicken broth, and additonal sauteed onion/few cloves of minced garlic and a few spices. I cooked that on high for an hour, then low for the rest of the day. Before adding everything else, I lightly mashed the potatoes with the broth with a potato masher, then added the bacon, the sauteed leeks, onion, celery and also some minced garlic, carrot and diced bell peppers. I steamed the broccoli on the side in additional organic broth so that the broccoli would not get mushy and I folded that in with just a bit of the milk called for, to cut down on the fat (I also used fat free evaporated milk). I thought at the last minute that using the last cup or so of leftover Christmas ham would be a good addition as well. I don't care for herbes de provence so I just threw in what I thought would be good. I also didn't need that much pepper or salt. I just added until it tasted right. A good potato soup recipe is easily adaptable to whatever you want to add in, really. A doubled recipe made more than enough for at least a week's worth of lunches/dinners for me and will provide quite a few portioned out for the freezer. It was quite easy to adapt this for the crockpot, which I appreciated. This was an excellent way for me to use the surplus of potatoes, broccoli and ham that I had leftover in my fridge.

My husband and I loved this soup! Left out the bacon and didn't miss it. I also added fresh mushrooms. Very tasty.

This soup was tasty but a bit too heavy on the pepper (2 tbl).  Someone told me that's how it should be so just be prepared! I served it to a crowd and it wasn't that appealing visually.  If I'd do it again, I'd blend the leeks and 1/2 the potatoes, but leave 1/2 the pots. and broccoli in chunks.  The takers gobbled it down!

Excellent soup!  I didn't have herbes de Provence or coriander and halved the pepper it still tastes wonderful.  I also substituted evaporated milk instead of whole milk to give it a creamier flavor,  Lastly, I minced and sauteed in 2 cloves garlic and left half the potatoes cubed.  This is definitely one I'll make again.

We loved this soup! I question the reviewer who said too much pepper.  My screen only said 1 tbl of pepper, not two. I did add more salt to taste, at the end.  I did not puree all the soup, to leave some of it chunky.  It reminds me of the soup we ate in Las Vegas at the Paris Hotel.  Served it as the first course at a dinner party and was asked for the recipe.  Thank you for sharing!

I love this soup!  It's rich, creamy and savory!  I've made it twice since I added it to my recipe box, and it keeps getting better.  It is perfect the way that it is, but I add another cup of stock and twice as many potatoes to stretch it.  I have also used buttermilk, because it is what I had on hand.  You can't mess it up--it is so simple and easy to make.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!!

Yum. Instead of milk, I used an extra cup of chicken broth - and one extra of many of the  veggies (leek, celery, potato). It was still quite good.  I added pinch of cayenne, as per another reviewer's tip. Thanks!  I  used a stand-up mixer, which made it very easy.

So ridiculously delicious!  The bacon adds a nice touch.  I used beef broth and russet potatoes and it worked great.  Someone else suggested using buttermilk, which I happened to have a bit, so I mixed it with regular milk and the results were really fantastic.

Delicious.  I happen to have a large potato soup mix on the shelf.  After preparing the mix, I added softened veggies, bacon and 4-5 large garlic cloves, simmered and pureed as instructed.

Very tasty and easy to make soup. For those (like me) that were wondering what herbes de Provence was I found this on the web: 

Ingredients:

    3 Tablespoons dried marjoram
    3 Tablespoons dried thyme
    3 Tablespoons dried savory
    1 teaspoon dried basil
    1 teaspoon dried rosemary
    1/2 teaspoon dried sage
    1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds

This is a good, solid weeknight recipe (not so much an entertaining recipe - could be because it wasn't as rich due to me having to omit bacon).  I thought the flavors worked together nicely, the soup had good body, and it's very healthy.  I didn't have leeks, so I added in 6 cut-up fennel stalks.  In addition, I subbed in rice milk for whole milk, which worked quite well!  Overall, pleased with the recipe, although I wish the final color was a little more vibrant (mine turned out grayish despite not overcooking the broccoli).

I really was excited about this recipe because I love just about everything in it.  The leeks did not puree well, so I ended up with a pulpy mess that had a decent flavor.  The result was not worth the expense and the effort.

Delicious soup, but I would caution you to start with a smaller amount of pepper. You can always add more, but it would be a waste to add a tablespoon and no one will eat the soup! I used 1/2 a tsp of pepper and my kids who don't like a lot of pepper are eating it, though my daughter says it is a little peppery for her. Great on a cold rainy day like today! I also left out the bacon, coriander and fennel seed because I didn't have those items on hand, but it is yummy anyway.

Great recipe! I made several changes just based on what I had in the house. I didn't use celery, broccoli, fennel seed, or most of the ingredients of herbes de Provence. I used 1% instead of whole milk and 1 cup chicken stock and 2 cups veggie stock. I also threw in some garlic (toward the end, whoops). Finally, I did not blend this because I tried it before and it was already delicious! I definitely recommend this recipe, it was easy and tastes great. Perfect for this cold weather!

Great recipe. Changed the pepper to 1/2 tsp. I had to simmer the veggies twice aas long to get a nice soft texture. 
Nice & thick with no flour!

My whole family was disappointed.  Especially me as I put in a lot of effort for a barely passable meal.  Bland, boring -- there are much better leek/potato soup recipes out there.  Don't bother with this one.

Outstanding!  I doubled bacon and substituted cauliflower for broccoli. My screen did say 1 TB pepper but I put less (season own bowl if wish) but I added a touch more salt. I did not have fennel so I used 1/4 tsp caraway I crushed with mortar n pestal. I used an immersion blender in pot & left reasonably chunky. Used skim milk instead of whole. Delicious!! Even my 11 year old daughter loved this soup - she usually hates everything this side of burger & fries!! I will make it often. A real winner in my book!  Thank you Seeshell!!

I'm so mad! I just made this soup exactly as stated above and the amount of pepper ruined it! YUK. I knew it would be to much but I ignored my gut. Too bad. Otherwise this soup would rock.

I LOVE this soup. The only thing that I mention is that I had already dragged out the blender and made a mess when I read that you could use a stick blender! SO MUCH EASIER! When she says to hold that blender lid down tight? She's Not Kidding! I do use more leeks than she had here however.

I made some changes to use some stuff that was already in the house, and it went as follows: 4 slices nitrate-free turkey bacon 4 cups low sodium chicken broth (3 wasn't enough) 3 russet potatoes 1/2 tablespoon ground black pepper 1 tablespoon cracked red pepper  I also added the teensiest splash of apple cider vinegar to brighten the flavor without using as much salt. That said, I found it needed almost an entire teaspoon of sea salt, but I think that's mostly because of the turkey bacon and the low sodium chicken broth. Still VERY good. Next time I'll try it with nitrate-free pork bacon.

Great recipe!  For sure a keeper.  I added in carrots for color.  Will keep this as a "go to" for leek soup!

I changed the recipe because I'm counting calories. I used Skim milk and cut the bacon. I didn't want to buy a big bag of potatoes so I ended up using two medium size Idaho potatoes. I used fresh broccoli. I bought bacon bits and low fat cheddar cheese to sprinkle on top. I also only pureed half the final soup and I'm really really glad I did. It was nice to have chunks of potato and broccoli. I'll be making this again.

Excellent flavor.  I did cut down on the pepper a bit, because my granddaughter does not like her food spicy.

we love this soup - especially my 15 month old son!   no herbs de provence or fennel, but added several other veggies (garlic, butternut squash, carrots, cauliflower, peas, radishes, zucchini, spinach, etc) also used more like 8 pc bacon and added 1 small tub cream cheese in with the milk. mostly pureed in the blender but still had small chunks. i put several single serving bags of soup in the freezer and it has worked out great. this soup served with toasted sourdough is awesome

This wasn't bad. I think you have to like broccoli, leeks and potatoes to really love this soup. My family doesn't and it fell flat as a result. The broccoli was a dominate flavor and I might have cut back on the quantity if I'd known. Also, I let the soup get too hot after adding the milk and it separated a bit. Other than that it was a nice "stick to your bones" kind of soup.

Used all ingredients listed in recipe, I pureed about half of the soup and left the other half chunky. I found the flavor to be a little lacking, had to add a little extra salt.

This recipe is jolly good!! I was happy about it. Leeks are full of dirt and possibly manure, so cut long ways and wash well. If leeks get on your nerves, like they do me, Knorr has a leek seasoning that is delicious. I can only find it at the World Market, so far... warning: 29% of the seasoning is sodium.
Very nice recipe for cold winter days.

I liked the recipe as it was, but I loved it how I made it... I didn't know what Herbs de Provence were, so I eliminated them and subbed in thyme, marjoram and lemon balm. I also used coconut milk instead of regular milk (2 cans of water to 1 can of milk) - it didn't taste like coconut at all. Don't get me wrong. I used the bacon. I just didn't have milk at the time that I made the recipe (silly me!). Anyhow, my husband also hates potatoes, so I used the stems from the broccoli for fiber and a lb of mushrooms instead of the potatoes. There is no real evidence of a difference. I also left a few chunks out instead of blending the whole batch, so it's still like eating something. :) The recipe was a great jumping off point, and I am so glad that it inspired me to use my seasonal veggies that I got in my CSA! Kudos! :)

Great soup!  Easy to make and tastes delicious.  I ended up using almond milk as I have a family member with milk allergies.  I am making it again for women's book club this month.  Its a keeper

Substitute ham instead of bacon. Did not add milk. Used what had for stock which was vegetable stock. Added a large chicken bouillon cube. Also did not blend it. I like the large pieces. Yum!

i can't get past the consistency of this. We didn't want to purée it but gave it a try. Seriously not good. Luckily we made cornbread to go along with this and that became our dinner. Very disappointed.

This soup was wonderful.  The leeks and seasonings especially made for a delightful soup, do not leave them out, except I used less salt and pepper than called for.

FULL OF FLAVOR!  The 1 tbsp of pepper was just enough spicey- loved it!  Instead of bacon I put in a tbsp of bacon grease that I always keep on hand and also added one large sweet potato too.  I only had turkey broth so used that.  Also just had about 1 1/2 cups of 1/2 n 1/2 instead of milk.  Turned out FANTASTIC!  Everyone loved it.  Thanks!

This was perfect for the rainy cold evening we had here tonight. I made a couple of modifications--1 tsp pepper, a handful of sliced mushroos that needed to be used up.  Didn't have the herbs d province, so used a mediterran blend that contained paprika,pepper, cumin, oregano,coriander,garlic and onion instead, then shook in a few good shakes of thyme and another 1/4 tsp of coriander. Only had fat free milk, so that's what I used.  Didn't puree it, seems plently thick as it is.

It was a fine soup.  Very chowdery.  I looked up the ingredients for the Herbes de Provence and had most of them (not the fennel seed) so I improvised.  It was neither wonderful nor terrible.  I might make this again if I had the ingredients kicking around, but I wouldn't plan a grocery trip around it.

I spent the day making this recipe, making sure I did it just as it said except when it said 1 Tablespoon black pepper.  I love pepper but I though that was just too much.  I put 2 teaspoons instead and believe me that is just too much.  I can't share this giant pot of soup as no one would eat it because of the pepper.  Everyone already thinks I use too much pepper, but this is outrageous and ruined a nice pot of soup. It would have had 5 starrs but the pepper was too much

I loved this soup, but can't give it 5 stars as I didn't make it, and wouldn't have like it, as directed. I left out the bacon and used vegetable broth in place of chicken stock (to make it vegetarian), put in 1/4 tsp of pepper instead of 1 tbsp (because 1 tbsp sounded like an insane amount of pepper), used heavy whipping cream instead of milk (because yum!), cut out the 2 tbsps of butter and used only 1 tbsp olive oil (because of the fat in the whipping cream), used 1 1/2 tsps of salt and didn't purée it (why on earth wouldn't you want to eat all those great chunks of vegetables?). But then, OMG was it great!

This was fantastic!  the only things i did different to cut calories was omit the bacon, use skim milk, 3 tbsp of cornstarch dissolved in 2 tbsp water and put in some chopped turnips i had lying around.  i also only blended about 1/2 of the contents to leave some chunkiness to the texture.
