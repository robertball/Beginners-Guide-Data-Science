A long review… This is better than all other recipes for this kind of casserole– and I’ve made many for holiday mornings over the years.  My only changes: 1) I didn’t bother cutting off the crust (a waste of time);  2)  I used a full pound of name-brand sausage (my family likes it meaty).  I always rinse with hot water the cooked, drained sausage (using a colander).  This totally gets rid of the excess grease which can ruin these recipes and it doesn’t affect the flavor of the sausage at all; and  3) I sprinkled the pepper on top rather than mix it in to give a better appearance.  This recipe was a perfect balance of cubed bread, eggs, (extra) sausage, and cheese.  Most others have way too much bread and the texture is gooey—I always had left-overs that went uneaten *until I tried this recipe*!  I used an 8x8 class dish and it was done in the exact time specified.  (I had to get out the manual for my new oven and adjust it 25° higher!  Nothing was getting done.)  Thanks for submitting the recipe!

AWESOME BASE CASSEROLE!!! Very quick and tasty. SUGGESTIONS; I toasted the bread (3 slices) before I cut it up which virtually eliminated the sogginess issue, I also left the crust on which added a heartier taste to the dish. I added some garlic powder, but the 1/2tsp wasn't enough to notice. NEXT TIME; I will sautee an onion and add it along with some more garlic (minced, powdered or salt). Also, I served mine with a few cherry tomatoes and the tastes complimented each other very well, so next time I will thinly slice a large tomato and put a single slice ontop of each piece (the 8X8 dish makes four shallow servings). Also, this would be very good with sour cream and salsa as well. Hashbrowns would be a good addition, but certainly aren't necessary given the flavor this recipe generates on its own. Thanks for this recipe!!!

I gave this five stars even though I adjusted the recipe based on what previous reviewer suggested.  I've tried other breakfast casseroles, and this one is the best, even reheated the next day!  I noticed that the recipe was for only 2 servings, and I needed six, so I changed that.  Our pork, locally "grown", is strong so I only used 1 pound.  To emphasize the eggs more, and to make sure it wouldn't be soggy, I reduced the milk to 2 cups.  To add a little flavor I added a few shakes of onion powder and garlic powder.  Then, like the others, I needed to bake it in a 9 x 13 dish for 45-50 minutes.  I don't like gooey eggs; I prefer my omelets firm.  That's what this recipe reminded us of - a huge omelet.  It was nice that we could all eat one at the same time.  My husband spiced his up with some Texas Pete.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This really was quick and easy and quite tasty - but it's high in fat grams, so if you're watching your weight or counting those Weight Watcher points, you might want to eat this only on special occassions.  I did make some substitutions, trying to use up some ingredients in the cupboard.  I used a can of SPAM instead of sausage, so that saved some time - all I did was dice it and sprinkle it on top of the bread.  As for the bread, I had 3 stale hot dog buns that needed to be used up, so I used them and 3 slices of regular bread - did not cut the crust off.  The only other changes I made was using fat-free milk, sprinkled some dry minced onion on top before adding the egg/milk mixture, and also added paprika to the seasonings.  Since I increased the servings to 6, I used a 9x13 pan and baked for 40 minutes.  It really was very good; my husband really liked it.  I will be making this one again.  Using the subs I made to the recipe, for 6 servings, total calories per serving is 455 and total fat grams is 26.  That equates to 11 Weight Watcher points per serving.

My whole family, including a 4 year old and 2 year old liked this quick recipe. Thank you! Next time I will add some sauteed onions and maybe some more herbs to the egg mixture.

Let me start by saying, I'm not the breakfast chef in our house but I made this one morning and it's a great recipe.  I changed one main ingrediant and oh my, what a difference.  Instead of bread I used english muffins as the base.  My husband was questioning that move but he very quickly changed his mind.  Amazing and a highly requested for breakfast now.

Again, I tried another breakfast casserole for a crowd and again I was disappointed.  It just doesn't have a lot of flavor.  I did leave the crust on the bread, and I did lightly bake the bread in the oven to crisp it up before I put on the other ingredients.  It did not get soggy during the baking at all.  I doubled the ingredients and cooked in a 9x13 pan, it took almost an hour to bake, nowhere near the 30 minutes of the original recipes. 

I would only make this recipe again with major modifications.

This was a nice change from our usual breakfast fare.  I used two kinds of left-over bread that were fresh so I decreased the milk to ¾ cup so the end result wouldn’t be mushy.  To make sure each bite had the sausage flavor, I broke apart the sausage as I browned it, but still chopped it well before adding it to the casserole.  This recipe makes a delicious breakfast.

Very, very good.  Even my picky kids ate this.  The only change I made was omitting the mustard, but still was great!  Will make again.

This was exactly what I was looking for. I doubled the recipe except the meat since I'm not a big meat eater, and it was wonderful. The best thing about this recipe is that it is a great starter recipe - there are so many things you could change and it would still be great. I think I'll be trying it with bacon and jalapenos next.

Note that the recipe is for 2 servings. Small changes - I left the crust, for 6 servings - added 1/3 c sour cream, only 2 c milk, added some garlic powder,we dont eat pork so used 1 package of turkey bacon.  Served with fresh fruit on the side.  LOVED this, left overs will be great tomorrow.

My 2 year-old son and husband loved this.  It was SO QUICK and EASY to prepare, unlike our standard weekend breakfasts of bacon, eggs, and potatoes.  I used leftover bread from last night's dinner, which was a cheddar garlic loaf, adding a great flavor to the casserole. I will definitely be making this again, adding some veggies to make a healthier version ;)  I also used pre-cooked, frozen turkey sausage links  which cut the prep time down dramatically.  I especially loved that this recipe, unlike most similar recipes, did not use cream of mushroom soup as the base-yuck!  Thanks for a nice, simple, tasty, easy Sunday morning breakfast!  I will surely be making this again :) But please, do yourself a favor and do NOT try to speed up cooking by upping the temperature... it only results in burnt eggs, which are not tasty as all :p

This was so quick and easy. I didn't bother cutting the crust off the bread. You could easily  veggies to this basic recipe. I added half a bag of baby spinach and chopped up a tomato I had laying around. A great quick Saturday morning breakfast.

Most casseroles take longer but this one really only took 30 minutes to cooke.  The ground mustard was a nice touch.  I added bacon and onion.  The last 10 minutes I added chopped tomatoes on top and feta cheese.  The last 5 minutes I added a little more cheese on top for presentation.  I served it over breakfast potatoes.  My husband said it was so flavorful.

Good flavor but egg, cheese and bread mixture are very soggy.  Maybe will try toasting the bread before making something like this again!

We enjoy this but I have made some revisions. We use five eggs instead of three. Turkey sausge instead of pork and we don't use the bread. Instead we use flour shells to wrap them in and add a bit of texas pete!

This was very easy and tasty but it sure was flat (as in height)!  Maybe it's because I used bacon instead of sausage (didn't have any sausage).  I also sprinkled some cheese on top.  It needs some herbs or spices but I haven't come up with any ideas yet that I think would go well with this casserole.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was satisfying on a chilly Saturday morning in Minnesota.  I changed it in the following ways, due to what I had on hand.  I used lowfat turkey sausage links, which I first browned and then sliced.  I used sharp Cheddar, which I thought really added some flavor dimension to the dish.  I used red pepper flakes instead of the mustard, and I used buttermilk in place of regular milk.  The only thing I used that I wouldn't use again was the particular kind of bread I used.  It had a slightly sweet note to it, which I didn't think worked with the other flavors.  Next time, I will use the most rustic and crusty bread I can find, toasting it first, or I may leave out the bread all together, as others did.  I used 3 slices and I upped the eggs to 5.  I felt these additions gave the  dish more heft, as I didn't want the servings to be "thin," as described in another review.  This is a good, basic recipe, just fine for a family meal.

I've made this recipe a couple of times. I made 2 adjustments: first i increased it by 4x to feed everyone here and I used cooked and crumbled bacon instead of sausage for this recipe. Overall it had a good taste but the bread bottom was very soggy and i could not get passed it enough to fully enjoy this recipe. The second time i made it i omitted the bread altogether.. the family enjoyed it much more this way.

It is a good base recipe, but next time I will add more eggs.  Mine was not as fluffy as I wanted it, but the flavor was very good.  I used bacon instead of sausage, dill instead of mustard and I added some left over cubed potatoes that I had.

I followed the directions and this turned out just a dish full of unappealing soggy mush.

It was good, and everyone liked it, but I would like to know how to keep it from forming water that sits in the bottom of the pan.  (I added green peppers and onions...maybe that was it?)

this recipe was awesome! i toasted 4 pieces of bread and mixed 4 eggs and didn't measure the cheese, i just put enough to cover the meat and bread mixture. i didnt know if i would have enough liquid, but it turned out great!

3 stars.  i give it a 3 because my picky eater at most of it.  it didnt taste all the great to me but it could be the substitutes i used.  i didnt have dry mustard so i used regular and left over chicken. it is a good way to use the left over meat.

This is a solid recipe. I wanted my casserole to be a bit thicker so I used 5 eggs and 1 cup of milk. I used a mexican blend shredded cheese (it was all I had on hand), and added closer to 1 teaspoon of dried mustard and didn't add the salt and pepper until it came out of the oven. 
I will make this recipe again. It is one of those recipes that you could tweak each time, depending on what you happen to have on hand.

Excellent flavor. Used bread and croutons. Doubled the recipe so it took a little longer to bake. A keeper!

I like this casserole but the only problem that I had was with the eggs. It was too soggy and I don't like my eggs like that. I even put it back in the oven for another 10 minutes but that didn't help. But overall it was delicious!!

This is a very tasty and simple recipe!  I loved that it didnt have to be soaked overnight...as i often think of making something at the last minute.  i added a little extra cheese, and thought it looked like there wasnt enough eggs (though im sure its fine with just 3), so i scrambled one more with a little milk and added it to the mix.  This probably effected the cooking time, which took about 15-20 minutes longer to cook, but it turned out delicious! (of course, im at 7200 feet, so it could be that too) The ground mustard is a yummy touch.  I do think if i made this again, i would add some grilled onions to it, but it didnt need it :)  Thank you for the delicous recipe!  A perfect size for a family of 3!

I made this recipe this morning for my husband who doesn't eat pork. So instead of the pork I use beef link sausage and cut it into small pieces and it turned out great! He really enjoyed it, and I will definately make it again.

Changed to 4 servings. Used up leftover veggies/breakfast foods from the week.. 4 pieces of whole wheat bread (toasted and cubed), 1/2 package turkey bacon (browned and cut into pieces), 1/2 onion chopped and minced garlic (sauteed and set aside). 2 handfuls of spinach w/ 2 cups mushrooms sauteed. greased a round 9x1.5 inch pan, layered the bread, bacon, onion and garlic mix, spinach and mushroom, finished with two handfuls of sharp cheddar cheese and poured the egg/milk/mustard mix over the top. Sprinkled with salt and pepper... 350 degrees for 30 min... Half way through cooking I thought of sun dried tomatoes. Glad I did!! Added to the top and they gave it the zing it needed. Perfect!

Good, solid base recipe for a breakfast casserole.  I think the salt/pepper/mustard measurements are just right.  I did find the break a little mushy but that was okay for me as the sausage balanced it out.  This is a good place to start for any breakfast casserole.  I added crumbled bacon on top of mine (after cooking the casserole) along with chopped green onion.

Big hit with the family.  I modify by using 4 eggs and only 3/4 cup milk and 3/4 cup cheese. Ground mustard is optional for me too. It'll serve around 4 people and not be too puffy from a lot of milk.

Great and easy casserole!  Have served at church brunches and it is always gone fast.  Keeps well in a warmer if you have to take it somewhere and it may be a bit before you get to eat it.  :)

This is the easiest breakfast egg bake I've found.  No overnight soaking req'd, and it only uses 2 slices of bread & 3 eggs.  EASY!  My only tip would be us use day-old or a hearty french bread.  I've used softer bread and the texture just wasn't as good - almost mushy.  Go w/a strong bread and really you could spice this up more if you like, adding green onions, mushrooms & the like.  As is it makes a perfect pie plate full.

This was great!   I did make a couple of changes-I used shredded hash browns instead of the bread (just cooked and drained them before adding to the pan).   I also used turkey sausage and added a bit of onion.   Wonderful base recipe, I can't wait to make again!

I just baked this and I am going to freeze for Christmas morning.  I used oatmeal bread, crust on, 10 eggs and 3 1/2 cups of milk 1 1/2 cups of cheese. I put it in a large oblong casserole and  one side I put crumbled breakfast sauage, diced peppers onions spinach & chopped baby bella muchrooms, the other side I omitted the crumbled sauage as my daughter is not a meat eater.   It puffed up beautifully and I am sure it will reheat just fine and be enjoyed by 8 of us Christmnas morning. This was a breeze to make!

My mother uses this recipe when making her breakfast casserole. Everyone loves it, even my picky little sister. We always have to double the recipe because everyone wants seconds. (Note to others: The casserole tastes just as good without mustard. Some of my friends don't like it so I left it out one day. It tastes about the same and is still good.) Thanks!

This was very good, and very easy to put together.  After putting 2 slices (cubed) of bread in the dish I decided it would need 3. I also added 2 additional eggs. We enjoyed this a lot!

YUMMY! I used turkey sausages and sauteed with onions. Added a little extra cheese, and some garlic powder to my mix of eggs.
Really nice texture and appearance. Will definitely make again!

This was very good.  I sautéed some mushrooms and red bell peppers and added that to the casserole.  I also only used one cup of milk and added one can of cream of mushroom soup.  I toasted the crust to try and keep it from being too soggy.  I had to cook mine for about an hour because of the changes.  It was a big hit because it is gone!

I used Mexican Chorizo in place of the breakfast sausage.  I followed the rest of the recipe to the letter.  The recipe made just the right amount and was the perfect balance of flavors. This is a keeper.

I'm giving this recipe 4 stars as a great basic recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly (except that I had some leftover sliced canned potatoes, so I browned them and put them on top before pouring on the egg mixture), and my only "complaint" is that I should have added some fresh herbs ... maybe some fresh rosemary or dill ... parsley or basil would be good ... anyway, it was beautiful after exactly 40 minutes of baking ... puffed and golden, and the eggs were done but not overdone ... also, I love the fact that it is a smaller recipe ... can be made in the 8X8 and not a 9X13 ... there is only two of us!  Oh, one more thing:  Leftovers make a great sandwich!  Toasted bread, a little mayo, slice of tomato and onion ... great Sunday afternoon lunch!  :)

Excellent. I keep kosher so I used vegetarian hot dogs instead of the sausage. I made two changes which added a lot - sauted an onion along with the hot dogs, and added a good shake of garlic powder to the egg mixture. This was a big hit with the whole family.

So simple and so delicious!  Halfway through mixing it up I realized I only had 2 eggs in the kitchen instead of 3, I was able to make some changes as I went along and it still came out amazingly tasty, this recipe was so easy to work with and to adjust, I can see substituting lots of different ingredients to use up leftovers.  I did use the cream as someone suggested since I had some cream on hand, this worked very well.  This one is definitely a keeper--thanks!!!

This is a great recipe! I'm so glad to find one that doesn't require making the night before. I sauteed some onions, as another user recommended, and put them on top of the cheese (I used four slices of jack cheese because I didn't have any shredded cheddar—that worked great too). The onions were nice and crisp on top of the casserole. I also added some rosemary and thyme to the egg mixture instead of mustard. Next time I'll probably use a bit less milk—probably 3/4 cup.

I needed to double this dish but still used the 8 inch pan. You definetly need to use a larger shallow pan if you increase proportions, otherwise the middle is runny.  We used 100% whole wheat bread which might have changed the texture too.  My husband and I both thought it tasted great and the outside edges were perfect.

Sorry, this did nothing for me.  I had the recipe changed to serve 8 then halved that but it came out runny in the middle after 30 mins.  I had to put it back in the oven for another 15 mins, then in the micro for 2 mins.  Easter breakfast was a bust

This was a hit for brunch, I substituted pork sausage with turkey sausage and used skim milk with a tablespoon of sour cream for consistency.  I will definitely make this again.

This was a great alternative to the usual breakfast. I did not have any bread ( I know, right?) or sausage on hand, so I used a thinly sliced russet potato and turkey bacon to substitute. I added cracked black pepper, Lawry's season salt, and Italian seasoning to the egg mixture ( I didn't have ground mustard). Once it was all together, I added fresh basil to the top. I still cooked it as directed and it came out wonderful! Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

I made this exactly as written and it was so good.   I wasn't sure about slices of bread in it, but it gave it a good texture that it needed as a casserole.  I will be making this over and over again.

I loved this recipe!  My picky kids even gobbled this up.  I made a double batch because I knew what was posted was not enough.  I also added 1/2 tsp of both onion powder and garlic powder to give it just a little more spice. I have one daughter that doesn't like cheese, so its easily enough to layer without the cheese in a corner.  This again was a great recipe and is now in my breakfast meals rotation!

Excellent!  We used Soy Sausage instead of pork (health reasons)...  other than that (and not adding salt) we made it to the recipe and it was simply AMAZING!

I make this with left over homemade buns I use 4 buns cut in half, 8-12 eggs and 1 pound of browned sausage then add seasoning then cheese. I put mine together the night before so all I have to do is put it in the oven to cook the eggs about 20 min then I have a quick hot breakfast for the kid's b-4 school.

Tried this for breakfast today.  I followed the recipe exactly.  My husband really liked it.  I wasn't fond of the sausage (but I don't like sausage very well) and will try bacon next time.  Also, will follow the suggestion to toast the bread next time because it was a little soggy.  All in all, since I usually don't eat breakfast I'll definitely fix again for husband.  Liked the fact that it was really, really easy, ingredients usually have on hand and I really liked the idea that it didn't make a great big casserole.  Thanks for the recipe.  Mary Jane

This is ok.  I did make a few changes.  I used english muffins (1 & 1/2) I did toast them first (as per others suggestions) and I didn't add any meat.  I had to cook at 375 degrees and it was still a very soft casserole.  I think it is a pretty healthy easy breakfast (I ate with fresh fruit salad) but it is not something I would cook for a special occasion or company.

This was a good base, as others have said.  I had to increase the number of eggs, the amount of milk, and the slices of bread.  I think I ended up using 6 eggs, 2 cups of milk, and 3 slices of bread.  I also added a little hot sauce and sauteed peppers and onions.  Yum!  A good base to jazz up your own way.

Really tasty. I've made this twice now. The first time, I swapped bacon and the second time ham for the sausage. I also tried Jack cheese and cheddar cheese. I added a little onion and black olives. I want to try this with hash browns, too. My husband, who won't eat "breakfast foods" for dinner actually said I could make this for dinner sometime.

I tried this recipe with hasbrown potatoes and it was really good, but it was missing something, some kind of spice, maybr fresh parsley(?). And it was a little soggy. Other than that, it has definite potential.

Very tasty! I took the advice of other reviews, and used cream, 1 lb. sausage, let it cook between 35-40 min.  Not bad at all, just some soggy bread.  That's okay though, still tasty for me!

It took 2 1/2 slices of bread to cover the 8x8 dish.  I added an extra egg to bring the total to 4 eggs.  I used a pound of sausage, and followed another reviewer's advice and rinsed the sausage after browning it.  I used 1 cup of cream instead of milk.  I let it set about 15 minutes before serving.  My wife loved it.  The bread wasn't soggy.  4 stars since I modified the recipes.  Will make it again.

The top was good. But when we spooned it out, the bread was a slimy wad. Think about it...eggs and milk sifting down to bread and cooking. Yuck. If i try this again, hash browns will be substituted for bread.

I have made this recipe twice for my 5 year old.  The only changes I have made are to use a shredded Mexican blend cheese (he's not to hip on cheddar) and I have been upping the ingredients a little and using an 11 x 8 " pan.  He LOVES it.  I bake it, cool it, put it in the fridge to solidify, cut it up then freeze it in individual servings.  Perfect to have before school.  Nuke 2 min. on high in the microwave and abra cadabra, yummy breakfast!

Original recipe is for 2 serving so I doubled the recipe for a family of 4.  This made way too much.  Without doubling it would have been the perfect size for 4 people.  Gave three stars only because husband and older daughter liked the recipe while I and younger daughter did not.  Bread was soggy even though I toasted it as was suggested.  Lacked any real taste other than the sausage.  Will try freezing the left overs for hubby.

I made this tonight and loved it. I doubled the recipe, baked for 45 minutes, used 4 biscuits instead of bread, only used 1 cup of milk instead of 2, didn't use the mustard, added half an onion and 1 clove of garlic, and added a dollop of sour cream to everyone's piece. Next time I make this I'm going to try to add in a layer of hash browns and see if that makes it taste even better!

This was great, flexible recipe, and took no time at all to make. A couple of tips. Don't use a cheap fatty sausage, use one with good flavor. Also don't be afraid to add your favorite omelet fillings, some mushrooms, sautéed onions and peppers etc. If you double the recipe back off the milk by a third of cup as the eggs get really "soft".

After I put everything in the pan, I was a little skeptical we would like it or it would turn out.  Once it came out of the oven and we tasted it, it was fantastic.  I didn't do much differently...I accidentally put in a whole pound of maple pork sausage instead of a half pound from misreading it.  There wasn't much fat to drain, so I just kept patting it with paper towels to soak up the grease.  Instead of ground mustard, I used garlic powder, which is what I usually put in our scrambled eggs anyway.  I thinly sliced a few grape tomatoes and laid them on top before baking.  It added some color and zip, and was easy to pick off if you didn't want the tomatoes.  I did have to leave it in the oven for ten minutes longer.  We prefer our eggs a touch "wet", so the consistency was perfect for us.  My usually not picky toddler wouldn't try it, but there was plenty for mom and dad!  Very easy to make, and it was nice to pop something in the oven instead of standing at a stove keeping watch over a large skillet of eggs or pancakes....it was also a lot less dishes and pans to wash!  I'll probably try this again with some experimentation, I think you could add anything to this and it would still turn out great.  Thanks for the recipe, I'm keeping this one!

5 stars!  I made this for our family New Year's Eve  brunch and it was a great hit.  I put salsa on the table for those who wanted to spice it up a bit, but it was wonderful... even the children enjoyed it.

I doubled this recipe to make it for my family.  They loved it!  The next time I made it, I used bacon.  I let it sit overnight in the refrig.  Increased the cooking time by 10 min.  Turned out fluffy and great.

This was really good! Came out perfect, I did toast the bread and to be extra naughty, I added some pieces of cooked bacon on top. Even gave my co-worker a taste at work the next day and she LOVED it! I'll use this next time we have alot of family in town, instead of my standard go-to quiche recipe.

I gave this recipe 5 star because of the basics of the idea and incorporating the reviews, which are more than helpful.  I made this for the first time, for a quiet Sunday brunch for 2.  I followed the reviews suggestion and toasted my bread before (I will use 3 slices of bread next time, to avoid sogginess).  I substituted Andouile Sausage for the pork sausage.  I sauted 1/4 cup onion, 1/4 cup red bell pepper and 2 garlic gloves in 1 TBSP butter and then heated the cubed Andouile Sausage.  Otherwise I followed the reciped as it is and the overwhelming reviews are YUMMY... as I said it did turn out a little soggy, but the taste was well balanced and easy to make. Thanks for the idea and the recipe Sorrel!!!

Very good recipe. I used more meat and was out of ground mustard so I put in a healthy pinch of curry. Tasty basic grub, thank you.

My husband and I loved this recipe after I modified it a bit, because I didn't have a couple of the ingredients.  Instead of the bread, I used 3 cooked refrigerator biscuts cut into bit size pieces, and I didn't have enough sausage so I made up the difference with chopped honey ham and it came out fabulous!  Enjoy!

Wonderful!  I made this recipe as directed, and took a tip from another reviewer and rinsed the pork in hot water to remove the grease.  I added frozen spinach (chopped in the food processor) to the egg mixture.  It floated to the top and baked really nice and crip on top of the casserole.  Looked delicious and tasted better than any egg casserole I've ever made!

Super easy & yummy! Made this w/almond milk (that's what we use instead of milk), added diced green onion, & the only sausage I had on hand was chicken/apple breakfast sausage. The sausage gave it a sweet taste. We all loved it. Can't wait to make this again but with mushrooms, spinach & goat (or feta) cheese! A keeper!!!

Yummy!  I did make a few changes:  I had a bag of crusts cut off of white bread for tea-party sandwiches.  So I used ONLY crusts.  I cubed them and toasted them for a few minutes in the preheating oven.  I recalculated the recipe for six, which called for 9 eggs, but I only used 8.  I also added one medium onion, chopped fine and cooked with the sausage.  This was easy and very tasty!

YUMMY!  I made a few adjustments:  used a 11x7 glass baking dish - used 4 slices toasted whole wheat bread (rather than the 2) - used 5 large eggs w/ 1 1/2 C milk (rather than the 3 eggs) - cooked 1 C frozen hash browns in 1 TBS veg oil w/ 1 TBS crushed garlic, & salt & pepper.  Used a shredded Mexicana cheese blend (rather than the Cheddar).  Baked at 375 for 30 minutes.  Will definitely make this again!  Thank you for such a GREAT Sunday morning breakfast idea!  :O)

This recipe came out very good, but very rich. We ate this for dinner one night when there wasn't much else to eat. Better than I thought it'd be. I did add an extra egg, because when I poured the egg mixture over the sausage/cheese it didn't look like enough. Very very good.

It was just okay for me.  I didn't think it was better than any other breakfast casseroles I've made.  The only nice thing is that it's a smaller recipe, so it made a great breakfast Christmas morning for my husband and two small children.

Easy to prepare. I have made this twice now, both times doubled the recipe, no problem. The second time I split it into two pans and made a vegetarian option with spinach, tomatoes and basil. Delicious! I did toast my bread the second time and it was very helpful to the sogginess issue.

I loved this casserole....I did make some changes though.  I used sourdough bread which was yummy!!  And instead of sausage, I used 3 bacon strips and 3 slices of candian bacon.  Basically, i cleaned out my freezer and it turned out perfect!

This was wonderful. I changed the recipe to serve 8 and easily would have served 16. Lots of left overs but is tastes great re-heated. I added some chopped onion and red and green peppers for an additional kick. I will definitely make this again!

I really like this recipe.  I don't eat meat, so instead of the pork, I added some sauteed onions.  You could probably add other veggies too and it would be great.  It was a big hit.  I would definitely double the recipe for more than 4 people.

great very easy breakfast casserole.  I added a bag of prepared spinach to the sausage and it was a definite must. I layered the bread, cheese, and sausage spinach mixture the night before then whipped up the egg mixture and baked just before going to the gathering.  It was a hit with everyone, especially me because it was so easy to make!

Yum!  My husband and I loved this recipe b/c it was so easy...but we substituted torn up croissant rolls instead of cubed bread.  The layers of the rolls filled up with egg mixture and they fluffed right up in the oven.  Delish!  Great recipe!  Thanks for posting!  :)

Doubled the recipe but used a pound of bacon (instead of sausage)and cut it up before frying, rinsing, draining and put on paper towel. I baked about 15 extra minutes because it was still "jiggly" after 30 minutes. Delicious, the overnight guests were impressed.

This was really good! My son, who doesn't eat breakfast casseroles, liked it.  I did make a few small revisions.  I used Honeysuckle White Turkey Sausage and a Cobblestone Mills sub roll, toasted, in place of the bread.  I added green onion, a small sweet red pepper and a dash of garlic powder to the eggs.  I topped with crumbled smoked bacon (prepackaged from Costco).  It was really great.  I will definitely do this one again!

This is my first time taking a recipe from the internet and actually making it. We had an Inauguration office breakfast potluck. The dish turned out great! Thank you very much!

This is a very good basic recipie. It is easy to tweak it to your liking. I am going to try adding hash browns. I also used more sausage becasue I like it that way. Great recipie and super easy!

LOVED IT!!! I followed the instructions as posted except for the meat - I used Turkey sausage links (cooked to a crisp and cut into smaller pieces). It was just enough for two and very filling. It also taste great with grits on the side.

I made too many changes to this recipe to give it four or five stars -- I'll submit a new recipe with the changes. Great start, though!

Everyone loved this and it was so easy! Doubled the recipe (so made it for 4). Didn't have any bread so substituted about 2 cups of ranch flavored croutons and used only 1 1/2 cups of milk (instead of 2). Also, had to bake for 50 minutes before center was cooked. Will definitely make this again.

This recipe was good. The only thing I would change next time would be to put less milk in. I cooked it for thirty minutes and it was still runny in the middle but the top was done. Great taste though! thanks

Excellent.  I had accidentally let a loaf of expensive, organic, multi-grain bread get stale and hard (bad me!), and I couldn't bear to waste it, and didn't feel like making croutons, so I pulled up this recipe.  I needed a sharp, strong serrated knife to cube the bread.  After pouring on the egg mixture, I let it soak for a good hour before baking, to make sure the bread softened.  It was a perfect use for stale bread!  Turned out great.  We actually had it for dinner.  Great dish to make early for a night when you'll have no time to cook.

Yum!  At the suggestion of other reviewers, I added some flavor of my own:  a shake of paprika, chili powder and garlic powder.  I used 3 pieces of bread and left the crusts on (much better consistency for a dish like this).

Finally, a great recipe that is for just one or two people. Its always so hard to do the recipes for a single house hold.

Everyone loved this casserole and wanted the recipe!  We had overnight guests in for a wedding, and I wanted something simple yet tasty.  I replaced the pork sausage with veggie sausage crumbles and nobody knew the difference (;  I didn't have ground mustard so I added a few splashes of hot sauce for flavor..delicious!

Fantastic supper!  I used a 9x13 baking dish - 8 pieces of toast - ripped into pieces for bottom layer, a full pound of sausage, 1/4 cup of chopped red onion and 1 tbsp minced garlic added to the sausage as it was cooking. 9 eggs, 2 cups of milk and 1 cup shredded cojack cheese.  I put the cheese on top, and covered the dish with tin foil as baking at 375 for 40 mins.  Removed the foil and let bake another 10 mins.  Fried up some tater tots for a side.  So good!!  It will be added to the repertoire.

I used sage sausage and this recipe was delicious. It gave it a little spicier flavor. I made the recipe for 6 and we had enough leftover for the day after Christmas. I popped the leftovers into the microwave the next day and it tasted even better.  Wonderful recipe, will use again.
