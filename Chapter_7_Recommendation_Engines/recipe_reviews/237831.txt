Delicious! I marinated mine all day, and used a bit of Italian seasoning in place of the thyme b/c I did not have any on hand. I sliced this for on top of our steak salads, and that was wonderful. Moist and tender with a great flavor...a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

The weather didn¹t cooperate the night we were planning to have this steak, so I held it over until the next night.  It marinated for a total of 32 hours. I made this as written, but omitted the thyme, as a personal
preference.  No problem, the flavor was great!  Although I did make this with a flat iron steak, I’m not a big fan, so next time I'll make this using a different type of steak.  This is a five star marinade!

This was fine, but nothing special.  I marinated overnight and the meat was nicely seasoned.

I love this marinade! I only had time to marinate the beef for about an hour, which I often find is not long enough for the flavors to soak in.  However, the steak was nicely seasoned and the aroma on the grill was wonderful.  I'll definitely be trying the marinade on other cuts of meat.

Never prepared flat iron before. The marinade was delicious. I had just a one pound piece.  I grilled it 6 min on one side and 5 on the other. Done perfectly. Very tender. Will make again.

Flat iron steak can be very tender if not overcooked and if cut across the grain. However, it's not a very flavorful steak by itself (at least in my opinion). I followed this recipe as given, and it was very tasty.

Made this recipe exactly as written. It was delicious! So simple. Now it is my go-to flat-iron steak recipe.
