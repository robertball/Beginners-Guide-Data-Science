Wonderful recipe. Similar but better than Passover Brownies in Second Helpings Please. For easy removal, I greased pan & lined it with parchment paper, which I also greased. At 30 minutes, toothpick doesn't come out clean but the top is set & brownies are perfectly moist. Note: Cake meal is ground finer then regular matzo meal. You can make matzo cake meal by using blender to grind matzo meal into a fine powder. Strain to sift out any lumps. Brownies freeze well. If freezing, don't ice until defrosted. Optional Icing: In microwave, melt in 20 second intervals, 6 ozs. semi-sweet chocolate squares or chips, 1Â½ tbsps. margarine & 1/8 + 1/16 tsp. water.

I thought these brownies were great!  It's so hard to find a passover dessert recipe that tastes delicious as well.  This did it.  I'll be making these every year!

The best Passover brownies I have ever made.  If you don't have cake meal you can use regular matza meal - the consistency will be a bit less smooth, but they will be great nonetheless - and won't last long.

this is the best passover recipe i've found too.  you're also so right about undercooking brownies generally.  these are very close to regular brownies and also freeze very well,

This weekend I'll use this recipe as a 'base' for brownies that I want to make...I'll substitute the veg oil for blue band light olive oil baking product and put in pecans instead of walnuts end crush some eastern egs (chocolate) that I still have and put them in... Oh and I'll use wholeweat flour and yeast since I don't know what matzoh is and i want the brownies nice and fluffy...This was the first recipe I found that didn't require butter but oil and that's what I wanted. (I also tried to look op vegan brownies, but nothing there) I understand it's a Jewish recipe, hope you don't mind I'll tinker with it :-)

Wow... what a wonderful change from the usual tasteless and grainy passover desserts!  This was delicious, and everyone raved about it.  I will definitely serve this again next year.

Very sweet. It also needs more than 30 minutes to bake otherwise it will fall apart.

My late mother handed down this recipe over 50 years ago-- and  yes, it is the best!  So good, that my non- Jewish friend uses it as her go to brownie recipe.

I made these brownies for our Passover Seder, and everyone loved them. I used only half the walnuts, and I sprinkled them on half of the batter so people could choose brownies with or without nuts. I definitely will be making these again!

This was easy, easy, easy!  My youngest daughter said they taste like a packet mix (high praise indeed!) and nothing like a pasech dessert - thank you.

These are fabulous, and will definitely become an annual Seder  dessert.  It's easy and fast.  I  plan to make some for gifts during Passover.  I used 2 cups sugar, which was enough.  I placed the walnut pieces on top which looks  great.  My 15 year oven had just been leveled.  At 30 minutes the brownies were  more than done so I'll check them at 25 minutes next time.  Thank you for a winner!

I hit enter and couldnât edit... oops.   Anyway cooked for exactly 30 minutes, 8x11ish oiled pan, toothpick not completely clean but close enough.  These are fabulous!  I didnât add the nuts (donât like) but these brownies are rich, super chocolate and moist.  Cannot wait to serve them tomorrow night!  5 stars!

Outstanding recipe. I have made it many times. I had lost my old recipe, and found this one. It is better than my old one.  I use chocolate chips instead of nuts. I have shared this recipe with all my sisters and my mom. If you only have matzo meal and not matzo cake meal, just do as other commenters have suggested, and process the matzo meal in a food processor until it is a finer powder.
