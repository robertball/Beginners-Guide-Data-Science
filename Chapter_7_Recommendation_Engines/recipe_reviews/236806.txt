Another great job, Chef John!  This was exactly what I wanted for Shrimp and Grits!  I make a Cheese Grits Casserole often and it worked well for this dish, and added the make-ahead benefit!  The shrimp and sauce mixture was very tasty, and so good that I will make more sauce next time!  Recommend passing the shrimp thru the hot pan quickly, add the veg's, then sauce, then shrimp back to finish.  So easy to overcook shrimp!  This will be a great brunch dish!

I would definitely make this again.  The sauce is delicious and I made 1 1/2 times the amount the recipe called for since we like a lot of sauce.  I would not change a thing except to thicken the sauce a bit.  When you make a lot of sauce it runs all over the plate.  I may try leaving out the water and just use the cream, lemon juice, and Worcestershire.  Also, I use chicken broth to cook the grits instead of water.

This was the best shrimp and grits we have ever tasted!  Thank you so very much for sharing this recipe.  I do cook my grits using a couple of teaspoons of powdered chicken stock in the water, which really enhances the flavor of the grits.  I will definitely be serving this frequently.

Delicious! The flavors melt together perfectly. My hubby loved it, being the first time he has eaten this dish. Also, the grits were the “instant” grits. (Sent my hubby to the grocery store) But it totally worked! This recipe is a keeper. Thank you Chef John!

This was yumbolicious. You really can't go wrong with cream and lemon but the Cajun flavoring took it to another level. I had to use 2 lbs of smaller shrimp and so I doubled the sauce. There ended up being too much sauce so I will adjust that next time. I used the Cajun seasoning recipe from this site. I also had some leftover Andouille sausage that I put in with the bacon. I just realized I never added the fresh garlic, whoopsie. Didn't notice it at all, don't think it's necessary.

Delicious! I made a double recipe, and I had a lot of grits left over. Next time I make it, I'll probably double the grits ingredients and triple the shrimp/sauce ingredients so that I have the right ratio of shrimp/sauce to grits. I had never made grits before, and the recipe didn't say to cover the pot, but the box of grits said to cook them covered, so I did. Other than that, I followed the recipe to a T.

My "go to" for shrimp and grits! I had some Andouille sausage that needed to get used so I substituted it for the bacon with great results. Also increased the cream/water/lemon/Worcestershire since everyone loves the "gravy" on the grits. I'm a big fan of Chef John's recipes -easy and great results!

I have used this recipe as a base two times now. Hubby has ulcers and horrid reflex so I have to tame down the hotter ingredients. I don't keep Cajun seasoning on had so I use a spicy Italian seasoning grinder. It has just the right about of kick for us. I also found out tonight that it you don't have green onion, white onion works too. I will definitely keep this recipe around.

Right up there with what we're used to--New Orleans Shrimp and Grits. I don't keep whipping cream on hand, so I replaced it with 1/2 nonfat plain yogurt and 1/2 unsweetened soy milk. We didn't miss the whipping cream, but it probably would have put this over the top. Definitely a keeper!

Pretty simple and reasonably quick - great for a delicious meal! The amount of water you'll need for the grits depends a lot on the type of grits you're using. For me, using "quick grits," 3 1/2 cups water for 1 cup of grits did the job. Also, it was done in about 12 minutes. A creamier version could be made by adding the grits to cold water.  The seasoning blend for the shrimp is very good. Be careful with the cooking time. Adjust based on the size of your shrimp. Nothing worse than overcooked rubbery shrimp. Just to sneak in some vegetables, at the very end, I added a large handful of baby spinach and allowed it to wilt in the shrimp sauce. This was very tasty and not very complicated. If you get everything prepped in advance, this recipe comes together very quickly. Worth the effort!

I followed the directions. I didn't use grits though. I made cauliflower small enough to have the grits texture. Followed the recipe with Allrecipes too. this was very good and will last for work lunches. Thanks Allrecipes.

Nice dish! It came out great.  The only improvement I made was taking the tails off of the shrimp before cooking.  Much easier to eat that way.

This was absolutely delicious!  I made it tonight for dinner and my son and husband gobbled it up! I found the ingredients and the directions to be very easy.  I'm not a cook at all, but this was very easy to follow and the taste was awesome.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks so much Chef John for making a non-cook feel like a chef!

I used this recipe tonight. I reduced the servings to 3. I didnt use jalapeño peppers and I didn't have Worcestershire. I added a minced shallot and more garlic. The sauce was excellent. We enjoyed this very much. Next time I will use the jalapeños and Worcestershire.

Great recipe, always wanted to try shrimp and grits, family loved it--left out the cayenne pepper and jalepeno since my family doesn't care for spicy, I on the otherhand love spicy.

Delicious! I added some sautéed smoked sausage. Cooked the grits in chicken broth. Will double or triple the sauce next time. It was perfect! Tasted better that what I have gotten at restaurants

Really delicious!  Will save a little of the cooked bacon for a BLT next time, but bacon lovers will like that element.  I was concerned about the blandness of the cheese grits, but after putting the sauce on top that was made with the shrimp,  it makes perfect sense. Good call by the chef.  Watch out for flying hot grits while stirring when they cook.

I will definitely make this again. I used chicken broth in grits instead of water. I also used Parmesan instead of cheddar for the grits. It makes the grits saltier, but I prefer Parmesan over cheddar in my grits. Otherwise, I made the shrimp part exactly as given. Just enough spice . Not overpowering. Absolutely delicious!

This was the perfect recipe for Shrimp and Grits that I have been looking for. I doubled the recipe for a dinner party and only made small changes. I used 2X the cheese and substituted smoked Gouda. I can’t wait to make it again!

Only thing I changed was the use of milk rather than cream and thin turkey bacon. Other than that it was delicious and the family loved it.

I hate to do this but I modified the recipe. Personally I hate when people do that then review but here I go doing the same thing! I left out the cream. Added cheese and okra to the grits. It was beyond amazing. I’m going to make it again but I don’t see what the cream would do for this other than make a richer, fattier sauce. Without the cream the sauce was thin but I guess the cheese and okra in the grits made up for it. When the shrimp and the grits combined the taste was perfect and rich.

Delicious - but I think the sauce had too much water.  I did double the sauce ingredients, but next time I would NOT double the water.  I would have liked it a bit thicker.  I also added mushrooms, which I sauteed with the onion and garlic a bit before adding it to the sauce (could that have thinned it too much?).  Took veggies out of pan, sauteed shrimp for a minute and then added sauce/veggies back in to finish cooking.  Also, remember to make the grits with broth, not water - forgot this time, and definitely not as flavorful.  Still good, though!

Used fresh gulf shrimp.   Had to use pickled jalapeños as couldn’t get fresh but otherwise went by the recipe.  It was excellent and not too over the top as far as prep.

Thank you, Chef John, for yet another award winning recipe !!! The only thing I did differently was put less shrimp in my own bowl due to chewing issues, but no one else complained that they got too much !!

Chef John’s recipes never disappoint. I added some diced tomatoes to mine not because it needed them but just because of a craving I was having. Turned out fantastic! And so easy to make. I did mine with my toddler hanging all over me.

This is a good recipe but the grits weren't very creamy.  To really get those grits nice and creamy, I added about a 1/4 to 1/3 cup of heavy cream to the water for the grits, brought that to a boil and then simmered them in that for about 20 minutes.

This was amazing! And I made it. I love Shrimp and Grits and make a point to order it whenever I can. And people have raved about the recipe I’ve used for years from this site. This, for me, is the best and will be the standard by which all are judged. I made a few adjustments for my family. I used regular cheddar and more bacon. I love bacon, but use thick sliced if possible and don’t burn it. There is often a fine line between crispy and burned. Sometimes I add smoked sausage because husband loves it. Don’t be tempted to use quick cooking grits. Is you live in an area that doesn’t have grits, check Amazon. It’s worth the effort. Enjoy!

This is absolutely delicious and very easy to execute. I’ve made it twice and doubled the sauce both times. I think I will triple the sauce next time because it’s just too good. I love the garlic level but it’s a little too much for my husband.  Next time I will add the garlic sooner so it cooks out more and might cut the garlic in half (sadly) ;).

First time ever making Shrimp and Grits and it was super easy and better than any I have had from any restaurant. It has a bit of of a creamy taste with just a bit of spice(I added more spice that the recipe called for because I love spicy food). Will be making it again this week.

I think next time I’ll  remove half of the bacon drippings. I found it to be a little to greasy,  especially leftovers

This is a great recipe. I followed everything exactly except for Cajun seasoning which I did not have instead I used Old Bay spice and it was delicious and flavorful. My entire family liked it. It tasted of restaurant quality to me. Thank you for this delicious recipe!

I had to add nearly a cup of liquid to keep the grits from getting too dry during cooking. It’s not the best I’ve had but it was tasty. Other than the added liquid I followed the recipe.

So good! My husband and two year old loved it!! I didn’t have cream or lemon yuck so I used whole milk and lemon pepper seasoning. I also used a whole cup of yellow cheddar cheese. Next time I would start the grits before I do anything else because that’s the only thing that takes time to make.

I'd definitely cut the salt down. Between the bacon, shrimp and cheese, it didn't need that much. Very tasty. Would like a bit creamier sauce.

Made it for date night with hubby, it was easy enough to cook together. I drained a bit extra of the bacon fat, there was still more than enough to cook the shrimp. I also used black pepper bacon, yum!. This is the second time i've made it and will for sure make it again.

Will try again to review this wonderful recipe.  Used turkey broth instead of water.  Made it with 1 1/2 pounds of large fresh shrimp for 5 of us.  Did not add lemon juice or jalapeño.  Also we love grits!  Used Old Fashion Grits that you simmer for 20 min.  The flavor of this recipe was Devine!  The best we have ever had!

I followed the recipe with a few modifications: 1) added Andouille sausages; 2) added bell peppers and yellow onions; 3) substitured the cheese using a smoked Gouda with siracha in the grits. It was delicious.

The shrimp and sauce is divine!! Thanks Chef John! I’ve made this twice and the style of grits just isn’t my taste or a fave of my family’s. I prefer my grits very creamy, smooth, and moist so the second time I made this I made the grits according to how I like them. But overall, this entire recipe is a must try and worthy of a repeat:) Enjoy!!

Absolutely delicious!  I omitted the bacon.  Sauteed half of an onion with half of a red pepper and blended it with the cream mixture.  It was amazing!

OMG, it is so good. I made a few modifications. I sautéed my veggie before adding the cream sauce. I add onion and mushrooms to increase the flavor. I use Parmesan cheese because that all I had. I also took the advice of another home cook. I cut the shrimps in the bacon fat first and then sat them to the sides. Then I  added the shrimp to the sauce 2 minuets before serving.  Overall excellent dish. My husband and I devoured it.

This was so delicious!  When you're hungry for shrimp and grits, this is the best recipe ever. 
I don't have any heavy cream - just half and half, but that hopefully will work fine. 
Thanks, Chef John, for this winning recipe.

Great recipe.  I used diced red bell peppers instead of jalapeño since my Mom is sensitive to things too spicy.  Delish!

As usual, Chef John created another delicious recipe!  The only change I made is I used Costco’s bacon crumbles instead of bacon and I chopped a whole jalapeño, so was 2 or 3 Tbsp.  Since the bacon crumbles were  already cooked, I only had to heat them in the skillet and removed them once they had browned.  The bacon crumbles  generate a lot less fat than bacon, but enough to cook the shrimp.  The amount of grits is more than we needed, but that’s because a pound of shimp is only enough for two servings (seriously, can anyone be satisfied with  just 4 oz of shrimp?!). Not to worry, I just reheated the leftover grits for breakfast the next day.

I followed the recipe (except for using instant grits (the only kind we could find) and served the dish for brunch.  It received, and merited, high praise and clean plates.

My husbands favorite meal now. In the 14 years of marriage, he said this is by far the best meal I have cooked. I didn’t have the seasoning so I used old bay seasoning for the shrimp. Definitely a great dish. So much flavor profile.

Really good recipe. I grew up eating this dish. I wanted to make something similar to Mom's and this hit the spot. The only difference is that I use chicken broth in place of the water, used speckled grits and regular yellow cheddar since that's what I had on hand. The dish came out flavorful just like I like it!

Chef John... you are awesome!! Followed recipe with a few modifications. Placed some chicken stock and water for grits for added flavor. Next time might do just water with extra sharp white cheddar. Felt the chicken stock took away some of the natural grit flavor. I used Cajun andouille sausage instead of bacon, so I omitted the Cajun seasoning. Added sliced sweet bell peppers and asparagus for color and veggies. Used red onion because I forgot to buy the green onion. I added asparagus the same time as the shrimp so it would remain al denté. The dish still turned out super flavorful and was even better as a left over. My husband loved it and doesn’t handle spicy foods. This was our first attempt with the shrimp and grits. SOOOO thankful for Chef John!! No recipe tried this far has disappointed!! You’re the bomb!! Thank you for sharing your expertise and love for food.

Delicious!  I did it without the jalapeños and cayenne pepper because I made it for my wife and son (8). Also, most Cajun seasonings already have salt so check and make sure if the one your using does.  If it does I would just about double the Cajun seasoning and not add the salt.  Also by doubling the Cajun you add plenty of heat but still keep it tolerable if you’re sensitively spicy.  I added extra cheese to ensure my son would love it!

My first attempt at making this dish, and I will be making it again soon!  I decreased the water slightly and replaced it with some of the heavy cream, worked great.  This turned my hubby who swore he hated grits into someone who likes them!

Outstanding! So savory and flavorful! I made sure to use fresh gulf shrimp. I think a dish of this caliber deserves fresh shrimp for sure. I didn’t measure the dry spices and I swapped heavy whipping cream for half and half because it’s what I had on hand. I can’t speak to how much better it would have been with the whipping cream because it was out of this world as I made it! Very easy recipe. Do the prep ahead of time as the recipe suggests.

This was ... fine. But the bacon was so over powering that I am sure we won't make this recipe again. Certainly edible, just not a balanced dish, IMO.

I just ate shrimp and grits for the first time in Alabama at a Pappadauex restaurant and wanted it again! Chef Johns recipe was delicious and I'll make it again. I did add just a little sugar and corn to the grits.  Yummy!!

Made it as presented in recipe. It was just what I was looking for. It was loved by my 4 dinner guests. Have traveled the south looking for the best shrimp and grits and thought I had found them in Cortez, Florida. This recipe is right up there with the best.

I used 8 slices of thick sliced bacon, and added 3 cups of sharp cheddar to the grits.  It was delicious.

I didn't have any bacon, but had some real bacon bits, that worked perfectly.  Served with Cheesy Grits.  Will definitely make this again.

Not much to say, except that this is the best shrimp and grits I've ever tasted. Didn't change a thing, and looking forward to making a double or triple batch next time to feed to my friends!

Prepping ahead is very important as Chef John states.  Shrimp cooks very quickly; it becomes tough and chewy if overcooked.  Wonderful quick easy winner recipe!

First time eating and making shrimp and grits.  Absolutely delicious!  We definitely did not expect it to be so awesome.  We love shrimp, but grits?  This will definitely be made again, hopefully when one of our sons comes to visit.

Omg, so flavorful and wonderful.  It was even better the next day.  My husband and I agree this one is a keeper.  

As for changes to the recipe, I didn't make much.  First of all I forgot to tell my husband to get raw shrimp so we had cooked shrimp, which worked pretty well.  I also do not like things too spicy and he does, so I cooked the shrimp concoction in 2 separate pans.  I added red pepper flakes to his (a suggestion someone else made).  That was the only changes.  Definitely making this one again!

Great base. Loved it. I make a few minor adjustments the 2nd time I made it. -half the suggested lemon juice, added a small squirt of hot sauce, and I added Parmesan cheese and a little garlic powder to the shrimp sauce mixture. Love it. Oh and I added mushrooms ( I love mushrooms)

This is another good Chef John recipe. I used chorrizo in place of bacon and it turned out great! The broth had a good flavor and a mild cheddar adds just a hint to the grits. I will definitely try this again as written and possibly using chicken chorrizo cubes instead of bacon as well.  Grits arent as difficult as I feared to make so I cant wait to do this again!

This was the best shrimp and grits I've ever eaten!  Between mouthfulls I kept exclaiming how delicious it was.  It far exceeded my expectations, and it's worthy of the finest restaurant.  I did leave out the jalapeno, and I doubled the sauce.

I'm not much for the version of shrimp and grits that contains sausage, so I was very eager to try this recipe. It did not disappoint! The only revision I'll try next time I make it is to leave out the 1/4 cup of water in the cream mixture, and instead add water little by little until the right consistency for the sauce is achieved. With the full 1/4 cup of water, the sauce was a little too thin for my liking.

I have made many of Chef Johns recipes.  This one is good as always.  The recipe may seem complicated, but don't worry.  It works very well and the process does make perfect sense.  I have eaten other "shrimp and grits" dinners, but for a southern boy in the SC Lowcountry this is spot on.  Just make sure you use a good stone ground "slow cook" type of grits.  Thanks again.

We love this recipe! The first time I made it I didn't include the cayenne pepper. Made it for dinner tonight added the cayenne and the spice is perfect!! I typically don't like spicy / hot food but this recipe has just the right amount of seasoning.  Put it in my "keeper" recipe file.

This was a huge hit with my whole family. I only changed the jalapeño for some diced green chilies because that's what I had. Amazing!

I made this according to the recipe with one exception.  I used fat-free half and half instead of the heavy cream because that's what I had on hand.  I have tried shrimp and grits at a lot of good restaurants and this recipe is better than any I have ever tasted.  Thanks so much for this delicious recipe, Chef John!

Great recipe!   And thanks to so many helpful suggestions it's easy to tweak too.  I  used polenta (with a little butter, cream and cheese of course) instead of grits and my shrimp seasoning were: Old Bay, Tony Chachere's, cumin & red pepper flakes.   The cream sauce worked/tasted perfect as directed.  Remember to garnish with the bacon - if you put it into the liquid it gets soggy and looses it's appeal.

Overall we liked it, but the creole seasoning I used (Tony's) already had salt in it, and even though I didn't add any additional salt, it was VERY salty. Also, the sauce was really thin, which I did not expect. If I make this  again, I will make my own creole seasoning.

Delicious recipe, Chef John is a super star. I had to substitute bacon with chicken andouille sausage.  I also added a can of Rotel tomatoes because I needed to stretch the dish a bit. It was spicy but the creamy grits cooled it down. Will make again and again!

This was great!  I upped the recipe and increased the spices quite a bit, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  My husband and I both loved it.  I prepped everything before I started cooking and it went together like a breeze.  This turned out restaurant quality.  Put it all together in tupperware overnight for the best leftovers ever!  I have made a lot of meals from Allrecipes and I think this is my favorite.

I forgot to add garlic, but I will definately add it the next time. The recipe was on key with the amount of jalapeno.  I did add 1 C of cheese to the grits and was pleased with that decision

Wow!  Being born and raised in the Low Country, I am VERY picky about my shrimp and grits.  This was excellent! Great blend of flavors.  Not super complicated or fancy.  Leftovers were almost better than the first serving.  My respect to Chef John.

Fabulous! I doubled the recipe. I used a 6 Pepper Blend instead of the cayenne pepper. I also added a little more bacon and onion. I used Quick Grits to speed up the cooking. I'm eating the leftover grits for breakfast tomorrow. This recipe is the bomb!

Wow. Chef John. I really love your taste of things. I've tried several of your recipes and love them all. I tend to substitute for what I don't have. I used chopped dried onion instead of green onion. I think green onion would have been fresher but I didn't have it. One again pleased. Thank u so much

This was quite delicious! I didn't know what to expect because I never tried shrimp and grits before. The combo seemed odd but I always wanted to try  it. Well, much to my surprise it was great. I only adjusted the seasonings to my family's taste, other than that I stuck to the recipe. They loved it, too. I definitely will be making again.

Very good and simple! I added a cube shrimp bouillon and a splash of the heavy whipping cream to the grits, made it so rich and creamy.  I also sautéed some bell peppers to add some crunch and color to the plate.

My husband loves shrimp. LOVES. Quote after his first bite... 'this is sinfully delicious'. After a few more he put down his spoon, turned to me, and said 'Honey. This is amazing.' That is all I need. I will be making this for the rest of our lives! So good.

This was great!  Made it at her place for a date and it made me look like a super star.  I used more and smaller shrimp and added about 1/4 cup each diced orange pepper and roma tomato in with the shrimp.  Also went with polenta instead of grits and used goat cheese with it instead of cheddar.

Delicious!  I followed other suggestions to remove the shrimp after searing, and I added it back just before serving.  I increased the amount of sauce (I'm all about the "gravy!), and I suggest leaving out the water.  My sauce was thin, and I had to cook it down to a more gravy-like consistency.  The flavor was outstanding, and my guys ate it up!

Love love love!!! Never been a fan of grits so I was a bit skeptical, but the white cheddar cheese is what sold me on this recipe!! Made no changes except to lower the amount of salt and it turned out perfect, creamy, and oh so yummy!! Thank you chef John, you are a culinary genius!! ??

I would expect no less than awesome from any Chef John recipe and I was not disappointed.  This was EXCELLENT.  Perfect amount of spice too.  I could have eaten it for dinner every night.  Thank you for another amazing recipe.
