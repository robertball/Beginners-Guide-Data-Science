There is a mistake here.  The volume of whipped cream/pudding/half and half is twice as much as what a 9" crust can hold.  My husband's cousin and I laughed at the huge bowl (at least 8 cups) of pure fat that was left over to do what with?  Why bother with the small package of vanilla pudding?  I would try cutting the whipping cream in half, and maybe doubling the pudding.  Also, with only two bananas in this pie, you are just messing with the minds of the people who actually think that they will have the flavor of banana.  I was very very disappointed, and peniless after making this pie.  Very expensive and nobody could eat it, WAY TOO MUCH FAT!

This is the BEST banana cream pie ever!! It was so easy and seriously addictive. Everyone who tried it, loved it and said that it tasted like it was from a bakery. I will definitely be making this again!

THE GOOD NEWS:  If you follow the directions, this filling will stand up in thick, DELICIOUS peaks.  Tastes wonderful! Makes a great looking & tasty pie.

THE SO-SO NEWS: This recipe makes enough for two 10" deep dish pies, even with piling the filling up very high. 

THE BAD NEWS: If the crushed ice is anything but the smallest pieces...and I mean smallest, the ice will catch in the beaters and fling whipping cream ALL OVER THE KITCHEN. I do not have an electric crusher so I used the old standby, hitting the ice with a hammer while contained in a strong plastic bag.  I measured a cup of the stuff and put back into the freezer until I was ready to add to the mixture.  Some of the pieces aparently froze together, making a larger piece....AND A MESS OF MY KITCHEN.  

SUMMARY:  Would I make again?  If I needed 2 pies...yes.  If I needed just one....No, not worth buying another appliance just to crush ice.

I loved this recipe!! I made it for Christmas last year and will make it again!!  I can't imagine why anyone would have problems with this pie(review above). It was so easy, you just have to be patient when mixing.  It takes a long time, especially if you don't have a stand mixer.  Right when you think you did something wrong, it starts to set up and get real thick.  Everyone loved it!!!

Not impressed.  I had to add an extra box of pudding mix just to get it thick enough for as much liquid ingredients as it calls for.  Which then adds some time to the preparation.  Lucky I had an extra box on hand.  Is it worth the 640 calories? - my opinion is no.

my only tweak was a little powdered sugar to sweeten it up a little. i work at a restaurant and i used this recipe to make individual pies and they have been a big hit.

I tried this recipe because I love whipped cream.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out REALLY runny.  I was able to salvage the pie but I would not recommend this recipe to others.

This was a great recipe!  I took the advise of the other reviews, and made sure to keep mixing (longer than you think it needs). Great thickness! I think next time though, I will use banana flavor pudding to give it extra banana flavor.  I thought this was a little bland.

I made this with half the whipping cream and half and half and used the banaba pudding instead of vanilla and it was wonderful!  I beat it for 15 minutes total and it was never really smooth like pudding, but it didnt matter.  One person said it was the best banana cream pie he ever had - not too much flavor but not boring!  Not bad for a first try!!

I added a touch of vanilla, added 4 banana in each pie.  This makes filling for two extra large pies.  Forget the ice and I mixed this in a metal bowl with the ice on the outside.  For 1 pie I used half the liquid and still omitted the ice.

A whole lot of fluff . This pie presents itself well, however I waisted alot of filling and that was dissapointing. I could have made two 10 inch pies from this recipe if not more. My father-in-law loved it, my husband thought it lacked flavor. He said it tasted like a whipped cream pie. Next time, I would probably do as one of the others said and reduce the cream to half and maybe add vanilla or more pudding to enhance the flavor. I give it 4 stars because it does make a beautiful pie.

5 Stars because the final result was GREAT!  Wow, what a pie!  The texture and taste was amazing - substantially creamy but also light and fluffy.  It was fairly easy to make.  What I changed, however: used only 2 cups of whipping cream and 1 cup of half-and-half (I just could not bring myself to use all that cream!), did not use the ice.  Could only find banana instant pudding in the store, so I used that instead of vanilla.  My crust was graham cracker, and the final pie was topped with coconut flakes.  Despite cutting the ingredients in half, I still had plenty of filling left over, and made little parfaits from it.

This is much too rich with all the heavy cream.  I used a 10 inch graham cracker pie shell which was a much better presentation as well as better tasting.  I also added at least one more banana.

I didn't care for this unfortunately.  To my husband and I and our friends it tasted like you were eating whipping cream.  It really had no other flavor.  Also it probably makes enough to make 3 to 4 deep dish pies.  I am disappointed :(

Turns out to be pie soup, no consistency or taste makes enough for two pie tins. Something is wrong with the liquid ratio here. very disappointing

It was light and tasty..but the ice flew right out of my bowl and made a huge mess on my counter..so I omitted it.  Also, this made enough for 2 very large pies, not the one it says..

This pie is awesome, just be sure not to over beat it or it gets too firm to get in the pie shell.  This is the best pie I have ever made.
