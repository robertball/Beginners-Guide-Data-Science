I don't know why, but my recipe was changed from PORK STEAKS to pork chops.  I prefer pork steaks -- better value for the buck than pork chops.

I went about this differently.  I used fresh sweet potatoes, which I microwaved until almost done and mashed them with the butter, spices and orange marmalade, omitting the sugar and vanilla extract.  I then placed the sweet potatoes in a baking dish and topped with pecans and baked it along with the chops.  A side of fresh steamed broccoli and I had a perfect fall dinner. Thanks!
