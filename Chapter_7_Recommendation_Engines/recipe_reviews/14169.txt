I followed this recipe almost exactly (something new for me) and it was ... wow ... incredible.  I served it at a party, and got rave reviews -- two people even asked for the recipe!

Based on the feedback of others, I started out with only 1 tbl of sugar, then added more to taste.  The end result was probably close to 2 tbl.  I also added a bit of lemon and lime zest to the dressing.

Warning: I think this recipe ends up closer to 10 servings.  I had to make it in my huge wooden salad bowl, because even my largest mixing bowl wasn't adequate.

By the way, this is even better after a few days, when the flavors have time to fully meld.  I usually make this at least two days ahead of time.

The best bean salad I have made.  I halved the oil, vinegar and sugar.  Thank goodness I read the post.  This amount suited the recipe just fine.  Thanks

I made this for a Mexican Pot Luck at my husband's office. Even though 40 people brought dishes, this was one of the few that was entirely devoured! This is a wonderful, tasty, and colorful salad. Very attractive served in a trifle bowl, or any clear glass bowl. I wouldn't change a thing.

So delicious. I have made this salad over and over again with awesome results each time. I usually cut the sugar in half. I like to add powdered garlic, and extra cilantro. I use Great White Northern beans instead of Cannelini. Red onions add a pretty color. We make this all the time! I am confused by the raters that say there is too much dressing... I think the amount is right on. Although I do use a can of corn instead of frozen... maybe the extra liquid comes from the frozen corn. Sometimes I add a can of chopped tomatoes. You can add any veggies you like, the salad doesn't care. I would give this more stars if I could.

Very colorful, pretty salad! I used a 15-oz. can of corn (drained) instead of frozen (time saver).  I decreased the olive oil and red wine vinegar to 1/4 cup each. I would also suggest decreasing the salt to 3/4 Tbl and decreasing the pepper a bit. The second time I made this, I decreased the olive oil and vinegar to 1/8 each - would do that again (just make sure to decrease all the spices some as well).  Thanks for the recipe!

This was excellent!  However, two peppers is entirely "two" much...one is more than plenty.  And be sure to use fresh or frozen corn, not canned.  Canned corn has no texture and does nothing for the salad.  I subbed balsamic vinegar for the red wine vinegar...very good.  Way more than enough dressing...cut it down to 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup vinegar, but keep the rest of the ingredients as stated for marvelous flavor.  Add some minced jalapenos for spice!

Very yummy!  I made it just as written except left out the hot pepper sauce.  Served over a bed of Romaine with the option of crushed tortilla chips and sour cream on top.  Everyone at the party loved it, too.

Made it exactly as recipe called for.  Really good flavor but way too much oil and vinegar.  Next time I'll use 1/4 of what is called for and will reduce onion as well.  I ended up tossing a lot of it due to it being overly greasy.

A LOT of ingredients!  I took this to work today for a potluck and it seemed to go over very well.  I didn't have cannelli beans, but used another white bean and I didn't have fresh lemon or lime juice so used bottled juice.  Otherwise, I didn't change a thing.  I will make this again. Thanks for sharing!

This was fantastic! The second time, I turned it into Asian Bean Salad!!!

Instead of cannellini beans, I used Edamame (a favorite), added 1/4 tsp. of ground ginger instead of cumin, chopped celery leaves instead of cilantro, and rice wine instead of red wine vinegar.

I took this to a party and everyone loved it. I added a lot more spices and a jalepeno to suit our tastebuds. Also I subbed garbanzo beans instead of cannellini beans. As suggested by another reviewer, marinating the beans (without vegetables to avoid sogginess) is a must, it makes a HUGE difference in taste over time. Great salad, even my husband liked it!! and he is the pickiest eater i know.

This was a hit at our luncheon. I made it the night before and put it in the fridge. I took it out, stirred it up, and popped it on the buffet table! Very tasty. I did not change a thing. I would suggest draining and rinsing the beans in a colander and letting them sit while you do the chopping to give them time to drain thoroughly. Thank you Karen for sharing the recipe.

Wow!  Great!  At first when I tasted the dressing I didn't think it was going to be anything special, but mixed with the vegetables it is great!  I used an orange pepper (b/c we don't "do" green) and it made it SO colorful.  Also, I didn't have a lime, and I'm sure that would make it even better.

I have made this several times for a work 'Cinco De Mayo' potluck and it is always a huge hit.

I did follow the advice of another and made the dressing and soaked all the beans in that for a day and then added the veggies the night before the potluck.  In all the beans marinated for 2 days and the veggies overnight!  What a huge difference.  The beans really soaked up the flavors of the dressing.

Personally, I don't like serving this really cold as the olive oil starts to 'gel' up and that kinds of grosses me out, but otherwise I followed the recipe as listed.

A great potluck item that is not mayo based and having to worry about how long it's been sitting out at the buffet.

WOW! For a slight variation, I added more oil and vinegar, an extra can of red kidney beans, 1 cup of organic brown rice (in its uncooked form), a diced cucumber, and 2 vine-ripened tomatoes-- with more spice to accommodate that. It is also AMAZING in a wrap with shredded boiled chicken that was soaked in Italian dressing, and then I added guacamole and sour cream with some lettuce. It tastes just like those fabulous Mexican grill wraps. :)

Love this receipe!  The longer it "marinates" the better it is.  I sometimes add some minced jalapenos for 'zip'.

This is DEFINITELY the best bean salad I have ever tasted.  My Mom-in-law even loved it and she doesn't like beans!  I have made it several times, and I always have an empty bowl by the end of the evening.  One night I threw in some chopped leftover grilled chicken and had a marvelous meal.  MMM Good!

I am IN LOVE. I've made this twice in the past week, my man and I just can't get enough. This recipe would be perfect as-is but I skipped the corn and sugar as I try to steer clear of adding more sugar into my diet (emphasis on try), and instead I added a cup of pine nuts. Another great way to eat this? Pile it on top of a bed of fresh baby spinach and pour some of the vinaigrette from the bottom of the bowl on top. DELICIOUS.

This is a WONDERFUL salad!  I have been making it for about 3 years now at least!  Very good on its own but what I do to really make it to my taste is this...  I add a touch more sugar (3 tablespoons) and instead of 1 clove of garlic I use 3.  I just LOVE the garlic in this.  It may not be for everyone but for me its great.  I also do a little less chilli powder because its can be a bit spicy with the extra garlic I put in.  But the by far is a amazing salad and I always get compliments.  Mostly I make it in the summer but it is a nice even in the winter!

I decreased the amount of cumin & left out the cilantro but you can adjust the cumin & chili powder amounts to how spicy you'd like this dish.  I have another bean salad that calls for the red onion to be sliced very thinly & I think I'd like that better then the chopped onion.  If I make this again, I may add or substitute green beans, wax beans &/or chick peas.  Also, one tip is to take this salad out before serving, maybe half an hour before, as the olive oil solidifies in the fridge.

This is a fantastic recipe - it is the reason why I began to trust allrecipes.com. I've been making this recipe for a few years now and this is how I've modified it: omit the 1/2 cup red wine vinegar and instead use 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar (or even white wine is fine, but apple cider vinegar works fantastic) along with 1-2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar. How much balsamic vinegar you use depends on the strength and quality of your balsamic. I use a 10 yr aged one, so only 1 tablespoon. When I use the inferior quality, supermarket one, I use two tablespoons. Try out 1 tablespoon first and see how it tastes - add more as necessary.

I don't use the hot pepper or chili powder, as I tend to be pretty wimpy when it comes to spicy. I often substitute the beans to what I have on head - but try to keep the color variety. For example, I've used chickpeas instead of cannellini beans. I've also used tomatoes & cucumbers instead of red & green peppers. Just try to keep the salad colorful and it'll be a hit. Always.

Not my thing at all. Way too much vinegar makes it difficult to taste the other flavours. Although it sounds like it should taste mexican, it tasted more like a deli three bean salad to me. It would probably be good though if the vinegar was DRASTICALLY reduced and the lime increased. And I agree that the quantity of dressing should be halved. I would also try fresh jalepenos instead of hot sauce.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe!  Although, I always reduce the oil and red wine vinegar by half but keep the other amounts of spices.  I have also been adding other veggies to it like diced celery, grape tomatoes, and black olives!  It's a family favorite!!

I have never really liked beans but am trying to expand my horizons. This dish was good the first day but FABULOUS as time went on. This is definitely a keeper! Thank you!

I read all of the reviews for this recipe and ended up not changing a thing, although I do think you should start with a TBS of sugar and work your way up to your own taste. 

There is lots of liquid in the recpie, but I liked this about it, so I didn't consider the dressing recipe to be too large. 

Most importantly, this recipe is DELICIOUS. Thanks for a great light addition to my mexican-inspired repertiore!

There is a reason that this recipe gets such high ratings!  It is delicious!  After reading the reviews, I decided to make it as is with the exception of the sugar--and I started with a tablespoon and then added one more teaspoon.  It is perfect.  Very yummy.  Do be sure to make it at least the evening before eating!  I personally love the amount of dressing in it----it's good dribbled over the Mexican Rice II!

Great recipe! It was a huge hit. I used a can of pinto and red beans instead of the ones listed, and opted out of the hot sauce. I followed the rest of the recipe as listed. It was great! I love recipes that can be prepared in the morning or the night before. This one is a keeper.

I made the dressing and served it over romaine lettuce, tomotoes, cheddar chunks and tortilla chips. It was awesome. I made it for a guest and gave her the recipe and she has made it twice more since our lunch together. Thanks for sharing!

Loved this bean salad. Even my teenage daughter said   "Dad, I really like that stuff you made, just less onions next time, its on my breath".   Anyone with a teenage girl in the house knows that is as close to a compliment as you can expect and also why the onion breath is a no no!
I made the recipe as listed except for the salt. I did not add any since there is enough sodium in the dish naturally and the acids give it enough zing that I did not think it was necessary. Was great without it!
 Beans are a great source of protein, iron, fiber... not to mention they are filling. I also believe the citrus in this recipe has more health attributes then they are normally given credit for.
 Thanks for a great recipe.

I just discovered I rate this already and didn't know it.  However, I wanted to change my rating and re-review it.  I thought it was a *bit* too tangy (just a bit, like having to take a drink of something after every bite), and I just reduced the vinegar and lime & lemon juices just a bit (maybe 3/4 of what's called) for, and that slight change brought it down to a good tangy level.  There was a bit too much liquid but I just stirred it a lot and it was fine.  Second time around I absolutely loved it, and this is exactly the kind of thing I like.

The TABLESPOON of salt has GOT to be a typo. Against my better judgement I followed the recipe and put in the full tablespoon of salt. It made the salad so salty I had to rinse it all off make another batch of dressing, but without any salt the second time around because of how much still remained from the first time. If you cut the salt back to either a teaspoon (or better yet, less/none, since you can always add it later), I could see this recipe rating 4-5 stars.

This was really quick, easy and very flavorful.  I made it for a potluck family reunion and it went fast!  I followed the recipe exactly and the only complaint that I have is that it made quite a bit of dressing.  I think I will lessen it next time.  It tastes better the next day after sitting in the dressing.  This is definitely a keeper!

Very good, everyone who had it liked it, but when it's out with the traditional pasta and potato salads, people tend to choose the familiar over this. I would half the vinegar and oil next time, but leave the spices the same. Also, I added tons more cilantro, and saved some to garnish. Would make again, but maybe not for a potluck.

This is the best bean salad I ever had.  The dressing is awesome it would taste great on any salad.  I did alter it a bit to my taste, I only used 1 tablespoon of sugar a little less salt and more cilantro.  I served it with champagne crackers which are very hard crackers that hold up well to the weight of the beans and dressing.  Very Very big hit at our party.

This is the freshest bean salad I've ever tasted, and I got my boyfriend hooked before he even realized there are onions in it. I chopped up everything very small so it could be eaten with tortilla chips. Wonderful side dish for taco night!

I'M ADDICTED! I just finished making this for a BBQ tomorrow and I couldn't keep my spoon out of it!  I halved the oil, vinegar and a little more than half the sugar but kept the rest the same, as per other reviews. I am going to make this dressing for ALL my salads. Thank you SO much!

Unfortunately, I didn't like this recipe.  I followed the recipe as-is, but the combination of the bell pepper and vinegar was too overbearing for my palate.  I think that this recipe would be great with a lime marinade instead.  I do plan on making this again without the bell pepper and vinegar.

I really enjoyed this salad. I used a large can of garbanzo beans instead of the cannelli beans & added chopped fresh tomatoes. I brought it to a Mexican themed party where there was lots of food & I had quite a bit left over which I am enjoying at home. I don't like spicy foods, & even though this is Mexican, the seasonings are "just right" IMHO.

This is the perfect recipe--easy to make, hard to mess up, delicious. I didn't follow it exactly (used fewer beans, more garlic, different kind of vinegar, etc.), but it was great. I noticed some other reviewers thought there was too much dressing. Since I didn't use all 3 cans of beans I reduced the dressing ingredients a bit. There was still a lot of dressing, but I didn't think it was too much--that's where the flavor is!

This week will be the 3rd time in 3 weeks I've made this salad.  It is outstanding.  Made it for work and for where I volunteer.  A lot of complements received for a bean salad.  Second time I cut the oil and vinegar in half but left everything else the same and it was even better.  I'll add a little more spice with the tabasco this time around.  Highly recommend!

Awesome salad. I cut the amount of the olive oil and red wine vinegar in half. Also used a slightly rounded TBS of sugar. We only ate 1/2 of the salad the first night, but that was fine because reviewers said it was even better the next day. They weren't kidding! Next day I wrapped some in a warm tortilla with a little sharp cheddar. Sooo good!! My idea of comfort food :)

A new favorite. We loved this at my house. I used garbonzos instead of cannelinis (a personal preference), but did everything else exactly to the recipe. It will make great leftovers!

This has quickly become a favorite. I have made it three times, and I receive numerous requests for the recipe. It is great at potlucks and with barbecue. Not only does it contain the perfect combination of flavors, but it is attractive with all its colors, too.

Delicious! I usually swap out the vinegar for apple cider vinegar and I use any beans I have (typically black beans, hominy, corn etc). You can use this as a dip for chips, topping on a salad or just as a delicious side.

I made this recipe (almost) exactly as written, with the exception of simply salting to taste. I must say, the marinade was delicious. The "salad" was very light, crisp, and refreshing. Personally, I think next time I will omit the onions and peppers, and I think I might add queso fresco instead. I usually don't mind raw onions and peppers, I just felt like there was too much "crunch" going on.

So easy and very healthy!  I served it over warm rice and it was very filling! I followed other suggestions and cut back by 1/2 the dressing, which was a good suggestion. Next time I will only use 1/2 purple onion. The onion is a little over powering. I recently started cooking/freezing dried beans and used those. That eliminated the unnecessary sodium and preservatives found in the canned beans.

This may be the best salad I've ever eaten!  I followed the recipe with the following changes:  used canned corn instead of frozen, 1 tbsp. Splenda instead of 2tbsp sugar, added extra cilantro, and added a can of drained, diced, fire-roasted tomatoes with garlic.  I made the recommended amount of dressing - I think you need all of it for the dish.  This will definitely become a family favorite!

Just great. A wonderful side dish. I had this with Mexican rice and enchiladas and my friends were so pleased. I didn't have cannellini beans-sub. great northern beans and it was very tasty. I wouldn't change a thing.

Took to a party and had several guests ask if they could have the little bit that was left.  Great recipe thanks.  Only thing I changed was used chick peas in place of cannelli beans.

This is a wonderful summer salad to take to a picnic.  It makes a great side for dinner or an awesome hearty lunch. I made it exactly like the recipe states the first time and loved it.  The next time I tweaked it a bit for my family's tastes and liked it even more.  Here is what I did:  used all lime juice instead of the lemon/lime combo, used two ears of fresh corn cut from the cob instead of the frozen corn, substituted 2 Tlbs. honey for the sugar, added one finely chopped jalapeno pepper and used Chipotle chile pepper instead of regular chile pepper.  It's a bit spicier than the original, but we like spicy foods in our house.  Enjoy!

Everyone LOVED this salad on Super Bowl Sunday.  Friday night I tossed it together for the occasion on Sunday at friends.  I always make recipes "as written" the first time.  Sunday morning I tasted it and it was heavenly.  Then, because of my love of cilantro, I added additional and more hot sauce.  Next time I think I will add a jalapeno or two since I like spice, as well as a couple stalks of celery.  Not only is this a beautiful salad, but quite easy to put together, healthy, and most gratifying to the tastebuds.  Thank you for posting; I will make it again for certain!

Delicious, with some changes of course. Way too much liquid! I doubled the recipe, including the liquid. I could have doubled the salad ingredients, and not the dressing ingredients, and it would have been perfect. I cut the sugar in half and it was fine. I mixed up the beans, added some chick peas. The dressing makes this dish. I served it at a party of about 125 people. Many people asked for the recipe.

Followed the recipe to the letter and was very happy with the way this turned out.  I did give this a pretty healthy shot of hot sauce, but we like it spicy.

My husband liked eating this with tortilla chips. My kids didn't like it. I thought the initial taste was too strong, but the beans neutralized it nicely. Unfortunately, I need meals my whole family will eat and this one won't do.

Amazing!  I have yet to serve this to anyone who didn't like it.  It's perfect as written.  I've used the leftovers for taco salad...just throw in some ground beef and serve over lettuce.  You don't even need dressing!

This is a really refreshing summer salad. I found that you really only need to make 1/2 the amount of dressing that the recipe requires. Also I eliminated the corn and used part of an orange and yellow pepper to add more color to the salad.

I made this for a barbecue and it turned out pretty good.  However, like one other person said, it tastes better the next day.  And tastes awesome over a bed of couscous!  I also halved all the dressing ingredients and it still tasted good.

This recipe is FANTASTIC!  I've been making it for parties & picnics for the last 5 years.  It always gets rave reviews and I always get requests to share the recipe.  I also include garbanzo beans, substitute canned corn for frozen and a couple Tbs. of honey for sugar.  I also try to get half of the canned beans with low salt or no salt added.  Very fresh tasting, flavorful salad!

This was tasty! A nice salad for a hot summer day. I halved the recipe and it still made quite a bit. The only changes I made were that I left out the cilantro because I didn't have any, left out the pepper because I hate it, and left out the hot pepper sauce because I don't like spicy. Thanks for a great recipe!! Went great with the tri tip I made :)

I have been a member of AR for 10 years now and  have probably made hundreds of recipes from this site by now. I have to say... this one is right up at the top of my favorites!! I cant' say enough great things about it. I will definitely cut the dressing in half next time. It has amazing flavor, but its way too much for me. I like to eat it with tortilla chips as well as a salad.

SO yummy!  I just made it for dinner and my little "samples" I'm tasting are delicious!  I can't wait to make this for a picnic or pot luck.  Yum - I'm serving it with garlic lime chicken from this sight too.  Thanks!

Excellent bean salad.  I used great white northern beans instead of cannellini beans and they worked fine.  There was too much dressing, though, so I'll probably use half the amount of oil and vinegar next time.  And there definitely will be a next time.  Thanks for posting.

I tweaked it here and there....only added black, kidney, and garbonzo beans. I used most of the spices and it turned out delicious for wraps.

I made this to serve alongside of homemade enchiladas and it took the spotlight!  Not only was it so colorful, but the freshness and flavor was outstanding.  I made this ahead of time and let the flavors really infuse/marinate with the rest of the ingredients.  There was sweetness, zest and the perfect amount of spice that wasn't too overbearing but didn't bore my tastebuds.  I can't help but say that this is one of my new favorites - AND IT'S SO EASY!!  My two children (one beside me helping me with this review!!) LOVED this.  This will now be made and brought to all of my get togethers.

This is fantastic.  Rarely do I follow a recipe to a T, but after multiple goes with this salad, I still follow it (only exception I have sometimes used pinto beans in lieu of the cannellini beans).  The dressing makes everything taste so fresh, and the lime juice nad fresh cilantro make the whole salad seem lighter than you would think.

This is a real winner. Extremely flavourful. I've made this a few times for parties and people love it and consistently ask for the recipe. This is also a great healthy choice.

This is the second time I've made this wonderful salad.  I'm usually counting calories so I made it calorie friendly. I only put in 1 Tablespoon of olive oil, left out the cannellini beans and substitued a whole can of green beans, only 3 ounces of fresh corn and 1/2 cut chopped celery.

I love this recipe and make it often and always get rave reviews. I love how it looks with all the different colors. I have never added the cumin, pepper, chili powder or pepper sauce and I think it's delicious this way.  I rarely use limes, and I am ashamed to admit I never knew until my sister in law told me, that you should slice up the inside of a lime to get more juice. I once went through about 5 limes. So hanging my head in shame, but maybe I'll spare someone my lime problem.

This was FANTASTIC, everything I expected with tons of flavour!  I swapped out the cannellini beans for chickpeas, added a full jalapeno for extra spice and left out the cilantro as we really dislike it.  I used chipotle chili powder and cut the sugar back to 1 TBSP.  Super yummy, will make this again for sure as this type of salad is a fave for us!

I love bean salad, but was unsure about this recipe because some of the ingredients seemed a little strange. I did not have a green pepper, so I used more of the red pepper, used some dry cilantro in place of all the fresh, and used white vinegar because I was out of red wine vinegar. I also omitted the hot sauce because my family is not really appreciative of spicy food! I was surprised at how delicious this salad was; my family loved eating it with chips like salsa! I will definately make this salad again; the only problem I had with it was the amount of oil. I will cut it at least in half, maybe more, as it made the salad very "greasy."

Made a few changes. Halved the recipe and used 1 can of black beans and 1 can pinto beans only. Everything else just halved. This is an AWESOME recipe. Will use this one for years to come. Thank you so much!

This was a great a definate keeper!  I reduced the olive oil and vinegar to 1/4 cup each and the salt to 1 teaspoon.  For a bit more of a kick I added 1 chopped serano chili.

This salad was great, my whole family loved it. It makes a lot! i subed chickpeas for the cannellini beans and balsamic vinegar, which was a little intense. I am going to do the red wine vinegar next time.

I made this salad up the night before a potluck so it was ready to go the next day.  It is easy to make even though there are alot of ingredients.  I brought tortilla chips with it and everyone was eating it as a salsa.  I added extra cumin and cilantro and used less salt.  I didn't have a red onion so I used green onions instead. Everyone said they really enjoyed it and there were no leftovers so it must be true.

Excellent bean salad! I left out the cilantro, as my husband and I really don't care for it, but it was still delicious. Even better after a couple days in the fridge. I bring a small container to work for that afternoon snack craving. Good and nutritious!

Do Not Be Discouraged by the long list of ingredients!  I whipped this up last minute and didn't have the kidney or cannellini beans, red or white vinegar or cilantro.  Somehow with all the rest of the ingredients it still made a great combination.  Served on a bed of Romaine lettuce and it's a delicious & easy salad.

This dish is delicious! It takes some time to chop everything needed, but it was fun and the results were worth it. It's a colorful dish that was a big hit at yesterday's 4th of July BBQ. I packed the leftovers and added some chicken and I can't wait to eat it for lunch. I even used the olive oil dressing as a marinade. Wonderful dish!

This salad is full of flavor, very colorful and is a wonderful alternative to the traditional salads you find at Bar-B-Qs.  This recipe makes a generous amount making it a good dish for large crowds.  I made it for a cookout and everyone really liked it.  I'll definitely make this dish again!

I made this for my son's birthday party.
Every adult there asked me for the recipe.
I think this is the best bean salad I've 
ever tasted.  I made a double recipe so 
there was a bit of chopping involved but 
well worth the time!  You won't be disapointed!
Didn't notice any kids eating it but they were
3 to 5 year olds.

Most amazing salad! A keeper! I might like it better if I reduced the dressing by 1/3 or 1/2, since it creates a pool in the bottom of the serving dish that must be constantly re-mixed in and seems to add a lot of liquid to each bite.  Otherwise, so fresh, tasty, and the perfect combination of flavors. The cumin is a great touch - thanks!

Love the recipe. I followed it exactly but I did not have cumin when I first assembled it. I put it in the next day and a good salad became great.  Fresh Cilantro and the yellow whole corn kernels frozen are also important.  The smaller white corn or canned corn would not work as well.  I get one tablespoon of fresh lime juice from half a lime.  In contrast the lemon yields half the juice.   A really fun recipe that works well in the summer as a side dish for picnics because it does not have dairy or egg products in it.

I've been using this site for many years, this is my first review that I felt I HAD to share.  This was so delicious, and I followed the recipe to the T.  But the best part is this: it made so much and I didn't want it to go to waste, so last night I used it in chili.  OH MY GOODNESS, I've made many many pots of chili, this is by far the best I've ever had!!  I had about 1/2 this recipe left, mixed in 2 lbs ground beef, a can of black beans (it's the only can I had in my pantry), 2 cans of diced tomatoes, threw in a bit more chili powder and cumin.  I'm not sure it matters what beans or additional whatever you throw in, the flavor from this salad just made me wanna cry my chili was so good! Thank you Karen for a superb salad, that can be used with versatility.  Imagine it in a burrito, an enchilada, sky's the limit!

I made the recipe exactly like it said (something I never do, lol) even though I had some trepidation because it called for 1 tablespoon salt and 2 tablespoons sugar but it was good. VERY GOOD. I made it two days ahead and let the spices really work their magic. I took it to a Church event and it got rave reviews and I was asked for the recipe.

I cut the oil and vinegar in half and found a lot of dressing still floating at the bottom, so I definitely recommend cutting the dressing down!  However, everything else about the salad is well balanced and delicious -- a great way to enjoy beans!  I recommend using fresh lemon and lime juice, I used bottle lemon, and I can taste the "strange" in the dish.

YUM!  Everyone loves this recipe.  I add avocado's and tomatoes however.  A tip when you add the avocado is to keep the pits in the actual "salad" mix to avoid them turning brown and yucky.  It works!  Enjoy!

Family and friends keep asking me to make this salad over and over again.  It's flavorful and refreshing.  I use a whole bunch of cilantro, and balsamic vinegar for the dressing, which adds an interesting twist. 
It gets even better when it sits for a few days.  I serve it as a dinner side dish or with tortilla chips at parties.

Delicious, healthy, and easily adjusted for individual tastes.  I added more chili powder since I like things spicy, and left out the cilantro because I didn't have any on hand but other than that I stuck with the recipe.  This made more than 8 servings for me, but I dont mind having the leftovers because I'm pretty sure it will taste even better after sitting in the fridge overnight.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Wow.  I made this Thursday and we had some for dinner; it was for Saturdays' BBQ.
We love it, and many at the party raved.
I did add a little more lemon/lime juice because I tasted too much Red Wine vinegar.  Also I doubled the beans.
There is enough left over for me to take for lunch (with the addition of some leftover Black-Eyed Peas.)

This has become a staple in our house during the summer. It is delicious from the first day and for many more after that. I add extra corn - 2 cans rather than the frozen and just a little less vinegar. I add mint as well. You cannot go wrong with this!

I followed the recipe exactly and this was amazing!  I served with corn tortillas brushed with butter, cut into 1/4's and baked on 400 degrees for 5-7 mins.  These are even better the next day warmed up in a burrito with cheddar cheese!!!

Out of this world!  Brought it to a Memorial Day picnic - everyone brought food - but this was a big hit.  Had several requests for the recipe.  Minimum work for maximum flavor results!  I did cut the sugar to half the specified amount.  I made one half with the cilantro and the other with no cilantro, since some people really hate it.  Thanks for a keeper!

Wonderful!  Very refreshing on a warm day and great with chicken.  Make sure it is chilled well. It would also taste great to take it up a notch in heat-maybe a chpd. jalepeno or pepper of your choice, but not too much so as to not crowd out the delicate flavor of the beans. Beautiful as well. Love the color and texture. Make sure to serve it in a clear bowl to show it off.

Easy to make and a very colorful salad.  Did as others suggested and cut olive oil and vinegar in half.  Left rest of seasonings as is except increased cumin and chili powder for more zip.  Was plenty of dressing for the salad.  Makes a large bowl full.

Great side dish!  I agree that the amount of dressing can be cut a bit (1/4-1/3 c. of oil and vinegar).  Thanks for sharing this yummy recipe!

the combination of ingredients in the dressing for the salad are not appealing to me at all.  however, i'm giving it 3 stars because my husband and 1-year-old son really enjoyed this salad.

Wow - so, I completely forgot the lemon and lime juice, and only had red bell peppers, and was missing the can of kidney beans, and only had dried cilantro -- and this was still amazing!  Great recipe (I'll have to try it again next time using actually all the ingredients!).

6/24/12:  Made this again (forgot I'd made it before) and even the 4-year-old loved it. Wow.  Great recipe.

A most fresh and excellent bean salad. My husband, who normally does not like bean salad, loves this one. The only change I make is to reduce the olive oil and red wine vinegar each to 1/3 of a cup instead of 1/2 cup.  As the recipe is written, there is too much sauce. But make that one small change, and it is perfect.

I love this salad because it keeps well, I take it for my lunch to work everyday, and also makes an easy, healthy snack to eat right out of the fridge.

A MUST - will make this forever. Thank you for posting!

Perfect the way it is! I've made it twice now, and on the second try I added a LOT more cilantro (to my taste) and extra chili powder for a kick. 
It does taste better after a day, when the flavors have a chance to meld, so if you have time make it the day before. It's still great if it's fresh.
I think the amount of oil and red wine vinegar is just fine. I used frozen corn since it has better texture than canned and chills the recipe if you make it just before the event--you don't need to thaw the corn at all.
There's a good amount of chopping involved which I actually enjoy, you could use a kitchen chopper gadget if you don't. I don't find it labor intensive at all, I'm not sure why some people do-- they must not cook fresh much.
Someone suggested adding cucumber which sounds great, I'll try next time.
Oh, and I find that using whole cumin and grinding it up just before you make it also adds to the awesomenocity of this recipe. It's a keeper!

presentation is very pretty when first made. But there is way to much olive oil and salt in recipe. I made it yesterday and when ypu scoop some out there is thickened oil globed all on the spoon. All the veggies are very pretty and a good mix but I will come up with a much better red wine mixture.

Awesome! I have made this numerous times now (minus the hot pepper sauce, as I don't have any). Most recently I made it for Thanksgiving and it received the most complements of any dish. This is a great recipe.

I had never made this before but was invited to a Mexican dinner with friends & was asked to bring something.  Being brave and using my friends as guinea pigs, I made it & it was a HUGE hit....  all 8 of us loved it & everyone wanted the recipe.  The only changes were that I did add more vinegar, garlic, lemon & lime juice, garlic and other seasonings to taste.  I did also add quite a bit more Tabasco as we all like things spicy...  I definately will make this again..  I loved it !!!!!

This is so light yet satisfying!  I think the dressing is a little sweet for my taste, so I cut the sugar in half.  Makes a great main dish when you throw it on a bed of spinach and add some chips, shredded cheese, and avocado.  Thanks for sharing!!

SO GOOD!!!  I don't review very often because I'm bad about changing the recipe too much, but the only change I made to this was adding a can of Rotel tomatoes (didn't have any red or green pepper and wanted that color/flavor addition).  I just tasted it without even letting the flavors meld yet and it is so flavorful :)

This recipe is sensational!  I made a double batch of it for a group picnic.  I made the mistake of making it two days ahead of time and placing it in our refrigerator.  There are three of us living in this house and in one hot summer day, 1/2 of it was eaten.  Now I need to go and get more ingredients.  This is such a great summer salad--so refreshing!  I am from Arizona, so I added a little extra chili powder, cumin and hot sauce.  I am sure that I will be making this recipe often.

Tasty.  Liked the use of three beans.  Have a similar recipes that I like a bit more.  The dressing ingredients are:  1/4 cup olive oil, 1/8 cup vinegar and 1 (dry) pkg. good seasons Italian salad dressing.  Add 2 avocados chopped.

This is an awesome bean salad! I followed the directions very closely. Only differences were: used a 1/2 and 1/2 portion of balsamic vinegar and red wine vinegar for the 1/2 cup.  Used a can of shoepeg corn which is really the best corn for bean salads. Used only 1/2 red onion. And used very small red and green peppers. Didn't use cilantro at all...this doesn't need it! Once it was all put together it did look like a lot of dressing so I added a 4th can of beans - I had cannellini on hand. It can totally handle 4 cans of beans.  YUM! YUM! Hubby said don't lose this recipe!

This is a great salad!  We can't get canned beans here most of the time so I soaked and cooked the beans myself and then weighed them to make sure I got the right proportions.  I followed the recipe exactly and I thought that it was perfect.  When I first ate it, I thought that it could use some more spice but after a day of marinading, it's perfect!  I've already shared this salad with friends.

My Secret Technique - I am a big fan of bean salads. I always spread out the rinsed beans in a large roasting pan and bake overnight at 200 F to dry them. This reduces their moisture content so that when the marinade is added, it is absorbed into the beans rather than excess moisture leaching out and watering down the dressing. Also I usually cut the oil in half and add a can of garbanzo beans.  Cheers  G.G.

It may be a little labor-intensive and requires a lot of ingredients but this bean salad is totally worth it! I've never tasted anything like it. The Mexican bean salad turned out fresh, delicious, spicy, with a nice sweet and salty tang to it.  It doesn't hurt that it is so healthy too! It keeps very well and is a perfect side and/or snack!

My husband is officially addicted to this salad. He has problems with indigestion and heart burn eating the Standard American Diet so I look for things that still taste good and satisfy but that I can stick lots of raw veggies into! Plus this is high protein! I double the recipe, add extra veggies and keep it in the fridge (in an ice cream pail)for a week at a time (the flavour gets better as it sits) so he always has it avaible to him. U can mix and match the beans for what you have on hand. His favourite is when I use all chickpeas. Change up the peppers to what you like best(he doesn't like green so I use red, yellow or orange). I have added celery and that goes well too. The only real change I made was adding extra garlic and cutting down the sugar. 2 tbs was too much for us so I just add 1 tbs sugar or 1 tbs of honey. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

Very tasty and colorful salad!  I also worked at making this a bit healthier, adding no sugar, less oil, and no added salt - I used 50% reduced sodium beans as well!  Since I had used up the rest of my red wine vinegar, I substituted about 1/3 cup of tarragon vinegar, and found it added interesting flavor. We added a touch more hot sauce at serving time just for added zing!

Excellent! I followed it almost exactly with fantastic results. I only made 2 changes: 1.)using two bell peppers seemed excessive, so I just used one large red bell pepper and one Hungarian hot. And, 2.)instead of just a dash of hot sauce, I used about 1 teaspoon. (Here's a personal tip for you... if you can find "Crystal" brand hot sauce at your grocery, buy it. I first heard about it through Emeril Lagasse many years ago; he said he preferred it. I whole-heartedly agree! It has nice heat to it but with a ton of flavor as well. I used to buy "Tabasco" but now I've completely converted to "Crystal"). Be sure to let this sit over night in the fridge to allow all the flavors to soak in and then drain off most of the liquid before serving. It's good with tortilla chips or just by itself. Also, this is a great dish to bring to outdoor summer get togethers as it has no mayo and can sit out for a long time without spoiling.

Really good! Could also pass as a salsa; great served with chips. Do not use the whole amount of dressing, it is way too much. You only need half or 3/4 of the amount so start by adding a little at a time.

Love this recipe. Eat it as a salad one day and a dip with tortilla chips the next. I didn't want my salad to be Mexican so I left out the cumin and hot spices and sauce. It was very good that way. The next day I ate it as a dip and added the seasonings to make it Mexican. I only added one bell pepper. Colorful and delicious!

This is a very good and nutritious recipe, however, I would recommend to anyone making it for the first time to add less red wine vinegar; I think the dressing has the potential to be great, but to me, all I really tasted was the vinegar. Since this is a "mexican" salad, I guess I would've liked to taste more of the cumin/chili pepper flavor. I definitely will be making this again, though I will be cutting back on the "tanginess" factor.

I was disappointed because this recipe received so many good reviews. I didn't like the dressing and followed the recipe exactly. I liked, however, the combination of beans,corn, peppers, and onions. I will make it again but perhaps with some Newman's Italian dressing.

This was amazing!  I served it at a party and people werre going back for thirds.  The only thing I changed was adding a little extra sugar to the dressing.  I will be making this again and trying it inside a taco w/ some avacado.  Great recipe!

YUMMO! Really quick and easy and YUMMY for days and days. There was lots of liquid left the next day so I might lighten up and not add all the dressing next time.

I am eating this for lunch right now and it's incredible.  As per other reviews, 1/4 cup each of olive oil and vinegar is plenty!  I omitted the salt due the dietary reasons and added more cilantro because I love it.  This salad is so bright and fresh-tasting... a winner!

This was very, very good.  I followed the advice of others and used only half the olive oil and red wine vinegar.  It turned out perfect, and as others have said, it got even better after it sat a while.  The dressing especially is just wonderful!

This was very good. It didn't taste 'mexican' until you add more cumin, chili powder, and cilantro.  Great for picnics or potlucks.  Very good without the mexican spices too.

Nice mix of flavours but it makes a huge salad, we will be eating this for days.  There is quite a lot of liquid in the bottom of the salad, I guess you would call it the marinade but if I was serving it at a party I would drain the liquid just before putting it in the presentation dish.

This was very good. It was first Mexican type bean salad I have made and only substitution I made was the fresh chives from my pot vs onion as I can not eat raw onion. I also rinsed all the beans.  The next time I will thaw the corn as I thought it watered down the dressing as it thawed in salad. This is a keeper.

This recipe is FANTASTIC and has become a staple in my home, both for get-togethers or just "us." I serve it in the summer, spring, fall and winter and it is truly a dish for all occasions. I'm only sorry that 5 stars are as high as the rating goes!! Thank you sooo much for this recipe.

It gets better everyday that passes.  Maybe making the dressing ahead of time would help speed the tastiness but not speed the expiration of the veggies and beans?

A fantastic recipe.  I did a lot of substituting but the dressing itself is super!  I reduced the oil and vinegar down to 1/4c and still had too much dressing.  Next time, will reduce more.  I also only added 1tblspn of sugar and also cut down the salt by 1/2.  I also added a dash of dijon mustard which really brought out the flavours.  The cumin and cilantro are a wonderful combination. I like that you can add anything to the salad - I put in zucchini and green/yellow beans! YUM!

Thsi was the BEST bean salad I have ever had!! My family loved it, the recipe does make a large quantity, it disappeared over the course of the weekend!  I couldn't find cannellini beans, so I substituted with chick peas, I put canned corn kernels  and not frozen, and I substituted red wine vinegar for balsamic vinegar as that's all I had and all I can is 'WOW'!! Fantastic, this is a keeper and I'll make it again and again!

This received rave reviews.  I cut the olive oil back to 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup water.  I also used S&W's chili beans with chipotle instead of kidney beans and used the new tabasco smoked chipotle pepper sauce.  It turned out great, I even had some of my hispanic friends asking for the recipe!

Great salad!! Tried to make it just as printed, but when someone mentioned adding black olives I couldn't resist (one of my weaknesses). And I did do just 1-Tbsp sugar but to make up I used 2 garlic cloves!! Your combo of ingredients made a super salad!...but OLIVES....yes, yes, yes!! Thanks for the recipe Karen.

I cut some of the ingredience down - the sugar to 1 tablespoon (and still thought it was too sugary)the salt to a teaspoon and the oil to 1/3 cup (which I will reduce to 1/4 next time - save the calories - it doesn't need all that oil).  I will also cut down on the vinegar next time.  Then I added diced tomatoes and avocado.  My friends enjoyed the results.

Excellent smoky and sweet salad. Friends have requested the recipe and said it was filling and flavorful. I didn't buy the red so used 1/2 of a large sweet onion instead. Keeps well in fridg for a week or so.

A great meal to make in advance and eat later - the "chilling" step is essential if you want the flavours to properly blend.

A few changes: I substituted chickpeas for the cannellini beans, sliced my red onion into thin rings instead of chopped pieces, and halved the dressing. I also reduced the quantity of sugar to 1/4 teaspoon because I prefer my salad dressings tart.

Made this for a New Years Eve party, with Mexican food as a theme.  Tasty and would make again, but would not add as much sugar - way too sweet and I didn't even add 1/2 the sugar.  Also, as other reviewers have noted, there is way too much dressing.  When I put the leftovers away I had to drain about 1/3 of the dressing so it wouldn't get soggy.

This salad was really tasty, but if I make it again, I will use less oil. It really doesn't need as much dressing as the recipe directs you to make.

I got so many compliments on this recipe!  I even got praised on it from some very harsh critics so I know it was good.  It is fresh, light, and colorful.  I added tomatoes and chick peas to mine and used canned corn(the fiesta kind with peppers in it).  The great thing about this recipe is you can add or delete ingredients according to your own tastes.  Great recipe!

This is a great side dish for summer, and so easy to make.  It has such a clean, fresh taste.  I can't think of any way that I'd change the recipe! Very yummy!!

I used fire roasted red peppers and diced green chilies instead of the green & red pepper.  I loved the taste but htere was too much dressing.  It was pretty soupy even after I added an additional can of beans.

This is a very good bean salad.  I will definitely make it again.  I added a can of garbonzo beans and a 2nd can of kidney beans. It may be a little spicey for small children but certainly a hit with everyone else.

Let it sit in the refer and blend for at least an hour.  It was the hit of the 4th of July party - even for those people that normally aren't too wild about bean salads!

Stupid simple. Follow the recipe and it's very good. Doctor to your heart's delight. Consider doubling (or tripling) the garlic and/or cilantro. A splash of good tequila and a lot more hot sauce to suit your taste. Make it the night before so the flavors can really blend. So many possibilities with this. I'm thinking smoked paprika and balsamic vinegar for the next time. A great chilled side for a 100+ degree Texas cookout.

I had soooooo many compliments on this salad when I served it at a luncheon and had people asking for the recipe. I didn't have sugar and substituted honey instead and I didn't have enough red wine vinegar and used some cider vinegar to make up the difference. I also made it the day before and stirred it a couple of times to ensure that the flavors all melded well. I'm making it for the second time now.

I made this for a salad luncheon.  I received compliments on the dish.  However, for my family next time I'll increase the cumin slightly, and increase the chili powder or add hot sauce or jalapeno salt.  I agree with the suggestion to decrease oil and vinegar.  I would reduce only by 25%.  \
I will definitely make this again.

Do yourselves a favour and make this salad as written. It requires no "tweaking", no changes, no additional ingredients and no substitutions. It's simply a truly awesome salad as is. Changing anything about it makes it a different recipe. This one needs no "help".

I've made this recipe several times for family and potlucks. Love the flavor and eye appeal of the dish. I halve the vinegar and oil and only use 1 tsp salt. I use 2-3 cloves of garlic, 2 tsp chili powder, 2 tsp cumin, and at least 3 shakes of hot sauce. I've used both canned and frozen corn and am happy with both. Additionally, I add 1 can of garbanzo beans.

Wonderful recipe! It is fun and easy to play around with depending on your preferences. I didn't use chili pepper or hot sauce. I added mango pieces, cranberries, and raisins. I also halved the vinegar (I used white) and oil based on other reviews. I substituted stevia for the sugar.

This is my go to get together salad - I have made it at least 20 times, and every time I get asked for the recipe and send people home with leftovers.  I make it the night before the party, so it has time to let the flavors soak in.  Only modifications I have made, adding an extra can of chick peas, as there is too much dressing in my opinion, using two red (or yellow or orange) peppers instead of using green, and I omit the hot pepper sauce and chili powder most of the time - I can't take the spice anymore!  This is a top recipe!

Delicious variation of a three bean salad.  Love the spice and kick in this side dish. It is a HUGE recipe and doesn't keep well for more than 24 hours.  But, for a big party, this is perfect -- it's tasty and presents beautifully.

I made this last night for a football party this evening. I took a taste and the dressing is SO tasty!  I followed the recipe almost completely.  Like other reviewers suggested, I halved the oil, vinegar and sugar, and I added a few extra "dashes" of Franks hot sauce. I didn't measure the minced cilantro, but once it filled a handful, I figured that was a good amount. Next time, and there WILL be a next time, I think I will add some chopped cucumber, a small amount of tomato and even maybe some celery or carrots for more crunch.

The liquid/marinade quantity was fine (extra to keep it moist and flavorful). Better 2nd or 3rd day - so make ahead. Jicima adds a nice crunch and sweetness (my 3 yr old's favorite part of this salad).

I made this for a veggie/vegan potluck and it was a huge hit. The potluck was outside in 104 degree heat and I was looking for something that would hold up - this did perfectly.  People really kept complimenting the dressing - I would have just used bottled dressing but I'm glad I didn't after the comments (it's sweet and tangy - I couldn't really taste any one ingredient I put in, just a great result). I followed the recipe pretty closely but it's very forgiving. Add an orange pepper for even more great color. The second batch I made and refrigerated overnight was even better.

Salt takes water out of veggies like bell peppers so maybe this is where all the extra liquid is coming from??? because the amount of dressing was perfect for my salad. I put all the beans, veggies, and corn in the salad spinner and patted with paper towels to make sure they were extra dry before topping with the dressing. I emulsified the olive oil with the vinegar and herbs/spices and did not have oil issues. Added jalapenos, dashes of Worcestershire sauce, 1tsp smoked paprika, 1/2 tsp celery seed, ACCENT, 4 TBSP of balsamic vinegar, 1 T oregano, fresh parsley, used Mexican Chile Powder and used Tabasco as the hot sauce This dish is wonderful!!  My husband who normally does not like beans couldn't stop eating it.....but I have plenty to take to a work carry-in tomorrow. (I HOPE)  I love, love, LOVE the dressing!

Good salad... but I probably won't make it again, at least not per the recipe because of the volume.  I would need to cut the volume to a third and would just use one can of beans, which would not be as good, of course.

Yummy! Just made this and it is now chilling in the fridge but I HAD to sneak a taste.  So good, I can't wait to taste it tomorrow once all the flavors mingle.  The only thing I did different was adding lime and lemon zest, like other reviewers, and cutting the salt in half (I have a hard time putting a full tablespoon in anything on the first go).  Thanks for the recipe!

All the reviews are correct. I made this twice and it was a huge hit ... and I'm not known as a good cook. It is easy to make. I let it sit in the dressing about 2 days before serving. I also substituted green onions and people still really liked it.

I loved this!! Thank you for this great recipe! After reading several comments, I decided to just try less oil/vinegar and went with 1/4 cup of each, but kept everything else the same - YUM!

This is an excellent, crowd pleasing side dish. Many of our summer guests have asked for the recipe. It's perfect for a BBQ or party and I love that the dish is colorful as well. The only modification I made was only using about half of the dressing.

Absolutely fantastic! I can't wait to take it to a potluck! I do recommend reducing the salt by at least half and then working it up to your taste, especially since a lot of canned beans have a good amount of sodium already.

This was a hit. The only change I made was to add a small can of sliced black olives. I would also try adding diced cucumbers to this for a watery crunch. I will definitely be making this again!

This was so tasty!  My husband's only critical comment was that it was a little oniony tasting and he was worried what it did to his breath!  So we reserve it for dinner time only :-)

This was absolutely delicious.  The dressing was so fresh.  I made this the day before and stored it in the frig in a large ziploc overnite.  I used a red and orange pepper because our friends can't eat green pepper.  I also omitted the cilantro as hubby doesn't like it but the rest was done as written and got RAVE reviews at our mexican fiesta superbowl party.  Served this with the crockpot Carnitas recipe and Mexican Rice II both from Allrecipes.  Everyone raved and wanted recipes!

There is way too much salt in this recipe; I cut it down to 1 teaspoon rather than a tablespoon.  Also, the oil is unnecessary extra calories and can be reduced or omitted without disrupting the deliciousness.  I loved this salad served over a bed of greens, such as shredded romaine or spinach.

Absolutely delicious!  Perfect as is, but I also heated it and rolled it in flour tortillas for vegan tacos. I had a very little bit left over, so I decided to add some cold cooked pasta and it made a fabulous mexican pasta salad.

This is very good. I make a simplified version of it every week (using just sugar and apple cider for the dressing). I like to saute the corn in olive oil with the garlic and chili powder before I add it to the beans. It's also quite good with some diced tomatoes added in. If you use dried beans the dish becomes much cheaper to make!

This was very tasty and got rave reviews.  I made it as the recipe calls except I used bottled key lime and lemon juice.  I found the dressing to be the right amount.  I would make this again for sure and wouldn't change a thing.  I thought this recipe was great and looked great, too, on the plate!  Can serve this as a side with so many things.  This is a keeper for sure.

I thought this was great! I agree there may be a little too much dressing so may try to adjust for that next time. Used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar like some reviewers suggested and was glad I did. I only used one pepper because I do not really care much for peppers, and will probably use canned corn next time- the frozen corn seemed to have a bad texture for some reason. Overall I loved this and will definitely make it again.

Love this, great as a dip with tortilla chips.  Full of flavor.  I typically omit the corn as I don't have on hand.

This is an incredibly versatile recipe.  The first time I made it, the only change I made was to halve the oil and vinegar.  Wonderful!  Yesterday I went to make it with balsamic vinegar; I also used only black beans and sweet white onion instead of red.  It was nearly as pretty, but still tasted great!  From now on, I'm only using balsamic vinegar when I make this dish -- which will be often.  Thanks, Karen for sharing this.

Fantastic! I used garbonzo beans and added olives because I had them in my pantry already. Everyone in the family loved it and it tastes even better two days later!

A great and healthy side dish. I suggest only 1 teaspoon of salt. I served it with the Fiesta Chicken and Black Bean Enchiladas, which is a regular at our house!

I absolutely loved this.  I was cooking for a large group of people (about 15).  I took the risk and made this...  Wow!  It was a crowd pleaser.  It is also packed with a ton of protein for the vegetarian in us!

I made this for my husbands 50th Birthday Pig Roast.  I doubled the recipe and served it alone, however, many of the guests used it as a dip for chips.  Very colorful!

AMAZING!!I just became a vegan and this was so incredible even my husband who is not a vegan LOVED it. It was so great we ate it for lunch, a snack and for dinner. I did only have 1/4 a cup of red wine vinegar so i used that and then 1/4 of white wine vinegar, i didn't have lime juice either but it still turned out great!!! : ) Thank you for the wonderful recipe.

Healthy, easy, AND delicious - you can't beat that!  I made it as written the first time.  The second time I omitted the sugar and added tomato.  It's good either way.  The beans and corn make a complete protein, so my family (hubby and 5 year old) eat it as a main dish.  I also brought it to a cookout as a side.  YUM!

This was magnificent! My tweaks: 1 heaping tablespoon diced jalapeno peppers (Mt. Olive brand, they come in a jar pre-diced), 1/3 c. finely chopped cilantro (we love cilantro), 2 dashes of hot sauce and 1 teaspoon of chili powder. The bonus is that it tastes even better the second day so this is for sure a make-ahead dish. I used it for a party and everybody loved it, in fact I had to pass out the recipe and now it's moving on to other families as well! This is going to be my new standard summer pot luck dish.

I added chopped avocado and minced jalapeño pepper and served it with tortilla chips as a dip.  We decided this was a better than eating it as a salad.

Since I don't care for cannellini beans, I used a whole can of blacks & kidney beans. I did use less olive oil & red wine vinegar (1/8c) since it seemed so moist already.  I will use more chili powder next time since we like more spice. I let sit overnight & will definitely make again.

I just made this bean salad and it is absolutely fantastic!!!!  The dressing is what really makes it.  Personally, I don't like too much olive oil so I used only 1/2 of what the recipe calls for (next time I may even use less...but that is my personal preference.  I also but back the sugar 1 tbs. and was quite generous with the hot sauce (4 shakes of the bottle). I will probably use this dressing for regular salad as well.     I can't wait to have a BBQ so I can make it for my family & friends!

This bean salad was delicious and simple.  I made it the night before so that I could let the flavors mesh, and it was worth it.  I only added 1 Tbsp of sugar and the salt to taste.  I didn't add the hot sauce to keep it kid friendly.  Will be making this all summer!

This is a delicious and easy dish to make.  It's also a nice change of pace for picnics and potlucks from potato and macaroni salads.  I doubled everything except the sauce and was very satisfied with the ratio.

This salad was delicious, but the recipe makes a LOT of dressing for just three cans of beans.  I doubled the beans (but not the dressing amounts) and left out the peppers (personal preference) and it was absolutely perfect.

Fab!  The lemon & lime + cilantro flavors are amazing.  I used frozen peppers, 2 T. red onion, and half the amts. for the sugar, salt, oil, vinegar.  Perfect amt. of dressing & wonderful flavors.

My husband and I like this salad a lot , but I thought it uses too much salt. I personally like to use dry beans and cook them myself. I used a high quality balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar, so next time I am not only going to cut down on salt but sugar too.

I'm crazy about this salad!  I make it to bring to potlucks, school lunches, etc., and I always wish I had doubled the recipe so I could dig in right then and there.  (I'm doubling it next time!)

Very Tasty, although I agree with another member...too much oil and vinegar. I would cut back a bit.

I just made this and it was amazing! similiar to a dish ive had in a turkish restaurant called piyaz. i did everything the recipe said except i used half the olive oil and half the red wine vingear and it was just the rght amount of dressing also 1 tbsp of sugar is fine.i left out the corn bc i was trying to replicate the turkish salad which doesnt use corn.I will make this often love it .
UPDATE--Ive also used this dressing on a "greek pasta salad"...rotini, tomato, cucumbers, fresh bell peppers, red onion, and feta...THE BEST!!!

This is exceptionally good. I love it. I ended up only using one third cup of olive oil and red wine vinegar only because I ran out of olive oil and I didnt want the measurements to be off. It can only get better if I would of added more. Love it.

Excellent! This is similar to Texas Caviar on this site. I had to make modifications based on what I had available, but mostly I was true to the recipe. I had two cans of black beans and one can of hot chili beans. Instead of buying seriously overpriced peppers I used a bag of frozen onion and peppers mix. (I thought that wouldn't be good but it was excellent. It was missing a little crunch, but worth it for the price and ease.) You MUST use fresh cilantro and plenty of lime juice. It makes a lot of salad - more than my family can eat in two or three meals. But I'll enjoy sharing with friends

Delicious! Even my roommate who is skeptical about things like this loved it.  I reduced the amount of sugar, salt and oil by about half (if not more) and used a white onion because that's all I had.  I will definitely make it again but a half batch, it makes A LOT.

I liked the recipe alot, great flavor similar to cowboy caviar...i found the recipe makes way too much...but not sure what i would do with half a can of each bean if i didn't include them-i didn't have red wine vinegar, so i used apple cider, and canned corn drained not frozen- found that half a cup of vinegar was too much vinegar, not sure if it was cause i used a diff vinegar or just too much.  I'd make again great with tortilla chips...not sure what to eat with to make a meal tho...

This recipe is awesome!  I reduced the salt by 1 teaspoon, and not quite so much pepper either, but other than that I followed the recipe.  We ate it with tortilla chips.  Love it!

Wow!  I do NOT like any kind of bean salad.  I followed this recipe exactly.  I loved it.  I took it to work and it was gone in 5 minutes.  I am making it again, this time for company.  No changes, why mess with something that is perfect.   Thanks Karen for the fabulous recipe.

I am Over the Moon with this salad. So much flavor , color and fiber!!! How much better can it get! I used canned corn from Trader joe. I more than doubled the garlic. I was heavy handed with the cilantro, I used 1Tbsp.of sugar and 1 Tblsp. of Splenda. I used 3/4 th of the dressing. Now I need someone to prevent me from going to the fridge to just sample a little bit

Yes, this salad IS really worth all the stars. It's easy to make, uses easy ingredients, and TASTES. AWESOME. We didn't change anything except for using minced garlic instead of crushed. I wouldn't change a thing, it's perfect. 

HOWEVER!! The inclusion of a minced Serrano chile (added at the party), was VERY nice, for those who like heat. I imagine adding some green chiles would be a nice addition also (for much less heat). As I'm always thinking of healthier ways to fix things, I think you could easily sub some (or all) of the oil with extra lemon/lime juice, and I don't see why you couldn't replace the sugar with agave nectar - I'll try it out next time and review again :)  Don't skip over this recipe. It's a winner, and SO VERY MUCH a keeper!

This salad is delicious.  I made it Saturday and it was super after refrigerating only 20 minutes.  Had a bowl on Sunday and brought it for work on Monday.  It has gotten progressively better each day.  Used Great Northern Beans in place of the Cannellini beans.  Added everything as directed.  I'm hoping there will be some tomorrow too so I can see how much better it is on day 4!

I am in love with this bean salad!  I saved my own custom version but if the original weren't so good, I would not have any --which would be a travesty. Just overwhelmingly delicious and a great way to get in fiber. Thanks a million Karen!!

LOVE this!!  have made it many times, and will continue to do so.  perfect dish to take to a party or picnic, as it can sit out. I added a fourth bean to this, a can of garbanzo beans as I had it in the pantry.  I use a heaping T. of sugar, and it's more than enough.  I use Italian parsley instead of cilantro.  this would be a great recipe to turn into just a mixed veggie salad by adding some carrots, and maybe some grilled zucchini and yellow squash.  SO SO good!!

Delish! I made this as an new/alternative side dish at my BBQ and everyone loved it. I didn't change anything but didn't really measure the ingredients either, just eye balled them. It is light and tasty and fresh. Easy to make too. I had a bunch of people ask me for the recipe as well, will deff make again!

I've been making bean salads for 30 years or so, but THIS ONE tops them all!! No ingredient is overwhelming, and although I halved the sugar per our taste, it was absolutely perfect! This is my permanent bean salad from now on!

WOW! It didn't last one day - was gobbled up. Family was eating with a spoon instead of just with chips! Definitely one of my favorites on this site

I've made this many times with different ingredients-whatever I had on hand in the pantry and/or freezer.  It's the dressing that I like and it gets better as it sits. I recommend for getting your veggies in and cleaning out the fridge.

Great!  Love fresh cilantro.  Added a cut up tomato.  Too much dressing.  Will cut oil & vinegar in half next time.  Seemed like a lot of salt so cut to 2 1/2 t.   There is so much flavor could probably put even less salt and be ok. Serves about 12.

FABULOUS!!!!  Make the day before and let it marinate overnight.  Makes a ton so be ready to use it on everything the next week.  Good as a dip too.

Very tasty salad and easily adaptable. Like many reviewers, I used half the amount of dressing in this recipe and it was more than enough. Last weekend I made a variation on this for an Italian potluck using oregano and flat leaf parsley as seasoning and it was the hit of the party! Highly recommended.

I made this according to the recipe except I used only 1/2 of a small white onion (what I had on hand). The salad was okay, but I will only make it again with changes. As many other reviewers mentioned, there is a lot of dressing. Even if you are making it for the first time I would definitely half the amount of dressing. Further, I will probably try substituting the dressing altogether--it was too vinegary for me. I really love the dressing on the "Black Bean and Couscous Salad" from this site, so I may try using that dressing instead. Also, I will continue to use only 1/2 an onion (more kid-friendly that way), and I would increase the cilantro b/c we love cilantro. Last, as other reviewers stated, it is tastier the second and third day after the flavors have had time to meld.

I thought this was great.  Granted, there are several in my family that are not cold bean salad type of people, so I did have leftovers.  Didn't add the cilantro as several family members aren't fans.  I like these make ahead recipes for parties! Gave out the recipe, so always a good sign!

This was a deliciously different salad.  I followed the recipe exactly, and didn't feel that there was too much dressing....I made it for our July 4th barbecue, and those who tried it really liked it.  The other beanphobics didn't know what they were missing!  The next day we ate it as a dip for tortilla chips, and it was even better!

I have been making this recipe for years thanks to finding it on Allrecipes, and it is by FAR one of the best party dips you could ever make.  I follow the recipe almost to a "T" (the sugar/oil/vinegar are just fine for us), and only add one more can of either light or dark kidney beans, so you have one can of each for more color.  It's a MUST to let this sit overnight to let the flavors meld.  Serve with Scoops and everyone at your party will ask for the recipe.  Increase cilantro if you like it -- I use at least half a bunch (and always use fresh, never dried. It makes all the difference.)  Be sure to use good quality olive oil (EVOO, 1st cold press).  Enjoy!!

I loved it.  I also used less oil and vinegar.  I used honey instead of sugar.  I added yellow beans.  I used mexican beans instead of kidney beans.  I added a little more hot sauce.  You really should make it at least 24 hours in advance for all the flavours in the dressing to co mingle with the beans.

This is truly a delicious, healthy and refreshing summer salad.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was wonderful as written.   Now, I didn't half the oil / vinegar because I added jicama, jalapeno, and grilled chicken.  I bet it will be even better tomorrow after being in the fridge over night. Thank you!

This was excellent.  Used pinto beans along with kidney and black and it turned out really great.  I also halved the oil and vinegar as suggested.

amazing! a word of advice, the oil and vinegar should be cut in half and the rest of the dressing ingredients should be as stated. there is just too much dressing. this recipe does make a LOT of bean salad so beware. its absolutely delicious, especially the next day! ps-i used white onions and it came out great! i may try adding mango next time!

Delicious bean salad!  I did modify the recipe a bit, and I will definitely make a few more changes next time I make it.  I added half a package of bowtie pasta to make it more filling and listened to the suggestions of other reviewers by halving the liquids, sugar, salt, pepper, and cumin.  I will definitely only use half a chopped red onion as I feel a whole onion is way too strong for the dish.  I did sub Great Northern beans for cannelini beans, but I will definitely try this with garbanzo/chickpea beans next time.  I used a can of corn instead of frozen, but I may try the frozen next time.  This dish definitely tastes better chilled the next day.  Very good!

VEEERRRRY good. I changed the cilantro for parsley as I strongly dislike the taste of cilantro. Aside from that, everything stayed the same and resulted in a wonderful bean salad. Highly recommended.

Just delicious! I had to omit the cilantro due to a recall... bummer. Green would have added an extra splash of color to this beautiful salad. I will make again and again. I did cut the oil down by 1/4 C. Thanks :-)

Terrific! Made this for our 4th barbeque-so fresh yet tasty! Skipped the corn-personal preference. Subbed pinto beans for the cannelini-have a hard time finding them here. Love the dressing-but will cut it in half next time as it does make a lot! This one will be a regular!!

Yummmm!!! This is similar to a salsa that I make but a whole lot easier! The red wine vinegar adds a wonderful flavor to this dish. This is great as a chip dip and also fabulous served over a bed of greens. This is a keeper! Instead of hot sauce, I added Hot Chili Oil (just has more heat and I don't care for the taste of tabasco) and next time I may add some fresh chopped jalapenos.

Everyone enjoyed the dish. I used 1/4 cups of oil and vinegar each. There was plenty of liquid to cover all the salad. Next time, I will decrease the salt amount to 3/4 or 1/2. Prepare the dish a night before, it will taste much better!

Changes: 1) I omitted the kidney and cannellini beans; 2) added one jar of drained salsa; 3) used 1 can of corn instead of frozen; 4) used 1/4 cup each of oil and vinegar as per other reviews; and 5) used splenda instead of sugar.  I chopped up romaine lettuce and topped it with this concoction and it was tasty!!  Something I will definitely do again.  Thanks!

I used canned beans that I already had in my pantry:  small white and black beans.  I used canned corn.  I didn't have a red onion so I used a Vidalia.  Didn't use peppers and also didn't have any fresh herbs on hand.  I also substituted balsamic for the red wine vinegar (only used about 1/4c each for vinegar and oil).  Turned out GREAT!

I really liked this recipe!  It was almost like a salsa - in fact, we ate it with tortilla chips the next day and it was really yummy!  Next time, I will put a little less onion as I bought a huge onion and it was a bit much.  I may also add some tomato next time too. Will definitely make again!

I didn't have olive oil or red wine vinegar, so i substituted red palm oil( lots of antioxidants) and used balsamic vinegar.  EVERYONE in my family loved this. Will absolutely.... definately make this again. ;-)

4.5 stars (if I could) only because it wasn't one of those recipes that really stood out at the potluck. Noone commented on it or asked for the recipe. I thought it turned out beautifully though! I followed the advice to halve the oil & vinegar and am glad I did. It was just the right amount of dressing. I didn't use the entire onion and am also glad. I think you just need to play it by eye with the amounts of peppers and onion since they can vary so much in size. I just added until I had a nice blend of colors, which also meant I cut back on the amount of corn too. I will keep this recipe. It'll be very easy for future potlucks/picnics and am even thinking about premaking it for our next camping trip!

I made this last night and let it soak in the juices and had some for lunch today and I must say, it was delicious!  I used just 1/4 c. olive oil and red wine vinegar and decreased the salt as others sugguested.  I also used garbanzo and cannellini beans only (not a big fan of black beans and didn't have kidney beans) and part of a bag of frozen corn.  Like others, I poured the ingredients in a plastic bowl with lid and shook the dressing.  Very good.  I am looking forward to sharing this with friends.  Thanks, Karen!

This was great!  I've had 3 people ask for the recipe.  I changed the sugar to a couple packets of splenda, added a can of chickpeas, used a 15 oz can of corn since I was concerned about using uncooked frozen corn in a cold salad, I used balsamic rather than red wine vinegar and lowered the oil, vinegar and salt to 1/2 what the recipe calls for.  I used 3 Tbsp. cumin seed rather than powdered.  Marinated overnight and it turned out delicious!

was looking for a vegeterian side dish. This was really good. Followed recipe except used canned corn and cut down vinegar and oil to 3/4 cup each. Took advise from others and made a full day ahead of time to let marinade. Everyone like it!

I tasted the dressing before I poured it onto the salad and wasn't too sure about it.  I read the reviews and each one raved about it so I took the chance and poured it on.  I was pleasantly surprised how good it tasted and was even better when chilled for awhile as the flavours all meld together. I'm a vegetarian so I now have a new dish that's high in protein.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was delicious!  The only change I made was I substituted a yellow onion, for the red because it was all I had, and I used canned corn.  I brought it to a BBQ and people loved it!  I just finished the leftovers for lunch!

WOW!!  This is one delicious bean salad.  I will make this all the time from now on. It makes a lot, which was fine with me because I couldn't stop eating it! You can also use it as a "topping" for baby spinach and you have one great, nutritious salad.  Thanks for the recipe! ******

I added chaat masala and chopped green apples to it. Also skipped the olive oil, vinegar, sugar but tripled the celentro and seasoned to taste with salt, black pepper and lime juice. All this made it somewhat Indian tasting with slight sweetness to go with Indian cuisine.  It disappeared very fast!

I love this recipe!  You can play around with the ingredients; for example, sometimes I put in diced zucchini and cherry tomatoes, and sometimes I omit the onion or corn.  However, whatever you do, do not change one thing when making the dressing, because it is so delicious.  (I do, however, use Splenda instead of sugar.)  Thanks for a real winner!

This was quite good!  I left out the cumin and used garbanzo beans instead of the cannellini beans.  I also rinsed all the beans, not just the black beans and used the frozen white corn from Trader Joe's - its great frozen corn and sweet too!  Next time I'm going to add some small-sized pasta like orzo or ditalini.

DAY 2:  This is awesome! After the flavors blend, it is incredible. Also, I have now tried it on a bed of salad greens & with tortilla chips. Both ways are excellent! Great recipe.
DAY 1:  I think 4 1/2 stars is about right.  The appearance is beautiful, the recipe directions are clear, it is healthy and it makes a good amount, but I think it is a bit too tangy for me.  I'll try the leftovers and see if the flavors have come together any more.

Very colorful, and nice presentation (put it in a glass bowl).  It really doesn't take that long to prepare either, despite the daunting list of ingredients.

I made the dressing only, with just 1/3 c of both oil and vinegar, added a can of black beans, kernels from 2 leftover ears of corn, celery, and 1 c. (before cooking) of rice.  I was so impressed that it finally prompted me to tell 2 other people about this website!  Thanks to everyone for their reviews--they make a difference in what I choose.

The dressing is great.  For beans, I had black beans, garbonzo beans and a can of a kidney/pinto beans.  I also had a can of whole kernal corn.  And, I added two tomatoes and a yellow pepper.  I love this salad.  I am having it everyday for lunch.  Thanks!

Great!  Very refreshing for hot summer days.  I usually add extra cilantro and cut the dressing by half, or make the whole batch and use half to marinate some chicken.  One time I tried using the food processor to chop the veggies, but I don't recommend it!  This is good with some fresh cubed avocado on top.

This was the best bean salad ever!!!!  You can either half the dressing like others have suggested or you can double the beans if you have a lot to feed.  Awesome!!!

This was so good!!! Next time, I won't add so much sugar; I would have liked it a little more tangy. I also used garbanzo beans instead of cannellenis, and added more corn. Definitely refrigerate well for flavors to marry before serving. Great as a side dish, and even with tortilla chips as a salsa.

I loved this healthy, beautiful salad.  I did cut  the oil and vinegar as others have suggested.  The only other  changes I made was to eliminate sugar — in addition to the red wine vinegar I used white balsamic vinegar which added sweetness.  And I added more lime as I didn't have lemon.  After marinating, I was amazed how tasty it was.  The  salad got compliments and second helpings even from my husband who usually dislikes the texture of beans.  Definitely will make this again.

It's pretty involved with all the ingredients but the payoff is truly worth it. I did cut the salt to a teaspoon because I feel the beans add enough sodium by themselves, plus I used sea salt anyway.

I'm in Love with this recipe it really goes with anything. Some  of the items had to be reduced. (oil and vinegar). I forgot to take a photo of it yesterday as I have made it so many times for my home, and as a pot luck dish. I double the recipe for pot luck and it worked out find (again with less oil and vinegar. I founded cutting the onions smaller was also preferred by company. 
Will submit a photo next time I make it.

Definite keeper.  Cut the olive oil and sugar in half.  There are so many rich flavors and textures in this recipe that it didn't need cheap taste.  Why waste the calories?

Excellent as written, but if out of red wine vinegar, also very good made with balsamic vinegar. New family favorite!

Best bean salad I’ve had.  And it keeps really well, so you can make it a day or so ahead and the flavours just keep improving.  I double the garlic and other seasonings, tho.  It’s great.

Healthy and delicious! I added some spicy peppers as well and some garlic jalapeño stuffed olives added a nice punch.

I followed the recipe as written. It's a very delicious way to eat beans. Even picky eaters who don't like beans will eat this dish. I have put some of the beans in a pan to heat in a bit of oil. Placed on a dish and served fried eggs on top for breakfast. Very good reciepe.

This is an excellent salad.  The dressing is wonderful.  The only changes that I made was 1 Red Bell Pepper, 2 jalapenos and 1 Serrano, just because we like our food Spicy.

I added a little more cilantro because I like it.  The recipe is
a wonderful one and is a great dish to bring to a gathering
with a bag of scooping corn chips.
People really enjoy it and it's healthy.

So very good! It made a lot so my family ate it and loved it and then I brought it up to work to share and it was gone before lunch got here. I was asked several times for the recipe.  The only thing I did differently was add 3 avocados, diced into bite size pieces, and 4 Roma tomatoes. Also, I did 1/3 C of Olive Oil and 1/2 C of Red Wine Vinegar as suggested by other users as I did not want an overpowering of oil taste, that turned out just perfect.  All other seasonings stayed the same.
Next time, I'm going to try adding 1 or 2 fresh jalapenos.  
Other than that, the recipe is PERFECT as is! Thank you for sharing.

I followed the recipe exactly. It was amazing! I did start with 1 Tbls of sugar, but after adding more based on taste, it ended up being 2 Tbls as the recipe calls for.  What a great lunch or light dinner for summer! Yummmmm.

Just made this for dinner tonight.  A great bean salad.  I did add two things to it--at little Mexican oregano and an avocado which,  for us, put it over the top. All most forgot I cut oil and vinegar to about half. Delicious!

This was super easy to make, and all the guests loved it. Apparently it was a conversation topic and my brother had 3 servings he loved it so much. I've never made anything like this before, but definitely making it again. In fact, I'm making it next weekend per the request of my brother for his house warming party.

Soooo yummy! I don't like traditional peppers so I used poblano peppers, I feel they are crunchier and not as tart. Used more cilantro than called for bc I LOVE cilantro. This was a hit and I will make it again!

This is SO delicious!   It's my go-to choice for potlucks and it's always well received.  I do reduce the oil and vinegar to ¼ cup each and I put a tad less cumin, and chili powder when taking it to others.

I made this exactly as the recipe stated (I really don't like reviews where there are so many things changed why even bother!). This is the BEST! You could literally add whatever you like to it but the combination of green, red peppers, beans and sauce is just perfect! I did not think it was too much sauce at all. Definitely make it a day ahead of time, it holds over well for quite a few days. It's a KEEPER!

I've been using this recipe as a base for years.  It's a family staple for any big gathering.  I usually increase the vegies (adding celery, thin sliced carrots, black olives, green beans for example). I increase the dressing a bit but ALWAYS reduce the oil. The flavor is seems fresher with less oil.  Definitely tastes better the next day.  Holds great for days after that.

I've made this salad 100 times. Its SO good. I usually add 1 can of beans (4 in total) for my big family - any bean mixture works great (medley, black, red kidney, chickpeas... etc). Also up the frozen corn to 2-cups, use 2 coloured peppers, and probably 5 garlic gloves (our fam LOVES garlic). I have also added green onions on occasion with nice results. My sister hates cilantro so when she's eating it, I leave it out - which doesn't affect the taste, its still an awesome salad without it. For the dressing, I up the cumin to 1T and the chili powder to 1/2T. I've always used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine which works great. Can also use lemon juice in place of lime if thats all you have on hand.

I loved how this salad turned out. It was delicious. I am on a low sodium diet so I used canned beans with 50% less sodium, then drained and rinsed the beans prior to making the salad. I omitted salt and halved the sugar. I added smoked paprika for a little extra flavor. I will absolutely make this recipe again!

This recipe is delicious! I've made this several times, my husband loves it. I add a few habaneros and jalapenos to this because we love spicy!

I have made this recipe 5 times and each time it was FANTASTIC!  I made the recipe just as written and for my family and friends and I found by accident, if you make it 24-hours before serving you would have an even more FABULOUS dish.

Loved this recipe. Very similar to cowboy caviar recipe my daughter gave me but this has way more flavor. I added an avocado to it and it has so much natural flavor the Tablespoon of salt was unnecessary. You could use a half teaspoon and it would be enough. Otherwise this is a keeper. It's makes enough for about 8 to 10 servings so it would be great for a party. Thanks for the recipe.

I've been making this for years and will often crave it. I'll make a batch and take it for lunch to work during the summer.

The only changes i make are:
-Double the dressing but use half the amount of olive oil as it tends to congeal and get a weird texture when it gets cold.

-Use Chipotle flavored hot sauce.

-Add 1-2 diced celery stalks as it gives it a nice bit of crunch to offset the mushy beany texture throughout. (The celery stays crunchy whereas the bell peppers get mushy quickly).

You can eat this straight or with tortilla chips.

Love it, love it, love it. I added a cup of each quinoa & brown rice to stretch it out for a crowd.  Used white beans & black beans which I had on hand & 2 cans of corn.

I have been making this recipe for years now, and it only failed me once when I used cheap olive oil and bought garlic paste rather than crushing the garlic myself.  While others loved it I noticed a major difference in taste.

For those complaining about too much dressing, I typically let the salad sit for a day and take half of the dressing and marinade fish or chicken in it or mix it with a batch of cooked rice. It really taste wonderful.  Actually the cold salad service over warm rice is a favorite of mine.

The only thing I've changed is not using cilantro as I really despise the flavor, used canned sweet corn or fresh grilled corn (frozen ended up too chewy and lacked flavor) and use 1.5 tbls of sugar rather than 2.  

Everytime I have brought this to a party, I always get back an empty container and have numerous requests for the recipe. Give it a try you won't be sorry.

I loved this so much, I kept getting up in the middle of the night to eat bites of it. I have made it three times now, once for a housewarming party and everyone loved it. This is one of my favorite things to eat, especially great in the summer on hot days

Really love this salad, but only gave it 4 stars because I had to tweak it to make it perfect. I cut the oil and vinegar in half (1/4 c each) and I will go even less next time. Also, I use only one red pepper and about 1/4 c of onion. I use a mandolin to get these finely sliced. The red pepper I then chop up. The onion I prefer to leave as long slices so they can be pulled out (who wants raw onion breath?) Since I had too much dressing, I added a can of black-eyed peas. This made a good mix, and even more salad!

This is the perfect bean salad recipe--packed with flavor and easy to make.  I  always follow the recipe exactly as written.  It is now my go-to recipe for potlucks and church luncheons.  We have eaten it as a salad and also as a bean dip with Dorito or Frito scoops.  Even though the recipe calls for a dash of hot pepper sauce and chili--the amounts are so small compared to the amount of beans, peppers and onions, that these spices don't add any heat--just flavor.  I would suggest when buying the kidney beans, to purchase the dark red beans (they taste the same as the paler variety)  since they add a wonderful color to the salad. The salad only improves after a few days in the fridge so leftovers are always tasty.

What an awesome recipe! Tried it for a lunch party just today and because it turned out so well i wanted to put in a review rightaway :-)

Going by previous reviews i reduced the quantities of Olive Oil & Vinegar to 1/3 Cup each. I also added 1 tbsp of brown sugar to the dressing. The only other thing i did different was that i put together all ingredients for the dressing and let it rest overnite. I strained it and used it in the morning as per the recipe. The result was....lipsmacking! Thank you for this recipe :-)

PS: I am a total foodie and lovvvve my cheese and meats, potatoes and cream, puddings and pies.....basically all things high cal ;-) But this recipe encourages me to try out 'healthy' preparations now! Yes, 'healthy' recipes can be delicious too :-)

Wow, very fresh tasting. Nice crunch.  I did take the advice of only using 1/4 cup oil and vinegar and that was perfect. I also added 1 seeded jalapeño. Huge hit at the party! Thank you!

MOST REQUESTED RECIPE! I'm always swarmed by a circle of people at picnics asking for the recipe of this dish. I have made changes. No sugar. Add ground red pepper, lots of fresh cilantro, and extra extra lime juice. This does not need lemon juice, only lime. Nor does it matter what kind of onion. We like white onion just fine in this. I also like the look of an orange bell pepper added. As well as an extra can of beans, usually black beans.

Yummy!!   I used 1/2  each of yellow, orange, green and red bell peppers instead of just green and red to make it more colorful.  In the dressing I used 3 cloves of garlic instead of 1 and added a minced jalapeño to make it a little spicier.  Very delicious!!!  My son that doesn't care for beans or bell peppers tried it and actually liked it.  He said I should make the dressing to use on tossed salad:)

The flavoring of this salad is terrific! It makes a large amount, which is great because it tastes even better as it sits. I ate a small bowl right after mixing everything together, and it was already really tasty. The only thing I changed was I reduced the quantity of the dressing by half and used about half the recommended salt. Thanks for the great recipe. It's definitely a keeper!

I made this for my sons bday party with tiny variations. I cut the vinegar in half and added one avocado. I marined the beans overnight in dressing as suggested by one of the reviewers. It was fantastic and very well received (eaten in five minutes). I will certainly make this again.

My neighbor decided to have "Mexican Night" at her home.  First thing I thought of was to search Allrecipes.com for something new to make.  I came across this, sounded delicious and easy to make.  WOW!  It did not disappoint.  The only "change" I made was to make it the day before so the flavors could marry overnight.  It was outstanding !  Several people asked for the recipe.  Will definitely make again.

Great!!  Halved the oil and added extra cilantro. Also added a can of garbanzo beans which I would highly suggest, it made the dish.  Delicious and very forgiving.

I doubled the ingredients but stayed with the same numbers for the dressing and, at first taste, found it excellent. I'll be curious how it is after some hours in the fridge but, just as is, I'd make it again. Delicious!

Was excellent, did half the amount of oil and red wine vinegar, (as others suggested) also used chick peas instead of cannellini beasn. Would definately make it again.  Great for a large group.

Made this for my daughters waldorf school potluck. It came out amazing. I didn't make it spicy since kids would be eating it and I did add in yellow wax beans too!!  I also didn't have the vinegar and thought it was great without it!!!   Super yummy. Healthy and filling!!

Perfect! I was on vacation and loving the warm weather and felt like fresh Mexican flavors - this salad delivered and then some!  I am really quite impressed. I paired this salad with the recipe for Pico de Gallo Quesadilla's from this site. I made it almost to recipe but had a few changes, but I did have fresh cilantro, garlic, lemon & limes on hand!  Instead of hot sauce I used fresh jalapeno pepper finely chopped.  I also used chipotle chili powder instead of regular and added in some smoked paprika as well, about a tsp. This gave it some smoky depth to offset the tartness from the vinegar lemon & lime.   I am definitely taking this to the next office pot luck as I know it will be a hit

Add a bit less than 1/4 c.sugar. Makes enough dressing to add in 1/2 pkg cooked rotini, whole avocado, 2 Romas & 1/2 shredded carrot.

Since I cook only for myself, I cut this recipe in half.  Used a can of black beans and one of cannellini.  Added 1/2 cup red pepper and 1/2 cup yellow since I had no green, but the green would have been prettier. And instead of red onion, I threw in 1/2 cup white. After tasting a few hours later, I added a bit more salt and lime juice.  I really, really like this and have had it, along with homemade tortilla chips, several times for my meatless Monday meals.  And can't wait to make it for company soon.

Tasted even better the next day, despite skipping the lemon and lime juice (did not have on hand) .   The Mexican flavors gave it more interest than  similar recipes I have tried .

WOW!!!  Made this to go with homemade empanadas for dinner last night only 2 hours before serving.  It tasted great before I stuck it in the freezer.  (Speed chill ya know.)  Stirred every 1/2 hour.  My DH never gives anything a 5 star rating but, he did for this....and my original empanadas. It is even better today!  Decided to have tacos to carry on the Mexican theme tonight to go with the leftover salad.  The recipe makes a ton but, you will be glad it does!  :) Thanks, Karen, for sharing!  UPDATE!  Making this glorious salad for my neighborhood Lights Out BBQ tomorrow.  Notice I am a day early this time.  HAHAHA!  I am organizing our family reunion coming up in 2 weeks and I will make this again.  This salad is so awesome, yummy and great for crowds!  (Or just a bunch of hungry guys.  LOL!)I add garbanzo beans because I love them. I will try to remember to take a picture this time. :)

Easy to make. Omitted peppers and hot pepper sauce. Added the cilantro after two days. Made this recipe for my husband, not myself, and he loved it. He added it to an omelette, ate in tortillas. He gives it 5 Stars. I give it 3 Stars because for about 12 hours after he ate this salad I couldn't stand to be within five feet of him; THE MOST OFFENSIVE ONION BREATH EVER! I ended up adding more corn, beans and cilantro which may have helped a little, but not enough. Next I'll be adding it to some pasta.

Can't say I followed this recipe to the T, but it still came out fantastic! Tastes just like the bean salad you would get at any supermarket or deli. I would follow the suggestions of halving the olive oil and vinegar, however, I do like how the beans soak up the liquids using the full suggested amount.

This is a really good recipe. The salad is colorful and the dressing is tropical, rich, and tasty. I chose to let each individual apply their dressing themselves instead of to the entire salad.

SOOOO happy I finally found and made this recipe. It's no wonder it got all the rave reviews - it's delicious! And this is before I've even had time to let it sit and let the flavors meld in the fridge! I can't stop eating it already. Didn't change one thing - and wouldn't. It's perfect as is. Will be making again and again I'm sure! :-)

Just made this recipe and it's AMAZING!  The flavors are just right.  In hoping to get my kids to eat it, I omitted the dash of hot pepper sauce, and it was still yummy.  Brightly colored, hearty, and great taste!

Made a double recipe for a Derby Party.  Everyone loved it.  Even when doubled I only used a quarter of the oil and vinegar.  Also only 1 tablespoon salt and an eighth of sugar.  Definitely will be making this again.

As soon as I got the marinade put together I knew I would like it.  It smelled so fresh!  I did spin all the marinade ingredients plus the cilantro in my small food chopper to blend it well plus you get the taste of the cilantro without chewing on the leaves.  I think you could use almost any bean combination but I like to stick to the original recipe the first go round.  I did use frozen corn this time but wouldn't hesitate to use canned shoe peg corn.  This is one recipe that just keeps getting better.  By the time I was enjoying the last bite I was already planning on making it again.  I'm also going to try the marinade on meat.  I'm also going to try replacing the Italian dressing in a pasta salad with this marinade.  Can you tell I really liked it?

Excellent!  I used 3 cans of beans and halved everything else.  I also used one small packet of Stevia in place of sugar. Very good.

Delicious.  I cut the salt in half (or less) and use less sugar and it is still wonderful.  The only downside is my family will not eat it (they have an aversion to beans), so I end up eating it all.

I loved this recipe! I brought my left overs to work and all that tried it, loved it as well. One note, if your stomach is sensitive to acidic foods, be aware of that. I love the mixture of the vinegar, lemon, lime, and all the other ingredients. I also agree with the recipe calling for too much olive oil and vinegar. I think next time I make it, I will also use less of that and salt as well.

I followed this recipe as shown and I and my guests were not impressed. The more it marinated the better it did get, but it seemed oily and crunchy all at the same time. IDK, it could work with some adjustments, but I think we will pass on this. Thanks though.

This salad was very delicious, it was my first time trying it, and it absolutely turned out exactly what I was expecting and more. I would definitely recommended it to others. It is also good for any occasion.

Just finished preparing this.  I tasted it after mixing in the liquids and it is delicious!  I can't imagine how much better it's going to be after it sits for a while.  I usually prepare a recipe as instructed to give it a proper review, but since I do not like the taste of lemon juice in my meals too much, I just put in the two tablespoons of fresh lime juice.  Absolutely perfect!

This recipe was a huge hit with a variety of people I had over for dinner.  Stuck to it as is, and was very impressed! I did let it sit overnight, so I am not certain how important that is...there were a couple of recommendations to do so.  -Rick Jr.

I have made this multiple times. I alwasy tweak it to make it my own. I don't love spicy food so I typically leave that part out. I add raw broccoli and raw asparagus and sometimes some (thawed) frozen green beans to add flavor and crunch and I also add a can of garbonzo beans because I like them. I'm going to make it tonight and add grilled chicken so it is a complete meal and serve over olive oil and herb couscous. Because I add so many veggies I leave the proportions of the dressing as written although I usually don't add all of the dressing I make. By the time I'm done adding it probably makes 12+ servings but it's perfect for parties or to have in the fridge and take as lunch all week. This salad is DEFINITELY better after it has sat/chilled for a day or two and all the flavors have come together. This is definitely a summertime winner!

Absolutely great recipe! I altered it only because I always try to minimize fat and cut sugar on all recipes. I cut the oil in half to 1/4 cup and used only 1 1/2 tbsp sugar. I skipped the green pepper (not a fan) but used the red pepper and it was plenty. We also added a can of garbanzo beans. My family raved over this! It was a great recipe to pack up and take to our boat. Tastes even better the 2nd day!

Really liked the base of this recipe. Dressing was WAY too much though (and I like things with lots of dressing) for quantity of other ingredients. I was looking for something to do with leftover corn on the cob and used this recipe. I didn't use the cumin or hot sauce (I wanted a milder salad) and used parsley instead of cilantro as that's what I had in the yard. I thought this was great combination of corn and beans. I had to strain in colander to lose the excess dressing -- otherwise I'd have given this 5 stars. Next time I will follow other reviewers' advice and do 1/4 c. olive oil / 1/4 c. red wine vinegar for dressing.

Great recipe.  I only used half the salt, though.  I used raw sugar instead of white and I only used bottled lime juice because that's all I had.  I omitted the corn as well.  This is exactly what I was looking for to have for lunch.  Perfect recipe!

I tried this recipe today, it is both delicious and nutritious!
I would add one caution for those on low salt diets:
Even though I used no salt beans, rinsed the beans and a "lite" salt, I think 1 tablespoon of salt is too much salt.  I am very sensitive to salt and have a mild headache after eating this recipe.  When I make it again I will probably add 1/2 tablespoon of lite salt or no salt at all. I also substituted 1-1/2 Tbs agave instead of white sugar. I also used frozen organic fire roasted corn.

I doubled all ingredients except the dressing, and it was the perfect ratio...and plenty for a crowd. It's not really spicy, but chopped fresh jalapeno peppers would be a great addition and would spice it up a bit. It's a beautiful, delicious salad that gets better the longer it sits. Some reviewers complained about the olive oil solidifying. I added the olive oil very slowly to the vinegar, blending well, and I didn't have this problem. Highly recommend!

I made this recipe exactly as stated, except I omitted the cilantro cause I HATE cilantro. It was delicious! Don't reduce the oil, vineger, salt or sugar. It's perfect as-is. I think if it's too oily, they are using the wrong kind of olive oil or something. I made this to take to a BBQ this weekend and made it in advance (as one of the other users suggested) so the flavors will have time to meld together.

I've made this recipe several times and it is phenomenal.  I've used different beans and vegetables but it's the marinade - mainly the cilantro - that is the important part.  I also prefer it with 1/4 cup each of balsamic and apple cider vinegar, instead of the 1/2 cup of wine vinegar, but it's good either way.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe we like that is is so simple and delicious. It is defiantly better cold so I make it and put in the fridge for at least 15 minutes before eating. Another great thing is that you can add leftover chicken in it or put on top of lettuce for a quick salad the next day.

I loved this, and I don't like bean salad. My husband loves bean salad, and I came across this recipe while searching for one for him. Only used about 1/4 of the oil called for, & it was plenty. Omitted the salt, because all of the beans were processed with salt, & omitted pepper due to my own allergy to it. We ate this for several days, because it makes a lot, but it keeps getting better as it ages! I would make it a day ahead so the flavors meld, but it was good fresh too.

Ive been eating this all week---its a little bit sweet, a little bit salty, a little bit spicy, and very filling. I just cant get enough-- so tasy and guilt free. I like to use more peppers, so i use a red, green, yellow, and orange pepper. Sometimes when i serve myself a bowl i'll top it with half a diced haas avocado-- but i never add that to the salad whole salad since it wont keep like the other ingredients.

Oh my goodness, oh my goodness! This is unbelieveble. I halved the dressing recipe after reading other posts. I'm sure it would be great with the full amount but I really did not think it needed it. I used 3 pkts of splenda in place of the sugar and used red/yellow and orange peppers. I don't care for cilantro so it didn't have the green color next time I will also use a green one for color) but how delicious. I am using it as a main dish for myself since I am trying to stay away from meat protein and is this ever a tasty treat.

This salad was a big hit with both my meat eating and my vegan friends.  I am allergic to corn so I substituted a can of garbanzo beans.  I cut the sugar and the salt in half and it was very tasty.  It is a terrific and healthy substitute for potato salad, or a main dish when served with brown rice.

A real crowd pleaser, I have been asked on many occasions to bring this.  I have added other types of beans and have been equally successful.

This is my new favorite bean salad!!!It has a perfect balance of flavors, is easy to throw together and is great for a summer meal or side dish. I used fresh corn and not nearly as much bell pepper as the recipe calls for. I never want to be with out this salad in my fridge!

This is a wonderful recipe to make exactly as directed or to add or delete your own touches.  I love it because it is so healthy AND delicious!  The second time I made it, I thought I remembered what to get for ingredients and came home with kidney beans, black beans and garbanzo beans.  That was good too.  I work 12-hour days in a very intense line of work where I'm not free to take a real break or a lunch, and I can't leave the site at all.  So if I don't bring at least one good thing to eat on the run, it can be a pretty sad day.  This stuff brightens any day that it comes with me.  I try not to make it too often because I don't want my enjoyment of it to dim.  My doctor wants me to eat more olive oil and avocados to increase my levels of good HDL cholesterol, so I don't worry about changing the recipe.  Perfect as is!  Thank you very much for sharing.

I love this! Pretty much followed it to the letter, depending what I have on hand.  I use it as a dressing for my work lunch salads, to get some protein in and healthy oil. Sometimes add diced tomatoes. Problem is It makes too much and they don't sell little cans of all these beans. Does anyone know if it is okay to freeze?

I followed others' advice and cut the dressing in half, but otherwise prepared according to recipe. Excellent flavor! I have been using another bean and corn salad recipe frequently over the past couple of years, but will definitely switch to this one when we have Mexican food. Love the sweet cumin combo! Thanks!

This is a recipe I've been making for years, and was surprised to find I hadn't reviewed it yet! It's very flexible in that you can really use any beans you have on hand -- I've used chickpeas, chili and white beans in the past. I like my red onion to be very finely minced. I add extra garlic and finely mince it as well. The dressing instructions are spot-on. This is best if you make it the night before and it has time to marinate. Excellent!

My husband and even 9-year old daghter loved this recipe!!  I didn't have the cannellini beans so used only black benas and kidney benas. Also used Splenda instead to cut down on calories.   It still tasted so yummy!!

I followed the recipe, omitting the green pepper b/c I only had red, and used navy beans instead of cannellini. Sorry, but this was way too vinegary for our tastes. I took it to a camping pot-luck and had quite a bit left over.  I felt the cilantro and cumin were wasted since the vinegar overpowered everything else. If I try it again, I'll tweak to use less, or a different kind of vinegar, increase the cumin, cut back on the salt a bit, and maybe add some minced jalepeno instead of hot sauce to give it some depth of flavor instead of just the heat. As is, it was just OK for us.

Tasted after it had chilled overnight & thought it was good, just a little bland. Add a Tbsp. of McCormick`s Southwest seasoning & tried it again at dinner & it was GREAT! For my tastes only half of the oil is necessary. Next time I`ll add a jalapeno. Great recipe, i`ll make this often. ETA:It`s been a few days now & this salad is even better. Next time I`ll let it marinate 2-3 days before serving. I am not a bean lover but I luv this salad. Therefore I`m changing my initial 4 rating to 5. :)

I'm giving this recipe a 5 star even though it is not my favourite.  It is very tasty.  My husband thinks it is a little intense for bean salad and since there is a lot of work involved in putting it together, I'll probably keep looking for another recipe to follow.  However, it is tasty and worth trying for sure.

This is a very versatile salad.   You can use different color peppers, add a jalapeno pepper to add a little more kick, etc.  I've made this with dried cilantro if that's all I had on hand, substituted apple cider vinegar for red wine vinegar and it's still delicious.  I usually cut down on the amount of sugar as I don't find it necessary.  More than one clove of garlic usually finds its way into this recipe when I make it!  It's marinating in the refrigerator now...can't wait until dinner is ready!  :)  EDIT:  I made this again today and decided since sweet corn is in season, to lightly steam a couple of ears of corn then cut the kernels off the cob for the salad.  Really so  much better than frozen or canned corn!

This was delicious and easy to make. I didn't have some ingredients so I improvised. I paired this with some wild rice and pork- and my boyfriend and I couldn't stop eating it. A winner for sure. BUT, I only used 1 Tablespoon of olive oil. I definitely don't think it needs the whole 1/2 cup. Also, next time I'll cut the sugar in half. Otherwise, amazing.

Delicious!  I didn't have red wine vinegar so I substituted with a 1/2 cup of rice vinegar and a 1/2 cup of apple cider vinegar.
It's delicious!  I can't wait to serve it to guests!

I was looking for a mexican salad my husband would love, and this is the winner! Took other reviewers' advice and halved the oil, vinegar and sugar. Also let sit over night for more flavor. Making it for the second time now and SO looking forward to having it tomorrow night with some scoops nacho chips! One other adjustment I made is swapping out the kidney beans for pinto, just a preference.

Refreshing! Delicious! Made as written, and then added diced fresh avocado and a sprinkling of feta cheese. I served it over fresh salad greens and raw baby spinach for a wonderful side salad. No additional salad dressing needed. Would have easily served 12-15 people as a side salad. Might even add a little crisp bacon next time!

Great flavors and healthy. I didn't add the cilantro as am not a big fan of cilantro. Would make again.

This is exactly what I wanted in a bean salad! I wouldn't change anything except maybe adding more garlic ( I just really like garlic). And once when I didn't have cumin I chopped up a mango and added that instead and it was super yummy. This colorful salad is tangy and delicious and perfect for summer!

This is excellent!  Just the right amount of sweet and spicy, and it has so many health benefits including beans to lower cholesterol and antioxidant peppers.  The only thing I changed was to reduce the olive oil to 1/3 cup.

Fiesta! Colorful, just the right spice, loaded with flavor this is going in my favorite salad recipe box! I only added some orange sweet peppers because they needed to be used. It's got a great texture and really quick to whip up!

One of my favorite summer recipes! I ate this all the time last summer. It's super easy to make, great for potlucks and get togethers, makes a filling and healthy lunch/snack, and tastes great as leftovers too. You can't beat this on a hot day! Throw in some avacados too an use fresh, home grown cilantro from your garden! Thanks for posting this recipe!

I loved this recipe, so I doubled it and took it to a party of mainly 20 to 30 year olds.  It did not go over well at all.  I guess they were more of a burger and pizza crowd.  Took it home and used it with burritos and wraps all week long, and made chili with the rest.  Yum.  Next time I will not double and try it with an older crowd.

Excellent Bean Salad!  The cilantro and lime/lemon juices make it stand out.  I am taking this to an outdoor BBQ party where I know it will be appreciated as a healthy choice -- but they will be pleasantly surprised by how flavorful it is as well.

Love, love, love the beautiful colors.  MISSED THE APPLE CIDER VINEGAR & WISHED FOR SOME GARLIC POWDER (cut most of the oil, though).  But that vinegar thing?  We just needed a bit more zing in the salad.  Maybe this salad will need more lime than cider vin, but either way, we need a bit more zing.  Other than that, this is a refreshing, and even beautiful.  Perhaps that's it's highest forte:  It has a lot of *refreshing* curb appeal (well, it doesn't have as much curb appeal if its not freshly stirred, but it's still a beautiful salad).

Fantastic!!  I halved the oil (substituted canola as I don't care for olive oil flavor)...added half a can of garbanzo beans (to use them up), otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Took a bite...love it.  Can't wait to have it tomorrow for lunch

Delicious! I don't think the corn is necessary, but the flavors are great. Like others, I cut everything in the dressing in half because it seemed like too much. It still tasted fabulous. Additionally, this is waaay more than 8 servings. I'd almost double it, in fact.

It seems every potluck has a three-bean salad, and up until now, I always passed it up. After tasting this, my husband declared that I have surpassed his own mother in the kitchen.  :)  

This recipe is very forgiving.  Didn't have any red wine vinegar so I used rice vinegar, and that probably gives it a different overall flavor, but it's super delish.   I also followed other cooks' advice and went half on the oil, vinegar, and sugar quantities.  Added a few diced tomatoes, omitted the red pepper. This could double as a tortilla chip topping easily.  Can't stop eating it...

I liked this a lot but I love beans!  I read many of the reviews and I did not change the dressing at all because I added extra beans to have a little more than 8 servings but I don't think it would've been too much, just serve with a slotted spoon. I did use less salt but I often do because I don't love salty foods.  I ate it 2 days later and still fresh and delicious.

This IS the best bean salad ever.  When  read the reviews, I didn't think it would really be this good.  Made it, almost, exactly.  Added Truvia (instead of sugar), fresh tomato, 1/2 red pepper (no green pepper),canned corn...everything else was the same.  SO SO good!!!!!

Awesome! I halved the recipe and just used a can of cannellini beans, a can of black beans and a can of corn along with half of the other ingredients. This has great flavor and tasted even better the next day. Great company dish as the colors make it extremely appealing. Served with Mean Chef's Chicken in Red Chili Sauce & Rice.

This was absolutely amazing!  I made it the night before and served for lunch and was a little leary when I took it out of the fridge because I thought it looked a little soggy, BUT one bite removed all of my reservations.   I don't know what else to say except that this is perfect!

AMAZING FLAVOR  Love the cilantro--glad I had a fresh bunch.  Did as others and halved the sugar,oil and vinegar.  Used a pear infused vinegar and balsamic vinegar because that's what I had.  Had to soak my own chick peas and cook but not a problem.  
I love that I could just go in the fridge, grab the bowl and start eating.

Oh my goodness! This is absolutely wonderfully awesome bean salad! The only thing I did was added a jalapeno, 2 cloves of garlic instead of one, and used 1 teaspoon of chili powder instead of 1/2 teaspoon. It does make a lot, and it fits well in a 1 gallon ice cream pail - makes for easy transport too!

So good! (I used chick peas instead of kidney, put the zest of the lime in too, didn't use as much salt and omitted the chili powder and hot sauce.)

This was a great recipe. I omitted the green pepper (personal preference) and cut back a bit on the sugar, as other reviewers suggested. Also added a bit more cilantro. Nice fresh flavor, and even better the next day. Thanks!

Tasty! We love garlic so I roughly tripled the amount of that. A couple reductions I did to make it a bit healthier: 1 tbsp sugar instead of two and 1 tsp of salt instead of 1 tbsp. I did not have hot pepper sauce but sprinkled red pepper flakes instead.

My family loves this bean salad and it's always a hit when I take it to potlucks.  Because the recipe makes so much dressing, I ALWAYS double the beans and if needed, I add more of the spices to taste.  But you cannot go wrong with this salad!  It's delicious!  Thanks, Karen!

When I asked my sis for this recipe she directed me here.  It's delish and I've made it myself a few times and now get asked for the recipe myself.  The only change I made was to reduce the sugar to 1/2 tbs.  
Thanks for the great recipe.

This recipe is fantastic!  The only change I made was substituting chickpeas instead of cannellini beans because I just like them better.  It was really yummy.  The only thing that bothered me was after it being in the fridge for a day the oils solidified and it didn’t look that great.  It still tasted good though!

Amazing- I have made this 3 times in the past week. I left out the kidney beans, cannellini beans and red pepper (didn't have any) and used frozen corn (thawed of course). Left out the hot pepper sauce. And it was still awesome. Fabulous tasting salad- great to dip chips in too!

Have made this several times & everyone loves it.  I make double batches so that we have left overs.  It's great for a salad night, over lettuce & top with tomatoes, avocado & cheddar cheese.

I made this and liked it but if I was going to make it again, I'd follow some of the recommendations to halve the dressing.  It was a bit too much.

Ok, I just made the salad and holy crapoly, it was great! I always look on here and think, "Oh, Lord, another review where the person has altered the entire recipe so that it doesn't even resemble how it looked originally." Unfortunately, many times I do alter the recipes based on what everyone says (often times, this is a good idea). This time however, I only did a couple of things differently from the original: Added a sprinkle of oregano, toasted the cumin seeds before grinding and since I didn't have kidney and cannellini beans, I added black beans, garbanzos, and corn instead. Other than that, if I had the proper ingrediants to begin with, I wouldn't have changed much at all. WOW, so fresh and such a winner!

I would rate this higher if I could! I think the only change I made was I cut back on the oil a little, just a personal preference. It was so good. The day I made it, I kept getting it back out of the frig to "sample" it. It makes a ton! It'd be good for a summer potluck.

excellent!  I added a can of garbanzos as well as 3 diced jalapenos (as well as using a whole bag of frozen corn).  It was actually better the second day, so make it ahead of time.  Everyone wanted the recipe.

Very tasty! I should have done a better job at draining everything I had a lot of excess liquid it seemed.  I used canned corn as that is what I had on hand and it worked out fine.

I've made this a dozen times using this recipe as the starting point.  Love it, I'm eating it now!  
My most consistent "tweak" is that I use less than 1/3 of the recommended salt and it's still plenty salty.

Great salad.  Fresh and delicious.  I made it for some friends from USA and they loved it.  I used fresh corn as it is in season but otherwise did it exactly to recipe.  The dressing is wonderful.  Just the right amount of tang.

Excellent!  I used half the amount of oil and vinegar as others suggested and it was great!  I added cold cooked rice and cucumbers and found it to be a great meal.  My husband, who rarely eats these kinds of beans, even loved it.

All I need to say is that this is AMAZING.  It is labor intensive but worth every minute.  I double it.  I also use a vegetable chopper that they sell at target called the "Vidalia Chop Wizard".  I use it for salsa as well.  It is one of my favorite kitchen tools.  Makes perfect little squares in 2 different sizes.
They have it on amazon.

Delicious! I thought this would be even better with some Mexican cheese crumbled on top before serving and will probably add some cucumber next time. Thanks!

This was really yummy.  I did not add salt (restricted diet) and I didn't think it needed any, really.  I soaked my own dried beans and it was so much better than I imagined.  Being on a diet, it's nice to have something that feels like a real treat, but is full of fiber, flavor and very satisfying!  Thank you for this recipe!

This makes a great appetizer served like a salsa with corn chips (Frito Lay scoops work best).

This salad is awesome - the sugar is key and all the flavors together are spectacular.  I added water chestnuts because I had them and wanted to use them in something...  they added a nice texture.  I will make this salad many times more!!!

Loved this recipe!  The cilantro is the key ingredient!  For the frozen corn I used Trader Joe's frozen grilled corn - Delicious!  Being from California we always have an abundance of avocados available so I chopped one and added it to the recipe, it made it creamy and rich.  Thank you for sharing your recipe!!

My husband all but turned his nose up when I mentioned bean salad, but he's requested it several times now and I alway double the batch so we can eat it with lunch for days to come.  One tip: Never, under any circumstances use dried cilantro (even if you have to buy more than you'll use when you buy it fresh)!

Delicious salad!  Very flavorful and the colors are beautiful.  I halved the dressing as some suggested and was quite disappointed.  It needed more.   I refer to this as the "manly man salad" in our house!  Also lasts well as it continues to marinate, and is a wonderful change from normal salad fare.

I love this salad. I make it often! I use 1/4 C water and 1/4 C oil to decrease the fat content, and the taste is the same. I usually omit the hot pepper sauce and/ or use less of the chili powder.

I made this for my daughter's "Dora" themed birthday party. I got rave reviews and even a recipe request. I did make a few changes because I didn't have a couple of ingredients and don't like a couple. I left out the bell peppers, I don't like them. I used canned corn, all lime juice and half the amount of oil and vinegar. This is a very light way to fix beans for the summer.

A.M.A.Z.I.N.G. I've made this twice for potlucks and both times it was a huge hit! Both times I cut the amount of dressing in half and it was plenty.  The second time I didn't have all the ingredients on hand, so I kind of improvised the dressing:  1/4 cup oil,  1/4 cup red wine vinegar,  big squirt of lemon juice,  1tsp sugar (I don't like it too sweet),  1/2tsp garlic powder,  at least 2tsp cumin (just dumped it in!),  1tsp salt,   1/2tsp (or more) cayenne pepper powder.   I love cilantro so I added a LOT. Everybody asked me for the recipe =) This one is definitely a keeper!

Usually a recipe with list of ingredients this long would steer me away.  However this was a cinch to prepare and an hour later when it was served it was absolutely delicious!  I have a feeling it will be even better tomorrow!

Very good. I didn't have any corn, so I had to go without. I will make sure not to skip it next time because it sounds great. The overall flavor was wonderful. This took longer than the recipe claimed since there was so much chopping, but it was sooo worth it.

I get lots of compliments whenever I make this bean salad. I cut the vinegar and olive oil back to 1/3 cup each and there's still lots of dressing at the bottom, but the dressing is so good I consider this a good thing! Also, I like to sub chickpeas for the cannellini beans.

Very good; I subbed red beans for the cannellini because I didn't have them.  The flavor was a bit strong but I think it was because I ran out of balsamic and subbed some other vinegar which was a bit more acidic... Hubby liked this with our 4th of July BBQ :)

This was really good.  I used a can (15oz) of corn instead of the frozen and it worked fine.  It does make a lot of sauce... I used a little less olive oil than called for to lower the fat.  I will definitely make this again!

I was a little skeptical about making this dish. The cold beans etc sounded kind of weird to me. I thought it would be great with some meat in it. I put 4 chicken breasts in the slow cooker for 4 hours with taco seasoning. I shreaded the chicken and put it over the mexican bean salad-(which I made exactly as the recipe says) OMG! It was amazing! I kept the chicken mixture seperate from the bean salad so when I put the leftovers together I could keep the bean salad cold and the chicken could be heated up. My fiance LOVED it-we only had it 3 days ago and he is asking me to make it again.

This dish was incredibly simple and yielded fantastic results! I left out the cannellini beans since I did not have them on hand and added garbanzo beans and fresh green beans. I also added some Giant Eagle Fat Free Sweet Vinegar and Olive Oil dressing to the mix. What a great dish!

So incredibly simple but really delicious. It's much better cold and not eaten right away. I liked it so much I had it for lunch all week, sometimes over spinach or greens, sometimes topped with tuna salad. Yum!

This was suprisingly good. Wayyy too much of the sauce though. It was like a soup.

It tastes better after a couple of days in the fridge.  I am a fan of Leona's version that adds tomatoes and cucumbers along with cutting the oil, vinegar, and sugar in half.  I have put 1/2 cup into a non-stick fry pan warmed it then added egg whites for breakfast in an omelette.  Also great for lunch in tacos with a little chicken or cheese added.

This is so good!  Omitted cilantro because husband can't stand it, but other than that, made as directed  The dressing is the best!

Not bad for what it is, but it doesn't blow me away. I'm not sure if I'm a fan of vinegar. I think I'm going to this into a salsa and add some tomatoes.

Not a bad recipe, but definately use the other suggestions in the reviews - it was a huge hit at a potluck with just a few tweaks.  I used 1/2 of the oil and vinegar and it was the perfect amount.  I also used garbanzo beans instead of cannellini - I think it gives a nice variety in the texture.  I thought the dressing was a little over-spiced though, I would less spices, maybe specifically use less black pepper, if I make it again.

Wonderful dish and it makes an excellent salsa as well, even more so if tomato is added.  The recipe as is makes a lot of extra dressing but that was great because the dish can be allowed to marinade over time. I allowed the dish to set a day before digging in and it was just wonderful.  Next time I make this I will probably add celery for some consistency and cut the onions into rings for extra crunch if I plan on using it as a salad as opposed to a salsa.  My wife wanted a little extra salt added in and I wanted a little extra hot pepper sauce which is quite easy to add to the finished product.

So good, I couldn't stop eating it, and this is before I chilled it!  I made a few changes according to my families taste: Used only Black and White Beans 2 cans of each, no green pepper because we don't like them but did use the red pepper (may add a yellow next time) and only used half of the salt. It did make a lot of liquid but it wasn't an issue. Got rave reviews from everyone and it is a potluck favorite. Thank you Karen!!

I LOVE this recipe. We usually make it without the last three ingredients since my husband and I have differing spice requirements. He adds the last three ingredients to his. I also half the oil, vinegar, and sugar as suggested in earlier reviews. It is a great recipe to have a little helper help you make (just omitting the hot items) – my 3 yr old loves it. We even add tomato if we have some. Everyone usually has several helpings.

Really delicious. To make it a little leaner, I skipped the olive oil and sugar altogether. I also added some celery for more crunch. Like others, I used canned corn. For the beans, I chose Kidney, Great Northern, and Chick Peas. This is officially a new staple!

We loved this. I can tell already that it will become a big favorite as a contribution to potluck dinners. It's easy to make and tastes great. I followed the recommendation to use balsamic rather than red wine vinegar--and I also halved the oil and vinegar. Both very good recommendations.

My landlady and I both enjoyed this salad immensely! To cut down on calories, I halved the amount of oil and vinegar. I also added a jalapeno (I enjoy a little extra spice!) Will definately make again.

Amaaazing recipe! the dressing was phenomenal but i have to say that it was too much. I had a total of seven cans of different kind of beans and this dressing was the perfect amount for it. But next time I'm making less, I will be definitely cutting down on the measurements. Really great recipe. The flavor is amaazing!

I think this was good and a nice twist on a standard three bean salad.  I served this with roasted pork tacos and mexican rice.  I made this exactly as stated and I wouldn't change anything.

For something so simple, I could not believe how tasty this was.  I was worried about the large quantity,. but everyone kept going back until it was gone.  Works as well with cider vinegar as with wine vinegar.

Not only does this dish catch your eye but you do not expect there to be so many fresh/tangy/sweet flavors going on. I made this three times so far. It is so easy to make, very healthy (perfect for an any-time snack) and super tasty. Oh and i get tons of compliments when it bring it to parties. ;)

This salad is wonderful.  We make it at least once a week.  It is great on a bagel, in a burrito, on a green salad, with eggs, add it to any left over you have or just by itself. Thanks so much for a great Bean Salad

Great Salad, the fresh cilantro really made the difference. I noticed alot of people mentioned to cut back on the vinegar & oil. I've made this a few times and I've noticed I really had to make sure the beans were properly drained if not there will be alot more liquid to your salad. Besides the mix of the beans with the vinegar tastes to good to cut back on

Agree with some of the other posts, this recipe is much better if it sits for atleast overnight.  I was out of lemon and lime and still it was very tasty.

This is a great bean salad. I made no changes. Like others have said, its best when given a couple days before eating. I almost cut in half the oil and red cider vinager, as a few others suggested. I am glad I stuck to the recipe.

What a hit!  This is by far the best bean salad I've ever made.  The dressing is fabulous (although I did cut the oil and vinegar in half).  The only other slight change I made was used 1 tsp of cayenne pepper instead of the tabasco and chili powder.  It gives the dressing an extra kick.  This is very healthy and delicious - you have to try it!!

We followed this recipe as written - except I added a second clove of garlic, and since the frozen corn that we use is a 16-oz bag, we added the whole bag.  Some folks recommended cutting the oil/vinegar in half. I did not, and would not... it is perfect the way it is written.  Thanks for sharing!!

I was looking for 'bean' dishes, came across this and gave it a try.  It is one of my very favorites now. I brought it to my Mom's on the weekend where everyone went crazy for it.  I had to make three batches throughout the weekend.  The first thing I'm asked now by my nieces and nephews is "are there beans in the house this weekend"? I serve it with scoops...delish!  My niece also tried it in a wrap with a slice of fresh mozzerella and said it was fabulous that way too.  Thank you, thank you!  This is a keeper and it's ALWAYS in my fridge to pick on.   I've given the recipe to atlease 5 people at this point.

To make this even healthier, I cut out the sugar and reduced the olive oil to only a tbsp. or two.  It needs no more than that.  This is delicious!  I had several people ask for the recipe.  I subbed garbanzos for the cannellini beans, and used only one pepper and cut out the hot sauce.  Excellent for a summer party!

I didn't have a couple of ingredients, but I think I had enough that I can still give it 5 stars, because even with a few missing pieces this was fabulous!

You can't go wrong following this recipe exactly but I always add a can of pinto beans too because it is my son's favorite and there is still plenty of dressing.  Everyone I make this for always insists on the recipe.

Great recipe. Has a bit of a kick to it. I ate it for lunch with some pita. I may cut the recipe in half next time and try adding a whole wheat pasta to it to make it a pasta salad. I will try this at the next family barbecue!!

Very good flavor!  I made it a couple of days in advance so the salad could sit in the dressing.  This will be a summer staple in this house!

Flavorful & Delicious. Make ahead the night before and the vegetables soak up all the wonderful dressing. Recipe is perfect as is.

I found that cutting back the oil and vinegar to 1/3 cup was a great compromise -- cutting back to 1/4 each as some suggest might be too dry.  canned corn made for crisp salad that didn't get watered down.  this definitely has some heat in it -- you may want to set some aside for the kiddos before adding in the chili powder!!

Really, really good.  A friend of ours has brought this to a few social events and I'm always excited when I see it.  Today I finally made it myself.  Despite the super long list of ingredients it's really easy.

This was a good, flavorful salad. I agree with a lot of the other reviewers though. It needs about half of the amount of oil. I had to let it stand on the counter for an hour before serving just to soften the clumps of EVOO.

Completely awesome.  Did like the rest of the reviewers and cut back on the oil/vinegar, and I only used the juice of one lime, but I also added the zest....which makes ALL the difference in this salad.  Anyone who throws out a juiced lemon/lime without using the zest is complete FAIL in the kitchen!  Anyway, made it the day before service as indicated for any recipe of this sort.  Everyone loved it, and I got bonus points from my wife.  Thanks!

Amazing, it deserves more than 5 stars.  I used a blend of frozen southwestern corn.  For the dressing, I used 1/4 cup olive oil, 1/3 cup vinegar, 3 tbs. lemon juice, and just a dash of sugar.  We thought it was perfect this way and will continue to make it like this.

This is one of the best recipes I have ever found on the internet; it is a hit every time. I decreased the sugar to 1 tsp, the salt to 1 tsp, and the oil to 1/4 cup. I wish I could give it more stars.

One of the best bean salads I have ever had. I have not had anything like it before. It reminds me of one of a Tex-mex infusion side dish. So Yummy, so easy!

I was looking for a vegetarian recipe and tried this because of the good recommendations.  I was not expecting much but this really is a fantastic dish.  I did not have either red or green peppers and this is still great.  I just made it and have to make myself put it away until the family comes home for dinner.  Make this salad, you will not be disappointed.

I just updated my review from a 4 to a 5 because I finally made it and it is just as good as I had hoped it would be.  I added a jalepeno to the peppers and onion instead of adding chili powder to the dressing and honey in place of the sugar.  If you use a jalepeno make sure to test a small piece of it first so that you don't use too much or too little.  I have had a run of mild jalepenos lately but this one today was hot, hot, hot so I only used half of it.  I could see this also working well as a warm side dish, perhaps in place of cowboy beans and/or succatash when having ribs and chicken.

AWESOME! AWESOME! AWESOME!  I love this recipe.  I tweaked the recipe and also added some zest of lime and lemon.  I also cut back dressing to 1/4 cup oil and vinegar also cut back on salt and used 1/2 green pepper and 1/2 red. Also added chopped freshe tomatoes.  I made the night before and added the frozen corn the following day. Fantastic :)

What a beautiful creation, and delicious too! Served with a hard boiled egg and baked whole whea tortilla chips for a nutritionally complete vegetarian meal for me, and with Salsa Chicken, from this site for the meat eaters in my family. Don't use all of the dressing, as it is far too much for the salad. Looking forward to taking leftovers for packed lunches. Thanks for the great recipe.

made it for a tailgating party of about 13 people. Everyone really liked it, but we still had left overs for weeks!  It made way more than "8" servings.

Changes: can of corn instead of frozen, and i left out lime juice on accident, the first time i made it.

I love this salad.  The cilantro really sets the tone for the taste....it has just the right amount of spice.  The only change I made was to omit the salt and added chopped fresh green and yellow beans.  The crunch they add is a nice added touch.

really good recipe.  I read reviews and used some ideas to suit my tastes and it was a huge hit at our church picnic!  not one drop left! I substituted garbanzo for the cannellini, used canned corn, and added fresh tomato and cucumber.  I used garlic powder and just half an onion because I didn't want it to be too strong.  I also used just 1/4 cup of oil and vinegar, but I kept the spices the same.  The cilantro and cumin make this salad.  Thanks for the recipe, I will be making this one a lot!!!

This is sooo good! I used a little less than 1/4 cup each of the oil and vinegar (used balsamic). I also subbed pinto beans. I will definetly make this again!

Phenomenal!  I decreased the red wine vinegar a bit and it was perfect.  Other than that--I made exactly as recipe stated.  I made a day early and my guests raved about it!

MAKE THIS!!!  Fabulous!  Only used 1 tbsp of oil for lower fat and didn't even notice!!!  I've always been a three been salad fan and was sure it couldn't get any better than that, but this is the best bean salad I've ever had!  Will make again and again, thanks so much for the recipe!

Simple. Easy. Festive. I just threw this together with corn and red beans (no onion or bell pepper) and after one taste couldn't stop tasting it. We'll see how the kids like it, but for now I'm already craving it. It looked like a complicated recipe at first, until I realized it was canned stuff and a dressing mix.

Awesome!  I make this salad once per week for a church potluck and everyone loves it.  I make these changes:  cut the oil to 1/8 cup, vinegar to 1/8 cup, use only 1 red pepper (omit the green), double/triple the cilantro, sub garbanzo beans for the cannellini beans, and add chopped avacado to the top.

I didn't think anything so easy could taste so good. 
Next morning, I warmed this slightly and used it as a chunky salsa topping on breakfast burritos.  Yum!

Following recipe exactly, except I halved the dressing ingredients since so many said there was too much dressing. I was sorry I did this. Next time I will make the full amount. I made the salad the day before and the dressing got absorbed. It was actually on the dry side. However, it is a wonderful mix of ingredients and you feel really good after eating it..it has a wholesome, healthy feeling to it.

Thought this was very tasty.  Refreshing on a hot day served on romaine with a little salsa on top (didn't add tomatoes like some did to the salad), sour cream and sprinkled with Colby Jack shredded cheese.  Also added avocado to the salad.  Yum! I will be making this again!

This salad is excellent. I followed other reviews and cut both the olive oil & red wine vinegar to 1/4 cup each.  I added green onion and diced avocado.  I also cut the sugar to 1 TBSP.  No need for two, this salad already has such a wonderful flavor.  I highly recommend it!

Excellent salad! I cut the vinegar and oil in half the second time I made it and that worked out better. Left everything else as is. If you use entire amount, there's just way too much liquid. It's a waste. I also subbed Splenda for the sugar. Makes the recipe 100% Weight Watcher Core Plan compliant!Everyone wanted this recipe!

Delicious! Omitted the onions and I didn't have cilantro, so I had to use parsley. It was great, but I bet cilantro would have been amazing in this. I followed others' suggestions of cutting the oil and vinegar down. I used just a little over 1/8 cup of each and it was perfect. I served it at a cookout with a bunch of meat and potatoes guys and they ate it right up!

I'm trying to decide what to bring to a potluck in a couple of weeks, so I made this.  It's got a bit of a kick, and it tastes very good.  Very healthy, too!  I halved the servings, but it still makes a lot so I clearly don't have to double it to take to that potluck!  My only gripe is the onions (I used white instead of red), but I don't like raw onions so much, so that's just me.  Otherwise, pretty, easy, and delicious!

Wonderful balance of flavors in this dressing. Don't cut back the oil and vinegar, just keep fresh bread on hand to sop up what's left on your plate!  You could sub just about any fresh chopped veggies in this salad and have it come out beautifully, I'd guess.  Fresh avacado slices on the side make a great accompaniment--good contrast of flavor, color, and texture.

Oh this is good.  
Changes:
- No corn (don't like it)
- 1/4 cup olive oil, 1/4 cup red wine vinegar
- 1/2 tbsp salt
- double the cumin
- 2 green bell peppers (just didn't have any red in the house)   

YUM.

I liked this a lot! The dressing is delicious. I doubled the recipe, and used a smattering of many beans (black, kidney, cannellini, blackeyed peas, great northern--cleaned out the pantry!! =) ) and it was just fine! Following previous reviewers' advice, I halved the salt and olive oil, and reduced the vinegar a bit. Really fresh taste, yum.

Such a great recipe!  I used chickpeas as well as red kidney beans and white beans, each a 19 oz can.  I used half of the oil/vinegar that was called for and it was still plenty for the amount of beans.  I only had yellow onions in the house but the taste still works.  I used more lime juice and hot sauce for more kick, and doubled the cumin.  Absolutely delicious!

This salad was easy, tasty, and healthy!  Thank you for the great recipe!  I used regular yellow onion and some green onion and skipped the green bell pepper and used more red pepper; also, I used a can of corn and added some cayenne for more zing!

This is the yummiest bean salad recipe - great for summer picnics and BBQs!  I've made it both ways, both with the full dressing amount as specified in the recipe and half the amount as other readers have stated.  The first few days, it seems like a lot of dressing; but toward day 4-5, the beans absorbed all the dressing.  It keeps very well in the fridge.

Not your typical lime/cilantro bean salad!  I loved it!  A couple of changes:  used 6 Bean Blend and kidney beans, canned corn, sweet (white) onion, 1/2 cilantro (don't like it that much).  Stayed fresh and very good a couple of days in the fridge.  Husband loved it.  I tried a straight-across switch of the red wine vinegar with balsamic vinegar (which I like) and it was WAY too overpowering.  I added more of the other ingredients to even out the tastes.  All in all, an awesome will-do-again recipe.

Very yummy side dish for a BBQ I just had.  I made the night before.  I used a smaller can of black beans and added also a small can of chick peas to compensate.   Instead of frozen corn I used a can of whole kernel corn-the rest I kept the same and it was delicious.  My brother took a container home before I could serve it.  He loved it.

Loved this salad. Needed a salad that I could use what I had on hand. I subbed a few things. I used a can of mexi corn, used red beans instead of callenini and didnt have any bell peppers so I threw in a few green onions. Its a bit tangy so next time I will cut down on the vinegar. I always like to follow the recipe the first time I make something and then go from there.

Fresh and Fabulous!!  I made this for the 4th (Mexican food theme) and all but about a cup of it was left.  It was soooo good!  The only thing I might do different next time is wait to add the dressing (I liked it better fresh) OR cut back on the vinegar a little bit because I made it the night before (to marinate) and served it the next day and I thought the vinegar taste got a little stronger. Either way it was still so yummy!

I've never been a bean salad fan, but my husband is crazy for it.  The list of ingredients appealed to me so I we gave it a try.  I enjoyed it. My husband raved over it and ended up eating almost the whole batch over the course of 3 dinners.  Definitely even better the second day, but just as definitely needs to be eaten up by the third.

This recipe was great.  I made it last night and it hardly had time to marinate but it was still delicious!  I can't wait to try it tonight after the flavors have had more of a chance to marry.  It does make quite a bit of dressing but I wouldn't want to make any less so that most of the veggies are covered.  I put all of the dressing ingredients in a jar and shake it really well.  I like to do that instead of whisking.

Yummy.  Made exactly as recipe stated, but I think next time I will use cayenne pepper in place of the black pepper and throw in some serrano peppers to make it spicy. Very filling and very tasty.

Thanks Karen!!  This is a definite 5 star recipe.  I'm a fussy eater and don't even really care for beans but this was super.  The dressing really makes it. I'm making this for the 3rd time in two weeks, my husband keeps asking for it.  I used yellow, red and orange peppers for color and red onions.  I followed the recipe to a "T" and it was fantastic.  The 2nd time I reduced the oil a little because I'm on a diet.  My friend loved it and we've been passing the recipe on to everyone who tries it.  Try to use fresh fruit and don't skimp on the lime juice!

Refreshing, healthy and deeeelicious! Made exactly according to recipe, the only thing I will do to suite my tastes a bit more is add some chopped tomato. If you can't find cannellini beans (which I couldn't either) Great Northern beans or White Kidney beans make an excellent substitute.

Crunchy, colorful with layers of flavor from a great combo of spices, olive oil and fresh citrus juices! I served with tacos and family and friends came back for 3rds! I skipped the tacos and just ate the salad! Yum!

Snaps for Karen! This is one of my favorite recipes, you just can't mess it up. I have added so many different spices to this and its always great. We love lime so I used 2 and no lemon, more fire for a real kick, cut up cooked chicken breasts, pork tenderloin, and my favorite is 2 cups of cooked barley. You can add whatever spice or meat you like, you just can't mess it up!!!

This is an easy to make, inexpensive, and colorful addition to any meal. I made this as a side to a mexican themed dinner party and everyone raved about it. I'll also use it as a side dish for BBQ's in the summer. This is a dish you can definitely make ahead of time and put in the fridge. It's also something to make when you have vegetarian guests. I put a lot of extra hot sauce in it to give it a kick.

I made this for a potluck, doubled the recipe, approx. 50 people came and there was plenty left over.  I got a ton of compliments on it.  Maybe a little too sweet for me, I think next time I'll reduce the amount of sugar...  great recipe though!

I had to make this without the peppers but it was still great.  I used 1/2 the oil and double the vinegar, and green onions.  There was a bit of dressing left over but not enough to make a fuss over.  Low fat and tasty.  Thanks!

I've made this recipe about six times and I just love it. The dressing alone gets 5 stars! I always add some jalapeno peppers and an extra can of garbonzo beans. It makes a huge amount but I still find myself sad when it's gone!

This bean salad is sooooo... good!  This recipe makes a huge bowl full of salad.  When I first made it, I served it as a side dish.  The next day, I served it with whole grain tortilla chips, kind of like a salsa.  Very, very yummy.  The only thing I did differently than what the recipe said, was I added one chopped jalapeno pepper...a great addition.  Will definitely make this one again.

Pretty good. I had to modify the ingredients since I did not have all on hand such as beans or peppers. I reduced vinagar by 1/4 and salt and oil by 1/2. It really does get better after day or two siting in fridge. Second day I also added can of albacore tuna to change it a little and it tasted perfect. Thanks

Oh my! This is our new favorite snack,salad, meal! I added some diced jicama and red, yellow and orange peppers for a snappy texture! Also, I  found that I only needed 1/2 the oil.

Great recipe!  I also cut the oil (I used olive oil) and added seeded cucumbers and cherry tomatoes.  Next time I'll try adding orzo as well.  This recipe makes a TON of salad, but is a great, healthy alternative to other oily salads.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great, easy salad. Make it a few days in advance and stir each day and you will get great flavor. I followed the advice of others and cut the oil and vinegar in half. You just don't need as much as the recipe calls for. (I also cut the salt to 2 teaspoons and didn't miss the tablespoon.)

This recipe is so good. I followed it exactly and can't believe how good it it. It tastes much better next day if that is even possible. Serve it as a side dish, or you can eat for lunch on a tortilla or with tortilla chips for a dip. Wonderful!!

I have now served this dish 4-5 times as a side, vegetarian filling for fajitas and as a topping for salad.  Everyone loves it.  I like to make two changes:  1.  Use pinto beans instead of kidney.  I like them better and it seems more "Mexican" with them.  2.  Half to 3/4 of the dressing is enough unless you want to use it over salad greens and use the liquid as salad dressing as well.

As other reviewers suggested I cut the olive oil, vinegar and sugar in half and let it sit overnight so the flavors could blend.  Very easy to make (especially if you have a food processor) and healthy.

I made this for Easter and it was great ---I did change some ingredients according to what I had on hand. I think this is one of those recipes where you can do  what changes that  you like. I used garbanzo beans instead of kidney and cannelini beans- added chopped tomatoes and avocado -red pepper flakes - can corn and roasted red pepper instead of pimento. used only green pepper --its a  pretty salad the lime &  lemon  dressing  is perfect--tastes great!  I will make again -it  will make a wonderful salad for potluck or summer cookout with any main meat course.

Excellent!  Used black-eyed peas instead of cannelli since that is all I had.  Also used dry cilantro...would have been tastier with fresh. Substituted Splenda for the sugar and only used 1/4 c. olive oil.  Since my family isn't crazy about onions, I only used about 1/2 a red onion and minced it instead of chopping it. Was served with blue corn tortilla chips...it disappeared FAST!

excellent salad.  aside from the cilantro, which can turn wilted in 24 hrs, this salad will keep for 2-3 days, if it lasts that long!  i eat the leftovers in tortillas for lunch!

Another winner! As usual, I didn't have all the ingredients on hand, so substituted black-eye peas for the kidney beans and chopped tomato and two cans green chilies instead of the peppers. Also used dried cilantro. Good stuff!

Yummy! I cut down the oil to 1/4 C and the sugar to 1 tsp. Also, I used canned corn, one red pepper, balsalmic vinegar and added lost of garlic. It is so delicious! I could eat the whole thing by myself!

I loved this dish!! It was so good, I will make it again for company. I made it for my family and everyone ate it up! I cut down on the salt, pepper, and cumin, and added an extra TBSP of lime juice. I also added a chopped tomato and a chopped jicama. The jicama gave it a nice extra crunch!

excellent!  I liked the spice, and added alittle extra.  I also used cans of mixed beans.  They have 6-9 different beans in them and found it worked very well.  also added alot more colour.  Very festive salad!  Lots of compliments.

I have made this twice and it was such a hit I made it a second time. I used balsamic vinegar because I was out of red wine and it was good. The second time I made this I halved the oil and vinegar.

Very good. I think I'll reduce the amount of red wine vinegar I put it in next time, but everyone else liked it as the recipe stands. This makes a LOT, but it's so easy to eat a lot cuz it's so good. It will be part of our regular rotation. It's great vegan protein, tastes clean, and is all-around healthy. Thanks for posting this recipe!

Very good bean salad. I would give it 5 stars but I think it is way too much oil and vinegar, 1/4 cup of each is enough and I think recipes should have measurements for all the ingredients. 1 onion and green pepper chopped can be different amounts depending on the size of the onion and green pepper.  Also anyone putting too much oil in, please don’t throw it away . Take 1/2 of the salad and rinse it with water. Add it back in and adjust your seasonings.

I've been making a version of this salad for many years.  It is a MUST for any summer cook-out, football party, or any gathering.  Everyone loves it, and expects it.   The best part is that it gets better the next day, but we don't have leftovers.

Great recipe!  There 's two of us so I cut the recipe down .  I used small cans of black beans along with garbanzo beans.  Also used honey instead of sugar and just wine vinegar and oil.  It's what I had.  Very healthy, will be making this a lot.

I will make this again! it is so tasty.
I put it over a bed of arugula and spinach to get some greens in the mix but it would be perfect on its own.
I substituted  2 packets  of Whole Earth sweetener for the sugar and reduced the amount of salt to 1/2 tablespoon. I also used reduced sodium beans black beans and kidney beans.

I cut the oil in half after reading other ratings. I also added 2 stalks of celery, 2 cut up avocados, and 1/4 of an English cucumber. Everybody at the potluck loved it .

I love this recipe. On the second making of it I did halve the amount of oil and vinegar in the dressing because it is way too much and cut back the amount of sugar and had to cut back some on the onion (reason for 4 stars.) Otherwise it is delicious. I left out cilantro because I just can't eat that stuff.
As others have said it's even better the second day! And it's just so healthy.
So many variations are possible- add chicken, add cheese,  vary the spices...Love it!

Have been making this bean salad for years and always get great compliments. The recipe is wonderful. Only slight change I make it reducing the oil from 1/2 cup to 1/3 cup. Will try 1/4 cup in the future and seeing if I can lower the sugar amount but hesitant because how delicious it tastes. But definitely recommended.

Outstanding recipe. Easy  to prepare. I had my family and quests rave about this salad. This will become a family favorite. I lightened up the recipe by cutting the olive oil to 1/4 cup versus the recommended 1/2 cup. I also squeezed one lime into the recipe. Last, I did not add sugar. I recommend this salad to everyone!!!

It was a great recipe.  We enjoyed it, ate it as a salad and a bean salsa as a snack.  I added diced tomatoes that was a nice addition.

I needed to find a convenient food to take to my kid's college tailgate party. I saw this and thought it would fit the bill. Well, it was a HUGE hit with all the college kids and their parents! Served it with scoopable tortilla chips. Perfect for tailgating! No utensils needed! I don't like cilantro so that was omitted. Other than that I followed the recipe; wouldn't change a thing!

This salad is amazing! We provided a BBQ cookout for a Veteran Hospital, which fed at least 200 people. Not only was this salad a hit, but was perfect for such an event. Compared many reviews, for ideas. Marinated them two days early and, added the veggies the evening before. Perfect!

I used only 1 bell pepper instead of 2.   Either red, yellow or orange because they are sweeter.  I get asked for the recipe every time I make it.

Made this for a work potluck, and it was a hit. (Shared the recipe with several people).

My modifications:  I used canned corn, dried ciltrano, and left out all the sugar from the dressing. I used a splash of Frank's Hot Sauce.

Was a perfectly spiced dish...I used maple sugar instead of regular sugar and cut onions and pepper amounts in half and no cilantro just parsley just because that’s what I had on hand plus canned Trader Joe’s sweet corn. Went over well!

This was a last minute "what do I have in the pantry" experiment.  I did not have all the ingredients, but used what I had and it actually was delicious. I did not have black beans or any peppers on hand. I used one can each of kidney beans, white beans, green beans and corn. Only had a lemon so no lime. Did have fresh cilantro which really helped. Would make again!

This is one of my go to salads. Takes time to chop but worth it. I cut the oil by half and the vinegar by 25% so that it’s not so soupy.

Followed the oil and vinegar reduction and added a seeded jalapeño, he love heat. Surprisingly wasn’t that hot I’ll add extra next time. Amazingly perfect dish, don’t let the vinaigrette flavor alone make you question this. Love love love it!!!!

Loved this, but I made a few minor changes. I made the dressing, putting only half of the salt, and no sugar. After tasting it, I ended up putting the entire amount of salt as written. We like spicy, so I doubled the chili powder, and put numerous heavy shakes of hot sauce. It was tasty when I first made it yesterday, but is absolutely amazing today. It’s very yummy using it like a salsa with tortilla chips.

I forgot to buy corn and this was still a hit without it. I used smoked Tabasco for the hot sauce and added some liquid smoke. I'll definitely make this again.

As per usual took other reviewers advice and halved the dressing recipe and I’m glad I did!!! Still plenty, the original would have been way too much. This was amazing, made it for the Fourth and everyone loved it. Great on its own or as a chip dip/nacho topping, on tacos etc.

I made a couple of omissions by mistake and didn't combine the ingredients of the dressing.  Rather I added each item separately and it still turned out delicious!!  A great salad that can be spiced up!

The first time a made this recipe, I noted the comments that it resulted in too much liquid, so I cut down the oil and vinegar by a third. I found that the result was too dry.  So when I made it the second time, I followed the amounts in the recipe. I also added a lot more cilantro, as well as a little more cumin and chili powder, to kick up the spice. We also found that it is better if you make it at least one day ahead to allow it to marinate, stirring it occasionally, the results are better. If there is too much liquid when you serve it, just pour off the excess.

a great alternative to the pasta salads! this recipe is delicious. I used 3 cans of mixed beans and a 12 oz bad of corn. I added a little more garlic and juices of the lemon and lime and sprinkled salt and pepper to taste. Grabbed fresh cilantro from my garden! Super easy and quick to make. I will add fresh tomato's when they start popping up in my garden:) It's in the fridge and ready by for me to take to work, to snack healthy!

This was very easy to make and delicious. I reduced the recipe because I did not need to feed a crowd. I used only black beans, and reduced other ingredients accordingly. This was very good. We used left over bean salad as a topping for a tossed green salad the next day and was delicious.

I made this almost exactly as written and it was very good (forgot the hot sauce and used 1 red+1 yellow pepper). If I get to make this again, I might try to reduce the dressing ingredients by half, but I'm on the fence about it. This is definitely a good recipe to make the day before or early morning before an afternoon/evening party because Day 1 (after chilling 3-4 hours): Good, but getting strong hints of vinegar and citrus (lime/lemon); Day 2: Stirred it up and the vinegar and citrus are much calmer now. A little more sweet, but balanced. Addictive good; Day 3: Oil solidifying, stir it again and it's definitely more tame flavor wise, preferred it day 2. Still good, but should it let sit out a little and it will be fine. I'd definitely make this again for a party, but not as a side for just two people. However, it goes great with salads, in tacos, burrito bowls, as a side, and scooping with tortilla chips. Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent 3 Bean Salad - I had to use Balsamic Vinegar (it’s all I had). So I used less vinegar, less sugar and the same oil. Tastes amazing and looks beautiful!

My cans of beans were a little bigger so I rounded up spices etc. Awesome bean salad- I serve crackers/ chips with it too so it can be eaten either as a salad or s dip. I just use whatever beans I have - chickpeas / cans of combination of beans.

A delicious supper for an evening when it was too hot to cook! I used chick peas since I didn't have canneloni, and canned corn and it's great. I garnished with avocado and tomato because you can never have too much vegetables.

This is a common bean salad recipe. Except for the spicing! Yummy with a capital YUM! I switched to dried beans because of the high sodium (silent killer) content of canned beans.

Excellent! I took the suggestions of a few reviewers. I marinated the beans in the dressing 2 days before serving. The day before serving I added the remaining ingredients and on the serving day I added 2 diced avocados. We served it with chips on the side and everyone loved it!

I'd give this 3.5 stars- it's colorful and tasty, but the cilantro and red onion were a little overpowering for my taste. I put in a pretty generous dash of hot sauce and the chili powder, but it wasn't as spicy as I expected either. Might adjust some of the ratios and make it again another time.

I love this recipe!  I made it exactly as written, which is delicious.  I also made it with a few changes as a healthier alternative.  I omitted the oil and instead of sugar I used a dash of liquid stevia.  It turned out awesome.  I didn't miss the oil and sugar at all.

Simply delicious is all I can say!  Instead of using regular sugar I decided to use pure cane sugar.  However, this recipe is perfect for me.  As a gluten-free Vegan, I will gladly add this recipe to my catalog.

I modified this recipe a little and used pink beans instead of the cannelloni beans, use white onions, white vinegar. Served with tortilla chips. It is delicious and healthy!

I am not a bean person at all but I tried the recipe and it was delicious. I make the marinade and let it refrigerate overnight so that all the flavors blend together. Otherwise it just tastes like oil & vinegar to me ifI make it and immediately pour it over the beans. My whole family loves this and asks me to make it.

I love this recipe. The flavors meld perfectly. This is very tasty & refreshing! I've served this with tortilla chips to scoop as well as plain as a salad.

added other Mexican veggie I had on hand (tomatoes and radishes).  Delicious.  Even my teen daughter enjoyed it.  I took the leftover and added cream cheese and piled it on top of roasted acorn squash.  So good; so versatile.

Followed the recipe exactly except for the lime because I didn't have any. It was way too salty, greasy, and bitter from the vinegar. I was going to bring this to a small Mexican-themed dinner party, and I am so glad I decided to make a trial batch. I would have been embarrassed to serve it.

Solid, I would get rid of the hot sauce. also added 2 jalapenos for more kick.  Maybe less beans would be good next time.  Also pineapple could be good in this though it is already pretty sweet.  could negate sugar and add pineapple instead.

I often make this salad for get-togethers. My 4-quart bowl goes home  nearly empty, leaving just enough for a couple days of lunches. It's a big hit! Many times I will add cooked mini bow-tie pasta! We love this complete side. It's high protein.

Delicious healthy recipe! I eyeballed the oil and reduced to 1/4 cup red wine vinegar. No sugar to keep it healthy. Used onion salt (was out of onion) used only kidney, black beans, and corn, fresh lime. Loved it. Will go into my meal plan rotation. Great protein, flavor, and filling!

I really liked it! I personally like garlic a lot so I also added garlic powder. And instead of the chili pepper, I put in a pea size of sriracha. I'm not a person who likes spice but I love my rendition of this dish!

The flavor of the sauce is wonderful.   I however did not have any cannellini beans so I used garbanzo beans instead plus I added some cut green beans.    Very pretty salad and flavorful.

This is really good! Giving it 4 stars because the oil would have been an insane amount for this recipe. I used under 1/4 cup and easily could’ve used less. I used about 1/3 cup of vinegar, but I did half red wine vinegar and half apple cider vinegar for a little more delicate but flavorful taste. Used 2Tbsp sugar. Overall good, needs to be tweaked for sure or you’ll end up with oily bean soup.

I’ve made a version of this with just black beans. I love the addition of the other beans. I left out the sugar. I think the corn adds enough sweetness. I used a fresh poblano Pepper from our garden instead of the bell pepper. Made it the day before so the dressing has time to flavor the beans. I like the dressing too. Before, I would just wing it.

I took the advice of other reviewers and used only half the amount of oil and vinegar and it certainly seemed to be enough dressing. I wish I had omitted the sugar entirely. I only put in half the amount listed (one tablespoon instead of two), but it was way too sweet for my taste. I would suggest people begin with one teaspoon and increase the amount according to their own preference. Other than that, it is a nice, versatile recipe that went well with corn chips.

I made it exactly as in the recipe, and everyone loved it. Since the first time I made it, I've made it many times for pot-luck meals. It is always a hit--and the leftovers (if there are any) keep for several days. It's one of my go-to recipes for a healthy salad.

Unfortunately I did not have cilantro which would have made it ideal.  I used granulated garlic rather than chopped, and chopped fresh tomato.  Next time I will use less vinegar though as it was a bit overpowering,.   A good, colorful salad, but the cilantro is a must.

What a refreshing salad. The only change I made was to omit the salt. I was skeptical about the amount of oil, after reading some of the reviews, but you need liquid for it to marinate properly.Put it together either the night before or in the morning,  rinse and drain those beans really well,  chill and give it a stir occasionally. If it looks like too much liquid, drain a little before serving

I used just 1/4 cup of olive oil and 1/4 cup of red wine vinegar. I also used just half the sugar and salt. Because I love cilantro and spice, I doubled the chili powder and cilantro.  Served at a dinner party and it was a big hit.

Great proportions for dressing. Citrus Habanero Olive Oil and Expresso Vinegar and Sicilian Lemon Vinegar are at the base of my dressing.

I will make this again. Based on other comments I decreased sugar to about 1 3/4 T, and bell peppers to 1/2 each rather than whole. It was delicious and easy to put together!

Fantastic recipe! It's perfect as is and can serve as the basis of countless variations. I added extra garlic, some smoked paprika and served it with quinoa.

I only made one change - the cumin!  I didn't have any so none was added - I just increased the chili powder.  I can't believe I didn't have cumin - it's a pantry staple.
The dish was terrific and I hate to admit it - three of us ate the entire bowl.  We are having a bean experiences today.  Great receipe - next time there will be cumin!!!

After reading reviews I too reduced the oil and vinegar to 1/4 cup each,  the salt to 1 tsp., the sugar to 1 Tbsp. and left the rest of the recipe as is. We added it to street tacos and my family loved it. The flavors developed after refrigerated for awhile. Will definitely make again.

Very tasty!  I took some advice from other reviewers and halved the oil, vinegar, and salt.  I added extra chili powder and hot sauce because I like spiciness.

I made this as written. The dish came out  ok but way too vinegary for me. Next time, I'll have to either add more salt or better yet, cut way down on the vinegar. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Excellent flavor. You can halve the vinaigrette and still have plenty to coat the salad. When made with the full amount, you’ll be left with a ton sitting at the bottom of the bowl. I also added a chopped avocado. Yum!!

I haven't made this salad in quite some time, and the recipe I had wasn't as delicious as this one! I'm glad I decided to search for a better recipe! I definitely added a diced jalapeno.

Very colorful salad. The 1 TBL of salt is way too much salt. I threw out dressing and made another batch with only 1 tsp of salt; 1/4 cup red wine vinegar; 1/4 cup olive oil; leave rest of spices as stated in recipe. Better to leave salad overnight in refrigerator to marinate.

Best Mexican bean salad ever and the secret is the great sauce! I agree though, I could of made 1/2 of the sauce for the amount of beans and will next time. But the flavor of the sauce is really good.

Followed recipe closely except reduced the oil, vinegar, and sugar as others have suggested. Didn't have celery. Used three healthy dashes of hot sauce. It was a hit at a father's day cookout.

Very good, BUT waaaay too much dressing ... beans, corn and peppers were swimming in the liquid!! I took this to a potluck, and it was well received, but there was enough dressing floating in the bowl afterwards that could have been used for another time. I will either cut the dressing ingredients in half, or reserve half for another salad. Very tasty!!

Amazing flavors - even better than I expected. I worked backwards a bit. I started with the dressing minus the oil, and put the onions & garlic in there to pickle while I prepped the other ingredients. Then I whisked in the oil before adding the other ingredients. I also didn’t have green bell pepper, so I added a roasted poblano, and some celery for extra crunch. Such a great combo of flavors!

Omitted bell pepper, red wine vinegar and sugar for personal choice. Added finely chopped jalapeño, 1 tbsp olive oil (1/2 cup is overload), juice of 1/2 lemon, 1 tbsp ACV and a can of rotel. Delish!!!

Fantastic summer salad! Super tasty and easy to modify if you are missing any ingredients. I had to swap pinto beans for cannellini beans, and substituted cucumber and diced jalapeño for the corn and bell pepper and it turned out just fine. Next time I'd look at halving the dressing as it does make quite a bit.

This is such a tasty salad!  I kept coming back for more.  It has just the  right amount of heat, if you like a kick.  Ease back on the chili powder if you want it a bit milder.  I loved it as is, fresh and delicious.

I love this healthy bean salad! I live  alone so I found a can of
 6 bean medley and cut all the other ingredients down from 8 servings to 3. I used 1/2 can corn niblets and cut the sugar down to  a 1/2 teaspoon.  So delicious, especially the second day. 
My 3 servings looks more like 6 serving, btw.

Honestly never knew what to put in a bean salad but this recipe helped me out so much!  
I didn't add any olive oil or red wine vinegar because I personally didn't feel like it needed it and I also halved the spices (also a personal choice) but it came out amazing nonetheless!

I side with the reviewers who recommend less oil (I keep the vinegar, though, because I love tangy things). I also wish I had made this the night before I ate it, because it's SO much better when it's had a while to marinate! It's worth making it ahead of time.

This salad was terrific. As with many other reviewers I have to agree, the dressing needs to be cut in half and I also wouldn't add much sugar to the dressing either but that is simply my preference. I also added celery and mango to this salad.

Hello, yes, I made changes. I wanted a simple black bean and corn salad, not necessarily a bunch of other beans etc. and so on. So, I modified this recipe -- essentially, cut it in half and made some other changes. Wow, first off -- the lemon, lime and red wine vinegar were so acidic, even w/ the sugar, it was hard to take without wincing -- so, I slowly added some honey, tasted it and then -- added more. The addition of honey rounded out the dressing marinade, in my opinion and respectfully.  I just used one can of black beans and frozen corn that I thawed, cilantro, onion etc -- however, I tossed in some pepitos I had an on hand and thought that it added a nice crunch and earthiness to the salad. I also tossed in one cubanelle pepper that I charred over a gas flame on the stove (not sure I would do this again and if it was worth the trouble).  But, I did and tossed it in. Otherwise, it was really really good and I'll make it again with the honey addition and pepitos.  Cheers to all!

My husband I must be on a different planet because we thought this was horrible. I went exactly by recipe and it tasted too salty, too much cumin, too much red wine vinegar and olive oil- very bland. We took two bites and couldn't eat it!

I enjoyed this recipe, but I made some changes. I added lime zest and left out the lemon. I also cut back on the red wine vinegar. If you don't like a tart taste, I suggest you swap out the red wine for a milder vinegar. My husband loved it as is, but my boys prefer a milder acid and more spice.

Having read a number of reviews, I did reduce the oil and vinegar by half.  I should have also reduced the seasonings.  The cumin was overwhelming.  All in all, I was tasty, tho.

Great flavor!  Next time I will put the entire red onion in and cut back on the salt.  It was almost too salty but I saved it by putting it on a bed of romaine lettuce and adding a dob of sour crea.  Both helped cut down on the saltiness.

This bean salad was terrific! Even those who told me they weren't big fans of bean salads love it. I reduced the sugar to 1 tablespoon rather than 2. I had a can of fire roasted corn which I used rather than the frozen and that worked great in it. Had a number of people ask me for the recipe. Will definitely be making this again soon!

I halved the oil, vinegar, sugar as well and added fresh avocado and mango chunks.  It adds a freshness to it making it even better!  Super delish....

OMG, this is delicious. I made a few changes. I used jalapenos instead of green bell pepper (3 large ones), but other than that, I stuck to the recipe. I just made it last night and have already shared it with friends all over. this is a keeper.

Excellent taste. I don't like beans, but as a vegetarian I try to find ways to eat them & this salad is a winner. I used fresh corn as it's in season in Ohio right now & it added a nice crunch to the soft beans.

Tasty but I'd like it to have a stronger vinegar flavour. Maybe need to use cider or white vinegar. Makes a huge bowl too

This is really a versatile and substantial dish with many healthy ingredients. I served it with salmon fillets, and this could easily pair well with anything from hot dogs to chicken. I could eat this on its own for lunch too.

I took this to a pool party. It was a big hit! Many people brought chips & dip, or breaded & fried chicken tenders. Everyone enjoyed having a healthy, fresh, tasty side! Definitely a keeper! I made it exactly as the recipe instructed I do. I wouldn't change a thing!

It was Excellent. I made one small change to mine- I replaced the hot sauce and used some habenarro olive oil along with the regular olive oil. Had a nice kick but not to hot or spicy.

I love this recipe! I worked from dry beans rather than canned, just to save a few cents. I like that with dry beans there a little more structure and crunch (if you don't overcook them) rather than how canned beans can be a mushy. It adds time to the prep because I had to have them sit overnight, but you could look into quick cook. I didn't have cannellini beans on hand so I substituted pinto beans.
It tastes great and I estimate 18 servings for this salad.

The only change I made was fresh parsley for the cilantro because I was out of it. I made it early in the cool of the morning and it is great but I'm sure after setting in the refrigerator until supper time it will be even better.

This was so good! It was lunch for the week. It was amazing how versatile the recipe was even though it had a Mexican seasoning. I did leave out the cilantro (as my family doesn't care for the flavor, I know we're weird.) I am keeping this in my favorites and adding into the rotation of salads.

I served it to our neighbors and everyone loved it.  I had to share the recipe.  It is truly a great dish to share with friends and family.  I cut the salt in half and only used 1/2 Tbs.  which was plenty.  The beans I used were the no salt added variety.

I doubled the recipes and brought it to a party of 40 people. It was almost all gone and I was asked for the recipe a half dozen times. It's delicious! It's refreshing - perfect for an outdoor summer event.

I love this bean salad. I used celery instead of red onion. I only used 1 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp black pepper, then it came out great. I'll cook it for the next potluck.

This was delicious. I brought it to a Bar-b-que. Everyone loved it. The only thing I changed was cutting sugar and salt amounts in half and used Green Giant Niblets canned corn instead as that is what I had on hand. The fresh cilantro really makes the dressing outstanding. It will also keep several days in frig. 
Really loved this recipe. Thanks

My daughter wanted bean salad and  this recipe had most the ingredients we had on hand at home. Except the following: I used merken (a smoked chili pepper from Spain) instead of chili powder and used extra lemon instead of lime. I also did not have red wine vinegar so we used white wine vinegar. We used the large white butter beans for our white bean as well and used our cooked corn on the cob (just cut it off the cob)This was so delicious and perfect for a summer salad. We will use the left overs for out fish tacos tomorrow. Such great flavor and simple to make.

I made this for the first time to take to a potluck, based on all the wonderful reviews.  I tweaked it by adding a can of chick peas, some diced celery, shredded carrots and halved grape tomatoes.  I also marinaded the beans and chick peas in the dressing as suggested by another reviewer. I agree that the recipe makes a lot of dressing which is good when you're adding extra veggies.  Other than that I followed the recipe. It's a really colorful salad as well.   I hope everyone likes it......This could be a go-to favorite if it's a hit.

Took as a side to a potluck and it was well liked. The dressing flavors work well together. I added avacado, cheese cubes, and tomatoes.

Delicious flavor! I did halve the amounts of oil and vinegar, and it was still plenty of dressing. I also added twice as much lime juice, but I used a bottled juice, not fresh, so it was not enough flavor with only 2 tbl. as suggested.

Really, REALLY good. So much tastier than plain old bean salad! I used about a third cup of oil to the half cup of vinegar because I like a bit more tartness in salads, but I doubt that made a lot of difference.

I didn't have any bell pepper so I added a 4 oz. jar of pimiento well drained and had to use a can of corn also well drained.  Added 2 ribs of chopped celery for some crunch and reduced the red onion to 1/2.  Also reduced the sugar to 1 Tbs. and the cumin and chili powder to 1/4 tsp.  Still a little strong for my taste and will reduce to 1/8 tsp. next time.  Made this morning and waiting until tomorrow to give my final taste evaluation.  Good taste but will probably not make again.  Tasted much better after the flavors mellowed over night.  Definitely use fresh or frozen corn.  Update after 3 days--tastes great!  Changed my rating from 4 to 5 stars.  Definitely a make-ahead dish.

Loved this recipe!  Even my daughter who doesn't like "spice" enjoyed it.  It is so healthy and I didn't have white beans in a can but had them dry, so I cooked them for about 38 minutes in my pressure cooker allowing for natural pressure release.  Took an hour but I just prepped the rest of the dinner (shrimp tacos with this Mexican Bean Salad) and added the white beans at the end after running under cook water.  The red onions mellowed out very well in this mix so my daughter didn't think it was spicy.  It makes a good amount so I shared some with our neighbors so they could eat it fresh!

Just made today but used dry cilantro instead of fresh because I didn't want to run to the store for one item.  I think it would be tastier with fresh but was still delicious! I only used one tablespoon of sugar instead of two. There is a lot of dressing but I used a slotted spoon and like it this way so it marinates. Colorful, delicious and healthy. Will make again.

Great recipe.  Complex flavor and well balanced ingredients.   Some (healthy) changes I've made after making it a couple times:  reduced olive oil to 1/3 cup, reduced salt to 1/2 tsp and added 1/2 tsp KCl (a.k.a. NoSalt).  Absolutely no reason for this to have a TABLESPOON of salt.  I also reduce the vinegar to 1/3 cup.

Made the recipe as stated, but substituted a can of corn for the frozen, because that's what I had on hand. Delicious! This makes a lot and lasts up to a week in the frig just fine.

Really tasty with good texture and appearance, but a bit on the sweet side.  I think next time I will try 1/2 the sugar.  Also, I used half the oil and only a dash of Lawrey's  Seasoning  Salt (instead of the tablespoon of salt called for in the recipe).  Even though it is a bit too sweet, I can't stop eating it!

This is a fantastic recipe!!! We follow a vegan diet and its so great to have this to hand to round out baked potatoes, pasta, veggie burgers, etc. I use the small firm assorted peppers that come in the cello bag--they are perfect for this. I like great northern beans, but any beans will do. The addition of canned corn is a nice flavor boost, and a bit quicker too. I have also added cooked small shells, cavatappi, etc. This is divine with an extra drizzle of hot sauce, served over a baked potato, or fried spice tofu cubes!!!

I thought this was a great side to go with my brisket.  It was very refreshing.  I think this for sure needs to be served cold.  I will make this again.

Having read some of the reviews, I only added half of the oil & half the vinegar called for. It came out perfect in my opinion, I made it for a large group of people so I doubled the recipe. It was gone fast!

Yum! Cut both oil and vinegar to 1/4 cup each and also cut salt and pepper. (More can be added to taste by guests.)

You will never make another bean salad again. You will stop your search. This is the one. It's fresh, it's tangy. It's really a gorgeous flavour. I cut down the salt by half and went a tiny bit lighter on the chilli but if you like your food salty and with a bite, leave as is. Highly recommended.

We all loved it.  Even my picky eater!  The only thing I did was cut the oil down a lot.  I may have added 2-3 tablespoons, if that. This will be a go too salad!

Very good zesty salad. Good mix of spices. I am a salt fanatic but even I would reduce the salt to 2 tsp.  Otherwise it is actually closer to 5 stars. I will be making this again.

I made a double recipe so I could take some to a potluck lunch and keep some for home.  The only tweak I did was to use red onion so it would not be too strong.  Very tasty.

Awesome! I'd not paid attention to the # of servings, so made the entire thing for 2 people, and when I saw how much was in the bowl I was wary, but supposed we could have some leftovers at least. Nope! Ate it all in one night :D

I did halve the vinegar and oil, use a tad less sugar, and I used maybe 1/5 of the onion instead of a whole red onion.

I made this because I just couldn't understand how high the rating was. I mean, I was interested in the recipe, but the 1500ish reviews  at 5 star tipped it over the edge. SERIOUSLY IT'S SO GOOD THOUGH!! I created an account just to review it. I used a jalapeno instead of the hot sauce, but the rest of it was the same. The SAUCE was awesome. I want to drink it I swear. I'm excited to have this huge bowl of it to eat for the rest of the week.

Have made it many times. Used 50/50 salad vinegar and Balsamic vinegar because I was out of wine vinegar, don't use green peppers because I don't care for them and the company still loved it.

This is really delicious and super easy to make!  I omitted the green peppers since I'm not a fan.  Just before serving and diced up avocado.  There seemed to be more dressing than necessary so next time I make this I'll reduce  both the oil and vinegar to about 1/3 cup.

This salad was great! I added a little less ground pepper than the recipe called for only because I use a peppermill and find that sometimes it can be a bit overpowering compared to pre-ground. We LOVED this recipe and I plan on making it so many more times in the future. It was so good!!!! Thanks Karen for sharing!

This recipe is a knockout.  Deeeelicious.  Made per the recipe except for not having any lime juice on hand so we subbed lemon juice. I think it needs the lime juice but certainly no one missed it.  For others who may not know it, as I did not know, Cannellini beans are white kidney beans.  Made this as part of a Mexican meal for our Sr Ctr lunch, and everyone loved it.

I love this! I'll make it on a Sunday so we can pick at it throughout the week. I could eat this all day. I don't make any changes and I start eating it right out of the bowl as soon as it's put together. Of course everything is better the longer it sits but I'm too impatient. I absolutely HATE cilantro and always leave it out of recipes except for this one. It isn't that strong and it works well with the other flavours.

I followed the recipe exactly, just halving the dressing and it turned out to be perfect. The hot sauce is exactly what you need to kick up a beans and vegetable salad. Cumin powder is a great addition! Will definitely repeat this.

Excellent! I, like some other reviewers cut back a lot on the oil. I halved it but kept the same amount of vinegar and citrus. You don't need to add a full tbsp of salt in my opinion. That would have been waaaay too salty. One tsp is enough.  I didn't have lemon so I just used lime and it was great. I also added avocado at the end and that seemed to be a hit with the crowd I served it too as well. Thanks for the great recipe!

So easy to make and so flavorful.  The recipe makes a huge salad so make sure you have a large crowd to feed before making this recipe.  Great side to compliment a variety of meals.

I had to modify as  I didn't  have red beans nor green peppers on hand. Instead, I  used the other two beans and a yellow pepper. In addition, I threw in a 4 oz can of La Preferida green chilies roasted with garlic.  Everyone enjoyed the dish and two guys requested the recipe!  I brought home an empty bowl.  I made tortilla chips available which everyone also enjoyed as an accompaniment.

Added black eyed peas and everybody wants it to take home after the party.  Great Bean salad recipe with outstanding taste.  You can heat it up, taste wise. with more hot sauce or let everyone add their own hot sauce  individually.

Substituted garbanzo beans for white beans, increased to juice of 2 limes, juice of 1 lemon and added an additional tablespoon of sugar.

I wasn't so keen on this and would personally rate it 2*, but my mum loved it so I bumped up the rating a little. I tried the dressing before adding it to the salad and added a bit more sugar as it was a bit too tangy, but after the added sugar it was nice. I guess I didn't like the base of the salad combined with the dressing, but since my mum loved it, it must just be a matter of taste.

Made this for a summer cookout. Very pretty salad. I made half of the dressing per some other reviews, and found that to be plenty.  It was very good, and I will make it again.

Was a big hit.  Brought half to a small gathering.  The half we had for ourselves and was even better the following day (2).  Omitted the cilantro as no one is a fan in my family.  Also next time I may reduce the cumin to 1/4 teaspoon as it was coming through a little to strong.  Maybe because I didn't add the cilantro.

Followed the recipe almost exactly except I didn't have cannellini beans so I subbed garbanzo beans.  Next time I would add less dressing as some of the other reviewers suggested (read that too late!!).  Otherwise this looks and tastes amazing!

Turned out great!  Because I had not made before and needed servings for 10, I added 1 cucumber diced and 1 10oz package of grape/cherry tomatoes quartered.  Definitely enough dressing. Omitted the hot sauce.

The beauty of this recipe is the flexibility to add and subtract with what's in the pantry.  I agree that there is too much dressing but I added a can of garbanzos and a can of pinto beans.  Lovely presentation, healthy and delicious.

I love this recipe. It is my go to for potlucks. I have also changed some things around to better suit my crowd. I use about half the amount of onion and skip the cilantro and hot sauce. I make the dressing as stated but put it in my salad dressing shaker and only put about half the amount on at first. If it looks a little dry I add a little more. The leftover dressing is great for taco salad or on a nice bed of spring mix and veggies. I really love this recipe!!!

Cut the sugar, vinegar and oil in half. Seemd just right,   Used a bit less onion.  It was good and I would likely make it again.  Maybe after it sits overnight the flavor will get even better.... I will bump to 5 stars if so!

Everyone loved it, but there was way too much liquid. I had to drain before serving.  I reduced the amount of oil and vinegar a bit, based upon a previous comment. I think I need to let the beans drain longer.

Excellent! Made it according to recipe except only used one tsp of salt.  Prepared a day before. Will definitely make it again....and again!

The salad was a success! Everyone loved it.
Will have to make a double batch next time so we have some leftovers. ;o)
I added a couple of chopped celery stalk and it went well with the other ingredients.
Next time, I think I will cut back on the sugar as it was a tad too sweet.

A friend at work made this. Generally I don't like bean salad but this was delicious. I read all the reviews and cut the oil, vinegar and spices in half as suggested.  Since I never have hot sauce on hand,  I omitted it.  I used only one orange bell pepper. I read about the beans and so I drained rinsed them from the can.  I would definitely make it again. Thanks everyone for the suggestions.

Just finished making this recipe and have to say it is definitely a keeper. I followed the recipe and wouldn't change a thing. It goes really well with tortilla chips and a sliced avocado on the side. So glad I found this one!

I will make this again because it tastes phenomenal but it makes way too much dressing for the salad.  I also added chopped avocado right before serving.

I made this to take to a cookout and everyone loved it, even people who said they don't like beans said it was good! The only change I made was to leave out the cilantro (don't like it) and I added some crumbled bacon on top.

My favourite salad recipe so far! I add a whole  lime and some extra coriander and use less than 1/4 cup of oil. I also substituted the hot pepper stuff with gochujang (korean red pepper paste). Worked out really well!

I made this pretty much as the recipe stated. I only added cayenne and more cilantro. A good basic recipe ( I like spicy) to add other veggies too. Such as avocado, tomato, celery, etc.

Way too much oil and vinegar. I didn't care for the flavor of the uncooked spices and olive oil that coated this salad, and thought it was too acidic. I might try again and use vegetable oil and maybe some beets for sweetness.

I followed the recipe the first time omitting the hot sauce only because I knew one person wouldn’t eat it if it had heat; he liked it.  Since then I’ve added the hot sauce, and depending on the people I was serving, I’ve doubled the chili powder (Mexican), all to rave reviews.  This is an excellent recipe that can be modified to suit your crowd!  I’ve had numerous requests for the recipe so it’s obviously a keeper!

I've made this salad many times and it is always a hit. I use golden balsamic vinegar instead of red wine and found I didn't need the sugar at all.  This recipe is healthy, keeps well, and travels well. It can be made ahead of time....what's not to love?

The recipe by itself had way too much of the dressing, which is fine because if you eat it with chips you can just scoop the solids out.

This is an absolutely delicious recipe. I make it with some frequency as my family loves it and it's a good source of fiber and protein. I'm not a great lover of cilantro, but otherwise followed recipe. Highly recommend.

It looked like it would be good and the reviews were good, so I gave it a try. The only thing I changed was I added only half an onion. (I'm just not a big fan of raw onion, generally.) It was delicious! I really didn't expect to like it quite as much as I did. Even my husband, who is usually luke warm to salads, remarked that it was really good. I will definitely be making this again.

Loved this recipe. I made the dressing separately and and I'm glad I did because it would have been too much my liking. I added a little celery for added crunch.

I used white wine vinegar instead of red.  It was fantastic.  I paired it with a guacamole recipe and let people dip tortilla chips in either one or both and it was so good it was addicting.

Delicious! I also followed other reviewers and halved the oil and vinegar. I will remove even more next time...way too much liquid. Great flavor, I added chick peas to mine too. Doesn't last but 2 days max because the onions get soggy. Will make again, especially now that summer is coming.

Awesome recipie. I have some pickey eaters in the family, but even they enjoyed it! Great summer recipe to cool off with. Definitely going to make it again. I made it with a little extra corn the second time I made it since I thought it needed a tad bit more.

Didn't have frozen corn so I blanched 3 shucked ears fresh corn (covered) in pan of boiling water for 4 min.  Drain and let cool until it can be cut off cob.  No green pepper so I used yellow one.  Otherwise, I made recipe as printed and it is EXCELLENT!  I am going to put it in sterilized quart -size Mason Jars so it can keep longer in refrigerator.  Tip:  ALWAYS use clean spoon when removing some from jar if it won't be used all at once.  I wouldn't change one thing with this recipe but it does lend very well to substitutions if necessary.

Loved this! Used about 3/4 of the dressing and added extra chilli and a heap extra coriander (nearly the whole bunch!). I mixed some of the coriander with the dressing and the rest in with the beans and veg. I also cut the salt down by half and the sugar by about a quarter.

I LOVE this recipe! I make it all the time! I leave out the cilantro because I'm not a big fan and change up the beans to whatever I have on hand. This is great on it's own, in a taco, or as a dip! YUM!

Have made this salad several times and it is excellent!! The first time I made it I found it too be too salty for our liking. So I have made a few changes that have really upped the wow factor for this salad. I halved the salt, omitted the hot sauce, and increased the sugar to 5 Tbsp to give it just a subtle sweetness, everything else I kept the same. My family always asks for this salad for every occasion....it really is exceptional. Thanks for sharing! :)

Thank you for this perfect salad. I was asked to bring a salad for a Mexican-themed Christmas potluck. Soooo good! I doubled the cumin and chili and used honey instead of sugar. Roasted corn hack: After shucking the corn, blacken the cob on your gas burner. It takes about a minute and you get a nice char on the corn without having to turn on your BBQ. I added avocado and two types of Mexican cheese. I will definitely make this again.

I cut the recipe in half and still had lots left over after serving 6 who all took healthy portions.  I could easily have served 10.  Also, I used 2 cans mixed beans.

Really tasty. Since I didn't have much of an option of pepper or onion sizes at the store I didn't use a whole green pepper or onion. I chopped parts of them up, added them to the bowl and then mixed it up. Once it got to the consistency/ratio that looked good to me, I stopped adding more. It still had plenty of zing too. I'll make it again for sure.

I enjoy bean salads of many kinds, and this is no exception. I followed the recipe exactly, except I didn't have red peppers.  I even measured the dressing ingredients, which is rare for me.  The dressing is wonderful, really enjoyed the combination of citrus and it complements the ingredients perfectly.  It does make a bit too much dressing. You definitely want to let it sit an hour or two at least before serving. Despite the directions saying to "serve cold"I much prefer these types of salads at room temperature, I believe the flavors are more pronounced. This makes a ton so luckily left overs are even better than the day made. Loved this salad.

Made this recipe for the first time minus the peppers and chili powder. Substituted regular white onion for red onion because I forgot to pick one up and it turned out good still!

Used as a Thanksgiving dinner side. Added molasses, just because. Didn't have cilantro on hand so I used scallions;  too busy to pound some garlic, used granulated instead. Added balsamic vinegar. Still came out great!

This is one of my new "go-to" recipes. I first made it for a Mexican themed girls weekend and we served it both as as side dish at dinner and again at lunch the next day. Everyone loved it and several have since made this same recipe. My entire family loves it which is a hard feat to achieve. I've also used this as a base for other recipes creating burritos and nachos when I have left over salad. I often don't even use the dressing it's so fabulous plain. 
I also keep the dressing on the side as it keeps longer.

This is a delicious mix with tons of fiber. That said, a whole onion, even a small one is a bit much, will only use a half onion next time and be sure to cut into tiny pieces.

This is a great, refreshing recipe.  I did not have a green bell pepper, but I had plenty of celery on hand so I diced up some celery and also used the leaves.  And as always I completely forgot to add hot sauce to my grocery list, so hahaha :) ....I found a packet of buffalo sauce from a chicken wing restaurant and added that to the recipe.  So typical of me so forget to get something from the store, but hey it worked.  
It is a very tasty recipe.  Thanks All Recipes, I can always find something that every family member enjoys.  :)  I also topped the salad with diced avocado on the top.  Delicious.

I made this for four servings. So I used one can red kidney beans and one can great northern beans. I used red and orange peppers (not a fan of green) plus I added jalapeño instead of hot sauce. Definitely doesn't need one tablespoon of salt, and I cut back on the oil, as per someone else's suggestion. Full of protein and flavor. Everyone loved it!

I usually substitute fresh cilantro for 1 tbsp of dried cilantro and instead of fresh lemon and lime juice I use bottled lemon juice.  Still tastes wonderful and you really can’t tell the difference.

This is so delicious! I've made this many times. I start out with less sugar and salt than the recipe calls for and then add more to taste. I also add less pepper and omit the hot sauce since I'm usually making it for other people. Oh, and it does make a lot of dressing. I think you could get away with cutting the oil and vinegar in half. Thank you for a great recipe!

Trying to get more fiber in hubby's diet, so I tried this out.  I only used one can of kidney beans, and one can of corn...used 1/4 cup evoo and 1/4 cup red wine vinegar and 1 tbsp. lime juice, used sugar and cumin to taste and omitted chile powder and lemon juice.  Also used parsley since my cilantro is no longer with us (RIP).  FANTASTIC side with chicken quesadillas! Great acidity.  Very refreshing!  I don't think you can screw this up - great guideline recipe.

I love marinated bean salads, and this is the best I've made!  I halved the recipe and left out the green pepper due to personal taste.  It has a very fresh taste and leftovers will keep for several days in the refrigerator.  Will be making this again.

Very good. I made it with less beans, more corn and added some tomatoes and cucumber. I am sure it is all not done in the Mexican kitchen, but it sure was tasty.

This is one of my favorite salads to make- I make a bit less dressing, and sometimes substitute other types of beans, but it is always delicious!

Easy to make and very tasty. I like to maker his salad the day before and leave it in the fridge. I will probably use half the dressing next time just because the bottom got really juicy. Still, very good flavor.

I made this for a pot luck at my daughter's school as a vegetarian main dish. It was a big hit and was one of the few dishes that were completely devoured.  It was deliciously bright and flavorful and would work well in a number of formats, such as with tortilla chips, in lettuce cups, on a green salad, etc.  The only alterations I made were 1) used canola oil rather than olive oil based on flavor preference, 2) minced a few tablespoons of pablano pepper for kick, 3) used fresh corn, and 4) skipped the green pepper.   I agree with other reviewers that this produces a lot of liquid but it can be drained off  before serving. Will make this again and again.

By far the best Mexican bean salad I've made. The red wine vinegar is what makes this recipe in my opinion. I don't like things spicy so I was going to omit the chili powder but after tasting the dressing it definitely needed it. I did use less than the recipe called for, just enough to add flavor.

Amazing! This is the best bean salad ever! I couldn't even let it Set & chill  before devouring a small bowl, it smells heavenly! 
I Made minor substitutions as I didn't have cannellini beans or frozen corn. I omitted the beans and added about a cup and half of sliced grape tomatoes instead, and used a can of corn. I also omitted sugar and used 1tbls of Splenda. There is also way to much dressing, but like all bean salads I've ever made it should be served with a slotted spoon. Enjoy :)

I followed the recipe exactly except for the cilantro. I used dried cilantro but this is still very delicious. Next time I will use fresh cilantro as that would probably enhance the flavor. I also add more hot pepper sauce once it is on the dish.

This is definitely my favorite bean salad. Simple to make and full of flavor. Tastes great by itself, but I also enjoyed it on top of a baked potato. I made the recipe exactly as shown.

I used orange and red peppers. Best with fresh corn and beans but if you don't have time, it's still great with canned. I used several "splashes" of hot sauce. This recipe is a keeper!

Phenomenal recipie. I had a bag of 12 bean and it worked fine. I also didn't have lemon/lime on hand but added a Tbs of OJ instead. Beautiful and fresh. Can't wait to serve it a side or with some small pasta as a lunch.

Delicious!  It was a huge hit.  Even with my husband who made a face when I originally showed him the recipe.  The only change I made was I substituted pink beans because I didn't have cannellini beans on hand.  I will definitely be making this again!

This was absolutely delicious! Multiple people asked me for the recipe after a graduation luncheon. I was able to put it together very quickly, and it was great to have a no-cook side dish that I could chill, then let it sit out all day without any refrigeration needed. We chopped some fresh tomato into the leftovers and used them to top quesadillas the next night. Yum!

This is one salad that I make over and over again. I love to add jalapeno peppers and avocado to it as well. Often I will sub garbanzo beans for the cannelloni beans. This is a great make ahead salad as it tastes better the longer it chills. I usually use the small bell peppers that come in different colors in the bag and what ever onions I have on hand. My family loves this salad and it tastes great as healthy bean salsa with tortilla chips.

This really is a delicious recipe for an attractive salad.  I made it this afternoon for a potluck exactly as written except for substituting green onion for red.  I also added some sliced olives.  It only had a little more than an hour in the refrigerator before the dinner but the flavor was still excellent.  I was hoping there would be a little left afterwards to enjoy again tomorrow but it was completely gone before the end of the dinner.   Guess I'll just have to make another recipe!   Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe!

I should have halved the dressing because the beans end up swimming in it.  But good and it does not take 1.25 hours to make-not at all.  the list of ingredients can be intimidating but they really aren't that bad! :)

I love this recipe. It keeps well in the fridge for a few days, and with some feta on top it really stands on its own or as a side dish.

Very good and colorful salad that is different from ordinary salads you see at BBQ's.  I made as written, and just stirred often to get the olive oil mixed in well.  I think it would be too dry if reduced.  Everyone loved and raved about it.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Like previous reviewers I reduced the oil and vinegar to 1/3 cup each and it was perfect.  I also used garbonzo beans instead of cannellini and marinated the beans for a day before I added the vegetables then let it sit overnight in the fridge.  
Everyone loved it and most took seconds... including me!

my brother made this for the family and I must say it's amazing. I cannot get enough of it! Best bean salad I've ever had for sure. I 100% recommend this for all, even people that don't especially like beans. I'm not the biggest fan of beans but I just can't stop raving about this recipe!

My family really enjoyed this salad. I used Stevia instead of sugar. I used all fresh juices. I did not add cilantro because I don't like the taste of it. But besides that, it was really tasty. And good for you too.

Ok so I am a new person to eating beans and this recipe is the bomb. I made this with just a little less sugar due to incorporating this into the slow carb diet. I didn't even chill it or wait. I ate it fresh and it is still good. Can't wait till I have more tomorrow. Love that you can make it spicier or eat it mild.

Taste great!  Left out the onions and bell peppers.  I used extra sweet red peppers and added garbanzo beans!  Turned out great!

This is a lot of salad, so you may want to half the recipe if you're single like me! Although it's so good, I make the full amount and eat it for 1-2 weeks. I always put only half the sugar because the corn is sweet enough. I don't like the white beans as much so I put half a can and extra black beans. You don't need different colors of bell pepper bc they all taste the same but it is prettier with the not-green ones. ;) I also put half the olive oil and it's still amazing. Try frozen roasted corn! I got a bag at trader joe's.

So delicious. I don't put in as much cumin it has such a strong flavor , and add peppers to your liking. I also make extra dressing to use on salads. Soo good.

Although it is almost impossible for me to stay with a recipe, I stood as closely as possible to this sauce and I am glad I did.  The beans & corn and whatever else you choose to add, is just accompaniment to this wonderful sauce mix.  It is sweet and hot and with the crunch and tail end heat, delicious

Whoops, I sent my comment before finishing :) just wanted to say, if you don't have all the beans or missing something, just be sure to follow the recipe for the dressing exactly.. it's sooooo good, and if you have extra you can always use it for a marinade for meat or chicken

I followed this recipe to the T. Fantastic mixture of flavors. I made the recipe for serving of 16 for an employee lunch gathering which serves more than sixteen. Needed the largest bowl I have. Make it the day before, stir. You won't be sorry you tried this recipe.

Really good even better second day after beans absorbed more flavor. I left my onion pieces large enough to be "picked" out by people who can't eat them in my household.

I don't like beans but my husband does so I thought I'd make this for him. I tried one bite and I was hooked. We both LOVE this salad. It's also great to bring to a pot luck, picnic, barbecue, etc. You can make it a day in advance and chill it overnight in the fridge to give the flavors a chance to mingle. I think it tastes better the next day.

This is fantastic.  I followed the suggestions of previous reviewers to make it a little less oily, but then the second time I made it I forgot.  Cutting it is better, but it's good either way!

Delicious!  Only changes I make are: reduce salt to 1 tsp (1 TBSP seems like a lot), sub Splenda for sugar, sub 1 tsp garlic powder for the clove of garlic. Also makes a great soup with the leftovers...just add water and enjoy the aroma as it heats up.  Serve with nice bread and salad for an easy meal!

An excellent recipe! I don't usually measure ingredients, but I'm sure I use quite a bit less oil, vinegar and sugar. After making this recipe a few times I've adapted it for whatever I have handy- sometimes a little celery for crunch or some cubed avocado and its an entire meal. Another adaption that I really like is grilling some corn on the cob and bell peppers and using them, the charred vegetables give it a really nice flavor for summer!

Just made this salad for a get-together tonight and before putting it in the fridge to chill, I took a spoonful. It was delicious!!! If it's this good BEFORE all the flavors meld together I can't imagine how good it's going to be tonight! Can't wait! Oh, and I agree, two pepper is one too many. One is just fine.

My first reaction when I hear "bean salad" has always been sort of .... ehhhh. My cousin's b/f made this recipe and coaxed me into trying it and it darn near blew my socks off with astonishment. He directed me to this website and so I made it myself, and BOOM, yum! It's so simple and delicious and now all my friends want it. This recipe is a keeper people! Just make sure you're in a properly ventilated room for the hours that follow, in fact, I recommend being outside if possible. lol.

I make this all the time because it's so good.  I changed it to balsamic vinegar, just lime juice, no lemon juice, add in either a Serrano or Habanero pepper, a dash of salt, and no sugar.  So delicious with a kick.

I wasn't sure how this dish would turn out, having had experience previously with similar dishes, all of which rated "ho-hum" in my book. This dish, however, really surprised me.

Other than cutting the oil, vinegar and sugar in half as suggested in many other reviews, coupled with allowing the beans to marinate for a day, I made the recipe as-written. The end-result was delicious and even my wife, who hates all things legume, admitted that it was very tasty and that it almost made her forget her dislike of beans. That in and of itself is a huge endorsement.

I've made this recipe twice now and both times it has turned out terrific. This is now my go-to recipe any time that I need a good salad of this type for any event. Yum!

Made this recipe for the first time last week as my husband and were looking for healthier side dishes. I took this dish to a cookout yesterday and it was a hit.  This bean salad is very good. I reduced the oil and red wine vinegar by half. I also reduced the sugar by half and reduced the salt to 1/2 to 3/4 tbsp. Salt can always be added if more is needed. I also added a little more cumin and chili powder just because we like those spices.

This is not the typical boring bean salad.  I made it as a side to expand a family taco dinner and it served six adults and two kids with very little left over.  I followed the recipe exactly (except I used a yellow pepper instead of a green because that was what I had)and the sugar and salt were just fine. I agree with the reviewer who said this is better after the first day.  I just ate the dab that was left over from two nights ago, and it was even better.  I was wondering how it would taste with a little mango added.  My daughter-in-law suggested adding avocado.  That might be good, too!

I followed the recipe to a tea as well and yum! I have never been a fan of bean salad until now! I made it last week and I am making it again tomorrow! It makes a lot and it is so fresh and flavorful. I rarely give 5 stars to a recipe but this one deserves it! I did have some vinegar / oil at the bottom of the bowl so I will try making it with 1/2 the amount tomorrow to see what I like more. I'm thinking by making it with the full amount it may marinate everything better so i am a bit hesitant on only using half. I will repost once I see how it goes.

Wonderful salad. Just wonderful. Very tasty although I did cut back on the sugar/Splenda. The first time I made it I used the hot pepper sauce (Sriracha). I skipped it the second time and could not really tell a difference.

Will make this again without so much oil and vinegar. Used Southwest canned corn, good in the recipe.  Added lots more chili powder, though.  Left out the sugar due to being a diabetic.  Son loved it, said it was so colorful and tasty.

This was good. It had a bit too much dressing so I would suggest to pour some out before serving and use a slotted serving spoon. I agree that it is best when made a day or two in advance.

Great recipe!  Very light and tasty!  I substituted for what I had laying around...black beans, northern beans, and lentils, and a yellow bell pepper instead of green. I also halved the oil, used 1/3 of the salt, and left the sugar out entirely... it was still delicious!  I will definitely be making this again!

I love this salad so much. I've made it several times and anyone who tries it says it is good. I only use 1/4 c. each of the oil and vinegar and sometimes add in extra beans and corn - just personal preference. There is still some "juice" left that it all soaks up. So easy but so good. Thanks for the recipe.

This makes a great summer salad!  I added halved cherry tomatoes, and, since I'm not a cilantro lover, I left it out, and the salad still had a wonderful flavor.  Thanks for sharing it.

This is delicious!  I didn't have any green peppers so I used a yellow pepper in its place.  So yummy.  I brought it to a luncheon and was asked several times for the recipe.

Used 1 tbsp sugar, omitted cilantro and hot pepper sauce- still tasted pretty awesome! Lime to lemon ratio was off because of the size of each fruit but it was good regardless.

I leave out the corn, but this is a fantastic bean salad.  It takes a lot lot longer than 15 minutes of prep time to gather ingredients, open cans, prepare the dressing and prepare and combine the separate ingredients.

This was very good! I halved the oil and vinegar, per many people's recommendations, and ended up using 1 1/2 large bell peppers and only 1 Tbsp of sugar.  Used a can of (drained) corn to save time, which also worked very well.  All the other amounts were followed.

This was great on its own and would probably be even better as a side to a meat dish.  Would probably also be great with chips or over tostadas.  Will definitely make this again!

Very good recipe. I cut the dressing in half like others had suggested. Eliminated the green pepper as well and only used 1 tablespoon of sugar. I used pinto beans instead of cannellini beans. Very delicious!!!!

Very good, but would have to adjust the oil, acidity of the red wine vinegar, lemon, lime juice based off taste palate. For spice level, if you don't eat spicy, then the chili powder is not needed, only a dash amount of hot sauce. I only made half the amount, using black beans, pinto beans, one red bell pepper only since it's more sweet than green bell pepper. I defrosted the corn in the microwave to save time. I prefer my salad to have a mild onion taste, therefore one shallot was used instead for half the recipe. The added zest from the citrus fruits really enhanced the sauce. Will definitely make again. This tasted even better then next day from the ingredients marinating in the sauce.

Very good, but a little bland. I added Pico de Gallo seasoning and that made it just right.  You can use any beans that you have on hand. I used garbanzo, black and kidney beans and a can of corn.

Yum!!  This is so good, and it makes a ton!  Followed the directions exactly, except instead of sugar, I substituted 2 tbsp. of honey (I always do this with dressings, personal preference.) This recipe is a little labor-intensive, but well worth it. We made it on Sunday, kept it in the fridge, and brought it for lunch and/or had it with dinner throughout the week. Such a great way to stretch out meals and get veggies into your diet!  Will make many more times.

I was getting sad because I recently was diagnosed with prediabetes and I started thinking of all the foods that I need to avoid now. This recipe has a low glycemic index and cheered me right up! So savory! I did what other users suggested (very glad I did!) and halved the sugar, oil, and vinegar. I also used a can of garbonzo beans to replace the corn and soaked all of the beans for a half hour to reduce the sodium. Definitely a keeper!

I did not change a thing on this recipe and it was AMAZING!  Big hit at a our Father's Day cook out. A light, refreshing, tangy flavor.  It says it is 8 servings, but it was fine for at least 12.

I did not have an excess of liquid like some people did - even with the frozen corn.  I may try using a flavor infused olive oil next time to see how it goes.

Delicious recipe, however, based on other writers reviews, I also halved the oil, sugar, and vinegar--I feel I almost could have used even less. Truly delicious once the modifications have been made however!!

This is my go-to dish for potlucks, BBQs, and teacher "salad" luncheons. It's looks pretty, it tastes delicious, and it can hold up to staying out on a table for a good long while.  I tell you this, *every single time* I've made this people (plural) have sought me out or emailed me for the recipe.  Last month I dropped it off for a High School teacher appreciation luncheon and a friend texted me that it was the big hit.  That's why I always leave the recipe and/or direct them to allrecipes.com. I'm making it tomorrow for a church cookout, and thought I'd write my first review, despite being an AllRecipes member for years!

LOVE IT! I needed to sub white wine vinegar for red wine vinegar since I was all out, and I decreased the salt to 1 tsp. Left it in the fridge overnight. DELICIOUS! I've been looking for a bean recipe for awhile now & I've finally found THE one. Thank you!

I don't think I've ever been asked for a recipe so often! Crowd pleaser for sure. I didn't have fresh cilantro so used dried, but other than that followed the recipe to the letter. Lots of dressing, but I think it's good like that. Serve with a slotted spoon and you're fine.

This is an awesome recipe!  I made it as written BUT, didn't have chili powder so used some Sriracha sauce, and voila! worked like a charm.  Remember to taste as you go if you use that stuff, though ... the heat will sneak up on you.  Also, I put half the bean mixture into a gallon plastic bag - then dumped half the dressing on it, then filled it with the rest of the beans/peppers/onion and poured the last of the dressing over everything.  'Massaged' it all to get everything coated and stuck it into the fridge overnight (although I did pull out a little a couple hours later just to see if it was okay and happily, it tasted wonderful)  The finished product is something your family and friends will definitely appreciate - it went over really well with my husband and he's not what you'd call a huge bean fan.

A good recipe for a make-once, eat-all-week lunch. I'm not usually a fan of beans/bean salads, but I thought I'd give this a try since it seemed healthy and filling while still being convenient and easy. After making it last night and having a portion for lunch today, I've added this one to my recipe box to make again. While I wouldn't rave about this as some others have, the flavors are interesting enough that I don't think I'll get sick of it even after eating it all week (a problem I have a lot with eat-all-week lunches). I followed the recipe as written, but didn't add any hot sauce/chili powder since I can't handle the heat! As almost all others have noted, the amount of dressing is a little excessive/unnecessary so I'll probably cut that in half next time. Otherwise, I thought the flavors were good and I wouldn't change a thing.

I cooked it without cilantro and onion, still delicious. Although I do not understand why did we need parsley. I use it as a topping of decoration. Instead of using the white beans  I used white corn.

I can never leave a recipe alone. I cooked 1/2 cup wheat berries in 1 1/2 cups vegetable broth & added a few cloves of whole garlic. I made my beans from scratch and used 1/4 cup black beans, 1/4 cup cannellini beans & 1/4 cup small red beans since I'm not fond of kidney. This almost equaled the 3 15 oz cans. I also added 1/4 cup of sliced black olives, 1/2 cup jarred salsa, omitted the red onion & used 1/3 cup sliced scallions and 1/4 cup chopped celery. I also crushed the cooked garlic cloves & added to the dressing which I adjusted to my taste. Yummy!

I love this salad! The more it sits, the better it gets.  Tons of protein and veggies, it's a very healthy salad.  I look forward to making it this summer for a refreshing treat.

Instead of the cilantro (hate it) I use kale.  Otherwise, I pretty much go with the recipe.  Very good after it sits in the fridge a day or two.

Every single time I've made this for company or taken it to a potluck, someone asks me for the recipe….no lie…every single time (and I've been making it for several years now).  This recipe is a gem.  It's no trouble to make a day ahead of time…it only gets better.

This recipe is awesome!  Even my husband and son, who aren't big on beans, loved it!  It's fresh and fairly quick to make and awesome to just have in the fridge for a quick snack.  I also used corn on the cob (because we had some leftover from dinner) ISO of frozen since the frozen produces water while draining. Yummy!!

So good and even better two days later!  But it really does make a lot.  I did not have any red wine vinegar and was going to use balsamic as recommended by another viewer but then decided I needed to use the rest of a bottle of wine I had opened for another recipe.  Figured all the bean salad ingredients were yummy and the wine was yummy, what was the risk? It was fantastic!!  I stuck with the recipe EXCEPT I really crushed the TWO CLOVES of garlic and used the wine instead of vinegar. Seriously, if you thought that the vinegar taste was too strong, try this.  I am going to do this again with the vinegar and when the trees bare fruit I will add avocado, too.

OUTSTANDING just the way it is.   I did have part of a small can of sliced black olives opened, so I also dumped them in.  With the hot Arizona summers coming up, this will become a very frequent menu item in this house.

Decided to give this a try and it was delicious!  My family loved it.  I do love the dressing, but I may cut the oil and vinegar by half next time.  I used frozen corn that I cut off fresh corn last fall.  No need to cook it.  Awesome!!!

I have made this recipe 4 times now and it just gets better. You can tweak it, as you get used to making it. I spice it a bit more and drain the dressing when ready to serve. I take it to work for lunch, it lasts a week. 2 colleagues who tasted it, have gone on to use it. It is awesome!

We love this stuff.  Healthy too!  I usually make a double or triple size batch, because most of my friends want to take some home!
The only way I alter the recipe is using very little sugar (I'm slightly diabetic), and tripling the amount of cilantro.  Love cilantro!

I wish I'd have read comments first. We loved it but less dressing would be better. Too sweet for sure.  I added grape tomatoes and served with diced avocado and crushed tortilla chips. 
The suggestion to add rice sounds good-but uncooked?  Hmmm 
Definitely a mainstay on our menu!!

Halved the oil and salt. Splenda instead of sugar. Jalapeno instead of green pepper.  It's so delicious, filling and colorful.  Next time I'd put in less onion.

Love this recipe for a refreshing summer salad. makes a wonderful cold lunch as well. I made a few changes by using a can of walmart .79 six bean mix and making a smaller portion for just the two of us. I used canned corn and added jalapeño (we like it spicy). Did not add the sugar as it just didn't seem right to me. I didn't have red wine vinegar so I have used rice vinegar, white vinegar or apple cider. This is really good for a pot luck as well. Keeps for a while in the fridge.

Everyone always asks me for the recipe!  I do not like cilantro so I use parsley or basil or oregano, depending on what I have on hand!

This is a great Bean Salad!!! I read many reviews and I halved the oil, vinegar and sugar. It seemed to be perfect. I am going to make again with chick peas instead of white beans, I have read that the are better on the Glycemic Index Chart

I made this as directed but cut the oil and vinegar in half after reading some of reviews, and it was a hit at our house!  I'll definitely make this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I enjoyed preparing this recipe. I followed the recipe, while making a minor alteration to the dressing. That is, omitting - red wine vinegar, since I did not have any at hand. The end product was simply scrumptious! 

Thank you!

Wow. Absolutely delicious. The only changes I made were using a big, seeded English cucumber instead of peppers (only because I didn't have any on hand) and no cilantro. Fantastic recipe, easy, makes a lot. Can't wait to take it to a party or potluck!

I made this salad for our 4th of July bash, and everyone is still raving about it.  In fact, I was asked to make it for Halloween party this year.  It's perfect for a large gathering, very easy to make, tastes excellent (I am not a huge bean fan, but I loved it).  We had some left, and it tastes even better the next day!

Used some of the suggestions from other cooks (canned corn, less olive oil, did not use all the dressing) and it was a huge hit!  Some friends went back for 3 or 4 helpings.  I doubled the amount of beans by adding another can of black beans and a can of black-eyed peas and using both dark and light kidney beans.   Will definitely make again.

This is a good summertime dish. The recipe makes a lot because you are using whole cans of beans, so I suggest making this when you have a bigger crowd to feed.  My boyfriend and I couldn't handle it all!

I've made this salad several times, following the recipe except for cutting back to 1/2 red and 1/2 green peppers and less than a whole red onion if it's a really large one. It never fails to get rave reviews. I holds up extremely well in the refrigerator for several days. It also works well as a dip with tortilla chip scoops.

This salad is amazing and fresh and you will want to make extra to eat for the next couple of days! I added a tad bit of white vinegar, jalepeno pepper finely chopped, sprinkle in a tad bit of red pepper flakes and add a couple shots of sirracha sauce or picante hot sauce. These ingredients do not necessarily make it spicy, it just blends and makes it extremely flavorful.  I use ONLY GOYA beans! They will remain plump 4 days later if there is extra.

I made this recipe last year and brought it to a 4th of July party.  Everyone asked for the Recipe!!  I couldn't find my copy today, which is why I went on line and found it again. I recognized the ingredients. Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe.  It has just the right flavor and texture and spices.  Love it.

I did reduce the oil and vinegar down to 1/4 cup each.  Very good! I loved it.  Definitely will be making again, soon.

We use the frozen fire-roasted corn from Trader Joe's for the canned corn. Everything else is pretty much spot on. Great make-ahead recipe to feed a crowd and our 1 yr old loved it too!

Delicious as is. Add any veggies to this, change it around all you want. This dressing is a hit! Dang it though, I didn't have any fresh cilantro.

If your like me and are looking for healthier lunch options. This is worth a shot. It has protein and you could whip together a nice salsa from scratch. I enjoy cooking with cumin and chili power but did not enjoy these flavors in this particular combination. All is not lost. I was still inspired from this recipe and will definitely be trying different variations of this. Cheers!

This is a terrific and simple recipe that yields big flavor. I had some fresh instead of frozen corn and I think it made the recipe even better! A definite keeper.

Wonderful recipe!  Easy, adaptable, and it is really delicious and pretty.  Good healthy thing to take to a potluck, too.  I did reduce the sugar by about half and the vinegar about a third less, and used only fresh lemon juice, because that was what I had.  I also used a medley of different colored peppers, very nice.

I'd give this 5 stars, but I played with ingredient ratios based on what I had on hand, so it seems dishonest to rate so highly a recipe that I changed.

I used more lime juice and no vinegar, halved the sugar and salt, omitted corn (since I had none on hand), used pinto instead of black beans (having none of those on hand either), and substituted cayenne powder for hot sauce. I definitely recommend using cayenne.

This was even better the 2nd day, once the flavors had melded more, and I'm sure it'd be even better on the 3rd, but it didn't last that long. ;]

Hubby signed me up for a bean salad at work.  I had never made a bean salad and lucked into this recipe!  He got such rave reviews on it with a number of requests for the recipe.  Now when they have a potluck he is automatically signed up for me to make this.

Such a great salad! Based on what I had on hand, I skipped the cannellini beans & substituted canned corn. I did as other reviews suggested and halved the oil, vinegar, & sugar. The frozen corn would probably be a bit better, even so this was totally delicious! A great dish to bring to a potluck.

I like it hot! I double the beans, and add a couple of fresh jalapenos, maybe a habanero or two, and substitute vidalia onion for the red onion.

This was a really good dressing. I did not have all the beans listed in the recipe so substituted garbanzos. I also substituted quinoa for the corn since I had no corn in the house. But no matter, it was very good and I will make it again.

Delicious and fast to make.  I had less than 2 hours to make this and be out the door!   I was missing some ingredients so I used white vinegar, 1 white vidalia onion and no lemon juice.  This was still delicious.  With so many great home cook dishes at the party, I was worried people would not like it.  It was a big hit, thank you :)

Best bean salad! I always make this a day ahead so the flavors are brighter. I like to double the kidney beans and black beans, I use two packets of Stevia instead of sugar, an orange bell pepper instead of a green bell pepper and I add chopped avocado just before serving. I've served this both as a dip with tortilla chips and as a side dish. Everyone always raves about it!

Delicious! Here are the minor changes I made: I only used a little over 1/8 of the olive oil and vinegar (I used white balsamic, as I had it on hand).  I found this to be more than enough coating.  Granted, I only used half of the red pepper and a bit less than an entire red onion. I also only used 1 tbsp sugar, instead of two.  I didn't measure the lime, lemon or spices, and probably used a bit more acid than called for.  I also left out cilantro and dash of hot sauce and instead added about 3/4 of a jalapeno! Everyone loved it!

Excellent bean salad recipe. As suggested by other reviewers, I cut the oil and vinegar in half. Also added 1/4 chipotle and 1/4 jalapeno peppers, both very finely diced for heat instead of hot pepper sauce. Great reviews from family and guests!

I used chick peas instead of cannallini beans and only 1 pepper but other then that I kept the recipe the same.  It was delicious and would make a great side dish for summer meals.  Will definitely make this again!

Awesome. Made as written. It has such a nice fresh taste with the citrus juices & fresh cilantro. I have made it several times now sometimes making slight changes. If you like a little more spice it's very good with a finely chopped fresh jalapeno.

This is one of the best bean salads I have ever had. I made it for a dinner party last night, and everyone loved it! I did follow the advice of some reviewers and cut the oil and vinegar to 1/4 cup each. I did not have enough red wine vinegar; so I substituted rice vinegar, which was delicious too. I did not add any salt, and I doubled the cilantro (because I love it). Excellent!

This was a beautiful salad but not to my taste.  It was good but not great.  I found the vinegar overpowering.  I might try again with a different type of vinegar.

Best bean salad I have ever tried! This is a staple recipe I constantly turn to for a side dish, or to put inside a burrito for lunches. It helps me eat more beans and vegetables in a yummy way! I tried adding chick peas to it and loved it.

I followed the recipe almost exactly and it turned out fabulous! Only modification I did was to add 1 1/2 teaspoons of chili powder. Actually was a mistake, I read it as 1/2 tablespoon. It was a pleasant mistake though! Delish!!  I had to do a double take on the 1/2 tablespoon since I've never seen that in a recipe before.  A quick google search and it turns out 1/2 a tablespoon is equivilant to 1 1/2 teaspoons.

This is amazing!! You must let this refrigerate for at least 12 hours.  It tastes completely different than say just doing it for a few hours/ I followed the recipe.  Makes a lot.  Everyone in my house RAVED about it.  An absolute keeper!

Loved this recipe! Ate it as a side dish to chicken soft tacos and it was so much better than the main course! I ended up mixing the leftovers with the leftover chicken from the tacos and eating it all week at work for lunch. Added it to a whole wheat tortilla, some cheese, the bean/chicken mixture and heated up in the microwave, then added a taco sauce packet. So good that way, and also by itself.

This salad is superb. The base is great also if you just want a black bean salad. Lots of easy modifications. But this is just yummy! Goes FAST in our house!

I decided to make this last night as a spur of the moment/surprise for my boyfriend.  We eat healthy and were looking for something new to make.  This recipe is wonderful.  It was easy to make and I already had most of the ingridients in the house. Everything was perfect about it and it even looks pretty!

I made this today I doubled recipe because we are having a chili cook off at church and that is what I am takeing. I made it exactly except I used apple cider vinegar, that is all I had and added black olives, green olives and yellow, orange, green and red peppers. I used 4 cans beans black, white, dark red and light red. I put it in a canister type container with a tight cover then I rotated the container every half hour. Not to much dressing just right it is an amazing salad and I'm not fond of beans. When I tried it I couldn't stop eating it. Thank you for a great salad

was very good. didnt use cumin, lime juice, or cilantro. Instead of hot sauce used fajita mix with the chili powder. Also substituted frozen corn for canned. too much oil and vinegar so play around with it to your taste.

Loved this recipe! One of the best bean salads I have ever had. Followed it exactly and the flavor was incredible. I will definitely make this again and again. I ate it as is and over salad. I think next time I will try it with tortilla chips. Highly recommend it!

This was excellent. Followed recipe exactly. My 4 year old granddaughter helped me make this  (she's my little helper) and to my surprise she also enjoyed eating this salad. She was testing the taste of the beans as we were rinsing them off. Will definetly make again.

Super tasty! I did not use the green bell pepper or onion, I cut the olive oil from 1/2 cup to 1/4 cup, added 2 chopped tomatoes and 1 chopped avocado and cut for red wine vinegar from 1/2 cup to 1/4 - I think it tasted great with all these changes!

Really tasty and fresh but I would recommend using less vinegar. I think it's overpowering here and there's already enough acidity from the citrus juice and peppers.

Based on other reviews, I halved the dressing amount and skimped on the oil a bit to reduce the fat.  As I was making it, I felt it would have been a bit too much peppers and onions if I followed the recipe, as the peppers and onions they had at the store were about the size of grapefruis!  Otherwise I stuck to the recipe and it was great.  I love bean salad and this was no exception.  My husband has NEVER liked bean salad and he raved about this one and so did everyone else.  Definitely a keeper!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is an amazing and simple recipe!! So many flavors! It tastes even better the next day, making it the perfect make ahead dish. I followed the recipe as is, except I didn't have frozen corn. I used canned corn and it was still delicioius. I will use the frozen next time I make it.

This is really outstanding. I skipped the kidney beans (personal preference) and didn't add cilantro bc I didn't have any on hand- but this was still delicious! I don't usually like bean salads, but now I am converted. I will be making this again and again.

this salad is so good. i think i would double it since it fed 6 and everyone was looking for more salad. i used white wine vinegar since its what i had and upped the garlic since we like it. also i dont think the lemon and lime juice are needed i just used 2 tablespoons of lime juice. excellent.

This is my new favorite side to make for pool side barbques.  It was sooo good and fresh.  followed recipe pretty much, just didn't have garlic and added just a little more lime juice.

Made this last night exactly as stated.  I meant to 1/2 some ingredients as some posters suggested.  It is not needed.  It's great just the way it is.  Husband says it might be the best thing I ever made.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is very good, but it is not my favorite bean salad. My favorite is Szechuan Black-Eyed Pea Salad. The Mexican Bean Salad is beautiful and tastes good, but is a bit of a pain to make.

I just made this. Yes the dressing has a lot of ingredients but it is sooo delicious. I used an extra can of beans and the salad to dressing ratio seems just fine still. 

This is so much better than the boring bean salad I've been making for years and its really the dressing that does it.

I exchanged baby butter beans for the kidney beans and added a tablespoon more vinegar, but other than that, followed the recipe to the T.  It was as delicious as all the reviews I had read previous to making it! I even had requests for the recipe after serving it!! But, the real bonus...this salad was even better the next day!!!

Amazing!!  I did follow others advice and used half the amount of oil and vinegar.  I'm not a fan of bell peppers or onions so didn't use them... Did add green onion instead!  Added sliced cherry tomatoes and avocado!!  Delish!!! Will make this over and over!!!

This dish was absolutely delicious!  I made it exactly the way it says minus the hot sauce.  I brought it to a pot luck gathering and everybody wanted the recipe!  The longer it sits the better it tastes.

Delicious! And really simple. Next time I will probably reduce the sugar a tad as it was a little on the sweet side for my taste but it didn't ruin it at all. It was still amazing. Will definitely make it again. We had it on a bed of lettuce for dinner and it was perfect for a summer night. Really filling.

I just made this recipe and it is delicious!!  And several people said it will taste better a day later as flavors meld, so I am super excited.  The only change I made was to use a small carton on grape tomatoes instead of a red pepper.

Warning: It makes a ton!

This was so good.  I also halved the oil, sugar, and vinegar.  Don't like cilantro so I just put in a good amount of dried parsley instead (did not have fresh).  Also did not have lime so I used more lemon juice for that.  Used canned corn instead of frozen and it worked out fine.  I also used chick peas instead of cannellini beans which made it a bit heartier I thought.  will make it again soon.

I am not fan of any kind of beans or peas. I would never order any bean dish in restaurant. Never. But this salad is an exception. I LOVE it! My husband asked to make it for him three days ago and since then I have been asked to repeat it twice already. It is absolutely delicious. I add different veggies every time. It always come up perfect.

Great recipe -Everyone loves this bean salad even those who might not normally eat something this healthy.  Also made this for a pot luck at work - there was nothing left.  Do make this ahead of time at least one if not two days ahead.  Also this recipe makes alot but it is very good.

I made this salad last night and left it sit overnight in the fridge- it turned out great!  I've seen recipes similar to this in other places that say to serve it like a "salsa" with tortilla chips.  Tried it by itself, as a salad, and on tortilla chips and it's great both ways.  The changes I made were: left out the corn (my hubby doesn't care for it), used dried beans (soaked o/n, then boiled and cooled before putting in salad), added 3 cloves garlic (we love garlic), and 1/4 teaspoon oregano to round out the flavor palate.  I left all other ingredients and amounts the same.  This does make a huge batch, but I didn't mind.  There is a lot of dressing, but that gives plenty for the beans to soak up all the great flavors overnight.  Thanks for the great recipe:-)

so good! I forgot the red wine vin. at the store, so subbed balsamic vinegar (just used a little less) and it was still amazing! This makes enough for a party dish, so I had plenty to throw in the freezer for next week. Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent salad with amazing flavors that really compliment one another.  Have made many times and everyone always raves about it!  One change that should be made to recipe is to half the olive oil, vinegar and sugar - WAY too much otherwise.

I'd say it takes a little more salt than the recipe calls for... but then again to each his own. Made enough for the whole week. I'm sure it will be even better tomorrow after it marinates over night.

A great salad! The dressing was amazing and I was even lacking the cilantro, which I know will only improve it. Not only did I use it as a side dish, I also used it as a topping for salad and filling in a wrap. Delicious, thanks for the great recipe! Definitely don't change a thing.

This is a great recipe. It's easy and can be made a day in advance (in fact it's better that way). My son thought it was salsa the first time I served it and it in fact makes a great salsa too.  We serve it as a salsa more often than as a salad.

With just a few small modifications to this recipe, I really liked it.  I used half the oil and salt, and twice the cilantro and hot sauce.  I was concerned that the amounts of seasonings and onions would be overpowering, but the blend was perfect.  Served with tortilla chips and sliced cheese, it was a very tasty lunch.

This recipe really is just as good as the reviews say.  It's an amazing recipe.  I used less than half of the stated oil to make it a bit healthier, and this didn't seem to have any ill effect whatsoever.

Best ever!!! I made a batch of this and took it every day for work. The only substitutions I made were to use a great variety of dried beans that I cooked and I substituted honey for the sugar to make it healthier. This is going to be added to my family cookbook. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is freakin AMAZING. If you can make it the day before, it's even better. I always add a little more hot sauce (Tapatio) and double the chili powder and cumin because i love strong flavors in cold dishes. Another thing I love about this salad is that it takes about 10 minutes to make, and it's EASY. My sister who prepares only canned soup and Ramen even made it, and it turned out great! It looks really pretty with a slice of avocado and a sprig of cilantro for garnish.

OMG!  I seriously can't BELIEVE how good this is!!  It is barely chilled in the fridge and I can't wait to eat it.  Can't wait to see how good it will be tomorrow.  I added double the amount of chili powder...might still have to add more later.

Very easy and delicious!  I didn't change a thing to this recipe.  I was taking this to a potluck, and my fridge decided to kick the bucket the morning of, so I threw this together literally in minutes just before I left for the party.  Everyone enjoyed it, and several people asked for the recipe.  I almost felt bad because it was so easy!  I will continue making this; perfect for the summer!

Very refreshing.  Used fresh corn that's now in season; cooked for five minutes, let cool, cut off cob and added to salad.  Will make it again today!

Terrific recipe! It is as delicious as it is beautiful to look at. The only thing I altered was that I used parsley in place of the cilantro. Also, I added a small amount of chopped celery and about a cup of diced, fresh tomato. Since I have no idea what Cannellini beans are, I used a can of white beans instead. This salad can be made ahead of time and it holds up well if you have to take it somewhere. I'll definitely be adding this to my cooking repertoire.

Good recipe -  better after it has sat for a day or so. When it is recently made - it's harder to taste the cumin and chili powder.

This was a disappointment for us, especially after all the glowing reviews.  We love all the ingredients in this, so I was surprised that it wasn't better.  Just sort of blah.  No pizzazz at all.  I strictly followed the recipe and even made it a day in advance as some reviewers suggested.  Sorry, but we won't be making this one again.

Made as written.  Very nice.  Flavour improved after time.  Was a real hit with a Mexican themed night.

Great as a side salad or as a salsa with tortilla chips....I did find a bit watery, and will perhaps drain frozen corn next time for longer to see if that helps.

This is really yummy.  I halved the oil and vinegar, and used a little balsamic with the red wine.  I didn't use the hot sauce, and I used Great Northern White Beans instead of the cannellini.

This bean salad was delicious!  We served it along side Black Bean and Rice Enchiladas.  I wish we'd let it sit in the refrigerator longer.  We ate it within 1/2 hour of making, but it was even better after 2 days!  Thanks Karen!

Brought it to a Mexican themed fiesta and everyone loved it-a few even asked me for the recipe!  The flavor is light and wonderful and the spices are perfect.  It looks so pretty too!  I followed the recipe exactly except, I used a yellow onion instead of red since that was all I had, and it was still great.  I agree with others that the recipe makes a little too much dressing.  Also, since I was taking this to a party where 12 people were expected, I bumped up the number of servings.  I ended up having to use my largest bowl to mix it in  and there was way too much left over.  I think even though the serving size say 8 it's more like 10-12.

Amazing!  I took the advice of others and cut the oil, vinegar, sugar and salt each by half.  Also left out cilantro and added jalapeno, due to personal preference.  Excellent recipe that is easy to prepare and can be enjoyed instantly.  Definitely a keeper!  Try it--you will not be disappointed.

Loved loved loved this salad!  2 minor changes....I used only 1/4 olive oil which I thought was plenty....and I decreased the sugar to 1 tsp. instead of 2 tblspns. .....made no other changes. My family went back for seconds on this salad....refreshing and delcious.  Fresh cilantro is key....Thanks for a yummy and healthy salad and so full of protein. Served with Grilled Turkey Tenderloins from this site.

Absolutely delicious!  I made as directed even using the TBSP. of salt which I was skeptical about.  We served this with fish tacos.  My kids loved it too and used Tostitos scoops to eat it.  This was even better the second day.  I plan to add a jalapeno next time.

This is really good.  I love the dressing.  I added jalapenos and tomatoes.  I also recommend chilling it for at least 6 hours and then draining a little of the dressing before serving.

This is a WONDERFUL recipe! This is, by far, the best salad I have eaten. Since I am a bean fanatic, I knew this was something I would love. The only thing I did differently was that I warmed the frozen corn a little bit. Other than that, PERFECTO!

Love this recipe.  The first time I made it I substituted green apple for the corn and scallions for red onion because that is what I had in the house.  This time I followed the recipe (except I used Spanish onion) and added a few sun-dried tomatoes.  Hope you enjoy it as much as we have.

Very tasty, but I'd cut back the vinegar in half again to 2T. This makes a LOT of bean salad. I live alone and have been eating it all week long.

This is a healthy, flavorful side dish for a Mexican dinner!!!   I did not change one thing.....except used 1/2 red wine vinegar and 1/2 balsamic.  I felt all the oil and vinegar was needed so the beans could "soak it up".  Great recipe

I've made this salad three or four times and it's always a hit! The dressing is key in this mix.  Use real lemon and lime for the juice. This salad goes very well with a pork (on the grill). Yum!

Excellent.  I substituted the black beans with a can of chick peas and the cannellini beans with a can of lentils.  I also used canned corn instead of frozen.

I've made this salad at least 5 times in the past month.  It is ALWAYS a hit at every with everyone.  I'll continue to make this salad and now I'm sharing the link to the recipe with many who were at last weekend's BBQ.  AWESOME!!!

The taste was good but kind of ugly with the cumin.  The whole thing turned a brown color which wasn't very appetizing.

This is so fresh tasting and colorful and crunchy!!! My friend made it for a cookout last week...and everyone went crazy for it.  I made it today.  Super good!!!!! A real hit and unique Mexican variation on a standard bean salad.

I just made this recipe for an end of summer cookout that I am going to today and I couldn't wait to write a review. When I tasted it the first thing I said was WOW! What flavor! I did not change a thing and the flavor will knock you out!

This was delicious! I don't like corn so I omitted that and added a tomato. I also halved the oil and vinegar like the other reviews suggested. I have gotten so many compliments for this dish.

I had no problem with the amount of dressing in mine. I did cook my own beans instead of using canned ones. I also added a packet of Goya seasonings and it was tasty! thanks!

This was a very good salad with a bit of a difference because of the Mexican spices.  I did cut the oil & vinegar in half.  Left the rest of the dressing ingredients the same and it was perfect.  Left out cilantro, because I don't like it.  I'm taking it to my work picnic this week.  We'll see if it gets as good of reviews as I think it will.

Excellent.  Made exactly per recipe, and it turned out great.  The second time I made it, I substituted white wine vinegar instead of red, and adjusted (increased) the hot spices and lime juice to suit my own taste.  Either way, this one's a keeper.

Delicious!  I cut the cumin and pepper by half.  I also doubled the cilantro. Next time I will also cut the sugar by 25%.  The sweetness was a bit overpowering.  Still just delightful.  I took it to a Mexican themed dinner and it was the favorite dish.  Good thing I made a double batch.

This is absolutely deserving of this 5 star rating! Fantastic salad that can be tailored to anyone's preferences! I followed the recipe exactly (ok...well I didn't quite stop at the 1/4 c. cilantro, but who could :)!)and it was FANTASTIC..My son ate it like salsa with chips..YUM! I could also see changing up the beans if you weren't crazy about garbonzo beans for example and it would be great with just black eyed peas...I also made a second batch of this dressing and marinated chicken with it...and threw some on my salad at lunch with some fresh cilantro and red onion. Thanks for a fantastic recipe!!!

I am not a huge fan of lots of beans, so I left out the cannellini and kidney beans.  Made it more of a 50% corn 50% black beans mix.  Also decreased the peppers a little (that was what I had).  I absolutely loved it.  The dressing was fantastic.

I love this salad - although I half the oil and vinegar quantities.  I also add cilantro as well as parsley, and any other veggies I have going to waste in the fridge.  It also tastes amazing the next couple of days, so make sure you make too much!

Makes a lot of food!  The other reviews were right, that the recipe makes a lot of extra dressing, so I would add it gradually.  Easy and cheap recipe that requires NO hot stove!  The fresh cilantro makes this dish, so don't opt for the dry or frozen stuff!

I would definitely use less oil next time.  It was much better after it sits for about 4 hours.  I actually used garbanzo beans in place of white beans because it was all I had.  But when I have all the other ingredients on hand - I know I'll make it again.

Excellent! I added two tomatoes the first time along with other veggies.  The taste was wonderful.  However, I ended up draining over half the liqued because I was afraid it might make everything soggy.  The next time I made it, I cut the olive oil and red wine vinegar in half.  It turned out absolutely perfect!  My husband hates cold salads, but loved this one. It also tasted great with tortilla chips.

Very yummy. I am not sure a whole onion is necessary. I also might have overdone it on the cilantro. I can never find Cannellini Beans, so I subbed Garbanzo beans instead.

I loved this recipe. I took it to a pot luck at work and every one at work wanted the recipe. the only thing I changed was I left out the bell peppers and replaced with jalapanos. I realy liked it and gave it a little extra spice.

Fabulous summer side dish. I used the beans I had on hand (kidney, red, and butter beans) and substituted cut up red cabbage for the red onion-- It was great.  I followed other reviewers and only used 1/4 cup each of red wine vinegar and olive oil.  Using the full amount would have been over kill. My husband could not stop eating it.  Will make again!

Delicious!!!  My husband has a deadly pepper allergy (not bell peppers or black pepper) so I left out the chili powder and hot sauce and added some extra black pepper.  Even without the spice, this salad is amazing.    Oh, I chopped some jicama and added that as well..  Delicious!

Delicious!  I used canned corn and only one pepper (red), but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Everyone at my Mexican themed dinner party loooooved this dish.  It also makes a fantastic accompaniment to tortilla chips.  :-)

This salad is awesome!  A friend made it for a cook-out and I had to have the recipe.  I make it just the way it is and sometimes add whatever I have in the frig.  Avocado is a great addition.  Love this salad.

I made this for our memorial day bbq... mom couldn't keep her spoon out of the bowl. I cut down the oil & vinegar per some of the other reviews and it was still good. Not too overpowering. I'm saving this in my recipe box.

Awesome. I've made it a number of times with 1 tbsp of splenda instead of sugar, with white vinegar and balsamic vinegar in equal parts instead of red vinegar and it was great. Will try to remember the red vinegar next time. I did not like cutting the liquid in half...not enough!

I love beans but I tend to shy away from bean salads at pot lucks for some reason because they usually taste weird to me.  I decided to try and make my own for the summer.    I love this.  I only used one red pepper and I thought that was enough.  Very good!

Really good bean salad.  I accidentally bought chick peas instead of cannellini beans and I don't think I'll make it without them next time.  Thanks for the recipe.

Outstanding salad - everyone enjoyed it, including my husband who told me when I was making it that he doesn't normally like bean salads.  The flavors blend beautifully.  I found the salad to stay fresh for over a week - which is good because you end up with a large volume of salad because of the three 15 oz. can of beans.  If making this just for your family and you have a small family, it may take several days to finish.

I copied this recipe in 2003, and have been making it ever since. I have a Cinco de Mayo party every year and make it for about 15-20 people, who REQUEST it, they LOVE it! One tweek I make is to add a diced up jicama; it adds a really nice crunchy texture, and is what is commented on the most. This recipe is outstanding!!!!

This is an awesome dish! I more or less followed the recipe as it was. I added lemon & lime zest & used a packet of frozen corn that I was able to stick in the microwave. Didn't put in the sugar, not by choice but because I simply forgot. The boyfriend said it was ok but not something he'd consider eating again. He's not a veggie person so I expected that from him. However, when I let my coworkers have a taste of some that I brought in, they ended up eating it all! They actually requested I bring in more. And thats another thing that I must stress, unless you're bringing this dish to a potluck or feeding a large family, scale it down. This recipe makes a LOT.

I followed others advice and reduced oil, vinegar and sugar. I didn't have red onions but had shallots so used 2 of those and only used one green pepper and had no corn as well. But it tasted great the way it was. I will make again exactly as the recipe calls (minus the extra oil, vinegar and sugar). Thanks for the recipe.

I followed this recipe as is but decided to make it a little more substantial by adding some cooked Ditalini pasta.  I served it on lettuce leaves on a pretty plate.

This is a great salad,I tripled veg. ingredients but only doubled dressing ingredients came out just right. I used the 3 beans called for plus chili beans,great northern, black eyed peas,garbanzo, and pinto plus an extra can of black beans. used a tablespoon of tabasco sauce and added 4 jalapenos and black olives. Everyone loved it.   I had many requests for the recipe.

This was excellent.  I scaled down the recipe for just the two of us but otherwise followed recipe as written.  Will be making again and again!

Frickin delicious and requested by friends.  I did half the liquids in the dressing as it is enough.  Used extra cilantro because I love it.  I play around with the kinds of beans I use.  It makes a ton but does keep pretty well!

This is the best bean salad ever!  I have made it 3 times in 2 weeks! I used 1/2 red onion, 1/2 Tablespoon of salt, and added 2 stalks of celery! I also used a tablespoon of honey instead of white sugar. The dressing is so delicious!  Please give this recipe a try!

Made this dish twice over the holidays. I placed "Scoops" chips and sour cream on the side. It was very successful and will be my new potluck dish.

Stuck to the recipe. "Chili sauce" was a popular chinese pepper and garlic sauce, a scant forkful of that worked nicely.

I found this recipe delicious!!! I enjoy salads that are tangy as well as bring out the flavour. I used half of a medium sized red onion along with 1/4 cup both red wine vinegar and the olive oil. ( a huge thanks to the previous reviewers on mentioning this beforehand)The salad ended up slightly watery but I will have to see what will happen once the flavour is absorbed. I also used one tablespoon sugar, 1 tsp cumin, and chili powder. The only change would be to add the red wine vinegar and the olive oil based on taste instead of following the recipe ingredient list. Overall this salad is phenomenal.

This was very tasty!!  I have been looking for a bean salad/salsa type of dish for a while that is like one they sell at a local grocer.  Even though this recipe wasn't as good than the one at the grocer, it was definately a keeper.  I did add Franks hot sauce to add some zip, but found that it added more acid than it needed.  It does have alot of acid in-of-itself, so next time I will tweek a bit.

Loved it!  I made this for a party and received tons of compliments.  The only modification I made was using half a red onion versus a whole one.  Following the suggestions of other reviewers, I also used a can of corn (drained) instead of frozen.

This salad was a HUGE crowd pleaser.  I brought it to a BBQ and the men especially loved the hot, spicey, "kick" to it. I do believe they all had seconds.  The olive oil dressing would make a great salad dressing too.  I will be making this recipe again and again and again! Thanks!!

I like this salad because I can eat it straight as a lunch instead of like a salsa on chips. It's very tasty. We have been making it once a week and eating it for lunch a lot. It's a great protein meal for vegetarians.

Made it as shown and it turned out great! Be sure to drain and rinse the beans. Next time I will add a little more cilantro and add/sub an anaheim pepper.

Out of this world!  It looks beautiful and tastes wonderful!  The only change I made was only using 1 green bell pepper instead of 2 peppers. My guests raved about it!  Made it the day before (adding corn the day of) and it was fabulous, was still good even the next day.  Very summery and very tastey!!

This salad is WONDERFUL!  Very tasty - My husband said it reminded him of a fresh salsa (because of the Mexican flavors) ... Try it!!  I used 5 big shakes of Chili powder and 1 teas of hot sauce and it was great - not too hot or spicy ... I also substituted Garbonzo beans instead of the Cannellinis and it was even better!

Very easy and VERY yummy! My 5 year old would not touch this, as expected. My 3 year old and picky husband both really like it. It was soupier than I expected it to be. If I were serving it at a party I would strain it before presenting it. Otherwise very pretty, easy, healthy and tasty!!!

I must admit that I altered it a tiny bit.  I used only kidney beans that I cooked myself and I forgot to add the lime juice (even though I bought limes just for this purpose).  I spooned the salad over some home grown lettuce leaves and drizzled some extra dressing over top.  Delicious!

Thank you for this great recipe! I served it with BBQ ribs and it was a huge hit with my husband and kids.  However, next time I will use less oil and vinegar as I found myself draining off extra dressing with a slotted spoon.  The seasonings were just right- I wouldn't change a thing.  I can't wait for my next gathering so I can make this recipe again.

Fantastic! My only substitution was using 1 tablespoon of Splenda instead of 2 tablespoons of sugar.  So, so good.  Even my fiance, who does not like beans, ate almost more than me!  A great way to eat fiber and have a meatless dish that is so, so filling.  I bought chicken, but I didn't even make it--I just ate the salad.

Definitively a keeper!!!  Everybody asked for the recipe.  Healthy, and easy to prepare.  I added some feta cheese to increase the taste, and cut down the amount of dressing in half (I kept the over for another salade).

Excellent, truly delicious (but only if you like beans), and looked beautiful in a glass bowl - almost jewel-like. We used this as both a salad and a taco/fajita filling as well, and was great both ways. 
Suggest making the dressing well ahead of time, and letting it sit so dressing flavours develop. Reduced vinegar in dressing to 1/4 cup, as the lemon & lime juice are sour as well, and used a little less salt than called for. Not a big fan of cumin, so might leave it out next time.
When corn is in season, and if you have time, boil corn on cob for 3-4 minutes, drain, let cool a few minutes, cut kernels off cob, and then stir fry cut kernels in a little oil or butter or margarine for a few minutes until crisp-tender. Use this corn in the salad - beautiful!! We are having the leftovers with tonight's dinner.

Excellent. The perfect accompaniment to a Mexican casserole, tacos, fajitas  or burritos. Tastes fresh and is chock full of crunchy veggies.

This was great!  I made this for a family gathering of 35 people.  This dish was a huge success. I have been getting emails the past few days for this recipe.  I pretty much followed the recipe but followed other posters advise on cutting down the vinegar and oil. Thanks for a unique recipe!

I had the pleasure of eating this recipe at a new friend's house recently. Our family was invited over for Sunday lunch and it was part of the spread offered. It was soooo delicious, I had seconds and wanted thirds, but had to hold myself back. And even better, my 9 yr old and 6 yr old sons both loved it too! I just signed up on all recipes just to get this recipe. The only thing my friend did different...she cut the vinegar to 1/4 cup, did not use sugar and left out onions and green peppers due to individual tastes.

Very good and refreshing for the summer!  I followed the recommendations and only used 1/2 the oil and vinegar.  Those who don't like bean salads liked this recipe.

not half bad...I made it for a potluck and decided to decrease the salt, hot sauce, and chili powder (I love spicy foods but I wanted it to be more "crowd friendly).  Next time I will use full recommended amounts.  And there will be a next time.  I devoured the leftovers :)

Thank you for the healthy, yummy recipe Karen!  As other reviews, next time I will only use 1/2 of the oil and vinegar as there is a bit too much soupy for our taste, but great none the less.  This is great on tortilla chips or just by itself.

This is really really good and healthy for you too.  I served it with toasted pita and it was a hit.  I didn't have fresh coriander so I used dried and I added some fresh parsley instead.  HMMMMM!

My husband has been asking me to make a bean salad for a while now so I decided to check out "all recipes" to see what I could find.  This bean salad was the best and my husband loved it.  We even gave half of the rather large recipe to our neighbour for their dinner.  I made it as per the recipe and served it on a bed of mixed greens with a toasted flat bread.  I would agree that there was excess dressing but other than that, I wouldn't change anything in this recipe!

Excellent. I served it over a bed of spinach to make a complete meal. I used Splenda instead of sugar, and it was a bit too sweet for my taste. Next time, I will cut the sugar in half. Still very good.

What a way to get your fiber!  I halved the oil, vinegar and salt but doubled the garlic.  Used white beans because I couldn't find the cannelli beans, added fresh ground pepper but didn't measure and both juices from concentrate.  No major changes.  I think both peppers are nessecary to even out the crunch vs. bean.  Since I'm not a big cilantro fan I may leave it out next time.

Love this salad!  It's so pretty and healthy, and my kids will eat it!  I cut the oil and vinegar by half and kept all the seasoning amounts the same.  It turned out great.

Oh my YUM! What a tasty recipe. I love a bean salad and this one is great -- tangy and sweet with some spice, too. I omitted the corn because it is a "Food to Avoid" on phase one of South Beach, but still thought it was DELISH! Next time I'd sub in another can of beans to make up for the missing corn. There was plenty of dressing for more veggies.

This was really really good. I used 1/4 cup olive oil and vinegar. Also cut down on the sugar. Used 1 can black beans, 1 can kidney beans and 1 can white navy beans. Turned out great. Going to put it in soft tacos for lunch tomorrow. Thanks for the great recipe!

I skipped a couple of ingredients and substituted rice wine vinegar since that's what I had, but the seasoning in this recipe is excellent. Very easy to add or substitute other beans/vegetables as well. I will definitely make this recipe again!

A fantabulous bean salad!  I did as some suggested and cut the olive oil and vinegar down to 1/4 cup.  I also added a can of chick peas (garbanzo).  Other than that ingredients stayed the same.  This salad is better the next day.  Easy to make and will definitely make again!

So good! Definitely half the oil and vinegar. Leave everything else the same for a good, strong flavor. A 16 oz package of frozen corn wasn't too much. I also used cider vinegar and it was still good... although it may be better with red wine.

Exceptional recipe.  I made this for a Super Bowl party and it was a big hit.  Nice, healthier alternative as a side dish.  Although the recipe suggests serving cold, I served it room temperature since it was cold and windy outside at the time. Thanks for sharing.

OMG so good I can't believe I made it myself! Like the others, I reduced the oil to 1/4. I also reduced the sugar to 1/4 tablespoon. I also added strips of chicken because my husband and I wanted extra protein. There was plenty of the dressing so need to make extra.

This is beyond delicious! I have made it a couple of different times, and it gets devoured every time.  I heeded the advice of others and reduced the amount of oil and vinegar in the dressing in half. (I used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar.) WONDERFUL!

Made for a family get together last night and it went over big.  Rave reviews from everyone.  Personally I loved it and couldn't stop eating it even after I was stuffed.  Took some other reviews advise and cut back on bit on the vinegar and oil.  Used white vinegar instead of red.  Really, really good!!

I reviewed this once before but it was awhile ago.  Coming back to say that this is still a stand-by recipe for me.  It is always one of the first foods to go at parties.  Thank you again for posting this, one of the best recipes!!

I cut back a little on the oil, and I added one chopped avocado. It was absolutely delicious! A huge hit at the cookout I attended last night - in fact, I should've brought copies of the recipe with me! I will certainly make this again.

No complaints here!  I used less salt and olive oil than was called for, and I also added three garlic cloves instead of one.  This recipe makes an enormous amount of food, but it's so delicious that we had no problem eating it all!

This salad is FANTASTIC!  The dressing is amazing. I can hardly stop snacking on it long enough to let it sit and allow the flavours to meld!  Since I am the only bean-eater in my family, I use 1 big can of mixed beans cut the dressing in half, also use less than half the oil.  This would be great with some orzo tossed in to soak up the delicious dressing.

I am not crazy about just eating this kind of salad on its own. I made a salad using this for the bottom layer topped with mexican meat (chicken or ground beef) lettuce, mango salsa with avacados, crushed tortilla chips and sour cream. I cannot find canneloni beans anywhere so I used a can of garbonzo beans. Will probably make it again when I have a big crowd and use it for salad again.

The vinagrette alone gets 10 stars.  The only thing I omitted was the 1 tbsp salt and just added maybe a tsp of kosher salt.  Wonderful recipe Karen!

So healthy and delicious, had it on a holiday Up North, I didn't prepare it just ate a ton of it, makes a lot and keeps well, flavors meld delicious with everything, my father-in-law thought it would be good warmed served over fish or chicken with jalapenos added for some kick, sounds good to me!

I have made this twice so far and my husband and I love it!  It is our new favorite bean salad and it gets better the longer it sits in the frig.  Some adjustments I made are that I substituted garbanzo beans for canellini, only used 1/4 cup olive oil, and omitted the onion, salt, and garlic.

Awesome and refreshing. I decided to leave out the corn. AS were having it on the side. Perfect. If you serve to guests be sure to put less dressing or in a bigger bowl so that it does not look like it is drowning. I would not want anyone to miss out on this!!!!

Amazing taste - made it for a family reunion and everyone wanted the recipe.  I used shallots rather than red onion, cut the oil and vinegar by half and cut the sugar to only 2 teaspoons.  Top with avocado if serving immediately.

I used this as a side dish but am planning to take it to work for lunch tomorrow. The dressing is excellent. This is definitely going to be a favourite. Many thanks

I love this salad! It is so good. You can eat it alone, with tortilla chips or in wrap. You can also keep eating it for a couple of days after, which at that point it tastes better.
