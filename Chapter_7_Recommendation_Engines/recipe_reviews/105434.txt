I have to say I was a bit skeptical that this recipe would have much flavour because I didn't see any spices except the garlic powder in there. But boy was I wrong, these smelled wonderful while baking and tasted great! I did add some cayenne though. I also didn't shred the last bit of cheddar cheese and just thinly sliced it and laid it over the ketchup. I made Unbelievable Rolls from this site to use as my buns and Roasted Onion Mayonnaise to top it off. It was really good for something so simple. Thanks for sharing!

These burgers were delicious! I did the recipe as it was written and I also added in some Cajun spice to it, and made some Cajun Mayonaise for the topping. Fried some onions, and they were awesome, my husband could not stop praising how good they were. will make these again! thanks!

Fun, easy and delicious. I add about a quarter cup of quick cooking oatmeal to the mixture to help it stick together and for nutrition. You can't tell it's there when they are cooked. Also, because my family prefers mustard to ketchup I will put that on the top of some of them next time. A really good recipe that will become a family staple. Thank you!

I followed the recipe exactly but I really didn't care for these, the meat was too moist and didn't hold together well.  The taste of ketchup was really overwhelming.

These were good. I added some minced onion and used less ketchup in the mix. I would probably make these again.

These were great! I used A1 steak sauce instead of ketchup and garlic, though, because that was the flavor I was wanting. I'm sure it's really good as is and I will try it with these ingredients next time!

We make something similar to this, but just use onion soup mix and a pound of hamburger.  We put ours on the King's Hawaiian Rolls...yummy!!!

These were okay, but the ketchup should not have been added to the mix.  That should have been saved for the condiment.

Not overly impressed with these.  They need to be more seasoned.  Try using grill seasoning or something to that nature.

Made these with 2 lbs of ground beef, a little more shredded cheese but kept the other ingredients the same. Not soggy at all, just right. Made the burgers bigger than one inch, so just increased the cooking time. Delicious. Served with buns and various toppings.

These burgers are just awesome. Reminded me of White Castle Burgers, as I added minced onions to the recipe.

My family felt that these were the best burgers they've ever had.  I didn't make them mini--just regular-sized and served them on soft onion rolls.  They were so flavorful, we didn't put the extra ketchup on top.

Fun meal!  Had company tonight and made 25 of these (2lbs. hamburger).  I used the recipe as written, with the exception of 2 lbs. of meat.  Split the mixture in half and "doctored up" one bowl with alot more spices.  They held together very well.  Baked for 20 minutes; added chesse; baked for 3 more minutes.  I bought mini rolls at the bread outlet.  If they are too thick, cut in half and cut out the extra thickness.  Save the cut-out part to use as bread crumbs or make croutons.  These were great with the "Special Hamburger Sauce" from the AR website.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Taste was great but size was too small.  I doubled the size of the patties and found that to work better.

Actually the 2 stars is being generous. It'll make me feel a little better knowing that I went through all the trouble in following a 2 star recipe than a 1 star recipe :(  I didn't particularly liked how it tasted (neither did my husband, 2 toddlers and my sister). It was bland but my biggest complaint is the fact that it was SOGGY. I even put 1/3 cup of quick-1 minute oatmeal like one reviewer suggested too! No bueno. Not going to make this one again.

Girlfriend said these were the "best" burgers she'd ever had....wow, they were good but - .  I followed the recipe exactly but while forming the meat into balls, I noted that it was very 'wet' (from the egg). I put some dried bread crumbs in to make them easier to form. This may have been a mistake as I noted while eating the 'dryness' that the crumbs brought to the burgers. Next time, I won't add dry crumbs, (maybe torn up bread). I used dinner buns which were the perfect size for these min cheeseburgers.

Ok, catsup and cheese.  Big deal right?  Well, yes it is a big deal.  Every bite the hubby took was followed by a "Yum".   These were so tasty AND I served them on noodles.  So easy, I'll be making these again!

Definetly need some breadcrumbs or something to hold the meat together ..  I added more than a pinch of garlic powder.  I also added Worcester sauce, salt, pepper, and some Italian Seasoning.  I added about a quarter cup of bread crumbs, need a little more than that. Perhaps half a cup, to hold the moist meat together.  This is a great recipe, I loved it after I added those things :)

I love these. They are really simple but a great snack. I made some rolls, sliced them, buttered and toasted them. Yummy. My family just couldn't get enough.

I made 24 of these for our big family.  The ketchup is a bit much in the meat.  It tasted more like meatloaf cheeseburgers.  I have to say though, I had so many left over that I put them in the refrigerator over night.  I just re-heated them and Bam! it was a nice snack.  I put a slice of pickle, some chopped onions (which were sauteed in butter) and a drop of mustard.  Not bad the day after, but not a big with the kids.  However, I will probably make them again with less ketchup.

For the 'mini buns'. Check a local bakery. A lot of them make mini buns and biscuits just for small sandwiches, like this. If you can't find any, use frozen puff pastry, cut three-four inch circles and bake as directed. Really good.

My 11 year old son made these for all of us. They were very easy to make, quick to cook and absolutely delicious (the kids particularly liked that fact that there was a lot of ketchup involved !). We had them in kaiser buns and there was not a scrap left over by the end of the meal ! BIG HIT with us ! They went as far as to say that they were better than Five Guys (and they like them A LOT !!!!)

I did not love these. I thought the way the grease puddled on the baking sheet was a perfect appetite spoiler. It didn't have a whole lot of flavor either. I wouldn't make again.

I am giving 5 stars because my daughter and mom loved them! I was surprised at how good they were. They tasted like little meatloaves. I did have italian seasoned breadcrumbs in my meat mixture ( i had extra after rolling meatballs) and an egg so I just added the shredded cheese and ketchup. My daughter ate them as is, no bun or on pasta.

Agree with another reveiwer hat this does not work too well. Second time I replaced half the cheese with Breadcrumbs and still they are too moist and break up into a dryer sloppy joe type deal. Also Second time I added some Paprika, Cumin, Mustard Powder and a dash Worcester Sauce to give it a better flavor.

Simple, easy and tasty! Surprisingly flavorful even though there were so few ingredients in it. I held off the 1/4 cup ketchup at the end and instead spread some straight on the bun.

I didn’t have any eggs, so I used 1/4 cup sour cream. It was still delicious!

Excellent and easy! Did not use buns...I served them over mushroom rice ( 1 1/2 cups of rice mixed with 1-can of undiluted mushroom soup).

I liked the flavor of these mini burgers, and the size was just right for my preschooler. I used ground turkey instead of beef, used a bit less ketchup than called for, and added a squirt of mustard to the mix.  I would make these again, but would add some bread crumbs because the patties did not hold up well (hence the 3 star rating).
