This was my first attempt at rugelach too and I found the process time consumming but worth it.  The dough was very easy to make.  Be sure to use flour when rolling it otherwise it will be sticky.  I baked them on parchment paper which worked wonderfully since the filling does come out.  They lifted right off.  I made some with chocolate (I used a dark chocolate spread but Nutella work well too) with crushed nuts.  Be sure to roll out the dough fairly thin.  I found that to be key.  Once the filling has been spread, I suggest rolling the entire thing and then cutting it using a pizza cutter.  They come out log shaped that way but they still look nice and it is less time consumming.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was my first attempt at Rugelach.  I can't believe how good it is!  I used a different preserve for each ball of dough and they were all excellent!  My only advice is to heavily grease your cookie sheets.  The non-stick cookie sheets are really not effective.  The preserves bubble over and stick to the tray.  Other than that, these were easy and tasted fabulous!

I've made these Rugelach about 3 times already and they are always such a hit, now that Christmas is nearing am going to be making these non stop to give away as gifts. It really is time consuming but if you do have the time you must make them, they are so elegant and delicious theres not a single person that won't enjoy them especially if you make different flavors I usually make apricot, strawberry, rasberry and chocolate (I melt Godiva bittersweet chips in the microwave and just add a splash of heavy cream)

These are great ! I made the chocolate israeli version ,which I happen to enjoy, because they had cinnamon to the cocoa. I used low fat cream cheese to cut down on some of the fat.  I finished them off with powdered sugar... YUM

De-lish. I used raspberry jam and chopped pecans for my filling, but the top coating is great!

Yummy! I love rugelach and anything with apricots. So, these are the best rugelach ever! The dough was a snap to make. You're done before you know it. The assembly requires a bit of patience, but I find the process relaxing ( as long as the kids are busy doing something else!). I also had to sub dried mango for the dried apricots, as I realized I was out of apricots half way through ;) No problem, mango went great with the apricot jam. You should definitely give these a try.

These are great.  They do require some work, but go together very nice.  Do cook for 19-20 minutes and parchment paper will be your friend with this one.  The preserves melt out and would be a mess on a pan.

I made half with apricot filling and half with Nutella and sprinkled chopped nuts - the apricot is messy, but very yummy :o) - for the first time making, I'd say it was a success!

These were tasty, but incredibly messy. It took me almost as much time to get the baked jam off the greased tray as it did for me to make the cookies.

These were very tasty, but needed more cooking time than the recipe called for to give them a little crunch.  I found softening the apricot preserves in the microwave for 20 seconds, made them spreadable so that I could use a pastry brush to brush the preserves on evenly and anchor the filling.

Made this for a brunch and everyone loved them!  I didn't brush the milk on and they still came out great.

This is my first Rugelach to bake (trial), and had no idea how it would turned out, but since this has 5 stars rating, I thought, this couldn't go wrong :-) Anyways, it turned out Very Good! So, i have to bake this again, tomorrow, to bring it to Hanukkah gathering. Hope my jewish friend's family will like it! :-)

They tasted great, but the jam melted out and got EVERYWHERE!  Very messy to make, but very good 
*note, I've made rugelach before without this problem!
