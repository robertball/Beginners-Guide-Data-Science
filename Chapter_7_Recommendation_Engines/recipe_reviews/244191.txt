Simple and very good! We really enjoyed the flavors of this and how easy it was to whip up. You can never go wrong with s'mores, IMO. I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Easy to make but I melted the butter first then mixed in milk until fully mixed then added chips.  Melted faster this way, I think. But very delicious

This was a very easy and quick fudge to make especially using the microwave (took only four minutes on high, stirring after each minute).  The recipe doesn't say what to do with the remaining half of the mini marshmallows so I tried to stick them on top after the final layer of Graham crackers and then broiled the top brown.The fudge was airy and softer than traditional fudge, but my family enjoyed this version even more.  I used semi sweet chocolate chips and it balanced off the sweetness of the marshmallows.
