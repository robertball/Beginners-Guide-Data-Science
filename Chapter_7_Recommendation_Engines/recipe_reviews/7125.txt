I did not cook these as stated in the recipe. I used this dough to make sausage rolls.(Kolachies) It worked wonderfull!!!!! After the dough rose the last time, I rolled it around either some sausage and cheese or ham and swiss. allowed the dough to rise once more, and then baked till golden. Everyone loved them. I now have to keep quite when I am getting ready to make them, else the nieghbours all bring ingredients so I can make them some as well; and then I am making these things all day long. I will put all this together soon and post it so that anyone who wants to try it can.

We loved these!  I filled with a Boston cream filling and dipped in melted, dark chocolate chips.  Would make again!  Nice and light for filling and the donuts we cut the centers out of we re-rolled and they also worked well despite the extra handling.
