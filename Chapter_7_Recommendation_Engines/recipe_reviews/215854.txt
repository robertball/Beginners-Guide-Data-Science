Tasty and easy recipe. I followed the recipe as is and it turned out great! I put the stuffing in a freezer bag and snipped the corner to pipe the stuffing into the manicotti.

The filling is quite bland as written and was in desperate of herbs and spices. I sauteed minced onion and garlic and added it to the browned beef. There's nothing Italian about cottage cheese so I used a good ricotta instead and to make life easier, I made my own manicotti shells using crepes rather than the pasta tubes. This was a good starting point tho and with a little tweaking it was devoured by all. Thank you!

Yum! I used Classico Tomato and sausage (by accident) but soo yum. I added fresh basil and garlic with the beef when i was cooking and also added spinach when stuffing the pasta.

Great Recipe but I must say the stuffing seemed  a little dull so I added some red pepper flakes, parsley, and italian seasoning. Turned out great and lots of flavor!! The only down fall was that it's not an easy or fast meal to prepare.

This was very delicious and I added a little bit of sugar in with the beef and cottage cheese.
