You always taste then add what you, personally, like. I liked this recipe. Finally one that doesn't depend on a whole lot of spices to give it some taste. It was easy and the kids liked it. I just added some pepper and a bit of garlic powder, something I would do to any recipe to make it more to my taste.

First time making scalloped potatoes and this recipe rocks!
(Omitted ham and added cheddar cheese with parmesan cheese to finish off the top layer)

Fast forward to week two....made it again using CREAM OF CELERY SOUP!! instead of Cream of Mushroom Soup.  
My company loved it!

Really missed some spice oomph, nutmeg, garlic, black pepper, etc.  Plenty of sodium, but not enough over all spice or kick to give a wow factor.

I’ve made this thrice now with minor tweaks and it is INCREDIBLE. Each time, I only used one can of cream of chicken soup, put 1/3 into the bottom of the baking dish, then placed small layers of potatoes and sprinkled salt and pepper between each layer (created 5 total layers) until the dish was full. Then I whisked the milk and remaining soup and poured on top, followed by remaining cheese, salt and pepper. I omitted the ham and onion entirely. Both my boyfriend and his picky brother LOVE this dish. It comes out perfectly seasoned and with the right amount of melty cheese every time. This one is a keeper!

I am the submitter of this recipe.  The process as shown has been changed to something rather complicated. Believe me you just layer soup;potatoes,onions and cheese. You can add ham if you wish but very good without .

This was so yummy! I used what I had available at the time, and it still turned out delicious. I used cream of potato soup, Parmesan Cheese and Smoked Gouda Cheese. Gave it a rich smokey flavor to enhance the ham flavor as well.  Enjoyed leftovers for breakfast.

This dish was a big hit with my picky family! The only change I made was using dehydrated onion instead of fresh (because my kids won’t eat onions if they can see them) and used a cheddar mozzarella cheese blend. Will definitely make this again!

This was perfect. A new way to make cheesy potatoes. My husband liked them. And that's saying something.

I Lined an iron skillet with bacon slices to help prevent sticking.  The bacon gave the dish a very good flavor.  We loved it.

Very good, but the family was expecting something more cheesy rather than mushroom flavored.

My stepmother always made her potatoes this way.  Only changes were that she used Velveeta for the cheese. and only one can of soup.  She put everything together in a microwave safe casserole and nuked it on high for 5 minutes at a time (stirring every 5 minutes) until the potatoes were tender.  Sometimes she served it straight from the microwave and sometimes she put it in the oven to brown the top.  Either way it was yummy.  We use diced ham instead of slices and cooked crumbled  bacon instead of ham is good in this dish also.  Faster and easier this way.

This recipe is perfect. It’s easy to make and is full of flavor!  It’s more a main dish than a side dish with chunks of ham. Next time I’ll swap out crisped bacon for ham. Make sure to cut the potatoes and onions very thin!

I love this recipe and so did my family. It's a simple recipe and tastes great. I used Chedder  and also sprinkled some fresh Thyme on top. Each diner can add salt and pepper or? to their own liking. Highly recommend.

It was on the bland side but after adding some cheddar and garlic powder it was ok.
