I thought this recipe was exceptional! I didn't put the brownie pieces on the top, (we just wanted to eat them :D) I used half chocolate pudding, half vanilla, and I used real whip cream (I don't like cool whip...). I'm sure I will make it again. Thanks!!!

A very tsty pudding-pie-type dessert. Took longer scooping out and waiting for the brownie to cool enough, than I expected after reading reviews. And, presentation was a messy glop of cool whip and chocolate pudding, so I don't think this was a very pretty desert for company or a pot luck. The brownie part tasted great and we all liked the delicious chunks of it mixed in the pudding mix and cool whip. I really think it would have been better to add a stabilizer (sugar, cream cheese, etc.) to the cool whip so it retained some shape when cutting. I doubt I will make again, though. There are easier pudding pies that taste similar and cut up nicer for serving.

I'm 9 months pregnant and was 8 days late on Christmas, so I wanted to make something fast and easy for dessert.  This not only was what I was looking for, but it was soooo delicious!!! Definately something anyone can just whip up and let it set, then take it to a party, or a dinner or something. My husband not only wants me to make another one already, but he wants me to make it for their next shop dinner!

This recipe has been in my kitchen for years now.  I cannot tell you how many holiday parties this has saved.  The whole creation is delicious and attractive.  In a pinch you can substitute in a boxed brownie mix and the end result is it looks like you spent all day making it.

I loved that the pie crust was made out of the brownie.  I used fat-free pudding, fat-free milk and fat-free cool whip.

This is so good for the chocoholic in the house.  Quick and easy, my family loved it.  We had a fight over the last piece.
