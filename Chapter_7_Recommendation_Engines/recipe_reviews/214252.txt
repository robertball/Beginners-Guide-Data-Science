This receipe was very yummy. I made it for Memorial Day cookout, and everyone enjoyed it. There were a few changes I made. I did add a tablespoon of milk to the batter, it was really thick/dry and that thinned it a bit.   Also, a 9x9 pan is WAY too small. I used a 13 x 9 pan that worked fine. That reduced the cooking time to 35mins.   The glaze as well was very thick and I added a couple of teaspoons of milk to it as well. Additionally since the cake itself was larger, I made more glaze than recommended, maybe 1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar and 3 tbsp of lemon juice + 2 tsp milk.  Overall though, it was super tasty and moist and I'll be making it again.
