This pie had a really good flavor it was sweet.  I love sweet but this was really sweet.  I will make this again as I always have buttermilk in the house.  

One thing I will try due to the age of this recipe.  Sugar is very different now than it was in the 1800s early 1900s.  Bought from the Caribbean or Africa it is more the natural sugar you can buy in health food stores or in ethnic speciality stores.  I will lower the sugar down to around 1 cup or I may try this 1.5 cups natural sugar.

I had some buttermilk I needed to use so I decided to give this a try;  I didn't make the crust, just simply poured the filling into a glass pan.  I only used 1-1/2 cups and sugar and 1/2 of the lemon juice.  This was a really good pie, but even with the sugar reduction I still found it way too sweet, so if I make it again I will reduce the sugar even further.

Thought I'd give this a try to use up some buttermilk. I started to worry as soon as I put in the lemon juice, it all started to curdle. It didn't get smooth and "custardy" like I was hoping. Unfortunately this didn't work, even after trying it a couple different times. Sorry.

This pie is amazing (as a base). I gave it 4 stars because I only put little more than a cup of sugar, and it's sweet enough. I also put about 4 T flour and eye-balled the last 3 ingredients, as I am a vanilla fanatic. I used freshly-squeezed lemon juice as well (with no curdling). I made a different pie crust from this site. I just wanted to say though that this pie filling is wonderful. It's tangy, sweet, and delicious!

This was a really good all around Buttermilk pie.  Don't pay attention to the reviewers who think 2 cups of sugar is too much, it isn't.  Buttermilk pie is supposed to be sweet, and it's best that way!
The only thing i would do different for this recipe is cut back on the lemon a little.  I don't like to taste the lemon in my buttermilk pie and I could taste it in this recipe.  Still very delicious!

I've been making this recipe for Thanksgiving for going on 6 years now, just getting around to rating it for some reason.  Long story short, it's an absolute hit! One friend in particular requests it specifically and pouts if he thinks I won't be making it. He prefers it without the lemon juice but it's superb either way. 
I love telling people about this pie. It's not commonly known here in the Colorado/Wyoming area, so people are surprised and skeptical . Then they try it and fall in Love!! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, it has enriched my life!
