Classic this is, it was so simple to throw in crockpot, but elegant enough to serve for company!  I used a whole grain mustard because I love it.  Served it over wide egg noodles, there were no left-overs!

Fairly easy to make, especially when I got the meat cut at the store. But we did not care for this recipe at all.

I add 1 tablespoon of Worsteshire sauce. I also had some Tatefully Simple spinach seasoning. 
 The dijon mustard makes this so yummy.

Easy to put together and very flavorful.  Because of scheduling, I made it in the crockpot the day before I needed it, then reheated it on the stove, adding the sour cream at that point.  It was great.

Ive made this twice now. I thought I did something wrong the first time because I did not care for the flavor. It was just as unappealing the second time. Very disappointed.

I doubled the recipe. The only addition is that instead of twice the sour cream, I used 8oz Sc and 8oz Philly. Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly. Delicious! Over rice or noodles, it's fantastic.

I would definitely make it again.  I used a little less dill, just because I was unsure about it.  That's the only change that I made.

Great recipe!  Had it tonight with company who raved about it.  I used baby bellas (16 oz) 1 and 3/4 lbs of round steak and added tomato paste (2 Tablespoons) and the flavor was amazing!

This recipe is delicious. I made it exactly as written except I had fresh dill so I used 1.5tsp of fresh dill.  This is a keeper.

We loved it! I used beef bone broth instead of regular broth, more flavorful and I used four cups instead of two and then just added the noodles. Less mess. Family love it.

This is a very tasty dish!  The meat was very tender.  The dijon mustard and dill really added nice flavor that is not typical of other stroganoff recipes I have tried.  This one is a keeper!!

Delicious! Omitted the garlic and dill. No need for extra liquid as there was plenty, but I might add extra mushrooms next time. I mixed the flour and beef directly in the crockpot. Will definitely be making again.

Absolutely  fantastic! Felt there wasn't enough liquid, I added an additional cup of water. I added red pepper flakes, along with the pepper. Unfortunately,  I didn't have any fresh pepper, mushrooms or herbs; I used canned mushrooms, dried herbs. I also used strips of deer back strap. Didn't add the mustard, but hubby said it was AWESOME, his word. Mmmmmmmmm!!
