Absolutely wonderful! I reduced the honey to just 1/2 cup, and you could just barely taste a hint of honey flavor. I let the dough rise 3 times, punching it down after 1 hour the first time, about 35 minutes the second and 25 the third (it rises faster each successive time.) By doing that, it increased the lightness. Then, after cutting I allowed the dough rounds to fully rise before baking. VOILA! Nooks and crannies. Whereas this takes time to do, if you are looking for English muffins that look more like Thomas', then there's no way to skip the prolonged, multiple rising. Excellent flavor and texture. The open crannies make for great places to soak in butter - yum! The only difference I encountered was that this recipe only made 20 muffins for me, not 36. I used a 4" biscuit cutter, and if you roll the dough the full 1/2" thick indicated in the recipe, I don't know how you'd ever get 36 out of it. In order to give the requisite finish that we associate with English muffins, I sprinkled the baking sheet liberally with cornmeal and sprinkled more of it on the tops before baking.

These English Muffins popped out of the oven as pudgy little round things, but I might have rolled them a little thick because I halved the recipe and only got 13 instead of 18. I agree that they aren't as spongy as store bought, but they are definitely fluffy inside and toast up great. I cut the honey by half based on other reviews and my muffins didn't taste sweet at all. A little tip for measuring honey is to spray the measuring cup with cooking oil spray first and then the honey will just slide out.

I have tried several english muffin recipes and most require a griddle which is more time consuming for those of us who want to make LARGE batches at a time. This recipe is an excellent oven recipe. I used hi-gluten bread flour and the full amount of honey. You could halve the honey, but it really is not overly "sweet" as is.  I was not disappointed in texture or flavor. Mine were "puffy" after the first side baked, but if you lightly press down on them with the spatula after flipping they come out as a perfect store bought thickness. I also reccomend dusting them with corn meal before baking.

A good recipe - not quite as spongy of a texture as store bought English muffins, but the flavour is much better!  The texture I achieved may in part be due to my use of whole grain flour. The crust was crisp and chewy and the muffins split a little during baking. I halved it when I made them - and it still turned out 18+. They are a little on the sweet side, for my preference. I'll probably cut back a little on the honey the next time I make them. I may experiment with other sweetners (molasses, maple syrup) for a subtle flavour difference. Overall - a decent recipe. I'll be using it again.

We are trying to avoid GMOs in our diet, so I was looking to make my own english muffins, and these turned out perfectly!  I followed Baricat's advice about cutting back the honey, allowing them to rise 3 times, and also flattened them with a spatula when I turned them over.  This is the first time anything I have made with yeast turned out well.  It made about 40 muffins for me, so I will be freezing some.   These are even better if you can get hold of some locally farmed cream cheese or butter.  Thanks Loretta!

Another instance where one realizes the taste difference between store-bought and homemade.  These were really good.  They take a lot of time, but if you take it on as a fun project, it is worth it.  I made 36 with the recipe as described and followed all the tips offered, including the multiple risings, as well as reducing the honey, adding cornmeal to both sides, and "smashing down" after the first 7-8 minutes in the oven.  I'll definitely freeze these and use them for breakfast all week for the family.

This was fantastic. The recipe was easy to follow and they turned out great. I ended up cooking half of the muffins on a griddle and ended up liking those ones better than the muffins cooked in the oven however. These puff up quite high and following the advice of another reviewer, once I flipped them I pressed down on them with a spatula and they flattened out.

Good recipe, I decreased the amount of honey by a third because I don't like sweets and it turned out well. Don't skimp on the 1/2 inch thickness, it'll help them bake.

First time making bread at all, let alone english muffins.
I and my kids, as well as my mother loved these.  I followed the base recipe as described, except I did not have honey, so I used Karo corn syrup (which seems fine except you don't get that really nice subtle honey flavor) instead.

They baked perfectly and fast.. and came out looking amazing. Opened one with a fork, and was shocked to see all the nooks and crannies you would expect in store bought.

I know for a fact that I sort of flubbed the dough making part in a few ways... this was my first attempt at making any dough at all.  The Muffins, were good, but the taste was a bit flat, and they were more dense than expected.  After a couple days, they seemed even more dense.

I know that is a result of improper mixing, needing, and yeast proofing problem I had... 

but with all the slight mistakes, and learning curve, I KNOW these will come out awesome the next time I make them.,, guaranteed! 
I am looking forward to it as well, because even the messed up version I made, was really good on a lot of levels.
We ate them all!  made egg sandwiches, used them with butter... cream cheese and jam and one of the FAVORITE things my kids like with english muffins (which is why we buy them really) little pizzas!  toast em, some pizza sauce, cheese and any toppings, then bake for a few minutes.  These were great for the especially since they were more sturdy.
I will update on next batch.

These were great! I added 1 cup of raisins, and 1 tsp. cinnamon. Better than any bakery muffins.

Delicious! Reduced the honey by 1/3.  Kneaded the dough and let rise to 2bl, punched down and then placed in the fridge. Dough more than doubled overnight . Took the dough out and rolled cold, cut with a 28oz can, let them rise once more and dusted with semolina instead of cornmeal and griddled instead of baking.  I halved the recipe and made 12. I will definitely use this recipe many times in the future.

This is an absolutely wonderful recipe!  

I did slightly change the way I make them and I love the result.  I pricked them with a fork right after cutting them and then I let them stand for about 20 minutes until they got puffy.  I dusted them with white cornmeal and I then grilled them on a griddle for 10 minutes on each side.

I loved the results!  :-)

Nothing like an English muffin.  Made the extra dough into jalapeno cheese buns and they were tasty.  Will keep looking for an English muffin recipe

This is a great recipe that I will be making again.  I only used 1/2 c. honey and raised 3 times.  They came out soft with small nooks and crannies, but had a great flavor.  I was amazed by how long they stayed fresh.  Once cooled, I stored them in a Zip Loc bag on Sunday and by Friday they were still fresh.  Great toasted with butter and homemade strawberry jam!

Used 4oz (by weight, not volume) of honey instead of 2/3c and they came out perfect. I baked 2/3 and did the rest in my cast iron on the stove. I felt the stove ones rose better and looked more "english muffin-y" than the baked ones but both were delicious.

Pretty good, halved the yield but only got 12 out of it.  Should have pan fried as the oven made then harder than I would have liked.  Kids liked them tho....

These are really good. But they are a little to sweet. Next time I'll cut the honey in half. I made these to use with Eggs Benedict and they tasted great. Also I started them on a greased griddle cooked them about 8 minutes per side then finished them off in the oven. Thanks!

Wow, these English muffins were fantastic! I bought farm stand honey & jelly to give as gifts for Christmas and was looking for something homemade to go along with them.  I made these muffins, exactly as the ingredients called for.  I did let them rise a few times as someone suggested for the extra nooks & crannies and dusted the top and bototm with corn meal.  I got a call from every person I gave these to the next day with rave reviews.  My husband was so jealous I had to make him a batch.  Don't let the yeast and rising dough scare you.  These were easy to make and were delicious.  I have been told I have to make them every year now.  New tradition!  Thanks

Really good. Very light and fluffy, although you can distinctly taste the honey in them. Good option when you don't have store-bought available.
