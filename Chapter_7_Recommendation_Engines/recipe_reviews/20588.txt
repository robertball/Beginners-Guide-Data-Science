I thought this tasted NOTHING like Popeye's chicken, which my husband and I both love.  Although it was edible, I can't say I enjoyed the taste of this chicken.  Also, the coating did not stay of the chicken very well even though I followed the recipe instructions to dip into the dry mixture a second time.  I will not bother making this again.

I do not know what Popeye's you have ever eaten at, but this recipe is no where near close! I was raised on Popeye's Chicken so please believe me when I say do NOT mess up your good chicken creating this mess. I knew better when I had seen the ingredients, but ole' wishful me had to go check it out. Sorry I did. The only one who enjoyed this meal was my Pug. She eats anything.

My husband grew up in DC, and I'm constantly hearing from him how Popeyes chicken is the bomb and how much he misses it.  I am constantly trying to replicate it, which is no simple task since I was born and bred in Tennessee and have never had it.  This chicken had a pretty good flavor, although even though I left one side of the foil open it came out rather greasy.  I am only giving 2 stars because it was supposed to be like Popeyes, and although my hubby liked it, he said it was not like Popeyes.  I guess I'll keep trying.

I'd like to give it a 3.5.  The flavor was really great and it wasn't too difficult to make, however it wasn't very crispy, I found it to be soggy.

While this chicken tasted alright it is NOTHING like Popeyes.   There are a lot of ingredients and a lot of work.  Didn't taste any better than plain old salt, pepper and garlic powder.  SORRY

Unlike one of the other reviewers, it stuck  fine for me.  When i fried it, I fried the bottom side first and it worked out great. (Nice a crispy) I also added more cajun spice than indicated I made it for a friend and he loved it!

Very disappointed,way too many ingredients. I'm going to just stick with salt,pepper, garlic powder,parsley in the flour. We usually remove the skin before eating and that's where all the spices are.

Been doing this for years....dont compare it to Popeye's...simply call it "spicy cornflake chicken". I trick it out by adding bread crumbs to flour and the crushed cornflakes. For added spice, I add cayenne, ground white pepper and smoked paprika to the flour/cornflake mix. Oh yea!

This is nothing like Popeye's chicken.  Popeye's chicken is spicy and very savory.  

I did leave out the onion soup mix.  I was worried about the big flakes of dried onion.

I also used large chicken tenders instead of a whole breast, so that I could cook it faster.

Not what I was expecting.

We've been making this dish since 2007 and everyone who has it absoultely loves it. I can't imagine anyone complaining too many ingredients.. it's what makes it so good. We remove the skin & the Cornflakes makes it crispy and people think they're eating skin. Thanks for this. We are taking it to a friend this weekend @ Hamptons.

No Changes are necessary. I'm just experimenting with trying out different recipes. I will keep it for a family favorite or as a Church Potlatch staple. :)

This was disgusting and a waste of my ingredients and time. I don’t know why someone would say this taste like Popeyes unless they never ate there. It wasn’t even close. Yuck!!!!!!! I will never make this again.

Turned out perfectly but I don't think there was enough flavor in the skin to justify the cost of all the ingredients.  My skin looked much thicker than the main photo as well.  Not sure if that's a good or bad thing.  I've never actually had popeye's so I can't speak to the similarity.
