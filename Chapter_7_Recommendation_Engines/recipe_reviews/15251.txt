I was searching for meringue cookie recipes and came across this one.  My grandmother's recipe is very similar.  The only differences are that I don't add vinegar and I pre-heat the oven but turn it off once I've put the cookies in.  The cookies then stay in the oven for four hours.  Omitting the vinegar makes the cookies fluffier and leaving them in the oven that long allows them to dry w/o the chewiness I've seen in other meringue recipes.  But then, I'm a texture person and I like my meringue cookies crunchy!

Easy and awesome!  A great change from regular choc chip cookies.  They are still really tasty if you can even reduce the amount of choc. chips by 1/2 and sugar by 1/4.

This is a very delicious cookie , however, they are best NOT made on a humid day!  They are a little crumbly when eaten, so, they are best made in a one bite size!

YUM!  I got a little nervous and took a batch out a little too early.  Make sure they are lightly browned on the top, too and then you'll know they're done perfectly.  And yes, just use half the chocolate chips and a scant cup of sugar.

These are wonderful! I made the recipe as it was written and everyone loved them. One tip I found is helpful is to use the convection setting on the oven (if you have that option). It makes them cook a little faster and keeps them nice and crispy. I still cooked them longer (about 45 mins). Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was great! I halved the mixture before I added the chocolate chips and instead added some peppermint extract. Nice and Light! There is not much more that I can say that hasn't already been said.

I'm giving this a 4 only because it was FAR too sweet!  I cut the sugar in half but left the 2 c chocolate chips and holy chocolate batman!  Next time I will reduce the chocolate by 1/2-1 cup....also I bet these would taste good with butterscotch chips and toasted almond slices...perhaps I am on to something...

The cookies melted *all* over the baking sheets and were a pain to get off! The goo that was produced was very good, though. Yum! If I made these again I would use less chocolate chips and less sugar - they were also a little too sweet.

EASY! Remember to use real egg whites, the carton will not work!!   My kids love these.  You can use 4 eggs and less chocolate chips... two cups is almost too many!  I like to use a melon baller to scoop these out.

Followed recommendations of others - 4eggs and 1/2 C. Sugar.  Had to cook for much longer to get them dry (reducedto 200 degrees for additional 1/2 hour then left in the warm oven for 1/2 hour).

I tried to make this cookies. It was delicious. I followed some suggestion in reducing the amount of sugar and choc.chips. However I am having problem with the texture. When it comes out of the oven, it was crispy. But when I let it cool before I store it, it has softened as if never baked. Can somebody tell me what I did wrong??

Good.  Although I should have cooked them longer.  The "leave them in the oven for 3 hours" method is probably best, but I didn't want to tie up the oven that long, so I was happy to see this recipe. I used peppermint extract instead of vanilla, a few drops of green food coloring, and mini chips, and they were just as I remembered as a child.  Great for Christmas.

OK, I agree with Jenza that these are sweet, but any meringue has this degree of sweetness (and if you try to cut back on the sugar too much, you won't get hard peaks). These are reminiscent of a cookie my best friend's mom used to make when I was a kid, so I was glad to get the recipe. And, it's a super way to use up egg whites which is a real bonus. The cookies can be made without chocolate to cut back on the fat and calories, but can also be made smaller in size. I made over double the amount - and they keep well in an air tight container for a few days. Appreciate the recipe Dodie.

Great alternative to choc. chip cookies.  We are in high humidity so I cooked a bit longer.  Good and crisp with gooey center.  Great recipe when you have egg whites left over!

My mother made something just like these with meringue and chocolate chips, and they also had corn flakes in them for a little crunch.  Great cookies...just like mom's.

I Tried this with the whote s i had left over from making lemon bars, 7 egg whites, doubled the recipe, i put half choco chi[ and half butterscotch. I like butterscotch better (just my opinion). 
Easy, fun, delicious! What more can i say? that the parchment paper works better then grease, i tried both, AMAZING JOB!

This was my first attempt at meringue, and it came out wonderful.  I put the full amount of sugar in, but I agree with the others, half the chocolate chips was enough.  Still, it was great.

Ok, made these without vinegar, uck, and they were soooo good. I did half the sugar. They brown up and cook on the outside but are soggy in the middle. You need to lower the temp and after 10 min turn off the oven, but dont open the door and let them sit for a few hours to dry out so they will be crunchy. They have a great flavor, I love all merigunes equally....

As noted by other reviewers, proportions of sugar and chips are off.  Because there was too much sugar and my kitchen was a little humid, I ended up with marshmallow goo instead of meringue.  It tasted good though, so I might try this again on a cooler day with less than 3/4 cup sugar and 1 cup chips.

These are excellent cookies, a favorite with the family.  You can reduce the sugar a little, but if you reduce it too much it will mess with the texture.  Very good with mini mint chocolate chips.  Be sure to beat egg whites to soft peak before adding sugar, and don't omit the vinegar, I usually use apple cider vinegar, can't really taste the difference.  Add sugar gradually and continue beating to stiff peaks, the very gently fold the chips in.  Mound the meringue into small cookies, it expands and small cookies cook better.  Do not store cookies in fridge.  I bake them at 300 for 25 minutes, they turn out melt in your mouth good.  I butter the pan, (I don't like the way parchment cooks the bottom of the cookie) and check they are dry looking and starting to turn a little golden before you take them out of oven.  Also be certain air circulates around them, I have not had success when I put more than one pan in oven at a time.

Warning! These cookies expand to nearly twice their size when you bake them. I didn't know that and they came out huge! I was looking for a recipe where you wouldn't leave the meringues over night but also wouldn't turn the cookies brown.  I also like not needing the cream of tartar. This recipe has become part of our regular Christmas cookie tradition.

I made meringue for a banana pudding. Had extra. Quickly found this recipe, added 1/8 Tsp vinegar and 1/8 tsp vanilla extract to the left over meringue. Threw in 1/4 chocolate chips. Turned out excellent. Hubby loved them. Since they are made of egg whites, I put left over in frig. Became very gooey still good. Anyone tell me why they got so gooey after I put them in frig?

These are awesome. I did get the egg whites to peak, but after I slowly added the sugar, etc. I was unable to get it fluffy. I was worried when I put them on parchment paper that they would flatten, but much to my surprise, they fluffed and mounded into a nice looking cookie. I did cook them longer like the other reviewer suggested. I would like to know how long to beat the mixture because I just kept going even when I thought it was too long. These are exactly how I remember my Mom making when I was little. It has a toasted marshmallow taste thats addictive. Love them and so does my husband Two thumbs up!

Took about 5 minutes from gathering ingredients to in the oven. I used 4 egg whites and about 3/4 C sugar, and i only had about 1 C chocolate chips.
 
I kept in the oven for about 35 minutes at 275-300 and the outsides got nice and browned but the insides werent completely dried. I think next time i will lower the temp and leave them in a long time.

Delicious!  I wanted to find a lower calorie cookie and this worked.  I only used half the chocolate chips it called for and they were soooo chocolaty.

We loved this meringue recipe! It had a light, sweet, and fluffy consistency that melted in your mouth. We had never made meringue and for our first time, it was an exquisite success.

I made one cookie sheet with bigger meringues and the second with smaller ones.  The big ones definitely turned out better and you do have to be careful to not bake them too long or the outer layer is too crispy. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and lowered the temperature to 275 degrees and followed the baking times listed for that (was it 30 min?).  My kids love meringue cookies!

Not one of the better meringue recipes on this site. You NEED an electric mixer though it doesn't specify you need one. Way too sweet.

This recipe did not work for me. The egg whites never got real stiff. I used another recipe that called for cream of tarter instead of vinegar and it worked.

Best meringues I have made - I cut the sugar in half and still were plenty sweet - I doubled up each cookie and used an ice-cream scooper which worked perfect.  Thanks

Delicious cookies & "easier than pie" in that following this recipe is, literally, easier than baking a pie. And I LOVE pie. 
Also - I eat gluten free by necessity. These cookies are as good as anything "gluten gluttons" can eat lol. I will serve these on special occasions with a scoop of ice cream.

I used 3/4 cup of sugar and added sone cocoa powder to make it extra chocolaty. It made AMAZING COOKIES. Hint: the top of the cookies will NOT get golden brown, so take out when time is up.

Halved the sugar and added one more egg. I also found that when I took them out of them oven they were still sticky so I tuned off the oven and left them in there for about an hour longer and they were perfect!!
