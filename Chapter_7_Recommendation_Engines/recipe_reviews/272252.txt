So easy to make and so delicious! I used a mini food processor to puree my strawberries. Next time I might cut back a little on the apple cider vinegar. Other than that, I loved it. Thank you for the recipe!

Fantastic flavor, and super easy to make! It's perfect as is, however I added a sprinkle of salt - just personal preference. I used my mini food processor to blend everything up. Served with a delicious spinach, strawberry, red onion, goat cheese and walnut salad. Not overly sweet, and nice and tangy, just how I like my dressings. I also like that there's no oil.
