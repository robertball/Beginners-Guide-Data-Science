Fun recipe to make with kids.  I had to leave out the horseradish because the kids would not like that.  Very cute idea.  Thanks!

was fun to make and very whimsical... a crowd pleaser... I did have to add an extra 2 dry yolks; the filling was originally too thin to hold the weight of the top egg half, and the "chick" swooshed out of the sides... but once thickened this was a great idea

The idea is so cute! Put them in my egg tray and filled the bottom of it with olives and cherry tomatoes for fun, easy snacks. Thanks for the great idea :)

These were awesome. I omitted the horseradish only because I was taking them to my nieces and nephew. They are 9, 6 & 3. Wow...they LOVED them. They had 2 EACH - couldn't believe it. I didn't even get one lol  They don't transport well. Ours got mushy and looked funny but we strategically placed them to make them look like some were drunk and fell down. Was hilarious. We made a little bottle out of cucumber! We don't like olives so used Pickles and we did not have dill so used sweet pickles and they were super yummy (from the bite I had before my family ate them all) Next time would do for people coming to my place so they don't get mushy but they rock!

I wish I had looked at the pictures before making as my chicks were very top heavy and caved in.  That said, I believe it is because we like a creamier deviled egg.  I prepared the filling as directed (except cut the horseradish to 1/2 tablespoon because kids are eating) and although it tasted good, it was too stiff for us.  I added 2 more tablespoons of mayo and 1 more teaspoon of pickle juice to get it to the consistency we like.  We did like the base recipe though and will have again.

I used my recipe for the filling, but made them into the little chicks as explained in the instructions. They were darling and got lots of positive comments.

The eggs were good and my daughter loved how cute they were.  Next time, I will get rid of the excess pickle juice that came from chopping them up.  It made the yolk a bit runny.

These little chicks were the talk of our Easter brunch. They were not only cute but tasty. The only change to the recipe we made was using capers for the eyes instead of olive pieces. We also took a small slice off the bottom so they would stand upright.

Great idea. I had my 8 and 16 year Grand Daughter's help with this project. Took it to a family Easter brunch. My Grand Daughter's renamed them Halloween chicks. They are a little harder to make then we thought, but they promised that we will do a better job next year.

I didn't feel the need to add the horseradish, pickles, or pickle juice. - tasty without those ingredients. Fun and festive presentation! I found that I needed to add more mayonnaise in order to improve the consistency for piping (very easy to pipe!).

The yellow stuff in the middle was too runny, probably too much liquid. The top squished it. Also need to be very careful scooping the yolk out that you break the white bottom.

Note - Cut the egg on the bottom 1/3.  Maybe this was obvious to others, but we had some casualties trying to get the yolks out.

We really enjoyed these and they were a cute addition to the Easter table.  Definitely a change up from my usual deviled egg.  I did not use the pickle or the pickle juice, but added a dash of worcestershire sauce, dill, ground mustard, paprika and celery seed.  This is my usual for deviled eggs, and I know my family likes it.  I also used raisins (one raisin made 4 eyes) for the eyes as I think I am the only one in the house that likes black olives.  Currants would probably work too. 

These will be back next year!

Very cute and whimsical. I made the filling a bit gooey and the chicks lost their hat.  Difficult to get the yolks out. But nontheless very great idea.

The idea was perfect! I did use my own guts for filling as the one I tried was a little dry. Mine was a little gooey, so next year I will try some in-between version. mine looked like they were awfully hot and were melting. LOL But they tasted yummy and everyone liked em anyway! Thank you for the fun!

Super cute, though mine didn't come out looking that good. But seriously one of the best deviled eggs recipes I've found anywhere. I did cut the skin off my dill pickles before mincing, as the skin gave an "off" texture to the mix. But the flavor is delicious, my whole family loves. We just make these for ourselves to enjoy as snacks (not cute, just normal deviled eggs).

I've never had a deviled egg before. I saw these and knew I wanted to make them for Easter. They were very time consuming but fun to make. I personally didn't care for them but other people enjoyed them. Of course they are adorable even though I don't like the taste. I had a hard time getting them to stand up because they were a little heavy on the one side. Overall, a success.

Great look and great taste. I just have to figure out how to get the yolk out without tearing the egg white.
