Great recipe! I used this as a marinade instead. I didn't bother cooking this on the stove.  I used 1 lb. of boneless chicken breasts that I poked with a fork and placed into a ziploc bag.  For the marinade I used 1 Tbsp of dried minced onion vs. regular onion, Heinz chili sauce vs. ketchup, 1 Tbsp. of brown sugar, and added 2 tsp. of smoked paprika. I mixed everything together and poured it over the chicken. I let it marinate overnight and grilled it over charcoal - excellent.

For those concerned about burning chicken on the grill the alternate is grill then take chicken and extra sauce and put under the  BROILER watching the chicken carefully. You will still have that grill flavor and no burned offering.

This had an awsome flavor to it.  My kids are so picky and even they ate it.  I would recommend maybe baking this in the oven at 350 for 10-15 minutes before putting on the grill to keep the outside of the chicken from getting burned, but still cook the chicken properly.

Very tasty after a few modifications. I used 2 cloves of garlic, 2 Tbs. brown sugar and 1/4-1/2 tsp. of cayenne pepper! In order to get a thicker sauce, I pureed the sauce after cooking. I used skinless boneless chicken breasts and basted the last 6 minutes of grilling. 
**Hint for not burning sauce, turn off   the side of the grill that has the chicken on it while basting.**

Loved the flavor and ease of sauce but have to admit I had a heck of a time with the grill flaming up and the skin getting burnt.  Any suggestions?  I finally got frustrated enough that I finished it off in the oven.

This is very similar to my standard bbq sauce. I omit oil and add about 1 - 1 1/2 tsp of celery seed (and usually double the recipe.) I mix sauce all together and cover cut up chicken, ribs etc and bake in oven or crock pot. The extra cooked sauce is really good on top of mashed potatoes and my kids LOVE extra onions in this sauce - and they normally pick out the onions.

Pretty good! I ended up adding a splash more Worcestershire sauce, and a couple of garlic bouillon cubes. A dash of liquid smoke might have been nice too. Thanks!

This is excellent!! I did use sugar free ketchup (for hubby who watches sugar intake) but definitely didn't leave out the brown sugar!  I let it simmer a little longer to thicken up (the s/f ketchup was very loose compared to "real" ketchup) and  I had no trouble with flareups... it did come out rather spicy this way... so I'm guessing that the sweetness of regular ketchup would have tempered the spice.  I would definitely make it again (but maybe decrease the amt of hot sauce if doing a reduced sugar version)!!

This was a quick and easy replacement for commercial barbecue sauces. I upped the brown sugar and added liquid smoke. I ended up with a hot, sweet and smoky barbecue sauce. Freaking awesome!

My boyfriend and I really liked this recipe. I didn't have any Worcestershire sauce, but it still tasted really good w/o it. I'll definately make it again. However if I only had enough sauce for about 2lbs of chicken so I will make a little more sauce next time.

We really enjoyed this.   I prefer my barbeque sauce tangy and this fit the bill.  It was tangy and had a little bit of heat.  We did cook the chicken on indirect heat instead of high heat.  I think if it was cooked on high heat it would have burned before the chicken was done.  Crank it up to high to heat the grill and then turn down (about 375 on our grill thermometer).

Definitey worth making again and again. I took out the hot pepper sauce since I can't handle spice too well and it tasted amazing even without. I used red raspberry vinegar instead of vinegar. Loved this. :)

This was very good. I baked instead of grilled the chicken, still delicious. Used apple vinegar instead of regular cause that's what I had in the house. Still great.

The secret to great BBQ is a great sauce.  And this is it.  I doubled the recipe to slather on some ribs and chicken thighs last night my wife and all my BBQ guests loved it.  I may reduce the amount of vinegar next time as the sauce does come out a bit to thin for my liking.  I also substituted chili sauce for kethchup (same thing IMHO)

Delicious chicken bbq recipe.

Followed another reviewers suggestion, baked in oven for 10 minutes before grilling. Very tender. 

I also used less hot sauce, but still had quite the kick to it.

Family loved it.

Very good sauce. I altered the recipe to use the sauce as a marinade and used chicken breasts instead of the whole chicken. Also, I cooked it on the stove top and boiled the marinade and poured over the chicken when done. Indeed, no regrets cooking this dish!

Great recipe to use up some of the bottles of condiments I have in my fridge before moving. I did double this recipe because I had a full family pack of chicken legs to use and my husband likes cold BBQ chicken the next day. I used BBQ sauce instead of ketchup (only because I'm out of ketchup) and added a half teaspoon of Liquid Smoke. Because I don't have Tabasco, I used Frank's Hot Sauce instead. I did not add the additional salt. I wisked all the sauce ingredients together in a medium sized bowl, then poured them over the chicken legs and let them marinade for most of the day before cooking them. This was tasty--I'd play with the recipe next time a little and add more garlic, onion and maybe a few other things but it was a quick recipe that use on hand ingredients that was very inexpensive to make. NOTE: If it's too cold to grill where you are, you can do what I did and just bake the chicken in your oven for an hour or so.

This sauce is AMAZING! Sweet, spicy, fantastic! I gave it 4 stars because like others, I added stuff: 1 1/2 tsp liquid smoke, 1 tsp. thyme and some fresh rosemary. I had friends wanting to lick the sauce bowl! Thanks, I can't wait to try it on ribs!

This chicken was tasty and moist. We're rating this just four stars because we felt the sauce still needed a little "something" added to the flavor, but it was quite a nice base recipe.  We'll have fun experimenting with some additional spices.  Thanks!

Tastes sweet and hot but its not as nice as my Jerk chicken recipe  -  Always ponder if iv'e got my US to UK conversions right but turned out  90% happy. Used chicken thighs scored 3x to the bone  cooked on the BBQ for 45 mins on hot  semi direct heat  with a few beech chips, Turning and basting every 10 mins and then checked with  temp gauge . Might whack some ginger in  next time with a bit  of extra Worcestershire sauce and garlic and could be worth adding a bit of corn flour to thicken it a little. Tips - keep your eye on it as i think it would be quick to burn  from the sugar  content  from the ketchup and brown suger

Made this for mty husband for the football game. He put bottled BBQ sauce on it and warmed it up in the oven. I was embarrassed. He said save the ketchup for French fries and don't believe everything (ratings) you read on the Internet. This smelled good, but didn't taste like BBQ sauce.

Hubby and I really loved this recipe. I followed the ingredience to the letter. The only difference I did was use only drumsticks and cooked in the slow cooker. I really don't think it would make a difference as to the way it's cooked or even if it's marinated. Next time, I will grill and baste them.

Regarding the problem of flames shooting up and charing chicken too much, one way to avoid this is to cook chicken indirectly in the grill by placing chicken in center of grill and most of the white ash covered coals around it in a ring.Another way is to put coals on one side and chicken on the other. Meat will take longer to cook at this lower TEMP but will be tender, juicy and less likely to cause cancer. This will work best on a grill with a lid.

I cut the hot sauce in half and was still spicy enough.  Also slow cooked the chicken on grill at 200 degrees for about 2 hours because I have a thing about undercooked chicken.  In the end, this came out fantastic!

I've never made my own bbq sauce before but I'm glad I tried this! I only did about half the hot sauce and it was perfect for my taste. Worked perfectly on the grill, will definitely use again-thanks!

We unfortunately didn't get to grill our chicken we ran out of propane.  I didn't cut my onions up enough and they were big chunks in the sauce.  All in all it was great, the sauce has quite a sit up and pay attention flavor to it but once you cook it with your chicken it it simmers down a little.  My husband hates vinegar so I put probably about 2 tablespoons of cider vinager in and I really didn't miss it.

This sauce was excellent. The only drawback was that it didn't make enough sauce for ribs. When I saw that it only called for 3/4 cup of ketchup I decided to double the recipe. It still was not enough for the ribs. I will definitely make this again, but will probably triple the recipe. YUM! YUM! YUM!

This recipe turned out great. I grilled the chicken until the skin was extra dark and then peeled it of. I mixed the sauce with jamaican jerk mairinade and it was great. We finished of 12 pieaces in one night. I will defininely remember this recipe.
