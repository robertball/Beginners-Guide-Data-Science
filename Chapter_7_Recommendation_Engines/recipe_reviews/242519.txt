I scaled this down to 1 serving to use up some fresh spinach that I had on hand. It did taste like I was drinking something healthy, that's for sure. I prefer my smoothies more on the sweeter side. No fault of the recipe, just my own personal taste. I drank it all, but it's not one that I'd make again.
