First, if you're going to make any kind of fruit "pizza," clear your schedule. Start to finish, including waiting for things to cool, this took 3.5 hours. We didn't like the crust at all. I was suspicious to see that it called for 2 C of butter + oil in proportion to only 2.25 C of flour. It was too "short" and had a rather bland flavor, NOT like a sugar cookie at all. Next time, I'll probably just make half of a sugar cookie recipe. Next came the cream cheese layer - it was good and had just the right depth on a 15" pizza stone's worth of crust. Next came the fruit, which looked GORGEOUS but took forever to prepare. Then the BEST part of the recipe - the glaze, which was delectable! I used a very small silicone basting brush to glaze the fruit and it worked much better than a pastry brush. All in all, I'll make it again, but with the above alteration to the crust.

My family and I loved this recipe (I made it for Christmas dinner dessert!).  It was time consuming to cut up all the fruit, but the glaze was terrific and the only alteration I would make would be to increase the batch of the cream cheese mixture, a little thin for my liking!

This recipe came out great! For an easier glaze you can also just heat up some apple jelly in the microwave and drizzle it over the top.

This ia a delicious fruit tart. Not  flan!  Flan is a crustless, baked custard. I believe many more cooks would try this recipe if the name would be changed to: Fresh Fruit Tart.  (It doesn't need to be made in a tart pan to be a tart.}

This is the BEST recipe!  I love the crust, it doesn't get soggy.  The combination of flavors is perfect.  This is the best fresh fruit recipe, hands down.

It depends where you are from whether you call this a flan or tart.  Where I come from we call this a flan & a delicious one at that.

This is a great recipe as is.  I needed a quick recipe so I eliminated the cream cheese part, used only strawberries (2 fresh cartons, sliced) and used the prepared strawberry glaze from the grocery store instead of the glaze.  It turned out really good.

The whole family enjoyed this recipes. They were surprised I made the whole thing, even the crust.  Found that I needed more cream cheese than it called for, so I made it 1 1/2 times the recipe which worked great.  I used aluminium foil pizza pans, as I didn't have a round pan and I found this recipes to be more impressive in a round than a square pan. The crust was baked on a single pan but had to use three to give it more stability when putting on the fruit and the glaze.  It's a definite make again.

No matter what the name - the basic recipe is very flexible - making it easy to swap out or switch out ingredients or parts like the crust. Despite a rather long list of ingredients you can make a respectable dessert quickly with substitutions. I've tried it as written, with a graham cracker crust from the store (quick but crust can get soggy), with different fruit choices, adding lemon juice and zest to the filling instead of vanilla, and with jam or jelly and water microwaved a few minutes for a glaze. Every time I make the dessert it's never quite the same as it depends on time available and the ingredients on hand. It is very good summer dessert when fresh fruit is abundant.

I have no intention of rating this wonderful dessert on whether it is called a flan or a tart - it depends what country you come from.   Easy and light even with a layer of cream cheese.  Always very well received, especially in the summer. Thanks for an excellent submission

The reason I gave this only 4 stars and not 5 is because this is a fruit pizza and not a flan. Other than that it is fantastic. Love the crust.

Whatever you want to call it, it's delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly (other than the glaze and fruit choices)and placed in an 11 1/2 inch tart pan.  The crust turned out thick, but soft and yummy.  I didn't have orange juice so I just subbed raspberry lemonade and omitted lemon juice.  Slightly pink, but delish.  Oh, and I only used 4 kiwi and it was wonderful!

Perfect!  Took it to a BBQ and everyone LOVE it.  It was gobbled up quick!  I tripled the crust and used a 16 inch pizza pan.  No need to triple the glaze.

Made it with no changes and it turned out great. The crust stayed crisp through to the last piece eaten after 3 days and still as fresh looking and tasting.

We loved this reciepe, I used a spring form pan which worked very well, it held in the glaze until I was ready to serve. Next time for the cream cheese I will mix it with equal parts marshmello puff rather than the sugar, it will give me more filling and I often used that combination for a fruit dip

This has become a family favorite. I made a few changes. First I cut the sugar by about 1/4 in both the crust and filling. I also add non-fat plain Greek yogurt to the filling. I add about a cup and a half (I’m not good about measuring!)
I like to think it’s a little more healthy!

This fruit flan has a thin and rich crust. One of my favorite desserts to make and eat. Even though I don't have a sweet tooth, this flan is amazing. If you  want to make it sweeter, you should add the glaze but I prefer without the sauce. Amazing! Well done! This recipe should be remembered for a long time.

Want to give it 5 stars, but the jelly roll crust did not bake in 12 minutes. Mine took 16 minutes. Thought the filling amount was stretched too thin.  I may make vanilla pudding for the filling next time. Maybe half the crust portion and place in a pie pan or tort pan. Fresh fruit and glaze was 5 stars, tho. I'd like a recipe for the crust minus the oil, perhaps.

Amazing. I baked the crust on a medium size pizza stone. I added some sour cream to the cream cheese filling to make it easier to spread and creamier. Oh also don't forget to add little indents around the crust to make it pretty. Everyone raved about it and I gave out recipes.

Didn't change a thing and my flan turned out perfect.  Easy and fun to make, with the hardest part being that wait as the glaze to cooled, prior to brushing it over the fruit!!!

A keeper!!!

Didn't want the hassle of the crust so did a graham cracker one. Double the filling or its way too thin.  The glaze was thick so I thinned it with 1/4 c water. Still was very yellow and murky so I couldn't see the kiwis at all. Next time will use apricot jelly, my old standby.  So basically I kinda used the filling recipe but nothing else. I did use all the photos for layout of the fruit!

I've made this last night and turned out really great! I followed the instruction step by step. Only the baking of my crust took longer like 30 minutes before it turned to golden brown. I also use lemon juice because I didn't have orange juice available. And I also increase the cream cheese like the others are suggesting 1 1/2  (8oz.) package. My husband love it and I will make one for his mom, soon. Thank you for sharing your recipe! God bless your heart!

It came out good.  However, the next time I make it, I will use a bigger pan.  The crust was too thick.  I will also double the filling.

This recipe was perfect! As already stated, it's not a flan, but more of a delicious fruit pizza with a sugar cookie/tart type base, and a delicious cream cheese layer and glaze. As recommended by another commenter, I made an extra 1/2 recipe of the cream cheese layer. I also substituted the baking soda and cream of tarter for baking powder as that's all I had on hand. It turned out lovely! Quick to make (just add in some time to let things cool before adding the next step), very simple, and everyone loved it. Will make many more times!

Delicious. My daughter made this for my husband and me for our anniversary. Fruit "flan" like this from the grocery store was always one of his favourites but this is so much better! No changes except we included peaches among the fruit.  We will definitely make this again!

I don't go to all the trouble of making the flan base when I can buy a nice one in the grocery store. I make this a lot and we love it. If you can find pomegranite seeds, they are wonderful sprinkled over the top.

I made this to take to a dinner party - it looked spectacular and the glaze was delicious! I was pressed for time so I did a quick sweet pastry base and it turned out great. I'll try the recipe base next time. I thought the filling was a little bland - I'd like to try it with a custard/ patisserie cream type filling. Definitely one I will make again.

I made this for my daughters birthday. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out amazing. This was very easy not time consuming and definately will become a family favourite. Thank-you so much, a truly wonderful recipe.
