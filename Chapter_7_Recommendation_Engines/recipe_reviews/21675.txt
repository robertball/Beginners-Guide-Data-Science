Great muffins.  I did some modifications.  I replaced the oil with applesauce and cut the sugar in half.  Also used chopped ham on hand instead of bacon.  Delcious savory muffins.  A definite keeper.

These are excellent!!!   Mine turned out great--not too dry at all.   The only deviation from the original recipe was that I didn't have any wheat germ to add.  I just substituted extra flour for it.  I also added a handful of shredded Italian blend cheese (though I don't think this would effect the moistness any).  I baked mine in a mini-muffin pan (for the same amount of time) for our church's after-service Easter Brunch--I can't wait to share them!!!  (of course, I had to test 1 or 2--OK, maybe 3, first!)

My fiance' and I loved this!  I substituted turkey bacon, and added some cheddar cheese....yummy!  I didn't have any wheat germ on hand, I am wondering how that effects the recipe?  Anyone?

I found this recipe after whining about all breakfast foods being sweet.  I substituted turkey bacon instead of regular bacon, used 2 packets of Splenda instead of regular sugar, and swapped out 1 of the cups of flour with whole wheat flour.  I also added onions (because I love them).  All in all, I'm very happy with the result and will make again (:

Thanks for sharing a nice recipe. These were great. I even froze some of them for a quick on the go "breakfast". I can pop one in the microwave for 20 seconds or so, and run out the door with it! I added organic flax seed to mine, so they were a bit more dense, but it gave them a really nice texture as well.  They're nice with butter, and easy to feed to small children.  Certainly worth a try. I think this recipe has great potential for personalizing with your favorites grains or even nuts etc.

Yanno, I wasn't too impressed by these as-written, but I'm sure they could be great with a few mods. I'm thinking if I do these again, and I'm sure I will, I'll use more meat and substitute bacon drippings or lard for the butter. The problem, as it were, is that the batter is delicious but just tastes like dough, and the bacon and corn pieces are few and far between.

I also second the reviewer who said these could be delicious with some green onions, which I plan to add next time.

The adults loved this recipe at our Christmas Brunch. It was great and as noted, not a sweet muffin. It worked well with the many sweet coffe cakes we had.

My 5 year old says, "these are so yummy, I just can't stop eating them!" I added cheddar cheese but otherwise stuck to the recipe. I think I will use maple syrup and/or bacon drippings for some more flavor next time. I did both regular muffin size and mini-muffins, kids loved the little ones since they are so easy to eat with no mess.

This is a great quick savory muffin recipe that could be varied quite easily.  Also a great side dish for soup.
I did not use salt and used corn kernels instead of creamed corn ( because i didn´t have in cupboard).
I also added 1/4 cup of grated cheese which works well.

For a healthy alternative to sugar, I used maple syrup instead. My kids didn't know the difference and are chowing down! Great breakfast with blueberries!

I loaded the batter up with extra cheese, bacon, ham, tomatoes, peppers, mushrooms, and onion, this also made the batter go further.  I have no idea the quantities as I guesstimated :)

You can do a lot with this recipe. In one version, I added a large handful of diced long horn cheddar, and pecans (or perhaps it was walnuts; I can’t remember which). Based on reviewers’ suggestions, I added maple syrup in place of sugar, substituted a portion of flour with whole wheat and wheat germ. Added two chopped, hard-boiled eggs and used my tofu bacon recipe in place of the pig bacon. The cheese and other extras I added help keep the muffins moist for the week. For another version I got rid of all the add-ins except the cheese and soy bacon, and added sautéed onion, mushroom and broccoli. (No maple syrup in this version). Next time I’m going to use apples (peeled and chopped and sprinkled lightly with cinnamon) with a sharp cheddar, the corn, and maple syrup. Maybe I’ll throw a chopped egg in there; we’ll see.

Very nice, well-formed muffin. I used applesauce and bacon drippings, rather than oil and butter. Added some canned chili peppers & a little cheese.

I think this would make a good base recipe. I made this exactly the way the instructions were written with the exception of 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup all purpose flour.   The overall texture was great, moist on the inside, kinda crunchy on the outside.  The taste however was quite bland.  If I decide to try this again, I would definitely add something like onion powder or maybe some cheese as some suggested.

I actually had to make a few last minute substitutions - no creamed corn so just used frozen kernels with additional milk and used about 1 1/4 cups whole wheat flour plus 3/4 cup white flour. These muffins were still exceptional. Will definitely make again!

i made these as specified, but without wheat germ.  i did not increase the flour to adjust the recipe, and these turned out great and moist.  i added about half cup of grated cheddar cheese, and these were addictive.

I followed the recipe  exactly except the sugar.  I used only 1 tablespoon of sugar and that made it sweet enough for me.  Also, I DID add a bit of mustard.  I found it delicious.  Will make again.

Great recipe.  The only thing I changed was I made it in a 9x13 glass cake pan.  Couldn't find the muffin tin.  Worked out great.  Next time maybe I'll add a little onion.

We really liked these.  I used half whole wheat flour and half all purpose.  I also used applesauce and bacon grease for the oil/butter.  Next time I'll probably add a little more bacon.

I was looking for a recipe that I could convert to 'dairy free' so I made the following substitutions:
milk = rice dream
butter = dairy free sunflower spread.  
I also added a handful of chopped orange  capsicums, one small finely chopped onion, some parsley and some ham (did not have any bacon)

The muffins were delicious and my one year old demolished one on his own.

My only suggestion would be to cut down on the sugar as they are a bit sweet for my taste.  Next time I'll try just one tbsp and see how that goes.  Other than that - YUM!

Great muffins!  way to go recipe writer :)  my batter was very dry so i added some of my boyfriends beer.  It lighten up the texture made them fluffy and chewy (just how he likes them)  Also I added cheese and used frozen corn.   Oh yeah, I added sliced cherry tomatoes on the top just before I slid them in.   Thank for the great recipe :)

This recipe is a good idea - I love having non-sweet breakfast ideas.  I use 2/3C whole wheat four in place of 2/3 C white and leave out the wheat germ.  I also leave out the butter, cut the oil to 3 Tbsp and use the whole can of corn.  I just tried these with ham instead of bacon, as one reviewer suggested and - YUM! at least as good as the bacon.  Thanks for the recipe!

Used sausage instead of bacon, used a bit less salt and used only 1/2 of the oil.  Turned out really well.

After reading all the reviews I decided to make these for Father's day.  They were not a hit.  My husband said they tasted like a corn dog in a muffin.  He asked me not to make them again.  I didn't think they were horrible but they weren't great, kind of lacking flavor.

This sounds great but I've got a gluten free diner to worry about - would these work with corn meal or can someone tell me a good gluten-free flour that would work?

I would also add in a little bit of grated cheddar cheese for a decadent touch.    But these sound amazing as is as well.   Will try soon and review again.   Thanks for the recipe.

These could be five star excellent with some modifications. I am someone that does not really care for sweet muffins for breakfast. These need a little more taste with the addition of cheddar or additional flavor. I will try again though these have great potential.

These did not work for us.  I did make some modifications to the recipe, but I question whether or not that was the issue.  I used 1 cup whole flour and 1 one cup all purpose flour trying to make it a little healthier for my toddler.  My son didn't like them and neither did I.  I will not be trying the recipe again.

These are so good! I served them at a brunch, along with a sweet muffin, and everybody said how good they were. These savory muffins were quickly gobbled up and gone. The sweet muffins were also good but they did not disappear nearly as fast as these savory muffins. I will certainly make them again.

Perhaps I did something wrong, but I found these muffins to be a HUGE disappointment.  I prepared as recipe states and made no changes (as did other cooks), however mine came out extremely dry, crumbly and had a strange flavor.  Maybe I baked too long, but they were barely brown.  Maybe the corn is what I didn't like and adding cheese would help.  I am not sure, but I will not make these again.

As I always do the first time, I made this recipe as written.  Next time I'll add more bacon and fresh corn instead of canned.  I also think a can of chopped chilis and/or mexican corn and cheese would be a good change up in flavor.  Much better than those egg/sausage biscuits I've been making!

Very bland as written, and dry.  I put a little butter on them and drizzled them very lightly with maple syrup, and that helped, but I don't think this one is a keeper.

Loved this recipe. I added diced pancetta instead of bacon, a little shredded cheddar cheese, and an extra tablespoon of flour (no wheat germ). The result was a moist muffin with yummy chunks of meat. Served warmed up, slathered with butter, and drizzled with maple syrup, my husband loved his Father's Day treat!

This is a good recipe. My family loved them. I make the recipe as written first. Then I add or subtract ingredients. I think next time I will add onion and some cheese. However this is a good recipe. The only thing I didn't have is wheat germ. I use it seldom and didn't have any on hand. Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

I found this recipe while looking for an old one I can't find.  The only thing that I notice that is different is cheddar cheese instead of corn.  I don't think corn sounds very good for breakfast.

I substituted whole wheat flour for the white flour (healthier) and whole kernels for the creamed corn (all I had that morning) and it still worked out great.  I think the creamed corn would be better and I will be sure to chop the bacon more next time too.  These are great for breakfast, but also with soup for lunch too.

I used ham instead of bacon as some others suggested and mixed in some chedder cheese... otherwise I followed the recipe. They were good but I think maybe a touch more salt and maybe some green onion would make these 5 star savory muffins!

Good "savory" muffin!  I needed something to go with baked Tilapia, risotto & grn. beans, and this fit nicely.  Everyone ate at least 2 and I was pleased with the results.  Thanks for a nice, hearty muffin recipe that I will use again!

I made these for breakfast to make something different and was not the slightest of impressed.  They did not seem to go to well with breakfast maybe with a bowl of chili or something they would have been better.  More than likely will not make again.

This was great the first time using the exact directions. The family didn't care for it but I did so to win them over, I added a few extra dashes or salt, used corn meal instead of wheat germ and threw in a large pinch of minced green onions. Now the whole family is digging in! :)

Nice breakfast alternative.  Great with some bacon inside and also using bacon fat.  Does seem a little dry, but that is always expected with corn breads.

They tasted good but were kind of dry, maybe because I omitted the cream corn (we don't have that here). I'll try them again substituting something else to get them moister.

My hubby LOVED these. I used 3 Tb. flax meal instead of the wheat germ, and used the bacon drippings (came to 1/4 exactly) + 1/8 c. of melted butter and oil each. Also used the whole can of creamed corn. My hubby said they could have used more salt, I preferred them as is. Perfect!

These muffins were very good.  I made them exactly as recipe called for.  I like the suggestion of using chopped ham instead of bacon and will do that next time as they were fairly greasy.

These are very good. I was looking for breakfast muffins to bring on a road trip and these were the only savory ones that looked like they would keep. I used my bacon drippings in lieu of oil, and added some Dubliner cheddar that I needed to use up. Also threw in some chives so I could pretend they were healthy. My 5 year old likes them, and that’s a win.

First, let me say that I messed up slightly AND my mess up is directly related to my complaint. So take the review for what it's worth.  

I added 1 CAN of creamed corn instead of 1 CUP of creamed corn. That being said, I don't think the taste of corn worked with this recipe. These are breakfast muffins and just shouldn't taste like corn muffins. Again, I put too much corn in them so take that for what it's worth, but if you too are looking for a traditional breakfast muffin, you may want to consider a substitute for the creamed corn (not sure what that would be).

delicious! i brought the dry mix in a bag to a friend's house for a sleepover. in the morning, i just fried the bacon (i would recommend using more than 4 slices) , added the wet stuff--eggs, milk corn butter and oil  and baked. This delicious breakfast muffin was ready in no time which was great because we had a hangover haha
