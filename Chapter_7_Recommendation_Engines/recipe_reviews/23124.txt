With a few additions this is a rich and satisfying stew.  I changed the flavor profile by adding 1 teaspoon ground ginger, 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper, 2 tablespoons creamy peanut butter, and 1 tablespoon tamari soy sauce.  This gives the recipe a rich and peanut base with a gingery, spicy kick.

As has been said before this is bland if made as is. Like a clear broth. If that is what you want, you will like this.  But there is no reason why vegan food cant be delicious. 

My advise.  Make it as written.  5-10 minutes before it is done, taste it.  The last 5 minutes wont change the taste.  If you dont like it, modify it per the reviews.  

I followed most of Athena_Girls advise (minus the red pepper) and a lil garlic (per another review) and the soup was a nice surprise!  I was leery about the peanut butter, but it worked out great.  If you arent sure about it, start with 1 Tablespoon.  Once you see what it does, you'll like it.  I also used sweet potatoes/yams.  The flavor was great! 4+ stars with the modifications. 

Oh, I think I ended up using 4 cups of water.  Add a bit of flour if you need to thicken it.

I really dug this! I love root vegetables, but I substituted broccoli and celery for the parsnip and turnip, as we didn't have any. And threw in alittle more salt. Also had to add alot more water! But I loved it!

I did not care for this recipe. It was quite spicy, which is a good thing normally - except when it overpowers the flavor.  Speaking of flavor, outside of the spices, there was none.  I looked in the pot while I was cooking and said, "This is a very beige meal."  The parsnips and turnips, which I'd never tried before, were not good, and I doubt I'll eat them again.  One last thing... this makes a LOT of stew.  I cut the recipe in half and I could hardly finish one serving.  Two servings alone took up an around-three-quart pan.  I would suggest something, but nothing could really fix this recipe without completely changing it.  Oh well.

I also used this stew to break the master cleanse fast. I thought the pepper was great, in fact, added cayenne as well. Didn't use parsnips but added halved grape tomatoes, broccoli, celery, an extra onion, and 3 cloves of garlic. The stew had tons of color and flavor!

Quick and easy. Too spicy, so would cut back to 1/2 tsp pepper next time. Also, added garlic and sweet potato for more flavor.

A solid, simple recipe, and a good "foundation" for making vegan stew. You could take this recipe and add celery or peas or corn or any other cooking vegetable if you wanted to play around. Tasty and satisfying and goes really good with bread.

Excellently customizable stew.  The vegetables all blend very well together and are just waiting for a couple of your own spices.  I've done this recipe a few times, this time I added jalepeno and chili peppers because I like it spicier and increased the cumin and supplemented with tumeric because I like the Indian flavor.  But you can do whatever you want with it, I've tried very different things and it always comes out well as long as you experiment a little.  Very fun to make!

I left out the rice and turnip, added a sweet potato as well as regular potatoes, and added more parsnips. I also added the 2 tbsp PB, soy sauce and ginger, and dipped a hand blender in to puree half of it. So good!!

DELICIOUS!!! I used 50/50 vegetable stock and water (4 cups). Added a kittle extra salt and pepper on advice of others here. Great recipe.

Wonderful! Very satisfying.  If it seems bland to you, then just add your favorite spice, problem solved!  I didn't have parsnip or turnips, but I'll add them next time and I'm sure it will still be delicious.  Also, in addition to the water I added a couple of cans of vegetable broth, and I added a couple of diced tomatoes (can't have stew without them!), and of course garlic (I have to add it to everything!). It was fabulous and can't wait to make again!

I alternated this recipe somewhat based on other reviews and this was seriously delicious, not to mention absurdly simple. I only had one of each vegetable so I added a little leek and a stalk of celery. Instead of the rice I added 1/4 cup of barley. I tossed everything into a pot with 4 cups of water, 2tbl peanut butter, 1tsp ginger and 1tbl soy sauce and let it do its magic. It was a tad thick at the end of its cooking time so I added about 1/2 cup of veg broth. I'm really looking forward to eating some leftovers tomorrow! On top of it being so satisfying, per serving, it is low in calories and fat. You won't be disappointed!

For a thicker, calcium rich stew I added a few tablespoons of chia seeds.  Otherwise, I followed athena girls suggestions and it was delicious!

This is very satisfying. I have made is several times and really just add the veggies that I have on hand or that I can find at the local store. I also add some type a bean that I have available to make is a little more hearty...

The soup is good and all, but it's very spicy from the pepper.  But don't be fooled by the photo, cause it's not that colorful. It's all white.

I adapted this a bit (and may a little more later).  Used all recipe veggies, rice (I used brown rather than white), cumin, and pepper.  I love the idea of adding celery or maybe cauliflower in another review as well as the other suggestions mentioned (maybe next time). Rather than water, I used "Vegetarian No Chicken Broth" and a bit of water (enough to cover veg) as the 2.5 C didn't seem like enough liquid. I also added 2 tsp minced garlic. I didn't add salt as the broth seemed to have plenty and since my partner has a heart condition, we try to limit salt in food. Overall, we were pretty happy with the outcome.

5 STARS!!  Used sweet potatoes for the potatoe. The ONLY thing I added was 1 TBS of Herbes de Provence (www.spicemerchants.biz) and about 1-1/2 cups of additional water as the author suggested. This was absolutely delicious!!!   I was going to put peas and lima beans in too but I didn't want to veer too far from the original recipe. I am very glad I didn't. Very excellent as is, I would not change anything else.  A definite favorite!!

I made this because I had a TON of veggies to use up. I used onion, carrots, potatoes, parsnips, leeks, and kale. This was super easy but very bland. I kept adding all kinds of spices.. still bland, and then I found a way to give it a kick: BBQ sauce! I added a honey chipotle bbq sauce which gave the stew lots of flavor.

Good basic stew, I swapped a couple of ingredients to suit what I had in the house and it still turned out good. I'd recommend people only put half the amount of pepper in though otherwise it's too spicy.

I slightly modified the soup to include tomato because I had no parsnips or turnips, but that didn't stop the soup from being delicious. As has been said before, this recipe provides a good foundation from which derivative recipes can flow. The only thing I would have done differently is cut the potatoes smaller and put less pepper. I left the potatoes rather chunky, and user cassiopeia is completely right when they suggest to  cut back the pepper to 1/2 tsp. Good advice says I.

I made this stew as I was coming off of The Master Cleanse diet, and it turned out to be very appropriate for that purpose.

Unfortunately, no one in the family liked this one.  It wasn't very flavorful and my daughter particularly did not like the parsnips.  Perhaps if I had used different veggies it would have been better.  Corn might have added to flavor and color also.

I think this recipe needs more seasoning.  It was a little bland, even though I used vegetable broth in place of the water.  I would probably leave out the rice next time.  I would have given it 3 stars, but my kids *loved* it, probably because the parsnip and carrots gave it a nice sweet flavor.

A great base recipe! I used veggie broth instead of water and also added sweet potato, corn, peas, and some acorn squash. I like how it has a sweeter taste to it. Great the next day too.

Loved the flavor of the turnips and parsnips.  Was a hit with my kids.  I threw in a can of chickpeas to add protein to this dish.  Also changed to brown rice but need to put in at beginning so the brown rice will soften up enough.  Very versatile recipe.  Make it your own.

With Athena_girl's additions it's fantastic! I also use the two biggest turnips I could find instead of using potatoes. A little bit of garlic.. And viloa. I also substituted half of the water with vegetable broth. And added a bit of both as needed.

Loved the stew. We did omit the onion and regular potatoes, and replaced them with minced garlic and sweet potatoes.. We also omitted the cumin (not a fan). Celery, fresh shucked corn, one bay leaf, and about 4 cups of water was added. Very tasty, thanks for the recipe.

Used what I had, sweet potatoes, potatoes, turnips and used veg broth for half the liquid.  Not a vegan or even vegetarian and this was delicious!  Would use this base with various veggies.

I did not have turnips or parsnips so instead  used half a head of cabbage. Also, I added one more cup of water plus 1/2 cup of almond milk. Then I did not have cumin so I used 2 tsp of curry powder and 2 tsp of mustered. I also added an extra tsp of salt and some garlic.I used brown instead of white rice. Next time I will use more.  It was very good, but a little too hot. Next time I will half the black pepper and add tomato.
