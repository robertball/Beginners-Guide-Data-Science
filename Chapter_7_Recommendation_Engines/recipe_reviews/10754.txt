I baked this recipe in a well greased bundt pan for about 45 minutes - it was awesome - not your typical zucchini bread.  I used the grated rind and juice of one lemon.  I could eat the whole thing but I won't.

Simply put, WOW!!! I did not make many alterations, as I like to try a recipe pretty much as written the first time. I did sub 1/2 of the sugar with Splenda, as I'm diabetic, and every little bit helps. In subsequent efforts, I have added 1 cup of halved fresh cranberries, and the color/tartness ratchets up the taste to stellar! The red from the cranberries and green flecks from the zucchini made it quite festive looking. That little kick of tartness from the berries makes the lemon flavor sing! No problem with excessive oiliness using the full cup, but you could shave off 2 TB without a problem if it makes you feel better.  Something told me to check on them about 10 minutes before the 45 minute alarm, and they were done, so only 35 minutes baking time was perfect. A toothpick in the center came out clean, and the center was firm to the touch. Be sure to disregard the baking times in the recipe and set your alarm for 35, at least to start. Overbaking could account for some of the tepid reviews. Please know they should turn out soft and moist, more like a cake than bars. After baking, I brushed on a glaze made from 2 Tb softened butter, 1 tsp fresh lemon juice, 1 tsp milk and 1 cup confectioners sugar, while they were still warm from the oven. It increased the fresh lemon flavor. It did not taste remotely "oily" (and as a trained chef, I have a ridiculously sensitive palate,) so I'd suspect that those who found an oily taste were using rancid or old oil.

Light and lucious - Didn't peel the zucchini which left the bars with "green things" but didn't affect the taste.  I freeze the correct amount of grated zucchini with the lemon rind and during the winter I've got a head start on these bars!!

This was very good. I only used half the oil and 1/2 cup applesauce in place of all the oil and I always use whole wheat pastry flour. Used 3/4 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar splenda for baking in place of all the sugar. It was moist, and so delicious. Will make this one again! I baked in a bundt pan for 45 minutes and topped it with a little powdered sugar and lemon juice mixed. MMM, delish!

Dee-licious.  Moist  (a cup of oil makes that a no-brainer), lemony, but not too lemony, and prettily flecked with green zucchini.  I omitted the nuts because I didn't want their distracting flavor here.  Good call, for us anyway, as this cake has a very delicate flavor, because it's not burdened with spices typically associated with zucchini breads/cakes.  I baked this as little cakes in small Bundt pans and gave them a lemon glaze of a cup of powdered sugar and 2 T. lemon juice - perfect to enhance that fresh, tart lemon flavor.  (Important note: there is NOT enough batter here for a standard size Bundt pan.  I know, because I tried - then dumped it out and filled small Bundt pans 2/3 full instead)

I also used a well greased and floured bundt pan for this recipe.  It came out very well.  I always use the rind when shredding the zucchini.  It provides color and fiber for the diet.

This cake was moist and tasty.  I topped it with confectioners sugar as the recipe called for, but a light lemon flavored icing would be nice drizzled on top of the bundt cake, as an alternative.  Suggestion: Orange zest and orange juice could be substituted for the lemon zest and lemon juice.

I will make this again!

Yes, this is definitely a cake especially when you bake in a bundt pan as many did. I used 1/2 cup oil and and 1/2 cup applesauce. I used half white and half brown sugar. I also added a lil extra lemon juice and extra zucchini to the mix. I partially peeled the skin from the zucchini so there was just a bit of greenness flecked throughout. The cake baked up in about 40 minutes in my bundt pan (make sure you grease/flour it well). This morning I made a glaze out of confectioners sugar and the juice/zest of half a lemon. I drizzled on top of the cake and let it seep down into the cake adding extra flavor and moisture. The results were a great balance of sweetness; tartness and wetness. My coworkers are thoroughly enjoying.

I thought that this recipe was a refreshing change from the typical zucchini bread recipe.  I took one of the other reviews suggestions and also used a bundt pan and baked for 45 min.  In response to those who said that they could taste the oil, check your oil it's probably ransid.

Maybe I did something wrong :( but I didn't like these. The taste was fine, but I did not care for the texture. I have tons of zucchini so I might try again, but with more flour and less baking soda. I like a firmer, more cake like bar. These were too "airy".

This turned out delicious! I subbed half the oil with unsweetened applesauce & half the sugar with a sugar substitute & my husband loved it! I also added 1/2 tsp lemon extract because I love lemon :)

This is more of a cake than a bar. Very lemony! Followed the recipe as is the first time and it was good. The second time I made it I replaced half the oil with applesauce, reduced the sugar by a quarter cup and the flour by half a cup,  added a half cup of chocolate chips rather than the nuts. Liked it even better!  Next time I will ice it with a thin layer of lemon cream cheese frosting and I think it will be perfect. Excellent way to use up some Zucchini!

Phenomenal and so easy! I followed the recipe but used yellow squash instead of zucchini (all I had) and add semisweet chocolate chips. Sooo good! I will definitely make this again.

I made this as part of my holiday cookie plate that I give to my friends and family and they truly enjoyed. Variations I made: I made this with all organic ingredients and I added organic chocolate chips to the recipe which was even more flavorful.

I strayed pretty far with my modifications for this recipe, but it was still pretty good.  I used limes and lime zest in place of the lemons (the green from the zucchini and green from the limes go well together).  I used 1/2 cup applesauce for 1/2 cup oil, half whole wheat flour, egg beaters, and 3/4 cup sugar (I wouldnt cut back because I dusted the top with confectioner's sugar at the end because it wasnt sweet enough).  I baked mine in a jelly roll pan for only 20 minutes. I like how it came out very spongy and light.  Next I will try this with lemon or orange.

OMG ! I  wasn't expecting this cake to be this moist and  busting of lemony flavor ! I just had a slice with some tea and I am struggling to keep myself from getting more..
I followed exactly, except by omitting the nuts and baking for only 30 minutes. If using a  9X13 pan , you won't need to bake longer than that.
If Any change needed to improve this recipe, next time, it would be to cut down the oil little bit, maybe, to  3/4 cup. My fingers got greasy just from picking up the cake pieces to store in a box.

When one of my favorite cooks on this site loved this recipe with a full cup of oil, I used the full cup.  And, the only thing I did do differently was to throw a half lemon in my food processor (since it was out for the zucchini) rather than juicing and zesting a lemon for the lemon ingredients - I ultimately had 1/4 C of lemon contents, the same as the recipe requires.  The cake is light and flavorful, but it does not need a full cup of oil!  My oil was new (I used canola) and although it doesn't have an oily taste, it is too wet after 60 mins of baking in a 10 cup bundt pan.  It is fully baked, but I feel that 2/3 or 3/4 C oil would be just fine in the future.  I will make this again with that one change.  The lemon flavor is great using this process - it's from another recipe on this site.

This is a pretty good recipe.  I did expect more of a lemon flavor using 1/4 cup lemon juice and I did cut down on the sugar.  Very moist.  Thanks for the recipe.

I love the fluffiness of this cake!  I have made zucchini bread in the past that was very dense and heavy, so this was a nice light treat.  I may try it without the walnuts, which my kids don't like so much.

My husbands supervisor at work sent home a brown grocery bag FULL of zucchini last night. With more zucchini that I knew what to do with, I started chopping, shredding, & freezing. My mom has a delicious zucchini bar recipe (that I don't have) so I wanted to find something similar. This is okay but it is missing something. I have one word of caution though. If using a cookie sheet, the baking time is WAY TOO LONG! I baked mine for 26 minutes and it was a little over done. When I peeked into the oven about 10 minutes in, the edges were already starting to brown a little so I turned down the temp about 20 degrees. It's an okay recipe but won't make again.

This was delicious.  I had lemons and 2 zucchini leftover from the holidays that weren't going to last much longer.  So I made these with the intent to freeze them for later when we had company.  Unfortunately, Company will never see these bars.  Great recipe!

i tried this with the fresh orange zest/juice instead of the lemon as a reviewer suggested, since that's what i had.  i also used 1/2 c. brown and 1/2 c. white sugar, 1/2 c. oil and 1/2 c. cinnamon applesauce.  left out the nuts.  baked in bundt pan for 40 minutes (glad i checked -- had set for 45 like other reviewers).  made a glaze out of the other 1/2 orange juice and 1/2 c. powdered sugar.  it is not too sweet, a MUCH better version of cranberry-orange bread or a citrus-y scone.  looking forward to having a piece for breakfast with a strong cup of coffee!

Just took out of oven, smells great and tastes great, only change was only 1 cup of sugar, and surely sweet enough. Grandchildren stopping by after school, hope they like it too, will let you know

I was very disappointed with this recipe.  The flavors of the zucchini didn't blend with the lemon and there is a strong oil taste.  I'm waiting to see if the flavor improves with time, but I doubt it.  I won't be making this again.

This is a great way to use up a bumper zucchini crop.  Very light and tasty.  I put in 3 tsp of lemon rind and decreased the sugar to 1 cup.  I substituted the oil with 3/4 cup unsweetened applesauce and 1/4 cup olive oil.  There was no oily residue and it tastes great!  I baked it in a bundt pan at 350 for 45 min.  I saw another reviewer state that there wasn't enough mix to fill the bundt pan.  Mine was 2/3 full and it was perfect.  Because of the eggs, the dough rises and extra space is needed.  I will definitely make this again.

Reviewers said it was heavy on oil so I used 1/2 cup and it was still yummy. Also used a lemon juice and powder sugar glaze on top for extra lemon flavor. I will make this again.

This was good, nice and lemony and a nice change from the typical zucchini bread. I also made it in a bundt pan, and it came out pretty well.  I think next time I'll take the recommendations of others and switch out half the oil with applesauce.

I didn't have a lemon so I substituted with more lemon juice. The taste was bland! I could taste the oil more than the lemon. I was hoping for a stronger lemony taste.

The oil was overwhelming and made the texture greasy. I ended up smothering it with a lemon juice / confectioner sugar / butter frosting to improve it to be edible. Will have to try this recipe again with a few changes. Needs a more lemon taste to the cake (couldn't even taste it), and swap 1/2 the oil for either lemon yogurt or applesauce.

I made this according to the recipe except using half gluten-free flour and half coconut flour.. and I used slivered almonds as I am allergic to walnuts.  Loved it, would use more lemon next time and a little lemon extract to make it more lemony.  My husband loved it and didn't know it was gluten-free until after the fact!  Also, I forgot to garnish with powered sugar but no one noticed.

A very good recipe to use up extra summer zucchini surplus.   I wanted a treat to share at school and this fit the bill and everyone enjoyed it.  I baked for 35 minutes in different shaped pans.  I should have gone with my gut feeling and cut back on the amount of oil the recipe called for.  I was going to go with 3/4 cup, and I should have.  The texture and taste were nice, although they left grease marks on the serving platter from all the excess oil.  I liked the lemon zest in the recipe and will double the amount, the next time.  The light sprinkle of powdered sugar was perfect a perfect topping.

This was so good!  I have an old zucchini bread recipe that I've been making for years, and I just tried this one.  Love it.

I took some of the suggestions from the comments: used 1/2 cup apple sauce for half the oil and added some dried cranberries.  Also, I made a lemon glaze for the top, about 1/2 cup powdered sugar and probably less than 1 tbl spoon of lemon juice. It made a lovely glaze for the "cake". 


Great recipe, thank you so much for posting it.

This would have been a GREAT recipe if I hadn't left it in the oven for 45 minutes(in a 9x13) as stated. My own fault though, I should have paid more attention. Now I have NO lemon bars.

Moist and scrumptious only gave 4 stars because I think it could use a bit more lemon flavor. Otherwise it's fantastic!!!

One important thing...  don't use oil, it will make the bread taste rancid !  Use butter or a mix of butter and margarine.  All the rest is good.

Perhaps it is an altitude difference, I live in a high altitude area, but didn’t add anything for it. This is a cake! There is NOTHING  “bar like” in my cake pan. I made a zucchini -lemon cake. It tastes sweet and probably as it should.  It would probably be good with a lemon frosting.

it was tasteless, and not enough lemon juice or zest. 
I am going to make a glaze to put over it, so it doesn't go to waste. This recipe needs help in the taste department!
I will never use this recipe again.

To make a gluten-free version I used GF flour, increased baking powder to 1/2 tsp and added 1/2 tsp xanthum gum.  
To decrease fat, I substituted 1/2 oil with apple sauce.  It needed a few more minutes baking but result was delicious. 
Will be making this cake often.

I used half cup canola oil & half cup apple sauce.
I peeled zucchini so there were no green flecks although I think that’s a pretty touch.  Very moist and holds together well . No falling apart . Would be a good choice for packing  in lunch box, etc.  I purchased canned icing but it was awful . Almost rancid . Did not use nuts due to some family with allergies. I skipped the icing and used canned squirt on whipping cream. Very tasty - lemon was subtle. Definitely tastes home baked.

This was so greasy that when I picked up a piece, it started falling apart and left oil on my fingers! I wouldn’t even try it, but my husband put some cream cheese on it and said it was “okay.” Not sure if it would be worth making again with less oil. I’ll probably just stick to zucchini bread from now on.

Good recipe! I did not make any changes but I did add a lemon glaze for the top instead of using powdered sugar.  If I make this again I will use more lemon zest or add lemon extract to the batter and substitute the oil with butter.

I used alternative flours, cut sugar to 1 cup with a mix of white and Palm Sugar. Did not have Walnuts, instead I used about 3/4 cup Hemp Seeds. Very yummy! My baking pan is glass and seemed huge so I cut baking time to 25 minutes or so., was perfect. Depending on your oven it's  always good to toothpick test cakes about 10 minutes before full baking time advised. I would rather have a nice moist cake rather than one that is over done and dry.

Well I’ve been on a zucchini bread frenzy baking. I totally misread the instructions and placed the dough into a bread pan. So no bars but it did make a lovely bread loaf & a. Mini. I decided not to add the walnuts I though it would make to heavy. It was still very good. I would have preferred a lemon frosting like that of Starbucks lemon loaf. Now in search of it & think it would be a 5 star!

Absolutely great cake! I've made it a couple of times and in both I adjusted the oil, baking powder and soda amounts...more baking powder and less soda as well as a bit less oil and yeah, less almonds (didn't have that much) and it turned out yummm! Looking forward to add cranberries like someone here suggested.

Update: friends who tried this are now asking me for the recipe =)

Followed recipe all the way, and although the flavor was there (not spectacular), it was soggy on the bottom, even though I left it in the oven an additional 10 minutes.  Perfectly browned on top though.

We did not like these. Very sweet. Odd texture and i totally get what people said about oily. Its almost like when you fry something in oil that wasnt quite hot enough....it retains to much of the moisture.   Sadly, I threw away 3/4 of the pan.

I used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce because that is what I had.  Didn’t add walnuts because I didn’t have them.  Baked in a buddy pan for  38 minutes and it came out beautifully.  Will make again for sure!

Made this yesterday and loved it.  The  cake/bread is very moist.   Mine sunk a bit in the middle and I'm wondering if I should have adjusted for high altitude.  The zest in the mix is very refreshing and the lemon juice in the glaze is perfect.

This cake is sooooo moist thanks to the water content of the zucchini.  I did not have zucchini available, so I used yellow squash.  Plus, instead of just sprinkling powdered sugar over the top, I drizzled a lemon glaze over the cake.  Super delicious!

I was really unimpressed with this recipe. The “bar” was just pretty blah, not much of any flavor. It is more like a cake than a bar. I used 3/4 cup oil and it was still pretty oily I wouldn’t used more that 1/2 cup if I make again which I probably won’t.  Only thing that save this was the lemon icing.

This was a great base recipe!!! I made it vegan by subbing apple sauce for the eggs. I also doubled the amount of zucchini and baked it in cake pans to make a layered cake. It was the star of the party!!! I whipped up a vegan lemon frosting using lemon juice, lemon rind, powdered sugar, and vegan butter.

Added more flour for high altitude in CO.  It is more cakey/cornbreadish in texture than anticipated.  I was thinking it would be more lemon bar in density.  It was still very nice. Something I would envision on a fancy plate with a doily for high tea.  I took it to my weekly meeting at work and it was a big hit.  No leftovers.

This cake / bread was delicious. Super moist and amazing flavor. Love the color from the zucchini. I added raspberries the first time and I would recommend not doing that :) all sank and were mushy. Should have known.

Too much oil.  Actually used some butter to bring it to 1 cup which I'm sure improved the flavor.

I used pecans, instead of walnuts, increased the lemon zest by two times, added some poppy seeds. It was great. I don’t know why they call it bars. I’d call it cake. I’d make it again, for sure.

This was my first time baking with zucchini and it was a great success! Following the suggestions of others, I used half white sugar and half brown sugar, and half oil and half apple sauce. I also made a lemon glaze by combining 1 cup of icing sugar and two tablespoons of fresh lemon juice, then beat in a tablespoon of water and one to two tablespoons of melted butter.

Someone gave me a zucchini, so I figured I should do something with it.  I'm sure glad I did.  I've never had a zucchini bread before, and am delighted I started off with this one.  Wonderful!

Just made it again, with applesauce instead of oil.  Still wonderful.

I've been wanting to make lemon zucchini bread/cake for some time because I've seen so many delicious looking pictures on the internet. Now that I've made it, I'm disappointed that I don't like the lemon/zucchini  combination. And, like some other posters, I was able to taste the oil in this cake - I agree that it's too much.

I wanted to make this into a bread, so divided the mixture between 2 8x4 pans and baked for 45
minutes.   It turned out really well. 
I also lowered the sugar to 1 cup with great results. 
Then I drizzled some lemon juice over the warm loaves. Delicious!

This was definitely more like a cake than a bar.  It was nice and moist.  The family liked it.  Unfortunately, we did not have any lemons, so I couldn't put lemon zest in it.  I think that would have improved it since it wasn't very "lemony".  I will try again when I have lemon zest.

This was delicious!  So tender, light and moist.  Followed as written, except we didn't add the walnuts...my daughter doesn't like them.  Instead, we did as another reviewer did and added some frozen cranberries.  Not only did the bars look lovely, but the cranberry really added a nice flavor.  Zucchini is so mild that it's hard to taste it in most recipes, I find, so adding the cranberry gave the lemon something to go up against.  The lemon flavor was perfect.  I'm very glad we didn't add the walnuts, because I don't think the bars were dense enough for the nuts.  It actually seems more like a cake than a bar to me, but whatever you call it, make this recipe...it's so good!

I will make it again.  I will look for a lemon glaze instead of just dusting the powdered sugar on top.  I did acut oil back to 3/4C.  Next time I may also try applesauce sub for the oil.

It was very easy to make - my son loved helping with it! The lemon flavour was good, especially since I glazed the cake with a lemon glaze of 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and about 3 tablespoons of icing sugar. I baked it for 35 minutes, but next time might leave it till 45 - the middle was a bit soggy.

I loved this recipe, though I altered it a little, which made it basically a cake. I added more lemon juice, and 2 cups of zucchini instead of 1 & 3/4 cup. After baking it in a glass casserole, I also made a lemon glaze to go on top.

This is excellent - bar, cake, square - call it what you want.  I followed the recipe exactly, though I did add a tad more zucchini.  It wasn't greasy, couldn't taste the oil at all - 35 people who had it for dessert at the Sr Ctr lunch would agree with me.  It had a nice light texture, the flecks of green were really pretty.  The only thing I'd do different next time is to make a lemon icing to enhance the lemon flavour.  UPdate: I made these into mini cupcakes and iced them with lemon icing, took them for a meeting of 30 people.  People were actually raving about them.  The icing takes these to 5 stars.

Delicious! I didn't use as much sugar, but that's a personal preference. I also peeled the zucchini, only because I know my toddlers have 20/20 vision when it comes to "green stuff". Peeling the zucchini makes it the perfect camouflage! My 2 yo and 4 yo gobbled them up!

This was very tasty.  After looking at other reviews, I made some adjustments for my personal preference.  I added 3 tbsp. more lemon and zested 2 lemons.  I used 3/4 cup unsweetened applesauce and 1/2 sugar; 3 cups shredded zukes, 3/4 cup oil, 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1-1/2 cup ap flour,  2 tsp baking powder, 3 tsp baking soda, 1-1/2 tsp salt.and 1 cup pecans and baked in bundt plan  for 45 minutes.  The lemon flavor really came through and it was just moist enough to be really good.  I will definitely make again, probably with combo of zucchini and yellow squash.  Thanks for recipe

Wow! Delicious little cake! I didn't change the recipe at all and it turned out beautifully. There was no oily taste whatsoever. It was just nice and moist and it has a delicate, lovely flavor. Next time though, I may try replacing half the oil with applesauce, not because I think it would be better but just to try something different. Thanks for the recipe.

I did this twice, both in a bunt pan.  The first time, there was definitely way too much oil!  The second time,  I cut the oil to a 1/2 C and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and I upped the zucchini to 2 +1/2C and I used a bit of a larger grater.  I also used a little less lemon, because on the first run, it was very over powering.  The second time it tasted great!  I still feel I could cut back on the oil, maybe all the way down to a 1/4C, because it was still very moist, but still very delicious!

I made these gluten free, and they were delicious! I made several changes- I used 1 1/2 c. Krusteaz gluten free flour plus 1/2 c. almond meal; I used 1/4 c. oil and 3/4 c. unsweetened applesauce; I reduced the sugar to 3/4 c. because the applesauce adds sweetness; and I reduced the eggs to 2 (because that was all I had). Baked for 35 minutes, and drizzled with glaze of 1 c. powdered sugar and 2 Tbsp. lemon juice. Both those with and without celiac disease in our family loved them!

This cake was delicious!   I followed others advice and cut the oil to 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce.  I baked it for 55 min.  in a greased and floured bunt pan, and once cooled I applied a drizzle of powdered sugar and lemon juice.   I served this at a friends BBQ and everyone asked for seconds.   I will definitely make this again!

I had only about 3/4 cup sugar and that was sweet enough. I couldn't taste the lemon at all, so next time I will up it to 1/2 cup juice.

I mostly followed the ingredient list except I did a scant ½ cup melted butter and ½ cup unsweetened applesauce in place of the 1 cup of oil, and I left out the walnuts as I didn’t have any. It was very good but we thought that it did not have enough lemon flavour. I would make again but double the lemon rind and/or ice with a lemon icing.

Very moist, simple to make, and the zucchini and lemon flavours are well-balanced. I made no changes, except swapping pecans for walnuts.  A winner!

This was a great, light, moist cake.  Wouldn't consider it a "bar".  Instead of all the oil, replaced 1/2 cup with applesauce.  Same way for the sugar, used Splenda for half of it.  Made it again with orange zest and orange juice since I was out of lemons.  Just as good.

Delicious....although more a light, fluffy cake than a "bar" as titled. Another different and appealing way to use the season's bumper crop of zucchini.

I thought this recipe was decent.  I took the other reviewers' advice on swapping out 1/2 the oil for unsweetened applesauce.  It was plenty moist.  I omitted the walnuts mainly because I didn't want a nutty dessert when I made this.  I think the flavor of the nuts might be a little distracting for the dish having tasted it without.  The flavor was good but definitely not an intense lemon.  If you want more intense lemon flavor, definitely increase the zest or add lemon extract.  A nice lemon glaze might be good as well.  Overall this was a good dessert but won't be on my short list to make all the time in the summer when zucchini is abundant.

I did change the amount of oil 1/2cup 1/2 unsweetened applesauce. More lemon zest and lemon juice mixing the dry ingredients I accidentally put the baking soda in wet ingredients foamed up nicely! No walnuts,added the confectioners sugar on top after it cooled. Made two loafs. Every one commented on how light it was. Next time I would add an icing on the bread..

The texture is nice enough. I am glad I followed the many tips that said to substitute half the oil with apple sauce. But this recipe isn't nearly lemony enough for me! I probably won't make these again.

I found that the lemon and zucchini ended up mixing and making the bread taste a little fermented, almost like alcohol. Some of my family members really enjoyed it though so no bad reviews from us!

these were VERY tender. I actually made muffins/cupcakes. The recipe doesn't have NEARLY enough lemon flavor in it and has too much oil.

This was very good!  I used the zest and juice from oranges instead of lemons and it was delicious!  I also only used 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup stevia and it was sweet enough.  This is a great recipe for using up zucchini.  I plan on making it again with lemon.

Originally I could take it or leave it, but actually I would leave it coz it's not worth the calories.  I didn't taste the lemon at all.  I used 1 cup of sugar and could still cut back 1/4 cup I think.  I used almost all the called for vegetable oil, which was fine, but could cut back on that too or replace with 1/2 applesauce to decrease the guilt.  I only had 1 zucchini, which came out to 1 cup.  I used Pam on a bunt pan and cooked it for 45 minutes.  If I could taste the lemon this would be a great recipe....

This is a wonderful cake! I reduced the sugar to one cup and used a half cup applesauce for half of the oil. I glazed it with a lemon glaze of powdered sugar, lemon extract and a splash of almond milk. Everyone enjoyed it. Thank you!

Pretty good, I did bring the oil down to about 2/3 of a cup based on the other reviews, maybe could have even gone down to 1/2 cup? I used hazelnuts instead of walnuts just bc I'm not really a fan of walnuts and I cooked in 3 loaf pans instead of the 13×9. I was torn between a 3 or 4 star rating.

This was nice and easy and turned out well, but I did think the flavors were a little bland or weird or something. Maybe I'll add a lemon glaze next time. Like, I kept eating it, but I wasn't sure why ;p

Excellent change from typical cinnamon zucchini bread. I used the rest of my lemon's juice to make a bit of glaze for the top. Well received by coworkers :) I used yellow squash instead of zucchini and left out the nuts. Done in exactly 35 minutes (convect baked at 325). Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Overall, the texture of this recipe was excellent--light and moist! However, as-is, I did not think there was enough lemon flavor, and depending on the kind of oil you use, it may alter the flavor a bit. (I found the oil I used to be quite strong.) I may try this again with butter instead of oil or a more mild oil.

I won't make it again it just didn't stand out in flavor or looks.  I too used a bundt pan and I used half oil and half real butter after reading reviews that the bars tasted too oily.

I liked this but tend to not like walnuts, so next time will leave them out.  I took Sue's prior suggestion and left out the oil and replaced it w/ unsweetened apple sauce, used whole wheat pastry flour, and only used 3/4 cu sugar...no other sugar was needed.  I also made a glaze of confectioners sugar, the leftover lemon juice and peel-yum!  Everyone liked it, but forgot to take a pic before it was gone.

As a cake it is ok. A little too much oil for me.

Not a strong lemon taste.  Kinda cakey--not the dessert bar I thought it would be.  Still very good.

Not lemon-y enough.
