I WAS IN A PINCH BECAUSE I DIDN T HAVE A SECOND REFRIGERATOR PIE CRUST HANDY SO I LOOKED THIS UP AND IT CAME OUT FANTASTIC! IT SAVE THE DAY FOR ME! VERY EASY AND I HATE MAKING PIE CRUST FROM SCRATCH BUT THIS WAS FAST AND NO FUSS RECIPE. I JUST DON T BELIEVE IT WOULD WORK FOR A TOP CRUST WITHOUT HAVING TO ROLL IT OUT ON A FLOURED SURFACE
