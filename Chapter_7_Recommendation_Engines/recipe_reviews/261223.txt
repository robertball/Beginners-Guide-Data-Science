After making this for the first time my wife who has worked as a chef for 23 years said it is the best she ever tasted. I make it on a regular basis.

This turned out great! I actually marinated my beef in it before woking it and it works good that way too. I will cut back on the sugar next time but other than that I have no complaints.

I love this! Did not change a thing except I used minced garlic because I ran out of powdered. I will use low sodium soy sauce next time but someone in my house but a Costco size jug of it so am using that up. I am a vegetarian so I used it on veggies and meatless chicken. Fantastic.

Used it in stir -fry. Yum! I love that the recipe called for ingredients that I already had in my pantry. Our house smelled good for a long time after the meal. :) Thank you!

I will definitely make this again.  It was nice and thick and stuck to the meat (in this case steak tips).  Pretty simple to make, too!

BEST SAUCE EVER! The only thing i omitted was the onion powder only because i didn't have it on hand.  My kids LOVED it!! Will definitely make again.  This will be my go-to teriyaki.
