I was skeptical about this, especially since I got "green tea powder", not "matcha" at a chinese grocery store. But it worked out reeeeeally well.

Yum, yum, yum. I love anything with matcha in it! I must admit, 1 cup of ice cream only makes one serving in this household!

Not bad! A little too simplistic! But great flavor. Remember to use GOOD QUALITY vanilla ice cream it could make all the difference!

I mixed the tea powder with a tiny bit of water first thinking it would blend faster. Didn't really work as planned.  When I  added  to the ice cream it caused tiny little bits of frozen green tea but I  liked it like that. Mixed on a frozen marble slab and used Blue Bell Homemade vanilla.  I have some red tea powder that makes a fab cup of tea so I'm guessing will also make a yummy red tea ice cream. Fantastic idea, thanks!

I have a feeling this will be something that my friends would find interesting. This will be their first time to taste green tea ice cream, totally  different from the commercial ice cream. Will be back for more ice cream recipes :)

This was fantastic. It was just enough green tea. Perfect for a quick snack. I used soft vanilla ice cream, so I didn't need to pound it, just stir. I'll be making this for my family and friends.

Not sure about the whole pounding technique with this. It is just as easy to let the ice cream soften a little on the counter. The strength of matcha really varies form source to source. And it loses quite a bit of flavor with age. Start a with a little and then add more. Use the purest ice cream for this. If you refreeze the ice cream that has additives, you will be disappointed in the final product.  It gets foamy and flat especially from all the stirring. This is a great trick for instant green tea ice cream. I usually just want a little bit and it perfect.

I tried this recipe in order to get a sugar-free dessert for a diabetic friend who was coming to an Asian themed dinner, so I used S/F ice cream.  In order to get the Matcha mixed in well with the ice cream, it has to be pretty well melted.  Then if you re-freeze it, it is much harder and you loose a lot of volume.  So, after much thought, I decided to take it back out and put it in a mixer and whip it up again and then re-freeze it.  This worked OK -- at least saved me from having to throw away a whole carton of ice cream.  Also, the Matcha I bought was so strong that the flavor was overwhelming.  I had to also buy more ice cream to mix in before whipping it.  All in all -- too much bother and not a very satisfactory result.

Liked that we could make the flavor as strong as we wanted.  Broke my mixer blades because I didn't let the ice cream soften first.  Goes great with adzuki beans!

This is a good idea, but I have a feeling it would be much better if you just made your own vanilla ice cream, omitting the vanilla and adding the green tea powder before the mixture is frozen. If you try to add it to pre-made ice cream, it is a long and messy process to mix the powder in, leaving you with a somewhat bitter end product. However, I am thankful to have found this recipe, as it gives me the proper portions of green tea powder to use in my homemade ice cream. I will definitely be making my own green tea ice cream now. :3

This simple recipe is great! What a nice quick and easy way to create and enjoy matcha ice cream.
I buy those little 3 oz. cups of vanilla ice cream, because I don't eat ice cream very often so I don't want a big tub of it in my freezer. I mixed about 1/2 tsp of culinary grade matcha powder into one of those 3 oz. portions, and - poof! - fantastic matcha ice cream!
Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!
:)

Doesn't taste like matcha. Too much vanilla flavor still.
