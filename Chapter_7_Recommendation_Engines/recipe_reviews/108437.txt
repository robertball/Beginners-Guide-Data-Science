I thought this was pretty tasty.  I added 1/2 of a large can of mandarin oranges (as suggested) with the juice, and just blended it (don't have a juicer).  It was thick and chunky (with fruit), but delicious.  My husband and I loved it.  Will make again.

I had to add a splash of milk as it was rather thick, and I personally would have liked it a little sweeter. Apart from that, this wasn't bad at all. Thanks!

My friend's husband said, "This has potential."  And then he asked if there was any more!  He thought some mandarin oranges would make this drink even better.
