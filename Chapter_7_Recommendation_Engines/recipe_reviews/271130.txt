The feta cheese really kicks up the mild flavors of this wonderful recipe. I have made it twice for group events and it was a big hit at both!!

I would add more ingredients, maybe grilled corn taken off the cob, and would chop them into larger pieces. The seasoning was inadequate. I kept adding salt and pepper. Pretty bland salad.
