This recipe is very easy.  The texture of the rolls was great.  This is my first time trying a 'refrigerator dough', and I was very pleased with the results.  I used instant yeast instead of the cake.  The flavor was just a little too sweet for me.

Very good. I used 2 1/4 teaspoons of regular yeast instead of fresh yeast. Lightly sweet buttery rolls. I love that it is so easy and quick to put together. I still have enough for one more batch in the fridge. And the kids had a blast rolling them into horns. Thanks!

Added a little wheat and was surprised how light these rolls still were.  I made a half batch and used half of that for cinnamon rolls which were great.  Thanks for recipe, someone had given me this recipe in the past but I had lost it so was glad to find it again.

This is my new go to recipe! So easy and the rolls are so light and fluffly. I make cinnamon rolls with the dough or mix garlic and italian seasoning with the butter that's spread before they're rolled up. YUM!!

I made these with my 7 yr. old grandchild. They were easy to do and she was able to do a lot. It made 32 large rolls.

Delicious! And easy to make. I don't have a bread maker and haven't done rolls or bread in  years. Turned out great.

Pretty good and easy to make, if somewhat plain. For some reason mine burned on the rack near the top of the oven on top and burned on the bottom near the bottom of the oven. Extremely fluffy too, yet I would like it more flaky. This makes around 30 decent sized rolls.
