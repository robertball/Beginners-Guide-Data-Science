What a fantastic find!  I was looking for something different to 'spice up' our meal and came across this receipe.  The entire family gobbled them up.  I would recommend covering loosely with aluminum to hold in more juices.

This was really popular at my BBQ, with veggies and non-veggies alike, although I admit that as I didn't have any red wine vinegar I substituted rice wine for it instead.  One thing I would say though is not to leave them marinading for too long as a few of mine tried to fall apart as they were so soft.

I was looking forward to trying this recipe, but dissapointed in the results.  My husband and I both enjoy vinegars but the vinegar here is overpowering. He did not like the mushrooms at all, I thought they were just o.k.

Amazing! I live in Alaska and it was 15 degrees outside when I put the mushrooms on the grill-and it was totally worth it! Spicy and savory, a must for summer entertaining!

hmmm... I'm going to suppose that the soy sauce we get down here in Peru is much stronger that the american one, 'cause these mushrooms were waaaay too tangy for comfort!!

Easy to prepare and quick to grill.  Next time I may brush them with butter while they're on the grill to add an extra layer of flavor.

Yum! I used Sriracha hot sauce, which added a nice flavor. I only had time to marinate for about 40 minutes, but they still had great flavor. Thanks! :)

Followed the recipe and these were fabulous. Made a aluminum foil "boat" and put some of the marinade on the bottom and it boiled while on the grill. These were really good.

I can only go by what my husband rated because nobody else eats mushrooms in my house but he loved them.  I only marinated for about 20 minutes and he said the taste was wonderful.  I used Baby Bella mushroom caps.  Thanks

Tasted too strongly of soy sauce and vinegar - next time I would just brush the mushrooms with this mixture - definitely wouldnâ€™t let them soak in it!

Excellent taste, but only used a few shakes of vinegar and soy sauce.  Just kept periodically moving the mushrooms through the marinade.  Used more hot sauce and no extra salt.

This was okay. We were a little discouraged by the outcome because we are such mushroom lovers! The soy sauce we used was a little over-powering. If we try it again, we may switch sauces or only let the mushrooms marinate for 30 minutes rather than and a hour.

I generally don't like mushrooms, but this recipe was pretty good. I think it needs something more though--perhaps stuffing with cheese before grilling. I also added less soy sauce than the recipe called for, about half.

I made these yesterday and my husband and I both loveed them. Following advice from others, I used a little less soy sauce and vinegar than called for and then on my own tripled the hot sauce (I used hot chili paste actually) and after marinating for about 30 minuts I skewered them and barbecued. Delish!

Good. I personally didn't like them, but everyone I cooked them for did. I used the big stuffing-type mushrooms, since I wasn't sure which type (the recipe isn't really specific. Very easy to make.

I added quite a bit more hot pepper sauce marinated for about 15- 20 minutes. Brushed with marinade while cooking. These mushrooms were fanstatic.

After tasting the marinade, I didn't use on the mushrooms.  I did not like the taste of the marinade.  Perhaps I'm being unfair in my rating since I didn't actually MAKE the mushrooms, but I wasn't about in something that didn't taste good...

We liked this recipe quite well but it was a little on the strong side & we usually like everything VERY flavorful.  I think they would be fabulous with a grilled steak to tone it done only a touch!

My husband and I really liked these.  I can see however where many reviewers would find them over powering.  I only let my mushrooms marinade for about 30 minutes and they were perfect.  A lot of flavor, not very spicy and still had texture.  I added some asparagus to the maranade, but didn't find it did anything for them.  We grilled just until the asparagus was tender and enjoyed with grilled pork chops and mashed potatoes.

These are soooo good with steak.  I don't like them by themselves but they are delicious with steak or shrimp!  I served these to company on Easter with steak and shrimp and they were raving about them.

Good stuff!  I left out the black pepper per personal preference, but left everything else the same.  These made a nice accompaniment to grilled NY Strips.  THANKS for the recipe, DEBMCQUEEN!

Delicious and so easy when you are grilling! The mushrooms ended up be very smokey tasting....I put them on the top shelf
 of the grill to keep them from burning, with pork ribs on the fire. Great addition to my dinner! Definitely would do them again...
