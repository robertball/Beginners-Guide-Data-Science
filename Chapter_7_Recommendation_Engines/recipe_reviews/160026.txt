This was.....interesting.

I used frozen yogurt to lighten it up, 
but kept everything else the same. I keep a pitcher of cold coffee in the fridge during summer so it makes it easier when making drinks like this.

It was great to not only use the excess 
frozen bananas I have in the fridge but
it also adds more fiber/fruit in my day.

I'm just not sure I like it.

So I looked at the ingredient list and then went to the kitchen...without writing down the measurements.  What I made was this...just with altered proportions.  I used ~3/4 C ice coffee (instant dissolved in a blend of milk / vanilla soy milk instead of water...this also accounts for the added milk), frozen banana (instead of banana + ice) and about 1/2 C of ice cream.  Looks like I forgot the chocolate syrup.  Oops.  Well it tasted great!  A nice way to have your morning cold coffee but get in some fruit as well!!  It's easily justifiable as healthy b/c of the banana...just ignore the 1/2 C of ice cream! ;-)

I personalized the recipe (seeing smoothies more as a protein shake opportunity).  I used a frozen banana and omitted the ice.  Half cup of unsweetened vanilla almond milk, half cup cold black coffee, 1 scoop vanilla Whey protein powder, 1 tsp. Cocoa powder, 2 packets Stevia (optional, tastes fine either way).  Forget the ice cream and chocolate syrup.  The frozen banana made it thick and creamy, and adds the perfect amount of sweetness!  Seriously, a guilt-free "milk shake" that's GOOD for you.  What could be better?!

I will make again. I used half a scoop of Chocolate protein powder and half a scoop of Vanilla protein powder instead of the ice cream and chocolate sauce. May try vanilla Greek yogurt next time to make it a bit creamier.

I was hoping for more of a coffee flavor, but it was barely discernible. I used 1/2 of a frozen banana and only 1 cup of crushed ice. The drink was watered down tasting to me. I wanted something much stronger tasting.

I used coffee ice cubes (that I make with leftover coffee) and a frozen banana. I only used 1/2 c crushed ice. I liked this. I couldn't taste the coffee much, but it was creamy, icy and good. *Update- I made this again today and used caramel syrup instead of chocolate, and it was good.

Not enough banana or coffee flavor for me.
