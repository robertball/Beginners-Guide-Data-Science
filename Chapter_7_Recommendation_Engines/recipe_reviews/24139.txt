This is really a fantastic recipe. But why make it in a pie pan when you can use a spring form pan and have a really beautiful presentation. I made it ahead and froze it as others have done but when I served it I added a green Chile Hollandaise sauce over the top. It really blew every one away.

This was delicious!  I made it ahead of time & froze.  The night before serving, I removed from freezer & placed in fridge.  In the morning I baked it as directed--wonderful!  This is my family's new favorite for special mornings!

This recipe sounds so time-consuming...but it really isn't.Its a great one for camping! I made ahead, froze, then thawed overnight for baking at the campsite. My guys loved it! Since their tastes lean to more savory, I mixed cheddar and jalopena pepper jack cheeses. Used twice the egg called for and half the potatoes. Also added chopped cooked country sausage links. Yummy! Even the other campers came by to see what smelled so good. Had to sit down and write out recipe five times!!!! This is a definite keeper.

Amazingly delicious!  This is so beautiful... people are always impressed when I make this (I double it & use a 9x13 rectangular pan).  I've made all the layers the night before, assembled them & covered it with plastic til the morning & just added the egg wash.  DEEEEELICIOUS!

I serve this for Christmas brunch. I double the recipe; one pie I make according to the recipe and the other I substitute baby shrimp for the ham. Everyone loves it.

Happy Monday gang! Between cars and computers, I honestly don't know which is the biggest pain. It took me fifteen minutes to get on this site yesterday, as our computer is having major issues. (we just ordered a new one) Once I finally got to this recipe, I read it once and got bumped off again. I decided to wing it anyway. Well, I'm certainly glad I did because this was really delicious! To save on time, I placed my whole potatoes in the microwave and then fried them with the onion in the skillet. I also used breakfast sausage patties, which I cut into small pieces, instead of ham. The kids loved the puffed pastry part of this meal. I'll definitely be making this again Michele!

This recipe is AWESOME!! I made it for Easter brunch and took others advice and did it before hand and froze it. I took it out the day  before and thawed it in the fridge. Despite my initial worries that this recipe looked a bit complicated, it wasn't at all. Every step went as smooth as could be. My guests loved it, this ones a keeper!!

This comes out beutiful when using a Spring Form Pan.  You have to adjust the pastry a little but for the bottom crust but it is OK.  I cubed my ham and make it the day before.  make sure the potatoes are done. Let it return to room tempertature before cooking.  Delicions and a big hit with everyone.  Makes a beautiful presentation.

My parents are vegetarian, so I made the torte without the ham, but the result was still great.  My family enjoyed a "breakfast for dinner" meal last night thanks to this recipe.  It came out of the oven and looked so beautiful too!

An excellent recipe. The fairly long preperation time is well worth the effort. As with many recipes it is a good idea to familiarise oneself with the general procedure before making a start. Cheddar was not available so I used Ementaler instead and added a few capers to give a little extra zest.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that the quantities given were just right to fill the 10" spring form pan which I had decided to use. If you do use a spring form you will, as has been mentioned before, need to use slightly more pastry for the base which can be substracted from the amount required for the top. As many others have done I prepared everything the evening before and simply baked for lunch the next day. No stress, no mess. The resulting pie was truly impressive and tasted every bit as good as it looked !

Delicious! The second time I made it though I used the pillsbury refrigerator dough so I wouldn't have to wait for the puff pastry to thaw. I thought it was better than the first one I made.

This was wonderful, albeit a lot of work in the morning, at least an hour+.  Next time I'll make it the night before and leave it in the fridge, putting the egg wash on just before it goes into the oven. Alternately, at least cook your potatoes & onions, grate the cheese and put the pastry in the fridge from the freezer the night before.  Got rave reviews from my 8 guests.

Fail proof recipe, no matter what changes you make to the recipe.  Served at Easter, everyone really enjoyed it.  I found the original recipe a little bland, but still tasty.  The next time, I'll add spicy sausage and/or some diced green chili to the egg.  I cut the strips of pastry, and laid them across the top in a lattice weave (9x13 pan), put some extra cheese on top in the empty areas.  Worked great.

This was SO good!  I used turkey sausage instead of the bacon.  I didn't do the egg baste on top because I forgot.  I used an 8 inch pie pan and ran out of room so left out one of the layers of potatoes and used it as an additional side.  Otherwise followed exactly and it was awesome!

This was really delicious and I'll definately be making this again.  Easily versatile to add other breakfast favorites, you could do sausage or bacon and add mushroom or sundried tomatos -anything really.  I put in all in a springform pan and it came out beautiful.

Very good as is.  However, next time I'll probably add bacon, sausage and mushrooms.  The sky is the limit as to what you can put in the puff pastry shell.  I'm thinking about a giant bacon cheeseburger for game day or meatloaf with mashed potatoes and a veggie.  Yum!

I made this for my book club and it turned out fabulous.  My guests just loved it.  It sounds much more difficult to make than it really is,  it was actually very easy.  I have also tried this with asparagus instead of the potatoes and that was wonderful as well.

We loved it!  Very tasty and presents very well.  We exchanged ground sausage (drained it really well) for the ham and we doubled the cheese.  We're making it for Easter Brunch we were so happy with this recipe.

This was great, even when I took out the dairy and used vegan cheese and earth balance sticks! I also added broccoli with the potato mixture and it was great (although I used less potatos than the recipe called for. I also cooked the potato mixture in a dutch oven on the stovetop because there was no way my skillet could handle the volume!

I prepared this for my son's birthday breakfast before a day of 4-wheeling. Wish I had read the reviews ahead.  Recipe sounded wonderful and it looked beautiful, but, very bland.  Living in a casino town, I have many weekend guests and love  good brunch ideas.  Maybe some roasted green chiles or Bird's Eye southwestern veggies.

This recipe is outstanding!  Not exactly heart healthy, but like someone else stated, it isn't something that you would eat very often.  My family loved it.  Anything in moderation is ok. I followed the recipe, except I didn't have any fresh parsley.  We had it for dinner, but I think it would be great served any time of the day!  Thanks Michele for sharing this yummy recipe. I will definitely make it again....probably not until the holidays.  It is that 'special' kind of recipe!

I have to say this was a great idea.  I added fresh green peppers, mushrooms, garlic, celery to the potatoes while I fried them up.  When all was cooked, I did what was recommended.  Kids loved it so was a great addition to healthy eathing...Thx..from Canada

This was great even though I had to improvise some of the ingredients. I didnt have ham so i used my hickory smoked bacon (that I always cook on a plate with newspaper to catch the grease in the microwave for ten minutes also I cover it too). I didnt have the puff pastry crust so i used 2 - 7.5 ounce cans of buttermilk refrigerator biscuits in a can. I didnt have parsley so i used just a dash of basil which I love in eggs. I didnt have the right pan so used a deep glass rectangle casserole dish. JEEZ i guess I didnt have much I should have lol! I used hashbrowns and diced onions. I lowered the temp to 300 so I wouldnt overcook the refrigerator biscuits and eye balled the time. Also since I was using a rectangular baking dish I just pulled apart the omelet and puzzled it back together. It was alot of work but that means alot of love to me so I had fun with it. It is beautiful Fun and ooh so tasty Even my picky boyfriend loved it. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this for Easter brunch and added orange and green peppers and sausage- I made it a week ahead of time and froze it- pulled it out of the freezer the night before and baked it in the morning- rave reviews from my entire family!  Wonderful flavor and great presentation on the plates!

I fried the potatoes/onions the night before. Also browned sausage because my new pkg. of ham didn't smell right.  Was good flavor with the sausage, but I will use more spices next time.  Made in springform pan assembling everything in the morning.  I would caution that once the puff pastry is thawed, if it gets too warm it's very hard to unfold.  Presentation was awesome and everybody loved it.

I'm giving this a 5 star because my husband and kids loved this.  I don't like potatoes with eggs so it just wasn't for me.

After reading reviews & 'hearing' that some thought it was rather "bland", I spiced up the omelet with a little garlic & paprika.  Being from the South, fried potatoes are a staple!  Cooked using a little red pepper & cumin, along with the onion.  Came out wonderful!!!  My ketchup-loving hubby started to douse, but after tasting, decided to leave it in the fridge!!  Worth the labor of love!

i made it this afternoon. it took about two hours to make, after waiting for the pastry sheets to thaw. then the additional cooking time. i added pepperoni's to mine, and used 8 eggs instead of 6. it was SO DELICIOUS! loved it.

F-A-N-T-A-S-T-I-C!  As complicated as this recipe seemed, it really isn't hard, but it does take a little time, but you can prepare the potatoes ahead. I used sausage instead of ham...made this for a brunch with some out of town friends...everyone just loved it!

So Good! Used bacon instead of ham. Baked in a springform pan and the presentation was excellent.

This was well receiving at a potluck I attended.  I used pastry shells from the store and next time I hope to have more time to make my own no fail pastry.  Thank you for the recipe.

DELICIOUS!!  I only used one pastry sheet, just roll it really thin and you can use it for both the bottom crust and the top crust.  Makes it thinner, less crust, more room for goodies!  I cooked my potatoes as directed but also added some fresh thyme.  I did half cheddar and half mozzarella, which gave it a creamier, smoother taste and texture.  I used two whole eggs, and the rest just egg whites, to cut down a bit on the fat.  The last change I made was to do half of the pie with ham and the other half with crab.  My husband LOVED the ham half, and I can not stop eating the crab half!!  Wonderful!  Will make again and add mushrooms!

I thought that this was an okay breakfast... The most impressive part of it was the way it looked when it came out of the oven... I thought the flavor was okay, but I'm not really sure if the time it took to prepare was worth it for my family. It was good though!

Very time consuming.  Guests just loved it.  I would
cut back on the amt of butter used.  Baked in
a spring form pan.  The finished product looked
beautiful.

This Breakfast Torte was excellent and picture perfect.  I made it in a 9" springform pan. It is well worth the effort.  I didn't find it to be difficult.  I made it on Friday evening and baked it on Sunday morning for my mother's birthday.  It got rave reviews from everyone.

I made this for dinner & it was delicious & enjoyed by the whole family. Maybe a little time-consuming, but not really. I might buy the refrigerated sliced potatoes (Simply Potatoes) next time - it would make it even easier. Can't wait to make it again, maybe for breakfast next time!

Excellent breakfast/brunch dish.  Easy to assemble and make.  I made a few adjustments:  Instead of onion and potato, I used steamed asparagus that I cooked in the microwave in a dish with a wet paper towel over it.  

Roll the pastry dough out to the size of your dish.  I rolled it out according to the directions and it was awkward trying to fit it over a round dish.  I actually cooked this in a round cake pan and it turned out great!

This torte was so incredible.  Like the other reviewers, I substituted sausage for the ham.  The torte is easy to make and it comes out of the oven gorgeous.  My guests thought I bought it from a bakery.  Try this recipe and I promise, you and guests will not be disappointed.

This is a fun recipe and impressive when complete but I found it to be a little bland. Next time I would change a few things...add more spices to the potato mixture and/or the omelets...basil, oregano, garlic, etc.? Also, I would try something other than ham...bacon would be good or sausage. I also wonder about pastry dough instead of puff pastry. Might be too rich but sounds yummy!

Excellent dish!   I've made it twice.   Takes some time but worth it.   Just like an omelette, you can get more creative with the ingredients added to the eggs if you want more than parsley.

I loved this torte!  My picky husband liked it but he really likes refrigerated pie crust (when i make potpie) so i may try it with that next time.  The flavor was simply amazing!  Great for breakfast the next day too!

I made two. One with sausage, spinach and Italian cheeses, and the other as written with spinach added. The Italian cheese mix was better in my opinion. Also one was made in a regular spring form plan and the other in a large 10 black spring form. The black one cooked more uniformly. In the end I did have to broil the top on low to puff up the pastry and give a nice brown color so as not to overcook the rest. Enjoyed for my Mother's Day brunch but ate too much!

This was really easy to make and was a big hit with the family for Christmas brunch.  The perfect addition to a shared meal.  I turned it into a "Monte Cristo" Omelet Torte using ham, turkey, and Gruyere.

This turned out beautifully! Made it for our Thanksgiving brunch and there was not a mouthful left.  I noticed a few reviewers complaining about the amount of time it took.  It really didn't take any longer than preparing a main dish and with what it has in it it really is a main dish! You could add other things to it or even substitute the ham for bacon or sausage or any other meat.  A very good recipe and I'm happy I found it.

My exhusband actually made this  for our son and me one Christmas morning over 25 years ago.  It was so good I've never forgotten it. Decided to make It on my own & remembered it's in the Land o Lakes cookbook that I got in the settlement. Ha.I looked in  the book & there it was. Truly is a beautiful dish for the holidays!

This was our Christmas brunch centerpiece and it was amazing.  Firstly, make it in a spring form pan. It makes a great presentation.  I used the Cook's Illustrated vodka pie crust recipe, diced ham chunks, leeks instead of onions, and I added garlic to the eggs and to the potatoes. I also  didn't let the eggs cook as much as the recipe called for. I let them cook just to set enough to slide onto a cookie sheet. Really tasty - will be doing this again next year.

Always looking for a new breakfast item. Tried this based on the positive reviews.  Unfortunately, I had to leave out the onions because of picky eaters,  otherwise it was made according to the recipe. This recipe is definitely a keeper, everyone really enjoyed it! Next time I'll make 2 and add the onions and probably mushrooms and peppers! Really wasn't difficult at all, just took a little more time. We'll worth it!

I have made this so many times I can't count. Anyone that has eaten it has loved it. Super filling and always satisfying.  I always use purple onion and Honey ham. Put everything together the night before and pop it in the oven in the morning. Perfect everytime trust me full bellies and smiling faces. It's worth the time.

I used an entire package of thick cut bacon instead of ham.  I assembled it in an 8"x8" glass baking dish.  Perfect.  Very yummy.

I've been making this same recipe for years from an old Land O' Lakes cookbook. It's by far my most popular dish, one everyone looks forward to at my annual Christmas breakfast. I prepare it the day before and pop it in the oven first thing Christmas morning. Fabulous!

We just got done with our meal and I must say it was delicious! Very hearty and filling dish but so worth the time it took to prepare it. This one is a keeper. The recipe is perfect the way it's written. Pleasing to the eye too. Thank you for submitting it.

The taste of the layered ingredients was fabulous and not as time consuming as you would expect, particularly if you use frozen hash browns.  However my puff pastry did not puff up  and and was really doughy.  Not sure why.  The presentation looked professional but we had to peel off the pastry to eat!

Wow, this is fabulous!  I didn't have enough potatoes on hand but it was still awesome even with less.  Great recipe, thanks!

I thought the pastry shell was a bit excessive, so I decided to make this without it. While we both really enjoyed it, I thought it was quite a lot of work for what essentially is a cheese and ham omelet with home fries. I wish this had occurred to me before!
