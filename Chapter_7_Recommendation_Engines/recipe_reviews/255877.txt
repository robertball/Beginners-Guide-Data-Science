Great for breakfast or desert.  I added raisins, cinnamon, allspice and a little almond extract, reminded me of oatmeal cookies.  For desert we ate it warm topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.   For breakfast heated it in the microwave with a tablespoon of almond milk over.  Will add walnuts next time.  Thanks it is wonderful and versatile.

I made it and added some craisins and cinnamon because I always add that to my oatmeal. I also added some chopped pecans to the topping and man oh man was this good! I might cut the sugar down a spoon or two, as it was a tad sweet. 

I used 2 1/4 cups of old fashioned oats and 2 eggs as that was all I had.  l'm going to make it again and use jumbo muffin tins so it will be individually portioned for a quick breakfast. It's like having dessert for breakfast--I don't even have to feel guilty about it!

Love this recipe!  For those of us who don't particularly care for the texture of regular oatmeal, this is like eating a piece of cake!  I added mini chocolate chips (semi sweet) to mine!

I made it and I loved it.  I added shredded Coconut to the blend and it was excellent.  Next time I will also add some Walnuts.  I like this for a snack, and I think it will be great for Breakfast, as I like something fast and furious.

I used whole milk, fresh eggs  and Bob's Red Mill Organic Rolled Oats because that is what I had on hand.  It was a little tricky broiling the brown sugar. Two minutes was not enough and three minutes turned out to be too much.  It still tasted OK. I am going to try to make it one more time being a little more careful
with the broiling time. I did like the flavor of the milk and the eggs in the recipe.

I made this and thought it was awesome. I used the eggs instead of liquid eggs. I also added 1/2 cup cherry craisins. Holds together nice and is easy to serve. I will make again.  Diane

This calls for way too much sugar. I used half the white sugar and only sprinkled on the brown sugar. I also added 1/4 cup of raisins to the mix before baking it.. Served it with blueberries for a healthier version. It was sweet enough. (I am trying to lower my breakfast sugar intake.)

Its a good start, but it needs tweaked.  I put raisins and walnuts and still needs something. Next time I will add cinnamon to add more flavor

Made this with eggs and 2% milk, husband liked it "pretty good". Next time I'll add walnuts. Very easy to throw together.

This is a decent base recipe, though made as written it's very boring and stodgy.  It definitely needs something - *anything* -  added to it. I simply added cinnamon to it the first time; next time I'll also add chopped or sliced apples, as well as subbing out at least half the sugar with brown sugar. And for me it also needed a bit more baking time before putting the brown sugar on the top, unless you like it runny.

I added an extra egg to make it more like bread pudding. I like the eggy taste. Also added pumpkin pie spice and raisins for more flavor. I think it was better reheated after the flavors melded together.

This reminded me of bread pudding (especially the consistency). It was delicious and hearty. I added some cinnamon and needed to melt the sugar longer than they said (more like 3-4 minutes) and also broiled it longer (3 minutes). It was definitely sweet enough and my kids (12 and 9) loved it!

I do use regular eggs (since I don't have egg substitute in the house normally) and  have added a little cinnamon occasionally.  Love having it on hand for a quick hot breakfast or snack.

This recipe reminds me of the baked oatmeal I used to get at a fantastic little bakery (that is now closed). This is a great base recipe that is easy to change up with whatever you have laying around. You can add cinnamon, raisins, shredded coconut, nuts, dried fruit, all sorts of things, and it's always good. Watch carefully during broiling, as it's really easy to overdo it! I recommend splashing some cold milk around each serving, which adds a little more creaminess to the final product.

Oh man its REALLY sweet! This isn't something that I'd eat for breakfast routinely but for an occasional weekender it's spot on. One note: my brown sugar never melted. After ten minutes I ended up skipping that step and placing it under the broiler. I also added cinnamon and nutmeg to my recipe as well as raisins. If I'd have had pecans or walnuts I would have added them too. I think the nuttiness was the missing piece of the puzzle. I'm also thinking next time I'm topping it with a "crisp" topper -like when you make apple crisp - instead of plain brown sugar.

I tweaked this a bit. I added about another cup of oats, because it seemed like it was way too much liquid. I added time to the cooking, though I'm not sure how much. I also cut some apples into it. My girls both wanted more!

This was super easy and turned out well.  I did follow another reviewer's advice, adding raisins and cinnamon but my husband says it didn't taste like an oatmeal cookie.  That's too bad, I was hoping for an easier to appease his oatmeal cookie cravings.  This is still an excellent recipe.

I am not a fan of traditional oatmeal, the consistency of it is too slimy for me so this looked like a good alternative.  Mine did not turn out looking like the featured photo, it wasn't like cake (which is what I think it looks like in that photo), but more wet and spongy.  I added about half a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice and it could have used a couple of teaspoons, not much flavor.  I also added chopped pecans to the top.  That made it much better.  I am not sure if I would make this again.

Just saw the recipe this morning on Facebook and decided I needed to make it now!  I did, as always, read the reviews, so I added cinnamon, raisin, and dates.  It was delicious.  I will definitely make this again and again.

A great way to start the day!  I added a handful of dried cranberries to give it some zing.  Next time I'll increase the cranberries, add cinnamon and nutmeg, and cut the sugar down a bit.  What an awesome way to eat your oatmeal!

I don't LOVE oatmeal, but I loved this recipe! It has a good amount of sweetness to it and a wonderful texture. I love having the ability to easily customize it and it is incredibly easy to make. I even liked it cold, the next day. Also, I imagine most people have these ingredients on hand.
