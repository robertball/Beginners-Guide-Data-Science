It sounds wonderful until the can of soup.  Fresh mushrooms and a little half and half instead worked for me.

This is the first time I've ever written a review, but this was excellent!!!  My husband loved this and said he wished Allrecipes (and computers) were around 32 years ago when we were first married!  Side note:  I did add mushrooms 'cause I had some that needed to be used up.

Delicious with egg noodles. Instead of the soup, I used two cups of heavy cream, and sauteed fresh mushrooms with the garlic. It took about 12 minutes to finish cooking the beef to well-done. I also added the frozen chopped spinach about 2 minutes before taking it off the stove. It definitely needed salt.

decent. It is a bit bland, but if you add salt it's ok. Not a fantastic recipe, but not a bad one. Probably would be better if you add some salt and half the peppers & onions.

Delicious! I made a few changes per other reviewers suggestions and according to my family's tastes. I omitted the red pepper, added mushrooms, salt and ground pepper. Next time, I will half the vinegar. But, all in all, I was impressed. This was nice restaurant quality!

We love to experiment and try new dishes, then keep favorites to make again. This is one I will definitely never repeat. Out of a family of six, we all ageed none of us liked it.

My husband does most of the cooking, but started a new job recently that required me to step up to the plate. He generally doubts my cooking, but after making this, he thought it not only wonderful the 1st time we had it (about 10 days ago), but suggested we make it for guests this weekend. It was delicious & easy.

I also thought this was incredibly bland and I even seasoned the meat before browning. If I can figure out a way to liven up the broth, maybe I'll make again. Otherwise, no...

Addendum, soy sauce turns out to be a good way to spice up this recipe and give it some taste.

This had way too much balsamic vinegar for me (too strong of a flavor). I tried to fix it by adding milk and a bit of soy sauce, but when that didn't help I added some onion soup mix and then I could tolerate it. I wouldn't say it was good. I'm glad I decided to keep the meat separate from the sauce/gravy just in case. Also, I don't know why you would pour out the grease after cooking the meat only to add olive oil back in. Just cook the veggies in the juices of the meat.

I followed the recipe to a tee and my husband thought it was very bland. I couldn't even taste it since I"m pregnant and my cooking has been more bland since pregnant so it may just be that. Sorry :(

This was pretty good.  I used Heart Healthy Cream of Mushroom soup, cut the oil to 3 teaspoons and served the dish over whipped cauliflower (from the South Beach cookbook) instead of mashed potatoes.  I try to like rosemary, but it is just not in the cards.  Next time I'll use thyme or oregano or basil, anything but rosemary.  Otherwise, this was quite good and I'll make it again.

Loved this!  I doubled the amount of garlic and needed to add salt and pepper.  I made it for a dinner party and it was very impressive looking.  A nice hearty meal.  Very easy!!

Sauteed green onions and mushrooms for the  sauce.  I only put in half the vinegar and the taste was still a little too strong for me.  It was okay, not great.  Doubt I would make it again.

This was so good that I think I will enter in the fair for my 4-H cooking project this year.  I suggest using a tenderized meat to prevent it from being to tough and I would season the meat with either Lawry's Seasoning Salt or just salt and pepper.  The fresh basil and balsamic vinegar tastes amazing!

I did as some of the other reviewers suggested and cut down on the vinegar and then added some soy sauce.  It was actually very good.

Loved it! I'm just really starting to get into cooking & this recipe was easy enough, but didn't taste that simple. My husband was thrilled, even the kids enjoyed it. I will have to make more sauce next time, because we definately needed more.

Very tasty. Used Campbell's low salt mushroom soup which has more mushroom flavour than the original and only 2 g fat per serving making it good and healthy.

This was really good! I was nervous with the mixed reviews but I really liked it. I did sprinkle the steak with salt before frying. And I did not have any fresh red peppers so I just used a jarred roasted red pepper. But I would definitely make this again.
