I liked this recipe, but found it a bit bland.  I added 1 finely chopped onion, and 2 T. of oregano, as well as doubling the salt.  I then cooked it in broth...

cheers,

Wayne

Personally, I don't like liver dunplings, but my family loves them.  They all raved about these, but I altered the recipe slightly.  I soaked about 4 small day old white bread dinner rolls in some milk (just enough to cover the rolls), until the rolls absored all the milk.  I added the milk soaked rolls (but not any excess milk) to the liver dumpling mixture.  I also added some more bread crumbs to make the dumpling mixture a little easier to form the balls.  These were a huge hit.  They were devoured.

My husband liked this recipe. I made the mixture, and half I boiled and then fried, and the other half I just made into the little patties and simply shallow fried. The simply fried ones were better. I added cayenne pepper to the recipe. I will make this again, it was so easy.

add 1/2 tsp dried marjoram, 1 onion + 2 tbsp chopped fresh parsely sauteed then added to mixture. Add into liver dumpling mix 1 clove crushed garlic. Perfect in clear beef broth. Wet hands and drop dumplings into boiling soup instead of wet spoons.

After reading the reviews I modified this recipe adding 1 medium diced oinion, extra salt and seasoning.
At the advice of RATKIN412's review I dropped these by spoon in to a well greased pan and fried them like patties.
Our son who absolutely hates liver and will not eat it no matter how I disguise it, had thirds.  It was a hit!
I served it with a side of mustard to dip it in.  The kids loved it!
I will definately make these again!

Make your dumplings very small if you don't want a strong livery flavor. Use very good broth, like homemade veal broth, if you want to impart something tasty to this dish.

Liver was one of my favourites as a child, and this way of cooking it was very enjoyable.  My mum makes great Liver (traditional with bacon and onions), and I've tried to emulate it, but usually end up overcooking it.  NOT a problem with this recipe - easy to make and very enjoyable, you never know maybe my husband will enjoy it!

This is my first foray into cooking/eating liver. I didn't care for these, not did my liver-hating husband. But my picky toddler liked them. Go figure. I'll probably try freezing the rest and saving them all for her.   We used cow liver, added an onion and some herbs, and fried instead of boiled.

I have a very hard time eating liver, and I've been looking for a recipe that makes it manageable, and this recipe did the trick. I added some onion and a few other seasonings, and ate them with some mustard on the side (I fried them instead of boiling) and they were really yummy. Even better, my kids loved them! Thanks for a great recipe.

This is similar to a recipe I got while living in Germany in the 60's.  It called for 8 white rolls soaked in 1 C milk and squeezed out, only 1/2# liver, butter to saute onion, 1 clove garlic, and parsley before mixing it together with 2 eggs.  The differences seem to suggest you can be flexible about quantity of liver, bread and egg.  It also says you can serve with cabbage and an onion sauce.  I was checking here to see what 8 rolls would measure out to be.  2 cups of fresh crumb seems to be about half that, not sure.

This is a very basic and plain version of liver dumplings.  Liver shouldn't be the only flavour you taste in the dumpling.  You should use liver from a calf, and it should be scraped into a paste with the edge of a knife, not ground by a machine.  The consistency just isn't the same from a machine.  The liver should be added to bread crumbs, a big spoon of salted butter, minced onion, marjoram, an egg, and of course salt and pepper to taste. Many people add either far too much liver or not enough.  You need to find the right balance and that is tricky.

Great dumplings!! I only increased salt, and used beef bone broth for maximum flavor. I swear I could eat this liver dumpling soup everyday.

Very bland and far too much liver compared to the bread crumbs, in my opinion.  At least I tried it.

Surprisingly delicious.  I'm not a fan of liver and usually only eat it fried with onions but I found this dish to be a savory alternative.

The dumplings were too strong of a liver taste.  Maybe what ever I did was wrong.  I ground the liver (raw) like the recipe called for and it was so running, I had to add a lot of flour and bread crumbs.  I wonder if you cook the liver first and then chopped up it would make a difference.

I USED CHICKEN LIVERS INSTEAD OF LIVER.  THEY WERE TOOO STRONG IN LIVER FLAVOR.  IF I TRY THEM AGAIN, I WILL USE LIVER.

This recipe is close to the way my mother taught me to make it.  The difference is we add chopped green onions and Maggi flavoring to the broth.  Also, I use chicken liver and cook it and serve it in a chicken broth.
