This recipe DOES work.  It is my husbands favorite cookie now.  It is a little more fudgey than cakey - but totally awesome (besides what can you expect when you omit the flour). 
Three suggestions...
1. Apply very little pressure when pressing down with the fork (really just enough to leave the fork lines). 
2. When making the divet (sp?) for the jam, make it really shallow!  Don't worry, the jam will cling very happily to the "fork lines" you already made. 
3. Before adding the jam do the following (to the jam) - put a couple of large spoonfuls of the jam in a separeate bowl and stir the heck out of it.  You will end up with jam that is sort of syrupy and very easy to dollop onto cookies.

By doing these things my cookies did not break apart, the jam did not drip through and I was able to add quite a liberal amout of jam.

These are the greatest cookies!  I have found that using the back of a 1/8 teaspoon I was able to form a great dimple for the jelly filling.  I have been making them since last christmas and was asked to include them in my boxes this year!
I have also found that Strawberry jelly/jam seeps through the dough making them too soft in the middle. 
Cook on parchment, let cool COMPLETELY on the pan before trying to remove. 
Thank You Uncle Mac & Edie!!!

One big tip: double, double, double the recipe or else you won't have enough to go around or for a decent batch.  These are definitely 8 min. cookies, no longer.  And adding jelly is too hard and tedious, just make these peanut butter cookies or add 1 cup of chocolat or butterscotch chips.  If you do, reduce sugar to 2/3 cup per batch.  I now just make these w/o jelly, add chips and use a fork to make an imprint.  I made them for my kids, (4 & 1 yrs. old) and they loved them, hubby too and disappeared at the bake sale.  And made them for a women's tea.  They're small and perfect for a lady's finger.  Too easy not to try them!

These were a hit at a party I attended, and I was asked many times for the recipe. When I made them, I doubled the recipe, and used Splenda (sugar substitute) in place of half of the sugar, which worked out fine and cut the calories significantly. (You may even be able to substitute Splenda for all the sugar in the recipe; I just haven't tried it yet.) I wanted bite-sized cookies, so I used a small melon baller (1 teaspoon), flattened them very slightly with a fork, and as suggested by another reviewer, used the back of a 1/8 teaspoon measure to make the indent for the jelly. As others have said, do not overbake these; 8 minutes and 30 seconds was perfect for this size of cookie. Hope you will enjoy them, too!

Overall, I found these cookies to be too dense and very oily.  Don't think I'll make them again.  Nobody really ate them.

These cookies are great! With and without peanut butter...they are soft, and very, very chewy. Some things I suggest are: Only use about half a cup of sugar..It's VERY sweet! And do not over cook. They may seem very mushy when it's 10 minutes, but they are done. Let them sit for a while and they'll firm up. Also, they expand, so don't flatten them out too much. Last suggestion is DOUBLE THE RECIPE!! They only made 9 medium sized cookies. Eat with a glass of milk and enjoy! Will definatley  make these again =)

These were very good, but don't press down too hard when making the criss cross pattern. My first batch was too thin and I ended up with flat little peanut butter donuts and the jelly melted through.

We have an Uncle Mac in the family also but he sure can't make cookies as yummy as these. *lol*  These cookies are great! We've made it a few times already because it disappears fast and the kids ask for more. The whole family loves them. We'll be keeping this recipe for sure!

I made these for a bon voyage party for my father who has celiac disease (he can't have any gluten). He is always looking for new things to eat in the sweets department because he doesn't have much of a selection. So I made these for him---they are soooooooo easy! Everyone at the party ate them up--my Dad had to make sure one was saved for him! Even my brothers loved them, and they are very picky. They thought that I should make them without the jelly though. Thanks for the recipe!

The cookies are excellent!!I tried a batch without the jelly first and they tasted great!! With the jelly it tasted good too!They burned a little so next time I think I will put them in for only 8 minutes and I will try to put more vanilla in!!

These cookies are good. They are tasty and very easy to make. I like that you can get creative with different jam flavors as well. Here are the revisions I made on my first try at these and they turned out great. Some came from you guys here (thank you so much) and a couple of my own.

1. Definately cut the sugar in half. I didn't even attempt to make it with what the recipe calls for per someone's suggestion and I'm glad, because while I enjoy "sweet" too much can ruin it. They were the perfect amount of sweetness with half the sugar.
2. I sprayed the fork with cooking spray and as someone else mentioned DON'T flatten these cookies with the fork, whatever you use to make the "filling hole" or otherwise. An 1/8 teaspoon works for the indentation. Press just enough to make a slight dip in the center so the filling won't run over. 
3. DEFINATELY mix the jelly or jam before you drop it on the cookies. Much less mess and easier to control.
4. I doubled the recipe as well per other suggestions and I had a ton of cookies, which was fine because they are smaller, but it seems the original amount would yeild a good amount of cookies.
5. BAKE TIME: You guys are right! 8 minutes is PERFECT.  
6. Finally, I added good pinches of cinnamon and nutmeg. They turned out great! Thank you for sharing the recipe and thank you to all the others who shared their own revisions. What a great team we all make on here :D! Lol.

READ REVIEWS BEFORE BAKING! 
im pregnant and wanted to make something with jam and peanut butter. man did i hit the jackpot! they are very easy to make and most people have these simple ingredients in their kitchen. now because i didnt read many reviews beforehand mine ended up thin, huge, and jelly right thru to the pan. def make the spoon fulls tiny(no bigger than a teaspoon) and do not put a deep dent in center because the jelly will melt thru and ruin the looks of the cookie when you try to remove from pan. might be easiest on parchment paper for baking bc you can just move cookie filled paper to freezer to cool fast so you can back more and then you will def. have pretty cookies. either way. whether they come out as pretty cookies, or you have to scrape them off the pan to a pile... still yummy! and they are very time sensitive! no more than 8 minutes!!! they will become sturdier once cooled.

EASY EASY EASY!!! These were tasty; however, I used black raspberry preserves by Dickinson and it didn't go well.  We all liked the ones without the preserves best. I think I might try a sweeter grape or strawberry preserves next time.  Watch the cooking time. They aren't good at all if you cook too long, 8-10 minutes tops.

yummy! my family and I love these cookies. I learned that you need to leave them on the pan for awhile before moving them to a cooling rack, and they stay hot for longer than some other cookies.

These cookies are so easy to make and they are good also. It's nice to be able to make a sweet treat with just a bowl and spoon, no mixer needed. I used grape, strawberry and peach for the filling. I also rolled into 1-1 1/2 inch balls, slightly flattened on cookie sheet then pressed thumbprint, then filled. Thanks!

This is a very easy recipe, and the cookies are good too!  It's a great way to use up extra peanut butter, and I like how it doesn't contain flour.  The cookies are a little bit on the sweet side, but maybe it's just me.

I thought they were great.  My kids didn't love them ironically.  I used a thick strawberry preserve first and they looked great.  I just pulled out my second batch where I used a runny grape jam and it went everywhere.  A thicker preserve is better.

These taste great hot, they taste even better lukewarm, but we don't know how they taste cold because they don't last long enough to find out!  Fortunately I doubled the batch right off and made a second batch as a pan cookie.  Using super chunk peanut butter made these especially crunchy.

very yummy!! Make sure you have cold milk nearby, and a quick tip-Don't let their initial softness deceive you! If overcook too much they turn to very crunchy cookies. The last batch seemed mushy, but firmed to perfection!!

These were excellent! They really do smell and taste like a pb&j sandwich. Like other reviews said, don't flatten the cookies too much and don't press down too hard with the jelly because the cookies do spread and flatten quite a bit in the oven. I did both strawberry and grape, they were both delicious and I will most definitely be making these again, theyre soo super easy and different than your regular cookie :)

Made this for the kids.  They loved them.  Great texture.  Cooked for 8-mins at 350.  Per a previous review, stirred the jelly before placing on cookies.  Really made this step easier.

I omitted the jelly and used this recipe for plain peanut butter cookies.  So very simple and so very tasty!

I think these cookies are pretty tasty! I like the texture, flavor and how easy they are to make! I made only one alteration...I added a little over a tablespoon of powdered sugar to the mix before baking. YUMMY!

Tasty, but had to remove a star as it was wayyyyyyyy too sweet. Cut sugar in half for sure! I'll probably try these again with that adjustment. I used Morello Cherry Fruit Spread and it was delightful.

Made with half splenda just because. They turned out yummy. Half the dough I added chocolate chips and didn't use the jelly. Both ways were delicious.

Great cookie!  Got rave reviews at the party i brought them to.  Definitely let them sit a few minutes and then let them cool as much as you can before transferring them to any kind of container, i thought mine weren't cooked enough but they just needed to set.

These cookies are great, but I've made a few changes.  I used 1/2 cup white sugar, and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  Put mixture in the fridge for 30 mins to firm up.  Roll dough into small balls and put on cookie sheet. Make indentation in balls like you would thumbprint cookies.  The dough will crack a bit, but you can easily fix them before baking.  I baked them 15-17 minutes and my son-in-law who has Celiac loves them as does my husband.

I just loved these cookies.  They were very easy to make.  The problem that I had was that I had put to much jelly in the cookie and put the jelly to deep.  The first batch fell apart, but after I realized what I did wrong they turned out great.

These cookies were GREAT.  I made them a little thicker, didn't press them down too much, and everything turned out great!  I made a second batch as a pan cookie and just swirled in some jelly.  Those went over VERY well also.  You just have to make sure you don't flatten them too much, you don't overcook them, and you let them cool down enough to get a little harder before you eat them (otherwise they're VERY messy).  :-)

nice!so easy! i made my indents too deep, so , unfortunatly the jam went right through, they looked more like doughnut cookies.  These are really soft when removed from oven, so allow plenty of time to cool on the tray before attempting to lift:)

These cookies are terrific!!  They are SO easy to make, they taste wonderful and they disappear in minutes.  Thank you so much Edie for submitting this recipe.  My family and co-workers keep begging for a remake of this cookie and could eat it every day.  My mother actually went online after tasting these and got the recipe herself and has made it at least 5 or 6 times in the past two weeks ... she loves to sandwich two of them together with some marshmallow fluff in the middle!  Honestly, to mess up this recipe, you REALLY have to be a terrible baker.

Made these for my wheat-intolerant father in law. Tasted like peanut butter candy...so chewy and delicious. Mine spread out too much and the jelly went through to the bottom so looks-wise they weren't pretty, but taste-wise, we scarfed them down in minutes. Next time I wont flatten them so much and they should be fine.

I would give this 6 stars if I could. This just might be the absolute best cookie I have EVER had. I did make a couple small additions. I added about 1/4 cup flour just to make it a little less like straight peanut butter, a tsp baking soda, and used half brown sugar and half white sugar. Other than that everything was the same. I used red rasberry preserves and the whole family can not stop eatting them. I may never get into a bathing suit this summer with these cookies around. The first batch I flattened them a bit too much with the fork criss cross pattern. The second I just barely pressed them down and make sure you do not make the divit for the preserves too deep or it will go right through the cookie. I used a 1/4 Tsp to make the hole. seriously the best cookies I have ever made.

Very yummy. I decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup, the consistency was much better and stayed together better once cooked.

Not as enjoyable with "natural" pb, a little gritty. I tried cooking for 5 minutes, added kisses, then cooked for another 3.

The best were the grape jelly ones.

We did not enjoy these at all.  what do you expect for a cookie with no flour, right? they were so chewy i think we all gave ourselves cavities, as the "cookie" stuck in every crevice of every tooth.  the flavor wasn't enough to save these either...bland bland bland.  not something i would ever make again.  if i wanted a pb and j cookie, i'd make the recipe for the hershey kiss pb cookies, and put jam in the middle instead of the chocolate.  good idea in theory...just not in practice, at least in this recipe.

The dough did not look like dough at all, it was very powdery (I used my Kitchenaid mixer to mix it).  I had to form balls with my hands just to get the dough to stay together.  I added 2 tbsp of flour per another persons suggestion and that seemed to help.  The cooking time was about 15-18 minutes for me. The taste was good though, my kids really liked it but it was such a pain to work with the dough because it was very gritty and powdery.  I used Kirkland peanut butter in case that helps.

The taste is great, but I just made these and can't get them to cook enough to pick them up and eat them.  They just 'melt' or fall apart.  I used Jif creamy peanut butter - maybe that's the problem.  I really want to make these work as they are a great easy cookie to make with my kids.  If anyone has any suggestions, I'd love to hear them so I can try to make these again!  YUMMY!

I was really looking forward to these, but they were gritty from the sugar and just a little too heavy for my taste. Neither of my kids would eat more than a few bites. They looked really pretty though.

These are great! I found putting them on a silpat sheet kept bottoms from burning. I made these last night when my son informed me it was one of his teacher's birthday today. You always have these ingredients on hand. I used half grape and half strawberry jelly and my son and husband both preferred the grape.

I didn't have an issue with the cook time but I know my oven runs a bit hot. 8 minutes made mine perfect. 1 batch gave me 24 cookies. I did use jam instead of preserves and the got a little mushy in the center and spread. Next time I will have preserves on hand. Super simple and tasty!

I shipped these cookies to my son-in-law in Iraq. He and his buddies loved them.  All they said was, "Send more!!". The cookies shipped with no problems. I've used home-made elderberry jelly and home-made apple butter, in addition to various store bought jellys and jams.

These turned out excellent. They are rich and sweet. The cooking time was off though. Istead of 8-11 minutes, I baked them 15-17 minutes.

These cookies were sooooo good. I made them at work and everyone was crazy about them. I tripled the recipe and got about 28 cookies out of it. They are very very soft so I suggest refrigerating the dough for at least 20 minutes or so before cooking. Also, it took a little more time to cook, about 17-20 minutes is perfect. I used blackberry jam and they were delicious. Very easy to make, will definatly make again.

Mine turned out perfect ! The only change I made was to roll the dough in a bit of sugar befor placing it on the cookie sheet and adding the jelly . This helped to harden them up a bit but the inside is still gooey and delicious !

Mmmm! These are just the right amount of sweet. My first batch turned out looking exactly like the picture on here, which I was less than thrilled about. For the next batch, I rolled the dough into 1 inch balls and pressed a little divet into each one with the handle of a spoon. By stirring the jelly very vigorously, as another user suggested, it was very easy to spoon it into the wells. These turned out looking significantly nicer. My boyfriend can't stop raving about them, thanks!

VERY tasty, but extremely soft.  Even when cooled, they fell apart easily.  Next time, I'll increase the baking time.  Maybe that'll harden them up a bit.  The ingredient list is so short & simple!  It's great to be able to make such yummy cookies without butter or even margarine.  Conclusion - gooey, yet delicious!!!

All things considered, a good cookie.  If you have a problem with the jam leaking, simply don't make the whole too deep.

These cookies were great. Really wanted to bake cookies but didn't have ANYthing in the house (no shortening, no baking powder or soda, etc.) This took me like five minutes, one bowl and came out really great.  I think the key to doing this is just putting a very small amount of jelly in the hole and not pushing the hole through too far.  Very moist...yum yum.

This was a huge hit with my peanut butter and jelly addicted husband and kids. Like some of the other reviewers I also had a problem with some of the cookies falling apart even after I had let them cool at bit on the cookie sheets. I actually had to bump up the time to 12 minutes to get mine to cook all the way as well. I tried with and w/o the jelly and both were very good. I even tried honey in place of the jelly and that worked as well but made for a HUGE mess on my cookie sheets. The cookies were good and for the quickness and ease of the receipe I would make them again.

These cookies were better than I expected! I didn't care much for the jelly (I prefer mine cold) but the cookie part was really good! Next time I'll just omit the jelly, or maybe try a Hershey's kiss or chocolate chips in top.

I have a co-worker who cannot eat wheat or flour, so I made these cookies for her (she loved them!).  I left a few at home to try for myself after work, they were gone when I got home and my family wanted more.  They are great and so easy to make.

I used this recipe as a base, so I altered it heavily. I needed to use up some applesauce, only had one egg, and I wanted to use oats. So I used these ingredients and added baking soda, salt, and a bit of flour as a binder. I followed the previous recommendations of less sugar, etc. They turned out perfectly, exactly what I wanted and not too sweet. Very healthy for a dessert item. I’ll definitely use it again and next time I’ll have enough eggs and make the actual recipe, haha.

Simple, great flavor. I think next time I'll use crunchy PB. I used strawberry jam which was perfect. I was surprised by how crumbly it was, wasn't sure it would hold together but it did, with the stickiness of the PB. Denser than a cookie, lighter than fudge, something quite wonderful in between the two.

This was ok, the first batch I made the cookies too large and it didn't turn out with the extra jelly. I made a second batch with much smaller cookies and much less jelly. I liked that these were easy and flourless.

As written these are dreadful. Huge disappointment. Spread out and couldn't remove from the pan. Not good.

These are pretty tasty. Used 3/4 the amount of sugar (1C white, 1.5C coconut palm). I added a bit of oil as I use natural peanut butter and cookies always seem to be dry otherwise. Used my homemade fruit reductions on a few instead of jam and they were tasty. We liked the green apple reduction paired with the peanut butter mix!  Tangy and sweet!  I tripled the recipe, made 40 regular cookies plus 15 we mixed in raisins for and nixed the jam. I think I'd try creaming the peanut butter and sugar first next time, I found the sugar didn't quite incorporate.

Made these with my 3 and a half year old. I cut the sugar in half, as some users suggested, and they tasted perfect. I did make a few without jelly, with jelly, and a few with some caramel (which became really hard but tasty). Even my picky, not liking sweets, man kept eating these. He ate the plain peanut butter ones, tried one jelly one but did not like it. On the other hand, the three year old loved all of them and kept asking for more cookies. To make the cookie dough ball we used a tablespoon tool, and we ended up with a few dozen mini bite sized cookies. They did taste good the next day, but anytime after that they weren't the best. I plan on making these for a family reunion soon! Great recipe.

A friend made these for our ladies golfing night get together and we loved them. She told us where to get the recipe and I'm about to make them myself. I might try mini Reese's cups instead of Jelly but either way they are yummy.

This is a great gluten free recipe, you never miss the flour.  I use brown sugar instead of white and decrease the amount a little otherwise it is too sweet.  I also sometimes add a little corn starch to give them more of a cookie texture.  You can also substitute chocolate for the jelly and they are also amazing.

I made these twice because my husband finished the first batch in 1 days! The flavor is amazing and all in the quality of the PB you buy! After reading other's suggestions I agree that you should not press them down too much or make the jelly hole too deep so the jelly doesn't come through the bottom.  Also, I mixed the jelly the second time, rather than just scooping it our of the jar and it had a better texture... stickier. The only thing I did different was bake for 15 minutes.  The first time I baked for 10 minutes and the cookies were fudgy, but too crumbly.  At 15 minutes they are still soft and hold together much better.  These will be a regular in my house!

This recipe gets 5 stars for being simple and delicious.  I halved the sugar.  Also, I just rolled the dough into ping-pong sized balls and then flattened them slightly and made a thumb print for the jam.  I made them for my kids, but we'll see if there are any left once they get home from school.

I  make these all the time, and they're very good. You can reduce the sugar a bit (3/4 c) if you like. Also, if peanuts are a concern, they're also good made with almond or sun(flower seed) butter. I'm thinking of trying them with Joyva tahini sometime, too. For a chocolate cookie, use chocolate flavored peanut butter or one of those hazelnut spreads might work (just adjust for sweetness).

Also, I find that lining the pan with parchment keeps them from sticking and makes clean-up a breeze! And you can form them into balls (dip your fingers in sugar first), rather than dropping them by the spoonful. The tip to use the back of a measuring spoon to make the indentation is genius! I'll do that  next time.

Very easy to make.
Used the Melon Baller for cookies and 1/8 measuring spoon and worked great.
Only one cookie went flat because I pressed down too far and made the jellow hole to deep.
Very sweet so maybe cut sugar down some.
Excellent with Iced cold milk.
Had to cook for 11 min with my older oven.

This recipe tastes really good. When cooking them, I found I needed to cook them for about 11 minutes. It is also kep to leave them on the cookie sheet to cool significantly before transferring them to a cooling rack. I'll make them again!

I enjoyed the taste of the cookie, but, it took me longer to get them to be fully cooked.  I am unhappy with the cook time, I was hoping that I would only have to cook them for the 8 minutes, but it ended up being close to 20 minutes at the 350 degrees.

I thought it was me, so I made them twice.  They don't work, the dough and jam just melt all over the cookie sheet and don't harden up.

These cookies were really good. Be careful about making the indentation-just a little too deep and the jelly bakes to the cookie sheet. The cookies turned out crisp and VERY sweet. If you like a crisp, chewy cookie, then these are for you.

These really were good!  Entire family enjoyed them.  Only change I plan to make next time will be to have jelly over most of the cookie top - to ensure jelly in each bite...that's what makes them perfect!

These are so much tastier than basic peanut butter cookies!  I've used regular strawberry jam, and it's delicious.  Be careful not to press the fork down too far, or your cookie will have a hole in it and the jam/preserves will drip out through the  bottom.

These were nothing but baked peanut butter globs. They were as mushy coming out as they were going into the oven. I even baked for longer than the recommended time. They stuck to the pan and no one in my house ate them.

I thought these were absolutely delicious.  My husband wasn't too keen on the jelly but thought the cookie itself was the best peanut butter cookie he's had.  Me and the kids thought they were scrumptious!  Thanks!

Awesome peanut butter cookie recipe, very easy to make.  The jelly's tricky...only about half of my cookies looked good.  The jelly leaks through like crazy.  But they all tasted killer!

Super easy and fast.  Very brittle but that may be because I used chunky peanut butter.  Next time I'll use more than the recipie calls for.

Quite delicious and ingenious. One shortcoming is the cookie's crumbliness. Hold it the wrong way and it breaks! :)

These were quick and easy to make, but they took a long time to set. Definitely a favorite with my kids now.

These cookies were good and my kids loved them. I think I like peanut butter cookies with flour in them better though. It tasted like there was too much peanut butter in them too me. I like peanut butter but not THAT much.
