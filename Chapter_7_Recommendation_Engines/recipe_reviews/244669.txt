It's always fun to try new ways to eat hot dogs. We grilled the hot dogs and used farm fresh produce for the toppings. It was good, but a bit salty for my liking. I put a squirt of Heinz ketchup on my second dog and enjoyed it more than the non-ketchuped version.  Corey is the hot dog aficionado in our house, so here is his take on this recipe: "It was good, but I wouldn't rush to try it again." Meaning, it goes against his version of the traditional hot dog.

This was really delicious I used turkey peppered bacon and chicken hot dogs. I tried the topping as is and also tried it by adding a dash or yellow mustard and another with a dash of buffalo sauce added. All three ways were really good

Toasted the buns, melted provolone cheese on top and oven baked bacon chopped up and then put in oven for another 5 minutes to get desired crunch. This dog as a BLT was just another Fantastic Idea ...... Thanks a bunch!

It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great either.  Might be better without the pickles.

Delicious, made it according to the instructions.  Will be a definite favorite.  Goes good with french fries.
