I made a slight modification due to the fact I was unable to locate cinnamon chips this time of the year, but hands down this was the best no bake cookie recipe I have ever tried. I used Guittard Milk Chocolate Chips and ground cinnamon in place of the cinnamon chips. I highly recommend trying is recipe out, you won't be disappointed.

The girls who will be eating these will LOVE these!  The cookies are easy to make and taste yummy.  I followed some ideas given by Marie C. on the Buzz and used the recipe as a liner for bird nests for Easter.  I used a small cookie scoop with the dough leveled off and then free-formed a nest with them.  After they cooled, I used a recipe for the nests found here on AR and put some of that in a muffin tin, placing the nest inside that.  Using a knife I pushed up the chow mein noodles to hold around the nest.  They came out from the muffin tin easily after refrigeration with a nudge from a table knife.  These will be place cards for Easter dinner.  Thanks, sueb for the yummy recipe!

These are super easy and fast to make and taste great too.  I made half a batch and used these as liners for chow mein marshmallow birds nests.  Using a lightly greased mini muffin tin and the blunt end of a citrus zester I pressed a small amount of dough into the tins to form a cup.  I got 36 liners from the half batch.  After they were cooled I gently loosened with a knife and inverted on a sheet of parchment.  Making half batch of the following recipe at a time I formed nests around the no-bake liners.  I got five chow mein nests out of half a batch.  These turned out really cute and the taste of the two recipes combined are perfect.  They look like eagles nests!  http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Jelly-Bean-Nests/

Just finished making these cookies, they were half gone before they had cooled.  A little sweet for my taste, but everyone else truly enjoyed these.  I did not make changes to the recipe, but had to omit the chips.  Over all, this is a recipe I will make a standard in my file.

It is a rich and tasty dessert, but not too sugary.  If you are not able to get cinnamon parsles, then just pour in regular cinnamon.

This recipe didn't work out the way I hoped or even look like the photo, unfortunately. I did tweak based on what I had on hand, so probably what went wrong. I halved the recipe, so used 1 c. sugar, 1/4 c. 1% milk, 2 oz. butter to start. Added in 5 oz. Nestle chocolate chips (didn't have cinnamon) and 1/4 c. Barefoot & Chocolate Almond Coconut spread and then folded in Quick Oats. Before I even out in the oats, the chocolate mixture got somewhat grainy (yes, it was off the heat). The oats just made it all crumbly. Taste is there, so I rolled in to balls and might cover with chocolate (candy she'll) to keep it together.
