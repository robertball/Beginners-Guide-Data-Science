This is wonderful, especially with Meyer lemons. Be careful with the sugar though. I started with less sugar and didn't need to add the rest.  A tip to those who think this is bitter- the peel is not bitter, the white membrane inside it is.  Use a sharp knife to peel the lemons and take only the colored part, not the white, and no bitterness.

The best lemonade I've ever tasted- you can make this recipe simpler by juicing the lemons first, then adding sugar to the rinds.

Nice taste, but one tip...  resist the urge to press the peel or stir it around in the sugar.  Just put it in, mix it lightly and let it alone!  Otherwise the end result will be bitter.  Trust me.

Loved this Lemonade, I would call it extremely intense. I probably would not fix another lemonade recipe after trying this one. I did just zest the lemons instead of peeling, turned out great.

I kept the recipe as is, then after it was all done I taste tested with more lemons and water ready to go.  Turned out great!  Ended up using 2 more lemons and a cup more water, but it was to our taste.  Advice on not stirring the sugar and peel mixture worked great.  Just pour the sugar and leave it alone.

We have a lemon tree in our backyard and since I discovered this recipe last summer, I've made so many batches of lemonade I don't even follow a recipe anymore! This is the best lemonade recipe!

Typically, I take 4-5 lemons, peel the rind off a couple of them (I use a potato peeler), place them in a bowl and pour a cup or so of sugar over them. Then I squeeze the lemons and boil however much water looks like is needed to fill my pitcher. When the water has boiled, I put the sugar/rind mixture in a fine strainer, pour the water over it, and then pour the lemon juice into the strainer as well. What I like about this way is that from there, I can season to taste. I can either add more sugar (and because the mixture is still warm, it will dissolve) or more lemon juice, or more warm water from the tap. Once it tastes perfect, I leave it on the counter to cool some and then put it in the fridge to chill.

This was the best lemonade ever!!  I make it all the time now!  I made it and mixed it with vodka for New Years and it was fabulous!!  The lemon oil from the skins really overpowers even the cheap party vodka I used and made for a really nice tasty drink for my guests.  Everyone wanted the recipe.

This truly is spectacular lemonade.  A bit sweet so Im adding water or lots of ice as I drink.  Great tip from another reviewer - do NOT play around, stir, or mix rinds, just let sugar and then water sit and then remove carefully to prevent bitterness.

DELICIOUS!!  This is the second time I've made this in the last week.  My family LOVED it so much I couldn't get a photo before it was all gone!  This does take a little time but has so much lemon flavor.  I used a potato peeler and cut the "1 slices of the outer lemon.  I added double the water because it was too tart for our family following the recipe exactly!  Next time, I will only use 1/2 the sugar with the lemon pieces, and try adding agave nectar to sweeten to our family preference.  I think it would be fun to try this recipe using oranges!

This lemonade was fantastic! I used a very sharp paring knife to trim the zest off the lemons, rather than using the whole peel, to avoid the bitterness some reviewers have mentioned. The lemon oil gives a very, very nice dimension to the flavor beyond your standard lemon-juice-water-sugar mix. I'll make a double batch next time to be sure it lasts more than a day.

This was the most disgusting recipe I have ever tried.  The lemonade definately tasted vintage, like it had been in my refrigerator for years.  I will keep my usual recipe for lemonade and advise anyone tempted to try this recipe to look elsewhere and don't waste your time or money on this one.

This is so good I won't even bother trying any other recipes. I knew it would be wonderful after seeing the rind was used for the oil (I always score the rind of the lemon that goes in my tea for the extra flavor). 


To avoid any bitterness just use a vegetable peeler to peel the rind so you don't get any of the pith. I couldn't resist trying some of the sugar as it soaked and it was luscious! Would probably taste great in tea. Also the water has a lovely yellow color after steeping.


I followed the recipe exactly for the sugar and water but used 6 large lemons (1 3/4 cups of juice) and it was the perfect balance of sweet and tart. I love the store bought Simply Lemonade but honestly, this is better!

Using the lemon peel really made a difference with the colour of the lemonade. It was a beautiful pale yellow. The taste however was too lemony. I'm looking for something with more of a balance. Will keep trying!

Excellent lemonade.  I used a potato peeler to remove just the rind - no bitterness at all.  I added a little extra water to make it less sweet.  Also suggest using organic lemons so there are no pesticides released into the sugar or hot water.

I just cut the lemons in half, juiced them and threw the whole juiced half (pith, pulp and all) into my roasting pan.
Poured HALF the amount of sugar (because I was adding strawberry puree) over them, let them sit for 40 minutes, I even stirred them up a bit at the start before I read not to.
Then I read the other reviews about the pith and bitter flavour, so after 40 minutes of the sugar on the lemon halves I poured over the boiling water and tasted it every 5 minutes or so to see if there was a hint of bitterness and after 20 minutes there was none.

We used 30 lemons and made this (x 6) for a weekend at the cottage with strawberry puree and added vodka for the adults - delicious!

Best lemonade that can be made in a regular kitchen.  It has that "bite" to it that really makes it thirst-quenching for some reason.  The chemistry explains it; the oils get carried by the sugar into solution with the juice & water.  Every time I serve this to guests, I get compliments and they always want the recipe!  Sometimes if lemons are out of season or expensive, I mix this with some frozen to make it go farther.  Be careful not to let the sugar/rind mixture sit for more than an hour or you'll end up with bitter lemonade.

very yummy.  A little sweet for my taste, but I think I can just add more water.  The taste of the rinds really adds nice flavor.

I halved this lemonade recipe the other day to test it out... it was the best lemonade I've ever tasted so I'm making some more!!! Time consuming yes, but it is worth it!! The only thing I changed was a little less sugar because I like it a bit tart and I zested (long strands) the lemons to get the rind.

This lemonade is fantastic - some of the best I've ever had.  I peeled the lemon rind using a vegetable peeler to avoid getting the pith, then mixed with the sugar.  I also boiled only half the water to mix with the sugar and peels, and added ice to the pitcher, so I didn't have to wait for anything to cool.  Thank you!

This was very sweet and syrupy!  I kept squeezing lemons to get a little bit of that tart flavor most of us love about lemonade.  Keep everything the same, except add the juice of at least 4 more lemons to the final stage.  Enjoy!

LOVELY recipe- only 4 stars because it really should include instructions to NOT stir the rinds & sugar. It also should advise to minimize the amount of white pith (white inner skin) that you peel off- this is what makes it bitter.  Otherwise, this is a sweeeet lemonade-- easily remedied with adding more water if you want a lighter sweetness!  I WILL MAKE THIS AGAIN!!!!  YUM!!

For all the people who said this is bitter you do not want the white part of the rind. A microplane works great to get just the yellow zest and that is where all the flavor is. It allows all the oils to release into the suger and the into the simple syurp you are making.

SOOOO GOOD! There are three people in my home (including me), and I had to make two DOUBLE batches in two days because it was so popular! Two extra things that I did that seemed to make it even yummier was instead of just laying the rinds in the sugar, I mashed them into the sugar with a mallet for a minute or two. That REALLY got the sugar into the rinds to pick up the oils. Also, instead of squeezing the juice out of the lemons I simply tossed the slices into a blender...then strained it. That way, none of the seeds got through, but you got the maximum amount of juice!

I love this recipe...YUM.

I preferred to dilute the finished product a bit more.
Very enjoyable with lots of ice!!

your lemonade was great but try mine too:
1 lime
2 lemons
20 tsp of sugar
1 cup of water

Squeeze the lime and lemons, mix in the sugar and 
water. Add ice and your drink is ready. it is delicious!

This was fantastic! One other reviewer said to use a veggie peeler on the rinds and this work beautifully. I will make this again with out a doubt. Now I want to experiment and add strawberries or other fruit to it too. BTW I also used the Splenda granulated sugar substitute (not the packets) and it turned out great and lower calorie.

This takes a little bit of work and some time to make, but well worth the effort. Just the experience of making old fashioned lemonade was fun.  I thought it had a slight bitter taste, but my husband countered that by saying it tastes "real." I would have to agree that it has a very pure, clean taste.

I just made this lemonade today and I couldn't wait to rave about it. Let me just say- DELICIOUS! My whole family loved it. The only thing I did differently was poured the sugar/lemon peel mixture in the hot water. I only did this because my bowl wasn't big enough to hold it all. Other than that everything was according to the recipe. I plan to try this again with the juice of an orange. Once again- DELICIOUS!

i love this recipe! i've made this a couple of times already, and i totally agree with the mods - scrape off the piths, less sugar (~1 cup total) and more water (~1cup more).  i also like to throw in some thinly sliced ginger peels (fresh) into the sugar to add a different taste!  this recipe takes more time, but it is worth it! :)

Lovely lemonade.  The lemon oil adds extra depth and gives this lemonade a handsome yellow shade without any food coloring.  My family went crazy for this when I made it.  I absolutely love this recipe.    Thanks to reviewers for the tip on not messing with the zest and sugar, they are so RIGHT!  Totally recommend this recipe to friends whenever I get the chance!  Thanks so much for sharing!!

When I made this, I was looking forward to the lemon oil/lemon rind giving it a nice kick, but the taste was just overpowering. I used the corrrect amount of sugar but it also seemed a bit overly sweet as well.

This lemaonade is amazing as is. and to make it greater i used 4 lemons and 1 grapefruit, (peel and juice), it makes a great pink lemonade. I have done it with 3 lemons and 2 limes, quite sour but good.  and today i used 4 lemones and 2 clementine oranges. yum!   AND the rinds that are left over after taken out are good if sprinkled with sugar and let dry a bit, great candied peel!

This is the way lemonade is supposed to taste.  Wow, wow, wow.  Next time, I would stir the peels, sugar, and hot water, as the sugar didn't all melt on its own just from steeping and it wants to stick to the peels.  Used a veggie peeler (the kind that looks like a disposable razor) to easily get just the yellow part of the peel.

This was WONDERFUL!  I will make again and again.  Next time I will try harder to not get any of the white under the peel to avoid a bitter after-taste, as others suggested.

Fabulous lemonade. I definitely juiced the lemons first and set the juice aside. Then I just cut up the rinds to add the sugar to. It was a lot less work for the same result. Great for summer parties with kids. Serve with a shot of vodka for the adults and a sprig of mint. Yum!

Delightful, fun to make with the little ones.  Did as another reviewer suggested and juiced the lemons and put the cut halves in a bowl with the sugar to cut down the labor.

A warning to those like myself who use "Sugar in the Raw" instead of white sugar: it will make this lemonade turn brown!  But it still has a really nice flavor in spite of the weird iced tea color, so five stars for the recipe itself!  I would definitely make this again-- with regular white sugar.

This lemonade is delicious!  I peeled the leom with a vegie peeler, and then followed directions exactly.  It was kind of strong, which we liked, since it's perfect after it's in a glass of ice for a few minutes.  I had to make 3 batches this weekend, and everyone raved.

Okay, okay how bout we name this pucker up lemonade cause that is exactly what you do when you drink it. This stuff is incredible, only problem I see with it is I need a lemon tree to make enough so that it will last.  
After reading the reviews I elected to juice the lemons first, sugar them, let em sit outside for 60 mins, poured the boiling water waited 20 mins, and BAM I had pucker up lemonade.

This was awesome.  I doubled the recipe and used 12 small lemons (which yielded 1-1/2 cups of lemon juice).  I also zested my lemons with a microplane grater and mixed the zest in with the sugar instead of using the whole peels.  I strained it using a fine mesh strainer lined with coffee filters to make sure I kept all the zest out of the lemonade.  This got rave reviews from everyone.  Tart and sweet, yum!

Wow!  This is super awesome!  I did do things slightly different out of fear for too much lemon flavor.  
First I used a vegetable peeler to get the rind without the bitter white part.  I only let the sugar sit with the rinds for about 20 minutes.  Then,after pouring the boiling water over the sugar and rinds, I squeezed the lemons into the hot water.  Once I was done squeezing, I didn't wait any longer and strained out the rinds and pulp.  End result is smooth, sweet, lemony goodness!  Don't be afraid to try this!

Can I leave SIX stars? This is delicious as written! The only down-side is cutting the rind off, but it is well-worth doing!The only modification I made (to expeditite drinking it!) was to cut the water amount in-half, heat that portion and pour over the sugar/lemon rind. Then after draining the mixture, I allowed it to cool for a bit but then added some ice cubes to cool it faster. Then I added the remaining water, using ice cold water and added the lemon juice last. This way I wouldn't "cook" the fresh juice. Wonderful-thank you :)

Awesome lemonade! I juice the lemons first too. I also do six lemons with 1 extra cup of water - keeping the sugar the same or a little less. Making more than one batch at a time is smart or you will have to repeat the whole process again as soon as you finish off that one pitcher! SO GOOD!

Such fun! I enjoyed the process of making this as much as the end result. I did add a quarter cup of fresh blue berries and it came out a really nice color. Later tonight I will be adding grey goose ;-)

Splendid! I'm a lemon lover so this was like a god-sent gift to me! I made 5 servings of this, so used 6 lemons, 6 cups water and cut back the sugar to 3/4 cup to suit my taste (and calorie intake ;) ) I peeled the rinds very carefully ensuring not to get any of the white membrane in the peel. The one thing I did different was, that I left the sugar-sprinkled-rinds overnight in a covered bowl on my countertop and continued with the rest of the preparation the following day. No bitterness at all - 1 reviewers suggestion of not disturbing the rinds whilst they're soaking in sugar was a very valuable tip. :) Chilled lemonade with ice has always been my favourite and this recipe has ensured that I remain addicted to it for years to come! =D P.S. My family loves this too! =) Thanks Aunt Suzie!

Well, my daughter finally likes lemonade now, thanks to this vintage recipe.  To me, the recipe as written seems almost more like a concentrate.  I added water to my dispenser (1 gallon?) until it was 3/4 full, and I probably could have added even more water.  But, it is such a lovely flavor -- neither too sweet nor too sour.  Peeling the lemons was a bear, so I'm thinking next time I'll squeeze out the juice while in rind, and then cut up the peels and soak them in sugar.  Yummy, yummy -- this will be great for the lemonade stand.  Thanks, Aunt Suzie!

My daughters and I love this recipe! How can you go wrong with a classic?....You can't! Here are the changes I made: I used 9 lemons, 1 1/2 cups of sugar, and 1 1/2 quarts of water. I juiced the lemons first and then just added the juiced rinds to a bowl. Other than that...followed exactly. This is my only Lemonade recipe that I will use from now on!

I love this recipe as is, but thought I could combine it with the Hot Pink Lemonade recipe to get the best of both worlds. While the water boiled I pureed a pint of blueberries. I added them into the rinds, stirred them a bit, then added the water and left to steep. I removed the rinds, added the lemon juice and voila! Hot Pink Vintage Lemonade! I did not increase anything, just added the blueberries. It tastes and looks great.

This is how I make lemonade when I have the time. The zest makes it really special. For an extra kick, try adding a few white pepper corns when you heat the water. it adds a demension to the zest that is really, Really special.

This is by far, the best lemonade I have ever tasted! Followed recipe exactly. Avoided stirring the rinds/water/sugar mixture. Just let it steep for the 20 minutes, strained into the pitcher and ... DEEELICIOUS! :) 5 stars

It takes a lot longer to make than regular lemonade but we thought it was great! I used the potato peeler and peeled only the yellow skin off the lemon. I can't wait to make more!

I didn't like the flavor from the rind. I think it would be better to use the zest rather than the entire rind. But, I suppose this is how they used to do it back in the day!

I tried it before it was cooled all the way and I'm really pleased with the flavor. It's intense and far superior to anything I've had at a restaurant!  I refuse to make anything from "concentrate" so I thought I'd try and make my favorite drink the old fashioned way. Perfect and just the right kind of flavor!  Thanks for the recipe!

I came across this recipe and thought it was totally unique, I had lemons I needed to use and glad I made this recipe. I instantly doubled the batch for my thirsty broad. Peeling the 1st patch I quickly wondered if using a zester what easier and would eliminate a step by slicing the peel in the 2nd step. I tried it and it was just as much work as doing it the way it was written. But either way, the zester works just as good. Little hard on the wrist. But all in all I followed the recipe to the T and it was quite refreshing and light, the how smelled nicely of lemons for a bit. And my kids drank it all up. It was worth just trying because of the different way this was made. I did strain out the lemon peel and the pulp because of the kiddos. Thank you for sharing such a nice recipe. I will be trying this again with a sugar free way with Splenda for my benefit.

This was delicious.  I more than doubled the recipe for a picnic and it turned out great.  The only tedious thing was peeling the lemons to get the rinds off.  While they were marinating in the sugar, I ran the lemons through my juicer.  Quick and easy.

Absolutely delicious! I ended up using the same proportions and it was perfect combination of tart and sweet, and it was strong but I didn't feel the need to water it down any more.     I only take off a star because it is a bit of a hassle. To avoid the bitter white part, I just zested the lemons because cutting only the yellow part of the peel was too difficult. I'd say zest the lemons, then squeeze them. Then strain in a fine sieve to get all the peel out.

This was great, followed instructions exactly.  Allow plenty of time to cool in fridge.  Adding ice to do it will dilute the taste to much.

Used the lemon zester on the lemons; mixed with the sugar and stirred.  Juiced the lemons and put in the refrigerator to get all the juice while waiting for the sugar/zest mixture.  Added the boiling water and, when cooled the required time, added the juice and drained over a mini colander to keep the zest out of the finished product.  Excellent flavor.

Thank you for this recipe!!  It is the best lemonade I have ever had.  It takes very little time to prepare,  you just have to wait for the lemon rinds and sugar to do their work. It is a mellow lemonade.  Maybe a little sweet but you can adjust that. Thanks again :)

I didn't think you could deepen the flavor of a recipe that pretty much had one main ingredient, but it's amazing what a little lemon oil will do! Loved the intensity it brought. My rinds were fairly thin so I just put them cut-side down into a 9x9 Pyrex, layered the sugar on top, then poured the hot water over it when it was time. Because the lemons floated, I flipped them over to not get any of the bitter pith to seep into the mixture and as it sat, the aroma was amazing! Be aware of the size of your lemons too, as well as their tartness. My lemons were small/medium-sized and a not as tart, so I could have added a bit more lemon juice to balance the sugar, or else cut back the sugar a little, but when poured over ice it helped balance the flavors too, and was a wonderfully refreshing drink!

The best lemonade I've ever tasted, hands down.  But seriously--DO NOT STIR THE RINDS WITH THE SUGAR.  The first time I made it I let it sit and it was perfect. The second time I foolishly gave the rinds and sugar just a tiny little toss toward the end and the lemonade ended up a little bitter. I do use 1/2 to 3/4 cup less sugar but that's my own preference. This recipe will be used a lot in my house.

Heaven in a glass. I found this recipe about 2 weeks ago and I have made it every 2 or 3 days since then. People love it and so do I. Follow the directions exactly as written and you will not be disappointed. We are certainly hooked. Perfect for this hot South Carolina weather. Aunt Suzie this is a winner and thank you so much for sharing.

Very nice lemonade.  This is the first time I've made lemonade from scratch, so I took the time to read the reviews.  I used less sugar (3/4 cup total) and zested the lemons instead of cutting up the rinds, and I'm glad I did.  This lemonade turned out very lemony, with a tart taste that gets better as you sip.  I followed the advice to not mix the sugar with the lemon; really, not sure what that did, but it worked out perfectly fine.  My only problem was juicing the lemons; if I start making more lemonade I'm getting something to juice them with; a little hard by hand!  Thanks for the recipe!

I tried this recipe yesterday, me and my boyfriend loved it. I used more water than the recipe called for though. I think it is the best I have ever had though, nice lemon flavor but not too sweet. I will be using this recipe from now on.

This was absolutely the best lemonade ever.  For those who complained of bitterness, you probably used the entire peel. It might be better to say to use the zest, the white is very bitter.  I even substituted half the sugar for Splenda (added after it was all mixed together, I only used sugar with the zest).  Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe. Tested and true through the years.

I was given several lemons and needed to figure out what to do.  It is the beginning of summer and I came across this lemonade recipe.  A bit tedious but worth every step.  Gotta go get me some more lemons!

Like other reviewers have said, DO NOT stir the rinds, sugar and water.  Just let it sit.  I would also recommend straining everything.  I strained the juice through a fine mesh strainer and after removing the rinds, I strained the sugar water mixture through a fine mesh strainer.  My kids LOVE this and ask for it all summer long!  Great with vodka too for the adults!

This is an excellent recipe and easy to make!  I would cut back the sugar a bit as we like tart lemonade.  Make sure you only peel the skin and not the white membrane or it will be bitter...just zest the skin off, it's much easier!

Delicious.  Just what you want in a lemonade.  I followed others suggestions and zested the lemons.  After the lemon zest and sugar sat,  I piled it on cheesecloth and made a "ball" so that I could drop it in the pitcher, pour water on top and just let it sit for the 20 minutes and then fish it out.  Seems to have worked well.  Tried when tepid and tastes sweet and tart.   We did not add any extra lemon juice - as after you just start to think "way too sweet" you really get a punch of tartness so it got left as is.  Seeing as I had the extra lemons on hand in case it wasn't tart enough, I zested the other 6 from the bag and made a lemon simple syrup with the zest, thinking that maybe we could modify this recipe for making 'glass by glass' and easier to keep on hand.  Can't wait to drink more tomorrow, after it has chilled and is served over ice.

Wonderful lemonade!  Incorporating the flavor from the peels is such a great idea.  Instead of peeling the rinds and cutting them into slices, I used a microplane to take just the zest off and mixed that into the sugar.  After the sugar is dissolved in the hot water I strain the zest out with a fine mesh strainer.  I would recommend not tweeking out and trying to get every last bit of the zest off the peel and to take care to get as little of the white part as possible.  The first time I made this I tried to get ALL the zest off and I think it caused me to go over the same area more than once and even that little bit of white part added some bitterness to the end result.  I also added a little extra water because the flavor was kind of strong for my taste but that could just be me.  Great lemon flavor does lie in the zest and now I can't imagine why I never thought of using it before.

It was very good; however there was a slight bitterness along with the sweet lemony taste.  I'm not sure if that's from the lemons I used, or what...or maybe that's just how it's suppose to taste?  

It was fun to watch the sugar turn to goop in the lemon rinds. :)

In my opinion, it was much too lengthy of a process for something that tasted just"ok" I think next time I will add more lemon and/or water and less sugar, it was kind of on the sweet side and I like more of the lemon flavor to come out in my lemonade.

Excellent recipe.  My only change was that I grated the rind off (rind only, not the pith-the white part of peel) and put the sugar in with that.  I followed the rest of the recipe exactly and it was wonderful.  Thanks for sharing this recipe with us.

This is a great recipe and I will be making it again. I'm going to cut back a bit on the sugar, I like lemonade with a bit more whang!  Using the lemon peel really adds a richer lemon flavor.  Can't wait to hand a glass to my husband when he gets home! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe and thanks to those who forwarned me NOT to mess the sugar and peels. I was tempted........  :)

Seems like this has potential but it turned out too bitter for my liking, I used the whole lemon as the recipe calls for and not just the zest. Will try this again with just the lemon zest and see how that turns out.

So good.  I couldn't resist the urge to stir the lemon rinds in the hot water and it turned out fine.  I used lemons that a woman from work brought me from her tree.  I think I will use about a quarter to a half a cup less sugar next time.

I have made this twice and the first time I put the original amount of sugar, which I found too sweet. I reduced the sugar to one cup the second time around and it had the right sweetness for me. I also squeezed the lemons the first time around and didn't care for that at all. The second time around I juiced the lemons first and then I added the sugar to the halved peels. The "modern" method doesn't compromise the flavour at all. Will definitely keep making this again and again. Thanks for sharing, Aunt Suzie!

Great homemade lemonade recipe!  Leaves a very refreshing, cool taste in your mouth.  My family loved the now discontinued Kool-Aid flavor "Lemon Ice" which left your mouth feeling cold - this recipe comes very close to that but in a much better way!  Thanks for the recipe!

OMGosh! This lemonade is AWESOME!   A teeny bit time consuming...but so worth it.  I used a veggie peeler to remove the skin.  My only change would be less sugar.  Next time I will use only 1 cup.  To those who did not like this recipe, maybe it didn't taste like the powdered or frozen mixes you are used to.  Try this one again...instant winner!!!!

This is similar to the recipe we use.  We don't do the boiling water etc.  We use a gallon jar w/a screw lid, squeeze 6 lemons, add a cup of sugar, fill the jug w/ice to the top, and shake for about 20-30 minutes, or let it sit for an hour give or take.  Then we fill the jug w/water and remove the rinds.  Sometimes we add a wedge of lemon to the glass or just drink it as is.

Great way to use up a huge bag of lemons from Costco.  The kids loved this lemonade over ice. For the festive adults at our party, we added a bit of lemon flavored vodka and it was a huge hit as well.

Scrumptious!  Just like down south.  For the reviewers who said it was bitter, try not getting any of the white part of the peel.  Only the outside yellow.  The sugar pulls the oils and flavor right out of the rind.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I have made this exactly as it is instruced many times, and loved it. Eventually I played around with the number of lemons (4), and amount of sugar (scant 1 cup) to get it to my personal taste. I have found that when lemons are not on sale, I will switch out a few lemons for a few limes and it is just as wonderful.

Tasty! After reading through the reviews, I didn't cut out very much of the pith - only where it was especially thick on one lemon. I reduced the sugar to 1C and added a teaspoon of dried lavender. I accidentally added too much water, filling the bowl to almost 2Qts with the lemon, lavender and sugar... and yet, this was fabulous! Can't wait to make it again.

I made this today just as written and I did not care for the flavor.  I was very careful and didn't take any of the white of the rind and I used Meyer lemons.  Will not make again.

So Good! Followed directions exactly.  I filled the jug I was going to use, and just boiled that much water. A lemon flavor, that's strong enough to swallow without going all "squinty eyed" and enough sugar to make it taste very smooth.  Will definitely add it to the list.  Have to admit, I played with the sugared rind, and don't notice any bitterness.

WOW this is great lemonade. I used a lemon zest tool to peel off only the zest. After an hour with the sugar I put the lemon zest, sugar and about 4 cups of hot water into a small sauce pan and let is simmer for about 15 min. followed rest of recipe as is. So good my husband and son loved it.

This is the best fresh lemonade I have ever made!  I've already made it three times in the same amount of weeks.  I do add a little bit more sugar as a personal preference.  It has the perfect amount of sweet vs tart.  Love it!

I sliced the rind off like you would a pineapple, that made the lemons so easy to squeeze over a strainer. I was able to just mash the whole thing down over the strainer. This was awesome lemonade! Very yummy, not too sweet, not too sour!

A delicious lemonade!  I'll give this recipe only 4 stars because though it's probably the best lemonade out there, it's still just lemonade.  I about halved the amount of sugar, and added some extra water for my taste.

I made this with my fresh lemons and limes I had just lying in the fridge. Yes, limes! I only had 4 lemons and the recipe calls for 5 and someone once told me that about 3 limes makes 1 lemon...so I added 4 lemons and four limes. Its pretty good...but it tastes a little limey...guess if you like it though you could try it like I did! I give this a 3 only because of my addings.

So refreshing!  I had forgotten how great old fashioned lemonade tasted when all we'd made for years was the mix stuff.  This is very easy and tastes great.

Wow, really delicious and refreshing.  We were just given a bag of lemons from a friend and we wondered what we could do with them. Now we know.

This is a great recipe. A little time consuming though. I took the advice of one of the reviewers and peeled the lemons making sure to take off as much of the membrane as possible. I think next time I will grate the lemons. (easier to keep out the membrane). I also added limes to the recipe. I doubled the recipe, and added 3 limes to it. I also added a little extra water. By the time you get it all together you get about a gallon. My family loved it! I can't wait to try it using other fruits.

I like me lemonade good and strong, so I used some extra lemons when I made my first batch.  It ended up actually being too strong.  I suspect this recipe will satisfy the lemon lovers like me out there exactly as stated in the recipe.  The flavor truly is incredible, like peeling a fresh lemon!

As others did, I peeled fruit with a vegetable peeler to get as little of the white as possible. Used a couple small limes as well as one orange because I didn't have enough lemons. Absolutely AMAZING citrus fragrance after the sugar sat with the peel (covered the bowl w/plastic wrap and it was sheer ambrosia peeling that plastic back)! I reduced the sugar as some others suggested: used 1 cup of sugar but next time would increase to 1 1/4 cups - it was just not quite sweet enough for me. It had amazing yellow color also~

I don't get why everyone else loves this so much!  It's not good.  I used only the lemon zest to make it less bitter, but to no avail.  After making this I asked myself, "Why didn't I just make lemonade from frozen concentrate?  It's much easier and tastes much better."

This was great.  I peeled the zest from the lemons with a good vegetable peeler so as not to get any of the bitter white part.

I made this on a hot summer day. Loved it!  But I did make slight alterations to suit my needs. I reduced the sugar to 1 cup. I added 2 more juiced lemons to 2 quarts of water and added I teaspoon of sliced ginger to the lemon zest and sugar mix.   Very refreshing. Will make again.

We were having a cookout and, as August in the South typically is....it was a scorcher! Needless to say, I needed a light, refreshing beverage to serve with the Baby Back Ribs. I chose this one and was absolutely delighted with the results! I loved it, our guests loved it, and hubby, who’s not a fan of Lemonade even said it was really good! In fact, he drank 2 glasses of it! I made this recipe, with the exception that I doubled it, exactly as it was written. Yes, it’s a bit of extra work but the results were outstanding. From this point forward, THIS will be my “go to” lemonade recipe! You really need to try it as, in my book, it puts other lemonades to shame.

Ah-mazing!! This is a huge hit. I substituted finely ground fresh coffee for the lemon, and didn’t add sugar. I also added frothed milk. Instead of heating in a pot, I used an espresso machine. It tastes just like a latte!

Have made this several times and love the intense flavor.    I  found that warming the peeled lemons in the microwave makes juicing them easier and yields more juice.

What I did that add lots of flavor is to peel the lemons with a potatro peeler.  Add them to the simple syrup at the start.  Then boil.  The entire kitchen will smell of lemon, and add lots of additional flavor.  Let the peels cool and you have lemon candies.  Be sure to use just the outer skin of the lemon, not the white pith.

I am not usually a fan of lemonade because of it's tartness, but gave this recipe a try for my daughter wanted to make lemonade. I opted to peel the lemons with a regular 'peeler' and though there was almost no white 'inner' rind of the lemon but to err on caution, I took the advice of other reviewers and didn't stir the mixture till I removed the rinds. It was DELICIOUS! The BEST I have EVER tasted! A keeper for sure!
oh fyi - don't need so much sugar. Start with less and adjust to taste as needed.

In the end I cut the lemons in half let them set in the warm lemon rind water. Squeezed the lemon in my clean hands. Then strained into pitcher. Wow Great!!!! I think I'll cut back the sugar to only a cup. I like the tartness. Will be making double batch to make ice cubes. Thank you for a really old fashioned lemonade!!!

I did not make any changes to this recipe. Covering the lemon rinds in sugar and then boiling them made it to bitter. I am going to try again, but this time I will only use 2 lemon rinds instead of all of them.

This lemonade is VERY LEMONY. The addition of the rind-sugar marinade takes it to the next level.
I achieved the same color of it in the glass. Beautiful.
Overall, it was too strong, with a lemon taste almost like one finds in disinfectant or household cleansers.
I will make it again one day, but with more water to dilute the strength.

What a wonderful delicious summer drink!! It takes a little bit of time, but it’s totally worth it. I used a veggie peeler  to peel the lemons and avoid the pith. I’m sure this is going to be a staple at my house all summer.

Refreshing and light. Beautiful served with twist of lemon. Requires quite a few lemons but well worth the real thing. Sugar content can also be adjusted if desired.

No changes, perfect just as it is. I’ll make it again probably special occasions as it does use a few lemons and they’re pretty expensive here in Maine. Thank you for this great recipe.

i had no idea what to do with the amount of lemons our backyard Meyer lemon tree produced until I found this recipe! i’ve now made it at least five times and each time everyone who’s tasted my lemonade has complemented it. i do reduce the amount of sugar a bit but otherwise unchanged.

I cut the yellow part of the peel away from the white part of the peel and poured the sugar over the yellow peeling. I mix this recipe at a ratio of 1 to 1 with iced tea fantastic either alone or with other flavors. I Love this recipe! Yum!

Best Lemonade recipe!!!!! I only used 1 cup of sugar and added about 1 cup more water. Perfect balance of tart and sweet. No more store brands ever. I did not find it bitter at all. If it comes out  bitter just adjust with water and/or simple syrup.

Made this according to recipe. I thought it was a great recipe. Although, ( it may sound silly), it was too flavorful. It was certainly interesting and a worthy experience but not for my take on lemonade. I like the plain "bland" lemon juice , water and sugar mix, although I would definitely encourage others to give this a shot!

I am not usually a huge fan of Lemonade, which is why I went searching for a recipe.  This was delicious: Not to bitter not too sour, but sweet with a bite!   Perfect.  And I went on to use the peels in the Candied Lemon Peel recipe , found on this site.  I now have Lemonade, candied peels, and lemon simple syrup, all fantastic, and all from 5 lemons!

I have made this recipe several times now, starting with the recipe being made exactly as  written. The great thing about this recipe is that is so easy to tweak  to your own tastes that you just can't go wrong.

What I have found that I like best is 4 large lemons, 1-1/4 cup of sugar and 1-1/2 quarts of water. I peel the lemons whole, taking as little of the bitter white part as possible, as suggested by many others. The last thing I do is juice the lemons and then mix the fresh juice in... well, not the last thing. I then put the sugar infused lemon peels in a small jar and add a cup of decent vodka and soak it in the fridge for a few days. I'm sure you can guess what the last thing is. I suppose the peels would also be good in a cup of hot or iced tea... whatever you do, don't just throw them away!

WARNING - DO NOT USE PLASTIC BOWLS TO MAKE THIS RECIPE.  Use glass or ceramic. The high acidity of the lemons can leach chemicals out of the plastic and at a minimum affect the flavor, but possibly be much more hazardous than that. I used melamine the first time and noticed a weird chemical taste and Googled it and found dozens of articles about the dangers of high acid foods in plastic bowls.

This is the best lemonade I've ever had. We made it in our classroom for "FUN Friday" using this recipe and a couple of the tips (don't get too much of the white from the peel, adjust the sugar as needed). I peeled the lemons and the students  squeezed all of them. It was a huge hit with my students and some of the staff. This will be the only recipe we use for lemonade from now on. We did float a slice of lime in it & would add a small piece of strawberry next time to make it look pretty.

Did not touch the peeling while sitting in the sugar as suggested by others and it turned out great, best I have had. It was a little to sweet for me so I just added more water to my glass as others preferred the sweetness.

Loved this recipe! Am adding a little extra to it though..
Muddle a handful of fresh spearmint into the sugar before putting over the lemon zest and you will get a wonderfully refreshing beverage for a hot summer day.
This recipe makes a quart of lemonade.

This is the best lemonade I've ever tasted! I made it for 50 people attending an after-funeral luncheon and everyone there loved it. I quadrupled the recipe, using Meyer lemons, and didn't change anything. The next week I made the same amount again for a large birthday party we hosted and this Vintage Lemonade got rave reviews! It is definitely worth the extra work.

Really good Lemonade!  I made it according to directions (other than juicing, since I have a juicer).  Next time  however I will use less lemon rind.  It was a little more bitter than I like.

This is the only way I will make home made lemonade! I used the zest of the lemons and added that to the sugar. I then strained the water and sugar with a slotted spoon, some of the rind did get thru. I didn't strain the lemon juice because my husband and I both like pulp.

I don't usually say a recipe was "great but we changed it" except that we had already started another recipe and realized we were able to finish with this better looking one.  We had put the  peeled lemons, minus the seeds, in the blender then strained it out.  We also started this very late at night and we ended up leaving the sugar sit on the lemon peels overnight.

I will definitely make this again but if I were to make it how I had before it would require more sugar.  A very intense flavor, it tasted like a lemon shake-up from a fair.

I used 6 lemons instead of 5 and cut the sugar to 1 cup and it was still sweet enough. I decided to use the microwave to boil the water. Awesome recipe, easy and delicious, thank you for sharing!!

Pretty good, but a bit sweet for my taste. I'd recommend using a little more juice and less sugar.

This is bitter. I even got as much of the white off the rind as I could. I followed the directions 100%. Sure is a lot of work.

Very good. Followed the recipe & suggestions to not stir sugar & peels. There's still a slight bitterness I'm not sure if I like or not. But I'd probably make it again. I wonder how this method would work with oranges?

yummy! I have always liked fresh squeezed lemonade, but doing it this way, WOW! I will never make it any other way now. I love that you can taste the oil from the peels and not just lemon juice.

I  make this all summer long, nothing like a summer hummer out by the pool on a hot Arizona day.
Greatest lemonade ever, follow what other reviews said, sweeten to taste, then it's time for a real treat.

What a unique way to prepare real lemonade! Hubby and I like a less sweet, more tart lemonade so I decreased sugar to the equivalent of 3 tablespoons per cup rather than the 4 tablespoons per cup as written.  It was perfect!!

I made this earlier today-it is wonderful,I did read some of the reviews beforehand (thank you all).I peeled just the yellow part,cut small-layered /w/ just 1 cup sugar.Cut the pith off the lemons.Quartered them and ran through my juicer.What took the most time was cutting the peel into 1/2 inch pieces.Next time will use my box grater and shred.We don't drink soda-so this will be a welcome change from Cranberry juice or try mixing them...

I changed nothing besides having very huge lemons, so I only used 3. It turned out awesome poured over ice, in a mason jar of course! Love! Now I just need to do the math so I can serve 100 people! Thank you!

I have made this recipe many times always receiving rave reviews. It is the best lemonade I have ever tasted.  I use our juice extractor to juice the lemons.

So delicious sometimes, other times it's bitter.  We keep trying though because when it's good, it can't be beat.   Thanks!

This is a great recipe. I used more water and more sugar. In all, my family loves the lemonade and I will DEF use it again. Next time I will try pink lemonade.

Hi,
I made this lemonade for my parents group meeting and it was fantastic.  My husband took a sneaky sip and made me promise that I had to make it for him.  Excellent, refreshing drink and surprising not very sweet

If you just use the lemon zest as opposed to the whole peel, the lemonade will not be bitter.
