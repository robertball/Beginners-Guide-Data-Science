Great taste!  I don't think I would mistake it for honey and really, I wouldn't want to.  This has a wonderful pear taste but is thick and rich like honey.  I've made 3 batches.  The first batch was a disaster.  Although my pears were ripe, they weren't ripe enough so they never dissolved.  I even tried stick blending them but it didn't work.  I also followed the directions and simmered on medium for 2 hours, however, after only 1 hour, it all of the sudden turned into a burned mess.

My second batch came out much better.  You want to use very ripe pears - almost too ripe - so that they break down when cooked.  Also, I cooked this for 3 hours on low - the lowest my stove would go - to prevent burning.  It worked like a charm!

My third batch is cooking now.  I again used very ripe pears but I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar.  I think this is my favorite batch.  It's darker, richer and has a much more complex flavor.  

Everyone who has tried it has loved it!  Thanks for a super recipe!

I like the recipe ... however ... the timing for processing this is way way WAY off. It takes more than 30 minutes for this to thicken. Try 2 hrs to 3 hrs. This is nearly the same recipe as another one I've used, and let me tell you, 30 mins would only produce pear honey liquid.
So if you're making this, try to simmer it for 2 to 3 hrs - until it has the color and consistency of honey. Good recipe, horrible directions.

I made this recipe except I used very ripe pears from my tree and only four cups of sugar. It turned out fantastic! I also dropped a maraschino cherry into each jar for a little "blush" and treat. 

I'll definitely make this again next year when I once again have an over-abundance of pears!

I love this recipe.  The first batch I made I cooked too long and it has the consistancy of jam. The next 2 batches came out wonderfully.  I discovered if I steam the pears first and run them thru my blender the fruit breaks down faster and the cooking time decreases. Everyone is talking about my pear honey and can hardly wait for me to make more.

A word of warning--if you're going to make a half- or quarter-size recipe, cut down on the cooking time!  I let mine go, thinking it would be fine, (it was the consistency of thick honey when I stopped cooking) and ended up with pear candy!  It got hard after it cooled.  Fortunately, it hadn't burned, so a few days later I melted it down and added more pineapple juice to recover the honey consistency.

This was very easy & everyone has been raving about the gifts I gave them.  I pulsed the pears in my food processor to ensure they would fine and not chunky.  I let it cook on low for a long time.  I will definitely make this again!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I make this every fall.  Beautiful golden color makes the perfect fall topping for hot biscuts or toast.  I cook it in the crockpot on med/high for about 6 hours, saves time and keeps me from standing over the stove.

New information----Ive Made this so many times and burned it so often, Ive finally found the secret! COOK DOWN THE PEARS AND  JUICE AND WHEN THEY ARE THICK ADD THE SUGAR---I think its the sugar that burns before it cooks down. I loved this recipe, I  used less sugar at first when I made the first batch and halved it. You could taste the pears and their mild flavor was so delicious, I decided to can more and give as christmas gifts. when I made the full recipe I burned it , so be careful. Thank you so much for an awesome recipe that will be made for years to come--as long as my inlaws have a pear tree!

This is my second year canning and I'm being much more adventurous. This was a great recipe. It took about four hours on the stove. I also used rock hard pears so first I steamed them then half way through cooking I noticed the pears weren't breaking down so I zipped them in the blender. Great texture. I took another viewers advice and popped in a little candied cherry in the middle. This is my favorite canning recipe thus far I think. Really neat and pretty. Thanks!

I had scads of pears to work up and was looking for something that could be used to make PBJ's.  This is perfect!  Same color as honey, texture just a little different, and tastes wonderful.

Very good! I used very ripe pears, and my immersion blender to speed up the process. I halfed the recipe and it came out perfect. Thanks for posting this recipe. UPDATE: I used some on my pork chops instead of apple sauce very good. I also used this instead of honey in my salad dressing made of white balsamic vinegar, evoo, and pear honey, that was fabulous!

We have an abundance of pears this time of  year and I wanted a recipe that called for pears but also for canning them in some sort of fashion.  This recipe was perfect and I can't wait until I can give these out for Christmas this year.  Thanks for the submission!

I loved this recipe.  This is a keeper, tasted so great!
However, I did a few different things.
I added freshly ground ginger and freshly ground nutmeg.
I also cooked it in my crockpot.  I put a tea towel under the top to keep the condensation from dripping back into the jam.  I put it on high for about 4 to 6 hours.  Towards the end I set the lid ajar so as to thicken the honey.  This freed me from constant stirring and kept the kitchen cooler.

Great tasting! Recipe adaptation courtesy of other cooks plus my own tweeking: Cook finely chopped pears in pineapple juice with 2 Tbl. lemon until soft. (Speed up process for those extra firm pears by microwaving cut pears in Ziploc Zip'nSteam bags before adding to pot.) Once pear/pineapple mixture is fully cooked & pears are soft, mix with hand blender until smooth.  Add 4 1/2 c. sugar (or more) to hot mixture.  Blend again.  Continue cooking until mixture boils and reaches preferred texture. (Approx 20 min) Stir often to prevent scalding. Pour into prepared jars.  This is a new favorite for our family. The texture and preparation reminds me of making homemade applesauce.  Yum!

Delicious. I didn't have enough pineapple juice so I added some lemonade to the recipe to keep the pears  from browning. It worked well. I also blended the pears after about 1 hour of cooking to speed things along.

I haven't made this yet (although it does look delicious and I am eager to try it) but, I thought I may suggest to those who have trouble with the pears burning on the stove:  Has anyone tried doing this in a crock pot?  My mom used to make applesauce very similar to this recipe (using apples instead of pears and apple juice instead of pineapple juice and less sugar.)  She always did it on the stove and she had to watch it carefully to prevent it from burning.  When I started making my own, I tried my crock pot and it works great -- no need to worry about it burning.  It would probably take longer than 3 hours (my applesauce usually takes about 5-6.)  I'm going to try it this way when I get around to making this recipe.

Oh dear, did I ever flub this up! I ended up halving the recipe,  I did 4 c of very ripe pears and simmered in 1 1/2 c pineapple juice, I increased the liquid and left the pears to cook for appx 2 1/2 hours on low. That all worked out very nice, I used my stick blender to smooth out the lumps also. I added 1c sugar and 1c brown sugar and returned the mixture back to a simmer, stirring often, about a half hour, until reduced almost to half. I used the very ripe pears so I could cut back on the sugar, but this is not a jam recipe so it relies on the large quantity of sugar to make it more of a syrup consistancy, where as jams, I find, you can tinker with the sugar a little and still come out okay. Oops...I made pear jam. But it tastes just wonderful and can't wait to try it with almond butter on some fresh bread! Although I'm pleased with my jam, and learned a lesson(I'm super new to canning), I still want to try this recipe again so I can drizzle it over ham! Lol, It's all about the ham!

Lovely flavor and texture. I put the pears through the food processor with pineapple juice and then cooked it. The color is a lovely amber.

Very ripe pears is the secret but try adding 1/4 cup of rum to the recipe when it is just finished cooking. This puts an 'adult' flavour to it that can't be beat.   I add this 'adult' Honey to the bottom layer of apple crisp, pear crisp or even fruit pies.

I had a lot of very ripe pears that were too ripe to can, so I am glad I found this recipe. I quadrupled this recipe and it worked great! I stood by it while it came to a boil and stirred often to avoid burning. Once it started boiling, I lowered it to Med/Low temp and let it do a slow simmer and occasionally stirred it. I only cooked it for 3-4 hours and once it was the color & consistence of honey I turned it off and canned it. I made 17 jelly jars and 10 pints. Plenty for my family, extended family and friends! I will make this every year!

3rd year making this-it's my favorite.  Try it on a hot buttered biscuit-it's probably the best thing you've ever put in your mouth.

This is a great recipe and has been a huge hit as holiday gifts. I have friends asking for more every year. The cookings instructions listed cause the bottom to burn. If you are patient bring it to the boil over med-high heat, then instead of cooking it on medium for 2 hours, simmer it for 3 and be sure to stir frequently. This has helped reduce the burning SIGNIFICANTLY! I also use about 1/2 or less of the sugar required. Reducing the sugar brings out more of the pear flavor and isn't so grossly sweet. If you like overly sweet honey then by all means use the total sugar listed!

I used really ripe pears, almost to the too ripe state so the sugar content was already really high just in the fruit.  With that and other people stating 8 cups sugar was too sweet I cut the sugar down to 3 cups.  I had it simmering for something like 4 hours, or so.  SO GOOD!

Wonderful! I took the advice of others by reducing the sugar to 6 cups. Next time I may even use only 4 cups. The taste of the pears is delightful! Enjoy!!

After reading all the other posts, I decided to minimize the risk of the pears not breaking down by running them through my food processor first.  I couldn't find any pineapple juice in the three stores I checked (I know, what is this world coming to...?) I checked out some other recipes and some called for crushed pineapple.  So, I added a can of crushed pineapple, and following the advice of wildflower I used half white and half brown sugar.  I cooked it slow and low, and it was an immediate hit with everyone!  The texture was a little more like a thin applebutter.  My next batch, I was a little short on the amount of pears I had pureed, so I grabbed a few more pears and as I was getting ready to throw them in the processor bowl, realized they wouldn't blend well with only that small amount.  My Ninja system has an individual cup blender attachment, so I put the last few pears in it.  They were totally smooth in a matter of seconds!  I decided to run the rest of the batch through it, and the resulting product really was just like a honey consistency! Any of those single serve drink blenders will probably work great.  Cook long enough to thicken down, and you will really believe in this as a honey alternative flavor.  It's great on toast, waffles, ice cream, or anything we've tried it on. I took a jar with me to my favorite restaurant to use on their scones, and the owner asked what it was.  I let her try it, and she immediately asked for the recipe... Thanks!!!

This is my grandmothers recipe.  This year someone gave me some pears and I made it as always.  But the pears were different than the ones I have always used.  They were soft not the old big hard ones like we raised at home.  They did not make it the same.  So if you have those big old hard pears that is what you need to use.  I hope everyone enjoys this. I know that my grandmother would have loved to share this with everyone.  I am making a cooker full right now.  THank you again Vickie

I made this with some pears I had frozen from last fall. Very delicious. I loved it. I make pear honey with a similar recipe, and this one is just as good as the other I've used for years. thanks

YUM YUM !!!  This is the first recipe in which I didn't use store bought pectin. I cooked it for 2 hrs on low after first boil and it is perfect- It set up nicely and taste is like honey. The only thing I changed was I added 2 T lemon juice. Scorching will occur if not stirred frequently- I do not recommend using stainless steel pot- I had to baby it every 5-10 mins.  My husband loves honey and he loves this. Thanks for this great recipe. Reminds me of my grandmothers.

This recipe looks so beautiful in the jars!  I did cut the sugar down to 6 c., and next time probably will cut it down to 4 c., simply because I think that sugar shouldn't overpower the fruit taste of preserves.  Will definitely continue to make this recipe.

It's both bizarre & delicious that this tastes just like real honey! Made it in the slow cooker on high setting over 6 hours. Poured it off into half pint jars & gave them to friends & family - who have all said they loved it. Even my friend who won't eat bee honey ate this & loved it!

I just finished making a double batch of this honey. I cooked it on medium high until it boiled and then on medium low for an hour. Then to medium to finish it up. It cooked a total of 2 1/2 hours, until it "sheeted". I stirred it frequently. It tastes great and it made 22 half pints. I can not wait to try this in my daughters favorite recipe, honey glazed chicken wings! Thanks for the wonderful recipe. Now what to do with the 3 bags of pears I have left. LOL

Folled this recipe exactly the first time.  Turned out wonderful.  Very tasty.  Tried again but was very tired so put it in slow cooker on low over night.  Surprisingly tasted great.  Much richer and darker in color but wonderful taste and aroma.  Also, I used a hand-held electric blender for smoothness.  Worked great.  Excellent use of pears for gifting.  Thanks for submitting.

I was looking for a way to use a bumper crop of pears that was ripening faster than we could eat or can them.  Used my Kitchenaid food strainer attachment to puree the ripe pears so we didn't have to peel them.  I was so impressed with the first batch, I made two more!  Very yummy!

Followed the recipe as a base. Used 6 cups of white sugar and a generous handful of dark brown sugar. We have big hard winter pears, so I diced them and simmered with the pineapple juice until soft like applesauce, then used a handheld blender until smooth. Then added the sugar and simmered on low for 2 hours. I removed a teaspoonful at a time, placing in the refrigerator until cold, to check the texture, since the jars will be refrigerated. The mixture darkened and thickened and is delicious... at 6,000 feet I processed them for 20 minutes in the canner.

I tried to do this, but instead of cooking on the stove, I used my crockpot.  Horrid results.  The pears never did break down (and they were very ripe) and the juice did not thicken up at all.   I had to throw the entire batch out.  I guess I should have cooked it on the stove per the directions given.  Oh well, lesson learned.  Hated it though that I wasted so many pears!

I loved this recipe! It tasted like my Grandma's and was a piece of cake compared to other fruit honey recipes! It definitely takes a while to make though so set aside a few hours. I made a bigger batch and did 12 Cups Pears, 2/3 Cup Pineapple Juice, and 12 Cups Sugar and it turned out great. I also took some advice from one of the previous reviews and cooked it on a lower setting for three hours and I didn't have a problem with it burning. It's not quite as thick as regular honey, but it comes close and is thicker than my Grandma's recipe. I will definitely use this recipe again! I can't wait to make some home made bread now to go with!

Mmmm! I just finished the first batch. I have to admit, the cooking time is very LONG. I was getting annoyed toward the end. I didn't want to leave it and have it scorch as others mentioned, so I stirred it constantly at the end. I got a bit impatient so I turned up the heat from time to time. As I said, though, I was right there, stirring. BUT, the reward is worth the wait. AND, all my jars sealed. Woo Hoo! I don't think it will last long around here. Thanks!

This is my second year making this as Christmas gifts. Everyone loved it the first time and it was requested again and again. I used a mixture of Bartlett, D'Anjou and Bosc pears, 24 pears in all to make a double batch. I ended up with around 12 cups of pears for each recipe so I increased the pineapple juice to 1 and half cups and I also reduced the sugar to 6 cups as it is very sweet. I pulsed the pears in my food processor before cooking and at the 2 hour mark I pulled some of the mixture out and gave it a whirl in the blender. I like some chunks of pear but not a lot so this worked perfectly. I have never had problems with it burning but I do keep a close watch on it and stir often. Can't wait to have some on my fresh baked bread Christmas Eve morning.

I can tell the taste would be fabulous, but cooking on medium for just 2 hours ruined the batch.  It petrified into more of a hard candy after putting it into jars and cooling.  I will probably try it again and cook it at more of a simmer temperature.  I guess every stove is different, so be careful!

Using Asian Pears, I just couldn't get a 'honey' texture no matter how long I cooked/simmered (three batches).  I started by pureeing pears in food processor and adding sugar after simmering for several hours.  I finally dumped the hot sugar'd pear sauce in the blender (1/2 of it at a time since it wouldn't all fit) and liquefied for 1+ minute.  Whala - not quite like the picture, but at least I'm not wondering if I should be using a pearsauce recipe instead of this one.  I think the type and ripeness of the pear makes the most difference in how honey like this will turn out.

The pears taste divine in this recipe.  I made this a week ago and I still crave it! Plus, it is not expensive to make and so that is a nice bonus when you are canning.  After reading some of the reviews, I was mourning that I had used the full amount of sugar in the recipe so I added a half teaspoon of salt (full recipe size) and it cut the sweetness.  On the second batch (half recipe) I reduced the sugar and added a small jar of drained and chopped maraschino cherries in the last half hour of cooking. Divine!!

Mmm, amazing!  This does taste very similar to honey, but with a subtle pear flavor.  So delicious, and it cans like a charm.  Thank you so much!

This is definitely a keeper! I took a tip, and pureed the pears along with the juice beforehand - I didn't want chunks.  After that I cooked on medium for about 1.5 hours in a porcelain pot - no scorching, but I was always in the kitchen and stirring FREQUENTLY.   I only made half a batch so it was done a bit faster.   Next time I will definitely turn it to simmer and try to cook longer as others suggested.  It is great when warmed in the microwave.

Very tasty recipe, I made it as a vegan honey alternative. I made a batch using only 1 1/2 cups of pears (i.e. 2 pears), and it took maybe 1 hour and 20 minutes to finish. However, even though I finely chopped my pears, not all of them broke down. If you're doing a smaller batch, PLEASE put the pears in a blender or food processor before cooking! I tried processing it after and it puffed up, leaving me stuck with pear...icing. Batch ruined.

Bought way too many pears from nice man at farmer's market. Saw this recipe and got started.
 I processed pears in food chopper. Added Splenda instead of sugar. Cooked it down to more the consistency of jam, rather than honey. But boy, it's good on peanut and butter sandwiches to frozen yogurt topping. And it's guilt free.

First time making this and turned the heat down to low to cook for three hours.  Looks beautiful but is a little too sweet for our liking.  We will cut back on the sugar for our second batch and use some brown sugar as suggested in one review.  Put the pears in a food processor before cooking and that seemed to help break them down.  Will use pears that are more ripe the second time.

I used 17 small to medium sized bartlett pears, 1.5 cups of pineapple juice, and 8 cups of sugar.  Chopped to smithereens in my food processor.  Cooked on low (or medium if I was in the kitchen watching and stirring) 4 hours.  This made 8.5 half pint jars.  I think the pineapple juice is the key to making this taste like honey.  Don't get me wrong, you really do taste the pear too but the pineapple just gives it a little bite.  A keeper!

The first time it came out very dark and much more like a jam. I cooked it 3 hours on medium heat, mainly cause the first batch made 4 quarts rather then 2 quarts. (2 pints to a quart) This second batch I cooked for 2 and half hours on low, figured that the reason it was so dark was cause the sugar started to burn/scortch, lower temprature for not as long a cooking time in theory would of produced a more honey like consistancy. So far it is very very soupy. More like a juice then anything else. Sadly I lack any lids to recan or I'd cook it for longer, though it is still delicious. Either way, it's excellent, and well deserving of use in a special bbq sauce made for a special event.

Amazing dessert topping! I finely diced and steamed the pears for 15 minutes before simmering all ingredients for 2.5 hours. The final product has the consistancy of honey with small bits of pear, and tastes like caramelized pears. Yummy for topping vanilla ice cream or cheesecake!

This has become a tradition! We have made it 2 years in a row now and given it as neighbor gifts for Christmas... this year I have had over half a dozen families ask if they were getting their jar of pear honey! It is FABULOUS!!! I do cook it on a lower setting for longer to keep it from scorching, and I ran my almost too ripe pears through a food mill (like applesauce) and it cut down on the cooking time some as well, but it is perfect otherwise! Thank you so much for sharing this!! It has become a family favorite!

This recipe is extremely sweet- almost too sweet. (And I love sweet!) It does not taste like honey at all other than the intense sweetness. The pear flavor is very good in it though. I added a box of fruit pectin to make it thicker like jam. Maybe I should have left it out, however. Also, I doubled the recipe and it make 9 pints w/ a little exra. This was a little labor intensive for me for the amount it made.

A great way to use a bunch of ripe pears.  The texture is a little gritty (because pears are that way) but the taste is superb.  I pureed the pears before I cooked them, which greatly aided in the process in cooking down the mixture.

We have 2 pear trees in our yard so I wanted to find a way to use the large quantities of pears we had.  I make this last year and everyone loved it.  This year I boiled it longer for a thicker jelly and everyone said it was better when it was thinner.

This was my first experience canning.  The recipe is very simple & I followed it as written, stirring routinely but I was not constantly in the kitchen.  I used 6 cups of sugar & it was still plenty sweet.  Less sugar probably affected the end consistency as it was more like "apple butter" than traditional honey.  Regardless, it is a huge hit with my family! Delicious - very excited to give away as Christmas gifts!

This is suprisingly similar to the taste of honey. I only used 7 cups of sugar and find that it is still a tad sweet for my taste I used my immersion blender at the end to smooth out the honey as I didnt want any little chunks in it. Overall a very good recipe, but if I was to make it again, I would cut down to 6 cups of sugar.

I am giving this a 4, because this tasted more like a "jam" to me than "honey". Taste was good, but I would cut the sugar down next time.

We make our own Granola which calls for honey in the recipe so when I had a bumper crop of ripe pears, saw this recipe, I knew I had to try it.  I read through all the tips - a must - and found the best advice - I used 10 large very ripe pears, shocked them to release their peal - boiling water for a few seconds - they are ripe-  then cold water. It was a bit messy but fast. I washed them once pealed to remove all peals and blemishes. I then chopped them and tossed them along with the pineapple juice in a Blender pulsing it into a sauce - I then placed this in a crock pot and added the sugar - 1 cup brown for taste and 7 cups of white. Cooked on high one hour stirring every 20 minutes. I then placed a dish towel under the lid to catch the escaping steam preventing it from falling back into the crock and cooked on low several hours - over night is best.  I allowed it to cool and was amazed at how much it resembled honey in texture, you would swear this was pear tasting honey! I then divided it into small jars and sealed them in a hot water bath for 20 minutes. Now to make that Granola. This will be an excellent substitute for that expensive honey.

My grandmother-in-law made this, except she chopped hard Texas pears into thin wedges. I use D'Anjou pears. The proportions are one cup of chopped pears to one cup of sugar. Mix these in a deep covered pan and let sit over night. The sugar draws the pear nectar out of the chopped pears. (You'll be amazed at the amount of liquid.) Then follow the recipe here as written with the exception of the pineapple juice to keep the pears from browning--the pears will not discolor in the sugar nectar.
I like to cut fresh ginger coins (about 5 inches of ginger to 11 cups of pears) into the mixture for a little heat/spice. Also, you can steep about 20 fresh cardomon pods in the nectar over night for a subtle flavoring. Remove the cardomon before cooking. Bring to a boil and then lower to med/medium low until candy thermometer reaches 230°. Also, I use the plate in the freezer method to test for consistency. If you cook this too long, it turns into hard sticky pear candy when it cools as many here have noted so take care. Also, mixture foams and will boil over so you need to stir it down every now and then as necessary.

I just made this and it is wonderful!! I boiled on the stove top then moved to my crock pot  for the remainder of cooking time. After 2 hours the pears still were not breaking down so i put them in the blender and returned to crock pot. I also did as other viewers suggested and used half white sugar and half brown sugar. I will make this every year thanks for a great recipe.

This was my first experience canning pears period let alone making pear honey.  To say it's delicious is an understatement.  The instructions were well written so even a novice could understand.  I added a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg to my taste but otherwise followed the recipe. It is very time consuming so be prepared to spend lots of time doing prep and watching over it as it cooks but it is soooo worth it!  Love it!

A good starter recipe for pear honey.  The consistancy was right on.  My pears should have ripened a few more days and it would have been much better, but that is my fault so I still gave it 5 stars.

This is super good, but has a pineapple flavor that does overtake the pear flavor. I think it also is super sweet even with 1/2 the sugar. I also kept waiting for the thick to happen as honey, it never did and I pulled my 1/2 batch after 2 hours of cooking. It was still really runny but looks to be thicking after it sits for a while. 
This does taste more like a jam to me than a honey though. But overall love the recipe I will try it agian, makes a great dip! Egg rolls or with sour cream and crackers!

This is an excellent pear recipe if you like super sweet jelly.  It seemed to me to have a carmel flavor.  I used the blender to make it finer.  I cut the sugar to four cups and it is still super sweet.  I will give some of the jars away at Christmas.

Excellent. I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar. You can reduce the sugar. You might want to start with half the sugar and then increase if desired.

This looks great and I have 4 pear trees all loaded this year, but I am alergic to pineapple, is there another fruit juice with the same sort of enzymes that would work in this recipe, I am thinking the pineapple has a part in breaking down the hard pears.

I was so amazed that I could make honey. This is a wonderful treat, and I love it.  Thank goodness my in laws have pear trees so I can always make this for my husband and myself, as well as others.  I plan to make it for little gifts for the holidays.  I made it the first time, and cooked for two hours as suggested.  That was way to long tho.  I have to melt it in the microwave to get it to melt and eat.  The second and third time I made it however, I cut the cooking time down to one hour.  PERFECT!!!!!!! Thank you so much.

Very good!  I even HATE pears and I thought this was good, the flavor wasn't too strong, but it was just enough that you knew it was there.  I made several jars for Christmas baskets.  I only had to cook it for 2 hours and I took the advice of others and cooked down the pears before adding the sugar to prevent scorching, had no problems!

Pear Honey is delicious, but I will never make it again.  After reading the reviews, I was very nervous about burning it because I only had enough pears to make one batch.  I cooked it on low and it took 6 hours to get to the consistency of runny honey.  I did not have any more time to babysit this and then, on top of it all, it only made four 8 oz jars!  With all of the prep time, cooking time and clean up time, this was not worth the effort.

Although to get this "honey" to its desired consistency is much longer than stated, this is a delicious recipe! I found that if the fruit does not want to break down completely the honey can be put through the blender.

We used the wild hard pears from a local farmer’s tree, he couldn’t recall the variety because the tree was there when his father bought the farm and he’s 82.

Think of the supernfirm pears, yellow green skins with black spotted mottling,  larger than most commercial varieties. We peeled and used 10 of these double fisted giants. They were firm but very ripe. 

We made a second batch using softer, Bosch variety pears and it came out more like pear ‘butter’, with a grainy applesauce like texture.

Other important notes: 
We think the pineapple juice and sugar are essential, but we cut back the sugar from 8 cups to only 6 cups because that was plenty to cover the cut pears. We had cut the pears into about 1” squares so that they would soften and cook a bit quicker. 

After they did soften (about 2 hours) we used a Moulinex stick blender to smooth it up even more.
Then we added the juice from a fresh lemon and a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice and let it simmer (and stir) for another hour until it looked just like honey.

We canned this into various sizes jars for gifts, but I think the total yield was around 8 pints.  
Everyone who has tried it just loves it! There is no doubt it will become one of our family traditions!

I found this recipe on Allrecipes several years ago and now it's a staple around my house.  I don't have a pear tree myself, but I've made a deal with a local farmer  and he sells me all of his overripe and bruised pears at a STEEP discount.  I use this on toast, ham, in tea....anything.  We love it!!  Once I ran out o white sugar and made it with  4 cups white an 4 cups brown sugar.  That's my favorite.  Another time I added in jalapenos.  YUM!!!  When I make this my house smells amazing.  I wish i could bottle that scent!!  Also,if  I don't have time to let this simmer until ready I prep the pears and freeze them in a ziplock bag with the pineapple juice, then I can go back at any time I have a few hours and cook some up.

A great alternative spread for bread, and a fantastic way to make use of the pears from our garden!Before converting this year's harvest, I read the reviews for this recipe and decided to puree the peeled, chopped pears in my food processor, cooked the fruit with the pineapple juice and 5 cups of sugar until they came to boil in a saucepan on the stove top.. I then transferred it into my slow cooker to cook at high for three hours covered.I remove the cover and tasted the mixture and decided the flavour was lacking something.  I then stirred in one more cup of sugar and a pinch of salt.  Finally, I let the mixture come to boil in the covered slow cooker and removed the lid to let the mixture reduce until the thickness is to my liking. It took one more hour before it was the thickness of honey that has become slightly granulated, a nice spreadable consistency. This recipe is a keeper!

I made pear honey with my mother in law. She didn't use a recipe and I thought that I could remember it. When she passed and I longed to make it again, I wasn't sure of the proportions so I looked it up. This is very similar and just as delicious as hers. The misnomer here is it should be called pear honey preserves, as the goal isn't to have it look just like honey. The chunky pear pieces make it spectacular. The challenge is to find local pears just shy of ripe. You want them quite firm. She chopped them into  1/4" cubes and added 1 whole clove for every cup of sugar (removed before canning). It is a slow, long cooking that thickens the syrup - so when you lift the spoon out of the pot, it doesn't all come off. That's when it's done - and I always hope the pears keep a little firm, just like hers.

My pears just wouldn't completely dissolve, so the syrup has a slightly overcooked taste.  I ended up straining out the bits. I wish I had given up on completely dissolving them a little earlier.

I have made this recipe for 40 years. My family loves it! The only alterations I have ever needed was to sub lemon juice for the pineapple as my father's ulcer would not tolerate the pineapple, and the use of Whey Low for sugar in my diet recipe. I agree with others, it does not taste like honey, but it is a great recipe

I made this in my crockpot with Bartlet pears.  I added only 4.5 cups of sugar and it was quite sweet.  I added the sugar after the pears were broken down, and the final product ended up looking like a thin applesauce.  It tasted very good, was easy enough, but I didn't find it honey-like at all, in taste or appearance.

Great recipe but I found that the cooking time should be less, if you do not want a thick honey.  I suggest checking after an 1 1/2 hour. Put a small drop on a plate to check thickness, if needs longer check in 10 mins.  Has a great taste and is good with toast or tea.

I read several of the reviews where they talked about using less sugar. I made this today using 8 cups of chopped pears,  12 ounces of unsweetened pineapple juice and 4 cups of sugar. I cooked the fruit and juice for 30 minutes, then used an immersion blender to break the fruit down even more. I then added the 4 cups of sugar and cooked it in low for 3 hours. I ended up with 7 half pints of this gorgeous, delicious yumminess! I’m so glad I cut back on the sugar because It is sweet enough for us! I’m definitely making more of this!

Used 4 cups very ripe pears and four cups sugar, simmered for 2 hours, turned out perfect. I would definitely cut the sugar down by half next time, though.

I made 4 batches and it is so good. Cooked for 3 hours. I made 2 batches at a time. I used the Pamper Chef apple peeler and it was fast. Thanks

Before making this I read through the reviews for do's, don'ts, and adjustments others had made.
  I use raw sugar, not bleached white sugar, so I knew the color would be darker.
  I ended up with only five jars and it's more like a jelly/apple butter consistency. I'm going to tweak it a little more next time.
 The flavor is great. I did steam and puree my pears first.
 I will definitely try this again.

I amended the amount of sugar to 4c. with 1/2 of it being a light brown sugar. Cooked it in the slow cooker on HIGH for the estimated time, though it never boiled.  Used a stick blender toward the end & let it cool. Good flavor, will refrigerate the honey & give them away for gifts.

I really liked this it had great flavor but like someone else said if you do not have really ripe pears you will want to pre cook them and send them through the blender a bit.I did not do that and I ended up with sort of marmalade.It is still great though.I am not one for real sweet but my husband loves it.I also like but Next time I may try to reduce the sugar.

Like Wildflower my pears did not disintegrate even though they were ripe with some brown spots on them.  I  brought them to a boil and then turned them on low for 3 hours.  It taste good put do not know what to do with it.

super tasty, super good!!! We simmered for 3.5 hours on low to make sure it didn't burn, and it was perfect! We did pull the chunks out after 2 hours to puree for a smoother finish. Next time I would puree at the very beginning. We did 6 C if sugar instead of 8, and it is just right. still sweet but not too much. We think this would be good with some nutmeg in it (we tried several variations after it was done and had cooled in little ramekins), and will likely try that next time for greater depth of flavor.

Excellent!  Thank you from all of us with pear trees.  This is my first time making this recipe.  I followed everything as is and it's delicious.  My first time canning by the way.  I feel accomplished.  I did cut down pears and sugar to 6 cups only because I didn't have 8 cups of sugar.

I made this by the directions...almost. I started with 11 and a half cups of mixture. I cooked it for 1 hr and 15 minutes. I stopped at that time because I noticed it was getting less and less, so went ahead and put it in my jars. I ended up with 4 cups of pear honey. If I had cooked this for 2 to 3 hrs, I wouldn't have had any left in the pot. Not to speak of the jars I had left over that I had prepared to put all this in. I felt like I had wasted my time, pears, sugar and energy on this project. 
I wish I had scrolled on down to one of the other more practical recipes that called for less cooking time.

I read the reviews. Making the adjustments most agreed upon, less sugar and puree before cooking.  It looks like Apple sauce or an apple butter.  Watched the video supplied by allrecipes. Video shows chunks of pear in an amber syrup, due to the large amount of sugar.  Google pear honey and most recipes call for crushed pineapple or fresh pineapple not just the juice AND lemon juice. Cooking 30 min. not 3 hours. I think this recipe is confused. It has good flavor but way too much work for something that doesn't know what it wants to be when it's finished.  I also had a problem with 8 cups of pears. Depending on how you measure and cut your fruit there is too much room to leave yourself guessing

Oh, my yes!  I'm sure that this stands on its own, but I added some candied ginger, a little cinnamon and a splash of vanilla.
Fantastic recipe.  Thank you for sharing.  This will be a new tradition at our house.

I used 4 ripe, cored pears and blended them in my vitamixer, skins and all.  I took one cup of coconut sugar (diabetic hubby), 2/3 cup of water and a dash of cloves.  We drizzle it on our summer vegies.  Also its a great base for a salad dressing.  I put half balsamic vinegar and half pear honey, delicious!

Very nice! The family loved it on pancakes and waffles in substitute of syrup or honey. It has a very subtle pear taste, and perhaps just a touch too sweet for me, but otherwise I love it. The only change I made was reducing it to make just one jar.

I agree with another reviewer that I wouldn't mistake it for real honey but regardless, the taste is great, has a beautiful golden hue, and a honey texture.  Heeding notes of other reviewers, I made sure my pears were very ripe and added the sugar in the second hour of the 2 hours it took to cook.  Will try it on pancakes tomorrow.  The Pear Honey will make great gifts.  I don't know what directions Yentl22 was looking at but unless the directions were changed after that review was made, the directions for cooking 2-3hrs was spot on.

This is very good but it doesn't taste like "honey" to me.  It makes more of a yummy pear syrup/jam (it is the consistency of honey). I cooked for much longer and pureed the pears.

Just made my first batch.  Used dropped pears from my tree.  The liquid turned honeylike in a about 3 hours but the pears didn't break down so I had to puree it.  The puree is yummy too.  Pears would need to be super ripe to end up looking like the picture.
