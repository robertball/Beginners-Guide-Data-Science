Made it as a soup by adding 4 cups of chicken broth, diced tomatoes and pasta.  Topped with mozzarella and crumbled bacon.

This recipe is delicious!! I have done twice already and will definitely do it again.
For the second time I substituted the bacon with ham and the green olives with black olives as I thought the green olives made the dish to salty (to my taste). Served over a bed of white rice.

The bacon adds a great layer of flavor. I had pearl couscous on hand, but my husband thought noodles would be a better choice.  That's how I served it, and would in the future, as well.  I did cut back a bit on the tomato sauce, and although the instructions don't say to slice the olives, I did cut them in half. Next time, I will not cook the chicken to a “deep golden brown,” would just cook until lightly browned.  This mixture simmers for an hour, and the chicken cubes ended up a little tough on the exterior from overbrowning.  Easy to make with a deep rich flavor, just takes some time to "stew" (pun intended) for the flavors to meld and the sauce to reduce. I would make this again.
