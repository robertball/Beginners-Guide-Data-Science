If the recipe had included directions on cooking the sugar mixture, I would be able to enjoy the apples right now. It left out a very important step such as DON'T STIR THE MIXTURE AFTER IT BOILS OR IT WILL NEVER THICKEN!!! I found this crucial step in other recipes after waiting for the mixture to thicken. This recipe has potential to be good because it seems so easy, and it is, if it wasn't for the lousy lack of directions.

Add about 1/2 pack (or more for your taste) of cherry Kool-Aid powder to the mixture to flavor.  Other flavors of Kool-Aid would be yummy too.

The apples came out great, tasted just like at the fair. Recommend using smaller apples and since the sugar hardens fast, don't do more than ten at a time. Also, make sure the apples are completely dry and wax free, otherwise the candy won't stick.

These apples taste just like the ones you get at a fair.  I made them as a treat for my co-workers and they loved them. Just be sure you have enough time to wait for the sugar to reach the hard crack stage.  i followed the advice of the person who said to put the pot in hot water when dipping and this kept the candy pliable for dipping as it does harden very quickly once removed from the water.

I made this recipe more than once! Candy making is not forgiving a candy thermomorter a must! if you under do it is sticky if you over do it is rock hard. Try using this recipe with red hots (a bag) to flavor and color unstead of red die. makes the flavor good. also can add a little cherry extract. taste like the fairs. Let the candy thermomorter read about 260 than turn heat down to cook rest of the way. this receipe can burn in a half of second after hard crack ball stage. must watch. Also don't kid yourself candy making is dangerous I burned myself trying to save my expensive pan. Heat and water don't mix. I went into the hospital  and had my baby that night with a burned scar on my hand. So don't do like myself and have a bunch of screaming kids at the table. the less distraction the better. Oh must have apples layed out on wax paper. use popsicle sticks unstead of the pricy apple sticks. spray wax paper with pam. after apple is dipped and dry use a cheap sandwich bag and tie off with red or green curling string. To remove excess wax peper off apples use a clean new wet rag. To clean pan pour excess syrup in some old crisco can or something you will throw away. soak your pan in dish liquid and water. Recipe is a keeper once you've mastered it. This receipe is not your every day and is very tricky but well worth it! so go ahead and charge like the fairs. or give away. Most likely will ruin a batch or two. but once you've found your magic stick with it! well good luck!!!

Fantastice recipe. Anytime you ad an oil or additional items to the recipe it will change the cooking time to hard crack. I used this with green color and peppermint flavor on Pears. Yummy
Great for Christmas, Red apples and Green pears, I also did the clear glass on some Pink Lady apples, some peppermint oil (just a couple of drops) added clear edible glitter and they looked as if the had been frozen, did this on green grapes as well. Great fun. thanks again, you have a winner.

You have to work very fast or the syrup starts to thicken and won't coat evenly.  I added grape oil to give it flavor.  Even though I used small apples, I had to double the recipe to get 15 apples coated.  Overall, they tasted good, but weren't worth all the work.

I've made this three times now and it's easy.  Tips:  You really do have to cook it the full 30 minutes or it doesn't get thick enough. Definitely test by dropping in cold water. It should be hard; that's when you know it's ready.  I also added the red food coloring while it was boiling, and it was more like 12 drops to get the rich red color.  If you use green apples which taste better with the candy coating, be aware that the red shell will not be as 'red'. May have to double dip.  Work fast.  The coating dries fast!

I thought this was very fun to do with the kids wash the apples really well and dry them with a towel if you dip them, I also cut up some apples in little slices put them on a large toothpick dipped them the kids had fun we also did strawberries blueberries the kids were so excited they were in the fridge looking for anything and everything to dip we also made some of the candy blue and purple and green we made a lot with the left over I sprayed a cookie sheet with veggie spray, spread the left over candy all diff cols together on cookie sheet and let them cool it looked like stain glass it was cool...it was fun thanks 4 the recipe (ps. i find if you put your pot in boiling water it keeps the candy warm enough to dip all the apples you need to iI also added cinnamon after i boiled it was very good  :)

I just did a trial run with this recipe, my first time making candy, much leess candied apples.  I added about a tsp of vanilla extract near the 250 degree mark to flavor, but may try a tablespoon of red hots next time (though they were great this way)!  Things that worked:  Must have a candy thermometer!  It took me an hour to reach 300 degrees on high heat on my ceramic cooktop.  Before that, it would make hard-ish strings when dropped in ice water, but at 300 it made fast, brittle, glassy swirly strings. I ate the strings. At 250, they were much too chewy.  At 300, they were perfect.  If your apples are too chewy, you may not have cooked long and hot enough.  Do not stir after you initially blend the ingredients.  I found that my temperature rose in spurts.  That last stretch from 250 to 300 happened fast.  The only stirring I did was to mix in vanilla and food color near the end.  Use long, firm sticks.  If too short, you might burn yourself.  I used bamboo skewers in the BBQ section of my HEB; they were perfect and pretty.  I made this in a 3 qt non-stick pot and used a silicone spatula.  The silicone can take high heat.  Early in the cooking process this stuff spattered tiny candy droplets everywhere.  Next time I will use a spatter guard.  The spatula cleaned up by flexing it to crack the cool candy off of it.  The pan needed a long soak and sponging to melt the candy off in hot water.  This stuff is boiling for a couple of minutes off the heat!  Pour in a metal can!

Thank you for sharing this great recipe. They are just like the one you buy at the fair. I made seventy-five candy apples for a church function. Don't be afraid to customize the recipe to servings needed; the recipe comes out fine. The directions were easy and apples came out great!  This recipe is a keeper!

I love this recipe it turned out great i added flavored extracts, different color dyes and also used kool aid to flavor the candy. Fantastic. One thing to keep in mind when making candy is the weather it turns out best when made on a sunny day with not much humidity. Elevation may also effect your candy. Also having a candy themometer is great cause temperatur can also be the difference betwwen hard candy and mush. Oh and remmeber to really wash your apples to remove all of the wax that store chains apply to them to make them look shiny as well as cleanse off the apples natural oils.

Great recipe. I looked over the reviews before cooking, so I knew how to make it work for us. Don't stir the mixture after boiling begins and let it cook on medium heat for at least 15 minutes before dipping the apples in. I turned the pan sideways and rolled them to cover as much as possible. They have to set awhile in a cool, dry area (couple hours at least) and do not refrigerate them while setting!

HI!
This is the first time I comment on anything! Anyway, Instead of using apples for this recipe, try trading 10 to 15 cherries for each apple. And use the stems instead of popsicle sticks, mmmm! semi-nutritious Candies!

A little too sticky for me.  I had to adjust the measurements and then it made the coating much crunchier....
the adjustments were: 3 cups sugar and 1 cup only of water.  The corn syrup remains the same.

My mom always told me that recipes like this should be made on a day when it is not raining.  If the weather is humid or rainy, the candy coating  will not set up properly.  It is soft or tacky.   This also goes for making peanut brittle or divinity.

this is a traditional candy apple (no cinnamon, THANK YOU!).  Some tips:  must use a candy thermometer...let mine get to 300 degrees and you need to work fast coating the apples.  I also used red food paste while sugar was cooking (had no liquid food coloring).  

I used tiny cortlands (found at Trader Joe's).  I bought them for the size, because the best-tasting apple to use is Granny Smith, but I went with size.  I was able to coat 10 apples...used "pointed cookie pop sticks" found at A.C. Moore. 

I buttered a piece of parchment paper and put the paper onto the cookie sheet...apples hardened nicely and peeled off paper; then put them in cello bags with ribbon.

I recommend reading the reviews to help with tips and tricks, especially if you are not familiar with making candy.  
I followed the recipe and just left it clear to try it out.  I prefer the red cinnamon flavor, so my next batch will be flavored. 
I was totally happy with the recipe the way it is written.  The only tip I have was, cut some wedges so you can use up the leftover.. and when the temp gets up to about 270 degrees, turn the heat down cause it shoots up fast after that.  Awesome candy apples!!  No mess no fuss!

I tried this recipe and loved it!  I would suggest that you buy a candy thermometer (cheap at Walmart) because it does make a difference.  I've tried to make these before and was unsucessful to say the least.... After using the thermometer I realized that I wasn't cooking the mix long enough.  It takes 20 plus minutes to reach 300 to 310 degrees.  They really do taste like apples you get at the fair!

These were absolutely the BEST! They taste exactly like those at the fair. We didn't have food coloring, so we omitted that. My husband loved the way they looked-like glass covered apples. My only problem was the fact that even though I halfed the recipe, I found I needed more than half the candy mixture. Some of my apples didn't get enough coating, but we ate them anyway and they were still delicious! As a previous reviewer said, placing the candy mixture into a pan of boiling water keeps the mixture from hardening. We will DEFINITELY be making these again... tonight as a matter of fact!!!

They were as great as I hoped!! I did 1/2 red & half blue. Thanks for sharing!! Make sure to remove from hea before adding the food coloring or your syrup will burn. Learned the hard way. Also, adding a little marichino cherry juice to the mixture will give it a subtle but nice flavor.

Where I live, Candy Apples are $3 an apple at a farm stand. I love them - they are right up there in my top five favorite foods of all time.  I was hoping that this would be a great candy apple recipe. I have made candy apples using kits but never before from "scratch". I am an experienced cook and thought that I would try it without the kit. I used a small pot and a candy thermometer. The recipe worked well in that it produced enough candy to fully cover 15 apples. The apples were shiny and hard and were beautiful to look at. However, the taste of the candy was lacking. The candy recipe as written is too BLAND. It was missing something. My family doesn't like cinnamon flavored candies so we skipped the red hots that some reviewers suggested. Reading other reviews, we tried different apples too.  It didn't matter what kind of apple - we used Macs and Granny Smith - both apples had plenty of flavor on the inside of the candy. The candy just did not compliment the apple. I am not sure what I should have added to make it taste "right".  I am giving it three stars because they were bright, shiny and beautiful. If the candy had more flavor, it would have gotten a higher rating.

I've been making a version of this recipe for almost 50 years and my mother used to make 150 at a time for Hallowe'en.  The trick is, and it's missing here, is to add a teaspoon of vinegar to the candy at the very end, when it reaches hard crack stage.  Don't stir the mixture while it's boiling until it reaches this stage. Then stir in the vinegar and start dipping the apples.  This step keeps the candy hard and is crucial to a good candy apple. Also, we use regular corn syrup, not the light AND we did not use any water in our recipe, it doesn't need it.  We decorated the apples with cut gumdrops to make faces.  Our house was the most popular one in town solely because of our candy apples.
After reading my review, I realize my version is quite different.  I should just submit my own.  Oh well, use my version if you like, it's been tried and true for many, many years.  My apologies to those people who don't like changes to a recipe.

I wish I had read more of the reviews before starting this - it took me much longer than I would have liked because I kept stirring instead of letting it boil straight for 20-30 mins. 

I added cinnamon and vanilla extract - and once everything was in order, they turned out great!

this is a great recipe!! it is like the ones that you get at the fair. the main thing is to not stir the mixture at all! or it will not stick to the apples, when you add the food coloring just stir enough to mix the color. let it boil for a while and then drop some of the mixture into some cold water, if it hardens and looks brittle your are done. it is so easy but work fast when dipping the apples because it does harden fast. Have fun and you will love this recipe.

We thought these were terrible, I can't say much for the taste, because I was too busy prying the candy off my kids teeth. The candy was WAY too hard. I am certain I followed the recipe and it was easy to follow , but I wouldn't recommend it if you  value your teeth.

Very easy, I made 18 apples from this recipe, I kept the mixture in hot water while I was dipping the apples - it took a few hours for the sugar to harden but it turned out just perfect. I used chopsticks as sticks.

This recipe is wonderful! I think the negative reviewers are obviously unexperienced candy makers. This recipe clearly states what temperature to cook it too. Mine turned out wonderfully. The candy was nice and solid , we were able to  bite through the candy coating, it wasn't sticky or gooey and we had a nice crunch. Absolutely delicious and well deserved five stars.

Just attempted this recipe in preparation for a bake sale that I am doing later in the week. I only did half, and I was able to coat 3 medium apples, a bunch of grapes I had in my fridge, and still had some left over to pour on a baking sheet. I estimate that half would have covered around 5 apples or so. One slight change I made was to add a dash of cinnamon oil. Super tasty, can't wait to try out my cherry flavouring! 
SO simple to make.. put ingredients into pan, stir to combine, then sit and wait for the temperature to rise! No need to stir or do anything until you hit 300 and add in your food colouring/flavouring!
Clean up tip: fill your candy saucepan with water, and place on stovetop to boil. Voila! 10 minutes and your hard candy coating is gone!

**Edit: Just tried it out with cherry flavouring on Granny Smith Apples: AMAZING. The full recipe made about 12 apples for me :)

This is a great recipe, although you will not get anywhere near 15 apples..... maybe 6 large ones or 10 small. Stir it as little as possible, use a candy thermometer if you've got one, otherwise, keep a cup of water next to the stove to put a couple drops of the mixture in to see if you get those hard, brittle threads! Good luck!

I tried this recipe, and it failed miserably!  My coating never got hard, and it just made a sticky mess!  I will never make this again.  I agree with other reviews that some of the steps are missing.

I used this recipe to make HUNDREDS of candy apples for an event we were having and got so many compliments about how great they were! Everyone loved them and they were really easy to do..the worst part was just waiting for the candy to get up to temperature..and then cleaning out the pots afterwords!

Awesome Recipe! I have made so many batches I can't even tell you how many. I have made them for boy scouts, friends, neighbors, meetings and everyone that has a pot luck is now asking me to bring them! I too kept stirring and it didn't thicken so thank you to those who said "don't stir". For Xmas we wax paper wrapped them with ribbons and gave them as gifts to neighbors. thanks for recipe.

I really wanted to make candy apples so I bought one of those kits.  Bad idea!  It did not turn out well at all.  I didn't want to give up so I gave this recipe a try.  I'm very glad I did.  It was VERY easy!  I added the food coloring and some cinnamon extract at 210 degrees and never stirred.  It didn't quiet make 15 for me (it made 11).  I used granny smith apples in bag.  It has a nice look to it when it is on the apples and taste great! I'll make these again next year!

Yummy! After failing with a packaged mix from the store I tried this recipe. Turned out great. It takes awhile to get to the hard cracked stage ( about 40 minutes for us) but they are worth it. I stirred my sugar mixture before it boiled -- no problem.

I made these for my 73 year old mother who once told me she loves candied apples from the fair but not the "fake ones with cinnamon".  She called me to tell me these are just like those from the fair and that she loved them.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE RECIPE!

The candy tasted good but I think I could have cooked it about 10 more minutes or so because it was really sticky and if the apples happened to touch each other they'd stick together pretty badly. Make sure you cook the candy long enough or you won't be happy with the result. It was a bit messy and hard to clean the pot but I will try again.

I've used this recipe three times - ding chopped candy canes at Christmas and cinnamon hearts for Valentines.  The recipe is always successful, but I increase the quantities about x.5 for 15 apples.

I tried this recipe a week before Halloween.. it was my first time making candied apples... the apples i puchased were sweet and delish. the best thing you can do is go and buy a thermometer to get the right temperature, I got mine at BB&B for $10, the deep fryer one. my kids and I made about 2 dzn. candy and 1 dzn. caramel.. i love this recipe, its simple and worth trying. after i shut the stove off, i left the pot on the stove to keep the mixture warm. I also added coconut flakes and crushed peanuts to the caramel.. yummm.. Also, its very important to wipe off the wax of apples, if not the mixture will slide off.

Don't change a thing! After a few trials & errors I got it just right...  I tried using Koolaid and my husband didn't like it.   Also, if you work fast enough you can get all of the apples coated without putting the pan in boiling water - although I found it was only enough to coat 12 small mcintoshs.  Using a thermometer is crucial as the one time I didn't have it hot enough and the candy didn't harden (sticky & messy), and the other time I cooked it too long and it had a burnt taste.  One last note - as others have commented, once it gets boiling don't stir or it won't thicken.  Will definitely be making again!

These are GREAT! So fun to make and simple to do too! I did have a slight problem though, I cut the recipe down to make only 4 apples, (just to see how they would turn out), but I only was able to get 2 whole apples and like 1/2 of another apple covered, and I used small apples, so I'm not sure how many apples the full recipe will yield. I can't wait to surprise my hubby with these when he gets home from work, (he has been begging me to try them). They look beautiful and I tasted a little off the 1/2 apple and it was sooooo good, just like I remember from a local bakery that used to be by my house. I will for sure be using this recipe over and over! Thanks for posting. :)

Great Recipe, thanks to those who said not to stir!!! I was stirring and thought I was doing or did something wrong because it wasn't thickening! You really saved my behind!  Although, the recipe didn't say to stir, I just "assumed". so good recipe! and thanks! yeh, it was great to know you could also add food coloring before it was done, I had a hard time checking the clear mixture.  also, used some cadies to roll them in like crushed candy canes mmmmmmmmmm good!

Delicious! Keep in mind to look for the "hard ball" stage (or use a candy thermometer), rather than a timer, to ensure that the candy is at a suitable consistency.  I personally had to cook mine for well over an hour.

This is the perfect "fair type" candy apple recipe!!! If you ar having trouble with texture or not thickening, then you did not get to the hard crack stage during cooking. I coated 13 med. size apples and am SO happy!!!

Very good!  I didn't have any problem with it hardening too fast or it being too sticky.  If it's too sticky it wasn't done boiling.  Also I would recommend adding the food coloring before it's done.  You're on a time-crunch at that point.  This was actually really fun to make!  I had a blast dropping the candy into water and then eating the crunchy strings.  This will be a family tradition!  Thanks!

LOVED this recipe. Plenty of flavor. I also made this recipe to the "T" and turned out great. Made 2 batches one this way & the 2nd one I added some cinnamon flavoring. YUMMY!! I sprinkled some powdered sugar on bottom of wax paper to have it come off better. Worked pretty good for me... To the haters, stop being so rude & mean to people when they are just sharing a recipe. If you didnt like it, say "it wasnt for me, thanx anyway". Didn't you grow up to have manners & be nice to people??? This recipe is deffinetly a keeper. Thanks for sharing Jonar!! .... Tim & family

loved it. cooked sugar at 4 on electric stove. no higher, turned down to 2-3 at 275 on thermometer. was ready in about 5 minutes after that. put pot into pan of hot water that i had ready, dipped apples. only did 6, rest of candy was to hard to roll by then. I added about 3 drops of pure mint/peppermint extract and the 16 or so drops of the red food colouring. candy is crisp and slightly minty and very good. used couple grannies and some royal gala. apples now resting. perfect day for it. thanks.

I'll have to make these again. My first batch turned out gooey and the candy never fully hardened. I cooked it for over 45 minutes and since it was my first timewashed unsure what I was looking for. I kept doing the cold water test and it looked fine enough so i dipped the apples. It wasn't until AFTER I dipped all the apples and didn't see it "hardening fast" as other commenters had mentioned I figured maybe it needed to cook a little longer. I turned it back on and cooked it some more (15m) & didn't see much change so I decided to give up. By the time I decided to dump the stuff sure enough it hardened right in my pot. :-/ So I was stuck with a bunch of gooey apples. I think the recipe was good? But the instructions were a bit vague for first time makers. I didn't know about not stirring it after the  mixture started to boil either...the recipe should've mentioned that. Overall I give the recipe 4 stars (it needed more food coloring for that beautiful red I was looking for and the taste was missing something not sure what). And 2 stars on instructions. I think after u get the process down right it'll be a good recipe overall. I'll try again tmrw!

I didn't have a thermometer so I just made sure to stay close to the pot. Once it started to thicken visually I tried dropping a little into a cup of cold water. I did this a few times a few minutes apart until it hardened in the water. DO NOT USE KOOLAID!!! I tried it despite somebody elses warnings. It was burnt tasting and cough syrupy. But when I tried it again without it it turned out GREAT. I used green food coloring with granny smith apples. Looked fantastic and tasted perfect!

I acutally made these one Halloween and had trick or treaters come back again this year requesting them!  I do find however that I could only make half of the apples that the recipe says it makes before I ran out of candy coating and I did use medium apples.  They set VERY quickly so if you're going to roll them in anything for a coating it must be done super quickly or it's too late.

These are very good. I didn't think the candy hardened up too fast like other reviewers mentioned. I doubled the recipe and was able to coat 25 apples for my son's birthday party tomorrow.

I tried this recipe for halloween to give out to the neighborhood kids that we know, and they didn't turn out as well as I hoped.  I found that even when I got the candy to the right temp.  it still was not  thick enough.  I ended up making a double batch and double coating, although this still did not make up for it.  I think I will just keep searching for the perfect fair type candy apple recipe.

I've been making candy for years now, including peanut brittle and candy apples....the most reliable way of cooking candy is to use a candy thermometer. You need to work fast so have all your ingredients and utensils close at hand. Make sure apples have been washed thoroughly to remove wax; wash with tepid soapy water, rinse and dry completely. If not, candy will not stick to them. Next, you need to stir sugar mixture constantly until it dissolves and comes to a boil; after that, you can leave it alone but stirring it occasionally doesn't change the outcome. Watch your thermometer closely; the first time I made candy apples, I cooked to hard crack (300 degrees) but found its way too hard...like teeth breaking hard. Now I cook to just above soft crack which is 280-290 degrees; so I mean cook to like 285. Much more edible at that temp. but thats personal preference. You can add any extract flavours you like; found at most specialty or bulk stores. Finally, once you reach the crack stage your looking for, do immerse the pot in a large pan of boiling water to keep the candy hot enough to work with until your done dipping. I just use my kitchen sink! I give these out at Halloween...the first 30 kids anyway.

Note: the mixture is ready when a drop of mixture is dropped into cold water and it hardens . It's not a recipe you can rush nor leave unattended for a long period of time. Another hint: DO NOT STIR MIXTURE.

Loved the recipe, but used half a pack of cherry kool aid instead of food colouring and found it tastes exactly like the fair! Had some left over and made lollipops. =)

I followed the directions and the glaze never dried on the apples, it just dripped off.  I washed any wax off the apples first and dried them thoroughly but the glaze wouldn't stick.

I didn't find that these apples were as tasty as the ones you can get at the fair and I didn't find them to be worth the trouble. I also suggest doubling the recipe because I only had enough for half and putting it in a warm bowl of water as someone suggested is a must !

I added 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon for a little added flavour. Be prepared to wait a while for the mixture to get to the hard crack stage. If you turn up the heat too high it will burn so be patient.

Great recipe! Like others said, a good candy thermometer is a must! I have a digital one that works like a charm. The apples must be thoroughly washed and dried prior to using. The ability to work quickly is a must as it does harden easily but softens if you put it back on the stove. I added a bit of Lorann Oils raspberry flavouring and they were amazing! This is now my go to candy apple recipe!

My other added 1/4 cup of cinnamon heart candy. Then you don't need food coloring and you have a touch of cinnamon flavor.

Came out great, HOWEVER... before removing from heat, start swirling the apples in the mixture while the sugar mix is still warm. If the sugar cools it will harden immediately and you will end up with a gooey mess that wont stick to your apples.

Wow! I have never made candy apples before,and they came out perfect when i cookedto 300 degrees. The coating tastes like cotton candy,but not too sweet. yum. The only thing, is it does set extremely fast! I definitely recommend using another pot of boiling water underneath to keep it from seizing up before you get your apples done. My last couple apples have big globs of thick sugar on some sides, and strings of sugar, but they still taste great, but not as perfect looking as the first 6 looked while it was still hot,een though i dipped fast. I added the food coloring at the hard ball stage and let the boiling mix it in on its own, and used 14 drops as someone else suggested. And if you have extra mixture, scrape it out with a silicone spatula onto the parchment and break it up into hard candy. Definitely will make again. Wonderful.

Directions are very unclear. I have made candy before and it wasn't as unclear as this. I really don't think you should have this on med/high heat i think it should be lower. once it hit 200 degrees it instantly burns because the pot is too hot. This recipe needs to be more clear.

Great Recipe. I’ve read some of the reviews commenting on the recipe’s inability to harden. The same thing happened to me. The problem was quickly rectified by heating the mixture longer. The problem was my thermometer stopped reading at 240 degrees. Also, the original mixture failed the “cold water test”. Another 10 minutes on the stove then the transition occurred rapidly.

Great candy crackle! So simple to make.  Just remember to boil at medium-high heat without stirring.  Mines took about 25 minutes after the candy started to boil in order to get the precise cracked stage.

I tweaked this recipe. This way doesn’t suit me best so the way I did made it great! Taste exactly like my favorite candy shop. I also added some things to it for a little pop of flavor

The only change I made was to add some cinnamon oil. If you have difficulty with the candy not sticking to the apples, the candy might be too hot. Let it cool for a minute then try. It will start to thicken just a bit when it's ready.

This is really a great and simple recipe. I read the previous reviews and followed all extra added tips. You must make sure you use a candy thermometer. It takes about 40 minutes of boiled to reach the proper temperature. I would advise to do the cold water test of the mixture prior to dipping. I tried to add Koop-aid to flavor my candy, it is not advisable to add any flavors while mixture is boiled., it changes and becomes bitter. I added color at very end and made beautiful and tasty Marbled Candy Apples.

Made this twice. It turned out great both times. Made exactly the first time no problems. Added strawberry extract as an experiment the second time ... Don't do it. Lol! Thanks for the recipe!

I followed this recipe to a T and everything went great until I turned my back for one second and the sugar mixture went from 295° to 330° in a matter of seconds!  I should've waited for the mixture to stop bubbling before I started dipping the apples, and that's the reason why my apples had so many bubbles in the coating. Also, you really have to work fast because this stuff cools VERY quickly!!!!!  They tasted good, but I think next time I'm going to add cinnamon extract or cherry flavoring. With this recipe, the only flavor was "sugar", which wasn't bad either.  Lastly, I think it needs more red food coloring if your apples are not red.  I used small Fuji apples that were red and green, and the food coloring didn't even come close to covering the green parts.

I made these for a fundraiser and they were a hit! I am glad that I did read some of the comments before I started. I did NOT stir after it started to boil. I am making these again today. =)

Recipe went fine. I recommend to anyone not to wait until it is fully brittle, and actually dip the apples a bit before when it is hard when put in water, but not brittle as it hardens quite fast. We made ours blue instead of red because we had green apple and it made a pretty turquoise color. We also added a BIT of cinnamon but I think cherry juice would work for adding a bit of extra flavoring.

Watch the temp really close once it reaches soft ball! Escalates very slowly until then, and very quickly to hard crack after that. Added cinnamon extract to replicate the kind boyfriend craves from Knotts Berry Farms.

So easy to do and taste great! Directions are clear... Since you don't normally stir many things once they boil. Love it and will definitely use it again

I substituted 4 cups of "Fire Sticks" candy for the sugar and corn syrup. The medium sized apples were well covered and came with a very pleasant "kick" of cinnamon flavor. The red color was perfect.

Great recipe,the only thing is you need to work fast or candied mixture starts to cool to fast before you finish the last few apples also need to add more than 8 drops of food coloring. You can adjust this to your preference.

Ok recipe but sometimes it doesn't make enough to cover all the apples.  The Kool-Aid flavoring isn't a good idea.  I used various candy oils to flavor them and also tried the candy red hots.
