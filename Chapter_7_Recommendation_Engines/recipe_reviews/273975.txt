You can definitely taste the bourbon.  Batter looked very thin when it was mixed up and popped into the oven.  I cut into it when it was warm, so it kind of crumbled apart when I served it from the pan.  Hopeful that some more cooling will get these to set a bit better - if not, will add a bit more flour next time .. and there will totally be a next time!

You canâ€™t beat a basic brownie, and adding bourbon only enhances the taste. I did choose to add some melted chocolate chips on top - just a personal preference. This is a great recipe for dessert. To splurge for guests,  top with ice cream, hot fudge, caramel sauce and buttered toasted pecans. Yum!
