This was really good, I added some extra hot salsa to the marinade and it was great.  Next time I will use two taco seasonings as one did not go very far...great with mexican rice and beans.

THIS WAS REALLY TASTY..THE ONLY THING I MIGHT CHANGE IS TO ADD SOME CAYENNE PEPPER OR HOT SAUCE TO THE MIXTURE TO GIVE IT A LITTLE MORE KICK.
