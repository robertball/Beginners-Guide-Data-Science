I made this using a pillsbury pizza crust. Didn't have black tea, subbed lime juice. Also couldn't find red chile pepper so I put chile garlic paste in the sauce. This was FANTASTIC!

This has potential, but it is really, really dry.  It needs something moist in the topping, I think.  Not sure what else to add... The peanut butter sauce is "okay", but it was pretty runny.  Is the tea absolutely necessary?  I heated up the sauce a bit to just thicken it so that it wouldn't just run off the crust.

Delicious!  I made the base and it was a very soft dough. With the sauce, I omitted the Black Tea (but added garlic) and just stirred the ingredients to make a paste. I doubled the sauce and there was barely enough to cover the 2 bases so would triple it next time. Didn't add the paprika to the topping & don't think it's really needed. Overall this was a lovely, light pizza with a beautiful Asian flavour. Will be making again.

I have made this pizza many times before and actually make the crust for all of my pizza recipes. It turns out excellent. The only think I do different is add a little hot sauce to the sauce mix to make it spicier since my husband and I both like heat. I love this recipe!

This is exactly what I was hoping for! Simply divine. I didn't make the crust, however. I used refridgerated pizza dough. Other reviewers said the sauce was runny, so I omitted the black tea and chili oil. Instead I added Garlic Chili Sauce (Asain aisle in the market) to add some heat. I didn't use the chili pepper, but sliced a red bell pepper instead. This was fantastic, not to mention healthy, and pretty to look at. The next day, after my boyfriend tried it, he said it was AMAZING! It's always a treat when he gives something I make such a compliment!

THis was pretty good, I didnt make the pizza crust, I used boboli, since i had no time, but followed the recipe exactly other than that. However i didnt have chili oil, but thanks to my AR foodie friends from the exchange, i was able to make some. It definately is a great addition to this pizza.  This is actually my first time trying something "thai style" and I was happy with it. It was different than what im used to, but it was good

i have not tried this recipe as i have my own...however to defeat the dryness that some reviewers were talking about, i usually add fresh beansprouts and steamed broccoli during the last 5-7 minutes of cooking. also add a very thin layer of cheese over the sprouts and broccoli

I made this with a whole wheat crust and had to use red pepper flakes instead of a chopped pepper.  Loved how hot it was.  We will certainly make it again.

I kinda changed this...alot.  I made my own crust (I like whole wheat) then just mixed the ginger, peanut butter, soya sauce, and oil together for the sauce.  I drizzled the finished pizza with a little honesy and sprkinkled the chili peppers on top. It was delicious!

We followed the recipe with one exception, we pre cooked the dough for about 10 minutes.
The dough was on the dry side, but the flavors are fantastic.  We viewed the crust as just a vessel to carry the wonderful toppings.

The pizza dough is the same that I use for other recipes, but I typically don't let it raise. Make sure to roll it out thinner than you think because it puffs up a lot during baking. I also recommend baking the crust for 5 minutes before adding the sauce and toppings. I made the sauce as directed and doubled it. It was delicious, but I will probably not double the tea next time.

This pizza was delicious! I made it exactly as is (dropped the serving down to 4 so that is was a more fitting size for myself and my SO) and it came out delicious! I used peanut butter I had made the day before and I cooked this in a cast iron skillet (place skillet in over to heat up while over preheats, take out, grease and sprinkle corn meal, then place in the dough and topping and cook for 20 minutes). I also added the carrots and cilantro to the pizza when it came out and it was amazing. The flavor was good, it had just the right amount of spice (I may have used a tad more chili oil than the recipe calls for but we like spice) and the crust was wonderful. We will be making this again in the near future, thanks for sharing!

Yum!  A bit of work, but worth it!  I found the chicken mixture salty - I'll cut the salt by half or more next time.  I added 1-2 tsp of sesame oil to the "pizza sauce", subbed fish sauce for soy (more like Thai) and lime juice for the tea.  Added some red bell pepper to the toppings.  I used the sauce and toppings for just 1 pizza, not 2 - worked great, but I had some sauce left over.  I'll add a lil more sesame oil and mix with pasta  for sesame noodles (very similar recipe).

I didn't have any of the veggies for this, so I just made a chicken pizza.  I didn't measure out the pb and I think I went way overboard.  I seem to have made a large amount of sauce and it wasn't runny at all!  I used sweet chili sauce instead of chili oil bc I don't have any.  I added garlic powder and onion powder.  The crust is very simple and although isn't the best I've ever made, it's decent for such a flavorful pizza like this.  I baked for 30 minutes instead of 20.  Bf wasn't too impressed with it.  He kept saying it was "weird".  I thought it was good, if a bit too peanut buttery--but I really do think I added too much.  Thanks for the recipe!

Really good, but made some changes. I skipped the chili oil and cilantro and forgot the ginger! I did use a pre-made crust and added yellow peppers. It really was good, I will keep making this as everyone loved it even my 1 yr old!

I suddenly found myself making this when I discovered I didn't have any tomato sauce. I had already made my pizza crust, so I ad-libbed my way through this recipe. I had no chicken breast, so I made a vegetarian version using mushrooms. The sauce looked runny, so I thickened it by mixing in finely grated mozzarella, and then topped it with a little extra mozzarella once I had all the toppings in place. My husband thought it was great, and he wants me to make it again. I'll have to try it with chicken.

The cooking temperature should have been increased to 400 or 425.  The 350 temp and 20 minute cooking time dried the toppings, a quicker cooking time should have been used.

Also, this recipe is for 2 pizzas which is good if you have a large group to feed.  

Overall a tasty pizza I would make again.

This pizza is AMAZING! It's the perfect way to quench Thai food cravings. I never have  chili oil and just use red pepper flakes instead to give the sauce some kick.

We have enjoyed this recipe many times. We like to bake it on the grill. I double the peanut adding smoked hatch chilies when they are on hand. I place the ingredients for the crust in the bread maker and use the dough setting. Sometimes I make a side sauce of  Sriracha, soy, and hoisin for dipping the crust.

This was….AMAZING! It had a bit of preparation time but was totally worth it! This is a really awesome pizza recipe which uses a really interesting sauce concept. It is made by blending peanut butter, tea, rice vinegar, soy sauce, chili garlic sauce, ginger, and honey. I used chili garlic sauce in place of the chili oil because I was out. Sliced red pepper was used in place of the red chili pepper because it was all I had. It then gets toppings consisting of chicken, toasted sesame seeds, paprika, red pepper, green onions, and mozzarella cheese. Garnish it with cilantro and carrots. Epic…5 stars and added to my personal recipes hall of fame! Top with Sriracha...

This was a great recipe with a lot of flavor.  I actually marinated the chicken breast in garlic, lemongrass, ginger,salt and a little vegetable oil.  I didn't have chili oil so I tried to improvise by adding a little chili powder into sesame oil.  It worked, but I'll try it the other way in the future.  I topped it with shredded carrots, cilantro, and squeezed lime juice on my slice.  Super duper!  I think a sprinkling of chopped toasted peanuts would be spectacular! Maybe next time!

This has a very unique flavor.  I kind of liked it, but DH did not enjoy it at all.  He did not find the combination of flavors at all pleasing.  It takes a significant amount of time to make, so I won't be trying it again.  The dough turned out well, however, so I may use that part of the recipe for a traditional pizza.

awesome - for sauce left out black tea and chili oil (per other reviewers and didn't have any chili oil) - sauce was more of a paste without those 2 ingredients - used all the sauce on one pizza, chicken, toasted sesame seeds, carrots, Vidalia onions, baby spinach leaves, red bell pepper slices on half and string cheese (didn't have regular Mozzarella available) - only thing I'd do different is use regular Mozzarella maybe mix in some Jack or Provalone cheese & add some red pepper flakes or a little chili paste - also used similar pizza crust recipe but not this one - will definitely make again.

Awesome recipe! Left out the black tea, salt (soy sauce plenty) and cilantro, substituted parsley, and some thinly sliced green pepper lemon, and a pizza crust packet. Excellent!
