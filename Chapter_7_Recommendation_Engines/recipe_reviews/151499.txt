This recipe is so easy and great tasting!  It was my first attemp to make flan and it was just like the restaraunts make!  Be sure to make night before and put in refrigerator and do not turn out until ready to serve!  Fantastic appearance and wow good tasting. I Made this for a Brunch and was a great success!!

Just tried this last night at my taco party.  It was perfect!!!  I used a caramel topping instead of butterscotch and low-fat cream cheese.  Plus I put a bit more vanilla in it.  Can't wait to try it in other flavors
