Quinoa novices but trying to eat healthy grains more. This was a good introduction. Complex but subtle taste. I quartered grape tomatoes because I had extra-BOGO week at the store. I think 2 tsp basil+ 2 tsp Italian was overkill and will opt for 2 tsp total.

This turned out super yummy! Best served fresh or soon after adding the dressing. Will vertically be making this yummy dish again soon.

Substituted frozen peas for the Lima beans. Good side salad. Taste as you add the dressing, the balsamic flavoring was a little much.
