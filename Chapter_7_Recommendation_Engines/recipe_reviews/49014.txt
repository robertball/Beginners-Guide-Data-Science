Do note--if you expect any kind of sauce, don't.  I forgot that Szechuan Chicken usually doesn't come with sauce. When I selected this recipe, I expected something along the lines of Kung Pao Chicken, which usually comes with sauce.  The chicken had an exceptionally good flavor and served with rice, is a definite winner.

Overall, this is a good recipe.  I made some changes to this recipe to suit my taste.  Reduce the amount of soysauce to 2 TSP, and  add 1/2 TSP directly to the meat.  Add 1 more tsp of sugar to balance the flavor.  Add a dash of five spice powder or ginger to give it authenticity.  I tried the recipe with beef, and it turned out good.  This is definitely a keeper.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Every time I make this recipe, it turns out fantastic and people love it.  The prep time has made it take over an hour before, depending on how many vegetables I chop up and mix in (e.g. carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, bell pepper, mushroom, green onion) or if I need to de-bone the meat.  I would also suggest adding peanuts to the sauce.  Using the original recipe, i.e. boneless skinless meat and not chopping any veggies, this is superfast and easy.  When cooking the rice, I like to add a little soy sauce and/or Szechuan seasoning to the rice water for flavor.

Seems to me that some of these recipes just "run together." Its a  "different recipe" but the same flavor. THIS recipe is great in that it is unique in flavor, not to mention it tastes great :) It is very fast and it is versatile. That being said, double up the sauce! :) Its great with pork or beef too!

I made this last night, but I adjusted the recipe to suit my family's tastes.  I only used 3 tblsp soy sauce.  To make up for the liquid, I added 1 tblsp Chinese cooking wine,(sherry would work too,) and also 1 tblsp sesami oil. I increased the amount of cayenne pepper to 1/4 tsp and only used one green onion.  Also, I added that green onion during the last few minutes of cooking since my family is not fond of the raw onion taste.  The family loved this dish and I'll make it again.

Great Recipe! Super easy, I found the preptime was even less than stated, I cook rice for 20 minutes, and I did all the prep work and cooked it and it was ready right as the rice was.  I used rice vinegar instead, very tasty.

I added sesame seeds and a little extra cayenne pepper, and it was perfect, especially served with veggies over steamed white rice.  Exactly what I was hoping for.  Thanks!

WOW, this is to die for!  It did however take me much longer than 10 mins, but I tripled the recipe...and I used pork loin instead of chicken.  I would suggest that you use a deep fryer to do the frying.  It stuck to my pan and burned, the cornstarch I am guessing.  Then after the meat is fried add the garlic and other ingredients.  I also only put in a dash of the pepper as my youngest and I really do mix well with alot of heat.  I will most definitely be using this recipe over and over again.  Thank you so much for sharing.

Very special and tasty! Served over rice, of course. The amount of sugar is missing - I only used 1/2 tsp. but could have used more. Thanks for this recipe.

Good base recipe. Too salty and bland as written, but much better with added 1/4 t. ginger, decreased soy sauce to 3 T. low sodium, and increase water to 1 c. to make a sauce. I also added broccoli, which worked very well. Served 2 very hungry people with 2 c. (dry) jasmine rice. Easy to prepare in the 20 minutes the rice is simmering.

So delicious and easy. Next time I would slow down the cooking so when the sauce thickens it doesn't dry out the chicken. As when you make Chicken Marsala, you don't cook the chicken all the way so when the sauce thickens it completely cooks the chicken while keeping it moist. I also added steamed oriental vegetables and orzo (I was out of rice). My boyfriend loved it!

Good recipe.  The only changes I made was I used garlic vinegar, no sugar, and broth instead of water. And I used brown rice. A good filling meal.

Wow... this was a lot better than I expected it to be!  I must say, I did make a few changes based on reviews that it was too salty even with the low-sodium soy sauce.  I only used 3 chicken breasts and for the sauce, I used 3 Tbsp of low-sodium soy sauce, 1 Tbsp of Teryaki sauce, one Tbsp of sherry, 1.5 Tbsp of white wine vinegar, 1/4 cup of water, 1 tsp of sugar, a couple shakes of ground ginger and mixed in the garlic with the sauce, as I think it would have burned and become bitter if cooked with the chicken.  I used about 1/3 tsp of cayenne as well and a quick drizzle of sesame oil.  This was tender and delicious over brown rice with broiled asparagus that was brushed with a little sesame oil and sprinkled with sesame seeds.

For as simple as this recipe is to make, This is full of flavor and great with rice.   Double the sauce.  I also added broccoli florets that I microwaved before adding at the end.

Was actually looking for a pork chop recipe when I came across this and decided to try it with boneless chops.  I cut them up as directed, doubled the sauce & used rice vinegar (didn't have white wine vinegar).  It was good!

We really enjoyed this. I will use a different soy sauce next time and maybe peanut oil. I halved the recipe but wished I had not halved the sauce. Definately good but has room to play. Thanks for sharing. Will be making it again soon.

I really loved this dish, as did my family. I did not give it 5 stars because of the changes I felt it needed. However, I am very excited on how well this recipe does with adaptations. Firstly, I added salt and pepper to the cornstarch. Secondly, I used rice wine vinegar due to the fact that I was out of white wine vinegar. Thirdly, after it was all made and was at its final phase in cooking, I tasted it and felt it was a bit bland, so I added honey to taste. I just felt that what I had ended up with needed the sweetness. It was PERFECT. I suggest trying it this way however, be sure to add the honey slowly and taste often. Next time I will plan this ahead and put some red chilies in there to cook with it. I served it over Jasmine Rice (my favorite) steamed using chicken stock and a pat of margarine, and a side of broccoli. Yummy.

This was ok. Very salty. I even cut back on the soy sauce and added extra water. The chicken seemed mushy to me. I did add some red and yellow peppers which made it a little better. I would make it again but change some things.

I didn't think this was anywhere near as spicy as the szechuan chicken you get in restaurants. It was pretty easy to make, but not a keeper in our house.

Made this as directed without the cayenne as I had young children eating.  Without the cayenne, it needed a little something to perk it up (black/red pepper maybe?) but that was all on me.  Hubby really liked it so I'm sure this will be made again and again on the nights I'm craving takeout.  Thank you for sharing!

For not salting this dish at all and using low-sodium soy sauce, I still found it too salty. It definitely needed something to offset the salty of the soy sauce.

Good base recipe.  Added veggies (red pepper, borccoli, mushrooms) and some sriracha sauce for heat.  I used one fresh cayenne pepper which must not have been as spicy as I expected.  Doubled the liquid ingredients since I added veggies.  Pretty quick and tasty.

Love this recipe!! It is so super easy and tastes so good. It has become a regular at our house. We eat a lot of chicken. The only thing I can suggest is to definitally use "low sodium" soy sauce, and DO NOT substitute aminos for the soy sauce... you will feel like you are licking a salt block!!! Excellent recipe. Thanks!

Pretty good.  Quite salty, though.  Might use low sodium soy next time.  We prefer a little more "sweet" in our stir fry.  Could easily adjust with brown sugar or honey.

I used a leftover rotesserie chicken and used a combo of flour and cornstarch. The chicken was juicy and cripsy.  The sauce was okay....maybe ginger and actual Chinese Szechaun peppers would add more flavor.  My husband liked it more than I did.  I will likely look for a General Tso's sauce to put over the yummy cripsy chicken.

It was really good but salty for our liking even with the reduced sodium soy sauce. Maybe next time we will use less soy sauce and see how that works. It is definitely a keeper.

Really nothing special, the meat lacked flavor (seasoning), I added ginger to it but didn't really give it that "full flavor" however my family ate it up. Will try again but will add season to the meat before coating with cornstarch.

FANTASTIC!!!! 

All I did differently was DOUBLE the sauce, and add in lots of veggies:  broccoli, snap peas, green peppers, anything would work.  

The chicken was SUPER tender, and the flavor was excellent!  This is going into the rotation of regular recipes I make.

Delicious!  I read other reviews and I was worried about the salt factor, but I tripled the sauce and didn't find it too salty at all.  I didn't put quite as much sugar as the recipe called for because I didn't want the sauce too sweet.  I am not wild about cayenne pepper so for a bit of spice I added a few teaspoons of sweet chili sauce and that gave it just the right amount of spice.  We ate it over instant white rice and it was delicious.  I did find that our cooking time was significantly longer than the recipe states, but it was totally worth it.

Soo good! I made a few changes-kept the sauce exactly the same-and it was AMAZING!! I changed the chicken to beef, added two carrots and 2 broccoli stalks. Next time I'll add some water chestnuts too...ooh, was it amazing! This is going on my meal plan menu, hands down! Thank you!

I chose to make this because it was a weeknight and I needed something quick. I wanted to make it a full meal, so I added red and green peppers, green beans, mushrooms and julienned carrots. I stir fried them first and then removed them from the pan to cook the chicken and added them back when the chicken was just about finished. I also added a little fresh ginger and 1 more tsp of sugar to the chicken. Finally, because I find the brand of soy sauce I use to be strong, I decided to cut it in half and add more if it needed it (it didn't) .To say this was delicious would be a gross understatement. It is phenomenal!

In search of a simple and good Chicken Szechuan recipe, I came across this one.  All I can is - OMG this is FANTASTIC!  My husband really enjoyed it and gobbled up the majority of the 2 servings I made - I guess he thought it was fantastic too.  ;)  The only thing I changed is that I added brocolli and shredded carrots towards the end of the recipe.  I will DEFINITELY make this one again.  I think next time I will add a fresh red pepper.  Thanks PUSATERI for posting!  =)  I also agree with some of the postings, it's not a 10 minute recipe - but that's OK, it doesn't take long to make.

I agree it took longer than 10 minutes, but it was worth it.  I used flour because I didn't have corn starch.  It was a little salty, will probably reduce soy sauce next time.  It was very moist and tasty over rice, we will be making this again.

This is one of my favorite quick and easy recipes. I always add with a bag of frozen stir fry veggies to the chicken instead of serving it over rice.  If you do it that way you can even use less chicken. Two large chicken breasts are enough for a satisfying meal.

Very strong taste - too salty or maybe too much garlic- I saw that the instructions say to add sugar but it wasn't listed with the ingredients. Maybe this would have made a difference.

This recipe has been sitting in my recipe box for over a year and I finally got around to trying.  Boy, am I glad I did!  This was so quick and easy to put together and tasted amazing.  I am not a good cook of international cuisine, and while this may not necessarily be considered "authentic" (although, how do I know what authentic is?!) it sure was easy to prepare and had that chinese taste I was hoping for.  I will definitely make this again!

This was good, after I changed it a bit...I thought it was sooo salty and kinda bitter. I always cook my chicken in the skillet with small amt olive oil and chicken seas. prepare sauce stovetop separate pan. I tried adding more sugar, still bitter, so in the end I actually had to add about 1/4 c honey to balance flavor. Added some red pepper flakes for a little spice....really good after that. Maybe I just like sauce a bit sweeter, but even after honey this sauce was so bitter before it helped alot and wasn't even that sweet.

I made a few adjustments after reading most of the reviews and the end result was delicious!  I used 6 cloves of garlic just because we LOVE garlic.  Also added two julienned carrots to the chicken/garlic. I mixed 3 tablespoons soy sauce, 2 tablespoons rice vinager, 1/2 cup water and 1 tablespoon sugar in a small bowl and added it to the chicken mix.  For the last few minutes of cooking I added 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger and the green onion.  It was a big hit!

I make this recipe all the time now!  I skip the cornstarch, I find I never need it. In a separate pan, I add a couple splashes of chicken broth, and slice up red peppers and zucchini thinly and simmer until they're tender. If I have bok choy or bean sprouts on hand I'll toss them in too. I like to put the chicken and veggies over a bed of brown rice or quinoa (cooked in 1/2 water and 1/2 chicken broth), or I mix it all up with some steamed noodles. It's a great stir fry.  I also tend to make a little extra sauce. This is my favorite recipe! It's very versatile and you can adjust it to how you want; I like to add a little extra cayenne, and sometimes some ginger powder to sauce.

As suggested, I doubled the sauce. I didn't have green onions, so I used a little bit of sweet onion.  Also, I used rice vinegar.  Because I am slow at food prep, this took the full 40 minute cooking time for the rice.

This is delicious.  It is not terribly hot, so never fear about adding the recommended cayenne.  I served it with brown rice that had been flavored with soy sauce.

Really good! We enjoyed this recipe, even though I omitted the cayenne just because I was serving it to my toddlers- and I didn't have green onions- but this is something I'd make again :)

Okay, I had to time myself to see if this really took ten minutes. I didn't have any of the ingredients out yet or prepped. I started mincing the garlic and chopping the green onion and the garlic alone took me five minutes to mince 4 cloves. I also had to add on extra minutes because I like chicken well cooked and I do tend to clean as I go. I did use sharp scissors to cut everything I could and that did save some time. Next time I want to try minced garlic in a jar. The whole meal took 32 minutes, which is still pretty darn quick for a decent hot meal. Plus, it was done when my rice I had going in the rice cooker was finished. I have never eaten Szechuan chicken, so I have nothing to compare this to, but this tasted pretty good. I will probably make this again, but it seems like it is missing something. I will have to figure out what that is?

This was very easy and very tasty.  It is definitely a do-over.  I added some sliced squash and onions that I had.

I'm sorry, we found this lacking in flavor.  It was easy.  Maybe we could add more spices next time.  Thanks anyway.

Excellent! I doubled the recipe, used chicken thighs instead of breasts, I added broccoli & sliced mushrooms approximately 5 minutes before the green onions. I will make this again and again!

Great flavor, super easy to make. I used chicken strips, just to save time and I only had real onion, which was fine, but perhaps not as authentic. I will make this again. So easy, so quick, and it would be an impressive dish to serve for guests.

Delicious. Marinate the chicken in a bag of  cornstarch for at least 2-3 hrs. Deep fry the chicken. triple the original sauce ingredients, double the sugar, To the sauce add 1 tbs ginger, stir every few min with each added ingredient. Add carrots 1st they take longer to cook, then the deep fried chicken, followed shortly after all at once; brocolli, onion, green pepper, sugar snap peas. Just before serving stir in the green onion. What a delight

It was quick and excellent.  I would reduce the amount of soy sauce to 3 tablespoons next time, as I felt it was a tad salty.  Definitely going in my recipe collection!  Thank you!

This was very good, but I changed a few things, so I couldn't rate this a 5, but good base recipe.  I used chicken instead of beef. I used 1/4 cup low sodium soy sauce and 3/4 cup water and added one beef boulion cube.  then I used about 3 tbl spoons of brown sugar, added about 2 cups of broccoli and used no onions.  Then in the end I added a mixture of 2 tbl spoons water with 1 tbl spoon corn starch then poured it into the chicken, broccoli and sauce to thicken it up a bit.  Served with white rice.  Was absolutely wonderful!

The flavor has way too much soy sauce in it. It needs more sugar added or less soy sauce.

I recommend giving this recipe a try if you are serving it over a seasoned rice stir fry, since it has no sauce of its own. I used some dried Annaheim chile's from my garden instread of cayenne pepper, otherwise followed the recipe exactly and would make it again.  Nice to be able to make it yourself and control the fat content.

Great base recipe that you can do so much with!  It was a little bland for my taste, so i added more garlic, a little black pepper, chili paste, and a little honey.  (the honey tied it all together!) I think next time i will use pineapple or orange juice instead of water just for a little more flavor!  Thanks!

Made this tonight for a quick dinner to feed my hubby and two toddlers. Based on reviews doubled the sauce... I didnt get to eat right away so when I heated it up twenty mins later I thought it reduced a little too much and was kind of salty even being served over buttery rice. My hubs said he liked it right away though... Next time i may just add a little chicken stock when reheating to cut the salty! Awesome quick meal though

Took a lot longer than ten minutes to cook! Very good though and came out delicious. Added snap peas, water chestnuts and peanuts to round out the meal. I'm not a great chef but this came out exactly right!

Very very yummy.  I used flour instead of cornstarch and 4-5 tablespoons of oil in the wok (and then drained the cooked chicken). The mixture of the garlic in the oil worked well and the scallions were good. I left out the cayenne pepper.

A+. Big hit at the dinner table. Note: you may want to use 2 or 3 times the amt of veg oil to fry the chicken and garlic- as the proportion of meat to oil is not enouh and the chicken cannot cook thoroughly. Deslih, will make again!

This was very good!  I made it as written, but a couple of suggestions though: increase oil to 2-3 tbsp, the cornstarch on the chicken sucks it up pretty quick.  Reduce the soy sauce to 3 tbps, it is very overpowering, and then increase the amount of sugar and green onions.  Thanks for the recipe, it is a keeper!

This recipe turned out great, my husband thought it was delicious! Tasted like Chinese from a restaurant, except better. The sauce was really good too.

This gets three stars, because it was as fast and easy and advertised, but the taste just wasn't there.  I hate giving bad reviews, but this tasted like cafeteria food.  Salty and bland.  Sorry.

This recipe was really good - I didn't have white wine vinegar - just white vinegar and it still tasted great - I did add a bag of birdseye asian style vegetables and 1/4 to 1/2 cup of lightly salted peanuts - it was fabulous - definitely a keeper and we'll be making this again!

Maybe more like 25 minutes, but still, I have no complaints!  This was a really good easy recipe.  I did add some ground ginger to the cornstarch before coating the chicken, and I threw in some stir fry veggies to bulk it out a little.  Instead of rice, I used Chinese noodles which have a finer texture than spaghetti noodles and make it more authentically Asian.

Really yummy!

Holy Soy!  This was really heavy on the Soy taste and I even reduced the amount by half after reading the reviews.  I don't think I'll be making this again any time soon.  I thought it was only "okay".  But my boyfriend had no problem taking the leftovers for lunch today, so I guess it was a hit with him!

Very tasty and easy... I used chili flakes instead of cayenne which really kicked it up a notch. Definitely needs a little more sweetness - soy sauce is very strong. I wonder if adding pineapple chunks would be good?

This was good--I added 1/2 a head of broccoli when I added the green onions & instead of serving over rice, I boiled some udon noodles for about 30 seconds & then threw those in with the rest of the mixture and let that cook for about 2 more minutes before serving.  I also had to add about another 1-1 1/2 cups of water.  The noodles made this recipe very rich!

I wasn't impressed with this recipe at all. I will say, it looked pretty, but the soy sauce was WAY too overpowering, and the chicken tasted bitter. I even tried adding a little more sugar, but it still tasted like it had soaked in vinegar and soy sauce. I definitely won't be making this again.

My 9-yr old son found this recipe three years ago, and made it for us by himself. It was delicious! It maybe needs a little more sauce, so you might want to adjust that part, but we have been making it as written ever since. One of our favorite suppers! Sometimes we add broccoli florets to the chicken for variation.

Great recipe!  It tastes quite similar to P.F. Chang's kung pao.  I didn't have white wine vinegar, so I substitued rice wine vinegar and also threw in a tablespoon of white wine.  I added some chopped red, green and yellow peppers and peanuts when stir frying (which helped sweeten the sauce a little) and it was great.  I will be making this frequently!

I barely ever write reviews, but this chicken was almost inedible. It was incredibly salty from the soy sauce, and that was all you could taste. My 7 year old son absolutely loved the chicken, though. Probably because he loves soy sauce so much he periodically asks if he can drink it from the bottle (obviously we don't let him). The only positive thing about the chicken was the texture, which was really good. 

**edit**
Just went back to look over the recipe, and I noticed it said low sodium soy sauce. Maybe that would have made a difference.

I make this dish often, as it is simple to make and my whole family eats it well. I ALWAYS add ginger and shredded carrot, and have added other veggies I have on hand, and it is still very good.  I hate to only give it a 4 star, but the addition of ginger and carrots, in my opinion, make it a 5 star rating. Be sure to use low sodium soy sauce, or it will be very salty and I do make a little extra sauce, since I put it over brown rice. I am a cook, not a chef; this recipe is very lenient to that fact that I rarely measure out ingredients, but add by sight.

This was easy and fast.  I did not use the green onions.  I think it was just a bit too salty even with the low sodium soy sauce, not terrible, but I might decrease the soy sauce next time and replace it with chicken broth or something.

Very good...fast and easy.  I lightly pounded the chicken breasts before cubing.  I didnt have green onions so I left them out.  I only used 3 TBSP soy sauce and added 1 TBSP cooking sherry.  Instead of white vinegar I used seasoned rice wine vinegar. Served over white rice.

Very quick and easy to make.  Tastes really good.  Only gave four stars because it is VERY salty.  Would definitely recommend cutting down on the soy sauce.

This was really good. My family loved it. I thought that it was a bit too salty, so I will use low sodium soy sauce next time. I also did not have any white wine vinegar, so I used apple cider vinegar.

We didn't really like this.  Was going to give this 3 stars, but we changed a couple of things, so need to rate it fairly based on that.  We found this was WAY too salty, but then again we didn't have low sodium soy sauce.  Even still I think the soy needed to be cut in half.  We also only had 'white vinega', not white wine.

This literally tasted like chicken in a thickened soy sauce. So salty with a one note flavor.

The only thing I changed was to double the sauce, and I'm glad I did. There probably wouldn't have been enough to sufficiently cover the chicken if I hadn't. Oh, and definitely use low-sodium soy sauce...I used the normal kind since that was all I had, and it was a *touch* salty. But still delicious.

Didn't expect it to be precisely like the take out I would usually get, but it worked out and I'll definitely be using this again!!

I didn't love this. It was mediocre, but has very simple ingredients most kitchens would have on hand. I followed the directions to the T other than the green onions because I didn't have any. If I were to make it again I would definetly go less on the soy sauce.

Very easy to make. Added seasonings before coating with cornstarch. Used brown rice instead of white rice. My husband loved the dish, but enjoyed it even more with terryaki sauce.

I found this recipe to taste like pure soy sauce. So I used it as a base, and added a pineapple fruit cup, and made pineapple chicken instead.

Wow! I followed this recipe pretty much to a Tee and it was such a hit with my boyfriend.  I didn't have white wine vinegar, so I used rice vinegar.  But other than that I pretty much followed the directions.  It was so good, he ate 2 big plates and was still talking about it two nights later.  I'm going to have to make it again real soon.

This was very good!  Most definitely double the sauce.  Did anyone have any problems with the corn starch not compeltely coating the chicken?  I had to triple the amount of cornstarch to really coat the chicken well.  I didn't have any cayenne pepper, so I used crushed red pepper flakes and and that gave it a little bit of a kick.  Also, based upon another review, I added a few tablespoons of honey at the end to make it just a tad sweeter.  I used a stir fry vegetable with white rice and the family really enjoyed it.

I did this as the recipe states, except doubled the sauce. (Gotta admit, I love drenching my rice in sauces!) It was quick, easy, my husband is eating his 3rd helping right this second!!

I DID add some veggies though. Snow peas, Water chestnuts, and broccoli. The chicken stayed moist, the sauce cooked to perfection, and it tastes WONDERFUL served over Jasmine Rice.

I'm not an expert on Asian cuisine, but I know what tastes good, and this dish does! Very easy to prepare. The chicken breasts I used were big as country hams, so I doubled the sauce recipe to compensate, but otherwise followed the recipe. I served this with rice and stir-fried vegetables. I will definitely prepare this dish again! Thanks for sharing it!

This was a nice simple meal to prepare on a weeknight, but we found it to be too salty.  It was ok, but unfortunately probably not something I'd make again.  I followed the recipe, and served it with rice.

INCREDIBLE! Made this tonight with white rice and steamed carrots and sugar snap peas..... It was absolutely perfect! I wish I could have made it hotter with more cayenne pepper, but everyone else said it was amazing and perfect and not to change the heat! Way better then your corner Chinese takeout! And you know exactly whats in it and can use free range organic chicken! LOVE IT!

This was awesome! My son is allergic to shellfish. This means we can't always eat out at most Asian restaurants. I made this as a special treat for him and he loved it so much that he took the rest for lunch at school. Wait till the teachers smell that!

This was great! I've never had Szechuan chicken before and I've never attempted to make asian food before, but it was awesome! My kids and husband loved it! It took a little longer to make because I used brown rice. The rice alone took 45 minutes to cook. Other than that, it was really tasty and easy to make.

Tasty but has no heat.  I added about 1/4 tsp red chili flakes and 1/2 tsp minced ginger when I added the chicken and garlic to the wok.  I think some fresh hot peppers or ground up habanero would give this that bit of kick that's lacking.

this Szechuan chicken was so easy to make- it was delicious & fast. other recipes I'd try really weren't nearly as good, the people I had over (who'd tried other creations I'd attempted of this same type) definitely preferred this one to all the others hands down.   I did make it with fried rice rather than traditional white rice though.

Pretty tasty! I followed someone else's suggestion of replacing 2 of the tbs of soy sauce to 1 tbs rice wine vinegar and 1 tbs sesame oil. I also added a small can of mushrooms and some more green onion than called for because green onions are great! Sprinkled some sesame seeds at the end and enjoyed! Thanks!

Great easy chicken dinner.  I use sesame oil, and add some frozen veggies near the end of cooking. Definitely a keeper!

This was good, but not special. And kinda dry, especially as leftovers. I will keep this as an emergency recipe, as the ingredients are ones I tend to always have on hand.

Ridiculously easy & very tasty.  I'm sure it took me longer than 10 minutes to cook but it was still under 30 minutes.  My 1 y.o. loved it (I did omit the cayenne pepper).  I also added some thinly sliced carrots once the liquid was added to the pan.  I will definitely make this again!

There wasn't anything particularly wrong with this dish, I just did not care for it. I have other Asian-style chicken recipes that I like better. My husband thought it was allright, but a little weak. Thank you anyway!

This recipe was quick and easy; I was even able to employ my little sister in helping me with some of the tasks. I mixed the corn starch with the soy sauce, and coated the chicken with that. No corn starch burned in my wok. =)

This was okay - the sauce is missing something, not sure what.  I added some chinese five spice blend, but maybe it needs ginger?  Also, I had to reduce the soy sauce a lot as it was way too salty, even with reduced-sodium soy sauce.  I will probably make it again, but will try adding some other spices.

I added some sugar, sesame oil, green pepper and onions. I did not expect any sauce because of the previous review, but mine had a lot of sauce.

I thought this recipe turned out quite well.  I put in a lot of cayenne pepper (I like it spicy).  I also replaced the chicken with fake chicken that you can buy at health food stores.  And I added lots of veggies.  I will definitely make again!

Very good, and quick.  I didn't have green onions or cayenne pepper, so I used zucchini and hot pepper sauce instead.  Turned out very well, and I got to use some of my garden vegetables!  Thanks!

I made this as written but added a cup of slivered carrots and 8 cups of finely chopped cabbage.  I continued to cook over med high until cabbage was just slightly done.   It is a total keeper.  And a winner for those of us on WW as well!

I’m surprised at how simple it was to make I had no idea what to make for dinner and I put in diced chicken and tada!! Quick and easy the longest process was the rice!! And my SO loved it!! And I’m definitely in the beginners category with cooking so I’ve got to brag and say not bad

Don't change a thing EXCEPT make 3 times the sauce.  I made this with tofu and it all got sucked up by it.  Recipe transferred beautifully.  But needed more sauce!!!

I didn't really like  the flavor either. The only change I made was I added broccoli, snow peas and grated carrots. I guess I changed a 10 minute meal into a  1/2hour meal.

Though quick and easy, it wasn't true to the photo. I'll likely make it again, but add Szechuan Peppercorns and chicken stock instead of water next time.

Excellent recipe! Very simple and quick. Served with jasmine rice. Followed exactly. If you like a "saucier" dish then double up on sauce recipe. This would probably be good with some shredded carrot added. You definitely have to try this recipe!

Great recipe and easy to make. The cornstarch made a great breading, but the chicken was a little bland. I had to add a bit of seasoning to bring out the flavor.

This recipe was great. I didn't have white wine vinegar, so I used red wine vinegar, and added ginger and seseme oil, and doubled the sauce, and it was really good. I also added steamed broccoli and snow peas, to round out a full meal.

I didnt have white wine vinegar so i used red wine vinegar and rice vinegar (1 Tb red, 1/2 Tb rice). Also, i didnt add all the sugar because i think it wouldve made it too sweet. Adding some partially boiled carrots brought some color and made it more healthy. I will definitely make again!! Tastes great :)

My family found this recipe to be too salty and rather bland. I would try to reduce the soy and up the cayenne pepper next time.

Family and I did not like this at all.  Made as directed.  Couldn't even eat it as leftovers the next night.  Not sure why it got such good reviews.

I reduced the amount of soy sauce in order to reduce the sodium intake and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Definitely a great dish!

It was more tart than i like. Do you think using rice vinegar would make that much difference? That was the only change i made.

It's a keeper! I sauteed onions and garlic and set aside, then added later along with steamed broccoli florets. Instead of low salt soy sauce, I used half regular soy sauce and half water. I doubled the sauce and served with rice noodles. yummy

Easy to make! Works great with many substitutes! Served with rice and added veggies. I also put soy sauce and sriracha on the table for added flavor.  I will make this again.

Awesome dish! My family thoroughly enjoyed this - even our 12yo son almost licked his bowl and ours! He has been asking for this dish ever since! lol. This will be a regular for us now. So easy and tasty. Perfect recipe. Thanks! 10/10.

I doubled the sauce and added red pepper flakes and a couple tsp. of ginger paste. It was very soy saucey and ended up not being my favorite. Next time, I will add some beef broth in place of water, cut the soy sauce down a little and add more water so it simmers down to a nice brown sauce.  I also steamed some veggies to stir into the bowls at the end so they're not overpowered by the sauce!

I made this tonight, using some of Susan K's ideas like Chinese wine and sesame oil. I also reduced the soy to 3 tbsp. to accommodate the sesame and Chinese wine. My family loved it.

I made it just like it was written and I thought it was pretty good. But  some family members thought it tasted too soy saucy. Maybe next time I'll reduce the soy sauce and add a little oyster sauce instead.

We loved it! Did use sesame oil instead of vegetable oil and I served it over rice noodles instead of rice. I tossed some extra sauce in with the noodles as well! Huge hit here! Super quick and easy and my two young sons had seconds!

I have made dinner using this recipe at least a half dozen times, most of the time for the guys at the fire station. It's always a big hit. That said, concerning this gravy/sauce, I adjust the serving levels to twice or three times as many as needed when I make the sauce. That way there's always plenty of sauce to drizzle on the rice! I have also added one or two large sweet onions (cut into medium to small chunks) for volume and flavor.

Looked for a quick and easy recipe for a little something different to cook, since I was already a bit late on cooking dinner.  Looks good, tho I skipped on the green onion, I kept everything else as in the recipe. Fast, had dinner done in 15-20 minutes (including rice/steamed broccoli)

By reading at this recipe and imagining what it's like and taste, I think it's a fabulous menu to serve on board the ship which am working as a chef, because most of the crews are fond of eating spicy yet delicious one. Looking to cook this forward and post what will be the feed back next time I'll mke comment on this recipe.

Easy and delicious! I make this once a week, following the directions exactly. I just don't feel this recipe needs tweaked, which is something I usually do. I like to serve this with wild rice, sauteed veggies and extra sauce.

This was just ok. It lacked in flavor. I think next time I will add some seasonings to the cornstarch mixture--garlic powder, pepper, onion powder, maybe some dried cilantro and ginger as well.

This was pretty good! The only change I made was using rice wine vinegar instead of the white because its what I had. I also doubled the sauce & added some chopped broccoli to it & served on white rice! Yummy :-)

This was great.  I added some ginger to the chicken when I was cooking it (if you like ginger) and a little rice wine vinegar with the soy sauce and white wine.  Good stuff.  Husband grew up in Taiwan and said it tasted a lot like dishes he had there.  Thank you!

I agree with two of the recurring themes here: it definitely takes longer than ten minutes, and the flavor is missing something.  My favorite variation so far involved replacing the vegetable oil with a olive/canola blend, the white wine vinegar with rice vinegar and adding two tsp of fresh minced ginger. Since there isn't a lot of sauce to go around I prefer using basmati or jasmine rice since they have more flavor.  A definite improvement but still needs a little tweaking.  Perhaps chili oil instead of cayenne?

I cut the cayenne pepper and I doubled the 'sauce', but still there wasn't enough to use as a gravy over rice. The thing with Jasmine rice, though, is it's flavor is great all by itself and fantastic with this recipe. I served mixed veggies on the side instead of in the sauce because there would not have been enough to cover. I was a bit skeptical of the white wine vinegar and the cornstarch. The cornstarch is what chinese food restaurants use to 'bread' their chicken I bet because it behaves a lot different than flour when cooked and the end result looks like what you might find at your local take out. The white wine vinegar made the rice glossy and less sticky and gave it a unique flavor. I was certain that my kids, 7 and 3, would flat out reject it. I even told my husband it was his turn to make the kids eat. They are picky eaters and usually put up a fight. To my surprise they both asked for more!

I added frozen stir fry veggies, doubled the sauce, doubled the cayenne pepper, and added ground ginger to the corn starch. I actually with it had a little more kick, it was also pretty salty. I had it with fried rice, I think it will probably taste better with white, there is just so much flavor.

This is very good. Be sure to not put anymore rice vinegar than it calls for. Maybe I am slow but it took me about 45 mins from start to finish to cook this. I made a couple of changes. I like it a little more spicy so I doubled the pepper. The first time I made it I cut the onions as the recipe instructs and they were way too big. I now cut the onions very small and it has a better flavor to it. It was lacking a little so I added some brocolli. All I had was frozen brocolli so I added it, stirred, covered and simmered until broccoli was no longer frozen.

This was good. I added a lot of vegetables and a little ginger to it. I did find the amount of oil wasn't enough, or maybe I just didn't add the water soon enough. The chicken was very tender and tasted more like what you get at a Chinese restaurant than anything I've made before.

We enjoyed this immensly. It was received by me as the dish of the day. I also doubled the sauce, served it over white rice and added generic asian style vegetables. This is definately going on our weekly rotation. Thanks for the recipe.

This was really good. I added some finely chopped onion in with the garlic and chicken, because I had no green onions. I also added half a package of frozen stir-fry veggies and left out the cayenne for my kids. Thanks for sharing!

This was absolutely awesome chicken!  I am fairly adept at chinese cooking (just from experience) and I haven't had an easier or tastier recipe.  Thanks for sharing, if I could give it a 10, I would!

This recipe was so easy and so good. My husband loved them. I think I'll use less garlic next time, only because I don't love garlic. Other than that, this is a fantastic recipe.

I love this recipe because it takes no time to make and I can change up how spicy I make it by adjusting the red pepper.

I didnt like this recipe becuase even when I used 1/2 the chicken so I could get some sauce out of it there was none. The chicken was tasty but there was no sauce left. also if I did mke this again I would skip the corn starch becuase there isnt enough oil added to the pan because the corn starch soak it all up.

This was definitely a tasty basic recipe.  My favorite thing about it, though, is it's versatility.  You could tweek this in so many different ways, and I'm sure they'd all be good.

This was good - although I used regular soy sauce and it was TOO salty!!!!  I will try it again with low sodium soy sauce.  We added a lot of broccoli to it to make it an entire dinner dish.

I made this dish with 2 Pork Loins, cubed.  It tasted wonderful.  If you like a bite in your food, double-up on the Cayenne.  I added brown rice and stir fry vegetables, Yummy.

I really liked this recipe, although it was a little salty because I didn't use low-sodium soy sauce. When I make it again, I'll fix that and maybe I'll give it five stars.

This had great flavor and was really easy. I added broccoli and red pepper, along with decreasing soy sauce a bit and throwing in some sesame seeds.

This was so easy to make but next time I'll make it a little more spicy.  It didn't have that kick we like, but this dish made up for that in taste.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was a tasty recipe.  I decreased the amount of soy sauce, used crushed red pepper in place of the cayenne, and added veggies (green pepper, water chestnuts, zucchini).  My husband, who usually prepares the stir-fry in our house, really enjoyed it.  Thanks!

Excellent. I usually leave out the green onions and add a variety of stir-fry veggies at the end and serve with rice.

I really liked this recipe because it was easy to make and it tasted great.  If you like soy sauce a lot, its great just the way it is.  If you are like my boyfriend and don't like too much soy sauce, try reducing the amount of soy sauce and increasing the amount of water.  Either way, its pretty good.

Good, quick and easy.  Too much soy sauce, though...needs a bit of tweaking.  Needed to use more than 1 T of oil to saute chicken.  Thanks for sharing!

YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY! My whole family raved, even my 2 year old liked it! I added some red bell pepper, shredded carrot, and celery and stir-fried them all together for about two minutes before following the rest of recipe exactly. I would only add that if you add a lot of extras like I did, you should increase the sauce ingredients as well. I will do that next tme because I will DEFINITELY be making this one again... still savoring the after taste :)
