A great dish to bring to a Thanksgiving dinner - it can be made ahead and travels well.  With some minor changes, this recipe would rate 5 stars.  Next time I'll reduce the water by the amount of lemon juice and squeeze all of the water out of the cranberries (couscous is too sticky otherwise) and add the lemon zest to the water with the couscous.  Also cook the celery with the squash - it will still have some crunch.  Like the suggestion of shallots or onions roasted with the squash - more flavorful.  Tastes good warm too.

This was an interesting blend of flavors. Surprisingly, my boyfriend liked it best. I used fresh cranberries that I cooked down a bit in sugar and water, and used dried lemon peel and bottled lemon juice. Also, my couscous came with a flavor packet (garlic and herb), so I threw it in and am glad I did. I think the salad would have been a bit bland without. Only other change was to leave out the almonds, because DBF is allergic. Very pretty and would be great to bring to a potluck.

I cooked the couscous in 2 cups broth for more flavor, added some mushrooms that needed to be used,  and only added the juice from the lemon I zested.  We really enjoyed this.  Good both warm and at room temp.  Would not make again without the mushrooms though.

I thought this was really good but I modified a few things 
-added 1/3 cup finely diced onions
-bag of glazed walnuts (crushed) instead of almonds. Tasty contrast with tart lemon juice 
-1/2 cup of crumbled feta cheese
Increased salt, pepper and lemon juice to give it more flavor.

I accidentally used quinoa instead of couscous but it turned out great! Very quick and easy!

I think every oven is different but check on the squash right after the 15 minutes. Mine was still hard even though I added 10 more min on 450F. Yummy and healthy recipe!

This was a great dish! Adding finely chopped shallots gave it more flavor.
