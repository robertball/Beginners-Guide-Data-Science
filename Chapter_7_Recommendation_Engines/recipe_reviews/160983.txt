Very good!  I did not add the celery salt or the olives, and it turned out wonderful.

Awesome!  Added Worcestershire sauce instead of steak sauce.  Rubbed rims with lemon and used Tajin on the rim. But overall terrific!!!

3.28.18  Many bloody mary mixes have a lot of ingredients, this one doesn’t, and that’s one thing I like about it.  I used  Spicy V-® juice, some A-!® Bold & Spicy Sauce, a couple good shakes of Tabasco, and rimmed the glass with salt for a really tangy, spicy  bloody mary.  your mom, thanks for sharing your recipe.
