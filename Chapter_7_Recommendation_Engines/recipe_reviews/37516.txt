I made these cookies for a mime performance at our church, and they were a hit!  I used some cherry and some raspberry preserves, and everyone loved them!  Like the other person said, I'll probably crush the raisin bran next time.  Now, almost a year later, I've made this for yet another Christmas mime performance, and people are always asking for it!  Great recipe!!  I wonder why mroe people haven't tried this yet?  Raspberry preserves work best, I think.  Years later, I made this with my 3 yr old (2008) during Christmastime.  We had a blast dumping ingredients into my  KitchenAid, and she loved rolling the balls and putting her thumbprints into the cookies.  Great recipe to do with children. Using cereal really cracks the young ones up.

This recipe is wonderful.  I suggest making some with jam and some without.  They are fabulous with a mug of steaming coffee, too!  Enjoy!

This was a wonderful and easy recipe!! I don't know what the other reviewers were talking about.  My 13 year old niece made this for my sisters baby shower, and everyone complimented us on them.  I recently made this for my co-wokers and they too loved them and requested the recipe.  I will continue to pass this recipe on.  Thanks for the great recipe.

The cookies came out hard and they themselves had no good flavor at all. It was impossible to roll into balls with the cereal flakes and then indent them before baking. DO NOT recommend this recipe!!!

Theese cookies were great!  Very easy to make and very tasty.  I improvised a little and mixed in crushed Cheerios cereal, since I didn't have Rasin Bran cereal at home.  It made the cookies a bit crunchy.  Also I poured some melted chocolate on top after the cookies were done.  Everyone that tried them was impressed, and this was my very first time baking cookies.  I think next time I will use crushed almonds instead of cereal in the mixture and see what happens.

I make these every Christmas & often again for New Year's Eve.  I use Polaner All Fruit Rasberry on some cookies and Apricot Preserves on others.  The apricot is my favorite & are more popular around with my family.

We tried these cookies for Thanksgiving with our Daycare childen. They were very easy to make and the children got to help, enjoying making their own thumb print.  Then we created some of the cookies with chocolate chips and nuts in place of the jam.  They got to try them out still warm from the oven and we all loved them.
