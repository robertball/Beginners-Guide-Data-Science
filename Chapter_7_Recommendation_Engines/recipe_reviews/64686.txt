This recipe was excellent and quite healthy.  I added some crushed red pepper and a little dried basil and oregano and it was extremely flavorful.  It made great leftovers the next day, too.  I will definetely make this again soon!

This was such a good recipe. Even my husband, who does not normally like bell peppers, said that the flavors blended together very well and he ate every single bite. 
One thing, the recipe makes a TON of filling, so either cut it all down by half or make it with two peppers instead of one (to feed more people). Or find one unusually large pepper.
This is one that we will be eating again soon.

This is a really easy and yummy recipe. I used two medium-sized peppers instead of one large, doubled the garlic, and added some diced onion. Perfect amount for two with a salad and bread.

I used buffalo meat instead of the boca. Loved the feta cheese in there! I also used a can of tomatoe paste. Topped with lots of cheddar and parm before baking. Very yummy! :)
