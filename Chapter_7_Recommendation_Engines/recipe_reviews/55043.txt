I made this last night for dinner and was pleasantly surprised at the tastiness and ease of preparation.  I did however make a couple of changes, but the base recipe still deserves 5 stars.  I added 1/4 cup of dry white wine, 1 tbsp of lemon juice, and 1 cup each diced Roma tomatoes and white mushrooms to the garlic for the first 5 minutes of cooking.  I also added 1 bag of baby spinach leaves at the end with the parsley until it was just wilted.  It was pretty to look at as well as delicious. My husband who is a certified carnivore, actually enjoyed this, and suggested maybe adding some cooked shrimp next time I make it.
**UPDATE**
I made this again last night with a few additional changes, and it became an outstanding dinner!!  I used the basic recipe. I added  the baby spinach leaves, mushrooms, roma tomatoes, 1/2 cup white wine, and 1 tbsp lemon juice, like I wrote last time I made it, but last night I added diced cooked chicken, black olives, roasted red peppers, onions, some capers, sun-dried tomatoes (drained) and pine nuts to the mix...What a HUGE difference!!  It was already a great recipe, but these few simple additions took it WAY over the top!!  I sprinkled a handful of shredded Mozzarella cheese over top just before serving and served it with an artisan cheese bread and there wasn't a drop of leftovers!! Like the old Alka-Seltzer commercial said... "I can't believe we ate the whole thing"!!  :)

This was very good.  Flavorful but not overly spicy.  I served this with garlic bread and salad and it made for a light but filling meal.  Plus I had all the ingredients on hand!  Will make again.

This was very tasty and extremely easy!!  I did add a splash of white wine and the juice from half of a lemon when I added the parsley.  Then I stirred in the parmesan cheese right after I turned off the heat so that the liquid was absorbed by the cheese. Delicious!!

This recipe is best left alone. Do, however, use a good parmesan cheese. Do not commit the horrible sin of using the green box kind. Let the cheese come to room temperature then take a fork and gently take off small bits from the cheese, gently adding them to the pasta. Delicious.

Even adding more cheese (this helps everything-can you tell I am a cheesehead? Wisconsin & The Packers) didnt help! No one else liked it either! I wont be making this again. Even with modifications here and there with this and that! No Go!

Easy to make and it has a nice flavor.  Made this as is once and then another time I ran out of oil and used butter instead-it was still delicious.

This is the perfect recipe for a good whole wheat pasta and real parmagiano-reggiano cheese.  For a little different taste, toss with fresh basil,thyme and tomatoes from the garden. YUM.

Pretty good, but dry after standing a bit. This was nicely flavored, not too garlicky, mild taste. I prefer a lot more spices and flavors going on, but it was good and made a nice hot lunch in a short time. Thanks!

It's very simple to make and very good.  I added some garlic salt and crushed red peppers for some spice.  Perhaps adding some basil would give it some flavor too.
