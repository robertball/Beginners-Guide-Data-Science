I'm not sure about kids, but my guests loved it and insisted they take the recipe home!  I chose it because I was craving capers, and it worked.  Its heavy on the olives, but my husband who doesn't like olives even raved!  Great social dinner for casual guests.

This was O.K. as directed but would probably forgo the capers next time, or at least use less. Thanks for sharing.

I really enjoyed this meal!  Easy to make.  The ingredients fit together well in terms of taste and everyone at our house just loved it.  A nice bottle of wine and a little bread made a wonderful start to the evening.

What confused me and my husband was that there was no real sauce in which to simmer all the goodies that went into this 'sauce'!  So we decided to add some white wine (to get the juices out of the tomatoes) and then it all took off!  It was great!  I decided to be adventurous with the cheeses and added a mix of primasalata (a harder version of a somewhat salty ricotta), mahon (a spanish cow's milk cheese), and some drunken goat cheese...well, I bet it would be great with any kind of mix of random cheese you have somewhere in your fridge!  Other changes:  I added more mushrooms ('cause I had extra), cut the capers in half, and rinsed the kalamata... and it still didn't need extra salt!  My husband is Calabrian and he thinks it's own of the better pasta dishes he's ever had!  Wierd, but... there you have it!

I've been making this recipe for over a year now - it is a FAVORITE!!  I use Smoked Gouda instead of mozzerella (has more flavor).  You do have to be a fan of capers and kalamata olives to really enjoy.

Wow!  This pasta packs a punch.  I have made this dish several times and keep coming back for more.  It is also great on rice, on a cut of meat, or as a topping for crusty bread.  Fabulous!

I liked using pepperoni & the kalamata olives but this really needed a sauce of some kind. used white wine but that didn't help. Also used spaghetti noodles which I would not recommend.

This was a very tasty dinner, and a recipe that you can definitely adjust to your taste. I made it mostly according to the recipe this time--I did add a little white wine to the sauce, and because mine cooked a bit too long (started the pasta late, and it was whole wheat pasta, so it takes longer!) and was getting dried out, I tossed in some leftover diced tomatoes I had on hand.

Next time I think I'll try it with feta instead, and you could also add other things like artichokes or a different kind of sausage....it will be fun to experiment!

Note: most of these ingredients are salty, so this is not for the sodium-conscious.

I expected a better response from this recipe.  But I was the only one that went back for more.  If the guys don't care for it, it just doesn't make it in my house.

This was great! I made it for the company and everyone liked it - even got asked for the recipe! My kids didn't like it but I just gave them plain noodles. I will definitely be making this one again and wouldn't change anything.

The only problem was the pasta-to-sauce ratio. Make less pasta for the amount of sauce this recipe produces.

Fantastic! We used black olives instead of kalamata because they were way cheaper. And pretty much had enough ingredients to double the recipe. I used a chopper to nicely chop the olives. After combining all the ingredients in the pan I let it simmer for a good 15 or so minutes continually stirring. This allowed for everything to melt together. The big pieces of mushrooms and tomatoes came together nicely in the end with a beautiful uniform thick sauce! Topped with smoked gouda because I couldn't find smoked mozz. This is a great recipe to try! Beautiful and different! I think the smoked cheese is a must :)

Had to sub in olive-feta chicken sausage for the olives for my meat lovers but we really liked this.  Easy, too!

Overall I thought this recipe was pretty good. I did use black olives instead of kalamata olives because I knew my kids wouldn't eat the kalamatas. There wasn't really much sauce with this pasta, which was fine with us, but I could see some people being surprised by it. The flavor was great, and my kids liked it a lot. My 7 year old said, "Is this like pizza pasta?", which would probably be a pretty good description of it with very similar ingredients to a pizza. This was pretty quick to make also, with it only taking me about 20 minutes or so, and that makes it very nice for a weeknight. Thank you for the recipe, Sarah and Annette!

Made as written except that I couldn't find smoked mozzarella and used regular. The olives seemed to overpower in this dish to me and I love olives. There is so much tanginess in the capers that I think regular black olives would be better. If you like capers and olives then you should give this one a try. I do recommend adding some fresh parsley or basil as a garnish.

We enjoyed this very much. I didn't think there would be enough moisture in the dish but there was. The smoked mozzarella was delicious but very pricey and regular would work in this dish too. It is a nice change from the usual pasta and I will be making this again.
