These are DELISH!!! I used 1/2 coconut oil, 1/2 unsweetened applesauce, and Stevia in place of sugar. I didn't use dates nor nuts----but some butterscotch chips I had left over. So yummy. I will make these again for sure.

So here's what I did:

1) I added 1 cup of pecans to the mix
2) I did not chill the dough, just dropped it by teaspoonfuls onto the cookie sheet
3) Didn't press down the mounds of dough with a fork, just let them bake puffed up, and got a softer cookie

Everything worked out just great!

These cookies were fabulous!!  We used raisins instead of dates and did add some butterscotch chips.  One word of caution....be sure to let the dough chill long enough.  We formed the balls after only one hour of chilling and they got a bit sticky and gooey on our hands.  We solved that my dipping our hands in flour before rolling each ball but chilling longer would have helped that.  Can't wait to make them again and they are filling.

I tried this recipe using 1/2 coconut oil and 1/2 natural peanut butter, then subbed out the white sugar for stevia, the white flour for coconut flour and the dates for mashed ripe banana. AMAZING!

I used "egg beaters" instead of the eggs.  I also used "Smart Balance" 50/50 omega spread in place of butter.  I used 1 c dark chocolate chips instead of the dates. And I didn't chill the dough, just dropped them by tablespoonful on the cookie sheet and didn't press them down. Baked them 8 minutes. They were absolutely great.  Next time, I'll sub some of the butter for unsweetened applesauce, as others have suggested.

A perfectly dependable recipe, and I mean that in the nicest way! This recipe made a nice batch of great oatmeal cookies. Very sweet, especially with the dates, but the cookies turn out very nice so to alter the sugar, flour/ oat ingredients might change the integrity of the cookie. Love that it uses whole wheat flour. I used  unsalted butter and am glad  I did as the cookies are plenty salty.  I will use this recipe again and play around with some of the other suggestions made by other reviewers. (coconut oil, flax seeds, etc.) to make them even 'healthier'.

I loved the idea of a healthier oatmeal cookie recipe, so went ahead and made a little adjustments to this recipe hoping my family would like it.  These are my changes: substituted butter with coconut oil, used 1 1/3 c brown sugar in place of both sugars, doubled the vanilla extract, reduced the all-purpose flour to 1/2 c, reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp, omitted the cinnamon and dates, and added 1 c chopped pecans and 1/2 c raisins.  The rest of the ingredients (eggs, baking soda & whole wheat flour) were kept the same as the original recipe.  My family loved these!! :) I try to always have these already rolled into balls in the freezer, so I can just take them out of the freezer to room temp while the oven gets to 375F and bake them for 12 minutes, this way they are done but still a bit chewy and just delicious.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

These cookies are fantastic! They are quite sweet - the butter, brown sugar and oats makes them taste similar to a crumble topping (great crumbled onto greek yogurt for dessert!). I would be interested in ways to reduce the sweetness (maybe replacing some of the sugar with apple sauce like the idea mentioned earlier) to make them a bit more savoury & healthy.

They were very good. I added pecans, coconut, dried cherries, and chocolate chips. I used half the sugar, only used the brown. I replace with half a banana and used only 1/2 cup of the butter and a half cup applesauce. Very moist and nice texture and sweet enough  with the banana and applesauce.

My changes:

1/4 cup stevia in place of 1/2 cup white sugar
3/4 cup raw coconut crystals in place of brown sugar
2 cups of all-purpose flour in place of 1 all-purpose and 1 whole wheat. I just ran out of whole wheat or I would have used it m
1/2 cup simply smart omega-3 spread and 1/2 cup apple sauce in place of 1 cup of butter
2/3 cup dates in place of 1 cup dates
3/4 cup of raisins

Came out great! Picky the kid (3 yrs) loves them!

Here are my changes: a cup of applesauce instead of butter, 2 cups all purpose flour (didn't have any whole wheat flour), no dates and dark chocolate chunks.  They were really good!  Very soft, almost like a muffin texture.  Would recommend!

I really enjoy making healthy switches to some of my favorites. Oatmeal cookie have long been a favorite.  I made this recipe for my son's class.  They were a huge hit!! All the parents asked for the recipe. I used 1/2 raisins and 1/2 cranberries in stead of dates for the batch I took to his class.  I added 1/4 c unsweetened coconut flakes and 2 tbsp of flaxseed and unsweetened applesauce to the batch I made for us. My family devoured them!  This is definitely a KEEPER. Thanks for sharing.

So good!  I swapped half the butter for coconut oil.  Next time I'll try swapping the rest of the butter for unsweetened applesauce, and I'd love to try these with some dark chocolate.  Lots of possibilities - thanks for a great recipe!

These are very good! And I also feel good with this recipe as being a healthier version of greasier oatmeal cookies. And even with this being a lighter version I still cut out 1/4 cup of brown sugar and doubled on cinnamon and vanilla. Also added 1 cup or roasted walnuts that I roughly chopped up for my husband and on the 2nd batch I added 3/4 cup of roasted almonds roughly chopped for myself and my 5 year old daughter. This is a go to recipe when we crave oatmeal cookies!! :)

Very good recipe.  I omitted the cinnamon, added raisins and extra vanilla,  reduced the sugar and did not chill.  Excellent flavor!  Next time I'll use apple sauce instead of butter and reduce the sugar a bit more.  Also, the cookies were a bit "cakey"--maybe it was the baking soda.

I couldn’t say what is “healthier” about this recipe given all the butter and sugar it has, but they are delicious, soft, and I’ve never made oatmeal cookies with dates it’s an amazing idea!

The recipe as written is slightly healthier than the linked original.  However, the only changes were to replace half the flour with whole wheat, and to cut the sugar content a bit.  

I took it a couple of steps further and replaced half the butter with applesauce, subbed splenda* for the white sugar, and used exclusively white whole wheat flour. I thought about using egg beaters instead of eggs, but the difference would be negligible.  Oh, and I did not add the dates, as I didn't have those or a reasonable substitute on hand.

They came out quite well.  Chewy and oatmealy and just sweet enough.

*Yes, I realize Splenda is controversial as being healthy.  I've tried Stevia and find it to have a weird, bitter aftertaste, and use Splenda sometimes as a baking friendly way to lower calorie count.    

I really want to add some raspberries to these.

I substituted half the butter and all of the eggs with one cup of canned pumpkin puree(1/4 c per egg + 1/2 c for the butter).  I used stevia instead of the white sugar.  Next time I will cut back on the stevia just a little. It's a little bit too sweet and I can barely taste the stevia.  But the cookies are delicious.  I'd like a little nutmeg with the pumpkin too.  It will make a yummy breakfast cookie.  Also I used whole wheat pastry flour.

Great cookies!  I made it even lower calorie by using Splenda brown sugar and land o lakes light butter.  Also, I added 1 tbsp wheat germ.

I made these as directed in the recipe (except for the fork trick...).  The cookies turned out YUMMY!!!  Soft and chewy, and I feel like I can eat them without feeling as bad lol

I drizzled some chocolate on some of these, and melted vanilla on a few others.  It turned out quite nicely!!

These are great cookies - of course I made some adjustments, held back slightly on the oatmeal and added sesame seeds and toasted almonds to the same quantity. I did find this dough to be really crumbly - even after refrigerating it and so shaping it was really more a case of smushing it together. But it did bake into a very nice cookie. The sesame seeds really add something to it, in my opinion!

Very tasty, but the dough was quite dry and crumbling.  I used all white flour and raisins because that's what we had handy.  I'll probably do this recipe again but next time will add a bit more liquid, maybe a few tablespoons of water or another egg.  Thanks for sharing!

I made these, just substituted a 1/4c egg substitute for egg and 1/2 of the butter for apple sauce.  They are chewy and thick, a good mini granola bar, but not a very appetizing soft cookie.
Next time I'll try it per the recipe and adjust my review if they're better!
Also, I made 1/2 the recipe with dates and 1/2 with chocolate chips - each 1/2 made 30 mini cookies that are 79 calories each if you enter the ingredients into myfitnesspal

I enjoyed this recipe a lot nice and soft too! I did a bit of substituting. I used 1 1/2 cup crasins rather than dates. I used 1 cup chia flour instead of white flour and 1 cup rye flour instead of wheat flour. Has a good texture to them, I didn't cool the dough, just dropped it onto sheets with a teaspoon and didn't flatten them. Not very sweet but I Will make them again. But I will try to sweeten them a little more next time.

These are great but I  did make a few changes the last time I made them.  I used 1/4 C white flour and 3/4 fine almond flour instead of 1 C wh. flour.  I used about 2 C chopped  dates and about 1 C of chopped walnuts too.

I replaced the butter with ghee since my son is allergic to dairy and baked for 10 minutes. I was worried the ghee would make the cookies weird textured but instead the cookies were crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. Delightful!

I cut the recipe in half as I wasn't sure if my girls were going to like it as much as I would. I was right, they didn't much care for them... But I added dried cranberries and pecans. They're marshmallow type kids. The recipe is delicious and versatile. I substituted stevia for the white sugar, but I kept the butter in and the brown sugar. Next time I will probably do peanut butter and apple sauce and coconut oil.  Mmmmmm. They're soft and delicious. Yes.

These are the best oatmeal cookies I have made, I followed most of the recipe but instead of dates, I used half a cup of original craisins & a half cup blueberry juice infused craisins, and 1/4 cup crushed almonds.. My new favorite cookie!

My son wouldn't eat the fresh dates we received from someone so we made these and he gobbled them right up. I didn't change the recipe at all.
