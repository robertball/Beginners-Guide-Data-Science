Easy to make. Flavorful but not overpowering. Turkey is so moist.

Just realized I have not rated this recipe...and this will be my fourth or fifth year prepping my turkey like this. We have never had a leftover turkey since I started using this method. I have made my own adjustments but I always make sure to leave the primary seasonings as is. Love love love
