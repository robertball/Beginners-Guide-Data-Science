My family and I love this salad.  The last time a made this salad I did drain the beans thoroughly.  We did  enjoy the salad much more when I did not drain the beans thoroughly, as the juice made it more enjoyable.  It's a personal taste I guess.

This was really good. I did add 50% more of the dressing as the original amount was not enough for my taste. The next time I make it, I am going to add some celery to make a little more "crunch" and some additional flavor.

Unlikely combination of ingredients that all work together very well.  What a nice change from so many apple salads that are just laden with mayonnaise, cream cheese, whipping cream, etc.  This is low in calories, low sodium, less than 1 gram of fat, and very high in fiber.  This is one healthy salad that tastes great, so no guilt trip on this one!

Two recommendations:

1. Cut the apples into pieces about the same size size as a bean, like in the photo, so when you take a bite, the apple doesn't overwhelm the taste. 

2. Double the dressing.  This needs a bit more than in the recipe.

This is excellent. Such a good, unusual taste. Must be the Dijon mustard.

I made this for Thanksgiving.  I used "Gala" apples which are nice and firm and sweet.  This has become an "IMMEDIATE FAVORITE".  I doubled the dressing and all of the salad went very fast and even the dressing!!!  The cracked pepper I used was a fresh ground "mixed peppercorns".  This salad is so fresh tasting.  Even those who don't usually care for beans liked this salad.  Thank you for you wonderful collections of bean recipes!!!!!

This was tasty, and I enjoyed the crunch factor and the variety of flavors!  I added celery like a previous reviewer, and kept some of the juice from the kidney beans as per another reviewer; used green onions and yellow bell pepper rather than red onion and green pepper, but it was what I happened to have in the house.  This salad seems to be versatile depending on what you have in the fridge...kept the dressing as is...it really popped!!  Thank you so much!

Excellent...and who woulda thought it!  Unusual combination but great fresh flavors.  It also stays fresh for a few days!  I agree with the tip on doubling the dressing and the tip on adding the celery.

I followed this recipe exactly except to add the step of soaking the chopped apples in acidulated water to prevent them from turning brown as I was planning on taking some salad to work for lunch.  This was quite good and even though my husband was afraid of the beans with the apples, he liked it quite well after he tasted it.  Thank you so much for the post.

This was "unexpected" indeed!  I added a stalk of celery I needed to use.  I took off one star for it being overly sweet for me: I will use less honey next time.  I plan to make this again to serve alongside porkchops.
*ETA: This does NOT keep well. Eat the day of! Unfortunately I think eating the leftovers has turned me off from making this again...

Yummy -daughter and I are not too fond of apples - but in this, they actally taste good mixed with everything else.  Like the others, I added celery and increased the dressing - next time will double it.  Thanks for the recipe!

A delightful combination!  It has very good flavor and texture.  The whole family enjoyed. I also did not drain the beans.  I had mixed it up several hours ahead and it soaked in the flavor.  A healthy, delicious side!

My family and I had just gone apple picking, and I wanted a school lunch that would incorporate the apple in an unusual way. The only beans I had on hand were cannellini beans, and I used celery instead of green bell pepper. The dressing was great, and the salad itself was unique and refreshing. Thank you!

Very good, healthy, and tasty. There wasn't a lot of dressing and you could increase the quantity, but it wasn't bad the way it was. I've gotten used to salads with less dressing on them since I started eating more healthfully. Probably not something most kids would eat, however. Now when I make it I usually just Hendrickson's original dressing since I usually have it on hand.

Friends loved the salad as a side for brats and sauerkraut and mashed potatoes. To serve 8, I combined 2 Gala apples and 1 large Granny Smith, doubling the wine vinegar and mustard with 1 1/2 T honey .  I also added 1/3 cup diced celery. This recipe is a keeper!

A good use of whatever veggies and fruits you have on hand.  I would not leave out  the apples or peppers (I used mini colored peppers and two varieties of apple)  I omitted the beans but added a finely cut stalk of celery and an orange the second time I made this.  My red onion was a little strong so I plan to substitute scallions next time.  Overall, this is a versatile salad and dressing.

Sorry, the flavors here just didn't come together for us. I followed the recipe exactly, but the result tasted like apples and beans. None of us ate it. Two stars because it's healthy, though! Thanks anyway!

I was very surprised by how good this is.  I'm not a huge fan of beans, but I'm trying to use them more for health benefits, so I think the mild flavour, and creamy texture of kidney beans makes them a good choice.  This was great when we made it, but even better the second day.

This recipe is amazing!  I always include salad greens, and sometimes throw in some more veggies.  The dressing is delicious and goes so well with the other ingredients!
