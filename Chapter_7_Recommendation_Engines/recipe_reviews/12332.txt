I made these for my father in law's birthday party, from syrup from his own taps. I didn't get to have one, because they were snapped up too quickly! They got rave reviews from everyone, and my mother in law asked to have the recipe. In our family, these are a winner!

Sinfully good doesn't even begin to describe these... I added shredded coconut to mine which was lovely too, and used pecans instead of walnuts. Thank you SO much for this recipe; don't forget, real maple syrup is a must... NOT table syrup.

I made my own tart shells but the filling was a nice mix of maple and walnut.  Using pre-made shells would have made putting this recipe together a snap.  I will make these again.

These were good, but a bit too sweet...I think I will reduce the maple Syrup next time.
