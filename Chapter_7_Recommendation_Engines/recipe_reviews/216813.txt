I love making my rice with the herbs and seasoning in the cooking liquid.  
Your addition of cinnamon sticks and a bay leaf is a 
very clever 'addition' and I like it a lot.  
 
The 'cinnamon' stick is a bit more subtle than grated cinnamon and the bay leaf is gently aromatic.  
The basmati rice is such a flavorful rice to start with, that too much of anything would be overkill.
This combo of sweet, pungent combined with the somewhat flowery basmati rice....just is a delightful merging.
Lovely recipe and quite enticing to the palate!!!

Simple Spiced Rice Haiku: "Subtle flavor kiss. Nice, delicate basmati. Humble, simple spice." Basmati is of such a light, ethereal taste that it doesn't need to compete with heavy seasonings. But this simple method of preparing it yielded an airy, buttery, lightly-spiced rice that would compliment just about any entree. We loved it!

Thank you!  This recipe was great!  I wish I could say I made it exactly to recipe, but didn't have cinnamon sticks on hand, so I sprinkled in just a bit of the powdered variety.  It was still great.  Went great with my pork steaks with orange sauce.

YUM! Very very good. It was fragrant and had a nice flavor. Not strong at all but a mild cinnamon taste. It went perfectly with some Indian style meatballs in an onion raisin sauce. This would be great with many different dishes as a side. It turned out very fluffy indeed. Perfect rice, thanks!!!!!!

Where has this recipe been all of my life??!?!?!  I was so impressed with the way this turned out.  I rinsed the rice real good and soaked it for 30 minutes before cooking.  I used chicken broth instead of water.  OH. MY. GOODNESS.  This is the best rice I have ever made and the smell.....oh!  My house smelled wonderful!  I served this with the Chorizo and Lentil Stew recipe from this site.  I highly recommend this combination for an Indian-inspired meal!  I will be making this rice over and over again.

This rice is fantastic! Possibly my favorite way to prepare basmati rice as a stand alone side dish. I did not change a thing, perfect as is. Thank you kbarnett!

in my humble opinion, you can omit the onion and add a TBSP whole cloves and about 6-8 pods of whole green cardamom, this makes a delightful Indian style spiced basmati rice.  Make a  "bouquet garni", or a little bulb of spices wrapped in a piece of cheesecloth, for easy removal. Perfect with rich indian dishes!

This was good but I did have to add some cayenne and ginger because I felt like the rice needed a little something else. I served with chicken tandoori and Greek taziki.

Absolutely Fabulous Rice!  I used Jasmine rice for its nutty flavor and chicken broth for the liquid instead of water.  I also added red onion and a garlic & ginger paste.

This was so good! I only added a little onion, only because I'm not a big fan but other than that, followed the recipe. It was SO good! Subtle but delicious. And easy to make!

This was a wonderful way to make what is already my favourite kind of rice. The cinnamon sticks impart a subtle but distinct flavour that is delicious! It's a keeper.

This rice recipe is terrific.  I've made it a couple of times now and haven't been disappointed.  I use a smokey basmati rice and it comes out perfect.  I really enjoy the hint of the cinnamon.  It's very easy to make (followed the recipe to a T) and I use the leftovers to make fried rice.  Thank you for the recipe.

This recipe was great. I modified it by adding cashews (we oven roasted them first) and raisins. It was a big hit.

nice, but I prefer something with a stronger flavor. It was a good option for the potluck I went to, as it was a good break from boring, plain rice. I will make it again for potlucks.

update, made it again and added a bit of powdered cinnamon as well and the sticks and it was delicious!

Love it! I did not have any cinnamon sticks so I put in a pinch of dry cinnamon in the water with the bay leaf. Everyone loved it; I will definitely do it again.

Followed the recipe as written and while I liked it, the family wasn't too thrilled about it so won't make it again.
