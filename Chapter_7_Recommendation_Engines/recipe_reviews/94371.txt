Very tasty! But I wouldn't call it a cosmo, I'd call it a grapetini and add a 3 or 4 frozen sweet GREEN (green so you can see them) grapes to the bottom  of the martini glass before pouring. I'd go a bit heavier on the vodka too. (Plenty of room for the extra as my martini glasses are HUGE LOL!)

Very, very good but just a teeny bit sweet for me.  I added a bit of lime juice that really added the "tang" I needed.

Fantastic! Added a little orange slice for garnish. However, this only made one serving. I own a very large martini glass.

Thanks.

These are simply the best sweet martinis I have ever had.  I'm enjoying one right now!  I can my own grape juice in the summer, uummm...

Very tasty and enjoyable with a squeeze of fresh lime to make it pop and taste more like a Cosmo. Nice blend of ingredients that are portioned well. I didn't find it too sweet at all. If you think you might then add grape juice 1 oz. at a time. Garnish with an orange or lime wheel or both.

DH rated a 2 as it was too sweet for him.  Even knowing how sweet it would be, I thought it deserving of only a 3.  I love grape and orange together but this was just too grapey.  For the second round, I doubled the orange (used Triple Sec because that's what was opened) and added 1/2 t. lime juice.  It made just a tad over 3 drinks (I have regular sized martini glasses).  Would I make it again?  Yes, but for friends who do enjoy drinks on the sweet side...or just for me when I wish to have something different.

This is yummy!  I used juice I made myself from fresh concord grapes and no sugar added.  Not too sweet, just delicious.

I have to agree with several other reviews. This recipe would benefit greatly from the addition of lime juice. Firstly, it would make it cosmo, which this is not. Secondly, the acid would help cut through the cloying sweetness. Even though several reviewers mentioned this drink was too sweet for them, I thought that since I was using a higher priced, no sugar added grape juice that my cocktail wouldn't suffer the same fate. It was still far too sweet for my taste. If I'd had limes on hand I would have added a good half ounce of juice to balance this out.

Pretty good. Next time I will try adding lime juice, as someone else had suggested.
