If you like chocolate covered coffee beans from the gourmet stores, this is for you. 

I made one batch exactly as described (had decaf hazelnut beans on hand) and my husband loved it, but I thought the texture of whole beans were a little overwhelming when eating. 

The second batch I coursely ground the beans and added about a teaspoon of decaf instant coffee to make the chocolate itself have a coffee flavor too.  Incidentally, I forgot the butter in the second batch and it didn't seem to matter. Melted the white chocolate separately and swirled it in the top as others have mentioned (using a toothpick for marbled effect), and with these changes would give it 5 stars.  Another fancy touch is to score the chocolate when it is almost cooled (about 5-10 minutes in the fridge), then you can break it into beautifully even squares (1" is plenty at a time!)

A unique treat that is surprisingly easy to throw together.  People either LOVE LOVE it, or can't make it through one bite... count me in the first category.  Fabulous next to a powerful red wine or a strong cup of after-dinner coffee. POW!

I made this twice in one weekend to try out different methods.  The first time I coarsely ground the coffee and swirled in the white chocolate at the end.  The final result was a bit messy looking, thin and, as expected, gritty.  The second time I left the beans whole and drizzled white chocolate on top after the bark had completely set.  The final result was thick and beautiful!  For both trials I scored the bark after 2-3 minutes in the freezer which made slicing once completely set very easy.  This recipe yielded 24 nice-sized pieces.  I bake part-time and I break down all my recipes to cost of ingredients - this recipe, using Starbucks whole coffee beans and Ghiardelli chocolate, cost $5.09/batch.  All in all, this is a fast, easy, cheap and impressive treat that I'll be making again an again for friends and family.

Delicious & easy.  Used unsalted butter instead of margarine & it made no difference.  Put it back in the freezer when halfway through breaking apart for a few minutes as it was getting a little soft.  I scored it with a knife to make it easier to break.  Already e-mailed this to my daughter who is a lawyer & doesn't have time for complicated recipes.

WOW! And I am not even a huge chocolate fan.  I did run the beans through the grinder for a second so it was more bits than whole beans.  sprinkled the coffee dust along with the crushed white chocolate on the top.

OMG if I could give this 100 stars I would.  AMAZING!!!!   I used decaf french roast coffee beans and dark chocolate.  I did not put the white chocolate on top.  Also I spread it onto foil instead of wax paper.  This was so so so so so so good.  And SUPER easy!!!

I modified this resume to use Butterscotch Chips instead of White Chocolate, increased butter to 1 TBSP, and sprinkled with coconut flakes for color.  Additionally I used 1/4 cup of whole coffee beans and the other 1/2 cup of beans I ground slightly as was suggested by other reviewers.  I then put in fridge for about an hour and then cut carefully with a Pizza cutter. Taste Great.  Next time I might try dark chocolate.

I followed another reviewer's suggestion and made these into tablespoon-ful drops with 2-3 Fench Vanilla coffee beans on top.  I added cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg to the chocolate to complement the French Vanilla flavor, I omitted the white choocolate.  I gave these as a birthday present to a co-worker and reveived rave reviews!  She asked for the recipe....Works great for making chocolate-covered strawberries as well.  Super easy and delicious!

This was really, really good!  The only comment I have is that - while I love coffee beans, etc. - I probably would use a little less next time.  I prefer a little more chocolate ratio than I had with using what the recipe calls for.  Otherwise, delicious!

Awsome!!! The white chocolate bar I bought was pretty hard to crush though so I also melted that down in the microwave and drizzled it ontop rather than pressing it in chunks, just as good!! Thank you for this great and easy recipe!!!

This was a great addition to the candy tray!  I just made drops of chocolate and added two whole beans to the center of each - I think this is less messy.  Excellant - thank you!

This is a great recipe, only that it calls for too many coffee beans. I only used 1/4 cup in mine and there is plenty is every bite. Make sure you scale back on the beans, but be sure to experiment with different flavors of beans. I used hazelnut cream in mine and it gave the overall flavor and experience more depth.

A great addition to the holiday treats, and a plus that it's so easy to make!  It looks lovely and tastes great.  I did crush the beans slightly, then sifted out the smallest bits so I wouldn't have grit in the candy.

I'd give this 500 stars if I could. It's a kick in the pants if you don't use caffiene a lot. probably won't put as many coffee beans in it next time

I made this to give as a gift and it turned out so good!  I did make a few changes though.  I melted the semisweet chocolate chips and pured out on a greased foil-lined cookie sheet.  I then sprinkled that liberally with toffee chips to give it crunch. I was a little afraid to use the whole coffee beans so I added some toasted hazelnut cappucino mix to the melted white chocolate and it was such a winner!  I then poured the white chocolate on top of the semisweet then let it set in the fridge.  It was incredible!  So basically I ended up with what I called Hazelnut Toffee Bark.

Good expresso chocolate. I used ghirardelli chocolate and hazelnut coffee beans that I chopped coursely. Use good chocolate. I made two batches as I had to give these as Christmas gifts. The first I melted white chocolate chips and swirled it in. The second batch I used chopped white chocolate and put them in rows to cut in pieces. I let these set up but before they were form I scored them with a knife and they were easy to break into pieces after they were dry. I wrapped small packages in saran wrap and tied with ribbons. My coffee lovers will love this. Great with a bottle of cabernat to go with the expresso bark.  Store in the frig or freezer.  What a nice Christmas gift.

I like chocolate covered coffee beans, but I would've used half the beans! My mouth was just full off coffee grit once all the chocolate was gone!
Chocolate (candy making) wafers work too, and then you don't have to use the margarine.

This was a great treat with a little caffeine kick! Next time I might break the coffee beans into smaller pieces. The chocolate tasted great and the look was very pretty.

Simple and delicious!  I melted the chocolate chips (with the marg) in a double boiler, while simultaneously melting the white chocolate using the microwave method.  I very coursely chopped the beans (and probably reduced it down to about 1/2 cup).  After spreading the chocolate/beans onto the cookie sheet, I drizzled the melted whit chocolate over the top, and sprinkled a few whole coffee beans around. Wow!  This tastes great, and is very simple to make.  Be careful though - this is VERY caffinated, as I learned after sampling some!

I made this last night using bittersweet chocolate chips.  I didn't have wax paper, so I used aluminum foil and it worked fine.  I also left out the white chocolate sprinkled on top.  Delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!

Wow, that's a lot of coffee!  I found the coffee beans made this feel very gritty , and it tasted a little too bitter for me (I tend to drink heavily-sweetened  iced coffee or fraps).  On the other hand, my black-coffee drinking co-workers thought it was delicious, so obviously YMMV.  I used "blond" coffee beans, and reduced the amount of beans by about a third.

I used dark chocolate covered expresso beans instead of regular coffee beans. Our group of friends is coffee crazy, spending hours at a local coffee house together. I added the instant coffee to the chocolate as well. It was fabulous and was  a great addition to the custom baskets I am making for Christmas.

It looks great and taste great! I used 60% cocoa Ghiradelli chocolate instead of semi-sweet chocolate and drizzled Ghiradelli white chocolate on the top. The only disappointment after all that time spent is that my chocolate becomes limp at room temperature. I don't know what it is, but it melts in your hands when you pick it up. Must be the chocolate :-(

If you're a coffee fan looking for something quick, simple, and delicious, this is definitely the recipe for you. The sweet chocolate and the coffee are great and while I was initially worried about biting into the coffee beans, they actually provided a crunch that was surprisingly awesome.  That said, I think there are way too many coffee beans in this. I only used 1/4 cup of the whole coffee beans and it's strong, so the 3/4 that the recipe calls for would have been way too much for my tastes.   All in all, 5 star recipe.

MrB says, "You make some dang fine candy, Missy." I think next time I would melt the white chocolate and drizzle it, like I saw a few others do - a little prettier. Great recipe! Thanks!

The texture of my bark was not quite right.  The chocolate wasn't melting well in the microwave and I put it back in more than once.  I really think it is safer to use a double boiler!  Even with the texture off a little, the taste was great.  I did use a coarsely ground, flavored bean.  I got many compiments.  I stored it in a airtight container for 2 weeks.  It lasted a while because the pieces are rich and a little goes a long way.

OH my goooooooooodnessssss

i made this recipe, with some modification since i didn't
have all the correct ingredients, and it made something totally blissful.

i took milk chocolate (bark coating) and melted it in the microwave. then mixed into it a handful of butterscotch toffee flavored course ground coffee. i spread it into a foil lined 10x13 pan. then i melted white chocolate (bark coating), poured it into a sandwich bag, poked a hole in it and generously drizzled the milk chocolate with it. i grabbed half a handful of the coffee and sprinkled it
on top. then stuck it in the freezer for seven minutes. i broke it into pieces and put it in an air tight container.

it looks like something you see in the window of godiva. the texture is similar to a crunch bar, but less crunchy. and of course, using real chocolate instead of bark coating chocolate would make a more rich candy. but then you would have to add the butter to the chocolate when melting.

Made as written.  Fantastic way to use up several pounds of old coffee beans we acquired.  This will be a great switch up to add to my Christmas gift baskets this year.

I have made this several times, and everybody who has tried it has LOVED it! I melt my chocolate in a double boiler and I also melt the white chocolate and drizzle it on top instead of putting chunks on top. I also sprinkle slivered almonds on top. Thanks for the delicious recipe!

I used half the suggested amount of coffee beans and that was plenty for me. I ground the coffee coarsely this time for some crunch but I might try the finest setting next time for a different mouth-feel.

I love this recipe. It is great for holiday exchanges. I use dark chocolate and I use a food processor to chop up the espresso beans. I will be making it again and the scoring tip from the previous entry will be tried. When you try to break it apart it can get crumbly.

I reduced the amount of espresso beans and added halved almonds to come to a total of 3/4th cup total between the 2.  I also drizzled white chocolate on top.  It was a hit at work and with family!!

This recipe is almost too easy to make.  The 3/4 cups of coffee beans were a little too much for me and my coffee loving family, possibly shoot for a half cup especailly depending on the roast and boldness of the coffee. Otherwise, incredible idea.

This has WAY too much coffe in it. I am a coffee freak and love it so much I thought this is for me. Not unless you want a mouth full of coffee grounds. If that sounds good to you. Enjoy. It is a nice idea, but not done right in my book. Maybe try a a Tbs of instant coffee crystals mixed in and sprinkle a couple TBs of crushed coffee beans over the whole batch. Looks pretty, but you cant eat it. I was sad. :(

I ground up the coffee beans and melted 1C. of white chocolate chips for the top layer. I have found that cheap chocolate chips have more wax and dont melt as well.The ground coffee is a little gritty so I think I'll try 1/2 C. ground coffee next time.

Very good, but very STRONG.  I crunched up the beans a little but I probly shouldn't have done that...made it a little gritty but that was my fault.  The flavor was good though.  I used french roast.  Would make again!

Very yummy and fancy!  We wanted to make chocolate covered coffee beans, but this looked easier, and it was!  We used milk chocolate chips and coursely broke up the beans with a hammer.  After we spread it in the pan, we sprinkled it with white choc chips, let them sit a few minutes until warm and then swirled them with a toothpick.  We also sprinkled some crushed peppermint on top because dad likes peppermint coffee.

Absolutely tasty!  White chocolate chips worked fine; melted & drizzled white chocolate would also suffice.  However, I wish I would have read the other comments and coarsely ground the coffee beans first--whole, they're tough on the teeth.

You can customize this treat by choosing your favorite bean (I used vanilla hazelnut: delish!)  If you're not a coffee fan, simply subsitute another source of that satisfying crunch--your favorite nut, chow mein noodles, maybe even large chunks of graham cracker!

Overall, a wonderfully simple and delicious recipe.

I like to do this recipe in reverse. I use 2 cups of white chocolate as the base and then sprinkle with 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips.  I also used 1/4 cup of ground espresso instead the whole bean. Love the look of the ground espresso in the white chocolate.

If you use whole coffee beans, be prepared for the extreme crunch and texture--some people I gave this to didn't like it.  I used white chocolate chips and sprinkled them on top--pretty effect.

Everyone loves it, keep away from kids though or you'll pay! Blending the grounds fine went over better than the chunks, they got stuck in your teeth, for more flavors try different blends of coffee. Vanilla, hazelnut, Jamaican.
