To be perfectly honest I didn't think this would turn out but was I ever pleasantly surprised!  It was delicious.  I have never made cobblers with pie dough but this is going to be the beginning of many more. 
I didn't add any sugar at all, the juice from the peaches was plenty sweet enough.  I used two 24 ounce jars of canned peaches.  One jar was not enough to spread over a 13x9 inch pan. I rolled the dough into a sheet and placed over the top of the peaches.  While it baked the juices bubbled up and over parts of the crust and made a wonderful baked on gooey goodness. This was really good, I will make this again and again. Great recipe. I have a picture but it won't upload because it isn't big enough :-(

I will definitely make this again... I added a few blackberries at my son-in-laws request and it came out scrumptious..  It disappeared after dinner even though everyone said they were full from the meal..
