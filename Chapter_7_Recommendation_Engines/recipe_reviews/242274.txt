Very tasty! The chicken cooked up tender and juicy. The flavours were a wonderful treat ranging from the citrus and tomato to the nutty cinnamon. Thank you Craig Chandler for your recipe.

Will definitely make it again.  Very tasty and a little different flavor from what I am used to.  I made a few slight changes .. I added a more then a drop of hot sauce, gave the bottle a few good shakes.  I used three cinnamon sticks to simmer in the stew while cooking.  The biggest change was, I simmered it uncovered rather then covered.  The stew looked too watery, and I like a thicker stew.  It reduced nicely.

I have actually made this recipe many, many times. It's so easy and my husband, who is a picky eater, requests this meal. The only thing I change is I half the recipe and then add canned tomatoes instead of just tomato sauce because I think the stew needs the extra consistency that the tomatoes bring to the dish. It's so easy especially for people with young kids who need a meal fast or one that they can leave on the stove. Forever and always love this meal.

If youâ€™re looking for something a little different in a chicken dish, you may want to try this recipe.  The flavor profile is complex, and the chicken comes out moist and flavorful.  I deboned the chicken for ease in serving.

This recipe was just okay. It was bland and quite watery. Probably won't make this again.

I just made this recipe and the only change was that I had to substitute half of the white wine with chicken broth because I didn't have enough wine (didn't know what else to do).   It was so good!  My husband and daughter liked it, but I went back for seconds.  I served it with white rice.  This is a new way for me to make chicken and it was simple and tasty.   I'm so happy I found this recipe!
