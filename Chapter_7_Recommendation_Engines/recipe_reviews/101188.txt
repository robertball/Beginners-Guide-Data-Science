My German hubby loved this soup. I was pleased to make him a traditional German dish that he would like. Thanks!

The Soup with the cheese sauce was amazing.  I didn't like the dumplings and pulled them out.  With just the soup and the cheese sauce mixed in the soup was really good.

Wonderful soup! Even my picky-eater kids gobbled this up with joy! I made a few changes from the original, to suit our tastes: I omitted the dumplings, and used veggie stock in stead of water. I also pureed half of the veggies (after cooking in the broth for about 20 mins) in a food processor then stirred back into the pot to give the soup a more hearty, creamy consistency. I served with "Papa Drexler's Bavarian Pretzels", which are so easy and fun to make with kids. Delicious!!

Fantastic!   The only change I made to this was that I cut the salt by half across the board.   Half in the broth, half in the dumplings and half in the cheese sauce.   When I served it, it definitely needed more salt, but I think the recipe was excessive.   To make this again, I would still cut the salt in half in the broth and the dumplings, but would leave the salt full strength in the cheese sauce.   That still cuts  1 1/2 teaspoon of salt from the original recipe (288 milligrams of sodium per serving!).   The only other change I would recommend is some pepper, otherwise the recipe is perfect.   I will make this recipe again, reducing the salt by 1/2 in the broth and the dumplings.  Thank you for a keeper!
