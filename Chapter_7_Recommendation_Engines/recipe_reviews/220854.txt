I made Chef John's meatloaf a week or so ago and it was quite tasty which made me excited to try his meatball recipe. The bread crumbs I used in this recipe were made from homemade garlic-butter croutons and I cut back on the salt just a bit. To make uniform meat balls, I used my small cookie scoop. After baking my meatballs, I drained the fat off of them and added them to a homemade marinara and let them sit in the sauce for 20 minutes or so before I served them on pasta. The family really thought these were quite good. They held up well (to both cooking in the oven and sitting in the marinara) and had a nice flavor. Next time, I'd double the italian seasoning but that's really just personal to our family.

These meatballs were awesome! I added more breadcrumbs than the recipe called for, left out the red pepper, and used beef broth instead of milk. They were a big hit and I even posted a picture! Thanks Chef John!

CJ's Italian Meatballs Haiku: "I can't believe it. These beat 'Meatball Nirvana' And they held up too!" So my biggest praise for these meatballs is that after I made a double-batch, w/o changing the recipe, I froze them into weekly portions, but after thawing a handful of them in sauce last night, I couldn't have been more delighted that they held their meatball shape and didn't fall apart! So I don't know what of CJ's method, or ingredients, resulted in a firm (oh yes, and scrumptious!) meatball, but I think this recipe has replaced AR's 'Meatball Nirvana' in our house from now on.

Excellent meatballs! They are perfectly seasoned! I prefer to mix the bread crumbs with milk in a large bowl and allow it to rest for 20 minutes then mix in the eggs, parsley, parmesan cheese, the sautéed onions with garlic and all of the dry seasonings into this bowl. In a separate large bowl, I mix the beef and pork together then mix the contents of the previous bowl into the bowl of meat and place it into the fridge for an hour or so before forming the meatballs. I think that by doing so – everything mixes together more evenly. I find it impossible to mix the beef and pork together without using your hands, same goes for mixing the meat with the remaining ingredients. I didn’t notice any toughness in the meatballs by doing it my way. I’ve heard numerous times to not work ground beef too much otherwise the meat will turn tough. I don’t believe that myth. I use an ice cream scoop to form the meatballs and pack them into balls with wet hands. I added half of the cooked meatballs to a simmering pot of marina sauce and finished simmering them in the sauce for an hour. The remaining meatballs were put in a freezer bag and frozen for later use.

These meatballs were excellent! I followed the recipe as is.
No problems with it whatsoever. Thanks Chef John!

These are FANTASTIC meatballs! I used meatloaf mix, b/c it was cheaper (believe it or not) than buying the beef and pork seperately.  I also used seasoned breadcrumbs instead of plain and dried parsley in place of the fresh. Followed the recipe exactly otherwise and would not change a thing next time. I was scared b/c the mixture was so soft (even after refrigeration), but I proceeded on, and I am so glad I didn't add extra breadcrumbs like I wanted to...these held their shape and were so moist, tender, flavorful and delicious...one of the best I've made/eaten! I used my large cookie scoop and got 26 out of this recipe. My family RAVED over these...even my 10 month old twins couldn't get enough, lol. Seriously, these are sooooo good! I will def be using this recipe over and over~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I just took these out of the oven and they were swimming in liquid!!  They weren't browned or even close - the flavor of the meat is good but the consistency of the cooked meatballs is wrong - won't make again!

These tasted really good and were super easy to make.  Just a couple of things: I think next time I'll use maybe a 1/3 cup of milk as they were almost too juicy to form into balls.  Also, next time I will try baking them with a rack in the pan as they really did make a lot of grease and I think they would taste better without sitting in it.  Third, I wish they would have browned up a little better.  I even kept them in the oven for a few more mintutes at 450 and that didn't help.  But, again, the best tasting meatballs I've ever made.  Nothing wrong with the recipe as written, just personal preference, a five star recipe for sure!

Wow. This recipe is a keeper. I followed the recipe to a T and I wasn't disappointed. These meatballs were intended for sub sandwiches with marinara, but after tasting them fresh out of the oven, I felt like I was doing an injustice to this fine specimen of meat by slopping marinara over it. Thanks for the great recipe. I will be using this for years.

I made these mostly as written though I halved the recipe for my small family. They were the tastiest meatball I've ever tried! I chose to use all ground beef instead of with pork, and used 93% lean for a healthier choice. I loved that this didn't require the pan browning first. We ate these plain without a sauce with herb roasted potatoes and a salad, and it was such a tasty meal. The meatballs were very moist with a perfect texture. I'll make these from now on, and will also add these to my spaghetti sauce!

Ok I have already reviewed the Recipe, but I had to add this one too.  I came home from work and we were having Spaghetti with Meat Sauce. After a couple of bites, I said this was a terrific sauce and asked where my bride had gotten the recipe.  She smiled a little then told me how she was a little distracted when making the meatballs and how she just added the meat to the sauce pan with the onions, and when she realized what she had done it was too late.  Very Funny, so I think we stumbled on another Recipe "Chef John's Meat Sauce".

This was my first time ever making meatballs. I thought they were a bit of a pain and did not add anything to a recipe. But my husband specifically asked for meatballs with his spaghetti so I decided to try this one since it did not call for them to be cooked twice like every other meatball recipe I have ever read. I could not be happier than if I had not had to make them at all! This recipe was super easy and super tasty! These were as easy as making meat loaf and tasted better! I cut the recipe in half for just the two of us and put the full recipe amount of the herbs as my husband likes things spicy. Even the red pepper flakes. They were not too hot even for me and I cannot tolerate a lot of hot. I would cut them in half for children though. I was worried about the salt because I don't care for a lot of salt but I left it alone this first time except for cutting it in half thinking if it was too salty I would cut it next time. It was just right. We both loved this recipe. If you try only one meatball recipe make it this one you will not be sorry! Thank you Chef John for sharing this super good and super easy meatball recipe!

These meatballs were awesome! Like most other people, I did change a few things, but only because I didn't have the exact ingredients listed. I had 93/7% ground beef so I used 1 1/2 lbs of that and I was going to use 1/2 lb Jenni-O Sweet Italian Sausage with casings removed. But by accident I had bought Turkey Bratwurst. So I used 2 of them and mashed them thoroughly into the ground beef. I also used about 1tablespoon of dried parsley instead of fresh, only 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes. And when the onion was about finished cooking, I added the chopped garlic to bring out the flavor. For me, it made 28 meatballs and each was 2 Weight Watcher points plus. Since it's just my husband and myself, we have 2 more meals now in the freezer already in the sauce that I made and 16 more meatballs (without sauce) bagged in the freezer as well. Now we can have these delicious meatballs any time we want.

Best meatballs ever! These were delicious and hit the spot for the hubs who was craving spaghetti & meatballs. Instead of using plain ground pork I used groung italian sausage (mild). After baking them I let them simmer in marinara with sliced italian sausage to meld the flavors. We had leftover meatballs so made meatball subs for lunch the next day. Even better the second day. Will definitely make this recipe again!

Huge hit w/the boys here! Easy & quick to make. I didn't precook the onions, just chopped them fine in my mini chopper & threw them in. Decreased the salt & pepper by 1/2 as a personal preference.

Delicious meatballs.  I have always baked my meatballs.  It gives them a great flavor and makes it easier to cook and to cleanup.  The only change I made was to use only ground beef instead of beef and pork mixture, its just a personal preference.  Thanks for the recipe Chef John.

I've made big batch meatballs this way for the freezer for  years, and I use all the ingredients here except for the olive oil and salt. I never make less than 5 lb meat at a time, and this makes about 6 quart size freezer bags of 30 meatballs each. I don't really measure seasonings anymore, I just eyeball them. I do have a rule of 1 egg to 1 lb meat, and no more than 1 C of filler to 5 lb meat. The rest I wing to taste, as many of the 600+ reviewers also do.  I mix the fillers, seasonings, liquids, and eggs in a big mixing bowl, then add the meat and mix thoroughly. I don't precook anything, and it all comes out of the oven very tender. I use cookie scoops, small for spaghetti and large for subs, to scoop out a  half sheet pan of balls, then go back and roll them. I bake at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes, pull out the tray, drain grease, then use a spatula to loosen the balls and shake them around at bit. Back in the oven until well browned (sometimes need to broil a bit), and drain again before cooling and packing in freezer bags. My husband likes meatballs, and this is the most painless way for me to satisfy his craving. I think this recipe is more about process and less about amounts as everyone's taste is a bit different.

O so delish. Loved them. I did add more Italian seasoning, about TBL. Also added more garlic, about 4 gloves. Served them on steak Italian rolls. Put provolone cheese on rolls then put under broiler until melted. Um Um good. Thanks Chef John for the recipe.

I tried these meatballs for the first time today.  I made them exactly according to the recipe like I always do when I try something for the first time.  Whenever I am looking for a particular recipe I always try Chef John's first so this was a little disappointing. 

I'd like to make a few comments that others can use or take with a grain of salt (excuse the pun):

1.The red pepper didn't make the meatballs spicy or hot so I   
  wouldn't hesitate to use it again.
2.The meatballs were not "Italian" enough for me so I, like others,
  would increase the Italian spices or use fresh & 4 cloves of 
  garlic would have been better than three.
3.The onions only took about 10 minutes to become transparent.  You
  don't want them to brown and taste like "fried" onions so watch
  carefully.
4. The recipe had too much onion and made them taste like
   meatloaf.  I would cut back or eliminate next time.
5. I felt 40 smaller meatballs would be better in the sauce. I made
   thirty but they seemed big. 
6. Mine browned only slightly but I didn't keep them in longer as I
   didn't want them to dry out. May try 450 degrees & decrease the   
   time if I decrease size.
7. I used at least 1/2 cup of parsley, pressed down, and it was fine. 

Question: Any tips on how to keep them from going flat on the
          bottom?

All in all a pretty good recipe I will try again.  Video shows good instructions for forming and mixing. 

Thanks Chef John.

This is honestly the best meatball recipe around! If you use the suggested ingredients and assemble the meatballs as Chef John suggests you will have tasty, juicy, flavorful meatballs every time! They also freeze well and are just as good reheated.

I made this recipe for appetizers, so I made the balls about 1". I baked the meatballs on a cookie cooling rack on the baking sheet so the grease drains off, plus the heat circulates around the meatballs (350 for 12 minutes). They are perfect! Very tasty! I plan to reheat the meatballs in marinara sauce on New Years.

He knew the battle had been won, but at what cost? The destruction made the thought of a Pyrrhic victory pleasurable. An impossible luxury. The dust settled, the expectant groans and echoing screams of such a fight rang in his head but the grounds offered only silence. There were no survivors. Evil incarnate. The scorched Earth salted by the blood of the aggressors sucked the spectrum of light into its depths, reflecting back the closest resemblance of Hell even Mother Earth could not comprehend of the once bountiful pasture. Lucifer himself winced at the sight, and far be it from any being to assume him a coward. You would do the same. 

Who is to blame, he thought. Blame? An irrelevant childish concept. Had simply one more meatball been crafted, baked, seared to absolute undeniable juicy perfection, perhaps I wouldn't be telling this story. The story of the time I served John's meatballs at my neighborhood potluck. Chef John's Italian meatballs.

Quite good. This recipe makes a lot. If you're not feeding a crowd, I recommend using the leftover meat in "Chef John's Stuffed Peppers", which are super good

This recipe is super and easy. It is the homemade taste I have been looking for. I made a few changes due to what I had on hand. I used 2 lbs. beef and 1 lb. Italian sausage. instead of fresh parsley and garlic I substituted with 3 teaspoons garlic salt with parsley in it and held the salt as well. The rest of the ingredients were increased by 50% to accommodate the extra beef. I got 60 meatballs out of my batch!

These meatballs were the BOMB!  I have never made meatballs before that were very good.  I have tried with similar ingredients but never had a good result.  These would also be great in meatball sandwiches, because they were so flavorful.  FWIW, I did not chill the meatballs because my ingredients were already cold and I was hungry!  I made them about 2" in size.  And I did use fresh parsley.  Love this recipe!

My Sicilian husband said these were the best meatballs he ever tasted - even better than his mother's - and in 10 years of marriage, I've never heard him say that about anything! I pretty much stuck to the recipe, but did add a pound of mild Italian sausage and a package of chopped Prosciutto (and increased the rest of the ingredients 1 1/2 times to make up for the increase in protein). Sorry John, but I think that made a big difference in the flavor! I would strongly recommend at least adding the sausage - it makes a big impact!

I've made these twice now, and I don't think I'll ever bother to look for another recipe. For years -- well, decades -- I've gotten frustrated trying to fry meatballs without them falling apart, and they always turn out a bit tough if you get them dry enough to hold together. With these, the mixture is a bit wet, but it doesn't matter at all because they're baked, like miniature meat loaves, which is what good meatballs should be anyway. They're easy to make, turn out terrific -- tender and flavorful -- and cleanup is a snap as long as you use wide, heavy-duty foil so it completely covers the pan and doesn't tear. These will be a new standard in our house.

I had to add more bread crumbs ( the good Italian ones that we all use.) I did not have parm cheese on hand ( oops.) I did his cooking method. I wanted to just throw them in the sauce uncooked. I only made 20 balls . wife loves big balls.......so I saved half the balls for another noodle journey. excellent balls!

This was delicious! I will definitely be making these again. I halved the recipe, using 1 lb ground beef (I didn't have any pork on hand) and got 18 meatballs. I added the garlic to the onions about halfway through the cooking time, and used Italian breadcrumbs. Thank you, CJ!

BEST MEATBALLS EVER!!!
My 6-yr-old hates meatballs, but I made her try one of these anyway. She went back & attempted to load her plate down with as many as she could get!

I did make one major change to this recipe: Spinach. Instead of the ground pork, I used a 10-oz pkg of chopped spinach (squeeze all the water out after thawing). I had to stop myself from eating these before dinnertime! YUMMY!!!!!

This is a great recipe.  Very similar to something that I've comeup with myself, without the parsley and cheese.  The recipe I mad, I used hot italian sausage rather than pork sausage (which I've used in the past), I didn't have milk so I used buttermilk powder and water, and I didn't have straight Parmesan so I used an Italian blend.  My end result was fantastic, but really the choice of a pork sausage rather than my choice of a hot Italian sausage (what the recipe called for) would have been much better.  Milk vs. Buttermilk and Parmesean verses my Italian man x (good quality) were not important.  The texture, moistness and general flavor (ignoring the hot Italian sausage) was absolutely FABULOUS....I will absolutely make this again withwhat the recipe calls for....ground pork, not my substitution of hot Italian sausage.  This is a fabulous recipe, only flawed by my on substitution.

These were amazing meatballs. My daughter considers herself a meatball connoisseur and she rates these a 5 as well. I too used more beef to pork ratio; approx 60/40 due to personal taste. Used convection bake setting and turned the meatballs halfway through baking. It gave them beautiful brown colour. Using extra lean ground beef and lean ground pork resulted in very little meatball shrinkage or greasy run-off.

These were the best!  We used 2 lbs of beef and 1 lb pork,  everything else the same.  They were awesome.  We freeze ours into smaller portions with our foodsaver,  and just pop them into the crock pot around noon in sauce for them to be ready for dinner!  We use grass fed beef and local pork from a local farm too.  I feel much better about eating these than store bought!

This is now my homemade Italian meatball recipe; I will never use another recipe. I had no issues with the meatballs being too "liquidy", and there was hardly any grease at the bottom of the baking pan once they were done cooking. I love that he has us cook the onion before adding it to the mix - I don't like crunchy chunks of onion in my meatballs, which is how my mother's were (sorry Mom). This is a great base recipe - add different spices and amounts to your liking. As a side note, I always know I've found a good recipe when my husband asks, "Hey, how'd you make that?!" He even says the recipe is a keeper, and so it shall be. Thanks for sharing it.

WOW!  These are the best Italian meatballs I've ever had.  Left out the parsley because I didn't have, and decreased the red pepper flakes because my family doesn't like.  Still, just pure yumminess!

I made half this recipe to try it out.  I used hot Italian sausage that I took out of the casing, along with the ground beef.  I didn’t sauté the onions, but rather diced them very finely and just added them to the mixture.  After refrigerating for an hour, the meat mixture was still quite loose and I wondered if the meatballs would hold their shape.  Well, they did and were done in 15 minutes in my oven.  I liked the softer texture of these, but I may try a different ground sausage next time.  Thanks for the recipe, Chef John.

These are by far the BEST meatballs!  Everyone raves over them.  I like to make a big batch, cook them and freeze.  They are my go to.  Cook them all the time!  Great for meatball grinders too.

I made these meatballs for dinner this evening, and they were absolutely fantastic. I used ground beef and ground turkey but otherwise followed the recipe. My husband loved them, also. I will definitely make these again.

These meatballs are fantastic! I make a double recipe and then freeze them - they make a great, easy weeknight meal because they defrost quickly or just throw them in some sauce to simmer.  I use half the salt, italian breadcrumbs and Jimmy Dean Sage sausage.  YUM!  Another trick is to use a small fruit/cookie scoop (mini ice cream scoop) to make the meatballs instead of  using your hands - much neater and quick!

Yet another great recipe from Chef John!!  Made these for meatball bombers.  I left out the red pepper flakes and doubled the batch.  Definitely use foil as these are messy while baking.  They were gone in 2 days with 4 of us eating them.

We have allergies at our house (corn, dairy, and tree nuts) so I am always looking for recipes that I can adapt.  These meatballs were perfect even adapted to our needs!  I left out the parm cheese and used slightly ground oatmeal (instead of bread crumbs) soaked in hemp milk.  Otherwise, I used the same seasonings.  Meatballs still held up in the sauce and taste so great!!

I started to make this recipe exactly as the recipe states but had tremendous issues after adding the eggs.  It produced a rather loose mixture that I could not roll up.  I did use eggs from my chickens so the sizing may have been off but the recipe does not mention egg size.  I used 2 large eggs and I shall change that to 2 medium eggs next time.  I ended up having to add a lot more breadcrumbs to make up for the wetness of the mixture.  As others had mentioned I regret not cooking these on a tray that would drain the grease.  Also something I will do next time.
Overall great flavour. After my adjustment they held together and held their shape.  I did cook the meatballs for a little longer than specified but more to time with the rest of the meal.  I wish I had taken them out at the right time (tasted and they were perfect) as they ended up a little chewy leaving them in for a little longer.
Thanks for sharing.  I will be making again.

Phenominal! This is comfort food at its best! Only made slight adjustments...used gluten free bread crumbs & 1/2 cup ground parmagiano reggiano cheese (cuz I bought it and was bound to use it!). I also blended all dry ingredients together (including garlic & cheese) & separately blended lightly beaten eggs to the milk/bread crumb mixture before adding each to the meat mixture. (This was so I would have to handle the meat less.) Also, I made a test burger to check taste & consistency... it just needed a little more bread crumbs. It melted in my mouth! After baking 'til browned, into the simmering marinara sauce they went...heart be still...Loved it!

I've been looking for the right meatball recipe ever since the cooking duties fell to me when I became a stay at home dad.  This one nails it perfectly for me.  No more frozen meatballs for this family!

These meatballs are delicious.  I used 2# ground beef and no pork and left out pepper flakes.   Baked them as directed and cooled.  Served them on a long loaf of French bread which I had removed some bread so the meatballs would nestle in the loaf.   Before adding meatballs spread a light coating of pesto on top and bottom, added meatballs and topped with provolone.   Added another very light coating of pesto to top of loaf. Wrapped in foil and baked for 30 -40 minutes at 350.   This sandwich was a huge hit with my family.   Served with hot broccoli cauliflower beer cheese soup and tossed salad.

The combination of great texture and taste makes this a standout winner. With countless reminders over the years, it’s no secret most Italian Americans believe their grandmother makes the best Italian meatballs. Chef John somehow figured out which one was the real deal, and pried it away from her. Great job, Chef John.

I've made these three times.  They are excellent just as the recipe is written.

The third time I made them I added a little more crushed red pepper.  After they cooked in the oven I simmered them a marinara sauce for a few hours then froze the leftovers.  I LOVE these.  Yummy!!!

Next time I'm going to make a few large ones and have them in a sub/hogie/grinder roll with sauce and mozzarella cheese melted on top.

PS. I typically get 30-35 meatballs with this recipe.

My family went crazy over these meatballs!  I was able to make 18 with this recipe-I like a nice size meatball!  The only ingredients I changed was the meat.  I used 1lb ground beef and 1lb ground Sweet Italian sausage.  Will be making these is batches and freezing them.

I did tweak this recipe a bit. I didn't saute the onion, put it in the food processor (after I made my bread crumbs), and then added all of the wet ingredients with the bread crumbs and let it sit. I added the meat and mixed all together by hand. The meat mixture was a bit loose (wet) and I thought it would be a mess, but they were great!!!  I'm sure the flavor would have been even better had I sauteed the onion.  This will be my go-to recipe for meatballs!

theae are the bomb.  Hubby got up in the night and ate another plate.  Made very few changes due to personal taste( no black pepper or pepper flakes, more parmesan and added minced green pepper).  Cooked the meatballs and cut up italian sausage in cheap canned sauce in the oven, let it cool and skimmed the fat, awsome.

I just made these...and like another reviewer said I used a small ice cream scoop (actually the small pampered chef cookie scoop) to make the balls...made it soooo easy.  Saved a ton of time.  They had great flavor.  I've tried several different meatball recipes and this one is by far my favorite.  They have a little bite from the pepper flakes (might want to omit for kids) other than that I wouldn't change a thing...thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe Chef John!

I didn't have onion powder on hand, so I used a large onion sautéed in the olive oil.  I usually make my meatballs using the boxed onion soup mix, so these were a little bland for me!  I'm not sure I like baking the meatballs vs. frying them, I used a rack on the cookie sheet, but still had to rest the meatballs on paper towels afterwards to soak up the grease.  Not sure how much that saves on fat calories, hopefully it does, because it's just as much work and clean up.  I would probably make these again, just make sure I have all the ingredients.

Hmmmm, delicious! I used this recipe to make a meatloaf. It was so tasty and everyone like it. Can't wait to try it as meatballs. The only thing I HAD to change was I to use all beef, (allergy). I really liked the flavor of all the right on spices, and I also liked the moistness of the meatloaf, it was not dense but held nicely. Out with my old recipe and in with this one. Thank you Chef John!

I left a review saying I did not like these when they came out of the oven. Said to much Italian season. UPDATE: I put these in my home made sauce and cooked for an hour. Excellent! The Italian seasoning didn't overpower the meatball, they were tender and juicy. Even got a UMMM from Hubby! Will without a doubt make these again!

We had to make a few diet modifications but this recipe is AMAZING!! One of my sons is gluten-free & another is dairy-free so I had to use gf 'bread' crumbs and unsweetened almond milk. I had 2 lbs ground beef, no ground pork, but this recipe is so solid that even with all of these changes it still ROCKED. I have made it twice and it was perfect both times. Thank you Chef John!! It's a crowd-pleaser, even for my hubby & oldest son who have no dietary restrictions.

First time making meat balls. Lets just say I have only sucessfully made meatloaf once where it did NOT fall apart lol. These meatballs stayed in form! I did not have any breadcrumbs so I googled and used oatmeal instead and added 3 eggs in place of two. I used all hamburger no pork. I also used almond milk in place of cow's milk and added Chicago Steak & Chop cracked pepper and garlic blend to the mix as well. Def will be making these again, my 7yr old is always upset I do not make meatballs in our speghetti so now I have a recipe that doesn't crumble on me.

Very easy and fast to make. I baked the meatballs and tossed them in to simmer with sauce for subs. They held their shape very nicely, and were perfect on our meatball subs. My kids didn't love the occasional spice from the red pepper but ate the whole pan of meatballs anyway. This one is a keeper!

Recipe yield was 31 meatballs for me. Used a small ice cream scoop so they were uniform size. Although not seared on the outside like pan fried they were very good and stayed together well in the sauce.  Were going to do meatball subs, add some mozzerella  with the left overs.  Keep hands wet when shaping, makes them smooth and stay together.  Will definately make them again.

Delicious!  Meatballs held their shape nicely and stood up to slow cooking in my pot of gravy.  I used home made breadcrumbs, subbed my own broth for the milk and used fresh herbs in place of the dry.  I did add a considerable amount more of crushed red pepper and skipped the salt due to dietary restrictions.  I used soy Parmesan cheese as well.  Great recipe and it  easily amended to my needs.

My Son chose this recipe for one of his cooking course categories, so he had to follow the recipe to a tee. First of all it was fun to watch him do this all by himself. But he did a great job and the meatballs turned out amazing! Would not change the recipe one bit. But we did used the basic ideas of this recipe to make burgers. Whoa, loved it!!!!

Finally decided to make some instead of the frozen ones I normally buy. These were phenomenal! The only thing I did different was use all beef instead of the beef/pork combo. Besides that I followed all seasonings as listed - it was perfect! Will make many more times to come!

Substitutions / Additions: 
(1) subbed panko for regular breadcrumbs (worked great); (2) added 3-4 TBSP extra Panko; (3) added 1 TBSP extra italian seasoning; and (4) used 1/2 Vidalia onion instead of whole onion.

Cooking Notes: 
Made 2" meatballs, so they took a little longer to cook.  Would use parchment instead of foil next time.  Turned once halfway through cooking to brown both sides.  Ran under the broiler for a minute to give a little extra browning at the end.  

Simmered in marinara and served over a little chickpea pasta.  Hearty and filling meal.

Made with veal, pork and beef as mentioned in the option. No other changes. These were delicious, not too spicy but full of flavor. I may have made them a bit small because they were a little dry but think that was my error. They keep well in the freezer. Am going to try them again, making them a little bigger. A keeper for sure.

Firm and flavorful!  Using my cookie scoop this made 62 meatballs. I made a pan of 24 and froze the rest.  Delicious recipe!  Next time I will switch out the milk for beef broth as suggested.

These meatballs were very simple to make and the end result is delicious.  I loved baking them in the oven because cleaning the pan consisted of throwing out the tin foil used to line it.  I used more garlic than what is called for and when I make them again may even substitute the onion with shallots and change up the spice mix/ratio.  I also used seasoned breadcrumbs instead of plain.  All in all a great base recipe for meatballs that you can surely make your own.

Really happy with these. Don't even need to eat them with sauce. 

I did take other reviews into account and only added 1/3 cup milk instead of 1/2 which I think worked out well. 
I put the mix in the fridge which I think made forming the balls easier.

Yup,  very good.  I made a half batch (live alone) and made a meatball sub with Kay's sauce (recipe also here).  It'll make several future lunches and be made often

I love it! I used 2 pounds of beef and eliminated the pepper flakes.  To make them in a hurry after I mixed all the ingredients I browned in a skillet and then moved to the oven for 20 min at the specified 425.  They are wonderful done in a jiffy!

Made this for dinner and they were the best meatballs ever. I made only a couple of changes. I  added 5 chopped,  fresh basil leaves and I pan seared them and let them finish cooking in my homemade Marinara Sauce. My husband said it was better than going to a restaurant especially with my homemade garlic rolls.

I can tell you that these are the best meatballs I have ever made! Turned out absolutely wonderful. Now there is no need to search for any other meatball recipe. Thank you Chef John!!

We just finished dinner using these meatballs. They are excellent. Great flavor and I did not have a lot of oil left on cookie sheet after cooking them. My husband said "tasty" after eating them. (He hardly EVER expresses his opinion after eating).Defiantly 5 stars!

Everyone in my family loved these meatballs!  I followed the directions for the most part but deviated slightly with the seasonings- I  took the advice of another reviewer and increased the Italian seasonings to 1/2 tsp of basil, 1/2 tsp of oregano, and 1/4 tsp of thyme. I used fresh parsley and garlic and. Tsp of sugar. Wow! These were the best recipe I have followed on AR and will make these again and again.  I will cut back on the amount of salt used- they were a tiny bit too salty for our tastes.

This has become our go-to recipe for meatballs.  We make huge batches, bake them all off and then freeze by the dozen in food saver bags.  That way when we want some we just pop the entire food saver bag in the boiling water along with our spaghetti to reheat, heat some sauce and Manga manga!!  

The one change we make is that we do brown them in a skillet first.  It gives them a nice brown color and crust.  I know Chef John says you can skip this step - and you can - but it really shouldn't be skipped in our opinion.

They were delicious. However, I only put them in the fridge for half an hour. When I was rolling them up into balls, the meat seemed a little watery. Other than that,  my family loved it and I plan on definitely making them again.

These were really good. Only thing was the meatballs lost half their size while cooking.  Next time I'll use a leaner meat or make them bigger and put them on a cake rack or broil pan so they're not sitting in so much liquid at the end.

These were delicious. I halved the recipe and used all beef as pork is difficult to get where I live. Everything else I followed exactly. They held their shape wonderfully, even after sitting overnight in tomato sauce. These are my new "go to" meatballs from now on!

Amazing recipe. I stick them in the oven for about 15 minutes at 375, then freeze them. When I need them, I stick them in a crockpot on low for about four hours in tomato sauce. They hold up well and taste SO GOOD.

I made these meatballs for my husband's birthday and they were fantastic!  I omitted the red pepper flakes (personal choice),used dried parsley instead of fresh and used 1-3/4 pounds of 20% ground beef (it's all I had in the house) and they still came out great.  I will definitely be making these again, I can't wait for dinner!

I made this last night and it was unbelievable!!!  I added more garlic and the same amount of parsley. Used venison, beef,pork and veal. Used or homemade sauce made from heirloom tomatoes we grow. Flavor! Flavor! Flavor!

The recipe was perfect!  I've never soaked the breadcrumbs before and it was a great idea.  These were the most moist meatballs I've ever had!

OMG! These are the best meatballs! My niece and I made them and they were to die for. I later modified the recipe and made a meatloaf. It was equally fantastic!

Phenomenal! I doubled the recipe,thankfully, and used equal parts beef/country sausage and spicy Italian sausage - followed everything else to the T. My husband needed me to run an errand for him, but his disclaimer was: "...unless you need time to make more spaghetti and meatballs!" : ) The ULTIMATE compliment from the man who has made my favorite meatballs for 20 years! Even my 12 yr old son gobbled them up...I froze the leftover meatballs 2 days ago and already had to thaw and make more sauce to accommodate them, as my son wanted more!

Hi Chef.  I didn't have fresh parsley on hand so I guesstimated a heaping Tbls of dried, and while I had nice freshly ground beef in the freezer the only pork I had was sweet Italian sausage, otherwise I followed your recipe.  I love the bread crumb soaked in the milk Method you showed me.  Thank you for a superb recipe, these meatballs are amazing!

This is my first time writing a review.  My husband and I loved these meatballs.  I made 19 meatballs using and ice cream scoop measuring 2 1/4 inches.   I also used panko  crumbs instead of pain bread crumbs.  Instead of regular milk I used up my half & half.    I put the meatballs that were left over (fully cooked) on a cookie sheet and put them in the freezer and then placed them in a zip lock bag.   This recipe is a five star. 
These are the best meatballs.   Judy4   11-7-14

I used a pack of ground beef and a pack of  mild Italian sausage, all other ingredients readily available.  These little beauties stopped DH when he walked through the door with a "please tell me that smell is coming from our stove and not a candle"!  I always follow a recipe as written unless I am forced to sub an item because I simply do not have it.  I followed this to the letter.  I made homemade bread to go with, tossed a salad and it was the best Italian night ever. There was plenty leftover even after I packed some for DH's lunch. Still had a lot to go into the freezer for another meal.  I have deleted all other meatball recipes.  They were simply taking up space.  This is meatball heaven!

These turned out super tasty and moist. I baked on parchment paper and it wasn't a soggy mess. Make sure to give yourself the time to let the mixture sit in the fridge for and hour, really helps the mixture hold together. Thanks!

These are amazing! I follow the recipe exactly and I always make one pan of tiny meatballs and freeze them since my kids(5, 6, 10 yrs old) love to warm them up and take to school for lunch. Thanks for the recipe!

i changed a lot about this recipe. i used only one pack of ground turkey, garlic salt instead of garlic or salt, extra bread crumbs, still two eggs, some catsup for tang and 2 tablespoons of red wine to bring out the flavour, and added oregano and sage and no italian seasoning, and.. it tasted incredible!! i basically used the recipe as a base and added my own touch. still my whole family was obsessed with the great flavour!! :D

These meatballs are delicious! I have been lazy recently and have been buying meatballs made a a little local grocery store. I decided to try these and will not be going back! I mixed them up on Sunday and then baked them tonight after work while the pasta cooked and I put salad onto plate. They really are that fast. And man, do they taste good! Thanks, Chef John, I'll buy a big package of meat next time and make a big batch so I can have my own meatballs in the freezer for quick weeknight meals.

Excellent, Chef John does it again.  I didn't have ground pork but I had some Italian sausage, so I left out the Italian herbs.  I figure they'd be pretty close.  They were great.  My Dad who never says anything unless you pry it out of him popped up and said "Hey, these aren't bad, not bad at all."  That's as good as you get from him.

Only but the best from Chef John. These are the best meatballs I have ever tasted. Made them tonite for dinner and everyone devoured them! I made them for meatball subs but they were so good by themselves it didn't matter. Easy to make, I teamed with with a kale salad and it was a perfect dinner! Thank you again Chef John for an outstanding recipe!! :)

So delicious!!!!! I used a meatloaf mix for the meat, and left out the fresh parsley and red pepper flakes. I baked them for 15 minutes and they were perfect. I used a disher and it made 27 meatballs. Next time I will cut out a little of the salt, but other than that, I wouldn't change a thing!

Absolutely fantastic! I have lived in the US for about 4 years and meatballs have been the hardest challenge so far...  UNTIL NOW!!! I always thought it was just some difference in the meat between here and Europe but I am certain now - it all boils down to the spices! The combination of those here is simply amazing! The only things I changed were the olive oil (put less) and the eggs (used egg whites instead). I did not put thyme in but only 'cos I didn't have any. They did take longer to cook (about 30 min) and my oven usually cooks faster than average, so I'll have to keep that in mind for future reference. But overall - this recipe is a keeper! Thank you for sharing!

Best meatball recipe I've ever made. Not much competition since I've never made meatballs before! ;) the meatballs were flavorful, moist, tender, easy to make, and browned up well in the oven. The recipe is a keeper for sure!

Excellent! I used Italian breadcrumbs, added two table spoons of worcestershire sauce to the milk, and used lean ground beef so they weren't swimming in liquid like another reviewer said. Thank you!

I made these last night for spaghetti. So delicious! My boyfriend was so impressed he took a few for his Italian friend to try at work today.  I did use roasted garlic breadcrumbs because that's what I had on hand. I also used ground Italian sausage instead of plain ground pork. Turned out very well!  To avoid greasiness, I used a broiler pan instead of a cookie sheet.  I've never soaked the breadcrumbs or refrigerated the mixture before when making meatballs,  but I will definitely be using this recipe from now on!!

I grind my own pork, chicken or turkey meats. I used 1.5 lbs (1/3 each) ground chicken, pork and 85% grnd beef. I use ground pork rinds or coconut flour for a binder with heavy cream as I am doing Keto.  I upped the seasonings a bit and instead of salt I used beef bouillon granules. I skipped cooking onions; used 2 t dried minced onions instead. I adjusted some ingredients due to using 3/4 of meat called for (24 oz). Oh yes, I make the mixture a day in advance to allow all flavors to develop. I baked at 375 for 12 mins, flipped, turned oven off and let em ride for 15 more with oven off
 I shape mine a bit larger then golf ball size. Great stuff CJ!  I wet my hands a few times while rolling raw meat s so none of that sticks to my hands.
If your making extra: let cool completely b4 freezing. Otherwise for some reason they turn out dry and dense.

Good flavor. Waaaaay too much onion.  Very loose, too.  Meat did not hold well together.  Will make again, but will make my own adjustments.

Wow! These meatballs are full of flamer and moist. Perfect with traditional marinare O, Alfredo or on their own. I doubled the recipe and ended with 24-2" meatballs. The key to holding together is in soaking the breadcrumbs.

I’ve deleted all other meatball recipes I saved. These are delicious with right spice combination. Have to quickly freeze some before we eat them all!

i love this recipe, i had to make it a few times before i got them to actually stick together. i ended up buying 90% lean ground beef rather than 80% and i also used a 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs rather than the 1/3 cup. i HIGHLY recommend adding the zest of a whole lemon to this recipe...brings the flavors to a new level!

Still 5 star, but next time I'll use a lot less salt, and no pepper flakes. I think they belong in things that marinate for a long period of time to season the WHOLE dish, not just a few bites that are too hot.

It took a little longer than I had planned on cooking  but it was well worth it. The family loved them even my picker eater.  I added the meatballs to spaghetti tomato sauce and pasta.. It was a great dinner. I will certainly cook this again.

Followed the directions with all ingredients and was very happy with the outcome.  With the onion, I didn't feel like sautéing it so I just grated it along with the garlic - that way I didn't have the chunks of onion in there.  I used these to make meatball subs and since I had a lot of leftovers I added them to some sauce with pasta.  I'll definitely be using this recipe again.

These are the bomb.  I substituted mild Italian sausage for the pork, omitted the red pepper flakes and added garlic pepper seasoning in lieu of Italian seasoning.  Paired with homemade tomato-based sauce and pasta...divine!

After 20 minutes in oven, I turned temp. down to 250 and left for 10 min. then turned oven off and left in for 10 min. more. Prior to serving, I seared them in a hot iron skillet with some olive oil. Served over spaghetti with homemade red sauce , and fresh grated parmesan. It was very good with just the right amount of spice from the crushed red pepper.

Everyone liked this, and that was without the pork mix in. Split the sizes made between large and smaller for different meals. Usually broil the meatballs when done to give them a darker coating.

These meatballs have rightfully earned the amount of five-star ratings they have.  They are moist and flavorful with just the right amount of spice. 
If you really want to turn the yum factor up, fry them in oil instead of baking.  That's how all the Italian women in my family make meatballs.  Baking is considered to be how you cook meatballs in an industrial kitchen to serve hundreds  of people - not a method for home cooking.

I love this meatball recipe as written except parchment paper is suggested to line baking pan. 
Parchment paper is only recommended up to 420 degrees.  This recipe is 425 degrees.  Just sayin’!

I definitely love this recipe with the following mods if flavor rather than calorie count is what you’re after:
- use heavy whipping cream instead of milk or water
- use mix of cheese instead of just Parmesan 
- use 1/3 parts beef, pork, and lamb (even if you don’t care for lamb on its own, the mix is amazing)
- add cut up spicy Italian sausages to the tomatoes sauce you cook thr meatballs in

Very easy and flexible recipe. I had too much beef and not enough pork, but it was fine. Same with the "Italian seasonings" that I didn't have, but I used some oregano, basil, marjoram. Very forgiving!

The only change I made was due to the fact that we had 1.5 lbs. of ground pork in the freezer. I purchased 1.5 lbs. of ground beef, adjusted the recipe for the increased amount and followed everything as written. I'll be freezing many of the meat balls for future use. 
The meatballs are very good and I will probably make them again. This recipe is a definite keeper.

I've had better meatballs in family run Italian restaurants, but these are the best I've ever made. I LOVE meatballs but have struggled to find a recipe that is close to an Italian restaurant. These are as close as it gets!

I was a little worried about how they would turn out give then consistency of the meat mixture while forming the balls. The mixture was very soft and difficult to form into balls. But I made it happen! The flavor is simply amazing, and the soft mixture gives way to a super tender (and juicy) meatball. 

I followed the recipe 100% for the majority of meatballs. I did take 5 balls and throw them in a hot pan with some olive oil to get a little crust on them. While it's a 5-star recipe as is, I will definitely brown the meatballs in a pan going forward. That little bit of crust adds a little something for me. 

Great recipe!

As written by Chef John, these are My-T-Fine.  Best meatball I've ever had in my 60+ years on this planet.  Meatball Nirvana has been dislodged,  Chef John's Italian Meatballs recipe occupies that place!  Even my selective-eater 9-YO granddaughter gave these a "delicious!" grade.

I made this recipe with some tweaks . I used Italian bread rolls  and soaked  them in milk instead of breadcrumbs . I also used fresh grated Parmesan and Romano mix and added fresh grated nutmeg. As far as cooking them browned them in cast iron skillet to achieve nice caramelization then placed in oven for 15 mins. Soft and favorful and goes excellent with homemade sauce.

These meatballs are fabulous especially the next day.  I did make Chef John's spaghetti sauce and cooked the meatballs in it for an hour or so.  I did as Chef John suggested by baking the meatballs in the oven.  They were great and so easy rather than frying.

I have been looking for a solid meatball recipe and after trying several this is the one.  It’s very flavorful and the red pepper flakes  adds a subtle kick. I left mine in the fridge for a few hours before shaping into meatballs and they were easy to work with. Very flavorful-this is a keeper.

I made these with beef only (no pork). Everybody loved them! Good with or without sauce, and can be served as a part of main dish or as hors d'oeuvres.

3.5* stars.  Doubled recipe.  2/3 C Panko bread crumbs, 1C milk, 2 palms dried minced onion, 2# beef (80/20), 1# Italian sausage, 1# Jimmy Dean regular sausage, 4 eggs,  1/2 palm dried parsley,  2 large serving spoons full of minced garlic, 1/2 palm red pepper flakes, 1 palm Italian herbs,  2 capfuls of Parmesan cheese, 1 palm celery leaves. Used ice cream scooper to make even sized meatballs. Cooked 25 mins flipped cooked 15 more min. Needed every bit of the 40 mins to be done.  If I make again I won’t use ice cream scooper, so smaller meatballs would be smaller and cook faster.  I’m a huge fan of Meatball Nirvana, probably won’t make this again.  Can’t say it’s the recipe’s fault as I didn’t follow exactly.

We doubled the recipe (actually, ended up with three pounds of pork to two pounds of hamburger--Thanks, Walmart) because we were feeding a crowd of young men dinner.  The only other change was to leave out the parsley, because I forgot to get some. Everything else was  faithfully followed and oh, my God, these were fantastic! I am not a meatball fan, but I love Chef John's recipes and when my sons asked for meatball subs, he was where I turned.

After they came out of the oven, we put six of them on half a loaf of Italian bread, covered them in a smooth tomato sauce, and topped them with mozzarella, then put them under the broiler for a few minutes to melt the cheese. A sprinkle of Parmesan and onto a plate with a knife and fork--I actually saved half my sandwich for lunch tomorrow, because that was a lot of food.

We will definitely be making these again.

I have many recipes for Italian meatballs and this is one of the best.  For me, however, there is enough salt in the Parmesan and bread crumbs that I left out the 2 tsp. of salt and the nearly 2400 mg of sodium they contain.  That leaves only the sodium found in the milk, eggs and meat and reduces the sodium per serving by almost 2/3.

These were just OK for us. I’ve definitely made other meatballs better than this and even similar in method/ingredients. I didn’t care for the onions in the meatballs and felt the mixture could use more garlic. I also felt maybe another ½ tsp Italian herb seasoning could be used. My biggest complaint would be they were too salty for us, which I swore I reduced by half. There’s a possibility I might have added the full amount called for in the recipe. Next time I would omit the salt as parmesan cheese contains salt and maybe add a little more cheese. Bake time was perfect though and I didn’t find them to be greasy at all as others noted. For those who have complained about the meatballs being dry, watch the type of ground beef you’re using (see the footnotes of the recipe). I accidentally used 96% lean ground beef along with ½ lb ground pork and ½ lb ground veal, and the meatballs were a little drier than I’d like them to be, but that’s my own fault. I used unsweetened coconut milk to soak the breadcrumbs and omitted egg due to dietary restrictions. The meatballs held up great. Overall an OK meatball for us flavor wise, but nothing that took it over the top for us.

I often use parchment paper whenever I bake, simply because I hate doing dishes.  But, I just want to caution anyone using parchment for this recipe (or any other recipe requiring an oven temp greater than 420°F) because the heat threshold for parchment paper is 420°F, it can ignite in your oven. I'm speaking from personal expfriends. During Christmas baking for the 2015 holiday season, flames were shooting out of the top of oven door. The parchment was in flames, but the fire quickly extinguished itself, once the temp started decreasing

Excellent!  The very best meatballs I have ever made. Juicy and full of flavor.  Made the recipe exact (no substitutions or additions) - I did make them twice the size for extra large meatballs.  Browned nicely and held up perfectly in the sauce.  The entire family ate them up and wants me to make more.  Will definitely make again....soon.

Best meatball recipe ever!! Only changes I made was to use garlic powder instead of fresh (cause I think it mixes better) and I omit the red pepper flakes. I cook the meatballs in the oven just til browned then finish them in my tomato sauce. Plus, they freeze great!!

Excellent,  Good as a appetizer or in your favorite sauce.  Did not change a thing.  First time I made these was for a Christmas Gathering as a appetizer and everyone loved them.  Had calls the next day to get the recipe.  Highly recommend making them you will not be sorry.

These meatballs are delicious! I accidentally used Italian bread crumbs instead of plain bread crumbs and they came out awesome.. Also, Chef John mentions in the video that he puts cayenne pepper in it but I used red pepper flakes as the written recipe states.  Make sure you watch the video it has lots of good tips. Enjoy!

I made this exactly to the recipe, I thought this recipe was spicy,
Tasty & moist but way too much pepper for me. I gave the leftovers to my son & girlfriend, they devoured them, my son said the best I have had in awhile so if you like spicy this recipe is for you, not me. I like using  Italian bread for breadcrumbs,
Tastes better. I like green pepper for flavor.

I have never made meatballs before so I didn't know what to expect! I followed the recipe exactly (except I didn't use any pork) and it turned out AMAZING!  My husband loved them! I put them in some marinara sauce for spaghetti and he ate half of them by themselves!  I will be adding this recipe to my recipe rotation! I would give this 1,000 stars if I could!

Several technique suggestions. Panade (soak breadcrumbs in milk) is essential to retain soft moist texture. For browning without a greasy mess:   I put the tray under the broiler for a few minutes and flip over to brown both sides. I use a meat thermometer to check internal temp. Since I'm making at least a double batch to freeze, if not reached about 145 degrees I rotate that tray to lower shelf to remove from direct broiler heat and then put a new tray under the broiler.   Batch #1 continues to cook on lower shelf for a short time. I get an assembly line rotation going. Do not overcook as you'll have tough hockey pucks. Lastly,and super cool, after you've mixed up all your ingredients dump it onto a rimmed cookie sheet. Spread flat on sheet, then take a spatula and score out a grid (kinda like you are cutting brownies). Then, to form your premeasured  meatballs you simply grab each square and roll into a ball. Super fast and easy!  These tips save you from a greasy backsplash and cuts your time in half. 
P.S.  I use 2 lbs beef to 1 lb pork sausage as I prefer a milder pork flavor.

I didn't think it had enough flavor. I would use more fresh herbs, definitely would not use Italian seasoning spice.

The best recipe I've ever prepared. My partner said it was better than any restaurant he's ever visited. Granted, he's easy! He always praises my efforts. But, this was a special exception, bc I do not prefer Italian based meals.....but I loved it!! Made as called for with the meatball recipe, also from this site. Wow!
I did add red pepper to the meatball's, the extra kick was great with this sauce! I forgot an important trick I use to bake these. I place a cooling rack onto a baking sheet already lined w/parchment or foil. The baking rack is covered in either of these. Then I cut slits into this, so that excess grease may drip down onto the baking sheet. Easy cleanup, & no excess grease into sauce.

I made this recipe with a few differences: I didn't use eggs and I used dried parsley. Despite the changes, these meatballs were terrific. I will definitely make again.

Maybe the problem was that I substituted ground hamburger for pork (they didn't have any at my store) but these came out kind of bland. They'll be okay in the sauce, but I don't think they'll add much to the dish that I couldn't have gotten with ground hamburger on its own.

I doubled the recipe and was not at all impressed with the taste and the amount of black pepper is way to much.

Made as is, I thought this was excellent, however, I would not recommend leaving these meatballs in a crock pot for any amount of time, as they most definitely will crumble apart.  Thanks for sharing, my family enjoyed this & everyone went back for seconds.

I love these meatballs. The only changes I make are to add a little bit of mild Italian sausage. I try to ratio the ground beef and ground pork evenly with about half as much Italian sausage. Also, instead of baking these, I simmer them in my marinara sauce until they are done. Not only does this produce very tender meatballs, but it adds a nice, rich flavor to the sauce.

They were too tough ... They need a lot more bread crumbs !! I was able to soften them up by cooking them in sauce for 4 hours but they still had a funny texture and lacked juiciness

light sausage.

I love this. It's a bit too much onion. Next time, I think I"ll GRATE the onion. Might be less chunky onion flavor then. Really good if you sub Italian sausage for the pork (and therefore halve the salt)!!!

I'm sure this recipe is super delicious using the meats Chef John recommends, but I used ground turkey, and the meatballs were yummy. I loved baking them in the oven vs. tending to them over the stove.

I decided to give this recipe a try after needing something to do with the hamburger sitting in our fridge for a couple days. As with most recipes, I didn't follow this to a T. I did go to the store to buy pork, but I used what we had in our pantry for the rest. Instead of bread crumbs, I crumbled up 8 or 9 salted crackers. I didn't use any parsley or Italian seasoning. I minced the garlic (instead of crushing it) and I chopped an onion (instead of mincing of it). The recipe says to cook the meat balls in the oven for 15 - 20 minutes and that didn't sound like long enough for me so I cooked them for 30 minutes (I'd rather have the meat over done then under done). They weren't too bad actually. They were lacking a bit of spices but that's because I didn't put in the Italian seasoning or parsley. They were good with spaghetti though.

This is my first time making meatballs.  I wasn't a HUGE fan to begin with (in my family, we always had meat sauce instead of meatballs with spaghetti).  But my husband requested meatballs, and I usually love Chef John's recipes, so I tried this - but it was just okay.  I probably wouldn't make again.

I cooked up a batch and a half of these - they were truly kick- meatballs!  The only mods were doubling the hot pepper, using dried parsley,  and using grated Pecorino Romano.  I cooked half on the tray as described and half in a mini-muffin tray.  The ones in the mini-muffin tray browned wonderfully in their own fat.  I'm glad I cooked more as the wife and I wolfed down a bunch after coming out of the oven.  Thank you, this recipe is a winner!

These were pretty good, but I think next time I will try using all ground beef instead of half pork and half beef. Really easy to make and they taste delicious with spaghetti sauce over noodles. Will make again.

These were really, really good! Very tender. The only thing I did different was baked them for half the time then added them to my spaghetti sauce to finish cooking and add the meat flavors to my sauce. They made amazing meatball sandwiches the next night. I think even my Italian in-laws would love these! Thanks for the recipe.

These are very tasty, and it makes a lot! They freeze well, hold their shape after defrosting and taste just as good as when they're fresh. They're great to have on hand for those nights when you feel lazy, just let them defrost, reheat/brown in pan, add sauce and pasta, done, great low-effort meal.

So, so good! But feeling lazy, I skipped sautéing the onions in olive oil and simply very finely chopped them and added them right into the meat mixture. They cooked beautifully and perfectly within the meatball in the oven. I leave out the pepper flakes (just personal reference) and add basil and a bit of oregano. Yum!!

Made as is and they were fantastic.  Next time I would like to make a double batch & freeze what I don't use.  Any thoughts on whether or not to freeze them raw or cooked?  It's just my wife & I and we would only use maybe 2- 4 meatballs at one setting...

Wow!!  wonderful!  I did reduce the milk to 1/3 cup but did soak the breadcrumbs in it.  And I only had Italian breadcrumbs in my pantry so I used that.  I also cooked them a bit longer in the oven and they were absolutely fabulous.  I made my marinara sauce and beforehand and put the meatballs in the sauce after they came out of the oven.  My husband and kids loved it.  My 4 year old daughter, who never stops talking, had her little head in the bowl the entire time.  haha. Try these...you won't be disappointed.

This recipe is great.  I used all beef because I didn't have any pork on hand and also used crushed crackers instead of breadcrumbs and it still turned out fantastic.  I used a cookie scoop for uniformity(don't know the number, around the size of a melon baller) and got 70 meatballs out of this recipe. thanks for a great recipe!!

Best meatballs I've tasted, let alone cooked! Followed the recipe except out of garlic and used garlic powder. Made half a batch because there's only two of us, and froze half which I used over the next few weeks for meatball sandwiches. Extraordinary with spaghetti -- and likewise with the meatball sandwiches. I can't recommend this recipe enough.

We loved this recipe and the kids loved it too! We made some minor modifications - we made the meatballs about 2-3 times the size and instead of cooking in the sauce for 1 to 2 hours, we simply took out of the oven and topped with some homemade tomato sauce and served it. We did make smaller meatballs for the kids and let them dip the meatballs into the sauce. A definite family favorite.

Do yourself a favor and make these meatballs. So flavorful. I will never buy frozen meatballs again. Added fennel seed to the onions while sweating.  Otherwise, followed the recipe to the letter. Thought these were going to be too salty but not the case. Bravo!

Great meatballs!  I didn't have ground pork so I used 88/12 ground beef and they were very flavorful.  A little salty so I'll cut down on salt next time but I don't even think I'll try another meatball recipe.  This is the one!

These were simply delicious. I would have followed the recipe to a T, but I didn't have ground pork or red pepper flakes. Instead, I used 2 lbs of beef and 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper in place of the red pepper flakes. These were delicious and guess what?! They didn't fall apart! I LOVE Chef John's recipes! If you haven't yet, try his Irish Shepard's Pie! YUM!

And to the lady who said that they were swimming in liquid when you took them out of the oven... If you watched the video on how to make these, he prefers to use an 80% lean, 20% fat meat, which I indeed used in my recipe. It has more flavor and because it has more fat, the fat will cook out and that's all the liquid that you see. It's normal. Also, if you live at a high altitude like I do, you'll probably need to cook them just a smidge longer than 20 minutes. Mine were in for 25 and they were perfectly browned and cooked inside.

These ARE the meatballs you've been looking for! They certainly were for me. I've been a spaghetti head since I could walk, but only started trying to make my own meatballs in the last few years. I went through the whole fry them for a bit first then simmer them in sauce, or make them in a crock pot, and they just never turned out with the glorious juicy soft inner texture I always wanted. Well these did it, and I will make these every time I make spaghetti again! Much thanks to Chef John  :D

Absolutely LOVED these meatballs!  They were seasoned to perfection and cooked enough to leave them soft and juicy.  Loved the little bit of red pepper flakes that were in it, too!

Great! Used water instead of milk and 85/15 beef. My boyfriend started squealing when he tried. When you make this don't change a thing.

My new go-to recipe for meatballs!  They were so moist and tasty.  I altered the recipe slightly - not because I wanted to, but I bought 1 lb of extra lean ground beef BEFORE I looked up the recipe.  So I halved the recipe and added a drizzle of olive oil to the meat mix just to make sure it was moist enough.  Also, did not have time to chill meat mix for an hour and it still worked out fine!  I'll plan ahead better for next time.  Thanks, Chef John!

Great flavor. Definitely swimming in fat when taken out of oven, but maybe that's better because it's easy to drain. I will skip the foil next time.  Makes cleanup easier but they stuck to foil.  Would have been easier to scrape off pan than foil. Yup, much better with out the foil.

I've made this recipe several times now and have yet to make a change to it. This recipe is perfect just the way it is! It all started when my fiance wanted to make meatballs in a mushroom sauce for a company potluck, and they were such a hit that his coworkers ask us to make them every company potluck (people request the recipe for them too!) I usually double the recipe and freeze the meatballs for easy future suppers. Don't change a thing, they're perfect.

Super fantastic recipe from Chef Jon.....I can not thank you enough for this recipe...I used to buy the ready made frozen meat balls, as I could never seem to get them right when I made them myself.....Now I can make them and everyone that has them loves them!!  I also use this recipe at work now (I am a manager of a commercial kitchen in a middle school) We make the meat balls ahead of time and then freeze them.  I have YET to have a problem with them staying together, even after freezing them!  This is now, and always will be my "go to" meat ball recipe!!

I only had ground beef so that's what I used. These were awesome. I can only imagine how much better they would be made with half pork. No need to ever look for another meatball recipe again.

Delish!!   I have never made meatball before... and I loved these.  However, I did brown them in a pan first because I was nervous.   Wouldn't change a thing.  Now to find an equally delish spaghetti sauce!

They didn't brown, but they tasted great and had a good texture.  Next time I will add more pepper flakes - maybe 3/4 t.  I didn't taste them at all.

This recipe is my new go to meatball recipe!  It pairs very well with Lara's Cocktail Meatball sauce!!  The only thing I would recommend differently is mix all your ingredients and add the meat last! This ensures a thorough mixture.

Very good...I used 1lb.  ground round and 1lb. Italian sausage.  They turned out perfect.  I usually add some fresh ground parmagan cheese to my meatballs but didn't add to this recipe, next time I will try adding it.  They browned nicely, but it took about an hour...may have been my oven...didn't matter, they were delish!  Will definitely make again.

Second time these turned out perfect.  Increased red pepper flakes to a whole teaspoon & added 1/4 teaspoon crushed fennel seeds.
Now they taste exactly like the ones in our favorite meatball sandwich!
Only have to find perfect roll recipe and we won't miss the passing of our 50 yr. plus eaterie!

John, no need for the onions. I added a total of a 1/2 cup bread crumbs with a blend of..1/4 cup half/half and 1/4 cup water.also..no pepper flakes. I added another pinch of salt too..im italian and highly recommend this recipe.  May I add a twist ....bake for 10 minutes then throw some in the simmering sauce for an hour. ALSO, throw a handful of raisins in the mix,,,an added dimension..trust me.

I made these tonight for my husband's birthday dinner tomorrow evening.  I plan on popping them into the crockpot with my sauce tomorrow afternoon just before dinner.  I, of course, had to try them, and these are absolutely 100% the BEST meatballs I have ever had - EVER.  They're full of flavor - not at all dry or heavy.  I'm hoping that my double batch leaves us with lots of leftovers after the in laws leave because I definitely want to pop some in the freezer for a quick and easy meal on a busy weeknight.  I did use the beef broth in place of the milk, and will probably continue to prepare these the same way.  Out of this world delicious! MINOR CHANGES:  We aren't really a fan of heat with our spaghetti & meatballs, so I left out the red pepper flakes.  To make up for the lack of the additional layer of flavoring, I did double the Italian Seasoning.

Great meatballs!  I didn't soak my breadcrumbs in milk.  I just added the specified amount of breadcrumbs and then poured in a bit of milk, and they turned out just fine!  My wife absolutely loved them.  Perfect for spaghetti and meatballs with any red sauce.

These are the best meatballs I have ever had, and I didn't even make them correctly.  I only had hamburger, so that is what I used.  I also did not have in fresh parsley, so I used dried instead.  If they taste this good with my changes, I can't wait to make them again with the proper ingredients.  As to the quantity, I cut the recipe in half thinking I would make 15 servings (I assumed they meant 1 meatball to equal 1 serving), but I ended up with 26 meatballs.  I guess that just means more for later. :)

Now this is a meatball!  These meatballs have a wonderful flavor and are moist, tender, and hold together well.  Baking is so much easier than pan-frying meatballs and just as delicious.  I skipped the red pepper flakes because I thought that the daughter for whom I prepared these might object and they were still very flavorful.  This is a perfect recipe!

These meatballs are great!  I love the added kick of the red pepper flakes, they hold their shape well and baking them in the oven eliminates all that grease splatter.  I doubled the recipe and made 46 meatballs (we like them larger) cooked for 21 minutes.  I did add more parmesan cheese to the mixture and next time would add more Italian herb seasoning because I really didn't notice it.  After taking them out of the oven I then put them in the crock-pot with sauce to let all the flavors combine for a few hours on high.  I am going to freeze half of the cooked meatballs so I can just toss them in the crock-pot with sauce for an easy meal.  I will keep this in my meatball rotation along with some of my other favorites that use feta cheese and worcestershire sauce.  Thanks Chef John!

This recipe is a keeper! I don't really like meatballs but since my husband does and requested spaghetti & meatballs for dinner, I needed to find a good, simple recipe.

I stuck fairly closely to the recipe, using only 90% lean ground beef, omitting the onions, using Italian-seasoned breadcrumbs, and using extra Parmesan and red pepper.  I found it easier to use my hands to incorporate the ingredients rather than using a spoon or spatula.  I refrigerated the meat for just about 30 minutes and it was very easy to work with.  Since there are just two of us, I halved the recipe and yielded 32 1.5" meatballs.

Thanks for sharing this recipe - I'll definitely use it again!

These were GREAT! I cut the recipe in half as I was only making enough for two people, but I followed the recipe exactly and they were the best meatballs I've ever had.  Had enough for leftovers for the next night. Will make again, thanks!!

Tripled recipe, used 4# butchers blend (half beef, half pork) and 2# ground beef.  Substituted Romano for Parmesan, used a pint in the tripled recipe.  Used my own sugo, very tasty together.

Followed the recipe exactly except the following tweaks:
1. Used ONLY 2lbs of ground Sirloin 
2. Used basil instead of Parsley 
3. Added 1/3 cup more breadcrumbs
4. Added 1/2 teaspoon of liquid smoke and Worcester Sauce to the crockpot with maranara.
5. Stuffed each meatball with FETA cheese
  
YOUR WELCOME! ??lol

Excellent!  Only things I did differently was to skip the refrigerator step because of time constraint and I pan seared before baking at 350.  Such GREAT flavor.  Thank you for another perfect recipe.  I can always count on you!

Great recipe John!  thx for the hint on chilling the mixture before forming the balls.  I used a melon scooper and theu cam out perfect x1.5 golf ball size.  

I made a marinara sauce and then steeped the meatballs in the sauce for two hours.  My kids loved them!

Delicious! Made it tonight and put it in marinara sauce with ricotta, mozzarella and parmesan cheeses. Served with big salad. Meatballs browned well in my electric oven after 20 mins. as directed. Seasoning was spot on in my opinion. Thank you so much for another great recipe!

Followed recipe with no changes. Baked meatballs in oven night before. Refrigerated, next morning put in crockpot with jar of tomato sauce. Cooked on low for about 4-5 hours. 
Everyone raved about them!! Moist and delicious and did not fall apart.

This is a 10 star dish, but I actually like his meatless Italian meatballs better.  Go figure, because I'm not vegan.  I made this recipe without any alterations and they were awesome.

I made it  - all things considered I'd give it 3 1/2 starts! I could see the bread crumb mix wasn't a good idea so kept a little of it mixing in finely crushed soda biscuits. I did not add pork. Otherwise pretty much stuck with the recipe. I used an ice cream scoop as a measure for size & it worked beautifully. They held together nicely. I added 8 mins to cooking time. Another time I'll use extra lean beef as there was a lot of oil. Taste could have been better - my fault as I used less meat & should have reduced egg & bread mixture accordingly. I'm simmering them in tomato sauce so I'm hopeful the taste will be improved.

I used about 2/3 c 2% milk and 1/3 c heavy cream. I used herbed cubed stuffing mix with some Italian bread crumbs (2:1) and no "Italian seasoning" mix, but threw in healthy pinches of dried oregano, herbes de Provence, thyme. I cut up two fresh basil leaves with the garlic and added them to the sauté together. I let the onions begin to brown before adding them to the raw meat mix. I made the meatballs pretty big, tho not Swedish size.My children adored them. Def making again and again.

I just used beef and used Italian parsley but otherwise followed the recipe exactly, the bread crumb mixture leaked out of the meatballs in the oven, tasted great, had them with sauce & spaghetti, tasted great, will make again.

These are the best meatballs EVER!! Super easy! I love that you bake them instead of frying. I scooped them into meatballs with an icecream scooper so they were even sized and I didn’t have to handle them so much because the scooper has a lever that pushes them out onto the baking pan.Definitely a recipe to keep and use and pass down generation after generation.

What a great simple addition to out pasta and salad dinner. I made it just as it's written. This yielded 18 good size meatballs so I had enough left over to freeze for the next time. I'd definitely make this again and my kids loved them.

This recipe was perfect! I would just add a wee bit more salt. I also just cooked the meatballs right in the sauce - it was amazing!

I made these, and they’re terrific!  
I made a few changes because my galley (kitchen) is so small. 
-Didn’t have bread crumbs so used 5/8 cup of ground matzo for each cup of breadcrumbs. 
-We’re in the Caribbean full time in our sailboat so keeping the temperature down inside the boat is a priority. To that end I pan fried these, deglazed the pan and built the sauce in the same pan.  Then I added the scrumptious meatballs into the sauce pan. 
Chef John’s recipes are SOOO good and SOOO easy to convert to use in a teeny, tiny galley. Watch his vids every night (when we can find internet). 
Will definitely be making these again!!!

I followed the recipe to the ingredient. The only thing different was I doubled it and made 1 cup size meatballs. I accompanied it with chef Johns tomato sauce and served them on a crusty roll.

By far the best meatballs I have made. Cooking them in the sauce makes them extra tender and I add extra garlic.

These are delicious.  I used a rack to cook them on.  Without the rack they are a bit greasy.  Other than that I made no modifications to the recipe.

I loved this recipe!  I had never made meatballs before, simply because I am not a meatball lover.  But I had occassion to make food for a large group and my husband suggested meatballs.  I always trust Chef John and he did not let me down.  The meatballs were very well received!  The only change I made was to use fresh pork sausage instead of ground pork, since that was all the supermarket had at the moment.  If anything, that probably just added to the flavor.

I have made these twice, cooking third time right now. 
They are exactly what you would expect from genuine Italian meatballs. My husband couldn't rave about them enough and he isn't a raver about food. Lol.
I need to note the first time l made them l used Polish Sausage Links. I had no other pork. Took the meat out of the casings. They were out of this world. I bought the links from Grass Roots Farmers Cooperative on line.

These meatballs were fabulous!  My husband and I absolutely loved them.  We used beef stock instead of milk to soak the bread crumbs and used meatloaf mix instead of half ground beef and half ground pork.  We will definitely make these again.

This meatball recipe is great.  I did make a few minor changes to it, but they came out splendidly. Firstly, I made one and a half the recipe.  Instead of using beef and pork I used two pounds of beef and one pound of turkey. I also used garlic herb breadcrumbs instead of plain one and only added a bit more of garlic powered instead of crushed garlic.  Those were the only deviations to this excellent meatball recipe.

I never thought I'd ever say there is too much garlic in something, but this has  too much garlic.  That's all I could taste. I could keep the vampires away for life! Next time I'll cut them down and see if they are any better.

My 8 year old is pretty picky when it comes to meatballs. She doesn’t like them overly seasoned but still have a nice meaty texture and flavor. This one is a winner for us. And they freeze very well. Will use again.

I made these meatballs exactly how Chef John instructed & they turned out tender & delicious.  They're the best tasting meatballs hands down & will be the only recipe I'll use for making meatballs.  I made them for a spaghetti dinner with some friends (a hit by all) & the leftover meatballs were enjoyed as meatball subs the next day. Bon Appetito! Thank you Chef John

Soaked the breadcrumbs in the milk.  Couldn't blend the mixture because the breadcrumbs gummed up & left balls of coagulated breadcrumb mixture within the meatballs.  Absolutely awful.

We made these vegetarian!  I have not made a bad Chef John recipe yet, and this is no exception!

Instead of the 2 lbs of meat, we subbed 2 lbs of Beyond Meat ground plant beef. Omitted the cheese, replaced the milk with veggie broth, but kept the egg, so they were vegetarian and dairy free but not vegan.

I also cooked them a bit longer, 25 min or so. Were perfect. Ended up with 22 balls at about 2 in each. 

Really outstanding!!

Made these last night and the only thing I added was mozzarella cheese. I cut up mozzarella cheese sticks into small pieces and put a chunk in the middle of each meatball. I serve these in a casserole with my sunday sauce and some dinner rolls. Perfect little meatball sliders, my teen son and everyone else loved them. Great for sunday football snacks! All the seasonings makes these truly tasty meatballs.

baking the meatballs makes it so much easier than frying. Why didn't I think of that. Having more of the meat flavor adds to the flavor. Much better than just cooking the ground meat.

Absolutely amazing!  I will never buy meatballs again. I followed the directions exactly. The only downside is that I cannot get 30 meatballs out of a batch. I made it to 23 but that’s okay because I don’t want them any smaller.

I made this pretty much as written, except I didnt have any parsley at home....plenty over at my garden.  I used oregano, thyme and rosemary for my herbs.   I thought it was going to be too wet...but after sitting in the fridge and resting...it all came together.  Was easy to roll the meat balls and I cooked them in my oven with the convection setting at 425.  (I think the oven adjusts the temp for the convection feature.  I cooked them for 15 mins plus 3 more as they were gettin a lovely browning.   They are now sitting in sauce waiting to be reheated for supper.  (my husband couldnt wait and ate one..."very good"  he said....and he seldom comments on my cooking (even though I am an excellent cook)   I will definately make this again...best meatballs  I have ever made.

Delicious! I made these as written except I went a bit lighter not the salt (a heavy teaspoon vs. 2 teaspoons). The meatballs turned out perfect. Family is already asking me to make them again soon.

Made it with the red pepper flakes the first time and I loved it but was a little spicy, my 3 yr old liked them but not the spice. So, trying it again with no red pepper flakes! Used them for meat ball sandwich’s and they came out awesome!

Love these! I used panko soaked in beef broth. Also skipped the onion and used 1Tbsp onion powder instead. My family doesnt like onions, but I like the onion flavor. I'd like to try these with mild Italian sausage instead of the pork.

I made this yesterday and it was EXCELLENT. I did do a modification based on my diet preferences. I used low carb bread and toasted it in a 250 degree oven for 30 minutes and then ground it into crumbs. Best low carb meatballs we've ever had!

Thank you again Chef John for another perfect recipe!! These were delicious, I followed the recipe exactly except for using dry parsley instead of fresh. I did the math and it should be 4 tablespoons of dried parsley if you double the recipe. I took others advice and put them on a little rack above the other pan, they do produce a decent amount of grease so that helped. I also did have to extend the amount of cooking time, but I may have rolled mine a little bit bigger. I will definitely be making this again, thank you for the recipe!!

Hubby and I were meal prepping our dinners for the week, and decided last minute to make homemade meatballs rather than use premade frozen ones. Found this recipe, and other than adding almost a whole bulb of garlic (sorry we cant help ourselves) and using all beef (not used to eating a lot of pork) we followed the recipe exactly, even measuring out ingredients (which we never do). Cooked and refrigerated the meatballs in a large pot. The following day, we added to the pot two bottles of sauce (Trader Joe's Basil Marinara and my favorite, Rao's Arrabbiata) and wowwww. Used the sauce to top a 25/75 mix of spaghetti (we added a bit of pasta water to the sauce) and zucchini noodles. This has been one of our favorite meal preps yet!

- swapped meat for meatloaf meat mix because that was on sale
-  added a teaspoon of beef base

Increased milk to 1cup & the Panko as well & 4tbsp of Parmesan ! Also used packet of Lipton onion soup vs all the slicing dicing of additional flavourful items! Family loves it! As do I! Fits in my low carb dieting!

These meatballs were a hit! I found them very easy to make with minimal hands on time. To form the meatballs, I scooped the mixture with an ice cream scoop and then perfected the ball with my wet hands. Then, the oven did the rest of the work. While baking, they did release some grease onto the lined baking tray. Next time, I will use a grate so the liquid can drain as they bake. Wonderful recipe. Thank you.

I have made this recipe multiple times and only deviate where eggs and dairy are concerned. 

 One of my kids has egg and dairy allergies.  I use soy milk and an egg replacer product. 

These still come out very delicious and moist.

I know I was doing something right when my daughter had a friend over who dined with us and ate some of my prepared meatballs. 

 The friend's mother is a trained and practicing chef so the friend has a pallet more sophisticated than your normal 13 year old.

The friend took a few bites and said "...these are really good!"

By far the best meatballs I've ever made.  I think the secret is soaking the breadcrumbs in milk to keep them moist.  I baked them in in oven and then transferred them to  a Crockpot of simmering Rao's Homemade Marinara Sauce. Fabulous!

This was great ! I changed it a little, I used seasoned breadcrumbs,  4 cloves of garlic which I sauteed to bring out their flavor, doubled the parm cheese, and let it sit in the fridge for 2 hours in 19 min they were delicious

Ok I don't eat red meat but the bf does, so I made these for him. I followed this recipe EXACTLY.  Used the well known brand of pork in a tube and 80% ground beef. Only thing I barely changed was to slightly lessen the salt, (based on recommendations) and halved the chili flakes, as the bf is not a big spicy guy. He is not an overreaction type of guy, but said these were outstanding. I asked him about flavor and texture (including asking if he was bummed they weren't pan seared) and he gave all of it a huge thumbs up. Made these in the 1.5 inch recommended size and found 15 minutes was plenty of time to cook them through. Made 35-40 meatballs. As others said, they hold up very well to baking, mixing with sauce, and freezing. Excellent recipe all around. Thank you so much!!!!!!!! Tip: clean the pans right away and they clean very easily!

I download a lot of recipes and most of them sound better than they are but this recipe it out of this world. So simple to make and amazingly delicious. I did have a little more pork (1.2 lb) than the recipe called for but I doubt that mattered and I didn't adjust the spices because of it. All of my ingredients were fresh and I used a good quality Parmesan cheese which can only help. This is a wonderful meatball and I want to thank Chef John for sharing it. I'll be looking at his other contributions for sure.

Great meatballs!  Due to our low-carb diet restrictions, we used the left overs as meatball sandwiches with lettuce instead of bread.  We chopped up the meatballs into small pieces, sauteed in a bit more marinara, slapped a couple of slices of provolone on top until melted and then slid the delicious meat-cheese-sauce combo on to romaine lettuce, much like a lettuce wrap!  Who knew I wouldn't miss the bread?

Very good.  The only change I made was that I used italian sausage instead of just ground pork because that's what I had.  I think it gave it a nice flavour.  It made enough so that I could freeze some for a later time.

These turned out really good. I almost didn't use the ground pork but decided to stick to the true recipe- that was a good move.  Also used freshly grated cheese and not the cheap stuff.  Baked on a broiler pan, so juices fell through.

Made these tonight and they’re now my go to meatball recipe. I followed the recipe exactly but browned them in the pan before putting them in the oven and then added them to the sauce. My family loved them! Very well seasoned and stayed tender and juicy.

Prepared exactly as written, absolutely perfect.  I have been searching for a good meatball recipe for a long time. I'm happy to say the search is over. These were devoured so fast there were none left when the meal was over. IF I were to do anything different I would brown them in a skillet just a little before putting in the oven, but that is a personal preference they are great as written.

I prepared this as directed and they were wonderful!  I did use hot Italian sausage though as a good spicy meatball is my husband's favorite!  This can be made as spicy as you like!

The meatballs were the perfect density, leaning more on the lighter side.  I used 93/7 beef and it worked just fine, although 80/20 may have worked better.  Twenty minutes is a long time to have the onions cooking, they were beginning to brown after fifteen.

I have made them twice now and they are excellent.  I have been using ground Italian sausage instead of just pork. Our family loves them. Pan does get a little greasy but that's expected when you cook with ground pork and 80/20 beef. But if you cook them on parchment paper it's easy to clean. For sure my go to recipe for meatballs.

This is a great recipe.  Thank you Chef John!  Changes only after reading some reviews: 1) heavy cream instead of milk, 2) no onions only because I don't like them, 3) 4 tsp salt, 4) 2 tsp black pepper, 5) 1 TBSP red pepper flakes, 6) 1 TBSP Italian herbs, and 7) 4 T Parmesan cheese.  Oh and I didn't have plain bread crumbs so I whizzed up herb seasoned cubed stuffing.  I ended up with 45 meatballs using a 1/4 cup scoop.  This is a keeper recipe for sure!

I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out very good and tasty. I loved the fact that they are backed in the oven rather than fried....so much less mess to clean up! Will definitely make again.

My family loved these! Because I always read people's comments on recipes looking for common adjustments, I wanted to share mine here. Usually I hate it when people rate a recipe and then totally change it, but I made a few substitutions because I didn't have all of the ingredients. Substitutions: Cracker crumbs for bread crumbs (I always use crackers when recipe calls for bread crumbs), all beef instead of pork, added beef bouillon, no red pepper flakes, no parmesan. Delizioso! New family recipe.

Excellent recipe, I did add a little more garlic, Italian seasoning and some dashes of hot sauce but that’s just a personal adjustment. Wife always loves when I make these.

Excellent recipe.  By mistake I used ground mild Italian sausage instead of pork.  It was very good, just a tiny bit salty.  I'm sure if you follow the recipe as others have said, it will be perfect.

Good flavor although next time I’d only use half the salt, I found them a bit too salty. I also used an extra egg and doubled the bread crumbs for better consistency of the meatballs. Very good recipe all and all.

Absolutely Delicious! When I cook with onions I use my small blender and basically turn the onion into a paste. I skipped the step where you cook the onion in olive oil and added the onion directly to the meat mixture. After I cooked the meatballs I added them to Chef John's marinara sauce. The meatballs held up really well after being added to the sauce. This was a HUGE hit in my family!

I've made these twice now and loved them both times.  My only quibble is the texture of the meatballs and I can fix that by using less bread crumbs and milk.

I made these following the recipe using broth instead of milk and I cooked them in my spaghetti sauce instead of baking them.  They turned out great!  A lot of flavor!  I will make these again.  Thank you for the recipe.

Delicious! My Italian husband LOVED them! I paired them as a meal with my homemade sauce I’m going to disclose:
1 onion and 3-4 cloves of garlic sautéd in olive oil. When onions are translucent, add 1/2 cup or so of red wine and let it reduce.  Add tomato products, I use 2 28 oz cans of crushed tomatoes, 1/2 can tomato sauce and 1 tomato paste. The herbs go in now too.  1 tsp. Red pepper flakes, 1 1/2 tsp Italian seasoning, 1/2 tsp salt ( as long as their is no salt or not much in your tomato products), fresh herbs - 2 Tbsp basil, 1 Tbsp oregano, 1/2 Tbsp of rosemary and thyme.  Simmer for 2 hours. - with the meatballs in it for the last hour:) Enjoy!

I did use ground turkey instead of beef, it tasted great.  I omitted the red pepper flakes (I don't care for spicy) and used panko bread crumbs.

I made this exactly as written... except! Once the meatballs were assembeled, I noticed I forgot the garlic (major problem!!) So I minced it finely and added a tiny bit of olive oil and put a dab on top of each meatball. It was great on the meatballs that were not added to the sauce. This is a great recipe, full of flavor and easy enough to make. I ended up with 30 meatballs also, one full pan. Two days later, with 5 people, there is no leftovers!

I did not make any changes because I don't know how to cook good at all.  It was easy to understand and you just need to follow the directions and it comes out perfect.  It's pretty bad when you have to google what a clove of garlic is.  My husband will love this....and won't believe I made them!

My family LOVED these meatballs.  The only change I made was to use exclusively fresh herbs from my garden.  I pulled them in the food processor with the garlic, cheese and a little olive oil before adding to the meat mixture.  Delicious!  You usually can’t go wrong with a Chef John recipe.

Made these today and we loved them.  Baking is so much easier than frying in a skillet with the incredible mess that comes along.  That said, the key IMO is to cook them low and slow in the sauce which I did for three hours.  Will definitely make these again but I will add shredded Parmesan!  Thanks!

This was amazing...and to be honest I didn't really have high hopes :(  I'm married to an Italian and learned to make "gravy" from his Gramdma Rose...hours in the kitchen on Sunday would result in the most delicious family dinners!  Well this is a VERY close second...my husband LOVED it and so did I!!

I used dried parsley since I didn’t want to go to the grocery store but otherwise stuck to the recipe and they were AMAZING.   I’ll be lucky to have some left to freeze

Delicious!  The only thing I did different is I used fresh (day old) bread and Asiago cheese since I didn’t have Parmesan.  I actually think I like the Asiago better?  Not sure.  The only thing is in baking them the cheese leaked out a lot.  Next time I may try frying them.  But the recipe would be wonderful just as is.  My husband loved them.

Had a meatball cook off and I won with these (2/3 beef, 1/3 pork). Only spin-offs were beer instead of milk and added Santa Fe grande diced pepper to onion sauté because I grow them in my garden.

I used one pack veal and one pack of a beef/pork mix. I didn’t do the milk thing because I didn’t have milk, and I had to use curly parsley instead of flat Italian like I would have liked. (I think I put too much parsley in so careful with that.) Also I baked them, and they were good... but I think putting them in the sauce for 1+ hours would have made them better because they were a little dense, and I like more of a melt in your mouth meatball. I will probably try again but put them in the sauce!

As a few others said, tasted like meatloaf.  Could be better using  more italian spices and italian sausage.  Consistency of cooked balls was kinda mooshy (a great description Pati Jinich uses). I'm going back to another recipe I liked much more. (But I will say our poodles loved these).

I just made these for Good Friday and they were delicious!  I have already been asked to make them again!  I followed the directions and watched the video. The trick is to be patient, roll the meatballs, bake and slowly simmer in the sauce in a shallow pan with a lid on them.  Almost like steaming them so they absorb some of the liquid.  They were perfect!  So for those  who had problems just go with the flow.  I love regular meatballs and these were delicious also!  Awesome Chef John!

Baked them but thought a little dry. Maybe I made them two small. But I decided I really prefer the meat, etc fried and incorporated into the sauce.

No changes. Be sure to refrigerate mixture as indicated. Otherwise it may be difficult to form meatballs. Seasoned well. Very tasty.

I made this a couple nights ago, awesome!  I have to re-invent things, or i throw a lot of food away.  This can be made into a meatloaf.  Using the Italian pasta sauces.  With the left overs, you can slice the rest of the meatloaf up, and then cut each slice into square 1” pieces, and then that gets put into the pasta sauce, for a delicious Spaghetti & Meat squares. It is awesome!!!!

Great, simple, delicious recipe! I had a 1.4 lb. package of meatballs mix, followed the recipe with no change and the result was juicy, tender, perfectly seasoned, flavorful meatballs!!! I baked them for about 16 minutes. My kids asked for seconds. I will never look for another meatball recipe!

I have made these particular meatballs on a few occasions!! They have been a hit every time. Make them for spaghetti and meatballs, then the leftover meatballs for meatball subs!! I make them just as the recipe says, they are the absolute best meatballs I've had. Make them, you will not be disappointed!! This past time, I went ahead and used Chef John's tomato sauce recipe. Wow!!! I only used a wooden spoon to stir, worked out great!

I wanted a quick recipe for unexpected company for dinner.  All I had in hand was 2 lbs of 80/20 ground beef.  I used that instead of pork.  I didn't take the time to sauté the onions and I browned these in the skillet.  Everyone was happy with the results.  They were all gone by the end of the meal.  I would make this again.

I only had one egg.  I was running late and put it in the fridge until next day.  They came out perfect, not watery at all.  My spouse keeps sneaking them.

I doubled the recipe.  The first batch was not uniform in shape  and was a bit saltier than I like, and the meat felt rather mushy, so I added more beef.  Still misshapen but tasty.  I will try it with just ground chuck netext time.

These are so delicious! I was concerned about browning them, but they were perfectly browned in the oven. We like big meatballs, so I made these tennis ball sized, baked at 425 for 45 minutes and they came out perfectly! Nice and brown, flavorful and juicy yet firm. I might have put in 1 teaspoon of red pepper flakes instead of half teaspoon, but it was a perfect oops because I love the extra kick. It’s not too much, yet just right. Pretty much don’t need to add sauce or anything, they’re so dang good!

This has become a family favorite.  I did not make any changes to the recipe, it is perfect just as is.  After I have finished baking the meatballs I add them to a slow cooker with speg. sauce, this keeps them warm for everyone having seconds and thirds.

I wanted so bad to like this, but nope.  Won't make these again.  Way too moist and mushy, couldn't form into balls.  And gotta start this early in the afternoon.  My regular meatballs don't take so much time and form nice balls, and they taste the same!

Didn't plan to modify but ended up using seasoned bread crumbs and not dried Italian herbs only because I didn't have plain breadcrumbs on hand.  These are FANTASTIC!! Many are being eaten before they even make it into the sauce. Definitely making this recipe again!

Initial taste is great; now I let it simmer in the sauce/gravy, and we'll see, but I'm positive the overall result will be great.  Will get back.

I liked the way they stayed in perfect shape during cooking without crumbling, the ones I made could have done with more seasoning possibly some spice, we found them
A little bland.
Will defo make again and adjust ingredients to our taste.

I made some changes and they were not good; I used only 1.5 pounds of a pork/beef combination causing the other ingredients to overwhelm, particularly the garlic.  I like garlic, but not to overwhelm.  The balls had great texture and browned nicely.   I forgot to grease  the tin foil and so the meatballs stuck to the foil slightly but not enough to cause them to be misshapened.   Moral:  follow the recipe to get the best results.  I don't feel comfortable rating these meatballs.

No changes - my grocer sells a "lamb/pork/beef" combo for "meatloaf" which provided the perfect blend of fat/lean.  These are big hits with kids and adults - just remember to oil the aluminum foil so you don't lose the crusty bits.

Meatballs where very good, but there was a flavor my mother and I did not like. Still unsure of what flavor that was but were assuming it was the Italian seasoning from McCormicks. We will use our own blend of oregano and basil instead of Italian seasoning. Also we used Italian bread crumbs not plain. I wanted them to be more flavorful in case we did not want to use sauce.  All in all very good.

Because I wanted to render out some pork fat, I browned the meatballs quickly in a fry pan, then baked 15 min., then into red sauce. Used 2x parm. cheese

I had a guest that requested meatballs that weren’t mostly bread crumbs. This was perfect. The only thing I changed was using 100% ground beef instead of a beef and pork mixture.

I made these the other night and they were amazing!!!  I didn't have time to soak the bread crumbs and I didn't add the italian seasonings.  I also used 85% ground beef instead of pork. I did pan-fry them before putting them in the oven because that is just my preference.  This is now my go to meatball recipe.  Absolutely delicious!

All I had in the freezer was 3 lb ground chuck 80% ... soaked the bread and squeezed it to make nice and mushy ... sauteed onions and added the garlic for the last 30secs, and mixed in with bread ...added seasoning (except for parsley, I had none) to bread and stirred, then added the eggs .. finally the meat was gently incorporated - used a #30 (1.03oz) disher to maintain a uniform size, and baked 425F fan 20 min .. came out beautifully and tasted great!

These are my son’s favorite! I skip the onions and red pepper flakes, and as a result use only about 1/3 c milk. I also use dried parsley. You can pop them in the freezer raw or cooked for a quick meal later. Thanks a Chef John!

My new favorite meatball recipe. Like all Chef John recipes, the first time I make it exactly as written because he is usually spot on. In this case, I only had ground beef on hand so omitted the veal and they still were delicious. I used Italian bread crumbs which I soaked in milk. Baked them for 18 minutes and they were perfectly done. Added about half to my marinara sauce and froze the rest for a later meal since it’s only two of us. Will definitely make again!

I wasn't fond of the flavor,  50/50 ratio of beef and sausage. I tasted too much sausage.  I would fry these next time, so they brown evenly. The texture and Italian flavor was on spot. Soaking the breadcrumbs was the trick. I will make again, just use more beef, and less sausage.

Excellent recipe!  Family loved it.  We did fist-sized big meatballs, so we lowered the temp and baked 35 minutes.  They turned out perfectly, and we served them with a great sauce over homemade pasta.

Made for a party and served them with gravy made from the drippings. Delicious, and a hit! Didn’t precook the onions. It is important to chill the mixture so it’s easier to handle.

My wife made a crock pot marinara sauce and asked me to make some meatballs. There's an Italian place close to where we live that makes large tasty meatballs. I fell into this recipe on allrecipes. I didn't have any ground pork so just used ground beef.  I followed the recipe closely and made 5 rather large meat balls. They were really tasty just like the restaurant. My wife wanted the meatballs smaller the next time.

before cooking the entire batch, I cooked one meatball as a taste test.  I added more herb seasoning.  Once, I was happy with the taste, then I formed the rest of the batch and baked.

Chef John--you are never wrong! Spices are perfect, just enough to make to make the meatballs spiced up instead of bland. I did not bake the meatballs. I browned the 20 giant meatballs in two skillets. Of course you will notice that they are not cooked in the center. For this I put on the lids and added a few tablespoons of water to steam the interior of meatballs. Made gravy during steaming process and added to meatballs. Continued cooking til all were cooked thoroughly, about 15-20 min. on low heat. Added an extra cup of breadcrumbs as with 1/4 cup they just didn't want to stay together. Wonderful recipe, all the family enjoys it!!

These meatballs are so easy, we make them every time we make spaghetti and meatballs now.  I have made this recipe 5 or 6 times now, and even using venison it works great!

I love these meatballs. I’ve been making them since I found them is so recipe 4 years ago. MY husbands a picky eater, so when I find something he likes I stick with it. Only change I made was that I didn’t soak the breadcrumbs. And I eyeball everything now because I’ve made these so much. I even make a bunch and freeze some :) looove these.

Made as written except for one sub. I exchanged ground pork rinds for the bread crumbs for dietary reasons. Otherwise followed the recipe. We will be making these again.

Everyone I make these for just are amazed at these meatballs. I won't really eat anyone else's meatballs and always try to be the one to make.  I didn't change the recipe I keep it on spot.  Chef John these are the worlds best tasting meatballs ever. My husband keeps sneaking in and eating them without sauce and they are good just the way they are without sauce!  Thank you for sharing!!!

The pork and beef combo can’t be beat. The flavor was  well-roundd, although you may want to take it easy on the fresh garlic if you have a sensitive stomach. I coomed these in a simmering tomato sauce and it flavored the sause very well, and resulted in moist meatball left overs. I took a star off only because the garlic was a bit much, but that could have been the size, or personal preference. Stars are for ease of prep, flavor, and versatility!

I used dried parsley and minced onions to save time, and they turned out just fine. Next time I’ll use the fresh stuff.

6 lbs of only chuck, chopped (no pork)  about 45 meatballs..

Today is Sunday before thanksgiving...I made this recipe (times 3) for our 2018 Thanksgiving lasagna. Unfortunately,  I started the gravy (sauce) on Saturday for lasagna assembly on Tuesday.   My family devoured the meatballs.   I had to go shopping this morning for more chopped meat.  I will make another 4 lbs of meatballs.  

I read through the negative reviews and most complaints were about the “watery” consistency.  I found this true but will attribute it to the tripling of the recipe and the type of chopped meat used, in my case, chuck 80/20.  I had 35 meatballs on the baking tray.   I drained off the excess fatty liquid about halfway through the baking process and again at the end.  I roasted at 375* convection, until they browned,  then added to my gravy.  I also pan fried about 10 which is my favorite way to cook them.  Either way, the taste is excellent.  

Note:  I use a food processor to mix the breadcrumbs, garlic, and parsley and spices.

Made recipe exactly to Chef John's instruction. Instead of adding meatballs to a sauce I simply cooked them longer in the oven (we like burgers well done) @ 30 minutes. SUPER FLAVORFUL recipe, I added lots of parsley ;)  Thanks Chef John!!

easy peasy..  and GREAT tasting!  i had never made meatballs thinking it was hard.  gawd was i wrong!!  :)  my wife said they were the best meatballs she ever tasted. "thanks for the recipe!"

the only thing i changed in the base recipe was using Italian seasoned bread crumbs. and i used the Kroger brand.   after baking, i threw the meatballs in my sauce. 

i made double the portions, and froze half.

Everyone loves these meatballs.  We make in bulk and bring to parties or freeze the rest for quick meals later.   Make exactly as stated - no changes.  Have used dried parsley - still just as good.

Delicious and very, very tender. My sons loved it. I used only medium fat ground pork, not lean. Followed the rest of the ingredients to the letter.  Got 38  small cookie scoop meatballs, which I then gently rolled into loose balls. Baked for 8 minutes on middle rack of 425 oven, on 2 parchment lined cookie trays, then turned each meatball over using tongs and baked for 2 more minutes. Served right away on pasta tossed with tomato sauce and sprinkled with freshly grated Asiago cheese. Meatballs are super tender but don’t break apart when handled. Will be my only meatball recipe from now on!

Followed the recipe exactly and they were delicious!  Added them to a simple tomato sauce and had them over spaghetti.  Rave reviews from the whole family.  Will definitely make them again.

Great recipe, we love 'em!   I've made them two ways now, following the recipe and also by eliminating the bread crumbs and milk to make them low carb.  They were fantastic both ways.

If you make these meatballs for your date i guarantee you that you will either get in a relationship or get married with that person. Yes that's how good they are. Absolutley delicious. Btw I made these changes: as I don't eat pork I made the meatballs with all beef, I did not fry the onions, I did not soak the bread crumbs, and I used panko bread crumbs. I mixed all ingredients together without paying attention the the order and I pan fried them. Came out perfect.

I made this using the Recipe as written.  Our family did like it that way.   After another time or two,  we may try an additional item or two (not that it needs anything, we just like to  “Try”  adjustments to make a customized dish out of recipes).

I LOVE these meatballs. I use the present tense because Im eating leftovers as I write this review. I was looking for a flavorful beef-pork meatball recipe that I could make while purchasing minimal ingredients (money is a bit tight and I had ground beef and ground pork on hand) and these meatballs absolutely satisfied! One of the two batches that I baked these in was a bit overcooked (my bad, forgot to set a timer) and that batch did taste heavily salty but the other batch was bomb.com!! I will DEF repeat this recipe!!

I misread “pork” to read “pork sausage” and I think they are even more amazing than with just pork!!!  They freeze well, it’s an easy recipe, will be making monthly!

This is my go to meatball recipe! We put them on the smoker and then add to homemade sauce, It's a hit with the kids and they ask for it weekly!

my Parmigianino was actually a parm/reggiano mix, and I used more like 3 tablespoons of it instead of 2.    First time making meatballs from scratch,  they turned out good!

Chef John's recipes never disappoint. This one is no exception. I didn't have veal or pork so I just used beef and the meatballs still turned out terrific.

Quite tasty. I used ground turkey instead of pork. They would have been better with pork but I used what I had in my freezer. Very good though with a subtle spice mix.

Came out delicious. I underestimated the flavor prior to making, I felt I had added too much garlic but it came out perfect. My meatballs weren’t as greasy as the other commenters, perhaps because I ground my own meat.  I left out the chili flakes because of my kids but I will be adding them on top for me.

I've made these meatball 5 times over the past 6 months. Actually, i'm going to make them tonight as a surprise for my family. These are fantastic! yummy-riffic. 

The changes made were not because the original recipe wasn't adequate, more to cut out beef. I used Turkey. 
Also the 1st batch was awesome....but were referred to as Fireballs...so be careful of the red pepper flakes.

I did half the recipe, so that may have made the difference. 

The flavor was fantastic and went well with homemade spaghetti sauce and noodles. However, when mixing everything together, the mixture seemed a little too wet. Easy fix though, I added more breadcrumbs and it firmed up.

Will definitely make again.

Another home-run recipe from Chef John.  I love that these meatballs are baked instead of sauteed.  They are very moist if you follow the instructions of letting the breadcrumbs soak in the milk.  Soooooo delicious.  I don't change a thing in the recipe.  Spot-on!

I didn't have any parsley or Italian seasoning, and I forgot the Parmesan cheese. I substituted pasta seasoning and skipped the other two. In spite of those issues, these are the best meatballs I have ever made, and I have been trying all sorts of different recipes. I did bake them longer than it says to because they were clearly not done, and they are still so wonderfully juicy and full of flavor. Thank you Chef John, once again!

Outstanding meatballs. Followed the recipe as written, with the exception that I doubled it. Made almost 6 dozen meatballs!  A little bit of a bite which I loved. Only change next time would be to cut back on the salt a bit. Not overly salty, but a bit more than I prefer.

I used what I had in the house, 1 pound ground beef and 1  Farmland pork and bacon sausage. These turned out fantastic! 

I'm not sure if the recipe called for way too much salt or if it was the sausage I used that made the difference. But for my taste, they were very salty. I'll definitely make these again but adjust the salt.

I use one pound of ground beef, one pound of ground pork, and Progresso breadcrumbs. Mix everything up together (including the chopped onion), make into meatballs, and bake for 15-20 minutes. Easy!

There’s a take-out meatball sandwich place near me. It’s quick, easy and inexpensive. The meatballs are tasty. Because that’s so easy, I hadn’t made my own in quite awhile but one day my husband requested homemade meatballs. I’m not all that big a fan of them. Looked for a new recipe and came across Chef John’s. Made them, and was extremely happy with how much really I liked both the taste and the texture. It’s not a thick, dense bite of meat; it’s a softer, savory one. Must be due to soaking the breadcrumbs in milk. I never like a gritty taste of breadcrumbs, and this receipe avoids that. I made it with 2 lbs. of ground beef as I don’t care for ground pork. I use soft buns for sandwiches, and then add left-over meatballs in spaghetti. What a great recipe!

I LOVE the flavor! I used a mini cookie scooper, 25 balls per batch, 15 min flat and made a TON! I didnt have the garlic so I added powder to grilled onions and to the Big Mixture before adding meat. Also only had dried parsley and still tasted great!! will make again!

These are the BEST Meatballs I have ever made or eaten in a restaurant. This recipe will go down as my  permanent recipe as I will never feel the need to experiment with others.  My only changes were as follows: I used 1 lb of Mild Italian sausage instead of Gr Pork.  Did not have the Italian seasoning so I used 1/2 tsp of Oregano & 1/2 tsp Basil, used only 1/2 tsp Black Pepper  and lastly I used only 1TB of olive oil.  I had never refrigerated my meatballs before cooking, I think this step really helped the meatballs keep their shape since I cooked mine stovetop.  My husband agreed, BEST Meatballs EVER!

The flavor on these is wonderful.  Made this recipe twice.   I sear them a little first because they can leak  juice quite a bit.  I never really use a recipe, but needed to write down one for my husband when he wants to make them himself.  It was easier to print out Chef John's.

These were amazing! Received rave reviews from a wide variety of palates. Even my 4-year-old asked for seconds. That never happens! A small note, it took an extra 7 mins of cooking time to get to temp, but that could just be my oven. Will definitely make again!

I followed the instructions exactly as written and they were FANTASTIC!  The only thing I did differently was to use a small cookie scoop instead of my fingers.  Will definitely be making these again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was absolutely amazing! I made it almost as written, I did all beef. I added the minced garlic in with the onion while in the olive oil to add more flavor. Also I decided to put my milk and bread crumbs mixture in the fridge while preparing and it cut down the sit time in half. I also used a mesh rack over a cookie sheet to cut down on the grease. Easy and delicious, will definitely be using this in the future!

Spectacular meatballs! I made a little change to the meat ratio, heavier on the beef side, only because it's what I had on hand. The resting period in the fridge was longer than suggested because, life! It just made it better. Thanks, Chef John.

Third time with this one. Doubled crumbs, 3 eggs. Set meat balls on sprayed cooling rack. I prefer the "hands on" method of stirring. (Two minutes by hand).

These are very good with the exception of the red pepper flakes.  That made an otherwise good meatball too spicy, which I do not expect from an Italian meatball.  I will also change the ratio of pork to ground beef down as it became too "sausagey" tasting and too spicy for my granddaughter.
 I will keep tweeking this recipe because I think the base of it is very good.

Had to modify the recipe since there are only 2 of us. I used about a pound of mixed beef and pork, about a 1/3 cup of milk, and a 1/4 cup of bread crumbs.  After reducing the rest of the ingredients I followed the rest of the instructions. After cooking at 220 c for 20 minutes I took them out and they were not cooked and were in a shallow pool of liquid. I ended up having to almost double the amount of time to cook. Next time I will use less milk and adjust the cooking temperature and time. The end result though was great!  My wife and I both said best meatballs I had made yet!

This is one of the better meatball recipes I've tried. I  cut back on the hot pepper flake due to the fact that I was 
serving them to senior citizens and my peppers were home grown and really potent.

Made it with pork Italian sausage which spiced it up a bit. Looking forward to making it as written as well. Chef John never disappoints.

Big hit with my belly and my adult son and my kids and their friends.  I was tired of buying plastic meatballs in the frozen section due to not having been taught how to make the meatballs in the traditional southern italian way. Yes this is it and I totally love that I don't have to stand there for over an hour as my Nana Grandmother did sweating and slaving under a hot stove to produce these meatballs. I followed chef johns recipe exactly and all the meatballs were gone and I had leftover pasta. Thank you Chef John and thank you All Recipes for bringing Chef John to us.

Very Good! and pretty simple.   The only thing I did differently was to put racks on the baking sheets so the meatballs were up out of the grease as they good.

Great recipe!

Made these with a third each ground beef, pork and veal.  Used food gloves to roll into balls.  Loved that I didn't have to brown these on the top of the stove.    Simmered in marinara sauce for 2 hours, shape held just fine.  Texture good.  Used homemade breadcrumbs (stale bread run through processor)  Used milk,  not broth, because that is what DH's Sicilian born grandma did.  Served on garlic-butter toasted split rolls. Very pleased with how these turned out.  Thanks CJ!

I didn’t realize that I had to store the meatballs in the refrigerator for an hour. So I added extra bread crumbs so it wasn’t so wet and also placed in the freezer almost 15 mins. I also used ground turkey. After I flipped them they looked like meatball half’s which I don’t mind. I also added mexican cheese. After baking for 15-20 I put them in a pan with tomato sauce and shimmered for 5 mins.

I followed the recipe but did use mostly fresh herbs.  I was surprised by other responses that it was greasy/oily.  I made 35 meatballs on one sheet pan and it was not greasy.  I can only guess these bakers used very fatty meat.  I will make these again.

Really liked the flavor of these meatballs. Really jazz up store bought sauce. I thought I had all the ingredients but I did not have milk or eggs. I made it just fine without. Substituted the milk for 1 bullion cube with a half cup of water and soaked the bread crumbs in that. I left out the eggs completely.

I've been making Chef John's meatballs for a bit over a year. I make them as written, occasionally adding more garlic or more parmesan cheese, depending on my mood. My husband says I should make a candle to replicate the smell of these from start to finish! He won't order meatballs in a restaurant anymore. Between these and Chef John's sauce he's spoiled at home!

Very good recipe. I used beef broth instead of milk and they were a touch salty, so next time I will cut back on the salt or use milk. Perfect consistency and really good flavor, though!

Chef John I feel you should add a disclaimer with this recipe. If your making these for your teen grand children, double the recipe! There won't be any leftover for subs. I may need to work on my science a little, since I ended up with 31 meatballs.  But they kept going back for more till they were all gone. So i'll just have to make another batch for meatball subs. Thanks for another great recipe.

Yummy! I used 2 pounds of lean ground beef instead of the pork-/beef-mixture. I also switched the red pepper flakes to cayenne pepper.

Great Meatballs.  I used a ground chuck from the local butcher shop, it was a little greasy.  I'll use a leaner sirloin next time.   Thank you Chef John!!

I made this recipe exactly as written which I usually do first time out. I have been making good meatballs for over forty years but decided to experiment a bit with Chef John’s recipe. This would have been the perfect meatball if it were not for the red pepper flakes. The heat really came through which disappointed me. Normally I love spicy hot foods but not in my meatballs. I will make them again but next time I will either halve the red pepper flakes or eliminate it.

So yummy! I loved baking these in the oven instead of frying. It freed me up to focus on the other parts of the meal. I didn't refrigerate them (I didn't plan ahead enough) and they turned out just fine.

These were delicious.  One of the best meals I have had in a long time.  I made them just as directed with no changes and then gently placed them into a homemade marinara sauce on the stove to keep them warm until my guests arrived - real crowd pleaser - my guests raved about them.  Even my picky 5-year-old ate like 3 of them.  I tried to do a meatball sub type of thing with provolone cheese, but they are so good, I recommend them just on their own or maybe a top of some spaghetti noodles.

Really Good as written, except I now use 85% lean ground beef not the 80% mentioned in foot note. Plus  now I use Turkey sausage (casing off)  in place of ground  pork .I also start with a little less milk( 1/3 C ish  for a single batch.) BE SURE TO LET THAT MIXTURE SIT 15 TO 20 MINUTES, as written) Also be sure to FULLY  saute onions . Onions have water & need to cook down. See cook time in directions. These tips can help with wetness issues mentioned
  IF meat mixture  is  still too soupy  ( it should feel WET, but not soupy) you can add up to  2 T. more bread crumbs or a little more parm cheese.
Grease run off can be a problem when trying to brown the meat in the oven, b/c they tend to boil in fat or liquid. rather than brown.  I baked mine on foil. no spray. IF fat/ liquid builds up, remove tray from oven, blot with paper towels, then continue to bake.

Easy to make and quite tasty! I paired this with my homemade marinara sauce; mmmm, yum! They held together well and, as Chef John said, they make 30 when you form them a little bigger than golf ball size. Husband and I both enjoyed.

Made it as presented, no changes.  Very good!  I would, however, bake the meatballs next time on a rack over the pan to keep them out of the drippings.

I’m not sure what the criticism is about these being greasy? Maybe the quality of ground meat people are using? To be safe, I used an oven rack, but I really didn’t need it. Browned perfectly. Great taste. Easy. Will make again for sure.

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great.  For anyone curious (as I was) the recipe makes about 50 meatballs that are 1.5in in diameter (mine made 51). I still have no idea how much constitutes a serving, though.

Boy did the family love these!  Recipe made 40 tablespoon-sized meatballs and I had none left after dinner for six.  I agree with other reviewers that next time I will double the amount of Italian seasoning.

These meatballs turned out so soft and juicy! I began a simple sauce with three large cans of Dei Fratelli crushed tomatoes, fresh sliced garlic, dried Italian seasoning, dried basil, extra virgin olive oil, a few sprinkles of sea salt, and homemade Concord grape wine. As that began to simmer, I began making the meatballs. After cooking in oven for less than twenty minute tea to be careful not to dry out the meatballs, I added them to the sauce and added a half stick of unsalted butter to make the sauce “velvety” in texture. I cooked all together for about another hour and we enjoyed meatball sandwiches with Parmesan cheese and shredded mozzarella on top. I did add Parmesan cheese to the meatballs mixture as well. As my parents are from Calabria, it is not customary to add onions in the meatballs, so I omitted them. This was a fabulous recipe! Thank you Chef John!

I have been making meatballs for years, I have tried numerous different methods. I decided to follow (almost follow) this “recipe” for the first time in years. These are excellent and I quadrupled the batch. I used 2 lbs 4% lean beef (because I have a half a cow in my freezer) and 1 lb pork 1 lb hot Italian sausage. I used equal parts bread crumbs and panko soaked in the milk. Everything else was to the recipe. I may have thrown in a little extra sage, because I love it, but these meatballs turned out perfect. I had to space a little more on the pan because pork is fattier (so they wouldn’t steam while they cook), but they were good hot and cold. I still have some left. I sliced them to put on a meat ball pizza. Thank you for the recipe, as now I have a good guideline for the bread crumb ratio.

Very good recipe.  I grind my own meat because I like it course.   Added a bit of extra cheese otherwise followed the recipe.   The recipe makes has a lot of Italian flavor.  I thought the garlic was a bit much but I like it that way.  My kids liked them as well with a few caveats that pointed out that they are used to high-filler content and sweetened food.  These are excellent in marinara topped with extra cheese, add a salad and call it a meal.

These are lovely!  I didn’t have milk so I used beef broth.  I also used dried parsley, what I had.  I used the suggestion of  cooking them on a wire wrack with the baking sheet.  They were moist and tasted awesome!  Iwill definitely use this recipe again.

Delicious! Only made a few tweaks: Used ground turkey instead of ground beef. Didn't use parmesan cheese. Used dried parsley instead of fresh. Didn't precook the onion. I rolled into small balls and cooked in two batches for 20 minutes each. Perfectly done and very flavorful. Will make again definitely!

yup, these are good!  I make them for work and everyone ooohs and ahhhs.  Chef John does it right with the amount of garlic in the meat.  I love when he says (I'll paraphrase) "If your not going to add garlic, make something else-like cereal"

Just finished making these. They're sitting in some tomato sauce right now soaking up goodness and preparing for their debut in meatball sandwiches. I... may have eaten a few 'testers'. I've never been a fan of sauceless meatballs before but holy wowza. I made a few changes to the spices, but nothing wild and I took my torch to them to give them a quick brown after baking but stayed true to the recipe outside that. Hats off. These are delicious, juicy with just a teency kick on the back end. Magnificent.

I scaled to 20 servings as I had 22 ounces of ground beef and pork blend, this yielded 25 meatballs with my #50 scoop that baked in 15 minutes. This was a very tasty recipe, my grocer did not have fresh parsley so I omitted and doubled Italian seasoning, I also omitted the salt. I used the meatballs for open faced meatball sandwiches which were a hit with my family.

First time not frying my meatballs, and cleanup is so much easier. I pretty much followed the recipe, except the recipe I've been using for years includes fennel seed.

Minced the onion, added water instead of milk, also left out the bread crumbs. Threw everything else in a bowl, mixed, rolled and baked at 400 degrees for 25 minutes. So skipped the sauté, skipped the refrigeration. Still turned out super tasty!

I used 1/2 beef 1/2 pork. They turned out awesome! The rest of the ingredients as suggested.  Not greasy at all . I was worried they would fall apart when I added them to my sauce, NOPE, not at all. I love that they are baked. Next time I'll try veal in the mix as I hear that is the way to go. Definitely in the rotation. These were easy to make and delicious!!!

Good recipe, however even though I adore garlic I felt that it was too much for 2 lbs. of meat. It definitely overpowered them to the point that it was the dominating taste and smell. For 2 lbs. of meat 1-1/2 cloves is sufficient-- unless of course you're a real garlic lover, then by all means use the full amount. Of course, feel free to leave it out completely if you're not a fan, regardless of how insistent he is in the video with using it. One other point is that if you're planning on making sauce, go ahead and just drop them raw (no matter how soft or loose they are) right into your pot with a spoon to cook along with it-- there's no need at all to ever bake or fry the meatballs separately. My grandmother would have laughed at that! Any "browning" from the oven will be softened up by the sauce, so that extra step is really useless.

These were great!  I followed the advice of others and squeezed out the excess water from the vegetables and just a little more bread crumbs.  When I make them again I will not do either because I think this made them too dry.   I will make it exactly like the recipe said, because by following it like Chef John said I think they will be more moist.  I gave it 5 stars because I did love them and I feel following it exactly will be great! I thought it did have a tad too much salt but my daughter said they were perfect in flavor.  Thanks for a great recipe

Tried this recipe a couple of times. First go around, thought it was really good, but  seemed a little heavy on the onion. The next go around, I trimmed the onion down to about half of what the recipe calls for and WOW....they turned out  excellent!! Very balanced and moist.

Really delicious!  I used jimmy dean hot sausage and 1 T dried parsley instead of fresh. . I cooked on a cooling rack b/c of the review that said they were soaking.  Hardly any fat came off.  You'd be fine just baking em on a cookie sheet.  Really moist so hard to roll into balls.  I'll just use the cookie scoop next time.  I'm Afraid to ruin them by putting them in sauce!

Stick together, nice and juicy, tons of flavor. My bread crumbs already had Italian seasoning in them so I skipped that and these were DELICIOUS. Especially liked the suggestion to wet hands before making the meatballs. KEY!  Worked like a charm.

I made it  basically exactly as is. Instead of baking it however; I made it in my Instant pot. Added my homemade pasta sauce in the pot, rolled the meatballs dropped them in the pot with the sauce and closed the lid and pressure  cooked for 8 mins.
They turned out amazing! Once the meatballs were done I opened the lid and dropped pasta noodles in and pressure cooked for another 3 mins, the noodles turn out el dente. So this turns out to be a one pot meal no additional pots needed and it it rocks!!!

Great base recipe! Substituted panko bread crumbs and skipped soaking, and the mixture was too wet to form balls. It took quite a bit more breadcrumbs to form a good consistency. But overall the recipe was very easy and tasty! Will make again.

Prep time might take a while but that’s how you get the flavor down!  Sautéing the onions and garlic then adding it in gives a nice touch.  Also added some ground veal since I had that lying around.  Combined with the other ingredients, makes some killer meatballs and gave me leftover lunches for the next few days.  Chef John comes through in the Clutch again!

Wow. Now that's a yummy meatball! I've made this recipe three times now to huge raves by my family. The first two times, to the very letter, the most recent time, due to gross negligence by the produce manager at my local grocer, I was forced to use dried parsley in lieu of fresh. These are AWESOME. So tender and easy to bite into. Great on sandwiches with some sauteed onions and peppers, and even better on fresh pasta with CJ's tomato sauce recipe. You can't go wrong with these babies. Thanks again, Chef John!

Pairs really well with Chef John's Tomato sauce. These are by far the best meatballs I have ever made. Followed the recipe exactly. Made these a few times and they are a crowd pleaser.

I've made these meat balls numerous times, trying different combinations of meat.  I found that using half ground beef and half ground Italian sausage (sweet or hot) makes for the most flavorful meat balls.  Half beef and half veal is also a good combination.  I also found that 1 egg is plenty  for this recipe.

I made these last week for Christmas and they are absolutely the best meatballs ever! Our family devoured them and raved about how good they were.

Only changes made were to blend the onions, garlic, parsley, eggs and spices before adding to the meat, cheese and breadcrumb mixture. Oh, and I doubled up on all ingredients...

Making another double batch today to ring in the New Year, LOL.

Chef John Rocks!!!

Have made these many times, just as the directions say. It’s our families “go to” recipe for meatballs now-they’re the best! Never disappointed when trying anything by Chef John.

I Always follow his recipe for fantastic meatballs. Sometimes I do split the pork amount with veal when it’s available. I add a little less red pepper flakes to mine for personal taste . Hands down these are the best and so close to my own moms recipe.

Straightforward and delicious. Make this on a regular basis and often throw them into homemade pasta sauce and simmer for while. Yummy!

These meatballs are amazing! The only ingredient I left out was parsley because I didn't have any. This recipe has a little heat with the red pepper flakes but you could leave that out if you don't like spicy food. I love spicy food. You also can really taste the garlic. This is the second time I have made this recipe. I highly recommend!
ps. In reading a couple other reviews complaining about too much liquid. I used ground beef with only 7% fat. So be sure to use a lean ground beef. They will brown nicely and won't be swimming in liquid.

I have made these twice now, and I think they are missing something. I am not sure what. I think I would use, as somebody suggested, beef broth instead of milk to give them more flavor.

Modified the recipe to include equal parts ground beef, pork and veal. Made bite-size meatballs to include in a lasagna recipe. Will use this recipe again and will make them larger to eat with other pasta dishes.

I made these the first time as written and really enjoyed them.  However, I now make a few changes that work better for us and cut down on the prep time.  We omit the onion and garlic because I always serve them in sauce that has plenty.  Italian breadcrumbs in place of plain (still throw in the italian seasoning) and use less than 1/2 cup of milk.  One egg instead of 2.  Leave out the salt or cut it way down and instead add a dash or two of worcestershire sauce.  Finally, I don't chill and broil them in lieu of baking because it results in better browning and cuts down on cooking time.   

These are great paired with the sauce from the world's best lasagna recipe.  I adapt that recipe a bit by omitting the sugar, cutting the salt back to 1/2 teaspoon, using red wine instead of water, and adding fresh basil after it's off heat instead of using dried.

I left the meatballs in a little longer to give it a nice crisp outside. These meatballs were very close to the  recipe I have used for year which was given to my family by our Italian neighbor. These were really good.

Excellent recipe. However, next time I make it I will DOUBLE the Italian Spices as I prefer a stronger flavor when making meatballs with a sauce.   I used WHEAT bread for the bread crumbs, which worked just fine. Be careful not to over bake because meatballs will be a dryer texture if over baked, resulting in a bit tougher texture. All in all, this recipe is excellent, delicious and easy to make!!!

We used only beef mince and made the recipe into rissoles which we pan-fried, topped with homemade tomato sauce and found them to be delicious. The only other change I made was less salt (reduced by 1/3), and it was still plenty flavoursome enough for us.

I made these as-is, and geez they are wayyyy too salty.  Cut the salt in half or even just use 1/2 tsp.  Why on earth are there 2 teaspoons of salt in this recipe?  Great flavor other than that

A+ I was a little hesitant after reading reviews saying the meatballs were too liquidy. Have no fear, I followed the recipe to a tee and they turned out just fine. I did broil them for a few minutes at the end for good measure. These taste better than the Nirvana Meatballs. ??

These meatballs were fantastic!  My whole family loved them.  I stuffed them with a little square of mozzarella before cooking and I made a double batch so I cooked some in my tomato sauce and some as directed in the oven.  Both were off the charts great.

Made it exactly as written, using half 80% lean ground beef and half ground pork. They were amazing. My new go-to meatball recipe!

Because I normally make it for my family, who don't really like spicy things, I normally exclude the red chili flakes (Almost put Red Hot Chili Peppers). It doesn't really take away from the taste, it's still really good, you just have to change it a bit to fit your needs.

Really great recipe! I made a few changes for personal preference, however. I used ground beef & turkey, skipped the garlic and fresh parsley, used Italian breadcrumbs with an extra teaspoon of Italian herbs, added extra red pepper flakes, cut down a little on the salt, and baked them for around 35 minutes or so at 425 with an additional 5 minutes of broiling. Then I simmered them in tomato sauce, and served them with spinach linguine. I made 1.5x the recipe, and ended up with around 32-34 delicious, ice-cream-scoop-sized meatballs :-)

I made these hoping to freeze some, but we ate them all fresh!! The only thing I changed was adding more breadcrumbs.  They were very good and will make them again.

These are great! I only had 1.5 lbs of ground beef 73% because I knew there would be a great deal of grease I baked them on a rack. I used all other ingredients as is. After baking I added the meatballs to the pasta sauce.  The fam loved it!

I did take his recommendation to use 1/2 the parsley amount for the first time out. The meatballs were great. They had a very little kick from the herbs and parsley.


I made a mistake reading the recipe and did not have time to do the long simmer in sauce. I baked them an extra 15 minutes instead and they were great. Next time I will put them in the sauce. 

The nice part about not simmering in the sauce this time was that I was able to take half of them and store for a few days later. I heated them up in a saucepan with a little olive oil and water, tossed them on some pasta with sauce, and had a very quick and tasty lunch for us.

The only change I made to the recipe is that I used seasoned panko breadcrumbs and skipped the Italian seasonings. For the procedure, I broiled the meatballs till only the tops were browned and finished cooking in the sauce. They were amazing. I was looking for a recipe that blended a little browning for flavor but cooking in the sauce for silkyness and that's exactly what happened with these.

Great recipe, take som time to do but they are worth it.  As we are only 2 in the household, I froze ½ the meatballs and they are still great after 1-2 weeks in the freezer.

I've been cooking Italian food for decades.  I make fresh sausages  butcher and grind my own meats.  This recipe uses nearly the same ingredients I've always used for meatballs but what caught my eye was the baked technique.  i was intrigued to see how that would work out.  I made a double batch using a meat blend of about 30% venison, 30% beef brisket, and 30% ground pork. Very close to 80-20 fat ratio.  I used the larger amount of parsley mentioned in the video and simply because I had it on hand I added some pecorino along with the Reggiano Parmesan.  The roasted balls were added to a very nice slow cooked sauce along with some browned sausages and was simmered for about 2 hours.  I heard music when we all sat around the table and enjoyed these great meatballs and other goodies.  I believe these to be as good as any Ive had and better than most.   I believe careful meat selection and proper handling is key to these great meatballs. Just my thoughts.   Thank you Chef John.

So simple but such a big hit with the framily. The only change I made was adding ground fennel seeds to the mix. I felt it upped the Italian a notch.

I'd really like to give this recipe 5 stars but there is TOO MUCH SALT!
I was skeptical when I read the recipe but not wanting my meatballs to turn out bland I stuck with the 2 teaspoons of salt that the recipe calls for. I had 1lb ground beef and 1.5lbs ground pork - I figured with the extra half pound of pork maybe I'd need all that salt anyway. WRONG!
Other than this, the meatballs were great. I didn't have parsley but had a ton of basil so added that instead. Fresh herbs help any recipe tremendously. But the salt! Agh! So annoying, because I kind of knew in the back of my mind 2 tsps is too much. Next time I will halve the salt and see if that helps.

Lots of garlic.  I like garlic, but might use a tad less next time.  I would make these again.  They held up well in the marinara sauce and were easy to make.

These were great! Made them exactly per recipe. Wish I hadn’t used as much dried Italian seasoning as the recipe stated because it made them a little gritty. Baked on a rack over a sheet pan, which kept them from being too greasy. Had friends over and everyone loved them. Simmered in marinara about three hours before serving. Yum!

Very flavorful and different, but after trying this recipe I now know that I prefer my meatballs to be mostly meat. This recipe has a lot of other ingredients which add more bulk but take away from the soft meatiness I enjoy. I might make them again. This made 45 meatballs with a small portion scoop, which then I simmered in 2 jars of pasta sauce.

Made this for "Family Italian Sunday" and everyone loved them!!  Used the meatloaf mix as recommended by another and followed the recipe as written.  I was a bit apprehensive after reading about soggy bottoms etc. but that did not happen, except for normal juices from ground meats.  Will be making these again and again they are that good!  Thank you Chef John for yet another amazing recipe!!!

Like most of the people here that have reviewed, I made y own little changes to this already amazing recipe. I cut down on the milk to 1/3 cup and added blended red pepper for that extra bit of flavour. I also fried them in oil prior to putting them in the oven, and when I did put them in the oven, I put them in crushed tomatoes with pepper and olive oil just so they'd absorb that much more flavour. All in all they were a big hit, and I will enjoy these with my signature spaghetti sauce. 5/5 stars!

I follow you faithfully. But sorry on this one Johnny. Spices? On the money. Other ingredients? Check!  Now... Far less milk please. Also , darken the bread crumbs in a frying pan until nearly burned and then set aside. You won't believe the difference this makes in the taste. But lastly -  and most importantly! - make the balls about the size of a one Euro or a US quarter coin - because this makes them bite size. NOT  mini meatloaves that squat like mastadons in your elegant, delicate sauces and pastas. And DEFINITELY go that messy extra step of frying them because of the control aspects and overall taste.
Then-a you got-a perfect-a meat-a ball-a!
With love,
David

Delicious recipe.  I had to substitute gluten free breadcrumbs, nonsweetened almond milk and nutritional yeast for the Parmesan in order to make them gluten-free & dairy-free ( & 1/2 the salt  )My daughter requests these all the time & my son has no clue they are GF/DF.  Thank you so much Chef John

The only change was the meat. I used antelope sausage.  My family loved it.

I made these and they turned out amazing. I used seasoned bread crumbs instead of plain and cooked for 30 mins. They are full of flavour.

We might try pan frying them or baking them on a broiling pan next time for a crispier outside. The flavor was great. We went lower fat on the beef than the recipe recommended and there was still plenty of grease.

Delicious!  Easy to make.  Very moist.  I used panko bread crumbs  & they worked nicely.  I used a Pampered Chef large scoop to make the meatballs & it was a great size.  Cooked 20 minutes & they were perfectly cooked.  Checked at 15 & felt they needed that extra 5.  I had read all the reviews & expected more grease/juice based on a negative review.  There wasn't much at all.  It may just depend on the quality of meat that you buy.  Certainly not dry!  My husband & I both commented about how moist they were.  It's actually a very wet meatball before cooking, so I was a bit concerned.  But they were very nicely moist!  I think for people who think the texture is wrong, you might be used to commercially made, dense meatballs.  Which are texturally gross to me.  I did cook on parchment paper.  This is my new recipe.

I improvised just a bit as I had some hot Italian sausages, but no pork on hand. I made 1/2 batch with the meat from two sausages and 1/2 lb of 90% lean ground beef. Thought I had Italian spice blend, but I didn’t so I used oregano and basil. Also did not have any parsley.  Everything else I used per the recipe. I think they are the best meatballs I’ve made and can’t wait to make them with all the right ingredients. If I do I’ll try to remember to update the review.

The meatballs won raves from my guests. I had some doubts because they did not brown in the oven without an extra 10 minutes and I was afraid they would be dry. . So I put them in my sauce in the crockpot for a couple of hours on low. Moist ender and deliciously seasoned! Excellent Chef John!!

I made them last night just like the recipe said, except i didn't let them rest in the fridge for an hour, my family was hungry and couldn't wait 
They were delicious and moist, next time I'll add more pepper flakes and more Italian seasoning just my preference, but really yummy meatballs everyone enjoyed it

Have several meatball recipes and of course like some more than others. I just made them and taste tested one before putting into the sauce. Then a second one. Then a third. Mmmm. This is a contender. I didn't have an onion and don't miss not having them in meatballs sometimes anyway.

Really simple, really good. Don't get hung up on the exact measurements and I think it's fine to take a degree of personal license with this recipe, but bread crumbs soaked in milk seems to give this a wonderful texture and flavor.

This recipe makes flavorful, tender, firm meatballs. These meatballs are firm enough to load into sauce or even sandwiches or lasagna yet at the same time are tender. No hockey pucks here! So incredibly tasty too. I used to make Rachel Ray's recipe but now this will be my go-to meatball recipe. I'm usually a lean meat person but followed the recommended 80% lean and wasn't disappointed. A lot of the fat Cooks out, meanwhile the meat is basted in its juices while cooking. I had to cook mine longer than listed because my oven is a bit off and I wasn't adding to sauce right after. I tripled the batch so calculated the recipe amounts accordingly. I plan to freeze them.   These are so good it's like candy. My family thought they were wonderful also. They said they definitely want to eat them again. I didn't get 30 Meatballs per 2lbs of meat. I got a little over half that.

I wound up using 1/2 pork and 1/2 turkey with a red onion. No parsley, so I used fresh basil. Otherwise I followed the recipe. I topped with a light tomato sauce. Absolutely delicious!

These were so flavorful and juicy and seasoned to perfection.   I substituted ground beef for turkey and added olive oil to the turkey mixture.  After allowing them to cook in the oven for 15 minutes, I placed them in the marinara sauce to finish cooking for another 10 minutes.  Then, I placed them on french bread with provolone cheese and they were  a hit.

Oh my goodness these are good! I wanted to eat the whole batch they're absolutely addicting. As john says in the video, succulent is for sure a word to describe them! Only changes I made were substituting dried parsley over fresh and onion powder over onions because it's what I had on hand. Oh and I used Jimmy Dean pork sausage instead of ground pork over preference, it's what my mom uses in her meatballs. These aren't like my mama's meatballs but that's ok because they are sooooo good!

These were middle of the road. Not bad...not great. Too dry baked in the oven at recommended time and temperature. If I use this recipe again I will reduce time and temp or brown on top of stove.  I'm going to search for a different MB recipe.

I had to cut the recipe in half and was in a rush. I didn't have time to saute the onions and used onion flakes.  I didn't have to time to soak the bread crumbs. I didn't have time to put the meatballs in the fridge first. Even with all these shortcuts I had to make, the meatballs were still very good!

Without a doubt, the best meatballs that I have ever had. The seasoning is just right and the taste is unbelievable. Spend the extra money on your sauce or make your own lest you take away from these tasty morsels.

Thank you, these are the best meatballs ever.  Had 93% lean beef and sweet Italian sausage in fridge, otherwise made as directed.  Weren't greasy, didn't use cooling rack, baked for 22 mins and simmered in your basic tomato sauce.  Amazing!!!!!

These are delicious and easy.  Made exactly as written.  Used regular white bread w/crusts removed, but next time, I may use Martin's potato bread.  I was a bit hesitant because the mixture was very moist, but leaving it in the fridge for an hour made a big difference.  With wet hands, the meatballs formed very easily.  I did bake for 25 minutes - using a meat thermometer, I felt the meatballs needed another 5 minutes (b/c of the pork).  My husband did the "happy dance".

Excellent meatballs - used beef/pork/veal mixture rather than just beef and pork as recipe shows but meatballs were very tasty and texture was great! Baked them as called for and then put them in the sauce in the crock pot about 1 1/2 hours before finished. Great meal

I'm Sicilian, and I've never been able to recreate my grandma's meatballs. I found this recipe and tried it. While they aren't my grandma's meatballs, they are DELICIOUS! Next time I will cut the salt in half. I love the red pepper flakes. I would never have thought to add it. I will definitely make these again!  Yum!

Too much milk. Pretty good flavour and they hold together well in tomato sauce. I will keep looking for a great recipe.

My husband loves spaghetti and meatballs, so, I thought I would try a new recipe.  Chef John's recipe was a big hit!  The texture of the meatballs was more tender and delicate than using all ground beef. They had great flavor!  The only thing I would change is reduce the salt.  They were a tad too salty for us.  Thanks for the recipe! UPDATE:  7/27/17 I froze part of these meatballs and defrosted later to use as an appetizer with sweet and sour sauce.  They froze beautifully and were still delicious.  I would recommend browning them slightly after thawing.

I used my broiler pan to bake them. That way, the meatballs didn't sit in grease. The flavor is wonderful. They do have a kick so you may want to eliminate the red pepper. We like the kick.

The best meatballs I have ever tasted. The first time I made them using only hamburger, by accident.  They were delicious, so the second time I followed the recipe and they truly are delicious.  I never order them at a restaurant because they are usually enormous and you need a steak knife to cut into them.  I have just started my own cookbook for my personal use and these are definitely worth the extra time.  It is a keeper!

This is my to go to meatball recipe and I have shared it with many of my family and friends.  It's easy and very delicious. I make Chef John's tomato sauce to go with these meatballs. I use an ice cream scoop to measure each one and I smoke them on my wood pellet smoker; which makes them taste even better. They freeze very well. This is a must try and it will not disappoint. Enjoy!

I love Chef John's recipes.  These meatballs are awesome.  I use hamburger meat, ground italian sausage and pork.  I also use Progresso garlic and herb breadcrumbs.  Very good.  I could eat them all myself.

I followed this with the type of everything recommended, It came out perfect. some people say they fell apart... You do kind of have to compress a meatball to keep the shape.... Regardless to what is going into it. I used jalapeno in place of garlic since i did not have any. It was so good.  This will be made many more times.

This meatball recipe is a must try! Very easy to make and nice that they are baked so you don't have to stand over the stove and fry them in oil! I added 2 heaping tbsp fulls of Parmesan cheese! Yum! =)

I noticed some of the reviews and if you find at the end of 20 minutes they are not browned or there's still a lot of liquid, you might need to bake them a little longer. I thought 15 minutes would be enough however, I kept them in for the full 20 minutes at 420 degrees instead of 425 degrees. Time and temp may vary.

I found these to be the best meatballs I ever made.  I've made them 3 times. The time they came out best was when I followed the recipe, except I used dried parsley and 93% ground beef as that was all I had. The second time I made them I used half ground beef and half pork and didn't care for them as much. The 3rd time I went back to 88% beef only and they were really  good.
Although its just me and my husband I make the full amount which I found made about 25 meatballs.  I freeze the leftovers for future meals.

I adore this meatball recipe. Super easy to make and very, very tasty. I usually substitute the plain ground pork for mild Italian Sausage. YUM.

I followed this recipe exactly and it was just a tad under seasoned to me, in all fairness I like spice, so next time I will add more red pepper flakes, I did use these with spaghetti and meat sauce, so I was proactive and added one can of rotel to the sauce, I am sure these are awesome for normal people, but I need spice :)

I made this again today except I used a lb of ground venison instead of beef, made my own bread crumbs, and used heavy cream rather than milk . I also added a little bit more crushed red pepper and italian seasoning to my liking. Ive made this recipe before as written and both ways have come out phenominal. My new go-to recipe for meatballs.

This recipe is delicious! The second time I made them, I totally skipped the bread crumbs/milk as I was trying to reduce carbs, and they were still as delicious as the original recipe and held their shape just as the original recipe! The tip of having them portioned with the help of an ice cream scoop is great and gave me much less work than the first time that I made them entirely with my hands, as it makes them all the same size easily and my hands  almost have not gotten dirty this time. I also freeze them and just need to let them extra 8-10 minutes in the oven (I like to use the broil for 2 minutes so I make them with a little bit of a crusty outside without the need of browning in a skillet). I actually used lean ground beef only (accounting for the 2lb in the recipe), as it is the ground meat I usually have at home. Also, I usually add the liquids in which the meatballs seat after cooking to my sauce, which gives it extra flavour! Perfect! I will make triple batch next time because it really does not last long at home, even being just 2 of us living here! :)

I read one review that said to use 1/3 cup of milk instead of 1/2.  That was the only change I made.  I forgot to spray the foil on my second pan and they stuck a little.  It does make a difference.  The meatballs were delish.  This  recipe is a keeper!

These are probably the tastiest meatballs I've ever eaten, let alone made.  I will chose a less sweet spaghetti sauce the next time, or will probably make a favorite from scratch.  A marinara would work.  No extra sauce flavors required due to complex meatball combination.

First off, I have to say that I hate when people change the recipe then rate the recipe. However, I am one of those people today. I didn't have the luxury of putting these meatballs directly into a sauce, since my Bro made the sauce and I was in charge of the rest of the meal. SO, I followed the recipe WITH the exception of Italian seasoning, I only had Oregano.  And I had already bought panko bread crumbs seasoned with Italian seasonings. Everything else was per the recipe listed. I browned the meatballs in olive oil and baked them at 425 degrees for 12 minutes. The result?  Juicy, perfectly seasoned meat. Fantastic! I would highly recommend this recipe. I think it is fool-proof. Thank you.  I love this recipe.

I found this recipe to be easy and fun to make. I'm 63 years old and have never made a decent meatball in my life. 

I watched several of Chef Johns videos on meatballs and that, together with this well written recipe, is what finally guided me to success!  The only change I made was that I reduced the recipe by half. I thought "30 servings" might mean 60 meatballs but it doesn't. It means 30 meatballs since the half recipe produced exactly 15. 

Now, onward to Chef John's recipe for lamb meatballs because, like chef John, I love lamb!  Thank you Chef John!

Good but don't forget to turn the meatballs while they bake,. Ya kind of obvious but earth noting they need to be turned every 3-4 minutes to get the outside to be equally browned.

Because my granddaughter's fiancé is lactose intolerant, I substituted beef broth for the milk and excluded the parmesan cheese.  I  don't care for spicy hot so no hot pepper flakes and I didn't have fresh parsley so I used 1 teaspoon of dried parsley flakes.  The meatballs were easy to make. First I chilled them in the refrigerator so they were easy to form then baked them in the oven.  Just before serving I warmed the meatballs in tomato sauce.  My granddaughter and I sprinkled cheese over the spaghetti and meatballs.  Delicious...definitely a keeper and I plan to make this recipe again.

I think this is my favorite recipe for meatballs that I've found so far.  Chef John is one of my go-to's on Allrecipes.com.  These meatballs were to die for!  The half beef/half pork mixture is so much better than using just ground beef alone.  I also loved the fresh parsley - it really gives the meatballs a professional touch.  This recipe makes a lot and I usually freeze the leftovers to put in sauce and serve with pasta for an easy weeknight meal.

Excellent recipe! They have become a staple in our house. I use gluten free breadcrumbs and onion powder or dehydrated onion (to get the flavour, but hide the onion from a fussy eater!) I've made them many times now, and they are perfect every time. No more store bought meatballs for us!

These homemade meatballs are way better than store bought. Sometimes I like making 2 to 3 inch meatballs. They make and excellent meal by them self with sauce and some mozzarella cheese melted over top.

This is fantastic and really flavorful, the soak bread crumbs is fantastic idea.  I've made meat balls before with different recipes this is the best meatballs I've made so far and my husband agreed, I did not really change anything with the recipe however I did not measure everything exact.  I did add garlic powder to the meat and ground pepper along with season salt.

I followed the recipe as written. These meatballs  are fantastic! I like my meatballs to taste meaty and these taste meaty. Mine were not swimming in liquid at all.

I made Chef John's meatballs and they turned out perfectly. I baked them for 20 minutes, rather than 15, and they were lightly browned and cooked through. I made sure to keep the meatballs 1 1/2 inches in diameter so they would be cooked through. My family loved them.

This is a good recipe for meatballs if you are making spaghetti but 425F is way too hot for my oven, and the meat balls were coming out burnt. So I turned my oven down to a a "kinder and gentler" temperature of 350F.

Also, after extensive scientific analysis (trial and error), I came to the conclusion that 1.7 ounces is the perfect size for a meat ball. To be practical, however I give or take .2 ounces per meatball either way, so 1.5 to 1.9. Once you weigh about 15 meatballs it is easy to get the correct size. Furthermore, to get better heat distribution, I bake these on top of a raised rack  on a sheet pan in a convection oven. That way they don't tend to overcook or burn on one side and you don't have to keep turning them. Now these meat balls are coming out just as I like them! Succulent, tasty and NOT burnt!

I make the full recipe and then portion out so my husband and I can enjoy for a delicious quick meal. Very versatile for other meatball recipes. Have shared with all my friends. I usually substitute ground turkey instead of pork (maybe a bit healthier but still delish!)

Had some ingredients I needed to use up, so decided to make meatballs.  These came out delicious. Great middle ground between too meaty and too much filler. I didn't follow exactly, though.  I halved the recipe, mostly by eyeballing it, because that's how I cook.  I used all beef, and I had to use dried parsley. My husband "doesn't like" onions, so I used onion powder. I also had about 4 ounces of baby Bella mushrooms to use, so I cooked them lightly, minced them  (husband also "doesn't like" mushrooms, but what he doesn't know...),and mixed those in too.

I have celiac disease so I used gluten free breadcrumbs instead of regular breadcrumbs. I also used only 1/3 cup milk per a few other reviewer's suggestions. And I used dried parsley because that's what I had on hand. I broiled them for 10 minutes at the end of cooking as well, turning once at 5 minutes. Otherwise, I followed the directions. They meatballs were moist and delicious. I think next time I may use beef broth in place of the milk to add a bit more flavour to them but my son and I both ate our plates clean!

Excellent! My husband bought ground Italian sausage instead of ground pork, but I followed the recipe with that main difference.  They still turned out terrific.  I had way too many meat balls for the two of us, but I refrigerated some immediately after baking them, to use in meat ball subs later this week.  I will definitely make these again.

Most delicious, tender meatballs with leftovers to freeze or share! The only addition I made was a handful of fresh basil leaves minced, and a handful of non instant oatmeal. I skipped the 'refrigerate for an hour' before forming due to timing, but had no trouble with consistency.  This is a keeper!

Wow, this recipe is absolutely delicious!! Total score. I've made meatballs before and these were far better. Someone else who reviewed this recipe said it was more about process (soaking the breadcrumbs first, sautéing the onions, refrigerating the mixture etc.) and I think they were right. I used all ground beef and that was just fine. I baked the meatballs for 18 minutes and they came out perfectly - they were browned just right and I don't think you'd be able to tell that they weren't pan fried. I loved not having to fry them with all of the mess that makes. This is going to be my go-to meatball recipe from now on. 5-plus stars!! Husband absolutely loved them too!

Made this recipe as per directions, but didn't use as much parsley as Chef John.  The meatballs were perfect.  I made a marinara at the same time and let both sauce and meatballs rest overnight in the fridge.  I put the sauce on to simmer and added several meatballs the next morning.  The meatballs easily held up in the sauce.  My 10-yr old son ate some extra meatballs, plain, after everything was put away, so that's sayin' something!  Chef John is my personal favorite, so I'm a tad biased, but these will be our go-to meatballs going forward.  Thank you Chef!

Not a meatball fan, but my son requested them for his birthday dinner.  Chef John has never let me down so I tried these.  Had to use gluten-free bread crumbs but other than that didn't change anything.  They were easy to make and so good!  The whole family LOVED them, even the ones who aren't crazy about ground beef.  Definitely a keeper.

My husband and I are Paleo/Primal. I have tried many meatball recipes over the years leaving out the bread crumbs but they always fail. I made these last night, let them sit in the refrigerator overnight and baked them at lunch time. They were delicious!! They held together so well and leaving out the milk and bread crumbs did not affect them at all. I will be using this as my only meatball recipe from now on! Can't wait to share this with my friends!!!

Made these for monthly family dinner. 3 sons, 2 grandsons  scattered within 50 miles of us. They were super easy and great and not 1 of the 100 meatballs I made were left. Dang was hoping for leftovers! Will definitely make again! Served with my homemade marinera sauce, spaghetti, garlic bread and Caesar salad. Making again today for a spaghetti dinner tomorrow and meatball subs the next as I have long hours those days. Hope to have some to freeze, too, since there will only be 2 of us! Just using ground beef this time though I know they are better with pork added in the mix.

Superb recipe!!! *note, I haven't put them in sauce to see how they hold up but flair and texture are amazing!!* I added garlic to the sautéing onions and didn't have fresh parsley on hand so I used dried. I also subbed the regular breadcrumbs for Italian herb bread crumbs... with those very minor changes, I cooked them as stated (the the bread crumbs soak and put them in the fridge) and they turned out amazing!!! I read a review that said they were no good because they were drenched in oil while they cooked, well I had a wire rack Covered with foil that I put toothpick holes in for the fat to drop through and into a baking sheet. They browned up nicely and, again, the taste was out of this world. Will definitely make again!!

Delicious.  Love Chef John's recipes.  Used ground turkey which was delicious.
Roasted a sweet Italian sausage with the meatballs and added it to tomato sauce with the meat balls.

Very good recipe.  I have made it twice. I halved the recipe and used all ground beef.  The 2nd time I made it I forgot to let it sit for an hour and it still came out good.  Some people mentioned they should have used less milk because they were too moist.  If the meat was previously frozen that is what may have caused the problem because being previously frozen adds moisture to ground meat.  It's probably best to use less milk when using from frozen.

These are, quite simply, the best meatballs ever. Hubs said so himself, and there were plenty to hold back for leftovers and the freezer! I changed nothing!

A small twist - added in two diced jalapeños, and took small liberty with the crushed red pepper flakes. Momma Mia- these were delicious!

I added these to spaghetti and it was yummmmm. I made mine in a glass dish and to make sure they were nicely browned I baked for 18 minutes at 425 and about 3 minutes on broil. I followed the recipe all except I used a red onion because I prefer red onions in everything (they don't require as much skillet time either) :) and I also only had roasted garlic breadcrumbs, which probably didn't make much difference because there is garlic in the recipe already.

Excellent flavor with  a fluffier texture than one expects in a meatball, that was infinitely appealing.

Another winner of Chef John's recipes!  My husband loves meatball sandwiches so I gave this a try tonight for our vday meal.They were moist and full of flavor.  I didn't have parsley or fresh garlic but garlic powder worked just as well.  I cut back on the salt too.  Will be making this again and again!

It made a beautiful mix from which to form meatballs. It's definitely a keeper recipe for us. We plan to try the same mix the next time we make meatloaf.

I loved that I didn't have to fry the meatballs and health wise a lot of the fat seeped out when baking. They were excellent and will add this recipe to my "Look-No-More" binder. Thanks, Chef John.

Most Delicious meatballs!  However, I did not bake them in the oven. I added the meatballs uncooked into my Italian Red Sauce using San Marzano tomatoes. I cooked them for four plus hours. A real crowd pleaser.

This is THE meatball recipe I will be using. I did make some changes, but not that many and only because I was feeling lazy...no parsley, so I left that out, used "Italian" bread crumbs because I didn't have plain, didn't want to chop/cook onion, so I used dry. I also used a whole bulb of roasted garlic because I had already roasted a ton for my sauce.   I cooked them at 425 for 30-35 miuntes and dumped them into my pot of sauce.

loved it, easy to make, I made it with just 1lb of ground beef and then I cut everything else in half. The video was helpful as I have never made meatballs before.

I made this exactly as directed, except I only used half the salt (bf is on a restricted diet).  The recipe is certainly time consuming (give yourself a least 2-3 hours), but it was very easy to make.  I paired the meatballs with "Chef John's Tomato Sauce", and made a DELICIOUS meal for my  other half.  Another 5 star recipe from Chef John!!

Yep I will make it again.  Used 1/3 pork, 1/3 beef and 1/3 veal.  Also used crushed saltines as I didn't have any bread crumbs.
Nice and spicy.  Some people might want to cut back on the red pepper flakes.  Fantastic

This is by far the best meatball recipe I've tried.  It has quickly become my go-to recipe.  I make in big batches and freeze so I always have them on hand.  The recipe is perfect the way it is!!

Easy to follow recipe and the first time I made them I did just that. I did place them on a wired cooling rack when I baked them so the grease collects in the pan below. Made 4 pounds of meat for a football game and they wete all gone!
Second time I made them, I omitted the parm and placed a disc of sliced frozen string cheese to the center of the meatball before rolling. Sooooo fantastic!

Easy and delicious recipe-  I used dried herbs with no compromise to flavor. I like to make a big batch and freeze in a ziploc bad (lay flat and add cooled meatballs). Great last minute meal!!

These are the best!  Although, I don't usually have the time to refrigerate the meat mixture or sweat the onions, it really does make all the difference!  They make great leftovers!  We like to have them on a hoagie roll the next day with some provolone melted over.  I am currently making a double batch to freeze to have easy meals after my surgery.  You can never go wrong with one of Chef John's recipes!

I dislike having to sign up for a website, but that was the only way I could rate this recipe.  I have to say, my meatball were amazing!  Thank you so much!  I have spent many times trying to make them and they turned out to be a waste of time and money, to only end up with sausage for my sauce. Evenutally, I resorted to frozen meatballs in my home made sauce. I found this recipe and thought I would try again.  This will be used again for sure!  I love the different things done in the recipe, such as mixing the milk and bread crumbs and letting them sit for 20 min.  That made mixing so much better. Also putting in refrigerator before baking.  I added them to my sauce and they were delicious!  I had to cover them to keep my kids  (and myself) from eating them before the party!  Thank you!

Very good recipe with no changes. B the red pepper flakes really added a nice zip.   I put the all the ingredients in my food processor and I was afraid it was going to ruin the texture but they were still great.  I baked them on Jin stick foil and I literally had ZERO mess.

This recipe was easy to follow! The meatballs turned out amazing and melted in your mouth. I didn't do actual garlic or onion as my husband does not like the texture, so I did onion and garlic powder. I didn't measure the ingredients and it had great flavor!

This is my go-to recipe.  My own tweaks are to grind fresh bread to create crumbs / no milk, 
 a nice squirt of  Sriracha instead of red pepper flakes, and allow the meat to absorb all the flavors  for several hours or overnight.

These were great! Definitely will be my go-to meatball recipe from now on. At a friends suggestion, I soaked 2 slices of bread (torn into small pieces) in milk in place of the breadcrumbs. Because of some reviews complaining of swimming meatballs after baking, I baked them on top of a cooling rack that fit into my baking sheet. But this step seemed unnecessary because there was not a ton of liquid after they baked. I think it just depends how lean the beef is. I also had to skip the Italian seasoning because I didn't have any, but they still came out delicious. Can't wait to make them again!

This recipe was great!  The meatballs had excellent flavor and were moist and tender.  I made two minor adjustments.  The first is that I reduced the amount of milk by 1/3 and the second adjustment is that I browned the meatballs before baking.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

Chef John never disappoints. These meatballs are awesome with just the right spice and texture. They are a bit fussy to make but well worth the effort. I thought of skipping the step of sautéing the onions in oil but glad I didn't because they were perfect. Also important to chill the completed mixture before rolling into balls so allow plenty of time. No shortcuts here. A family favorite from now on.

These were delicious!!! I followed the recipe exactly, except I used all beef and I quadrupled the recipe (I decided to make meatball subs for football Sunday get together).... I also rolled the meatballs bigger than suggested, I bought 4 big loaves of garlic bread and filled with the meatballs after they were baked and simmered in sauce... I covered the subs with Italian blend shredded cheese and sprinkled Italian seasoning on top, then put them in the oven to get melty, then cut them into small sections, that were still huge lol...the garlic butter sauce or whatever it is in the middle of the garlic bread really went deliciously with the pasta sauce I used and flavor of the meatballs... Best meatball subs I've ever had, so said everyone else at the party as well... Definitely a recipe to keep

NO CHANGES NEEDED!  I usually make Swedish meatballs, but hubs loves Italian food so I decided to surprise him. THESE are delicious. I hope he gets to try some before my kids and I eat them all. No sauce is necessary; the meatballs are tender and delicious as is. I will admit to one change though because I dont use breadcrumbs: one slice of my homemade sourdough bread soaked in the milk.

Love the meatballs made it like the recipe. I also added 1lbs of ground Italian mild sausage to the recipe and did change anything else love them both way. On I side note I found if you use a 1/4 measuring cup makes perfect 2" meatballs.

I made these last night and they were delicious!  Here's what I changed:  chicken broth instead of milk, ground turkey instead of pork,  dried parsley (1TB) instead of fresh,  omit the salt and parmesan cheese.  I also soaked the bread crumbs in chicken broth in the same large bowl I used to mix everything else--no need to dirty another bowl.  I used a rack over a foil covered sheet pan so the meatballs and fat were kept separate.  Finally, I baked them for 25 minutes total to brown them.  The meatballs held together just fine and the cooked onions and liquid kept them moist.  I will definitely make these again!

Made the recipe as written, and found it to be a keeper.  
The only difference is I seasoned the meats and left them in the fridge overnight.  The next morning I added the milk soaked breadcrumbs, parsley and eggs.  I cooked the meatballs in the oven at 425 for 15 minutes, then 450 for another 5 and 475 for another 5, until I got some color on them.  They were not overdone, and actually came out perfect in taste and texture.  Flavorful, tender yet held up to soup and sauce.  
I ate two of them out of the oven and found them fantastic on their own, and I'm not even a fan of meatballs!  I dropped half of them into a pot of minestrone soup I cooked and let them simmer in the broth for 15 minutes.  Delish!  I used the rest to make meatball subs for my son, a huge hit!

Did not have fresh parsley.  Used dried basil and dried oregano.  Did not sautee the onions, but put them in raw, and added the olive oil I would have sauteed them in.  Had extra ground beef, so my meatballs are more like 2/3 ground beef, 1/3 pork.  Baked at 350, not 450, for 10 minutes.  The meatballs are delicious!

I forgot to add parmesan and parsley. I am egg intolerant. I blitzed  the meat and other ingredients in a food processor. Would need a supersauce to make then all apart.

Added parmesan to my tomato sauce instead of to the balls, and chopped  parsley as a garnish. And I  fried the meatballs - just to brown outside - before putting in oven. 

A good tom sauce disguises many mistakes!  Taste of balls was good, and gets better the longer you cook. suggest 2 - 3 hours instead. 

I made another mistake,  accidentally bought low fat ground pork.  The taste of the fat is the main reason for adding pork imo, the meat itself is quite bland. 

Bottom line, can make plenty of mistakes or altterations to this recipe and still it tastes good.

I used a combination of ground turkey breast, lean burger and a smaller amount Italian sausage. All other ingredients stayed as stated in the recipe.  Everyone loved them when served with my veggie spaghetti sauce.  I simmered the meatballs and sauce for a couple of hours.

After reading some of the reviews I made some changes based on what I read and these meatballs came out great!! 

The breadcrumbs I used were Italian style and I also used 1 1/2 the recommended amount just to suck up some of the milk.  I substituted garlic cloves with garlic powder because it's what I had on hand.   When cooking in the oven I put the meatballs in a roaster pan so that the grease could drip down and the meatballs wouldn't be sitting in the grease.  They turned out great and I saved this recipe for my base.

I've tried several of Chef Johns recipes and have loved them all.  He's my go to guy for dinner.  I didn't learn to cook decent meals until I was 40!!  Thanks to allrecipes (especially videos) and peer reviews, now I'm good to go.  Didn't change a thing in the recipe.

This was cooked for my aging parents (fussy eaters), my husband (just glad I'm cooking eater), my college aged son (picky eater), his girlfriend (she eats everything) and myself (the critic) and everyone loved it!  Course, I normally just open a jar of Prego sauce and throw in frozen meatballs.  Either way, we loved it and I haven't made spaghetti any other way since!

The only change I made was using ground turkey instead of ground pork. It was delicious! I didn't have red pepper flakes so I used ground red pepper; but only 1/4 teaspoon, and it still has a bit of bite,  but my 3 year old grandson loves it!

Although I like food on the spicier side, I found the 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper to be too spicy for myself. I will make this again, but probably cut the pepper in half (at least).  Otherwise VERY good!!

These are restaurant quality and I am so glad that the recipe made additional meatballs that I froze for another spaghetti meal and subs. Next time I may substitute beef broth for milk as suggested.  Otherwise there is no need to alter this recipe.  It is bursting with flavor.

Was craving spaghetti & meatballs and I came across this recipe- was NOT disappointed!!! I tweaked it a bit to our personal preferences- used mild Italian sausage meat (removed from the casings of coarse) instead of the pork, ground lean sirloin for the beef (was actually cheaper), light cream replaced the milk and fresh basil instead of parsley. Basil needs to go in everything Italian made in my home! These meatballs were incredibly delicious and definitely satisfied my craving. Thanks for posting, will make again!!

Good meatballs.  I've been making them for years and this recipe is similar to what I normally make although I don't care for the taste of ground pork in my meatballs - it's just a personal preference.  I have used beef and turkey with good results.  I was intrigued with the onion saute and I added my garlic to it also.  These turned out good.  Will make again.  Chef John's recipes are usually spot on!

These were very good. I recommend following the directions exactly (yes, refrigerate the bread crumbs and milk for 20 min and the entire mixture for 1 hour). I used 80/20 ground beef and generic pork sausage. 

I read other reviews that say it comes out "swimming in liquid." Not in my experience. I would say they didn't refrigerate or used ground beef with a higher fat content. 

When I make this again, I will add more red pepper, maybe even cayenne pepper for added spice.

I've been using the same meatball recipe (Betty Crocker) for 40+ years but I had some leftover pasta sauce (enough for a meal) and went looking for a meatball recipe and found this one rather than the BC recipe. Glad I did. I cut back on the serving size and used 1 &1/2 lbs. meatloaf mix (1 lb. beef,  1/4 lb. pork, 1/4 lb veal.). Chef John, thanks.  This may be my go to meatball recipe from here on in. (Sorry Betty.)  Never tried baking meatballs before (always fried them); so,  I kept a eye on the internal temperature with an instant read thermometer. After about 20 minutes they were perfect: moist & tasty and not overdone. Still have six left over (It's just me and the wife) and I can hear them calling to me from the 'fridge.  Thanks again Chef John.

I just made this recipe using plain shredded wheat mini cereal pieces that I smashed up a little into very small pieces, in place of bread crumbs and I used dried parsley instead of fresh.  I also used beef broth instead of milk and these were delicious.  I just realized that I used ground pork sausage instead of ground pork.  These meatballs were fantastic but I would reduce the salt a little the next time if I used pork sausage again.

Delicious!! I made them with all ground beef because I didn't  have sausage on hand. Looking forward to adding sausage to the next batch! I'm also thinking about making the meatballs large for home made meatball subs!! Thanks  you for the recipe!!

Great Italian meatball recipe. A few changes that I made:  I used a blend of: 1lb ground meat, 1/2lb ground pork & 1/2lb ground veal. I also use stale Italian bread for my breadcrumbs. Buy a fresh loaf, cut it up, and then leave it on your counter overnight. Lastly, I brown my meatballs in a pot and then cook them in my sauce. A little olive oil in the pot. Once hot, add chopped onions. Sauté onions until translucent. Lower heat and Add 3 garlic cloves and sauté for a minute, making sure not to burn the garlic. Brown the meatballs in the pot, being sure to roll them around to consistently brown all sides without burning them. Once nicely browned, add your sauce to the pot but resist the temptation to stir for at least 20 minutes to ensure the meatballs don't breakup while being stirred. Add whatever ingredients to your sauce that you like (salt, pepper, sugar, oregano,etc...). Cook on low-med until sauce begins to lightly bubble. Then reduce heat to low and cook for 3 to 4 hours. I cover my pot so I don't reduce my sauce, but your sauce recipe may call for something different. Yummy Italian meatballs!

This was hands down the best meatball recipe I have found to date. I used dried bread crumbs, and used Almond milk and shredded Goat Gouda to make it dairy free. I will be making it again!

I have made these meatballs dozens of times for years now.  Since I found this recipe, I have never used another for meatballs. My 2 year old has a severe egg allergy and I didn't want to lose the recipe, so I tried it without the egg!  The meatballs had the same great taste, I used no substitution, and they still held together!

The meatballs are tasty and had a good texture but I wished I used 1 teaspoon of salt instead of two. Otherwise, it was perfect. Thanks Chef John.

I followed the recipe exact but left the onions out due to a very picky child. These are absolutely the best meatballs I ever had!! My picky child loved them and even asked me to pack them for his school lunch today.  And they're so easy to make.

These were awesome! I made them today after being really disappointed with meatballs from a highly-ranked local Italian restaurant last night. I want to take a batch of these to that restaurant and tell them this is what meatballs are supposed to taste like!

I used seasoned panko bread crumbs because it's what I had on hand and they came out great!  I read some other reviews saying they cooked up watery, so I mixed the eggs and milk together separately and added bread crumbs until they  soaked up most of the liquid.   Also, I  make my own ground beef, so for this recipe I used chuck roast and pork loin in equal proportions.  I like a finer texture so I always run the meat through the same die twice.  I mixed all ingredients, except the breadcrumbs, milk, and eggs, for the second pass meat grind so the onions, cheese, seasonings, and meats were all perfectly blended together in a nicer fine consistency.  From there I added the breadcrumb, egg, and milk and mixed them by hand.  After that a quick pan fry and into the oven.  These are hands-down the best meatballs I have ever made, not to mention the best I have ever tasted!

Nice recipe. I don't know why the negative reviews on this recipe I have been a chef instructor for over 15 years and I have made many a meataballs. This one has all the ingredients for true Italian history and flavor. Follow the recipe. It works well for my students.

Made no changes (except forgot to refrigerate before forming meatballs).  They were fabulous.   My son doesn't like onions but he is 33 years old so he can just get over it, but he didn't even notice because the onions were cooked before mixing into the meat.  We served with marinara sauce over spaghetti noodles and left the table happy and full.

The only changes I made was with the bread crumbs. I didn't have plain bread crumbs on hand, only the Italian which I used, but I omitted the Italian seasoning because it was already in my crumbs. I also cooked them in the convection oven which took less time.  
This Italian meatball recipe is our new favorite and it's a keeper.

Absolutely amazing meatballs!  As with all recipes I find, I end up using it as a base, and adjusting it to my likes.
I used a pound and a half of ground beef (1/2lb 80/20 & 1lb 92/8) and a pound of unseasoned fresh organic sausage.  I only used half of the onion.  After sauteing those, I used the same pan to lightly saute the garlic, which I then added to the meat mixture along with the remaining ingredients.  Since I used more meat, I had to adjust the spices.  I used 2 tspn Italian seasoning, half a tspn quality garlic powder, as well as additional salt/pepper.
 I pan fried these halfway, let them drain on paper towels for 5 min, then finished cooking them in the sauce.  Rave reviews from my guests throughout dinner.

This is my go to meatball recipe. Everything of Chef Johns is delightful. Sometimes I switch it up and use all turkey instead to make it a little healthier. This recipe is spot on.

My sister and I started making these meatballs a year ago.  We always made them the way our dad did.  We like these much better.  The texture is a much tenderer meatball.  I have also used this as a base for meatloaf.  Excellent.

Same proportion of meat, but had to use 85% lean hamburger and Mild Italian Sausage meat, squeezed for casing.  Had to use dry Italian crumbs, all I had.  No parsley, I had none.  
Everything else, I had, and in the correct portions.  
Followed exact instructions.  
Used an Ice Cream scoop, which I put in freezer ahead of time.  
The chilling, using cold water on hands, made  it.  I am eating these in about 20 minutes, have already snatched a couple, and they are GREAT.

Made this last night, scrumptious.  Cook felt just a bit long on the meatballs.  At 15 minutes on 425 in our Breville counter top convection, 2 oz meatballs were over 150 internal.  Perhaps shorten up the time, especially if you plan on finishing off in the sauce.

These meatballs are fab. They are super dense with a pop of color on the inside, unlike most meatballs which are craggy and grey when you split them. They hold up very well and taste fantastic. Won't make another meatball recipe again.

I give it a 5. Looked at recipe too quickly and did not notice the 2 eggs, but I had a 1/4 piece of 8 0z cream cheese and added to my sauteing onions and melted it up, that alone was fantastic, but added to pork/ground beef mixture with no eggs and followed the rest of the recipe, added more garlic, some raw onions too, & heavy handed with Italian seasoning and red pepper flakes, cooked on rack, very delicious.  Everyone wants this again, will try eggs next time.  Thank You for a great meal!(s)

Really good and a lot easier then pan frying first! I followed the recipe except for adding veal with the beef and pork. Delicious! Definitely will make again

O.M.G.! Best meatballs ever. I only used half an onion and didn't have plain bread crumbs,  only italian.  It was a huge hit with the entire family.

Had ground beef and store-made pork sausage (not Italian) on hand.  Added about 2 cups of chopped fresh spinach and increased Parmesan to 1/4 cup.  A real winner!

Very good  recipe and easy to adjust to suit your taste. Based on other reviews I doubled the garlic and halved the salt, also used Italian breadcrumbs and dried parsley since I didn't have fresh. Fried a little pattie to test seasonings and knew I was on the right track. I used a foil-lined sheet pan with a rack on top, sprayed to avoid sticking. Turned the broiler on to crisp the last 5 minutes, and they were perfect. I had no issues of liquid or tons of grease in the pan, and made  about 22 medium meatballs. Put a few on slider buns with homemade marinara and mozzarella, a few more minutes in the broiler and had a great dinner. 

Next time I would still use this recipe as the base but maybe even more garlic and will try the fresh parsley.

This recipe turned out so well! These held together really well in a sauce I made in the crock pot. I only made 3 changes from the original recipe. I didn't have plain bread crumbs so I used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs, I forgot the parsley and I used sweet Italian pork sausage instead of pork sausage because that's what I had. My flavor may have been slightly different from the original recipe but I don't think I've altered it that much. Also, because of one reviewer stating that her meatballs were swimming in liquid, I used 85/15 hamburger rather than the suggested 80/20 and I didn't skip the step of putting this in the refrigerator for 1 hour before forming the meatballs. The suggestion regarding parchment paper was a good one, too. That helped eliminate scrubbing.

Really easy and good recipe. Increased the pepper flake to 1 teaspoon and used italian bread crumbs. The meatballs turned out to be the best I've ever had, including the ones I had in restaurants.

Cut down on the salt; 1/2 teaspoon is enough.  Did not add red pepper flakes.  Next time I will cut down on the black pepper.

Chef John, I bow to your superiority in the kitchen.  When I see your name on a recipe, I know it will be a good one.  Your crab cake recipe is the best we have ever eaten anywhere, including Maryland.  But I digress.  These meatballs were outstanding.  Tender, moist, and just plain good.  The only thing I will change next time is use 1 tsp. of salt instead of 2, mainly because of dietary changes we are making.  Thank you, so much, for sharing.  You're the best!

Have made these several times, and they have come out great every time.  I now play around with the spice quantities a bit to vary them up and for personal taste.  Also, I turn up the oven to 450 for the last 5 minutes because I like the outside of my meatballs  well browned.  Great in a red sauce or for meatball sandwiches.  They also freeze very well.

Thanks Chef John.

The flavor of the meatballs was excellent. Followed the recipe pretty closely, only substituting gluten-free bread crumbs and omitting the parmesan for my wife. Will absolutely make these again. Thanks Chef John!

I followed the direction and ingredient list exactly as written. The consistency was perfect and the meatballs held up well simmering in the sauce for an hour.  I asked Hubby if I should save the recipe he said "Oh man, yes"

Pretty simple recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and for the pork I used a 1lb roll of Italian sausage.  I was amazed at how much easier it was to form the meatballs after letting it sit in the fridge for awhile.  Also, I have never soaked bread crumbs in milk before but it also made it easier to mix it into the meat mixture.  They are cooking now and when they are done I will put them in my sauce that is in the crock pot.  True test will be tonight when my teenagers eat dinner!  Smells delicious right now!

Been making meatballs for years- similar recipe to my own except for the olive oil. I believe that helped.. Also, used more breadcrumbs soaked in milk.. Only thing I did not follow was the parsley-I didn't have any.. That helps also..Very Good recipe.. Thanks

Best meatballs ever!  I've made them at least 10 times.  Bake them on a rack in a pan.

These were so good! The only things I changed were how I mixed everything and I left the onions raw. After soaking the breadcrumbs in milk, I mixed all of the ingredients except for the meat together, then I mixed in about half of the meat and mixed it together really well. Then I gently folded in the remaining meat, breaking it up into small pieces first. This makes sure all of the seasoning is evenly distributed without over mixing and ending up with a sausage consistency. Also, when baking them do not over crowd the pan and bake too many at a time. This will prevent the pan from becoming too watery at the bottom. Leave about an inch or two between each meatball.

I used ground chicken and ground mild Italian Sausage.  Made for Sunday supper and there wasn't one meatball left.  Followed recipe as written; baked @ 400 in my downstairs oven for approx. 30 - 45 minutes.  I did add sauté onions, garlic, eggs,  etc. to the bowl with the bread crumbs and milk (after sitting for 20 minutes); then added everything at once to the meat.  Also added a few extra breadcrumbs after mixing everything as it was a bit too moist.

These were very tasty and easy to make.  I have tried several of Chef John's recipes and have enjoyed them, except, they always tend to be too salty for me.  It was also the case with the meatballs.  I think my rule of thumb going forward will be to cut the salt in half on any of his recipes I use.  The red pepper gives the meatballs a pretty good kick, so you might want to omit that for some people.

Update: 

I make these meatballs all the time. I use half beef and half pork. I use fresh rosemary from my garden instead of parsley.  I also use oats ground up in a blender instead of breadcrumbs. I only use rosemary because I have it growing in my garden for free and I have so much of it! But the flavours are great. I have been known to use 3/4 the amount of salt instead of the full amount. I also grate the onion and add it raw, then fry the balls in a frypan before adding them to the sauce.

This was amazing! I live in Australia, and wanted to do something with the beef mince (ground beef) I had defrosted. I had no idea when I pulled the meat out of the fridge that morning what to do with it. So later in the afternoon, I pop onto allrecipes.com and come across Chef John's Italian Meatball recipe.

Now I only had beef, but I followed the directions, but I made rissoles instead. There were some herbs I didn't have, but I substituted fresh rosemary and some dried marjoram and dried sage. I took out a small amount of beef for me (as I can't eat wheat) and did the breadcrumbs and milk for the rest of the meat mix. At the last second, I figured I could use up the camembert cheese I had in the fridge so I chopped it up into cubes and pressed it into the centre of each rissole and then covered it up with meat. 

But no one else noticed the crumbs and my rissole tasted excellent without the crumbs. I think I could omit the breadcrumbs and milk in future, because they were really de

YUMMY!! I don't even like meatballs but these right here my whole family was pleased. I used Hawaiian sweet rolls for bread crumbs and added 1/2 cup golden mushroom to milk and breadcrumb mixture. I didn't have any fresh garlic so I substituted with garlic powder, and minced garlic and pepper seasoning. After baking I let them slow cook for about 10-15 minutes in Francesco Rinaldo Tomato  & Basil pasta sauce. I will never make meatballs another way!!

I made this almost to a "t" and it was OMG so good! I didn't have fresh parsley so I just subbed dried. What a difference adding ground pork to meatballs can make, wow! Very soft, juicy meatballs with a hint of parmesan goodness. When I put mine in the oven, I placed them on a cookie rack so the fat would drip off and the meatballs wouldn't sit in a pool of the drippings. This worked great. I also turned on my broiler for about 4 minutes at the end to give the meatballs a bit of brown crusting. I couldn't stop popping them in my mouth as soon as they came out of the oven! This is my new meatball recipe!

I made these exactly as written and they turned out fantastic.  Easy and quick.  I used lean ground beef and pork and there was no grease in the pan.  I highly recommend greasing the foil as suggested, it was the only thing I didn't do and they stuck.

Really good!  I used 3/4 lb. hot Italian sausage instead of a lb. of regular ground sausage, really gave them a little kick!  Otherwise I followed recipe closely and they were awesome!  Kids loved them.  Not too spicy.  The grease did make a mess of my oven though.  I ended up turning down the heat and cooking for longer.  I drained them on a paper towel and they were fine.  Make sure you let the bread crumbs sit in milk and also refrigerate for an hour as recipe says or I could see them being too moist.  Mine were not.

Followed the recipe until I cooked the meatballs.   Hand   Rolled them out into 2 inch balls and dropped them into the simmering speghetti sauce for about 45 minutes.  Yum!

The recipe for these meatballs is the best. I think it's a personal preference as far as if you like them soft or browned. I personally like a nice crust on my meatballs which is achieved by broiling. I broiled them and then rolled them over and broiled a bit more. I used a baking rack over a sheet pan. I finish the cooking process in my sauce. Delicious!

I love this recipe, I saw how someone said it was swimming in liquid when you take them out of the oven;  Yes, that is true but you take them out of the oven then you cook them in a large pan with your favorite sauce.
Let it simmer for about an hour.  They come out moist and delicious.

Super greasy, but otherwise OK. I didn't add and spices other than salt and pepper. You should eat them right away    or put the meatballs in sauce because they get cold REALLY quickly.

Love this recipe.  Meatballs are moist and delicious.  I have made several times...most recently I used sweet italian ground sausage instead of the ground pork and just omitted the  added italian spices. delicious!

These were great!  First time I ever made homemade meatballs, and I looked for the best recipe based on reviews.  Used ground beef and hot Italian sausage.  Didn't change anything else, except that I had to use dried parsley instead of fresh.  They were awesome!  A little spicy, due to the hot sausage, but that was only a bonus for us.  Yum!  A definite keeper!

This is a good meatball recipe but it is not a stand-out, in my opinion. I don't find it much different than the ones in the frozen section of the grocery. Don't get me wrong, it was good. Just not great.

Loved it even with all of the adjustments that I made since I didn't have all of the ingredients. I used cilantro instead of parley, dried oregano instead of Italian seasoning and 1 pound of ground chicken instead of the ground beef/pork. Will make this again!

Made as written with the exception of using all grass fed ground beef.  As others stated--they were quite greasy.  But I had no problem with them not browning or crisping--if anything I should have turned them halfway through--the bottoms ended up a little crunchy.  Pretty tasty.  I usually make turkey meatballs with coconut flour as a binder--but I will prob put this in the rotation now too.

First time baking meatballs, and with the parchment paper as was suggested, was a snap to clean up. Used two sweet Italian sausages instead of pork, and they were loved by all.  Thanks Chef John!

Great recipe! Super simple, and so flavorful.  The only changes I made was I used Panko Italian seasoned bread crumbs. I also used an extra tablespoon of Italian seasoning and an extra clove of garlic. I even added a little cheese in the middle. Came out soooooo moist and tender. Will definitely be making this again.

Just Made these and they are great!  The mixture was very WET so I was a little concerned but they are firm but very tender.  They were a little salty for me but that could be because I used seasoned bread crumbs instead of plain and I added a little bit more parm cheese so next time I'll just cut down on the salt.  This recipe is a keeper!

This was a last minute dinner idea so I didn't have any pork so I halved the recipe and just used beef, but otherwise I followed the directions.  I was worried that they might not stay round when I baked  them but they were perfect! I will definitely make them again.

I made it exactly like the recipe called for with one exception, for the ground pork I substitute ground hot italian sausage. 
I adored it. My wife thought it was a little spicy, but it was just perfect for me.

Made these for dinner tonight, using all 85/15 ground beef, and I used my small ice cream scoop (1.5T.) to form the meatballs. I didn't have time to let them sit in the fridge for a whole hour. They were swimming in grease when I took them out, so I had to drain them on paper towels and scrape off the weird brown/gray stuff that seeps out of ground beef. I let them simmer in spaghetti sauce for about thirty minutes.The flavor was delicious, though, and I will absolutely make them again.

WOW! Made these the night before my daughter birthday party, My family loved them so much I had to go to the store and make another batch because they ate them all!!! I did soak the breadcrumbs in milk for 20 minutes before mixing everything together.  I baked some and fried some both were gobbled up!!!

Yum!!  These were delicious!  Followed the ingredients exactly, except I didn't have any red pepper flakes, so I left them out.  I sautéed the meatballs in a sauce pan before putting them in the oven and then let them cook on a low heat in my marinara sauce for a couple hours, so they were nice and tender.  Definitely will make again!!

I made these meatballs as the recipe suggested. I froze some for later made some with my pressure cooker with red sauce for meat ball sandwitch. The meatballs were great cooked in the oven and in the pressure cooker.

I had a pound of ground beef that needed used up - but no pork. So I halved this recipe and only used beef.
This was a nice addition to our pasta night. No leftovers. :)

This is one of the few recipes I did not change a thing.  It's perfect as is.  Great texture, great flavor.  I make these in large batches and freeze for later.  To reheat, I just pop them back in the oven for another 15 minutes at the same temp.  Or microwave for about two minutes, rotating every 30 seconds.

Made this for dinner tonight. My first time "Meatballs" prepared  "Exactly" as Chef John's recipe called for, without reservation can say another of Chef John's success stories, as stated by Chef John, golf ball size meatballs comes out to exactly 30, definitely a keeper and will make this again. The family and a couple of friends loved it!!!!  - Oh yea, one of my friends asked how did I learn to cook like this, so I embellished a bit and said, a friend of mine (Chef John) sent me the recipe and I follow instructions real well - Thank you Chef and Thank you AllRecipes.com for your continued / daily recipes -

I always followed my moms recipe and wanted to try something different these were perfect however my kids didn't care for the ground pork they said the texture was off they thought it was turkey meatballs so next time for them I will just use ground beef but hands down delish was a hit with everyone else! Definitely will make again..

I made these meatballs for dinner last night and they were superb! I used two pounds of ground turkey and other than that, made no other substitutions. Mt family said they were they best meatballs they have ever had. I made spaghetti noodles and served sauce on the side. Along with a side salad, it was the perfect meat.NOTE: For the breadcrumbs, I used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs. It adds just a touch bit more flavor.

Great. I don't eat beef...so I made Torkballs. Turkey and Pork. 99% lean Turkey from TJ's and 72% lean ground Pork from xyz grocery store. They have an average of about 14% fat and taste great together. Sure, I used whatever combo of Ritz crackers and breadcrumbs I wanted as well as limiting salt and adding Cayenne Pepper which seems to be a smoother heat than adding extra RP flakes (which I added as per the recipe)...doesn't matter.

Meatball perfection! They are a little spicy but their texture is wonderful. I used only ground beef (that's all I had on hand.)  I did bake them a little longer, in my stoneware jelly roll pan. They are browned and came out looking like something from a restaurant kitchen. Thanks for another great recipe.

Really yummy. I had to make a few changes based on what I had on hand, but they were still super delicious. I didn't have time to cook the onion, so I just chopped it into really small pieces. I omitted the crushed red pepper to keep it from being too spicy for my toddler, and I used basil instead of parsley, and freshly grated pecorrino-Romano instead of shake cheese. To type it, it sounds like a lot of changes, but it really was just a few minor switches. Thanks for the great recipe!

I only had a pound of ground beef and no pork so I had to make some changes. I also read the top 6 or so reviews before making this and learned from many mistakes. I used about 1/3 the recommended milk after halving the recipe, and put the meatballs on a cooling rack on top of a baking sheet to cook. I also left out the part where you cool it in the fridge for an hour because I was too impatient. Cooked them for 20 minutes, then put them in marinara sauce and heated it on the range for about 12 minutes.  They were delicious!

LOVE these meatballs.
I've made them a handful of times and everyone always raves for them. I follow the recipe to a T, except Iuse fresh  chopped  Italian parsley instead of regular.
I also prepare them exactly as directed but once they are finished baking in the oven, I put them into a slow cooker with a large can of whole peeled tomatoes and some sliced red and green peppers for flavor and let it all cook together on low for a few hours to let the flavors meld, then we spoon the resulting sauce over the meatballs and cooked noodles.
What's not to love?

Good 'ol Chef John. Thank you so much for making a cook out of me. I usually buy my Italian Meatballs at Mariano's becuase they are pretty good. Unfortunatley, I forgot about them and then spoiled. Being at our place in WI, Mariano's is not around. Looked up Chef John for the rescue. Thanks to his wonderful recipe and Allrecipes allowing me to select the correct serving size, dinner was a hit! No more store bought Italian Meatballs for me.

YUM!!!! The best meatballs ever! Were a big hit! I made them a little bigger than golf ball size and cooked them a little longer (for 25 minutes). They netted 24 meatballs total. I doubled the red pepper flakes, and although they were spicy, I loved them! Thank you for sharing your recipe!

I followed this recipe exactly and they turned out perfect! In fact, I've been looking long & hard for the best meatball recipe and this is it. By far the best Italian meatballs I've ever made and I will be making these from now on!

Perfect.  I made it the first time with just beef and pork and it was awesome!  Today I decided to step it up by tripling the recipe and using 2 pounds each of beef, pork and veal.  The tripled recipe yielded about about 70 good sized meatballs and the flavor was amazing!  The first batch froze well and I don't see any reason these will not perform just as well.  I paired these with Chef John's Tomato Sauce for a wonderful Sunday dinner.

These are by far the BEST meatballs I have ever had, never mind made. The first time I made them, we ate  half of them right off the pan (we were "tasting" them). I have made them with olive oil and with canola oil. We liked the canola oil version more, but that is just personal taste. I'm actually making them again for dinner tonight ??

These meatballs were pronounced better than my old, true Sicilian recipe - and not fried!  Simmer in a jarred marinara instead of your grandma's recipe - if you're in a hurry;)

This is my husband's absolute favorite!  It's just the two us of so I make a batch then freeze 4-5 per bag. That way he's got a meatball sub any time he wants one!  I didn't change a thing in the recipe. It's perfect!! ?

I was craving meatball subs tried this recipe and oh my gosh excellent. Only changes I made I didn't have an onion nor cloves of garlic I substituted dry onion flakes and minced garlic. Still very flavorful, rave review from my husband. I made the full recipe and froze extra meatballs.

Hands down, the absolute best meatballs I've ever made!  Thank you so much :)  After baking I place them in a pan of leftover gravy on low for an hour, then served them over large wide egg noodles.   Can't wait to try them with spaghetti sauce !!

Fantastic.  I doubled the cheese, and made with 1 lb beef, 1/2 lb pork, 1/2 lb veal.  VERY GOOD.  Best meatballs I've ever made, and will use this recipe for now on.

Next time I will use a bit less red pepper flakes, but these were so yummy. They do hold up well. Cooked them in the sauce for about 20 min. They did hold up well.

I made these last night. Used 1 lb chicken Italian sausage and 1 pound ground round. Followed the recipe exactly except decreased the salt to a scant one teaspoon because of the salt in the sausage, and omitted the red pepper flakes. After cooking them in the oven I put them in my homemade sauce and cooked in the crockpot on low for a little over 3 hours. They were tender and flavorful, my picky husband even liked these! Some people had commented their meatballs turned out very hard, mine were anything but. I can only speculate that extremely lean ground meat was used or the bread crumbs were not left to absorb the milk for the full 20 minutes- a very important step. The consistency of the raw meat mixture is pretty wet and sticky, I used a large ice cream scoop to form the meatballs and got 24 out of the recipe. Cooking in the oven was great because they browned nicely and much of the fat cooked out. Excellent recipe!

Terrific. I usually don't make meatballs, because my husband constantly raves about his italian mothers, so I figured why bother. Well, now my granddaughter asked me to make meatballs, so I decided to give these a try. Let me just say my husband actually said "these are the best meatballs he ever ate" and the whole family loved them as well.

Thank You! This is a keeper. The only exception i made was to use all beef. As soon as they came out of the oven, I dipped one in the sauce simmering on the stove. They are delicious!

Foolproof recipe for genuine Italian meatballs.  I use either pure beef or a 50/50 beef/veal combination and vegan Parmesan because we are kosher and yet my Italian husband who grew up eating the real thing says they DO taste just like his mother’s.

I made these delicious meatballs as per recipe w/ a few modifications that were due to lack of ingredients. I used pork sausage (I use it in my spaghetti sauce too) and used garlic and Italian herbs to season it. I mixed it with ground beef. I didn't have bread crumbs so I used panko and let it soak in a little milk. Then, I added the onion and garlic and seasonings. I added the meat, egg and made the meatballs. The mixture held together beautifully. Once baked, these were the best meatballs I've had! Great recipe! Maybe next time, I'll have all the ingredients on hand :) I'll definitely make these again!

This is probably the best meatball recipe. It has such great flavor. Not sure if it is because you add pork instead of all beef but it is definitely a keeper.

Love this recipe.  Great flavor.  They seemed very wet when I rolled them up but they were just right. Clean up was easy... great idea to bake on a cookie sheet on foil... no dirty pan.  Thank you Chef John

Awesome meatballs! My husband is Italian and he even approves! I've only made these once and I just added more breadcrumbs and did half the amount or red pepper flakes and they were so delicious!

These were amazing. I used ground round and dark turkey meat and I baked them 15 min. and turned the pan and baked 15 more min. They turned out great! I would chop my onions smaller.

These are AWESOME.  I've tried different meatball recipes and this is my favorite.  I had a few alterations; used 90% lean ground turkey instead of pork; a few tbsp dried parsley instead of fresh; also added an extra garlic clove to the mix as well as sauteing a minced garlic clove and a quarter of a green pepper with  the onion.  I also doubled up on the italian seasoning.  I prefer the smaller bite-size meatballs so I got 36.  Baking them was super easy; yes there was some liquid but that was easily disposed of after baking.  After baking I  let them simmer in three cheese spaghetti sauce and served them with spaghetti.  My son loves these and had second's-so did I.

This was the first time that I have ever been able to successfully make meatballs.  These were awesome!!  I followed the recipe exactly and they held together well and tasted fantastic.  My 8 year old son and husband gobbled them up.  Will definitely make these again.

I got tired of buying meatballs for my wife from the local Italian restaurant's farmers' market booth, so I decided to try these. Can't disagree with any of the rave reviews. This recipe seems to have engendered fewer modifications (other than the meat mix) than most on this site, so I figured it must be great as written. It is. I combined half the meatballs with my own homemade tomato sauce (from my sister's garden), and the other half will get frozen plain. I expect to be back to this recipe for another batch before the winter is over!

Best meatballs I have ever made.  Used beef broth in place of milk, but other than that followed recipe exactly.  Next time I will use less red pepper cause my kids are picky about anything spicy and more salt.  I don't like things very salty so my husband was shocked when I said they needed more salt.

This is THE best meatball ever! I followed the recipe exactly (half batch for the two of us), and it came out perfect. I didn't have an issue with the mix being too wet. I wonder if some didn't soak the breadcrumbs in the milk first, or long enough...doing this almost forms a paste so the milk doesn't make the mix sloppy. Half a batch made 17 meatballs, which worked out great for a two night meal. Thanks so much for this awesome recipe!

It was awesome!! I used what I had. Didn't have beef or pork, used ground turkey. Didn't have Italian seasoning so I used oregano and thyme, running out of seasonings or I would have added some rosemary too. I like my meatballs spicy so I used 1 full tsp of red pepper flakes I used Parmesan and Romano, used Italian seasoned panko bread crumbs, didn't chill and used my small cookie scooper. Didn't cook down the onions used sweet onions and left them in chunks. Sprinkled a little bit of kosher salt over the top and baked them. At the end I broiled meatballs for an extra minute or two and it was awesome.  I added them into my bolognese and it held up without issue.  My partner loved them said thought they had tons of flavor and were super moist. Thank you for a great recipe!

Made this recipe the best meatballs ever. Pretty much went by the recipe except added some meatballs to the sauce thanks Chef John. Had friends over and they loved it. By the way spray your hands with olive oil before mixing everything   Try some chopped spinach in the mixture for extra flavor

Truly one of the easiest meatball recipes.  I like to bake them in either large or small cupcake tins - they crisp up great and they freeze really well.

The meatballs were very good. The next time I make these I will reduce the salt by half and add 1/2 tsp. more red pepper flakes and 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper.

I made this recipe last night and I have no complaints. I used dry parsley flakes, I did not have fresh. I used 93% lean ground beef and 85% lean ground pork. I followed the recipe exactly. Lip smacking delicious! I will definitely use this recipe again

I just made these today for my 3 year old's bday (spaghetti is her favorite). They turned out very nice, made my house smell lovely, and tasted great. I used a beef/pork/veal combo and dry herbs bc I was out of fresh. I halved it and was generous with my italian seasonings- can't wait for dinner! Thanks Chef John :)

Enjoyed the flavour and the moistness.  I used only lean beef and was pleased with the final result. This recipe was easy to prepare and I'm sure it will be my go to meatball recipe.  Once again Chef John provides a winner!

Very easy!  Made them as the recipe was written except I didn't have regular bread crumbs... Only Italian breadcrumbs. Was very tasty. Served with spaghetti. Family loved it. Will keep this in my recipe box.

We just loved these meatballs.  My husband has Celiac disease so I had to slightly alter this recipe to make it gluten free.  I toasted a thick slice of homemade gluten free bread and then pulsed it up in the food processor, and used the crumbs in place of the regular breads crumbs.  The only other alterations I made was that I used dried parsley (it's all I had) and I used .5t of oregano, .5t of rosemary, and .5t of thyme (because I didn't have Italian seasoning). I will be making this again for sure!  Btw.....this recipe made 35 small meatballs.  I baked the for 15 min and then popped them under the broiler for a minute or two just to amp up the brown.

I made these for last Friday for dinner they were marvelous. I poured meat sauce and marinara sauce over the baked meatballs and served with spaghetti noodles very filling.

This is hands down the best recipe for meatballs. I did only use ground beef however, and it still was amazing. I made the meatballs for a crowd and every last one was eaten! This is my only meatball recipe now. I also cooked them for about an hour more in my spaghetti sauce and they did not fall apart.

So I'm making this recipe, with a Vegetarian Husband, and 2 teenagers. Both our kids are not particularly fond of Meatballs.....This is a 'side' with our Spinach/mushroom Lasagna.  So, I only did 1 lb total meat (grass fed beef), I cut in half the other ingredients.  I did without the onions (didn't have any, and we're not big onion people).  Substituted Dried Parsley.  Had never baked Meatballs, and I have to say, I'm a fan!  easy, less mess.  I really liked the taste of these meatballs.  I'm keeping this one, and will make again.  Our daughter thought they were spicy, but I disagree.  This is a keeper either way!

I do not review very many recipes, but I have come to really trust Chef John. No more frozen meatballs for me!  These were really easy to make, and really good. My kids ate them up!  I followed the recipe exactly, but did place them on paper towels after cooking to let a little bit of the fat drain off.  I used a meatloaf mix from the grocery store, that had ground beef pork and sausage. Made it really easy to do.  Don't be intimidated to try your hand at homemade meatballs with this recipe. I'm glad that I did it

Really tender and a great consistancy. Very greasy though after cooking. Was a tad dull but I'll just add more seasoning next time. Thanks

Very tasty! I halved the recipe, added a bit more garlic since we love it, a bit more on the spices and it turned out great! I like to make meatballs in my cupcake pan to help contain any runoff and help them keep shape.  Cooked about 30 min this way, simmered with sauce 15 min.

These were delicious.  We had been to Chicago and I had authentic italian spaghetti and meatballs and they were so good that I was looking for a recipe to replicate this.  This was really close and everyone loved them!  This will be my way to cook spaghetti and meatballs from now on.

I used Italian breadcrumbs instead of plain and I pan seared the meatballs to make them a little crispy on the top and bottom. Great recipe!!

Excellent. Moist, and tasty! The only thing I did different is After they where in the oven for about 15 min. I put them into my sauce and finished cooking them on the stove top in the sauce.

Love these meatballs but I usually fry them before adding to my sauce.  Ground pork harder to find so I often make with just beef and they are still very good.  Have a slightly spicy flavor.

These were awesome! Forgot to add the milk, and didn't think they were dry. Did pan fry them, which reduces the fat slightly. Baked them with gnocchi covered with 1 jar sauce, 1 C mozz cheese, parm, and sliced fontina, about 3 oz. Baked at 350 degrees x 30 min. Great!!

Absolutely loved these meatballs! Have made them twice so far, and they will be my only meatball recipe from now on. They hold together beautifully (even when defrosted in the micro and simmered in sauce after) and are moist and flavorful. I didn't have ground pork so it was ground beef only. Also didn't have fresh parsley so used dried, and omitted the red pepper flakes, so slightly changed but still keeping within the spirit of the recipe.

Best meatball recipe EVER! I cook them up and then add to a light meat sauce using my family's preferred bottled spaghetti sauce. This one is a keeper.

Can't say enough about how delicious these are.  I increased the meat to 3 pounds and adjusted accordingly, thinking the original recipe would not feed my family of 6.  Needless to say, we have leftovers (and the family is grateful!).

I cannot believe how simple this was. I omitted the onion because I was making these for picky kids and they were still delicious! I also skipped the one hour in the fridge.  YUMMY!  Freezing extras for later.

I made these meatballs for dinner tonight and they were delicious! The only change I made was to use just lean ground beef. They were easy to make, my grandson had fun helping me. They were moist and did not fall apart. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Excellent!  To be totally honest, though, I've never made homemade meatballs...eek! I buy the store-bought frozen kind (and I'm now hiding my head in shame...)

Anyway, we really liked these. They were very simple--you must do a little bit of planning, obviously, as you can't just throw these into a dinner you've started at 5:00!  But in spite of that, still very very simple.  

The meats I had on hand were 1.25 lbs. ground turkey, 1.25 lbs. ground beef, and 1 lb. ground venison; in total, 3.5 lbs. of meat.  I used these three meats in total and adjusted the rest of the ingredients accordingly.  Definitely held up really well!  

I'm proud to report I won't be buying those "artificial ingredient bombs" from the freezer section again!

I've been making my own meatballs for years but this past year I tried Meatball Nirvana which we decided was THE recipe.  Out of curiosity I was browsing through the recipes and on a whim decided to try this recipe.  I am happy I did!  Not only were they delicious, they held together completely after baking and cooking in sauce!  I made what I consider minor changes only because they were what I had on hand; lean ground beef, and Perfect Pinch Sicilian Seasoning instead of Italian seasoning and red pepper flakes.  This has now become THE recipe!

This recipe is perfect just the way it is.  I had never made meatballs, I just usually did spaghetti sauce on my noodles.  So glad I tried this.  My husband loves to eat the meatballs all by themselves.

Loved this!!  Just added a little more bread crumbs and as another review said I finished them off in sauce after about 15 minutes in oven.

I made this recipe today. Firstly, no frying. And that is so important when putting together a meal -- one less, messy step to a perfect meal. The simple combination of ingredients, particularly the emphasis on fresh parsley, brought together a wonderful taste. While the meatballs are smallish, it helps them to not fall apart, but keep their shape very well when served. So overall, I would rate this a perfect meatball preparation -- whether a seasoned cook or a beginner. An excellent recipe.

These are wonderful.  I used a pound of sweet sausage instead of the ground pork and it gave them a nice flavor. I also used a 1/2 cup of dry bread crumbs in addition to the 1/3 added to the milk.  I have made these twice now and our family loves them either over pasta or for meatball subs.    As to the reviewer who said there was a lot of liquid, she is right.  Just dump it into the sauce with the meatballs and it's great!

Finally a meatball I can enjoy.  Not tuff, no breadcrumb mushiness and the right amount of spiciness.  Not over mixing the ingredients worked very well.  I did use an ice cream scoop to form the meatballs.  Produced around 18.  I made Chef Johns spaghetti sauce and put it all together in a baking dish and baked 1 hour at 350 and topped with shredded cheese.  First thing a friend said to me was "man those meatballs were awesome"..

Fantastic Italian meatballs!!!  I doubled the dried herbs and cooked them about 5 min less than supposed to and finished them off by cooking in a big pot of my marinara sauce. So yummy!!!

These were good but not what I wanted for pasta and meatballs.  I like a more traditional meatball and I let the sauce make the flavor.  The red pepper flakes threw my taste buds off. I have to say that these are good on their own or in a sandwich.  They are alittle loose for my liking too, I like them more dense.

This recipe was easy and the meatballs were very flavorful. I bought very lean pork and beef. Baked them on parchment paper, and they came out perfect!  I also used an ice cream scoop, but was careful not to make them too big.

SO GOOD! I only had ground italian pork sausage so I used that with the ground beef. Next time I will add more spice or use a spicy sausage, but otherwise this was absolutely delicious. Will be making again and again! Might even make a batch to freeze for an easy weeknight meal.

Awesome meatball recipe.  This actually made 44 meatballs after I rolled them.  I just used 1/2 teason cayenne pepper instead of the red pepper flakes and it had the perfect amount of kick.  Great for freezing and will definitely be making again.

Most times I don't rate Chef John because all his recipes work and taste exceptional. I've learned so much from this man, he's improved many of my recipes with the chef  that I see on TV!! LOL These meatballs follow, as well. The only thing I do differently is add bison or some other big game meat in there. It always makes people go "Hmmm... what makes these meatballs so good?" I never give away that Chef John helped out and never tell about my other meats, either. Are you kidding me? No way! Then everyone will cook as good as me!

Very tender and yummy!  I like the method of making a paste with the breadcrumbs and milk.  I had not tried this before.  I did take the time to sauté the onions but next time I think I would skip this step and just mix in the raw onions.  After cooking in the oven and then simmering in sauce I doubt anyone would notice!

These are really good meatballs!  The red pepper flakes give them a nice kick.  I thought these would be hard to make, but it really isn't.  This is now my go-to meatball recipe.

Great! I made it gluten free by toasting gluten free bread and chopping it up in the food processor and using 1/3 cup of milk. I also used oregano, thyme, and basil instead of an Italian seasoning mix and cut the onion in half. Served with Rao's marinara. We loved these! Totally worth the time.

I forgot to soak the crumbs in milk and left out the hot pepper flakes and onion but the basic pork/beef and seasonings make a tasty meatball! I am sure they are better with fresh parsley but I often use dry herbs and it works ok too.
 I baked mine at 375 degrees for 25 minutes when done I poured a jar of spaghetti sauce over them.

Wow, these were really yummy! The flavors and texture was perfect. Since me nor my boyfriend like onions much and they were flaunting themselves all over the outside of these bad boys, I was kinda surprised we tore into them so much! I had to make a few adjustments out of necessity, only had beef, no pork, used dried parsley, and doubled the Italian seasoning as per another's suggestion. Fantastic!

I did do a few things slightly differently (omitted onion because I didn't have one, used onion powder, added some extra herbs to the meatballs), but even as is, this is a DYNAMITE recipe. I was really worried about it falling apart, and these meatballs held their shape perfectly. I made sure to get ground beef and ground pork straight from my supermarket's butcher instead of on the shelf to make sure I had decent quality. The mixture smelled wonderful before I made it, smelled wonderful in the oven, and tasted AMAZING. By far the best meatballs I have ever made. They did get a little greasy when baked, so I might put them on a rack next time, and they didn't brown, but that's fine. I put them in my sauce for the last 5 minutes of cooking (and to get them covered nicely with sauce), and they were just to die for. This recipe makes a very large amount of meatballs, so be cautious if you aren't cooking for a crowd.

These were delicious! The flavor was full and savory and had all the right seasoning levels to let you really enjoy the meatball itself. We made bigger meatballs which allowed us to cut them in half and have delicious meat ball subs.
This recipes is definitely a keeper and one we'll be sure to use often.

this recipe was good, the meatballs are tender and hearty.  I will be making these again with my own twist.  But I give them 4 out of 5 stars

A little bit salty, but I would DEFINITELY make these again.  Everyone in the family loved them, even my 16 month old daughter. We had spaghetti with meatballs and these were simple and perfect.  Next we're trying them in meatball subs...

I made this recipe, but skipped the hour in the refrigerator due to a time crunch. They were incredible! A little spicy alone, but with a sweet tomato & basil sauce (Newman's Own brand) the spiciness was evened out nicely. I'll definitely make these again.

After seeing that Chef John submitted this recipe, I knew it would be a winner! I've been searching for the "perfect" meatball recipe for a while now and I found it!!  I've made these twice so far and both times, delicious! I only cook for my fiance and I so I cut the recipe in 1/2 and just used ground beef (95% lean).  I also used whole wheat bread crumbs and organic fat free milk.  I didn't have fresh parsley on hand so just used dried.  I have basil growing in my garden so I threw in a handful of chopped basil and added a little extra red paper flakes because we like things spicy! Let them soak in marinara sauce for 10 min after they come out of the oven and YUM!

I have made this recipe numerous times. It has become a family favorite. A simple recipe that everyone loves. The only difference I do is use a dash of Cayenne pepper instead of pepper flakes.

These are the best meatballs ever!! I read one of the critical reviews where she said they turned into mush in the oven, and I think I know what she did wrong, because I almost did the same thing. I'll be she forgot to put the meat in the fridge for the hour or so...that step makes all the difference in the world. Great meatballs.......I have several dozen vacuum sealed in the freezer!

Everyone really liked them.  I'm just not sure I want to hassle with beef & pork.  Plus the pork is more expensive.  Maybe I'll try with just beef

Great recipe! Good consistency. Perfect amount of red pepper flakes. The only thing I would do next time is reduce the salt to 1 tsp... just personal preference.

THIS IS IT
The recipe I have been looking for.  Instead of shaping into balls, I used it as the meat layer in lasagna and it came out so delicious. The secret really is the breadcrumbs soaked in milk. When I mixed it in with the ground beef, I was worried the whole thing would be too gooey - but once I pan fried the mixture, it was fine.  Soooo delish!

These were very good, but I feel like they were lacking a little something...in fairness, I used Italian breadcrumbs instead of plain and neglected the Italian seasoning.  I also used meatloaf mix.  I will definitely make again with a little experimenting.

LOVE these!The one thing for this recipe (which is to die for) - definitely use the fresh parsley.  It sounds so minor, but it makes a huge difference in the aroma and flavor of the meatballs.  Also - the second time I made them I put them too close together on the pan and they didn't bake the whole way through, so cut one open before you turn off the oven.

Made these as is.  Quite tasty and its shape held well together.  Threw these in w/World's Best Lasagna sauce (in this site) and we had a delicious dinner of spaghetti & meatballs.  
Thanks Chef John for another winning recipe!

I always make meatballs in large quantities and freeze individually on a plate and put them in a baggie in the freezer.  I also have to make them dairy-free because of an allergy in my family.  These turned out very well in both categories - I used half beef broth and half soy milk for the liquid and no parmesan.  All I had was lean ground beef and it was fine.  I used more bread crumbs than recipe called for. Also no red pepper flakes because my husband doesn't like that flavor.  Was all just great.  This is a very good recipe which can be altered to suit individual tastes.

I've made this twice now and it's a big hit.  Kudos to Chef John for a meatball recipe that is great as is or adjustable according to your wants.  For me, I used only ground beef, half the salt (not because of flavor but because of health concerns in our family), and made my own italian season blend and also omitted the parsley.  The blend I used 3/4 teaspoon of oregano and 1/4 basil.  I also doubled the onion and garlic and sauteed them together.  I added 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder and 1/2 teaspoon of onion powder.  
You really can't go wrong...this is a great recipe the way it's written or if you want to play with it!

This is a great recipe.  First time I baked instead of fried them.  They came out browned, but still very juicy.  Close to my own, except I use fresh bread instead of breadcrumbs and I add Worcester Sauce and Tabasco.

These were good, but if I make again, I will use 1 1/2 pounds ground beef and only 1/2 pound sausage. Some people might like a little more bread crumb too.

Thiswas awesome!  Thanks so much Chef John, a big hit with my family.  The only thing I did different was in the cooking process.  After baking them through, I added them to my sauce for about 30 min. so they could moisten up even more and soak up the marinara flavor.  Yummo!

First time I ever made meatballs and we very happy the result. Thanks for the recipe and I thought the video was a big help for people like myself. We sure will be having this on a regular basis.

Awesome!  Made these yesterday and simmered them in Chef Johns basic tomato sauce and my husband said they were better than the ones at our favorite Italian place.  Made them exactly as written and they are so tender.  The sauce is killer also, I can't wait to see what it tastes like tonight.  I found the recipe on his website.  www.foodwishes.blogspot.com

I made these for dinner tonight following the recipe exactly.  They are great meatballs!  I will look forward to having meatball sandwiches tomorrow night using some of the leftovers.  The rest will go to my extended family, and will they ever love these!  Thanks once again, Chef!

I made the meatballs last night and served them with spaghetti & sauce tonight. My family LOVED these! It's the first time in a really long time that there has been absolutely NO leftovers :) I made a batch & 1/2 so I have plenty to use for meatball subs, or other meals in the future.

Well, I must say this is a top notch recipe, made these for the Super Bowl and my girlfriend really loved it.  We used almond milk and panko (lactose intolerant)instead of milk and regular breadcrumbs and it worked out just fine.

Easy and delicious. These are the family's favorite meatballs to date. Even the picky 4-yr old asked for seconds. I followed the recipe exactly minus cooking so many onions...just lazily through some dehydrated ones in the mix (sorry, Chef John!). Tasty enough to eat with mashed potatoes and gravy. We'll try it next time with marinara sauce and pasta.

I thought these were some pretty good meatballs. I so wish Chef John didn't use so much salt sometimes in his recipes though, although they didn't taste overly salty. I really liked the concept of cooking the onions first. I didn't end up with over-cooked meat hoping the onions would be done like most recipes. I also liked how fast they are to make in the high heat. I made 1/2 recipe. I didn't have pork and just used lean beef. I also didn't have fresh parsley and just used 1 Tblsp. of dry for half the recipe. Being as I liked most everything else about them, I may actually try them again exactly as is with the pork and fresh parsley and report back. Good recipe though, either way.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I even forgot to refrigerate the mixture prior to shaping the meatballs.  My spouse who is very judgmental and honest loved them.  Chef John's recipes are the best.

These are THE go-to recipe for meatballs. Served in a red sauce on linguine tonight; will serve again with toothpicks with beer, on fettucini alfredo, with spaghetti aioli, in red sauce in a sub bun... thanks John.

I tried this recipe tonight and it was delicious.  I cooked cheese ravioli and put the meatballs and spaghetti sauce on top.  Yummy!  The only thing I changed in the recipe is I used ITALIAN bread crumbs, otherwise followed the recipe to a T.

I made CJ meatballs for a family spaghetti dinner and everyone loved them my brother-in-law said they were the best meatballs he ever had (trust me this says a lot he is hard to impress)!   Followed the recipe to a T and they were perfect held really well in my Marinara sauce. I will be making these again today for Christmas Eve!

Fantastic recipe. Guests raved about these meatballs. We doubled the recipe for a larger group, mixed the meat together the night before and refrigerated it overnight. We followed the recipe very closely. We formed the meatballs the next morning and baked them hours before the guests arrived so that we could carefully assure that the internal temperature of the meatballs reached 165-170F, which is recommended for pork. We refrigerated them again until the guests came. The meatballs were very easy to reheat in the oven before serving and very forgiving. One batch got 30-40 minutes of extra reheating because we forgot about them and they were fine. We served them simply with a tomato sauce, not pasta, although they would be great with pasta too. Highly recommend.

No one else in my family eats spicy food so I had to leave out the red pepper flakes.  I made this with a tweaked version of the Seven Ingredient Tomato Sauce from this website.  I thought this recipe was delicious but my family said it was "good".  This recipe is rather involved for a "good" recipe.  Might make it again for a special occasion with company but I won't be pulling it out on a regular basis.

Very nice meat-a-ball!  Good texture, I was worried at first.  I wanted to add more bread crumbs.  I did all beef, cut the salt and black pepper in half, and used soy milk.  I don't have cow's milk on hand.  I used 1/2 cup fresh parsley.  I cooked them for 20 minutes in the oven then they simmered for two hours in my sauce.  Delicious!  Will be making again.  I am curious to know how they hold up in the freezer, as in the past all other meatballs I've made turn into sloppy joe...

I never attempted to make meatballs because my mother set the bar "way to high".  I've made Chef John's meatballs twice, and like all of his recipes so far, they were easy and delicious.  The first batch were devoured in two days!

I made these during "no carb" week (which lasted all of one day) and they were delicious!  I was tempted to pan fry first, but I didn't and they didn't need it either.  The flavor was very good.  I did use 93% lean beef and non-fat milk and they still turned out great!

My apartment smelled so good before the meatballs were even in the oven! This is the first time I have ever made meatballs, and with what I had, they were still very successful. I used ground beef only, dried parsley rather than fresh, and more shredded Parmesan than called for. I also did 1/4 the recipe (since I was cooking for 1) and came up with 9 meatballs from half a pound of beef. They hold well in the oven and sauce and then split tenderly with an hungry college student's incoming fork. In my own preference, next time I will add more garlic, Parmesan cheese, and bread crumbs. YUMMY!

Hmmm. I followed this recipe to a T but was not as enthusiastic as other reviewers. I'm definitely the odd woman out. Don't get me wrong, it's a good recipe, but lacked some flavor for my personal taste. I'd try again, but would use italian breadcrumbs for more flavor. Thanks Chef John :)

These meatballs are to die for!  As my family likes a little kick to their meals, I used spicy Italian sausage then rolled a chunk of fresh mozzarella cheese inside before baking.  We love them in the sauce or just by themselves.
