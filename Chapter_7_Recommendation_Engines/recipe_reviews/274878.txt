Have to say, one of the best chicken recipes!  I have made it with coconut aminos and GF soy sauce, and has been great both ways!  Made it exactly, but always have to add more garlic! Rave reviews from everyone and so simple!

Very nice. Had no lemon grass paste so used a chopped piece of lemon grass. Served with Eggplant with Garlic Sauce, a very nice match. (had a bumper crop of eggplant this yea!)
A keeper & do again.
