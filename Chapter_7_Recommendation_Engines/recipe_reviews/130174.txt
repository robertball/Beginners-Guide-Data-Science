This tried and true doctored up cake mix recipe is reliable and very good, which explains why it's been around for at least a couple of decades,  maybe longer! The proportions of ingredients are spot on  - some call for way too much oil or sour cream but this one is just right. To enhance the chocolate flavor I replaced the water with coffee and added a teaspoon of chocolate extract.  This is also a very versatile recipe - I've used different flavored cake mixes or puddings, replaced all or part of the water with  different liqueurs, added chocolate chips - the possibilities are endless. On this occasion I added mini chocolate chips and glazed it with "Pro Ganache," also from this site, which I thought was a better alternative than the Cool Whip ganache directed in the recipe and just as easy.  This is a great "go to" cake when you need one quickly!

Pretty good.  The cake was a little dry but very chocolately!  I served it with raspberries and little dollop of whipped cream.

This recipe rocks!!! When I made the cake, I substituted dried cranberries for the fresh raspberries, and instead of the Baker's chocolate, I used a bar of Hersey's Special Dark Chocolate. Both were great additions to the cake!

Maybe I did something wrong!  The cake was really heavy. The middle was like fudge. It came up and over the tube pan at first then fell. Help if you know what I did wrong.
