This is a nice tasting soup.  The texture was a bit off for me, but that's an issue I always have with potato soups, so I'm not blaming the recipe.  I had to make a few tweaks out of necessity (read:  lack of prior planning).  I forgot to pick up coriander, so I subbed 1/2 tsp of cumin in it's stead.  Our grocery store had no leeks, so I used some green onion and upped the garlic.   I had white potatoes that needed used, so that's what I went with.  I thought I had a Colby mix, but only had sharp cheddar, so in it went, and I also used milk in place of the high fat (and more delicious, for sure) heavy whipping cream.  I also did add salt and about 1/2 tsp of white pepper.  This came together quickly and we liked it, especially with the chives on top.  THANKS for the recipe!

U used less garlic along with a mix of heavy and light cream. I had sharp cheddar and used that for the cheese.  The garnish was bacon bits. I finished the soup using an immersion blender. It came out great. A lovely golden hue and velvety texture. It is definitely a keeper recipe.

Minus the chives/leeks, this is my go-to vase for all cheesy soups. With the chives/leeks is also wonderful but without is a great start to all amazing broccoli cheese, cheeseburger and potato cheese soups!

Great soup that's hard to mess-up. We prefer to use other potatoes varieties though - gold and red have been great. Also, we like this soupy a bit chunkier so we don't work as hard on the potato mashing. Just enough to give the soup a creamier feel but leaving a lot of the potato chunks intact. Also, to make it truly vegetarian (my partner), we subbed out the chicken stock and bouillon for veggie. Works great.

The only change that I made was adding bacon as a garish....for flavor and a picture... however, this recipe alone is amazing. Even my veggie prejudice husband loved this soup!  Five stars!!!

In the words of my partner, this recipe knocked our old BHG recipe to the curb.  This is a new keeper.  I did reduce garlic to four cloves, I used an 1/8 of an onion but a full shallot in the saute'.   Red potatoes instead of Russets.  So a little different recipe but I'll write it up as a version II sometime later..

All I changed was substituting grated parmesan, romano and asiago instead of shredded cheese.   Wonderful recipe!

I can never follow a recipe completely.  I reduced the ingredients because I am only one person and this is a large volume recipe.  I also added just a bit of bacon for the extra flavoring.  If you have a favorite cheese, you can also change the cheese in the recipe.

In the end, this was truly a hearty, delicious soup.  I had to make some substitutions due to what I had on hand.  I used Parmesan/Romano cheese as well as added chopped Canadian bacon.  Along with russet potatoes, I threw in some baby red potatoes as well.  I will definitely make this again.  Delicious!
