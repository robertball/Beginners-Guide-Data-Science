Everyone loved them. I used cracker meal instead of flour or corn meal, an they were even lighter than expected!

I made this and it was very easy, so points for that. Everyone's taste is different, but for me it tastes under seasoned. I think either there needs to be more seasoning or a flavorful sauce paired with it. I would make this again, but with some tweaks. I would add some cyan, salt or seasoned salt, maybe a little garlic or lemon juice. With that said, the outside turned out nice and crispy creating a wonderful crunch, while the inside was moist and tender. Adding the salmon juice was a fantastic idea.

I've made this for my family a couple of times and they love it!
