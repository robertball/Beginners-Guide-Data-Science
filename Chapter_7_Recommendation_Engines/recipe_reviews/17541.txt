i have made this so many times that i felt compelled to leave a review.  while i thought it was okay the way it was written, i am sorry but i had to tweak it a bit. i usually double the green onions and garlic for an extra kick. instead of mayo i use a bar of softened cream cheese along with the sour cream (and since i double the other stuff, low fat sc/cc can be used and nobody will realize.)  with the cream cheese it gets a firmer consistency than the mayo which is what i like.  overall i am still happy for finding this recipe, so thank you!!

Big hit at my Superbowl party once everyone got over the fact that it was a green-colored dip!

SO GOOD! I slightly altered this recipe since here in Spain we haven't got sour cream so i substituted plain yogurt. Then to suit my own tastes I put half cup mayo and half cup cream cheese. If you use yogurt BEWARE! If you blend all the ingredients together you will get a soupy mess so the trick is to chop the onion and garlic very finely (pref. in a blender) and then stir that into the cream cheese and mayo mix. Last but not least fold in the yogurt. I also added a little garlic salt for some extra kick and the end result was DIVINE if you are an onion lover. My version is definitely not kid friendly.

Wow! This is addicting. Everyone who tried it loved it. Great with crackers chips and veggies. I would even try this as a spread for a sandwich. It's that good. And a great way to use items from my garden.

Great recipe! I used to buy McCormick's Spring Onion dip which our family loved. They discontinued it....been looking for a recipe for Green Onion Dip for a while and here it is! Too many French Onion dips which to me are too strong and beefy. Like the lighter taste of green onion and this recipe is in my box now! Thanks Penny!

Very tasty and easy dip. I followed the recipe except I only had cilantro instead of parsley and I just chopped and mixed the ingredients instead of processing them. The only problem is it was so good I ate too much of it and felt alttle guilty afterwards! I might try with lower fat sour cream/mayonaise next time just to keep the calories down.

I made this according to the recipe and it was really good. I will probably make it again with a couple of tweaks next time. One I used a large clove of garlic and my husband and I agreed that it was too much garlic so next time I'll use less. Also I agree with other reviewers re doubling the green onions; I'll do that next time. Last comment I really liked the consistency of the dip with the mayo/sour cream mixture as opposed to adding cream cheese. It was just right for not breaking chips!

This was very easy to make and. while it got rave reviews from party guests I thought it was just okay. However our guests just about licked the bowl clean so I guess it's just me.:-)

My very picky husband said this was the best dip he's ever tasted. I agree- and can't wait to make it for my next office party. We tried it with tortilla chips wheat crackers and french bread- all very good.

This sounded great because I love onions but it turned out pretty bland. It could be because I used fat free sour cream.

The base of this dip is really good. I made it the following way and liked it better. I don't measure things as a general rule so the amounts are approximate. 3/4 light sour cream 1/2 c mayo 1 c green onion 3 Tbsp hot Horseradish 1 Tbsp Garlic Salt 1/2 Tbsp Onion Powder 1/2 Tbsp Mustard Powder pinch of salt 1 Tbsp dried parsley I did not puree it all together but just mixed the ingredients up and cut the onion very thin. I served it with pretzels and cucumber slices then used it on leftover chuck roast the next day. Very tastey- VERY "oniony" (if that's a word) when made this way but that's how I like it!

I thought this was a yummy and easy dip- did leave the mustard out and used garlic powder. I try to avoid processed foods so this was perfect for a take along to a football party. Unfortunately my husband preferred the packet mix from the grocery store- oh well. I will absolutely make again.

Fantastic and really easy since I just put all of the ingredients in the food processor and blended it up! I made this a few days in advance and took it to my sisters Bridal Shower/Bachlorette Party. It was a huge hit with veggies crackers and pita chips! Will be making again!

This was a big hit with my Bible study group. It has a nice onion flavor while still light and "herby" very fresh-tasting. Also a very pleasant pale green color. I used 1-1/2 tsp dried parsley instead of the fresh as well as yellow mustard instead of dijon and it was still lovely.

I made this for a dinner party last night and it was a big hit! I did make alterations though. I also used a block of light cream cheese instead of the mayo (I HATE mayo). At first I found the mixture to be bland (even after it sat over night) so I wound up using 3/4 of a package of green onions an extra clove of garlic and an extra spoonful of dijon mustard. The resulting dip had a little kick at the end of every bite and was very delicious. Screw the dinner parties...I'm going to make this just to keep in my house!

I followed suggestions from other reviewers and doubled the garlic and green onions and also used sour cream instead of mayo and I did NOT like the dip even after it sat in the fridge overnight. The kick was too overpowering. I bought the Hidden Valley Ranch Garden Green Onion Dip instead to mix with sour cream.

This had a really good flavor but it was a little thin. I like my dip a little thicker. But I will try again and make some adjustments. Thanks

I have made this twice now. The only drawback is that it gets a little too thin being processed. It has gotten rave reviews though both times and I have gotten recipe requests.

I used light sr cream and light Miracle Whip instead of mayo. I loved the pale green color (reminded me of Green Goddess salad dressing) and it definitely has a kick from the garlic and onions (definitely need to let this sit overnight for the flavors to blend). I thought the Miracle Whip flavor made it taste a little off - I would try using mayo the next time. Putting it in the blender got all the lumps out but also made the consistency a little on the thin side. Anyways - everyone at the party still loved it served w/ fresh veggies.

This dip was so-so for me. I used a half block of cream cheese and a half cup of mayo right off the bat because I don't care for an overpowering mayo taste. Even with that change I thought the mayo took over the whole flavor so I added additional sour cream and onions. I also tweaked with a little ranch dressing and garlic salt. I will say that it was better after it sat overnight. I didn't hate it but most likely won't make again.

This dip is delicious and addictive! I would've followed the recipe as written but I didn't have all the ingredients so I used what I had. I didn't use parsley and I used dry mustard powder and garlic powder. I also doubled the amount of green onions and I used the white and green parts. I didn't use a food processor because you just don't need to

I used 1/2 C. Mayonaise 1/2 C. Miracle Whip and 1 C. Sour Cream. Doubled the minced garlic and added a couple tablespoons of pimentos. Left out the dijon mustard and parsley. I put closer to a cup of chopped green onion. I made this dip just for me because I love green onions however even my 1 and 4 year old would not stop eating it. Super easy and fresh!

It was a great recipe. Just added a 2 teaspoons of worcestershire sauce a little onion powder and some garlic powder to taste. This was eaten over the store brand. Make it 24 hours before a bbq.

This is pretty good. I used 5% fat cream cheese rather than mayo to cut calories and used dried parsley and dried chives. It was pretty bland until I added 1 tsp. salt. That brought out all the flavor.
