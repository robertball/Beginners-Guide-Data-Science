This was fantastic! The sauce only took 5 minutes to make and I actually marinated the chicken in it for about an hour in the fridge.  When cooking the chicken you basically cant leave it and I would suggest turning the heat down when you leave it to simmer. To make the rice a little tastier I added curry and pepper to it and then when it was cooked I threw in some peas, and scrambled egg- delicious!  Overall very tasty, juicy, easy to make, and it didn't make a lot of dishes so I will definitely do this one again!!

I think the poster of this recipe might need to review some of the details, especially on time. This turned out awful and burnt! I know the tendency is to blame the cook, but I use timers in all my cooking and did so for this one. Clearly, there is a problem somewhere after the first 8 minutes. The other side of my chicken was burnt well before 12 minutes after turning it. (And yes, I added water and poked the holes before) If the recipe is followed as it is written, it is not edible. I had to edit this a couple of times, because I was quite grouchy after attempting this recipe. All this recipe yielded was an irritated husband, an irritated wife, a messy kitchen and a hungry household. Save your time, frustration, and the mess!!

Family loved this. Just have to watch chicken & keep turning/stirring because it's a sugar base, so it'll burn quick if you leave it.

We love this recipe! Turns out great every time - - the last few times we made this one we used it as a wing recipe - bake the wings (on a pizza stone if you have it) in a preheated 375deg oven for 10min each side. Transfer the wings to the honey mixture and bake again in the oven. Depending on your oven, bake for another 10min each side. The wings come out crispy and delicious!

I really like the taste - very yummy!  Husband raved!  Did it exactly as shown.  I had no problem with any burning.

I used a baggie to coat the chicken instead of a bowl.

My only comment is that there is a lot of fat.  I think next time I will put the extra sauce in my measuring cup that skims the fat off.  I may remove the skin on the chicken too.

Just made this for me and the roomates, absolutely delish, had no problem with the burning, i did follow the advise of the previous review and made sure to not let it just 'sit', came out fine. i did find that the original honey mix was not as viscous as i normally like so i added 1-1.5 tablespoons of olive oil to it and the over all cook time was more like 25-30 minuets. Served with jasmine rice and steamed broccoli. Great recipe!

Love this ! Made it my own though ...didn't have dry mustard powder nor applesauce ...so used dijon mustard and added some cinnamon ..also added oregano , Italian seasoning and cayenne pepper  ...and mix teriyaki sauce with the soy sauce.  I'm 19 love to cook, my little brother loved it and he is picky.

I had a few issues with this one.  First, I would have preferred more of the sauce.  I barely had enough to coat the 4 leg quarters.  Next time I'll double that part of it.  The next issue was that mine also burnt.  However, my stove runs on the hot side.  So, I'll take the hit for that one.  I also found that it was on the greasy side.  So, I'll cut back on the butter and oil.  I will remake this recipe though.  Even "blackened" it was pretty tasty.

I didn't have any problems with the chicken burning like other reviewers...I cooked it on low heat.  I didn't like the addition of the water though...made it too watery.  Also, I think it could use more of the spices.  I really couldn't taste the curry or mustard, just honey.  I even substituted 1 of the teaspoons of mustard with hot mustard, hoping to give it a bit of heat.  If I ever make this again, I will add more spices and reduce the water.  However, the flavor was good.

I made double the sauce for this as others recommended, and I simmered the chicken *with* the sauce instead of the water as directed. I simmered over med-low heat for about 45 minutes (watching carefully) and this came out Fantastic! 
This sauce would make a great wing coating or marinade as well, and I'll certainly be using this again!

Between the honey (sugar) and the butter, of course it's going to burn. Gently sear the chicken in OIL,  turn it WAY down, and then simmer on low to caramelize.

Good flavor and interesting spices. You just have to use a different cooking tactic.

I started with the recipe nearly as is (only 1/2 the amount of honey as that's all I had) but changed it up a bit as I tasted it close to completion. I added more applesauce (in total probably nearly 1/2 cup) and some fresh garlic. I thickened the sauce at the end with cornstarch. The flavour was delicious. I served it with quinoa, broccoli and corn. My husband says it's definitely a "make-again" dish.

I made this recipe with legs only, it worked out pretty well and it was fairly quick to make. I let it set in marinade for about 45 minutes at room temperature. The chicken burned a bit when I put it in at first but I turned the heat down just a little and occasionally turned it. The marinade came through in the end, the honey glaze provided a nice caramelized texture and held the curry spice really well!

Turned out great! I used chicken drumsticks instead of chicken quarters. I also doubled the amount of water (though 1.5x would have also been ok). This reduced the possibility of burning & gave more sauce. Served with rice & mixed veggies. Served a family of 4-no leftovers, which I figure made it a hit:)

I enjoyed this recipe and will make it again. Instead, I saved 1/4 cup of the mixture for the drizzle before marinating the raw chicken in it then I marinated the chicken for an hour.
