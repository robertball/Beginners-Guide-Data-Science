These need a little tweaking in my opinion.  They were good, but a little bland.  I think I would maybe saute the onion and add a little ground mustard or some herbs to add a little flavor.

I checked 5 minutes EARLIER than recipe stated to, and they were browned (not burned) and a toothpick came out clean.  Did not like the flavor at all: they had a sweet,smokey,overcooked-egg,cornbread taste. My oven is "spot-on" temperature wise, I've checked, recently.  Odd... I love quiches, frittatas, etc. Sorry, maybe cook time is just off...but... I don't know if I want to bother trying again.

A good quick portable breakfast and a new way to use up leftover easter ham. I really enjoyed these, but they need a bit more seasoning. Some fresh herbs might do the trick.

Simple yet perfect for our busy mornings!  The only thing I'm going to play with is the "blandness".  It's not horrible but it does need something.  Next time I'm going to try garlic and a bit of ghost pepper.  But if you're looking for something quick in the morning, this is perfect!

Made this for my family today, skipped the bacon, used lunchmeat ham, coupled the muffins with a huge leafy salad: made a great lunch!  Thanks!

Excellent! I didn't have any bacon so I doubled the ham. Also left out the onions. Very moist and tasty!

Sorry, but the texture was odd and flavor very bland - almost like plain waffle dough. I followed recipe to the letter, and they were definitely cooked a good 5 min earlier than time stated.

Just made these. I used whole flour since I don't keep white flour on hand. Added 1 t of dry mustard & 1 t of parsley for added flavor. Made 12 jumbo muffins (I don't have regular size muffin pans). The muffins were dry. I think they need some fat in the batter... some butter or vegetable oil. I also wish I had taken them out 5 mins sooner like other reviewers mentioned. Will try again with more changes.
