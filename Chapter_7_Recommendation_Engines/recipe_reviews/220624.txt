Loved this! I had Gorgonzola so used that instead and I loved the veggies so much next time I'm using half of the pasta amount. This one goes in my "keeper" binder for sure:)

One of the best pasta salads I have had! I did make a few changes though I used only one carrot which I shredded and then chopped up and that seemed like plenty. For the feta I used a whole container of feta (one package) and that was the perfect amount. Very yummy!!

Intriguing Flavor has Short Shelf Life. It's pretty tasty in or out of fridge the first 4 hours but an overnight meld moves flavor towards bland. This isn't a salad to make very far ahead of time and it's not for me.
