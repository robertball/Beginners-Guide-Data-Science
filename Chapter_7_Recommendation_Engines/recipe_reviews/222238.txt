Our family LOVED this recipe!! We substituted curry powder (as suggested in the video) and it turned out great! We used fresh green onions from our garden, too! Daddy was the first to comment on how amazing it was and the children piped up right behind him. We enjoyed making it together, too. This was a relatively quick and easy recipe with leftover turkey! Another great recipe added to our family favorites! Thank you again Chef John and Foodwishes.com!

Very yummy! Used curry as suggested, didnt have tarragon, added fresh mushrooms. Only thing i didnt really like was the chip topping. Interesting, but not great. Plus, i then had chips in house i had to eat, lol.

My only deviation was using Monterey Jack cheese, as I'm not fond of Pepper Jack. For us, the garam masala and tarragon didn't work with this dish. It was OK but wouldn't make it again.

Not bad. My husband and I hosted Thanksgiving dinner this year. I made way too much food and now have TONS of leftovers sitting in the fridge. :) We are tiring of eating the "same old" turkey dinner, so I decided to give this a try. While my hubs and I both liked this, we didn't LOVE it. Ironically enough, this kinda reminds me of turkey tetrazzini (with a twist!). My hubs compared this to tuna noodle casserole (huh???).... To accommodate our small family, I halved this (the last thing I wanted were LEFTOVER leftovers!). Using my small 8 x 8 in. square baking dish worked perfectly. The only downside is that I now have a half can of soup I don't know what to do with. :( Other than adjusting the serving size, my only other change was to use all red bell pepper (personal preference). NOTE: Use garam masala if you can find it. Although curry is a suitable substitute, nothing compares to the wonderful, spicy aroma of this complex spice mixture. Ditto for the tarragon. Thanks for sharing your creative spin on boring (snore, snore) leftovers, John! :-)

I thought this was good because it has a different flavor profile than most poultry casseroles. I made it and then froze it for several weeks before reheating it, which worked fine. I just didn't add the chip topping until after it was mostly reheated.

I had some leftover turkey from one of Trader Joe's kosher half turkey breasts, and it was the perfect opportunity to try this recipe.  I halved the recipe and followed the ingredients except for the garam masala, which I couldn't find at the two stores I went to.  Instead I used a little curry and a little cinnamon.  It was also hard to find the egg noodles, but Sprouts did have them.  This was really good the first night that we ate this, but with the leftovers the next night we found it to be a little dry and with some of the flavor disappearing.  I was glad to have some of Chef John's Creme Fraiche (yum!) to dollop on top to take care of that!  This is a good staple casserole that I will make again.  Thanks, Chef!

I made this casserole for my husband, after the first bite I packed it up and took it to my daughter and family. We all loved it, the flavors were perfect (I never had used garam masala before.I will make this every year after Thanksgiving instead of the boring Turkey pot pie. Thank you so much for this delicious meal. Cheri

I really appreciated how creative this recipe was in contrast to other recipes (like pot pies!) that you can use for leftover turkey.  The curry sounded weird at first, but don't skip it...it's what makes this recipe really good.  Also be sure to use the pepper jack--it really compliments the curry and brings out some unique flavors.  I might add a bit more cheese next time, like some sharp cheddar as well.  Though I thought using potato chips as the crunchy topping was really neat, their texture didn't hold up well (too thin) with all the sauce, especially for next-day servings.  I think I would go back to using cheese toast or croutons next time or maybe even try something like Cheezits or Triscuits to get the cheesy/salty flavor.  I followed the amount of milk and condensed soup exactly and it made the perfect consistency of sauce--usually I find casserole recipes end up being too runny, but this one is spot on.  It was great because I always cook too much pasta when I'm making dinners and this was a great way to use up leftover pasta, too.  I used elbow macaroni and they held up really well, probably better than egg noodles would.  I'll definitely make this again.

Very good.  Interesting flavours and a very useful way to use up the last of the turkey.  Freezes well.

The first time I made this recipe I didn't have turkey in fridge. I had chicken breast instead. So, I cooked up the chicken. And Chef uses mushroom soup and my husband doesn't like mushrooms. Period. So, I used cream of chicken instead. And instead of crushed chip, I used Panko bread crumbs. IT WAS AWESOME!
The second time I made this, I used leftover turkey. IT WAS YUMMY!  BIG THUMBS UP CHEF!

Very good way to use leftover turkey I had in freezer. Did not have tarragon or garam masala (never heard of it ), so I just used a small amount of poultry seasoning. This made a huge amount, I made three 8 inch casseroles, froze two for future, and the other fed hubby and I for two nights. This was a very mellow dish, no strong flavors, at least the way I made it, with the missing ingredients. Will definitely make again.

It was edible but not something I would make again unless I was out of ideas.. I'm not a fan on the garam masala flavor yet I found this dish to be lacking on overall flavor even with that strong spice mix.  I used pepperjack and it was too spicy- I love pepperjack usually but this overdid it.  If I did it again, I would use a different cheese, more of it, add sour cream for more creaminess and perhaps some garlic.

This is super easy to make and super easy to customize.  I was trying to finish off leftover turkey so I used whatever ingredients on hand.  The only spices I used were salt, pepper and curry powder (next time I'm adding more curry poweder!).  I had shredded colbie jack cheese, so that's what I used.  And NO veggies (though this recipe could accomidate any number of veggies).  Came out very tasty!  My daughter loved it, I thought it needed a bit of spice...so added Chili Pepper Sauce (trader joes) to my serving and it was wonderful!  I would even add the chili sauce to the recipe next time so it cooked in...even jalepenos would be good! Oh, and the best alteration I did...was use crushed Cheeze-Its (mixed with some bread crumbs) on top instead of the potato chips.  Fantastic!

This recipe reminded me of an old tuna casserole recipe.  Didn't care for the Graham Marsala at all!  IF I ever make this again, I will use spices my family likes.

I rate this a 5-star recipe though I made a few changes which change most everything.  However, without the basics of this recipe I would never have turned out such a delicious casserole.  My changes were mild cheddar rather than pepper jack, because it is what I had, and Fox Point seasoning rather than garam masala, for the same reason.  The flavor was perfect but more than that the casserole had the perfect consistency and was neither too dry nor too wet. There are only two of us so this made enough to freeze for several more dinners, which makes it an instant hit in my kitchen!

This recipe sounded delicious.. and I thought I had all the ingredients.. but did not have any tarragon or garam masala... So I had to substitute too... 
I used some winter savory, some weber kicken chicken seasoning, a dash of turmeric. I sauteed the onion and chopped green onion in the butter added the seasoning to it.. and followed the rest of the recipe... IT is delicious.

This is a really good recipe. I made 2 changes. I used ground turkey because that's what I had, and I added a few handful of frozen petite peas for a pop of sweetness. I will be making this again many times.

This was really good. I did curry powder instead of garam masala as that's what I had. Then bread crumbs with parmesan for the top. Next time I think we'll do cheese-its for the top as the breadcrumbs were a bit boring. But excellent recipe. Would be good with leftover rotisserie chicken too.

I didn't have the gran masala spice - had never heard of it! So, I don't know how much of a difference it would have made. I added some dried ancho chile spice instead. Overall, not great. I liked the basic idea and would likely use Chef John's tuna noodle casserole recipe instead of this one and just add turkey instead of tuna fish.

I used a white sharp cheddar instead of pepper jack.  I'm not even sure what seasoning I used--just something up there in the spice cabinet--maybe pou;try seasoning (with sage). I used the garum masala, but couldn't taste it when it was cooked.   The dish has a nice, chewy consistency --folks feel like they are really eating something nourishing..

Subs cream of celery for mushroom (as always).

Subs Ghost pepper cheese for the pepperjack cheese and it was "noticable". Probably too much heat for the less adventurous.

It was really good! At first I was worried because the sauce seemed very thick, after it came out of the oven it was a little drier than I anticipated but it looks like all of the photos look exactly like mine. I had to half the recipe as there is only two in my household, And there is still plenty. I’m sure I will have to add milk upon the reheat but over all the dish was delicious. I topped it with a breadcrumb topping instead of the chips as the reviews for most people with plain chips did not considered it very good

We loved it!  I followed the recipe with the exception of adding about a cup of peas to the white sauce and substituting an Anaheim pepper for the green bell pepper.  For the topping I used crushed seasoned croutons and  a handful of French's crispy fried onions.  This recipe made enough for me to cook one 8 x 8 casserole and freeze one 8 x 8 for future use (with the toppings in a baggie laid on top of a piece of foil before covering the casserole with a larger piece of foil).  I love Chef John's recipes and this one is worth trying.  I'll definitely make it again!

I used cream of celery soup instead of cream of chicken.  I also made the Garamond masala from Michelle Mackey's recipe on your site.  I topped it with 1 sleeve of crushed ritz crackers (low salt) mixed with the remainder of the stick of butter.  It was delicious & I will definitely make it again.  Gave it 4 stars because of changes made, potato chips would get soggy for leftovers.  Makes a lot.

Excellent texture and very nice creaminess. Mine lacked flavor but I did use regular curry powder instead of the garam masala and smoked bacon cheddar for the cheese as my wife can't handle the heat. Even so, I would add more spices next time.

I really liked this recipe but changed it a little.  I didn't have pepper jack cheese so I substituted cheddar.  For the potato chips (which I didn't have either) I sprinkled the top with bread crumbs and grated romano cheese then sprayed it lightly with butter cooking spray.  I did add mushrooms and peas because we like them.  The one thing in the recipe that I didn't agree with was adding peppers and onion without sauteing first.  I have a similar recipe made with bulk sausage and macaroni and the directions say to saute the onion and peppers in butter and then sprinkle with the flour.  Once the flour is blended, add the milk, and in this case, mushroom soup.  I think the consistency of the vegetables is better that way.  My husband liked the recipe, too.  I'll make it again but with the pepper jack cheese.

Easy to make with following the video. I used different cheeses that I had on hand and Amish egg noodles.  Very tasty casserole.

Delicious!  I made several changes to include adding one can of sweet peas, used 2 cups of 30 calorie almond milk and the rest in water for the milk.  I didn't have cream of mushroom soup so I used 1/2 can cream of chicken and added a small jar of mushrooms.  Instead of egg noodles, I used macaroni.  I didn't have tarragon on hand and used basil instead.  I added dried onion and garlic powder.  I also chopped up sweet red and yellow mini peppers with seeds instead of bell peppers.  I didn't have pepper jack cheese and used sharp cheddar and diced pickled jalapeno peppers.  For the topping, I crushed up saltine crackers and sprinkled shredded cheese over the top.

8/2019 - made a half batch with turkey from the freezer, used bread crumbs instead of chips, otherwise followed recipe. 
 Seemed dry this time, had to toss out the leftovers. :(  1/7/17 - This was excellent!  Used up a bag of frozen turkey pieces leftover from Thanksgiving - awesome flavor and texture.  The only change I made was to sprinkle bread crumbs on top instead of chips and I had to sub mixed, shredded cheese (was out of pepper jack but think that would have made this better!).  Everyone loved it!

I love making a Chef John recipe as It usually calls for some ingredient I have never tried. In this case, the garam masala. I made the spice mixture from the recipe on this site. What an exceptional flavor this added to this easy casserole. Another husband approved , delicious meal. Thanks again Chef John.

GF version:  I was lazy this year and didn't make gravy so I used I used the turkey drippings in the pan with a GF flour and an already opened can of green enchilada sauce (does contain a bit of wheat) for the roux.  I thinned later with unsweetened soy milk.  Rice/quinoa noodles, fresh mushrooms, and a bag of frozen peppers, and the green onions.  Loved the gram masala with hint of chile  and sprinkled tortilla chips on top.  Used a combo of cheese on hand--pepperjack, cheddar, and mostly mozzarella.  I forgot to add the fresh cilantro on top.  We loved it.  Thank you Chef John for innovating turkey and noodles.

I made this recipe to use up our leftover Thanksgiving turkey. One of my son's loved it and the other tasted it and said that it wasn't his favorite thing. I'm a vegetarian and don't eat meat, but I had a bite of the noodles and the sauce and I liked it, but next time, I'd reduce or eliminate the tarragon  It was a predominate flavor that was too overpowering. Garam masala was OK, not great.  I didn't use the potato chips for the top, instead I used fresh sourdough breadcrumbs sautéed in butter. The bottom line is, this recipe could be made a lot better by experimenting with different seasonings.

Awesome, adjusted the seasoning to poultry seasoning, parsley, chives, Himalayan salt, fresh ground pepper. No green or red peppers, 1/4 fresh onion, fresh frozen broccoli, used extra sharp n.y. cheddar.. Yummm, finished the leftover turkey, baked in a 9x13 buttered glass pan 30mins...perfect!

Love it!  Really enjoyed the unique flavor.  We only made a few minor changes.  We used fettuccine instead of egg noodles because we have an egg allergy in our family.  We also used someone else's suggestion of adding fresh mushrooms -- great idea.  We also replaced half of the pepper jack with mozzarella to make sure it wouldn't be too spicy but next time we would try it with all pepper jack.

If I made this again, I wouldn't use pepperjack cheese, probably a white cheddar, and I would use more garam masala.  Definitely no chip topping.  Maybe fried onions?  Just blah.

What a fabulous way to deal with leftover turkey!
The  family (three adults) loved this. 
I made it exactly as per the recipe - and what really puts the marvelous flavours together are the garam masala, tarragon & pepper jack cheese. Wow!
This is Chef John genius.
Have saved the recipe and will definitely make it again.

This was just ok and rather disappointing.  I could hardly taste the garam masala or tarragon.  I would increase these spices next time or use curry as others have suggested.

I've loved every recipe from Chef John --except this one. The thyme was way too strong (and I put less than a teaspoon in), same for the garam masala. It also took me a lot longer to prepare than 15 minutes. In the end it tasted like a glorified tuna casserole (with turkey.) Not bad, but the prep and clean-up don't make it worth the effort.

A perfect way to use the leftover turkey when we couldn't take one more turkey sandwich. Very unique flavor combo. I didnt have store bought Garam masala on hand so I followed one of the recipes on here to mix my own.

This recipe sounds so good, but it was just OK... not the result I expected. Not likely to make this again.

Not a fan favorite...  Bummer.  Was looking for a way to use leftover turkey.  I do think it has potential, may need to experiment a bit more.

solid but not stellar...
probably would add a lot more spice but that's just my take on it.  Still willing to try it again tho.

I made this with a few changes. I don't really like bell pepper...so i substituted mushrooms,some corn and some carrots [I had left over from carrot cake] and for the cheese i used a mixture of cheddar and parmesan reggiano and used french fried onions on the top. Oh it was so good!!

A great recipe.  A good Turkey disguise.
