This soup is excellent!  I had some Gouda I needed to use and this popped up.  I used a package of "steam in the bag" broccoli florets, cooked according to package directions, and added it at the end.  I finished the soup and then it was about an hour or so before we ate.  Unfortunately, it had curdled somewhat by the time we ate which made for a funky texture.  Next time I will know to serve immediately.  I did use fresh grated nutmeg!

Very good soup!  Rich and yummy, certainly NOT bland!  I did use freshly grated nutmeg-it makes a big difference.  My only problem was I wish I had doubled the broccoli as I felt it needed more.

This was delicious! I added carrots. I used a fresh soft gouda. The soup was creamy and cheesy. Really yummy!

So to give this recipe a bit mor spunk and creaminess I used fat free half and half, I added Hormel real bacon bits (1/2 c to an 8 serving size) and white pepper.  Next time I'm topping w chopped scallions and serving with garlic bread sticks.

It was alright. I really like gouda so I thought I was going to be crazy about this recipe, but it tasted just kind of like... melted gouda. I followed the recipe to a T but it just wasn't for us. It was alright (as I said, I love gouda!) but it was just really melted gouda.

Yum!  Added a little more cheese (used the smoked gouda!) and more broccoli.  Also added cooked chicken sausage, as the soup was the main course.  Will definitely make again, and try with the nutmeg next time!

It is a bit bland. I had to season it quite a bit, but it ended up tasting good. I didn't use nutmeg, but used garlic powder, garlic salt, and seasoning salt to add flavor (in addition to salt and pepper). I also added spinach to mine. Served with some bread, and we're happy campers over here.

I found this soup to be quite bland.  I loved the idea of a gouda broccoli soup, but this one dissapointed me.  I think maybe with some other veggies (yams?) pureed into the broth would add a bit of richness which is lacking.  As much as I wanted to love it I will be going back to my regular broccoli soup recipe.

Very good recipe.  I didn't put in any nutmeg (I forgot!) and I probably used too much broth (I don't use canned broth).  I also didn't have enough milk so had to substitute about 1/4 of the milk for heavy cream.  I wasn't sure if Gouda would taste good in this, but I had some I had to use.  This recipe also didn't have reviews, so I couldn't see what others thought.  But I can say that if you like Gouda, and you don't mess something up, you will like this recipe.  It's fantastic! :)
