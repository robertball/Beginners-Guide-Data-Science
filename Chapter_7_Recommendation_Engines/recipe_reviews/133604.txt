This was a winner at our house. Everybody went back for seconds and from the first bite my husband asked if I made a lot of this. He was happy when I told him I doubled the recipe. 

I simplified the recipe by boiling the chicken in water with celery salt, garlic powder and pepper. Then I cut the chicken in bite size pieces and used the liquid for the broth.

I cooked 16 oz of sausage with the celery, green pepper and onion. After the sausage was done I just added all the ingredients in the skillet and cooked till the rice was done. 

Simple, easy and delicious. Thanks Jan for a easy great recipe.

This recipe was outstanding. I have never liked shrimp but this recipe makes it taste sooo good. Even my 4 year old twins liked it. My husband ate all the left overs the next day and said that I could make this recipe anytime. What a fabulous feast! I used hot italian sausage to add a little extra kick. yum.

This was delicious!  I cooked a couple of small chicken breasts in water with a bouillon cube to make the chicken broth, set the chicken aside to cool, (added the broth to the veggies and rice), then cooked the sausage in the chicken pan and set it aside to add at the end with the chicken and shrimp. Everyone enjoyed it and proclaimed it A Keeper.

I wasn't blown out of the water by this recipe, but it was pretty tasty and very quick since I had both chicken and sausage already cooked. My husband loved it, and said it was even better the second day. (He ate all of the leftovers, so I didn't get a chance to try it the day after!)

Wow! This recipe is a real find and it's easy to make and modify.  I didn't have shrimp or hot sauce, so I doubled the chicken and added cayenne pepper (we like stuff hot too).  I think a can of corn could be added at the end and it would also be good (not traditional jambalaya though).  I think I'll try that next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was wonderful. I only had chicken for the meat and did not have celery or green pepper but still turned out great. I will definitely make this again and try will the other meat/veg.

Wow! I followed another reviewers rec and used Chorizo, except it's so fattening so I used the soy version, that added this great spice so I didn't need to use hot sauce. I also added celery with the veggies and some thyme. Lastly, I used brown rice instead of white, I already had a bunch left over from another meal, but I would suggest not cooking the rice in the pot and cooking it separately because brown rice doesn't seem to cook as well in any kind of sauce.

Instead of using hot sauce, I use cayenne pepper.  I also add a couple of bay leaves for an intense flavor.  To add more heat, I used andouille sausage instead of the Italian sausage.  Mmmmmm!

Super yummy and easy!  It is now a staple in our house.  I have made different versions with smoked sausage,  red beans and green chiles.  Double the recipe so that you have plenty for seconds and leftovers.  It is a real crowdpleaser!

Great starter recipe.  I doubled it, left out the celery,omitted all the spices and added 4 tsp of creole seasoning and 1 bay leaf, 2 cups of rice....kept everything else the same. Tasted great, family loved it!  Served with french bread for dipping and ceasar salad.

I love this recipe, I make it about once a month. Most of the time just with some pre-cooked chicken instead of any shrimp or sausage however occasionally i will add in some Kielbasa or Andouille for a change! Easy and budget friendly weeknight meal and makes great leftovers for lunch the next day!

This was good but need a few things. Not spicy enough, at least not for our taste. More hot Sauce, and I think next time I'm going to add a jalapeno. I could my chicken in the chicken stock. Made the chicken very tender. Also, I made small meatballs with the italian sausage. Not to big so that everyone with get some, and this way you can taste the sausage. I also made shrimp stock and mixed it the chicken stock. Use the peals of the shrimp. Add water bring to a boil. Add green pepper tops, onion tops, and celery tops (you're going to throw them away anywas but have great flavor). I also add garlic cloves and salt when I cooked the oinons, green peppers and celery. You should always add a bit of salt when you sweat your veggies like that. Helps bring out the flavor. Not much to add saltiness, just add flavor, yes there is a difference. (learned that from my husband, who I disagreed with time and time again but understand the difference now)

This was delicious.  I took a short cut and used 1 can of Hunt's tomatoes w/ celery, green pepper and onion.   It was super easy, considering I used left-over smoked sausage and shrimp from a low-country boil.   I cooked it down for more than 20 minutes so it was not soupy.   Definitely a keeper.

My family loved this so much that my 13-year-old daughter requested it for her birthday dinner instead of going out to eat!  I doubled the hot sauce and used a pound of prawns.

My family loved this.  My husband doesn't like spicy food so we have stayed away from Cajun food (which is one of my faves).  This recipe is not too spicy, so that my husband and kids could enjoy it, and as for me... I just brought my favorite hot sauce to the table and spiced it up!!!

Great recipe!  I eliminate the sausage though just because I am not a big fan of sausage.  I also add creole seasoning instead of a bay leaf and it makes it pretty spicy but I really like it that way!

I made this today and followed the recipe exactly.  While it was ok it is does not really taste like Jambalaya.  Overall I was pretty disappointed.

Great Recipe. I wouldnt change anything but perhaps cook the rice first and then add it in. We will definately make this again.

This is a great recipe! Make it all year round and kids never get tired of it. Big hit at our Super Bowl party too. Everyone loves it and asks for the recipe.

This was great!  I doubled the shrimp because I didn't have any chicken, I quadruped the hot sauce and used Rotel canned tomatoes with green chilies. It was very spicy but we like spicy. Made a ton to freeze for later!

Would make again. I left out the chicken and just used shrimp and sausage. The rice got a little mushy because I waited too long before serving, but otherwise good.

Remember to keep the spices minimalized - the cajun seasoning has a lot of kick to it.

I always cheat and use instant rice that I add in at the end. I have never been albe to get long grain rice to cook, so I stick with instant rice. I used two cans of diced tomatoes, one hot. I used two links of andouille sausage. Delicious!!

Loved this recipe!! I'm vegetarian though, so I used a vegetarian bouillon cube instead of chicken broth, and left out the meat. I also had chipotle diced tomatoes, so I used that, and it was spicey! Good though!!!

This is a good base to work off of. I don't honestly know that much about traditional jambalaya but thought this was tasty! I cook the chicken in Cajun spices first, pre-cook the rice in the chicken broth according to the rice directions and add a bouillon cube, brown the kielbasa in the pan and melt the butter in the leftovers in the pan to pick up the flavor. (Note: I used turkey kielbasa so there isn't a ton of fat in the pan, if you use pork, I would suggest draining it.) I use Cajun seasonings, garlic (fresh and powder), onion powder, pepper, paprika, bay leaf and cayenne. Then I put it all together in the pan to warm and get the flavors throughout! It's a big hit in my house.

I made it as recipe states.  One of the best jambalaya I have ever had ( although I have yet to go to New Orleans).  Me family loved it and the bit I took for lunch was still very good w a wee bit of water added.

Most of the heat was from the Italian sausage I used. I will add a little more heat next time. It was the first time I've ever cooked raw shrimp and it was delicious! I've made it twice since.

This was such a hit with my family that I had to make it two nights in a row! The only changes I made was that I added a little salt and I used andouille sausage instead of Italian sausage. My S.O. got home late and ate dinner after I had gone to sleep. He woke me up just to tell me how great this jambalaya tasted. I’ll definitely add this to my collection of favorites!

Received rave reviews on this one.  The only thing that I did different, was used shrimp broth instead of chicken broth.  Whenever my husband & I get fresh shrimp in bulk, I boil the shrimp heads down with herbs, freeze the broth in ice cube trays and use in recipes like this.

This is a great base recipe to modify to your own spiciness. We used shrimp, crawfish, and sausage left over from a crawfish boil and it turned out great.

This was a very good recipe.  I was forced to make a few changes though.  I didn't add the red or green peppers because hubby has a gag reflex when you add them to anything. lol but true.  I followed it pretty close but added Rotel because we live in NM and we like our dishes hotter and spicier.

It was good and simple to make. I microwaved brown rice while sautéing the sausage and vegetables when the rice was done, added it and the spices to the sausage mix. Did not use chicken or shrimp this time as there are only two of us and my skillet is already full. When I am feeding a group I will definitely make the complete recipe.

This was amazing. I know everyone hates reviews with substitutions, but I did substitute the rice for two cups of penne rigate. (A local restaurant makes a pasta interpretation of jambalaya and I wanted to try my hand at it.) I followed the rest of the recipe exactly, including cooking the pasta in the liquid as though it were rice. Absolutely amazing!

Quick and easy. I made a little more than recipe and did not use chicken. I also made extra rice on the side. I told my husband he can adjust the heat level when he makes his plate by adding more hot sauce. I put extra hot sauce and cayenne and the heat was not as expected but I was afraid to offer do it in case the heat level increased as it sat. I also used italian sausage that I cooked up and then sliced into wheels (that's what I had available). Will make this again.

I make this without the celery or shrimp, because we don't usually have them on hand. It still turns out really good.

First I love this recipe because it doesn't take any hard to find ingredients.   This is awesome.  I love the different textures in this.  I don't really like cooked celery but it's good in here.  Many flavors come at you with every bit.  I did let mine rest a bit to let the flavors really come out and not just have a hot bowl of food.  My only deviation on this was I used maple sausage and green tabasco and thats because it's all i had at home.  I probably went heavy on the proteins but really its got good balance.  For someone who's always looking for good food and not stuff thats all saused up this is nice.     
One other thing I did different was my chicken was some I had smoked up the weekend earlier.  

But still this is very good and I'll make it again, and again, and well maybe again.

This turned out great for a quick lunch. Like other reviews it lacked a bit of heat so I doubled the spiciness by adding more hot sauce and Mrs. Dash spicy seasoning.  I also used canned tomatoes with diced chilis instead of plain. I didn't have bell peppers or celery on hand so I used sweet peppers and celery salt instead. I also used brown rice since it was all I had. I used a leftover chicken that I cooked in the crockpot earlier that week along with spicy chicken and beef sausage that I had in the freezer leftover from a cookout. All in all I think it turned out great. I doubled the batch to freeze for another day.

Great Jambalaya. Best I've ever enjoyed (though I've never actually visited any real Cajun restaurants)

Made it in 30 minutes--tastes like it's been simmering for hours!!  I followed the recipe more or less--used canned chicken because I didn't have any in the freezer and used andouille sausage  I added a splash of worchestershire sause just it round out the flavoring. This dish is easy fast and very flavorful--perfect score!

This recipe is amazing!!!  I added extra chicken broth and used Andouille Sausage which made it fantastic.  The first time I made it, I used hot Italian sausage.  Thank you Jen!!!

This recipe is amazing!  This was my first time making jambalaya, and I definitely picked the right recipe to try!  I stripped a cajun style rotisserie chicken, and used 4 pepper Eckrich sausage, and cooked shrimp and it was amazing!  I think the 4 pepper sausage gave it that extra kick, because we do like spicy!  Amazing!  Amazing!  Amazing!!!

I added half fresh tomatoes and half canned & didn't add any celery or hot sauce (my kids don't do spicy) and it tasted okay, I have a fire stove, not electric that only goes high, simmer, and warm so it was hard to determine medium high & medium low. By the time 20 minutes was up my rice was not cooked all the way and a little crunchy. Next time I will only add half tomatoes and probably only fresh (canned tomatoes just seem wrong and there were a lot of tomatoes) and possibly add a little more broth with seasoning.

While the finished product was edible, certainly, it was not nearly spicey enough for what I remember as a good Jambalaya.  I'll have to play around with the spices and find a different sausage to use (I used Andouille as other reviewers had) that is a spicier sausage...
