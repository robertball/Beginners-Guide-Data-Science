This was surprisingly good! I admit I was skeptical, but I just served this pie at a church dinner & people had no idea it wasn't actually pecan pie. It looked & tasted just like it! The recipe calls for 1/2 c. pecans. However, I did add in a few more than that--probably closer to 2/3 c. pecans. Excellent!

This is the real deal, y'all — serious pecan pie action going on here.  I prepared the recipe almost exactly as written.  Actually, I made two pies at once, so I used one entire can of pintos, drained (the recipe didn't say one way or the other), which ended up being a little more than ½c whole beans per pie.      Before I added the pinto beans, I smashed them flat into lumpy paste with a spatula.  I mixed everything together on my mixer's highest setting, so it was pretty smooth.  My hands were shaking a little when I measured the vanilla, so I think a little extra got in there.      I also used an entire 6oz bag (~1½c) of pecan halves to completely cover the top of two pies.  After 20 of the 60 minutes had passed, I covered the crust edges with foil.  Be careful, because the pie filling is still really sloshy at that point.    This tastes AMAZING — just like a pecan pie!  Definitely needs cold milk or whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.  :)  Next time, I think I'll make it in a real homemade crust instead of a refrigerated one.

GENIOUSE! This pie is excellent, and no corn syrup! I cut down the sugar to 1 1/4 cups, put a few extra beans, and didn't measure the nuts, just covered the top. I think I will experiment a little more next time- maybe add some chocolate chips.

I made this last night, following the recipe exactly. I was very excited because of the rave reviews. I don't want to be overly critical, but it truly tasted like pinto beans mixed in a super sugary filling--it was not very pleasant at all. I'm so sorry to leave this review, but I'd stick with a traditional recipe because this didn't taste like pecan pie.

I used navy beans intead of Pinto and topped the pie with pecans as others suggested.  It was delicious!  I'd like to try to use less butter next time.  I put all ingredients into my blender, mixed it, poured it into crust and topped with pecans.
