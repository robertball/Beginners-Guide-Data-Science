Great recipe just made it tonight. I used only about 1/8 cup lime juice (the concentrated kind) and even so the tofu came out a bit too sour. So maybe this recipe calls for 1/4 cup fresh lime juice? Anyway use the lime juice conservatively. Same goes for cayenne. I love spicy so I don't mind the kick but if you aren't a fan reducing the cayenne to 1/8 tspn might be good. Otherwise the dish is super flavorful and delish. Very summery.

This wasn't as great as I was hoping it would be. For having marinated the tofu cubes for almost 24 hours they had virtually no flavor. I did skewers with mushrooms cherry tomatoes and onion chunks along with the tofu. Thanks for letting me try it!:)

This is a good start for marinade try adding 1 and 1/2 Tablespoons of honey. Exchange out a 1/8 cup of the lime juice for 1/8 cup of rice vinegar.

I find that marinating tofu never really works. My "marinating" technique works every time. I boiled a few cups of water and seasoned the water with garlic powder and kosher salt to taste then I poured it over my tofu cubes and let it sit for 10-15 minutes. Then I followed the recipe except there is no need to add any salt at this point.

just like another review said way too sour! I even watered it down a bit. Maybe if you use half the amount of lime and some broth. It was too late to try after marinating it by instruction. I did a lot to try and save this because I didn't wanna make a second dinner but I had to review on my way back to the kitchen. By the way I marinated it over night. It might help if you only marinate for the 2 hours

This was my first time making tofu (after being disappointed at the prepared ones sold at the stores) and boy is this flavorful! It is spicy but we are used to spicy food (Indian Mexican etc) so that is part of the appeal. While it cooked (on a panini press) I used the marinade as a dressing for some carrots and quickly sauteed some sliced shiitake mushrooms. Served the slabs of tofu topped with the carrots mushrooms and sliced green onions. It was amazing.

Like other reviews say it's a bit on the sour/tangy side.

I used dried cilantro (about 2.5 tbsp) and reconstituted lime juice (1/4 cup) and skewered them for the grill. I only marinated 2.5 hours and didn't find it overly tangy or sour. I think people need to be really careful marinating tofu since it's basically a sponge (especially if you press it right--I used a TofuXpress overnight). Anyway I was using this recipe as a component in my Copycat Moe's burrito attempt. I think it did very well though fresh cilantro and lime juice will greatly benefit my next attempt.

This came out great. One tip I found in an other online recipe is to add some sugar so that the tofu can caramelize which it did. And I pureed the whole thing so that the cilantro can really get into the tofu. Finally I used half as much chili and cayenne pepper.

I've made this recipe several times. On skewers (with mushrooms and sliced summer squash) and as slabs. We prefer the slabs it marinates better and is easier to grill. I've made a few changes to the original recipe. I use a tofu press it takes more water out then just a weighted plate. I use fresh parsley instead of the cilantro 2 T. of olive oil and add 2 T. of soy sauce to the marinade. The longer you can marinate it the better. I turn it over several times throughout the day. I brush the remaining marinade over the tofu once it comes off the grill. Thank you for a tasty summer dinner recipe.

Excellent and simple. Love the spiciness of the dish. Works well broiling it in the oven as well. I paired it with veggie noddles and it helped balance the heat.

My go to grilled tofu recipe! Takes time and a bit spicy but amazing as long as you turn them frequently on the grill.

Loved this marinade!  I used to for both tofu and chicken.  My vegetarian daughter said the tofu was the best she's had and wants it again!  The chicken was amazing as well.  I did add some jalapeno to the marinade because I was chopping it up for salsa anyway.  I marinated in a ziploc bag for about 4 hours. Will definitely make again!

Loved this. The only change I made was to double the garlic. (I really like garlic.) Grilled on charcoal grill. I used leftover marinade to sautee spinach. Wonderful.

This was very good. Like others I cut the lime and added 1 T honey 2 T olive oil 1 T rice vinegar and 2 T soy sauce. Great base recipe that you can add your own twist to.

DELICIOUS!!! Since I didn't have chili powder or cayenne pepper at hand I used ground chipotle powder and it was still very delicious! I also used zucchini and yellow squash to accompany the skewers and served it with a side romaine lettuce salad.

Used 1/2 lime and 1/2 lemon juice based on other reviewers. Ended up marinating for two days rotating etc and flavor was still not especially strong. Not bad but just eeehhh...

Made these for my daughter and she loved them. I only marinaded the tofu for an hour but will try the 2 hrs next time to see if they turn out differently.

I made this tofu for a group of 30 people on a picnic day and everyone loved it! I received comments like"best tofu of my life" or "even better than Thai tofu". The only thing that I added more than the recipe was chili because I like it spicy.

Honestly just not much flavor. I'll try the grilled tofu in a salad perhaps the oil and vinegar dressing will liven it up a bit.

i made this primarily for bf's daughter (vegan).. and it was such a success.. we all really liked it.. bf's daughter said she'll try making this recipe at home as well.. i subbed bottled lemon juice for the lime veggie oil for the olive and omitted the cayenne (she doesn't like spicy).. i used our Marinator and marinated the tofu for about 2 hours and it could have benefitted for longer.. will definitely make this again as bf really enjoyed this and i'm trying to make healthier dishes for him.. ty for the recipe

I was rather shocked at how bland the tofu still tasted. I was very hopeful that a marinade such as this would help convert me to tofu as we are eating more and more vegetarian. As many others have commented all I tasted was a faint sour flavor. I still have a portion left marinating so maybe it will get better with more time but I think maybe the "wow" factor others have had with this recipe must be because of the smoky flavor from grilling the tofu. That's not an option for me today but maybe I'll try that in the future.

This was very good! Made exactly per the recipe but reduced the amount of cilantro a bit. Did it on a grill pan indoors and served it with Spanish rice and corn. The lime flavor came through very well and the cayenne warmed it up a little---will make again! TY!!

I've made this recipe three times and the trick really is to get the tofu as dry as possible so it will absorb the marinade. Also it is preferable to use fresh lemon juice and cilantro. I have never had it turn out too sour but my results do vary by how long I marinate it (overnight is best) and how dry I get the tofu first. I have doubled this recipe and used it to marinade other veggies that will go on the grill too.
