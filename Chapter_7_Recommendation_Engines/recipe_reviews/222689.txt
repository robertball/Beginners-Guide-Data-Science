I didn't have the peas or basil on hand, but made this with all the other ingredients and loved it!

An interesting combination, though we found it a touch bland.  I like the suggestion from another reviewer to add butter and garlic, and I may add more basil and cheese next time.

I love both asparagus and peas so I was excited to try this.  This was very good, but it might have been a bit bland if I hadn't added 1 Tablespoon butter and 3 cloves garlic.  With these additions, it was quite good and as pasta goes, it should be even better tomorrow.  Thanks for the recipe!
