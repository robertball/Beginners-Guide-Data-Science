Formed the dough into two 8 inch logs placed them in the freezer until hard.  Sliced frozen dough with a  deep crinkle cut veggie knife to get nice deep ridges.  Cookies looked great but were tough. Never baked a tough cookie before.  I love almond but thought this would be better with more vanilla and omit the almond.

These cookies taste almost like  I remember  them.I used a Pastry blender instead of a fork made the job very easy. I'll add this to my favorite list.
