EPIC FAIL! I followed this recipe exactly. Nearly ever egg cracked and leaked as soon as I put it in the water and not a single one was cooked all the way through.

My eggs were easy to peal and cooked perfectly, with no gray around the yolk. 

I waited until the water was at a rolling boil and cooked my eggs for 2 minutes, instead of one. One egg cracked and I removed it from the water, but all the others were good. 

Then, I removed the pot from heat and let the eggs sit covered in the hot water for 25 minutes.  I used cold water and ice to shock them after that.  They came out egg-cellent!
