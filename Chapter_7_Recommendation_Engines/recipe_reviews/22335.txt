Super easy and super delicious. I mistakenly used a pork tenderloin instead of a pork loin and it still worked great. I served the pork on onion burger buns and not a drop was left on anyone's plate.

Scrumdidlyumptious! I was embarrased from all the compliments I got for making this one. My father thought it should be sold frozen at grocery stores - which I strongly object to, but hey, it's that good. One thing...I didn't have tomato sauce or chiles, so I just pureed a can of rotel. It worked just wonderfully. In fact, I think I will just keep doing that since it turned out so great. Thank you so much Letha!

Really great, quick, easy recipe.  The pork comes out tender and flavorful.  I served it with warmed tortillas, shredded cheese, fresh tomatoes and lettuce, and sour cream.  Delish.  Seems like you can adjust the heat based on the type of barbeque sauce you use.  I used a well-known brand that made the sauce sweeter than I would have liked - next time I'll search for a sauce that is low on sugar.

Sorry...but this just wasn't good.  My husband & I thought that all you could taste was the chili powder and it totally masked all the other flavors, like the green chilis, etc.  There was nothing tex-mex about it.  Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this at all.  Sorry.

This was very good. I cooked in my slow cooker. I had it on 4 hours, it was cooked. I turned down the heat, added an extra can of tomato sauce and BBQ sauce, left on low the rest of the day.  Served on onion hamburger buns. Everyone loved it.

This is an awesome recipe. I mixed the sauce ingredients together the night before so in the morning all I had to do was place it all in the crockpot.

Extremely easy and tasty!

I altered it just a little by boiling a pork roast until tender then shredding and adding to the slow cooker with the sauce....VERY TASTY results. We served it on taco shells and our 12 yr old daughter made a taco salad with it. thank you for the recipe.

I loved this recipe it was a nice change of pace from the normal tacos i made.. i did the same thing as another cook i substituted the tomato sauce for chipoltes in adobe sauce and it was a great spicy dish. I topped it with guac, tomatoes, cheese, and sour cream i recommend it if your looking for a twist on the average taco!

I made this with one change: I swapped the tomato sauce for chipotles in adobo sauce.  The chipotles are whole and have to be chopped, which I do in my mini chopper/food processor.  This change made the pork spicier and smokier.  It was awesome!!!

I'm reviewing this recipe for my mother who does not have access to a computer but found this recipe in the Allrecipe cookbook.  She used beef rather than pork and said this dish had a nice combination of flavors. The meat was tender and it made good sandwiches. Would make again.  Thanks for sharing Letha.

This is absolutely delicious and moist. I followed the recipe exactly. I found the longer it sits (overnight) the better it is. Everyone LOVED it. Thank you so much for sharing!!

Good, but I don't get what is so Tex Mex about this recipe!  It's pretty ordinary pulled pork, in my opinion.  We did enjoy it in some tacos with homemade quac!

Delicious, but slightly too tangy.  Maybe reducing the lemon juice and excluding the cilantro will help.

This is some great stuff.  I love it, my husband loves it and the kids love it.  It makes enough for several days and is easily adaptable to ingredients that are on hand.  Makes the house smell wonderful while simmering away!  Good hot in the winter or cold in the summer, it can't be beat for an easy, delicious meal.  I have made it several times and have a pork roast warming as I write this.  Try it soon!

This was just OK.  Had 2 pieces of meat to use up, so I made this and one other recipe that I had made before.  I had high hopes this one would be better.  Not bad, but not for us.

Super easy and quick, didn't even take me 20 minutes to whip up. I also added some franks hot sauce, and used fresh chili peppers instead of canned.

This was really delicious, but came out more like a chili /soup than a sandwich filler.  I substituted a packet of chili seasoning for the chili powder and cumin and used one can of diced jalapenos for one of the cans of chilis....kicked it up a notch!  If you like a pork chili then you'll love this!

This is the first time that I have made pulled pork and it was awesome! My husband and I loved it, so it definately goes in my recipies.  I didn't have some of the ingredients so I compromised with what I had on hand and it came out super. I used tomato paste and added water, used a green pepper instead of a chile, 2 different kinds of BBQ sauce,(KC masterpiece & a honey flavored one),not as much chili powder, & didn't have cilantro. It was done in about 6 hours...Mmmmm....

We left the bone in because it was cheaper and when it was done cooking the meat literally fell off the bone.  I thought we cooked enough for two meals but there wasn't even enough leftovers to put on a sandwich the next day. DELICIOUS!

I made this exactly as written except I didn't use BBQ sauce because we don't like it, instead I used ketchup and some chipotle chiles in adobo sauce.  Turned out great.  We ate it in corn tortillas and I put a dollop of sour cream on mine.

I just realized that I did this recipe wrong.  I only used 1/4 cup of bbq sauce. Bummer.  Which is probably why the chili powder seemed to over-powering to me. I did not put in the cinnamon because that didn't sound good to me. Very easy to do and throw together in the crock. Will have to try again with the right amount of ingredients.

This recipe was super easy and delicious! I used leftover grilled pork tenderloin from the night before. I chopped it up and added the rest of the ingredients, then served it over white rice.

Very good receipe.  I added more tomato sauce and my family requested trying a sweeter BBQ sauce and little less chili powder for a sweeter flavor.

This is very good, very lean, very easy.  Perfect to serve for some family members who are diabetic!  I will definately be serving again.  

I did add 1 whole can of tomato sauce and I served taco style with low carb whole wheat wraps, low fat sour cream, and shredded cheese.  Yum. 

Maybe next time I will add some liquid smoke just to give it a little more of a smoky flavor.

Nice start but not a go on the original recipe.  I added one tblsp of unsweetened cocoa and increased the cinammon to one tblsp.  I also increased the amount of tomato sauce to two cans and added a can of diced stewed tomatoes.  The garlic I amped up to three heaping tblsps of fresh minced and the rest of the seasonings to three times what was suggested in the recipe.  I also had to keep adding water to the whole meal since the moisture boils off and gets far too thick.  Nice start of a recipe but really needed alot of help.

We didn't like this a bit. Probably because BBQ sauce is sweet and it just didn't seem to go with the other flavors.

I've made this recipe about a dozen times now.  It's a favorite. I do cut the chili powder in half, and double the pork but this always makes a great meal. Also great on nachos!

Added half a tin each of corn kernels and chick peas for a more Mexican look and replaced the tinned jalopeno with a fresh one. Served it with sour cream, grated cheddar, chopped cucumber and tomato in pita's. Wonderful!

This was really good.  I had a whole pork tenderloin left over.  I made the sauce in a skillet.  Added some green bell pepper, cooked it with a cover for about an hour.  Added some garlic as well.  Put the pork in at the end just to heat.  Turned out great.

Unlike any Tex-Mex I've ever tasted...... this is more like the stews you taste in Guadalajara. Def leave out the cinnamon gives it too much of a candy taste. I'll pass. 
PS Guess we'll go out for Tex-Mex for dinner cause this is what I cooked for my family's dinner and I'm not serving this to them.

This was a huge hit with my family. We do not like cilantro so I didn't include it and it was still fabulous. I actually doubled this recipe and made it for my son's baptism luncheon. It was a huge hit at the party too!

This was fine, however, definitely did not taste Tex Mex. Although I should've known it would be that way, i'm pretty sure it was because of the bbq sauce.

Very good! Family luved it! However, I would  use less chili powder......it was very dominant. But if you do not use enough I think it may remind you of Sphagetti?

I am giving this four stars, simply because it was really good, but not quite great.  I think next time, I'll double the tomato sauce and halve the BBQ sauce.  It just tasted like BBQ pork to my family.  Maybe add some lime and some liquid smoke next time and not add quite so much chili powder.  Thanks for sharing!

Cooked mine on low in the crock about 6 hours, but the tomato base turned a little dark and slightly bitter. Would pass on this recipe next time making pulled pork, sorry.

I followed the recipe except no onion. I used stubbs original barbq sauce and used half the cinammon. It came out perfect not too sweet like other reviewers posted.  Everyone loved it served with tortillas and taco garnishes. No left overs :(

I've been making a very similar version of this from a Taste of Home mag and it's always been incredible! Full of amazing flavors and makes excellent tacos. Will try with rice, cilantro, and lime. Sounds delish!

Delicious with chicken I had on hand.  I just cut the chicken breasts into large chunks and threw them in raw.  Probably even better with pork!  The type of BBQ sauce really impacts the flavor.  I used Annie's Organic Maple and it was wonderful.  My husband and I discovered we liked it better over a bowl of brown rice.

Either everyone was very hungry or the loved this dish.  I thought I would have leftovers, but the family just gobbled it all up.  Followed directions, except I forgot the cilantro.  It was still very good.  Cooked for 9 hours on low and that was just perfect for a 1 1/2 lb loin.  Will definately make again.

This is awesome.  I cooked it 8 hours - plenty of time.  And reduced the chili powder some.  I didn't have any cinnamon and it still tasted sooo great.  I also used my homemade bbq sauce that my family has used for years - it doesn't have sugar, so this was really flavorful.  I'll keep this and use again!

Delicious!  We love that cinnamon and chili taste!  No changes needed here - other than this works really well with chicken for those of us who don't eat too much pork!  Made this for a Christmas potluck and grabbed a bag of mini dinner rolls from Costco - I was so disappointed that there were NO leftovers!  Thanks for a yummy recipe!

I don't know what went wrong with this, but it was just not good.  My boyfriend didn't think it was too bad, but not the best either.  I didn't change anything except to put a bit less chili powder in it, but it wasn't what turned me off on it.  I cooked it on low heat and it just didn't turn out.  Had a burned sweet taste to it.

Very good! In my opinion the cinnamon is what makes this recipe so good and stand out from the others.

I didn't have enought time to cook it for 10 hours so I slightly browned the pork before throwing it in the crockpot. I also used pork tenderloin.

I used venison instead of pork, and it was so-so. It might not be as bad without the cilantro, but I don't think I'd make it again to find out.

I used less chili powder- 1 tbs, and less green chile peppers.  I served this in a tortilla and added rice and lettuce.  Very good!

Meat had no flavor.  The sauce didn't have enough flavor to save it.  I served the pork on a bun with hot sauce.  That didn't help so I added cole slaw.  That helped a little.  I would not make this again.

For all the ingredients this recipe calls for I didn't think it had much taste.  It was spicy, but that's it.  No definitive flavor.

Very tasty! I made this for a skating party and everyone enjoyed it. I used spicy BBQ sauce and substituted 3 jalapeno peppers (without the seeds) for the chiles.

I served it with flour tortillas, but it was a bit messy. Ate the leftovers with rice the following day and that seemed to work better and was just as good. Will likely serve with buns next time.

My husband was a little sceptical when I said I was going to try out this recipe.  I made it for dinner last night and got a thumbs up.  In fact we are going to make it for our Superbowl party this year.  I did add some garlic and cut back the cinnamon a little. I was also careful to use a "not so sweet" bbq sauce as other review suggested and it was delicious!

I'd originally given this recipe two stars because I served the meat in tortillas with cheese and salsa (and it was horrid -- imagine a sweet pork taco -- yuck!).  Into the freezer-of-no-return the leftovers went.  Two months pass, and I start to feel guilty.  So I mixed the meat with some BBQ sauce and served it on wheat buns.  THIS we liked.

Too heavy on the chili powder.  My 3 young kids liked it, but I kept the sauce on the side for two of them.
