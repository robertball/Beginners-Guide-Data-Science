Fantastic!  I am always looking for ways to pack in lots of veggies and a potato salad that isn't oozing in mayo.  This was the best find.  My husband and I love it so much that we made it for our wedding buffet and our guests raved about it.  My suggestion is to save the dressing in a seperate container and add just before serving- it tasts best that way and is one of the few recipes that does not benefit from marinading overnight.

We absolutely love this recipe at our house.  We reduce the amount of basil and prefer to serve it warm.  It is a new family favorite!

I saw this in the USA Weekend on Sun., Aug. 20 and HAD to make it.  I was not disappointed. It is outstanding and so very delicious....not to mention "healthful."

This was good.  Next time I will make a couple of changes by omitting the tomatoes and capers, and just using my own oil based dressing, but this is a good base to then play with and perfect your own style of potato salad.

Although different from traditional potato salad, I found the change refreshing and light.  It was a huge hit at a family gathering yesterday and I will be making this often.  I'd like to have these leftovers on-hand to eat for several healthy meals and snacks.
Update:  My husband requested this to take to a picnic at work tomorrow, and I've already promised to make it for a potluck luncheon in 3 weeks.  Fantastic!

Bright, colorful, delicious potato salad.  Made this for Easter lunch and really liked it.  It does need the salt and pepper to draw all the flavors together.  This salad held up very well for leftovers 2 days after Easter.  I liked how pretty and presentable it was.  Great summer dish with fresh green beans and new red potatoes.  Thanks Jean for submitting this recipe.

This is not my favourite potato salad but it is good to have a nice container of this chilled in the fridge for those hot summer days or when you need a veggie fix.
Left out the capers because i didn't have any

I gave this recipe five stars because it can be changed to include just about any vegetable you have in your fridge.  Reduced the amount of oil used and added that secret ingredient--anchovy.  So many people say they don't like anchovies but it does a layer of flavor that no one recognizes an anchovy.

I made 6 servings of this today and we liked the combination of flavors  once I could get my green bean hating family members to try it.   The capers are a nice touch, especially if serving with grilled burgers with herbed feta cheese.  It is a nice, healthy alternative to higher fat potato salads.

Great for something different!  Next time I might add some corn and less oil - probably cut the amount in half.

wonderful salad... don't omit a thing. After cooking green beans put them in cold ice water to stop cooking process. Keep potatoes and green beans crisp.

This is going in the rotation - great for potlucks! I made 8 servings and it was enough for about 4 meals as a (large) side. I blanched the beans (you can use the potato water when they're done) and skipped the capers (because I forgot to buy them) and it was delicious! I will definitely try with the capers next time and/or try another reviewer's idea of adding anchovies (yum!). I will probably also roast the potatoes whole instead of boiling. The smaller the potatoes the better - would work with any firm-fleshed variety (purple? golden nugget? fingerling?), just don't overcook them. Oh yeah, I also added just a touch of maple syrup to the dressing, used a grainy mustard, and a lot less onion, very finely chopped.

Not sure if I'll make this again.  It was OK, but I think we like other potato salad recipes better.  OK for something different

I had 30 people over and this salad was great.
It is colorful and the best thing is that instead of having two or three additional side dishes, this is everything in one.  It follows the KISS principle.  The balsamic dressing works very well and the flavors work beautifully together.

Delish. Made it for a party and everyone liked it.  The only change I made was to add both salt and a little seasoning salt.  I will definitely make this again.

This fabulously delicious & wonderfully colorful.  Made this recipe exactly as directed except did not have fresh basil so used dried.  Definitely will be a staple.

Awesome summer salad that can virtually be used as a meal in and of itself. Needed quite a bit of salt. And though it seemed like a lot of basil to me, it's perfect.
