After reading the only review for this recipe, I decided to not bother cooking the mushrooms and meat separately, but stuff the raw sausage mixture into the mushroom caps.  I also halved the amount of breadcrumbs the recipe called for.  The result was a moist and delicious appetizer.  I baked them at 350° for 30 minutes.  The recipe could use a little more seasoning to me, but it was still very good.

I made this tonight for a thanksgiving side! The taste was wonderful! The whole plate was devoured. I bought sweet Italian sausage without the casing and I only had string  cheese mozzarella on hand which I sliced thin to incorporate into the mix. My only drawback was I wished the filling didn't turn out so dry.

I used quesadilla cheese and crushed up stove top because that's all that I had and they actually turned out really good!

Very good and simple recipe. I did a little tweaking to it and sauteed the garlic, onion, herbs, and mushroom stems (after putting the stems and onion in a food processor) in the butter for about 10 minutes on medium heat then added the sausage and bread crumb and stirred it up. After it was thoroughly mixed I spooned it into the caps, baked it, and topped it with the cheese. Came out superb. I used three Trader Joe's Italian Sausage links.

First off, I am declaring this as a rating with MAJOR modifications. That said, I used this as my inspiration for creating a stuffed portobello cap as an entree instead of an appetizer portion.  I used a sausage recipe from this site, with almond flour and eggs as the binder, cooked in portobello caps. I will get my personal recipe loaded to the site, but wanted to thank the creator for this; otherwise, I would not have had my inspiration.

Took this as an appetizer for Thanksgiving. Everyone raved about them.  I didn’t cook the mushrooms in the olive oil first, but I did drizzle them with olive oil before baking them. I added a chopped jalapeño to the stuffing mixture.
