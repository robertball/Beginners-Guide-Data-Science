I loved the results that I got - but I did substantial tinkering!  I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned, and instead of mushroom-juice and chicken boullion cubes, I used two cups of strong, homemade chicken stock, and thickened it just a touch.  I also used sharp paprika instead of mild, and increased it to about three tablespoons.  I used eight boneless chicken thighs.  Plenty of gravy for mixing with the rice.  Rave reviews.  I definitely will make this again!

I was raised on this chicken recipee, although slightly different...try adding a sweet juicy tomato and some chunks of green pepper for even more flavour, omit the sour cream and cook till sauce is reduced and thickened...and only use Hungarian paprika, makes a world of difference. This dish can also be made with stewing beef or pork. YUM!!!

With the changes I made, it will definitely be repeated over and over. I seasoned the chicken thighs (all I had) with garlic powder, adobo and pepper. I also added about 1/2 cup of white wine and used fresh mushrooms. Other than these changes I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious! Thanks for sharing!!

This was good served over spaetzle.  I used half hot and sweet paprika and added some white cooking wine.  I think it could have used a little more spicing up, I had to keep it mild for my 18 month old daughter.

This turned out pretty good, but I too made changes.  I didn't have any paprika so I substituted cumin and coriander.  (We love Mexican).  I also added about a cup of water along with the mushroom liquid to make more gravy.  Still I wished I had used more water.  Still wasn't enough gravy.  Will try again.

Great recipe, great taste.  I used fresh mushrooms and added about 1/4 cup of water as the liquid.  Instead of spooning over rice in individual servings, I just mixed the entire dish with a cup of cooked white rice in a big bowl.  It was delicious...fed three grown men...they just kept eating and eating....we all really enjoyed this one.  Thank you!

Great easy recipe! I'm always looking for new and simple chicken dinners, and this did the trick, at least for my husband. He enjoyed it, although my two-year-old daughter was not a fan of the mushroom flavor.

This was good, but like everyone else, I used it as a base...omit canola oil and just use olive oil spray. Whole onion, 1 clove garlic, used boneless chik thighs, added a green pepper and fresh  mushrooms, sauteed all together, had plenty of juices, but added a tiny bit of low sodium chik broth and reduced, then added low fat sour cream,topped with large handful of fresh chopped parsley. Yum. I'll make again.

My husband and I thought this was one of the worst meals we've ever had.  Chicken dry and tasteless, sauce(?) awful, just all around bad.  If you make all the changes everyone says to make then you aren't making this recipe anyway.

This dish was simply delicious. I didn't think I would like it that much but one taste and I was hooked.  My family and I have made this dish twice this week it was so good. I would recommend this to anyone.

Very Good!! The only thing I changed was to do 1 cube of boullion and no salt- as the recipe states it was almost too salty the first time, so these minor tweaks did the trick. Great meal.

This came out pretty good, although my chicken was not as moist and tender as many other reviewers raved!  The recipe did not specify how high the heat should be (medium, medium-high, etc.) or how long to cook the chicken.  So, there was some guesswork involved...but it is definitely worth experimenting with again sometime!

Excellent! Tastes very good with rice too, love the gravy. Only adjustment I did was use fresh mushroom and clarified butter instead of canned mushrooms and canola oil.

This recipe is bland even by my husband's standards - and he never eats peppers, even black. I thought with the paprika and sour cream, it might be tasty but it was more tastless. After tasting, I added some tomatoes and it was still bland. I finally added some mayo and Dejon Mustard. My husband told me to remove it from my cookbook. I gave it two stars because it was edible, not enjoyable.

I made this last night for my husband and myself. It was pretty good, a little bland in my opinion. We both added quite a bit of hot sauce and I added garlic to the chicken while sauteeing. I did use fresh mushrooms, added tomato, white wine and extra sour cream for more sauce to spoon over rice.

I added quite a bit more sour cream to make more sauce.  I made it twice--once with regular sour cream, once with light sour cream.  Stick to the regular--the sauce was too watery with the light version.

This was pretty good, and so easy to make!  I one-halfed the recipe but used the whole can of mushrooms, so it was a little watery, but still good.  The paprika and bouillion don't lend very strong flavors - we needed quite a bit of salt and pepper.  I will make this again!  We had it with rice this time, next time will try pasta.

Tasty, yet very quick and simple to make.  Chicken is very soft and juicy.   Even my two year old daughter loved it.  I would try to find a way to make it with more gravy, though.  It was barely enough to put on the rice.

This dish is yummy.  My husband complained there wasn't wnough sauce...he wanted more to mix through his rice.  I used 8 oz of fresh mushrooms and those were very good in the mix.

My husband and I love this recipe. I make it 2-3 times a month. I'm always on the lookout for quick, simple, and tasty recepies. This is delicious. I bring the leftovers into work and everyone wants to know how to make it.

excellent!  my husband is of hugarian descent and said this dish reminds him of his grandmother's cooking.  i added *a lot* more paprika than the recipe says, and added chopped fresh garlic - we like things spicy.

My family really loves this dish.  My 4 year old son just "snarfs" it up.  Our Hungarian friend says it reminds him of something his mother used to make when he was little and he will eat the whole skillet full if I would let him.

This was delicious.  I made it with skinned chicken thighs, fresh mushrooms and a little water.  There was enough flavor as written.  I might add a tsp of flour next time to thicken it just a little.  Served over spätzle.

It was kind of bland, but still good.  It took no time at all to make, and so it's good for a quick weeknight meal.  I would make this again, but maybe with more vegetables.  I used fresh mushrooms too, which was delicious.

I really did not like this dish.  I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned and they were boiled by this recipe, and the flavor was terrible.  Maybe it's better with canned mushrooms?  The chicken was tender, and I added fresh tomato which helped the overwhelming mushroom flavor - but still, the sour cream addition was odd too.

This was the best of both worlds.  Fantastic flavor and quick and easy to prepare.  I used light (not "no fat) sour cream and I didn't find the sauce too runny.  Everyone here loved it.  Thanks!

This was very easy to make.  My husband liked this and so did my 4 year old.  I didn't have the chicken boullion, but it still turned out great.  I will make this again.  Thanks for the recipe!
