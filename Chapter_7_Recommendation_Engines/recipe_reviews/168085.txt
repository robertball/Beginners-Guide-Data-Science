I made these today, and while the flavour is nice, the peanut butter mixture began to set VERY quickly, so it was difficult to mix it through the cereal evenly.  The recipe said to use honey or corn syrup.  I was using honey.  I don't know if this was the reason it set so fast.

Mmmmmm. I love this recipe. And it's so easy to halve or fourth. Sometimes I just eyeball it and make myself a little rice krispie treat! I've tried this with honey and corn syrup, but I like corn syrup better. I love honey, but the taste was kind of overwhelming the peanut butter and chocolate. I am first and foremost a peanut butter/chocolate lover. :)

Very good!  I would make more of the peanut butter sauce to pour a smidgen over the top next time.  That's probably because my school system made them that way.   Easy to make, I had no problems mixing it.  I used corn syrup.

We liked this but my family prefers when I use white sugar instead of brown sugar and I always use the corn syrup.   I melt 1 cup butterscotch chips and 1 cup chocolate chips and spread on top. This makes them even yummier.

These tasted yummy! They are like peanut butter fudge rice crispie treats, more chewy than crunchy.

These are soo good!  It's a good thing I halved the recipe, because I almost ate the whole pan!  I was going to add the chocolate on top but started to eat them before they were set.  Very good and easy to whip up.  I have made a similar recipe with corn flakes and regular sugar(instead of brn sugar), then drop a spoonful onto waxed paper.  This method is much easier and they taste the same.

Why five stars? Very easy to make and tastes soooo good. The chocolate on top is what makes it!

Very delicious! I found this recipe when I came upon the butterscotch rice krispie treats which was also very good. I made it exactly as written and I added the semi-sweet chocolate on half of the treats so I would be able to find out which way was better. They both came out perfect but the chocolate part was my favorite. I will keep this recipe with my new butterscotch one also.

I like this because it isn't TOO sweet.
