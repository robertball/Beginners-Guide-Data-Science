This was superb tasting, easy, quick, and made a beautiful presentation.  I felt like a professional chef putting it out on the table.  I added some sliced fresh baby bella mushrooms and replaced the fresh plum tomatoes with a 28 oz can of seasoned diced tomatoes (maybe 3/4 of the can).  Fantastic!

This recipe has had really good reviews, but it  has no seasonings at all, not even a little salt.  I prepared it exactly as the recipe was written, tasted it after simmering for 10 minutes, and it just tasted like the canned tomato sauce.  To salvage our dinner, I then added a link of italian sausage, a little basil, oregano, salt & pepper, and a pinch of red pepper flakes.  Sorry, I won't be making this again.

WOW!!!! I agree, this is the best and fastest tomato sauce I have ever made or eaten in any restaraunt!! I changed just a couple of things, calamta olives instead of regular black olives, and I added 1 large Italian Sausage, browned and crumbled. Crazy Good. Thanks for the recipe, it is now my family's #1 recipe.

I did my own little variation to this sauce, I didn't have tomatoes or tomatoe sauce, so I used picante sauce. :/ It still turned out really good. I will definately make this again when I don't have any store bought pasta sauce. 
Thanks.

Not a bad sauce overall, I like the olive oil, sauce, cheese, and the other ingredients. It lacks seasoning, which you will likely need to add. I used a garlic infused olive oil and a garlic and onion seasoning. I left out the black olives and peppers since we were out.

Wonderful, tasty, fast. I added 12 oz of ground beef to punch up the protein, a 15 oz can of diced tomatoes (no fresh ones) and 8 oz of tomato sauce. Needed a little salt to make it perfect.

It was delicious!!!! All we added was a bit of pepper, and salt.  We also put in a bit of sweet sausage to give it a bit more taste and protein.  We highly recommend it!

Delicious and versatile. I did add a splash of worcestershire sauce to deepen the flavor and seasoned with a little salt. It was so quick and easy that I doubt I will ever bother with bought sauces again. I have lots of ideas to build on this recipe such as wine and cream for a special occasion or to thicken it up a little for pizza topping. Kids gave it the thumbs up (although one picked out the olives...) which is always a huge victory for me! Thank you for sharing!

I tried this recipe tonight, with a few adjustments to reflect what I had on hand. Instead of using plum tomatoes, I used a can of diced tomatoes. I also added salt, pepper, Italian seasoning, and red pepper flakes to add a little spice. The sauce was really tasty, but very simple. Next time I'll add Italian seasoning and I think it will be perfect.
