It was a cold day here in Buffalo, NY and this really hit the spot. A real comfort food. I only had smoked sausage on hand and it turned out great. I think it would also be good with ham. It's the kind of dish you can use your imagination with. Good recipe for a cold day.

My husband liked it, but I thought it was rather plain and mushy.

I followed the recipe, except used a 12 ounce bag of noodles and only one 12 ounce roll of Jones original breakfast sausage.  It is wonderful.  My husband loved it.  I threw in one carrot chopped up for some 'color'.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Holy Cow - this recipe rocked. I made it as a side dish and we wished it was the main course.  So much more healthy than plain buttered noodle haluski!  The only change I made was to add a bit of chicken broth to the water. One reviewer thought it was mushy - I suggest cooking the noodle all the way and adding in the last few minutes. Delicious!  I will be sharing this one! Thanks.

We did a Mexican Polish version of this dish. I used chipotle kielbasa sausage, two cups of peppers, one onion, and then 1/2 the liquid - chicken broth. I fried the cabbage with the meat and veggies, tossed in the cooked noodles (al dente), then cooked down the stock. I put in one large diced tomato just before serving. It was really good. Excellent recipe to springboard from!

Awesome, hearty, and filling, and adaptable to whatever you like or have on hand. We ate the leftovers from this all weekend, changing it a little each time to make a "new" meal.

Made ths recipe for my wife who loves the compination of cabbage and a starch such as noodles or potatoes.  Maybe it was the fact I used egg noodles instead of the ones listed in the recipe (they dont carry these in my market) but the end result was a mush and the wife, using our family rating system, said this should never return to the table.  I even suggested some variations, but no.  It's a shame.  I was thinking this would be a home run, but in the end I struck out swinging.
