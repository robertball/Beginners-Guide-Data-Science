These were pretty good. I agree that there is just a little too much peanut butter, but that can be adjusted. I only did half with the peanut butter and chocolate filling and the other half I filled with nutella and the marshmallows, and those turned out wonderfully.

This was quick and easy and baked nicely.  I didn't care for the result, though. Too much peanut butter and not enough chocolate for my taste, but my husband liked it enough to eat the rest.

wow. I was looking for a quick easy dessert with puff pastry and really found it! I havn't tried it yet but with chocolate and peanut butter, how can it be bad. I didnt have marshmellows so I used teaspoon of Fluff.The presentation is lovely and you can make this little pastry cups with anything inside really.

out of the three puff pastry desserts i made, this was the least desired.  i actually made this for my brother in law because he enjoys peanut butter, but he only ate half.  i had to sprinkle mini chocolate chips on mine because the peanut butter was just too overpowering.
