I loved experimenting with rice noodles. I have never used them before. I went to the grocery store with a copy of this recipe,the cashier is from Phillipines and suggested that I used green cabbage instead of Bok Choy, it worked very well and it was a lot cheaper anyways. I also used chicken instead of pork. I felt this needed more sauce so I increased the amount of oyster sauce and added some soy sauce as well. I loved this dish and it is so different from what I usually make, so it was fun.

A co-worker of mine made Panict for us a few weeks ago. It was the first time I had tried it and I fell in love. When I found this recipe I had to try making it my own. What an easy recipe to follow with yummy results! I also added carrots and snow peas. Thanks for the recipe!

I've been making pancit all my life and thank you, thank you for showing me a MUCH easier way to cook it! Growing up, I had only ever seen this cooked one way - stir fry the vegetables, then add the noodles - and I always hated how hard it was to stir after the noodles were added! All Filipinos have their own preference for their pancit - I like mine with soy sauce and lots of lemon. I use just about any meat and veggies I have available at the time. The oyster sauce is a nice touch.

I made this dish as is, and was not impressed. My family did not like it. They prefer the original that I normally make which was an authentic recipe from a born Filipino friend of mine.  She softened the rice noodles in water. She used extra virgin olive oil, 2 cloves fresh garlic minced, 1 onion diced, 1cup red cabbage shredded, 1 cup green cabbage shredded, 1 carrot shredded, salt and pepper to taste, soy sauce, shrimp/pork/chicken she would choose 1 or 2 of the meats. She has made this often for me. It tasted great. By the way...Oyster sauce is not used for this recipe as it is not the Fili way!  I give 2 stars for effort!

Rave reviews at my table, both for the flavour, and for the appearance.  I used rice vermicelli noodles.  And this recipe is quick: about 35 minutes after arriving home, it was on the table.

very good recipe, but omitted the bok choy, sauteed pork tenderloin in oyster sauce, and would suggest using bean vermicelli instead of rice vermicelli, as rice vermicelli gets mushy quite easily.  Otherwise excellent!

I absolutely loved this!  The sauce was delicate and flavorful. You could taste the other ingrediants because they weren't overwhelmed with sauce. I had never used bok choy before and wasn't sure which part to put in, so I cut up the dark leafy greens as well as the stalk-good to add for texture. When I tasted the bok choy raw, it tasted bitter so I chickened out and used half bok choy and half cabbage. I shouldn't of worried, the bok choy mellowed out with cooking--no bitter taste at all.

I thought this was great. I didn't change a thing; I think the bok choy is a very necessary ingredient!  Very quick from prep to table.  One of my new favorites.

Restaurant quality food right here! My tweaks: used chicken & shrimp instead of pork. Didn't have already-cooked chicken, so I marinated the chicken in 2 TBSP soy sauce, 2 TBS Fish Sauce and a pinch of brown sugar about an hour ahead of time. Didn't have oyster sauce, so used the chicken marinade instead, and added about a TBSP more soy to the dish at the end. Used cabbage instead of Bok Choy, as that is what I had on hand. Left out the red pepper to see if my kid would eat it, and she LOVED it (9 years old).  Hubs and I added red pepper to our own bowls. Superb!

After having tried this at a friends home I was in love. Her father-in-law is from panama and makes  pancit (prounounced ponsit by them) regularly. I have always wanted to try it but never seemed to be able to get the recipe from them. After seeing this I was elated. The five star rating is for the recipe and idea however I did make changes after talking with my friend. I used chopped pork and small shrimp which I sauted in oil with a shallot and chopped garlic. I added the oyster sauce, some soy sauce and the chicken broth and ginger into the pan as well. Then instead of Bok Choy I bought a bag of cole slaw mix (chopped cabbage and carrot) and added 1/2 of that. I had soaked the rice noodles for ten minutes per package directions then drained and added to the pan as well. Everthing then simmered together for about 15-20 min. and served. This was delicious. I'm afraid my noodles wernt as soft as I would have liked which may be because the package said soak for 10 min and the recipe for 20 min. I will soak for the longer time next time I make it and hope they get a little softer upon sitting in the mix. This made alot and I will have enough for another meal easily. I did double the liquid ingrediants and used a whole can of the chicken broth (as well as several Tsp of soy sauce) to keep the moistness in and it still was not soupy or wet but had great flavor. Thanks for a great base Rayna!

Really great recipe -- my boyfriend's favorite.  I use rice vermicelli, fresh ginger, and chicken instead of pork, and I like snow pea pods for the crunch.  I've also started stir-frying the meats in one TBSP chili paste, 1/2 TBSP soy sauce, and 1 TBSP canola oil first.  Then, I nix the crushed red pepper flakes because the spicy meats make the entire dish much hotter.  Sometimes I use bok choy but I've also used a half head of regular cabbage and it turns out fine.  This is one of those recipes you cannot screw up, I promise!  I even stopped measuring out my ingredients and we just add to-taste, particularly with the oyster sauce.  We love the rich flavor of this simple dish!

So delicious!  This recipe was a great jumping off point.  I made a few minor changes/additions based on other reviews--subbed chicken for pork and cabbage for bok choy.  Also added more garlic, and a little bit of honey, fish sauce, hot sauce, white pepper, and rice wine vinegar at the end to punch up the flavor of the sauce.  I also just stirred the noodles in with everything else.  That way they absorb the flavors better.   I couldn't believe I had made something so tasty.  It tastes like something from a restaurant.  I will make this again and again.

Really tasty. I had some leftover ground pork so I was going to use that. Turns out after I defrosted it,  it was ground beef. No time to go get pork so I made this with ground beef and shrimp. added some shredded carrots and used a sack of regular shredded cabbage. I can never find rice noodles around  here so I use shirataki noodles.

This was really good!  Even my husband liked it and  he doesn't typically like this style of cooking.  Some changes that I made:  I used 2 packages of rice noodles instead of one, decreased oil to tablespoons total, increased garlic to 4 cloves, used 3 cups shrimp, 1 chicken breast chopped up (didn't have pork), shredded red cabbage instead of bok chop, 3 tablespoons fish sauce (couldn't find oyster sauce), used about 3/4 cup chicken stock, and added shredded carrrots and peppers. I also used fresh lemon juice at the end which gave it a nice fresh taste. Next time I cook this, I will add even more vegetables (i'm thinking mushrooms and zucchini), add chopped up peanuts, and increase the crushed red pepper flakes.

This was a big hit! Did everything in batches noodles, then meat with sauce and bok choy. Then with my food processor I thin sliced carrots, cabbage, onions and added mung bean sprouts. Added same sauce ingredients to vegetable mix then when done added them to the meat and noodle mix. Everyone loved it and we will definitely be making this again.

I thought this recipe was great!  I made it with some leftover shredded pork loin that I had made earlier in the week in the crock pot.  The pork kind of reminded us of tuna and with the seasonings and sauce from this recipe it worked very well.  I'll definitely make this again when I have leftover pork to use up.

Great easy and versatile recipe. I love pancit but I never thought making it would be so easy. Granted, the Filipino women I work with make it so much better but I was really pleased with the results the first time cooking it! I didn't use pork, only shrimp. I also used cabbage instead of bok choy.. I'm not a big fan of bok choy. I think cabbage tastes much better. Id recommend breaking the noodles in half before soaking (they have the tendency to stick together) and it needed a little soy sauce in my opinion but otherwise it was great!

FANTASTIC! Even my husband raved and he's a picky eater. He was still talking about it when we went to bed last night. Used receipe as written with exception of omitting red pepper flakes and adding soy sauce. Can't wait to have leftovers tonight and trying the recipe with other meats or seafood. Thanks so much for sharing this Rayna.

Good basic and quick recipe -- can be a great leftover user (a pork chop, extra shrimp from shrimp cocktail, prepared cole slaw mix before it turns to something scarily slimy, etc.) Agree with reviews stating it could use a bit more flavor, but that is easily done: kick up salt (instead of adding soy sauce, which in my view starts the dish down the road towards leftover Chinese food), pepper, use hoisin sauce instead of oyster sauce, add lemon juice and chives, for example.

Per recommendations below, I doubled the sauce, doubled the pepper flakes and added a Tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce. I can tell that without the extra sauce and spice this may have proved to be a bit on the bland side. As cooked, it was okay, but nothing extra special.

This recipe was pretty good, and its a healthy choice. I read the reviews and figured that it would need some spicing up, so I added more red pepper flages and some soy sauce for added flavor. My only other suggestion is to saute the onions and garlic alone before adding the shrimp, pork, and other ingredients. But overall, a good meal.

I made a few modifications to this recipe in that I used only chicken and I used angel hair pasta, but it still turned out very well. I'd never had bok choy before, and found it to be surprisingly good along with the rest of the dish.

A very flavorful dish!  The oyster sauce and chicken broth meld together nicely to provide a base for the bok choy.  For the pork ingredient, I used some of a pork butt that I cooked yesterday.  The shrimp were added last and brought up to temperature.  I will be making this one again.  Lucky for me I have plenty of the necessaries on hand!

We love this recipe!  It is so easy and so tasty and the leftovers heat well the next day.  We used large shrimp rather than small shrimp (because that is what we had on hand) and it was delicious.

Thanks for a great recipe.  Loved the flavors.  Making this again next week.  I usually do not repeat a recipe more than once a month, but this was requested again right away.

This is  very good recipe, similar to the one my family eats, expect we always add carrots and snap peas. I've read through the reviews and just wanted to make a couple comments. First, my Dad's family is from the Philippines and our pancit has always had oyster sauce in it. Also, if you are going to serve the meat ect with rice don't call it pancit....pancit literally means noodles.

My family had mixed reviews on this one.  We all agree that the meat topping was fantastic.  The kids loved the rice noodles.  My husband and I did not care for the noodles.  The taste and texture really took away from the dish.  My husband wants me to make it again, but try it with some Jasmine rice instead.

Never had anything like this but the recipe just sounded interesting. We loved it! I used chicken instead of pork & used the chicken broth from boiling the chicken. Also used soy sauce because I'm not sure what oyster sauce is. Will make again.

This was just excellent and such a great change from the usual for this Ukrainian/Polish household.  I did change a few things - chicken for pork, sliced gingerroot instead of ground and I sliced the bok choy thinly instead of shredding (stalks got watery). I also followed the instructions for the noodles on the package instead of this recipe and they were perfect.  Thanks!

This recipe was good!  I used fettuccini noodles instead of the rice noodles, and cabbage instead of the bok choy.  It was very filling.  The scents filled the entire house, I can still smell them this morning!  Thanks!

Wow! Pancit is an excellent fit into our diet.  Bok choy, the small white stem kind, is often found in our fridge.  We thin sliced it.   I need to be gluten free so rice noodles, Asian sauces, and spices are common items in our pantry.  We found the sauce to be perfectly balanced as listed. We doubled it like most everyone else.  We thought the stir fry and set aside on the noodles a good idea and will try it out on several other recipes.  We have found rice noodle cooking time can vary so checking after 10 minutes steep could save you from a sticky mess. Meat and veggies will reflect stock on hand in the future, but pork and shrimp was excellent.  Pancit dishes will easily become a two or three times a month meal at our house.  Wow!

This is a fantastic recipe for pancit. I have been using it for about 4 years now. The oyster sauce gives it a really nice flavor, and this dish tastes just like my favorite rice noodle dish at the local Asian buffet. I have tried the pancit recipes that just use soy sauce when I had run out of oyster sauce and they are not good at all, not even close to restaurant quality as this one is.  I have fed this to a well-rounded group from rural Texan and Los Angeles Californian to Korean and it apparently appeals to popular taste. Regarding comments on whether its authentic, no two people cook exactly alike even if they are from the same country, and who cares anyway! It tastes good!

Of course, I had to modify somewhat based on my cupboard contents. I soaked 2x the rice noodles and drained them. I used green cabbage, cubed pork and onions with chopped garlic and some ginger paste. To the other ingredients I added Pad Thai sauce paste and some water so I would have enough sauce, then tasted all the ingredients mixed together and added soy sauce, a little Hoisin sauce and then about a cup of cashews. Tasted great.

Wonderful! I have never used rice noodles, so I did not know which ones to buy. I got the very thin ones, similar in diameter to angel hair pasta. After soaking them they turned into a gummy mess while cooking. I thought dinner was ruined, but I put them in a casserole dish and proceeded with the recipe anyway. I did add snow peas and matchstick carrots, and I doubled the oyster sauce and broth. Despite the noodle problem, this was absolutely delicious! My husband had 3 servings. THREE! I will be making this again for sure. Thank you for the recipe!!

i loved this!  i'm just getting interested in cooking and this is a really easy, but not ordinary, dish to make.  i did something wrong with the noodles though, because they were way under cooked.  i soaked them in cool, not warm water and i think the pan i sautéed them in was too small. so other than operator error, this was a home run!

Easy pancit recipe! Definitely add some snow peas and carrots. I also added fresh cilantro and ginger, a little sesame oil and a little rice wine vinegar to round out the flavors. Yum!

My new favorite dish~ I 've made it 3 times this week and each time a little different. Although I have yet to try it with the oyster sauce, I am in love with the freshness and the something different that this recipe brings to our table. I also have never used bok choy before and have found a new favorite veggie! Thanks for a simple and wonderful tasting recipe!!!!

I decided to make this dish without the shrimp and pork because hubby and I are trying to be vegetarians, and I have seen this dish made without any meat, so I cooked it like that.  The recipe so good that you don't even miss the meat at all.  I also have rice and egg noodles so i combined both noodles.  Serve it with lemon on the side.  Yum!

This is my first time cooking Filipino and WOW, was it ever delicious!!  And healthy too!  I didn't have any pork so I just made mine with shrimp.  I loved the subtleness of the oyster sauce - - such a nice change from your typical soy sauce flavoring.  The red pepper flakes gave it just a hint of spiciness which was perfect!  This one is going to be on our table again and again.  Thanks, Rayna!

My family loved this recipe, will make often.  I left out the oyster sauce because of allergies to ingredients and added soya sauce and a little more chicken base. I substituted bok choy for chinese cabbage, and left out the red pepper flakes. It's a keeper.

Very bland.  We are big eaters of Phillipino food and this doesn't even compare to what we have eaten.  I had to add soy sauce at the end because it didn't taste like anything, even with the soy sauce it wasn't very good.  Sorry!

I made this recipe for the second time last night and it came out better than the first. My whole family loved it including my picky eaters. I added 3 tbs. soy sauce and 2 tbs worcestershire sauce. I also add a few more tps. of ginger. I didn't have any redpepper flakes so I used cayenne and lemon pepper. Thanks for this recipe! It's one of my family's favorites!

All 5 in the family loved this.  I used regular cabbage since the local grocer's bok choy didn't look so great.  We all added soy sauce to our own individual serving...so I might add some as I cook it the next time.  It is a definite keeper.  Thanks!

Very flavorful and attractive dish.  I added pea pods as another user suggested - good tip. I also reserved the pepper flakes and let everyone add their own at the table if they wanted. I shared this recipe with everyone & will make it again.

Quick, easy and delicious - three of my favorites! I used chicken and shrimp (don't care for pork) and doubled the chicken broth. Just enough sauce to make everything nice and juicy. I subbed angel hair instead of rice noodles and a small head of napa instead of bok choy (or are they the same?)and it cooked down nicely. My friend loved it, and so did I! Maybe toss in a handful of cashews next time and as another reader suggested, carrots and snow peas? YUM!

My former sister in law is Filipino and has made this for the family several times. I don't have her recipe but liked the dish so was glad when I found this one. It is a lot like the "original" but lacks a little in flavor. Next time I will use fresh shrimp and work on making a more flavorful sauce. Overall it was good and we will definitely make it again. I did take others advice and added carrots and snap peas.

I really did not like this dish.  The flavor of the pork/shrimp mixture was good, but got lost in the MOUND of rice noodles.  If I ever attempted this recipe again I would use less noodles and more sauce.  I also noticed a lot of people saying they used rice vermicelli, they are thicker than the rice noodles I found and they may do a better job at highlighting the flavor of the rest of the dish.

I followed this recipe to a T and was not a fan. The rice noodles were too hard, the sauce just "eh", the pork and shrimp needed something else. Just not enough flavor overall.

This was wonderful, and so easy to modify to your own preference. This would be great with any leftover meat you may have in your fridge. I did use the suggestion of snow peas and carrots ans added bean sprouts, also mixed the bok choy and cabbage at 50/50. Just a great meal that has entered my list of regulars. Thank you for sharing.

Great recipe!  Everyone in my family loved this delicious meal.  I used beef instead of the pork and and also added steamed broccoli, steamed carrots, snow peas and baby bok choy.  I think I would make a bit more of the sauce next time.  Yum!  Thanks!

Quick and easy.  I had no shrimp and had to sub fish sauce for oyster sauce but it was delicious.  I also added carrots and think a squish of lime would have been nice to finish.  I added a little soy sauce at the table.

Definitely use oyster sauce.  I had fish sauce on hand and used that instead, being clueless about the differences.  It was still good, very good in fact, but it really needed the umami that the oyster sauce would have provided...

So yummy! great directions. I added finely chopped carrot and it gave great color and flavor. My Grandma, who ate this dish often while in the Phillipines really enjoyed it. she told me some of the memories it brought back. The added kick at the end of pepper flakes is what pulled together all the flavors for me.

My family all thought this was okay.  My husband and son did NOT like the rice noodles and only ate the "topping".  My daughter and I liked the rice noodles but thought the "topping" was okay, not a whole lot of flavor in my opinion.  I may make this again but serve it over rice with some additional spices.

After re-reading the reviews I think maybe i just don't "get" this recipe. I made it exactly as the recipe said, measuring everything, and it had absolutely no taste.  This was the least interesting, least flavorful dish I think I have ever had.  I've never tried Filipino food before, so maybe i just don't get it, but all I could taste was plain noodles, plain shrimp, plain pork, no seasoning at all. I felt like it was just a stir fry with no sauce.  What was the 'pancit' part that makes it ethnic?  Like I said, just don't get it and threw the recipe away.

First of all I made Chicken and Shrimp Pancit.  it came out great.  this recipe took me all of about 20 minutes to make from start to finish.  very nice on a work night.  one other thing i changed is when i cooked the noodles in the oil i used about 1 TBS of canola oil and 1 tsp sesame oil. i forgot to add the red pepper and that was just what it was lacking ~ my error, recipe is great though

it is always fun to try something a little out of the ordinary for me.  this dish is great.  the rice noodles make for an authentic asian dish.  i added a little beef and thickened the sauce with some cornstarch.

My family loves pancit, and this was my first attempt at making it.  I had boneless raw pork chops, so I sautéed cubes in sesame oil, adding a little oyster sauce when almost cooked through.  I used thinly sliced and/or shredded green cabbage and purple cabbage in lieu of bok choy.  For the ginger, I used minced from the jar.  I had regular-sized shrimp, so I cut them in thirds or fourths.  I will definitely be making this again!

A friend made Pancit for me recently and I wanted to try it myself.  I used carrot, cabbage, celery, and garlic. Wok-fried some beef. Soaked the rice noodles in chicken broth.  My husband loved it.  This is a keeper.

I didn't have shrimp, so I added red cabbage instead which gave it great color. I thought this dish was absolutely delicious, but my "food is food," non-picky husband didn't like it, so I have to dock it a star. The pork is what makes this yummy and gives it a great flavor, in my opinion. 

This was also my first experience with bok choy, an ingredient I was afraid of because I normally despise wilted lettuce; but, like spinach, this leafy green veggie tastes great cooked! And, surprisingly, so does red cabbage.

Thank you for the recipe, I'm saving this for nights where I can have it all to myself.

Good recipe but I thought it needed more of a "kick" so we added some chili garlic paste on our plates. Thought lemon grass would also work well. I don't know if those 2 ingredients would be used in Philippine cuisine, buying think they would make the dish even better. I was okay with the texture of the noodles but my husband thought they were too mushy. Next time we might try less soaking and more sautéing to get a crunchier or firmer texture. Still an enjoyable meal as is!

I added shrimp pork and chicken that i bolied to get the stock that was needed for the dish.  The only thing I would not do is to put the noodles in oil before hanf I cut them into four pieces and let them soak in water while I prepare everything else then at the end just added them and they came out great because of the steam and just tossed them through!!!  This is a keeper!!!

This was pretty good and very simple to make. We grilled our pork chops before dicing them in with the shrimp, and I added some fresh snow peas and a handful of sliced carrots. 2nd Day leftovers were fantastic. It was our first experience, too, with rice noodles and seemed to like them fairly well.

Wow this is SO good!  My kids, ages 4, 6, and 7, loved it.  The five of us were fighting to see who would get the last of it.  LOL.  I used super thinly sliced carrots (so they cooked quickly), regular cabbage (what we had), some chopped spinach, and powdered red pepper (what we had).  We didn't have any rice noodles so I used rice.  Amazingly good.   Can't wait to try it with noodles!

I just returned from the Philippines visiting my husband's family. I am an American learning to cook filipino! This dish was excellent tasting and thumbs up by my filipino husband. I made two slight changes; when mixing the vegetables at the end I also added 1/4 cup of soy sauce. This gave the pancit a little more tang. I  also added a few diced carrots; I used frozen carrots; giving the dish a little more contrast in color. And, I used 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper instead of the pepper flakes; only because I didn't have pepper flakes so I substituted the cayenne pepper. My husband loved this dish!

Didn't have oyster sauce so just added lots of soy sauce.  Also added some shredded cabbage and grated carrots and I used green cabbage instead of bok choy.  Also had no chicken so did all shrimp.  My husband stirred some peanut butter into his bowl and added some peanuts on the top.  Excellent recipe!  Thanks!

This dish was very tasty. I used shrimp and chicken because I didn't have pork on hand, and substitued shredded cabbage for the bok choy per someone else's suggestion. Also, I found rice vermicelli but not rice noodles. I think next time I will follow the package directions instead of soaking them in warm water. They clumped together when I tried to saute them in my wok. I love the delicate flavor the ginger and oyster sauce but will probably up the crushed red pepper for a little more kick. The green onion added another dimension of flavor. Quick and easy.

This was a great recipe.  Instead of the bok choy I used a packaged coleslaw mix which gave it some extra color.  I also eliminated the pork because I was serving this with lemon chicken.

Love this recipe :-) I double the sauce and add diced red & green peppers. I only use a fraction of the oil (maybe 1 tsp.), and I don't saute the noodles.

This was DEEEELICIOUS!! Oyster sauce is KEY here. My noodles in bold print said DO NOT SOAK. So make sure you read package. I recommend adding julienned or grated carrot. I will definitely use this pancit recipe for now on. This is the best one i have come across so far.

I used chicken instead of pork for this recipe and substitued clam juice for the oyster juice and we really enjoyed it.  I didn't have any rice noodles so we served it on No Yolks slim noodles.  I will definately be making this again.

This is a hard one to rate...  I absolutely loved it (would have given it a 5) - my husband took one bite and refused to eat more (he rated it a 1).  I think you have to have the right palate for this dish.  Very easy to make, but will probably not make again for my husband's sake.

Turned out perfect! My very first time cooking this cuisine and it was so yummy! I had to leave out the red pepper flakes for my husband’s sake, but it was still excellent! So easy and so flavourful. Definitely a keeper to make again.

Very good, awesome flavor and great authentic dish overall. Maybe some more sauce would help, a little dry

I made the recipe as is and my noodles were too firm.  To fix this I just added more chicken broth to the pot and simmered until the noodles softened.  Since I had to add additional liquid, I also added some shredded carrots and it turned out perfect.  In the future, I will cook my noodles more.

Used Canton Noodles, quartered hard soft boiled eggs, celery, julienned carrots, and Chinese Sausage. This is always excellent with Bak Choy, however using cabbage is just as good. Lime or lemon squeezed on top compliments the Pancit well!

First time making it and as everyone is saying, its very easy to make.  I added a little of low sodium soy sauce just because I usually like my food with some salt but it came out delicious.

It was just okay. I thought it lacked flavor. If I make it again, I'll use more oyster sauce, garlic, ginger and maybe use some fresh lime juice to give it some zing!

Consistently delicious.  

We reside ina city where about 25 percent of our population is Filipino.  

I finally found a recipe that my Anglo Celtic background can follow and be proud of serving.  I needed the step by step instructions and ingredient list.  

Good to offer sauces on the side so people can make it spicier, EG. Jufran banana sauce

One of the few recipes I could follow proportionally as is. I did not have bok choy and it was still excellent. I would also recommend using freshly chopped or grated garlic and ginger. I think that really added to the flavor. I also substituted for ground pork instead of chopped pork for money sake. It allowed for protein in every bite! I also tend to add either green or red peppers to everything which also added flavor.

Absolutely delicious! I omitted oyster sauce & used fish sauce instead & Seasoned my meat with Ty Ling Five Spice Seasoning.
