this was good even though i completely switched some things around. i didnt use any spices and i just combined the macaroni and some sour cream along with some sharp cheddar (didnt have any processed cheese) and it came out really gooey and good!

I'm rating this based on time and ease to prepare.  It's almost as good as my baked recipe that takes 4 times as long.  I didn't have an onion and my kids are big on onion anyway, so I used onion powder instead to give it some flavor.  My 3 kids and husband ate it up!

This tasted way too much like the processed cheese.  Too much cheese that overpowered the whole dish.  I will not make again.

If I said that I much preferred a much more involved macaroni and cheese that required making a white sauce, adding a variety of cheeses, spices, herbs, or other add-ins or seasonings, topping it with crispy, buttery bread crumbs, and/or baking it… I’d be lying.  This is delicious, plain and simple.  I prepared it on the stove-top which for me was no more difficult than nuking it.  I also added some King Arthur’s Vermont Cheddar Cheese Powder (good stuff, by the way). This is creamy, smooth, rich, cheesy, and delicious.  I don’t know how choosing a more complicated recipe could make it any better than that.

Simple but not enough cheese.  The edges were dry and crispy.  Modifications needed.

I loved the creamy texture! I added lima beans for color and extra value. I had frozen chopped onions instead of fresh. Very easy. Looks like I worked a lot harder!

This was really good. I liked how it was simple and quick. I added cooked chopped broccoli to mine and a little garlic salt. I'll be making this again with chicken.

I was looking for a quick and easy way to make mac and cheese with what I had on hand, and I was very surprised at how good this turned out. I used shredded cheddar because I did not have any processed cheese. I'd recommend using real cheese if possible, to avoid the 'boxed' taste some people mentioned. The onions made this taste close to traditional oven baked mac and cheese.   The second time I made this I added some minced garlic with the onions to saute and added a scoop of sour cream at the end, which made it very creamy and good!

I used Penne pasta, onion powder and cooked it on the stove instead of the microwave.  It was basically dump and cook!  Then I baked it for eight minutes.  YUM!  This will probably become a regular dish in our house. :)

I think the recipe shouldn't use processed cheese... I only used half the amount of processed and no one like it... Ill stick with normal cheese next time.

This is a good recipe that was right on time and saved the day. I did not use the onions and nor did I have processed cheese.  I used sliced cheddar cheese.  I had a casserole dish that was slightly smaller than recipe stated so the milk seemed to stick around and not mold, so I added a tablespoon of flour at 2+minutes to cooking time left and it was perfectly done. I let it stand for about 15 minutes and it was even better. The taste was just right and the texture  was too.

I have actually made this for years using Velveeta cheese.  In a saucepan slowly cook milk, butter and cheese over low to medium heat till cheese melts. (Just make sure milk covers the  butter and cheese in the saucepan) Set aside.  Boil elbow noodles till aldente.  Chop up one can of Spam into small chunks.  Add all ingredients into casserole pan.  Cook at 325°F  till just bubbles.  Kids love this recipe.   Great for leftovers too.

There are only two of us, so the second time I made it I cut the recipe in half, it was still excellent, use 1/2 lb of macaroni, changing the portion requirements only calls for 1/4 lb, to much sauce to little pasta.

My 8-year-old daughter loved this. I, however, did not care for the taste of the processed cheese. It was a thick and creamy cheesy macaroni, but it was not the recipe I was hoping for.

I tried it.  
Make certain to use the recommended size baking dish.  Mine boiled over in microwave.  Created quite a mess for myself.  I used 1.5 qt. dish.  Cannot attest to taste, since a lot of the mixture got wasted boiling over........
