This recipe is great and because I was looking for a flavor that had some barbeque undertones, I took the suggestion of adding barbeque.  After I shredded the pork, I took the juice that it cooked in, placed it in a pot and added one large bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's Original.  I must say that I made 25lbs of pork for a party and that was why I used the large bottle.  You can adjust your recipe by taste.  It was just enough to add the barbeque flavor to the delicious cooking juices.

Yeah so this was an awesome marinade.  I cooked fora bout 13 hours total, mainly because I was working the day it slow cooked.  I got home, added the onion (only 1/2 as a whole seemed over powering) and then added a half bottle of sweet baby rays.  

When I make them again, I'll add a bit more red pepper but everything else was on point.

A perfect balance of sweet and salty flavors, topped with the smoothness of the BBQ sauce and the kick of the pepper, and can be added to rolls, crackers, or just eaten alone. Well worth the long cook time, for relatively little effort. Great recipe!

I used a 4lb picnic roast.  Didn't have time for the overnight marinate so I just used the recipe to cook the pork in the slow cooker on low for 8 hours.  Added Sweet Baby Rays after shredding/removing fat and it was a hit!!  Great with dill pickle slices.  Will surely make again!

I just used this recipe for my first attempt at pulled pork (shoulder blade cut) and the end result was beyond beautiful! So pleased with myself (and this recipe) right now!! I was actually sad to sauce it as it was so lovely and tasty as is - but it is destined for a potluck so will stay traditional with a Wicker's BBQ sauce -  this time anyways!

I actually didn't have time to marinate, so I just mixed up the marinade and threw it in my slow cooker. I also used 3 lbs of boneless pork rib meat. I cooked it on high for about 6 hours, shredded it, removed about 8 oz of juice.  I added half a (small)bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's Original Barbecue Sauce. It was amazing!!

Wow!  I live in Western NC, so I rarely feel a desire to compete with all the awesome BBQ places around here.  But I wanted to eat in for Mothers Day weekend to avoid the crowds--(just brunch me in the face!).  This pulled pork was pretty  tasty even before I added about half a cup of Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory and Brown Sugar sauce!  The only thing I did differently, was to add a tablespoon of liquid smoke as suggested by other reviewers.  I served it with toasted rolls, corn on the cob, and the apple butter baked beans recipe also from this site.  No leftovers!  Try it!  You'll like it!  Promise!

This is a good easy recipe.I used Abita Purple haze beer(though Shiner would great)  and Webers horseradish mustard as I didn't have plain yellow.Otherwise followed the recipe except 8.5 hours because meat was lighter.We served it on crisped up soft tortilla shells with a squirt of Ironworks bbq sauce and candied jalape√±os.My husband thought it was fantastic .No leftovers!We don't eat meat often but this recipe will made again.Thanks for sharing!

Loved this recipe. New to using slow cooker and preparing pork picnic roast. Marinade was tangy and tasty. Will make again.

Amazing - dont let the smell/ingredients make you think different.  I made substitutes only because we were out of beer and honey.  I used a diet pepsi and white caro syrup.  I let it marinate over night (9hrs) then put all the marinade and pork into a pan, added water to cover the pork then put it in the oven for 2hrs on 350 then lowered it to 250 for 4 hours and its done.  This marinade smells nasty - (before cooking it) but it tastes amazing (and smells good once in the oven :))
