I thought this was a great recipe for gorgonzola sauce. It was a bit runny, but it had really good flavor. I increased both the cheeses. I also browned some chicken peices in garlic with olive oil and added that to the finished sauce with a bit of broccoli. Then I served it over penne pasta. Yum!

I made this sauce to put over pasta, and it was quite delicious!!  Instead of nutmeg, I added some pesto, and it gave it more of an Italian flavor.  Very good!

This was very good.  It was light, not overpowering like some gorgonzola sauces.  I used half-and-half and it came out fine.

Oh, my....Yum!!! There is a restaurant in Portland that used to serve "Capellini & Gorganzola", this is the closest Gorganzola sauce I have found to duplicate the recipe. It must be the nutmeg! Make sure you really reduce the sauce after both the wine and cream...it produces a much thicker sauce. Yum!! Thank you!!

I made this sauce and served it with penne pasta and my husband said that it was the best pasta I had ever made for him. Well, we have been married almost 35 years and I have cooked a lot of very good pasta dishes so that was a huge compliment. I liked it too! I pretty much followed the recipe except I might have used a little more gorgonzola than specified.
REVISED 3/19/2011:
I have now made this sauce 3 times. The secret, I believe, is the quality of the ingredients. Don't expect great results if using gorgonzola that is purchased already crumbled. Trust me; it makes a difference. Also, be sure to reduce the wine as directed. Otherwise, sauce may be runny or curdled and the taste of wine may be overpowering.

Really nice and the nutmeg adds that finishing touch.  Won't use parm next time though...just to gorgonzola was good enough.

Added garlic and chicken.  Used less wine and less cream.  Added a little corn starch to thicken the sauce and served with gnocchi.  Very good.

Eh.  I guess it's an acquired taste.  My little cousin said it "smelled like toe jam, and tasted worse".  I thought it was OK, not as good as a recipe at a local Italian restaurant, but OK.  I don't think I'll make it again, because there are so many recipes for pasta sauces.  It may stand to improve by adding some sun-dried tomatoes to kick it up a notch.  That's just my suggestion.

It was OK. As someone else mentioned, it did taste a little sour. I think I would use more permesan cheese and less gorgonzola next time. It could become a great sauce if you tweak a little.

This sauce was excellent!  Rich but not overwhelming.  I served the sauce over sauteed chicken breasts since our family is on Atkins and it was so good!  It would be incredible over pasta - someday.

I slightly modified this recipe and ended up with a restaurant-quality meal! I found the recipe because I was trying to find something I could make that would use the gorgonzola/cranberry/walnut cheese mold I recently bought at Trader Joe's (which was not so good on its own).  I fried up some onions and garlic in olive oil, set that aside and grilled up some chicken breast.  Then, setting aside the chicken but leaving the scraps in the pan, I reduced the wine (using a sweet Moscato wine) and then used 1% milk instead of cream and 5 ounces of the gorgonzola dip (but no parmesan). Also added a few ounces of goats cheese. The nutmeg definitely seals this sauce.  Once the flavors were blended, I mixed in the cooked onions and the chicken. Then stirred in cooked quinoa linguine and some lightly steamed broccoli before serving.  Delicious!!!

Pretty good base for a sauce. I liked the amount of gorgonzola it called for. I recduced the wine to 1 cuo and I thought it was still a bit much. Next time I will add more cream, less butter and some butter! Yum! Thanks for sharing.

SO good, but it does benefit greatly from a clove or 2 of crushed garlic in it. Great over veggies or polenta or grains too.

I think the idea of this recipe is great and for the most part it was delicious.  I just messed it up somehow and the cream curdled in the wine creating a weird texture.  But next time I'm sure it will be great!

This is our "go to" recipe for gorgonzola sauce.  I always add sliced mushrooms during the wine reduction, and is excellent over grilled steak.  For a reduced fat version, I use Fat Free evaporated milk (excellent replacement for cream in most recipes).  It adds a little bit of sweetness to the flavor, but we compensate with a little extra gorgonzola :)

Very easy to prepare, and I am not that careful with my measurements.  If you substitute with milk/cornstarch for the cream, you might want the milk at room temp to keep it from coagulating when you add it to the wine.

My boyfriend and I absolutely LOVE this sauce! I cook a blackened steak and slice it over bow tie pasta and this sauce makes it the best meaty pasta ever. Making it is super easy and I highly recommend trying it!

This sauce goes great with wings (with or w/o hot sauce). A thicker sauce is recommended if you are going to serve it with wings.

Made this low-fat by using evaporated skim milk and cornstarch as another reviewer suggested.  Added some roasted garlic too.  I used this sauce as a base on grilled chicken and spinach pizza.  It was delicious!!

I can't believe this is only 4 stars today.  This is the best gorgonzola sauce recipe I have tried.  This sauce is similar to one I had in Florence, Italy where it was served with gnocchi pasta.  That is the way, I serve it.

I added 1 shallot and 3 cloves of minced garlic, sauteed in butter, then followed the recipe.  At the end, I added 2 cooked, sliced chicken breast.  Poured over cooked penne pasta.  This was a little runny and I will thicken next time.  I will also add more garlic and possibly mushrooms.  Everyone loved it!  Very good!

I guess I should have researched what gorgonzola cheese was before I made this dish. My boyfriend and I couldn't eat the sause because it was way too sour! I like some blue cheeses but I must not like this one.

This was excellent.  I had some left over gorgonzola from another recipe and this was a great way to use it up.  I added about 1/2 a bag of the tysons grilled chicken strips (heated and diced), 1/2 a box of pipette pasta, and peas and it was a great meal with some garlic bread and white wine.  Definately a keeper.

Using half and half, this recipe turned out awful. Perhaps I didn't reduce the sauce enough... Also, I think the hlaf and half also curdled upon being added to the boiling wine.

Great sauce. I used sweet white wine instead of dry because I like a slight sweetness with the nuttiness of the bleu cheese. I used about a half cup of fresh grated parmesan since I used a very fine shaving grater and I wanted to make sure I used enough and it was fantastic. Thanks for the recipe.

Really great base recipe for a gorgonzola sauce.  I would recommend adding some mushrooms sauteed in garlic and butter (and a pinch of salt) to get that dark nutty flavor and adding that to the sauce at the end.  I also added half a cup of cooked peas for some texture and fresh chopped parsley at the very end.  Really delicious, my boyfriend said it was the best thing he ever ate!

If I could give this recipe more then 5 stars I would.The only thing I change is I add about double the gorganzola. We then cook up penne pasta. Saute chicken , mushrooms, and garlic . Add everything together. VIOLA. This is my husbands all time favorite meal  and I love it too. I cannot understand why some reviewers do not like this recipe !

This is good but it needs some work, I added about three cloves of fresh minced garlic and I added about 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese also I scratched the idea of nutmeg, I served it over filet mignon and it was delicious!!!

I have made other gorgonzola/blue cheese sauces that we really enjoyed, so this was a big disappointment to us.  The wine flavor was too strong and the sauce was bitter.

This was tasty, but I must not have cooked it down enough - it was pretty thin.  Next time, I'll try to either cook it down more or use a little cornstarch or flour to thicken it more.

Simple and tasty like all great pasta sauces.  I used a Maytag blue cheese as well.  This works great with chicken sauteed in garlic.  Just add them all together at the very end and mix with pasta.  Good recipe.

I liked the sauce, but altered the recepie completely and came up with something amazing. 
Use the recepie as usual, but instead of cream use oatcream and use the brown Norwegian cheese Gjetöst instead and add more salt to tasty. It work perfectly! It's sweet, little sour, caramel-tasting, rich but not as overwhelming as gorgonzola. Perfect with gnocchi!

was pretty runny, but that may be my fault.  just be cautious when letting the wine and cream reduce.  i added roasted asparagus, a spoon full of pesto, and one chopped roasted red pepper.  flavor was wonderful.  will make again with a few adjustments.  thanks!

Excellent!! I saved this with two other gorgonzola sauce recipes, they have since been deleted! This is my winner!! I reduce the nutmeg most of the time but only because I use it with bacon wrapped chicken. Hardest part was trying to guess on what wine to use from suggestions -=D

Very creamy and not overpowering. It tastes like the sauce from one of my favorite restaurants. I poured it over rigatoni and also over poached salmon. Both dishes were awesome!

I fixed this two weeks after having it at a wonderful Italian
restaurant in Las Vegas!   I made it exactly as written.  It
didn't come close to what I was hoping for!  Oh well!  I'll keep searching for a recipe.  I will not make this again.

I added cooked shrimp, substituted salt-free lemon pepper for salt and pepper.  Next time I make it with raw shrimp for the extra flavor but it may not surpass this.  My wife, who dislikes (hates?) blue cheese loved this.  It reminded her of a similar dish she surprisingly loved in Aruba at the "Flying Fishbone" -  go there if you can -  but she attributed her love of it to the atmosphere there.  Whoda thunk.

Since our rather conservative (when it comes to trying "new" food) two teenagers were not home last night, I decided to let our taste buds have a treat and was  drawn to this recipe.  WOW!!!!  I made it exactly as printed, although next time I will probably add more gorgonzola (personal preference).  My husband and I INHALED it.  Thanks so much for submitting such a fantastic recipe!

I only used 1/2c wine and replaced the cream with half and half.  I absolutely LOVE the distinct taste and flavor that gorgonzola offers!
I enjoy serving this sauce over breaded pork cutlets with poached pears.

Really, really tasty.  Make sure you reduce the sauce enough (and maybe let it cool for a couple minutes to thicken more) or else it will be a little runny.

This has become called " the sauce " in my household . I always double the recipe and use half heavy cream and half buttermilk . We use it both over noodles and as an appetizer served in a crock pot with cut of French bread on the side .

I was looking for a base for my first cheese sauce and found this. I served it over lemon-pepper swordfish and linguine.  

I used basil instead of nutmeg and a few different types of parmesan instead of gorgonzola.  I started the swordfish too soon and ended up not having the time necessary to allow the sauce to reduce enough.  I compensated by adding extra cheese.  It turned out pretty good, but a little bit too cheesy.    

I think this is a pretty good base.  From my experience, the quality of this sauce will rely on the quality of the cheese.
