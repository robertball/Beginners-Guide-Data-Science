This soup was delicious. I used a chicken-based chorizo sausage to reduce the amount of fat.

This soup was really tasty and easy to make!  I scaled the recipe to 4 servings and found that using only 1-1/2 cups of water wasn't near enough so I increased the amount of water to 3-1/2 cups and it was still a pretty thick soup.  I will definitely be making this again.

I made this soup for my family as a spur of the moment change of pace and they LOVED it!  We halved the cayenne pepper to make it more mild and found that this is a dish we'll be eating often in the future. Thank you Sara!

I'd really like to give this a three and a half stars; my husband really liked it, I sort of liked it. It brought to mind my grandfather's habit of putting ketchup in his chicken soup. Why he would do that? I don't know. Anyway, it's a change of pace soup; something different with the beans, definitely spicy, and easy to fix.

This is a great soup. I also added 4-5 cloves of garlic, 2 large red chillis, and coriander stirred in close to the end (and to garnish). Served with crusty french bread! Went down a treat with all my friends :-)

I didn't put the whole cayenne pepper because we are not huge fans of very spicy food, but it was a very nice meal. You really can't go wrong with the chorizo sausage :) I thought the cooking time was too short, so I simmered it for half hour. I also used 5 potatoes and a whole pound of sausage and halved the cayenne.

Great flavor, but WAY too much heat! I used less than a tablespoon of cayenne, and we still had to tame it down with some sour cream. I'll happily make this again, but...live and learn.

I think 1 1/2 Tbsp cayenne pepper must have been a mistake in the original recipe. I recommend possibly 2 tsp. I also added more kidney beans and kale.

Delicious!! I was very pleasantly surprised- I wasn't expecting such full on flavour, at least more than just spicy, but it was very flavourful. The spice was not overpowering. I did change the recipe slightly to fit what I had on hand- I did not add celery, and the spice I used was a paprika/cayenne mix. I also added crushed chilies. I cooked the chorizo on a grill pan which added a nice 'grilled' smokey flavour. Was not an expensive meal either, and easy to make, so this will become part of my normal rotation!

I used this as a starting off point for what I had on hand, and it was excellent.  Didn't have carrots or tomato paste. used only 1 stalk celery.   Substituted the tomatoes for a can of tomatoes, white cannelini beans instead of kidney and also threw in box of frozen spinach the last few minutes.   served with crusty bread. Tasted good right away, but was even better later.  Hubby liked also since it was full of flavor and very  filling. great recipe to adjust.  I think it would be good with spicy italian sausage also.  Thanks for the recipe!
