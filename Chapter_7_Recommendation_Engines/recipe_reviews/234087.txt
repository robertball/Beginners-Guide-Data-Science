I've made this recipe often, and it is very yummy as written. I took the advise of another reviewer and added 1/4 cup of sugar. I also decreased the buttermilk to 2 1/2 cups. With the full 3 cups they were thin like crepes. Less milk = thick fluffy pancakes.

I liked it without any changes. My kiiiids on the other hand required some modifications. I added .5 c of sugar and used 1 cup of wheat flour and one cup of white. I plan on reducing these modifications slowly. Great recipe! Thanks!

I added a tsp of vanilla, and a tbsp of cinnamon to sweeten it a little. I am not much of a syrup person, but I throughly enjoyed this recipe with syrup. I also tried a little vanilla Dannon Greek yogurt as a topping, and that was also very tasty. Will definitely make again, but will cut the recipe in half. This  made  15, 4 in pancakes

I usually regard pancakes as a vehicle for syrup; but this recipe has given a new point of view. I can't remember when I've tasted better. Since we have little use for buttermilk, it's not in our house. Alternative:  Mix 1 tbsp of lemon juice  per cup of milk, let it rest for 5+ minutes.
An added plus;  no costly, exotic rarely used ingredients!

Fantastic texture. Light and delicious. I made these last Sunday and they were a home run. The wheat germ I used was already toasted so it was just dump and stir. This will be my "go to" for pancakes. No more mix!

Delicious! I added some sugar (my sweet tooth demands it!) and some vanilla.  Not “healthy” by the time I slather the pancakes with butter and smother them with syrup.  Yes, I will definitely make again.  I have a jar of wheat germ I need to use up!

This is a very good basic pancake recipe.  I didn't have any wheat germ, so I processed 1/2 cup large flake oats to a coarse meal and added it along with 1/4 cup ground flaxseed and 1/4 cup sugar.  I also reduced the buttermilk to 2 1'2 cups.
Next time I make this recipe again, and I will for sure make it again, I will try 1 whole cup processed oats.

Excellent. Will definitely be my go to recipe for whole wheat pancakes. My wife and I look forward to trying some of the add in modifiers people have suggested.

The best whole wheat pancakes! I used soft white wheat I ground myself and omitted the wheat germ. You cannot tell they are whole wheat! Simple, good and almost no fat.

I made it exactly as directed and it was delicious. It wasn't heavy neither. As some reviewers said before we can easily bring our own touch, such as adding cinnamon, berries, sugar, etc. A+

Great recipe. I usually add some mashed fruit or cinnamon, ginger, vanilla, etc. Love not having to buy pancake mix anymore! Very healthy and satisfying.
