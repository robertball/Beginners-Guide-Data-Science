This is a perfect recipe for anyone wanting to avoid spiciness and still enjoy a sloppy joe!  I followed the recipe exactly, weighing the ketchup which amounted to 3/4 cup.  This is truly "simple, quick, and tasty" as stated in the introduction.  Thank you RetiredDad9877 for sharing!!

This is the best one!  Now that I've found this perfect recipe, I've filed it away and won't try any new ones  Why mess with perfection?  Just a little sweet and very savory.  Worked great for sloppy joes, or as a sauce over smokies.  I add 2 tbsp. bbq sauce of our liking.  Definitely worth trying!

It was really delicious!  My 14-year old ate THREE Sloppy Joes, my husband ate one open-faced Sloppy Joe (which is probably the equivalent of TWO) and I ate one.  The only complaint that my husband had was that they were a bit dry.  Next time, I think I will add a 5-ounce can of tomato sauce and increase the amount of spices so that the flavor isn't diluted.

I've tried several sloppy joe recipes and this was by far the best.  I will definitely make it again.  It was easy, used ingredients I keep on pleased the whole family.  I buy hamburger in bulk, pre brown it and freeze it in 1 or 2 lb packages.  I simply microwaved the pre-cooked meat, cooked the onion and celery, stirred it all together and warmed it through.  Definitely making this again.

We liked this recipe. I accidentally messed up and added 2x the onion, celery, ketchup and sugar but it still turned out good. I thought it needed an extra kick, so I added a pinch of cayenne pepper. That made all the difference.

Simple. Traditional. Not too sweet or spicy. I like to substitute BBQ sauce for the ketchup and add a can of diced tomatoes.

I thought this was pretty good. I have another go to recipe, I like, that tastes a little more like traditional sloppy joes but decided to try a different one. I did use ground turkey, instead of burger, it was what I had. I saut√©ed the onion in a couple of spoons of vegetable oil and added about a 1/3 of finely minced green pepper. I noticed it was an ingredient in similar recipes. I also didn't have the celery. I felt like my sloppy joes were a little dry compared to the other recipe, I use, but wasn't sure if it was due to using the turkey or the amount of sauce. For seasonings I added a sprinkle of salt and pepper, garlic and onion powder, and of celery seasoning due to not having any celery. I also opted for a couple of tsp. of Dijon over the dry mustard, as I just don't care for the taste of the dry. After adding the sauce, I only had to heat the sloppy joes for about 10 minutes. It made for a quick meal this evening.

Made in the crock pot for a chilly, rainy day today, and it definitely is passing taste testing! I did have to sub the celery for celery seed (no celery in the fridge, but always have a full spice cabinet) and about a 1/4c up local honey for the brown sugar (again, lacking the brown sugar in the pantry as I dont usually use it), but it is wonderful. Will do again and again with items on hand, as this recipe seems very versatile. Very good and makes a great addition to our dinner menu rotation due to being so easy and simple, yet delicious and perfect as a comfort meal adaptable to the crock for our busy lives. Thank you!!

Being a Sloppy Joe Fan!!! Ive tried a number of recipes....and would like to suggest using Tomato based chili sauce ...instead of ketchup, or 1/2 and 1/2. I believe it makes a tastier Joe, and a bit more like the original recipe. Overall...very good.

Very well received by my hubby, who kept going on and on about how good it was.  I adjusted the recipe to make 3 servings, and that was just right for the two of us.  Didn't change anything else.  Will make these again and again.

These were delicious. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used Splenda brown sugar blend for the brown sugar, and I used Heinz lower sugar ketchup because we have a diabetic in the family. And it turned out great. In fact, I'm making them again this weekend.

I made two different types of sloppy joes so we could have a taste test.  This was my favorite of the two.  Just the right amount of sauce and onions, and for us, the celery was a nice addition.  Served it open faced with a baked potato.  Thanks RetiredDad9877, for sharing your recipe.

This really is an excellent 'sloppy joe' recipe.   When I was directing student council, we made this for the whole staff, and had several people asking for recipe.  I've always thought vinegar is a secret ingredient in good sloppy joes.  The only thing I did slightly different was chop the onion and celery in my Ninja so picky people wouldn't complain about big chunks of onion or celery.  I also think letting it sit overnight and reheating it makes it still better.

Made it for my niece and nephew.  They gave it 3.5 stars (I rounded up to 4).  It was definitely very mild, which was great for me niece.  I added Cholula to mine to give it a kick.  Worked great.  (I left out the onions and added extra celery since I don't cook with onions, and it was fine.  I think if I was cooking it for myself I would put in jalepenos instead of the onions).

This is a great recipe! I've used it several times (but I skip the celery).  I like the suggestion to use pickle juice instead of vinegar.  This Recipe is always a hit, even with the picky eaters.

Decent but rather ketchup-ey.  May I recommend replacing some of the ketchup with tomato paste (like half a Heinz small can)plus water for about 3 of the ounces of ketchup?  It would work wonders and the brown sugar would deal with any acidity issues.

Good, but ordinary, try substituting your favorite bottled barbeque sauce for added spice.

Such a yummy recipe!! I doubled the recipe for my family and another family that just had a baby.  Neither of us had any leftovers that's how good it is.  I'm not a big hamburger fan, so I used 1/2 ground beef & 1/2 ground turkey in my version. Thank you for sharing your great recipe!

The best sloppy joes we have ever made. Left the onions out for our young picky eater. Everyone loved them, including our picky eater. A little shocked it was that good. Thank you!

Very good! Though if it made it to the crockpot I would have added some tomato soup so it wouldn't dry out. It's a keeper!

This is one of our favorite Friday dinners.  Most of the time all ingredients are on hand it is super easy to make.  I serve this on hamburger buns with french fries as a side dish.

Made this last night for my weekly prayer group, and it was a success! Had enough left over for my husband and stepson, they loved it too. I did make a few changes. I did not really measure the ingredients, and added maybe a couple of tablespoons of tomato paste and added a can of diced tomatoes. I'm not too big on ketchup, so I might not have used the whole 10 ounces. Great recipe, though!!

I will definitely make this easy, super-tasty recipe again!  I was in a hurry and didn't realize the recipe called for 2 lbs. ground beef, as I usually use 1 lb. for our small family.  I ended up adding the amount of Worcestershire it called for, but decreased the vinegar and lemon juice, and it worked out great.!  As I usually use chili sauce along with ketchup, I halved the amount of ketchup and added the chili sauce for the other half.  I also added some sweet mini yellow peppers with the onion and ground beef as I had them on hand and didn't have any celery..  Such a quick and delicious recipe!

The texture is great but I have to admit I was disappointed with the overall flavor.  Strange, because the ingredients looked like they would be the perfect combo; unfortunately, we found them bland.  There is more flavor and spicing in a can of Manwich.  That being said, this is easy to remedy by upping your own spicing or simply leaving as is for persnickety kids!

This was awesome! The meat came out so savory and it was very easy to make--I used regular mustard instead of the powder and it was still really good.

Decreased the catsup by 2 ounces and added 2 ounces of Sweet Baby Rays honey BBQ sauce. Also added two tablespoons of chopped red bell pepper. 

Served it for my granddaughters 5th birthday party today. The entire family raved over it!  Definitely a keeper and will serve it again. Taking a couple of cans of that popular sloppy joe sauce to the food pantry.

Great spices! I too added a can of tomato sauce to make it 'sloppier' and increased the spices. I also added garlic powder and pepper then put it all into a crock pot on high for about three hours. The flavor was wonderful and the house smelled delicious. Everyone, even my pickiest child, ate and enjoyed this recipe. Thanks for a keeper!!

I was looking for a quick  and easy summertime lunch; this recipe was exactly what I wanted.  I'll never go back to canned Sloppy Joe sauce!  I followed the recipe as written, but ran into a slight glitch.  I didn't seem to have enough sauce for the meat, so I squirted in some barbecue sauce to help stretch it.  Overall, I was pleased with this recipe and will make it again.

We really liked the flavor of this recipe.  I followed what some other reviewers suggested:  added bell pepper and bar-b-q sauce.  I also agreed that it was dry as originally written.  I ended up with only 1 pound of hamburger and kept all the other original quantities of ingredients. The sauce was thick already so only needed to heat it through.  Great on toasted hamburger buns!

I made this last night, it's a good basic recipe. I used 85/15 ground beef and added 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp black pepper, 1 tsp dried dill weed and upped the vinegar from 1 tsp to 1 Tb. We'll have it again for dinner tonight and then tomorrow use the rest up on pasta. Sloppy Joe mixture over pasta is always a hearty comforting winner dinner for us.

I made this recipe for the first time today.  Very good with the substitutions I made.  I used about a 2/3 cup of ketchup (I put this in a 3/4 cup measuring cup)and finished filling the cup up with (Aldi's brand) hickory brown sugar barbecue sauce.  I left out the brown sugar the recipe called for.  I didn't have a full 2 lbs. of ground beef so I tweeked the remainder of ingredients for slightly less meat.  1 tsp. Worchestershire sauce, 1/2 t. vinegar, big pinch of dried mustard powder, and 1/4 t. lemon juice.  I didn't drain the grease off the meat mixture but after simmering the full time required, the grease was less.  Was very good everyone said.  I agree.  Susan P.

I've made this recipe about 5 times. I've never used celery since we don't eat much of it. There's times when I'm out of fresh onion and used dried, and both turned out fine. Other times I may add diced bell peppers. The first time I made it, it was ok, a little dry but adding 1/3 cup of bbq sauce made a huge difference. It gave it a nice kick and sweetness to it. I don't leave it out when I make this. We like our sloppy joes sloppy and so I make a little bit more sauce. Everytime I make this, my hubby says it's a lot better than the canned or powdered sloppy joe sauces. Thanks!

I made this recipe tonight for dinner. My husband and son really liked it. It would have been good the way the recipe was written but I made a few changes. I only used 1# of ground meat which was venison,and I added chopped sweet peppers along with the onion and celery. If I can sneek veggies in I do. I thought it needed more of a saucy consistency so I added more ketchup and brown sugar and Worcestershire sauce and omitted the lemon juice simply b/c I didn't have any on hand. There wasn't any left. I will jot this down on my recipe cards for a quick go to fast recipe. Thanks for a great recipe!!!

I cooked this recipe for the homeless Veterans in Reno. I converted the recipe to 60 servings (30 people). Everyone really enjoyed it and told me so. The only adjustment I made was I had to Double all of the "sauce" ingrediants.

This was great! Per another reviewer, I added 3/4 cup of ketchup, then added 1/4 cup bbq sauce. To avoid the reported dryness, it's important to brown your beef over low heat, which will preserve the taste. Go ahead and plan on taking a little longer to brown the beef. Due to time constraints, I didn't cook the whole 20 mins after adding the wet ingredients, but I served on toasted wheat buns, and the family enjoyed the meal. Happy cooking!

I made this recipe with ground turkey, it was really tasty, not spicy, I served this to my family and the grandkids loved it. This is a very kid friendly recipe. IT's definitely better than Manwich Sauce. I might try using barbecue sauce in place of ketchup for a little more spice next time, as other reviewers have.

These were very tasty. I did not use celery and next time I will add more wet ingredients because they were not so sloppy but the flavor was great.  I added a little bit of bbq sauce to mine.

Made this today for tomorrow's dinner.  I couldn't stop tasting it is so good.  I increased the sauce by 1/4 as it will soak up a lot overnight, and the reviewers already have said there is no extra sauce.

This was an easy recipe to prepare. The only thing I did differently was to make a lot more sauce; the original recipe was very dry - only meat. I actually quadrupled the recipe for the sauce, and it was perfect! Will definitely make again!

I made this with 1-1/3 lb of 93/7 ground beef (no need to drain grease, but still enough to cook veggies). I followed the recipe, scaled for less meat, & followed a few reviews. I replaced the celery with green pepper & added a can (14.5 oz) of diced tomatoes (juice & all), when it was looking too dry.  I simmered it a bit longer, to absorb/cook-off the tomato juices.
This was THE BEST Sloppy Joe I've ever eaten! Even my picky wife agreed!
Thank you!!! I'll be making this FOREVER!!!

Love this recipe!  It's hard to find recipes that don't use any kind of peppers (that my body just doesn't like) and still have great flavor.

It was pretty good, needed a little more flavor so next time I'm going make a batch for 4 with the same amount of meat as I did for a batch for 2 and that should be perfect. Definitely a keeper!!

The sauce amounts mentioned barely covered the beef, onion and celery. I tripled the ingredients and omitted the sugar. I subbed red wine vinegar for regular white, to give it more richness. and added dijon instead of mustard powder.  With those changes, it was thumbs up!

Bland and dry. Very mild taste and not at all saucy. When I think of sloppy Joe‚Äôs, I think of them as sloppy. This has the consistency of taco meat. Kind of a nice aftertaste. Gave it two stars because it doesn‚Äôt taste like dirt, but that‚Äôs the nicest thing I can say about it.

This is really good! I only subbed green peppers for the celery. 7oz of ketchup is .87 cups, according to Siri. I wish it was a little more ketchup flavored. Sloppy joes should be red sauce, in my opinion. This was essentially clear.

The taste was great but they weren't sloppy enough. Lacked sauce. Maybe doubling the additives would help.

Pleasantly surprised!!!   I was afraid this would be way too bland for me.    This contains many of the same ingredients as my "go to" but in different amounts.   I was curious so I gave it a shot.   Did not have any lemon juice but everything else I made same. 
 Nice job, Tonya!!

This was really good!!  I did make some minor changes.  I used lean ground turkey, a red bell pepper instead of celery and chili sauce instead of ketchup.   I had to double the sauce to have enough for 2lbs of meat.  I will definitely make this again!

A wonderfully delicious and simple recipe. My dad just loved this! And it is so adaptable. I didn't change anything this time, but can see the possibilities. I halved the recipe - there is just 2 of us - and it came up a little dry, but still very tasty. I will be making this one again!

This recipe tastes so good. I halfed everything for a pound of beef and I didn't have any onion or celery so I used a 1/2 tbl of onion powder. Also instead of white vinegar I used apple cider vinegar.

The first time I made this recipe I had ground beef that was already browned so I added some beef broth to cook the celery and onions.  The second time I followed the recipe  cooking them with raw ground beef.  I liked the first way better.  It was less greasy.  Both times It had very good flavor.  We enjoyed it.

my family absolutely loves this. It is a bit sweeter then the normal sloppy joes...but that is what my family prefers. Always a big hit with my son's basketball and football friends also.

All I can say is.. ..  Wow! Yummy! I made it just as it said but I added some parsley flakes. I haven't made sloppy Joe's in years, so I wanted something a little different. This one is my new favorite and the one I'll use from now on thank you for sharing. :)

This Sloppy Joe recipe is the best ever! I left out the celery and doubled the onions. I don't care for celery, but love onions. The added to the sweetness of the Sloppy Joes. I also recommend doubling the sauce. As the sauce recipe is written, the sauce just barely covers the hamburger. By doubling the sauce the hamburger holds together. Otherwise the hamburger just falls off the bun! Great flavor!!!

Best recipe ever!  We don't like bell peppers that are always in other recipes, and I could never get theirs adjusted to taste right. Manwich is ok but too many preservatives for our family. This is our favorite sloppy joe recipe and our whole family thanks you!  Yum!

It wasn't too bad, but I thought it was pretty dry...I guess I like sloppy joes a little saucy and not crumbly.  It was a bit too tangy also. I think I'd omit the lemon juice if I made this again and add some tomato sauce.  There was just too much of a tangy flavor for me.

Tastes great!  I wasn't sure about the 7 ounces of ketchup so I guessed -- almost 1 cup and I added an extra Tablespoon of brown sugar.  It's sweet but I like it!

I was looking for a Sloppy Joe recipe that wasn't spicy and was easy for me to make. Well, this recipe meets both of those requirements! My husband wasn't fond of Sloppy Joes because he can't digest spicy food until he had one of these. He really enjoyed it! My young kids (ages 9 & 6) also don't like spicy foods and one is a huge picky eater. They both loved it! I would definitely add this to my repertoire of Top 10 Meals to Make (in a jiffy!)

This pleasantly surprised me! I love Sloppy Joe's, I like them flavorful but my recipe was beginning to seem a bit sweet to me and I liked the idea of the lemon juice and pickle juice (as some suggested). Some remarked it was dry, so I upped all the elements in the sauce and added about 1/2 cup or more of water to the sauce before adding to the meat. That blended nicely and allowed for a nice thick sauce after 20 minutes of simmering. I also used 1/2 Heinz Chili Sauce for ketchup. Thanks RetiredDad, sometimes the simplest things are the best and I would certainly make this again.

A keeper for sure.  Even our two year old very picky eater granddaughter had seconds.  Will definitely use this recipe again and again.  I used 1 lb hamburger and 1 lb of venison....no one knew the difference.

I have four sloppy joe recipes and I think this is the best one.  My family really liked it! I made it according to the recipe except I added some chopped green pepper and a few drops of Tabasco. Browned the hamburg and then put all inbred. In a crock pot on low. Delicious!

Good, basic recipe.  I tweak it a bit by substituting chopped green pepper for the celery, adding cayenne pepper or hot sauce, and a couple of dashes of garlic powder.  Using half ketchup and half bottled barbeque sauce gives it a more robust flavor, also.

Almost perfect ! My whole church loves this recipe we cook it every year at picnics with just a touch more vinegar, maybe 1 tablespoon - 1/4 cup. Thanks. Sometimes kids dislike Worcestershire sauce, so leave it out.  Anyone who says it isn't great either cooked all the flavor out or has picky kids !!!!

This was so easy and quick and tasty! Left out the celery and increased the onions. Forgot to put in the brown sugar and lemon juice but was still enjoyed by all, and will have it again the way I made it!

This recipe has been our family sloppy joe recipe for at least 40 years.  Have had many many requests for the recipe.  You can include green pepper if you wish, but I am allergic so have always left it out.

Haven't tried the recipe yet but wanted to leave my own hint for great sloppy joe eating -- use hot dog buns instead of the traditional burger buns.  So much easier to eat, all the joe stays in the bun and we top it off with a sprinkle of shredded cheddar and a spoonful of dill relish for even more fun and deliciousness!

This was so good!  I only used one pound of meat and kept everything else the same.  The perfect amount of tang and sweet.  I will make again!

I have a small family so made less, and I use extra lean ground beef so there's no grease to drain.  Browned the celery and a few chopped mushrooms before adding the meat; also added some minced garlic and onion flakes--since I was out of onions--and a couple shakes of celery seed.  Used pickle juice as someone had suggested, and a touch of BBQ sauce at the end to make it a little more saucy.  Toasted the buns--we all thought it was great.  Will definitely make again!!

Good recipe, made better by using Heinz Chili Sauce, which is less sweet than ketchup and has more flavor.

Good basic recipe however I don't like ketchup so I used 1 small can tomato paste mixed with a little water and 1/2 can tomato puree'. did not have Worcestershire so left it out.  I liked vegetathalas mistake so I added extra celery and onion and some green pepper. I like mine a bit spicy so added 1 clove chopped garlic. Browned beef put in crock pot 6 hrs on low but some of us started eating it after 4 hrs. great for busy day when working on the farm, everyone can grab it when they get hungry and come back for more.  It was very good. going to make it for our fourth of July party.

Threw this together on the fly tonight after a busy Spring Break weekend before we return to school.  Like meatloaf, I love the flexibility of sloppy joe recipes for using up the little bits of things you need to use up.  Like other posters, we like our joes wet but not too sloppy so I doubled all the wet ingredients (except vinegar and lemon juice) and added some BBQ sauce I had to use up- came to 1 cup total with ketchup and BBQ sauce together.  I added a couple splashes of Louisiana hot sauce and liquid smoke. I kept all dry ingredients the same as recipe and also added some finely chopped carrots to celery and onion.  One of my twin teen boys went back for an overfilled second joe.  This will be a keeper for us when we need something quick to fix.  Thanks for posting!

So easy to make ahead and plan for a large gathering. Just reheat in your slow cooker until ready to serve. Delicious. Best sloppy joe recipe I've come across. Moist, flavorful and easy to mix in your own little twist if you want. It's sweet so the kiddos will like it. Need a kick? I added seasonal jalapeno and tomato from the garden. TaDa!
