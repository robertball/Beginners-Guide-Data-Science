The general idea of the flavors (potatoes/BlueCheese) sounded great, but the recipe is ALL WRONG. Should probably be around 3T. Butter and 3T. Flour and NOT 1/2 cup of each.  That would make a very thick sauce, or if cooked for 20 minutes, I would think a brick.  I started the recipe not realizing the measurements and ended up making around a triple batch.  The recipe has you cooking the flour for 5 minutes and then after adding the flour, cooking an additional 20 minutes.  I think the person making the recipe just meant it to be 2 cups of a white sauce and then add blue cheese.  If I make this again, I would do as above (probaby use 2C milk instead of 1/2 cream), and also add onion to the butter or maybe onion powder.  If you add too many seasonings I could see them taking away the mild flavor of the blue cheese (which will be mild once mixed with potatoes).  Altogether, I like the idea of adding blue cheese for something totally different than what we would normally cook, but the recipe is totally wrong.  I felt I wasted a lot of Blue Cheese on my first try, which is considered a luxury food in our household.  I am leaving a 2 star review just for the unique idea of this dish.  What a clever idea of adding Blue Cheese to potatoes. Made my mouth water just thinking about it.

*Deserves 5 stars because this is the BEST recipe to build upon!!*  Choose a high quality Blue cheese.  I sauted 2 garlic cloves and 3 shallots in the butter before adding the flour(reduced by 2 tbs.) and cooked for only one minute before adding a pint of half and half.  I thinnnnly sliced RAW potatoes and lightly salt and peppered them before pouring over my sauce and crumbs.  I baked at 350 for about an hour in a covered, ungreased pan.  Great recipe, Judy!

I give the recipe 2 stars, but my results were definitely 5 star. I had to make way too many changes to it. Just looking at the recipe, you can tell something's not right. For one thing, 1/2 cup each of butter and flour is WAY too much roux for just 2 cups of liquid. My bechamel would have been a brick! 

Additionally, this recipe needed flair. It has practically no flavoring except the blue cheese. So I sauteed some garlic and Herbs de Provence with the butter to infuse it with a little seasoning (I'm sure any other herbs you like would be fine) before I added the flour and liquids. I doubled the amount of blue cheese, added Kosher salt to taste, a hit of white pepper, and just a pinch of nutmeg to give it that little something that makes you go "Hmm." Remember to always TASTE your sauce and correct the seasonings as necessary. It's too late once your food comes out of the oven!

I had a pouch of Simply Potatoes hash browns on hand, so I stirred those into the sauce instead of having to cook the potatoes first, and it made things MUCH easier on me. Topped off the casserole with panko bread crumbs, and the results were mouthwatering.

So, 2 stars for a decent starting point, but I definitely had to change it to make it interesting.

I have made this recipe a few times, altering it to get the correct ratios. Apparently, the third time is a charm, because this time, when I made it, it was delish! I used 1/4c butter and 1/4 flour, half & half instead of whipping cream, and 1 cup of gorgonzola cheese (I like it a little better than blue cheese). I also added salt and pepper to the flour/butter mix. It was not greasy or pasty, and we could really taste the cheese. My husband and I both loved it.

Oh my...I am from the midwest, and I still found these to be the most bland things I'd ever tasted. For starters, the two main ingredients in the topping are butter and flour. In restaurants, oil and flour are heated together to add to sauces as a thinckening agent that has no flavor to ruin the sauce's taste. Right there should be your (and should have been mine) cue that this recipe needs HELP. Not to mention that blue cheese as a salad dressing flavor is very flavorful, but actual cheese is not very potent at all...However, all that aside, this recipe has potential. Reduce the amount of potatoes for sure. Use way less flour or add about 3 times more cream. Add some seasoning besides salt and pepper...garlic, thyme, oregano, SOMETHING. And forget the blue cheese, despite the catchy name. Go for a soft, crumbly cheese with robust flavor, maybe an herb spiced feta. Do all this, and although you have a pretty much different recipe, you may be able to pull this off. Even with filet mignon, as is, you will be disappointed.

WOW!  I made these with ribeyes, scaled the recipe to 2 servings (my 2 older children are at my sisters for the night), and my husband cringes at the mention of cheese in a recipe (he hates it).  I cut the flour down to about 1/2 of what was callde for and added some white pepper and some salt (this really needs salt).  I also baked it in my toaster oven since it was a small dish, and the bread crumbs turned nice & brown, I LOVED THESE!  I can't wait to share with the kids, I may even throw some ham in there to make it an easy meal.  Thanks Judie!!!

This is a great recipe.  Although I had to doctor it the second time around.  The first time I followed it according to the recipe.  WAY too much flour caused it to be pasty.  The second time I lessened the flour and added a bit more blue cheese, and some garlic powder and fresh onions.  DELICIOUS!!!

This was absolutely incredible!  At first I thought the bleu cheese might be too overpowering, but it wasn't.  I did change the recipe up a bit based on other reviews.  I changed the amount of flour to 4 tablespoons.  I also added quite a bit of seasoning to it.  Being that I'm from New Orleans, I like to kick it up a notch..."BAM!"  I sauteed garlic in the butter and I added about 2 tablespoons of Old Bay seasoning to the cheese/cream mixture.  Everyone that ate it can't stop talking about it!

After reading all of the reviews,I decided to sautee the butter with two cloves of garlic,added garlic salt and pepper,too!I didn't add the flour,instead used one cup of fat free half and half to cut back on the excessive calories!It was full of flavor and crispy on top and not so creamy,but,it's definately a recipe you can "doctor" up!I will make this again for sure,I also sliced the potatoes thin and didn't boil the potato,baked for one hour in 350 degrees,and it turned out very very good!

I made a scalloped jazzed up version of this, and it was absolutely wonderful served with buffalo chicken meat balls.  I made a roux with the butter and flour and then added in the milk and half-and-half.  To give this more flavor I added some white pepper, thyme, and rosemary seasonings, and added a 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese along with Gorgonzola.

I agree with the others that the proportions are a bit off here.  I played around with amounts, and added seasonings, garlic, and bits of bacon before baking them at 400 degrees for one hour.  With the amendments, they were decent.

I was skeptical about this recipe because of the mixed reviews..I should have known. It was really strange. Definately not a summer dish. Very heavy, very fattening. It's difficult to describe. The topping didn't taste like paste like one reviewer said but rather had the consistency and appearance of paste. The taste wasn't outstanding either. I'm disappointed I wasted good potatoes. Definately, definately reduce the flour and maybe it would be better. Though I have to agree with one reviewer who said she thought it was beyond help! I give it two stars b/c it wasn't horrible, just really not good. It's hard to describe.

These were very creamy tasty potatoes however I was hoping for more of a blue cheese taste. I may try this recipe again and change the amounts of ingredients.

Very good as written. To keep a sauce or gravy lump-free, slide the pan off direct heat, whisk in the liquid, then return the pan to heat and continue to cook gently. It works for all the roux (flour and fat) based gravy/sauces. I look for blue with the most blue veining - it has the sharpest flavor. The only thing I changed was to cut the potatoes into slabs rather than cubes; that way I could more-or-less layer the sauce within the potatoes.

My hubby just loved these potatoes.  He would give way more stars if he could.  Me not so much.  following other reviewers suggestions, I cut way back on the flour and butter for the roux, and I am very glad that I did.  I added some Creole seasoning and a half a cup of parmesan cheese.  It was maybe a 4 star for me.  Thanks for posting the recipe.

Excellent change of pace and the blue cheese taste isn't too strong.  My sauce was somewhat thick so I think next time I will add more milk to thin it just a little.  Overall wonderful variation for potatoes!

I had something similar to this at a rehersal dinner.  This recipe was thicker- in the future I'd cut the flour in 1/2 or 1/4 to make it more stewy (spelling?!?) consistancy.  Very good combo though- blue cheese & potatoes.  Thanks for sharing.

Flavor was very good. I also sauted garlic in butter and added 1/2 and 1/2 instead of cream. I used thinly sliced potatoes raw and baked for 1 hr at 350. Needed a little bit more baking time. Flavor was very good!!

This was a really good, quick, easy recipe.  I only cooked the sauce for about 3 min instead of 20 and I added salt, pepper, and a few cloves of minced garlic.  Great flavor - will definately make again.  Thanks.

This was great!  I put in some onion powder and salt to give more flavor (after reading some of the reviews).  I actually was pleased that the blue cheese didn't stand out more.  I think next time I might add chopped onions in with the potatoes.  I am going to serve this one to the in-laws!

TOO MUCH FLOUR called for in this recipe....I had to add at least 1-2 cups extra cream/milk to get a normal consistency for a sauce.  Could also use more bleu cheese for added flavor.

Very good.  The flavor of the bleu cheese wasn't as prominent as I would have liked but that could have been the variety I used.  I had some emmantaler and added that with some salt and that brought up the flavors.  The final product was a hit.

Well....I did something that I never do and that is to make this without reading the reviews.  I prepared them exactly as the recipe is written.  They were about the consistency of scalloped potatoes and looked very good.  The bleu cheese couldn't even be tasted.  My husband and I liked them but my son tasted them and decided not to have anymore.  I don't think I would prepare them again simply because they were a lot of fuss to get to a bland end result.

I thought it was okay.  It was very rich.  I don't suggest it for anyone with kids.  None of my kids liked it.  I'd rather have scalloped or augratin.

I made this for my boyfriend and I.  Overall we enjoyed it but the first time I made it my sauce turned out like lumpy butter.  My boyfriend who attended cooking school informed me I needed to temper the milk with the butter mixture before adding it all together.  Next time I would do what others suggested and add more blue cheese and salt next time.

I followed the Directions to a T. But It didnt come out the way I thought it would... My Finace liked it, but I could really taste the flour, and not the blue cheese, I will give this one more shot but add more blue cheese and cut down on the flour.

Improvised a bit -- upped the amount of blue cheese, left out the flour and used heavy whipping cream only. These really went great with a Delmonico recipe from this site (see reviews). Served with Pat's Sauteed Mushrooms (also from Allrecipes) and a bottle of Pepperwood Merlot. All the flavors complemented each other so well. Great meal.

Pretty good.  It has a bit of a flour-y taste but the blue cheese definitely makes up the difference.

Not overpowered by the bleu cheese - nice texture. Put it under the brioler for a crunchy top.

An okay recipe, although I'd add more cheese next time; you can barely taste it as is. Pretty good overall, but not worth the time and effort involved.

I read all the other reviews that said it was bland so I added more blue cheese and salted the potatos too. It was really too blue cheesey for my family. Still would make again and use original amount of blue cheese. I used potatos that I had baked instead of boiling. I also made some with cheddar and sharp provolone and they were a big hit!!

4 stars only because I altered the recipe. I sautéed 1 shallot, thinly sliced and 3 minced garlic cloves along with 1 t 'Penzeys Fox Point' seasoning and a healthy dose of salt. The family loved it. Definitely will make again. Might try a stronger cheese next time, although the blue cheese was a delicate creamy layer of flavor.

My husband made this for Mother's Day dinner. Served with Ribeye and steamed asparagus it looked impressive on the plate. He should have checked reviews to see what others had tweaked to make it theirs. He increased the liquid (3/4 c. cream)and reduced the cooking time of the sauce. He added 2 oz more of the bleu cheese (remainder of package) to have a little more "punch". As others have suggested, sauteed onions, garlic and maybe rosemary would be a nice touch. It was ok. Will try to morph the leftovers into a cheesy potato soup.

I wish I had read the reviews first! Everyone was right. I think that it has potential, but the amounts are all off, and it does need a little something else. I am hoping that I was able to rescue it enough to be edible. I realized that we were off course when after adding the milk and cream it went semi-solid! Don't go in unaware!

Well, how do I put this.....Strange to say the least.  I did not have cream so I doubled the milk.  Still it was not a creamy mixture at all.  I ended up adding sald and the bleu cheese and mixed it all up before putting it in the dish to bake.  Turned out very good, just not what I had expected.  I will try this again, perhaps with less flour.

I used more blue cheese than it called for like another person suggested. These were so good that not only did we finish them but my family keeps asking when I can make them again. If you like blue cheese than these are for you!!! I have made them often!!!!

These were really good.  I used raw new poatatoes and baked in the oven for 45 minutes.  I would cut down on the butter next time.  I scaled it down for 2 people and there wasn't quite enough cream sauce so I would make more of that also.

Was very excited to try because the steak marinate was a BIG hit.  BUT....a bit bland and so-so tasting.  Not great, not horrible. I even put about twice the amount called of blue cheese, but still so bland.  Won't prepare again, I'm afraid!

interesting kick, and not too-overwhelming.  I doubled the amount of milk I used, because I didn't have any cream.  They were just okay, nothing spectacular.  I halved the recipe and still ended up with a HUGE BATCH.  Probably won't take the time to make again.

I tried to modify this recipe according to suggestions posted here.  I used 2 cups half and half and 3 T each of butter and flour.  Unfortunately, these efforts didn't help; the potatoes lack taste and are too buttery.  I think the recipe is beyond help.

I made these to go with a RibEye steak dinner -- so delicious!  I was asked for the recipe.  You can make ahead.  I doubled the blue cheese.  I would definately make again.
