One other tip to insure crisp beer batter fish is to never drain on paper towel, always on a wire rack.  Placing any hot fried food on paper towels will steam the batter fry and make it less crispy.  Love the other tips as well.  If you have trouble having the batter stick during frying, place battered food in freezer for 12-15 min and remove to the hot oil immediately.

My absolute favorite method for frying up fish. I seasoned with Old Bay and used sparkling mineral water in place of beer and it came out perfectly crisp without being heavy or too oily.

This battered fish recipe came out exactly how I had in mind.  I followed the recipe exactly, except, to my dismay, realized I had no beer in the house.  (Unheard of in this household.)  Since all was ready to go, I used non-fat milk instead, and it still tasted great and was perfectly crispy.  The only change I would make next time is to have beer on hand!

I followed the recipe exactly .  I wouldn't recommend a single change.  It was GREAT.   This is now my "go to" recipe for any kind of breaded meat.  I Finally found out how to make a truly crispy  breaded fish!   One suggestion....don't store your left overs in a zip lock bag.  It makes them soggy.  I made that mistake with the first batch I cooked.  The second batch, I stored in a glass  dish lined with paper towels.  It stayed fresh and crispy.   Oh, I thickened the remaining beer batter, added some dill and garlic, and plopped it into the hot oil making some really  great tasting fritters which I served with the fish instead of chips.

I have ordered  fish and chips up and down the  coast of North America.  I am from the Maritimes so have grown up on sea food of all kinds.   This is hands down the best battered fish Iâ€™ve ever had.     Seems crazy, cause I made it myself!  Used haddock as my fish.
