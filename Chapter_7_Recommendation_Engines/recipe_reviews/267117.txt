Reminds me of the chocolate cake from my youth. Deep chocolate flavor, not too sweet and perfectly moist. Definitely a keeper!

I didn’t do all the decorations. I wanted a decadent dark chocolate cake that was soft and almost melt in the mouth like. This recipe took it for me. I made it for a friends birthday. She enjoyed it so much. Her kids loved it as well. They just finished the last of it today. The frosting was just perfect as well. I love this kind of cake with a side of cold milk. The only thing I would do is leave it in the oven 15 min longer and I did not use dark cocoa cuz I couldn’t find it. It came out perfect either way.
