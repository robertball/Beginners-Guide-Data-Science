This was spectacular, even my two year old loved it! I have made it exactly as is, which is wonderful but also added green pepper last time too and was great with that too and probably nearly any vegetable you can think of. Thanks for a great and easy recipe!

This was very good! We love brussel sprouts! I couldn't find frozen pearl onions in the store, so I just put regular chopped onion in it. Thanks for the recipe!

I have been making this for years using any fresh seasonal vegetables. All kinds of colourful peppers, asparagus, thinly sliced potatoes, garlic cloves , fennel ......the list is endless. Any oil based salad dressing works really well as a marinade. Try Greek, Italian, sesame ginger etc. Add fresh or dry herbs  oregano for greek, rosemary for Italian to the marinade. This  recipe can be made the day before, brought up to room temperature and used as an antipasto, or as a lovely salad or side. Size of vegetable and cooking time depends on your preference .
Frozen Pearl onions are expensive but  chunks of real red onion are attractive and fresh.

Very good and easy recipe.  I had a full grill so I used the stove for this one.  Still tasted great.

I am not a fan of French dressing but I thought this recipe would give it a new kick, but it didnt.

I thought this was excellent! I wasn't sure about the French dressing but it worked nicely. I was unable to find the frozen pearl onions and used the pickled ones that come in a jar instead. I loved them in there but do not recommend that substitution if you are not a big pickle fan. They are mega tart. I will definitely use this recipe again!

This was delicious!  I didn't have pearl onions, so I diced regular onions. I cooked it all on the stove for about 20 minutes after letting it marinate for 2 hours.

I liked it.  Made it on the stove.  Some of the directions I thought were not descriptive enough.  "High Heat" lends itself to interpretation.  Makes me nervous when I see this boiling.  But it was good.  Will finish up the rest tomorrow night.

This was an excellent.  After marinating the vegetables in the french dressing for about 30 minutes, I roasted the vegetables on a sheet pan at 375 for about 30 minutes (this may vary depending on your oven).  The broccoli, onions and tomatoes caramelized beautifully and the vegetables were delicious.  I will definitely make this again!

Excellent recipe!  I just made a couple changes.  I added baby red potatoes (cut in half) and used Italian dressing instead.   Cooked on stove rather slowly at med heat.  Delicious.
