Here is a great modification to this recipe if you
don't have a grill or you have no time to cook.
Preheat the oven to 350; spray a pan with Pam;
throw in some boneless pork chops; top with the
brown sugar, butter and soy sauce and bake for
about 20 minutes.  The kids loved them!

Too sweet for our spice fans so I modified as follows.  I wanted a quick marinade so I deleted the salt, water and cornstarch, halved the oil and increased the soy sauce to 4 tablespoons.  Then I heated the sauce to dissolve the sugar and poured it over the chops to marinate for 30 minutes. We grilled for no more than 10 minutes and the reviews from my team were 'can we have this again next week?'  Not sweet or salty but just very flavorful and juicy! Thanks!

Follow-up:  I forgot about the modifications I made last time (notes above) and made recipe exactly as written.  Much better WITH the modifications unless you really like sweet!

This is a good basic pork chop/brown sugar recipe... as is. I would like to say something, when you guys rate a recipe, it's supposed to the the original recipe, as listed. But what do I see? I see a 5-star rating, and three paragraphs on how you changed the recipe. I you changed it, then it wasn't 5-star. Or are you saying, that if you cook the recipe with your modifications, then it will be 5-star. Okay, it's just a rant; however, I just don't get how you rate something 5-star, and then go on to tell me that you didn't like it, and here's the changes you need to make.

Awesome recipe- I cooked this tonight for company.  I followed the recipe exact for the sauce- but I used both chicken & chops and it was great on both. I also like to ensure that the meat comes out tender, so I marinated it in equal parts apple cider vinegar & apple juice.  Followed the advice of another review & served this with "Cinnamon Rice with Apples" - another great recipe.

I made this for my family and it was a hit.  Even my daughter who has to be one of the pickiest eaters on the planet ate it all up.  However, I was out of apple juice, so I substituted canned pineapple chunks.  It worked out great.  I will keep this one on file.

This is YUM.  Pretty sweet.  You don't need a lot of sauce.  I marinated the pork for about half an hour before grilling it.  It turned out great!

These pork chops came off the grill tender and juicy! As I read in another review, I used Jack Daniel's in my sauce. I only used 1T. oil and I used 2T. Jack. It added excellent flavor!  Thanks!

My family really liked these chops. I did find that with all of the oil and water, the sauce ended up pretty watery. So I decided to marinade the pork chops for about an hour before the BBQ, and then brushed them with the sauce during cooking. Also, I thought it seemed a bit sweet, so I added quite a bit of pepper to add some spice and cut back the sweet. Would make again :)

Excellent recipe!  I didn't have any apple juice, so substituted what I had on hand (mango/passion fruit) and they were great anyway.Great flavor for a summer cook out!

This recipe was so sweet and delicious without being overly so. It made the pork chops so moist and it was so easy. Even my 2 year old loved it!

I didn't quite make this recipe quite like it was written, but it was absolutely delicious.  Instead of using it as a glaze, I marinated the pork chops using all the ingredients, (with the exception of the cornstarch) overnight, and then grilled to perfection in a charcoal grill.  These pork chops were flavorful and juicy...without being over seasoned.

This was awesome! Of course my gril was broken! so I made some changes: I only used 1/4 cup brown sugar, a whole cup of apple juice and no water. I lightly dredged the chops in flour and place in a baking dish and poured the sauce over them and added sliced onions on top then covered with foil. I baked at 350 for 45 min. The sauce was thick and flavorful and the whole family loved them. I served with Chipotle mashed sweet potatoes recipe from this site. Thanks for this great recipe!

I picked this recipe - well, because I had all the ingredients on hand!  I'm not often moved to write a review, but these chops were fabulous!  I cut my own chops from a boneless pork loin, cutting pieces about 1-1/2 inches thick and then butterflying them (because I figured 4 big butterflied chops would be less work to grill than 8 single chops), so they were about 3/4 of an inch thick.  I let them marinate in some of the sauce for about an hour before grilling.  When I made the sauce I eliminated the 1/2 cup of water (because of other comments about it being too thin), and I just mixed the cornstarch in with everything else (save yourself the extra step and bowl) - just make sure the cornstarch is thoroughly dissolved before you start cooking or you'll have a mess!  Basically I was just praying that I wouldn't ruin these chops, but they were absolutely fabulous!!  About 6 minutes per side (after searing each side) seemed to work perfectly for me.  The meat was juicy and tender, and the sauce was a great addition - when I mixed it up I thought it was kind of heavy to soy sauce, but in the end it was very well balanced.  I think the key to this is to use thicker chops.  My only planned change is to try adding some hot peppers to the sauce for a sweet/hot taste.  I can't wait to make this again!

OK - first off, February is not grilling season here on good old Cape Cod, MA - so I knew I needed to find an alternate cooking method.  Here's what I did - I seasoned the chops with salt and pepper, and then browned on each side in a skillet in a little bit of butter.  Removed the chops, scraped all the cooked bits, and then added DOUBLE all of the sauce ingredients MINUS the s&p, water, and cornstarch.  I then plopped the chops back into the skillet, covered, and cooked for about 25 mins.... DONE!  Was absolutely delicious, and the sauce caramelized very nicely in the pan and did not need the water and cornstarch to thicken. I definitely recommend doubling the sauce as everyone loved dipping the pork in the extra sauce.

Excellent! In lieu of boneless pork chops, I picked bone-in pork chops. I poked holes in the pork chops. I made the marinade cutting back the amount of vegetable oil to 2T, increasing the soy sauce to 3T. I mixed in all the other ingredients plus I added a capful of apple cider vinegar which really added a nice touch to the marinade. It gave it a nice little "kick"in flavor, a slight tang but not too tangy. I marinated the pork chop for at least 8 hours. I grilled the pork chops, cooking time was approximate. I must say that the pork chops were juicy, meat tender, not tough, and full of flavor. I served this with "Cinnamon Rice with Apples," from this website, which complemented each other nicely.

These are the best pork chops I've ever eaten! The whole family tore these up. I loved that these didn't require a marinade time since we were in a rush for our meal and I forgot to plan ahead last night. My husband used mesquite charcoal and the taste of the smoky mesquite along with the apple and the sweet brown sugar was fabulous! I didn't have apple juice so I used the same amount of apple sauce and this turned out perfectly. I even forgot the cornstarch/water but I guess since I had used applesauce to start with mine turned out okay anyway. This is a definite keeper!!! And I really don't even like pork :) Thanks so much for such a wonderful meal.

I have made this many times now. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the sweetness. I did cut back on the sugars since the first time making it. I have made it on both the grill and on my electric griddle.

The sauce had a pretty good flavor, but the flavor only coated the outside of the chops. I'm thinking if I marinated them IN that sauce it would have helped. I let my meat rest for about 30 minutes prior to grilling. You want to get the chill off the meat first. Then let the meat rest AFTER grilling for 10 minutes or so, giving the juices time to reincorporate back into the meat. Makes for juicy pork chops for sure. The grilling time was right on for the chops I used. They were on the thin side and had bones. Thanks for the recipe. This is the first thing I have EVER grilled.

Read thru everyone else's reviews then changed the sauce recipe as follows: halved the oil, left the water out completely, added 2 Tbsp. Jack Daniels. I broiled the chops (it started to rain as I was going to start the grill!) and basted the chops several times while they cooked. Good flavor, not dry at all.

This was very good, I did marinate my pork in a ziplock baggie all day in some of the sauce, we grilled on hot grill about 3-4 min. each side and then moved to indirect heat and coated with the marinade and cooked about four more min. So juicy and sweet, our guest went back for seconds. By the way I saw some reviews that said the sauce didn't thicken, and I believe that the 2 teaspoons of corn starch might be a misprint and it should be 2 tablespoons mixed in the water.

I used the sauce to marinate pork cubes, then skewered them with fresh pineapple chunks and basted all with more sauce while grilling. The yummiest thing my BBQ has ever produced.

This is a great recipe!  It was certainly sweet, but neither my husband nor I found it too sweet.  I think this would make a nice holiday recipe.  I used a little less vegetable oil, but other than that kept everything else the same.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I made a lot of changes to this recipe, but the basic combination was so good I still give it 5 stars. :)  First of all, I had to use orange juice instead of apple because that was all I had.  Second, I did the chops on the stovetop.  I pan-seared them on both sides with a little olive oil, then added about 3 T. tawny port.  I let that burn off for a few seconds and then poured all the sauce into the pan.  The sauce thickened beautifully and made a delicious glaze.  I turned the chops frequently and just simmered them until they cooked through.  My husband and I both loved it. :)

This meal was very good.  My husband, 3 children, 1 neighborhood friend, and I loved these chops!  It pairs quite nicely with the Cinnamon Rice w/ Apples from this website.  I would recommend saving extra sauce for mopping up the meat (however don't let it get too cold as it will become too gelatinous).

OH YEAH SKIPPY!  We've got a keeper here.  This sauce is so good, great flavors but nothing overpowers anything else.  I'm going to try it on chicken very soon.  The recipe is great as written.  A couple of suggestions you might want to try: marinate in a mixture of soy sauce and bourbon in the fridge for a few hours and then pat dry and rub with kosher salt and coarse black pepper.  And the water, use bourbon instead.  It evaporates quickly and leaves it's flavor in the thickened sauce. Also, don't wait too long to begin basting or it won't candy up on the chops. Well done and Happy Grilling

These were really good chops.  I used 1/4 c. sugar and it was just fine.  I did marinate the chops all day in the mixture.  I put them in a large zip top bag, added the marinade and refrigerated.  Very tender and tasty.

Great flavor!  As per another review, I made this as a marinade by only heating to blend in the sugar and omitting the cornstarch/water thickening.  I let them sit in the fridge for a little over an hour and they came off the grill perfectly tasty!

These were the tastiest pork chops ever! I combined the brown sugar, apple juice, soy sauce, ground ginger, salt, pepper, and substituted olive oil (it's a bit healthier than veg. oil) in a large tupperware bowl. I let the pork chops marinate in that for 24 hours then baked them in the oven for 20-25 minutes. I made the brown sugar mixture again and poured on top after they had been baked. We even poured it over the veggies. AMAZING! Definitely a family favorite.

These are AWESOME!  I poked the chops with a fork and marinated them in one batch and used another batch of glaze to brush on them on the grill.  Just not sure how to do these in the winter as it is too cold to grill where we live.

I took some advice that others had given. I wanted to marinate the chops, as I would be grilling them indoors on the George Foreman. So I cut out the oil, cornstarch and water. I marinated them for a couple hours. I must admit that I ran out of soy so I used all I had which was teriyaki. I think that it still turned out pretty good. I will try this again with soy and decide which I like better. Thanks...

Yum, yum, yummy!!!!!  My family has been in a pork chop rut for SO long so I have been searching high and low for some different ways to cook the other white meat besides Shake and Bake and this hit the bill.  I have some open minded eaters to serve and it was a hit.  However, even my picky micky eaters gave this two thumbs up.  I kept the ingredients true to the recipe but I did use the sauce to marinade the chops and then once they were on the grill I used the side burner as a dipping station to reheat the sauce and then used it for dipping the chops as they were grilling!!!  I know many of you will frown on this way of cooking but I have done it many times with a chicken wings recipe from this site and love the extra punch of flavor with no ill effects to my family!!!

Next time I might add some Crystal hot sauce to spice things up a bit!!!

Give this a recipe a chance and you will not be sorry!!!

Thank you, thank you, thank you for such a great way to cook chops!!!

Love this recipe!  I have never like pork chops until I tried this recipe!  I even had seconds!  The only modification I made was to mix 2 Tbsp. cornstarch with 3 Tbsp. water instead of what it called for for water and cornstarch.  This thickened it up a lot and made it into more of a bbq sauce.  I prefer this because the juice of the chops thins it out some and it doesn't slide off quite as quickly.

I baked the chops with the sauce as someone else suggested. Next time I will add more cornstarch to thicken it a bit more. My chops were also really thick so I had to cook them for about 40 min. at 350. The kids enjoyed it, so I'm happy!

I would have been more than happy to give five stars but I made changes after reading reviews.  I used bone in chops, omitted the water, salt and cornstarch; halved the oil and increased the soy sauce to 4 Tbsp.  I also cooked the ingredients to dissolve the sugar, poked holes in the chops and marinated for approximately 40 minutes.  I then grilled the chops until 145 degrees. These were fabulous! !! As a professional chef I often play around with recipes but found no alterations were needed other than the ones I did. I added the cornstarch to the marinade and brought to a boil to thicken. My daughter does not eat pork products but admitted she likes these. most certainly one to keep. 
The chops were tender and juicy, sauce was slightly sweet but not overbearing

The only thing I did differently was to let the pork chops marinate in apple juice over night. These turned out very sweet and delicious. I am not a big pork chop fan, but found myself taking seconds. Will be making again!

The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 was because the brown sugar mixture was hard to spread on the pork chops. Still amazing though! The sweetness was the perfect element for the pork chops. My boyfriend requests these all the time!

This recipe is great with the modifications suggested previously. 4Tablespoons soy sauce , a little more pepper than normal, and marinating the chops in the unthickened sauce.   I used low sodium soy sauce so I kept some of the salt.  I also used only half the unthickened sauce as a marinade.  I thickened up the other half to use as the glaze for the chops.  Wonderful, not too sweet not too salty.  Definitely made it into my rotation since it's so easy and so good.  Oh and for the new cooks, don't forget to tenderize the chops with a meat mallet before marinating; makes a world of difference.

Simple to make and delicious to eat!  The pork chops are always moist and the sweet sauce compliments the pork well.  Love this recipe!  One note:  I do not think the sauce tastes as good for leftovers.  It's still good, but tastes slightly different.

Wonderful!  I used it as a marinade for the chops, as well as for skewers of mushrooms and zucchini--wow!  It made the grilled mushrooms have a crispy crust that was so good, I never would have thought they would be so good.  I followed the recipe exactly, except for adding a splash of liquid smoke.  This has now become the only way I do pork chops and mushrooms on the grill.  Thanks for a great recipe!

These were a little too sweet and had a bit of a "different" flavor, but in fairness I changed both the ingredients and cooking method.  I used 1/2 as much fresh grated ginger as ground and cooked 4 boneless chops in a 350-degree oven for 20 minutes, broiling them a little at the end.  They undoubtedly would have been better off the grill and with a thinner layer of sauce.  The texture and doneness were perfect this way, however. Recipes that specify amounts of salt are better, IMO.

I marinated my chops in apple juice for about an hour before grilling.

I also seasoned the chops well with salt and pepper.

Came out great.  My family loved them.

Great flavor...the only thing I would do differently is marinade the pork before grilling.

All I could taste was the ginger and the sauce was thin and runny. I took one bite and forbid my husband from even trying it because I was so embaressed at how badly it tasted.

This is a really good recipe. The next time I make it I'm going to try adding a little bit of Jack Daniels to see if it improves the flavor. It needs a tad bit more a kick to make it a 5 star recipe.

I think the chops should have been marinated prior to grilling.  The glaze was sickly sweet. This recipe needs the salt from the soy sauce, the acid from the vinegar and the heat from the chili flakes to cut through the sweetness of the juice and brown sugar.

I made these last night for dinner.  I didn't have any apple juice, so I used unsweetened apple sauce (1/2 cup).  Did not add any water/ corn starch.  The sauce seemed to slightly thicken to my satisifaction w/out the thickener.  I did add a bit more soy sauce, garlic powder and some red pepper flakes.  I reserved some sauce to serve w/ the chops.  My son loved these!  Even licked the plate -- which he never does.  I was told "it's a keeper" and will make again.

I used apple cider vinegar instead of apple juice and doubled the ginger, and I marinated pork steaks in everything but the cornstarch and water for a few hours before broiling them.  The flavor was really good!  I then thickened and boiled for 5 min the leftover marinade and used it as a sauce for rice.

The glaze wasn't as thick as I thought it would be but it was delicious. Poured it over chops and baked them and served it with the Cinnamon Rice with Apples recipe on here. Awesome. Especially with the glaze poured over the rice.

Not bad but not as flavorful as I was hoping for. Next time I make this I'll read through the reviews and get some ideas to kick the flavor up a notch.

Entire family loved these.  Doubled the sauce - only put cornstarch in half.  Marinated in the unthickened sauce - then basted and dipped later with the thicker sauce.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I followed the sauce part exactly, but ended up using a tenderloin roast instead of the chops, and it still was delicious.  Would highly recommend to anyone who loves a sweeter sauce for pork.

Tried this tonight and we are VERY pleased with this recipe.  Basted the chops when first placed on the grill, but cooked a little longer before turning and basted again as soon as turned.  Will absolutelly do this again!!

Made the sauce without the ginger because I couldn't find mine. Sweet but not syrupy.  Added some ground red pepper but could not taste it. Hubby loved them but I think he was most excited about pork chops cooked over charcoal. Will try with some fine Kentucky bourbon next time!

not bad, although a tad too sweet for us.  I did marinade, which could have made it sweeter or less sweet--not really sure, so I'd cut down on the amount of sugar next time.  Otherwise, though, I felt it was a pretty nice marinade for pork.  Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly except that I added a little mor4e cornstarch to the water for a thicker consistency.  It was absolutely out of this world!  This is what I will be using from now on for my pork chops!

I made these using pineapple juice rather than apple juice and I cut the brown sugar by half.  I’m glad I did, or these would have been way too sweet for us.  I also eliminated nearly all the water, using just enough to mix with the cornstarch, maybe 1 T.  Next time I will coat the chops with some of the sauce before putting them on the grill.  I think we’ll get better grill marks and the sauce will glaze the chops.

A tasty glaze that works well for chicken also. But, I was a little disappointed that the meat wasn't more flavorful. Next time, will use throughout grilling.

Easy and very tasty.  After making the sauce as instructed, I felt it needed a little more ooomph, so I added a couple tablespoons of Chambord.  A hot grill is key and it only takes a few minutes per side.

Great grill recipe. The cooking instructions were great. This was the first time I didn't overcook chops. The glaze was yummy and easy to make ahead of time. I added more corn starch because I preffered it thicker. Will break out for company for sure.

Very Good! I did not have apple juice so I used apple sauce.  It had a nice flavor and also made it perfectly thickened - no need for cornstarch and water. I will be making this again and again.

Excellent if you marinate it over night!! I tried it the first time the way the recipe says...to just brush the meat with it. Not enough flavor this way.

This marinade is awesome!  The balance of sweetness to spicy was great, although we like a bit more spice so I added some cayenne pepper.  We have made this once with pork chops and once with chicken kabobs.  I also ran out of apple juice the second time and used orange juice.  It was great both ways but I prefer with apple juice.  My sauce thickened just fine too.  I gave it plenty of time though.

Fantastic!  I've made these twice now.  This last time I bought a bulk pack of good quality chops, divided them into two freezer bags, and froze them in the marinade.  I thawed one bag overnight in the fridge and threw them on the grill in the evening. They came out perfect.  I really love spice and heat.  To me, the hotter, the better.  These are a change, but really good.  They are a little sweet, but even after marinading all day long, they didn't overpower.  It makes me wonder how mine differed from the other reviewers.  Also, for those that thought the sauce was too thin or that extra cornstarch was necessary, try simmering longer.  It will thicken up.  Just be patient.  To freeze the chops, I cooked down the sauce and then cooled it in the fridge overnight.  The next day I added it to the chops and put them in the freezer immediately.  I removed all the air from the freezer bags to prevent freezer burn.  I cooked them on a hot grill for about 10 minutes.  I moved most of them to the warming rack for the last few minutes as the grill was really hot.  They were very juicy and tender and the sauce carmelized perfectly.  Everybody loved them!

My family loved this recipe! I was afraid it would be too sweet according to other reviews, but it wasn't at all! Next time I will try to marinate the chops in the sauce 30 minutes before grilling like some reviewers did. My husband is not a sweets fan and he cannot wait for me to make this again!

OUTSTANDING!!! I added a little cayanne pepper and put the pork chops on a bed of sliced onions, then placed them under the broiler for about 7 minutes a side. This was great!!! I will absolutely make this again and again!!

I halved the recipe since I was making it for one and did it in the broiler. The sauce was too runny; I added more corn starch to thicken it up. I loved the flavour of the sauce. There wasn't much flavour on the chops themselves, so I did a lot of dipping into the extra sauce. Next time I may marinate as others did. Yummy!

A little too sweet and also lacking something...  I tried adding garlic powder and some red pepper but it still needed something else.  Added less veg oil.  The pork chops were very tender & juicy.

I pan fried bone in pork chops seasoned with McCormick garlic and sea salt grinder with a little olive oil. I made the sauce per directions, only I doubled it. It is amazing. I love this sauce. I did not find it too sweet. I thought it was just right. I will make it again probably with Chicken as well. Hubby liked it too. Good recipe!!

WOW!!!!!  I have a new 'go-to' marinade, and THIS is IT!!!!!  Made only one modification, substituted carbonated tonic water for the apple juice.   Talk about TENDER!  This is SUPPOSED to be a sweet, sticky marinade.  I used rather thick pork sirloin steaks and left them marinating in the fridge over night.  Grilled them on the stove in cast iron and served them with some yummy jasmine rice and green beans sautéed with  chopped bacon and onion.  Sweet, savory, salty...YUM!!!  Thank you so much for this awesome recipe!  Gonna try beef and chicken, too, bet it would be awesome with a bit of garlic added and used on bone-in Korean style short ribs!

I can't rate this exact recipe, but I make a close version of ginger brown sugar pork chops that is a family favorite. I make it in a skillet instead of on the grill though. I lightly brown the chops in 1 tbsp olive oil instead of 4 tbsp veg oil, and then simmer them in the sauce for a few minutes. I also increase the ginger, eliminate the soy sauce, and decrease the water to just enough to mix with the cornstarch. They're fantastic!

Yummm!! I did not expect that first bite to be so good! I used orange juice instead of apple because I didn't have any. I will try it again with the apple juice though. I don't often rate recipes with five stars, but this one deserves it! Quick, easy, AND delicious! I served this dish with couscous.

Made a second time with pineapple juice. It was better with the orange juice!

Simple and good!  I don't think you can rate a recipe after making a bunch of changes. Then it's not the recipe, it's yours. Anyway, most of my family of 8 (which includes 6 picky kids) ate it. I will definitely make it again.  No changes. Try it this way first then modify to suit your taste if need be. I also used the leftover sauce on chicken the next day.  Great on chicken too!!

I wish I could give this one more stars! As is it is about a 3, but with modifications, about a 4.5! Rave reviews from my family. I seasoned my chops with garlic & onion powder, salt, pepper, & marinated overnight in 1/2 c apple juice & 1-2tbsp soy sauce. I followed others' advice to reduce the oil to 1tbsp, sugar to 1/4 cup & added 1 tbsp cider vinegar. After tasting, I felt it tasted to "soy saucey," so I added a bit more sugar to taste. Grilled and brushed with sauce in last few min of grilling. OUTSTANDING! Definitely a keeper & is a recipe that can be modified to taste.

We followed this recipe exactly and I wasn't really crazy about them, nor was my family.  They were just okay in our opinion.  I almost think they need a little more acidity and to marinate prior to grilling and basting.

I added some flavor to the sauce---a dash of Sambal Oelek, a little garlic powder, and a little more ginger.  The amount of water to cornstarch is off because I felt the sauce was too runny.  I did brine my pork chops (Pork Chop Grill) in preparation of this dish.  This made for a pleasant meal.

Nice way to flavor pork.  I had one thick boneless pork chop and one bacon wrapped pork fillet.  We are not apple juice drinkers, but knowing that the recipe called for it, I bought a small juice box of 100% apple juice.  It worked great in this recipe and I didn't have to throw away much. I served this with 'Oven Baked Parsley Red Potatoes', another AR recipe.

A good recipe if you are in the mood for a very sweet glaze on your meat... definitely don't over do the sauce or like many reviewers you will complain about it being too sweet... I like the idea some reviewers had of substituting Jack Daniels in for the apple juice I think I will try it next time... but as written it is a cook glaze as long as you don't over do it

good but you really need to baste it more than once at the end.  Flavor is tasty though...

These were wonderful!  Made exactly as written, but I did have to add a little more cornstarch to get it to thicken.  Will definitely make again.

I accidentally threw everything into the pan at once but it still turned out fabulous!  The adjustment/substitutions I made were I cut back on the brown sugar a bit since some reviewers mentioned it was too sweet, used a dash of grated fresh ginger (thank God I had it!) because I realized I was out of ground, and apple sauce because I realized I also didn't have juice.  My husband raved how delicious the sauce was!  I hate making changes but you do what you have to do.

Cooked these last night and they were very good.  I only rated 4 stars because my husband didn't like it.  He said with that much sweet there needed to be some spicy in it too.

This recipe was good, I didn't get to grill it though.  I just cooked the pork in the oven, cubed it, and then put it in the pan with the heated sauce.  Two teaspoons of cornstarch won't get it very thick, so if you want thicker sauce use more cornstarch or less water.  I also used a cheaper cut of pork and this dressed it up.

I had really high hopes for this recipe since it got a ton of great reviews, however it was lacking flavor big time. I marinaded the chops with the brown sugar/apple juice mixture (minus the cornstarch) for about 3 hours and basted them while they grilled. They were tender, but very bland. I won't be making this again.

The flavor was really good but I think I may have messed up the sauce. It didn't thicken at all so I couldn't use it as a dipping sauce and its a grill recipe which I tried in the oven and it took 50 minutes at 350. I may try again. Thank you for the recipe!

I followed the recipe but was underwhelmed.  The sauce would not thicken and tasted very watery.  I will try again but use *a lot* less water.  A full half cup of water is way too much for 2 tsp. of cornstarch.

I just wanted to say... this is one of the best basting sauces, I have ever used.  I don't care for regular BBQ Sauce unless it's on the sweet side.  As the Powers above me kinda kept me busy with a half acre of lawns to mow and 3 cocker Spaniels to bath... I forgot to put my Pork Chops in to marinate...  Then I found this recipe... YUM YUM....This is going to be a regular in my house hold when my grown children come to visit.  The only thing I did differant and it is only because I didn't have any was, I substituted the half cup of Apple Juice for a 4 oz (1/2cup)Apple Sauce and then just added maybe a Tablespoon more of water.  All these years of mixing flour and brown sugar to fry me some Pork Chops are Bye Bye now.   This beats it Hands down and so much easier.  I would also recommend this for any grilled chicken you might want to BBQ..  I can't wait to grill some Chicken breasts and give this another go...  5 STARS for a Fantastic Recipe...

Made this just like it was written and it was wonderful.  My hubby doesn't really like pork chops ate a 2nd helping and then asked for them in his lunch. I also made the cinnamon rice with apples and he like that too.  Used granny smith and it didn't break down at all.  Keeper!!

It took a long time for the glaze to thicken, about 35-40minutes. I used cold water to mix with the cornstarch. I will make these again, but next time, I will take the glaze off of the heat and let it sit for a few minutes. Also, it made a mess of the bottom of the grill. I suggest getting the glaze almost as thick as you want it before you start grilling the pork chops.

Tried this on both chicken and pork--split decision from my family whether it was better on either--try it and decide for yourself. Overall taste was good. I thought the sauce was going to be too sweet as I cooked it, but it was perfect after being grilled on the meat--not sure I'd use it as a dipping sauce, though.

I substituted Orange Juice for the apple juice (notably changing the core taste of the recipe) because I didn't have apple on hand. I also dropped the soy sauce due to salt restrictions on my diet. WOW, great flavor and very juicy. Thanks for the ideas!

These were good - not amazing, but good.  With the amount of corn starch called for, my sauce didn't thicken at all.  Next time I'd use more.  I ended up baking these and the sauce didn't really "stick" very well because it was really just liquid.  In the end, I pulled them out and stuck them on a pan in on the stove and finished them there.  The pork chops browned up nicely that way and the sauce stuck to the chops a little more.  It was raining so grilling was out.

Maybe I used the wrong cut of pork chops, but this turned out terribly. No one in my family liked it. Because of all the other people who liked it, I'm really thinking I did something wrong! Oh well.

Me and my husband loved it. Instead of using a store-bought apple juice, I used the fresh juice of a golden delicious apple. I also used gourmet Filipino soy sauce (Silver Swan Lauriat Soy Sauce) which is tastier than Kikkoman.

Thanks for sharing the recipe. I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and buttered sweet corn. It's amazing!

Really good, really easy recipe.  I recommend it to anyone, especially if you like a little sweet flavor.  The only modification I made is I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil - otherwise made it just as stated.

I'm not a pork chop fan so . . . . I thought they were ok.  However, the sauce itself was so YUMMY!  I was wiping the sauce off of my plate with all of my side items so I could enjoy it.

Juicy grilled pork chops? I didn't think it was possible! My husband always overcooks them, but with this recipe they were moist, sweet, JUICY and delicious! I only made one adjustment....didn't have apple juice so I substituted apple cider vinegar (as another suggested...great meat tenderizer!). I marinated the pork for 1 hour in half of the sauce and used the rest for dipping. Excellent!!!!

Will replace all of my other sweet pork chop recipes I have tried. This one is very good. Cook your chops as directed (to and internal temp of 160 degrees) and they come out so moist! Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I didn't have apple juice and substituted pineapple juice instead.  I also omitted the water and cornstarch and marinated the chops in the remaining ingredients for about 40 minutes before grilling. Yummy!  My 9 year old son couldn't get enough!  Thanks for a great recipe!

WOW!!!!!!!!!!!! this was so good, i mean great i am mad i only made 4 chops with this, i thought my pack had 6 darn it, I will say i do not believe in cooking meat with no seasoning, so i added some season salt and montreal steak season to my pork chops.  I then made the sauce i initally followed the recipe as is, but my sauce did not thincken so i added some more constarch and it did.  i then grilled my pork chops for a little before i added the sauce to them, I enjoyed every second of eating this pork chop.  i also use bone in chops, i just dont care for boneless i feel they just dont have the great flavor bone in offers.  This was so great, i mean awesome 10 all the way!!!

Enjoyed the glaze. Suggestion: If you own a gas grill, place the pork chops on the top rack over foil and allow them to cook this way. The sugar in the glaze worn char this way. For the last two minutes, remove from the foil and place on the botton rack so you can get those lovely grill lines.

This was delicious.  Because of other reviews saying it was too sweet, I cut the brown sugar by about half and it was the perfect amount of sweetness for us.  (If you're a fan of sweet, go ahead and use it all, though - I don't think it would be too much.)  In the cornstarch/ water mixture, I substituted 1/4 c. of the water for 1/4 c. of bourbon to give it an interesting flavor.  All the alcohol cooked out, so it was okay for the kiddos.  I served it with roasted sweet potatoes and steamed broccoflower and the supper was a hit for our family.

Very Good!  I spooned leftover juice over a side of white rice seasoned with salt and white pepper.  Very pleasant dish not overpowering in sweetness or taste.

Absolutely fantastic!  The sauce is so good.  I used healthy balance apple juice to cut down on the sugar content a bit.  I was so full but wanted to eat another chop sooooooooo bad but I resisted.  Make sure you save some sauce to pour over your chop just before eating.  I can hardly wait for leftovers.  Will make this often during grilling season for sure. This would be great on tenderloins too.  Thanks to ginastubbs.

I skipped the cornstarch & ginger and added a some fresh garlic and onion. I then brought all ingredients to a boil for about 1 minute. Used 3/4 to marinate with and the other 1/4 for basting. I marinated pork chops & chicken for 4 hours. Very good and not too sweet. Next time I will try marinating overnight. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

My family and I love brown sugar.  So I tried this recipe on pork and chicken.  I marinated it for about two hours. I normally don't like grilled pork chops but I loved them. I will be using this in my family for many years to come. My two year old even liked them. Thanks for such a great recipe.

This was really good. I made the glaze and put it in one of those oven bags with the chicken and baked it after browning the chicken a little on the stove. And as always I used seasoning salt to season the meat before any recipe.

Great dipping sauce!  I have grilled and baked this recipe.  With baking I brushed a little of the glaze on for last 5-10 minutes and cranked the temp up to about 450 and it added a little extra flavor

I used this recipe for chicken instead of pork chops. I used 3 boneless, skinless half-chicken breasts, and it turned out AMAZINGLY. This is my new favorite chicken recipe, and I can't wait to have it again. The sauce is UNBELIVEABLE. It is on the sweet side (for those of you who aren't fans of that) but I think it's perfect. I would definitely recommend this recipe to everyone!

These were great! I served them with Cinnamon Rice with Apples and green beans and it was one of my favorite meals ever! I had to bake them because it was too cold to grill successfully, but the flavor was great and they were very tender. I marinated them in some of the sauce for 60-90 minutes then basted them and served the remainder of the sauce on the side. Very sweet, but very good.

Delicious and very easy prep. No crazy ingredients- had everything on hand.  I thought the Jack Daniels substitute for the apple juice made the flavor so savory.

I used pork top loin and marinated (using everything except cornstarch & water) for a couple of hours before baking at 350 for 35 minutes. I quickly boiled the left-over marinade with 1 tsp of cornstarch to thicken and served it as sauce on the side. Great flavor!

Holy cow, the glaze was awesome.  If I could I would drink it!  I used the glaze on a different pork item I grilled.  It was on some rolled pork chops.  I dipped the chops in the glaze then put then on the grill.  I ended up with some beautiful glossy delicious chops.  Definately a keeper!

I just made this with bone-in loin pork chops.  I didn't have apple juice, so I used applesauce and omitted the cornstarch and water.  This was incredible!  Loved it!

Broiled instead of grilled due to bad weather.  Cannot wait to have this one on the grill.

I loved that this was fast and easy to make.  As for the taste, it got mixed reviews.  My husband said it was just 'good', I thought it was okay, my 7-yr old nearly licked her plate, and it was a struggle to get my 5-yr old to eat it.  I stuck to the recipe, just leaving out the oil and using a mixture of soy and worcestershire instead of all soy per others suggestions.

Delicious recipe!! I marinated the pork chops in the sauce for about 30 minutes before grilling and then heated the left over marinade with the corn starch and brushed it on the pork while it was cooking! It was very yummy everybody loved it! I will definitly make this again!

I had no apple juice, so I used an equal amount motts apple sauce.  Skipped the water and corn starch.  Consistancy was perfect for 2 chops.  Also added a tablespoon (or maybe two) of seagram's.

This was awesome-family loved it!  Easy & delicious! I had time to let the chops marinade for a couple of hours before grilling. Sauce was thin but I think that was the point of this recipe. It's supposed to be light & flavorful, not heavy. Thanks Gina,will make again!:)

I would have rated these a 2, but my DH liked them more than I did...so they get a 3.  I brined the chops in 1/2 cup apple juice and 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar for 6 or 7 hours first thinking that this would keep the chops a bit more moist while grilling....it didn't.  I'm not a big fan of boneless loin chops anyway, I always find them on the dry side.  With exception to the brining, I followed the directions exactly for the sauce and the end result was grilled porkchops without a lot of flavour.  The only saving grace was the sauce I'd reserved for dipping (with a very distinct Asian flavour I might add).  Without the sauce, the chops would have been really bad IMHO.  So in the end, it's very unlikely that I'll make again and for those of you who like their pork a little more moist...use bone-in chops.

My husband and I liked this.  It was sweet but not so sweet we didn't enjoy it on our chops and rice. We cut back on the oil by half.  Nice change from breaded and bbq chops.

As always, the sauce makes the dish.  This sauce is quite delicious.  Mine turned out much thicker than it should have using just 1/3 cup of milk.  Had to add another 1/2 cup. The mustard flavor was just right in my opinion, but if you are not a fan of mustard then cut down to 1 Tbsp.

This is my second time using this recipe. Originally, I used it with pork chops. This time, I used it with chicken breasts. Same amazing outcome. The only thing I did differently was I mixed up as a marinade-left out the water and cornstarch and  doubled soy sauce. I marinated the breasts for about six hours. They turned out tasty, tender and juicy. Another homerun from this recipe!

I’ve made these many times over the years and they’re my husband’s favorite dish of “mine”. I’ve also never used this as a marinade for grilled chops. I make the sauce just like the recipe, then add it to chops I’ve been sautéing and let it all cook for a few minutes. Then I drizzle it over the chops and mashed potatoes. Sometimes it’s too thin, other times too thick and almost jelly. But when I get it right, it’s the BEST. The chops are always so juicy and tender. Definitely recommend.

Enjoyed this sauce over a grilled pork tenderloin. Substituted 
2T whiskey (out of apple juice) and only 1T of oil, as someone suggested.  The sauce thickened after a lot of stirring and it was delicious along with mashed potatoes on the side. Next time I'd make 1 1/2 x the recipe. Perfect to serve when you don't have time to marinate.

They were good, however I didn't follow the recipe exactly, following other reviews, I also marinated them for several hours before cooking. I removed the chops and reduced the sauce, according to the directions. Very good, thanks for the recipe!

VERY sweet. I didn't have apple juice and someone said they used Jack Daniel...didn't have him either.  However, I had some whiskey that my boyfriend bought that we turned out we hated. It was a maple whiskey. It was a very sweet recipe! But it turned out pretty decent. I baked the chops in a glass dish for about 20 mins at 350 degrees in the sauce and then took them out to serve and it was better than I thought it was going to be.  I kept the sauce added some Worcestershire sauce, terrace sauce, white vinegar, and ketchup put it in a slow cooker with some left over frozen smoked shredded pork for another meal.  I will make it again, but adjust for the sweetness.

The wife and I both loved this recipe.  The only thing we did different was we put them on a cedar plank on the grill and cooked them a little longer because they were so thick and on the plank.  Cooked to an internal temp of 165.  But the sauce we did exactly as directed and couldn't be happier...yes, we'll do this again.  So moist and tender it was unbelievable.

I made this last night and the sauce was on the sweet side for me. I added some apple cider vinegar to cut the sweetness, and loved it. Next time I might try it without the apple juice and just go straight for apple cider vinegar.

I thought the recipe was wonderful and can't wait to try on the grill.  I have made it twice and both times seared the chops and baked them with the sauce.  To add variety, and spice, one time I added some red pepper flakes to the sauce and that made it tangy and sweet.  But is is really good the way it is written and I rated it based on that.

I was really disappointed with this recipe.The end result was a plain tasting pork chop with an overly sweet, watery sauce. Didn't care for the flavor, either.

I added my own twist to this recipe as well. I did 1 1/2 Tsp of soy sauce and 1/2 Tsp Worcestershire, then just a dash or two of jabenero hot sauce to give a bit of a kick, served with pepper and onion stir fry veggies sautéed with a few Tbs of the sauce and white rice and it was delish!!!!

I baked the pork chops, topped with sauce then ran briefly under the boiler.  Very good.

These just didn't work for us. Very bland for some reason. Couldn't taste any of the sauce. Was really disappointed on how the sauce didn't stick to the meat like I thought it would.

Amazing! Everyone who tried it really loved it! One thing I'd do a little different would be to make more basting sauce - more than what's recommended here. This is because I found that I was running out towards the end. This could be just a personal preference though. Definitely will be making this again.. and would recommend it to anyone! Grill on people :))

Lacking a working grill, I made these on a countertop griddle and they still turned out great; instead of brushing the sauce on at the last minute I just dipped the chops in the sauce before griddling them.  Keeping this!

The browns sugar sauce was very tasty. I did add 1/2 tsp. of jalapeno granules which I bought from myspicesage online and 1/2 tsp. of cayenne pepper to give the pork chops a kick. Loved them!

This is very very good. I make this in the oven. Put it under the broiler on low for 10min on each side or so. Very tasty.

Love the flavor! It was a hit with my 2, 4, 5 year old and husband. :) Give it a try! I used low sodium soy sauce. That was the only change.

These pork chops were incredible. My husband is quite the snob when it comes to food and he couldn't stop talking about the sauce for these. He ate 2.5 pork chops by himself. I will keep this recipe and use it as is.

Very sweet, too much so for my family, but a good place to start.  I used fresh ginger.  Next time I will add something to make it zippy (cayenne or red pepper flakes), a bit of sesame oil, and I'll cut the brown sugar or swap maple syrup for it.

These pork chops were good, but not great; they lacked "kick."  I have leftover sauce and am going to add garlic, hot sauce, or something to give the flavor a boost.

Very good recipe though I wish the flaor had sunk into the chops a bit more. Thinking I would like to marinate them alittle 1st then gril them with the sauce. Otherwise tasty and plan on making again.

Yummy grilled chops...marinated overnight and used olive oil instead of veg oil and decreased the brown sugar to 1/4c. Tender and juicy. Family enjoyed. Thanks!

This is a very good recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly and the result was delicious.  The sauce was runny which keeps me from giving it five stars.  Will marinade the chops in the sauce next time and see how that works.

Amazingly good! I didn't have apple juice so subbed Caprisun Fruit Punch, and it still tasted great (no noticable difference). Used fresh ginger and marinated the meat (2 thick chops) for 30 minutes. While the meat was grilling, I cooked down the reserved marinade/sauce and added the cornstarch. 
Kind of sad that my hubby won the coin toss and got to take the leftovers for his lunch today.

I am a vegetarian, but cook for my family (who are avid meat eaters) and they said they absolutely loved these pork chops. My fiance said they were the best pork chops she has ever had (and she is a picky eater).

First, LOVE the sauce! Very delicious.. and even without using garlic--I'm impressed! I followed the recipe to a T, but will say that the meat wasn't flavored enough by brushing the sauce on during grilling. I barely tasted it and the meat tasted dry and flavorless. However, when I poured the sauce over the pork on my plate it made a huge difference in the flavor of the dish. Therefore, I would advise making extra sauce (we followed your recipe but only cooked 2 butterflied pork chops, so we had extra sauce) so you can pour it on when the meat's done to enhance flavor.

While the pork chops were juicy, the flavor was not great in my opinion.  I marinated the chops for about 6 hours.  Thanks anyway.

This recipe is good. I made a few adjustments. First, I did not have apple juice… therefore I substituted it with blueberry juice. I also didn’t have any soy sauce so I substituted it with Worchester sauce. I baked them with the glaze for 20 minutes at 350 degrees. Very good!

Easy and tasty.  Works great on chicken marinated overnight and then grilled.  Did add some red pepper flakes for a little bit of kick

I saw the marianade suggestion so I did that.  However, I took a nap and didn't wake up until late evening so it marianated for 24 hrs!  I grilled the butterfly chops and re-boiled the marianade so it would be safe as a sauce.  Served it with rice pilaf and it is now one of my favorite recipes of all time!  Making it again today using the original recipe.

Delish!!! My 3 year old twins gobbled it up! If you do recipe exactly like the directions the sauce is so thick and delicious! Even my hubby said this recipe was a keeper! No need to marinade before hand, just do as the directions state.

I have used many recipes from allrecipes.com over the years but have rated only a few...and never this quickly. I made these pork chops tonight and they were amazing! My husband could not stop raving about them. He is normally not a big fan of pork chops, but he loved these, saying they are the best he has ever had. They were very tasty and very moist. I followed the recipe and directions almost exactly except that I made the sauce earlier in the day and used some of it to marinate the chops for a few hours before grilling. Great recipe!

My husband and I really liked this, and I wish I could give it a 5 rating.  However, the amount of cornstarch is definitely too little for the sauce, and we found that just brushing the sauce on the chops at the end of the cooking period wasn't enough to add any flavor to the chops.  We have put the remaining chops into the sauce to marinate until we eat them.  Next time I would marinate the chops before cooking (and before adding the cornstarch mix), and I would increase the cornstarch to one tablespoon and decrease the water to 1/4 cup.  I'm also thinking about doubling the soy sauce.  That should solve what we found to be problems.  We will definitely make this one again.
Made the recipe again, this time marinating the chops for a couple of hours, using the sauce for marinade.  Made a separate batch of sauce for serving, and doubled the soy sauce, which perfected the taste for us.  Also changed the cornstarch, as I suggested before and the sauce came out perfect.  The only other thing I would recommend is to leave the oil out of the sauce.  What I found was that the sauce thickened, while the oil floated on top.  With the changes I've made this recipe is a definite keeper and worth 5 stars.

You will never try another pork chop recipe after making this one!!!  It was awesome.  After reading the reviews, I marinated the pork chops in the sauce and then boiled the sauce to use for basting.   I've never tasted pork chops so good and so tender.  I used the apple juice but think the jack daniels suggestion would be good too. TRY THIS RECIPE!!!!

Not necessarily bad, but a bit too sweet and bland.  I even marinated before grilling.  I think it needs more soy sauce or something.

Love the combination of Brown Sugar and apple juice for the sauce!  I added a teaspoon of honey for a smoother sweet taste...very good. I love this sauce for grilling. Great for grilled chicken too!

I used pork country spare ribs instead of chops and it was amazing!!! I also wrapped a strip of bacon around each rib and then baked until done then broiled them to crisp the bacon.  Just amazing!!! I wanted to make more as soon as they were gone so I could have another one. :)

I've made this recipe about 5 times now, I marinate the chops for about 8 hours (while I'm at work) and then put them on the grill. The flavors are always good.

I make this all the time.  I use Merry Widow's modifications (cut water, sugar, cornstarch, halve the oil, up soy to 4TBSP) and marinate for about 3 hours.  I grill it with my stovetop cast iron grill pan.  It is the only way my husband wants me to make pork chops anymore.

I made this recipe subsituting pineapple juice for the apple juice and also I added minced garlic to the recipe. I didn't grill this instead I baked in the oven, it came out pretty tender, I would of liked to grill it but I didn't have time to do that. I liked the flavors and my whole family liked it!

I usually add a little more brown sugar and then marinade the chops in it for 6 to 8 hours then grill it.  The thinner the chops the better.  Very good recipe.

I really liked the unique flavor in this recipe; there was really too little of it (the flavor) though.  The sauce was too thin and didn't soak into or stick to the pork chops.  Next time, I'll try marinading it and not just brushing it one right before grilling.  I also would like to try some sliced apples in a tin foil pouch with the leftover sauce on the grill. That could be good with it.

This was a tasty, simple recipe!  My 4 year old gobbled up every bite.  I cooked them on an indoor grill.  This is a great recipe if you forgot to marinade your meat and need a meal pretty quick.  Next time I will try it on chicken.

Ordinarily I'm not real big on pork chops unless they're fried, but I agreed to try this because my wife wanted to.  I loved it! This is a dish we can serve to company as well.  I used a gas grill and cooked them with indirect low heat for about 20 minutes. Really tender and juicy.

What a great recipe! It has a teriyaki type flavor to it. It's very thick. We grilled and put the marinate on as it was cooking. Next time we will marinate it over night as others have recommended. This is a keeper.

This recipe is amazing!  I impressed my husband and even the kids loved it. I didn't have apple juice so I used apple sauce plus some apple cider vinegar and a little water. Perfect!  We are also going to try this on bone-in chicken.

Very good pork chops.  I marinated my chops for about an hour before grilling, and they were very tender and juicy, not dry at all.  We didn't think the sauce was too sweet, but my husband and I like that sort of thing.  I'm also going to try this sauce on chicken, as others have done.

A decent recipe. I probably won't make again. We did use for pork and chicken. It was OK.

I followed the recipe exactly. It was pretty good, I was just hoping that the chops would be more tender. We liked the extra sauce for dipping. I served this with white rice and corn on the cob.

My family has made this recipe twice now and it was even better the second time around! The sauce is absolutely to die for - we make extra sauce and pour it over our favorite sides of brown rice and broccoli. Totally delicious!!

Love the flavor of this glaze.  I marinated chops in a simple brine, then rinsed, grilled and glazed with this. Had no apple juice, so I used fruit cocktail juice and also used pickled ginger.  It was fantastic.  Saved the remaining glaze in a jar for future use.  May add 1 Tblspn cornstarch next time to thicken a bit more.  Thank you for posting this recipe.

Great change of pace added fresh minced garlic and onion powder. Maybe next time add a little cayenne or chili powder for some oriental flavor

Made this recipe as is and it was great.  We saved 1/2 the sauce to dip in and the other half we used to brush on the chops.  Delicious!

I did not have apple juice so after reading some of the other reviews, I decided (rather than running to the store) to try using liqueor in it's place.  I used Southern Comfort and it turned out a little too sweet, next time wiskey.  I marinated it for about 60 minutes before in the uncooked marinade.  The other addition I made was a little bit, maybe a pinch or two of cayenne to make it sweet and spicy.  My son does not like pork chops but really liked this recipe with my changes.

We thought it was very tasty.  I would like the sauce to be a little thicker.  I used apricot brandy instead of juice, added 2 tbl more brown sugar and chopped 1 clove of garlic.  Even the grandchilden loved it

I followed the recipe exactly except I marinated the chops for about 30 minutes before we threw them on the grill. My husband, who is incredibly picky, raved about these chops. My son also asked if he could wrap some of these pork chops up and take them to school for lunch, and he NEVER asks for sack lunch. Needless to say, I am sure we will be having these again sometime this week.

These were tasty chops according to the folks I cooked them for. The glaze made them look very pretty, too, with the nice grill marks. Resist the urge to peek and flip. Use a timer.

I was able to serve and wow the pickiesst of family & friends with this simple basting marinade.  Its perfect on the grill and carmelizes right to the chop - yum!  I didn't change a thing about the recipe but I did use our homemade apple cider.  I'm going to try it next with a bit of cinnamon added to see what happens then.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wow!  Made this for dinner tonight, it was amazing.  I don't even like pork and I ate a whole chop - my bf loved it!  Marinated the chops in apple juice about an hour before grilling.  Thanks for sharing!

I didnt have the brown sugar so I mixed 1/2 cup of honey and 1/2 cup of maple syrup. I also added a 1/2 cup of motts applesauce instead of the applejuice, cornstarch and oil. It was delicious! It came out thicker due to the applesauce and was a definite hit with the family. This will be a regular addition!

This recipe is awesome. I made this for my husband and he said it is the best thing I have ever made. I followed the recipe exactly except I did not have cornmeal so I used flour as a thickening agent instead. I also let the pork chops marinate in the sauce for about an hour reserving some of the sauce to baste with while grilling. We will definately be using this recipe in the future.

I was also very disappointed with this recipe and will not make it again. Still blah even with the garlic and some bourbon. Really can only taste the brown sugar.

I loved this recipe! I'd been looking for something different to do with pork chops - this was perfect.  I didn't think it was too sweet at all, but I did have to add a little more cornstarch to get it to thicken. I also marinated the pork for about 30 minutes with an apple juice/apple cider vinegar mixture per another reviewers suggestion.

I give this recipe a 5 star.  DELICIOUS!!!  Although I made several changes it still came out great.  I got some helpful hints from other reviews and put them together. First I used pork chops and chicken. Made the marinate w/about a cup or more of apple juice, almost 1/2 c of brown sugar and instead of adding  salt just added more soy sauce.  Also left out the pepper.  I marinated meat w/marinate for about an hr put it in the oven instead of grilled and brought marinate reserve to a boil adding the corn starch with little water to dissolve the corn starch. Made the glaze which was put on top of meats to serve.  Will make this again.

To cold to grill so I made this in the crock pot.  Excellent!  I made the sauce using all apple juice and no water, poured into crock pot and added pork chops and cooked for 4-5 hours on high.  Turning chops every 2 hours.  A hint of apples and not to sweet.  Will make this again!  Thanks for recipe.

It was just an o.k. recipe. We used the ingredients just as a marinade and it was decent tasting but i was NOT impressed.  Wouldn't make this again. Marinades you buy at the store have a much better flavor.

These were AWESOME!  My husband doesn't really care for pork chops, but he had 2 of them!  It was too cold out for grilling, so I simmered them in a skillet with the sauce.  Very tasty!

Very good. I also substituted Jack Daniels for the Apple Juice. I also had to substitute for the Ginger since I was out and I used 1/4 tsp of Thyme and 1/4 tsp of Savory. I baked them in the oven for 30 minutes at 350 but had to make adjustments due to 1st shift factory workers in my family. I left the chops in the oven for an extra 45 minutes at 250 and they carmalized and were still very very moist. Definitely a recipe keeper and can't wait to try it on the grill this summer. Great Recipe.

Everyone loved the sauce, most said it was like a sweet and sour flavour. Mine came out a litttle thin, next time I will add more corn starch.

My family loved this. I cut the sugar to just over 1/4 cup and used Wondra rather than corn starch.

Sauce was sweet, I think it should have been marinated first, then a sauce.

Great flavor, but next time I'll double the cornstarch, as the sauce was too thin for us.

This was really tasty. It was a little on the sweet side, but worth it. I marinated it for almost two hours and had some sauce on the side to dip. 
I will make it again.

I used chicken cutlets - It was delicious! I made 3x the sauce and added the corn starch right away to thicken it. I also added some chopped garlic and McCormic Montreal Steak Seasoning to the sauce. I put the chicken onto skewers and let it marinate in the thickened sauce for 3 hours. I grilled them and basted them 1-2x while on the grill - very good and not spicy - so it was kid friendly.

I used bone-in chops and the result was so good!  I love how the glaze gives a nice carmelized look to the chops after they are grilled.  I poured some of the glaze into a bowl to brush onto the chops while grilling and then when fully cooked I put them on a platter, heated up the remaining glaze, and poured it over the chops.  I followed the recipe as is except subbed olive oil (3 Tbsp.) for the vegetable oil, reduced the brown sugar just a bit and added some minced garlic.  Very good!

I've made a few pork recipes from this website, and this is the best so far. The sweetness is perfectly balanced with pepper and the natural saltiness of the pork. I made the following substitutions: I didn't have any applejuice, so I used the same amount of pulp-free orange juice instead. Also, I've have some pretty salty experiences with pork, so I left out the soy sauce and didn't add any salt. My husband, who usually rates things "pretty good" no matter what they taste like, proclaimed this pork "surprisingly delicious!" That's worth at least 5 stars to me! I will make this again, hopefully some day when I have applejuice.

The sauce is tasty (is there another use for it) but overall the pork is still bland.  Will stick to my store bought marinade.

Made the glaze exactly as the directions state.  It was fantastic.  We don't have a grill, so I just pan-fried the pork chops and they were still tasty.  Served with "Spinach and Beetroot Salad" from this site.  Excellent dinner.

After tasting the sauce, I decided it needed a little more flavor (thus the 4 star). I added fresh garlic and some red wine and some green onion. Made a salad of tomatoes, mozzarella and fresh basil to go with, along with cubed roasted (on the grill in foil packet)potatoes and grilled pineapple. YUM! Will make again, even for company.

I was so surprisingly pleased with this recipe. I don't have a grill; therefore I substituted with a cast iron grill pan, which worked perfectly. Will absolutely make again; can't wait to share with friends and family! Thanks for the recipe.

I made this recipe just as it was written and it came out great.  My husband and I really enjoyed this meal.  Be sure to mix the corn starch and water in a seperate container as directed.  I missed this step and I made a mess of the sauce and had to start over.  Lesson learned!

Very yummy plus quick & easy - four and  a half stars!  I was looking for a recipe I could do on the grill where I didn't need to marinate the meat first.  I made the recipe exactly as written except I substituted cinnamon for the ginger (I don't like ginger).  I also put salt & pepper on the pork before grilling it.  The key is not to overcook the pork - it gets too dry and bland.  We drizzled the sauce over top of the pork when it was served and my kids gobbled it up.  Even my 5-year old son, who very rarely has seconds on meat, at almost two pork chops himself!  Definitely a keeper.

These were great! I substituted the worcestershire for the soy as well and used cider instead of apple juice.  I also marinated my chops in cider as well for a few hours (since it was already out). Sauce is yummy!

This was a very, very good meal. My only recommendation is that if your making two pork chops make an extra serving because you are pretty much making a dipping sauce. We ran out of sauce but it was still delicious.

You've gotta try this one. Instead of soy sauce, I used worcestershire, and instead of ginger, I used cinnamon. Heavenly I tell ya. First time ever leaving a review, but this is sooooo good, I had to. I'm marinating a steak and I'm sure will be just as good. Can't wait.

Like other reviewers said, this is a very one dimensional recipe.  I left out the oil, substituted about 1/3 cup of Jack Daniels and put one whole jalapeno for a little heat.  That gave it the kick it needed.  My family loved it and I will probably make it again.

I think this sauce was just average.  I subbed fresh ginger for ground, but that shouldn't make a big change.  We found it really, really bland but with promise.  The second time I added several dashes of worcestershire sauce as well as a few tablespoons of balsamic vinegar.  Much better.  I'm not sure about the reviewer who used mustard and milk - I can't imagine milk ever being good in this!

This was so great! My son who is almost 6 loved it and he is a very picky eater. I didn't have apple juice in the house so I took another reviewers advice and used pineapple. I also added a little mustard.

I just finished eating these incredible grilled pork chops. And i altered the recipe  only a little bit. I added a little bit more soysauce, a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar and instead of ground ginger (which I am sure would have been fine) I used crytsalized ginger finely chopped. They were so juicy and flavorful. I used pork loin thin blade chops and grilled them for 5 minutes on teh one side then another 4 minutes on the other. I drizzled a little of the marinade on the side that wasn't cooking and a little salt. YUMMY

This was great!  It was moist and tasty, although I would probably brush the sauce on earlier in the process.  Even our girls liked it, and they're pretty picky.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I don't usually like sweet with meat, but these were pretty darn good!  I used boneless Iowa chops (about 1 1/2 inch thick) and added a dash of cayenne, then marinated them in the sauce to make sure the flavor got all the way through.  Broiled in the oven for about 7 minutes per side and served with boiled marinade for extra dipping sauce.  Yum!

I was pretty happy with this recipe. The consistency of the glaze was perfect for grilling, it stayed on to give flavor. I only added 2 Tbsps red wine vinegar to add some sour to the sweet. But I would add some spice to it next time, maybe cayenne. Very tasty change for plain grilled chops!

Sauce was terrific!  I even got my 3 picky eaters to have it (3 yo, 5 yo & husband!).  Sauce probably very good with chicken too!

This is a really good recipe.  However, I would probably baste the porkchops throughout cooking, rather than just at the end.

This was awesome!!  I never had pork chops this way and I really liked them with the basting sauce.  The grilled pork chops were very tender and juicy, I thought that they would become dry, but that wasn't the case.  The sauce was
great.  My husband and son really liked it.  Great recipe and easy too, thanks!!

Awesome - didn't have any ginger, cut the oil in half and added 2 T Jack Daniels and it was delicious. Sauce was thin but could've been caused by not heating it enough after adding corn starch.

Made as directed but realized partway through putting this together that I didn’t have ginger. It still tasted good but I look forward to making this when I do have ginger. I think I’ll give this a try with chicken. Thanks for sharing this.

Here I go.....Didn't have apple juice so I used apple sauce. Pam-sprayed a Pyrex dish, marinated the chops several hours and baked in the 350 degree oven. Delish! Served with yellow rice and it made a wonderful sauce for the rice. Will be making this often. Maybe my grill will be fixed soon and I can grill them next time.

This is fabulous!  Quick, simple - just pop  a side of broccoli and call it dinner in less than 30 minutes!  I opted to use organic coconut brown sugar (not packed) -  My guy could NOT stop talking about how good these were and he suggested using some red pepper flakes next time we make these for a little kick!

I liked the brown sugar flavor but it was a little bland.  I think if I were to make it again I would cut the water in half to make it thicker and more flavorful.

It was a very good recipe. My family liked it a lot. It is very sweet, almost like a Teriyaki sauce. I served white rice on the side and grilled pineapple. I also added one more tsp of cornstrach to the sauce to thicken it a bit more since I thought it was still a bit runny. The extra sauce was great with the rice.

I made this recipe for 20 at a family BBQ. I got a ton of compliments. I didn't really change anything major but I did make a few adjustments. I used 1 inch thick bone in chops and I prepped them with salt, black pepper and garlic powder about six hours before putting them on the grill. None of them were wasted for sure.

Easy to make. Didn't have apple juice so I substituted with apple sauce! Worked like a charm. Perfect dinner.  Was at Albertsons and I got a humongous deal on pork loin chops. 4 packs of 4 thick cut chops for only $17 all. Thanks for sharing.

I will definitely make this again as I did not get to have any, it was all gone by the time I was ready to eat. This was raved about by a 10 year old and grown man as a keeper recipe. I didn't change much, just used flour instead on cornstarch bc thats what i  had on hand.

We enjoyed the sweetness of this sauce and thanks to the  reviewer who suggested that this could be done in the oven. There is nothing worse than finding some delicious sounding recipes for the BBQ that I would like to try (no BBQ) so to see this worked in the oven I was very Happy! Didn't change a thing.

I used slightly less sugar and marinaded it in the sauce a while beforehand, but otherwise followed the recipe.  It was delicious and my family loved it, even the two of us who don't normally like pork chops.

I was looking for a recipe that did not require a marinade as my partner and I were already hangry after grocery shopping on empty stomachs. I didn't have apple juice nor did I want to use corn starch. I also only had 3 chops, so mine went down like this... I used 1/4 cup light brown sugar, I peeled a gala apple and tossed it in the food processor until it was apple sauce and used 1/4 cup of that, 2 tbps veggie oil, 3/4 tbsp soy, and smashed 3 small garlic cloves with a blunt mallet and tossed those in. I added a pinch of salt & pepper, and about 1/8 tsp red pepper flakes. I let that come to a bubble while stirring constantly until the sauce was a nice deep brown color. I pulled the garlic out and tossed it. I lightly salt & peppered the chops, brushed oil on the grill, and put them on for about 5-7 min per side. After the first flip, I added the sauce to them. Upon second flip, the sauce starts getting a char, so you have to be careful not to burn it. Flip again and sauce,  using the flame to evenly char the edges. We ate this with a kale, goat cheese, dried cranberry, and pecan salad drizzled with olive oil and grilled butternut squash. It was a great fall meal!

Tasted great! I did modify the sauce. I omitted the oil and ginger. Instead I peeled and chopped apple and cooked it a few minutes in some butter then added the apple juice etc as the recipe called for.  Not only was it great on the meat it also tasted wonderful on mashed potatoes.

Tried making this exactly as written. I did halve the brown sugar since so many people thought it too was sweet. The sauce never thickened, I boiled it for several minutes after adding the cornstarch mixture. The taste was ok, nothing spectacular. If I try this again, I'd use it as a marinade without the cornstarch and add some red pepper flakes.

Eh, maybe i did it wrong, but it didn't wow me. Need to find a way to make it a marinade or actually grill the chops basted first then grill it off. Waiting until the end to baste didn't allow enough of the flavor to get into the chops.

No great shakes.  Did not mind the sweetness but nothing that was too exciting.  We had very thick pork chops so perhaps the sauce did not permeate?  Marinate ahead of time?  I like the idea of using Jack Daniels.  :-)

I baked this because I don't have a grill at the moment. My husband and I couldn't eat it. I followed the recipe exactly and it didn't even look appetizing. It did not taste good at all. I even marinated the chops. They were tough and dry. Will not be making this again. Sorry :(

The glaze was somewhat thick even though I followed the directions exactly.  My family loved this, I found the glaze to be a bit chunky.  Perhaps it was the cooking method used, or maybe my grill wasn't hot enough.  Will definitely try again.

I added more sugar and juice but not salt as the soy sauce is high in salt. The reserve I added craisens and simmered until a little thicker and topped chop with it. Family loved it.

I made this recipe without the oil.  I brushed the sauce just before I took off the BBQ (approx. 3 mins).  I sliced the chop as they were 2 1\2" thick then lightly drizzled to sauce over the row of sliced meat.  Was amazing.  Would use the sauce on just about anything!

I really wanted to like this, but the whole family was disappointed. The sauce was missing something. It was a lot like sweet and sour, except without the sour to balance the almost cloying sweetness. Sorry, I won't be making this again.

I don't even like pork chops and I had 2 servings and my siblings complimented me a job well done considering they dont like pork chops either. Defiantly a hit in my book.

Great recipe overall! Modified it by not putting in the veg oil in the marinade and then letting the pork chops soak in pyrex dish with marinade for about 20 minutes while the charcoal grill was getting ready. Grilled first side of chops and then double basted the chops on the flip to the other side back in the dish.  Everyone loved them!

Tried this recipe last night and it was awesome! I didn't have any apple juice, so i just added a handful more brown sugar and used a half a cup of water. My sauce didn't thicken as much as i would have liked, and I ended up using almost double the amount of cornstarch! It was still a hit with my whole family. Also we used gluten free soy sauce to make this recipe gluten free, and the extra saltiness in the gluten free soy meant no one found it too sweet!

Didn't have any apple juice so I substituted apple sauce and followed the rest of the recipe pretty close. Wife raved about it and we were both ready to eat the sauce right from the bowl. Will serve again but will keep the applesauce substitute.

Yum! According to my husband, these were the best pork chops we've had so far this summer!!! Everything about this is perfect - the marinade is *just* sweet enough and complements the chops nicely. Do keep in mind that a good dose of s&p makes all the difference. I seasoned my marinade generously and am glad I did. Had I not, I think my chops would have been too sweet for my liking. A side of pasta with fresh tomato sauce (kelcampbell) was the perfect complement to our simple meal. Thanks SO much for sharing your recipe, Gina! I really enjoyed it! :-)

My son loved it! He is picky so that says tons. I would cut back on the oil as it kept serrating, would thicken the sauce more as well.

These chops were AMAZING! I marinated boneless chops in olive oil and some McCormick Pork Grillin' seasoning. Grill on low for about 8 minutes each side. Brush on glaze and grill for another 5-6 minutes on each side. Caramelizes to perfection!

I enjoyed these. The sauce was kinda weird for me because the oil kept separating. I think I would cut down on the amount used next time or omit it all together. Overall great flavor.

Absolutely Delish!  I seasoned my chops well with S&P and garlic powder as well as basted them with some of the thinned out sauce before grilling.  I only made half the sauce for three thinner chops and it was the perfect amount.  Added some garlic powder in the sauce and basted the chops on both sides right before pulling off the grill.  When serving, I poured the remainder of the thickened sauce over top.  The sauce was so flavorful and went so well with the pork.  This is definitely a winner in this house!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Thought this was a delicious last minute quick fix for pork chops.  I did it exactly as the recipe states... some people said it was watery, that is simply because it needs to boil longer... it took about 5 minutes to get a thick marinade.  My only criticism is that it needs a bit more flavor to balance the sweetness... so next time I will add more ginger (1-2 tsp.).  I think this would be awesome as a stir fry marinade with veggies!!

I agree with some of the other commenters - the sauce was a bit too sweet for my taste.  I ended up adding some Jim Bean BBQ sauce to the recipe to help take the sweetness down.  Next time I'll probably also cut the amounts in half.  I had a ton of sauce left over.

I forgot the soy sauce but it was very tasty over our pork chops. Added a tbsn of Dijon mustard. Would be fabulous as a reduction sauce too.

I recommend marinating the pork chops for a few hours before grilling so the pork chops absorb more of the delicious flavors.  This is the best pork chop recipe!

Very good. I marinaded pork chops and chicken breasts, separately, for about 30 minutes. Both turned out nicely. I would probably marinade chicken a bit longer, but it was delicious served over rice with a side of veggies.

This was okay. My problem with it was that the sauce was not a glaze, it never got thick and didn't coat the pork chop well. I think it would work well as a marinade, but as a glaze it just runs right off the pork chop. Not bad, but not especially great either.

I combined the sauce ingredients earlier in the day so it would be a little less prep. Once I made the sauce I added a little to the pork chops & let them site for a few minutes before I grilled them. They were great!! Very easy & flavorful. I only used 3T oil & next time I will cut it down to 2T.

OMG! The sauce is delicious! I made this and we all loved it. I am not a big fan of pork chops, but with the sauce it is so good! I saved the left over sauce to use on meatballs and lil smokies.

I will grill them next time! Next time I will also add more cornstarch so that the sauce will thicken better. I halved the recipe since I only had 3 pork chops. I baked in a foil lined (uncovered) 8x8 baking dish at 350 for 20 minutes with sauce on top and then flipped the chops over and baked another 15 or so minutes.

Made exact to the T...OUTSTANDING.  It's amazing how little ginger was used and how strongly it stood out among the other complimenting flavors.  This is one sweet zinger for the tastebuds.  Even picky hubby LOVED it.

Big  hit with the family - I can only imagine how jealous the neighbors were with the smells coming from the grill!!  The changes I made were apple cider vinegar instead of apple juice (didn't want it to be too sweet and wanted the vinegar to help tenderize the meat) and a heaping teaspoon of minced garlic.  I left out the cornstarch until the end, marinated the meat for a good 6 hours, then boiled the marinade with the cornstarch to thicken, basting as we grilled.  The result was very flavorful and tender pork!  Do not overcook!!  Use a meat thermometer of you may be disappointed!

I didn't have any soy sauce so I substituted worcestershire sauce instead and added probably two more tablespoons worth of sauce than it called for soy. I also added 1 Tbs K.C masterpiece BBQ sauce and let the whole thing marinade overnight. Other than that I kept the recipe the same and it turned out excellent. I always keep an extra bit of marinade in a seperate bowl to baste with during grilling and next time I make this (tomorrow for my cousins coming over) I will let the extra marinade set out of the fridge for a little while before grilling. It was almost too goopy to use with a brush. Great recipe, will keep using this!

My oldest son took one look at the recipe and said he was drooling... and all FOUR of my boys loved it.  The sauce was easy to make, and there's plenty of sauce to put some in a small bowl for basting while grilling, and then leftovers for serving.  We served sweet corn and cheesy pasta with this delicious dish!

Delicious!! I didn't have any apple juice so I used Jack Daniels like someone else suggested. We prefer olive oil to vegetale oil so I made that substitution. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly. My husband and I have NEVER tasted pork chops this good! It was so easy to make and will definitely be making again - perhaps even for my mother in law.

I've used a variety of recipes like this, and out of necessity substituted oj for apple juice.....OK.  I might have added some pineapple on a skewer sprayed with a butter spray and sprinkled with tarragon.  I have to say, the outcome tonight was among the tenderist pork I've ever eaten.  Started with a bargain Pork Loin, sliced some into 3/4 - 7/8" chops and some larger for small pork roasts.  Used the thick chops tonight.  And I'm using this heavy cast iron skillet with ribs on the gas grill.....get it VERY hot......I bet I cooked the first side only 2:30 or less, and the second side 1:30.....wonderful grill makes, done through......and melt in your mouth tender.....

I gave this recipe two stars because it has potential to be delicious. Other than reducing the number of portions, I followed this recipe to the letter. It came out very watery and did nothing to add to the flavor of the meat.

An easy and trusty recipe! I have made this many times.  It's easily adaptable -- if you're feeling garlicky, add some; if you're feeling spicy, add some cayenne.  You really can personalize this recipe to your tastes and still get great results!

I am not a huge fan of pork chops but I thought that these were good. I grilled the chops on medium for a longer time. The sauce was tasty. While eating I kept thinking "sweet and sour." Probably will make again. Might try the sauce on chicken.

These were good. I substituted Jim Beam for the apple juice. It would also help to let the sauce cool a little because it does thicken as it cools.

Great chops!  I substituted pineapple juice for the apple.  They were a bit sweet, but nice flavor.  I had way more sauce than I needed.  A little goes a long way.

Very yummy.  The whole family loved it.  I don't have a grill so I baked them in the oven as suggested by some of the comments.  It took my chops over 30 minutes at 400 degrees to lose the pink in the middle though.

Delicious recipe!  My kids liked it and they are very picky.  I think it would also be good for grilled chicken.

I could drink the sauce it's so good!  Tried Jack Daniels instead of apple juice and was in heaven.  Great recipe!

I thought it was good a little sweet. I would lesson the amount of sugar next time. Hubby did not care for them.

Yummy! I did not have apple juice so replaced with orange juice. Worked great. I let marinate for an hour and only grilled for a few minutes on each side (thin chops). Will make again.

This was a great dish! Loved the sauce, didn't find it too sweet at all. The only change I made was to cut the oil in half.

The chops still need a marinade or the glaze just doesn't add enough flavor unless you go thick thick thick with it.  It is quite sweet but offsets the pork nicely.

I love this recipe. Its a new favorite for pork chops. My son loved them and said they were the best ever and he is a very picky eater. Oh, I also marinated in for a couple hours.  Next time, I will add pineapple though! I think I may try this with chicken today!

I love this recipe. I never have apple juice so I do use apple cider vinegar instead. I'm not so certain I'd adore this recipe like I do with the juice but with the vinegar, it is fantastic.

I was pretty disappointed in this recipe. But to the recipe's defense, I had my 17 yr old. make the sauce. Maybe she measured incorrectly? The sauce was watery and sugary. I added garlic powder, pepper flakes and regular pepper and it boosted the flavor a bit. I will try this again, this time all on my own!

This recipe still worked great for me, despite my limited cooking skill!  I learned a few things from this: george foreman grills do not substitute for a real backyard grill (it's all messy with burnt sauce), and there's a reason you put corn starch in water (oops!).  I didn't have apple juice, but i had a ton of apples!  I just cut an apple up and let that boil in the sauce instead (adjusted for two people).  Despite my mishaps, it turned out well!  Can't wait to try this the way it's meant to be next time!

I did change the method by baking for 20 min at 350. The flavor was just not there. I could hardly taste the sauce, probably because I didn't baste the meat while cooking. I will try this again using the recommended grill.

I'm very late in writing this review, I've made this probably 4 times since finding the recipe.  This is very, very good and easy to make.  I use orange and pineapple juice (1/4 C each) instead of the apple juice that the recipe calls for and it comes out perfect.

It was extremely good! Everyone in my family loved it. I thought it was a little sweet, but it was much better with the pork, it canceled out any sweetness that was too strong. It definitely deserved 5 stars!

Very good chops that have a nice light asian inspired flavor. I marinated these overnight. The mix of the apple juice and the brown sugar really enhance the pork flavor. Thanks.

This is an easy, tasty recipe for pork chops on the grill. I was worried that they would be dry, so I made a marinade of soy sauce, apple juice, water, salt, and pepper, placed the pork chops in a large plastic bag, poured the marinade over, and put it in the fridge overnight. This really helped...the pork chops were nice and juicy! I did feel that the sauce was a little runny, though. Next time I make these, I will certainly add a little more cornstarch. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Very good recipe and enjoyed by the wife.  Easy to make too.  I didn't marinate and went right by the recipe.  Did baste the pork chops while on the grill.  Cooked them up to about 145 degrees and were very juicy.  I took some homegrown tomatoes and cut them into large wedges and threw them on the grill too.  The flavor of the tomatos with the pork chops was fantastic.  Give it try!

This was very yummy! I'm not a big fan of pork chops but my husband is. I read the reviews on this and said it's worth a try.  I followed one reviewers tip, did not use water, salt, cornstarch, halved the oil, increased the soy sauce and marinated the chops for about 30 mins.  It was divine! If my husband ever wants pork chops again this is the only recipe I will be using.

Blah--I thought the kids would like it because of the sweetness but only 1 out of 2 did and it was too sweet for me and my husband.

This was a good way to prepare pork chops, but fairly boring. I actually let the pork marinade in the mixture for about 4 hours before grilling it. I also added some garlic, just to spice it up a little. The pork was good, however, I'm not sure I would make it again.

Very good. The only changes I made were instead of using apple juice and soy sauce I used 1/2 cup of teriyaki sauce. My husband loved it!

I have made this a couple of times. My very very picky 9 year old loves it. He ate 2 pork chops. I usually double the sauce to pour over white rice.

I followed this recipe but cut in half and it seemed really oily and bland.  I dumped it and made a bbq sauce instead.

This was ok.  The sauce never thickened and it didn't blow me away by any stretch of the imagination.  It was pretty average.

I started to grill these but had to stick it in the oven because I didn't have enough charcoal in the grill and it started to rain. Finished off in the oven at 350 degrees for about 110 minutes (estimated).

Will make again! But after reading other reviews I was expecting this to be REALLY sweet and it wasn't.  I felt it just hinted at sweetness.  I followed the recipe nearly exact.  I omitted the water.  Marinated for 1.5 hr. then basted while on the grill.  Nice change of pace!

Super easy and tasty too. I doubled the soy sauce and ginger so that it wouldn't be as sweet. I also just spooned the sauce over the pork once it was plated. There was a bunch of leftover sauce, so I refrigerated it to serve over chicken another night.

I loved these pork chops on the grill.  I followed another reviewer's suggestion and added 2T. of whiskey.  I didn't have Jack Daniels, so I used Jim Beam (not sure what the difference is...)  I do wish that the glaze were a little thicker so I think that I will double the amount of cornstarch next time.  Great recipe though, thanks!

Very easy and pork chops tasted great.  Found this recipe at the last minute, thankfully 8 hrs of marinating was not required.  I used vegtable stock instead of apple juice (didn't have on hand). Will make again.

This was just too sweet for my own personal preference.  My husband and I are not huge fans of pork chops but my parents are and eat them often so we're always trying new recipes to please both parties.  Sadly this tastes just like a sweet pork chop, which did not please, but thanks for sharing!

It was ok.  The marinate didn't really add any flavor to the pork chops after 2 hours.  I chose the 4 TBLS soy sauce over the corn starch version and just wasn't impressed...won't likely make this one again.

I made these tonight and they were quite tasty. I marinated them for an hour and a half in the apple juice marinade (left out the corn starch), then added greek seasoning, salt and freshly ground black pepper beofre throwing them on the charcoal grill. I took the remaining marinade and heated to boiling and served along with the chops. My children, who have food allergies to almost everything (wheat, dairy, eggs, nuts, etc.) gobbled them up. My husband said it was his favorite marinade for pork, hands down. I thought they could use a little something extra, but they were so tender, they hit the spot. Served with homemade oven potatoes and a stirfry of asparagus, yellow pepper, leeks, garlic, onion and a splash of soy sauce. YUMMO!

Excellent recipe! Not too sweet, either! My pork chops came out tender, moist, and flavorful. Next time, I will simmer the sauce much longer to thicken it up, as the sauce was way too thin. But, all in all, a great new recipe to use on grilled pork chops. Thank you for sharing!

delish!  fantastic recipe.  thank you!  i made it exactly as stated.  makes a lot of marinade, more than necessary for 6 pork chops.  could probably halve it, or save the left over for chicken in a couple days!  i did have to add more cornstarch to thicken it up more, but thats the only change.  enjoy!

I don't know if it really fair to give a mediocre rating to this recipe because I cooked it in the oven instead of the grill, so it might have turned out better on the grill but I found it overly sweet.  I wouldn't redo this one, at least not in the oven.

Sauce was extremely in your face sweet-we prefer a more subtle, well blended flavor. Sauce, as written, didn't thicken at all. Added a tad more water w/2 more tsp of cornstarch & it thickened a little. You'll have to play w/it in order to be able to use it on the grill. The reviewer who suggested marinating in apple cider vinegar/apple juice is right on!! Made the chops sooo tender! I'll definately use that method in the future!

This was just okay for me. The flavor wasn't bad at all, but it just didn't have enough 'pop' for my tastes. I might try this again sometime because it was really quick to throw together and get on the grill, but I have to go with just 3 stars for now. Thanks :)

This recipe was easy and delicious.  My husband who does not like pork chops liked this and said it was a keeper!  I did marinate the chops in 1 part apple cider vinegar and 1 part apple juice as suggested by another reviewer, and this seemed to make for juicier chops.  Thank you for the recipe!

Yum.  I made them with very thin chops and they tasted dry.  I would recommend using thicker ones.

The sauce was perfect for chops.  The ginger gives it unique in flavor.  Carefully cook chops on grill and brush on the sauce.  Very simple, very good.  Server with "The Best Mashed Potatoes"

I give this a four star because my kids did not like the sauce (they thought it was waaaay too sweet). My husband and I enjoyed it immensely, and couldn't wait to gobble up the leftovers. :D What we did differently due to our picky eaters is to place the sauce in a gravy boat and let everyone choose if they wanted the sauce or not. Weirdly, the kids loved the sauce on top of their salads. Go figure.  Enjoy!

We make this regularly in our house. I don't always have apple juice, so I have substituted with hot spiced cider by the glass. We also marinate ahead of time instead of waiting to apply during cooking. It is SO delicious and has made us look forward to grilling pork chops again! The kids love it too!

These were interesting but I think we will be either excluding the ginger and giving it another try or dropping it all together. None of my 5 family members were crazy about the mix of flavors, although we enjoyed the apple and sugar flavor. Not sure on this one.

I gave this a 4 star rating - because I had to make adjustments so it would really have good flavor.  I used peach juice in mine and used garlic and Cayenne Pepper as well.  Next time, I am going to use some Bourbon.  It's a recipe worth keeping and making uniquely your own.

This was pretty good, but I thought the flavor was bland.  I think it needed some spice.  I will most likely make again, but add something to it.  Also, just an odd note- the leftover sauce gels when refridgerated and does not ungel(if that is even a word) when reheated. It does not affect the flavor, just makes it a bit odd to eat.

I actually used the suggestion to bake it since didn't have the time to start up the grill and do it the right way.  It still turned out pretty good.  And actually got a complement out of it, as well as someone asking for the recipe.  Good one to try.

Made in oven because grill is covered in snow. Thought it was a bit bland, but I know oven isn't the best method for cooking chops anyway. May try again in the spring.

Delicious and easy.  I had to bake mine, my griller wasn't home.  Baked at 350 for 30 minutes turned them over baked for 30 minutes more.  Tender, juicy and tasty.

Awesome! Our family loved it! I doubled the recipe and marinated the meat for about an hour while I prepared the rest of our dinner then cooked on the George Foreman grill which worked just fine. Definately will "repeat" this recipe! JP

Gotta Love this site.  The recipee and insight on ways to improve it!  This was a wonderfull recipee even though I did not have all the ingredients on hand, and had to substitute pineapple for the apple juice.  I think that it actually made it better. I marinated the pork for a couple of hours, and then seasoned the meat just before putting it on the grill.  The Hubbie said that it was "pretty good", which is good coming from a man who generally says nothing without being hit over the head with a frying pan!  Used the extra sauce (with pineapple chuncks) on rice.  Fantastic!  Will make this again and again, and may adjust it for potlucks.

This was not good at all!  I marinated the pork chops for about 30 minutes and they were just bland. Sorry.

I was very disappointed with the recipe.  I followed the recipe as written and while the pork was moist it wasn't flavorful.  My family loves pork chops....but not done this way.

I was hesitant to cook the pork chop after I tasted the marinade, but I gave it a try anyway.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The pork chop was nothing but bland with a hint of sweetness.  I ended up throwing the dish away and tried to come up with a quick replacement dish for dinner.

I was really excited to make these pork chops, but was disapointed. My fiance and Mother thought they were very good, though. I didn't think they had much flavor at all.  I do have to admit, they were very moist. Maybe I'll try again and let them marinade overnight.

Hubby said these were the best pork chops I ever made, and I have made some darn good pork chops.  Left out a few things I didn't have like cornstarch and ginger, and used teriyaki instead of soy.  Also did not grill, but probably will next time.  This recipe is a keeper!

Our family loved this recipe! I was a bit nervous about the apple juice in it, but it turned out awesome! The only thing that we will do the next time is to double the recipe of the sauce and marinade it overnight. Awesome recipe! ** For those of you who have the restaurant "Ono Hawaiian BBQ" near you -- this tastes almost exactly like the sauce they have there. **

These came out pretty good, although I had trouble getting the sauce to thicken. I added an extra tablespoon of corn starch before I was done. The flavor was great and we'll use this again.

These were good.  I always use thick bonesless chops, and they always turn out very juicy.  I also brined them ahead of time.  The sauce was great!

Superb!!! My family & I loved it!! I did accidentaly write down the recipe wrong though; I put in 2 tablespoons of cornstarch instead of 2 teaspoons, but it was still great! The sauce even gave me a few more ideas on what i could use it with. I "WILL" definitely be making this again!!!

My family really loved this recipe.  I made the sauce around noon and let the chops marinate about 5 hours.  Then I basted them as they cooked on the grill.  My only change next time I make this will be to half the oil--you just don't need that much.

I used chicken for this recipe, and it came out great.  Per other suggestions, I halved the oil, added 1 tbsp of soy sauce, added 2 tbsp of rum, omitted the water (except for 2 tbsp to dilute cornstarch), and added fresh garlic, cayenne pepper and hot pepper flakes.  I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, and onion powder, put in a baking dish, covered and baked the chicken at 350 degrees for 1 hr 15 min.  Came out great and everyone loved it!

Not at all difficult. Used on pork chops and chicken for the non-pork eaters. Seemed to go over OK, but perhaps too sweet for some tastes. Thanks for the recipe!

I made the recipe as is, except I used grated fresh ginger. It was excellent. I didn't think it was overly sweet, I thought it was a great blend of flavors and kept the chops juicy adn tender. My boyfriend insists that I make it again.

This was a great, quick and easy meal. I made the sauce as listed, expect I added some cinnamon and a little extra apple juice for flavor. I baked the chops in the sauce in the oven at 350 for 45 minutes instead of grilling. Perfect. The sauce yeilds quite a bit, which is great if you have a side to absorb it (or even some extra chops).

I made this last night for my boyfriend and I.  I don't have a grill so I followed the advice from some of the other members on how to make this in the oven.  I marinated 5 bone-in pork chops for several hours in 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar and 1/2 cup apple juice.  Then I baked the chops in a glass baking dish for 20 minutes on 1 side and about 10 on the other.  (I think next time I will try 10 minutes on each side and see if the chops are even more tender.)  At the very end of the 2nd side's baking time, I poured the brown sugar sauce in the baking dish, covering the chops.  Then, I set my oven to Broil and baked an additional 5-10 minutes.  
I thought it turned out okay but I later realized that I may have cheated myself on the sauce.  (I made the sauce as is, only changing from ginger to cinnamon and skimping on the oil and water to avoid a watery sauce.  MAKE SURE YOU LET THE SAUCE STAND FOR A WHILE AFTER BAKING TO ALLOW IT TO THICKEN!)  My boyfriend, who is usually full of constructive criticism, had no pointers for improvement; he liked it as is and said that he wouldn't mind it being in the regular rotation!

Very good sauce -after reading the reviews of others I cut the brown sugar, since we didn't have apple juice I used pineapple juice which was very tasty. I also recommend marinating the chops for two hours in soy sauce & lime juice --good flavor,very tender and moist. Next time I'll wrap the chops in bacon, remove the bacon a few minutes before the chops are done & then baste with the sauce or maybe use this sauce on a grilled pork tenderloin just for variety.

This was good.  I marinated the pork chops for 3 hours in the sauce (minus the water and corn starch).  I boiled the the marinade, basted my chops as they were grilling, then added the water and corn starch to what was left in the pot.  I had a nice glaze but it was VERY sweet (too sweet) so I added more soy, a dash of garlic powder and a splash of worchestire to it and was happy with the out come.  I will probably cut back on the brown sugar next time.

Made this for company over the July 4th weekend. Really really good! I followed the other advice & marinated the chops for several hours w/ 1/2 apple juice & red wine vinegar because I didn't have the apple cider. Definately serve it w/ Cinnamon Rice w/ Apples! I used a Fuji apple. Next time I will make this w/ country style pork ribs! Yummy!

I love this on the grill!  Great for summer.  Followed the advice of another and marinated chops in 1 part apple cider vinegar and 1 part apple juice since they tend to dry out on the grill.  They were great.  This is perfect served over rice.

This recipe wasn't good or bad.  It didn't have any flavor.  I followed the directions exactly except for using fresh grated ginger instead of powered.  This recipe was not a hit at my house.

This was great!  I followed the recipe exactly and let the pork chops marinate for about an hour and then basted as it grilled.  The chops came out flavorful and moist!  Will definately make this again!  Thanks for sharing!

These were good although I had trouble getting the sauce to thicken.  I used the correct amount of cornstarch and water.  I tried it again to use as a glaze on grilled ham steaks and again it didn't get thick.  But it does have a very good flavor and adds a new twist to chops and ham.

Made this last night and it was amazing! I adjusted to 1/4 of the soy and made up the difference with worcestershire; I also used cinnamon since I didn't have ginger. I marinated for about 20min before putting on the grill then added the cornstarch and water to thicken up the sauce! It was a hit and will be a new favorite.

Very tasty.  The weather was too bad to cook this on the grill, so it was in the oven... Still came out very well, but I think it would be even better on the grill.  Will keep and do this one again!

I tried marinating these in the sauce first, but it didn't seem to add enough flavor.  I re-boiled the sauce while the chops cooked and added the cornstarch.  Then I poured it over the meat when it was served and it was delicious.  Went very well with the Cinnamon Rice with Apples.

At first I was sugar about the different ingredients in this one, but I am soo glad I took a chance. It is quite a nice change from the tradional breaded chops I usually make.. My husband loved this recipe and told me I better make them again!

I placed the pork chops on a roasting pan and placed them in the oven under the broiler for nine minutes on each side and they came out wonderful.  I also dipped them in the sauce just before placing them in the oven and also when they came out.  My wife and I loved them.

I made this for my family and I had to dump it and make mac and cheese.  We are not picky eaters but I felt like I ate pork with apple juice poured on top of it. Way to sugary. Thank you for sharing though!

Very good, quick and easy.  I cooked the chops (cut from a boneless pork loin) on the stovetop.  We'll definitely have this again and I'll try the sauce with chicken, too.

These were wonderful!!  I doubled the sauce recipe and poured over the pork chops when I served them.  I found making potatoes was a great addition to the meal.  I also added a little Bourbon which was a nice addition.
