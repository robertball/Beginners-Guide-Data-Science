I can't give this 5 stars because of two things: the amount of sugar (it does not actually need ANY sugar at all) and the baking instructions, which should have mentioned that the water for the water bath must be scalding hot, otherwise it'll take longer to cook.  Those changes aside, this is a wonderful recipe.  Lovely with a scoop of ice cream.  One other minor issue is that the chocolate chips like to sink to the bottom.  Next time I may put half the bread mixture into the pan, add a layer of chocolate chips, add the rest of the custard, then the rest of the chips.

This was soo yummy.  Really good for using up old bread and over ripe bananas.  I doubled the amount of chocolate chips and used torn up cinnamon raisin bread and half a loaf of old french bread.  I also added a cup of chopped walnuts and a sprinkle of cinnamon and nutmeg.  I put this in a glass 9 X 13 at 325 and it only took 40 minutes to cook.  Better than homemade oven fresh chocolate chip cookies.  I will make this for company.

I thought the idea of chocolate banana bread pudding sounded great.  Then I read the recipe and saw that there was only one measly cup of chocolate chips in the recipe.  I searched further and found another recipe that was needlessly complicated, but it had one idea I liked, and that was to toss the dry bread cubes with 1/4 cup of melted butter, and then toss that with the 1 cup sugar and 1/2 cup of cocoa.  I increased the bread to 6 cups, and the milk to 3 cups.  I added vanilla and one more banana, then baked this in a 9 by 9 baking pan for 35 minutes.  It came out beautifully, rich and chocolaty, but not really too close to the original recipe.  It needed way more chocolate to satisfy my craving.  Oh, I also used one whole package of chocolate chips instead of one cup.

I made this with no chocolate, the gnarly black bananas that I keep in my freezer for banana bread, the equally gnarly stale bread ends that I keep in my freezer for stuffing, lots of cinnamon/nutmeg/clove, and 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of a cup of white.  Breakfast of champions.  Bet it'll be really good with maple syrup, like a banana pancake.  (I wouldn't recommend syrup with the full amount of sugar though, it'd probably taste like a lollipop.)

I, just like another reviewer, was trying to find an alternative to banana bread to use up some ripe bananas I had. I am really glad that I found this recipe.  I added cinnamon and a touch of nutmeg which gave it depth and, although I am a huge chocolate fan, I would have preferred raisins to chocolate chips in this bread pudding.  I also mashed up an extra banana in the egg and milk mixture.  This made the pudding even moister and gave more banana flavor.  I will definately be making this again.

It's to die for pudding!  Perfect combination of milk, french bread, banana and choc chips.  I loved it so much that I had to make the second batch on the same day!  Thanks for your sharing this.  Please add to the last line that it will take 1 hour to bake.

(UPDATE 2008: Had a new idea for Thanksgiving, to use 3/4 cup canned pumpking in place of the bananas for a holiday treat.  WOW...SUPERB!)

I stumbled upon this recipe looking for a way (besides banana bread) to use overripe bananas.  Instead of adding sliced bananas...I put mine in to blend with the egg/milk mixture.  I just may never make banana bread again.  What a treat.

This is even better the second day!  It's great both warmed up or cold with a glass of milk.  I made most of the changes as recommended by the reviews of others:  left the sugar out (the over-ripe bananas and choc. chips made it plenty sweet), added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, included 4 mashed bananas with the milk/egg mixture and 1 sliced banana, increased choc. chips to 1-1/2 cups (layer some in the baking pan).  I baked it in an 11x8 pan @350 for 45 minutes and it turned out perfect (no water bath).  I also made it using a combo of whole wheat crusts and whole grain dinner rolls (and 1% milk). Good stuff.

I made this last night for 4 people (half quantities). It's good - but very filling, so small portions are advised. I really got 5 servings out of it. I cut the sugar down too from 1/2 cup to 1/3 and it was still very sweet. Next time I'd use less sugar still. It's very quick to prepare - about 10mins tops.

I made this on Valentine's Day for a quick, sinful treat and it was absolutely delicious! Crispy bread crust with a gooey, thick custardy filling packed with banana flavor and swirled with rich dark chocolate. Since it's just the two of us around here, I halved the recipe and baked in two 12 oz. ramekins. I baked in a water bath as instructed (be sure that the water you add is hot). This bread pudding turned out so gorgeous! The only thing I changed in the ingredients was to use only half the amount of chocolate chips indicated (which is not usual for a chocoholic like myself, but it looked like A LOT of chocolate for the size of the bread pudding). I mashed the bananas with the liquid ingredients and would recommend doing so. We LOVED the end result and there wasn't a morsel left. Thanks for this fantastic recipe! Will make it again and again! :)

This was outstanding!  I left out the chocolate and added golden raisins, added a third very ripe banana (mashed) to the liquid mixture and grated in some fresh nutmeg.  I also used 1/2 cup of light brown sugar and 1/4 cup of regular sugar.  Served it with a caramel bourbon sauce.  Everyone gobbled it up!

I've made this recipe at least a dozen times. I like it with 1/2 a cup of sugar and 1/2 cup of chocolate chips. Try it with 3 large croissants instead of the french bread. I reserve extra chocolate chips, melt it in a ziploc bag in the microwave, and cut a corner and drizzle it over the top to make it prettier. I always leave out the water bath, since I don't think it makes a difference.

I made my first batch with the sliced bananas, and my husband wasn't too crazy about the cooked sliced bananas.  The second batch I pureed the bananas in the milk and eggs, and he liked it much more.  So, I recommend that if you don't like the bananas baked, puree the bananas before you add the milk and eggs.  I love the flavor of bananas and chocolate, so this will be one of my favorite recipes.  What an awesome recipe!

Yummy but did make the following changes: used croissants, mashed the bananas, reduced sugar to 3/4 cups and added 3 TBS of rum.

I made this for my dad on a whim but changed the ingredients to suit his diet. I very rarely cook anything and was happy that he loved this so much. I replaced the french bread with gluten free fruit bread, the milk with soy milk, used dark chocolate chips (dairy free) and I didn't use the sugar, instead used a dash of maple syrup (which was a good move as this dish was sweet enough as it was). Great recipe, very easy to make and would be happy to make it for him again! Will also be making it for ourselves, with another twist on the ingredients. Thanks for sharing this :)

This turned out awesome, even my sister, who doesn't care for bread pudding liked it.  I only used half the sugar, added some cinnamon, some walnuts, a little dash of nutmeg and smooshed the bananas up with the milk and egg mixture.  I baked it at 325 for 40 mins exactly in a 13 X 9 dish.  DELICIOUS!!

This didn't come out well. The bread was tough and very chewy once completely cooled. I used mini chips and the chocolate took the flavor away from the bread and banana. I brought it over to a family gathering today, and only a few pieces was eaten. Won't dare make this again.

Let me start by saying I don't like bananas and I've never made bread pudding.  In fact, the only bread pudding I've ever eaten is at Oaklawn Race Track in Hot Springs, Arkansas, which is famous for its bread pudding.  The bar was set very high, needless to say....  This bread pudding turned out perfect.  I made it exactly as written, except--as others suggested--I used 1/2 cup chocolate chips.  It's February, and I'm already planning my Thanksgiving dinner around it.  I also topped it with Creme Anglais, which was the perfect touch.
UPDATE:  Once I used the whole amount of chocolate chips and it ruined it.  DON'T FORGET TO HALF THE CHOCOLATE CHIPS.

I mashed the bananas with the sugar/eggs/milk and poured over broken up bits of bread. I also didn't put the dish in another dish of water..I placed the glass (greased) dish straight into the over like other bread pudding recipes and it was great.

I gave this recipe a 3/5 rating as a good base recipe but I also did not follow it exactly. What I learned about this site is that most of the recipes can be tweaked to your liking for a better result. Many of the recipes that I followed exactly were a bit disappointing.
What changed was I used mini chocolate chips instead of the standard size. I also used 3 small bananas and decreased the sugar amt to 2\3 c. I also added some nutmeg and cinnamon to taste.
In the directions, it says to cut the bananas up and mix them in, however I pureed the bananas in a blender until smooth and then added eggs, milk, sugar, vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg to the mix. While mixture combined, I put the bread pieces in the baking pan and then when the liquid was ready, poured the banana mix over the bread. I sprinkled some chocolate chips over the mix and let set for 5-10 min then baked. 
The banana pudding came out awesome! Not too sweet and every bite had a little banana taste. I would recommend blending the bananas in a blender first so as to get a smooth texture.

Pretty good; I followed the advice of another review and layered the mixture, adding the chips on top of the layers.  My family was not wild about this warm.  I'll cool it in the fridge and see if it's better when cold.

The only changes I made to this recipe were that I substituted almond milk and baked the pudding in a water bath without the towel.  (Why the towel?)  My oven bakes a little hot and I forgot to adjust the temperature, so the pudding was done in 45-50 minutes.  The texture was perfect - not too runny, not too dry.  Unlike other reviewers, I thought the sweetness was just right, but I guess that's a matter of personal taste.  I have had a banana bread pudding before and forgot that the bananas bake up rubbery, so I will try other reviewers' suggestion of mashing them next time.  I am also used to having a sauce (e.g., rum sauce, vanilla sauce) on my bread pudding and thought this needed something additional.

I did this one without the chocolate, i just wasn't in the mood for chocolate at that time.) When it came to soaking the bread, I placed the ingredients in a bowl with an airtight lid and turned it over every two minutes for the tem minute period. I must admit, it was very yummy!

I'm going to give this recipe the benefit of the doubt and give it 5 stars.  I doubled the recipe (but only used 6 eggs) and baked it in a 9x13 pan at 350 for 60 minutes.  The taste is good, but I think that doubling the recipe made too much liquid and it's a little goopy to me.  Next time I'll reduce the milk too.  It was a nice way to use up leftover bananas!

Great base recipe to work with! I mashed my bananas & stirred them into my milk mixture, reduced the sugar to about 2/3 cup & added about 2 heaping TBSP cocoa. I also did 1 can coconut milk + 1/2 cup milk & I sprinkled the chocolate chunks/ chips all over the top instead of mixing into my liquid mix so they wouldn't end up sinking to the bottom. And I used a 8x8 pan inside a 9x13 filled with the water. With these changes I'd give it 5 stars! Delicious!

Way too chocolatey and gooey. I made this using just 1/3 of the sugar suggested and it was still over the top. I served it to three kids aged 5 to 9 and they only ate half of their servings. Not great, I won't make again. The only upside was that I got to use my over-ripe bananas.

This was really yummy. You should mash the bananas, it makes the pudding moist and spreads the banana flavor. I used more chocolate chips then the recipe calls for and a added a hint of cinnamon powder. Also, I just placed the mixture in a glass dish and baked it for about 40 minutes, instead of following the recipe method for baking. I Had to stop myself from going back for another serving. Will make again.

Here are my modifications....  1/2 cup sugar, 1 banana very ripe and mashed in w/ the milk and eggs, rather than sliced and 2/3 cup dark chocolate chips.  I baked in a 1&1/2 quart dish without the water bath with no problems, and it usually takes longer than one hour.  YUM!!

This is a GREAT dish. It tastes the best when the entire thing is allowed to set and cool completely. Otherwise, the chocolate chips smear throughout the dish and overpower the flavor.

Yummy...tastes like banana bread.  I used an extra banana and used part half/half and skim milk.  I also added the chocolate chips on top and a sprinkle of nutmeg on top.  I didn't use the full amount of sugar, but close.  Fun recipe!

Soooooooo good. I had some really ripe frozen bananas that I wanted to use up. This was the perfect venue for them to shine. I added 4 bananas instead of 2 and upped the chocolate chips to 2 cups. I also added cocoa powder to make it more chocolately. Served warm with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream... this is what dessert should be.

I was looking for a way to use up the bread crusts that my son doesn't want on his sandwiches.  (I freeze them for a later use.)  This is DEFINITELY the recipe!!!  I use whole wheat bread crust and it tastes amazing!  Because he has a milk allergy, I substitute rice milk.  I use a bit less sugar, but all else the same.  It is very chocolately, but our family loves chocolate, and the bananas make it out of this world.  A very tasty treat that our whole family enjoys!

Delicious! I made mine lighter so I could top it with a whipped topping. I cubed 3 slices of bread. I used 1/2 a cup of sugar and 3 eggs instead. I also added in 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg. People said the chocolate chips all sunk to the bottom so I sprinkled the chocolate chips on top instead of mixing it in with the batter, and also topped mine with honey roasted almonds, it was spectacular!

Delish Bread Pudding - I used over ripe banana's that I had thrown in the freezer for baking and added chopped walnuts. Also half the amount of sugar made it just sweet enough. Followed baking directions, but used extra large muffin tins. Came out wonderful- cripsy top, with warm gooey chocolate throughout. Yummm

delicious and so so easy! I used a whole round french loaf, and did all the ingredients 1.5 times the recipe amount. Like 6 eggs instead of 4. It fit in a 9x11 pan. Also I just sprinkled the chocolate chips on top so they wouldn't sink. Yum!

Fantastic, delicious dessert!  I followed the recipe exactly except that I put in only HALF the amount of sugar and what is so great about this recipe is that it is so easy and quick to make.  I have made this before but just recently decided to serve this for Christmas dessert and it was a huge hit for everyone!  I baked in a 9" x 13" baking dish which took a bit less time, too. I will continue to make in the future for sure!

Stale french bread and overripe bananas at its finest!  The banana and chocolate chips gave the bread pudding the pop it needed.  All the chips sank to the bottom when added to the custard.  I recommend just tossing it in at the end in between layers of bread/custard mixture.  Also, I would try mashing  extra slices of banana with the custard before adding the bread for more banana flavor.

I thought this recipe was good.  I took others advice and only used half the sugar the recipe called for.. definitely sweet enough.  Next time I think I will make the following changes:  Add a little cinnamon, mix some of the chocolate chips in and save some to sprinkle on top (many of my chocolate chips sank to the bottom), blend the banana with the liquid, and I will also add more bread than the recipe called for.  This recipe is a little more custard like and so I hope by adding a little more bread to soak up the liquid a little more.  Tasted great though.. especially warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream!

Wow! I've never made bread pudding so not quite sure what to expect but this was stellar. I substituted Splenda for the sugar and it turned out great. Made a little maple bourbon sauce to drizzle on top and it was a hit!

I had stale bread and overripe bananas, and this recipe was perfect to make quick use of both. I used half of an artisan wheat baguette, added a tsp of cinnamon, substituted half the sugar for Splenda and didn't bother with the water bath - I just used a square 8x8 stoneware baking dish straight into the oven. I reduced temp to 325 and it was perfect after 1 hr 5 min. The top has started to lightly brown but the pudding itself was still very moist. I also didn't mix in chocolate chips - I just sprinkled the them on top of the batter once it was in the dish. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream - delicious.

this recipe was yummy with a few modifications-used whole wheat french bread; like others, i put the bananas (two) in the food processor w/the liquids so there were no "chunks", just banana flavor (could've used one more, but they weren't super-ripe either so that's my fault); used 1/4c white and 1/4 brown sugars (PLENTY sweet enough); threw in a couple handfuls of walnuts; added a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg (didn't measure it, whoops); and while it was still warm i took a knife and tried to "swirl" the chocolate chips throughout so we wouldn't bite into whole chocolate chips. i didn't use the water bath, baked in a glass 9x13" for about 45-50 mins. great warm or cold, especially with good quality vanilla ice cream. everyone loved it. thanks so much for this recipe!

Excellent!  I made a few changes: I used a loaf of homemade honey whole wheat bread.  Since it was more substantial than french bread, I added 1/2 C. evaporated milk.  I also used 1/2 C. of brown sugar instead of the 1 C. white sugar.  A tsp. of cinnamon helped tie the banana and chocolate to the nutty whole wheat.  Also, I did use the water bath, but did not set the loaf pan on a damp towel--things still turned out fine.  I used the rest of my can of evaporated milk, combined with 1 T. butter and 1/3 C. sugar to make a carmel sauce for the top.  Boil until thickened.  Great recipe!

This was easy to prepare and tasted good.  Next time I will follow others' suggestions and mash the bananas up before I add them to the mixture.  This was very rich and filling, so smaller portions are best.

This was so easy and delicious.  I added a bit of salt to help bring out the flavor of the semi-sweet chocolate.  Delicious.

Wow! Top notch! I'm eating some as I type. I went ahead and replaced the chocolate chips with a cup of golden raisons and tossed in a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg. It took over an hour to cook in my oven. I used homemade challah bread (Challah I).

This is my new favorite! I love bread pudding, and this one is the best I've ever had. So delicious and so simple. I did have to leave in the oven 20 mins. longer than called for.

It was a bit too chocolately (very, very rich!) and for some reason, ended up a little runny.  I'd use fewer chocolate chips next time.  I think that will help make it more solid.  But I did put it into the fridge and it was great cold!  It is very tasty though and I will definitely try to make it again sometime.

This was delicious!  I added a few tbs. of melted butter to give it a nicely browned crust, and baked it in a 9 inch square pan.  I recommend eating it slightly warm so the chips will be soft.

Very easy and delicious. Ended up with a nice custard that held together and could be easily sliced into squares.  I used a sourdough bread, and I think it balanced the flavors - not overly sweet by any means.  Brought it into work and it was gone FAST with overwhelmingly positive comments.  Will make again.

**These were my adjustments, based on what I had in hand at home:
-I doubled the recipe due to the amount of bread I had.  I used a half a loaf of sourdough sandwich bread.  It worked out to be about 9 1/2 c of large cubes.
-Bananas: I defrosted about 2 1/2 cups of bananas I have on hand in the freezer. As my bananas brown, I peel, slice them and freeze.  
-Milk:  I used 16 oz of skim milk and 1 can (12 oz) of evaporated milk
-Eggs, Sugar, Vanilla, Chocolate Chips -- doubled amts in the original recipe.

Ingredients only needed to soak for about 10 minutes. I baked the item in a 9x13 metal pan (sprayed w/Olive Oil), as per waterbath instructions, for about 50' - knife came out clean.  The pan cooled on my counter overnight and I easily sliced the dessert into squares this morning.

Update 7/2/16: I tried another bread pudding recipe w/o the water bath and it was just ok.  Did the true custard water bath tonight with a bunch of random stuff in the house, and it is seriously perfect.  Take the time to mess around with the 2 dishes, towel, water, you will not be disappointed!

Awesome - my first bread pudding and first attempt at at water bath - awesome!  Added 1 extra banana and 1 additional egg and used hot dog buns (after some research).  Out-freaking-standing!  This will become a holiday recipe and I thank you much for sharing it : )

Love the custard. I prefer to bake it without the roasting pan because I bake it on a loaf pan i.e. to make pot roast, and my oven isn't big enough for two. To give the bananas flavor, I caramelized them with about a tablespoon of butter and a tablespoon of brown sugar until they're nice and brown. I also added cinnamon and grated a bar of hershey's dark chocolate to each slice of bread to get a good textured taste.

Instead of chocolate chips, I soaked raisins in brandy overnight.  I also mashed an extra large super-overripe banana and whisked it into the milk mixture before adding the bread and 2 sliced (not overripe) bananas (plus a dash of cinnamon and SALT).  I LOVE the simplicity of this recipe-- its the only one i could find without heavy cream and a laundry list of ingredients.  So delicious, thank you!!

Extremely delicious. Never made any type of bread pudding before this, and it was so easy, and not to mention cheap to make. I sort of think this calls for too many chocolate chips, but even with the amount of chocolate in this, it was absolutely to die for. My family and I ate this with vanilla ice milk.

This recipe gets 5 stars because it is the quickest, easiest, yummiest way to use up our leftover french bread, and it uses simple ingredients that I always have on hand. Oh yeah, and my kids love it! My husband is not a fan, I think bread pudding is not for everyone, and I definitely don't think it is anything like banana bread as many reviewers said, but it is really yummy in and of itself. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great. It was a bit light on banana flavor. Next time I will use 3 bananas and mash them up with the mixture as some reviewers suggested.

I'd give this three and a half stars (husband had given it four). It wasn't bad, but maybe I'm just not a chocolate and banana kind of person. I only had 1 cup of French bread cubes, so scaled the recipe to work with that and baked it in a small shallow dish for about 40 minutes. Definitely mash the banana! If I have leftover French or Italian bread I wouldn't mind making this again.

Absolutely delicious & so easy to make.  After reading the reviews I did 2 small adjustments.  I only used 1/2 cup of sugar which is plenty & I mashed the banana & added it to the milk mixture.  Thanks for the recipe! :)

Very tasty, easy to make and great way of using overly riped bananas and stale bagettes.  I made a few minor changes:  Instead of 2 sliced bananas, I have 3 mashed bananas and 1 sliced bananas.  Instead of 4 cups of bread, I have 5 cups so that the bread pudding has more of a bread taste.  Instead of full cup of sugar, I have 1/2 cup.  I figure that the sweetness of ripened bananas would compensate for less sugar.  Instead of 1 cup of chocolate, I have 1/2 cup.  I love chocolate but I prefer not to have the chocolate taste overwhelming the banana.   As in many other cooks/bakers, I bake for 1.5 hours until the top is slightly golden and a little crunchy.   I would rate this modification a 4 1/2 stars.

LOVE this recipe, especially with the modifications suggested by another reviewer: add cocoa to the mix, and toss the bread cubes with dry ingredients before adding the wet.  Really tasty, moist, different dessert!

Tastes great!  I decided to add an extra banana and threw in a few more chocolate chips than called for.  I also baked in a pyrex bowl, rather than the loaf pan, for just shy of an hour.

So good. I agree with someone - cut back on the sugar by at least half (and maybe add a few more chocolate chips). Oh, and no need to bake in a pan of water. 45 minutes in a glass pan works.

Okay so this recipe deserves five stars as I barely followed the recipe and it still turned out good. Firstly I barely ever make a dessert or any dish for that matter without trying to reduce the fat. I used skim milk, egg whites, 1/3 cup Splenda, added cinnamon, and used homemade white bread that was starting to turn stale. I threw mine in a 2qt baking dish at 350 for about 45-50 minutes and it came out moist and delish. To tell you the truth I never wanted this to turn out as I'm home alone with freshly baked goods. I LOVE banana anything!! I'm sure th original recipe would be AWESOME. Although I unfortunatley have to work hard to keep my figure lol. Thanx for the recipe.

I also used less sugar.  Bread pudding in my opinion should not be too sweet.  Substituted white raisins for the chocolate chips and used a muffin pan to make individual portions.  Served with a scoop of coconut ice cream with a little chocolate shavings.  My guests wanted to move in.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was really moist.  I did 1.5 of the recipe and cooked in a regular 9x13.  It took just about an hour that way.  I liked the addition of banana.

thumbs up from the kids for a keeper.  Make sure to use ripe bananas. I mashed it as well and 1/2 cup chocolate chips is plenty. used 1/2 c brown sugar to cut down on the sugar and as others suggested, added cinnamon, nutmeg and all spice. made a vanilla sauce with added cinnamon to go on top.  Would make again.

This is a pretty mean bread pudding that holds its own even if you tweak it, and I don't even like banana bread.  You can bake it directly, without the water pan - I did so in a 9x12 greased glass baking pan for 40-50 minutes tops (doubled the recipe to fit).  I doubled the chocolate but next time I will quadruple it or put larger chunks in - but I like chocolate more than banana so choose your poison.  I added cinnamon but was out of nutmeg - next time I would add LOTS more spices since its a little bland and does need something to kick it up a punch.  Great basic recipe, amenable to alterations and still works.

Mmmmm, this is good - a real hit with kids. I cut the sugar in half (more would be sickly), mashed rather than sliced the bananas, and added a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg. I found it even better cold.

I made this in a souffle stoneware bowl in the hot water bath and it was phenomenal!  I used the Ghirdelli bittersweet chocolate peices and croisants instead of french bread.  Heavenly.  Everyone at cooking club went bananas.

I can only give this recipe a 3*** because of my guests opinions.  I had a bread pudding party and put out 4 bread puddings.  This was definitely the least favorite recipe across the board.

Now, when my husband had it for breakfast the next morning he thought it was great.  So maybe it really is better as a "leftover".  Next time I'll make a day ahead and see if it gets a better reception.

This recipe was FANTASTIC!  It is super easy to make.  The only hard thing about it was being patient until the bread pudding was finished cooking.  Upon the suggestion of others, I used a little less that 1/2 c BROWN sugar.  I added cinnamon and raisins.  There were no problems with baking it, I kept it in a extra 3 min.  My boyfriend loves me a little more after this one! Thank you ever so much for the great dessert.

Wonderful bread pudding, but a little too sweet.  Next time I will not add any sugar because the chocolate makes it sweet enough.  I added an extra banana and I think I would add maybe 2 more bananas for more of the flavor.  Otherwise, an awesome dessert.  Everyone really enjoyed it.

This deserves 5 stars even though I changed one thing.....No Bananas! I was looking for a way to use up french bread and I have out of this world dark chocolate blocks that I cut into small chunks.  I don't think I expected a dessert as good as this became...so if you wanted to know, you can omit the bananas and it still (more than) works!

Very delicious comfort food! My boyfriend and I devoured it. I took another reviewer's advice and lightly mashed up the banana, plus added nutmeg and cinnamon to add depth. My country doesn't sell chocolate chips, so I put in chunks of a good quality dark chocolate. I have leftover ingredients, so I'm going to make another batch tonight!

I was looking for a way to use up over ripe bananas and some old bread.  I am so glad I found this recipe.  I'm watching fat and calories so I used egg substitute instead of whole eggs and skim milk and cut the sugar in half and only added a handful of chocolate chips.  This turned out moist and delicious.  It's one the whole family will enjoy!

This bread pudding is awesome! I used one of those 60% cocoa chocolate bars broken into pieces (less sugar and it was all I had) and it was great!!!  I baked it for 70 minutes.

Lovely!  I made this with chocolate bread.  Adults ate it hot and children cold with vanilla ice-cream.  To prove how well it went down with 3 very fussy small children (two 6 year-olds and one two year-old) they fought over the leftovers!

Love this recipe! I was on the internet googling bread pudding recipes and this was the most pleasant and easiest one of all! I made this twice in one week. Yes, one week. I only made two modifications and that's because it was all I had on hand.

First time i made bread pudding I used- 1 cup of heavy cream and 1 cup of 1% milk and added cinnamon.

Second time: I used 1 cup of brown sugar instead of white, and still kept the 1:1 heavy cream and milk ratio + cinnamon. 

The first time i made it, it tasted fantastic!! The second time was even better because the brown sugar wasn't as strong in the custard. This was really, really good. 

I also felt that layering the ingredients; bread, custard, bananas, chocolate chips, helped to distribute all the textures evenly. Most importantly, definitely let the bread sit in the mixture for at least 5-10 minutes before placing in water bath in over.

Fabulous! Definitely take other reviewers advice and mash the bananas and add to the milk egg mixture. I truly don't believe this would have been nearly as good using the sliced bananas. Used about 2/3 cup sugar. Didn't measure the chocolate chips, just added what I wanted too. Also used plain almond milk just because it's what we had on hand.  Loved this!

This was yummy! I mashed the bananas up and added them to the milk/egg mixture along with 1t of cinnamon and 1/4t of nutmeg. Also, when putting this together I put half the bread mixture in the pan topped with white and semi-sweet chocolate chips added the rest of the bread mixture and topped again with the white and semi-sweet chocolate chips. I did not measure the chocolate chips, I just used a handful on each layer. Also, I did not do the water bath, just put the loaf pan in the oven and it took exactly 60 minutes, the consistency was perfect.

Followed this recipe's ingredient amounts exactly. Used a whole wheat french loaf. I mushed up the bananas a little. It's the right amount of sweet and flavor. My boyfriend loved it. I would let the mixture sit a little longer than 5 minutes for it all to absorb and let the flavors mingle. Overall-- delicious!

This was fantastic.  I did cut the sugar quantity down to 2/3 a cup but it was still so great. I didn't cook it in a water bath, I just baked it for the hour and covered with foil half way through to prevent burning.

This was really good! I used raisins instead of chocolate chips (didn't have any) and added a bit of nutmeg and cinnamon. It was so delicious right out of the oven! This is a great way to use up extra bananas and bread and I love that it uses ingredients that I always have on hand.

I changed the recipe slightly - used coconut milk instead, 3 bananas instead of 2, added cinnamon and left out all the sugar (it doesn't need it!!). I also used sprouted whole wheat bread to oomph up the nutrition. I sprinkled the top with cinnamon and a tablespoon of brown sugar. DELICIOUS!! Will definitely make this again.

Excellent recipe! Made a 1/2 batch. After reading other reviews I mashed the bananas and added it to the custard liquid (2 bananas for a 1/2 batch) and baked for 45 min.

Very good, but I can't give it 5 stars.

I substituted cinnamon bread, so I reduced the sugar to 2/3 cup. I also did not use chocolate chips (not much of a chocolate fan - I'w weird) and STILL it was WAY too sweet!

I recommend using 1/2 cup of sugar and if your using chocolate chips, maybe even no sugar...

All in all, it was very tasty and I would make it again. Good way to use up bananas!

WOW.  I hardly ever make anything, and this was so easy and possibly one of the best desserts I've ever had.  I made the same recipe today for breakfast, using half the sugar, one extra banana, and substituting a pint of blueberries and a pint of rasberries for the chocolate chips. Still wow (though I'd use 1.5c milk next time as it was a little too liquidy.) Does anyone know what purpose the water bath serves, and why we're supposed to use a kitchen towel?

Omitted the sugar and added more chocolate chips.  It turned out really watery, though.

Love it! I made a few changes. I didn't have cinnamon or nutmeg, so I used pumpkin pie spice instead. I cubed up a 12-pack of King's Hawaiian sweet rolls for the bread, and cut out the chocolate and sugar entirely. I mashed the bananas instead of slicing them. I used 5 eggs and 2.5 cups of milk with half a cup of heavy cream. I also didn't do the water bath. Paired with the whipped cream frosting by Tom Parker (which provided the perfect amount of extra sweetness) on this site, it was perfect!

The first time I made this I only had 3 eggs so I just used those. I also had Italian bread and more than 4 cups, maybe closer to 5-6 cups.  I used a tablespoon measure for the vanilla but didn't fill it the whole way.  I did the same thing with the sugar, I used just under a cup.  I had dark chocolate chips left from another recipe and used what I had left, it was probably under a cup of chips.   I also mashed the bananas and mixed them in the milk mixture.  This is excellent the way I made it.  Other reviews I read said the original recipe was too sweet and some didn't like the slices of banana due to the strong flavor of it when roasted.  I appreciate the original recipe and give it 4 stars but the alterations I made based in other reviews ( and my lack of one egg! ) made this a 5 star recipe for me!

Mine had to bake a little longer, in a 355 degree oven, probably because mine is tiny and my roasting pan barely fits. I added 4 bananas instead of two because I love them, and I used 1/2 cup brown sugar for fuller flavour, but found it pretty sweet. I also used too many choc chips (I just used the rest of a partly used bag so I don't know how much I used). I also added a tablespoon of melted butter to the milk mixture, because I think butter flavour goes well with bananas. But, overall, a DELISH recipe, and I think I can do it better next time.

I used challah bread and cooked in ramekins.(30 minutes in water bath) I used half the sugar and it could have easily have had no added sugar, especially since I mashed the banana with the eggs and milk. Definitely add a pinch of cinnanmon. As for the flavor, I think it had too much banana flavor and not enough chocolate flavor.

I don't know why so many people had trouble with the chocolate chips sinking to the bottom - that did NOT happen with mine - they were evenly spaced throughout - just perfect!  It took quite a bit longer to bake than stated, though - I ended up baking it in the water bath for 75 minutes, then took it out of the water and baked it for another 10!  Next time I'll try baking it w/o the water bath for a shorter amount of time - thanks for the suggestion!  It is delicious as is (I have already eaten over 1/4 of it all by myself - straight out of the pan, with a spoon - now I need to go exercise to work off all these calories!), but I might try adding some cinnamon next time, as cinnamon makes just about any baked item even better!

Necessity, the Mother of invention!  words to live by for me, lol!  OK no chips so I had these Hershey individually wrapped dark chocolate ( about 1" sq)thins.  I broke them into small pieces and added some coconut with them, unbelievable!! This takes this recipe from everyday to holiday dinner status.  My hubby said I could sell this for $9.00 a pop at a fancy restaurant!

I made this recipe today because I had leftover hamburger buns and bananas that needed to be used. I loved it. I did alter it slightly, instead of chocolate chips I used chopped pecans and I also omitted half the sugar and it was more than enough. I will be making this again. Thanks

What an easy and flavorful bread pudding recipe. I had 2 extremely ripe bananas and used Hersey's Dark Chocolate chips to contrast the sweetness a little; I also scaled the recipe down to 6 servings (using the tool on Allrecipes) and only used 1/2 cup sugar not 3/4 cup, and baked it in a glass pie plate without the water bath at 350 for 30 minutes and it came out great, yet still very moist. I finished the pudding with a vanilla, cinnamon glaze...my roommate has already had 2 servings :)

This is one of my favorite desserts and always make it for company.  After making it numerous times, I make the following substitutions:  ~3-4 ripe mashed bananas ~1/2 c sugar instead  I serve it warm with light vanilla ice cream.

I was excited to try this recipe because there is a restaurant in the Cities (Mpls/St.Paul) that serves a chocolate banana bread pudding that my sister and I are crazy for.  This is not quite the same.  It is very good though!  This pudding is very custard-like, whereas the restaurant's version is more cake-like.  I have never made a bread pudding before, so this was an adventure!  There were a few things I was confused about, like should you remove the crust from the bread?  And what is the point of the towel?  I ended up cutting off the crust and not using the towel.  I think it turned out pretty good.  I used boiling water for the 'bath' and ended up baking for 1 hr. and 15 min.  It was lightly brown on top and the knife came out clean.  Next time I might add some cocoa powder, more bread and less eggs.  Some reviewers mentioned 1 cup of sugar being too much, but I thought it tasted good.  Although comparing to other bread pudding recipes, most only use 1/2 cup of sugar, so I think that would work too.  Oh, and I definitely recommend mashing the bananas and blending them in with the egg/milk mixture.

Amazing! I used homemade chocolate chip muffins as the bread since I had them laying around. It was a great way to use them! I was afraid it may be too sweet since others had reviewed it as being so but it was perfect. Very decadent! I also used one cup cream and one cup milk instead of just milk. I did have to cook it 20 minutes longer then what the recipe suggested. I will definitely make this again, so good!

This is an amazing desert. I made it  with a little cinnamon instead of nutmeg and only 1/4 cup sugar, but left the rest of the recipe the same. I served the pudding with fresh sliced strawberries and homemade whipped cream. It was fantastic!!!! Even better cold the next day.

AMAZING!!! This was soooo easy to make and everyone loved it! Vanilla ice cream definitely compliments this perfectly.  Just a 2 thingsto note that others have commented on already: 1. Make sure the water you put in the water bath is HOT orelse it'll take an extra 1/2 hour to bake, at least! 2. You can definitely cut down on the sugar, since the chocolate chips are sweet already. I'd say at least 1/2 or less.

This was the first bread pudding I've ever eaten or made.  I thought it was delicious!  I didn't care for it with milk but loved it warmed up with vanilla ice cream.  I used french bread and chopped it into large cubes.  This recipe was really easy to prepare, also.  Yummy!

This was good. Far too rich for me but the silence around the table save the clinking of spoon on bowls spoke for its self!!  I scaled the recipe down to serve 4 and mashed the banana and mixed it with the milk before adding it to the bread.

This was pretty good.  I ended up making it with a loaf of Egg bread that had some raisins in it.  I put the whole thing into my Corningware oval but followed directions otherwise.  I found the chocolate to be a bit much for me--next time I might half the amount of chips and use mini-chips instead.  Otherwise, I thought it was quite nice.

I had 4 bannana's to use up, so I multiplied the ingredients by 1.5. I think that next time I'd mash up the bannans instead of slicing them up. The recipie wasn't clear on how many chocolate chips to use, so I added just a small handfull. Also, I just made mine in a large 12x4 glass dish that was really deep (it rises when it cooks). Definately would make it again.

Awesome.  What a way to use old bread and bananas.  I added too much extra chocolate chips (my fault) to my pudding.  This recipe doesn't need any altering, it is that good.  Homemede vanilla sauce finished this treat.  Nice enough dessert for guests.

This was by far the best bread pudding I have ever had!  I mean, top notch restaurant quality dessert!  I used a botched loaf of Lower Fat Banana Bread (forgot to add the sugar!) and I did use a 1 1/2 qt casserole instead of the loaf pan, probably because I had more bread.  I think it looked nicer that way, anyway.   I can't wait for the next potluck - I'll be making this again (most likely with my altered banana bread recipe!)

very good.  I took others advice and used only 1/2 cup sugar and added some cinnamon and an extra banana. I also used a few extra chocolate chips, but it didn't need it.  Will make this again and again. I used a 9x13 pan for 70 mins.

Yum!!  I added an extra banana and waited to serve it until the chocolate had time to sit a bit.  It was wonderful.  Just the right thing on a cold day.

This was good and a nice change from banana loaf.
It was nice and crunchy on the top and moist, not runny on the inside. Cooked convection at 175 for 60 minutes.
Next time i will add nuts and cinnamon.

I made this with honey instead of sugar, and I tone down the sweetness after reading the feedback here. Note: the chocolate and bananas will add quite a bit of sugar, so even though I thought I added too little sugar in the egg/milk mixture, it turned out still to be just perfect sweetness. I also added a pinch of salt which I think is essential to get the perfect result. It was very very good, all my roommates loved it. Will definitely make this again.

I followed the advice and only used 1/2 cup of Sugar and mashed the bananas.  I also used Pepridge Farms cinnamon swirl bread.  My family loved it, I will definatley make it again.

I have tried this recipe 3 times ... each time altering it to my particular taste.  It is delicious!!!  After Easter I had alot of leftover candy and added chopped Hershey Hugs and Semi Sweet chocolate buds (a high quality chocolate) and it was the perfect combo.  I also used honey wheat bread instead of white which gave it a firmer texture.  I usually have a sweeter tooth so it worked for me.  It's worth a try!

THIS RECIPE WAS GREAT!!  WAS A LITTLE WORRIED WHEN IT CAME OUT OF THE OVEN A LITTLE RUNNY.  ONCE IT WAS REFRIGERATED-MUCH BETTER.  I USED EGG SUBSTITUTE, AND HOMEMADE BANANA NUT BREAD.  I THINK NEXT TIME I'LL USE BREAD THAT'S EASILY ABSORBED AS PUDDING WAS TOO WET, EVEN WHEN BAKING FOR OVER AN HOUR

Upon first tasting fresh out of the oven I was unimpressed, but I think everyone agreed that the taste improved ten-fold after being in the fridge overnight.  My sister recommended less sugar (she said it was not only too sweet, but gritty as well), but I think it's fine the way it is.  The bananas came out a little bitter, but I seriously doubt that's the recipe's fault.  A nice, unique bread pudding!

Oh yummy! And easy to make too. Like another reviewer, I also used 1/2 cinnamon raisin bread and 1/2 french bread. I made two batches: 1 with sliced ripe bananas, 1 with mashed ripe bananas--everyone like the mashed better. Overall, sooo good! Thanks for posting this--its a new favourite!

I've made this twice now. My kids won't eat bread crusts so I save them in the freezer until I have enough to make a bread pudding. We really like this one, especially with whipped cream. It's a pretty heavy dessert so don't serve it after a heavy supper.

I followed the recipe and it turned out great. Rave reviews. Had to make a second one to accommodate some dietary restrictions. Subbed milk for cashew milk and that also got a five star rating. Will definitely make it again, both ways.

Without a doubt would serve it again - it served 8 - 10 so it is a large recipe and I substituted 1/2 white and 1/2 chocolate chips for this recipe. I also used bananas that were over ripe and it worked perfectly. I didn't have French bread but used multi-grain hamburger buns from my freezer and it was fantastic.  I was wondering if anyone has ever frozen portions of this and how that turned out? An exceptionally inexpensive recipe that looks absolutely decadent. Everyone loved it!!!

I've been into banana bread lately but thought those would be a cool thing to try since it was custardy. I made a lot of the changes mentioned here. I used 1/4 cup brown sugar and no white sugar. I layered the chocolate chips and put less.  I wasn't really impressed. It was mostly eggy and still so sweet.  It was okay with some vanilla ice cream but I don't think I'll make it again.

It is amazing! Best bread pudding ever! Only I made a few changes lol I used French bread which I think is a must. Also I used like 1/3 cup of brown sugar instead of white sugar, added 1 smashed banana to the egg mix, sprinkled a good amount of cinnamon, and used mini chocolate chips! I didnt use the water bath the 2nd time and it was perfect.

I prepared and baked it according to the instructions, but the lower half  turned out quite liquid. I scraped it back into the loaf pan, baked it at 350 OUT of the roasting pan and water for another 20 minutes. It was fine then, Everyone loved it!

Definitely too sweet and too much chocolate - I halved the sugar and it was still a bit much. I would recommend cutting both the sugar in half and the chocolate down by about a third.

I read some of the reviews  and followed some of their suggestions but I really  wished I would have followed the original recipe. I would definitely not increase the chocolate chips as much as most people recommended. Maybe just a heaping  cup but not more than that. I also layered the chocolate chips but what happened was I had a thick layer of chocolate  in the middle and  it overwhelmed the taste of the bananas. I do recommend that you puree the bananas. I also did not use a towel in the baking pan but I did boil the water.  It took about 5 mins more than the recipe called  for. But it had a really good taste and I am not a big bread pudding fan. I am definitely going to make it again and follow the recipe.

The two stars are for how easy the recipe is. But it fell flat on flavor to me. I will use a recipe I found and made last month for chocolate chip bread pudding, but I will add pureed bananas.

The changes I made were to use half and half instead of milk and brioche bread instead of French bread. Fabulous.
I actually doubled the recipe and put some in ramekins and some in a casserole dish.

I agree with the other reviews that say to cut out some of the sugar. It is wayyyyy too sweet, even with the extra dark chocolate chips I used. I baked over 60 min in a 9x14 pan in a preheated water bath. My knife came out clean but it still ended up being a very "wet" bread pudding.

I had bought too much bread for a French toast recipe that I found, so I thought that I would try to recreate Longhorn's chocolate banana bread pudding since that was delicious!  Mission accomplished!  I followed the advice that some other reviewers gave and cut the sugar in half while also mashing up a banana in the egg mixture.  Serve it up warm with some vanilla ice cream and carmel on top and you have the perfect sweet treat!

This is a wonderful recipe. I made it for the staff at my restaurant so they'd stay away from my fresh pastries. It's a hard sell to the public but probably the tastiest dessert I've come across in a long time. We used day old croissants and like others have said, I threw the custard base in the blender. I doubled the recipe because I had so much bananas and didn't need a water bath.  Layering in the chocolate is a great tip, so The outcome was great. I used dark chocolate and I swear, this actually feels like you are doing your body a service when you eat it. Others mentioned they didn't get enough chocolate, but if you go dark you don't need much and it balances everything out perfectly. The bananas and the chocolate combined with croissants was heavenly and my staff went through the thing in three days. This is so easy to make. I love it at room temperature best and covered it with crème anglaise (per serving) . Definitely something I'll keep in my repertoire for pot-lucks or large gatherings. Every person who tried it loved it.

The recipe calls for chocolate chips, but I felt the same as another reviewer. I replaced them with raisins....and I am a chocoholic. I loved it that way and may try a small amount of chocolate chips another time.  I did halve this recipe, scaling down to 4 servings. It fit well in an 8x4 pan. I used mainly French bread and some cinnamon/raisin bread. I used brown sugar in place of the white, added cinnamon and a little cloves, nutmeg and added a handful of walnuts. This was excellent, and I will surely make again!

Oh my goodness - amazing!  The whole bread-pan-in-water thing really didn't do it for me, so I baked mine in a 9x13 on 350 for 50 minutes.  Came out just great!  I used 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of the white, but I agree with another reviewer who said you don't actually need any sugar.  It's VERY sweet with the chocolate chips.  I added an extra half cup of chips and wish I hadn't...too much chocolate!  I meant to add some cinnamon but forgot (next time!).  I might add another banana next time as well.

I made this exactly to the recipe. Yes, it's sweet! Yes, it's dessert! It reminds me of eating at County Cookin'. Nothing like an easy southern dessert! Would make again! None left!

Doesn't need that long baking time plus it doesn't need a bain-maire. 40min is good with the last 10min covered in foil.

I've made this several times and it gets rave reviews without fail. Top it with real whipped cream--not the stuff in the can--for a decadent treat. This is our go-to comfort food when we're depressed...or happy...it's just our go-to comfort food! LOL. Fancy enough for company. I make it as-is, except I cut back the sugar by about a third. (But that might be because I tend to go heavy on the chocolate chips.

I used two thirds of the milk recommended as I like a dryer pudding.  I used just under half the sugar as I just like things not as sweet.  This is a highly flexible recipe.  I also cooked it at 400 degrees F as I needed it to be ready sooner plus I cooked it in a bigger pan so that speeds up the cooking time as well.  Like I said a highly flexible recipe.

This is really good. best to use a mixer to mash up the bananas as you incorporate the other ingredients.. then just pour it over the bread.

This is so amazing and simple. A great way to use up overripe bananas. I have used any kind of bread and it turns out great every time - French bread, challah, even some leftover potato rolls that I had frozen in the freezer and thawed out to make this. I think the amount of chocolate chips is plenty, so they do not overwhelm the banana flavor, but I use mini chocolate chips so they distribute well through the batter. And definitely semi sweet - I think milk chocolate might be too sweet (but white chocolate or butterscotch could be great too!).

I used 5 large eggs, I also added a bit of almond extract and a few tablespoons of Marsala wine.  After putting the pudding in the pan I sprinkled a few more chocolate chips over the top and also a bit of Demerara sugar and cinnamon.  It was really yummy!

It was really, really good. Will make it again. Added Cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg. Broiled the top for the last couple minutes and it gave it a great crispy edge.

The reviews on this site really helped - thanks for the tips.  I didn't cut back on the sugar, and treated each layer like tiramisu by dusting with cocoa and tossing it lightly, and adding chocolate chips (dark chocolate) on top of each layer.  Don't hesitate to use a fully bag of chips.  The final product had lots of chocolate flavour.  My bread consisted of leftover foccacia buns - what a transformation!

A big hit with my family, for sure!  Tastes like banana bread, but the bread pudding texture is very nice.  It was very easy to make, though it took longer to cook than it said in the recipe; I baked mine about an hour and a half.  Thanks!

It was tasty but needed more chocolate chips.  Also, it took FAR longer than an hour.  I eventually had to take it out of the water bath to finish cooking the bottom.

I made this recipe with the changes suggested by Dianemwj in her review.  I used 6 cups of bread (which I tossed with 1/4 melted butter) and 3 cups of milk.  I mashed one of the bananas and blended it with the milk/egg mixture, then sliced the other banana into the whole pudding.  I didn't use any sugar at all, but I did use a whole bag of chocolate chips. Absolutely delicious! Word to the wise:  take heed of SPICEQUEEN's advice.  This is very rich, so stick with small portions.

I'm from Louisiana, so we eat a lot of bread pudding.  I was looking for something different to do with it and found this recipe.  I love it!  The only thing I changed is that I mashed the bananas (don't care for chunks) and used a mixture of half and half and milk.   I will be making this for Christmas morning.  Thank you for the great recipe.

I made the recipe with 1/2 cup of sugar and still found it very sweet.  Next time I will either use 1/4 cup or omit it altogether.  This recipe was well received by guests although they all commented it was a bit too sweet.  I made it in ramekins set in a roaster with dish towel and water. Took the hour to bake.... I would certainly make this again.

I don't like bread pudding, but this was amazing! Due to my french bread being fresh, I toasted it a bit beforehand. I also did only 1/3 a cup of sugar (coconut crystals actually) and half a bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips. I also did only 1 banana, and next time might actually prefer to mash it with the cream instead of having chunks. Served it with vanilla ice cream on top! Wonderful!

Very tasty but I did mash the bananas before adding them and added a pinch of nutmeg and cinnamon. I only sprinkled maybe half the amount of the chocolate chips on top of the pudding before baking, we thought it was sweet enough and didn't need more chips. I will definitely make again especially with old bread left over and ripe bananas- this is the perfect solution.

Just baked it. I substituted about 2/3 of the sugar with Splenda. I used 1% milk. And I used 3 small thawed out mushy bananas. The rest was exactly as suggested. Amazing result. Beautiful to look at and extremely tasty.

This was super easy to make. I used half amount of sugar after reading some of the reviews, and to make it a bit healthier used whole wheat bread and soy milk. Also didn't have chocolate chips but cut up some baker chocolate instead. Came out super yummy! Can't believe how easy it was to make. Definitely will make it again!

This bread pudding set up well and had that nice creamy-but-not-runny texture you want from bread pudding. I never thought I'd say this, but there was too much chocolate. The melted chocolate clumped in places and overtook the flavor of the pudding making it so rich it was almost inedible. Another change I would make would be to mash half the bananas before adding. While I enjoyed the banana flavor, I think mashing half would give this recipe extra creaminess while adding a delicate banana flavor. Instead this tasted strongly of baked bananas - a flavor that can also be overpowering.

This recipe was okay.  It basically tastes like banana bread with chocolate chips fresh out of the oven.  It took longer to bake than the recipe stated.  It really wasn't what I anticipated for bread pudding.  I think I will try a different recipe in the future.

I'm sure this would have been better had I actually followed the directions, but I used whole grain bread and no added sugar. I also just eyeballed the bread instead of measuring it....which made it turn out dry.  The taste was good, this will just teach me that measurements are there for a reason!

Made it without the bananas and it was wonderful!  I added a warm vanilla sauce on top and my husband inhaled it!  This is a for sure winner in our home and a great way to use any leftover bread instead of throwing it out.  Great recipe!

This was really good! I didn't put the full amount of sugar in, i just didn't fill up the measuring cup as much... I would recommend baking this longer, or maybe making it in a shorter dish as the loaf pan left the pudding a bit moist, whereas I prefer it to be a bit more cooked!

I made a chocolate cake in a spring-form pan and accidentally added too much batter, so I had to cut a lot of cake off the bottom and I used that in this recipe instead of bread. It is absolutely amazing, I'm really proud of it! I also added strawberries to go with the bananas and chocolate chips. And then made a topping out of brown sugar, butter and chopped up pecans mixed with a pastry blender. Just an idea of how to use up stuff besides bread using this recipe. :D

This was very good, but I would cut back on the amount of sugar as this was really sweet.  Plus I would also put a layer of bread, then chocolate chips and repeat.

This receipe is AMAZING!! I made some modifications as well based on other people's reviews. I ended up using 6 slices of old wheat bread (which is about 4 cups) and only 1/2 cup of sugar.   I don't know why people say that 1 cup of chocolate chips isn't enough, for me it was WAY too much.  I also added cinnamon.   Overall this was delicious. My roommates were crazy about it and I will definitely be making it for thanksgiving!!

This is a GREAT recipe I'm sure just as written. I could not resist the urge to change some things. But just the way it is rocks too.My changes were to use 2 eggs and the rest egg beaters, fat free half n half instead of milk, part white bread texas toast and part raisin bread, three bananas and less sugar. I also soaked the concoction for an hour, not five minutes and cooked covered for around 40 minutes and then uncovered for about 50. Good stuff indeed.

My family eat's this cold with a little dusting of powdered sugar over the top.  I put the recipe in two loaf pans instead of one since I have an 8x4.75 loafs pans which I think is a more common size.  I don't know if it makes a difference or not but my loaf pans are glass.

So yummy!! After reading several other reviews I decided to increase the amount of chocolate chips (doubled it), and I left out the sugar completely. I'm a really chocoholic, so I decided to make this a "chocolate chocolate banana bread pudding" by adding 3 tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa when mixing the wet ingredients. I also added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. I mashed the bananas. Results were fantastic! Everyone loved this and I will definitely be making it again -- the chocolate-chocolate version of course! I

This is great. I used cheap white bread, lightly toasted; 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 white; two tablespoons melted butter; and a bit of cinnamon. It was good out of the oven, but to my surprise, much, much better the next day. Did not use water bath to cook, and it cooked fine. It did take longer to cook & I covered after about an hour. I cooked in 8x8 pan -- next time will use 11 x 13 -- it was kind of thick. The middle was a bit mushy. This recipe is a great way to get rid of over-ripe bananas and old or cheap bread. This would go over very well at a pot-luck. I'm taking it to my next one!

This is a great recipe. VERY easy to make and delicious too! I didn't put in any sugar because I actually do not care for food that is too sweet and after reading the reviews, I decided to try making it without any at all.  It was perfect!

Delicious! Added really ripe bananas to the egg mixture instead of slicing them up. Seemed to heighten the flavor and make it even stronger. Husband loved it and finished HALF a pan while I was at work. So I made him cook a fresh batch - he doubled it and put it in an 13 x 9 pan. 

The only thing about this is it didn't seem to cook in the time allotted. Was about twice as long - and I used hot water for the bath. Even the second batch which was done in a flatter area still took forever (2+ hrs.) to cook. Regardless, it's worth the wait and a delicious winter dessert.

I thought the base for this recipe was very good.  I followed some previous advice, and added 1 mashed up banana to egg, milk, etc.  I omitted the chocolate chips and served this dusted with powdered sugar.  Very good!  And as far as the cooking times go, it's gonna vary.  Depending on what size roaster you use, and whether the water is hot, etc.  So just check it after an hour.

Needs ripe bananas, stale bread, & hot/boiling water.  I added some cinnamon.  Maybe it would be better with the bananas & choc. chips as toppings.

Excellent recipe. I made a half batch without chocolate chips, used a very ripe mashed banana and 1/3 cup of sugar instead of 1/2 and it came out very airy and sweet.  I also omitted the water bath and cooked at only 300F.  Will definately be making again. :)

WOW! So rich and delicious. I used VERY ripe, black bananas and I doubled the chocolate chips (half mixed in and sprinkled half on top once I poured it).  I also let my bread soak in the egg mixture for several hours (4+) before baking.  SUPER RICH and tastey. My husband loved it.

I thought I would try this.  I used 2 very ripe bananas.  I followed others advice and beat them with the milk so there were no chunks.  I also added cocoa and some chopped chocolate.  It just did not go over well.  No one really cared for it.  Would not make again.

really yummy! I baked in a covered casserole dish for 40 mins. and it was perfect.  I also added a third banana mashed in w/the milk and used only 1/2 c. of brown sugar and it was great. I also used a hearty whole wheat bread.

So delish! I only used 1/2 cup of sugar and I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet. Next time I make it, I will add 1/2 cup more of the chips. Awesome recipe!

Awesome.  I substituted sultanas for the chocolate chips and it came out delicious!  If you want more texture, cut the bread in to bigger chunks and don't let it soak for as long.

I thought this was below average... and cooked as directed just plain bad.  It takes way more than 1 hour.  Consistency is bad, taste is just OK, not worth the calories.

This was excellent! I reduced the sugar to a 1/2 cup per other reviews and thought it was perfect. It was good right out of the oven and just as good the next day heated up in the microwave!

Nice recipe;) I upted the bread to 5 cups and  I cut down the sugar to 1/2c and the chips to 2/3 as well as mashing the bananas.  Served with vanilla ice cream. YUMMY!

We had this last night, it was quite nice, but a bit too chocolatey and not enough banana flavour. Next time will cut back on chocci chips and put in another banana or make sure they are a bit more ripe. I also cut down on the sugar by half  and actually used nutrasweet as other reviewers suggested. However this is meant to be eaten while warm, it is not very nice once its sat overnight...

This was tasty. I made it a little more health conscious by using Splenda in place of sugar, skim milk, and whole wheat bread. My whole family liked it. Nex t time, though, I think I'd add a little cinnamon to it to give it a tiny bit more 'kick'. I mashed the bananas as other reviewers recommended.

I scaled this down to just two servings as it was just for me and my grandpa and it came out pretty good. My grandpa is pre-diabetic so I subbed 3 Sweet-n-Low packets for the 1/4c sugar, and used just 2 tablespoons of mini chocolate chips instead of the 1/4c of chocolate chips. By using mini chips they spread out all over the batter and you really couldn't tell that there wasn't enough chocolate. I used 2 egg whites instead of one whole egg, and added some cinnamon to the liquid. Yum! We both enjoyed the flavor of this. I planned on putting this in the fridge to let it chill after I pulled it out of the oven, but it smelled too good and got eaten right away!

I found this to be a little wet when I stuck the knife in, even though it was done.  I wished it had a stronger chocolate flavor and a lighter banana flavor.  Husband enjoyed it and I did not dislike it, but I probably won't make it again.

I love the banana taste! This is very easy to make and very good.
