UPDATE:  I've started straining the cooking liquid and boiling potoates in it for either boiled or chunky mashed potatoes.  I haven't done it yet but I think I'll try using the liqued to boil rice.  

I have been boiling ribs and chicken like this for years and years.  I always add a generous amount of garlic powder, ground pepper and 1 onion cut into wedges.  My secret ingredient is to add a good amount of soy sauce 1/2-1 C approx.  Boil for 45 mins-1 hour.  Turn off heat, cover pan and let ribs marinate in the broth for several hours (I have let them sit for 4-5 hours).  Great to put in the oven especially during the winter months, but best on the grill.  If you want to make ahead put cooled ribs into plastic bag and add enough BBQ sauce to coat well.  Refrigerate until ready to use and then cook with additional sauce.  Try this with chicken--you will love it.  Just reduce the boiling time.

I was always too intimidated to attempt making ribs. All I can say is WOW! They were so easy to make... I DID modify the cooking time: I boiled for only 1 hour and then cooked in the oven for only an hour as well. I wanted the meat tender but not falling completely off the bone as you picked it up, so I cut down on the cooking time (the meat still falling off the bone, but only while you were eating them, not while you were handling them). I also used pork baby back ribs, if that helps any of you... When boiling, I added salt and pepper, garlic and onion powder, and adobo seasoning. I did use a lot of seasoning, too (probably a teaspoon of each if not more - I used a big lobster pot to boil them in). I took some reviewers recommendations and I used the Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce. They have 3 or 4 different flavors, and instead of picking just one, I chose 3 different kinds and mixed them together: spicy, honey BBQ, and regular. Buy one bottle of sauce per rack of ribs you make, and buy one extra bottle as well! Some here basted theirs many times - I found that I only needed to do that twice. I cooked them in the oven for 30 mins, flipped them, recoated with sauce, and cooked another 30 minutes. And, I did all of this the night before a party. The day of the party, I separated all the ribs and cooked them for an additional 15 minutes on the BBQ... They were UNBELIEVABLE. I hope this info helps!!!

These ribs were just wonderful.  I boiled them for about 45 minutes.  I also followed the advice of others and put more BBQ sauce on the tops about 20 minutes before I took them out of the oven.  A note to others...this only makes 4 SMALL portions/about 4 ribs each.  I think everyone was left wanting more and not quite full. The ribs did come out incredibly tender and falling off the bone!  I will definitely make again!!

These deserve 100 stars! Recommended ALL the way.
So, I used boneless pork country style ribs, and they turned out very much like pulled pork. I boiled these with the seasoning for one hour. During that time I prepared my own BBQ Sauce (5 tbs ketchup, 5 tbs brown sugar, 2 tbs vinegar, 1 tbs lemon juice, 2 Worcestershire sauce, 1 teaspoon: salt, dry mustard powder and chili powder) After mixing it together and heating it up for a bit, I poured it over the ribs, and baked it for 1 & 1/2 hours. It makes them very sweet and juicy. I will make again and again! Thank you!

I found this recipe here 2-3 years ago...make it all of the time!  This is our favorite meal to take camping...complete 1st step at home a day or 2 before you go, boil in seasoned water, let cool a little, throw the pork in a ziplock or disposable Gladware, cover with bar-b-que sauce & freeze or refrigerate...throw them in your cooler, when you are ready to eat them, heat for about an hour in a disposable foil pan, covered tight with aluminum foil over a low fire...serve w/apple sauce, salad & dinner rolls-- eat great, even camping...no mess to clean up, just throw away the ziplock bag & foil pan!

Very similar to my own rib recipe which is also 5 star!  To enhance the flavor, cover the meat in equal parts beef broth and water, add one bottle of a "better" bbq sauce, (using a cheap variety will only give a vinegar like flavor to the ribs) add 5 cloves of finely sliced garlic, two onions cut into 8 parts, top 1/3 of a head of celery to include the celery leaves, and 1/4 cup worcheshire sauce.  Turn off the stove after 1 hour on a low, slow boil and let sit for 1+ hours.  Take out and place on a cookie sheet and lightly coat them with additional sauce until you are ready to finish them on the grill.  Absolutely superb!!!

WOWEE!!  I made these ribs last night for my boyfriend and I. He was in heaven!  He said, and I quote " Honey, we are going to make ribs this way for the rest of our lives!"  Yummy, tender juicy.  I took the foil off during the last 5 or 10 minutes put a bit more sauce on them, cause it does all slide off during cooking and then broiled them to get the edges just a little dark and crispy, and they did not dry out at all! Thanks Lloyd!

We are rib-lovers and we go out for bbq ribs often, but this recipe is great for when we feel like staying in. It's so easy. I usually boil mine for 45 minutes before cooking them and they come out perfect every time. They really do fall off the bone. You do have to make sure to use a really thick bbq sauce - and use enough to completely cover the ribs. I love these ribs!! We've made them 5 times so far since finding the recipe a few months ago.

Being from CA and marrying a TX man I' ve struggled in tuning into TX cusine. So when my husband asked me to cook something for his work potluck I wanted to hit it out of the ball park. After studying the reviews for a week I produced the "Best F'in Ribs" (Guys at DH's work)
I purchased 2 slabs of pork spare ribs (6.5 lbs) from Sams club and asked the butcher to cut them into sections of 3 for me (free) 
I BOILED WATER FIRST in a large stock pot and layered the ribs inside then I added: 3 TBSP g. powder, 3 Tsp of Pepper, about a TBSP Worchester sauce, 1 cup soy sauce, and 5-6 dashs of liquid smoke. 
I boiled for 1 hr. Then shut off the heat and covered and let it sit in the liquid for 1 hr 45 min.
I purchased a square roasting tray from the dollar store (easy clean up and didn't have to nag DH about bringing back any dishs). I layerd the ribs in the tray (meaty side up) and brushed generously with a cup of Cattlemans BBQ Sauce. Covered with foil and cooked for 45 mins. Took it out flipped the ribs (at this point its difficult since they're falling off the bone) and lathered with another cup of BBQ sauce. Covered and cooked for another 1/2 hr. Then I flipped them again added BBQ drippings from the tray and broiled for 6-8 mins on high to give it a charred look. Covered with foil and sent DH to work along with a roll of napkins. He works the midnight shift and by the next day the word had gotten around to to 2 other shifts of my "F'in Good ribs". I'm so proud of myself!

If there was a 10 star rating, I would gladly give it!  My ribs never turn out and these fell right off the bone-only a fork required.  My husband said he would pay for ribs like this.  I've shared this recipe with everyone.  It will be included in my personal cookbook.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! YUM! YUM!

Of course nothing can take the place of slow roasted ribs on the grill but that's not always practical or convenient. This is a nice substitute. When you really crave ribs and want to make it simple and easy, this is the way to go.

I have often cooked ribs in this style and sosmetimes I add an additional step. If you are going to finish the ribs on the BBQ grill, I cook the boiled ribs on the grill for a few minutes ( only 5 to 10 minutes) and then sauce them up for the real grilling. These extra few minutes on the grill before adding the sauce tightens up the meat to make them more like only grilled ribs. If you go right from the boiling process to grilling sauced ribs, there is a great chance of burning the ribs due to the high sugar content of the sauce.

OMG the best ribs ever!!! I normally do not write reviews & this is my 1st but I had to comment on this recipe! I love to grill & can grill just about anything but always had trouble with ribs up until now. Forget the Grill, you would not know these were baked! I did make some revisions based on other review & they came out great. I boiled them for 1hr & in addtion to the above added Worcestershire sauce, Liquid Smoke & Old Bay seasoning. I baked for 40min then added more bbq sauce then baked for an addtional 20min. I then brolied them uncovered for about 5min to crsip them up. Perfecto! I will never order ribs out again, these are 100x better! Another good idea is to boil some potatos in the same water after the ribs are done, gives them good flavor. I would give this 10 stars if I could!

Mom always made her Country style ribs this way, but it was a 'meal', and not just a dish because once she put the ribs in the oven, (w/bbq sauce) she skimmed the pork broth & added (skin on) quartered potatoes and cabbage wedges. Oooohhh, mmm, mmm, mmm! The ONLY thing wrong with this meal is trying to build the perfect bite! You have to smash the potatoes , use lots of butter, s&p - and the 'piece de resistance' is a small ladle of the hot broth over your spuds! (Be sure and season the broth heavily. We loved more pepper than salt.) Oh man... I gotta get some ribs in the house!

For being the first time ever making ribs, these came out amazing. Everyone wanted seconds and they literally fell off the bone. I boiled the ribs for about 30-45 min and then baked for about an hour and a half. I used more BBQ sauce than what the recipe called for. Thanks for the recipe!!

I have always boiled my ribs first, whether cooking them indoors or on the grill. It makes them so tender. I love this recipe, so easy and very yummy. Also, try adding about a cup of apple juice to your water while boiling the ribs. The apple juice tenderizes the ribs and it makes the BBQ sauce slightly caramelize to the ribs during cooking, especially if done on the grill.

OH MY GOODNESS!!! This was soooooo awesome. I cannot believe I made this! I was told this was the best ribs EVER! Better then any restaurant even! I must admit that this was better then I've ever had also. This is what I did and it was perfect! I covered the ribs with water in a huge stockpot. Added: 1 onion cut in wedges, 3/4 cup of soy sauce, pinch of garlic powder, black pepper. Boiled this for 45 mins. Let it sit in the marinade for 1 hour. Then brushed on my BBQ sauce- Sweet Rays BBQ- honey bbq. Transfered to the oven and baked for 1 hour. Make sure to reapply every 20 mins. Everyone will love this!

I had never boiled ribs or chicken for bbq or grilling until today.  OMG!! I will from now on. To the water I added soy sauce, garlic pwr, pepper and one onion cut in wedges.  No salt. "Simmer"  ribs for 40 min. I used beef ribs. No need to boil. Just simmer - low heat.   Turn off stove, cover pot and let sit 2-3 hrs to marinate in broth.  When cool, put ribs in large zip bag with BBQ sauce(I used Trader Joe's Kansas City BBQ sauce)Simply the best I'vd ever had.  Put bag in fridge until the ready to bake or grill.  We bbq'd the next day.  Next time I will grill them & see how they turn out.

My family devoured these! I followed the recipe but took some of the other suggestions for flavoring.  When boiling, I added a half cup of soy sauce, half an onion, and some peppercorns to the water.  After about 45 min., I removed them from the pot, sliced the ribs, put them in a glass dish and into the refrigerator, until I was ready to bake them.  Once ready for baking (about 3 hrs. later), I added KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce (family favorite) to them and baked them at 350 degrees (covered) for an hour.  After the hour, I uncovered them, flipped them, added more sauce, turned up the heat (to 450 degrees) for about 15 more min. to seal the flavor.  ABSOLUTELY DELISH!!!

I typically will only eat ribs that are grilled, but these were very good. I boiled them for 45 minutes & added a bit more garlic powder than asked for. After that, I put them in the oven for one hour & they came out great. I would recommend using a thick bbq sauce for these ribs. I'll be making these again! Thanks!

I am not a very good cook, but I always want to learn more and more recipes to challenge myself. I came across this recipe while googeling "Easy BBQ Rib Recipe." And it IS easy.. but tastes AMAZING as well! I use sweet baby rays BBQ sauce and usually make rice and a veggie with them... thanks for whoever posted this recipe!

I have been using this recipe for years.  I boil ribs and 1 hour and then baste them on the grill for 15-30 minutes until cooked to my likeness which is slightly charred.

I used this recipe my very first time making ribs last year... I was VERY happy with the results. This was SO easy. Definitely use a good bbq sauce. Sweet Baby Ray's is REALLY good. I've made this recipes multiple times now, each time I experiment with adding things to the pot when its boiling. My usual is salt, pepper, garlic & onion powder, chili powder and sometimes soy sauce. If I have a rack, I cut it in two and use two big pots. Let it boil for around 45 minutes. Take out, put in a baking dish... I usually put some sauce on the bottom, place the ribs in and cover with sauce. I use a foil cover for about 45 minutes. Then take off the foil and broil for about 4-5 minutes cause I like it a little crispy on the edges. You can baste with more sauce at any time during the baking. Delicious and really easy. I serve it with fries.

This was a 10 exactly as written.  I did make a couple of additions.  Had some Hickory Smoke Salt which I added to the boiling water and a dash or two of Worcestershire sauce.  Carmelized under the broiler for a minute or two at the end with a little extra barbecue sauce.  And, by the way, cooked the rice in the broth, froze the rest of the broth.  Unbelieveable!!  Thanks so much, I even have the start for next time.

These ribs are AWESOME!  Was very hesitant about boiling the ribs before baking - thought it would suck the flavor out.  Had some country style ribs in the frezzer that I had gotten on sale and did not know what to do with.  Followed other reviewers suggestions and added soy sauce, onion, garlic and a dash of worsteshire to the water - boiled one hour.  Put in baking pan, covered with Sweet Baby Rays & baked on low for an hour.  THE BEST ribs I have EVER had!!  Will make these over & over again!  Thanks!

I marinated these in minced garlic, worcestershire sauce and liquid smoke for about 4 hours. I then took other cooks' ideas of boiling with 1/2 cup of soy sauce, the marinade, and chunked onions and carrots for flavor. I grilled it on a preheated 350 degree grill for about 5 minutes on each side, basting with BBQ sauce. They were delicious! I will definately make this recipe again. I made this with spareribs, but would be good with any rib.

I had never made ribs before trying this recipe- my brother and I tried 3 different recipes from this web site in one day. This was by far the favorite recipe! The ribs were very tender and full of flavor. Yum!

I have been making ribs similar to this for over 40 years. However, I add 3 cloves of garlic to the water and "simmer" do not boil, for about 1 hour. Then smother ribs in your favorite barbeque sauce and place under oven broiler for about4-5 minutes, turn and add more sauce for another 4-5 minutes. Absolutely delicious!

Found this recipe to be so quick and so good.  Cooked for 30 minutes and then put in crockpot.  Ribs were very very tender and tasty.  Did add some soy sauce to the pot when boiling the ribs.

I modified the recipe slightly using 10lbs boned ribs, boiled in 50/50 beef broth and water, onion and garlic powder added for 1hr-20mins and then let sit in the hot water for 45 minutes awaiting dinner.  I then painted the BBQ sauce on and placed on the BBQ for 30 minutes low heat.  The results were ribs that were falling off the bone tender and a crowd pleaser.  An excellent recipe.

My husband's exact quote:  "It's a smashing success! I love it!"  I used venison/deer ribs and boiled it in water with the garlic power and black pepper.  I added about 2/3 cups of soy sauce and a splash of worcheshire sauce (enough to smell it when it boils).  I boiled it for 1 hour, then simmer in low for 1 hour.  Then I put BBQ sauce on the bottom of a Pyrex glass dish with 1 TBSP of brown sugar and wisked them together.  Then I layed the BBQ on top and slathered it with more BBQ sauce and covered it with a foil.  Then, because I have to be out of the house for a while, I set the oven at 225F and left it baking.  I came back home after 2.5 hours, took the foil off for 20 minutes while I prepared a salad and some other side dishes.  Delicious!!

Fantastic!  Great flavor!  I also mixed in an egg with my BBQ sauce so that it would stick to the ribs and, oh boy, was it wonderful!  Thanks for sharing.

This is an awesome recipe!  They were so easy to make...and so delicious to eat! I Did make a few changes: I boiled for about 2 hours and then cooked in the oven for right at an hour.  I also used pork baby back ribs, (Farmer John's) When boiling, I ground pepper and sea salt, and added garlic and onion powder. I did use a lot of seasoning, probably a good 2 or 3 tablespoons of each.  I also used a big lobster pot to boil them in.  I live in CA but found that the most amazing barbecue sauce to use is Sonny's, which you can order online at their website or if you're lucky enough to be on the East Coast, go right in to the restaurant to get it.  I used the sweet sauce, but they also have mild and tangy.  Some reviewers basted their ribs many times - I found that I only needed to do that twice. I cooked them in the oven for 45 mins, flipped them, recoated with sauce, and cooked another 15 minutes.  This is one of the best rib recipes ever!!!!

These ribs were fantastic!  I boiled them ahead of time and put them in ziploc bags in bar-b-cue sauce and froze them.  We made them when we took the kids and grandson camping.  I thawed them out, put them in a foil pan with a little more bar-b-cue sauce, and covered tightly with foil.  I warmed them on a grate over a low fire that was almost all coals.  They were cooked/heated through in approximately an hour. 

They were so tender, but just firm enough like ribs should be.  My kids couldn't stop thanking me!  

Great meal for a cook-out or a camping trip.  I will do this every time.

Unbelievable! I boiled the ribs for 45 minutes, then put them in the over for an hour and they were perfect. My husband compared them to the ribs at Outback! His favorite! These were so delicious and so very easy. I will make them again and again!

These were wonderful!  I've only made ribs once before, and they were tough and fatty and not very good.
This recipe created perfect ribs.  The meat literally fell off the bones!
I used baby back pork ribs.
I simmered the ribs for 45 minutes, then baked them, and finally finished them on the grill to give them a nice smokey, grill finish.  Delicious!

I lowered the salt to 1 Tbsp and it was much improved. If this recipe didn't call for so much salt, I would change my rating. 
Original review - Way too salty! This recipe called for 2.5 lbs of ribs, I had 4 lbs. I can be timid with salt so I decided to trust the recipe and go for it (I added the 2 Tbsp, I did not add more for the additional ribs). I ate seconds  on the veggies and bread because I couldn't eat the ribs. I love salty food too. I want to give this a four because I think some adjustment on the salt and these will be fine. However, I have to judge on what I got.

Super simple to make & very, very tasty!  Took the advice of some other reviewers & boiled ribs in a combo of beef stock & water and used 3 cloves of garlic instead of the garlic powder. Also added a couple of tablespoons of minced onion to the mix.  Baked ribs for 1 hour covered and then an additional half hour uncovered.  Boy, oh boy, were these good!!

I used this for my first attempt at making ribs and have to say this was amazing.  The turned out amazing as my 3 yr old ate a half rack by herself.  Really simple recipe that u can ad whatever you want.  Next time I will throw them on the grill for a few minutes after baking them, just to have that char taste.

This recipe is awesome, but one thing I would change is it says put your ribs in water, then bring them to a boil. I mean, I know this is a simple thing but it can make a huge difference if you bring the water to a boil first. Also I'd consider tossing in one part stock one part water as well with a bit of olive oil. That way the meat absorbed the stock and the olive oil. Still make it moist, but a more complex flavor due to the stock.

I made these ribs tonight and I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce (My absolute favorite)and cookied up a rack of boneless country style ribs. I was looking for a recipe for roasting them in the oven and this was exactly what I was looking for! I had never boiled my ribs before cooking them but they came out moist and tender just like we like them. These were absolutely wounderful! This one is a must if you haven't already tried it! I will definately keep this recipe around and use it again and again. Thank you for sharing!!

I've made ribs before, but never did they come out so tender that the meat literally fell off the bone. Made about 5lbs. of baby back ribs using this recipe for a party and my guest devoured them. Boiled for 1hr., baked for 2hrs and used an entire bottle of sauce (large).Thanks!

Simple, quick and tasty.  I added one can of "German-Style" beer to the boiling water for some flavor.  This one is a keeper.

Simple, fool-proof recipe, however, I did add more barbeque sauce. The method of cooking makes the ribs very tender. My family loved them!

I wish I can give this recipe 10 stars... The ribs are so tender, you don't need a fork or knife.. This is my new way to fix ribs, it was so good we ate it 3 nights in a row.. :)

Husband and kids loved this!  Like others, I cut the ribs into 2-3 rib sections, and started by boiling the ribs for 40 minutes, and then moved them to the crock pot on high for 3 hours.  Added a few onion slices to the bottom of the pot and 'painted' the BBQ sauce on. Tender and delicious.

This is our favourite way to do ribs.  The boiling really helps to make the meat very tender, to the point that they almost fall off the bone.  And finishing on the BBQ helps the sauce to stick and adds great flavour!

sooo tasty!! bought some country style spare ribs (boneless, don't know if they all are) and didn't really know how to cook them. the only flaw is that they were too salty. it was my fault though, as when i boiled them, i put garlic and sea salt in the water, then when i put them in the oven, i used garlic salt & black pepper. next time, i'll still boil them with salt water and garlic, but when i put them in the oven, i'll only add pepper and the bbq sauce. suuuper tender, delicious!

I just tried this recipe, and this is my first time ever making ribs from scratch. They were ahhhhhsome!!! My son and husband raved and chowed them down. So simple to make and so delicious! You have to try these! FAR better than any ribs you will have at a restaurant. 

I did add some onion, garlic cloves, celery and used a 50/50 ratio of stock/water for simmering, just because I had them left over and had to use them up. I simmered on low for about 1.5 hours, and then poured the BBQ sauce over them in the 9x13 pan and cooked as indicated for appx 90 mins. 

I used the bottle sauce b/c I did not feel like making sauce from stratch. I used the Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory/Brown Sugar flavor. They were great!!

I did not finish them off on the grill though. I have only a gas grill. These ribs are so tender - definitely would need a metal grill pan to finish them outside on the grill b/c they would just fall right thru the grates. 

For a first timer - they were just fantastic and made me look like a great cook! My son said, mom you make the best ribs EVER! 

THANK YOU so much for sharing the recipe!! : )

Being an advid cook....I always follow the recipe to a "T" for the first time....having the "loin ribs", I would NEVER make this recipe again.....Ribs were dry.....I will go back to my way of browning them first in the OVEN for an hour to get what grease there is on them off.....and slow cook them for 1 1/2 hrs. at 325.....using a porcelin roaster.....they are so tender that you can cut them with a knife...very disappointed in this recipe.....

To water add 1 onion and soya sauce.  After boiling for 1 hour, shut off heat and leave ribs in water for 1 to 2 hours.  Make BBQ sauce from this site.

Very good.  I followed some of the other reviewers' advice and added some spices to the water:  onions, chili powder, a little bit of hot sauce, liquid smoke.  I boiled them for about 45 mins and then into the oven for 90 mins.  Excellent!

Never, ever boil ribs.  Rookie recipe!  Always cook your ribs over indirect heat @ 250 degrees for 2-3 hours.  Baste frequently.  Remove from heat and cut into serviceable sections.  Place individual sections on separate pieces of foil and heavily baste.  Wrap sections in foil and return to heat for 90 minutes.   Remove and enjoy.

I like to make country ribs in the crock pot, but as of last night, I have a new go-to recipe, and this is it. I used boneless ribs, which can dry out easily, but these were the best country style ribs I've ever made. I followed the directions, except that I added some ingredients to the parboiling water. I found some wonderful hickory flavored sea salt, and I added 2 tsp. of it to the water. (Next time I'll add 3-4 tsp.) I also added fresh whole carrots, a bunch of celery w/tops, sliced onion, garlic, 2 bay leaves, and freshly ground black pepper to the water. Simmered for an hour or so and then let sit in the pot for 20 minutes (all I had time for). Baked the ribs, as instructed, for an hour.  Removed foil last 20 min. to slather on even more Sweet Baby Rays Honey Chipotle. Cooked whole red potatoes in the rib broth as the ribs were baking. Served the carrots as a delicious side dish. Thank you, Lloyd for this wonderful recipe!

it turns out perfectly nice! the recipe was surprisingly simple with such good result. took other's suggestion to boil 1 hour, bake 1.5 hours! soft enough but not too soft to fall apart from the bones.

I used boneless country style, simmered for 1 hour with the seasonings called for plus garlic power and herbs de province, then let the ribs sit in the water covered for 1 hour.  Baked at 325 for 1 hour with Sweet Baby Ray's.  They came out oh so tender and mouth watering delicious.  I used the water to make Stovetop stuffing for a side, with a yam baked alongside the ribs.

This is how my mom used to fix ribs.  Boil them, then cover them in foil and bake.  For newbies, the back side of ribs usually has a "silver skin" that you need to remove.  It's just a very thin membrane that you can cut and pull off.  Sometimes it's a little harder to do and other times it just pulls right off.

Delish!  I doubled the recipe.  I boiled for about 45 minutes.  Then poured 1 jar of bbq sauce over the 5 lbs of ribs.  It was enough.  Wonderful!

Many of the suposedly 5 star recipes I make from this site turn out less than amazing. Having always struggled with ribs and reading that you boil them, I didn't put alot of faith into this recipe. However this one performed exactly as the great reviews say! You cannot beat easy AND delicious which is just what this is. I followed the recipe as stated, used Cookie's bbq sauce and these were the best ribs I've been able to make. I also boiled the potatos in the "rib water" for mashed, and they were fantastic too. I may try adding carrots next time. This is going on the weekly menu! Thank you for a trully wonderful recipe.

I came on line to post a ribs recipe we learned from a Californian restauranteur - saw Lloyd's recipe and tried it.  Will never go back!  THe chef's recipe entails many more steps, and while a different flavor, was no better.  I will try to throw in a TBS or so of whole-seed pickling spice during the boiling step, however - then use Sweet Baby Ray's original. Bet that will bring the taste close, too!

To put this as simply as possible:  this is OUTSTANDING.  
Probably one of the very best recipes I've gotten on here.
I added a few of my favorite seasonings to the water while boiling ribs.  (one being a family favorite charbroil seasoning).
I used the water that the ribs are boiled in to boil potatoes, and wound up with mashed potatoes that were incredible.

Hands down:  MOUTH WATERING.

I threw everything into the crock pot and added one quartered onion, one cup of water and a teaspoon of liquid smoke.  I put my ribs in frozen and cooked on low for 9 hours.  These received rave reviews however next time I'm going to reduce the salt to 1 tablespoon.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Wow!  I couldn't believe how good these were!  By far the best recipe for bbq ribs I've ever made. The only change I made was to add cayenne pepper and dried minced onion to the water.  I used Sweet Baby Rays bbq sauce (the spicy one).  YUM!!!

I boiled in pineapple juice like someone else suggested.  Dashed in some garlic salt, pepper, Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce and boiled for about 15 minutes then lowered heat to a smaller boil for about 20 minutes then simmered another 20 minutes or so.  I have never boiled ribs so I really didn't know what to expect or what they would feel like when they were tender.  15 or 20 minutes in they were really tough and I was kinda scared.  So after all that I put aluminum foil (about 3 feet of it) in bottom of baking dish.  I laid it out put ribs on smothered in almost a whole bottle of bbq sauce (sweet baby rays brown sugar)  added a little more sugar to the sauce first, then folded the foil at the top and sides instead of covering just the top w/ foil.  These ribs were the very best I have ever had.  My boyfriend said they were the best he's had too.  I'm so excited to have made something so good that was so easy.  I am by no means domesticated and if I can do this, anyone can!

I no longer have to leave the house to get "the very best ribs " possible.  I added soy sauce, a little worchestsire sauce and beef boulion cubes to the water as they boiled. Boiled for hour and 20 mins. let soak for another couple hours. I then heated my gas grill (med ) and placed ribs on grill for an hour 15 mins turning occasionally making sure of no flare ups.  The last 20 minutes I coated the ribs heavily in sweet baby rays honey and brown sugar bbq sauce with a small amount of apple juice mixed in. I AM THE RIB GUY NOW thanks to this recipe.

Fantastic.  Made this with 5 pounds of pork spare ribs.  It was marvelous.  My hubby said it's the best he's ever had.  I boiled it for 45 minutes, after waiting almost an hour for the pot to come to a boil, and then baked for 1 hour and 15 minutes.  Served with fresh potato salad and roasted corn on the cob.  Just marvelous.  I will definitely be making these again.

I tried this recipe and was a bit skeptical because I never boil ribs before I prepare them.  I usually but them on the grill right out of the package.  These are by far the best ribs I have ever made.  I do add alot more garlic powder - usually 4 tbs. for a 5 lb. rack.  I have used this recipe for a full rack, for country ribs and also for pork neck bones and they all come out perfectly without any work! I usually spray the pyrex with Pam so that cleanup is a breeze. We use this recipe on a weekly basis and they never come out any other way than perfect! THANKS LLOYD!

Excellent! Even with all the great reviews, these were better than I expected. I had 2.79 lbs of country ribs. I boiled for 1 hour; baked for 1 hour, 15 minutes. Fell off the bone, had to use a spatula instead of tongs to put them on our plates.

This is a great cooking method for this cut of meat.  I think it works well with almost any cut of pork but I used bone-in country style ribs as the recipe calls for.  I boiled for 45 minutes then transferred to a pan lined with heavy duty foil, topped with KC Masterpiece, covered with more foil and cooked for about an hour.  They were very tender and tasty.

This was the first time Ever attempting to make ribs! I would have never expected them to turn out so wonderful, my boyfriend said they were better than going out to eat!!  I let the ribs stay in the boiling water for awhile then turned the heat down a bit and let them tender up. Over all about a half hour, for three big ribs. I also substituted the garlic pouder for fresh and dried garlic, more than the recipe called for, but we love a little more garlic. Put them in a roasting pan with a lid for exactly 1 1/2 hours. The meat was just falling off of the bone! Now my boyfriend thinks I can cook, and the ribs were terrific!! Hope this helps.

Excellent recipe and very easy with few ingredients. The ribs are nicely seasoned and go well with rice.  Will definitely make this one again and again.

I don't know what I could have done wrong or differently than everyone else, but these turned out brutally dry. Like many other reviewers I seasoned my water with salt, pepper, and garlic. I started with hot water from the tap and brought it to a boil with roughly 7.5lb of country style pork ribs, it took about 15 minutes to boil, and I left them in the water for an hour total (45 minutes of actual boiling). When I went to check them at an hour I pulled one out with the tongs and it broke in half when I grabbed it so I knew they were done. I then tossed them in my BBQ rub and put them in a pan lined with sliced onion rings with a little water and liquid smoke in the bottom. After an hour at 250 I pulled them out and tossed in sweet baby rays and then put them under the broiler for 3 minutes per side. They smelled great, they looked great, and they did actually taste great, kind of, but man were they dry. I tested this out with a group of 9 friends and they all had nice things to say, but I kept telling them they were liars because I thought they were awful!! I imagine it was the boiling that dried them out, so either I boiled them too long, or not long enough. But regardless next time I'll just stick with the grill like normal!

This recipe made for very tender ribs and I used our favorite bbq sauce, Sweet Baby Ray's.  I boiled them for an hour and then baked them in a covered dish for 1 and a half hours.

Read this recipe about 1+ years ago and have made our ribs this way ever since.  They come out so tender after boiling them for 30-45 minutes, then finishing in the oven for about an hour.  The ribs fall off the bone, they are so tender.  I serve them with additional warm BBQ sauce.  Only way I make ribs now if not on the BBQ.  So good!!

So easy...sooo good! Boiled in broth(seasoned with s&p,cayenne,chili flakes,and a dash of soy) for 45 minutes....Baked covered for 1 hour and uncovered 15 minutes. I have used several types of bbq sauce--Trader Joe's, Sweet Baby Ray's and homemade and they always come out delicious!

This has become my standard way of making ribs now.  It allows you to precook them (as I often do on a Sunday) and finish them for Monday's supper on the grill with sauce after work. Takes like fifteen to twenty minutes to finish on grill. Very tender and super easy!

Easily Excellent! That's all there is left to say. The reviews helped by explaining that the boiling takes about 45 mins to 1 hr.

Simple and fantastic, although it did feel time-consuming.  I had over 5 lbs country ribs so I doubled everything. I boiled for 45 minutes, then baked for 1.5 hours.  Tender and delicious.

This is a great recipe considering they are baked in an oven.  I boiled mine on low for 1.5 hours.  When I baked them I added some soya sauce to thin the BBQ sauce so I could cook them uncovered for a bit and get the sauce to really stick to the ribs.  They were definitely falling off the bone delicious!

I'd give it more stars if I could.  Super easy and super delicious!!  The meat fell off the bone....I slow boiled them for 45 mins.[smells kind of yucky but who cares]..then popped them in the oven..next time I'll use less sauce since we don't like a lot of that. Everyone was looking for more....will have to buy more ribs soon.

Very good recipe and it is so easy.  I took the advice of other and boiled the ribs in soy sauce and chopped onion wedges for 1 hour.  Then they marinated for 2-3 hours...then I baked them for 1.5 hours.  I used Sweet Rays Honey BBQ sauce, the whole bottle and I basted it with more sauce 15 minutes before the specified cooking time was up.  Delicious!  Definitely using again.

I've now made these several times. This recipe is excellent and now I'm in charge of ribs at my house.

I do enjoy adding different ingredients-not necessarily the same ones each time. Beer added to water, soy sauce in place of salt and a few cut-up onions all lend to this fabulous recipe. Thanks so much Lloyd!

I used baby back ribs and Phils BBQ sauce. :) It was absolutely delicious although I'm sure it could've tasted even better barbecued! I boiled it for ~50 minutes and placed it in the oven for 1 hr 20 minutes. This recipe is very delicious especially served with corn.

The basic recipe was good, but if you have the time, making them the way I did today takes good and turns it into fantastic. I took advice from several different reviews and made my own recipe. I started by adding soy sauce, a cut up onion, garlic powder and pepper to the pot. I let the ribs simmer for an hour instead of boil. I left them in the pot for 2 hours and made the BBQ sauce suggested by MBCHEERS99. Although delicious, I found the sauce too thin for my liking, so i added molasses and I've since decided to subsitute molasses for the brown sugar from now on. I put the ribs and sauce in a ziploc bag in the fridge until i was ready to bake them (about 4 1/2 hours). I basted during baking. After all that, I broiled them for about 5 minutes to carmelize and darken them. Time consuming, but absolutely delicious!! I also saved and froze the meat juice to use next time I make them. It will save me some time.

My husband absolutely loves these ribs! He gobbled them down and couldn't believe how they were falling right off the bone. These ribs were easy to make, a tiny bit time consuming, but totally worth the wait! They melt in your mouth. The real important thing is to choose a delicious barbecue sauce to smother them with and you'll have a true winner!

I wowed the masses with this recipe. I boiled the meat for an hour and baked them for 45 mins. What I did different was added a half a can of beer to the water. And in my Bbq sauce I added steak sauce and mustard. DELISH!!!!

Five stars only if you grill them instead of putting them in the oven.  4 stars in the oven.

I am picky, so I don't like barbeque sauce and I am only cooking for myself, so after they're done boiling, I wrap them in aluminum foil and place them on the rack and bake them for an hour. Delicious!

These ribs were excellent.  I took the suggestion of another reviewer and put soysauce in the water.  I boiled them in soysauce, water, garlic powder and pepper.  Tasted the water to be sure it was flavored strongly enough with the soy sauce and then I didn't need to add any salt.  I then baked them for an hour flipping them half way through to put BBQ sauce on the other side.  I also made some chicken thighs along with it.  The ribs fell off the bone.  Great taste

I was skeptical about this recipe but they were AMAZING! And I'm not even that great of a cook.  I boiled them for about 40 min and baked them for an hour and a 1/2. Enjoy! :)

Holy cow or pig I should say!  Turned out perfect, great directions.  I did add some soy sauce, onion and garlic to water because I wanted to use it for stock for won ton soup the next day.  Also made my own BBQ sauce.  I was always turned off by boiling them first but I will never make these any other way!  Cheers thanks for sharing!

Great Rib recipe!!! In addition to the seasoned water, I also boil a half chopped onion in the water as well. I also used another reviewers advice of adding soy sauce to the boiling water. I boil for an hour, then baste one side of the ribs with bbq sauce and bake for an hour, I then turn the ribs over, baste the other side and cook for an additional hour (covering w/ foil for the whole cooking period).

Boiled "country style" pork ribs as directed, but added 1/2 cup soy sauce and omitted the salt, then grilled. Tender and delicious!  Next time, I'll start them earlier so they can marinate longer.

To answer the previous question, I swear by Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.  This recipe was so good, I wanted gnaw on the bones.  I did change the cooking method.  I followed the recipe up to boiling the ribs and placing them in the pan, which I lined with foil.  Instead of using 1 cup of sauce I poured on the entire bottle.  After placing foil on top and sealing the edges I set the oven for 250 degrees and left them in the oven for six hours.  These are great served with Texas toast.

This recipe is AWESOME! I literally had NEVER tried to cook ribs before and these were a total hit. I boiled them for 45 minutes and then moved directly into a 9x13 pyrex. I topped with Austin's Own regular bbq sauce (I think it might be a Texas specific product, tastes very similar to Stubb's), topped with foil and baked for 1 hr. 30 mins. Then I sprinkled with brown sugar and put under the broiler for a few minutes to kind of crystalize the sauce. DELISH!

This recipe is so easy and so delicious.  I love adding the soy sauce in the water while boiling which is key.  I also don't use as much bbq sauce because I find it's a bit much.  But overall it's fantastic.

These were very good and melt in your mouth tender! Took others advice and used about 3/4 c soy, 1/4 c Worcestershire, 1 tsp liquid smoke and quartered an onion when boiling. I started them early so I took them off the heat, covered them, and let them sit for about an hour before baking. Yum!!

These were some of the BEST ribs we have ever had, and they were so easy!! I did do a few things differently:  I marinated the chops with pressed garlic and worcestire for most of the day and then used fresh garlic in beef broth with 1/2 cup soy sauce added for boiling the meat. It's an awesome recipe and can't wait to make it again!!  Thanks!

These turned out Excellent!!!  They were soooo tender and fell off the bone.  Made it for a girlfriend of mine and she just kept on talking about how good they were.  She said it was better than a restaurant and gave it a 10.  I'll definately be making these over again.

These ribs were fantastic.  They are so tender they fall right off the bone.  The only change I made to the recipe is I boiled the ribs in chicken broth instead of water.  I will definately make these again.

Excellent recipe!  I tweaked it just a little bit.  I boiled the ribs for about an hour.  I then put them in a Reynold's Foil Bag (easy cleanup, no extra pan to clean!) with about 3/4 of an 18 oz. bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce.  Put the bag in a pan and baked at 300 degrees for 2 hours.  The meat just fell of the bones.  Yum!

Excellent ribs, I used boneless country style and they turned out so fork tender & delicious.  Thanks for this great method.

Made this for the 4th of July, and it was really good! My company was late, so I ended up cooking them a bit long, but did broil them for a couple of minutes so they'd be a little crispy on the outside.  So simple and so good!

I have made this recipe a couple of times for my husband and 5 year old son. They love it. The ribs are always so tender and juicey.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I loved this recipe!  I added 4 ladles full of the water that I boiled the ribs in, into the rib pan before I put the jack daniels bbq sauce on.  (Just to keep them from getting dry)  Every so often I would uncover the ribs & spoon the saucy juice on top of the ribs.  They were even better the next day whn I cut them up into small pieces & simmered them in more BBQ sause & 1/2 cup left over water (that was stored in the fridge).  Juicy BBQ Pork Sandwiches!

AH-Mazing! I used Trader Joe's "Carolina Gold" bbq sauce and it was incredible. Ribs were tender and awesome. I look forward to trying different bbq sauces with this same recipe. The only thing I would make note of is that the directions don't say about how long the ribs will need to boil. It simply says to boil until they're "tender"... I couldn't tell when that actually was. I got the info from Google though (30 mins).

I have used this recipe many times since I found it a few months ago. Its a perfect way to cook country ribs. I have tried it with the BBQ sauce and without using a dry rub and let everyone add their own BBQ sauce to their taste. Its a winner!

Read the reviews and took some suggestions from them!  An easy recipe, made the house smell amazing!  I added some soy sauce, sherry wine and minced garlic along with onion wedges to the recipe.  After boiling, I let the ribs sit in the broth for an hour before placing them in the oven!  I made coleslaw, cornmeal muffins and corn to go with the ribs and topped it off with a  Guinness!   A grand meal indeed!!!

Easy & good.  I used bone in pork ribs and they turned out wonderfully.  The only change I made was that I boiled mine in a mix of one beer & the rest water.  I don't know if the beer made any difference in the taste, however, it did make the house smell really good when cooking.  I will definitely make ribs this way again.

I never thought I would make ribs but now I make them every time we have a holiday weekend. They are so tender and delicious. The only thing I do different is I brush a significant amount of BBQ sauce on the bottom of the baking dish before putting the boiled ribs in it. Then when I flip them after an hour, they already have a nice crust on the bottom side. Then I add more sauce once flipped. I suggest using a disposable pan so you don't have to worry about the mess this creates.

First of all, my house smells wonderful!! These ribs are FANTASTIC. I followed some others and added a quartered onion, worcheshire and soy sauce (had marinated the ribs for two days in apple cider and seasonings).  Boiled the ribs for an hour, turned off the heat and let them sit for an hour in the broth.  Placed the ribs in a pan and slathered them with Sweet Baby Rays (my fav!!), covered with foil and baked for 30 minutes. I then flipped them over, poured another 3/4 cup of BBQ sauce and cooked for another 30 minutes covered.  Broiled them on high for 5 minutes. Oh, also boiled red potatoes in the pork broth and they were amazing !! Thank you Lloyd!!

Just  made these for dinner! Amazing, fall off the bone ribs!
I boiled them in my stock pot, cut into three or four bone sections ( I used side ribs) with half an onion, fresh garlic and ingredients listed above for about 45 mins. I then turned off the gas and let them soak throughout the day. I then divided them up into two 9x13 glass dishes and poured on my Sweet Baby Rays honey BBQ sauce, covered them in foil and baked for about an hour and ten mins. Hubby then placed them on the grill for 7-8 mins on high to sear them.  Turned out amazing! Will be using this method from now on!

The best ribs ever.  Have had this recipe for quite a while and finally made it - now I will make it over and over.  I made these for my husband as I generally am not a fan of ribs - I am now!!  The only change was to add some extra bbq sauce, as we prefer lots of sauce.  These were so tender they almost fell apart as I was removing from the baking dish.

Followed the recipe as stated. I boiled for 45 minutes and baked for 1 hour.  After 30 min, I turned ribs over and added more bbq sauce.  I can't wait to make again.  I used Original KC Masterpiece sauce and it worked great.

This is the first time I have rated a recipe so understand that this is a great recipe with excellent results. Now I always disliked people who write a review and then change everything because what's the point? I did however use country style ribs and when I boiled them, I added several cloves of garlic and a whole onion cut in quarters just to infuse more flavor in the ribs along with more seasonings. The results, I never got a chance to eat them because my roommates eat everything before I could get to them and exclaimed that these were the best ribs they ever had.....I guess I'll have to make them again....lol

These ribs were amazing!  I used boneless country-style ribs and used only 1 Tbl. of salt in the boiling water.  I baked them covered for 45 minutes then uncovered and broiled for 5 minutes.  We didn't miss that extra tablespoon of salt!

So easy and very delicious! We love garlic, so I substituted 4 large garlic cloves for the garlic powder, then saved and added them to the barbecue sauce. When done in the oven, I turned the broiler on for 5-10 minutes to make them a little crispier. Served with homemade cornbread and coleslaw, and we ate much more than we should have!

This recipe was so simple, and was sooo delicious! the only thing I did differently was to cut the membrane first from the back of the ribs before boiling and then to  line the baking sheet with foil and spray it for easy clean up.

These did taste really good, but my husband and I both wanted our ribs crisped up on the grill for a few minutes to give it that realy BBQ flavor. Also, the recipe doesn't state how long to boil the ribs. I boiled mine for 45 min, but it needed more time. Maybe an hour or more.

I've made this recipe twice already.  I'm about to make them for our superbowl dinner. The ribs just fall apart and have so much flavor!  I never made ribs before because I thought they would be too hard to make.  However this recipe makes it super easy!  Thanks so much!

My tweaked version (the comments are GOLD on this website btw) I added a teaspoon of onion powder, no pepper,  and 1/4 cup of Maggi seasoning (very similar to soy sauce, more flavorful and potent in that you don't need as much) during the boiling phase. Also used nearly a whole bottle of Bullseye BBQ sauce. It was the only one in the grocery store that didn't list corn syrup as an ingredient.

This was excellent an really easy. I boiled for about 60 min. Added a cup of soy sauce and some lemon juice. Basted with Stubbs bbq baste and baked at 325 for 75 min, perfect. Meat was sooo yender and juicy. Cant wait to make again.

I threw a splash of worcestershire sauce and liquid smoke into the pot with the other ingredients as it boiled.  Boiled for 45 minutes per other reviewers.  I didn't measure the BBQ sauce, just made sure they were thoroughly covered. Yummmm! Thank you for the recipe!

I used the recipe and added some of the things that people suggested such as Soy, Worcestershire, etc. and they turned out amazing.  I did boneless country style ribs and they're amazing each time.

SOOOOOOO YUMMMYYYY!!!  I used boneless country style pork ribs.  I boiled them in water, minced garlic, soy sauce, pepper, celery salt and steak seasoning.  Boiled for about 1 hour then followed another reviewers suggestion and alloewd to cool in the cooking water.  I refridgerated overnight since I wasnt going to serve them for dinner until the next day.  I used regular BBQ sauce and a few tbsp of store bought General Tso sauce in a jar.  Also added a very little bit of water to the bottom of the pan to prevent scortching from the sugars in the sauces.  I covered and baked for about 1 1/2 hours. SOOOOOO DELICIOUS!! They came out very tender but not so tender that they were shredding.  Hubby must have complimented these a dozen times.  I used to make country ribs in the crock pot, not anymore.  This recipe is my go to now!  Thanks LLOYD!

Very good and fall-apart tender. I finished them off under the broiler for about 5 min per side.

Delicious! So easy and so good! I love them with Sweet Baby Ray's Honey bbq sauce. The boiling first and cooking covered at a low temp make them so tender. I used a boneless rib- and it was falling apart like pulled-pork. They were just as good, if not better, warmed up the next day!

Added a few more spices while boiling.  Put the cooked ribs in a Ziploc bag with some BBQ sauce for a few hours before baking.  I'm normally not a rib fan, but these were outstanding!  Use boneless pork loin ribs.  Great recipe!

I was skeptical these would turn out as good as people raved since they are so easy but they really are!!  I followed the recipe to a "t" but I also added a packet of taco seasoning for more flavor.  My husband and kids all raved how good they are which is impressive because pork is one of our least favorite meats.  This is a keeper!!

I have never prepared bbq ribs, for some reason they sound intimidating. However, that is my boyfriend's favorite meal, so I decided to follow this recipe and I'm so glad I did! It was Perfect!!!! The ribs were super tender. Both him and my daughter were so impressed! We loved them!

Great, wonderful flavor, and falling off the bone tender.  I boiled for 45 minutes, baked for an hour, and threw them on the grill for 15min.  They turned out FANTASTIC!

Loved these!  I used 5 lbs. of bone-in country ribs which were pretty big.  I boiled them for an hour then cooked as directed except put the pan on the BBQ cuz my oven was on the fritz.  Very tender and good.  One bottle of BBQ sauce was plenty.  Thanks for sharing!

These ribs were delicious! They came out very tender and juicy. I used bulls eye bbq sauce, original and TX flavor and it was sssoooo good! Even though it takes a while to cook, it was easy to make while keeping an eye on 2 small babies!

DELICIOUS! As others suggested, I added onion powder to the mix, used baby back ribs, and a whole lot of BBQ sauce. Husband absolutely loved them and said it was the best meal I had ever made, which is a huge compliment coming from a BBQ fanatic. Thank you - this is definitely a keeper!

As a vegetarian, my boyfriend is always giving me  about cooking meat. He seems to think my cooking skills are as limited as my palet. To prove him wrong, I made him these ribs for dinner tonight. He said, and I quote, that they were the best ribs he's ever eaten and they were even better than his dads (which is saying quite a lot!) I took the advice of some other reviewers and  changed the recipe just a bit. First, I added cumin to the boiling water and boiled for an hour. I let it marinade for 30 minutes then baked it at 350 for an hour, adding more bbq sauce (sweet baby rays) after 40 minutes. This will definitely be a reoccuring dish in our house!

These ribs wonderful. Some of my family members can be a little picky. However, I got rave reviews on this recipe, 6 out of 6 members, so I wouldn't change a thing! I'm just ready to start making them again for tomorrow. I boil them a day ahead, then just get them ready to put in the oven the next day. TERRIFIC :)

Great weekend dish!  I boiled the ribs for about 45 mins and then baked them for an hour.  I took the advice of others and baked them for an extra 20mins on 400 uncovered.  AWESOME!  I also spiced up the boil with some red pepper flakes and raw onion.  We will totally make again!

I boiled the ribs for about 15 minutes I add in a a couple tablespoons of vinegar to the water (it makes them as tender as boiling them for 45minutes or longer ) and instead of putting them in the oven I put them in the crock pot while I ran around and did my errands, they turned out AWESOME!! I worked at a BBQ joint for many years and these topped them for sure!! Before we were ready to eat, while the green beans were cooking I lined a cookie sheet w/foil and placed all the ribs on it and brushed the crock pot sauce over them and broiled them until the sauce was nice and crackly. I put the rest of the sauce in a gravy boat for everyone to use as they wanted!  FYI....I also use Sweet Baby Rays sauces! Mixing them is a GREAT combo of flavors and each flavor is not too intense!

I've always wanted to make ribs but was too skeptical about how they would turn out. This recipe is great for those who are skeptics like me!  I used beef ribs instead of pork, boiled it for 45 min,then marinated it in a Korean Asian Pear and Apple BBQ sauce for 1 hour in the refrigerator, then baked them at 350 degrees for 25 min and then reduced the temp to 200 degrees, brushed the ribs with more of the Korean BBQ sauce and continued baking for another 1.5 hours; during the last 5 minutes, I removed the foil, brushed with more bbq sauce, baked it for carmaelization and then it was done.  The meat was so tender but not to where it was falling apart all over the place - just enough to continue holding on to the bone.  My family loved it - my husband even asked if we could have it again for dinner the next night!  Thanks Lloyd for the recipe!

These were definitely simple! I would try making your own BBQ sauce, or using one that you really love. I got a different sauce than I usually buy and it just wasn't out of this world. But the ribs were so tender! I used boneless country style ribs and boiled them for about 45 minutes before baking about 2 hours. This was even better knowing that I got the ribs on sale!

Instead of salt I used a cup of soy sauce and WOW - these were by far the best ribs I've ever made!  Everyone loved them.  Can't wait to try this out on chicken too.  This is my new rib recipe and we can finally enjoy BBQ Ribs in the winter now!  Thanks for a great recipe.

I tried this recipe out based on all the positive reviews and boy, were they good!!! I made them for my family then had to leave for an appointment. They called me and were all on speakerphone raving, oohing and awing. My oldest said they were better than Chili's ribs. I followed the recipe pretty closely. I had about 4-1/2 lbs. of ribs so I almost doubled the seasonings and I chop a half of an onion into the pot too. Boiled for 1 hour, baked for 1 hour & 15 minute with Stubb's BBQ sauce. They were so tender and delicious and I will definitely be making these again!

I made regular spare ribs. You know, the cheap stuff the supermarket puts on sale. I cut 4 1/2 lbs of ribs into individual pieces. Added them to a pot of water with 1 tbl chopped garlic, 10 peppercorns, 1/4 cup worcestershire sauce, tsp of salt, 1 medium quartered onion. I brought all to a boil and  then lowered the heat and barely simmered for 1 1/2 hours. Poured off the liquid and then poured barbecue sauce over all. Let it sit in sauce until I was ready, and then grilled over medium heat, basting occaisionly until they looked like I like them! Everyone loved them!! No fuss no muss and very adaptable to your taste.

Made this recipe with the modifications suggested by BOONIE12, reviewed on May 2007. I omitted the salt, and added 1 c. soy sauce to the water. Since I had double the ribs I boiled the for 1 hr. 15 minutes, and then let them sit in the broth cooling for 2 hours. When removed to place on the grill to finish, they were already falling off the bone. That wasn't a bad thing, but I think I will reduce boiling time to 45 minutes next time, as the ribs will continue to cook while cooling. I threw them on a medium heat grill with sauce for 5 minutes on each side, and there were no leftovers. I am very happy with this no fail recipe, as grilling country style ribs in the past resulted in tough ribs. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

This one's a keeper...even my reserved hubby commented, saying, "wow, that's good stuff!" I boiled for an hour, let them sit in the water since I had to leave briefly, then baked in the oven. The sweet baby ray's sauce made a wonderful flavor, and at the end of the baking time, I turned them over, re-basted, and cooked for 15 more mins. YUMM!! Thanks for the post!

I made these yesterday for 4th of July and they were the best I've ever had. This is why: I used beef ribs since I don't eat pork, I boiled them in the slow cooker on low heat for eight hours, with just water and a little soy sauce. I thought I had over done them because only half the bone had meat on it, actually, the only thing that fell off the bone was the fat. I removed the ribs to a glass plate and generously brushed them with my favorite bbq sauce. They sat that way about 15-20 minutes while we prepared the grill, and soaked up most of the sauce. You only really have to let the grill go for about ten minutes or until the fire settles a little before you start grilling these since they are already cooked and just need to be blackened. They cook really quickly and are amazing.  I have never had ribs with almost all the fat taken off, which is way better, neither have I had such tender ribs in my life. Just make sure you skim the fat out of your slow cooker before you dump the water down the sink, I made that mistake and was scraping coagulated fat out of my sink when the dishwasher was running, ew!

Update: Made these again, and wow just as good. MMmmmmm 5/21/2008 This was a great rib recipe. I changed my boiling recipe though, instead of water I used...a bottle of beer, a box of broth, water, some red hot, worchestershire sauce, soy sauce, and more spices. So, the meat would be more flavorful.

I prepped these by boiling and allowed two of my sons to finish the meal while I went off to a women's retreat.  I came home to hear of "how awesome" these ribs are, I will have to try them now!  I boiled the ribs with seasonings and onion for 45 minutes.

My husband and I both enjoyed this.  It was a quick meal to make too!  I followed some other reviewers suggestions and boiled the ribs for 45 min. w/ pepper, salt, garlic powder, onion (wedged), 1/2 c. soy and 1/2 c. terriki sauce.  I then put in a zip lock bag with 3/4 bottle of BBQ sauce and put in fridge overnight.  I put them in a pan the next day, covered, and cooked for 45 min in the oven and then for about 10 min each side on the grill.  They were perfect!  Served w/ cauliflower and mac n cheese.
Update:  I made this again as it was originally written and I think it was better with my adjustments above.  It was still good, but I think the soy/terriyki added additional flavor.

Absolutely 5 stars!  Excellent, juicy, tender & better than a restaurant!  Followed directions by boiling in brine mixture for 45 minutes (added dried onions to brine), then allowed to soak in brine for 1-2 hours, followed by baking for 1.5 hours at 325.  Used WAY more than 1 cup of BBQ sauce!

I use the recipe every time we make ribs. Simple and delicious! Simmer the ribs for about an hour and bake them for another hour. I usually pour barbecue sauce into the pan and then place the ribs on top so they're in a little pool of sauce and brush a little more on top. The ribs are usually so tender, the meat falls right off the bone! DELICIOUS!

WOW!  After boiling the ribs, I let them marinate overnight in BBQ sauce.  The next day, I threw them on the grill and basted them with more BBQ sauce.  They were fall off the bones tender!  WOW!

This recipe was great. Easy and delicious- truly No Fail. The only change I made is baking the ribs in a sauce of equal parts BBQ sauce and beeth broth and basting the ribs 30 min before they were done. Thanks Lloyd!

I was very skeptical at first of making ribs this way.  I had never heard of boiling them but I tried it and it turned out great!  They were tender to where you could cut them with your fork but not fall apart tender.  A good bbq sauce is Sweet Baby Rays.  Its such a good bbq sauce I use it all the time!  If you want to try making your own sauce, try the sauce in the recipe "Sylvias Ribs" on this site.  Its a nice and tangy sauce.  Something different and very good!

I used these on boneless beef ribs. Turned out very tender, but a little dry because I didn't add sauce toward the end of baking like others recommended. I will use this recipe again.

These ribs turned out really delicious!! My meat wasn't falling of the rib, maybe I didn't boil long enough, I only boiled for 45min, but they still turned out really great. This was my first attempt at making ribs, I can say that this will be the receipe I'll use every time. Thanks!

Very easy recipe, and tasty too.  Tender ribs fall apart with a fork.  This is a good staple to make the rotation.

This was absolutely delicious! The meat was so tender, every part of it.  The best part about it is the simplicity of the ingredients, I didn't have to go out grocery shopping  to pick up all sorts of ingredients just to make this!  This I will make over and over again for dinner with family and friends.  With this dish, you can never go wrong!

This is delicious!  I've been afraid to tackle ribs before - they seemed so intimidating with all the boiling, baking, grilling,...  This was easy and is now one of our family's favorites.

HOLY COW! This recipe was the stuff. I had never made ribs like this before. I boiled them in salt, pepper, garlic salt and minced garlic for 2 and 1 half hours. Had to spoon the meat out of the pot it was so tender. Then I topped with more minced garlic, reserved pineapple juice from my Dads B-Day cake and BBQ sauce, cooked for 1 hour and Yummy. I will be making this one over and over again.

These ribs are so easy! I made them for superbowl
and my son just asked me to make them again. I doubled the amounts for four of us.  It wouldn't have been enough if I hadn't.

This recipe is so easy to do and everyone loved it at my house.  We always used the slow cooker to do ribs, but this is much faster for the days I forget to start it in the morning and my family likes it much better.

My husbands preferred method of eating barbeque, is to be cooked over an open oak fire. I made these last night and he couldn't get enough! I added more barbeque sauce, uncovered it and broiled on low for the last 10 minutes. Tender, juicy and delicious! I served this with your Baked Potatoe Salad (casserole)and fresh corn-on-the cob, perfect!! Thanks, Terri

This recipe was so very easy to make, (therefore the title, simple ribs!) and delicious results!  The pork was so tender I couldn't believe I cooked it.  A very important factor was the bbq sauce, use a thick one so it coats the pork, not a thin one that will cook away and leave the pork dry.  I used Sweet Baby's Ray's-AWESOME!!  
Thanks for this one!

Wonderful! Such an easy recipe to follow and make.  Could not believe how tender the meat was.  Had to boil the ribs for about 2-2 1/2 hours before putting in the oven.  Found I needed more than 1 cup of sauce - used a whole bottle.  Everyone loved it! Thanks for an easy, tasty recipe. - DSB - Colorado

Incredible and tender!  I boiled the ribs at night, poured on homemade BBQ sauce and cooked them the next day.  Overall cooking time does take a while, but it's worth every minute!

My brother uses this recipe and I've always found it an affront to BBQ and my taste buds. Boiled meat? No thanks. Do it the right way, slow cooked, there's no comparison.

I followed the seasoning  part ...but I used a little more garlic and a little more pepper and boiled the country ribs for 45 minutes.  Then put a base of bbq sauce....ribs on top covered with the rest of the sauce and covered with aluminum foil (I only used 16oz for three lbs of ribs) ....and baked them at 325 degrees for 45 minutes. The sauce looked way too runny so I finished them under the broiler in the same pan a few minutes on each side just to thicken.   They were waaaaay over the 160degree recommendation and I was worried that they would be dry.  They were AMAZEBALLS! !!! So tender and juicy.   I love this recipe !!! .....and my 14 year old son does too

So delicious. Always use Sweet Baby Rays Honey Chipotle. Comes out so tender and falling off the bone. The only way to make Country Ribs.

Read about 30 reviews and took their advice:  put ribs in pot and covered with water.  Boiled 45 min with water and seasonings (garlic powder, salt, onion powder, soy sauce).  Basted with BBQ sauce, baked 30 minutes, turned over ribs, basted again and baked for another 30 minutes.  They were amazing.

Being alone now it's hard to cook for just one.  I really love that these recipes can be changed to the amount of servings you need.ii I had 5 small boneless country style ribs.  I love this recipe. It is super easy and is wonderful.  You can make small changes or additions without altering the outcome! I ALWAYS Season my meat with salt and pepper before doing anything to it to begin the layer of flavors.  Especially pork and chicken, they are somewhat bland and really need the help.  Before placing the ribs in a pot of water, i seasoned them with salt, pepper, onion and garlic powder, and sprinkled with cumin and chili powder.  I rubbed the seasoning into the meat, and,seared the meat in a hot skillet with a little canola oil!  After searing on 1 side, after about 2-3 minutes, I placed them in the pot of  water for slow boil, simmer about an hour. In the water i placed a clove of garlic i smashed to release its flavor a little..  I took the ribs out of the water and put in a casserole dish.  I placed enough of the water to come up 1/2 on the meat to keep moist. I covered the dish with foil.  I basted every 20-30 minutes until tender.  Then I drained the liquid, uncovered and caramelized with just sauce.  They were wonderful, flavorful, and super moist!!  Great basic recipe to adapt any way 
you want!

Yummy! And really easy to make. I uncovered the foil for the last 10 min or so. I will add some more bbq sauce at this stage next time for more flavour.

Very easy and very good. I only had a little over 1 lb of ribs so I halved the recipe. I boiled the ribs for 45 min and followed the recipe as written plus I added more BBQ sauce 20 min before it was done and baked for a total of 1 hour. It was tender but not fall off the bone tender. Next time I'll try boiling for a little longer and baking it in less time if I'm using the same amount of ribs. The internal temperature was way too high but it was still very good and not dry at all.
I used the liquid to boil my potatoes for mashed potatoes and it gave it a great flavor.

Lloyd  ,you're the rib MASTER! 
I followed your recipe basically verbatim , but I also added my own flair , and needless to say they turned out remarkable. One of the best dinners I have ever made. This was my first time making ribs , ever. I bought a big pack of large country ribs (all separate , not on a rack) a little over 2 lbs worth. I then filled a large pot with sweet rib rub , garlic salt , minced onion seasoning , Salt, pepper, and Boiled the ribs a little under an hour.  I then put them ina large tupperware covered them with regular kraft bbq sauce and put them in the fridge until later.  I then placed the ribs on pan added more sauce and rub and broiled for 5 min. Then switched it to bake at 325 for an hour and twenty min. The last 20 min of baking I added more sauce and the sauce infused into the ribs so perfect ! I paired the ribs with velveeta shells and cheese and dinner rolls.  It was the perfect meal.  A++

Talk about a mouth watering, moist, AMAZING piece of meat!! And im not talking about my husband either! ;) This really was amazing. I boiled my pieces of boneless rib meat pieces for about 45 to 50 minutes because they were pretty thick, maybe about 2 in thick or so. Then putting the meat in the covered baking dish lined with foil, then covered with foil, then we used hickory and brown sugar Sweet Baby Rays sauce "AMAZING" and put them in the over at 325 for 1 hr and 15 min. Came out PERFECT!!! Bon Appetite friends! :)

YUM!!!  boiled the meat for an hour, then oven for an hour. came out wonderful; soft, off the bone easy, great taste, not dry at all. I used the hour of oven time to boil potatoes in the same water and they were the best mashed potatoes I've ever made.  I also boiled cabbage in it as I'm a fan.  choose your bbq sauce wisely, pick one you really like, it will make a difference. Thanks Lloyd!

Made this tonight: Believe it or not I was out of chicken bouillon of any kind so used the chicken flavor packet out of some ramen noodles; any ship in a storm:). Turned out lovely and the family finished it off. I didn't change a thing (except the flavor packet). Thank you so much for a simple but great recipe.

We have used this recipe several times since finding it a few months ago.  Always tasty, never a complaint! Always use with pork country style ribs as they seem to go on sale frequently. I toss a bottle of beer (a stout) into the boiling mix.

I've been cooking for over 25 years (also a fan of this site for quite some time) but never made bbq ribs. Recently, we went to a restaurant extremely famous for their ribs. They were scrumptious but pricey and I thought surely I could find a recipe for ribs that tasted similar. I chose this recipe because of its simplicity and five star rating (from 777 reviews so far). I used Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ sauce and made about 5 lbs of ribs for three people and just used a cookie sheet to bake them. Instant WINNER! Could not be easier to make yet seems like you went all out to cook a special meal.  I also like the idea of basting the ribs half-way through with more sauce while they're in the oven.  

An interesting side note, tho. One time, my oven door broke (white part pulled away from the metal) in the middle of baking these.  I was able to continue baking the ribs but wasn't able to baste them because the door wouldn't stay open.  Since they weren't as saucy, my son used the Sweet Baby Rays as a dipping sauce...and...it was the stuff...that DREAMS are made of!  I was crazy about the taste of the tangy uncooked sauce mixed with the yummy, melt in your mouth flavor of the ribs. I'm thrilled I found this recipe.

So i tried Chef John's verison making ribs in the oven as well as this recipe. i used the same slab of rib but cut it in half and used one with this recipe and the other with john.  Same BBQ same spices, just differnt methods of cooking the ribs. Overall I thought this recipe was muuuch better than John's baby back rib recipe. I felt like the boiling part helped the meat have that fall off the bone texture. I followed the recipe exactly and used Jack Daniels honey BBQ sauce. In the end i will be using this recipe Whenever i want to make ribs in the house=)

I used this recipe my first time making ribs. I was skeptical about it since I had only been cooking for a few months when I made it. I followed the advice of other reviewers and boiled Country Style Ribs for 45min-1hr before baking them. 

I slightly edited the recipe by adding 1TBS of onion powder to the mix as well. However, I only added a slight bit of salt because I seasoned my ribs with Nature's Own seasoning, which has a mixture that includes salt.

 I baked the ribs for another hour with a Honey BBQ sauce recipe I found a while back. 2Cups BBQ Sauce any brand, 1tsp garlic powder, 1tsp onion powder, 1/2tsp ginger, 1/2C honey, and 1tsp Worcestershire sauce. I've also used bottled Honey BBQ sauce and added all of the other ingredients to make a more tasty sauce. I've done the ribs and sauces several times now, and the sauce is good on other meats as well, and the ribs have came out tender each time, and delicious! My whole family loves them, including my kid sister who's 8yrs and picky about everything!

My husband and I loved these.  I have never been a rib fanatic but I just raided the fridge for leftovers.  I had 2 lbs of ribs which I boiled 45 minutes, and then cooked a little under an hour and they were done.  Thank you for posting such a great and easy recipe.

Better than restaurant ribs, but with a few modifications: made more of a savory broth to boil in, using water, garlic, onion, bay leaves, red chili flakes, Chinese five-spice, salt, and rice vinegar. Boiled for an hour. Then baked as above but made Scott Hibbs Amazing Whisky BBQ sauce (*THE BEST*) and added one more step. After the foil bake I uncovered them, re-basted them and baked for 30-45 mins more to caramelize them, basting every 15 mins. My dad BEGS for these! Definitely save the water after boiling the ribs to do your potatoes. FABULOUS!

This recipe deserves 10 stars (min)! I used standard pork spareribs cut into portions of 3 to 4 ribs each.  Boiled slowly for about 45 min. Then used SWEET BABY RAY'S original BBQ sauce. Baked about 45 min. then re-coated with BBQ sauce and baked another 45 min.. These ribs are the best!!!

This recipe is delicious!! I had never made ribs before, and decided to try this. Extremely easy! I used a little more BBQ sauce then it called for.  I also covered both sides of the rib before cooking.  I boiled them for about 50 minutes- 1 hour. I baked it for about 1 hour, 15 minutes. After that, I broiled for a couple minutes just to get the tops a little crisp. 

I will definitely be making these again!

I followed this recipe pretty much exactly and ended up with burnt, rock hard ribs.  Very disappointing.

Love this recipe, I have made it about 5 times and it is really fool proof.  I boil them for about 45 minutes, then bake for an hour covered in most of the BBQ sauce, then add a little more BBQ sauce about 15 minutes before they're done.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I'm not a huge ribs person. I've always thought they were quite messy to eat. Sauce on the face, clothes, furniture. Yikes! But these ribs were worth every bit of it.

Excellent recipe for cooking in the oven, but I still must admit I'm in search of a recipe that tastes almost as good, if not just as good as classic bbq ribs on the que.

I've made these once and they turned out fantastic... rave reviews from all family members.. so I'm making them again tonight.  You can never make enough of these it seems, no leftovers.  I've added a little brown sugar to the bbq sauce as well.

Excellent Ribs!  I cooked the ribs, seasoned and covered with water, on low in a slow-cooker for four hours instead of on the stove.  I covered the inside of the baking dish with aluminum foil prior to putting in the cooked ribs, making it so much easier to clean up. Twenty minutes prior to removing the ribs from the oven, I basted the ribs with more sauce. Yummy!!

Very foolproof & delicious way to make ribs.
 I boiled on low for 1 hr & baked for 1 hr covered w/ foil. Baked for last 1/2 hr uncovered. Broiled for last 5 min for a "grilled" touch.
 
I put the "rub" ingredients on the ribs a few hours before boiling to enrich their flavor. I opted for just a touch of chili powder & no salt.

SO delicious, and SOOO tender!  Followed the recipe to a T and it was perfect.  My mother used to boil her ribs before grilling and they were always juicy and soft.  This is nice because grilling isn't easy for me...we share a grill with neighbors in the building out at the pool...a little inconvenient.  I love being able to re-create BBQ ribs, one of my favorite ways to eat pork, in my own kitchen!

LOVE IT!  You really can't mess this one up.  I enjoy that it is so simple yet so good.  I will usually use the country style pork ribs but have also used boneless beef ribs and just because of my personal preference, I am very generous with my BBQ sauce.

These are the best ribs I have had in a long time.  No need to wait for ribs to cook in a crockpot.  These were far more tender than a crockpot and in way less time.  I did add just a little soy sauce to the water while they boiled.  Other than that I didn't change anything.  Amazing!  Will be making these often!!

This has been my absolute favorite allrecipes meal so far. Extremely simple, yet suprisingly delicous. You will be blown away by the taste and tendernous your mouth is experiencing. The only recommendation that I have, is to make sure you have a really good BBQ sauce.

Fantastic.The last time I did ribs like these on the grill it took me 10 hours in the 90 degree heat.I vowed never again to even attempt it.I was planning to BBQ tonight and take advantage of the last few nights of decent weather before the cold closes in.I bought hot dogs and was looking for something else.I found these pork shoulder boneless for a great price and figured I would try again-but only if I could grill them tonight-not wait 24 hours for the rub and then constantly keep watch on the grill temp.Boneless, they took less time boiling and grilling.All and all about 100 mins total.THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR SHARING THIS RECIPE!

Great flavor! Next time I will need to buy at least twice as many ribs though. They shrink quite a bit in the oven. Also, I didn't boil the ribs at all. Just rolled each rib in a bowl of the seasonings and baked them at 300 degrees F for 3 hours.

This recipe was awesome, first time that I actually cooked Pork Ribs. Only problem was I didn't make enough. I finished the ones I cooked in less than 10 minutes. Family loved them and will definitely make these again!! THX!

My dad taught me to "make" the perfect bbq sauce and it works great with this recipe.  I like to use Sweet Baby Rays personally but whatever bbq sauce you like works great.   1 Bottle BBQ Sqauce 1/2- 1 Can of Bud Light 1/2 Cup Honey Thai Garlic Chile Hot Sauce  ( depending on how much bite you like!) Add everythis together in a sauce pan and simmer on low for at leat 2 hours !

These ribs were amazing!!! I made them for my fiancé and he at them all up, no leftovers! After reading some reviews about the ribs not having much flavor, I made a few changes; I used 2 tablespoons of garlic salt instead of the salt and garlic powder.  I also added an onion to the water.  I boiled the ribs for 45 min and baked them for and hour fifteen.  I flipped the ribs halfway through baking and added more bbq sauce. They came out very tender and flavorful! Will defiantly make these again!!!

Update:  Made these with boneless pork ribs and they were great.  First review:  These were the best.  I accidentally picked up beef ribs instead of pork.  That was my only disappointment and all my fault.  They were still delicious though.

Very good!  My whole family loved them!  I boiled them for 1 hour and then baked in the oven for 1 1/2 hours.  They were delicious!  I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Awesome ribs!!!  Followed recipe exactly except I added Spannish Paprika to the mixture before boiling.  I also used "Sweet Baby Ray's" for the sauce.  I will never use another recipe again for ribs!

This recipe was so easy and turned out amazing... Even the ribs at our annual ribfest weren't as good... This recipe's a keeper... Wouldn't change a thing.. However, I believe that using Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce is the best...

The only way these could get a 5 stars is if they rivaled Baton Rouge ribs and they don't...but they were pretty good. Most of the ribs turned out extemely moist...other parts were dry. I used country style ribs, boiled them for about 45 minutes and baked them for an hour and a half. Next time I'm going to try finishing them on the BBQ and see if they turn out any better...but I will definitely make them again!

This is a great way to do ribs.  It is how I do mine.  The only difference is in the boiling.  I add one chunked up onion and some whole allspice.  Also, the broth from the cooked ribs can be frozen and used for bean or pea soup.

I haven't made this particular recipe, but this is how I make mine and have for a few years.  Boiling them and then baking on a low temp, for an hour or so with all that BBQ sauce on top, covered to keep them moist - you are right on Lloyd - YUM!

Oh these were tender...almost too tender if that's possible. They were literally falling off the bone as I moved them to the baking dish. I used the Bourbon Whiskey BBQ Sauce recipe from this site instead of buying a store bought sauce. My wife loves this sauce, and she's not even a BBQ fan. She actually threw out the Stubb's BBQ sauce we had in the fridge after I made this. Next time I'll add a little chipotle powder for a little more heat and some smokey flavoring. Top notch recipe which has been added to the "family" recipe book.

I have never found a 2nd recipe for ribs that I have ever liked. I have one set way I do any kind of ribs and no other way would take it's place, BUT, these were truly yummy and I will definately make these again and again! we too only use SBR BBQ sauce, it gets no better than that! SWEET BABY RAY'S, "you'll never go out of business!"

I have to be the worlds worst cook---just ask my husband.  I made these ribs for dinner tonight and they were excellent.  My husband finally enjoyed a meal I cooked!  I followed the recipe as it was written.  Thanks for a great recipe.  This now gave me the confidence to try other recipes on this site.

Simply delicious and easy to make.  The rib meat was  extremely tender and the leftovers were easy to shred for next day BBQ sandwiches.  The given recipe amount was more than enough fer a family of seven.

This was an excellent recipe. I boiled mine in garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper and soy sauce. I tripled up on the amount of ribs and boiled them in a big stock pot about an hour. I used a mixture of D.L. Jardines Buck and berry chipotle sauce and hunts original barbecue sauce. They were outrageous, everyone loved them. They came right of the bone, so tender. I will use the recipe again and again, Thanks.

LOVE this recipe. I'd never thought about boiling the ribs in seasoned water before - I took one reviewer's suggestion and let it marinate a bit before baking. The ribs turned out incredibly moist and full of flavour. I used Sweet Baby Rays Chipolte and Brown Sugar (two separate kinds) and mixed it with some soy sauce and back for about an hour. They came out finger licking good. Just the way they should!

The ribs are O.K., but nothing replaces the taste of real slow-cooked smoked ribs.  BROTH is excellent.

Ribs were great! I boiled w/ water,stock,herbs de provence,onion,soy,garlic,pepper & worst. Let them sit for about an hour after boiling and baked another hour. The key to great flavor in the ribs is adding enough seasonings to the boiling liquid.

My husband was going to throw the ribs out because they weren't the best cut of meat but I saved them anyway. Now, I'm only halfway through cooking-boiling is done-and they are already delicious and tender!  I put more seasonings than called for, some chili powder, 1/2 c soy sauce, basil, onion & garlic powders, sage, rosemary, 2 beef boullion cubes, pretty much a little bit of everything in my cabinet! They boiled for about 2 hours and I will let them sit for a while in the broth, as someone suggested, and will put them in the oven when supper time gets closer. We love Head Country barbecue sauce, which is fantastic, and I believe can be ordered from their website if you can't find it at the grocery store. (Oklahoma has it but Texas does not. I feel bad for you all in Texas.) 

Wonderful recipe, exactly what I was hoping for. And I did it without my man's help!

These were absolutely delicious!  I scaled the recipe down to 2 lbs bone-in ribs which fed the 2 of us perfectly! :)  These were wonderful and so simple but next time I think I will use pork back ribs instead of country style....country style are more like pork chops instead of being like the ribs you get when you go out.  I had tried to make ribs once before and they weren't good but these were fantastic!!  I served with a green salad and the garlicky butternut squash recipe from this site-yum!  Thanks Lloyd!

Delicious! I took other reviewers' advice and boiled the ribs in water, soy sauce, garlic powder, and black pepper. I boiled them for about 45 minutes, took them off the heat, and let them sit in the juices for about an hour and a half. I then baked them at the recommended 325 for 1 hour. They were tender and juicy and fell off the bone. The only thing I would change is maybe using a different type of rib. The country style ribs are a little fatty. The fat separates pretty easy, but I'd rather have something with more meat and less fat. Great, easy recipe! My first time cooking ribs and they came out perfect.

Excellent!!!! Wouldn't change a thing. I only added more seasoning and onions and garlic to my pot when I boiled the ribs. Also made my bbq sauce from scratch. But great!!! Has become a household favorite.

I've never made ribs before and these were so tender they fell right off the bone. My roommate couldn't stop raving about how exceptionally good they were! 

I let the ribs marinate in the broth after boiling for about 2 hours, and doubled the barbecue sauce - you can't have too much of a good thing!

Very simple rib recipe!  I will definitely try this again.  My ribs were a little tough, but I'm not sure why.  I boiled them for about 40-45 minutes.  Next time I will either boil them for an hour and then let them marinate in the water for a while longer or cook them in the slow cooker.  Then bake them with the barbeque sauce.  I like lots of BBQ sauce, so I added extra about 5 minutes before they were to come out of the oven.

Pretty good, smelled great and easy to make.  I've never cooked ribs before.  Didn't even know how to buy ribs.  Does makes small portions.  Boyfriend and I ate all 4 portions for dinner.  Make with 2 sides or double up.

Very good.  I also added about 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup soy sauce to the water to boil the pork.  It turned out great!  Thanks for posting the recipe.  I used Cattlemen's Honey BBQ sauce and it was tasty!
Will make again.

Easy and delicious!  What more is there to say?  My family can be picky with the meats we eat.  My daughter will not eat anything besides chicken so I mixed the meats.  I boiled the chicken for about 15 minutes and left the ribs to cook for 45 minutes.  Followed the baking directions but only cooked chicken for 30 minutes and left the ribs to cook for one full hour.  At the end of the hour, added the chicken back in and let it cook for about 10 minutes until it warmed back up.  Served with rice.  Everyone loved it!

Tasty and easy. I boiled them for about 45 min and then just kept them in the pot most of the day. Then I assembled everything in the pan and let the ribs marinate a little while, an hour maybe. Then put them in the oven. About half way through I basted them again with bbq sauce. They just fell apart and were so tasty.

I just got married and I wanted to cook my husbands favorite for dinner.  Being the very novice cook that I am I needed a recipe.  I tried this recipe for the first time and it was WONDERFUL!  It was so easy and it tasted like I had slaved all day.  Really I never knew anything I cooked would taste that good!

these are the easiest things in the world to make! you can't go wrong. We boiled ours for a half hour, then poured pepper plant BBQ sauce over the top of them in a caserole dish and baked them for an hour and a half. They were awesome!

It has always seemed so hard to get really tender ribs before I tried this recipe.  I followed the directions precisely and was well rewarded.  The ribs were very tender and flavorful.  I especially loved how easy they were!!

I can't say anything original about this.  It's a guaranteed no-brainer.  I was a little hesitant about all that salt but it was perfect (not too salty).  Did 1 hour, covered, at a slow/medium boil and 1 hour covered in a pan on the grill set at 325 (we were cooking other stuff on it so used it as our oven).  It just fell apart, even the bones.  We didn't mind but maybe others would not cook it to that point.  We read once not to ever boil your ribs as the marinade won't be absorbed.  Maybe by following it with the baking eliminates that rule?  These were just wonderful!  Totally fell apart like we like them to.  Thanks for such an easy, easy recipe!

I simmered the ribs for 45 minutes after they boiled. Then,I ignored the 1 cup of BBQ sauce and just pour it on te ribs and spread it around.  After 30 minutes of baking, I coated them again and bake for another 30 minutes.

It's impossible to make a mistake with these.  I've uprooted my boyfriend's grandmother as his favourite rib maker!  Even my picky younger brother loves these.

These ribs were  wonderful! I boiled them for 1 hr, let them marinate in the broth, and put them in the over for 1 hr. I added more bbq sauce 20 mins. before they were done. They had a wonderful flavor and they were so tender. I never tasted bbq ribs so tender before.

I don't cook meat much, i usually leave it up to my husband.  So this was a first for me.  Very simple recipe, easy to do and it turns out great.  I added onion, and extra bbq sauce before the ribs were finished baking.  Turned out perfect, husband loved it. I'm making it for my in-laws soon.

Turned out great.. Followed what many others suggested, but I made twice as many ribs, so I doubled everything.  Boiled for 45mins to an hour, the cooked in the oven for an hour, recoating with sauce a couple times.  I also put it under the broiler for a few minutes.  Great stuff!

A five star rating from my family.  My husband said "That's a keeper".  Coming from my husband thats big, because I've never been known for my cooking.  The only thing I did do different from the recipe was I first seasoned the meat with the spices and then browned it in the pot with a little cooking oil before covering with water to boil.  Thanks "all recipe" for making me look good in the kitchen!

I am a huge fan of simple recipes, and this is just about as simple as it gets. I am so thrilled that I am capible of making ribs! I was almost worried when a boiling time was not specified, but I ended up boiling for 1/2 hr and then baking for an additional 1.5. They turned out beautifully!! Not totally off the bone, but didn't take much coaxing either. Wonderful!

This is the only recipe for BBQ ribs I use,regardless of whether they are country style or regular spareribs.I boil for an hour and bake for an hour.Sometimes I throw them on the grill for a few minutes afterwards to give them that smokey flavor.Make sure you use a thick sauce."Sweet Baby Ray's" or "K.C Masterpiece" works wonderfully.

DO NOT use this recipe if you enjoying gnawing meat off of the bone!  The meat fell right off and was extrememely tender and moist.  After boiling for 1.5 hrs, I covered them in bbq sauce (homemade) wrapped them in foil and baked for 1.5 hrs.  I unwrapped the foil during the last 10 minutes to bake the sauce onto them a little more.  My 5 yr old was a little upset that she wasn't able to eat them off of the bone....the fun of ribs!  Cleanup was a breeze because of the foil.  Will make again!

My grandmother has always made this recipe, but she adds carrots and potatoes when she bakes it with about 1 and 1/2 cups to 2 cups of the broth from boiling the ribs with almost a whole bottle of KC Masterpiece BBQ Sauce and some brown sugar spinkled on the top right before baking and it always turns out great!

I have made this recipe several times.  It turned out fabulous each time.  I recommend a very thick sauce, such as Masterpiece.   This recipe doubles very well.   I shred leftovers and serve on buns the next day.

Boiling the ribs really do make them tender, but I found my ribs lost some of the flavor in the cooking.
Next time I may to rub them in something before I cook them - but the reviews are right, beautiful tender, falling off the bone meat are results to expect.
I used KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce, but found it was a bit sweet, I made up my own mix, with some BBQ sauce, yellow mustard, ketchup, garlic powder, garlic salt and pepper, and some left over cooking juice.  As it cooked, it got nice and thick, lovely tangy flavor.
Good recipe

OH MY GOSH!  This is fabulous.  I followed the recipe *except* I baked it at 250 for about 4 hours.  First time in my life I've had rib meat falling off the bones.  And DELICIOUS!  Thank you!!

well, I changed a few things like I used a pork loin instead of ribs.  I used a McCormics grilled pork rib rub on my pork loin and put it in the crockpot overnight with the ingredients called for in this recipe.  It was very easy, the meat was so tender it fell apart the next morning, I added the bbq sauce (KC Masterpiece) and it was devoured by my family.  EASY, EASY, EASY!  and it tastes great too.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe, I'll be doing this again.

I give this recipe 3 stars for two reasons: one, I modified the original recipe, so it's not entirely fair to judge; and two, this recipe is more about the preparation rather than the flavor, i.e., it's not a BBQ sauce recipe. That said, I just prepared these, using not country style, but baby back ribs; and I charcoal grilled them outside, rather than baking them in the oven. I used Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ sauce, which was excellent. I parboiled these for two hours, then put them on the prepared grill for 40 minutes. The meat didn't fall off the bone as it did for some reviewers (maybe because mine weren't country style?), but these ribs were good just the same. I will do this again, and definitely try the method the originator suggests (plus, use country style ribs). I'm sure it will be just as good. But really, I'd have preferred an orginal sauce recipe; I'm still looking for the one my mother made with chili sauce before popping the ribs in the oven for 90 minutes. Those were spectacular.

Yummy! So much easier than trying to grill ribs and losing the sauce and burning them!! Searing the ribs in some oil locks in their flavor better than boiling them. You can then place them in the oven a little longer and on lower heat, or the crockpot on low for several hours. I like to add a little onion too, and used Hunt's Original BBQ sauce. Throw some potatoes in to bake along with them, or serve with potato salad and coleslaw for a deelicious hearty meal! Thanks Lloyd!

This is the first time I have ever made ribs, bought the wrong ones. I bought beef instead of pork. I figured I would try this recipe anyway. They turned out delicious!!! xtra BBQ sauce is a great suggestion!

I thought these ribs had a wonderful flavor! They fell right off the bone. I just loved them. My husband prefers a more crispy rib so I tried sticking them under the broiler for a bit but did not come out as good as they would on the grill.

This is my first time making ribs at home.  These came out wonderful.  They are the best that I have ever had.  My husband and I absolutely loved them.  We will definitely make them again and again and again!  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

What a great recipe for those of us too busy and tired to cook!  Being from Texas, I was a little skeptical but these ribs were better than any others we have had at Tony Ramas or other rib restaurants.  I used more sauce than I thought but the results were worth it...they were tender, juicy and fell apart easily.  Messy to eat but no complaints in our family.:-)

This recipe is too good to be true. We had them today with french fries and 
these ribs were the best we ever had. They made us feel like being back in
the states again even if we are here in rainy Germany. Thanks again Lloyd

I thought this recipe was very easy and tasted great.  The only uncertainty I had was knowing when the meat was considered tender - but that's because I am inexperienced with pork.  This is a recipe that I will make again.

These ribs turned out AMAZING! Family loved! I wasn't sure how long to boil. This dosnt say. So I had two meaty full slabs. About 7 lbs total. I cut them into 4 half racks. I placed them in the boiling water with garlic powder, pepper.and salt for about 45-50 min. Then I used a big deep foil roasting pan and put the 4 half slabs in there and coated with lots of BBQ sauce. Tightly covered with foil and cooked on 350 degrees for about 1.5-2 hours. I had much more meat than this recipe so increased temperature and time a little. Then took off foil and put more sauce on and broiled it for about 5-6 min to get a little crisp on top. They were just so so tender. Fell off the bone and so easy....

This is the best way to make BBQ ribs at home if you don’t have a grill. I added extra seasonings after boiling it , before putting it in the oven (cumin, paprika, adobo, more garlic powder, chili powder, and brown sugar). I also added bbq sauce. The finale was adding more bbq sauce and broiling it for 10 min. Got a nice crispy coat, while the inside remained juicy.

I boiled the ribs, and added one onion quartered, some garlic, some garlic powder, some salt pepper and a little apple cider vinegar. 
It was my first time boiling ribs, I was a bit afraid .  I then took them out and put them in the oven 325 degrees, with bbq sauce on it (jar) and covered them for about an hour. took off the cover for 25 minutes. They are so tender and flavorful. I will make it again. When I have more time, I will make my own bbq sauce.

This recipe is AWESOME! I boiled mine just as others did, about 45 min - hour. I add a TON of spices though-- a little old bay, tons of pepper/salt (grinder), garlic powder, cayenne, dried onion flakes, and Adobo. So, so soft/tender after baking. I took the extremely seasoned water after boiling and poured some into my green beans I had simmering with some fresh chopped bacon, OH MY GOOOOOOOODNNNNEEESSSSSS.

Loved it! Followed the recipe exactly and it was fantastic. Boiled for 1 hour; then foil covered and baked for 1 hour, brushed on more bbq sauce and baked uncovered for 20 minutes to finish. Very easy to make and it was tender and flavorful. Everyone said it was really good.

These were incredible! 
We made boiled them in a lobster pot, with an onion, beef bouillion, garlic, S&P.  Turned off heat after 30 mins, and let them sit for 45 mins. Grilled for 5 mins/side, then added sauce, & grilled for 40 mins.  SOOOOO good! And tender.
And for those, like my husband, who are worried that boiling them will remove the flavour, there was no lack of flavour here!

The ribs had great flavor and were very tender.  I boiled for 1 hour and befor I put them in the oven, I really coated the ribs with sauce. I put heavy duty aluminum foil in the bottom of the pan, sprayed the foil with PAM, poured in some sauce, then laid in the ribs. I tightly covered the pan with foil.  Very good!

Boiling clearly took away something from the ribs, and weren't any more tender than just using my smoker. Bad idea.

i used to boil ribs, but no more, you lose to much flavor by 
 with some boiling them.  What I do now is to put a rub on them, wrap them in foil, and then put them on the grill for about 30 min., turning them after 15 min.  Let them cool slightly, so you can handle them, and grill them with some BBQ sauce.

Like other users I was always too intimidated to attempt ribs, but decided to give it a try with this recipe. I followed the recipe to a T and absolutely love it, the ribs come out super flavorful and tender. I've also used the leftover water for boiling mashed potatoes and they are soak up the seasonings perfectly, no need to add any extra spices. I now make them every 2-3 weeks and my fiancé adores it as well! Thankyou for the awesome recipe !

This sounds more like a recipe for pork soup than it does for BBQ. Boiled ribs? Who does that? But even for a pork soup recipe, it sounds pretty bland.

I did this exactly as the recipe called! I boiled the meat for one hour and baked them with the bbq sauce I had in the fridge. Let me say this is my boyfriend's favorite dish so far! :) The meat falls apart and is super delicious!

I am giving this 5 stars because the recipe was great. I just needed to boil the ribs a little long. Other wise I heard great comments from my family.

Very easy. I did cut down on the salt. 2 tablespoons seemed excessive. It turned out fine. You can always add more salt if you want. I used Sweet Baby Rays Honey Barbecue Sauce. It was very tender and delicious. I will be making this again.

Incredibly easy and delicious. Currently making for the second time which is why I am writing this. The first time was made 1 hr boil and a 1:20 bake time, and they came out a little dry although still pleasant. This round I am going for a 45 min boiling time and 1 hour in the oven in a thin layer of the boiled water to keep moist.

The only change I made was adding onions and soy sauce to the water, as recommended by a few other reviewers. It turned out great! Everyone loved it! If I have a little more time the next time i make it, I'll throw them on the grill for a few mins.

Definitely will make this again. I used country style boneless ribs (as that's what we had in the freezer). Only reason I did not rate this 5 stars was because I cooked them a little too long and they were a bit dry. Should have checked them about 15 minutes earlier.

I had to double the recipe and use two pots and two baking sheets because we had 5 pounds of ribs.  I boiled them for a hour and baked them for an hour and they were perfect!  Moist, flavorful and fall off the bone tender but still (barely) firm enough to pick up a rib and eat it with your hands, which is the best part of rib eating.

So easy and fool proof! I boil the ribs 45 min then bake for another 1.5 hrs as stated. I've made with boneless and bone in and comes out great every time. I love how little I have to do and my husband is always so happy to see ribs on the menu!

I made this with country style ribs on the bone. I boiled them for 45 minutes with the seasonings, then baked for an hour with another reviewer's BBQ sauce (5 tbs ketchup, 5 tbs brown sugar, 2 tbs vinegar, 1 tbs lemon juice, 2 Worcestershire sauce, 1 teaspoon: salt, dry mustard powder and chili powder). They were tender and flavorful. This would be an easy recipe for freezer cooking, or really any day you are working at home.

Wow!  What a great way to make delicious ribs during the winter when its too cold to use the grill.   I couldn't believe it...in my house of men (two sons and dh), I got three thumbs up!  My pickiest eater said, "its good!"  I nearly fell over.  I did take a few of the suggestions from other reviewers - I put an inch of part water,/part beef stock in the baking dish. I think this helped keep the ribs moist.   After baking I added another layer of BBQ sauce on top and finished them under the broiler.  I really couldn't believe how easy and delicious these were.   Just use whatever BBQ sauce you like and they will be perfect.  I'm sure I will make them this way during warmer months and then just finish on the grill.   These really are simple - even the non-cook can make these and impress your guests.  I served with coleslaw and dinner was done!

perfect ribs meat falls off the bone, i baked the ribs without the sauce just added a little left over water from my pot so they wouldn't dry out.  I drained the water and added the bbq sauce right before i broiled them , the recipe and they turned out great, for easy clean up i lined my baking dish with foil and also used foil to cover it while baking

Have made ribs this way a dozen times now and they are always called " Best ribs ever!"...I do add an onion and a bay leaf or two to the water along with the soy sauce, worcestershire and adobe seasoning recommendations, also bake them covered for an hour before uncovering them for 3-4 minutes under the broiler..Amazing recipe!

Delicious!  Used boneless country ribs. Boiled in water with seasonings for 40 minutes. Put in disposable 13x9 pan. Used Montgomery Inn bbq sauce (cause I'm a Cincinnati girl). Cooked in oven for 1 hour.  Simple recipe, every bite eaten by the family and simple clean up!

Delish!!!!  I also add a few bay leaves, liquid smoke and garlic to the water as it boils.  I always 'doctor up' my Sweet Baby Rays bbq sauce by adding molasses, more garlic, honey, a lil' brown sugar, pancake syrup, and a dash of hot sauce!  These ribs are delish (we are eating them now as I leave this review!), remember to finish them off under the broil setting to get that 'grilled' taste and appearance.  Wish I had taken a pic before we dove in ... just wasn't enough time!  =)

I've tried it once already and they came out pretty good, easy to make just add plenty of sauce when putting the ribs in the oven, I've added half an onion and 4 clovers of garlic to add more flavor. Good luck to you all. :)

Awesome!  But look, I did make mine a little bit differently.  I added a little bit of lemon vinegar to the water(I didn't have apple cider, apple vinegar... nothin like that).  And after a cooked 'em, I used the airfryer to sort of grill them, and caramelize the bbq sauce.  Not dry at all!  I cooked them in water until it was almost tender, with a little room to cook with the bbq sauce.

Best ribs I've ever made! I boiled for 45 minutes and added more sauce and they were even better re-heated!

I've made this recipe using both beef and pork ribs (about 5 Lbs for my family), and it's perfect every time. I use 2 bottles of Kraft Honey BBQ sauce, 3 cans beef broth, 2 onions (quartered), 1/2 cup worcestershire sauce, and cover the ribs with water to boil for an hour. Then let them sit for at least 2 hours (4 is better!), before moving to the roasting rack. Make sure to put on some additional bbq sauce before covering with foil, and baking on 325 for 1 1/2 hours. They are sooo tender and juicy!

Just made these ribs according to directions, but didn't really keep track of the time they boiled - I just let them get tender, then baked them according to recipe. They were delicious and falling-apart tender. I used a hot barbecue sauce with some on the side for additional dipping. I'll be making this again!

I have never made ribs before...was too scared but I found this recipe and tried it last night. I followed the recipe exactly but I didn't have bottled bbq sauce so made my own. I also took another reviewers tip and removed foil and placed under broiler for a few minutes so the meat and sauce could caramelize a bit. My husband and I loved this and we will surely make again for guests! 

Side suggestion: I boiled some small red potatoes in the stock from boiling ribs. They came out excellent!

This was so good!  I boiled the ribs with some fresh herbs (parsley, basil, and cilantro) and used a fat/sugar free barbeque sauce, I am not sure I can mention a brand name here so I won't.  These were the best country style ribs I ever had,

I'm really terrible in the kitchen, so when choosing recipes I pretty much need it to be a sure thing. That means easy to make and my boyfriend is guaranteed to like it. This recipe fits the bill. The ribs turn out so good, it's as if you've been making this dish for years.  Has a home cooking , made with TLC kind of feel and flavor.

At the advice of my grocery butcher, I used baby back ribs instead. Took the advice of other reviews by adding celery, onion, fresh ground garlic, Worcestershire sauce during the boil.. Skipped the baking and went straight into a baste and broil.   Used sweet baby ray BBQ sauce . Used a throw away foil pan for my preferred two-second clean up. A definite keeper!

My very first time making ribs in ANY form. I used some of this recipe for dinner last night for dinner. 
I changed it up a little bit though:
-added a whole bottle of barbecue sauce 
-added Barbecue spice and Italian seasoning (to desired taste)
-added two tablespoons of white vinegar
-chopped one small onion
-added two cups of water to a slow cooker & cooked in a slow cooker for six hours
They were VERY tender. The family loved it.

These are so good, I joined All Recipes just to give them five stars. I have made these many times and they always turn out perfect. I only boil for about 30 minutes, then a little over an hour in the oven. You can also use pork center cut loin filets.

So I made these for the Super Bowl and let me tell you it was a hit! My bro in law said they were the best ribs he ever had. Now I did do it a tad bit different. I boiled them for 1 hour in Dr. Pepper, then cooked them in the oven for 1 hour the night before. Then refrigerated them. The day of I threw them in my smoker (Applewood) for an hour and slapped sweet baby rays on them. Also, its hard to find but if you can get your hands on some Famous Daves apricot burbon bbq sauce they are even better. Fell right off the bone. Let me tell you these were an awesome comfort while I watched the Broncos get there a@#es handed to them. Peyton could probably use a rack of them right now.

Made these the other night.  They were absolutely delicious!!!  My husband thought so too!  When I make a recipe I find I typically make it for the first time as written.  This time I must admit that I did a minor change.  Being an avid onion lover, I sliced thin onions and added them to the top of the pork before putting the BBQ sauce on top.  While it was a super great addition in my opinion, I unfortunately did not add enough onions for the leftovers the next day!!  :-)  This recipe is definitely saved to my Allrecipes Recipe Box!!!

I am making these again! They are excellent. I always use the country style ribs and ALWAYS make a double batch. The second batch gets frozen in a disposable pan for either another meal or a ready made camping meal. I don't add the Bar-B-Que sauce until thawed and ready to bake.

I do always add a cut-up onion, garlic cloves, 1/2 cup each of soy and Worcestershire sauces, bay leaves and, since I grow my own herbs, I add several sprigs of thyme, rosemary, sage and oregano. I also season the ribs with some Montreal Steak Seasoning.

Very good! Guests always love them and they are not difficult to make.

Very good recipe! Hubby loves it! :D 

I don't want the rib to be too soft, falling off the bone. So I boiled the rib in the pot for 45 mins. Then cooked in the oven for 60 mins. I basted the ribs every 20 mins. 

The last 20 mins cooking the ribs with foil removed. Then added 7 mins broiling the ribs with 400F. 

VERY YUMMY!

You have to be using COUNTRY STYLE ribs for this recipe - just a note. I think some people are using back ribs, which require more slow cooking time. This is a great basic recipe; you can add to it what you like, and it will come out great! Love it!

Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect! The recipe didn't specify the exact amount of time to boil, so I boiled mine for one hour and then let them sit in the liquid until I was ready to bake them (about another hour). I strained the liquid and boiled potatoes in it. WOW, best flavored mashed potatoes ever!

I followed the recipe exactly and we liked !  I broiled at the very end to get the crispy coating.  I give it a 4 only because they would be even better on the grill.  But great for when you cannot grill out.

YUM!  Country Style Pork Ribs were on sale so I picked some up to try.  I have never made any type of ribs , I picked this recipe because it is very straight forward.  This was made exactly how the recipe stated and  I was very happy with how these turned out!!!  I will definitely make this again only doubling it because there were not a lot of left overs- the ribs shrink up quite a bit with cooking.   I followed another reviewer suggestion of boiling potatoes in the rib broth-  It made my mashed potatoes a little too salty for my taste.  I think half of the broth with some water added to it would be perfect!   Great recipe to add to my binder!!!!!!  Thanks!

I made this for the first time today.  Since I had  7 1/2 lbs of country style spare ribs I doubled everything.  I boiled the ribs for about 30 minutes.  They were already so tender that some of them separated transferring them to the baking dish.  I used an entire 17 oz. jar of sauce and baked them covered for 60 minutes.  They were moist and fall apart tender.  Everyone really enjoyed them!  I do have a lot of left overs to enjoy over the next several days!

I followed it exactly as written but with beef ribs (I don't like pork), and my entire family loved it!  

Beef Broth:  When I was done boiling the ribs, I let the water cool down, then I froze it in five or six small snack bags which I eventually used as beef broth.  It's real salty like the one in the stores, so you have to balance it out with water.  I used one or two bags per Vegetable Beef Soups which I make with vegetable and ground meat.  It gives the soup an amazing taste and it's very easy to wash the fat off the beef before using, just cut the frozen bag open and hold it under running water for a couple of seconds.

I have made these twice...once as written and then once with my own additions.  Both times they turned out very well and I would give them 5 stars each time (or more if I could).  The second time I added my own touches. I used onion powder, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and Old Bay in the boiling liquid and boiled for 1 hour.  Before baking, I added a little diet root beer to the pan before covering with aluminum foil.  Baked for one hour and during the last 10 minutes, I added more barbecue sauce and then broiled.  Both times, friends were asking for more.

We used pork spareribs and this was simple and delicious.  Next time after cooking in the oven I may throw them on the grill for a smokey finish.

This recipe produced the best ribs I have ever tasted!  I like some other reviewers tips on making step one ahead and then storing in zip lock bags with the sauce for later (camping, traveling to friends, etc.)  This is a keeper.  I will experiment with spices, but will always use this method.  Thank you!

We gave this to a friend and she said the ribs were cooked to PERFECTION.  Tender, juicy, and ready to fall off the bone.  I boiled almost 4 lbs. of ribs for 45-60 min. and then put them in the oven @325 for 90 min.  I put more sauce on after about an hour in the oven.  Can't wait to try them myself!

They had good flavor and definitely fell off the bone, but they were too dry.  I boiled them for an hour, like some comments suggested, which was apparently too long.  Many barBQ sites say never to boil ribs, so I'll try a low & slow method next time.

This recipe is awesome and i am not a big rib fan!! I boiled the ribs in all beef broth with 1/4C soy sauce and 1/4C whoreshire sauce added 2 onions chunked and like 5 garlic cloves whole and also added some bbq sauce. Then i baked in the oven for about and hr and they were falling off the bone so so good will make again!

I have never before made ribs but decided to give it a go after seeing this recipe.  They were absolutely FABULOUS!  I baked them for about an hour and 15 min. which was a little too long but they still turned out wonderful!!!  I will definitely be making this recipe again.

I wish I could give this recipe 10000000 stars! It was my first time making ribs and honestly, I was nervous I would waste my time and they would come out dry, tasteless, etc, etc. Well, let me tell you, they came out PERFECT. They were SO SO delicious. I literally had to start an account to write a review on these. Definitely recommend them. They are so easy to make and so tasty! I used the Weber Grill spicy bbq sauce. Excellent!! Thank you!!

This is an excellent basic methodology for cooking tender, succulent ribs. Good job Lloyd on giving only basic seasoning and cooking technique in the recipe. The truth is "different strokes for different folks" when it comes to the barbeque sauce and/or additional seasoning. So by not going there you've left your recipe open to many more "personalized interpretations."
My husband likes ribs to burn his lips and the following is how I achieve extra spiciness for him.
In the boiling water I use a couple of teaspoons of garlic and onion juice (you can purchase in the spice aisle of the grocery store) in addition to sea salt and fresh ground black pepper. As soon as I remove the ribs from the water, while they're still damp I give them a light sprinkle of cayenne pepper and use a silicone brush to gently rub it in.   Of course you could use ground chipotle if you like its smoky flavor (I hate too much smoke flavor and would never use liquid smoke like so many are recommending... only real smoke from the grill for me please.) Then I baste with a cup of my favorite bbq sauce, bake and repeat basting with another cup of sauce a few minutes before removing from grill or oven (I like Open Pit Original because there's no fake smoke in it.) 
If the ribs are looking too wet in the oven I'll turn the broiler on for a few minutes and watch carefully until caramelized.
You could add the cayenne to the bbq sauce, but I think getting it right on the meat directly makes a difference. Enjoy!

Easy easy easy!  Made just like the recipe states.  Boiled 45 minutes, let sit 30 minutes in the hot water then baked 1 hour in a foil pan to avoid the clean up mess.

Never had cooked ribs before until I found this recipe. It was so easy!!!! I was so shocked that only two hours of cooking made them so tender and juicy! My husband and I loved them and will definitely be making these for our next dinner party!!

Don't be shy with the seasonings when you boil them (35 mins for me). Let sit a few hours in the broth and bake like the recipe says - awesome!

YUMMY!  These came out so tender and flavorful!  Only difference was I put a whole bottle of bbq sauce because we are moving and I would have had to throw it away if I didn't use it.  Will do this one again!

I never made made ribs before from scratch and this recipe was so easy and delicious. It just wasn't specific enough so I had to read what others said and I am glad I listened to them. I boiled 2 lbs of ribs in a stockpot for 45 min then baked them as instructed. But after that I added a bit more sauce and broiled them for 5 min. I have never seen my bf "Hoover" meat so quickly.

Very Very good, we love our ribs done this way! The meat is so tender it just falls off the bone.  Boiling them before baking helps remove some of the fat from the meat too. Excellent recipe, thanks for posting.

Great Recipe.  I used 7 1/2 lbs of Pork Shoulder Blade Boneless Country Ribs, and they turned out Tremendous.  I just tripled the ingredients, simmered them for an hour, smothered them in BBQ Sauce covered, and baked them for an hour.  At the end, I uncovered them and then broiled them for 5 min.   While the ribs were baking, I cut up some potatoes, onions, carrots and celery, and added it to the stock from the ribs.  It turned out GREAT!  Had soup and ribs for dinner!

I've been cooking such ribs for sometime now.  Another trick you may want to try after placing it in the oven for an hour or so is to try giving it a quick blast on broil (5 min or less ) if you are looking to mirror the "grill" flavor, texture, and look.  Enjoy!

I have to agree with all of the other reviews - This recipe is one of the easiest one to cook. My ribs were nice and tender after boiling, and then I soaked them in a 1 gallon plastic bag with bbq sauce, baked them and 5 minutes "before" they were finished, I brushed more bbq sauce and they came out awesome!!

Wonderful ribs! I've been making this recipe for years. In the summer, we finish the ribs on the grill.  In the colder months, I add peeled quartered potatoes to the baking pan, coat them with extra barb-Q sauce and bake for 1.5 hours.  Growing up, my mom called them red potatoes.  YUM!

Wish they were a little more tender, but not bad for what they were.  Maybe try it with something other than country style ribs...something with less fat.

My husband loves ribs and he said these were the best he had ever tasted!  I followed the recipe exactly then placed the cooked ribs in the crock pot with some extra barbeque sauce and set it on the warm setting.  When we got home from karate class, they were tender, juicy and fabulous.  This recipe will be used again and again.  Thank you so much for sharing!

I am not a big country ribs fan and I don't usually leave reviews. This was a great and easy recipe. I boiled my ribs for about 45-50 minutes because they weren't in a rack; meaning they were already split into individual ribs. I added half an onion and for the last 15 minutes I added half a lemon unsqueezed. Splashed a litte The sauce I added before the oven was a combination of Stubbs Original and Kraft Thick & Spicy Brown Sugar. I even threw them on the grill for a little "char" after about an hour in the oven. Am recommending to my "peeps". Thanks for a great recipe!

These ribs are sooooo good. I added a medium size onion to the water and added 1/8 tsp of cayenne. Boiled ribs for an hour. Meanwhile I mixed Sweet Baby Rays Honey BBQ with a little of Sweet Baby Rays Brown Sugar, mixed in a little additional brown sugar (about 1/2 tbsp), and a nice squirt of lemon juice. Transferred the ribs and a lil of the juice from the pot to my pyrex dish. Poured bbq sauce over ribs. Sealed the dish tight with foil and baked for 1 hr at 325 degrees. Absolutely deslish. Melt in your mouth tender and flavor explosion.

I used a little over 1 lb (uncooked weight) boneless country style pork ribs. I boiled (with 1 TBS garlic powder, 1 TBS salt and 1 tsp pepper) for 30 minutes. I put them in a small baking dish at 325 for 1.5 hours with about 2 TBS Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce per rib. They are SO tender, and tasty! Delicious! I've never fixed ribs this way and love this as an alternative to slow cooking for half a day in the oven.

Excellent! Boiling the ribs before baking them? Yes, I certainly had my doubts, but you made me and a believer. At dinner tonight, when I told my family that I'd be happy to make another batch in the near future if my husband bought more ribs on his next trip to the grocery store, he told us that he'd have to think about it because doing so would mean that he would have to listen to us go on and on about how much better these ribs were than his own. So thanks for sharing!

I've made this several times now it's ALWAYS a hit! It's true that the longer you allow the ribs to soak after boiling them, the more tender and amazing they are! Better than a restaurants right out of your own oven! I'll never pay for over-priced ribs when you don't even know how good they'll be again!

This was excellent.  I did cut down on the salt a bit and added a vidalia onion to the spices.  I used an entire large bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's (I made six pounds of ribs).  It was great and served it with some shoe string fries.  YUM!!!

This was delicious, tender, and the sauce soaked up into the ribs, so they were delicious. I recommend serving this with a medium side dish.

Ok but certainly not falling-off-the-bones tender. I'll try again and cook the ribs longer, but I'll continue searching for recipes too.

Wow!  We had this for Christmas dinner this year and it was fantastic!  For a recipe so simple it is amazing how they taste like they have been worked on for hours.    After the ribs were boiled, I added some more seasoning salt, liquid smoke, pepper and sprinkled a little canola oil over the ribs and added a small layer of water to the bottom of the pan before putting it in the oven.  1 hour in the oven worked perfect for me.  Also, I let the ribs boil for about an hour before baking.

I dunno how it happened but I completely forgot to save this recipe to my recipe box. I nearly panicked! But YAY :) all is well. These were delicious and simple. Tastes great with hot buttered rice- dunno why-just does! Hubby loved them first time around and will be even happier this time because I'm making enough for leftovers. Used sweet Baby Rays bbq sauce cause that's what we like. Yum

Yummy, we loved this recipie.   We made it with country style ribs the first time and this time I thought we had ribs but it was actually bone-in pork chops.   Rather than waste the seasoned boiling water, we decided to try it.  It was really great.  Thanks for the recipie Lloyd :)

Awesome! The only changes I made was to broil it for 5 minutes at the end to carmelize it a bit. FAB!!

So easy and delicious!  It's getting too cold here in Michigan to grill and this was a great alternative for us.  If you're looking for some of that "outdoor barbecue flavor", try adding some liquid smoke.  Thanks for the recipe, will have again!

This is my second time making this recipe and again it came out fabulous! I took the advice from other reviews and added 1/2 cup of soy sauce and generous amounts of garlic powder and onion salt to the water then boiled for about an hour before putting in the oven. This is such an easy recipe and come out great! So yummy!

Delicious, I boiled for 45min and baked them for 75min as suggested by BOONIE12. Turned out delicious. I added a little bit of teriyaki sauce to the boiling for a little flavor, cuz we don't have any soy sauce. My wife loved them, said they were better than any she'd had at restaurants. This was my first attempt at ribs.

Easy and good.  I agree with others to season the boiling water well, adding soy sauce, onion, etc.  Sweet Baby Ray's is my go-to sauce.

Just finished these up for dinner, very good.  Mine did not fall off the bone, but still tasted very good.  Doubling the recipe was the only change I made. Also used Sweet Baby Ray's Sauce - yum!

I made this with a few modifications. I boiled the ribs in chicken soup base on high without seasoning. After about an hour, I removed the ribs. I seasoned them with salt and pepper, but instead of the regular garlic powder I used a spice blend of garlic, ginger and pimento that I'd bought in the imported section of my grocery store. I used two kinds of BBQ sauce; chicken 'n rib and garlic. I let it marinated in the fridge for about two hours. I basted them with the excess sauce and tossed them into a preheated 475F oven for about half an hour. Halfway through the cooking time I removed them, flipped and basted again, and continued cooking. I did follow the tip about covering the pans with aluminum foil. They smell delicious and taste even better! I served these with creamy mashed potatoes and salad.

I also added soy sauce to the boiling water. Very easy and very tasty. Living in Memphis, I've become a BBQ snob and this recipe does a nice job at home. Much cheaper than eating out! BBQ sauces are like wine - there are hundreds and it's all a matter of personal taste. Just pick what you like.

My husband was always in charge of the ribs until I found this recipe and suprised him one night!  Before I boiled the ribs i seasoned them with chicken/Rib rub.  I put salt, pepper, and garlic powder in the water and boiled for 1 hour.  I baked the ribs for 1 1/2 hours basting periodically.  These were great, and now I'm the RibMaster in the house!

These were very easy and tasty.  I used a crock pot instead of the oven, on high for about 3 hours and they were perfect.  Even after they sat in the crock pot a litle too long afterwards they were still good.  I mixed a tablespoon of honey with the Bull's Eye BBQ sauce and it was good.

These were so easy, and really good.  Tender and flavorful.  I boiled my ribs for about 45 minutes, and baked them for about an our and 15 minutes in a blend of Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce and Jack Daniel's Bold and Spicy BBQ sauce.  This is our new cold/rainy-day ribs recipe.

I have wanted to cook ribs for years and have always been afraid too. I found this recipe and decided to try it. OUTSTANDING AND EASY!! The only thing I did different was add a large chopped onion to the water and after boiling for an hour I let them sit in the mix for a few hours before baking. My husband talked about these for days. I used Montgomery Inn bbq sauce.

This is a perfect recipe.  I forgot to season the water so I just sprinkled the ribs before putting the bbq sauce on and it still turned out sooo delish!  I liked this better than on the bbq because they were so tender.

Tried this one for the second time.  Excellent!!  Used spare ribs instead of babybacks and they were wonderful.  I did add soy sauce and worst. to the water when boiling 1/4 cup of each.  They were great!  Falling off the bone!

These turned out great. Very soft and tender. I boiled them for about 8 minutes then placed them in the oven. I didn't make any changes to the recipe. I used a sweet BBQ sauce which gave it a little extra.

Tried the recipe as is except I used spare ribs.  Boiled for 45 min and baked for 45 min. Used Sweet Baby's Ray's Honey BBQ sauce. Meat was tender and soft, wasn't falling off the bones but still very good.

I don't care for the country style ribs, I much prefer ribs with the bone-in.  The recipe was good though, I added more garlic powder and some soy sauce (1/4 cup) when I boiled the ribs (and the house smelled wonderful), then baked for 45 mins.  Thanks for the recipe, lots of room to experiment with this one.

I doubled the amounts of everything for 8 servings instead of 4. For the BBQ sauce I mixed KC's Masterpiece with Sweet Spirit Foods Hot BBQ sauce and then I added some honey and it turned out so good!

This is so easy and so good! I use Sweet Baby Rays BBQ Sauce and also rub some kosher salt, pepper and liquid smoke on the meat for extra flavor.

My husband has always been leery of trying to make ribs, but this really was super simple and tasted wonderful! We used Sweet Baby Ray sauce and it turned out great. We've already made this a few times! Thanks for the recipe!

Super easy to make. Sometimes the simplest recipes are the best! Very tasty. Mmmmmmmm. Can't go wrong. I used our favorite barbecue sauce from the bottle, Ray's honey barbecue sauce. The meat fell off the bones. The men couldn't stop going for seconds and thirds. Will make again and again. This one's a keeper.

I always read the reviews of the recipe before making it and take the advice of the writers. So I made a few changes to this recipe but I think the original recipe would be equally good so I'm giving it 5*. Here's what I did. Added to the boiling water the following: 1 cup soy sauce, 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce, 2 tsp. liquid smoke, omitted the salt b/c of the soy sauce, added 1 large onion cut up, added 2 large carrots cut up. Boiled for 45 minutes; then took off the heat and let sit, covered for 3 hours in the broth. Baked for the prescribed time (needed 1 hour 10 minutes) and they were fall-off-the-bone tender. Will be making again when this kind of ribs goes on sale.

This was my first time attempting ribs so I was super happy they came out so tender and my family loved them! I didn't boil them for the full time. I cut it short by about 30 mins. and I added 30 mins. to the bake time!

These were fantastic!!!  First time I've ever made country-style ribs & they came out perfect!  I made my own BBQ sauce instead of using store bought.  The boyfriend was in heaven & so was I!  Thanks!!!

I can't believe I made these! They were tender and flavorful. Yummy! This was the first time I made ribs, and this recipe is perfect for a beginning rib-maker like me. I pretty much eye-balled the ingredients I added into the water. I also added fresh garlic and onion and a beef bouillion cube. I added the much-reduced broth to the rib pan in  the oven. I only had to bake the ribs for an hour after boiling for 45 minutes. Maybe that's because I didn't have a whole lot of ribs. Please try these ribs!

FANTASTIC - I cannot say enough about these ribs. We used BEEF ribs, and no BBQ sauce (as we forgot to buy it). SO we just boiled in the spices, let sit, grilled for 1.5hrs the next day and they were DELICIOUS! We had friends who are GREAT rib griller's say that these were the best they'd ever had. A MUST TRY!

This is a sure thing when you have company over.  I follow reviewer suggestions and add the soy sauce and quartered onion.  I always boil the ribs for 45 mins and then bake for the hour and a half.  I have made this for friends 4 times, and always receive rave reviews as I watch people go back for more and more. The meat is so tender, you can't stop picking at it.

I hate to change things and rate but what I did different was used a couple large cloves of garlic cut in half instead of garlic powder and threw in some soy sauce as others suggested to boil.  Other than that I followed according.  I can't even put into words how good these are.  I've made several times with the the same results so they are officially fool-proof and fab.  They go great with cheesy potatoes and green beans.

I'd never made ribs before and was worried but they were great. I added a lot more bbq sauce. My seven year old loved them, too, and usually hates everything. Will use this recipe in the future. Thanks.

I haven't seen my husband so happy for awhile while eating dinner! Needless to say, these ribs were fantastic! I followed the cooking directions and they were very tender, and once they were done we put them on the grill for five minutes to give that grilled taste. We were extremely impressed and completely satisfied and I'm really looking forward to lunch leftovers tomorrow!

Tastey, but mine were a little dry which I know I can fix next time by turning them over halfway through the baking process.  Changed a couple things.  Doubled the amount of ribs (stuck with country style bone in.)  Added 3 whole cloves and the juice of half a lemon to the boiling water and substituted 1/8 cup soy sauce for the salt.  Brought to boil then simmered approx 45 minutes. Had to improvise on the bbq sauce-only had half bottle of sweet baby ray's honey chipotle, to which I added a jar of plum sauce, squeeze of ketchup, squeeze of brown mustard and couple dashes worcestershire.  Baked 1 hr 45 min..will definitely turn over next time.  Kids loved it went went for seconds.  Served with near east rice pilaf and tossed salad.

I bought Baby Back Ribs, which are already really tender so I didnt boil them, I just cooked them like twice as long as it recommended. They turned out great though! We had friends over for dinner, and they were impressed.

These are a huge hit in our house and a favorite when throwing together a casual dinner party; however, be leery of the "easy clean-up" as I seem to get sauce everywhere no matter how tightly I wrap the foil. In the end, it's well worth it. Enjoy.

Very good.  Needed to be cooked longer than stated, but may be due to my particular meat.  Husband enjoyed them very much.  Wanted to get rid of bottom of ketchup bottle, so I dumped that on with the BBQ sauce and added some onion slices out of personal preference.

This is the best recipe for barbecueing meat I've ever tasted!  I made ribs one day, then made chicken with it the next.  Nothing was left over either night!  My kids are picky and they ate like I've never seen.  This is one recipe that will become a staple in my house.  Thanks so much for it!  :)

This was excellent.  I had 4 1/2 pounds of country style ribs.  I brought to boil and simmered for 1 hour.  The last 20 mintes I added about 1/4 cup barbecue sauce.  When I took them out with tongs they were falling apart.  I then put foil in the 9x13 pan, coated the ribs with BBQ sauce and baked for 1 hour 20 minutes.  The last 20 minutes I added more BBQ sauce.  They were fall apart tender.  Keeping the leftovers for my older son to take to his apartment to share with roommates.  EXCELLENT!!!!

These are simply the BEST ribs!  I will always make them this way (boiling & then baking -- they turn out so tender and very flavorful.  My husband raved about them!  I used Trader Joes BBQ sauce and added some beef broth to the sauce to cut down on the strong flavor.  The end result was perfect!

I haved to give this recipe 5 stars even though i decided to put the ribs on the grill to finish them off and burnt them to a crisp. The meat that was edible to eat was awesome.  Will try this again and I know that it will be worthe the 5 stars.

Wow, amazing! This was only enough for two people! (As main with a side of mash potatoes)I boiled the ribs for 45 minutes and put them in the oven for an hour, this seems just the right amount of time for smaller ribs, for larger ribs though, I think I should've left it to boil for an extra 15 minutes. Still delicious nonetheless. I didn't have any garlic powder, so I used a tablespoon of garlic salt instead, and reduced the amount of salt by a tablespoon as well. Can't wait to make it again!

This is the my second time ever at making ribs, and the first time they were a disaster.  This time they turned out perfect.  This is the way I'll be making ribs from now on.  They were very, very tender, and yummy!

Tastey, etc., etc., but,a little dry...Noone else has mentioned this so it may have been something I did...still, I'd make them again-only next time with a something other than the store-bought generic BBQ sauce and I won't boil for a full hour...

This was my very first time making a ribs recipe and it turned out great!  I used the Bourbon Whisky BBQ Sauce recipe which is also on this site, and they were tender, tastey and something I will make over and over again and share with my friends!

These Ribs are great, they just fall off the bone.  Boil for hour and a half and then bake for hour and half.  I add a little extra spices before putting on the BBQ sauce.  Great meal, Thanks!

Everyone loves these fall-off-the-bone ribs.  I boil the night before then put in the crock pot with barbeque sauce to cook for the day.  The best!

These were pretty good.  Tender and falling off the bone.  A good way to cook them during the winter when the grill is covered with snow.

Great ribs.  I have not eaten ribs in about 20 years, but I made them for my boyfriend.  I absolutely loved them as did he.  We will definitely be making these again.

My fiance first said, "These smell really good." Then he took a bite and said, "Yum, these are delicious." Then, he took another bite and said, "These are MORE than delicious...they're kick a**!"  Needless to say they were a hit, and I will make these over and over again, especially when the weather doesn't permit grilling them outside.  I used mesquite bbq sauce and added chili sauce as well as cayenne pepper to it.  Delicious!  And SO EASY!  Who knew?

The ribs aren't the only thing great about this recipe.  The broth was so flavorful.  I saved it and used it as liquid for a roast pork.  I took the seasoning cue from the ribs and used garlic and pepper on the roast as well and cooked it forever.  My first pork roast that turned out.  But anyway the ribs...they were tender and extremely flavorful.  I almost hated putting on the sauce, the flavor was so good.  Thanks for the recipe.

Great Recipe.  Easy and tasty.  I did the ribs on the BBQ after boiling them along with basting them with lots of KC Masterpiece BBQ Sauce.  They were delicious.  Will definitely use this again and once winter comes, I'll try it in the oven too.

These were great.  I used garlic salt instead of garlic powder and salt.  I also added more bbq sauce towards the middle of cooking time.  Very tender and absolutely delicious :)

Made these for my father-in-law and they were great. I used fresh, crushed garlic to rub the meat instead of garlic powder. The end result pulled just like pulled pork is supposed to.

This was also my first time to cook ribs at home.
I was in a hurry so I just cut up the meat to smaller pieces and boiled 30min. and baked 1hr in the oven. Can't get over how tender it got!!!!
Thanks! :-)

THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME I MADE RIBS.  WHEN I TOOK THEM OUT OF THE OVEN ALL THE BBQ SAUCE WAS IN THE BOTTOM OF THE PAN.  ALTHOUGH I HAD TO ADD MORE SAUCE AFTER THEY WERE DONE THEY DID HAVE A GOOD FLAVOR AND WERE VERY TENDER.

Best, easiest, moistest ever. Perfect as it is. After preparing it several times, this is what I do:   1- cut into pieces of 2-3 ribs each. 2- dry rub with bbq seasoning of choice. 3- boil for 45 minutes. (If I’m not ready to bake yet, I let them sit in the water until I’m ready. I feel like the times I’ve had to let them sit for an hour or more made them come out super good). 4- transfer to baking sheet in foil pocket(s) covered in favorite BBQ sauce. 5- bake fo 45 minutes. Done. And perfect!!!!

Delicious!!  Per some reviews I added soy and a quartered onion to the water, boiled for 1 hour, and let sit in the broth for another hour.  Added sauce and baked for 1 hour, removed foil cover, added more sauce and left under the broiler for 10 minutes.  Brushed again with light sauce.  Keeper recipe.

This was first time making ribs that wasn’t  in a slow cooker. I followed the instructions and some reader suggestions by adding sauce right before I removed from oven and I was blown away. The ribs were so flavorful and delicious! This was so easy to do and they turned out fantastic! Will make this from now on!

I made these and they are amazon.  Only thing I have to say was my next time making it  I'm using a tablespoon of salt. I don't know if it was the amount of pork ribs I had but it was a little too salty for me.  I also used boneless ribs. but i will be making this agian. the ribs are so tender.

These are the only ribs I make now. I’ve made them for a few years and they’re always a hit. I season them with just about anything and everything. (Garlic powder, onion powder, bbq rub, season-all, dehydrated peppers, dehydrated onions, etc) What ever you want. Cover them with water and I boil them for about 45 minutes, remove from water, place in pan, add bbq sauce (I drown them in it , plus add a little of the boiled water as well), and I bake them for 1-1/2 hours and they come out perfectly tender and falling apart.

These were pretty good, a bit tough though.  I broiled them for a few minutes at the end to get the sauce sticky.  I would make them again, but I'm not sure how long to boil them.  Maybe I'd be better off just slow roasting in the oven.

The first time I made these, they were a little bland and tougher than they should be. last time I boiled them at about an hour and and baked them for about 2.5 hours. I also pulled them out somewhere in the middle and applied more bbq sauce.  Also, at the end I broiled them uncovered on the top rack for a few minutes to thicken up the  on top.

I tweaked it a bit like what others suggested, I added worcestershire sauce and soy sauce. I boiled it for an hour and in the oven for another. I went all out with the bbq sauce. Turned out so good!

OMG best ribs ever. I used baby back cause I couldn’t find those, sweet baby rays bbq sauce, and I added adobo seasoning and a sweet rib rub from Walmart. Boiled with the adobo for 45 minutes then added the bbq and seasonings and cooking in the oven for an hour and a half. Falling off the bone. Soooo good.

This was very simple and time saving way to make ribs. I left the ribs in the oven for the 1 1/2 hour time frame. They were not fall off the bone ready at that point. If I had had the time, I would have left them in the oven for a while longer.

I appreciate other people’s responses as it helps me. This was fabulous! I added a purple onion and soy sauce to the pot to boil the ribs in like someone else suggested. I boiled the ribs for an hour.
I also doubled the bbq sauce and basted them after 45 minutes. I baked them s total of 75 minutes. They almost fell off the bones they were so tender.
I also used the boiling liquid to cook potatoes, carrots and celery in but pulled out the potatoes and mashed them with butter and heavy whipping cream. 
The meal was sensational by the words of my wife. I agree.

I doubled the recipe to serve 6 but made made no additional changes.  Boiled the ribs for about 1 1/2 hours, refrigerated them until the next day and baked them with the sauce according to the recipe.  Our guests loved them!

I made this tonight and maybe I done something wrong because it was really dry and not moist at all. I boiled until tender, then cooked at 325° for 1 hour as advised. the flavour was good, just super dry.

Nice tender ribs made it for the whole family and they all loved it. Very easy to make and I will sure make it again! The only downside is that it takes two and a bit hours to make and it usually only takes around an hour and a half.

Excellent! Used bullseye sauce for oven roasting, then later added more Carolina sauce (I ran out of Bullseye)! Great combo of sweet and tangy sauces.
I had a BIG pan of ribs but just increased proportion of ingredients and followed exactly. SUPER. My husband hates ribs on bone so this boneless meaty rib recipe is PERFECT!

Thank you for this simple and delicious recipe.  Followed the updated suggestion of letting the ribs sit for an hour or so in the juice. I believe that was all the difference in the moistness and flavor, since I used the country-style ribs.  Fool-proof.

super easy!!!!   I  added 1/2 cup honey and 1/2 TBL chili powder to the BBQ sauce.   That is the only change I made to it.  My son called it sweet and sassy.

I'd give this recipe 5 stars because my ribs turned out very well, tender and tasty, but the recipe didn't say how log to  boil them in water.  I cooked them in water for about 45 minutes and then in the oven for 1 1/2 hours.  They weren't fall off the bone tender, but still tender and flavorful.  And easy fo fix!

First time I've given ribs a go and they turned out absolutely amazing! This recipe is perfect and tastes great. As with others, I boiled the ribs for an hour before the over and, once in the oven, removed the foil and topped with more sauce with about 15 minutes left.

This is my go-to for ribs now!

Tried this recipe tonight and it was really good. Boneless Country ribs were very tender. Boiled on a low boil with spices for 45 min then removed them from water, put in a baking pan with bbq sauce at the bottom, covered ribs with bbq sauce, covered pan with foil, and cooked in the oven for 1 hr at 325.

The kids and hubby loved these BBQ ribs.  So easy to make and delicious!  I didn't change anything.  Boiled the ribs for 1 hour and baked for 1 hour.   Used pork baby back ribs.  Turned out fabulous!  Will make again.

Perfect recipe for this cut of ribs, they come out tender and moist. Only change was to not add salt or pepper.  BBQ sauce has plenty of sodium and pepper gets lost in flavours.  JMO

BEST RIBS EVER!!!  So easy!  I actually used olive oil and Stubbs pork rub and let them sit in the fridge like that for a day.  Then boiled them.  After baking about an hour with the bbq sause, I turned the ribs over, put more bbq sauce on, left the tin foil off and put them back in the oven for about 15 minutes.  These are seriously the most tender, flavorful ribs I"ve ever made.  Famous Dave... eat your heart out!  :)  LOVE THIS EASY PEASY RECIPE!!!

This was, as the name implies, a simple recipe for some great ribs. I used Jack Daniels “Old No. 7” BBQ sauce and it was really good. 
The ribs boiled for 45 min and baked about 90. And I would slather them with more sauce at the 45 min mark and 15 min before pulling them out. I’ll be using this recipe a lot in the near future.

Way too dry. Once the ribs are boiled, they are ready too eat. To bake them in the oven for hours dries them out. I would never bake chicken breasts or ribs more than a hour. You only need to caramelize the bbc sauce briefly in a low heat broiler.

Fantastic recipe!  Simple and the timing was dead on!  One addition: I glazed and broiled the ribs 3 times to get a thicker, sticky BBQ coating.  Divine!

For those who complain that the ribs come out dry and tough then you’re not boiling the ribs long enough!!!! It’s not the recipes fault, it’s yours. Boil the ribs for at least an hour and remember to remove the white membrane off the underside of the ribs ALWAYS! It’s common meat handling sense people, do some research. Anywho the ribs came out perfect, I don’t normally do them in the oven but it snowed 10cm last night so BBQ was out of the question. Also I use pickling spice instead of garlic, salt and pepper for flavour when boiling, turns out waaay more flavourful! Good luck.

After boiling for about 1 1/2 hours they were very tender! I shouldn't have followed the rest of the recipe by baking. The recipe said to pour on bbq sauce & bake in 325 degree oven for 1-1 1/2 hours. I checked on them about 45 minutes later & the sauce had blackened into a thick, tarry mess! The ribs were as dry and tough like I had never seen ribs before. Next time I will boil them like before (they were fall-apart tender at that point) & then put bbq sauce on & place in oven for about 10 minutes.

I will NEVER EVER boil ribs again, no need to and it takes out some, if not most, of the flavor. Dry rub the night before, keep in fridge til 2 hrs before you want to bake them. Bake for 1 1/2-2 hrs at 300F (or lower) adding BBQ sauce 1/2 hr before removing.

I made this with some boneless pork ribs from a large warehouse store... All in all they turned out pretty good, but I did add a tablespoon of onion powder to the boil mix. Mine turned out a bit salty for my taste, so next time I will lower the salt to 1 tablespoon. 

After cutting them up, I boiled them for 1.5 hours, adding water as needed, then baked them for about 1.5 hours. My son isn't a fan of BBQ sauce so I covered about 2/3 of them in BBQ sauce and left the other 1/3 plain, with about 20 minute left I took them out and brushed a mix of soy sauce and honey on the plain ones to give them a glaze and some flavor for him.

For the most part they turned out, but the plain ones did get a little dry even though they did get eaten. I would make this again with a few minor tweaks.

This turned out amazing! I didn’t trust that they would be tender and juicy based on the long cooking time the recipe calls for but I was wrong. After I boiled them for 40 mins, I felt they seemed pretty stiff so I anticipated a fail, I was pleasantly surprised. The most helpful tip is the giant piece of foil I used. It covered the bottom of the dish and wrapped up all around the meat and sauce, creating the perfect condition for moist slow cooking ribs.  Use more BBQ sauce though, just cover the meat and drip some over the sides. It’s better to have more than not enough.
 320 degrees for 90 mins.

I make this often for the last 45 years, and I boil the boneless country style ribs in water with two caps of liquid crab boil. The seasoning is perfect for the ribs. Then I cook them in a 350 degree oven with sliced red onions, garlic powder, and a bottle of Sweet Baby Ray’s original bbq sauce and cover with aluminum foil. They cook for 1 1/2 hours. Tender and juicy. Sometimes I put them on a hot grill for 5-10 minutes to get the grill marks on, but that step is not necessary. Perfect with corn on the cob and black beans, corn, and tomato salad.

I made these  for dinner last night...so good!! I did not do it exact..I added more seasonings to the water that I boiled them in, basically beef broth, soy sauce , garlic and whatever I had in cupboard,  plus a large onion that I cut in 8ths, after I boiled I let them sit in the liquid for a couple hours until I was ready to bake.  I slathered them in stubs and jack Daniel's bbq sauce, covered with foil, basted a couple of times while baking....omg ...so frickin good, served with chunkier mashed potatoes.  Definitely a keeper in our home.

Easy to make, and it comes out so tender! You don't need a knife at all! I can't wait to make it again, although I might finish them on the grill instead of in the oven.

Smoke them, grill them, bake them but never ever boil them.  That is nasty!   Makes them tough.  Makes them tasteless.

Very simple and very good. I used beef ribs instead, but the whole family enjoyed them.

Fantastic easy recipe! I’ve never made ribs before because I’ve been too scared. We had company coming for dinner and I bit the bullet and went for it with this recipe. Turned out great! I boiled for 1 hour and baked for 1 hour with about 7 min of broiling at the end. Perfect! Will definitely use again! Oh, and I doubled the meat. Glad I did as the ribs shrink a LOT when cooked!

Fell off the bone!  Boiled for an hour and baked for an hour and a half as directed.  I made 10 pounds of ribs and it was a little frustrating not knowing the exact measurements for the ingredients, but if you add more or less, it'll still be delicious!  I use Bulls-Eye BBQ sauce.

This lives up to the positive reviews! It was worth the two steps of boiling and then baking. I cut the long ribs into three chunks and after boiling covered with BBQ sauce and sealed in foil. For 3.4 pounds I boiled for 45 minutes and baked for 1 hour 15 min. Meat just melted off the bone!

Delicious! I’ve never made ribs before and these were easy and the best ribs I have ever had. My family loved them, too! I used boneless ribs, boiled for 45 minutes before baking, and used KC Masterpiece Original. Terrific!

Let me be honest here.  My specialty is macaroni and cheese, from the box.  I'm trying to come up with new meals that the kids will eat but every time I experiment, especially with meat, it comes out dry.  I modified this menu with some suggestions from other reviews.  It. Was. AMAZING!!  Here's what I did: I boiled the ribs for 1 hour with *seasonings (1 tsp each of: salt, ground black pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, and Adobo).  I then baked them in the oven for 1 hr, turning them over after 30 minutes and adding more BBQ sauce (I used KC Masterpiece Original - yummy).  For a side, I threw a bunch of red potatoes in the water left over and boiled them until the meat was almost done.  I mashed them in the mixer until fluffy and added milk, sour cream, melted butter, garlic salt, pepper and parsley - all to taste.  We also had corn and baked beans.   I was completely impressed with myself, which is rare.  I'm really looking forward to making this again!

This recipe is so easy and delicious!  I used a large rack of Smithfield "Extra Tender" baby back pork ribs (cut in half to fit in the pot), Sweet Baby Ray's sweet n' spicy BBQ sauce, a 1 to 1 ratio of beef broth to water for the boil and added an extra teaspoon of each of the spices (as suggested by others). Boiled the ribs in a slow boil for 1..25 hours then let them sit in the liquid for about 2 hours before cooking them in the oven.  I generously covered the ribs, top and bottom, with the BBQ sauce and cooked in oven as directed  then placed the ribs under the broiler for 4 minutes before serving.  The ribs were fall off the bone tender and delicious.  You can quickly reheat leftovers by placing them in a microwave for 30 to 60 seconds, then cover with some additional BBQ sauce and place under a broiler on high for 4 minutes.

So Easy and so delicious!  I worried about boiling the ribs first, but they turned out so tender and scrumptious.  A new family favorite!

Will definitely make again, easy.  The only I may do differently, instead just putting in a 13 x 9 pan and covering with foil, would be to wrap the ribs in foil, sealing well, to hold more juices!

easy recipe with good results.

bake ribs wrapped in foil for 90 mins (for thick or fatty cuts), then baste with bbq sauce again, and bake for another 20 minutes uncovered

I have been making ribs similar to this for years and we LOVE them!  I added celery and an onion to the cooking liquid.  Garlic would be good too.  Super tender and I can't eat ribs any other way :) :)

Flavor was great, very good recipe just make sure you have a meat thermometer handy, I over cooked mine because I didn't take mine out in time. I still give this recipe 5 stars because it was my error that made mine over cooked not the fault of the recipe.

Amazing ribs!  I followed the advice of other commenters and boiled the ribs for 45 min to an hour, baked for an hour, then baked uncovered for 10 minutes with a little extra sauce.  They were SUPER tender and amazing.

Make sure to really cover the meat in BBQ sauce, or uncovered parts will come out dry. Other than that, delicious! I boil for an hour, and bake for an hour. It's also well worth it to use the "meat water" for mashed potatoes.

This is my default ribs recipe. It is easy, fast (faster than others) and super adjustable to whatever tenderness or seasoning you want - see other reviewers' experiences.  My family is not big on bbq sauce so we subbed in dry rub instead.  Put it on before baking. The kids (including hubby) are partial to any rub with molasses.

I followed the recipe but changed the boiling time to 1 hour and as others suggested, I used a combination of 2 Sweet Baby Ray's and cooked for 1 hour turning after 30 minutes and recoating with the sauce.   Came out very tender and juicy.   Will definitely make again.

This is a great alternative to making ribs.  While the ribs weren't as flavorful, it was soft.  The taste of the spices didn't really permeate into the meat despite having it soak in the water for a few hours after boiling it.  I'd cook ribs this way again if I didn't have time to bake the ribs for several hours at a time on low heat.

I've used the leftover water from boiling the ribs to boil potatoes. I'll then mash the potatoes and serve with the ribs. The flavor is perfect!

This was way easier than I expected! After I boiled the ribs I boiled small red potatoes  to prepare potato salad the next day.   An unusual process  but made the ribs so very tender.  My husband and I really enjoyed these without having to employ the outdoor grill.

These ribs were so easy and melted in the mouth. I don't cook much anymore and decided to make dinner for my son and daughter-in-law for a change. I made them with Texas ranger beans. They were delicious. I will definitely cook them again.

Good tasting, though I'm sure that was mostly because of the BBQ sauce I chose.  Directions are vaque, particularly regarding how long to boil the ribs.  Also, in 55 minutes my pork was overdone and registered at 200 degrees!

Absolutely delicious and ridiculously easy to make.

I routinely make two racks at a time. I fill my largest pot with warm water, throw in the garlic powder, salt and pepper, bring to boil and place the racks into the pot. Because my pot isnt quite deep enough I set a timer for 45 min at which time I "flip them" so the other end is submerged in water and I boil for another 45 min. This boiling is the key for tender, truly "fall of the bone" type ribs while also giving the meat a good seasoning.

I follow up by placing each rack onto a piece of aluminum foil, I pour over my selection of BBQ sauce, wrap up the top of the foil to cover (not tightly to avoid too much sauce on the foil) and I bake at 325 for an hour and a half. The ribs come out cooked thoroughly without being dry, the sauce gets into the meat well and the meat just pulls cleanly off the bone. 

Minimum prep time, 3 hours total to cook and you will have ribs people will be begging or more of! Enjoy!

The only thing different I did was for the last 10 minutes I uncovered it  to put little glazed to make it like you put under broiler for a few minutes.  When I took them out of oven, I recovered.  They were still very moist.  Yummy!

I made as written.  While my husband SAID he liked the ribs, I found them tough and dry.  I concentrated on eating the fatty covered pieces to make it more palatable.  I won't make these again.

i have recently tried a few methods to cook ribs. One was with a can of coke in a crock pot. So I decide to try this method. I will say that this method turned out very tender and fell off the bone. It had a bit more flavor than the crock method and was even more tender..I was surprised about that. My hubby loves ribs and was pleased with these. FYI: Our sauce of choice is always Sweet Baby Ray's.

Made with different kinds of pork ribs and woks deliciously! Rub the meat with a good spice blend before boiling and add salt, pepper and garlic to the water too. Best ribs I've made yet!

Good concept. The sauce I used could have been better. Also, ribs should be cooked uncovered for a little while to brown them. When I use a better sauce and brown them it will be excellent!

I used the same seasonings, one teaspoon of each. Simmered, covered for an hour. Then placed the ribs in a foil pan, poured  a bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's sauce over them and covered  the pan  tightly with foil.  Cooked them for another hour indirectly on my gas grill. After that. I put the ribs right on the grates for about 15 minutes just to char them a bit. Omg, they were to die for! Thanks for a fantastic recipe. I would never have thought to boil them first.

I had some country style beef ribs in the freezer, and they work great with this recipe! Next time I'll try it with some boneless chicken as well.

These were good. I boiled them in water seasoned with Dales marinade, onion, celery, and garlic. I basted some in Stubbs Original BBQ sauce and the others in a more conventional, sugary BBQ sauce.  I would make this again.

Honestly, I like them better by just marinating them in barbecue sauce in a ziplock bag overnight and then I put them on a foil lined cookie sheet and bake them at 375 for 45 minutes!! They are tender and you eliminate the boiling and all that baking time!!

This is a great winter bbq idea.  We also do this in the summer (no oven).  We season the ribs and boil (covered/low flame) for an hour.  We then finish on the grill with bbq sauce.  Yum!!

Ribs were tender, delicious and so easy to cook. I put a rub on them before baking them in the oven. I brushed bbq sauce on half the ribs for those who prefer only the dry seasoning.

I'm cognitively impaired, and this is a recipe I can handle without anxiety.  Thank you!

My modifications to this recipe include:

*  I add two small onions (chopped)
*  I use 50% water and 50% chicken broth (broth goes to boiling potatoes for potato salad or mashed potatoes, afterwards)
*  Once the water boils I set the timer for 40-minutes

These were superb!  I followed recipe, cooking some in the oven.  The rest I bagged up, added BBQ sauce, and BBQd outside the next day.  They were devoured.  Thanks for sharing.

Best ribs ever!  I added beef stock to the water and some garlic powder and onion salt.  Boiled one hour, marinated them in BBQ sauce all afternoon.  Grilled for about 15 minutes, basting often.  So yummy!

No changes .  Very tender and juicy. Everyone liked it and cleaned  their plates   i will make it again, but think i would rub in the seasoning well, possibly adding some paprika, and let sit for awhile before simmering--to kick up the flavor a notch.

I have never made ribs in the oven before and these were the best I have ever eaten. I changed a couple of things, added some brown sugar and white vinegar to the boil. I also tried a dry rub instead of a sauce (could not chose so I made both). Great recipe!

I used this recipe to its exact and my ribs came out amazing. Super tender, juicy, and not a bit dry. But, word to the wise only the bone in ribs will come out this way, if using boneless they come out dryer no matter what you do. They still taste good, but not as tender as one would like. Im making these again right now as a matter of fact!

This is a very basic, simple recipe.  I bought my ribs this afternoon and ate them for supper tonight.  I followed this recipe exactly, except that I used fresh garlic and rubbed it onto the meat before boiling it.  The ribs came out of the oven soft and delicious. I don't think it's possible to make tasty ribs any quicker  than that.

I usually make my ribs in the crock pot but they aren't my husband's favorite, so I decided to try this recipe out, based upon some others' recommendations.  I did exactly what I was supposed to do, and the ribs turned out JUST as dry as they do when I cook them in the crock pot (I was using boneless, country-style ribs, which another reviewer had used and said they turned out great).  I was very disappointed, and I won't be making these again.

I've made this before and like it for an alternative to grilling when it's too cold to grill.  I just need to remember to cut the salt in half as I personally think that the ribs come out salty.  The meat is nice and tender and the sauce thickens nicely while baking.

Best Ribs! I followed others and add onion, celery, Worcestershire sauce to the water. Boiled for an hour let them marinate for 2 hours then put them in the oven. The last 20 minutes in the oven add more BBQ sauce.

Love this recipe  only things I did differently was after boiling i turned on the over and soaked them in bbq sauce while the over preheated and I used way more bbq  sauce like 3 cups worth.
They came out falling of the bone finger licking food if you know ribs that the best way lol.

This recipe worked really well for me. I boiled my 3lbs of ribs for about an hour. They came out very moist and flavorful. I always use Sweet Baby Ray's hickory and brown sugar on ribs or wings. So good!

This was a fantastic method of cooking the ribs which kept it moist and fall off the bone. I also applied a spice rub on the boiled ribs . Apply some more Bbq sauce at the end and put in oven without the foil to get a lovely glaze. Super!

Boiling them first helped tenderize them a lot make sure u use your desired seasonings then. I did do a few things different like adding honey when u add your BBQ. I only boiled them for 30 minutes. But baked about an hour and a half.

Simple and delicious! I took advice from reviews to boil the ribs for 45 mins and bake for an hour. My picky boyfriend dig right into it.. now this had become a popular lunchbox option for him. A must try!

Made it exactly as written...even the Baby Rays original. (which is sweet for me...but DH loooooooves it.) Will make again, for sure. Oh and I also used the boiling water to cook whole red potatoes and green beans...boiled them slowly while ribs were in the oven. They absorbed the spices and were delish.

Turned out perfect! fall of the bone tender.
I used fresh(3-4) garlic cloves instead of powder,  boiled for 1 hr, let cool a little(about 10 mins). Moved to baking dish, brushed bbq(sweet baby rays honey bbq) on all sides then added a little extra on the side facing up, coved and put in oven for 1 hr. added more sauce and placed back in oven for 15 mins uncovered.

I agree this recipes deserves 10 stars! I was nervous about boiling meat, but followed the directions and the suggestions from other reviewers. These were so incredibly tender and delicious that my husband repeatedly complemented them. I used boneless ribs and they came out perfectly. I highly recommend this recipe.

I've made this recipe about four times now I believe, and I absolutely love it. I also add a couple drops of liquid smoke to the boil and follow others' advice on here about adding a little more BBQ sauce appx. 20 minutes before taking it out of the oven.

I use this basic recipe, but change a few things. I preheat to 300f,  sear the ribs on all sides, add bbq sauce, and bake for 90min. Then I take it out, flip them and go an additional 30min. This yields a nice sauce for if you want to pull the pork or top the meat and/or potatoes. The initial sear adds flavor, and the lower head and longer time yields really tender meat. All this is done in a cast iron skillet. I DO NOT boil the meat. I have never been a fan of boiling for tenderness.

This was a yummy recipe, especially if you're a fan of a milder BBQ flavor. It was slightly more labor and time intensive than I'm accustomed. I cooked the ribs for 9 hours on low in the slow cooker. Then cooled the ribs to room temperature, drained, replaced the ribs in the cooker, covered with BBQ, and cooked again on low for 3 hours.

I just sorta guessed on what he meant by tender. That being said, once I got to the baking and basting, the rib bones started falling out whenever i reached under them for sauce to baste  with.

Good, but nothing indicated that the meat should've been boiled on LOW-MEDIUM for an hour. I mistakenly boiled on high and the meat was too tough to throw on the grill by the time it stopped boiling.

boiled 30min, mixed some of the broth with the BBQ sauce and baked for 45 min at 375, added sauce to the top uncovered for 15min. They were great, may need to cook a little less next time. They were a little dry.

Out-of-this-world, fall apart deliciousness.  Boiled in stock with spices for an hour then baked in foil for two.   Homemade BBQ sauce is the kicker.  Thanks for sharing!

I added some hot paprika for a bit of smoky flavor. After boiling, wrapped tightly in heavy duty foil and cooked directly on rack, so did not have to continually baste to keep meat moist.   Cannot believe how perfectly tender and delicious this came out with so little effort.

I have always parbroiled by baby back ribs, as that was how my grandmother did them.  I use crushed garlic, chopped onion, parley, sea salt and pepper and 1 or 1/2 cups of wine in the water.  simmer for about 35 or 40 minutes, let them cool and then put in a baking dish with my favorite sauce.  I used to make my own, but found a Sweet Baby Ray that tastes exactly like what I had made for years.  I bake them covered for about 2 hours at 300 degrees, I have always had a lot of comments on these.  From my grandmother down, we have never liked the hardcrust on our ribs, nor do we like a dry rub.   I was looking a receipes tonight and until I came upon this one I thought I must be the only person who had come from a family who par broiled their ribs, glad to find something similer to mine.  Also the wine can be any flavor as it really makes them tender, fall off the bone

The ribs turned out amazing. A little spicy for my kids. I would dial back a few spices next time.  The ribs were moist and almost falling off the bone. A very easy way to make ribs. My kids said they were better than dad's.

I was really skeptical at how this would turn out on pork rib tips. But, it turned out very good. I boiled them about an hour, and then baked them with Sweet Baby Ray's.

These ribs were amazing!  I cannot give it 5 stars as there were changes to the original recipe  I followed the advice of others and added an onion, soy sauce, slices of garlic and worcestershire sauce to the boiling water.   I let the meat "rest" after taking it out of the water and then again after taking it out of the oven.  I brushed the ribs with BBQ sauce (and covered the bottom of the pan) before baking.  Lastly, I put them on the grill for a few minutes each side (to get that BBQ look and extra flavor)

I did not add salt, but used Better than Bouillion beef paste as a sub and added 1/4C Worcestershire and 1/4C Sweet Baby Rays Honey Chipotle to the water. Simmered 1 hr, and when ready to eat, I brushed with more bbq sauce and put on foil on grill (HHH)for about 2 min per side. I added some chicken thighs in my water as well. Excellent!

I'd never made ribs before. This recipe was easy and delicious with the bonus of not having to constantly watch it so I could enjoy my day off while it was cooking. Meat was tender and fell off the bones.

This was good. I boiled the ribs for about 45 mins and then let them sit in the marinade until I baked them about 3 hrs later. Baking them def made them more tender. I also added soy sauce to the water but I don't think that was necessary.

OMG...best ribs ever! I did as others suggested and heavily seasoned the water and added a bit of liquid smoke as well. I boiled for 45 minutes, then let sit in water for about 2 hours, covered with Sweet Baby Ray's and baked for an hour, then put on broil for 5 minutes. I used 2 cups of the strained water and 2 cups of minute rice...added a 1/4 packet of onion soup mix and a handful of frozen peas, microwaved for 5 minutes...absolutely delicious rice...will have to try with potatoes next as others mentioned!

I make my ribs this way and my husband cooks them on the grill after boiling and adding homemade sauce to them. We served them to 35+ people at a homeless shelter last night so I put 78 boiled ribs in 2 giant foil pans, poured sauce over, covered and baked 1 hour. They were a hit. Good recipe.

This is a fantastic recipe. Simple to make and the taste is out of this world. My 18 year old grandson is a big lover of ribs and he said this was his favorite.

I read all the comments before proceeding to make this. It turns out to be really good! I baked it for 40mins, then brought it out to brush with more bbq sauce, and continue baking for another 20mins. Then i removed the foil and grill it for 8mins. It was done. The meat fell off the bones easily and the taste was really good! Really got good reviews from my family members! This will be a keeper for me! Thank you for sharing!

Very surprised at how tender these were.  Used Head Country barbeque sauce and followed directions.  Delicious as is but  I  think next time I will add a few ingredients  as others have suggested.   I  did adjust the recipe for 1 lb. of meat as  I only needed 2 servings.    Thanks for sharing.

First time making ribs and my Hubs loved them.  The only thing I had a hard time with being really new to the cooking game was how long to boil but I scrolled and and went off what some comments suggested (45 minutes). Will def make again thank you for sharing your amazing recipe!

This recipe is 99% the same as my mother-in-laws and she is hard to please.  The only thing I did differently is reduce the oven temp to 275 to bake the ribs.  I made it for Super Bowl 50 and even she gave compliments!  Thank you!!!

I will make this again, and maybe try chicken.  Delicious and easy.  Boiled the chicken after the ribs, and put it in the fridge for later in the week. Put a quartered onion in with the water.  3 kinds of BBQ sauce.

I have never left a review on any site but these ribs are amazing! I boiled them for 45 min and also added some onion powder and worcestershire sauce to the water then baked for 1 1/2 hours basting with BBQ sauce every 30 minutes. When they were done I sprinkled with brown sugar and broiled for 5 minutes. They were literally falling off the bone as we were taking them out of the pan. Amazing!

Delicious and super easy. This will be my "go-to" recipe for country style ribs and will make them on a regular basis from now on. Simmered ribs for 1.5 hours in water, 2 Tbsps Goya Adobo all-purpose seasoning, 1 Tbsp kosher salt, one stalk celery with leaves and one small yellow onion quartered. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and let ribs sit in the same cooking pot, in the broth and off the heat for over an hour while I prepared other dishes. Topped with one bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's Chipotle BBQ sauce before baking.

Great method to make country ribs in the oven. Followed the recipe except added 1 tbs of onion powder & boiled ribs for 45 minutes. I also added more bbq sauce towards the end of cooking. My family gobbled this up and said it was the best ribs ever! Meat fell off the bone, which is a plus!

I've always been so intimidated to make ribs.  Every time I've tried, I pretty much failed. 
I'm glad I found this recipe, they came out PERFECT!!! I made mine boneless and broiled it for 10 minutes at the end.  The meat was so juicy and perfect, it was falling off the fork! 
I did what the other reviewer said and made my mashed potatoes with the water that I booked the pork in. Hardly needed any butter. My husband was a very happy man!

Very good recipe!! Family loved it! I was very careful with the amount of time i boiled the ribs. Ive tried recipes with homemade bbq sauce and they were better but if your scrunched for time this is definitely a quick easy delicious meal!

This was the first time I have ever made barbecued ribs. I have always been reluctant to boil meat, but with all of the great reviews, I gave this one a try. 
I boiled the ribs for about 45 minutes. Then I cooled them for about a half hour. I used KC Barbecue but sprinkled onion salt, a few shakes of Louisiana hot sauce and some brown sugar on both sides.
THESE WERE AWESOME AND FELL OFF THE BONE!
Yay me!!! Successful rib story!

I combined this recipe's cooking method with another recipe I have and they came out beautifully. I used the ingredients exactly as listed, boiled (actually it was more like a simmer) for 90 minutes then put them 5" under the broiler for 10 minutes on each side, basting with barbecue sauce about every three minutes. They were moist on the inside and had a bit of a bbq "bark" on the outside. Thanks for posting this recipe! I've tried about a dozen recipes over the past year, almost all of them required a ton of ingredients and work. This is so far the best AND the easiest! You just can't beat that.

Delicious!  Boiled my boneless, country style ribs for about an hour then baked on 350 in foil for an hour with Famous Dave's Rich and Sassy BBQ Sauce and a about 1/2 cup of the liquid from boiling on the bottom of the baking dish...this recipe is a keeper!  I will definitely make again!

Great recipe. First time cooking ribs and they came out perfect. I dry rubbed the ribs using garlic salt and pepper. Boiled the ribs for 45 min (7lbs or 2 full racks cut in halves) in a big pot. Put them in the oven as instructed. I had to use two Pyrex 9x13 dishes to fit them. Cooked them as instructed for about an hour and 20 min. Took them out about 20 min before done and added more BBQ sauce (Famous Dave's sweet and Zesty is awesome).

Going to take the liberty of rating this five stars even though I did cook the ribs in water with one can of ale added.  That was the only change because I've done it before and loved the little bit of added flavor.  This was by far the very BEST I've made here at home.  The entire family loved them AND they were on sale at our local Stop & Shop market for $1.49 a pound...nothing is better than that.  Thank you Lloyd!

The key to these ribs is a minimum of 45 min boiling if you don't want them to be tuff.at least 1 hour cooking time. I boiled mine for 1 hour and the meat was falling off the bone.put them in oven for an hour, I also inject bbq sauce in the meat. it is so good when you do this, try it, you wont be sorry.

Very simple recipe and tasty too.  Great way to cook the Country Style Ribs - they are so large and meaty and don't come out as well when using other methods of cooking them.

These came out so good! I've never made ribs before and wasn't sure how long to boil and bake them, but I followed other reviews and boiled for 45 mins before baking for an hour. Every 20 mins I put on more bbq sauce and when the meat reached 160 degrees, I uncovered the dish, poured on more sauce and broiled for a few more minutes.

This was a very easy recipe to make!  I disagree with people who say not to boil the ribs.  It can be done and keep the taste, just don't use water.  I used a combination of Guinness and beef broth for the liquid.  I also added some garlic powder and some southwestern seasoning rub to the boil.  I cooked a bit lower temperature, 275 for 2 1/2-3 hours.  Finished them off on the grill--awesome!

very good and very tender- the method is good- it's still better boiled then grilled but the oven will do when you are unable to grill. I added beef broth to the boil, and liquid smoke-mmmmm!

This was my first time ever making ribs and wanted them to be just right. I followed the recipe almost exactly, but added meat tenderizer to the seasoning and an extra table spoon of garlic powder. They turned out great! Thank u!

I have never made ribs before and this recipe is a keeper. I will never use another recipe. So tender and delicious! I boiled for about an hour and 15 minutes then baked in oven with Bull's Eye BBQ Rib Sauce covered for 40 minutes. I then flipped them and added more sauce, then continued to bake for another 25 minutes covered. Then I  flipped them back to meat side up and backed for another 5-10 minutes uncovered. Thanks Lloyd for the awesome recipe!!

tried this twice now, on bone in country style ribs, it is great!  one hour boiling and 1 hour in the oven, then uncover and baste with bbq sauce at a higher temp for 10 minutes.  I put a touch of liquid smoke in the boiling water, along with salt pepper and garlic as in the recipe.  so easy I will be doing this again and again!

Mine came out dry as well.  I did use country style pork ribs so I'm guessing that wasn't the problem.  The ribs did fall apart very well though just too dry.  Will try again when I get a chance though.  I'm a terrible cook.

Was quick, easy and delish! I broiled them towards the end for about 8 minutes to get a nice thick sauce and some a nice crust around the edges.

Delicious, easy, tender ribs. I did what one reviewer does and added 1/2 cup soy sauce when I boiled the ribs and let them soak for three hours. I used the broth for the quinoa I made with it, and it gave it a great flavor. Love this recipe, and will make again. Thanks!

This recipe is perfect!! I made it exactly as the recipe said and they turned out amazing. The ribs were incredibly tender and moist, and the whole family loved them. I used the Montgomery Inn barbecue sauce which was really good and served them over instant mashed potatoes. Super recipe!!

Dusted with brown sugar, then a diced onion, sauced it and let it bake. Put it under the broiler for a couple minutes afterward. I will be making it this way from now on delicious!!

This was so easy to make and the ribs turned out so tender!  This is my new go-to recipe for ribs. While the ribs were boiling I added a mesquite seasoning in addition to the seasonings the recipe called for and boiled the ribs for about 45 - 50 minutes. For the BBQ sauce I used a 50/50 mixture of store bought sauces; one was Caroline type (more vinegar) and a Texas type (more sweet and spicy). I used at least a cup and baked for about 1 hr and 15 minutes covered. Then I added about another cup of sauce and baked uncovered for another 20 minutes. Perfect!!!

I boiled the ribs for 45 minutes and then I marinated them in sauce for 1 day and a half in the fridge. Baked them as directed and added extra sauce the last 20 minutes of baking. Also removed the foil the last 20 minutes. They were very tender and falling apart. I will be making these again.  Thanks for a great indoor rib recipe :-)

Love this recipe!!! I add 1 teaspoon of onion powder to the water and boil for 45 minutes. I also only use Stubbs BBQ Sauce, it is the best in my opinion.

These are some of the most tender ribs I have ever made. Followed one other reviewers advice and let them soak in the broth for a few hours before throwing them in the oven. Honestly, the ribs never even made it onto plates. They got picked right out of the casserole dish sitting on top of the oven. Will definitely cook them this way again.

Just be sure to boil the ribs until they are tender/ falling off the bone. Then oven or grill to finish them off.
Also using the seasoned water for potatoes is a must!

Made this exactly as directed (except that I let the cooked ribs soak in the water for about 4 hours). Some of the best ribs we've ever had! My husband loved them and was so thankful I found a way to make yummy ribs without smoking them all day. We will try it again and throw the ribs on the grill for the last part of the cooking.

I know other recipes say stop searching, but once you try this you can really STOP SEARCHING!!   I've tried ribs a couple times in my slow cooker, blah. These were exactly by the recipe and 2 hours later, I'd say better ribs than any rib restaurant!  They sure made an OK cook look good!!  STOP SEARCHING!!!!  SO easy, 2 steps to perfection.

These were perfect. No changes required ( except if it was summer, I would do the baking part on the grill). The ribs are tender, and perfect.

Great!  My husband had been buying the ribs and frying them in a pan; they were tough and unappealing.  This recipe is great! It takes a lot of time, but is SO easy and the results are like restaurant ribs.  I did 1 hour boiling and a little over 1 hour in the oven.  Next time I might let them soak even longer in the water.  I used boneless pork ribs and modified for 1 lb. which was enough for us.

I'm a girl with little knowledge in cooking(other than taking HS cooking class) but when I cook these ribs, I'm the head cook that day!. It's easy to make and comes out delicious. I add MORE BBQ sauce every 8-15 mins.  I highly recommend this recipe.

A great, easy way to make tasty country style ribs. I never boiled my ribs before, but it got rid of alot of the fat, and helped tenderize the ribs. They baked up nicely without any bother, and everyone enjoyed. Thank you for sharing!

Very good and tender. I followed other suggestions adding a quarter onion, soy sauce, and I also added a couple of cloves of garlic. Boiled 45 minutes baked 1 hour 15min with Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce. Easy & tasty will  definitely make again :)

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!! I used Sweet Baby Ray's honey BBQ sauce. I also diced some potatoes, added some water to the remainder of juice from ribs and boiled the potatoes until almost tender, then I drained them, placed them in a casserole dish, covered them with various cheeses and baked them in the oven during the final 20 minutes the ribs were in the oven! Cook some corn, green beans and Mac n cheese and u have a Wonderful supper!

I used boneless beef ribs, cooked exactly the same way. Tender and delicious. All my picky eaters, non meat eaters loved it. I was unsure of the boiling time, so I just did 20 min after coming to a low boil.

Made these 3 times now, boiling for 45 minutes and one time the ribs were a bit dry. I think from now on I'll boil for a full hour.

I really enjoy the tenderness of the rib meat..I went by the instructions..Didn't add anything new.. They were awesome..Still used the Jack daniels BBQ sauce that I used on the baby back ribs..Country style pork ribs were awesome..So I rate it a 5 star...

I just made this tonight.  Well when I boiled those ribs, I forgot to put garlic powder, black pepper and salt!  After I place them in baking dish, I sprinkled garlic powder on ribs.  Then pour the bbq sauce over them, and bake in 350 degree oven for 1 and half.  Turn them once and reBBQ sauce them.  They were great! My family were delighted.  Though, they didn't become glazed  as I wanted them to... so It's 4 stars.

3rd time Making this recipe. Just wonderful. I was always intimidated by ribs, but this recipe is very simple and very tasty. Thank you for sharing Lloyd. I will always make my ribs like this and pass it on to my children and to everyone who asks how I make my ribs.

These were wonderful! I used country ribs as recipe states, which makes an economical dinner (I bought mine for $1.99/lb).  Boiled probably 20 min longer because I got busy, but put them straight from the boiling water to the foil pan, added the bbq sauce and baked it only an hour because we were hungry. Uncovered half baking time to carmelize the sauce a bit, and did turn the ribs around some while cooking. Tender, moist, and delish!!

Great and easy.  I went one step further after boiling the ribs I cut off the excess outer fat and de-boned the meat. Then baked them in the BBQ sauce as directed. My youngest son seems to waste to much good meat when eating around fat or bone.  He and my husband loved them!

This is a really great simple recipe. My family loved it. I added a few things. I seasoned my meat with my usual seasonings (black pepper, seasoned salt, and garlic powder) directly on the meat. I added onions and put the meat in a pot and filled it. After I boiled them for an hour and a half, (drained them) I added Sweet Baby Ray's Barbecue Sauce and put them in the oven for another hour. It was delicious!!!

Wow...they were great. I did it a little different once it got to the oven part. I baked it for 30 minutes then re-coated with BBQ sauce and took off the foil for the remainder hour. The ribs turned out perfect and recipe was very simple. Great recipe for the first time I made BBQ ribs!!

Terrific recipe!!  Easy!!!  I used the recommended seasonings and threw in some leftover chopped onions I had in the freezer while I was boiling the ribs (for 1 hour)  I left them in the oven for a little over 2 hours because I fell asleep LOL - but they were still perfect and not dry-they just fell off the bone.  Hubby loved them and said they were the best he has had.  Thanks for this recipe!!!

AWESOME!  And SO easy.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ and added 1/2 an onion (cut into wedges) while boiling.  When I transferred the ribs to the pan, I added some of the liquid/spices to the bottom of the pan as well.  They were done in about 1 hour.  Thanks!

These ribs were excellent. Used the country style ribs with bone-in.  boiled them for 45 mintues than finished them off in the oven for 1 hr, and brushing on bbq sauce and flipping them every 15 to 20 minutes. The second time we made them we sprinkled Cookies all purpose seasoning on top of bbq sauce the last 15 mintues in the oven, FANTASTIC flavor.. We make these at least once a week and think they almost taste even better the second time as leftovers.

OUTSTANDING!  This is an extremely easy recipe that produces nice, tender ribs!  I used 1 C Catsup mixed with 1/3 C Sweet Baby Ray's  BBQ Sauce.  Perfect!  Now if this recipe only helped with dishes!  Lol!

AWESOME!!! My family and I loved these ribs and they are the easiest I've ever fixed. I boiled mine for an hour the night before and stored them in a baggie until the next evening. Worked out great with a busy work schedule.

Excellent, I didn't change a thing (and doubt I ever will!) and these were some of the best country ribs I've ever had.  Some grilled corn on the cob and slow cooked collard greens; where can you go wrong!

I'm a vegetarian but I made these for my husband who loves meat. He RAVED about how moist and delicious these were. This will be my go-to recipe from now on for ribs! I guess I'll need to start experimenting with barbecue sauces to make this "my own." :o)

These were pretty good.  We usually make ribs in the slow cooker and finish in the oven or grill them.  Mom used to boil and bake and I was short on time so decided to try this.  They were nice and tender.  This isn't my cooking method of choice but worked great!

Delicious, delicious, delicious!!  I followed the recipe pretty closely. I did add a little soy sauce, a sliced onion, and paprika to the water and boiled the ribs for about an hour.   These were absolutely fantastic! Thank you for a great recipe.

Yummy and Simple!  I bought some country style ribs and was looking for an easy recipe.  I don't cook pork very often because I'm afraid of it being too dry.   This pork turned out so tender!  I added sliced onion and black pepper to the boiling water and boiled for 45 min.   To bake, I covered half with BBQ sauce and half with Heinz 57.  Baked for 1 hour.   Both were delicious!

I did this recipe and followed exactly except that I added extra BBQ a little before I took them out. My gosh, the ribs where so soft and delicious! My husband absolutely loved these and wants me to make them again on Sat. LOL

These ribs were amazing!!! Can honestly say some of the best boiled ribs I've ever had. Added a bit of paprika to the water along with spices listed in the recipe, and a homemade bbq sauce. Fall off the bone delicious! also basted twice throughout and broiled on low for last 10 minutes. Will definatly make again.

This was so good! The only change I made was adding onion, used fresh minced garlic, and a little bit of soy sauce to the broth. I also cooked it in foil. The ribs weren't as bbq-y as we like, but that might have been the sauce we used. We will definitely make this again. It was so tender! Yummy! Thanks.

I skewed from the ingredients a bit and added about a cup of Guinness to the water, as well as 1/4 cup of soy sauce and an onion.  I got a great stock from it when the ribs were ready for the oven! ........... They are in the oven now, and I poured a bit more Guinness on them and left a vent for the alcohol fumes to burn off and out away from the meat, to reduce the bitterness that Guinness can sometimes leave.  When they are ready I'm going to add Bullseye Guinness BBQ Sauce and remove the foil for 15 minutes or so, and ENJOY! :) :)

This was the first time I made ribs at home... and they were great. My boyfriend absolutely loved them. I didn't change much other than add a quartered onion to the water when I was boiling it (not sure if it did anything for the ribs, but I later used some of the stock on my mashed potatoes and they were great!) and I basted the ribs every 30 mins or so.

OMG! Cannot praise this recipe enough. I followed the recipe to the T and used pork baby back ribs as one of the reviewers suggested. I also used Sweet Baby Ray's Honey Chipotle BBQ sauce, almost the entire bottle since I decided to brush them half-way through the baking process. They were done after 1 hr 15 mins. Simply delish and oh-so-simple. I will always make my ribs this way!!! Thank you so much for sharing :)

I was reading this recipe to see if it was the same as mine, and sure enough it almost is.  I boil the ribs in BEER or beer and water.  Sometimes I make a foil sheet with turned up sides and put in on the barbeque for a short while instead of the oven.  They truly are great!

The flavor was really good, but they didn't fall off the bones as well as I would have wanted them too - but it was my first time cooking ribs in the oven, so I'll definitely try it again!

This recipe was wonderful! I used beef ribs instead of pork and I used sweet baby rays BBQ sauce. I think I should have used pork ribs because the beef ones just didn't seem to want to fall off the bone. They did however come of quite easy using a fork so I am still giving many kudos to this recipe! Next time I will be using pork ribs and i bet you I will get the falling of the bone effect! Thanks for this good recipe

these were good, esp. in sandwiches and with the southern potato salad on this site.  but i thought they were just basic and something that couldve been easily accomplished in the crockpot.

I have always been afraid to make ribs, worried that they would be tough. This recipe made the best spare ribs ever! They were tender fall off the bone! Will keep this recipe handy and I will be making ribs more often now.

I'm giving it 4/5 stars but I do believe it was the BBQ sauce I used - not my usual. I am going to cook it again in a few nights and re-rate. Otherwise...very good recipe! I boiled the ribs for about 45 minutes and cooked them for about the same time. It was only two servings. Came out very tender and juicy. Fell right off the bone.

This recipe is AMAZING. Not only is it simple, it's delicious. I used Sweet Baby Rays Sauce. I didn't have to change anything in the recipe. But I did add a little bit more bbq sauce to some of the ribs just because I love them drenched in bbq sauce.

This is the way my mother makes ribs although she changes what she boils them in quite often. Sometimes she'll use part fruit juice to boil them in and that's really good as well. I followed this recipe and they turned out tender and delicious.

I love this recipe because it was very simple and tasty. I gave it only 4 stars because I think 2 tblspn of salt was a lot. I'll just put a litlle less next time. Other than that good recipe!

simple, good flavor, and very tender. Because I was serving just my husband and I, I used 4 meaty ribs, boiled them for 35 minutes and baked for 1hr 10min with the foil off for the last 15 minutes.

Well I made these ribs tonight for dinner and my husband must have commented at least 4 or 5 times about how wonderful and good these were. As a matter of fact, he ate all of his ribs and asked for more before he had even touched anything else on his plate. I boiled these for about an hour and put them in the oven for another 55 minutes or so. The meat was literally coming off the bone, just the way we like it. Will definitely be making these again.

I used this recipe, but modified it some. I put the ribs in a crockpot w/ a little water and smothered them with bbq sauce. I let it cook all day while I was at work...I could barely get them out of the pot they were so tender! Loved it!

The taste of the ribs were great but I can never get them to fall off the bone!  I boiled and baked for an hour.  I guess I will boil more next time, but they still tasted great anyway!

This was awesome! I had never made my own ribs before and this recipe was a great easy guildeline to start! I took the -always helpful- other reviewer's tips & boiled the ribs for an hour. I had to use what I had on hand and spiced the water w/a good amt. of steak seasoning rub (it had the spices in it - the recipe called for) & 1c of soy sauce. Then I slathered with bottled hickory smoke barbecue sauce and baked for an hour, turned half way thru, added more sauce and uncovered the last 10 min. for a nice crisp.It was falling off the bone but not too much, so it was a happy medium. Thanks! everyone! I will def. make this a favorite =)
ps. This made a fabulous beef/pork like broth after boiling, I just strained it to use at a later time for gravy, soup or au jus, just freeze!!

Fabulous!  I boiled for 45 min then cooked at 350 for one hour. Used Stubb's Mesquite sauce, and added about a tbsp of honey to make it stick to the ribs better.

This was my first attempt at making ribs.  I tried this recipe and another one that also had high review, I have to say, this was awesome!  After reviews, I added some soy sauce and worcestershire sauce in the boiling and not only my house smelled like I knew what I was doing, but it added some great flavor!

These ribs were awesome! My husband talked about for hours after eating them! I made them exactly as the recipe says and I wouldn't change a thing! These are very easy to make after working all day and taste better than the ones I cook all day in the crock pot! They even fall apart in your plate! LOVE 'EM!

These are great!!  I boiled the ribs for at least one hour and then placed on the grill because my oven is broken.  I have made these 3 times and I still have not made enough for my family of 4 because they love them.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Absolutely incredible.  I've never made ribs before and this was the easiest recipe ever.  I made some changes like others suggested: added soy sauce and 1/2 onion and a couple of garlic cloves to the water.  I also baked it for 1 1/2 hours and then put it on the grill for about 5 mins each side to warm them up.  The meat "feel off the bones" I'm told.  In fact, I didn't even get to try one b/c they were gone so fast.  I've been asked to bring them to 2 upcoming bbq's.

I did these for my father-in-law's birthday, he loves ribs, and I had NEVER made ribs in my life!  I started to wonder what I was thinking testing this out on him, but he loved it, and asked for the recipe.  I did use some soy sauce to boil them in as others suggested, boiled an hour, baked at 225 for another 1 hour 10 minutes.  They were so tender, and even better the next day as leftovers!

Made these yesterday for the 4th and they were fantastic..and so easy! It was the first time I'd ever made ribs before. Followed the advice of others and after boiling let them sit in the water for an hour or so. Used Sweet Baby Ray's sauce. Can't wait to make again! Thank you!

Yummy! I made these ribs the other night and they came out great! It was SO simple too. I took the others suggestions and added soy sauce and let it sit in the broth for a couple hours. I had 2 racks of ribs and used a whole bottle of bbq sauce. 
We had friends over that night and I usually don't like to "try out" recipes on friends first but I did and they loved them. They were all gone! We all decided to have them again the next weekend but this time we are going to throw them on the grill for a few minutes at the end.

The only reason I give this 4 instead of 5 stars is I took all the additional advice of the 1st reviewer (Boonie12). What a simple way to prepare ribs that by far turn out way better than I have ever made them! Very flavorful and extremely tender.

This recipe was fantastic.  I boiled the pork with onion (quartered) fresh minced garlic and teryiaki sauce because I didnt have any soy sauce in the house.  I boiled for one hour, then let it sit for an hour and then put it in the fridge with bbq sauce for a few hours, finally I baked for one hour, it was AMAZING! Definately a keeper, so easy!

Yummy in the tummy and oh so easy.  Some pieces wasn't so tender but that was due to my mistake and not boiling the ribs long enough.  Will def make this again.

Incredibly good.  I've served this to many friends and family members who beg for the recipe.  I rarely repeat recipes in the same month, but my family begs for this regularly!  Make sure that you're using a quality BBQ sauce--it can make or break the dish.  We love Sweet Baby Ray's, but I'm going to try a spicier sauce next time.

This was a simply wonderful recipe! I changed the over temp to 275 and let it cook for about 3 hours. The meat just fell off the bone. I will be making this again!

AWESOME!!  These were the best ribs I've ever made.  Super tender.  For the sauce, I used two thirds Kraft BBQ sauce, one third of a local favorite BBQ sauce, and about 6 tablespoons soy sauce.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

Great simple recipe. My BBQ of choice was KC Masterpiece Honey BBQ. I used pork country style ribs baked them for an hour in the oven at 350 then put them on the grill on a medium low heat. I turned and basted 4 times every 10 minutes. They turned out Excellent!! Very tender and very tasty.

First time i've ever cooked ribs and they were awesome!  So tender!  I used sweet baby rays bbq sauce and followed exact directions.  I had so many compliments you'd think i had been cooking ribs for years!  Thanks ;)

I've made these ribs twice already and we love them!  We're planning to make them again for the 4th of July... would be great thrown on the grill for a few minutes after the baking.  Tastes so good with Sticky Fingers Carolina Sweet BBQ sauce.  Also, the meat would be perfect for pulled pork sandwiches the next day (if there are any leftovers!).

We made the ribs just as instructed, and we will DEFINITELY make them again! They were so delicious, and so tender. Plus, it's such an easy recipe, but tastes like you slaved over the stove all day! I used Cattlemen's BBQ sauce this time, and it was a tad spicy for my two little ones, but great for us adults. My in-laws were raving about these ribs! We will definitely make them again!

Really enjoyed this recipe. The ribs came out extremely tender, baked them for 1-1/2 hrs. after boiling them for about a half hour. Added more seasonings to water..onion powder, Penzey spices Northwoods seasoning. Very Simple....will keep this one in my cooks file!

This is the only recipe I use for country style pork ribs.  The recipe works whether you have 2 pounds or 5 pounds.  I always use approx 1 bottle of sauce.  We like our ribs saucy.  Always tender and tasty!

My husband and almost-two-year old loved these ribs. There was absolutely nothing left on the bones when they got through with them! I boiled the ribs for an hour and a half and basted them every so often while in the oven.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

Excellent recipe!  I am not a cook and usually the kids just say 'okay' to most anything I cook for them.  with this recipe not only I could follow the instructions easily but the kids loved it!  The ribs (7 lbs) were gone in a couple of days amongst my 4 kids.

I made ribs for supper using this recipe and they turned out excellent.  Very tender.  The meat almost fell off of the bone.  I boiled them for about half an hour, and cooked them in the oven for one and a half hours.  I used about half a bottle of bbq sauce.  I kept basting them and adding a bit of sauce about every half an hour.  I will be making these again.

I used half water and half coke to boil the ribs. Like the other reviewers, I also basted the ribs with BBQ sauce every half an hour or so while baking in the oven. My husband and his friends just gobbled them up, and there were any left for me!

LOVED it!  And so did my husband and kids, too.  I ended up using more than a bottle of bbq sauce.  Every 30 min or so I would peel back the foil and add more.

Made these ribs twice now and everyone really enjoyed them.  Even my Dad whom I find is the biggest challenge loved them!  I tend to put more barbeque sauce on them because I like more saucy.  Thanks Lloyd!

I generally par-boil my ribs about 15 minutes then add the sauce and stick them under the broiler until a little charred.  Try using Ah-So sauce instead of BBQ sauce.

I loved the ribs done this way, boiling them left them nice and tender. The only bad thing was the kitchen smelled like garlic for two days! But 10 out of 10 for easyness.

Thanks for this wonderful easy recipe. We all loved it. I almost overcooked them but it was my own fault. Left them in the oven after it automatically shut off. Very good!

Country style? I have no idea, I bought pork side ribs (from Canada, different names for different meats). Anyway....absolutely heavenly! I don't cook ribs often because I could never find a good way to do them. Not anymore, these were great. The meat pulled off the bones just taking them out of the pan. I used the BBQ sauce recipe offered in another review. Definitely one of our faves now!
