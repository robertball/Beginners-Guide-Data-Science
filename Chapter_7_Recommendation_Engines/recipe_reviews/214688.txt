Very moist.  I'm not real big on the whole wheat flour.

This bread took hardly any time to throw together and tastes wonderful and uses ingredients I really like too!  I just needed something to use up some peaches and this worked fabulously.

I made a couple changes after reading reviews.  I added a teaspoon of cinnamon, and I doubled the baking soda.  I didn't have turbinado sugar, so I used brown sugar.
I enjoyed it.  It isn't an overly sweet bread, since  my husband has a sweet tooth, I will recommend he have his with jam.

This is a very moist bread, but it's lacking on flavor. I think it needs a little bit of cinnamon in the mixture to bump it to a five star bread.

I used strawberries instead of peaches since peaches aren't in season.  The actual bread, regardless of the fruit used, tasted good, but the bread didn't rise well at all.  Maybe it needed more baking soda?  I also had trouble with the dough, like maybe there was too much flour.

I made this for my meeting at work. The guys loved it! I have the other loaf left for myself, and it's low in calories, so that's a bonus. Very good for summer!

while tasty it didn't rise much at all -  2 9x5 loaf pans? I was surprised not to see any salt in the mix.....
