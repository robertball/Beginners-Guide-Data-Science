12.17.19  Followed this recipe to the letter, and the only thing I might try next time is using another type of rice.  The short grain rice cooked up a bit too mushy for me, so the texture was just a bit different from the typical rice pudding Iâ€™m used to (but this totally could be personal taste).  On the positive side, this was very, very tasty.  Thanks for sharing your recipe
