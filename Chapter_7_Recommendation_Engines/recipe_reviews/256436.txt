I’m an amateur baker so this recipe took me a little longer than most probably, but it was fun and fairly easy to make. Just a lot of whisking involved. The one problem I had with it was that even though I scored the dough all over, it still rose a bit and I don’t know why. I just cut the puff pastry in half lengthwise to try to fix the thickness which worked okay, but I’d still like to know why it rose and how I can prevent it next time. Still giving 5 stars bc mistakes were probably just made on my part.

I thought this was great and explained perfectly!  I had no problems with mine.  I didn't have vanilla bean at home so I substituted it with 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract.  I also cut back the salt and used only 1/2 teaspoon.  Yummy!

I tried the receipe , it came out same as picture .It tasted great .I added some modification to reduce calories. 
I added 1/4 cup of sugar instead of half to the vanilla custard filling.  I also,  substituted the white glaze with sugar free frosting ( available at Walmar) and the chocolate liners I used decorative gel  frosting pens which made it easy to adjust the brown lines.
Overall , great receipe and directions 
Thanks Chef!!!!!!
