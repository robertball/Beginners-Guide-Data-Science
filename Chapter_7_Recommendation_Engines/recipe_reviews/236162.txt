Recipe Group Selection:  22, February 2014 ~ LOVED IT!  This dish was very well received by my family and my SIL.  I did use 1/2 cup of orange juice in place of half of the water.  I liked the results and would do so again, next time.  I liked that the chicken wasn't breaded or fried.  Because I served this over sticky rice, I wanted extra sauce, so I made another half batch of the sauce.  This is very good as is, but the next time I will add steamed veggies toward the end of the simmering time to add a little bulk.  We love fresh veggies in Asian food and they would be delicious with this sauce.  I would add matchstick carrots and broccoli and green pepper.  If you are looking for a spicier dish because of the Sriracha, 2 tsp. will not be enough to notice.  I added 2 1/2 TBS and it was slightly detected.  My DH and SIL added extra Sriracha to their dish once it was plated.  Thanks for sharing your recipe ppm, it will be made again in our house.

We enjoyed this a great deal.  I have no idea how Chinese restaurants make spicy orange chicken, but this could give them some serious competition.  I used BLSL thighs, cut to bite size pieces but that was my only change.  The next time I think I will toss the chicken bites in cornstarch before I cook them so they get slightly crisp.  I know the submitter was thinking more along the lines of a shredded texture, but we thought  this worked very well.  Thanks for sharing!

Put all the ingredients in crock pot with frozen chicken breasts.  I cooked it on low for 7 hours.  It was great - the kids loved it.  Served with rice for dinner and rolled in tortillas for lunch the next day.

A good recipe  that can be better, we enjoyed it nonetheless.  I followed the recipe except for subbing 1/2 cup orange juice for half the water, increasing the sriracha to 2 Tbsp and adding a corn starch slurry at the end to thicken.    So what changes will make this better? Sub all orange juice for the water and reduce the soy sauce to 1/4 cup.  While I didn't find the recipe as-written overtly over salty I did find that the salt wasn't quit subtle enough for my taste.  I think the substitution of orange juice for the water (thanks Molly for the idea) only intensifies the orange flavor.  I will be making this again with sticky rice and steamed veggies it makes a good addition to our dinner rotation.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This was very good--served over rice.  I'd recommend that first-time users of Sriracha sauce start with the two teaspoons and go from there.  You can always add more, but it's hard to tone it down!  The only changes I made was to use half orange juice and half water as per Molly's suggestion and to thicken the sauce a little with cornstarch.  I would think that apricot jam would also be good in place of the marmalade.  This makes good leftovers.  I will make this again!  Thanks, princesspottymouth!

Made this for Recipe Group...Delicious! I used 3 TBSP. of Sriracha sauce and that was perfect for us. Also, I thickened it in the end w/ a little cornstarch slurry, so it would stick better to the chicken and the Jasmine rice that I served it over. I did not find this salty at all...it was perfect, and a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Although a few days late, I made this for Recipe Group. It was really a fun meal to make and was easy too. I prepared it for 3 adults and a five-year-old. I added 3 Tbs Sriracha hot sauce as others suggested and it was not too spicy for us. The chicken was quite moist and tender. My granddaughter said it was "too orangey" and she really likes oranges! "Sweet" is in the title of this recipe and we adults did think it was too sweet for our taste. I will probably make this again but will reduce the orange marmalade to half of the amount called for. I love trying new recipes. Thanks for submitting.

My 5 year old boy and husband loved it! I served it over rice. If I made it again I would add an extra teaspoon of siracha- couldn't really taste the heat enough. But it was a great weeknight recipe that pleased everyone!

I made this for the recipe group selection of the week. Since I was short on time I made mine chicken in my old Presto pressure cooker. The chicken cooked up nice and tender in the sauce in just 15 minutes, however I did need to use the corn starch slurry to thicken the sauce as others mentioned. I also added in some vegetables and served it over rice. I used about one tablespoon of the Sriracha sauce and that was plenty spicy for us. The orange flavoring stands out in this dish and the leftovers were even better the second night.

Had this for dinner last night. Easy quick and tasty. I halved the recipe as there was only two of us. I did add a corn starch slurry at the end to thicken the sauce and sprinkled chopped green onion on top for color. Will definitely make again.

We loved this dish.  Thighs work as well as breast. I made this in a cast iron skillet but made a note to use a non-stick skillet next time.  Served it with rice and a salad.

DH loved the sweet and spicey combo! I added 2 T Sriracha and was just right for me, but DH added more on his. I put this in the crock pot on low. I should have reduced the water to a half cup, as slow cooking produces a lot of liquid. I used reduced sodium soy sauce, wasn't salty at all and the amount was just right. I checked at 5 hrs and was going to stop the crock pot, but life happened, and it stayed in for over 6 hrs. I thought it was a bit dry by that time. The orange peel in the marmalade breaks down in the crock pot, so I ran the liquid through a mesh strainer and then added a cornstarch slurry. I then mixed the sauce back in with the chicken and onions. Wanted to make this for Recipe Group but kept getting delayed; I will try this recipe again.

This was really good and easy. I used reduced sodium soy sauce because that's all I ever use. I used orange juice in place of the water as others suggested because I like a prominent orange flavor. I used quite a bit more Sriracha sauce than called for in order to detect it...just added it to taste. I didn't have any problems at all with the sauce being watery because I simmered it uncovered until it cooked down and it was nice and thick. I will make this again soon.

Made this for Recipe Group, the simmering really intensified the flavor of the soy sauce to the point that it overwhelmed all of the other flavors. I liked how tender the chicken was but will have to tweak this recipe to get it to my liking. I will reduce the amount of soy sauce next time I make this. I did use 3 tablespoons to the sriracha sauce because I love the flavor and the heat. Thank you for the recipe.

I would suggest using Tamari instead of soy sauce if you are finding it too salty.  Also, for those with wheat allergies, Tamari should have no, to very little wheat in it and is less salty than soy

I just made this tonight.  It went over quite well.  I did modify it a bit though.  One of the roomies is a (Type I) diabetic.  So I used a sugar free marmalade.  I was a bit worried how that would affect the taste;  but it came out nicely.  Also,  I switched the measurements for the sriracha.  I used 4 TBSP.  We handle heat well in this household.

With some minor tweaks, we loved this dish!   I added 2 tbsp. of sriracha instead of 2 tsps. because we love the spice.  I also added a little cornstarch slurry to the end to thicken the sauce because it was a little thin.  It had the flavor profile of orange chicken at the Chinese restaurant without being battered and deep fried.  The chicken was tender, but, a little dry.   I will definitely make again, but, cook the chicken a little less time.

My family really loved this recipe!  I did stray a bit from the method but the result was outstanding.  I roasted some drumsticks until crispy and drained away any fat that accumulated in the pan.  While the chicken roasted I simmered the sauce ingredients in a sauce pan.  I let it cook for about 30 minutes to thicken up a bit and added a cornstarch slurry to make it the thickness of a heavy BBQ sauce. I had my kids taste it and they all agreed that they couldn't taste much of the Siracha and the heat factor just wasn't there for them.  By the time we added/tasted and added some more we probably added 1/3 cup of Siracha to the sauce.  We do like hot-n-spicy :)  I dipped the drumsticks in the sauce and then returned to the oven for about 10 minutes to stay warm.  I thinned the remaining sauce with 1/4 orange juice and served that over rice topped with steamed broccoli.  Dinner was quick and very flavorful.  I know we will be having this again!

Really good stuff! I didn't have BLSL chicken breast so after mutilating some leg quarters (one day I shall learn how to properly debone chicken) I lacked on the amount I needed. Plot twist! I used half shrimp and chicken which worked well. I did add a bit more sriricha just because my family loves it they eat that stuff on saltine crackers for a snack lol. I did thicken the sauce a bit with a cornstarch slurry just because I wanted it to stick to the rice and cabbage I was serving it over. Not to spicy, salty, or hot just a really good mix of flavors.  Huge hit with the family and super easy to make so its a winner in my book!

I did not like this recipe.  It was too thin and too salty.  1/2 cup of soy sauce along with 1 cup of water made too much. And the soy sauce was overpowering and left little room to taste the sirachi sauce - which is the star in this recipe.
I even broccoli and shrimp to the recipe but it was still too thin. I would most likely not make this recipe again or I would tweak it significantly.

After trying it the first time, we made a few minor changes. We didn't add the onions until near the end so they would be crisp tender. We waited to add the marmalade until it was done. Just added after the heat was turned off and let the heat in the pan warm the marmalade.

Tweaked this one pretty heavily but came out great.  Used 4 very large drumsticks, skin on.  Sautee'd about half a medium sized onion and a full tablespoon of chopped garlic (from a jar) for about 5 minutes - At this point it already smelled awesome.  Dropped the legs into the skillet and cooked, covered, for about 15 minutes, turning every few minutes.  Then I added the water, lo-sodium soy sauce and a tablespoon of sriracha and brought it to a boil.  Lower to simmer, keep covered, keep turning chicken every 5 minutes or so, to let the juices soak in evenly.  then added the marmalade for the last 15 minutes - keep covered, and keep turning the chicken every 5 minutes.  SUPER yummy, and the resulting sauce is awesome on plain white rice.  Could probably do this with a couple pounds of boneless/skinless chicken breast, but don't cook it as long or else the chicken will fall apart and get lost in the sauce.

Because my husband cannot eat hot - I used Sweet Baby Rays Sriracha  sauce and added fresh honey - the bite was still there but with a bit more sweetness

This is pretty yummy. I did not find it too sweet OR too salty like some have said. I did to the half cup of OJ with water, and it turned out well. Everything thickened in the end very nicely, and I don't think it needed anything added to thicken it more.

I added 3 tsp of Sriracha and in my opinion, it still wasn't enough. 

I am thinking about adding more vegetables next time, as it simmered for so long that it made the onion undetectable from a visual standpoint.

I wouldn't recommend cooking or simmering for less than what the recipe says, because it is pretty tasteful once the chicken starts to shred.

I made a few changes to go with my low carb diet - swapped the marmalade for walden farms apricot spread (0 cals; 0 carbs) and made cauliflower rice on the side. Turned out great, I'll definitely make this again!!

Overall, I really like this recipe.  I agree with some of the other reviewers who suggested subbing some of the water for orange juice, decreasing the soy sauce (I used lite soy) and upping the sriracha sauce by a teaspoon or so.  I will definitely be making this again, incorporating those suggestions, for personal taste.  I added yellow and red bell pepper at the end, as well as some pineapple chunks and served with fried rice.  YUM!  Thanks for sharing your recipe, princesspottymouth!

I followed the recommendations of others. Cut the soy to just under 1/3 cup. I used GF soy sauce.  Used about 8 ounces of marmalade. And 1 1/2 T of sriracha.  Added some steamed vegetables and served over rice. EXCELLENT.

I made close to as written... I tried to make the recipe from memory instead of pulling it up on my phone. After I started I discovered I had Apricot Preserves not Orange marmalade. I also forgot the water but it was ok because my Apricot preserves were a 16oz jar  not 12oz and it did not need the extra water. I upped the sriracha based on other reviews and found that 2TB was perfect. Can't wait to try it again with orange marmalade.

His recipe was pretty good, the sauce needs to be thickened a bit more so I added some cornstarch. Overall, I was happy with the flavor.

This just tastes like a clumsy attempt to make Asian food.  It pretty much tastes like a mixture of soy sauce and orange marmalade.

This was really good.   I only added 1/2 cup of the water, and 6oz of the orange marmalade, because of some of the other reviewers, and it turned out perfect.   The kids didn't eat it, but I think it was because I added a little more sriracha sauce because I like things spicy. Will make this dish again.

Tasty tasty! Did this for recipe group although I'm a little late. We like spicy so the Sriracha was only noticeable in the flavour category not heat. I followed other reviewers and subbed OJ for the water. Yum. Also added steamed asian veggies at the end. Double yum. Served over brown rice. Yum yum yum. The sauce is not a thick one but I liked it that way for this recipe. Totally a keeper. I will try it with pork next time. I bet that will work well. Thanks princesspottymouth.

Other than cutting the cooking time in (about) half, I made no changes. It was good, not salty in the least, as another reviewer indicated. I'm not a huge fan of orange chicken but the kids liked it :) Not too spicy for them either...just right!

Worked for me. Very easy, tastes very much like the orange chicken you get in restaurants. I also used boneless thigh meat instead of chicken breast.
