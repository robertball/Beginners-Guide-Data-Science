the filling melts when you put it back in oven for the 2-3min. bland cookie would not recommend this one and I love cookies.        Please note that when I made cookies this was not the original recipe.  Someone revised this version. ( Original version didn't have any eggs listed.) Also my comments were edited!)

This is an excellent recipe I have used many times for events and parties.  They have always been a hit and people seek me out to ask for the recipe.  It is one of the most requested baking recipes I use.  Yes, of course the frosting will melt some; that is part of the charm.  If it is a problem, leave them in the oven a bit longer before removing to frost, and a little shorter oven time after.  The melted topping is a real plus.

I love these little gems. I filled with a cream cheese frosting I made that had some jam added... some raspberry and some  peach.  I filled them just a little bit for the first few but them realized how delicious the baked cream cheese is, so I really piled it on. I will make these again for sure.. only thing next time  is I'll add a tiny it of salt to the dough

This is a very good recipe.  Little tender cookies, with a melted icing that covers the tops of the cookies in a thin layer.
Instead of dipping the cookies in egg white, I rolled the balls in colored sugars for Christmas.  Then I made the indentations, and followed the rest of the recipe.  Kind of like a cookie with a cheesecake flavored icing.
Thank you for posting the recipe.

Make with one egg, forget about separating the egg or brushing with egg whites.  Bake for 12 minutes and then just frost the cookies with the scrumptious and light cream cheese frosting, don't rebake.
