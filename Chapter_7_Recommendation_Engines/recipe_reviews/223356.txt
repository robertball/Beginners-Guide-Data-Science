Really enjoyed the taste of the bread! Unfortunately 45 minutes at 375 was nowhere CLOSE to what I needed to bake it. I ended up baking it around 75 minutes and it still needed to be baked longer.(I have yet to do that). You might want to reduce the amount of oil in the bread. I make bread regularly and for the amount of flour this recipe calls for (along with the milk, 3 eggs and 1/3 cup of oil there is really too much moisture. A few tbls of oil is sufficient if used at all because the veggies will have oil and water from cooking. If you want a crispy crust pour a few tabls of melted butter on top of the loaf after pouring the batter into the loaf pan. Otherwise great flavor and thanks for sharing!

This is good - needs a decent amount of salt added, though (1 1/2 tsp. I would say). I threw in some herbs as well for added flavour. Cooks well in 45 mins, could even take it out at 40. Used 4 eggs and no added oil.

So last night I ate it right out of the oven. Delish. Then I had it for lunch cold out of the fridge with some red pepper sauce on top, very quiche-like, but also delish. Now I'm eating it for dinner, sliced somewhat thin, butter on both sides, pan fried, with melted cheese on top. Not only delish, but the best thing EVER. Pan frying it really knocks it our of the park. I did make a few changes to the recipe though. I don't care for swiss so I used sharp cheddar and fresh romano, added some herbs (thyme, rosemary, etc), and did not add the extra oil to the batter. It absolutely does not need it.

This is tasty. I used some red onion instead of a shallot and had a little mexican blend cheese i used as well as a couple of wedges of laughing cow swiss cheese. I completely forgot to salt and pepper the veggie mixture and yes it needed it. Still good w/o it but next time I'll remember

This was wonderful. It is more like a cheesy bread loaf with vegetables (rather than a vegetarian version of meatloaf, which I was concerned it might be). The cheese makes it fantastic! It is more mild flavors so I found it better when paired with a strongly flavored side dish. I made it as written, next time I might try it with more bell peppers or even a jalepeno to give it more of a kick.

Made this for the first time last weekend with some homemade pumpkin soup. They went great together. I think it needs more salt, but that is of course to taste.  We are going to add diced jalapeno when I make it again this weekend!

I made this twice. I varied it by using pepper jack cheese the second time. Both efforts were outstanding and delicious. I increased (doubled it) the amount of oil used to sauteed the veggies and omitted the additional oil called for in the recipe and I used scallions instead of shallot. Rave reviews all my friends and family who sampled it. I also made mini loaves to give to friends.

This is one of my new favorite dishes.  I must admit I've yet to make it the way the recipe advises though....  This dish lends itself very well to altering.  My parents weren't too impressed with it (my dad is a big meat and potatoes guy) until I started pointing out all the leftover veggies in the bread.  It's a great way to use up leftovers.  I keep a tub in the freezer and stash whatever is left after dinner there.  As long as the veggies I'm using are similar enough to the texture of the ingredients called for, it works.

I took other reviewers tips and used about half the olive oil this recipe called for. I also added a little more garlic ( we love garlic) and had to cook it in a glass baking dish. This was very simple to make and delicious. I think the next time I make this I will use a sharp cheddar cheese instead. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I tried this today and substituted the courgette with mushrooms.  Very tasty result and not breadlike at all.  I will use a sharper cheese next time.

This is delicious as is and was a big hit with my husband and kids, even my two picky toddlers! It is kind of quiche-like and eggy and would be great for a brunch.  I can't wait to experiment with different veggie combinations!

This is great! I substituted a small onion for the shallot, and I also added some chives. My batter was quite thick.  I brushed the top with butter the last few minutes of baking.  Tastes delish.  Would probably be good with different cheeses, but I used a good, strong Swiss, and it was fantastic. Thanks!

Add 25 min to cooking...very soggy and uncooked. Less oil. More garlic, maybe some thyme. Might try broccoli next time. Very delicious and an unexpected surprise!!

Followed recipe except did not add the extra 1/3 C of oil, and it came out nice and soft, was finished at 45 minutes. I suggest adding about 1/2 to 3/4 teaspoon salt to the veggies as they cook. I brushed butter on top before baking.  My husband and I enjoyed it, but we both feel it needs herbs.  Our 3-year-old didn't like it, unfortunately.

Very good recipe to use your veggies. I didn't have Ny eggplant so I added more zucchini.. Used sharp cheddar and mozzarella and used a total of about 1/4-1/3 cup of olive oil. I baked mine in a casserole dish instead of in a casserole dish instead of in a loaf pan.l

Really enjoyed this dish. It was a bit thick and not sure if it was suppose to be that thick or if I did something wrong. Substituted milk with soy milk and used vegan cheese. Was not sure about using egg replacer to make this totally vegan and opted to just use eggs this first time around.

I love this!  You can use any kind of vegetables and any kind of cheese...(Mine was zucchini, squash, mushrooms, spinach, green bean, and tomato with garlic, shallot, and scallion with sharp cheddar blend and fresh parm).

The first time I made this I used all purpose flour and it was a huge fail. The second time I went out and bought the self raising flour and followed the recipe exactly and it looks great and is very yummy! My two year old loves it too.

Added an egg and omitted oil. Seemed questionable when mixing it but loved the result.  My 2 and 4 year olds are it up and I loved the leftovers for breakfast.  It's a cross between a quiche and a bread.  All the veggies hidden in there will make this a regular dish.

Very tasty, though either the time isn't long enough or you really really shouldn't make this with soymilk. It wasn't a planned deviation, we were just out of regular. I can't wait to retry this with the proper ingredients.

I came across this while looking for something different to do with eggplant. I scaled it down to 2 eggs, and I wanted it higher so I used an 8x4 loaf pan.  I don't usually have self-rising flour on hand, so I made some using the recipe for it on this site, and it worked great. (Some reviews mentioned it didn't rise good using a/p flour.) I used tri-color frozen peppers and seeded the tomato. The batter was quite thick so I did add more milk. I also added a little chopped onion and dried shallots to the saute beforehand. The outside texture reminded me of that of a popover along with a egginess inside. Since it is called a  'French' loaf, I added about a tsp of Herbs de Provence (rosemary, thyme, lavender blend), and that gave it a good flavor. I drizzled the top with 1 tblsp of melted butter which gave it nice color and texture.  The loaf tested done at 40 min, but I think I could have taken it out at 35 min. Nice way to use up fridge veggies.  A reviewer mentioned that pan-frying a thin, buttered slice, topped with cheese was delicious, so I'd like to try that. Very good and different recipe. UPDATE: I did the pan-fry thing with cheese and it was great!

Delicious and comforting bread. I didn't have Swiss cheese and had feta left over so I decided to transform it into a Greek themed bread. Also added a handful of black olives and lessened the amount of zucchini to balance the addition. Added a couple of teaspoons of dried oregano and a teaspoon of thyme to add to the Greek theme and it came out beautifully

I made this without the cheese and found this to be very enjoyable.  My husband was not a fan.

Amazing recipe! 
I didn't had self rising flour, so I've just added the some amount of flour with 1/4 tbs of baking soda and it  was just perfect. Surely I'll cook it again. Thank you!

Quite possibly one of the tastiest things I've tasted in my life. Leave it to the French!

Required considerably more cooking time than stated in recipe and was still very doughy. I decreased the olive oil in recipe to only what was needed to cook vegetables and to oil and flour the baking dish. I also halved the amount of milk. Was still too much liquid. Was very bland even with tbsp of oregano, tbsp of basil, and 1/5 tbsp of black pepper and 1/5 tbsp of salt. If I were to remake this I might reference a vegetable soufflé recipe to make changes... More eggs and less flour.
