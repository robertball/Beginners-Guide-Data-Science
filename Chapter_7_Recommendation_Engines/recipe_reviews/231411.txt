This is a colorful, tasty alternative to a lettuce-based salad.  With a nice mix of veggies and a lively vinaigrette, it will find a place on my table, often.  I followed the recipe very closely, only subbing in cherry tomatoes, which I had on hand.  The next time I make this, I will add a bit less onion, and perhaps grate it into the vinaigrette.  I also added a pinch of salt, after tasting.  Thanks for the idea!

This is a marvelous side. I served it with the Mango Chicken Piccata found on this website and a sweet potato. It was wonderful. The only change I made to this recipe was the addition of pine nuts and a bit of blue cheese. It hit the spot. This is a side that will be presented to guests the year round. Wonderful addition to the Mango Chicken Piccata.

I made this for a Christmas family dinner. Doubled the recipe, except for the onion. Festive looking dish. Quite Tasty. Don't know how it made it to the dinner, as I couldn't stop tasting it. Will definately make this again!

I rate the vegetable combination with 5 stars.  So pretty, so healthy, and a good combination of crisp, tangy and mellow.  But I didn't love the dressing.  I found it to be too tart.  I will make this again, but will experiment with a different vinaigrette dressing.  (You don't want a creamy dressing which would cover up how pretty it is.)

This was great! I didn't have Dijon but yellow mustard worked just as well. I only had 1/2 purple onion also and I think that was enough.
