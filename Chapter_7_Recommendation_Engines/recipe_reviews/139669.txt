This is almost the EXACT recipe made by Giada DeLaurentiis (Everyday Italian) on the Food Network...  The only diffenence here is the dried basil - she uses fresh!  We made it using her recipe directions which was to rub each scallop with the olive mixture rather than toss.  I don't eat scallops but my fiance said they were OK.  The olive mixture he said lended an odd but not bad flavor.  Very pretty presentation though and easy to make up ahead and bake when desired.

This was not our favorite and am thinking due mostly to the black olives; will try again leaving out the olives and add some fresh garlic.

This was ok; we made as directed but cooked on the grill instead of in the oven. The flavors of tomato and basil came through strongly, but didn't really work with the prosciutto. And if I'm going to buy scallops, I'd prefer a recipe that really lets the scallop flavor shine instead of masking it with other things. So I won't make this again.
