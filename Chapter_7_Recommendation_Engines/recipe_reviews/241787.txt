I added 1/2 of butter with the first layer of graham cracker to hopefully make a kind of crust. It didn't hold together as much as I would have hoped, but it still tasted amazing. It's the closest I've come to the taste of a real s'more without a campfire in years.

I made this for my grandson, my husband walked in the kitchen before I put it in the oven and didn't think it would be good. Oh boy oh boy - grandson, husband and I loved it!!! Melted butter in bottom of pan was a great addition.

I only did one layer bc I had a small pan and I would not crumble the gram crackers bc they did not stick to the chocolate but other than that it was vary good, I would definitely have this again

It was relatively easy to make and was enjoyed by all who ate it, as well as myself. It did taste like a no-fire smore! I enjoyed not needing to have a fire. I would like to make this again soon!

My kids had a lot of fun making this with me, and it's super easy. The mini marshmallows came out tasting sort of like the marshmallows in the Smores Grahams cereal, if you know what those taste like. I liked it, but next time I might try using regular marshmallows to get more gooey marshmallowey goodness.

This was a hit for everyone in our family, including the son that doesn't usually eat sweets. 
It's easy to make, and scrumptious.
