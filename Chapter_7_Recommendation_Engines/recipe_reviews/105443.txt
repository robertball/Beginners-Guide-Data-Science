I wound up adding significantly more granulated Splenda to this recipe to adjust the sweetness, but once I did that, they were yummy.  I also patted the dough into a sprayed 8" x 8" baking pan and baked it for 20 minutes.  The taste was very good and the texture was similar to regular shortbread.  This is the first recipe I've tried with granulated Splenda that really produced a tasty dessert.

I LOVE this recipe. Easy to do and my husband enjoys the taste as well.  I'm a CHOCOHOLIC AND a diabetic so this recipe helps me when I crave the chocolate at night time.

I  made this first as the recipe is written and I didn't think they were that good. So next time I used waaay less flour and it was much better - a really nice dark chocolate flavour.

Delicious! Super crumbly, fine texture and not overly sweet. You can even add finely chopped pecans or macadamia nuts to the top. This would also be delicious dipped in some melted white or milk chocolate. I'll be making these in double batches because they go fast.

Mine turned out too crispy and it was very difficult to roll out.  But, I did top them with the powdered sugar glaze that I had added 1/2 a teaspoon of mint extract to and they taste like Thin Mints :)
