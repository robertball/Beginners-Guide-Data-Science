Folks, if you're having a problem getting the eggs cooked enough, it's because this is not prepared like a real frittata which is started out in a skillet.  Your pumpkin (4 cups is too much for 8 eggs)and potato and onion should be sauteed (separately, of course) then the eggs poured in and cheese added, cook till the bottom is set, then place in hot oven or under broiler.  Sauteeing the veg will add so much more flavor to the pan than pre-cooking in a microwave (yuk); and in a good skillet, I have never had a frittata stick.  This way, it cooks in a lot less time and you don't have a bunch of bowls to wash--just one skillet.  Also, for any dish to be flavorful and not one dimensional, you must season each component--not just the final conglomeration.

My whole family loved this one.  After reading other reviews I did make a few alterations.  I added cooked diced onion to the egg mix and topped the frittata  with tomato slices rather than the sliced onion.  I also used frozen spinach rather than fresh.  Very easy and very tasty recipe that we'll definitely be making again.

I don't actually use recipes, per se. I never make the same thing twice, but often get stuck on inspiration.    So thank you for launch idea on a wonderful not-so-usual brunch this morning.     I substituted baked sweet potato (already on hand) for both pumpkin and potato, added raw pistachios and some salt/generous black pepper, served with side of steamed carrot greens (I like slight bitter with my sweet).    I baked it using cast iron, as I usually do with an egg dish. It was wonderful; my husband, however, ate all of it so there's no leftovers to try it cold.

Yummy!!! I tried this recipe b/c it was the closest I could come to a pumpkin frittata that I had in Sydney about a week ago. I subbed butternut squash and reduced the cheese and added some cilantro, and corriander and it was great! I still have some tweaking to do before it's 5 star worthy, but I think it just needs a bit more butternut than I added and maybe a little more salt...great as is though...can't wait to make it for my bf...he'll love it!

first and foremost, i only made one serving instead of four. in doing so, i cooked it in a glass loaf dish.
maybe because of the reduction, i had more veggies & cheese than i probably should have and needed to add a third egg to make it look right before putting it in the oven. also, maybe because of the dish i used, i had to cook it for about 33 minutes to ensure the egg was set, resulting in my perhaps too thin red onions on top becoming dry and chewy (they were about 1mm thick). maybe if i make this in the future i will put the onion in with the rest of the mixture and on top.
over all the flavors worked well with one another & the potato was a hesitant but wonderful addition. it's more like a crust-less quiche than a frittata, but it was very easy to throw together and tasted great!

I used butternut squash as the submitter mentions in the description. I also cut this back to one serving. It looked as though there was not enough egg in the mixture, but when it did firm up, it was just the right amount. Even though I only made one serving and used a smaller baking dish, this still took the full 25 minutes to bake. The sweetness from the squash was evident in the final dish. I needed to add a good bit of salt and pepper to the finished product, which made me wish I'd added it before baking.

Added salt and pepper, and red onion chopped into the mixture. Topped with the squash seeds, dry roasted, and some parmesan. Got rave reviews.

The kids fought over who got more of this.  I made it without any pumpkin or potato as I didn't have any on hand.  I added 2 gloves minced garlic.  It took 35-40 minutes to firm up in my oven, but I used an oval instead of 10" square pan.  Very, very good.

Excellent.  Included onions in frittata (onions were mentioned only in ingredients).  They added a nice crunch.  Got rave reviews:)

This was a great recipe, I was looking for a warm veg to go with our beer can in a chicken and made this. Instead of the onions on the top though, I threw coarsely chopped crackers, pumpkin seeds and extra grated cheese and crumbled feta. It was lovely but I like things a bit more warm so next time I'll throw in a dash of chilli spice. Thanks for a great recipe and I'll definitely use this again for another South African winter "braai"

I followed another reviewer's tip and sauteed the onion first until carmelized, then sprinkled salt and nutmeg over the onion and stirred together. I stirred in the already cooked fresh pumpkin and sweet potato ( I was out of regular potato) along with some salt, added spinach, then reduced-fat sharp cheddar and reduced-fat feta cheese, then egg, stirring each time I added an ingredient into the skillet. After it was mixed, I poured it into a Mrs. Smith's pie crust (I cooked the crust earlier in the day). Based on someone's review that there was too much pumpkin and potato for the eggs, I decided to use only half of the onion, pumpkin, sweet potato mixture and mashed it for another day. That was a good call. It came out great. One warning: I had too much filling for the pie crust (9") so poured the rest into a small casserole dish and cooked them both 35 minutes, which worked out fine. My husband and me liked this, but it didn't pass my 3 year olds' taste test.

It was good but I went ahead and followed the suggestions of other people who did reviews so I added salt and quite a bit of pepper to the egg mixture, as well as diced red onion.  I found it was still runny at first when following the original directions but I decreased the temperature to 350°F and cooked for about 15 minutes longer then took it out and it seemed to solidify after sitting on the stove top for for about another 10 to 15 minutes.

As other reviewers mentioned, I would put onions in the egg mixture instead of on top. All the veggies and such were a LOT for this much egg, so I ended up adding 4 more. It was good though!

WONDERFUL!  I sauteed the onion in olive oil and put it on the bottom of the casserole dish, and then piled the butternut squash (instead of pumpkin) and potato on top, then feta, wilted fresh spinach, poured on the eggs and topped with the cheddar.  Everyone at the table loved it and had seconds, except for the toddler who could not be diverted from the Turkish red lentil and mint soup I had also made.
