I like the flexibility of this recipe - it was good chilled but can also be served with the chicken hot off the grill.  Additional vegetables can also be added, which is a plus.  I agree with the previous reviewer that the lemon flavor was weak, so I also added more lemon juice, and brushed the chicken with lemon juice while grilling.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  A good picnic salad. Thanks!

I made this exactly as written, tasted, and felt adjustments were needed.  The lemon flavor was weak, so I added additional lemon juice as well as lemon zest.  I think this pasta salad is a bit lacking in seasoning, so I did add some pepper and a little more garlic salt.   If you're looking for a bold pasta salad, this isn't for you, as the flavor is mild and mellow.  I'm not the world's biggest pasta salad person, but I do enjoy one occasionally.   This made a nice dinner along with a fresh fruit salad and hot bread.  Thanks philly6288 for sharing.

Good basic recipe. Followed other comments, and used olive oil in place of vegetable oil and lemon zest for more flavor. Substituted baby arugula for spinach, added cherry tomatoes for a pop of color. Served with shrimp instead of tossing in chicken.

Great flavor. Used chopped garlic rather than powder.  Had to add more oil and lemon the next day

As others have suggested, this recipe needs some honing. I used olive oil and found I needed to add more after I'd tossed in the pasta and chicken, along with more garlic salt and pepper. I like the idea of using arugula and will try that next time, as the spinach leaves seemed a bit unwieldly (and a 10 oz bag is way too much. I used maybe 3 oz.). In the interest of time, I also cheated and used pre-cooked and sliced seasoned Italian chicken strips.

Nice change. Added lemon zest and some extra veggies to adjust it to our taste. Will make it again
