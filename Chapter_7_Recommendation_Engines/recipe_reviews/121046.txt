I changed the orange juice to apple juice and instead of the oil I use applesauce.  Instead of reg. sugar I used splenda, but still used reg. brown sugar.  Instead of oat bran I used bran flakes and made them into flour to get the right amt.

they turned out yummy!!!

I have made many banana muffins in the past, but these are by far my favorite! I added about 1/8 c of ground flax and used raisins instead of the nuts. My wife and I had them eaten in a day!

This recipe is delicious!  We are trying to cut back on junk in the house, but still need a little "fluff" to go with tea, and this fit the bill quite nicely.  Just remember that this is a bran muffin, not a cakey-sweet one!
Changes made: used All Bran cereal, soaked in the orange juice (light) to soften and added to wet ingredients.  Substituted strawberry-banana applesauce for the oil, added 1 tsp of vanilla.
Used 1C white, 1C wheat flour.
Pureed four small bananas, chunked three small bananas.
To a few, added a dollop of local dark honey to top of muffin prior to baking.

I followed the recipe  without doing any modifications and the result was a healthy, hearty, moist, perfectly spiced Banana bran muffin.  My only complaint is that we could taste the baking soda/powder.  I will reduce the amount next time. THX

Like other reviewers I used applesauce in place of oil.  As well, I used Splenda regular and brown instead of "real" sugar, and omitted nuts to cut calories.  This is a very pliable--as in apparently you can't do much to ruin it--recipe!  The only mistake I made was to use paper liners...and we lost half of each muffin stuck to paper.  My bad!

I love this recipe, so easy to put together and great flavor.  I cut down on the allspice a bit to get more banana flavor to come thru.

This is what I was looking for--moist, flavorful, and healthy.  I substitued cider for the OJ, and applesauce for most of the oil--I just added 2 tbsp. oil.  I added raisins too because we like them.  They came out great!

amazing, really moist and light. I made as outlined (except no nuts as allgeric) and also made using honey instead of the sugars (and using just a little less overall) and both versions were great.

Fabulous.
I substituted wholegrain spelt flour for the whole wheat and canola for the vegetable oil.  I left the banana chunks kind of big, will really make them soft for next time.  Excellent taste.

These are great muffins!!! I used all whole wheat flour and didn't add nuts because I didn't have any. And I actually forgot to put the oil, but they still turned out awesome and really moist. Super recipe, thanks!

I cut this recipe in half to make 12 muffins. I used melted butter instead of vegetable oil (I'm running low until payday) and I added one teaspoon vanilla. These turned out moist and fluffy and I really loved how the oat bran added texture and added more fiber BUT I think it could use more banana and less orange juice. I think next time I make this, I'd add more banana and cut the orange juice back. Maybe use almost a cup of mashed banana and a quarter cup of condensed orange juice concentrate? That was my only issue, it need more banana!

The only changes I made in this recipe was  1/2 of another banana and omited the walnuts. We do not like walnuts. The muffins turned out very delicious and moist. Thank you for sharing the recipe.

I just made these & they are really yummy and healthy. Some alterations: Substituted 1/2 homemade applesauce for oil; didn't add nutmeg & allspice as i didn't have any, reduced baking soda by half tsp. For flour, I didn't have any bran, so used 100gm quaker oats ground fine in mixer & rest used whole meal flour to increase the nutritional value. My 1 yr old liked it too! Will make again and share with mom back home :)

These were a hit with the kids and husband.  Have used both apple or orange juice and both work well.

These are so good that I'm having a hard time not eating the entire batch at once!  The only change I made was to use all white whole wheat flour.  Next time, just for fun, I will experiment with replacing the sugar with honey, as suggested by other reviewers.

Amazing!!! I couldn't stop eating them out of the pan! Even better with butter spread over them :) I had to use wheat bran in place of the whole wheat flour because I didn't have any on hand. Excellant!!!

My kids are fussy and they loved these. I added applesauce instead of oil, pineapple juice instead of orange and added mini choc chips. 
Delish!!!!!

These are GREAT!  Went with the suggestion of raisins vs nuts - could also see other dried fruit ie. cranberries or blueberries - went with cooking spray for muffin tins rather then liners, can totally see how the muffins would stick to paper and that would be a sad waste of these yummy muffins, I think I am going to have one now...!

These muffins are delicious!  I think you can play around with the ratio of whole wheat and white flour, and spices to suit your own tastes.  I couldn't really notice any orange flavour, but obviously it must add to the overall tastiness of the muffins.  I din't use paper liners, just grease the muffin tins well.  Recipe only made 18 muffins for me, not 24.

Other than omitting the nuts, this recipe was  followed to the letter. I love how subtly different these (basically banana) muffins taste. This would be due to the spices, as I could not detect the orange juice. They are a refreshing change from the ordinary. They were incredibly light textured and perfectly moist. One could easily increase the proportion of whole wheat to all purpose flour and still be very happy with the results, which is exactly what I will do next time to increase this recipe's nutritional clout. This will become another 'go to' everyday muffin recipe for me.

good, but I'd reduce the leavening (soda and baking powder) by half next time as I prefer a denser, less puffy muffin.  I added date pieces and whole, sweetened dried cranberries.  Yum!

Delightful, healthy muffins, and a flexible recipe for those without a well stocked kitchen. Was short an egg, so substituted half a banana for egg. Used oat bran flour instead of oat bran. Added 1 tablespoon of orange zest to compliment the cinnamon.  If you are short on ingredients you don't have to go muffinless. I froze have batch for busy mornings. Thanks for great recipe!

Even considering that this was a 'healthy' bread, it was very good. I used wheat bran and subbed soy milk for eggs since I was out, without anything going wrong with the bread. The texture is good, not creamy like usual banana bread, but wholesome textured.

These are fast, easy and yummy little muffins.  I made these as mini muffins, for my daughter's class. The recipe is very forgiving. I had to make some substitutes, (I made them 2 hours before the class picnic, and didn't have everything on hand.)  I used strawberry banana juice, and instead of OJ and natural wheat bran instead of the oat bran.  I've made these about 10 times now, and they always  turn out great.

Perfect score with these changes:  Made recipe for 24 muffins.  I  used 4 previously frozen and thawed bananas, 2 shredded apples (no OJ on hand), chocolate chips, only 1t cinnamon, 1/4 t nutmeg, wheat bran (no oat bran), all purpose flour, all brown sugar, and no allspice (none at home).   I found the batter a bit too wet so added 1/2c more flour. The final result was amazing!  Next time around I will do it the exact same thing except would double the walnuts.

AMAZING! super moist and not too sweet. I also added to recipe: 2 tbs flax, 1 tsp vanilla, substituted applesauce for the oil and used 3 really ripe bananas. Definitely will be using this recipe again and again.

These are fantastic, I went with Apple instead of Banana, our family always make homemade tart applesauce in the fall. I exchanged the banana for thick applesauce (I might try apple juice instead of orange next time). I also tried a dozen with an apple crisp topping, YUM! sticking a few chunks of a tart apple in the middle helps to offset the excess sweetness.

No matter what way to make these muffins they're delicious!

Great muffins...followed exactly but topped them off with br.sugar and cinnamon.  Nice muffin tops.  Did not use muffin liners.

Pretty nice.  For the record, I threw in a couple handfuls of raisins, tablespoon of water and TBSP of chia seeds and skipped the nuts.  

FYI chia seeds are awesome, try 'em, you'll like 'em.

OK, hilarious story. So the ONLY reason I made this recipe was because I had bananas I needed to use up. Well guess what - got so rushed, I skipped the bananas and walnuts. :P Still tasty, but probably better with the missing ingredients!

I'm always looking for ways to use up overripe bananas.  These muffins are very good, moist and spicy. The only changes I made were substituting honey for the white sugar and egg substitute for the eggs.

Absolutely a keeper!! Both my toddlers gobbled up a muffin and asked for more. The only thing I did was use all white flour because I didn't have wheat flour and used applesauce in place of oil. So tasty and moist. will make again soon. I figured the calorie content of the muffins --If you make the 2 dozen it turns out to about 95 calories each. Nice healthy snack.

After many failed attempts making a banana bread that is done in the middle but not burnt on the outside, I decided to make these muffins.  They are fabulous!  All the banana bread flavor without the long baking time and gooey middle.  They freeze great for a quick weekday breakfast!  I'll never make banana bread again...

These muffins are great. I just made them today. I cut the recipe in half and they worked just fine. I backed off on the spices a little though; I prefer to taste a lot of banana. I only used about a tablespoon of oil, then filled the rest of the measuring cup with applesauce and it worked great. Oil (or any fat) carries flavor, so I don't usually cut it out completely. Also, I didn't have oat bran, so I ground some All-Bran cereal (the original kind...not the flakes) into a flour. Great recipe! I'm sure it would be just as delicious exactly as the recipe is...so I rated it, despite my changes. Thanks Shelley!

Made this recipe as is, EXCEPT I didn't have oat bran but I did have wheat germ.  I was afraid the recipe would be too dry, so I might have added a bit more bananas- it's so difficult to get an accurate reading when measuring mashed bananas anyway.  However, they turned out fabulous.  I took the advice of storing the remaining in the freezer.  It's a great breakfast in the morning since it's been so hot.  Thanks for a great recipe!  My family loves it too!

This recipe is perfect as submitted and doesn't need any modifications as far as I am concerned. Nice balance of spices and banana flavor. The texture is moist and light. Thanks. I will definitely add this to my collection of muffin recipes.

GREAT recipe!  I doubled the amount of bananas & cut back a little on the cinnamon.  I want to try it without the egg to make it vegan for my daughter. Very fast and easy to make.

Best muffins ever!  I realized at the last minute I was out of oat bran, so I used wheat bran instead.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  I ended up with 24 regular size muffins and 10 mini muffins.  I will definitely be buying extra bananas from now on just so I can make these...sooo yummy!

These muffins are fantastic!  I did sub applesauce for the oil (1:1), only used 1 1/4 tsp of baking soda, used 1 1/2c of whole wheat flour and 1/2c of white flour. I also omitted the allspice and walnuts. The muffins (12 regular size and 36 minis) were a hit!  Both of my kids devoured them, as did my husband. It felt good knowing that they were, on the whole, gaily healthy too. I just need to find a way to sneak a few veggies in with the next batch :)

Pretty good bran muffin. Subbed applesauce for the oil per other reviews. My brown sugar was too old to use so I had to use all regular (organic cane) sugar. Only giving it 4 stars b/c I feel like it needs something else. Maybe some chopped apples or raisins or something. Will make again.

I added a handful of dried cranberries and sunflower seeds and substituted half and half for the orange juice out of necessity.   They were more than well received at a brunch.

Finally a yummy, semi healthy muffin that even I can bake successfully.  And the hubby and kids loved them too.   I'd didn't have orange juice but did have some oranges so I used half cup fresh squeezed oj and half cup of skim milk and they came out awesome.

Very good recipe that is easily adapted. I altered to accommodate what I had on hand: 1 c flour, 1/2 c milled flax seed, 2 c All bran cereal soaked in 1 1/4 c orange juice, 1 t. cinnamon, 2 t b powder, 2 t b soda, 1/2 t nutmeg, 1/4 tsp allspice, 3 egg whites, 1/2 c sugar, 1/4 c veg oil, 3 ripe bananas. Skipped the nuts for my daughter.  For a 'whole grain/bran' type muffin, they are light - I love this.  I will probably use more spices next time, plus a 1/2 t of salt - I was low on cinnamon.  Any additions would work: nuts, dried fruit, blueberries.  I am very pleased with my first results and will definitely be using this recipe frequently for healthy wholesome delicious muffins.  Thanks for sharing it!

These muffins are great.  I was looking for something healthy to take to work with me in the morning, and this fit the bill.  They taste great and 2 keep me full until lunch.  Slight alterations I made were: subbed applesauce for oil, added flax seed, used 1.5 cups of wheat flour and .5 cups of regular flour, brown sugar only, and slightly more bananas than the 1 cup.  These muffins have it all, fruit, protein, omega 3s, whole grains, and TASTE.

very tasty! i changed mine a bit.. i used only whole wheat flour and some corn starch to make it fluffy.. also, instead of oat bran i used organic flax plus multibran cereal from nature's path which worked very well.. on a few i tried putting a dollop of honey as another user suggested.. didn't work out so well.. won't be doing that again

SUPER YUMMY and EASY recipe! I didn't have "oat bran" so instead I used Bran Cereal and ground it up in my food processor (two cups of cereal comes to 1 cup of GROUND bran for the recipe). I then soaked the cereal in the orange juice to soften it up. Mixed all the ingredients together and they turned out great! OH! I also mixed in some raisins and the flavors works GREAT with the banana bran muffins! The banana doesn't overpower the muffins at all.

I made these just now-and let me tell you. These are soooo good. They are wonderfully hearty and wholesome, and a gorgeous warm brown color.    I did add some orange extract along with the orange juice, and some ground cloves as well. I will definitely make these again!

I made these muffins exactly according to the recipe, and they were delicious. I was a little worried that you wouldn't be able to taste the banana flavor, but they definitely had a banana taste to them. I will definitely make these again!

i made this exactly as listed..  but i did use apple juice instead of orange juice, only because i didn't have orange juice..  they were great, and even my picky kids loved them..  when they came home from school, they said the house smelled great while they were baking.

really good! I didnt have any nutmeg and used cloves instead, really good! I think some chopped apples may be good in here but not sure what that would do to the muffins. Overall great base that can be changed and added to to make them to your own tastes!( nuts, chocolate chips, coconut ets

I make muffin's for my boyfriend lunch and he won't each bran muffins. He does love oatmeal muffins so using oat bran was great and he loved them. The only changes I made were the common health tweaks..apple sauce, egg whites ect.

My husband who likes cinnamon but does not believe in banana cakes, loves these. I didn't use any nut as I didn't have any at that time. He keeps asking me to make them again to bring to work. Thanks!

A good healthy muffin.  I had a few really black bananas to use up so I thought I'd try this.  I subbed milk for the oj (I didn't have any in the house), subbed a pureed banana for the veg oil, just used cinnamon and a dash of allspice and subbed raisins for the nuts.  I did find these a bit bland tasting but I think that was because I used milk.  Will also cut down the cinnamon next time too.  It was a bit much.

These were excellent.  They were very moist and flavourful.  I added extra cinnamon cause we like it, but next time I would cut it back to the original amount cause it was a bit overpowering for the other subtle flavours.

They defineatly were easy.  I found they nutmeg to be too much and the banana not enough.  I emptied the tins right away but found the muffins to be spongy. I would adjust the time/temp if I made these again.

They are so good! The changes I made were as follows... 1/2 c. bran + 1/2 c. wheat germ, 1/2 c. pearsauce instead of oil, 3 T. ground flax meal, and 1 tsp. sea salt. Very moist and filling. Thanks for sharing. :)

I love these muffins...I am a bit of a chocolate junky and not a fan of nuts so I swap out the nuts for chocolate chips.  My boyfriend loves them so much that every week we buy extra bananas so we can have these muffins all the time!

pretty good. I only used 1 1/2 t each of both baking soda and baking powder. And used 3/4 cup honey with 1 c wheat and 1 c white. don't skimp at all on sugar. I also just added 1/2 c more banana instead of oil and did only 1/4 t. nutmeg. Tasted good and was plenty fluffy. yay.

Awesome muffins! Loved the spices. Made a few substitutions only because I was out of a few things: Apple juice for the OJ, and wheat bran for the oat bran. They came out amazing, and my kids devoured them. I bet using the OJ would taste even better! Can't wait to try. Will be making these again for sure!

Giving this five stars because of how they were gobbled up.  I did not have oat bran, so used 1/2 cup oats and 1/2 cup whole bran. Added more bananas and did not use nuts. They are certainly heavier than other banana muffins, but they are appetizing and great hunger-busters. Also felt good about packing this as a snack for my son.  Needed a bit more sweetness, though... Will keep tweaking!

i modified slightly, only used all purpose for the flours, added 1 teaspoon Pure Vanilla Extract. substituted 1/2 cup applesauce (normally i use organic but i only had Blueberry Delight, didn't really affect taste) for the 1/2 cup oil. and since it would have gone to waste i put in an extra banana (close to 1/2 cup). only used Brown Sugar (1 cup). also added some chocolate chips.  i baked for about 12-18 minutes depending on the size of your muffin pan (i used two different ones). this came out very well and will probably do apple cinnamon muffins soon.

I love this recipe!!!  It was very simple to make.  I did make a few changes, I only added 1 and a half tsp of cinnamon, changed the oil to melted margerine (I was out of oil)  and I didn't have any nutmeg so I left that out.  I also didn't add any nuts since they are for school lunches.  Still its a fabulous bran muffin recipe.

Very good.  I made a few changes: used all whole wheat flour rather than some all purpose and some whole wheat; I didn't use Allspice (b/c I didn't have any); egg beaters; apple juice instead of orange; splenda blend instead of sugar; sugar free applesauce instead of oil; no nuts; and in some added craisens or dried blueberries....very very very good!  I wasn't sure with all my changes but they are moist and flavorful.

Delicious and healthy tasting, with a nice, chewy texture. I cut the amount of sugar in half and thought they were a bit dry, but that could be a result of reducing the sugar. I will add shredded carrot or applesauce next time to add some moisture, but overall these are very nice.

These were fabulous! This recipe needs to be shared with the whole world! I adjusted the baking time and temp because of my oven, but the only other change was using ground ginger because I had no allspice. I can't believe how tasty yet healthy these are! In a day or two when I have to make more, I'll add an 1/8 cup flaxseed meal like another reviewer suggested. YUM!!!

very good muffins ! Moist, fluffy. I followed the recipe - just added less baking soda - it seemed too much in the recipe - I added chocolate chips. Had doubts about the OJ, but I think that's what gives muffins moisture. It works perfect together.   Thanks for sharing.

This is the best banana bran muffin recipe that I've ever tried.  I didn't have oat bran, but I used natural wheat bran.  I also added a handful of raisins along with the bananas.  The muffin was moist & delicious.  Definitely a keeper, thanks, Shelley!
