There must be something missing in this recipe.  I tried it and it did not turn out very well.  There seems to be to much water and not enough syrup and molasses in this pie.   Any way I had to throw ti out.   Cna you tell me if maybe 1 cup of water is to much and if this pie should be baked longer than what the recipe called for.  Mypie turned out really soggy.

I tried this recipe, and when I cut into the pie to serve it, the bottom was all liquid...did I do something wrong? It tasted good but seemed to be a strange consistency.

Made the recipe to your directions but added 1/2 cup mollases. It turned out wonderful. After cooling, the layer of mollases syrup on the bottom thickened just enough. Thanks for this recipe!
