I use this often in lasagna.  Instead of the cream and broth, I use 2 cups milk and a bouillon cube.  Sometimes I'll also add in some grated emmental or parmesan cheese.

I thought this was DELICIOUS pasta sauce, although I made lots of substitutions based on my cupboard and because I'm a vegetarian.

I used skim milk and added an extra T. of flour.  I used dehydrated minced onion, and vegetable stock instead of chicken broth.  For spices I used a few sprinkles of Italian seasonings and a little chili powder.  

I would use this again for pasta sauce (I might use one T. flour so it's not so thick), or make it the same way and use it as a gravy.  Thanks for the great inspiration.

This is okay, not spectacular,but okay.  Even after using rosemary instead of thyme, it was still mediocore in taste.  In needs something... but I can't say what.  After pouring over my chicken with pasta, I had to add extra S&P and parmesean cheese...in excess of what should have been neccessary just to "spice up" the dish. It wasn't bad...just not that good. thanks anyway.

For Dreginek to help "spice it up" a bit more you could simmer the cream with a 1/4 of a white onion, bay leaf, and one whole clove. Remove these items and then thicken w/ roux and season to taste.

This recipe was EXCELLENT and very, very easy. I followed it to a T, but after it thickened and I removed it from the stove I added some shredded white cheddar - YUM. Any time I need a white sauce for anything, this is the recipe I'll be using.

Super easy and very good sauce too! My first try ever at bechamel and it came out perfectly. I cut this in half. I used half heavy whipping cream and half 2% milk and made my own half and half. I used onion powder about 1/2 tsp instead of grated fresh. No lumps, super creamy, very rich. I used this in a chicken and pasta dish and it turned out beautiful and was so delicious. This took about 25 min total time for me, so it can't be done in a hurry like package mix and gravies can, but so worth the little extra time it takes. Thanks for the wonderful recipe, I will use this again and again now that I know how easy and foolproof this is.

I use this recipe as a basic sauce for all occasions: add blue cheese or roasted pepper (these are only examples) for a great pasta sauce, or mix left over vegetables or potatoes with it and bake in the oven for 30 minutes - makes a very tasty casserole.
I like this easy to make recipe to pep every-day meals up. I have to admit that it is a bit too bland to use it as a simple sauce over meat or potatoes - but it is very versatile if someone uses it with some ideas! Thanks for the recipe - I use it a lot! :) btw - I do not have chicken broth, chicken bouillon cubes do just fine, though. Just cut down on the extra salt.

Excellent! The chicken broth, thyme, and cayenne pepper improved the flavor of this sauce over other Bechamel sauce recipes I tried. For a more delicate, yet creamier flavor, you might want to substitute the 2 TBsp flour and 1 cup half-and-half for 1 TBsp corn starch and 1 cup table cream. Mix the corn starch with the cold cream and room-temperature chicken broth prior to adding it to the melted butter.

This was an excellent recipe.  Easy and very flavorful.  I used dried onion flakes instead of the grated onion and I only had skim milk, so I just added an extra tablespoon of flour.  Will definitely use again!

I was looking for a cloned recipe for boxed Creamy Chicken Pasta and (after pouring through tons of recipes) stumbled on this.  How simple and yet how perfect!  Made exactly as directed (only halved for just the 2 of us) and then tossed hot linguini with the bechamel sauce.  Absolutely outstanding!  I felt the spices were dead on.  Thank you so much for recipe!

I think this is an excellent version of bechamel. Prior to this recipe I'd never tried one that included chicken broth, which lightens up the calories a bit, but I discovered I quite liked it. I wrote down the stovetop method (and that's what I used) but the recipe doesn't instruct you to use any of the seasonings if you follow those directions so be sure to write down ALL the ingredients. Mine came out fine because I was adding a different seasoning anyway. I would also advise you NOT to add all the cold liquid at once -- that's the best way known to make lumpy sauces/gravies. Instead add a bit, whisk it smooth, then add a bit more, whisk again, etc. til you've added it all. Thanks for the recipe! P.S. I tested this recipe with fat-free half & half and it came out great. You could make this with skim milk too, just cook and stir til it reaches the right thickness.

Actually, this was a great sauce.  I added sauteed mushrooms & peas in butter and tossed in fresh parley in the end. Great last minute dish!

This is a good basic recipe. The flavour is very delicate so if you like stronger flavour, add more seasoning. I like it as is because it can be used in many different ways without being overpowering. I like it tossed with cooked penne or rotini, frozen peas & cubed ham then topped with cheese and baked in a casserole until bubbly. Even the pickiest eaters will like this!

This is an excellent Bechamel sauce recipe. Please keep in mind that bechamel is a basic sauce meant to be customized. Want less fat, use milk and broth, want a creamier, richer sauce, use cream or half & half. It can be used for savory and for sweet. Season to taste. This sauce made a wonderful base for mac & cheese as well as, a delightful creamed soup base. The possibilities are endless.

This is a great basic recipe. It can be spiced up by simply adding your favorite spices. I always use this recipe, i try different spices and different cheeses. Great recipe. I prefer my onion finely chopped.

I have never written a review, but felt compelled to write after tasting this amazing sauce!  I absoutely LOVE pasta dishes, but am not a fan of alfredo sauce and quite honestly am getting tired of the red sauces as well, so I'm always looking for something new.  After reading the recipe, I thought I'd give it a try, afterall, most of the ingredients are things I have already!  I didn't have any half and half, so I substituted with 1 cup of skim milk, nor did I have white pepper, so I substitued with black pepper.  I did think that 3/4 tsp black pepper was too much though.  I used the microwave to make it and it was quick and easy with no mess either!!  Overall, this sauce was great, and I will be making it again!

This was a really easy recipe.  I used it for Valentine's Day over homemade, heart-shaped, meat ravioli.  As suggested by a prior review, I used rosemary instead of thyme as I'm not a huge thyme fan anyway.  I uses dried chopped onions because when I opened my drawer all of the onions were rotten.  That was a good substitute but I would suggest using only 1 T. if using the dried.  Very tasty!  I will definitely be making this again.

Used this for a quick pasta sauce on portebello mushroom ravioli.  Worked great, will definately make this again.  Made it with what I had on hand: chicken broth from cube, 2% milk, dried onion flakes and it was plenty good.  Husband tossed a little parmesan cheese in his.

Good sauce however, substituted thyme with 1 large bay leaf (thyme can be overpowering for some dishes) and the broth/half-and-half with 2 cups whole milk. Omitted salt (used salted butter) and made a light blonde rue with the butter and flour, created just a bit more character.  This recipe is a great starting point for many other sauces.  With the addition of other herbs/spices/cheeses you can go to mornay sauce, bernaise sauce and many ohters.

YUM!  Great basic recipe.  I made almost as written except I used garlic powder instead of grated onion and didn't realize I bough 99% fat free broth so I added a chicken boullion cube too.  Used it in a spinach/sausage white lasagna and it was FABULOUS.  Everyone loved it.  Will definately make again and again.

Super easy to make.  I used it as the base for a turkey pot pie to use up leftovers from Thanksgiving.  So good.

Loved the recipe...great over tortellini...used nutmeg instead of the pepper and it was a sure classic.

Great recipe!  I've made it a couple of times and it's turned out great both times.  I never have half-and-half, so I use 1/2 c. heavy cream and 1/2 c. skim milk and it turns out wonderfully.  I also use black pepper instead of white.    Last time I added in some red bell pepper and red onion I cooked with no oil on a nonstick skillet, and it turned out very pretty and tasted great!

i took the advice of another reviewer and used a bouillion with 2 cups of milk, simply because it seemed easier and we never buy cream in our house.  it turned out perfectly.

Excellent recipe, I also followed the advise from another user to use one more teaspoon of skim milk since that's what I had and it turned out perfect. I used the Bechamel to make my Tuna Crepes and it was a success.

cheap simple ingredients, relatively easy/painless, and pretty tasty - since i'm a college student in the middle of midterms, this really turned out to be a great recipe. though some said that the sauce was bland, mine turned out well. i substituted black pepper for the white and cayenne (because we didn't have any in our kitchen) and i didn't have any thyme, but all in all it tasted great. my only problem with it is that the recipe doesn't make all that much sauce - i made "24 servings", but after a couple friends and i had seconds, the sauce pot was near empty. maybe i let it get too thick.

This recipe was really good, we made it with portabella mushrooms.  The kids, which are teenagers also liked it.
I will try it with chicken and shrimp in the future.

Nice! Mine was little on the thin side, so next time I would add another tablespoon of flour and that should do the trick. Great flavor! Thanks for sharing. :)

I've been using this recipe as my Go To basic Bechamel Sauce for any other recipe that requires Bechamel.  It's simple to make and has the consistency and delicate taste that I was searching for.  I've tried others but in the end I always come back to this one.  Thanks Holly for sharing!!

This is a great recipe! i usually use milk instead of cream and it's just as successful. i also added some garlic. i used it as the sauce for my creamy scallop potatoes. Sliced potatoes, bechamel sauce and topped with cheese and a sprinkle of paprika. i sometimes grate the onion into the sauce or put sliced onions between the potato slices (depending if i have to hide the onions from the kids or not)

Yum! I followed another reviewer's suggestion and used 2 cups of milk and a boullion cube instead of the chicken broth and half and half. Made mine on the stovetop.  Didn't have thyme, so I used a dash of Italian seasoning. Used onion powder instead of grated onion. Served it on butternut squash ravioli I bought from Costco. Turned out really well! My husband loved it. Tasted just like Lean Cuisine butternut squash ravioli I love. Coulda used some chopped up walnuts in it & it would have been exactly the same. Thanks for the recipe. Will definitely make again!

I gave this recipe 5 stars because it is a great BASE recipe. I'm not sure how it taste as is but when I made the recipe with all the said ingredients plus a bunch of other ingredients that I love to use and that suited the dish (chicken cordon bleu), it turned out fabulously. I think this base recipe would be very hard to mess up, especially if you taste while making every once and a while. Some ideas (what I added) would be.... some cream of chicken soup, diced fresh red bell pepper, dried basil, fresh rosemary, few teaspoons of sourcream, few tablespoons of white or red cooking wine, few cloves of sauteed minced fresh garlic, a little cumin and some dried or fresh parsley. Just a few ideas of what you can add to this sauce (just add amounts and ingredients according to your personal  taste) to make it customized and fabulous! Be creative!

Delicious, easy, and absolutely wonderful to top off any pasta. This recipe can be used on tortellini, or your average angel hair, ravioli- or my favorite- smothering fresh cannelloni. I highly recommend trying this recipe!

Very good flavor...not onion-y at all.  Didn't thicken up very well but was perfect for 1 1/2 pounds of penne pasta with the Costco Amylu (brand) Mango Chicken sausages.  And didn't heat up the kitchen on this hot summer night because I poured the pasta water over the sliced sausages and then poured the hot sauce over all.  Yum!

This was pretty good, but I did change afew things:  One must was nutmeg - I probably added about 1-2 tsp.  Another was 1/2 c. parmesan cheese.  More salt and pepper than the recipe stated as well.

This was really good with seafood ravioli. I added a pinch of basil and a pinch of oregano. Next time I might add a bit more of those and skip the thyme.

This is absolutely my favourite bechamel sauce. I use it with any "au gratin", with pasta and in lasagna. I didn't have half and half and didn't like the idea of chicken broth making my sauce brown, so I used 2 cups of milk instead. I also added the seasoning in while it was cooking, and it was so good that I do it that way every time. I also add some grated cheddar cheese in the end when I use it in an "au gratin". DELICIOUS!

My husband prefers white sauce over red so I decided to try to make it from scratch and this recipe was super easy!  I used 2 cups of half and half (I was trying to use it up), cornstarch instead of flour and a bouillion cube, plus I didn't have grated onion so I used a dash of garlic powder instead.  It was still a bit on the bland side for me so I added about 1/2 cup of sundried tomatoes that I had.  I poured it over Four Cheese Ravioli from Costco and my husband loved it.  I will definitely use this as the base to most of my white sauces in the future.

In a Bechamel Sauce the actual dairy ingredient is milk but using half and half is a not too bad idea. Only thing I wouldn't put in is dried thyme, ground cayenne pepper, and chicken broth

I must admit this recipe is good but for those who are just making it let me make a few adjustment: Add a little more salt and cannye pepper to the recipe to accrie your taste. Use two pinches of thyme. You can use any kind of milk but just add a little more flour. This recipe definently has POTENIAL!!!

I made this sauce 3 times so far. The first two times I made it for a fish gratin:  i used fish stock and did not use the recommended seasonings, using, instead, onion powder (didn't used real onions) and garlic powder. This time I'm making chicken pot pie with it and I doubled the recipe, using half chicken stock and half vegetable stock and again using different seasonings: onion powder, garlic powder, and parsley.

This sauce was absolutely delicious! I have tried some sauces from allrecipes, only to be very disappointed. This time, I was just the opposite. The sauce was very flavourful. I added another tbsp or two of flour to thicken it some more, and as recommended I used Rosemary. I also added a pinch of onion salt. The results were more than satisfying.

The microwave version is easy and turned out great! I added a clove of crushed garlic about  4 minutes into cooking time. I served the sauce over chicken ravioli and topped it with freshly grated parmesan.

I made this in order to help with some chicken I had made yesterday and put a bit too much spice in! I used chicken broth, half and half, flour, onion powder, garlic powder, and ditalini pasta as well as the aforementioned chicken. I feel that this recipe was great inspiration and it turned what ended up falling far below the mark with how much spice I added to it yesterday and this something that was really really good today!

I would have loved this recipe if not for the strong taste of onion. I used red onion and it really over powered the rest of the flavors. I sauced it over my fried pork chops it was a so-so. Maybe, I'll omit the onion and replace it with garlic and mushroom next time. Overall, it is a great white sauce base without the onion. 
P. S. I'm a little biased here as I'm not a fan of onion. lol

Good recipe for a white sauce and you don't have Parmesan cheese in your fridge. Omitted half the butter for olive oil and instead flour I used 2 egg yolks for the amount of Flour needed.  I read half-half used regular milk and sour cream (added honey to cut acidity).  Came out really tasty and creamy enough

Good base recipe. I added a lot more seasoning than called for an probably could have used more. I used Lactaid and cornstarch instead of half and half. It got pretty thick so next time I'll ease up on the cornstarch. I'll use this base again for sure.

I used the stove method.  It was a little loose at the end so i thickened it with a teaspoon of cornstarch mixed with some water.  It turned out perfect.  I served it over spaghetti and my kids loved it.  We ate left overs 4 times during the week!  Needless to say, we made a lot.

I love, love, love this sauce.  I use it in lasagna dishes along with my ricotta,  diced chicken and artichoke hearts, I've used it with Penne and melted a few ounces of gorgonzola and chopped walnuts.  I've even used it for Mac & Cheese by melting a little cheddar with it and adding a cup of chopped fresh cooked lobster.  This can be a wonderful base sauce for your favorite "white" pasta dishes.

I made this sauce for my salmon pie. Made it exactly as written. Very nice creamy texture and the taste adds to my salmon pie.  I am very happy with this recipe. I did add to the sauce ,some cut up hard boiled eggs and 2 tablespoons of chopped pimentos, which gave it color and a old fashion flavor memory for me.  You won't be disappointed using this recipe.

Just made this and it turned out really well.  Not too heavy, but still rich in flavor.  I did add some garlic and because I made it for a carbonara dish, I also added a cup of shredded parmesan and romano cheese.  That really kicked it up a notch.  I just found my new recipe for white sauce :)

Our family really enjoyed this. I appreciated how easy it was to make.

I chose to use the stovetop method.  The changes that I made were these:  1) Instead of grating the onion, I minced it to maintain the full flavor and used 3 Tbsp instead of two.  2) Then I melted only 1/2 of the butter in the pan and sautéed the onions in that.  Then I tossed in the other half of the butter and let that melt before adding the flour.  3)  I didn't have half-n-half or cream on hand, so I used 1 C. Of 2% milk and an extra tablespoon of butter (I added the milk and butter at the same time and didn't bother softening or melting the pat in advance.) 

And finally--not really a change to the sauce recipe, but rather a "serving suggestion"--I stirred last night's leftover, baked salmon (flaked) into the sauce about 1 minute prior to serving it all over linguine. Delicious!

Flavourful recipe.  I did use just milk instead of the broth/half-half combination, an added a small teaspoon of chicken stock powder.  It is easily altered to give whatever flavor you would like.  It thickened easily and as expected, which I really like.  It means the proportions of butter, flour and liquid are accurate.  Would happily keep using!

The onions just were horrible. I never use them in my sauce.  And instead of the thyme or rosemary.. try a little sweet basil. Just a little or you'll overpower it.. it's light and creamy and for what I use it for mostly, is a Alfredo sauce

Needed a sauce quick and easy for our mixed vegetables, and this was it.  Start to finish took about 15 minutes.  Great texture and great flavor.  Cut the recipe in half, used minced onions, 1 cup skim milk with 2tsp. chicken bouillon powder.  This recipe is a keeper for sure.

I loved this. I made it for my family for my fathers' birthday tonight. I added some garlic and herbs and used cereal cream instead of half and half. I ended serving it on fettucine with asparagus, and baked, seasoned chicken on the side. Delicious!

I just made this and modified adding baby bella mushrooms and doing half broth/half white wine.  I had grilled chicken breasts and asparagus, cut up to small bite pieces and put over pasta.  Topped with some grumbled gorgonzola and sun-dried tomatoes - WOW!  Fantizimo!  Tasted fresh out of restaurant in Italy.    Very easy recipe to modify and my guests were in Aww.   Try it!

I didn't have any chicken broth so I used 2 tomato/chicken bullion cubes instead and added some italian seasoning. I used it on whole wheat linguine;it was great! Oh, also used whole wheat flour and fat-free half & half because that's all I had in the fridge.

Wonderful sauce. I have used it for many different dishes and it always tastes great.  A little lighter but very yummy bechamel sauce.

It was just OKAY for us. We do like our foods more spicy and I tried to spice it up more, but with very little success. I actually added 4 pinches of ground red pepper and a dash of liquid shrimp boil. I added chicken and sliced red/green peppers. These peppers were the best part of the dish. My try using as a base and making major alterations for the next time, but will not make as called for in this recipe...too bland for us.

I needed this for a cod fish casserole dish and it was good.  I did add about 1/4 cup of italian shredded cheese blend when it was done and some dried parsley with the dried thyme.  I also omitted the cayenne pepper.  But this is a great basic recipe.  Thank you!

Excellent!  I added a little bit of cornstarch dissolved in water because it wasn't thick enough.  The cayenne pepper gives this sauce a nice touch!

Lacks flavor, although great for those who want to expirement.  Add some spice, add some whine, and add some grated cheese when cooking up.  I experimented with wine and fresh herbs.

Great!  This recipe makes approximately 1.5 C.  I used fat free half and half and fat free chicken broth and it still tasted rich and creamy.  I wasn't sure what "grated onion" was, so I used one finely chopped green onion.  I also used regular pepper.

This was very simple to prepare.  I added a little chedder cheese, which I know is not the traditional Bechamel however, I thought the kids would enjoy it better this way.  Served over "Poulet Au Saucisse" from this site.  It was the perfect complement.

Liked this. First time making a Bechamel sauce. Used onion powder instead of grated. Added a few extra seasonings. I plan on finding other recipes that I can use this sauce with.

Thank you so much for this recipe!  It was awesome :)  I am living in Bhutan now where I cannot get a majority of food & spice items, and I was still able create this and make it “vegetarian”.  After over 2 months without any good pasta, I was ecstatic to find this, although I had to make a few modifications…  First I don’t like onions and did not have onion powder, so just used an onion oil flavored packet from a packet of noodles similar to Ramen.  Second, I didn’t have actual chicken broth but made it with 1 ½ chicken “flavored” bouillon cubes.  I didn’t have the pepper or thyme, but the “chicken” bouillon gave it plenty of flavor and I added a pinch of chili pepper flakes and 2 gloves crushed garlic after a few minutes of cooking.  I replaced the half and half with canned low fat cream.  Finally, I added a bag of sautéed fresh local mushrooms to the sauce before it was done thickening and cooked for some time, then served over tri-colored rotini-like pasta.  My fiancé (who usually likes only traditional Bhutanese food) and I both loved it!  I will be making this again today and many, many more times!  Will probably double the sauce next time if I hope to have any leftovers…

excellent sauce, put it over pasta as a side dish and it was very good. just what I wanted, creamy sauce without the cheesy flavor of alfredo sauces. I would suggest adding an extra tablespoon of flour or add alittle cornstarch, as it didn't thicken enough for my liking.

I really liked this sauce.  I followed the directions, except I halved the recipe.  I addred some sauteed mushrooms to the sauce and LOVED it.  I recommend this recipe to everyone.  I placed cooked pasta and placed grilled chicken and poured the sauce over the top.  It was delish!!!

Beautiful.

This recipe was quick, easy, and included very simple, handy ingredients. I think the serving sizes are a little skewed, but nothing a little fiddling can't fix. 

I honestly can't wait to make it again.

This was a really tasty sauce. I made it with 2% milk instead of cream for a lower fat version. I had to add cornstarch to thicken it up but it was good. I'm sure I'll use it again.

This is a GREAT Sauce. we used Rosemary instead of Thyme and it was excellent!!
