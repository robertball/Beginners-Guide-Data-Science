I made some changes to this recipe,
I used 1 c. walnuts
1 1/4 c. flour
1/2 c. brown sugar
1/2 c. butter flavored crisco (I didn't have butter)
1/2 c. coconut
for the filling I used 2 8oz. pkgs cream cheese
2/3 c. sugar
2 eggs
2 tsp. vanilla
1 can of cherry pie filling
for the crust I combined flour, brown sugar and cut in the crisco, then added the nuts and coconut, reserving 1/2 c. of this mixture for the top. pressed remaining into a buttered 9x13 pan. and bake for 12 to 15 minutes, then beat the cream cheese, eggs, sugar and vanilla until smooth and spread over the hot crust, bake for another 15 minutes, top with the cherry pie filling and reserved topping and return to oven and bake for another 15 minutes.  It's delicious and is enough for a big crowd. everytime I make it I goes fast.

This is definitely a keeper.  I doubled the cream cheese mixture so the filling would be thicker.  They taste like cheesecake.  I might try another topping next time as well, but then again, I might not.  I love cherries on cheesecake... so why change?

Another KEEPER, I made it in a 7x12 pan and the bottom crust was just fine. I will do as one other person said and use blueberries for topping, just for a change.

This is a qick, tasty dessert.  We liked it best served "as is" with no extra ice cream or whipped cream.  Try blueberry pie filling for a change.

This was very tasty. I used pecans instead because I do not care for walnuts too much. Yum yum!

The crust amount needs to be doubled in order to cover the bottom of the pan, and sprinkle on top.  I also doubled the cream cheese portion.  Very good flavor with the walnuts.

This was pretty good. If I made it again I would do it in an 8x8 dish instead of the 9x13. I thought it was too thin. I would also maybe try it with pecans instead of walnuts, because I find walnuts a little bitter.

I've been looking everywhere for this recipe. A co-worker of mine made it several years ago and just wouldn't give up the recipe but kept saying how simple it was.....so glad you posted it! Thanks!
Even people that claim not to like coconut - love this dish!

This is fantastic!  I made in in a 9X9 pan.  I think a 9X13 might thin it out too much.  We ate it warm and it was delicious.

A Delight indeed! Actually I liked it warm more than cool - we ate it straight from the pan, it smelled so irresistible. Definetely will make more and more.

My mom used to make this years ago and I always loved it. I still have her hand-written recipe but it is quite faded and worn. I wanted to make this again and thought I'd search for it online to see if anyone else had this delicious recipe. Lo and behold, here it is!

I only have one suggestion... Although it calls for one cup of walnuts, I would recommend using 1/2 cup of coarsely chopped walnuts and 1/2 cup of finely chopped. There is a difference. If you take a half-cup of whole walnuts and chop them finely, you will get quite a bit less than if you use a half-cup of already finely chopped.

My mouth is watering just thinking about this dessert. It is nutty, buttery, crunchy, sweet and absolutely delicious. Thanks so much for posting!

Delicious! Changes I made: 8 x 8 glass pan; almond meal/flour (Bob's Red Mill) in place of all-purpose flour; half walnuts/half pecans (ran out of walnuts); 2 cups pitted fresh cherries (well, fresh-picked, frozen, defrosted in fridge). Can't stop eating it! Excited to take it to a potluck soon!

Made this for my husband and we both loved it.  I am not one for canned cherry pie filling, but this changed my mind. Thanks for sharing this recipe!  It's a keeper in my recipe box!

This recipe was great! I accidentally messed up on the crust by melting the butter, but it tasted great anyway!  I also didn't sprinkle the crust on top but sprinkled coconut instead. Two Thumbs Up!!!

Sharing this with ice cream and whipped cream at singles game night.
Love the ingredients. I used 1/2 gluten free and 1/2 cake flour but increased the total flour by 1/2 cup. Added cinnamon and nutmeg.

Added 1 tsp to 1.5 tsp of baking cocoa to cream cheese. 

Smells great. Wish I had made it for Sunday's open house. The house smells wonderful.
