1/2 cup of oil seemed like a lot to me, so I just used enough to coat the bottom of the pan, sauteed the onion/garlic, then added a little more before adding the mushroom and thyme.  Serve with brown rice, it was delicious!

This had good flavors but the store didn't have very good broccoli rabe or any broccolini so I used what they had but I felt like it was lacking because of this. I will try again with some good rabe or broccolini next time as again I felt the flavor was good.

I'm not one of those Italians who I hear considers broccoli rabe beloved, but preparing it like this could make me change my tune.  To temper its bitterness I added some chopped red bell pepper which introduced some nice color too.  For a little kick I added a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes.  Use olive oil as needed; I'm sure it was difficult for the submitter to come up with a precise, one-size-fits-all amount when he wrote the recipe.  I served this topped with beautiful seared dry-pack scallops.

very tasty, I had to cook the mushrooms on medium though to get them done, maybe I chopped them too large

I made a half recipe and used broccolini because that's what I had on hand. I steamed it for 10 min and then transferred to a bowl of very cold water to stop the cooking and to keep the broccolini a bright green color. The stems were still fairly hard, but I went with that. In place of the portobellos I used white mushrooms and also added a pinch of red pepper flakes. I will make this again using the broccoli rabe! Thanks for the great recipe Miko!

I agree....a little too much oil, but definitely a great way to prepare broccoli rabe. I found adding some sliced cherry tomatoes just before serving was rather nice. Of course, everyone will have their own twist on how to add to this recipe, but I'll use this as my basic recipe from now on.

Just used broccoli and ran out of fresh garlic and onion so used dried.   I prefer fresh.  In the end I added a bit of water to steam the broccoli a bit.   Took longer than I expected to finish.  Oh forgot the cheese. Didnâ€™t need it.

Yummy!  Didn't use nearly the amt of oil called for, used baby bella mushrooms and Pampered chef rosemary seasoning salt.  Good side dish meal to accompany fresh bass (fish) and toasted Udi's bread.

Delish! Cooked with way less oil and used Avocado oil instead. I added some red peppers and tomatoes served on some black bean spaghetti topped with parmesan cheese. I like it spicy so included hot peppers as well. You can get pretty creative with this. enjoy

This was great as a side dish for Easter dinner.  I never had it with mushrooms, so this was a nice change that did temper the bitterness.  Would make again, as is.

I really enjoyed the flavor. I didn't add quite as much oil as recommended but used what I knew we would like. I also added a few dashes of red pepper flake and a splash of white wine while cooking. Oh, and used a Romano and Parmesan combo. It came out wonderfully.

This is a wonderful variation for broccoli rabe.  I will add more garlic and onion the next time I make it, but I do like the light quality that steaming brings to the broccoli rabe.  Will make this again and again.

Used baby bellas instead and added red pepper.  Definitely a fun, delicious combination to go with broccoli rabe.  I liked it better than the plain garlic and olive oil version.
