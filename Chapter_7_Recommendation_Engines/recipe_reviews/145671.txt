I'm rating this 5 stars IF you reduce the amount of mayo by half.  I rinsed the artichoke hearts & the pimintoes separately under cold water to get rid of any excess salt.  You should make sure they're drained well so the dip isn't watery.  I substituted 1 tsp garlic powder for the diced garlic.  Finally I didn't bother with the tomato & scallion garnish, although I'm sure it would have added some nice color.  The main point though is that I doubled the recipe (using a total of only 1 cup mayo when doubling it) & it was a huge success at a party I attended last night.  People told me it was yummy & I even was askd for the recipe.  I asked the hostess, after I told her the secret ingredient was feta) whether she thought it might be better with a garlic & herb feta or a tomato & basil flavored one.  She said it was perfect the way it was.

This didn't work for me , I am not sure if I did something wrong but the consistency was too runny for my liking. The flavors should have done great together so perhaps I will try it again.

I made this dip for a family BBQ.  It was a big hit!!! I only had an 8x8 baking dish, so I did have to bake the dip a few minutes longer, and needed to broil it for a few minutes to brown the top. I can't wait to make this again!

Great!  Did use a can of Rotel tomatoes with green chiles (mild) & mixed in with the other ingredients prior to making instead of putting tomatoes on top.

I took this to a New Year's eve party and it was awesome!  It's a nice change from the regular hot artichoke dip everyone else serves.

I had to take this dish away from my Thanksgiving guests. I truly think that they would have made a dinner out of it!

Delicious; a recipe to try, also to share.

Okay, but too rich for me.  I used light mayo but 1 cup may be overkill.  Also, I left out the pimentos and gr. onions b/c I did not have them on hand.  I will stick to regular artichoke dip.  I was hoping the feta would make it taste greek but it just made it really salty.

This was REALLY good.  I made a few of my own additions...I threw in a cup of sour cream and added 1/2 c shredded swiss to the mix and omitted the tomatoes.  It got RAVE reviews!  The feta really adds a nice touch.

Just made this for a party. It was gone before I could even take a taste! Everyone loved it and kept  asking for the recipe. I made it exactly except I left out the pimientos and  I used 3/4 c. mayo instead of a full cup.

This recipe is my old stand-by for parties -- simple, quick, delicious. I've found there's no need to grease the pan: the dip actually gets a little oily if you do. Drain the artichokes and pimentos well. And you can substitute jarred roasted red peppers for the pimentos if you like -- a little less expensive, ounce for ounce. Just chop them to pimento size.

This is excellent. I made it exactly as instructed and wouldn't change a thing (although I did use fat free mayo...) I served this app for a birthday dinner and everyone loved it- I will definitely make this one again.

This was soooo good.  Added extra tomato & green onions, so every bite would have some.  I like extra garlic, put additional cloves in.  Served with endives & crackers, everyone used the endives.  Not a good ideal to serve before dinner, will eat too much of this dip & then you're too full for dinner.  Perfect for an appetizer only party.

Great recipe. It was a hit at Easter dinner. I only added one garlic clove, in order to perserve everyone's breath while visiting. The dip still had plenty of flavour without it!

Amazing. I loved it. My husband who hates feta cheese loved this too. Artichoke dip normaly makes my stomach hurt because of the fat in the cheese. This dip didn't upset my stomach since it uses feta.

This is great!  Next time I will experiment with lower fat mayo and feta, to see if I can get a good result that is not such a calorie bomb!

I loved this. I took it to a New Years party and it was a hit. I took it one step further, because I like to play with recipes and added a half a jor of sliced calamata olives, so it had a definate greek taste and I served it with a thinly sliced sour dough baguette

I only gave 4 stars because I made a change to it. It was a little too tart for me so I added one pkg of cream cheese, I would definitely do this again, all my co-worker were asking for the recipe.

This is an excellent dip.  The feta gives it a salty tangy taste.  I reduced the mayo to 1/2 cup and added 1 Tbsp of lemon juice and 1 tsp of fresh ground black pepper.  It was a hit but like other reviewers have mentioned, it is very rich.

3 1/2 stars if allowed. Quite good but very, very rich. Too rich for me really. Too filling for an appetizer, more suited to a gathering with finger foods. Perhaps with less parmesan it would be better.

This dip was a hit at Easter dinner!!  Made a few changes...Did 1/2c of sour cream and 1/2c of mayo, added a sprinkle more feta and parm (exact measurements aren't my strong suit lol) And added some extra garlic, just because I love it!  I also made sure to give the pimentos and artichokes a real good cold water rinse and drained them well before adding them in...all in all, an absolutely delicious dip that I will make again!!  Maybe add some crab???...

Doubled the recipe using only 1 cup of mayo total as other reviews suggested.  Baked it in a 9x13 casserole dish and then another 4 minutes under the broiler to brown the top a bit.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  Even with only 1 cup of mayo it is really rich, but tasty -- a little bit goes a long way.  It was a hit at our gathering.  Maybe try it with non-fat greek yogurt instead of mayo for a lighter version.

Very good, very easy!  I also subbed 1/2 Cup low fat sour cream for part of the Mayo.  I used a little more garlic too--because I really like garlic.  I used an 8x8" pan, so I cooked it for 30 minutes, then broiled it for a couple minutes to brown the top some.  Before baking, I decorated the top with cherry tomatoes split into fours to look like flowers and chives cut length-wise to look like flower stems.  I sprinkled the chopped scallions around the rest of the top.  It was a very pretty and tasty presentation!

Delicious Dip. I have taken this to multiple potlucks and its always well received. The ingredients are a little pricy with the feta and parmesan.

Fabulous!! Devoured at a family party! Used a 6oz pkg of feta. Everything else was exactly as recipe stated.

Reallly good, I subbed in some yogurt and light sour cream for half of the mayonaise, and I used light mayonaise.  I only used about six ounces of feta because that's what i had. Also mixed in some chopped fresh basil because I had some. This is good because doesn't have the cringey greasy over rich taste of some of these dips.

Great flavor from the Feta!  I did cut down on the Mayo and also broiled it for about 3 min so the top would brown.  Super easy, def a keeper!

Wow.  This is just excellent.  And easy!  I cut the mayo to 3/4 cup (after reading other reviews).  We topped with tomato and green onion and also chopped jalapeno.  Deelish!  Thank you for posting this- this is a keeper :)

This tastes great and is super easy to make. Next time I am going to rinse the artichoke hearts, to cut down on the oil, and I will try to remember the tomato and green onion!

OK, I can't lie, I had so few of the ingredients listed!  But, I stuck to the main idea...  I didn't have enough feta so I traded out some feta and some of the mayo for cream cheese, and I didnt have the pimento and the diced tomato... so I sauteed onion and red bell and added sun dried tomato paste...  but it was really good.  I meant to serve it as a started before dinner with black corn chips... but they ate all of it and just picked at dinner!

I added crab and did not cook it because that wasn't an option. I let it marinate overnight then served it in a bread bowl. I also used half mayo half sour cream. I perhaps could have added a bit more sour cream as it was very thick from sitting overnight. It went over very well

Just delicious!  I usually use 1/2 mayo & 1/2 Greek yogurt, and mix the tomatoes & scallions right in before baking.  Everyone loves this:)

This was very good.  I upped the cheeses and had to broil the top to get it to brown.  Didn't really need the green onions and tomato.  I bet it'd be great with crab!

This was great! I only used half the mayo and it came out wonderfully. I made the whole recipe even though it says it will serve 18 and 5 of us at it all! Thanks for the great dip!
