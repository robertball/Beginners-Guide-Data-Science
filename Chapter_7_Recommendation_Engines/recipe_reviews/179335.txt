This is so refreshing! I used a juice blend of pineapple, orange, & strawberry and it was delicious.  Make sure to get 100% fruit juice and not some sugar coated punch.

This doesn't taste anything like a rum runner.  It isn't bad but it tastes like bubble gum and I wanted it to taste like a real rum runner!

This was okay as written.  If I made it again as written I would not make a frozen drink out of it.  I think it diluted it too much and there wasnt much flavor.  After blending I had to add extra orange juice and a splash of pineapple to give it some flavor and then it was good.  It tasted similar to a bubblegum flavor and not like a rum runner.  I will make again but without the blender next time and just serve it over crushed ice.  I think it will make a great drink over ice.
