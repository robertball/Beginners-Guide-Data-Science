I made this recipe for my family for dinner one night and it was awful. It was really thick and took MUCH longer to cook than I had anticipated. Overall, I was very disappointed and we did not have a good dinner that night.

My family loved this recipe but I did make my own homemade sauce with just a quick rue and added some freshly grated parmesean. I probably made the sauce thinner than the jar sauce.  I left out the onions.  There was not a leftover in sight.  You could add some extra milk to thin out the jar sauce but I cooked chicken, tortellini and made my sauce all at once - very easy and quick!

This was very good!  Our family doesn't like jar sauce so I chose to use the Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce from this site!  When I served it with veggies (yellow squash, broccoli and red peppers) most of the family mixed it all together.  YUM!

Really delicious recipe, one suggestion would be to thin out the sauce with some skim milk...makes the sauce last longer since you don't need the whole jar, and it is not as thick. I'm a college student cooking for one, and this is a good one to cut down for just one person!
