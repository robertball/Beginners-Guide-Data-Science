I really liked this recipe!  The balsamic gives it just the right flavor. Instead of drizzling the oil and balsamic over the potatoes, I poured them into a gallon size ziploc bag and shook the cut up potatoes in the bag to coat well. Then I baked them in the oven at about 420 for 30-40 minutes. I will be making these regularly as they go very well with steak!

This is a great recipe!  I chopped some onion and cooked it in butter instead of using onion powder, and used a good aged balsamic vinegar.  As my husband and I are  trying to stick with a low sodium diet, I did not add any salt.  The flavour of the onion and balsamic definitely gave this recipe the kick it needed!

These are quick and easy to make while I'm grilling burgers or steak. 50% of my kids like them, too. That's a win for our family!

Second time giving it a try.  Find the balsamic a bit overpowering.

So good! I did not follow the recipe exactly. I had no onion powder, used more olive oil (I don’t like to measure), and totally forgot to add the butter. I was really worried the potatoes would simply steam in the packet on the grill instead of get the delicious crispy bits they get in the oven, but I did not need to worry. They came out perfectly done with tons of flavor and crispy bits. I will absolutely make these again exactly the way I did. I didn’t feel I was missing anything without the onion powder or butter.

Next time I will be adding tons more vinegar, we honestly couldn't tell that I used any.

Followed the recipe. It was ok. Nothing to make me want to prepare the potatoes again this way.
