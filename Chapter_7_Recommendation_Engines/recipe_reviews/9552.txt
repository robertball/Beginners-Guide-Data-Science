I have been making this recipe for years and everyone absolutely loves it! I have altered slightly over the years and personally love to add cinnamon -- it's always a big hit and provides just a bit more flavor.

Wonderful stuff--a big pay off for little effort! Pretty, delicately sweet, and pleasantly crusty and crispy.  I added 1 tsp. of cinnamon to the sugar and was very pleased with the result. Watch these closely as they bake--I found I didn't need as much time as the recipe directs!

These need to be baked for about 1/2 the time.  They were delicious but a little overbaked.  Next time I will make sure to bake them for just 15 minutes.

These Bites are sooo yummy but very addictive. Not too healthy either. They are so good they should be made year round. Very easy.

My husband really liked these but the kids didn't like it and I tried to like it but couldn't. They weren't bad but they were extremely rich and maybe I am not a pecan person. Because they are so rich, I can't imagine eating more than a couple at a time.

These are VERY good & my family really enjoyed them. I added a dash of cinnamon to the sugar before adding the pecans. No complaints. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 ONLY because my grandmother's recipe is still the very best in my opinion, and I haven't found it yet. Will keep trying, and will make these & tweak them until I'm 100% sure they're as close to grandma's as I can find.  :o)

I have been making these for the last 4 years.  Anyone who likes pecans LOVES this recipe!  These are good as a snack or added to salads.  I have had lots of friends and family members over the years ask me to bring these to get togethers.  This will continue to be a staple for me over the holidays.

Yummy!!! I've been making these for three years for my family and friends. Everyone that has had them becomes addicted to them, to the point that they request them repeatedly.  I highly recommend them.

This is an old family favorite but to add a little flavor around the holidays we add a bit of cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice and a small touch of clove. Tastes just like little bites of pumpkin pie. They're great!

My family really loved these.  I made enough to take it to two different holiday meals on thanksgiving and I had no leftovers.  Not to mention, it's a nice aroma in the air in the morning!

This is a favorite recipe of mine - I looked for ages to find it and finally found this one last year. I made it for my co-workers last Christmas and they reminded me to make it again this year. Thumbs up!

Wsa trying to replicate some vanilla coated pecans I had at a ZestFest this past weekend so I added vanilla extract. I lined my baking sheet w/ parchment paper before melting the butter & clean-up was a breeze. These were good but not quite what I was looking for. My hubby loves them though & I know my father will enjoy them....thanks!

I have made this every Thanksgiving for the past few years and my family LOVES it!  I serve it with the appetizers, while everyone is waiting for the Turkey.  It is always gone before the day is over!  I thoroughly recommend this recipe – the nuts are highly addictive.

These didn't turn out well at all for me.  I cooked them for the time specified and they ended up crispy and burnt tasting (although they smelled great while they were baking!).

THESE ARE SO GOOD!  Last year I made these and took them to a Christmas party for a Chinese Christmas present thing we did...They were fought over and kept on getting stolen.  I just made them again for this Christmas and I need to go buy more pecans they are so stinking good!
Also I cooked them exactly as stated (except I roasted mine at a higher temp accidentally) and mine didn't burn at all. Every time I have made them they haven't burnt, you do have to make sure you give them a good stir every 10 minutes.  I have also used 2 totally different ovens (I got a new one in April) and yet never had a problem.

I just made the "FROSTED PECAN RECIPE" and I think that I may have a soulution to making sure that the recipe doesnt burn when your trying to bake it in the oven, you can always try soaking the pecans in water before going ahead with the origanal recipe. Or if you find anouther liqid like water, with taste and do the same then you may be able to add a little bit of flavor to your recipe as well
