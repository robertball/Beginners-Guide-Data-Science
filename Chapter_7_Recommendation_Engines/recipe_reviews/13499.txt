I want to make this- but I'm confused -does anyone know if baking, do you just pour the dry mix with rice & veggies? or do you need more broth? if dry & in baking dish, how does it become moist if the broth was used for the rice?

My family LOVED the stuffing...it was our Thanksgiving hit!  I added 2 apples to the recipe.  This was the only dish that didn't have any leftovers at the end of the night!

I made this recipe for a Thanksgiving gathering of family and friends...it was a HUGE hit!  People could not get enough of it!  My husband is not a stuffing fan, but loved this.  I added 4 cups of mushrooms rather than 2, 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts, and salt.  I can't wait for Christmas to make this again!!

All I can say is...WOW!  I took a big chance with this recipe, serving it for the first time on Thanksgiving.  It got really scary when I saw ratio of celery/mushrooms/onions to stuffing...but it came through like a superstar!  I added 30% to the wild rice, and the turkey stock was "to taste"...and it was absolutely amazing.  My family absolutely loved it, and it instantly became a family classic...I'll make this recipe every thanksgiving from now on!  Thanks, Amber!!!!

Excellent!  A taste sensation for your pallet!  Used it to stuff a turkey breast then secured it with tin foil and toothpicks.  Left over amount, just wrapped it up with tinfoil and cooked with the turkey.  Also reheats great the following day.

I used Pepperidge Farms Herb cubed dressing in place of the cornbread one, and added 1 cup lightly toasted pecans.

A very tasty recipe!  I added apples and cranberries to it which I think made it even tastier.  It was a big hit on Thanksgiving and even my nieces loved it.  My husband did most of the cooking and he found this to be very easy to follow.

Tip: prepare the stuffing mix according to the instructions on the box, then mix the prepared stuffing with the drained rice, vegetables, and seasoning. Otherwise, this stuffing is really soggy.

Way too much poultry seasoning for me - think I would leave it out altogether. Also would use only half of the wild rice called for. Loved the mushrooms, celery and onion though.

This is a great recipe and easy to make. My family raved about it at the Thanksgiving table.  I did bake it outside of the turkey.  I added more broth to make it extra moist.  I also chopped the mushrooms.  Next time I may try adding oysters.

This was pretty good for my first time making stuffing... but it was a bit dry, even after I added about an extra cup of chicken stock. I'll add more next time, and also, I think it could have really used more wild rice. Great overall!

This was the first time I made real stuffing (ie. not from a box or bag.)  It turned out really delicious and I received many compliments from my extended family.  I did add a little extra rice and mushrooms, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. The rice kind of disappeared into the stuffing, which was odd.  I expected to be able to see it.  Maybe I cooked it a little too long to start with?  Anyway, it didn't poorly affect the taste at all. I will definitely make this again!

With some modifications this recipe was a HUGE hit at my holiday party.  I used Pepperidge Farm Herbed Stuffing Mix and also added apples, raisins, and toasted pecans.  It was absolutely the favorite dish on the buffet.

My sister was hestitant with my cooking the stuffing, because it did not really come out of a box. In the end, she kept asking for more. It was delicious.

The stuffing turned out very good.  However, I also found the instructions insufficient (it was my first time making stuffing) and I had to search the web beyond this recipe and sort of cobble something together.  Also, there was a huge time difference between the time alloted for cooking the wild rice in the recipe and the instructions on the wild rice container.  Do your homework and plan ahead!

I was a bit skeptical about this, but it went over great!  Made this for Thanksgiving, will do again Christmas.  In response to the person wondering about the broth, the rice doesn't nearly soak up all the broth, so you are adding the rice AND remaining broth to the stuffing.  I added pecans as well.

I have used this recipe for three Thanksgivings in a row and it is always great.  I make the recipe and separately I soak some raisons and apples in chicken stock so when I put them in with the rest of the stuffing it won't come out dry after baking.  Simply delicious!!

Everyone raved about this and said it was the best stuffing they ever ate!!!  I added more chicken stock once stuffing assembled as we don't like dry stuffing!
