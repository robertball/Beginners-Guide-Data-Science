These are AMAZING. They have become a holiday staple appetizer in my house. This year my dad (jokingly) told me that he wouldn't come for Christmas if I didn't make these meatballs lol

Accidentally bought Meatless Meatballs - no one knew. Turned out great. I also did them in a slow cooker for a couple hours.
