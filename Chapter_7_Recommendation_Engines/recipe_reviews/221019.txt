I reviewed this recipe back when it was still a personal recipe. "We make these, too! Sometimes, if  I have the inclination I'll add pepperoni in the middle and serve it with hot marinara. My kids  especially flip for these. Even better results, cook in the cast iron skillet with a nice pat of butter."

There's just something about ooey, gooey melted cheese between a couple of slices of cripy bread... I LOVE grilled cheese and this is a nice twist with a bit of an Italian flair! This was so easy and so good! I opted to sandwich some mozzarella cheese slices in between with some thin sliced tomato and fresh basil to take the already awesome recipe over the top! Thanks for sharing a great recipe rae!

I tried this before it was a 'kitchen approved' recipe (Congrats, Rae!), and I've made it MANY times since. Here's what I had to say: AWESOME! This is one of those recipes that's like 'why didn't I think of that'? I love the flavors of the seasonings in the egg mixture and with the cheese it was just over the top! I'm notorious for 'doctoring up' an ordinary grilled cheese sandwich, but this was so different from anything I've ever done. It was like a savory stuffed french toast, minus the syrup, of course. ;) I did add a slice of swiss along with the american cheese and next time I may even add a slice of tomato. Thanks, Rae, for such a different and delicious twist on the ordinary, boring grilled cheese! I know I will be using this method often. :)

I was a little worried about the eggy, French toast texture of the bread, but it all comes together with great flavor and flare.  It's like garlic bread meets grilled cheese meets French toast all in one.  My husband loved them and he's not a grilled cheese fan.  Can't wait to make again and experiment with other types of cheeses like mozzarella, provolone, or a blend of different cheeses.  Thanks, rae for sharing such a wonderful recipe!

I just really loved the Italian flavors of this grilled cheese sandwich. It had that yummy flavor, without a bunch of work. It was a nice change to a cold sandwich or plain grilled cheese. I changed it to 2 servings and used an Italian bread. The only thing I might do next time, is to see if I can cut the egg back or thin it out a little with a tad more milk. I want the Italian flavor, it has, without too much egg taste. I am adding this to my recipe box under lunch to have again. thanks, Rae

Talk about a phenomenal grilled cheese! Love this concept and the final product. I could eat the whole batch myself. This will definitely go into the lunch/dinner rotation in our house. Would be lovely with tomato basil soup or a tomato salad. I want one right now!

I'm a little unsure of how I felt about this sandwich, it was just a little weird.  The outside was too eggy for me and never crisped up.  3 stars from me.

I love this sandwich...I made a change in it though.  I dipped both sides of the bread in the egg mix and grilled both sides lightly.  Then I removed from the pan, added the cheese and grilled.  Was absolutley awesome!  Thanks for sharing.

These are FANTASTIC.  I made them with an Extra sharp cheddar, but you can do so many variations of these it's endless.  YUMMY!  Thanks!

Delicious Italian twist on grilled cheese. This would fantastic with a bowl of tomato soup, but it stands on it's own well enough. This would be easy to modify with mozzarella cheese instead or cheddar or whatever you like. My tastebuds are in grilled cheese heaven. Thanks for Grandma's great sandwich.

My hubby's tummy isn't easy to please, but this sandwich was a huge hit with him!  I added black forest ham.  Saved it to my recipe box, as I will be making it again and again.  Thank you so much for sharing your grandma's wonderful recipe. :)

I didn't give it 5 stars because I didn't make it as written, and I don't feel it would be fair. However, I did use the exact spices/cheeses in the recipe and can say the flavor was fantastic. First of all, I only need two sandwiches and I didn't want to bother with the egg/milk concoction (I'm not the biggest french toast fan either). I pulled out a tub of butter - 15oz.(there was only about 1/4 of the butter remaining in the tub). I allowed it to soften for about 30 minutes then mixed in the garlic powder (1tsp), italian seasoning (1tsp), and parmesan cheese (1Tbls). Instead of dipping the sandwiches, I simply buttered the outsides of the bread and grilled them on the stove. We loved the flavors of the sandwiches, and since I didn't use all the butter, we can make them again anytime we feel like it. I will make this again using the butter method.

I thought this was going to be a crispy sandwich, but it’s not.  It definitely is more spongy like a French toast texture.  Not a favorite

12.10.17  I used cheddar slices (what I had on hand) which don’t melt as well as American, and I also added some deli ham which needed to be used up.  That Italian egg dip really styles up an ordinary grilled cheese sandwich.  Nice recipe.

I was skeptical because I am not a fan of french toast. I am a fan of this sandwich, I liked the texture, taste, and the look of the sandwich. A perfect addition to any brunch table.

I saw this recipe and had my mouth all set for it, only to discover the only bread I had was the two ends. I went with it anyway, and it turned out great. So delicious! I love the flavor of the Italian seasoning and the parmesan. I might just make my grilled cheese like this every single time.

My husband'd only complaint is that I only made him one sandwich. If I could give this 10 stars I would.
Definitely a grade above the normal grilled cheese sandwich.

This was delicious, but I give it a lower rating since I didn't make the exact same thing. I only had dried spices except for rosemary...so instead lf tsp I did 1/4 tsp of spices, and the one that was a Tbl was a teaspoon. I mixed all the spices into a sauce like consistency with about 1/3 olive oil mayo and 2 Tbl of greek cream cheese. I also didn't go the eggwash route, it was just buttered and decrusted wheat bread on low for 3 minutes both sides. If I had the fresh stuff, this would have all played out quite differently. However, I realize someone out there might be questioning if this recipe works well with dried herbs. My 2 year old ate half of his sandwich, my 5 year old took one bite and was upset that he had been bamboozled by a gourmet sandwich, and I REALLY loved the change to an elevated grilled cheese option. Hope that helps!

Interesting sandwich. I made two: one with cheddar cheese and one with cayenne pepper primo sale. Both went very well with the flavors from the egg mixture. The texture stays soft, or at least mine did. I used gluten free sandwich bread, so I'm not sure what impact this had on the outcome. All-in-all a nice change from a regular grilled cheese. Thank you for the recipe.

For fear that the sandwich would turn out soggy like french toast, I adhere to one of the user's advice by not letting the bread sit too long in the egg mixture and added butter to brown.  I added some green onion to the mixture as well.  However, the bread remained soggy and lack that crispiness a grilled cheese would normally have by only buttering the bread.

This is a classic Monte Cristo sandwich with an Italian twist!  Add a little butter to that pan, if it isn't browning.  I had a sense from the reviews, that people were dipping the individual slices of bread.  Dip  and flip the assembled sandwich, don't let it sit in the liquid.

I was worried about the egg giving it a funny taste, but it was fine. A different take on grilled cheese. Although when I want a grilled cheese I want crispy bread with gooey cheese inside. This was not crispy at all. I would not necessarily make it again. Just not my thing.

Didn't go out the way I thought it would. The bread tasted soggy, cheese didn't melt right. Tasted fine... a bit too garlicky.

This was a quick alternative to the bland grilled cheese sandwich. I am just starting to pay attention to cooking (really) and it was a surprisingly tasty sandwich with all the little spices and egg adding a little more depth. Still this recipe might be better with a little balsamic or pesto. Thanks.

I did not love this. It had a weird sweet taste to it. I really didn't love the egg on the outside. My kids didn't really enjoy it either. They preferred the brussels sprouts that I cooked as a side.  I probably wouldn't make again.

Honestly this was more of a three star for me, but hubby and kids loved it.  I so wanted to like this, but I was thrown off by the egg coating, which never really crisped like "regular" grilled cheese.  I felt I could achieve something tastier by skipping the egg and simply seasoning the butter I fried the sandwiches in.  Has potential, but as is, not my particular cup o' tea.

the seasonings were just a little too overpowering for me.. used cheddar instead of american and threw in a bit of grilled onion.. idk if i'm going to attempt to make this again.. but if i do i'll see if maybe half the seasonings would cut it

Quick and easy recipe for my school's Culinary Club. The garlic was a nice touch.
