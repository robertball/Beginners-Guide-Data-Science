I did make a few changes. I only had Old Fashioned Oats. I added one ripe banana and decreased BB to 1 cup. After reading comments I grated lemon peel and skipped water and used lemon juice. Also added cinnamon and a little nutmeg. Alas, I found them a little dull too. I do agree they need more sugar. So I sprinkled some on the tops of others. I needed much more time for mine to cook.  Not sure if it was bc of changes or my oven. I would make them again. Just need a bit more sweetness.

Followed recipe exactly and they were very bland. No go from the entire family. Needs butter and sugar or something!

Super yummy, moist and delicious. I cut the recipe in half and it still made 9 muffins. Not too sweet...just right! Shared with the office and they raved about them.

Well, on the bright side, they are healthier and more filling than a typical bb muffin.  However, they are a little bland.  I added orange zest per someone's suggestion and it helped a little but quite simply.... They just need more sugar, lol.  I make my own chai spice mix.....maybe a little it would give these some zip without adding sugar and calories.   Maybe some spends too.

I had to make one change - we don't eat quick-cooking oats so I used old fashioned oats instead. This gave the muffins a nice chewiness. But, I agree with one reviewer that the muffin is pretty bland I could actually taste the flour in one blueberry-less bite. And I even added the cinnamon that another reviewer suggested. Maybe add nuts? I think oranges would be a good complementary taste, so orange zest? The texture was light and fluffy, and thatâ€™s after I failed to notice the do-not-overmix warning.

Made these muffins yesterday, they are easy and turned out nice, but the flavour was lacking. Likely this is because of the yogurt. If I make this recipe again I will add lemon zest .
