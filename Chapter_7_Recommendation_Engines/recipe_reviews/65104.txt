This is the very first thing I learned to cook as a young girl in the south. Here's a couple of tips that seem to help me when I make it. This gravy most certainly taste better when you are using grease from bacon or sausage you have just fried. Also, I watch the browning process carefully, and don't usually brown it for very long before slowly adding the milk. I bring it to a boil to thicken it, but not too much because it tends to thicken on it's on once removed from the heat. if making for breakfast, toss in crumbled sausage or bacon! Also, my family and I really seem to like it with a pinch of garlic powder.

I was looking for a simple white gravy and this is it.  I followed one reviewers advice to use butter instead of oil.  It turned out really yummy.  Kids and hubby ate it up! I can't imagine it with plain oil.  I didn't brown the butter as I wanted a white gravy.  It is important to cook the fat/flour (roux) mixture for a couple minutes before adding the milk.  I noted other reviewers complained of it tasting floury and that would be from not cooking the roux long enough.
This would also be good to add crumbled bacon and drippings or sausage and serving wih biscuits.  Thanks for the recipe!

To have a good flavor this needs to be made with bacon grease (or sausage drippings), then it will taste like Mom's! If you're going to indulge in something this heavy and fattening, you may as well do it all the way! I think it is better not to brown the roux, just let it bubble for a few minutes to get the rawness out of the flour and then add the milk... it's supposed to be white. I love this gravy over biscuits because I'm just not a sausage gravy person. I crave it on Sunday mornings, but I'd eat so much that it's become a Christmas morning treat and that's about the only time I let myself have it. So good!

This is a good start thats why I gave it a 3 star rating. You have to use butter, and when you mix the flour with the butter you should let it sit for at least 10 min. or longer to let the butter and flour mix well. Or your gravy will tast like flour.

White Gravy. WOW. Grew up on this.  Don't eat it much now since my growing days are supposed to be over.
OK, you floury tasters, COOK the flour.  Flour tastes just like flour. Does bread taste like flour? No. Because the flour has been cooked.  The author noted to cook the rue for 10 minutes.  If you taste flour, you didn't cook it for 10 minutes.  I don't use as much flour, so I don't cook it for 10 minutes.  Adding the milk it is just a look thing.  The rue just looks like it is ready for milk.  One thing you can do is cut down of the flour, cook the rue, and then cook the gravy on simmer longer.  The water in the milk will evaporate, helping the gravy thicken.
While you stir (and not burn the gravy), you are supposed to sing Bringing in the Sheaves twice, and then the gravy should be perfect.... According to Granny.

Very simple and easy recipe to make! The only complaint is when tasting it, the gravy tastes really flourly ... so I kept adding other spices like a pinch of garlic salt and more pepper. However, the best way to taste is to add chicken or beef buillion to the gravy! Easy and delicious!

I made this tonight as a plan b meal when the weather was too awful for me to go out and get the stuff I needed for the dinner I was going to make. It was served along with broiled pork chops, steamed green beans, and mashed potatoes. I think it's pretty good. I did add about a tsp of garlic powder (though I was seasoning to taste and not measuring, so that could be more or less) to give it a bit more flavor. I also used light butter instead of vegetable oil. If you are finding it is too runny as a recent reviewer did, you need to let it simmer longer. After I got the milk in, I let it simmer at least 5 minutes and maybe more, and it was nice and thick. I plan on adding some peas and dried beef to this later this week and serving it over toast. Yum!

This is the recipe I remember my mom and grandmother making; they call it sawmill gravy. I have made this several times and I always use unsweetened soy milk with great success. For more flavor, I like to add a bit of "Better than Bouillon" to the milk but, as previously mentioned, this recipe is exactly how my family makes breakfast gravy. Lately I have been sauteing mushrooms in the pan to make a yummy shroom gravy. Many thanks!

This is a nice little gravy.  My recipe is a little different, but then again, varity is the spice of life.  It would be boring if there were only one recipe for gravy!  People don't usually eat gravy every day, but even if it is not healthy, once in a while, I think it's ok to splurge.
My country gravy goes like this:
Fry a piece of bacon in a skillet.  Remove bacon from pan.  Now, add some good sausage and a couple tbls. of salted butter.  Cook until sausage is done.  Remove the sausage and set aside.  If there is not at least 1/4 c. of the grease, add a little more butter until melted.  Add not quite the same amount of flour and brown a little, until it is a little thicker than pancake batter.  Stirring constantaly, add milk 1/2 c. at a time until desired thickness.  Add the cooked sausage and stir.  You may add the cooked bacon in crumbles, if desired.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  Enjoy over biscuits.

Overall this is a good recipe and we will be using it again.  It does make a tremendous amount of gravy so I hope it will thin back out with some additional milk for use in leftovers.  Next time I may skip the whole browning part.  I think it made the gravy taste a bit too much like, well, browned flour.  I might try using butter in place of the oil as well.  Definately a workable recipe though, especially if you are steering clear of sausage.

This is also my mothers country gravy that came from her mother that came from her mother and my mother is in her 80's so it's been around for a very long time. I do want to share one of my tips for this wonderful recipe...After the flour is browned, I turn the heat off long enough to stir or whisk in the milk.  Then I finish cooking until thickened.  This method gives me a lump free gravy every time

This is a great basic cream gravy recipe.  Obviously, you can add various things to make it suit your taste, or to complement whatever you are serving it with. Thank you, Nancy, for your contribution!

This was great, but I always use a can of evaporated milk to make my gravy, it seems to make it richer and tastier.

Any country girl knows that you use sausage drippings to make country gravy.  Using plain oil is what we did when we didn't have the money for meat, and the gravy is bland this way.  Use bacon, sausage, or ham drippings, and I suggest that you also crumble some sausage into the gravy, too.

I was really just looking for the proportion of fat to flour to liquid. My grandmother used to make country gravy with hamburger over baked potatoes and this worked out perfectly. I did butter instead of oil though, just like grandma use to make!

I don't understand how on earth this recipe recieved any high ratings. Its a good thing I tasted it before pouring it all over my omlet. It pretty much tasted like flour with oil. I would not advise anyone to try this recipe. Much better off with the store bought pouches.

Pretty tasty.  I followed the recipe, but made some minor changes.

I cooked up some bacon and sausage in the same pan, prior to mixing the gravy, so used that leftover grease to start with.

Instead of Veggie Oil, I used some butter I had in the fridge. Be careful so it doesn't burn....

This is my first review, but soon you'll know that I like using garlic in my food.  Since this is country-style, I used very little, just a few pinches.

Paprika and some Tabasco red hot sauce was added as well, in addition, fresh ground black pepper!!!!

Don't cook the gravy too long or it'll be very thick when it settles, so thick that it will act like icing on your biscuits or hash browns or eggs....

Overall, fantastic.  Now I can make country style gravy from scratch when I make my country-fried pork chops!!!!!

I thought this was a great gravy. I make a lot of gravy in lots of different ways so this is a nice addition.  So many negative reviews about how they made it different.  Well, why did you look at the recipe then? Obviously, you are an expert! Thanks for the recipe!

Other than the "oil" this is the same recipe that I learned from my grandmother and great grandmother.  Instead of oil I use a bulk sausage.  You can get a roll of Jimmy Dean sausage (not links) from your local grocery store.  Fry just like you would any ground meat.  DO NOT DRAIN! You do not need the added salt.  Add the flour and stir until brown, about 5 min. No need to cover.  Stir in milk and cook as recipe dictates.  I add the pepper at the end.  You won't be disappointed.

I can't imagine using oil.  Using butter or drippings will make a tasty gravy.  Saute garlic in the butter and for variations add onion, mushrooms and sundried tomatoes.  If you get creative, add parsley or basil to the butter.  Add the milk slowly, stirring constantly and the flour will cook nicely and not taste floury.  This is also a wonderful base for cream soups to add to cooked vegetables along with enough liquid to make desired consistancy.  Add acouple of cups of cheese for cheese soup.  Not heart healthy, but really good.

Yup, that's the recipe.  But people didn't use vegetable oil when I grew up with.  Bacon grease sat in the strainer on the stove, and was the standard ingredient for everything.

I gave it 4 stars because if you are from the South (like me), you will only make milk gravy with bacon or sausage drippings or grease (with the little crispies) where you have just fried chicken.  I am 57 years old and have never heard of using butter to make gravy!  I also don't like my gravy as white as flour......so, I cook the roux to a nice brown color before slowly adding the milk.  Wonderful over biscuits, toast, mashed potatoes or fresh sliced home-grown tomatoes (my personal favorite).  I also want my gravy plain....meaning no crumbled up meat in it.

No pork fat - If you want to add flavor to your country gravy instead of all the fat with sausage or bacon grease, try peanut butter.  Yes, peanut butter! Put your cooking oil in the pan and then add a big spoonful of peanut butter.  It melts down like crisco.  Brown it just a little, then start adding your flour and milk, etc.  It's really great on biscuits and it does not have a strong peanut butter taste.  Try it, you'll be suprised!!!

I was born and raised ona ranch and we had gravy and biscuits every morning. The secret to gracy is the roux. Put 1-2 cubesof butter in a skillet and melt. Add flour until it is thickens and KEEP cooking until roux BROWNS well. Pour in milk. Add salt and PEPPER to taste. You may also tear a jar of dried beef into the  gravy when you add milk. Cook slowly, stirring steadily until it thickens. This is to die for!

I am from Texas so I use bacon drippings that have been strained. I also heat about a cup of the milk and use this as the beginning milk, it ensures that there are no lumps. You can pop it in the microwave for about 45 seconds to warm it up. If you add cold milk to the roux, you are pretty much ensured to have lumps that you will have to stir like crazy to get rid of.

Great!  I don't even have to try this, because it's the same way my grandmother taught me to make what I used to call "lumpy gravy."   However the "lumps" came from the scraps left in the pan after frying chicken or pork chops.   This makes for a wonderful gravy.   The key here is to brown the flour.  Don't skip on this.  It is the difference between a wonderful, rich, nutty taste and PASTE.   Too many restaurants and people don't brown the flour............ugh!!!

i make alot of gravy this was a good one for telling someone else how to make it on the phone. if you get lumps or dont like to brown your flour just shake the milk and the flour together in a warm jar that you rinse with hot water. add to your hot drippings and stir. its all gravy.

I too have been making this for years.  50 to be exact. :-) Even when using sausage or bacon I substitute some of the oil with butter for a really rich taste.  I have even used Carnation evaporated milk or half & half along with the regular milk for an even richer flavor.

Like one of the other reviewers said, this is a good start. In my family this gravy was always made with pan drippings. Especially good with fried chicken drippings, although I have made it with vegetable oil with good results as well. The biggest difference is my mom always used canned milk mixed with equal amounts of water and I do too. It seems to give the gravy a richer taste. I also cut back on the black pepper. And as another reviewer stated the roux has to be cooked long enough that you don't get a raw floury taste. Where my mom came from this was called country gravy.

the title is correct as it did tasted just like my mom's. the problem is my mom is a terrible cook. I'll stick to my grandma's gravy made with a 3 to 1 mix of bacon grease and butter (3 parts bacon grease and 1 part butter), equal parts of ap flower and a pinch of garlic powder. you have to work the roux on a medium heat to ensure the flower is cooked but not browned. using whole milk gives a richer flavor too. make sure you stir constantly while adding the milk and then bring the mix to a boil and reduce the heat back down to about medium. I use a 10" or a 12" iron skillet and have learned to turn the heat off just before it gets to the right thickness for you.

Good Gravy!  If you use butter you have the basic classic white sauce.  If you use rendered fat from meat...you have gravy.  Cook sausage and use the rendered fat from that for some good sausage and biscuits with gravy.  Fried chicken too!  Discard the excess oil and use the frying grease with the brown bits in the bottom of the pan for some killer chicken gravy

This was allright. Nothing special, but not bad either. There are much better gravies out there, IMHO. NOTE: Many reviewers suggest that you not brown your flour or only brown it for half the time called for. While I agree that the only way to achieve a white gravy is to slightly or not brown your flour, I feel it is CRUCIAL that you not skip this step. If you do, you'll end up with a gravy that tastes like flour (the browning step "cooks" the flour)! I do suggest substituting butter or cooking grease (i.e. bacon or sausage) for oil, however. This is my only regret... the cooking grease from my country fried steaks would have significantly enhanced the flavor of this gravy. :( Thanks for sharing, Nancy. I think I'll stick with my favorite packaged gravy mix, but I'm glad to have given your mom's homemade version a try nonetheless! :-)

this is much better using bacon grease or sausage grease or if you perfer use a little real butter to the vegetable oil, gives it a much better flavor.

My husband woke up this morning & wanted biscuits and gravy.  I didn't have sausage or bacon so I used this recipe. I scaled it down to 2 servings and it turned out great. It's perfect as is or for tweaking it in the future to go with a particular meal. Thanks for submitting it!

I followed precisely and thought the flavor was awful!  It tasted like animal fat to me.  After reading reviews I see some people used butter instead of oil, and that would probably make it much better.  I would not reccommend using oil!!!

This is basic white sauce, except for using oil in the roux which is okay for dishes like stews, Jambalaya.etc. where they use a 'penny' colored roux. Butter is the norm for white sauce. However, making a southern style gravy I'd use the fat from bacon or sausage for that special flavor and ad some crumbled sausage or bacon with it. Now for the 'starchy' taste, that comes from not cooking the roux long enough to remove the starch flavor which takes about 8-10 minutes and a lower temp if you're wanting a blond roux, which is indicated by using milk. At least half chicken stock and milk will move the gravy away from being bland.Oil is neutral as far as flavor is concerned. Just take a little time and get the starch taste out.

Easy white sauce. I use equal butter (melted 1st) to flour, and REALLY blend well while it cooks "low and slow". S&P of course, then the milk & add in 1 pkg Buddig Beef (chopped) to make "Stuff on a a Shingle" served over toast. Thanks for posting for all who don't know the basic white sauce. Glad to see someone has the idea. I'm gonna try bisquits and gravy with it (thanks for the reminder).

My mother made It exactly like this all the years I was growing up and still does. Sometimes she would use bacon grease; never sausage drippings. That would completely change the flavor of it. No butter. This is what country gravy should be.

I followed the recipe exactly, except to substitute butter for the oil. After cooking it forever the gravy wouldn't thicken(which was very frustrating) so I ended up adding some cornstarch. My gravy turned out really dark. A a few of my siblings actually asked me if it was hot chocolate while I was making it:) Must have done something wrong somewhere... Anyhow, they liked it and ended up finishing it all. I probably wouldn't use this recipe again because of the bad experience I had making it, and we all still like sausage gravy alot better.  Thanks for sharing though.

I have been making this since, well, seems like forever. I learned how to make it from watching my Mom cook. I use the grease or oil from when I fry chicken or chops or just about anything. Believe it or not, you can even make this if you have fried fish, there's no fishy taste. You can't taste the flour if you follow the directions. Browning the flour, doesn't change the color, just adds to the flavor. Just fon't burn the flour mixture.

Good basic recipe but as others have stated, better with butter instead of oil and also add sausage or bacon with the drippings. I made it last week but I also used half & half instead of milk. You do need to "brown" the roux - not to the point that it gets really dark but enough to cook out the floury taste.

This is all about browning the roux, or yes, it will taste like flour.  Bacon grease is probably ideal for the grease, but it tastes fine with shortening, you just have to make sure you have browned the roux long enough that it can flavor the entire pan of gravy.  If yours tastes like flour, it's because you didn't brown the roux long enough.

So Easy, So Good, So Versatile.
Breath_In_Dreams said she wasn't going to brown the flour next time because she said it tasted like browned flour.  Wait until she gets the taste of "raw" flour.  Ich.  Just brown it as much as you think you'll like it.

Best gravy I ever tasted and made myself! very easy and I followed recipe exactly EXCEPT I had to use more butter after flour was in and then ended up adding oil also. i cooked the roux mixture for about 10 minutes as others suggested then added the milk. i added more pepper and some garlic powder also. Its supposed to be for dinner but i had some on toast already and idk if it will make it to my country fried steaks tonight lol

This was REALLY good with a couple of changes.  I added 1 cube of chicken bouillon to the mix, took out the salt and added only 1/2 tsp. pepper, used skim milk (which just added a bit to the cooking time), and substituted the veggie oil with a stick of margarine.  I have never been able to make gravy come out right until now.  Thank you!

I love this because it's Mom and Grandma's recipe the only different between there recipe calls for 4 table spoons of bacon drippings instead of vegi oil. I will use this rewcipe for guest and almost every time I want gravy. Will be bad a couple of times a year and use Grandmas and Mom's...

Normally I like a sausage gravy, but we didn't have any around the house. I used 1/4 cup butter instead of the oil. I also cut the pepper to 1/2 tsp and added 1 tsp of poultry seasoning for a richer flavor. I made sure to cook the roux before adding milk, which made a big difference. This turned out to be a nice creamy country gravy.

Wow!  It doesn't get any easier than this, and you're bound to have all the ingredients.  I added some chicken bullion for a little extra flavor.  Great on quartered and boiled potatoes (REALLY like grandma used to make!).

I use butter instead of oil. Also a little crumbled up cooked bacon and sausage.  Salt is a necessity, without it no flavor at all also pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and a dash of Worchestshire sauce.  Country gravy has to be more than a white sauce.  It has to taste like southern country. Maybe a 1/2 tsp. of chicken bouillon also.

This is close to the same gravy my mother taught me to make when I was a young girl.  We used this gravy over chicken fried steak and over mashed potatoes as well as a breakfast gravy.  Add your seasonings to the flour before you cook it, and it is very important to make sure the flour is cooked... it won't be brown, but allow it to cook slowly so as not to burn it. You can't rush good gravy!! You MUST add the water only a little at a time... the pan will be hot and you may get burned by spatters if you don't. Instead of water, you could also use chicken broth or beef broth to add flavor. Then add as much milk to make it creamy and the consistency you want,  warm through, and enjoy!

Have made this many times, made with pan drippings it becomes gravy. When using butter it's actually a white sauce suitable for any "a la king" additions.

This is the same recipe my mother used and her mother before her (gram was born in 1900)! The only difference is they made the roux in the same pan they used to fry chicken. Leave just enough of the oil that the chicken was fried in, add the flour, then add the milk. We never had this for breakfast, only with fried chicken for dinner. It is the best!

Too much vegetable oil.  The best gravy I make is brown one pound of pork sausage, add 1/4 cup flour and mix.  Add two cups of milk and cook until thickened.  Simple and tasty.  Add seasonings to taste.

Good start for a Basic recipe.  I did make it up as per recipe for the first time.  Like other reviews it taste better with melted butter instead oil.  It is a little too thick for my taste, I use 1/2 cup instead of 3/4 cup of flour to the 4 cups of milk.  I also add pinch more pepper and salt.  To make it easier... when adding the milk use a whisk instead of just stiring in the milk. Thanks for sharing...

This is a great recipe but for the old timers we did not use whole milk in it. We used half and half canned carnation milk with 1/2 water and it is much richer and always use bacon or sausage drippings to get the authentic taste.

This recipe is a great find! Sometimes you don't want sausage and just want something more like a "saw mill" gravy. It is great over toast, biscuits, or a potato breakfast skillet. I also like that it was just made with vegetable oil. I made a 1/2 recipe and still got over 2 cups of gravy. I cooked it in a small saucepan and I only needed to simmer it for 4 minutes. It was plenty brown before adding the milk. I whisked the entire time and it did get nice and thick. Thanks.

This is the typical basic ingredients for making country gravy...but in my mid-west upbringing we use the drippings or grease from meat.  Vegetable oil sounds bland.  In my family, we start with cooking the sausage or country fried steak then using 1/2 cup of the grease to start the gravy.  This is where the flavor is really at!  At least if your going to make it fatty you might as well use something that has flavor, right?  As some of the reviewers state using butter, I agree, but only as a second choose to using drippings.  P.S. Salt and pepper is paramount to any country recipe.

I too grew up making this gravy and have now taught my 11yr old daughter how to make it. I also use butter instead of oil. You do have to taste test through out the cooking process I find it needs more pepper. I also use this as a base for homemade mac and cheese.

We have made this type of gravy for years, we use Bob Evans original sausage. Brown sausage lightly, with about 1/4 or 1/2 cup vegetable oil. Leave sausage in pan for sausage gravy.  Stir in flour (I don't use as much flour as listed in this recipe,) until lightly browned, then add milk. This really gives the gravy flavor. I don't add the tsp of salt either...

WOW. This is the first gravey I learned to make. Never had the amounts written out. just simmered it untill it was done, added milk to thin it if it was thicker then you wanted it. If you made with fried meat drippings it was called pan gravey. 
it is a basic white sauce so you can add a lot of different things to this to change the flavor. onion, mushrooms, hot sauce, tuna, beef, sausage, you get the idea.
If it tastes like flour it hasent cooked long enough.

this is a good recipe........for those complaining of the 'flour' taste........it's because the gravy needs to simmer so the 'flour taste' can cook out......all recipes with a 'roux' mix need to cook a bit.

This is basically the way I have been doing it for years, but instead, I don't add any oils or butters, and just use what comes off of the sage pork sausage I fry into large crumbles, then add the flour and cook it for a little bit, I do not whisk, but use spatula to mix... then add evaporated milk, lots of pepper, some basil, little salt, add some garlic powder to your families taste,(our's like lots ; ), then keep cooking until it tastes & is in the consistiency your family likes -we serve our's over biscuits--Yum ; )  so it's just:  1lb. Sage pork sausage-Bob Evans or Jimmy Dean's we use here 3/4 cup all purpose Flour 1 1/2 cans Evaporated milk---NOT sweetened milk Pepper-to taste Basil-to taste Salt-to taste Garlic Powder-to taste

I have only made gravy with the oil left over from frying chicken or sausage, but this gravy is AWESOME if you just want biscuits and gravy.  I was somewhat surprised to see a gravy recipe, since I just add a little of this or that, but this cuts time and has the perfect amount of everything.

This was delicious! I used butter instead of oil per other reviewer's suggestions and added just a pinch of garlic powder and it was the best gravy ever. I am sure it would be even better with sausage or bacon. I found it a bit difficult to keep the roux going- it kept settling at the bottom of the pan. Nothing that some vigorous stirring can't fix. This will definitely be my gravy recipe from now on!

Just amazing!  I've never made gravy before but my husband wanted it for chicken fried chicken, so I tried this one.  Very easy!  I browned the roux for about 7 minutes and then used about 3 cups of milk.  Perfection!

I did not care for this recipe. I thought gravy should be more liquified and not as thick as this turned out to be. Not recommended!!!

I made a gluten free version using 1/2 cup pan drippings (country fried steak cooked in butter) in place of the vegetable oil. I substituted 1/3 cup corn starch for the flour. I did everything else as listed and it turned out fine.

This is the best scratch gravy recipe I have ever made!! It does not require bacon or sausage drippings to be great. I used another reviewers suggestion, I replaced the oil with butter, added two chicken bullion cubes, and continued the recipe as directed. It came out delicious and perfect. I added chicken cubes because I was serving backed chicken for dinner. My husband raved about the gravy. He is very picky about his gravy!! Will use over and over again!!

Boy this sure does make a lot of gravy!  We'll definitely save the rest for tomorrow's breakfast.  It's absolutely delicious, simple and it went well with our biscuits.  My 14 month old son liked it as well!  We didn't use the entire 4 cups of milk that it called for because it was a little thin for my taste but I am certainly going to use this recipe again and again and again!
Thanks for sharing!

My mom said just buy it-- "Gravy is too much trouble-I can't even make it." I tried this recipe. It actually shut her up. Oh the irony of the title! This was EXCELLENT gravy. EASY EASY.

I gave this 4 stars because what I made was good, but it was not this recipe.  I made a country skillet dinner (home fries, ground beef, scrambled eggs, gravy), and wondered if white gravy truly was just a cream sauce/white roux.  This recipe confirmed that it pretty much is. 

Lengthy technical rant to follow:

My problem with this recipe is that it should be a 1:1 ratio of fat to flour, which may explain why people get a runny sauce.  So if you want ~1c use 2tb fat/flour, ~2c use 1/4c each, ~4c, 1/2c each.  I prefer butter over oil.  Also, this type of sauce needs to come to a full boil in order to reach it's full thickening potential (it can always be thinned later with more milk), so that could be another reason people could be getting a runny sauce.

Browning of the flour didn't work so well for me.  Not sure if it got too dark or what, but I ended up discarding it and starting over.  I used the same measurements, but didn't brown the flour first.  I got the milk and spices boiling, then slowly added the flour, simmered this until it thickened.

Thee appears to be two things in this world I can not make. Despite hundreds of recipes. Brownies with the dark burnt end and chewy center....and country gravy. I tried this recipe to the C and even tried it a few other times with the various suggested by reviewers. It just taste like flour and pepper to me. What the heck am I doing wrong?

This was GREAT! I made cat head biscuits and then went to the pantry to grab a Pioneer white gravy mix packet just to realize that I didn't have one. I followed the recipe to a T (with a tad more salt) and it was seriously so easy that I highly doubt I'll ever use something from a packet ever again!! Thanks so much for this recipe!!

I'm sorry, but I did not care for this! I followed the recipe precisely. And yes, I did cook the roux long enough. It had a nasty, greasy, floury taste. Adding additional seasonings couldn't even redeem this. Growing up in the south, I've had my fair share of gravy, and this is not gravy, this is paste! I'm just happy that this was an inexpensive cooking lesson.

I used a stick butter and added a little bacon grease and this recipe was spot on! I made it for a birthday breakfast for the boyfriend and he loved it and he's worse than a kid with how picky he is! I would say it's a lot for two people but as he said "You can never have too much gravy" (he's from the south)

Ok so I tried this recipe because I was looking for a new recipe to try to surprise my husband after work with a new supper & it failed miserably. No amount of stirring made this thicken even the slightest bit & I even tried adding more flour. Not a very happy camper at the moment...

Why would you use vegetable oil??  I should've gone with my gut and used butter! Followed this exactly and this tasted like jellied oil. No amount of salt or pepper can fix that taste!

I was not happy with this recipe at all.  It was so very bland. No matter how much seasoning I added, it didn't change.  It was essentially liquid flour. Definitely never using this again.

I agree with Janine...to get the right flavor, fry up some sausage or bacon first, set it aside.  Next, pour off the fat.  NOW start your gravy...
Great starter recipe!  Sometimes I add a pinch of red pepper flakes for some kick...try it, you'll like it!

Thanks so much for this vegetarian gravy recipe!  It was so yummy and I will definitely make in again!  I did take the advice of other reviewers and added a little minced garlic and used (vegan) butter instead of oil.  The gravy stiffed up quickly so I added about 2 cups of vegetable stock and simmered everything again.

This is a good recipe I concur with the other posts about using sausage or bacon grease, but you can also use the drippings from fried chicken. Using these drippings will increase your flavor, you could also add powdered chicken base to the gravy as it cooks. If you find that your gravely tastes floury it is because you are not cooking it long enough this is the most important part, cook on low heat and cook at least 5 min ,I usually cook it until it turns light brown.

If you use 1/2 evaporated milk and 1/2 water, it tastes even more country.  This is how my great-grandmother made hers

The olive oil is healthier, but doesn't taste "right". To make this true "country" gravy, you have to use bacon grease or the drippings from fried sausage.

A good starting point. For breakfast gravy, I always use bacon or sausage grease. Not the same without it. And if serving with pork, I add the pork drippings - and if serving with chicken, I add either chicken bouillon or chicken broth (in place of some of the milk). I felt this recipe, as it stood, was a little too bland. Cooking is all about flavor.

This is much like my rue or white sauce, but I make it with a stick of butter instead of the oil. Your way there is not so much taste over biscuits. So, I crumble up a lb of bulk country sausage with the butter when browning, when the sausage is cooked through, thicken with the flour and proceed as directed.  It is so much better over biscuits.

Mmmm......takes me back.  My mom used to make this all the time for us.  She would even use bacon grease.  I try to make it and it turns out, but it never seems to taste as good as my moms.  I miss her!

This is just amazing, we use it with many purposes! Though we don't put pepper because my mother is allergic so she taught me that recipe without it. When I prepare to myself, I put a lil' cayenne, tastes amazing too!

This very similiar to the recipe my mother and grandmother made.  They used the meat drippings for the base, no oili or butter needed.  Mom always added Kitchen bouquet for the seasoning and with it's brown color, turned the white gravy into a nice very light brown.  As we used up the gravy, she would make a new batch the next night and add it to the older batch, so we always had gravy ofr dinner every night.

I rate it a 4

This is what we affectionately call "poor man's gravy" in my area!  I always have made it with bacon grease and yes - you do need to cook the roux for a while to keep it from tasting floury.  Also, you need to cook it until it comes to a boil.  If it thickens too much, add a little more milk.   While this recipe is good - it is much better with fat from cooking bacon or sausage.

My version is like this,( no oil, no butter, no bacon) 2 cups of swanson chicken broth and 2 cups of milk, whisk all that with the salt and then cook it, and keep whisking and cooking for 10 mts.  "done"  then add pepper, if you want more flavor to it add 1/8 tsp. of worcestershire sauce. Our favorite gravy for Thanks Giving!

This is basicly the same recipe that my Grandmother used. I assume that this one is for the basic because it is a little bland.  We always use the drippings whether bacon, chicken or steak and the flavor pops.

oil is healthier, butter tastes better! Pick your priority. I find a happy medium is I can'd believe its not butter. I added some dried chipped beef for a breakfast meal. I like mine with a bit more zip though/plain white gravy is a tad boring so I put in a few red pepper flakes in mine. Since I use chipped dried beef in mine which is pretty high in sodium already I cut the salt in half. My real change was to use less flour...it was bit too thick for me as written. I used 1/2 cup.

I have used this same recipe for years.  I was taught to place the flour in a cup and gradually stir while adding half the liquid. Start out with a paste and gradually add liquid until all dissolved.  Meanwhile the other half of the liquid is in the skillet getting warm.  Gradually combine while stirring until mixed.  Cook for one minute after bubbling.  Stir constantly.  You will always have smooth gravy without lumps.

Great basic gravy recipe. I used oil from frying chicken and it was a good chicken gravy however I would probably add a boullion cube or two.  Thank you for the recipe!

Browned a tube of pork sausage.  Used the drippings from that and a stick of butter instead of the vegetable oil.  Also used 2 cups whole milk and 2 cups skim milk.  Lots of stirring to keep lumps at bay, but worth it.  Watch it carefully. Two thumbs up from my boys who have been wanting me to make them biscuits and gravy!  Thx for the recipe.

Our family calls this Milk Gravy & it is a tradition to have with ham & boiled potatoes on Easter.
BUT we use bacon grease with the flour & brown as much as you can without burning or "until it smells right".  If you don't brown it enough it will have no flavor.

If you want to remove the floury taste you need to simmer it for at least 2 minutes after it turns to "gravy" You must stir constantly though or it will burn.

This is NOT the southern recipe. My grandmother would NEVER have used vegetable oil. Grease from chicken stock, bacon grease, or sausage grease was the only grease/oil used and is still the only way I make it but if you want it bland, use vegetable oil.
BTW the rest of the recipe is fine.

Yummy gravy.  You can also brown the flour mixture and then add water or stock for a nice brown gravy!  The key to smooth gravy (no lumps) is a wisk!!

This is a good recipe. Personally, I use bacon or sausage grease if possible. If you do use oil, go ahead and add a bit of butter to enhance the taste. I am passing on something I discovered quite by accident. One hectic morning while making gravy for biscuits, I grabbed what I thought was black pepper - wrong! It was Montreal Steak Seasoning. I had already mixed it before I realized my mistake. I kept mum about it and served up the gravy anyway, expecting to hear complaints. Guess what? Everyone said it was the best gravy I'd ever made! To this day I add a little Montreal Steak Seasoning to my gravy. Be brave and try it. You will be pleasantly surprised!

Made me want some gravy!

My favorite way is to make it after I've fried chicken, using the oil and browned bits from the chicken.  I'll add more oil if needed.

My family always browned the flour first, as you did.  Most places I've had gravy outside our family serves it white.  Yours is the first I've seen in print to brown the way we do.  Our gravy is more tan than white.  

Thanks for sharing!

good basic recipe except butter is a must.  browning the flour is important for flavor but if you go too far you loose thickening power.  i usually add paula dean's spice blend - salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder - and maybe some cayene pepper for kick.  it does make a lot but can you really have too much gravy?

Great recipe

Sausage gravy is the first recipe I "perfected" after moving off to college but when making Cream Gravy I modify it depending on the use. Example: if it's for Chicken Fried Steak (or chicken), I will add Knorr Chicken Bouillon powder and a small amount of garlic powder.

The trick to perfect sausage gravy is good quality, fresh sausage from a butcher and do not remove it from skillet when making the gravy.  

Brown the sausage in a cast iron skillet, add fresh ground black pepper and kosher salt while cooking.  Use a fork to create a well in the center of the browned meat and add bacon fat and one Tbls of butter. Once melted sprinkle in the flour and using the back of the fork fold mix well and fold in the saugage (pressing the flour into the meat).  Let it cook for maybe a minute while pressing/stirring together.  Turn the heat up to high & pour in whole milk stirring aggressively.  As it boils it will thicken, reduce heat and continue adding milk until it's a bit thinner than you would prefer.  Allow to simmer on low stirring frequently for at least 10 minutes.  Add fresh ground black pepper and salt to taste. Spoon over your favorite buttermilk biscuits add "Red Hot" pepper sauce to taste & ENJOY!

(sorry there's no measurements, I "eyeball" everything)

I've made gravy for years. This one is good. I however use canned cream w/water, 1/2 of each. Sometimes more cream. Takes more of the flour taste out.

I didn't like it at all, but someone else at breakfast thought it was ok, so two stars. I think the main problem is using oil, but I believe in trying a recipe as written the first time around. It didn't taste like gravy I've had before, had a weird taste to it. After cooking it according to the recipe and tasting it, I added garlic powder as per another review; it helped a little. I added more pepper and some chicken bouillon, and that didn't help at all. I think it made it worse ... so I tried to season it as best I could, then served it over biscuits. It was edible, but I won't make it again. Too many other recipes for good gravy out there.

Great starting point for a flavorful gravy... I used butter and fat trimmings per other reviews and also doubled the pepper, but it still had very little flavor. If you have the time and patience (and a family who is willing to put up with your experiments) then it's worth working with it to make a country gravy to compliment your meals...

What a great comfort food recipe!  This is very satisfying as is, but I added some chicken bouillon as one reviewer suggested, and substituted half the milk for water to reconstitute the bouillon.  I like my gravy a little more flavorful, so I also added some bacon drippings to the veggie oil.  I made sure, after adding the flour, that I browned the mixture well, to avoid that raw flour taste.  I served over some left over mashed potatoes which I formed into patties, coated with seasoned flour, egg, and panko bread crumbs, then fried in vegetable oil.  Holy Fat!  So yummy, but for heart health, best not to consume too regularly!

This gravy recipe gives an awesome texture, a great portion size, although it’s a little light on flavor.  As with all recipes, I customize to suit my preferences.  In the first run, I used the grease from 3 slices of bacon and used ½ butter ½ oil (some suggested all butter and no oil) to make the gravy.  I’m sure it would’ve been great, except I used whole wheat flour.  DO NOT SUBSTITUTE WHOLE WHEAT FLOUR =).  For my next run, I'll use ½ butter ½ oil again, with bleached flour this time, plus a little poultry seasoning perhaps.

Followed recipe exactly with exception of using bacon grease instead of vegetable oil. We let the grease cool a bit after cooking bacon then pour it into a glass pyrex dish with lid and put in frigerator. Use exact same amount of bacon grease as is called for oil in recipe (1/2 cup).

Good recipe- I have it 4 instead of 5 because I've made it with oil, and another time with butter.  In my opinion, butter-based roux makes for a much tastier gravy.

This worked out great for me. I used this gravy to put into another recipe..Country Breakfast Casserole on this site. The casserole called for one package of country gravy..and since I'm not a fan of packaged, I decided to give this recipe a try. Made plenty of gravy! I think I will try adding some chicken/beef broth next time to amp up the flavor. But gotta say..this was exactly what I was looking for. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I only rate recipes "as is", if I have to make any changes or additions to the recipe then I am not rating their recipe I am rating my version. So..."as is" this is pretty average, but certainly a good start. Do not use plain oil, there is no flavor to it and it makes it heavy. Either use butter and/or fresh bacon or sausage  drippings. If you didn't cook any bacon or sausage first just grab the jar of drippings that any good southern woman has sitting in their refrigerator. I use a compb of butter and drippings. Also, you must let this cook long enough to get all the flour taste out. To changes things up every now and again I add a pinch of red pepper flakes or cayenne pepper. Hope this helps - Enjoy!

o.k. thought that I'd try a possibly healthier option from my dad's "soppy" or White Sop (I've also heard it called), which our local FoodDay paper has published.  I guess I'm too spoiled on dad's bacon grease, flour & milk gravy. Sorry I couldn't rate this higher, it just seemed bland to me.

I've been making this for years with sasuage or bacon grease instead of plain  "cooking oil" for more flavor. Also I add a touch of brewed coffee when wisking in the milk. You can't taste the coffee, but it gives a much richer taste.(my ex-inlaws were cooks & they made their's this way) YUMMMMM

Great recipe with easy to understand instructions! I followed other readers' advice and used butter instead of oil - adding enough butter to fill my 1/2 cup about 2/3 full, then filled cup the rest of the way with bacon grease. Very rich!

Use bacon grease or sasauge grease instead of oil. In a pinch, you can use butter. Do not brown the oil/flour mixture, but do be sure to cook it on medium/low for several minutes before adding the milk or the gravy will taste like flour.

I dropped the pepper by half.  My family still commented on the "peppery" taste.  As suggested by other reviews, I used 1/4 Cup Butter, 2 TBSP. Bacon Drippings (for the flavor) and 2 TBSP. Oil.  Recipe turned out FABULOUS!  THANK YOU!

this was great. what was great about it is that the ingredients are very simple and can be found as basics in the pantry. i find that using a whisk helps get rid of any potential lumps. it was perfect over my fried pork chops and roasted potatoes and veggies.

Unfortunately the majority of people that rated this recipe good, must have no palette whatsoever.  My attempt at this recipe came out with perfect consistency and perfect color, it looked just like country gravy at a restaurant.  But it tastes only like Flour.    I've attempted multiple times to add more and more seasoning and even another cup of milk to dilute the flour, which unfortunately would also dilute my seasoning some.  Regardless I have no lumps, it's completely smooth, looks great, and tastes horrible.  If you want any heated up slime to put over biscuits and throw some salt/pepper over it, this is the recipe to follow.  Otherwise find a new recipe or try reducing the flour amount.    The problem you really have with this recipe is the browning time of the flour/oil/salt/pepper point because the skillet is too wide and at medium heat it possibly could burn your mixture.  I changed my rating to a 2 from a 1 star, because this does provide one thing for you...a base to make good country gravy.  I'd recommend changing it to a 1/2 cup of flour, but be prepared to either had a ton of:  Salt Pepper Any other spices you have like Steak Seasoning which I highly recommend and/or Beef Bouillon  You also might want to consider using the grease drippings of bacon.  I did all of this minus the bouillon, and I finally got it to taste right after reducing the heat to 2 on my stove rather than 5 which is medium.  It took about 40 minutes, but it worked.  Let no one be confused, t

Only gave it 4 stars because it tastes too much like flour.  But other than that consistancy turned out perfect.  Had to add more salt, garlic salt, and a dash of nutmeg (dad always said the key to good gravy).  So if anyone has a tip to get rid of the floury taste please share.

I've made this for years. It's my favorite gravy. I usually make with my fried chicken. I use about 4 TBSP of the grease thats left from frying. Then I add about 4 or 5 heaping TBSP. of flour that you used to coat your meat in. I start out with a cup of water and 1 chicken boullion cube. When that's dissolved I start adding my milk. Stir untill it's the right thickness for you. Add a little more or less milk if you want. I also use alot of pepper.

This makes really yummy gravy. I used butter instead of oil and added a little garlic powder, chicken bouilion (sp?) and some savory seasoning and it made a wonderful gravy for mashed potatoes. definitely a good change from the everyday chicken gravy we usually use

Other than using bacon grease and throwing some crumbled bacon into the mix, I didn't change a thing. This was more like "grandma's country gravy" for me -- and that is exactly what I was hoping for. I'm positive it is delicious even without the alterations I made (just wanted it to be just like grandma's). Thank you for sharing this little bit of your cooking heritage.

Since the recipe as printed here gives too much of a floury taste, I used only 1/2 cup flour and 4 1/2 cups milk.  Instead of Veg oil I used 2 Tbsps butter.   I first browned 1/2 pound of sausage (I used Jimmy Dean regular) and then added the 1/2 cup flour, the 4 1/2 cups milk, 1 tsp of poultry seaon (to help mask the flour taste) and salt and pepper to taste and then cooked as this recipe instructs.  The consistency was PERFECT anad the taste was fabulous on Pillsbury Grands biscuits!

This recipe was a great starting place to us as we had no clue how to make gravy. We didn't use veggie oil, we used butter instead.  We also added some shallot to it.  It turned out great!!

If it tasted floury you didn't brown it enough before adding the milk. the color of the flour should be "peanut butter colored" before you add the milk. Works like a charm.  Edit: I have since tried this with sausage drippings and adding enough butter to make 1/2 cup of "oil". It is really thick with the 3/4 cup flour to 1/2 cup oil. I am now doing 1/2 cup flour with my drippings plus enough butter to make 1/2 cup of oil, and it is awesome! It makes great sausage gravy this way!

This is so yummy!!!! I used butter like some of the others and a bit of onion and garlic. Served over country fried steak. It was delicious and only took about 5 minutes to make. Makes a large amount so if you just need a little cut in half.

This was pretty good, but mine burnt really easily, and only after 5 minutes. Next time I won't cook as long. It definitely didn't smell burnt, but it actually smelled pretty good.

This gravy was so easy and my family loved it! I did change it up a bit after reading some of the other reviews. I used butter instead of oil. I think the key to the flavor is coming up with the perfect roux in the beginning. As I mixed the butter and flour I cooked the mixture until it was a nice brown color. The deeper the brown the stronger the flavor. It all depends on your personal taste. Once I had my roux where I wanted it, I added the milk. My gravy was more of a tan color as opposed to a white gravy. I also added 1/2 tsp. of garlic salt.

This is such a good recipe, you can use the measurements as a template for practically any gravy. Of course its always best to use the drippings from whatever you cook instead of just oil but it was perfect and very simple. Im horrible at gravy making and this was delicious!!!

I added Sausage and chopped ham and served it over biscuits.  I actually made 2 batches and Put i batch in a gallon freezer bag.  We will have it for a quick dinner sometime, it will be easy to defrost in the microwave and bake refrigerator biscuits at the same time.   Great for this busy mom!

I have been making gravy similar to this most of my life.  It depends on what I am putting the gravy on as to whether I brown the flour or not.  For Chicken Fried Steak I would not brown the flour for the end results to be a White Cream Gravy.  I prefer to use butter instead of oil, for me it just adds a nice flavor.  For those that had problems with a flour taste, you MUST allow the mixture to bubble/simmer to cook the flour for at least 5 minutes while stirring constantly.  If your flour is cooked properly you will not taste the flour at all.

Didn't really like it, had no taste at all(yes I did brown the flour before adding milk).   My boyfriend was thinking it would be like the Chicken Fried steak gravy, and it definately wasn't.

Don't skip the browning step on this one, otherwise it will taste like paste.  Once the flour is added to the oil it should be browned until it looks like peanut butter before adding the milk.  If it's browned properly there isn't much need for extra spices.  Love this recipe!

Just served this tonight with Chicken Fried Chicken (also from this sight).  This gravy was very tasty, and easy to prepare.  In fact, this is the first country gravy recipe I've tried that turned out.  The only change I made was to add paprika, garlic powder, and a little season salt.  Word of caution, when the milk is added and you can see the sauce is starting to thicken, watch it very carefully.  It thickens pretty quickly, if you're not paying attention you have to add more milk to try and thin it out.  Will make again and again!

Great recipe! I substituted 4 tbl of bacon grease for some of the oil. It was so good. The whole family loved it. Be sure to let the flour brown long enough for the real flavor to come out. If you don't brown the flour enough it will taste floury.

After being on silent on this site for a year or two now, I've decided to speak up because this is the first recipe that I thought was bad enough that I had to review it.  

I already used butter instead of oil, but that couldn't save this gravy from being way too flour-y. I cooked the flour/butter (etc) for 10 minutes as was directed, so no it didn't taste of raw flour but nonetheless the flour taste was extremely strong. I had to add at least another cup more milk. 

I ended up also needing to add chicken flavorings from ramen noodles to give it something else and because I had it on hand. 

After these changes, it's all right. 3 stars. But before then, awful. I think even cutting the flour in half might not be enough, but that's what I would suggest at first.

I'm really torn here. On one hand, I wanted to make biscuits and gravy and had vegetarian guests over, so it was cool to see a recipe that specifically does not call for animal fat (although that clearly makes it better). On the other hand, I found myself in a situation where I just added more and more milk in an effort for my gravy to be less thick and... kind of gelatinous? I'm presuming that's because I used oil instead of butter. So maybe it would be a solid 4 stars with butter (and bacon grease!), but then I'd no longer be reviewing the present recipe.

Basic, but good.  I've noticed that when I sub butter in for the oil (cus butter makes everything better) I used closer to 3 cups of milk.  Just have to add milk slowly and stop when its at the consistency you want.

Other than that, its gravy and its great.

Those finding the recipe is floury is because you are not letting the flour brown enough in the fat before you add the milk, once you add the milk absolutely under no circumstance should you add more flour. The flour cooked in the fat is a roux, if you dont let the fat and heat do its thing to the flour its going to taste floury.

Butter would be a traditional french base. Real southern style country gravy is made with pan drippings(bacon, sausage, fried ham[not honey ham] even fried chicken) if need to augment the pan drippings then try lard, if no lard then use butter.

Another user making this their "own"
'Not so country country gravy'

I made mine with butter as well in instead of oil.

I added 1 add'l tsp of pepper
2 packets of no sodium beef bullion
1/3 jar bacon bits

Cook as directed by the original recipe and add the beef bullion to the roux

Add bacon bits to the roux in last 5 minutes of cooking. I stirred the roux for the whole cook time.

Enjoy!

This was a good start for our sausage gravy. We  simply browned the sausage with a chopped onion, added 1/2 a cup of flour(because others said it was a bit thick so we reduced it)to the sausage, onion and  sausage oil (we omitted vegetable oil and left the oil from the sausage in the pan) when it was cooked. When the flour was mixed in we added the salt, pepper and milk and cooked until thickened.  Very tasty :o)

I think it turned out well. I browned some frozen sausage in the skillet before starting the gravy to give it some extra flavor. To avoid that floury taste you have to remember to let the fat/flour mixture cook just a little before adding the milk. Salt and pepper to taste and ta-da!

Reliable and healthy twist on an old favorite. Despite what others say below, browning the roux (oil/flour) is very important for the flavor that this dish is meant to carry. The gravy is white, yes, but an off white is what the picture shows. More a tan gravy. It's classified as white because of the milk and flour and oil simplicity without any specific bullion or stock induced taste. It is a brilliant and simple subtlety. The flavoring of the whole thing is carefully lifted to a wondrous place when you take the complex sugars in the oil, fat, butter, whatever you use, and caramelize them against the flour. Like sautéd onions. Like aging wine. It is the key here, subtlety. The sole secret need not be bacon grease and other such blunt tools of good taste. There is nothing wrong with bacon grease. Some enjoy other things alongside it. There are many secret ingredients, big and small. I was delighted by this recipe and I want to cook many more things like it in the future.

Boy was this thick! I'd always heard a basic ratio of 1 part oil to one part flour when making a roux, so I was hesitant but went with the 3/4 cup flour. Next time I will reduce the amount of flour. I took the advice of several reviewers and used bacon grease. The taste was good. Some people had said there was a strong taste of flour; that happens if you did not cook the flour long enough before adding the milk.

The country gravy was simple to make. Instead of seasoning the gravy with salt and pepper, I used garlic salt, Accent and pepper for more added flavor.

This is a great recipe. I make half the recipe. The first time I made it it had a floury taste to it. Not good.  The second time, I added the flour until the oil was very hot, just as others mentioned and it came out incredible! It cooks very quickly so if I leave it for too long it has a burnt taste to it. Overall it is a great recipe.

this is a great recipe.. ive have been trying to make gravy now for bout 4 days (and just thought bout looking for a recipe online) but, i made it just like it said too and it was great tasting.... but the greesy grime left in my mouth after eatting it is not what i enjoyed... maybe next time ill cut back on the oil but, everyone went for 2nds.. i will DEFF. make this again.. the kids love it.. and also i like my gravy alil brown so i cooked the oil, and flour until it was really brown and then i added the 4 cups of milk it was a little thick so maybe next time ill try 4 1/4 cups milk.. but the kids and i really enjoyed the darker gravy.. so just cook it longer if thats what u want to try..

Tried this recipe but I added a 2 tbl spoons of italian seasoning and sauteed onions when doing the roux and it came out wonderful. Will try it with butter next time to see how it comes out that way also.

Oh my goodness!  I just made cream gravy from scratch.  Yummy!  I did add the garlic salt, and chicken boullion just for a little flavor.  I was a little nervous about cooking the "roux" for 10 minutes after I completely ruined some gumbo a few years back, but it turned out wonderful!  Thanks for the recipe.

My mother-in-law taught me how to make what she called "Breakfast Gravy". She grew up in the south and her southern cooking was awesome. I found this recipe to be very blah. It's actually more of a White Sauce than Country Gravy. The browning of the flour helps a little though. Real Country Gravy needs the drippings from bacon or sausage instead of plain oil. And you must brown the flour otherwise you will just have a white sauce. The browned flour gives the best flavor and color.  I love Country Gravy but it's really not very healty. But once in a great while is very  good.  Yummy.

If you want real country flavor, brown the flour in sausage grease (my favorite) or bacon grease.  Also, try it with buttermilk.

So even though I'm a Canadian girl, I've always had a fascination with southern cooking- I used this recipe and changed it up a little- I added a garlic clove and used butter instead of oil- cooked that up- then added the flour- added 1/2 veggie stock- 1/2 milk, it turned out really yummy-served it over chicken fried chicken- hope it was still true to the south :)

This was okay...the problem is I think there is way too much vegetable oil.  Next time I may use half the oil and half butter or even olive oil.  The oil is just too overpowering even after cooking it for 30 minutes.  However, it does have great potential and made a decent sausage gravy with crumbled spicy sausage and enough salt and pepper.

I have a very similar recipe but I use 1/4 cup less flour. Also I do not brown the roux so much. I do cook it for a few minutes to remove the flour taste. I also first cook some bacon then in the bacon grease I brown and crumble sausage then add the flour to the sausage. No additional oil is necessary. To borrow a catch phraze from a famous culinarian... the bacon grease and sausage really kick this recipe up a notch!

This sounds just like what my mother used to make when I was younger. Unfortunately she didn't have the recipe written down and I've never been able to duplicate it. I do remember her using shortening instead of oil and evaporated milk for a thicker gravy - and lots of pepper! I may now try making from scratch again instead of buying the package mixes. Thank you for posting.

I liked it at first, then realized it needed more pepper.  It also tasted a little too much like flour still.  I'm not a gravy expert, but I would like to try another recipe next time.

If you ever have it with fried green tomatoes you will think you did and went to the heaven cafeteria...
I have it with bacon and put a bit of bacon grease in for the flavor with the tomatoes.  OK it isn't great for you, but if you have it only once in a while, my diabetic doctor says it is fine... You only live once..

Easiest way to make is in a wok.  Cook your Jimmy Dean sausage and leave the drippings in the pan.  Use butter and the flour with no extra salt.  Add the milk after your flour is browned and then put on your Grands biscuits.  Bring to a boil and then back it down some letting the water evaporate and put the sausage in the gravy while stirring constantly.  Pour this sausage gravy over grands biscuits and you are in heaven....and will be full!

I give this 5 stars.  It is much like a gravy I make to use over mashed potatoes. I, too, use saved bacon grease (I freeze it every time I do bacon).  It is  just SO much better this way.  When I use the bacon grease, I don't add butter.  I also will fry up 1/2# of country sausage, add some of the grease (if there is any, we buy REALLY lean sausage) and then add it to the gravy.  This is just great over biscuits.  Tonite for the first time I made elk country steaks and gravy w/the drippings from the steaks.  Turned out GREAT!!  The only spices I add are salt & pepper.  

This is a wonderful all around gravy!!

My mother made this many times growing up, but every once in a while, she would add 8 oz. of shredded extra sharp cheddar cheese in place of half the milk, and just melt it down in the sauce. To die for! We much preferred it to the plain white gravy. But this one is good too.

I agree with other reviewers that using butter gives a better tasting gravy...as well as making sure to cook the roux long enough to avoid the floury taste. I have used this basic recipe for a lot of things. One of my kids favorites: Creamed chicken over biscuits. Make the gravy (using butter) according to this recipe. Add cooked chicken, peas, grated carrots, chopped onion (saute the carrots and onion separately then add) and use your preferred herbs--I usually add some basil and tarragon. Serve over biscuits. Great way to use up leftover turkey or chicken.

I think this must be an acquired taste.  Know lots of people who love biscuits and gravy.  Tried them at a local truck stop years ago, didn't love them.  Tried this recipe, and again didn't love them.  Maybe needs more flavor from pork fat?  Not my thing, I guess.

Very good when u don't have country gravy mix on hand.  One would normally have the ingredients for this recipe on hand.  It's even better when made in the pan with sausage drippings.

Vegetable oil. Pft! Bacon grease and sausage drippings, with a small amount of butter is the only way to go. Paula Deen would be proud. I also add about 1/2 tsp of onion powder. Honestly, the meat drippings are what makes it "country gravy". If you just want a white sauce, use butter, or, if you must, the vegetable oil.

Such a classic. I've been playing with variations for years. For a spicy version just use "hot" or "spicy" ground sausage...be sure to use the grease from the sausage for the roux. For texture I like finely ground sausage...sometimes I'll use the cuisinart once the sausage is cooked. It you don't have "hot" sausage just add red pepper flakes, salt and pepper. Soooo good with scambled eggs and biscuits!

I grew up with this as well, however - always did it with ham, bacon or sausage. If using lean sausage - or ham - you should add butter or margarine. If your gravy tastes floury - you need to cook the gravy longer (not the roux - this is only true of white gravy/sauces).  I like to bring it to a low boil a couple of times -- this is true when making any gravy with flour, or even corn start types to cook out the pastiness. If you cook the roux i/o the gravy longer - it will tend to brown & will darken the gravy & this one is best white.  I also add chopped up boiled egg to this breakfast gravy - which is how my mother did it.  My family & friends too - all love it this way.  I also sometimes add sliced fresh mushrooms when I'm cooking the sausage down - it may sound strange, but it is delicious.  It's even great for dinner (try adding tiny frozen peas)!

I had never made country gravy before today. It was pretty easy. I didn't use as much milk. I think I used between 3 1/4 - 3 1/2. I had to whisk it a whole bunch to make it smooth. But it was pretty tasty!

Any one who hasn't made this using corn meal instead of flour is missing a treat. Serve over a split, hot biscuit. Not sure about the measurements, as I do it by sight.

It is pretty simple and our family loves bisquits and gravy.  I used some sausage drippings, but added olive oil.  I dusted the entire top of the pan with sage, crushed garlic, and ground cayenne pepper. This is the best batch I have made yet!

Country gravy can be made any which way you like it. I love the stuff. My grandmother and mom made it and I do too. Chocolate gravy for biscuits was another fave. Sounds strange to northerners I guess.

I have made Country gravy for years, grew up on it but I use salted sweet cream butter and do not add salt listed in recipe. I make it this way to serve with steak, chicken, mashed potatoes, noodles etc. For breakfast I use the meat drippings and watch that it doesn't brown too much like the other reviews.

Good basic recipe but use bacon or sausage drippings not veg oil. Grandma and Mom differed a little in that G-Ma did not brown it as much as Mom did. Mom also used butter instead to make a "chocolate" gravy with hershey's cocoa served over white bread as a special treat. Not sure of the measurements and since she is 85 now, she can't remember. Maybe I will experiment sometime.

I make a similar gray on a regular basis, however, you only need about 2 to 3 Tbsp of oil, it will only have flavor if you use the fat from whatever meat you just fried ie: bacon, sausage, chicken, chicken fried steak etc.. This is a southern classic, oh as mentioned by another reviewer you can use 50/50 water and milk doesn't change the texture by much and still has the same great taste.

A good start but plain oil just doesn't cut it!  The best flavor comes from pan frying well floured c hops in some oil, remove and keep warm, add a little more oil, scraping up the "fryings" add seasoned flour and proceed from there.  Another hint, if it gets too thick thin with a little hot water as the more milk you add the thicker it will get on standing.

This is a great recipe, much like my mother made.  In those days there were no non-stick skillets, so a table fork was the best stirrer to mix the flour and grease (yes, bacon!)  We didn't measure anything --it's just important to use approximately the same amount of flour as grease, but be sure to have enough grease to make it smooth.  Then stir briskly as you add the milk (or milk and water). Turn the heat low.  When it thickens, turn the heat off, and add more liquid if needed for your consistency. My brother still expects biscuits and gravy and scrambled eggs when he comes to visit.

This is a great recipe, but for more flavor I use bacon drippings.  The key thing to always do is brown the flour. I do not brown for 10 minutes though, to me that is TOO brown..
Another recipe that was a favorite growing up was to brown hamburger with salt, pepper, garlic powder & onion powder, and then make gravy with it..serve over rice. YUM!

I guess I have to remember that country gravy is made in other parts of the country, not just the south. haha.  My Mamaw always used bacon or sausage grease to make her pan gravy and she "scorched" the flour for taste.  She also used evaported milk mixed with water to make it.  I just loved my Mamaw's pan gravy.

I had my grandmother's recipe written down, but it got lost when moving, and I couldn't remember how to make it the way she used to.  This recipe is the same way she used to do it!  Easy, and lump free!  Thank you for sharing this with the community!

This was my 1st attempt at white gravy and it was great! This recipe could not be any easier. I tweaked it a little by using bacon fat instead of vegetable oil for extra flavor.

This is a really good gravy!  I did have some bacon drippings left in a pan so I used that in place of some of the veg oil for more flavor.  Turned out nice and thick!  I did have some minor lumps but they did not affect the flavor or texture...probably my fault anyway.  Thanks!

I would give it 4.5 stars. I added some organic chicken bouillon paste and doubled the recipe.  The gravy was great for mashed potatoes. I also  used this as the base for a potato soup.  My boys loved this gravy and the soup was a hit too. My husband who is a gravy expert said "This is the best gravy I have ever had" so we will replace our old gravy recipe with this one.  Way to go Nancy!

yuckers-I followed the directions as written and added  a chicken cube. Horrible. Maybe I am spoiled by the taste of the packaged gravy. It looked like great gravy but when I tasted it, it tasted like flour pudding. Very bland and the taste of flour was too much! Thanks for the recipe, this is apparently not for me-not my cup of gravy :)

This makes a LOT! It was so delicious on our homemade chicken fried steaks. 4 out of 5 stars only because this was a little plainer than I was wanting--a very good base recipe, I think.

It was ok, but tasted too much like flour.  I even made it in the pan with the sausage drippings.  I will use this as a base next time, but will try mixing in some different seasoning to see if that makes a difference.

Fantastic!!  I used bacon grease instead of vegetable oil and it was perfect.  Great flavor, smooth consistency, and large quantity!  It was very easy and fast to make.  My husband and kids loved it!  I paired this with the Basic Biscuit recipe, eggs, and bacon and it made for a fabulous Saturday morning breakfast!

Nancy, I'm confused. I thought people everywhere inherited the ability to make gravy by genetic transfer. Here in Texas that is the case. This is the first time I ever saw a recipe for gravy. I just thought it was a natural ability that everyone was born with.  Your gravy is good. Chicken fried steak and your gravy is a part of the foundation of humanity in the Lone Star State.

This was very good. I've made it twice now. The first time, I didn't brown the flour mixture long enough and it tasted floury. This time, I was cooking chicken sausage. I planned on using the drippings from that to make the gravy, but it is so lean, there weren't any real drippings. Instead, I melted butter in the pan that I made the sausage and scraped up the residue from it. I let the flour mixture brown in it for 10 minutes and it was fabulous!

I'm giving this 3 stars because it's a good base recipe, and the instructions do yield a lump-free gravy. But unless you make changes, there will be practically no flavor.  I scaled this down to 2 servings (which made plenty), used 2 tblsp oil and 1 tblsp of real butter, used vegetable stock in addition to milk for flavor, much more salt and pepper, and a bit of Creole seasoning. My result was a very tasty gravy- we'll be eating the leftovers with biscuits and sausage for breakfast.

I made this and it is much better than the store bought package mix.  I wanted to make it more interesting so I added diced ham and a little bit of fresh Parmesan cheese...it was delicious on top of fried chicken.

Great recipe. Although I think it should be made with butter instead of oil. I tried it with oil and you could taste the flour. Anyhow I looked for something easy and quick to make and this recipe delivered.

Super easy! I'd never made country gravy before, and always was a little intimidated... this was super simple! I also used butter instead of oil, added a pinch of garlic powder, probably a hefty teaspoon of dried basil (I add it to almost everything) & halved the recipe since it was just for two of us.  It was great!

I have never made country fried steak before so I decided to try and needed a gravy recipe and found this one. I used a stick of real butter instead of the oil and I used a little bit more salt & pepper and it turned out awesome. The consistancy was perfect. Not too thick or thin. The amount was great with extra left over for more mashed potatoes.

I changed the servings to two. I used butter and seasoned the flour first. I ended up adding garlic powder, onion powder, Lawry's seasoning salt, and Mrs. Dash table seasoning.

I forgot the gravy mix at the grocery store this morning so I decided we would have to go out again (ugh). My daughter found this recipe and it was fantastic. I will never buy packaged breakfast gravy again, although next time I will use bacon grease for more flavor.

This was a great save for me because my husband wanted biscuits and gravy and the type of sausage he wanted did not make a good grease (he likes the links.  This was perfect.  I did make it with oil and made sure I let it cook longer before adding the milk (10 minutes to the T lol) This turned out great I will be using this recipe again.  Thanks!

This was great. I scaled the recipe down because it was just for two people but it still made enough for us to use twice. I also changed the oil to butter. I just figured it would have a nicer flavor. Some reviewers suggested that you should use bacon or sausage grease and I agree...if you are using it for a breakfast or biscuit topping. We had ours with country fried steak and honestly I don't think the grease would have made any difference to how good it tasted with the steak. Either way, this is a good gravy, it passed my husband and he is horribly finicky so it HAS to be good.

I just LOVE this gravy!!  I added meat scrapings and drippings to my gravy.  It was so good!!  Now I know how to make the best gravy for any kind of meat. (chicken, sausage, chops, etc.) It makes plenty for a good size meal.   Thanks so much!! I'm glad I have this recipe.

This is a good starter gravy base, but it requires more ingredients than listed. If you make this as is, it  tastes like oil and flour. This recipe needs work.

No matter what I did to this recipe I couldn't make it taste good. It was so floury and pretty thick. Also, it just didn't have a good flavor.

I needed a quick country gravy recipe and thought to try this one...I used the oil and I have to say it was not very good.  It didn't taste floury, just too oily.  I will try it again but with bacon greese or butter.  Should've read the reviews before cooking.

This gravy was horrible! Not at all what country gravy should taste like. It's more like flour and oil tasting gravy if you ask me. I even added sausage grease to give it some flavor, and yet it was still plain. You would have to be a mad scientist to get this recipe to taste like real country gravy. I picked this recipe from all the fab reviews on it. Anyone from the south that said this was what "real country gravy tastes like" should be ashamed.

My Southern hubby says this is what country gravy should taste like!  Only change I made was to substitute butter for the oil.  I serve it with CASSJW's "Chicken Fried Chicken" also from this site.  So good.

Country gravy at its best!!!  Of course I used sausage drippings in place of the oil, but other than that I followed it to a "T".  I've always been intimidated by making gravy for some reason, but I got it right the first time around!

Since I know what it’s like to be poor as dirt in Kentucky, this is the recipe we ate everyday.  No matter what meat was cooked, we took the drippings and used them instead of the vegetable oil in this recipe.  We were too poor to get fat, so it was health food to us.

First of all, this recipe makes a ton, so be sure to cut it in half if you're not planning to serve at least six people (when they say six servings they mean six servings). Second, per other reviews, I also agree that butter or margarine would be better than oil, so I think I will do that next time. Third, I think it was a little bland, so I think I may add garlic powder and onion powder next time. Overall, it is a great starter recipe for country gravy, and it is both cheap and easy to make, much cheaper than buying a packet of gravy. This is something I will make again and again! Thanks for sharing.

i would give this a five but i only give it a four because with a few tweeks, it can be awesome! i used bacon greese in place of the oil, and didnt cook the rue as long cuz i am impatient lol. it still works out fine tho. i also add a little bit of butter and more milk then called for. i also cook bacon and cut it up and add it. it is soooo good! one day i didn't know what to make, so i made this with those changes. thank you so much. when i dont know what to make, i turn to this. yum!

The recipe didn't work out so great for me. So in a desperate last minute attempt to save it, I decided to use Montreal Steak Spice, black bean sauce as the flavor adders, and water instead of milk to help thin it out. 

I also added a little minced garlic. All and all it worked out pretty good in the end, although not before the changes to the recipe.

Everyone is definitely right about using bacon grease instead of oil or butter, otherwise it doesn't have that great country gravy flavor we're all looking for. But to give it that little something extra, my granny always used half evaporated milk and half regular milk...since gravy is not rich or fattening enough :)

I had been looking for a country gravy recipe that didn't require sausage drippings, since I don't always have that on hand when I want to make biscuits and gravy.  But maybe it's better if you do.  This didn't have the greatest flavor, in fact it was quite bland.  But since I altered the recipe *using 1/4 cup veg. oil & 1/4 cup butter, and then only 1/2 cup flour) I will give it 4-star in the hopes that the original way was more flavor and because it made a nice thick gravy which I do like.  I think using drippings or some other flavoring would make this a great gravy.

This was awesome.  I diced up some ham and stirred that in to my roux and let it cook for a while before I started adding in the milk.  It turned out absolutely delicious on top of some biscuits.  It was not too thick or thin.  Thanks!

This was great, thanks!  We followed the advice of one of the reviewers on the roux and it turned out nicely, thank you.  This is a great basic recipe that you can add many things to: sausage drippings, used oil from frying vegetables, etc.  We used the oil from frying vegetables route.  It turned out nicely, although it had a light brown color instead of the traditional white of country gravy.

very good gravy for not having any meat fat in it. Though the secret to a perfect gravy is equal amounts of fat and flour so I would suggest using the same amounts.  Also I added more pepper and some salt.  It would have been much to bland for our taste if I hadn't.  That is just my preference though.  Overall a good gravy.

Excellent Gravy!

I thinned mine down a bit and made creamed eggs and toast which was a huge hit!  I also made this alongside some fried chicken and mashed potatoes (with more pepper and a touch of garlic in the gravy).  Wonderful recipe!

This was good, but did not use oil. I used bacon grease, and butter. I fried for pieces of bacon, crumbled them, and added them to the recipe. It turned out great. Im going to try sausage next time.

This is exactly what I was looking for. A gravy mix that is so easy and so good! I added a teaspoon of garlic and bacon drippings for taste. The proportions were perfect and you can substitute just about any drippings to make it just the way you like it. This was great, thank you!

I have always been terrible at gravy, until I tried this recipe, YAY!  My husband loved it and he's definitely a gravy man.  I made chicken fried chicken, for dinner, and used the oil from that rather than plain oil.  This would also be delish with the drippings from sausage or bacon.  Thanks so much... the proportions are spot on and I've always had trouble with that.

I just happened to fix some Biscits and my husband loves gravy with them so I tried this Recipe and He loved it. I only needed 2 servings and it turned out being easy to make even after it calculated it out for me.  Just needed to add some more milk to thin it out but very easy to make

I had tried many times to cook gravy based off of memory and inevitably I missed something small every time I made it so it didn't turn out quite right.  I substituted bacon grease for this recipe and it came out perfectly!  Thanks for sharing!

I made this gravy last week to serve with mashed potatoes and fried chicken legs.  It was delish!  I was so proud of myself because I'm not the best gravy maker, but this receipe saved me!  My boyfriend loved it.  Tonight we are having biscuts and sausage gravy for supper, so I will use this receipe for my gravy again.

I needed a gravy for my dinner, and had about 10 minutes before my husband came home from work. I found this recipe, read some of the reviews,and had everything I needed to make it.It was extremly easy, and very good. My husband and our 2 kids loved it. I'm going to use it when I make breakfast, but put some sausage in it, bet it will be really good.

This gravy was really good. I used it for a vegetarian pot pie. I added half the amount of milk and instead used vegetable broth for the rest of the needed liquid. I also used butter instead of oil, cause I like butter. all-in-all very good!

This was good. I used sausage drippings instead of the veg oil, and a dash of ground sage. I used about 5 cups of milk because it kept getting thicker as I waited on the biscuits to bake. I absolutely will use this recipe again.

This was good, next time I will use pan drippings from bacon or sausage, because the flavor was not quite right, I ended up adding more salt and pepper to cover up the vegetable oil flavor. However it wasn't lumpy, and it wasn't too thick either, so I think with a little bit of tweaking this could be an excellent white gravy recipe.

Excellent! I quickly made this while heating up frozen breaded chicken tenders. I won't buy packaged gravy for the ease anymore only for the fat content.

WOW! This is my first time at attempting to make gravy and it was so easy and YUMMY! I will definately make this again. It was a hit with hubby and the kids with fried chicken strips! The key is to gradually put the flour and milk in. Thanks for such a easy and yummy gravy recipe.

We loved this recipe. It was amazingly easy and if you follow the directions exactly you are good to go.  I have never made this type gravy before and am SO excited that I now know how. This would be great on bisuits too but we used with fried chicken and mashed potatoes.   Great job on this recipe.  Try it, you will find it is very easy to do and takes  just a few minutes.

The first time I made it I browned the flour and the gravy came out very bad. After I threw it out I made it again and this time didn't brown the flour. Gravy came out perfect.

I tried this recipe for supper last night. It was delicious and was very easy to make. I am going to use it again to see if it was pure luck that it wasn't lumpy :) I am not very good at non lumpy gravy unless its from a package LOL. This gravy came out smooth and my two boys went back for seconds it was so good! Thanks for this super recipe!

I loved this recipe!  My family had a huge get together and i made enough for like 40 people and everyone asked me how i made it.  That is a big deal in my family because only a few people know how to make gravy!

This is a great, simple recipe.  My husband thought this was the best breakfast gravy  he'd ever had.  Just because it was there, I left the bacon drippings in the skillet, and added a corresponding lesser amount of oil to the pan to make the gravy, which added a nice flavor, I think. What a great recipe--thanks!

This is an easy gravy recipe.  Though I'm the only one that has tried this in my family, I will definitely make it for them soon.  My first skillet of gravy was a little thick so I added more milk to it and more pepper cause I like it spicy.  Thanks for such a good recipe!

I'm not sure I would say this is perfect enough to rate 5 stars, but it is good for what I needed it for.  It is Thanksgiving and my vegetarian child wanted some gravy.  Most of the veg gravies I have made were a huge disappointment.  This one was passable, and I will use the recipe again.  I might, next time, divide it and add some chopped hard boiled eggs and some chipped beef for the non-veg family members to eat over toast and everyone will have something.  This does remind me of the gravy for creamed chipped beef my mother used to make, but she used butter.

I literally have nothing in the house but a can of biscuits that's been in there forever, cashew milk, course black pepper and Wondra. I looked up this recipe because there  are very few ingredients in it. It's great if you want to tweak a recipe if you have those extra things but I absolutely loved this recipe as is. It got me out of a conundrum of what I was going to eat until payday, tomorrow. Thank you for the recipe!

My daughter always makes the gravy after I make the chicken and potatoes or rice! She does a wonderful job! It is really good! I don’t use the salt, because I use the oil from the chicken and it’s already seasoned! Other than that I had her make the recipes as it reads!

This recipe is excellent, cooking the oil and flour together until brown really gives it a slow cooked meaty flavor. I added sausage just before serving over biscuits, yummy!

I tried it over some mashed potatoes and it was delicious. I'm actually surprised with how easy this was to make. My only real complaint would be with the amount of pepper required. It adds a nice touch but  that much pepper is a little overwhelming. I would probably try a teaspoon of pepper rather than a tablespoon. Other than that, this is a recipe worth trying. Just have some sort of container ready as this recipe makes quite a bit and you will have leftovers unless you're feeding a lot of people.

I made it. Came out great. As a single guy I've learned to cook for myself. I did change one thing. I substituted regular salt for JD's Bacon Salt. Adds just the right amount of flavor and kicks it up a notch ;)

I followed the directions exactly for a morning breakfast of biscuits n gravy, fried eggs, bacon & homemade blueberry sausage. Everything was absolutely delicious, but the gravy turned out horrible (To say the least). Each bite of it was like eating a spoon full of flour. I can't believe this recipe has such a high rating. Even adding a little butter & garlic powder to it like another reviewer suggested couldn't help my skillet of trash gravy. I ended up feeding the rest to my dogs. At least they seemed to love it

SWITCH OUT VEG OIL FOR BUTTER. I make this a lot to go with country fried steak. As long as you use butter instead of vegetable oil, it's a simple white gravy recipe. Works well. I cut in half as it is a lot.

Love this recipe. It turned out great for me. I did add a little bit of bacon grease I had left over but that’s the only change I made and only because I had it on hand.

This is a magnificent base! So I took everyone’s recommendations and made like a sub breed of gravy. 


1/2 butter 1/2 bacon grease.
Adding  Venison sausage and a pinch of garlic.

So delicious! I gave three because the recipe would have probably been bad without everyone’s input.

This recipe was my first step into making my own gravy. If you follow the directions exactly you will get a very nice light brown colored gravy with tons of flavor. Here are some tips that help me out each time I make it.

- Don't get the pan too hot - 
If you heat the oil up too hot the roux will start to stick and burn quickly. You will smell a burning aroma and the roux will be difficult to mix smoothly.

- Make sure to season the roux generously-
Don't be shy on the salt and pepper for the roux. You should start to smell a sweet smell as you mix in more seasoning and continue stirring. For me this is largely what conceals the flour flavor and really makes the gravy taste great in the end. The roux IMO is the most important part of any gravy recipe. If you think you've over seasoned it - you probably haven't. Just remember that you are diluting it with several cups of milk which greatly alters the concentration of the seasoning.

-Don' t cook the rue too long OR too short -
Sounds strange, but if you cook it too long you will get a very strong flavor that may be overkill. On the other side of things if you don't cook it long enough it will taste like flour which isn't any better. I find that cooking it until it starts to change color and smell is the best indicator. When the rue starts to brown slightly and starts to smell sweet then you've cooked all of the flour. Anything further than this will results in a stronger "steak gravy" taste. 

Just another tip - If you're usi

Make it almost daily, with most meats I cook.  It's a great topping for almost anything.   Except that when it's done this way,  you learn to adjust quantities...  Each meal stands alone,  because  I am alone, and cook for one.   I am hard please, LOL.
And, there should never be leftovers, the pans should be easy to clean, and ready to go for next meal.  My dishwasher helps...
But have found that a quantity in the fridge for biscuits or toast, may be helpful,  but that begs the question, 'Is it Fridge or Freezer friendly?'   Found no answers here, so will be experimenting, and will let ya know

Grandma then Mom and now me have all followed the bones of this recipe. Bacon grease raises it to Southern levels of fat and calories; be sure to stir frequently. Adjust spices to taste, but don’t skimp on the black pepper!

I've never really had to cook for a lot of people cause I haven't had people to cook for, but this was actually very very nice, and the picky boy ate it! Thank God. :') I know if flour is used in a roux or whatever that it needs to be cooked longer to take away the flour taste, so after doing so, this gravy turned out perfect over sausage patties and rice. I'll definitely make this again :D

I've been making milk gravy all of my life. (1). It's always better if you use bacon fat. Of course, you have to cook off the flour or it's going to taste like flour...duh! Have patience, stick with it, keep stirring and don't go lollygaggin' somewhere else. (2). It's even better if cooked in an iron skillet! (3). You can add meat to it but then it isn't milk gravy, it's sausage/meat gravy. (4). There is nothing better than milk gravy poured over a homemade biscuit! (5). Enjoy it while you're young because once you get past 50 all the health people just harp and harp at you about calories, cholesterol, and high blood pressure! (6). Don't grow up.....it's a trap!

I did it a little differently, I used unsalted butter instead of oil, and I used 2 cups half and half and 2 cups of milk. I also added more salt and pepper than the recipe called for. It turned out very good.

It doesn't have a lot of flavor, I added 
about 1 tbsp of garlic powder, 1/2 tbsp Lawry's, and I also added double the pepper. We mixed it with breakfast sausage that we seasoned with all the above plus smoked peppers and sage.

It tastes like milk and flour.    

had to add a lot of spices and such to get a good taste, but it did create a good gravy look. 

so if you are taking pictures of food rather than eating it, this is the way to go.

Recipe as written would only be 3 stars, but after I made a few changes, I made a 5 star gravy. First I replaced the oil with butter. Butter has so much more flavor than vegetable oil could ever hope for. I also reduced the flour to slightly less than 2/3 cups. I did cook the flour and butter roux for 4-5 minutes, but for me, I did not want my flour to turn brown. I like my country white gravy to be just that...white. I also used chicken, 'Better than Bouillon' base. I used about 2 teaspoons of the base. After stirring in, then I tasted to see if I needed to add any salt as the recipe calls for. I salted to my liking.  My gravy had really great flavor, so smooth and velvety,  that went deliciously with the Chicken Fried Steak that I made for dinner. My family really enjoyed it..

Good recipe to go off of!
Listen to everyone else. Make sure to simmer the flour, salt, and pepper in oil for atleast 10 minutes. I did it for 15 to make sure the flour was cooked and constantly whisked at low temp to prevent burning.
This recipe makes a massive amount of gravy so I halved everything.
1/4c vegetable oil
3/8c all-purpose flour
Salt and Pepper
2c milk
Since we aren't fans of plain vegetable oil, I substituted it with 1/8c unsalted sweet cream butter and 1/8c coconut oil. I also used 1/4c whole wheat flour and 1/8c all-purpose flour. My subs made it still taste fantastic! Husband liked the substitutions I made.
Although, I did use 2% milk. Im sure if I used a full fat milk that it would help enhance the flavor of the gravy.

Fantastic.  As an avid hunter sharing the sport with my son, I needed a good southern gravy recipe to use with the squirrels my son got recently.  Using this recipe but substituting bacon grease for the vegetable oil as another person recommended made for delicious squirrel gravy and biscuits on a cold Sunday morning.

This was the first time I tried making country gravy from scratch and it turned out very well. I didn't expect the amount of gravy that I ended up with so I'll probably halve the recipe the next time I make it. I modified the recipe a little since I don't like to use cooking oil as a food ingredient. I used olive oil instead but I think the next time I make it I'm going to use butter.

I replaced Vegetable Oil with Extra Virgin Olive Oil. I recommend if you are doing this is to use less Olive Oil than you would Vegetable Oil. It might be better.

Great recipe, we used bacon grease rather than Vegetable oil. 
Poured it over homemade biscuits and it was a hit.

To look at it, it looks like it should be delicious!  However, the taste is far, far from it.  It takes like oiled flour, and I added more salt and pepper than it called for.

This tasted like wet flour. We added sausage to try to salvage it, but it still tasted like wet flour.  We couldn't eat it, no flavor.

I make this gravy all the time. I put sausage in it for biscuits and gravy, and I put pepper in it for chicken fried steak. It's definitely a family favorite.

It tastes like flour and oil. 

I recommend tripling the pepper, adding garlic salt and onion powder, and a tad bit of crushed red pepper. Even then, it’s not the best.. you can add sausage to it and it’s a bit better.

It was good and will use this recipe again! I used Olive oil, whole wheat flour, coconut milk, salt, pepper and garlic powder. It definitely needs the garlic powder to give it some kind of taste. The consistency was nice and thick.

Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out just tasting like flour. I would highly recommend using a recipe using butter or meat drippings instead of oil.

Ok so the gravy turned out great but holy cow it made ALOT of gravy. So I think the recipe should have called for a couple table spoons of oil not 1/2 A CUP! As soon as I started adding milk everything went bananas, it started growing, and had to dump 1/2 of it to keep the pan from overflowing. Way more than 6 servings. Also no need to brown for 10 minutes! At medium heat 4-5 min was plenty. Good luck! Hope you can find a use for 1 gallon of gravy!

This is a good basic gravy recipe.  I had to use powdered milk, but it turned out well.  Adding sausage would be a good way to change it up.

Great, easy. I halved the recipe for 2-3 people. 1/4 cup vegetable oil, 6 TBSP flour, salt and pepper to taste, and 2 cups of milk.

I’m so glad that we ran out of the prepackaged gravy mix. We were out of groceries and had already started making biscuits and gravy when we realized that we were out of gravy mix. This was a very easy to make recipe and very similar to the rue base that I use for my potato soup.  I made it exactly as written with the addition of a pinch onion powder and a tablespoon of bacon bits.  My husband said that it was very good and he really doesn’t like trying new foods. Thank you for the great recipe. I will definitely add this one to my recipe box!

This is a very simple but yummy recipe. Please don't use oil unless you have nothing else. I browned my sausage and added the drippings to butter to get a 1/2 cup. I also always add 1/4 tsp. whit pepper. YUM!!

Great and versatile recipe. Easy to make and delicious. I used it as a base adding a touch of Worcester sauce, garlic and soy sauce. This is a keeper.

It's a very basic recipe, one that I changed up a bit. I used drippings from the sausage instead of vegetable oil and cornstarch instead of flour. It turned out perfect! Even the pickiest eater in my house said it was delicious and talked about how good it was for 2 days.

My daughter and I made this recipe to put on waffles.  This recipe brings back memories of the gravy a  friend's mom used to make.  I'd go to their home to help bale hay and there would be biscuits, fried chicken and this gravy!

This is good but needs some kind of flavor. Instead of so much veg oil add some bacon/sausage grease. Even some chunks!

While technically gravy this recipe needs a lot of help. Tested just like milky flour. Added way more salt and pepper, didn't help much. Look elsewhere

I love this one, I’ve been doing this one for years now. One of the first recipes that I used from this app. It’s great for biscuits and gravy, fried chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy. I also use it for Mac and cheese. Mix it in with the macaroni then add your shedded cheese. Beautifully creamy Mac and cheese.

It's a good base recipe that's easy to alter to suit your tastes. This turned out OK as written, but with some changes this would be five stars. I use a little bacon grease and butter instead of oil, and swap out seasoned salt for plain salt. I typically add sausage crumbles too.

I added some garlic powder after tasting just to give it a bit more flavor.  Then I dumped in a bunch of diced ham to have over mashed potatoes.  :) For those complaining about the flour taste, you need to simmer it longer before putting in the milk.  That is a very important step.

The oil was soaked very quickly. In the end, it tasted like flour and was not good. If I make this again, it will need some sausage or bacon to give it flavor

This was very simple and came out perfect. I did have to add a tad bit flour to thicken it up but it was absolutely delicious. I added some garlic salt per other reviews but other than that followed the recipe as it is. My husband and I both agreed we will definitely be making this again!

Simple ingredients were nice, as we don't always have bacon/sausage on-hand.  The oil seemed to take forever to absorb, and it took a long time to thicken up.  Tried a sprinkle of Garlic Garlic to it.  Flavor was decent enough to where I would probably make it again, as long as I allowed enough time to make it.

The gravy is fantastic. This  is my "go to" base. I use real butter and use 3/4 to 1/2 as much when I brown up some sausage crumbles for biscuits and gravy in the AM. I like to use two teaspoons of pepper and two teaspoons of red pepper flakes for an extra kick.

I considered using a dash of garlic powder but something tells me it might not be as good for B&G as it would be for a dinner meal.

Great gravy.

Simple gravy recipe and a great consistency! The flavor is more bland than when you use bacon or sausage fat but that's to be expected. All in all this is a great, quick go-to recipe and we will be using this for our homemade biscuits anytime I don't feel like cooking a batch of meat to go with them.

Absolutely love this recipe. Of course I use butter instead of oil but follow the rest of the recipe to a T and always comes out perfect. Sometimes my mixture does not want to mix with the milk and when that happens I just whisk it really hard and it breaks up and mixes. I also use a very large amount of pepper in it because my husband likes it really peppery. Best, gravy, ever. A staple for us.

It is a good starter recipe. Very versatile. I used the bacon grease from cooking bacon instead of vegetable oil, and it gave it the perfect flavor. I also added a tablespoon of chili powder and it gave it a nice kick.

I made the recipe with butter replacing the oil, it comes out much better that way. Used the gravy for SOS instead of biscuits and gravy and it was great with ground beef added in. Mmmm. My boyfriend is currently lying on the couch with an extremely contented look on his face so job = well done!

Honestly, this a quick and simple recipe that's very easy to follow. It really is great for serving over biscuits. The only difference is that I added in a pound of browned ground beef instead of crumbled sausage. Either way, it makes for a great meal that's easy to cook and very good for breakfast and dinner.

The gravy thickened up really well and had a great consistency, but it had no flavor at all. I added more pepper, salt, even some garlic powder.

Awesome basic recipe with minor tweaks. Half cup butter to half cup flour, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp pepper, cook on medium for at least 10 minutes (stirring not burning), gradually stir in 4 cups of milk; one cup at a time. Add additional salt & sausage drippings and viola! Perfect gravy! This one's a keeper!

Very happy to find a country gravy recipe without meat or meat grease in it.  Hard to find.  Thank you!  A dribble of Worchestershire Sauce or Liquid Smoke gives it a little bit of a meaty flavor for the more 'casual' vegetarian.

This is the best and easiest white gravy I have ever made. I did change a few things as other reviews did to. I used a stick of butter instead of the oil and add a pinch of garlic powder to it. It turned out great, everyone loved it.

Came out great... I used I cant believe it's not butter instead of Veggie oil and also added turkey sausage and a bit of cayenne pepper. Great value making it yourself instead of store prepared packages.

I'd never made country gravy before.  I wanted a recipe that didn't have sausage in it or bacon or sausage fat as a main ingredient.   I doubted that I'd find a recipe, but here one is and it worked perfect.  It was much easier and quicker than I thought it would be.  I took another's suggestion and used butter instead of the oil.  It turned out very good.  Much more tasty than those packets that you add water to and not much harder.  I also added only 1/2 cup of flour.  The salt with the salted butter may be too salty for some.  I recommend adding just 1/2 teaspoon at first then adjust according to taste.

I followed the exact instructions and It needed to be doctors because the end result of following the instructions your gravy will taste like flour. Next time I will use butter instead of oil.

Excellent recipe for a simple white pepper gravy! It tastes very similar to my Mamaw's recipe. As others have noted, you MUST cook the flour and oil mixture long enough. I cooked mine for about 6 minutes on slightly higher heat, but while constantly stirring, and had no floury taste at all but it was perfectly browned. Don't worry if it looks darker than you expect; the milk will whiten it right up. Also, make sure to move the pan off the heat when first adding the milk, and whisk it constantly, and after putting about half the milk in and stirring it smooth, slide back to the heat. This will keep the milk from scorching to the bottom of the pan. I'm going to try bacon grease or butter next time, but using canola oil this morning still turned out beautifully. No oily or floury taste at all!

Made this recipe this morning for Biscuits & Gravy. since there are only 2 of us I cut it in half ( 3/4 cup flour = 6 tablespoons ) . Since he likes a little more kick than I do, he handed some Cajun seasoning to his serving. Thanks for the recipe!

Nancy, thank you so much for sharing! My mother and grandmother always made the gravies and I did not pay as much attention as I should have. I am VERY fond of gravy and am now trying to pass the art on to my children. When I read a recipe like this, I always translate OIL to be whatever fat you prefer and have available. I echo the advice of many other reviewers to make sure you thoroughly cook the roux (flour mixture) for best results. I like to watch Diners, Drive-Ins , and Dives. So many of the cooks on the show confess that they use the same base for several of their dishes..... THIS is one of those base recipes! You can add any other seasonings or meats to it and use it for almost anything you like.

Very nice recipe, my dad suggested bacon fat when you add the milk as well and it gives the gravy a charred taste ontop of some mashed potatoes, really nice.

I really enjoyed this recipe. Only thing was that both me and my boyfriend agreed it turned out way too peppery. Will definitely use again. But probably use less pepper.

This was such a great base recipe!  I did add 1 lb sausage.
Then
For a healthier version I tried making it with applesauce instead of the oil (yummy substitute!) and skim milk and reduced fat sausage.  It was yummy too!

This was very easy to make. It thickened a lot faster then I expected and I had to use more ammo then posted. I ended up using some cayenne pepper to spice it up and it turned orange lol. But it does taste awesome.

When finished it came out to thick so I added more milk same problem. I repeatedly added more milk and It never thinned out. No looking like mashed potatoes I went to taste it and did not care for it at all.

The recipe is bland and not as rich. Use butter instead..sausage grease/bacon grease and butter is better. I also added more milk than the recipe called for as well as some garlic powder, onion powder, thyme, and a dash of chili powder. Added some crushed bacon or you can add crumbled sausage. Definitely a good base recipe for you to design as your own.

This recipe is identical to my grandmother's -- except she never measures *anything* when she cooks, I don't even know if she owns measuring cups. So even though she taught me to make gravy, mine was always hit or miss because I've never been good at eyeballing the right amounts of anything. I've made this recipe probably six times since I found it, and I've had perfect gravy every single time. Thank you so much for this. :)

Edit: To anyone who tastes flour, I thought this went without saying, but you're supposed to make gravy in the same pan you fried up bacon or sausage with, using the leftover grease as a base for your gravy to give it the right flavor...

I've made a lot of gravies, but never just a white country gravy. This was so good and so easy. I will use this recipe over and over again. The only thing I added was a little garlic powder.

That was way too much flour even with the added milk, no matter how long i cooked it, all i tasted was flour. It was pretty unbearable. I found a different recipe, that suggest 4 tablespoons which turned out much better.

I made this gravy today with biscuits and fried bacon.  As other cooks commented I used the bacon grease instead of the oil to give it great flavor. (As all good southern cooks do!)   I also added a little more salt and pepper to give it a more savory taste, as I prefer.  I also added a little bit more water to loosen up the gravy a bit.  I always taste as I go after adding in spices to make sure it is balanced.  I love country gravy as I grew up with my mom making it, along with my all-time  favorite tomato gravy!!  
Mom would be proud!!  :-)

I would definitely make this again! I was going to make biscuits and gravy when i forgot to by gravy so i searched up this website and found this easy recipe! p.s to make it thinner wait till you are ready to eat it to add milk or it will keep thickening up over the heat. over all I loved it!

I LOVE this gravy and the easy to follow instructions. It is much lighter tha a sausage gravy and i like it much better on chicken fried steak. However, i had a mishap when cooking a dinner for 20-25 people on my husband's birthday. I had some powdered sugar in one of my kitchen cannisters instead of flour. Embarrasing, but the guests kindly said that they thought it was a new sauce. Still, the gravy looked beautiful. I do add lots of pepper and sometimes a little granulated garlic and/or parsley for color.

This was very bland. I wish I used butter, not oil. There wasn't enough salt or pepper. Needed garlic and onion powders to perk up the plain flavor.

Great recipe other than the fact that there was absolutely no flavor! I had to add a lot more salt and pepper. I also added some fried onion and Worcestershire sauce and garlic salt.

I added a chicken bullion cube, onion powder, garlic powder, parsley, more salt and pepper.  Then I added a couple tablespoons of the juice and teriyaki sauce that I cooked the pork chops in. That made it palatable. I guess I could have added butter as well.  I may have "browned" the oil/flour mixture too long.  Recipe says 10 minutes, I did it 8 and it was a bit too long.  I'll try 6-7 next time.

I made this as directed.   It was not terrible, but it lacked flavor.   I would use this recipe again as a template, but would use butter or bacon grease (that I have saved in the freezer) in place of oil.    Consistency was right on.

Ok this is a great all around recipe for a basic cream gravy. As one review stated if it taste of flour you are not cooking it long enough. For richer flavor instead of oil butter is OK, sausage / bacon grease even better. If not cooking bacon / sausage my mom always used lard. If pan frying a steak add lard to left over grease / meat drippings and continue as recipe instructs. I will make one comment some will disagree with. Keep your darn Garlic for cuisine not labeled southern! I love Garlic but on basic white / creak gravy you gotta be kidding me. Salt, Pepper, meat drippings nothing else needed. You can use cream, evaporated milk + water, chicken / turkey stock,even plain water if it is all you have. Any combination of liquids can be tried for that special secret recipe of your own. WE always had a tight budget and gravy was an inexpensive way to add calories / fat to make kids full and satisfied. Fat is good in moderation! Besides it taste great.

Really good and easy peasy!  Threw in some leftover crumbled up sausage which will always make it 'mo betta'!! It was my first attempt at white gravy, and it turned out really well. Thumbs up from the FAM, so it must be alright.

I don't have to make this recipe to know not to use oil. Butter, at the bare minimum. But, sausage drippings are the best. However, I always save my bacon drippings, so I would use that. But, I do want to say thank you for the basic recipe. I love biscuits and gravy!

I've never had the best luck using vegetable oil for this, as it seems to me as though unless it's super fresh the taste goes off. Nothing nastier than rancid veggie oil. However, rather than butter what I've found does work well is butter-flavored shortening. Of course bacon, burger or sausage grease is still the best!, but shortening is a good fall-back. I've had good luck adding either a bit of garlic, sugar and sage (sausage hint) or cayenne pepper, as well. Normally I'll also be browning some finely diced onion with the flour.

I have made this often and it is great!!  Really a great recipe. Just FYI though, I didn't have butter or oil this last time and so tried using olive oil. Let me tell you this is not a good Idea. It wasn't bad but It certainly wasn't what I was hoping for. Butter is by far the way to go.

This is how I was taught as a young girl in the South, also. Butter, or bacon or sausage dripping are a must. If you are counting fat grams or calories...skip the gravy. The flour taste you must cook the grease flour mixture for a few minutes to reduce that flavor. I, too prefer meat grease over the butter and never use other oils.

This looked like country gravy, but tasted nothing like it.  In fact, didn't taste like anything, even after more salt and pepper.  There's so much you can salt and pepper it though.

I honestly don't think this has a good flavor to it at all, I agree maybe with bacon grease would be better, but the flavor is very bland.

The only change I made (because of other comments) was to use butter instead of oil for the roux. It was edible, but I would not say it was enjoyable to eat. I agree with some others that the flour taste was too strong (yes, I cooked the butter and flour 'til it browned). Also, the amount of pepper didn't seem anywhere near enough. I was taught with other gravies to use equal parts oil and flour, so I will try it again using 1/2 cup flour, and figure out how much pepper I think it should have. I will post my results soon!

UPDATE: I reduced the flour to 1/2 cup and incresed the pepper to 1 1/2 tsp. which was enough to satisfy some. It was MUCH better. Some family members still added more pepper.

TIP: If it gets too thick by the time you are ready to eat, whisk in some more milk to get the consistency you want. Taste again to see if you want more salt and/or pepper.

I'm always experimenting with gravy recipes because I love gravy on almost everything. This recipe was very good, fast and easy! I did use the broth from chicken noodle soup instead of oil, but I personally like  the chicken taste to my gravy. Very yummy!

I thought it was horrible. The awful taste of vegetable oil is lingering in my mouth. I thought it was just me, but no, I did everything how the recipe said.  Next time I'll use a recipe with butter or just wait until I fry some meat.

Really yummy.  I added a pound of chicken sausage.  First crumbled and cooked the sausage, then added the butter (instead of oil) until melted. Make sure you cook the flour mixture after you add it.  Just let it bubble and brown for a few minutes so you avoid the flour taste.

This was my first attempt at country gravy. This recipe was so easy to follow. The gravy was smooth and creamy. I did add a little ground sausage, per my husbands request, it was really good. We both thought it needed a little more seasoning, but that is just personal preference. Will make this again...and again!

I tried this recipe but I halved it.  I had no plain oil so I used half butter and half olive oil.  But followed the instructions, and it came out great!  We even mistakenly bought fat free milk, but it still thickened properly.  I will be usin this again and again.  Thank you for a good recipe.

This recipe is a fantastic base recipe for country gravy and my whole family loved it! Because there was a strong flour taste using the exact recipe, I used the "most helpful positive review" tips from Janine (added garlic, a dash of extra pepper plus some dried beef for extra flavoring).

This was VERY good! My husband is sooooo picky and even he loved it. The only alteration I made was I added extra pepper because my husband and I are big fans of peppery gravy. The only thing I might add next time is some sausage.

It was good.  I was getting sick of all the reviewers talking about it needing bacon or sausage grease!! YUCK!  Some of us don't eat meat (pork, specifically, for me) and I was looking for a recipe that I could still get my gravy for biscuits.  The only issue I had was not listening to others and adding the milk too fast.  I had little flour balls, but it didn't affect the flavor any.  Anyway, good first try, would make again.

Really good but I sub butter for the veggie oil as others have mentioned.  Fabulous on biscuits.  Make this right before serving so it isn't a gloppy mess.

Great Recipe! Perfect for everything from country fried pork chops to biscuits and gravy. Up until my divorce I used one recipe that has been in the family for over 100 years. However, I lost all my recipes in the divorce. I have tried many since, repeating them to try and figure out why they tasted like flour or were too, salty, or lumpy. Again, great recipe.

Like other reviewers said...you really need to use sausage or bacon drippings instead of vegetable oil. If you have neither, use butter! I also used TONS more salt and pepper than called for in the recipe, otherwise it is just too bland.

This was an excellent basic country gravy recipe that I used with country fried steak. It makes a lot so I had some left over to put over biscuits later too.

I just made this for the first time, it turned out nice, however I still get a flour-y consistency and slight taste though I cooked the rue until brown(approx. 11 minutes on medium heat). It was also extremely bland considering I used the said amount of salt and pepper. I did have to add 2 beef bullion cubes for more flavor. I mixed in some ground venison and bacon. I did use butter and bacon rendering instead of oil. Over-all it's a great recipe that I plan on using and playing with until it suits our taste. Great starter gravy!!

I did want to add to say, that I really like this recipe because it gives you room to add ingredients and play with, without ruining the outcome.

Delicious! This was the first one I read, it seemed simple and it was and it was a big hit. Definitely the only white gravy I will ever need to make!

Best of the best!! Been a southerner all my life and never made consistent gravy until now.  My husband loved it!  I'm sure you could half the batch but you'll eat more than you should if you make the full recipe! ;)

I tried this recipe today, and it was okay. I also found it to be very floury. I added some beef bouillon and some galic salt and it made it better. Definatley needed some adjusting.

Needed a start and this was great! I did use a mix of sausage and bacon grease instead of oil. I also substituted sweetened condensed milk for the regular milk? I also added the fresh sage sausage that I fried and drained. My boyfriend said it was like his Grandpa used to fix and he loved it!! Thank you!!

I just made this gravy I used a little more pepper than what was called for, but it was delicious. I've been cooking for a long long time. But some things I never really wondered if I could make it from home like this gravy, I usually buy the mix, but I was much more satisfied with these results.

Oh wow.  This was my first attempt at cream gravy and only my third attempt at gravy. Period.  It was SO good.  I made only half the recipe and did as follows: Warmed 2 tbsp Hormel real bacon pieces (much healthier than actually cooking bacon).  In the same cast iron skillet that I used to warm the bacon, I melted 1/4 c butter and stirred in 1/4 cup flour (slightly less than the recipe called for), dash salt, dash pepper, and a dash garlic salt (didn't have garlic powder).  I let this brown into a nice roux.  I didn't mind if the gravy was a little on the brown side rather than white.  I definitely didn't brown the roux for a full 10 minutes, much less than that actually.  I just kind of used sight and smell to know when it smelled like the flour had cooked.  I turned off the heat then stirred in roughly 1.75 c skim milk about 1/2 cup at a time.  I turned the heat back on and let that thicken for roughly 10 minutes at most stirring almost constantly (I did this while I let my biscuits bake).  I then incorporated the bacon pieces.  I don't like tooting my own horn, but it was amazing.  Great recipe!  Very easy and VERY yummy (albeit not so healthy).

Butter definitely makes this gravy superb, even without meat drippings. I poured it on some biscuits made from scratch and had delicious biscuits & gravy.

It tasted fine. Like I expected, which is like other sausage gravies that I've had. I used butter instead of oil and added sausage and sausage grease as other reviewers recommended. But I wouldn't say this gravy is out of this world.

I used a stick of butter instead as I did not have vegetable oil. I always use fresh ground pepper as we like the big chunks of pepper. We served over biscuits and yummy.

I made this just this morning for 50 people. I added buttermilk as well. Just a bit heavy on the buttermilk. This gravy came out great anyhow. Thickened up perfectly. Will use this gravy each time I need a good gravy.

I was making biscuits and gravy last night for my family and one of my children is a vegetarian so I decided to try recipe.  I turned out really well.  The only thing I changed was using butter instead of oil.  So good my daughter was inquiring this morning where I had put the left overs!

Great basic recipe. I agree with others that adding bacon or sauage/drippings would add more flavor. I will also try it with butter sometime.

WOW! Yummy, just like I get when I go down South to visit my son...without the 10 hour drive! I browned sausage and had to add some butter because there wasn't enough fat in the pan, and didn't use as much milk because I like my gravy thick. No salt or pepper either, because I added the sausage back in and there was plenty of both in the sausage. A dash of garlic just 'cause we like garlic. Spoon over biscuits and YUM! Thanks for the great recipe!

This was my grandfather's recipe except he made it after frying chicken. It is an old cowboy/homesteader recipe originally and also good with meatballs. In both cases, the drippings are used.

I can never make gravy right... in an effort to show my boyfriend "I can make bisquits & gravy" I tried this and my bisquits were terrible (not flaky or fluffy) and this gravy saved them.  He loved it!  I was impressed at myself (of course I added sausage crumbled too)

This was REALLY good.  Great consistency for gravy; if you follow the directions precisely, it's not too thick or not too runny.  I did substitute 1/2 stick of unsalted butter for the oil.  Some sausage or bacon drippings would add some extra flavor, but it was delicious without them.  Consider yourself warned, though.....this makes a large amount of gravy.

It is a good recipe but I think it is missing something but I am not sure what.  (Keep in mind I do not eat meat so it may be perfect for you and the meal you have planned.)

My first time making a successful batch of gravy from scratch! And it was great!!! I used butter instead of oil, next time I'll try bacon fat, and I halved the recipe. I got the roux to a golden color (five mins) before I added the milk. I browned sausage in a separate pan and added the gravy to the sausage (which I didn't drain the little bit of fat off) and my kids and hubby loved it! So much better than the little gravy packets.

I think your portions are out of whack. I tried it and I ended up with something looking like mashed potatos. The ratio of veg oil to flour in your recipe is 1 to 3. I've checked other recipes for country gravy and they are all 1 to 1.

This turned out to be excellent.  I added some drippings from bacon to provide a little more flavor. My test subjects (LOL) loved it and so did I.

This would get 5 stars if sausage grease was used instead of vegtable oil. I cooked up half a roll of sausage and removed it from the pan. I added butter to the sausage grease before adding the flour. After gravy was done, I added the sausage back to the pan. This gravy is so full of flavor and, to me, the south. Yum!

This is one of my mom's favorite recipes (called it milk gravy) but used bacon grease instead of  oil.  She said to cook it for about ten to fifteen minutes after you add the milk to make certain the flour is "cooked" and stir consantly.

I prefer white gravy without all the sausage grease and chunks. This was delicious and so easy to make. I did exchange butter for oil and it had a wonderful flavor. Just make sure you cook your rue for a few minutes before adding the milk. This is now my official gravy for biscuits and gravy!

As a simple white sauce it is OK. Quite frankly, this recipe would be better off with something better than oil as the fat base. Smart Balance 50/50 is a possible option. If this was being served as a biscuit and gravy  entree, I would choose to add something extra such as maybe a little chopped onion and some bacon bits or bulk sage sausage. This sauce on top of chicken fried steak is adequate.

Also yummy is to use fat drippings from sausage or bacon or if that's not available, use butter instead of the oil.  We use whipping cream instead of milk but otherwise it's the same as the recipe posted.  We call ours Schmoan phat and it's a traditional Mennonite gravy for pasta, perogies, kielke etc.  Probably not too healthy but it's sure is yummy :)

Mom and Grandma made us Dirty Gravy. The difference is useind the meat greese and browning the flour more like a medum dark rue. The rest is the same. I now make it for my grandchildren. For breakfast they say " Biskets and gravy Papa. ".

My Mom always made it from drippings and made sure the roux was well browned. She usually used a combination of evaporated milk and water instead of milk and always added a pinch of sugar. She was known for her rich gravy!

This is a great start to an easy country gravy, however, it definitely needs more flavor. I would suggest cooking it with bacon grease or sausage - whichever you prefer. This would give it the flavor it's lacking and still the quick recipe everyone wants.

I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to say...I followed every bit of the recipe and it just tasted like flour. It was grainy and had an unappealing texture in your mouth. My kids are usually the best eaters, but they didn't care for it either.

I can't believe I didn't read the reviews - I wish I would have used butter!!  It had no taste to it, but the consistency was good.  I used white pepper.  I'll try it with butter next time.

This was just what I was looking for to serve with Breaded Pork Chops (also on this site).  I did modify it using bacon grease instead of oil and it worked perfectly.  I also use this base recipe whenever I need a milk-based gravy to serve with chicken or turkey, I just add some chicken bullion and use the drippings and juices from the poultry instead of the oil.

I made this for my hubby who loves country gravy. I had never made it from scratch, only by packet, but first try with this and I am sold. I will never buy another packet again!!!

I do love this recipe, however next time i will use the other reviewers idea and use butter for more flavor, it was a bit floury tasting. I also added crumbled up sausage to the gravy, and poured it over biscuits. IT WAS DELICIOUS!!!

Just made it, and it was a little grainy, but that was probably my fault. I added bacon grease an crumbled bacon, so over all it tasted pretty good. This was my first time attempting to make gravy, and i WILL be making this recipe again :)

This is a wonderful recipe. The gravy has a wonderful consistancy and texture, but it severely lacks flavor in the finished product. I would love to know what others are doing to remedy that. Thanks.

Its a good basic starter recipe, but It doesn't have much flavor, I added some tukey bullion, because all i could taste was flour and that isn't pleasent, soooo as i said its a good base, for you to mix up so you can get started but i'd suggest adding some flavor, maybe next time, ill use butter instead of oil, and sausuage or something!

I just made this and it turned out great! I used bacon grease instead of oil and was low on milk so I put 2 cups of milk, 2 cups of water instead of the 4 cups of milk. I was worried it wouldn't be as thick but it turned out great. The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is because it wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked, but that may be due to the fact that I put the water in it.

Have to give it a 5 star. Didn't change a thing. On a whim I wanted a quick white gravy recipe for some biscuits and this came together nicely. I made a half batch because it was just me and the wife and had no problems cutting the ingredients in half and still had plenty of gravy leftover.

This isn't bad....however I did tweak it a bit to adjust to my flavors. According to the adjustments, I would rate it an extra star. I prefer my gravy to have more of a bold flavor. What I did was brown the sausage (do not drain because the fat adds flavor), and then proceed to follow the recipe....very good with some biscuits and eggs for sure.

This was very good! Very easy and tasty. I always felt I wasn't very good at making gravy but I was happy with how this turned out. After I finished making it, I tasted it and decided to put more seasonings in it.  I also put in a few tablespoons of the drippings from making fried chicken! It was a very good, creamy gravy! Thank you!

I don't usually eat gravy but my husband wanted gravy for the chicken fried steak so I made this. When it was finished it tasted void of flavor. It didn't even taste like flour. Deffinately have to use some kind of meat grease or some kind of flavoring next time.

I cooked Ground Sausage First and then used the grease for my oil. Once the gravy was done i threw in the cooked ground sausage and just poured it over my Biscuits. I Hate to Say this but the best i ever had was in the army lol.

I would suggest using sausage or bacon grease rather than vegetable oil.  If you don't have enough grease, you could use half grease and half oil.  I didn't brown the flour for 10 minutes, maybe only two.  I would only add salt if only veg. oil is used.  If you're using sausage or bacon grease, there will be plenty of salt.  I used half milk and half water and it turned out fine.  However, I wanted true sausage gravy, so I added about a 1/4 C of sausage pieces in mine.  This turned out great - I'm not usually very good at making gravy.  The family ate it up so that speaks for itself.  :)

Great recipe, great directions. This is the way I was taught. Over the years I figured out a few things. The consistency of the flour/oil mixture will be the same after you add the milk and it thickens. If you want thicker gravy, add a little more flour. And if you want thinner gravy add a little more milk. I like to add a pinch of garlic powder sometimes. If you don't have milk on hand, you can use canned evaporated milk, being sure to reconstitute the milk per the instructions on the can. This makes a slightly richer tasting gravy. If you want a browner gravy, cook the oil/flour longer until it's the color of the gravy you want. Mom always called it burnt gravy and daddy didn't like it. A whisk is the best way to have creamy gravy, no lumps. When you have leftovers you can reheat the gravy in the microwave, using a whisk to reblend the "skin" that forms on the top of the cold gravy after it's half way heated. You may want to add a smidgen of water or milk also.

Ok, I am french and I need to know something. Your sauce looks like (is) the Béchamel sauce, I do not know if you know that except that you use oil instead of using butter; Did you try it with butter ?   Nelly

Much better with bacon or sausage drippings.  You must let the roux cook a while, brown, to ge rid of the flour taste.  The way this recipe is, it's a 3 star.

I made it using one telma vegetable seasoning cube and soy milk instead of regular.  It was the best gravy we've ever had !

I made my parent's dinner one night, using this gravy.  My dad said it reminded him of the gravy his mom used to make when he was younger, and that he hadn't tasted anything like it in years.  He then asked me to give the recipe to my mom (who by the way is a phenomenal cook, whereas I'm just a novice).

Just thinking about this recipe makes me want to vomit but my husband loves it. I add some bacon drippings and use butter instead of oil and I also add sausage and a bit of chicken broth.

I've just made this recipe and actually made edible gravy from scratch for the first time!  It turned out perfect!  I'm so excited to finally be able to make gray that tastes good.  Thank you so much!

This is quick & simple! I used this recipe to make biscuits and gravy.  I've never made my own gravy and was really amazed how great this turned out.  There were a few things I altered in the recipe though.  1. I browned the oil, salt & pepper as directed but in a small skillet, once it was browned I added the mixture to my already browned sausage.  2.  I changed the flour serving to 1/2 a cup (add more flour if needed).  The gravy thickens very quick so I thought 3/4 c. would be way too much.  3.  I SLOWLY poured in 2 cups of milk & stirred REALLY good for a minute then added 2 more cups. 4. The taste was still a little bland so I added some peppercorn pepper (to taste) and it really gave the gravy some kick that I was looking for!

I just made this gravy to go with biscuits & sausage.. turned out great!  I used slightly less flour than the recipe called for (probably 1/8 cup less) and it turned out to be the perfect consistency. I also used the drippings from the sausage (about 1/4 cup) and butter for the remaining oil, instead of veggie oil. I added 1/4 c of crumbled (cooked) sausage bits when I was almost done adding the milk.

This was so simple and easy! I'm a poor college kid, and I was craving something delicious so I decided to take a stab at making some gravy!    I used butter and... Jiffy mix instead of flour; worked out just fine and tasted great!  It was a little floury after I finished, but I just tossed a bit of seasoned pepper and that took any remaining floury taste away.  Great, easy, and fast!   5 stars!

OMG... So good! I needed some kind of sauce to toss with cooked vegetables and shredded rotisserie chicken for lunch yesterday and this hit the spot. I used 3.25% milk (my little one drinks that; helped make his lunch nice and creamy) and salt/pepper/garlic powder/onion powder to taste. I also followed a few reviewers' suggestion not too use oil, but as my butter was frozen I used margarine and it worked perfectly. In all honesty, serving this as I did it would make a great filling for a pot pie in a pinch! Delicious.

I am rating this 3 stars for several reasons. First  I will admit that it was my first time making gravy and I had some problems with lumps, which I resolved quickly with the blender (sorry, but I had no experience in mixing the milk so it was lumpy). But that is not why I am giving it 3 starts. The gravy "as is" was very bland, I had to seasoned more with salt, pepper and garlic powder. I think next time I will also add some beef burlioun. Also, it tasted a lot like flour (which the spices took away after some point). I didn't use oil, I used the drippins from country steak fry I was making, but wow is it heavy! Next time I will just use butter (I think smart balance or I can't believe is not butter will be good, I have gotten used to use it instead of regular butter).

This was a good base recipe.  I used the dripping of the chicken I was making to give this a little boost and aside from mine being a bit thick it was delicious.

I have NEVER been able to make gravy at all.. When I have tried in the past it either comes out looking and/or tasting like a glue stick mixed with flour. Was NEVER a pretty sight so I became dependent on the envelope gravy. Low and behold guess what I forgot to pick up at the store while grocery shopping GRAVY!! So I jump on here and find this recipe. I read the reviews I added butter instead of the oil. I'm southern butter makes everything better in my eyes lol. Anyways I made this terrified the whole time, but I can honestly say it turned out wonderful! Hubby thinks im a Pro at cooking but honestly if it wasnt for allrecipes i would be screwed lol

used bacon grease instead of oil and put bacon bits into gravy. Put it on top of Garlic fried chicken. Great for the taste buds but not so much for the arteries! Will make again sparingly!

This gravy was wonderful! Even with Rice Dream rice milk, the gravy still had a perfect consistency and great flavor. The milk was the only thing I substituted, only because my husband is lactose intolerant. Will definitely keep this recipe in my arsenal!

This is surprisingly really good, I did not think it would be that good without any actual chicken drippings or broth or anything but it is REALLY good. Instead of oil I did use butter and I'm glad I did, great recipe!

this is a good quick recipe for a country gravy.  my kids loved it! Butter is better than oil though so I used butter, and i added more milk so it wouldn't be so thick for my kids, i also used seasoned salt instead of regular salt, and i used white pepper instead of black pepper

This didn't work out for me...didn't taste good at all.  I followed the recipe but maybe the flour got too brown?

This is the best recipe for scratch country gravy I've tasted since my Granny's. I even got my picky fiancee to enjoy it and that's saying something.

Very yummy. My husband eats meat and loved it on his sausage and I am a vegetarian and loved it on my soy sausage. I used butter instead of oil like some reviews suggested. The recipe made lots and it reheated in the microwave very well for 2 days.

Not bad.  I had trouble with it becoming too thick & dry when browning the flour/oil, and I measured carefully.  I added a good bit more milk than called for to thin it down. Not sure what happened but will try it again.

I made this recipe today for my biscuits and gravy and it was real good.  Instead of all milk, I used 2 cups evaporated milk and two cups water...that gave me the creamier taste I was looking for.  I added a little more salt but left everything the same.  Very good recipe and would be great on country fried steak!

I cut the recipe in half and used butter instead of oil.  I used the gravy to make biscuits and gravy. The serving sizes are small.  A serving size for three made just the right amount for one person.

Cooked this with pan fried pork chops & used the oil from that. The only thing I added was about 1-1/2 teaspoons sugar & it was very~very good! Other than that followed the recipe to a "T". Will definitely make this again!

This was my first attempt ever at making white gravy. My husband and son loved it!! This is a good recipe, but since I am always health conscious I used butter instead as well. I also added just a little bit of garlic powder. It came out great!! Thanks for posting this.

It was good, not great. There wasn't a ton of flavor, which was disappointing. I took the reviewers advice of using butter and allowing the roux to cook for 10 minutes before adding the milk. I might try it again using sausage or bacon fat instead.

This was the first "from scratch" gravy and I must say that I like that I can season it to my taste.  I wouldn't say it had no flavor, but a mild flavor that complimented the steak fingers that I made perfectly. I had so much left over that I am going to cook up some sausage and make biscuits in the morning.  My husband and stepson gave it a thumbs up!

This was awesome!  The hubby loved it!  Served it over breaded chicken patties and mashed potatoes.  Only thing I added was a little garlic powder and I thought it needed a bit more salt.  Yum-meeee!  I will be making this one again for sure.

This is much too bland. I used butter instead of the oil as well. I ended up adding about 1/2 cup of soy sauce to it which turned it a nice brown color and added some much needed flavour..the texture of this recipe is not bad though, so would be a good base for additional ingredients...but on its own, not great

It was very simple to make, but this had almost no flavor at all. I could taste hints of pepper, but altogether it was very, very bland. Next time I might mix it with some sausage and drippings to give it more flavor. Or just stick with my store bought gravy.

I thought this recipe was perfect. I did use oil and cooked my flour/oil base to a medium brown and added the milk. I've made this twice.. As long as you cook it long enough and have it seasoned properly, it does NOT taste like flour. This is exactly like my Mom made when I was a kid, and I made it for biscuits and gravy just like she did.. it was perfect. Yum. It DOES make a lot though, so you might scale back for only two people.

Well I loved this as did my family! I took a bit of tips from all.  I added butter instead oil and a dropped a cube of chicken bouillon to the cooking butter.  It came out lumpy but that was my own fault for not adding the milk slowly so I just got out the mixer and mixed it for a few minutes and it was creamy and perfect!  Thank you!

Really yummy gravy! I didn't brown it as recipe calls for, I wanted it to be white. I did have to add a little more water to thin it out a little bit. I'll be using this recipe a lot!

This is our new recipe...my husband says it's better than my MIL's.  I made a double batch for camping with my inlaws and the men all raved about it. I add 1 lb pork sausage and use the grease from it and make up with the vegetable oil to equal the 1/2 cup it calls for.

Just made this delicious gravy with sage sausage to go over biscuits.  The recipe was very easy and worked wonderfully.  I in place of the salt I added onion salt and a chicken boullion cube. I also added a bay leaf.  The football players I served couldn't get enough.  I used JP's Biscuit recipe from this site.  Definately will be making again soon.  Thanks

I thought this recipe was good. My husband made it the first time when we decided to make gravy w/our chicken fried steak. It turned out ok. And when I made it it turned out better. This is my first time making homeade gravy and it was great for 1st time. I will definitely be playing with this recipe to perfect (so that it doesn't have the floury taste)

I'm sorry and I don't mean to  be mean but this was horrible!  There was absolutley NO taste at all.  I tried adding more pepper and salt.. I finally gave up.  THis might have been better with sausage or bacon added.  I did like the idea of how simple it was though so I'm rating this with a 2.

I live and Hawaii and we don't usually have this kind of gravy here.  We usually use cream of mushroom soup or the dry packaged gravy.   I will never do that again!  First I sauteed some onions and set it aside.  Then I added it to the gravy once it was done.  I used a stick of butter instead of vegetable oil and followed the directions.    I had a bag of flour leftover in the freezer that was already seasoned with garlic salt and pepper.  I was going to make fried chicken one night but changed the menu at the last minute.  It was perfect for this gravy recipe.  I served it with some pork chops from the night before (I used pkg gravy that night) and it was better with this gravy.  I will never use another gravy!  Thanks to your Mom!

This was alright in a pinch.  A little bland, probably would have been better with butter over oil and I added more pepper.  Of course drippings would make it even that much better..but it's a good base recipe.

I used butter instead and the results were amazing. I also put a dash of garlic salt and some buillon soup base for additional flavor. I had to use heavy cream and 1/2 and 1/2 because there was no milk around and the gravy turned out just fine- very thick though. This recipe is great in terms of measurements, but you can have a lot of fun with flavoring. 
Good recipe, I'll use it again.

This gravy tasted GREAT! I will be making thia again, but next time I will cut the flour by about half. I found the gravy to be too thick even after adding over 4 cups of milk. Also, I added garlic salt and a little extra pepper.

Great Recipe! Easy to make. I did make one alteration. I used the oil left from the pork chops I fried. Made the gravy more flavorful. I know it was good because my two, very picky, children ate it up and my husband practically licked the plate clean!
Enjoy!

This was my first attempt at white gravy. It came out VERY THICK, thicker than pudding and tasted like bland chip beef.
 I took the advice of other reviewers and used bacon drippings instead of oil. That was the main thing flavoring this,  the drippings; I cannot imagine how bland it would have been with plain old oil, or even butter. Also, I added about half a pack of diced bacon to this for extra flavor. But ultimately it was a waste, the flavor is nothing to get excited about, a little bland really.
 Also, you might want to cut this in half before making it, because 4 cups of gravy is A LOT!!
 If I were to make this again I might cut the amount of flour in half, as it really became to thick to be practical.

I finally tried this recipe. I didn't like how it was way too runny for my taste the first time around, so instead of oil..I used butter instead the second time. 

Some good things to add in to the gravy are to add sausage, bacon (chopped fine), green&red bell peppers (chopped fine), red onion, 2 hard-boiled eggs (chopped fine), velvetta cheese and spice it with oregano, black pepper and garlic powder (about a teaspoon each on the black pepper and oregano, and 2 tablespoonfuls of garlic powder does the trick, although I like a lot of garlic..so you may want to adjust it to your own taste). 

Also, double the amount of gravy you make if you add all the extra ingrediants...so that there is enough gravy to go with it over the biscuits. 

Overall it's a good easy recipe though...and it is nice to do on a Saturday or Sunday morning when you can get the family together for breakfast alot easier.

I used this recipe to make a last minute gravy for Thanksgiving dinner. I'm a vegetarian so it was hard to find a recipe that was meatless and that I already had all the ingredients for. I used 1/2 cup of butter instead of vegetable oil. It came out pretty good and was very easy to make. My friend said it didn't have much flavor, but I liked it. Took about 25 minutes. Next time I would add more spices to add more flavor.

This turned out really good considering I am the worst at making gravy. I changed the settings to make 3 servings instead of 6. I used about 1 3/4 cups of milk, 2 beef buillons and 1/4 of butter instead of oil.

Tasted like i was eating water and flour... I would of gone for more of a corn starch thickener since milk thickens when cooked.  Plus i had to add seasonings to give it a flavor.

The gravy turned out like thickened flour-milk, and unfortunately did not taste like gravy at all. I added extra pepper and salt, which helped a lot, but this wasn't really gravy. Not sure what's missing, but I'll play around with this another time.
