I made a few changes, and it turned out EXCELLENT! 1) I didnt have dill weed, so I used 1 tsp minced garlic, and some oregano.  2) I didnt use a steam basket. I just put zuchinni in pan with some water, and covered for about 5-7 minutes.  3) I put in oven for the 30 minutes, uncovered... than I baked for additional 5 minutes, covered... it didnt come out to watery like other reviews. Will definitely make again next week!

this dish was delish!  I added Italian bread crumbs and more cheese at the end and baked for about 10 more minutes.  I also used Mozzerella cheese instead of Ramano.  This is something I will definately be making again and telling my friends about.

I used fresh zucchini and ripe tomatoes from my garden.  The recipie  did not have enough flavor for me and too much water drained from the vegetables and ruined the texture.  Maybe if you inserted a rack into the pan to allow vegetables to drain during baking, it would improve the texture.

I really liked the base ingredients, but I'm not fond of steamed zucchini.  Instead of steaming, I sauteed them with yellow pepper and onions in the margarine and dill and once they were tender, I put the mix in a pie plate (I only did a half recipe) and then put the tomatoes on and the cheese, which I used mozerella instead too.  It turned out fabulous so I wanted to share!!

This is scrumptious!  I like dill but was reluctant about putting it in this dish...but I tried it and it was delicious!  I used 1 large zucchini and one summer squash, steamed them and then put them in a glass pie plate.  I then melted 1 TBs of butter and added one TBS of dried dill and fresh cracked pepper.  I tossed the zucchini in it and put the tomatoes on top of with parmesan and fresh basil.  It was a nice herby mellow flavor.  Not overpowering at all.  Very nice presentation as well.

I absolutely love this recipe. I slice the zucchini width-wise about 1/2 inch thick and saute them with pam spray and add italian seasoning on each side. Then I put them on the bottom of a casserole dish, slice tomatoes from my garden on top and add more italian seasoning. I use parmesan cheese on top. I now make it all the time.

This was very good. I used all basil because my basil plants are thriving while my dill doesn't seem to be dealing well with the heat! I'm not sure if we would have liked it as much with dill. I also added a crushed clove of garlic to the zucchini. Both my boyfriend and I really enjoyed it, but next time I think I will use half Romano and half Parmesan. Thanks for the recipe.

I loved this recipe!  I loved the different seasons in it.  The dill played wonderfully with the basil.  I used cheddar cheese, because that's all I had but the next time I make it I will follow the recipe...  I also like the idea of adding Parmesan

Like this recipe says, you can play with it a lot. I used one fewer zucchini (3 instead of 4), left out the dill, used dried basil because I didn't have any fresh on hand, and used Parmesan cheese instead of Romano. I don't think I'd ever add dill, but I would try other combos. This veggie dish was so good that I served in its juices with a good bread, and that alone made a perfect summer meal.

This was a great dish.  Very easy, and my husband and I Loved it.  I used fresh basil because it is in season here in NY along with the tomatoes and Zucchini.  I used cornflake crumbs for the top and added a touch of white wine sprinkled over the whole top.  OUTSTANDING!!!

Unexpectedly fabulous!! Used about 1/2 tablespoon dried dill instead of fresh, and grated Parmesan instead of Romano. No salt needed because the cheese is salty enough. Wonderful!!!

This was very good with the lemon pepper baked lake perch we had for supper. I made a couple adjustments only because I leftovers in the refrigerator. Instead of fresh tomatoes I used the leftover stewed tomatoes and had a bag of frozen yellow and green zucchini squash in the freezer. I topped it with parmesan cheese before I baked it and it was delicious! We'll have this again.

I didn't have dill weed, so I used dried basil, subbed olive oil for margarine and used mozzarella and parmesan cheeses. I also sautéed the zucchini before I placed it in the oven. I wish the zucchini would have been crisper(maybe next time I'll try roasting it? I think steaming would turn out the same way), but I still liked it. Per another review, I put Italian bread crumbs under the cheese. It had enough flavor (I also added red pepper flakes and oregano), and, most importantly, it was filling. I served it with a piece of sourdough bread. I would make this again with a few alterations.

I have to tell you that I find it real frustrating when you read reviews and people have made sooo many changes to the original recipe!!!  I made this weekend making it exactly as it is it written but made the one small decision to use olive oil rather than margarine.  The flavours were fantastic!  It was not watery at all and the cheese and dill....WOW!  I think I will play with it a bit more in the future now knowing how great it is....and by that I just simply mean more cheese because I LOVE CHEESE......other than that...I wouldn't change a thing!  It was great and we will definitely make this again!!!  THANK YOU!

Thanks for another great zucchini and tomato recipe - I used a mix of green zucchini and yellow crookneck squash. I was skeptical about the dill and basil together - but I am so glad I didn't leave the dill out. This will be a sumemr favorute when my garden is producing!

YUM!!! what a great way to use fresh tomatoes from my garden. I added a small amount of gorgonzola cheese (1/4 cup) and it added depth to this dish. Great recipe.

I absolutely loved this dish, and it was so quick and easy to prepare.  My whole family enjoyed it, even my four and six year old daughters, and you know how picky kids can be.  It was an excellent twist on my traditional muffin and bread uses for my extra garden zucchini.

This could be a good South Beach side dish if you substitute olive oil for the butter!

I'm not sure I like the parmesan/dill combination... but cheddar could work, or maybe another herb.

I thought this dish was great!!! It is a very light dish and perfect for a light lunch. Also it is great for a family that has children that has diabetes like ours does. It did need a little spices so I put in garlic and salt and next time I will definitley add in mozza cheese before cooking. Thank you so much for this recipe!!!!

I think this recipe has potential, but I'll make a few changes next time.  The tomatoes and cheese on top had great flavor, but the zucchini below was a bit bland.  I tend to like salt, so will probably toss the zucchini with some of the grated cheese for more flavor, and even add garlic.  I will also make sure the zucchini still warm enough when I bake it that I only heat the dish enough to warm the tomatoes and brown the cheese on top - sort of like with broiled tomatoes.  Otherwise they get too mushy for my tastes.
