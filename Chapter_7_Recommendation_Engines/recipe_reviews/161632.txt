Hubby made these for us this afternoon and boy, did they hit the spot! The olive brine was a different addition from what we're used to, and hubby added his own spin with a little horseradish. After rimming the glass with celery salt he garnished it with green olives, a fresh chilled shrimp and a leafy stalk of celery.  Beautiful and delicious!

Alright, it's sort of authentic. I bartend in Green Bay and I make mine a little differently. I build mine in this order:
Ice,
5 shakes celery salt,
Squeeze of juice from one lemon wedge,
5 shakes Worcestershire, 
2 drops steak sauce,
3 drops Tabasco,
2 shakes Old Bay Seasoning,
*Vodka,
Tomato juice (stir after adding or Worcestershire will pool at bottom),
2 fresh olives,
2 shrimp,
1 beef stick,
1 stick Colby-Jack Cheese,
1 pickle, and 
1 fresh lemon wedge 
- That's an authentic Wisconsin brunch Bloody!

Love the "mary's" ... but for me, a healthy dose of horse radish is a must.  Also like to use 1/2 V8 & 1/2 Clamato...and add Old Bay Seasoning (for my East coast hubby) -- then add a beef stick and a small chaser of beer...life is good!

The secret to any good Bloody Mary is to pour in enough dill sauce to cover the bottom of the empty tumbler, and then proceed with the other ingredients and directions.

I just made this recipe last night, and it was the BEST!  I made it exactly the same except I used zesty pickle juice and pickles instead.  Mostly because I was out of olives.  Will definately try olive juice though.  Maybe it is a Wisconsin thing, but I always love Clamato the best.  :o)  If you like a very thick V8 style bloody mary, this is probably not for you though.  I added slightly less hot sauce the second time, because I found it to be a bit spicey for my taste.  If you do not like them very spicey add the hot sauce to taste.  We are having bloody marys this weekend, so my husband wanted me to make pitchers of this recipe for everyone! I will use this recipe over and over! Enjoy!

This is a great start to the recipe.  I make a couple of minor changes.  Like some of the other reviews, I definitely add a big pinch of prepared horseradish and a big teaspoon of A-1.  As for the olive juice, that's definitely an option, but my favorite is banana pepper juice...you can go hot or mild depending on your preference.  Then, I replace the rimming celery salt with a 50/50 mixture of cajun seasoning and seasoning salt.  Add a little football and you've got a perfect Saturday morning!!

I'm from Wisconsin and I make my bloody's exactly like this (different garnishes of course - try a jalapeno pickled green bean!) except for one glaring omission: BEER!  Add a splash of beer (from Wisconsin) for the true Wisconsin Bloody.

This is the best.  This is the same recipe I use, but instead of olives/olive juice I use pickles and pickle juice.  But hey, I am from Wisconsin and I love Clamato in my bloody mary!  Cheers

As a Wisconsin bartender, I can attest that this recipe is quite authentic.

In Madison, we often substitute a pickle for the celery garnish, and pickle brine in addition to the olive brine. 

Beer (especially a good stout) is a good addition, but I think beer is best served separately with the bloody as a chaser.

As some reviewers have said, this is not really a bloody mary - it's what we call a caesar in Canada.  Essentially a bloody mary with clamato juice instead of tomato juice.  I guess Wisconsin bloody marys are actually caesars...

On my list for Xmas entertaining.  Only change will be using Mott's Clamato Juice instead of Tomato Juice.  That's the preferred all over Canada.

Up here in Canada, this is called a "Caesar". A Bloody Mary uses only tomato juice, not the clam/tomato kind.  Just thought I'd offer that tidbit :). This is a tasty version of it!

Best bloody I've found so far!  Probably the MSG (nom nom nom).  But still, it's hard not to fiddle with.  I like to use Sriracha for the hot sauce, add some garlic powder or pressed garlic, cocktail onions and/or brine, garlic-stuffed olives, and the occasional cilantro shredlets. 

If you like this, you should really try a Michelada - Allrecipes has a version!

Very Tasty. The only thing it is missing is the horseradish. The shrimp reminds me of the most wonderful Bloody Mary we had in Newport Beach, Calif. a few years back!! Gotta have a Giant Shrinp. Thanks.

This is a very popular Canadian Caesar with olives added. Try adding 2 oz. of dill pickle juice insted of the olive juice. We call it a dill pickle caesar or add beef brovil and we call it a western caesar.

We enjoyed this immensely!  It is far from our standard Bloody Mary recipe, but we will no doubt make these again.  The Clamato was refreshing, light, and a good base for the balance of the ingredients.  I recommend this for those who like subtle change with a touch of the standard.

It's "okay" I guess. I live in Milwaukee and to anyone who lives here- you can't visit the city without going to Cafe Benelux in the third ward area and try their "Stinkin Rose" bloody Mary. Mix is made from scratch. Uses fermented vodka, garnished with beef stick (made in Wisconsin of course), shrimp, pickled green beans, cheese, olives. I do however like how simple this recipe is if you don't have a lot of time to make your mix from fresh tomatoes.

This Bloody Mary recipe is almost exact to the one I make.  The only difference is I use Jalapeño stuffed olives and a lime wedge.  Absolutely the best.
