This is really good.  I'm giving it 4 stars because I think the cook time is way off.  I used only a 2.75 lb. roast, and after 5 hours it was JUST getting to the point of being able to easily shred.  The taste though is divine!  I halved the recipe (since I was using a smaller roast), added a packet of Onion Soup Mix (per others reviews, thought this was a good addition) and added a quartered whole onion while it cooked.  After the meat was done, I took out the 1/2 cup of broth, and then put the rest in a saucepot.  I then added to the broth pot all the ingredients and brought to a slow boil for a couple of minutes, then added everything (meat and sauce) back to the crockpot for another 4 hours on low.  Because I was running low on ketchup, and based on the reviews, I only used 1/4 cup ketchup and 1 1/4 cups Hickory Smoke Kraft BBQ sauce (for full recipe, I'd use 1/2 cup ketchup and 2 1/2 cups BBQ Sauce).  I did not use the additional salt because of the soup mix, and I used maybe 6 shakes (12 for full recipe) of Tabasco in place of the cayenne.  This recipe tastes authentic and it's addictive!  Served with cornbread.  (Sorry, I think this is the longest review ever!)

My grandmother has made Beef BBQ this way for over 50 years, she uses bottom round so you can eliminate the fat picking step. She also cooks it on top the stove covered on very low heat, stirring once in awhile, until most of the liquid is gone ( about 3 -4 hours ) and the meat has shreaded by the cooking process.

After reading the review that noted the strong ketchup taste, I decided to use a new ketchup product from Heinz - Ketchup Kick'rs, smokey mesquite flavor to replace the ketchup.  I also scaled the recipe to 8 servings because I happened to have a 2 lb chuck roast on hand.  I cooked the meat the afternoon/evening before. Shredded and assembled the recipe before bed and put it and the broth in the fridge overnight.  At two the next afternoon, I continued with the recipe.  I did have to use most of the broth (the good thing was by chilling it, I was able to remove all the fat).  I served it with jalapeno slices, sliced onions that were broiled slightly to take the bite out and coleslaw as optional toppings on toasted (broiled) french bread.  My husband had been dreading this roast, yet absolutely loved this recipe - even had a second sandwich.  I would have given 5 stars, but because I think it was the Mesquite ketchup that made it so good only gave it 4.

I scaled the recipe down to 10 servings, just threw everything in the crockpot on low and cooked overnight.  In the morning, I just fished out the excess fat.  So easy!  I added a bit more brown sugar than called for.  Didn't smell too great cooking (very vinegary), but tasted WONDERFUL!  Will surely make again and again and again!  :)

This is an outstanding and simple recipe that can be used for beef or pork. Using the slow cooker allows you to start it one day, cook thru the night, shred and mix with seasoning and be ready the next day. Great for weekend activities. Try using pork and add one cup mustard, one cup vinegar.

As a Californian, I had to use Tri Tip.  Came out excellent, I browned the meat first, used the Kicker's Mesquite Ketchup for 1/2 of the amount of Ketchup and used the full amount of garlic.  Needed to cook on high for about 4 hours before adding the sauce, and them simmered on low for 3 hours more.  All of my Southern friends loved the sandwiches!

Had a chuck roast (3.5 lbs) thawed, so I threw it in the crockpot this AM covered with beef broth. Have definitely never heard of 7 lbs. of any cut of roast shredding after 2-4 hours in a crockpot on low (!!!), so I just planned on the standard 7-8 hours. Was fork tender/shredded easily at that point, so I drained some of the liquid out and made the sauce in a *separate* pan - those of you who don't like the taste, this is a good sauce base, but get creative and tweak it to your own preferences. More vinegar, add some other spices, more worcestershire, spice it up with crushed red pepper, honey vs. brown sugar, etc. (which is a good reason to make the sauce in a separate pan!). You really can't mess this up! After the sauce was done, I added it to the beef and cooked on low for another hour and it was perfect! Served on bakery-fresh toasted buns with homemade garlic cole slaw on the sandwiches (cole slaw on top of the bbq and under the top bun is essential in the south!) and thick cut oven fries. EXCELLENT and the kids tore it up! Regarding the sauce, for us it's kicked up with crushed red pepper, yellow mustard vs. dried, apple cider vinegar vs. white, a little juice from a jar of pepperocini peppers, and lots of McCormick Smokehouse ground black pepper. Just follow the base, and if it's not quite "there" for you, keep adding and tasting until you love it, THEN toss with the beef & it's the perfect (indoor anyway!) BBQ beef for sandwiches. Thanks for the great recipe!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I had to cook the meat about 4 hours on high to get it to shredding consistency, but that was minor since I already planned to cook it all day.  I did find the ketchup taste too strong and added more sugar and vinegar to even it out.  I also didn't have any cheyanne so I used hot sauce to give it kick.  My husband really like and since I love crock pot recipes I will make it again for sure.

Took much longer to cook to get to the shredding point, but I figured it would, and it doesn't need to be cooked as long after you add everything. I cooked the roast until it was ready to pull apart and then stuck the crockpot in the fridge over night. The next day I removed all the fat that had hardend and turned the crockpot back on,shredded the beef, added the ingrediants and cooked the rest of the way. It was very tasty. You don't have to be precise on the measurments, just add what you like to get the desired taste. I will add lots more spice to it when we are ready to eat it after taking some out for the kids and those that don't like it hot. I like to use chili paste. Didn't use as much ketchup.

Wow - now this is fabulous BBQ Beef! It's definitely sweet and tangy so prepare your tastebuds. I had my eye on this recipe for a while and made it for my Halloween party (just finally got around to reviewing it). Needless to say it was a BIG hit! I cut the recipe in half cutting back on the ketchup and used 1/2 cup ketchup with 1/2 cup of BBQ sauce. This is best prepared the night before due to the long cook time. Plus it's even better in the slow cooker the next day! I served this on mini kaiser rolls (sliders) along with kettle cooked chips and mini dill pickles - this may become a new Halloween tradition!

For any of theses recipes, if you take the juice generated from the slow cooking, put in the refrigerator, and then skim off the fat easily after it has hardened on the top, you will have a much healthier meal with a lot less calories.

I served this at my daughter's wedding reception. She wanted a picnic type of menu to go with the theme. At this point (she was the 3rd daughter to marry in 13 months) all I cared about was avoiding food poisoning that could be traced to me. At the reception, everyone wanted to know where we got the caterer and there was not a smidge left out of a huge HUGE professional size roaster. It's wonderful.

I made this recipe over two days.  The first day I cooked the roast (about a 3 pounder) in 1 cup of water.  There is no way you could cook it in a slow cooker to fork tender state in two to four hours.  The next day I shredded the meat, eliminated the excess fat, then added the other ingredients.  I cut down those proportionately and instead of using all ketchup I also used Sweet Baby Rays.  Everyone loved it.  It's a keeper.

Tried this over the weekend with a 3 pound elk roast.  My family loved it!  I sprinkled the roast with a package of Lipton onion soup mix and it took longer than the recipe says for it to cook enough to be shredded.  Didn't put all the ketchup in and used red wine vinegar instead of the white. So easy to make. Will definitely do this one again for all types of meat.  Thanks Elaine where ever you are.  :o)

I've made this for years after I learned it from my mother.  I've cooked it several different ways, slow cooker, stovetop and even pressure cooker which can be done in 45 minutes.  The only difference is I add a couple tablespoons of liquid smoke and cut the roast into 1-2 inch cubes.  Served with mashed potatoes with the bbq sauce as gravy.  MMMMMM making a slow cooker full tomorrow for Sunday dinner.

Wow.  I am a big big fan of this recipe.  It so happened there was not a chuck roast to be found at my local grocery the day I went shopping, so I got that next fattiest/cheapest (cause well...thats what makes it so tender)  roast i could find-- (eye round) at twice the price.  Bummer.  BUT-- it was FANTASTIC!!!  A bunch of my fiance's college buddies were up for a laid back weekend so I wanted to go with something that could just chill until we were ready to eat, regardless of the time.  This was toally the dish.  I read all the other reviews about how it didnt shred after a few hours so I started it thi night before (alright, actually about 1 in the morning...) and after 8 hours or so on low, it shredded beautifully.  Other than a different cut, I followed the recipe EXACTLY (rare for me) and it was SO STINKING GOOD.  I served on a very bizarre variation of the German-style Weck rolls from this site (read me review of it if you want details on the oddness) and we each ate about twice our weight of the stuff.  I highly recommend this :)  Great for parties that you'd like to BBQ at but can't.

This was really yummy, although I didn't taste anything that just wowed my socks off compared to other bbqs I've made.  I used part ketchup and part bbq sauce (Sweet Baby Ray's), and found that I still wanted to up some of the other ingredients - particularly the vinegar.  I ended up adding a fairly liberal squirt or two (or 5) of prepared mustard also, and that brought the "tangy" more up to our tastes.  All in all, pretty yummy, I will definitely go to this recipe when I'm making bbq.  Cook times are way off, as most people seem to know already.  I needed to cook my meat a good 6-8 hours before it was shred-able.  Definitely a 2 day process unless you get an early start!

For a 3 lb. round roast, 1/2 the ingredients and omited the cayenne. Like most other reviews, cooked on low for about 6 hrs. then shredded meat and returned to slow cooker for about 2 hrs.,added about 1/2 cup reserved broth to sauce.

Both my husband  and I thought this recipe was very good.  I did not use the crockpot.  Browned roast, added onion, salt and pepper, then roasted in oven on 350 for two hours.  Cut sauce ingredients in half and added to shredded beef.  Simmered on low for approximately an hour.  Yummo!  Paired it with corn on the cob.  Simple summer meal.

I made this by throwing all the ingredients together into the cooker. I used half the meat but I didn't halve the ingredients except for the ketchup. I omitted the ketchup and used 1 cup tomato purée. Upped the mustard too. Cooked on low for 8 hours. Tasted fantastic. Delicious. Definitely will make again. So easy and no mess. Thanks for the recipe!

I think this will be very good the next time my son invites his friends over. Make a big batch of this meat, put out the pickles, cheese, lettuce and buns. Make a big bowl of coleslaw and the boys can feed themselves rather than keep ordering pizzas!!

I used a 3lb top round roast and cut the recipe in half.  Before putting meat into crock, I cut it into chunks as I do with my pulled pork.  Meat was so tender and just fell apart after 5 hours on low, but I still let it go for about 8 hours total before serving on fresh rolls.  Add a splash or two of Franks to your sammy and YUMMY!

I use the roast, put all ingredients in together and cook in slow (250 deg.)  oven. Takes less time. Very yasty recipe.

Elaine you must be a culinary scientist!  This recipe is outstanding.  I used a 3.5 pound roast so I cut the sauce in half and it was perfect. I Plan to try with pork and chicken in the future. Great for serving big groups.  Served with Nana's Southern Coleslaw (recipe on site) Perfect!

I used a *4lb. pork roast which I cooked in crockpot with 1/2 c. water & a pkg. of Lipton Onion Soup Mix. I cooked until very tender and then removed from bone and removed fat. The next day I mixed ingredients except that I used half BBQ sauce/half ketchup and I cooked on low for 3-4 hours. Family really liked, very flavorful.*Halved ingredients since I used a smaller roast.

Based on other reviews I switched out 1/2 of the ketchup for bbq sauce and accidently put in a bit more garlic than called for and this turned out delicious. I'm going to try it with pork next.

I am the world's laziest cook so I just threw all ingredients into the slow cooker and hoped for the best. After 8 hours on low my meat wasn't shredding easily so just sliced it super thin. Threw it back into the pot and added a bit of cornstarch to thicken the sauce. Great basic recipe -- some of my family added more spices, some liked it as is; some ate it on a bun, some preferred it with potatoes. An all-round crowd pleaser. Thanks!

GREAT RECIPE!!  The time to cook the meat was way off though.  I actually had to cook it over night.  Then it was ready to shred.  I added a couple of ingredients to mine as well: 6 oz chili sauce, 1tsp. garlic powder, and 1/4 cup of orange juice.  It was soooo good.  I have given it to several people and they can't compare it to any other one.  Thank you Elaine for this great recipe.

This turned out really good. I didn't do mine in the crockpot, though. I slow roasted the roast in the oven, covered with foil ~ at 300 degrees for about 4 hours. Then I shredded it down and added the sauce ingredients and placed it in the crockpot on high for an hour. That way it stayed warm and we could all eat when we were hungry. Quite yummy! :o)

I have been married 50 years and have cooked a lot of meals.  This is the hardest BBQ I have ever made.  After the roast cooked for 4 hours it was near impossible to flake.  I ended up grinding the meat.  I'm thinking maybe 2 hours in the crock pot or maybe 6 hours in the crock pot.  Whatever, the meat was tough.  Now I have to decide how much longer to cook it.  Not a good recipe.

I think this is a good start on the flavor and an easy cooking method.  I only gave 3 stars because I had to tweak my sauce with smoked paprika, more garlic, more vinegar and a dash of liquid smoke to give it a rounded flavor.

Excellant. The hours it takes to cook is reflected in the taste. Try not to be impatient. The end result is wonderful. You can alter the sweet, the vinegar and the heat without spoiling the taste. Would unconditionally recommend this to everyone. Dave.

Very good! Used approximately 2 1/2 cups of BBQ sauce (bullseye original, our favorite-no corn syrup) and 1 6 oz.can of tomato paste. No ketchup or brown sugar. Cooked in crock all night with 1 1/2 c. Water and 1pkg of onion soup mix. Other ingredients the same except no salt or cayenne. Shredded meat in the morning and added sauce. Cooked 3 hours on low then kept warm til serving time.YUM!

Great crock pot recipe.  Yes, the cooking time is off (it took about twice as long, on high heat), but the taste is good.  I used tomato sauce instead of ketchup.  My roast was small, so I halved the recipe with good results.  Thanks!

My husband and son really liked this - it did have a unique taste.  I used a 2lb bottom round roast - there was very little fat waste.  Also cooked for about 4 hours on high and the meat was shreddable - then I followed the recipe from there on.

I was looking for a delicious summer salad to serve as a side dish and am so happy to have found this recipe.  It complimented our BBQ chicken perfectly, and a few guests even went back for seconds ... of the salad!  I highly recommend this salad.  Note: the dressing recipe is huge; I used less than 1/2 of it to dress the salad.

I probably shouldn't be rating this because I ended up just cooking the meat in the crockpot with some water and then shredding it and then dumping bottle BBQ sauce on it.  It was really good.  Thanks for the idea!

YUM!!!  This is so delicious.  I often buy roasts because they are on sale, but I get stuck making them the same way all the time. This is such a good recipe.  I scaled the recipe down to 10 servings, but after removing all the fat, there was only enough meat left to make about 6 good sandwiches.  This is a perfect recipe for a laid back dinner with friends and beer.  So good.  This will go into my collection for sure.

I put a 3 pound roast in the slow cooker at about 8am on HIGH with a finely chopped 1/2 onion and water.  At 11am I went to shred the beef but it was still too firm.  I cut the beef roughly with a knife  so that the sauce would penetrate and added the sauce (recalculated for 12 servings for a 3 lb roast beef).  The only adjustments that I made to the sauce was that I added 1 tbsp of Clubhouse leGrille Mesquite Rubbing Marinade for that mesquite flavour (a good idea from other reviewers), and I did not add any salt.  After another 5 hours in the slow cooker on LOW, I thought that there was just too much juice even though I had removed the 1/2 cup as recommended.  My sauce was just too wet.  So I drained MOST of the juices out, cooked up another 1/2 sauce recipe (based on a 6 serving size) on the stove, and added it hot to the slow cooker shredded beef for another half hour of cooking.  Wow, was this ever awesome cooked like this!!   So next time, I'll make sauce based on 18 servings (for a 3 lb roast beef), use about half of the sauce as recommended in the recipe... then, a half hour before serving, drain off the excess liquids, and add the remaining sauce into the shredded beef.  I thought it was absolutely exquisite!!  My two girls, 2 and 5, loved the beef which rarely happens, and so did my husband!!  I would definately serve this to guests prepared this way.  This time I served it over rice, I'm serving the leftovers over fresh baked buns on Tuesday.

I 1/2 the recipe and added 1/2 packet of onion soup mix as others suggested also added a splash of liquid smoke flavoring and took it to work and got rave reviews. Two people asked for the recipe. I really liked the sweet with the tangy flavor. By the way most people ate it without the rolls or slaw. Thanks Elaine!

A much faster way to cook the beef is using a pressure cooker...I love mine.  I cut the recipe in half due to my 3 lb roast.  I cooked the roast with the spices and the 1 c. of water on steady "rock" for approximately 1 hour.  I could shred the beef easily with a fork.  I drained all but 3 tbls of the juice left in the pot, and then added the rest of the ingredients with only 1/2 c. ketchup, and 1/4 of Sweet Baby Rays.  Everyone loved it!

Yum. Even my husband from Kansas City loved this barbeque! I plopped the meat, water, and 1 pkg onion soup mix into the slow cooker, and cooked on low for 8 hours. By then the meat was very easy to shred. Next, I added the sauce ingredients to the cooker and let it continue on low for another 2 hours. It sat on warm for 2 more hours so I had to add some water to keep it moist. Everyone loved it.

Great recipe! I took the meat rooled it in  flour tortillas, put them into the freezer and later pulled them out and deep fried them. Bar-b-que burritos are a big hit in my house thanks to this recipe.

This recipe is one that we make with the intention of eating leftovers from. So tasty and filling. I substitute the ketchup with our favorite barbecue sauce for more of a kick. Fill up some hoagie rolls and add some sliced cheese and we're set!

my family and I really liked this.  the only problem I had was shredding the beef even after it had been cooking for 4 hours. I will be making this many times more.

Needs way more time in the slow cooker, and makes way too much sauce.

I used this recipe exactly, except I did reduce the amount of ketchup to 1 cup because someone had commented on the strong ketchupyness.  I served it to 8 adults and 5 young children (each comparable to half of an adult?) and had leftovers for maybe 4 more adults, so I probably wouldn't agree with the 28 servings.  It was a yummy meal!  I also didn't serve it on bread, although we did have bread with the meal.

This was the perfect BBQ Beef! The whole family loved it. I do have to admit my 4 year old son helped me make it and his hand slipped in measuring the vinegar, so there was quite a bit of extra vinegar but it tasted great anyway. I did use 1/2 ketchup and 1/2 BBQ sauce per other reviewers suggestions.

Yum!  This is so good.  I used a 2 lb roast, so I scaled back the recipe to 8 servings.  Instead of the salt, I used 1/2 packet of dry onion soup mix, and I replaced 1/2 c. of the ketchup with 1/2 c. Famous Dave's BBQ sauce.  I also used a few shakes of hot sauce since I didn't have any cayenne pepper.  I had to cook the roast quite a while to get it to the point of shreddable, but I just did that a day ahead of time and had the sauce ready to go so it was very easy to throw together to cook on low for a few hours the next day.

Cook time was a little longer than specified. Also needed to add bottled BBQ sauce (I used Jack Daniels Original Recipe) to give it that classic BBQ flavor. Overall, pretty good... a recipe I will make again, with my alterations.

Only problem was I scaled down the recipe and it disappeared too fast. Really great alone in a sandwich or with pickles, tomato, and/or lettuce as well. Used the sauce to make sloppy joes as well- was very good that way!

I made this ahead of time for a dinner at the cottage.  Cooked the meat, cut it up and poured the sauce over and froze it. I heated it on the bbq. I used more of the beef juice than called for, added a sliced onion and substituted 1 1/2 cups chipotle bbq sauce for the same amout of ketchup. It was fantastic!!!!!

This was pretty good and easy. I only used 1 lb of beef and cut the other ingredients down accordingly. It has a unique flavor and it was a nice change from standard bbq beef but my husband didn't really care for it and while the kids seemed to like it I don't think that it's something they would request so I'm not sure that I'll make it again.

Absolutely Delicious! No need for changes to the recipe...the only thing I did different was to use a tri tip for tenderness. I've made this several times and my husband (and his buddies) LOVE this.

I followed the recipe exactly (1/2 though since I used a smaller roast) and this was the best sauce I've ever had!  I cooked 5lb. sirloin roast on high 4 hours then cut it into large pieces and added the sauce.  It cooked another 4 hours and I sliced it very thin (too lean to shred) added it back to the sauce, stirred it really well and continued 1 more hour on high.  Very, very good - my meat loving family was extremely happy last night and the house smelled great!

I scaled this recipe down for my 2.5 lb roast...I have to say at first I was terribly disappointed because, like many others have said, it took at least 4 hours for even my small roast to become somewhat tender.  But, I didn't give up on it - I just chunked the meat into smaller pieces and added the rest of the ingredients and let it cook on low for about 5 more hours...and it turned out really tender.  Personally, I like a more intense flavor for my BBQ, so I did end up adding some bottled barbeque sauce after I first tasted it, but this is a very good starter recipe.

The meat was nice and moist.  I have made many different versions of BBQ beef, this one is not my personal favorite but it comes in a close second.  This one is the new favorite of my husband. I think next time I might try adding some onion to the second half of cooking to give it a little extra flavor.

I am a BBQ fanatic but recently was diagnosed with diabetes and had to give up all my molasses and brown-sugar-based BBQ sauces. 

While all the ketchup in this recipe keeps it from qualifying as "low carb," it is great it you're restricting your high-GI sugars.

This is by far and away the best BBQ recipe I've tried that is low sugar. Scaled to 4 servings, it only calls for 1 T of brown sugar.

I tried it on sliced beef brisket last time. Tonight I'm trying it on babyback ribs.

Mmm good!

I made this recipe this weekend for the Ohio State / Indiana game. I put 4 pounds of chuck/pot roast in the crock pot and covered with water and French onion soup. I had to cook it for about 4 hours before it was done enough to shred. I then saved ¾ cup of the broth in case I needed it (which I did). I used all of the ingredients as listed and did not adjust since I made 3 pounds less than what the recipe called for. I then poured in the ¾ cup of broth and let it cook in the crock pot over night. The beef was very tender and the flavor was really good. We ate probably about 15 sandwiches at least and I still have some left. I only had white wine vinegar so that is what I used, next time I think I will make sure I have straight white vinegar to kick up the tang a bit. Otherwise, REALLY good!

Great Recipe!  Proves that the crock pot again rules the kitchen.  I didn't have much time, so I placed a 3 lb. roast STILL FROZEN SOLID into the crockpot, and added all ingredients (only used 1/2 the salt and ketchup, but all the rest).  The roast cooked for 12 hours on low, and when I got home from work, i just shredded it and made sandwiches - the sauce wasn't burnt or stuck or anything!!  Awesome!!

Definitely another keeper and true to its name.  The peppers really gave it a great flavor along with the "sweet & tangy".  Will make this a regular for sure.

Needed something I could serve on a "busy mommy day", made this ahead of time and it was awesome.  Added a dash of liquid smoke and it was even better.

This was a very good bbq beef.  A tad on the sweet side but very yummy.  I think next time I might add a bit of liquid smoke and see how we like it.  Will make this again for sure.  I used leftover roast and the family loved it better than other "left over" recipes I've made with roast.

Divine!  I, too, had to cook the roast longer to make it easy to shred...about 4 hours on high.  The flavor of the sauce is soooo good!  I can't imagine adding any pre-made barbecue sauce to this because it would cover up all of the great flavor.  However, if you are expecting the "regular" flavor of barbecue sauce, you will not find it here.  This is exactly as the name states...sweet and tangy.  Excellent!!  Definitely a repeat recipe in our house!!

My husband and I loved this! Ours turned out really well.  I cut the recipe down for a 4 lb roast.  The meat had to cook for 7-8 hours on low before it could be shredded.  I was concerned about it coming out tasting really ketchupy so I added some more worchestershire sauce and vinegar and threw in about 1/3 cup of bbq sauce.  After cooking for 3 more hours, the flavors had combined beautifully, I am not sure if the bbq sauce was needed.  It tasted great.  We will definitely be making this again!

This is a great recipe, everyone loved it. I halved it for a smaller roast and it turned out well. I didn't find that the cook times were accurate though. In order to be able to easily shred the meat, I would have to cook the roast on low for 7 hours or on high for 4-5 hours.

I made this dish as directed with a few adjustments. I used 7 lbs of top round (it was on sale) rubbed with Penzeys Barbecue of the Americas seasoning. I also placed a slice onion in the bottom of the slow cooker. I was able to shred the meat after about 8 hrs. It was delicious. I served the meat with oven baked potatoes and Texas style beans. The next day we had the meat on large Kaiser rolls for lunch. I put a slice of American cheese in mine. Outstanding. This was very easy to make and is a crowd pleaser. I will certainly make this again but will try chuck if cheaper then top or bottom round beef. This recipe should also work with pork or chicken. Thanks for a great recipe!

Really good. The cooking time was off.  I made a 3 pound roast. After 3 hours on low, it wasn't even close to being ready. I sliced the roast and added the sauce. Turned the temp up to high and it was shreddable in 3 more hours. Will definitely make again, though.

I made this recipe for friends and family recently... everyone raved about it... and several stated it was the best beef barbecue they had ever eaten. Usually folks here make it with ground beef... so this one stood out from others... I will definitely use this recipe again. Thank you, Elaine.

I wouldn't like beef cooked like this.  But the sauce sounded delicious and I wondered what I could do with it.  I had cooked prawns in the frig, so I thought of using it for a dip or sauce.  Then I remembered that I had a shoulder of lamb.  I had cut a lot off it to put in the freezer, but I still had the bone with quite a lot of meat on it. I followed the recipe, except that I reduced the ingredients to a 1/4.  I am rather wary of ketchup in cooking, so I used a bit and made the measure up with very good tomato sauce that I had in the frig.  The result was excellent.

Browned one pound of hamburger and use this BBQ sauce minus 2 cups of ketchup.  Will make again.  Believe would be good with any kind of beef or port.

Cut recipe down to 7 servings with no other changes except cooking the meat longer.  Best BBQ my husband and I have had in years!  It is so good I keep trying to think of someone with whom I can share the recipe!

This was great - definitely needed WAY more cook time, and I used a cup less ketchup than called for, plus the serving size is off.  I did two roasts, one that was 5 lb., another that was 3-4 lb. and it fed maybe 20 people (a few had big appetites, though).

Loved it! Only change was to add onion soup powder to the water. Took between 5-6 hrs on low for this to be tender enough to shred. Served on large sesame hamburg buns. Very, very nice! Only problem - son, girlfriend not crazy about shredded beef on a bun.

Very good - enjoyed by adults and toddlers alike.  Reduced ketchup to 1 cup.  Mixed leftovers with enchilada sauce, carrots, potatoes, peppers and onions and wrapped in tortillas - sprinkled with cheese and broiled for a few minutes.  Very tasty both ways!  Will make again.

Tasted great.  Took longer than expected for the beef to become cooked enough to pull apart.  I would suggest cooking it all night, then pulling it in the AM, then add your ingredients to simmer all day.  Very tasty and easy.  Would be excellent for a crowd.  Served on toasted buns - my husband ended up having 3!

I had a lot of left over beef from the day before and was looking for a recipe to use up the rest. I came across this and I am glad I did. It tasted very good. I just threw my left over meat in the slow cooker with all ingredients listed. I added 2 cups of broth for my liquid portion and it turned out very nice. The kids even got seconds.

This recipe was quite tasty however it lacked a depth of flavor.  I did not make any modifications to the recipe.  The acidic bbq flavor pleasantly hit you with the first bite but then it vanished nearly as quickly.  The recipe was better the second day.

We thought this had a lot of flavor! Used up some chuck steak and stew meat, about 6 lbs total.  Perfect amount of sauce, did not have to add the reserved broth.   It is what is says, sweet and tangy.  All of us really liked it!  Put this on "Angie's perfect dinner rolls" from this site.

So delicious!! I used a 3 12/ lb boneless chuck roast....and halved all the ingredients for the BBQ sauce. I also used 1/2c. beef broth instead of the 1c. water. Added a tsp. of liquid smoke too! Very flavorful and tender....will make again Thanks!

This recipe must require the use of a "super" crockpot, because I have never been able to easily shred a roast after 4 hours. I seasoned my roast & browned on both sides before adding to crockpot. Also added beef broth instead of water & put all of the ingredients in from the start, since I had to go to work. When I came home, I shredded the beef & let cook some more until my husband came home. It was perfect!

I don't know if the time is right or not cuz I always cook in my slow cooker for longer,  I usually cook it for like 5-6 hours before shredding and then at least 2 hours or more after cooked thru.

This is a wonderful barbecued beef recipe! The title is exactly right; this meat is both sweet and tangy! It is really hot here, so I actually cooked it in the slow cooker outside on our front porch, so that we wouldn't heat up the house. Thanks so much for sharing this delicious recipe!!

This is a great recipe.  I found you do have to cook the meat in the water a lot longer then this recipe calls for.  I added a few drops of liquid smoke.  The second time I made this I was also low on ketchup and substituted the remaining amount with BBQ.  It worked just as well.

This recipe was awesome! I am not a big BBQ fan, but really liked the blend of flavors. I had thawed a 4lb Pikes Peak (similar to Rump Roast--very lean) roast to make jerky, but didn't have time to do so and needed to use it up. I cut the roast into chunks, threw all the ingredients into the crockpot, turned to high and went to work. When I came home, I shredded the meat and thickened the sauce with a little cornstarch/water slurry. Served on homemade Country Seed Bread from this site----yum! My men loved it. Here are the adjustments I made: 1.Was out of dry mustard, so used a squirt of yellow french's mustard. 2.Added a package of onion soup mix for extra flavor and texture. 3.Added one cup ketchup, 2 cups of a bottled sweet BBQ sauce, because I was low on ketchup. Thank you for such a good recipe!

Unfortunetly I have to say this recipe, as written was not good. It tasted like sweet ketchup. Nothing tangy about it. Just meat and ketchup. I ended up maybe tripling the amount of vinegar, spices and worchestire sauce as well as adding 3 tablespoons of Tabasco. With those additions it was actually quite good but very far from the actual recipe.

Loved this recipe. The only thing I did different was I put everything in the slow cooker and cooked it over night. Then shredded it in the morning and put it back in the slow cooker and let it cook for another few hours on low. It was great, not too strong for the ones with a touchy stomach. I will definitely make this again!!

Awesome Recipe!  I followed the recipe besides needing additional cooking time and adding Sweet Baby Rays at the end of the cooking time.  I served at a family reunion with 55 people and everyone loved it.

I have been looking for a BBQ beef recipe for years and just couldn't find the right one.  This is it, thanks Elaine!  I did add some chopped onion, and the cook time is WAY off as noticed by many. Plan at least 6 hours on low before being able to shred. Maybe it would help to chunk the meat beforehand.

I also found that my (small-about 3 lb.)roast had to cook several hours longer to become easy to shred. After about 4 hours, I took it out of the crock, cut into smaller pieces and returned to crock with the sauce. I let it cook on low for about 2-3 more hours before I could shred the meat easily, then returned to the crock until mealtime. The meat was delicious, definately sweet and tangy. Thank goodness I had the whole day to cook it though!

This recipe is hands down the best I have ever had for pulled BBQ....I have have done it both with beef and pork...I use a pork loin roast and then pull apart with forks and follow the recipe, sometimes I add more cayenne for more kick. Great Recipe!! Thanks!

A fantastic recipe.  The sauce was just right, and the flavor really cooked into the beef after shredding.  Great for a crowd of hungry football fans.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made a big mistake in not taking out the fat like the recipe suggested; mainly because I didn't have the time. I found this a little dry the first night, but after refrigerating it, it tasted really good the next day and I ate it for lunch two days. I think there should be more sauce though, I had to add extra bbq sauce.

I made this to applause this weekend. My boyfriend said it was the best home-cooked barbecue he ever had.

(I used half Kicker's ketchup for the ketchup.)

Not bad, but not great either.  Maybe it's just my personal taste, but I would prefer less tangy and more smoky.  Of course, I should have known by the "sweet and tangy"!  Still, I thought it tasted a little strange.

I cut the recipe in half and also took the sugestion to add a little BBQ sauce as well... I added about 1-2Tbsp BullsEye Bold Original to the water.  Otherwise, LOVED this recipe, it is a KEEPER!  However... definatley does take AT LEAST 4 hours before roast is tender enough to shred, so add that to your time.

I made this for a party and it was a great success.  My mother in-law even asked for the recipe.  The only change that I did was make extra sauce.  I think that this helps because it gives it extra juice and flavor.  Also, I like to cook my BBQ for extra time and this helps it from drying out.

The meat was tender but the BBQ sauce wasn't "tough" enough... too runny and a bit on the bland side.  Everyone ate it up and once I added about 1/2 cup of Famous Dave's Rich & Sassy BBQ Sauce + topped the toasted buns with fresh coleslaw (the REAL WAY TO EAT SOUTHERN BBQs!) these were absolutely divine!  So, I rate it on the "spaghetti-y" side of BBQ... add your favorite sauce to thicken & flavor it up & it'll be tops!

I made this for my son's first birthday party since most of the guests were adults and it was a HIT! Even the kids loved it! I have been asked by my mother in law to make it several times since- which is a HUGE compliment!  I am making it today for my brother in law's 30th birthday party and have scaled it up to 60 people.  I've roasted 30 pounds of beef and am making it in a large roaster-it's turning out great!  Whenever I make it I hold back on the garlic, though- I only use a third of what it calls for because it is REALLY garlic-y if you mince it yourself!  Try this out!  The ease and convenience of day before prep only make it better in my opinion!

This is not a bad recipe, it's just that it has a fair quantity of  ketchup as a base.  I cut the recipe down to serve 8 and it turned out ok. I did find that cooking on low just did not do the trick. My husband ate it but stated that he would not like this one again.

Seems pretty close to my Mom's recipe, which was from Joy of Cooking.

The flavor on this was very good. I just wish I could get someone else to make it for me.

I halved the recipe (only two of us);  so by calculations we should have gotten 12 servings. Try 4. 

By using only 3 1/2 lbs of beef, I figured the start four hours for the beef in the crock pot would have been plenty; not so much. There was no shredding of beef with a fork going on in my kitchen.

For me, I'll go out and buy a barbecue sandwich.  The prep on this turned me off this recipe.

I followed the directions as written. First the meat was not ready to shred on LOW with the time given, it takes much longer (maybe Elaine meant HIGH). Second I took out the 1/2 cup broth as directed but found that it should have been more, mine turned out very soupy. Finally after taking juices out before serving it was okay. Still a little too wet for a bun but it had a nice flavor.

Elaine, you're a star.  Excellent recipe except cooking times as universally noted.  I cooked 2 3-lb eye of round roasts (6 lb total vice 7 lb as recipe calls for) but didn't change other quantities.  Based on others' reviews I made following ingredient changes:  (1) added an envelope of Lipton's Onion Soup to the water to start--wonderful smell!! (2) used one cup ketchup and two cups Kraft mesquite BBQ sauce (3) used 12 drops of Tabasco instead of cayenne pepper (4) used 1 TBS of roasted garlic powder instead of fresh garlic.   I cut the roasts in half before cooking to make later handling/shredding easier.  I initially cooked beef for 10 hours on low but think 8 would have been enough.  I forgot to turn meat over half way through cooking--makes shredding top part of roast that didn't cook in liquid a little harder to shred with forks, but was still very easy.  Produced about 2 1/2 cups of beef juices--recipe calls for removing and reserving 1/2 cup.  Because several reviewers commented that recipe was too "saucy," I removed and reserved all but 1/2 cup of juice.  I ended up adding back about a cup of beef juice because my BBQ looked a bit dry after cooking for an hour.  I agree with other reviewers who said that only need to continue cooking for a short time after mixing in sauce ingredients--max 2 hours, definitely not 4 to 6 hours.

Good flavor. Made it on stove for second meal of pot roast (rather than just serving leftovers) using a third of ingredients because I had less meat. Only took about a half hour on low, but used garlic powder so picky eaters wouldn’t complain about pieces not cooked down and was able to keep warm for crazy schedule with part of family eating later. Some people commented 2 hours on low in crock pot not enough to have beef ready to shred and I wouldn’t think so – I certainly cooked the roast longer in the oven; try a long cook (4-8 hours) on low before shredding. (Note hours it shows for recipe: 8 1/2)

Pretty good, was out of worchester sauce so i used a1..and used mesquite kicker ketchup, and had to cook it on high for about 6 hours and it was only a 4 lb roast, before it would shred, none the less my husband really enjoyed it and i will make it again.

Freaking delicious.  I added a little variety by simmering the roast in beef broth, sliced onion and black pepper.  I also added powdered chipotle pepper to the sauce :)

This was fantastic.  I never saw this smokey ketchup other reviewers were talking about, but I just added a bunch of shakes of liquid smoke myself.  My only reasons for downgrading this are for one, the servings are way off.  I changed it to 7 as I had a much smaller roast (pork roast, in my case).  I probably only made about 3 or 4 meals for myself out of it?  Secondly, as I'm not a ketchup fan in the first place, I took the advice of others and downgraded the ketchup.  (My resized recipe called for 3/4 cup.  I only used 1/2 cup; it was still very moist so no worrying about that.)  I made everything else as-is except perhaps adding a little more cayenne per my tastes.  As with others, I also made this a two-day affair, cooking the first time for 6 or so hours as it was impossible to shred previous to this as others have noted.  The fat was easier to remove when cold from the fridge the next day.  It was wonderful; I was standing up eating it out of the pot.

I thought this recipe was good, but like many others, I too had to cook this much longer before I could shred the meat-about 5 hours. Also, I cut back on the amount of ketchup and added a little more brown sugar as many suggested. It ended up tasting a lot like my mom's recipe. I'm sure I will be making this again.

Pretty darn awesome recipe!  What a winner.  Only change I made was to use 2 parts BBQ sauce and 1 part ketchup.  Plus I cooked it on the stovetop instead of in the crockpot.  Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe.  Will definitely make again.

I cook it for 4 hours and add water 1/3 cup at a time to keep it moist. I don't drain the juice, but use it to make the sauce in the crock pot. I cook it for another 6 hours and it comes out perfectly every time!

This was good.  I loved the sauce, but after making it for a group of people they said they liked pork better for BBQ.  The sauce was nice and tangy and like others I used Heinz ketchup Kickers (it had tabasco sauce in it).  It was really good.  Next time I will try with pork instead.

This was a big hit with my guests. Didn't change much except took the advice from other members..used 1/2 BBQ sauce & 1/2 ketchup and put in onions. I also made extra sauce..didn't seem like it was enough sauce. Thanks for the recipe. This one is worth the effort.

Really good, both my 6 year old son and my husband loved it.  The only problem I had was the roast wasn't ready to be shredded after 4 hrs, next time I'll wait 6.  Instead I just cut it into large chunks, added the sauce, and cooked 4 more hours then shredded.  Still excellent though!

Fabulous! I put my own twist on this as well! I've never done a chuck in my crock pot so this was a great idea! I served it on some homemade wheat buns I made. Oh so good and oh so meaty!

This is an excellent recipe!  I have used both beef and pork and received rave reviews!  I would cut the salt in half though... it was a little salty for my taste as written.

2007 review and I gave it a 2. =This was an easy recipe; however I thought it was very dry. I will not use it again. Update in 2017=I still don't like it. I forgot I had tried it before!  The sauce was flavorful; however, the meat is TOUGH!  The meat shredded easily but was too tough as nails. I'm giving up on beef barbecue recipes all around--will stick with pork or go out and get beef barbecue if I have a craving for it!

This was different and very good.  My son wanted 3rds.  It is very sweet and tangy just like the title.  I will be making this one again.

very good, but I thought it needed something to give it some more kick...maybe instead of ketchup I will use BBQ sauce next time. I am giving this 5 stars because my 3 sons really liked it and even had seconds.

Excellent, and my whole family voted this a 5 star recipe.  I scaled this down to a 3 lb roast and we really enjoyed every bit of it. 
I am making this for our Christmas party (enough for 82 people) and I know everyone will love it!

I used a different cut of meat for this so I can only comment on the sauce, which was spectacular.  I'm going to remember this recipe.  I used a boneless top round roast.  Since the roast didn't cook long enough to shred easily, I used an electric knife to cut it into narrow, bite-sized pieces.  Then, I used small french rolls to create excellent BBQ sandwiches.  This sauce has just the right elements of sweet, gusto, and overall flavor.  I highly recommend it.

Thank you for sharing this recipe.  I have tried many, many different recipes.  Just like you I usually combine several recipes into one, but I have never found one as tasteful as yours.  It is perfect in every aspect.  The entire family truly enjoyed this one.  From now on, this is the only recipe I will use for our BBQ.  Thanks again for sharing such a wonderful BBQ.  VERY YUMMY!!!!
