I picked Saskatoon berries (service berries) fresh two days ago and today made this fabulous crumble cake. I made it exact to the recipe including the sugar as these berries are not naturally that sweet on their own. I used fresh squeezed lemon which adds brightness tartness and enhances the Berry flavour! It turned out incredibly well and was simple to make. Thank you for the recipe it was a huge hit and definitely a keeper!!

Loved this recipe! It came out delicious. I used bag of frozen mixed berries instead and cut down on sugar (for crumb layer used 1 cup and for berry layer about 1/2 cup brown sugar in both cases). It came out plenty sweet. Next time will try without cream cheese because the cake goes nicely with vanilla frozen yogurt. Great recipe!

This was my first time using Saskatoon berries. As I had never tried these berries before I made a couple of individual ones with the mixtures. One I added the cream cheese and the other I used goat cheese instead. Liked both but preferred the goat cheese.

Its a good recipe a little more work than most crisps. I've also used it with cherries using less sugar.

Made exactly to recipe. Very good however quite sweet. Next time will cut back on the sugar in the crumb layer.

We followed this recipe as directed and found it extremely sweet (mostly from the base). While I likes the idea of the cream cheese the flavour of it did not stand out. I don't think I would make this recipe again.

Great recipe!!I changed it and made it gluten free. I used cup for cup Gf flour and GF oats and butter for the oil. I will be making this to take to a BBQ in a Gluten Free household.
