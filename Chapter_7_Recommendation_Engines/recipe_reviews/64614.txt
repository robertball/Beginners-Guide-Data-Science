My husband and I thought it was great!  I always adjust for our tastes.  Here is what I did:  eliminated the onion, sauteed chopped gaarlic instead, 2 1/2C ham, added salt and pepper, used tablespoons of mustard and worcestershire.  Very quick and very easy!  I will make this again for guests with a salad and homemade cornbread.

This was good, but I accidently put the ham in before the 25-30 minute-long simmer, so it was a little tough. My mistake!

This was very good soup, despite the fact that I goofed up the recipe. I ended up using WAY too much bouillon, as I used the Herb Ox double strength cubes, but didn't realize it, 'til the soup was done and I wondered why it was so salty. I also added the ham at the beginning of the cooking time instead of the end, another goof. The ham tasted over-cooked, but upon reviewing the recipe, after the fact, I noticed I should have waited 'til the end, which would have contributed a much fresher taste. Even w/my lack of attention, the soup was tasty, if a bit salty. I'll definitely make it again, PROPERLY this time!

Loved this soup.  I added garlic and potatoes.  I used left over honey ham.  The brown sugar and honey ham gave it a slightly sweet taste.  The only thing I will do differently next time is put the ham in at the very ends since I froze mine (unfreezing and microwaving again was a little much for the ham).

Soup turned out great!  Did not use black beans because I had none...threw in some chopped potatoes.  Great easy soup!
