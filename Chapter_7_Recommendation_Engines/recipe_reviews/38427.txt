Simple and delicious - a great side dish for grilled steak.  I cut the recipe in half and sprayed the inside of the foil with a bit of Pam so nothing would stick.  I used seasoned salt vs. plain salt and although you could add various herbs and spices to this I think less is more.....

Pretty darn good and very easy to make. They can stick to the foil so extra oil or butter is required. Also, I like them with regular onion and bacon bits. Just prior to serving, I use the uncooked chopped green onion, so that they look fresh instead of dried up and browned.

I used new potatoes instead and it turned out very well, except I used too many, so they didn't all touch the bottom of the foil and get crispy edges.

Sorry, but I wasn’t impressed with this one at all.  My experience has told me that anything cooked in a foil packet is going to steam rather than get crispy, and this recipe did exactly that.  My hope was that the butter would brown them a bit, but that didn't happen.  They were pale and didn’t look appetizing, and I think I'm being generous with my 3* rating.  I think this would have been much better if done the way I typically roast potatoes, in the oven, on a baking sheet or in an oven-proof skillet, and left uncovered.  I may try again, but not as written.

Hubs made this for us tonight and it was simple but delicious. He said he enjoyed himself making it too, largely because of the flexibility to be creative with seasonings. The green onions, however, are a must. The submitter is right - they really do contribute a lot of flavor, much more so than just plain onions do. Rather than large baking potatoes, we used baby Yukon Golds, as we love their creaminess and buttery flavor. Hubs seasoned them with Penzey's Shallot Salt and Penzey's Chicago Seasoning. So many different herbs or spices could be used to season these, but I'm sure they're just as delicious as is.

I make this often.  I go heavy on the onions and use olive oil instead of butter.  I also ad a clove of garlic for each individual pack and sometimes frozen green beans.  Yummy

These were very good!  It might help to spray foil with Pam cooking spray so potatoes won't stick!  Also, next time will probably put in more butter and maybe some bacon bits!!!

Great potatoes. I have made them with green onions as well as regular onions. Wonderful with steak or sausages on the grill.

Just a suggestion on the name, bbq isn't an accurate description, maybe 'grilled potatoes' would be better.

Excellent Starter recipe....I ended up using red potatoes, seasoning salt,pepper, and started with a layer of butter in the foil, then potatoes sprinkle with green onion and more butter, then more potatoes sprinkled with green onions on top layer with real bacon bits and more butter

I didn't make enough for my family of 5 -- these potatoes were gone in a minute, and everyone wished I had made more.  Loved how simple and delicious they were.  Terrific side dish paired with meat, fish, chicken, or eggs.

I only used 2 very large potatoes, same amount of onions. Really great flavor and oh so simple! Definitely spray the foil w/Pam & dot w/extra butter.  The onions meld with the butter so nicely.  Thank you for a great addition to the potato family!!

We enjoyed these with our BBQ last night. I added a bit of minced garlic to the packet, because we love garlic! They turned out pretty good. Nothing exceptional, but pretty good.

Have made these for years, but prefer regular white or yellow onion sliced. For those complaining of them not being crispy and browning, I don't find anywhere that says they are supposed to be crispy. I don't pre-cook mine in the microwave. I cut them, skin and all, into thick French fry shapes, lay them out on heavy duty foil sprayed with cooking spray (I use a mister filled with olive oil), top with small chunks of butter, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. After sealing the packets tightly, I place them on the hot grill and flip about every 5 minutes, cooking a total of about 30 minutes (may take longer if making large packets). It is best to use a spatula/turner instead of tongs to flip the packets to reduce the chance of tearing the foil. With the butter in the packets and 30 minutes cooking time, there is some browning, but they will not be crispy-just great tasting.

These are very good potatoes to make on the grill.  I have been making these for several years now.  I also like to add sliced summer squash and use a sliced sweet onion instead of green onions.  You may also want to try to use quartered red potatoes and leave the skin on.  It saves time in not having to peel and slice the potato.

These did not brown at all and could really benefit from some garlic.  I sprinkled additional green onion and fresh parsley on at serving time. Just ok.  Maybe would be better served with sour cream, bacon bits and cheese-wish I'd thought of that sooner.

The flavor of these potatoes is great, however, we like a crispy potato on the outside.  I baked them in the over, b/c the grill was being used. I did add some garlic cloves, and baked at 325.  I even broiled for 10 mintues but could not get them crispy.  Will make again and not use foil.

Not as tasty as I was expecting, but definitely a keeper of a side dish (quick, easy, tasty enough).

Delicious and faster than a baked potato. I followed the recipe, but left out the pepper.  My barbeque has lots of btu's so I cooked it at medium. I took the advice of another reviewer and held back some of the green onion tops to sprinkle on at the end. Will be making again!

made exactly as stated and this wasn't very good.  ate a little then salvaged the rest for home fries in a pan with more butter, salt and pepper and were much better.

This is an easy recipe, great for a cookout when you are busy and want a recipe that will appeal to a large group of people.  The green onions I had added got obliterated during grilling, so next time I would add some at the end for both flavor and appearance.  Overall, a nice and simple recipe that is easy to adjust to suit your tastes.

made as directed with lots of oil on the aluminum foil and half a stick of butter and seasoning salt.
