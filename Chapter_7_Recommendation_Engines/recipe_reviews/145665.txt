Looks good but I'm wondering what the 2 tablespoons of butter are for? They're in the ingredient list but not mentioned in the instructions.

This pie is delicious! I made it for my grandpa who said that his mom used to make the best pineapple-rhubarb pie but hasn't had it since.  To be honest, it didn't sound too good to me.  But I made it anyway and he LOVED it! My sister and I also LOVED it.
Great recipe and easy to make. 
One thing I messed up on, I cooked the rhubarb first and then mixed it in with the crushed pineapple.  I also used two cans of pineapple and only 2 1/2 cups of rhubarb.  Even with the modifications, it turned out delicious!

Cut sugar to 3/4 cup.  After cooking 15 minutes at 425 degrees F, drop temperature to 350 and cook an additional 45 minutes or until crust is slightly browns.  This should help remove the much too sugary taste and leave some of the natural tartness of the rhubarb.

Great recipe.  At 80 + I finally made a rhubarb pie with a filling that did not bake down to 1/2" thick. Very substantial sized pie.  I will cut back on the sugar to 3/4 cup.   After baking for 15-20 min. turn down to 350 for an additional 40 min.and cover with foil to prevent over browning.  Was nice made with freshly picked rhubarb.  My husband loved it. Delicious served warm with ice cream.

I gave it a five even tho I modified it.  I used a whole 15 ounce can of crushed pineapple and 4 cups rhubarb.  I also used my own scratch recipe for the crust.
Will definitely make it over and over again.  It is a keeper. Thanks

I reduced the sugar to a rounded 3/4 of a cup and this pie was exceptionally good . Definitely I will be making it again.
Oh and the two tablespoons of butter... spotted on top of the filling before the top crust went on.

Substituted 2 tb tapioca flour + 1 t cornstarch instead of flour. Made it with gluten free pie crust. Used 1/2 c sugar and 1/4 c agave nectar. Amazing! Perfectly sweet and tangy!
