BY FAR THE BEST COOKIES IN THE WORLD!!! I can't believe how well these turned out! I took a commercial baking class in school, and we had a recipe for oatmeal cookies that we would sell to the public, and it was NOWHERE near as good as these cookies! I took some of the suggestions from reviewers and added 1 tsp vanilla and 3 cups of oats instead of 2. They turned out amazing! I didn't freeze them, I just scooped by teaspoonful onto an ungreased cookie sheet and put into the oven for 12 minutes and they turn out perfect! If they dont turn out for you, you must not be doing something right. They are foolproof. As long as you cream together the right ingredients with an electric mixer, they turn out the right consistancy. 
My mom even agrees that they are the best cookie she's ever had, and thats saying something because she makes hers from my great grandmothers 100 year old family recipe! Thanks so much for posting this recipe! This one is quickly becoming a family fave!!!

really good cookie, really easy to do.  I scoop mine out and freeze them on a cookie sheet, then store them in a zippie freezer bag for ready-to-bake cookies anytime.  yes, you can take them out of the freezer and pop them in the oven, just takes a couple minutes longer to bake.

AWESOME!!! This is the recipe I remember from childhood school lunches!!  I added 1 tsp vanilla and omitted the chips.  Excellent!!  The oil is what gives it that special texture.

Hold on and let me put down my second warm, chewy cookie for a second to type this...okay, these were amazing!  I was skeptical because the oil, butter and sugar looked odd at first, but as soon as I added the eggs, the dough began to look good.  And were these cookies ever good!  I guess those cowboys really know what they're doing.  My changes: Substitution of butter for margarine and the addition of one teaspoon of vanilla.  I highly recommend making these!

Can't stop eating these cookies! I added a tsp. of vanilla, cut the white sugar to 2/3 cup and added 3/4 cup each of semi-sweet and white choc. chips. Always refrigerate the dough for a couple of hours before you bake the cookies. Otherwise they spread out too much.Truly amazing cookies!

Where's the vanilla extract? Great flavor. Used 1/4 c. oil and 3/4 c. unsalted butter and added 1/2 chopped pecans and 1 tsp vanilla extract.

I added extra quick oats like some others have suggested (almost 3 cups total!)and these came out great.  I didn't increase the sugar with the extra oats and I liked that they weren't sickeningly sweet.  My boys aren't big chocolate fans, so these are a great find for them.

great cookies! I always get compliments when I make this recipe. I have altered it several times to make cinnamon chip and apple cookies. In this case I would substitute cinnamon chips for butterscotch chips and add about 1/2 Cup (give or take) of a firm cooking apple cut into small chunks. Turns out very yummy.

The cookies are awesome.  Best oatmeal cookies I've made.  However, I read the reviews before baking and made note of certain ones.  So, with their advice, I  made some adjustments.  I decreased the oil to 1/4 cup,  used 3 cups of oatmeal, 1 stick of butter instead of margarine, and of course used vanilla extract.  I couldn't understand either why the recipe didn't use vanilla.  So, I added 1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract and 1 tablespoon of cinnamon.  Oatmeal cookies without cinnamon?  With the adjustments made,  will use this recipe again and again.  Thank you to the reviewers for sharing their adjustments.  It improves the recipes.

Yummy, yummy, yummy!!!!! These cookies are great. Kid friendly and adult friendly too.  They are so buttery tasting.  I omitted the butterscotch chips and used 3 cups of oats.  They can't stay around long in my house.  Thanks for sharing.

I didn't think this recipe needed anymore reviews, then I actually baked and tasted one of these. I would have given it 5 stars but I did tweak it slightly, I added raisins that had been soaking in hot water and vanilla to plump them back up, I used 1 cup wholemeal flour, 1 cup of brown sugar and a good tsp of honey instead of the white sugar, I added choclate chips, and used butter instead of margerine, I also used a little extra flour and extra cup of oats as the dough seemed wet but it might my adjustments that made it so. The cookies were lovely, not too sweet and they have a lovely texture. I have half of the dough in my freezer so I can always have fresh cookies at hand, nothing better! Thanks for the recipe.

Oh. My. Lord.  I've been making these for years, and they're hands down my favorite cookie.  I like them with chocolate chips, and Hubs likes them with craisins instead of chocolate for a twist on oatmeal raisin.  My kids devour them, and everyone I've ever made them for has loved them as well.  I make them pretty much as written, and bake them for exactly 9 minutes each batch, or 10 if I've chilled the dough.  Chilling for just a half hour or so helps them not to spread, and using margarine and oil instead of butter ensures a moist and chewy cookie that is crispy on the edges.  These are just as good the day after as they are straight from the oven.

These were INCREDIBLE! I ended up adding 1 tsp. of vanilla since that seemed to be the general opinion of most of the other reviews, as well as the extra oats, but not a full cup extra- only 1/2 cup more is needed. I also added roughly 1 tsp. of cinnamon and subtracted the butterscotch chips altogether. I replaced them with 1/2 c. cinnamon chips and a generous 1/2 c. raisins and they turned out AMAZING! I also used parchment paper which I would strongly recommend. My bake time was about 9 min. 30 seconds and it was perfect!! I will make these again and again- next time adding peanut butter to the batter and using peanut butter chips. This is going to be a regular in my house!!

We loved this cookie! I substituted raisins for the chips this time around. The recipe actually made 43 cookies and the perfect cooking time for mine was 8 minutes. Thanks for sharing!

Holy mackerel!  These are fantastic!  I love oatmeal cookies and was looking for a change from the regular variety.  Per other reviewers I cut the sugar (2/3 c white and 3/4 c brown), added a splash of vanilla and 3/4 c or so of chopped pecans.  Also, I don't have anything but real butter in my house so I used that instead of margarine.  I am blown away!  Will make again and again!

For those of you who can get confused/frustrated when reading the reviews of a recipe because of all the proposed changes, I will say that I made NO changes to this recipe AT ALL and they were AMAZING!
I made this for myself and 8 of my friends and by then end of the night 35 of the 36 had been eaten! I think that speaks for itself.

After reading several reviews, I added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and increased the oats by 1/2 cup because my batter was a bit moist.  I did not have the butterscotch chips, so I tried Herseys Cinnamon chips instead - OMG.  This is the best cooking I have ever made!!!  Rave reviews and recipe requests from those who have had the pleasure of satisfying their sweet tooth with this wonderful, wonderful cookie.  Thank You.  If you took all the 5 star cookie recipes, this would certainly be one of the top prices!  Thanks for sharing!

To say that this is a good cookie is like saying a Rolls Royce is a nice car.  While the statement is true enough, it really doesn't do it justice.  These cookies knocked my socks off and every other oatmeal cookie I've ever had is tasteless crud in comparison.  P.S.  Thanks to other reviewers who came before me, I added a healthy splash of vanilla and an extra cup of oatmeal.  I'm glad I did.

Oh my Lord.. these are, hands down, the BEST oatmeal cookies I have ever put in my mouth! I did a couple very small changes but nothing that would make or break this cookie recipe. I thought the dough looked a little too.. what's the word.. soft? mushy? I thought it needed just a little more oats and flour. Also I didn't have butterscotch or chocolate chips so I left that out. Maybe they wouldn't need more flour/oats if they had raisins or chips in them. Regardless.. these cookies are fantastic!! Nice and crisp on the outside and still soft and chewy in the center (not too chewy like they're raw.. just nice n soft). This will definitely be the recipe I use every time i make oatmeal cookies. I wish I could give more than 5 stars.

I love this recipe!  It's so versital.  I added an extra cup of oatmeal like other's suggested.  I also used 1/4 cup of creamy peanut butter and 1/4 cup of oil instead of just oil.  I added 2 tsp of vanilla and about 3/4 cup of chocolate chips in addition to the butterscotch.  I also used butter instead of margerine since I never have it on hand.  This would be great as a oatmeal raisin cookie w/ cinnamon, a chocolate chip oatmeal cookie....really the sky is the limit.  I do lightly "slam" the cookie sheet on the counter to get all the air out of the cookie.  The result is a slightly crispy exterior and super chewy on the inside.  This is a fantastic recipe that will be used over and over.

My coworkers are going NUTS over these! And normally, I just eat cookies the day I make them and I'm not interested the next day since they aren't as amazing as fresh outta the oven. Not with these! Yum! I added some M&Ms and a few fun-size Milky Way bars I chopped up (trying to use up some junk that's sitting around). The Milky Way takes these over the top and pairs nicely with the butterscotch. I was pleasantly surprised by these - I expected flatter, possibly greasy cookies, but they're the perfect balance of chewy with a slight crunch when you bite into it. I'm enjoying one now as I write this! This recipe is a keeper!

Good!! Defiantly not like any oatmeal cookie I have ever tasted! Subbed in olive oil and butter. First batch, I cooked for nine minutes in my convention oven and they turned out great, but the second batch for some reason cooked really fast so I decreased the cooking time to 7 minutes and the rest of the cookies turned out perfect! Got rave reviews all around but they were a lot sweeter than I expected- a little too much for my taste. I will definitely make these again but not for myself.  Thanks!!

Delicious cookie! I read the reviews before making these. The first time I made these I used 3 cups oats like others suggested but I like moister cookies so I used 2 cups oats like stated in the recipe and enjoyed them much better. I used chocolate chips instead of butterscotch. My family is addicted!

Very good. I wanted a healthier cookie so I made a few changes: Applesauce instead of oil, whole wheat/ all purpose flour blend, and a sugar/ splenda blend. I also didn't have any butterscotch chips so I used chocolate instead. Will make again.

I used old-fashioned (not quick oats) and these were still AWESOME!  I used 3 cups of oats and 1 tsp vanilla.

Very good. Made today for first time. I added a small package of vanilla pudding, just something I've always done with cookies. They were amazing and all the kids (5), and my husband, loved them. I doubled the batch. I didn't run into trouble till towards the end when the dough was at room temp. and the cookies just spread on the hot pan. Next time i will keep the dough in the fridge so its firm. It filled my cookie jar, and I've frozen probably 5 dozen or so. I will keep this and keep making them!

I just made these cookies.  they are light and crispy.  I'm bringing them to work as a surprise to everyone.  I was concerned with the oil in the recipe but honestly they aren't greasy at all.  I used healthy oil, olive oil, to counteract my concern.  Mmmm  gonna make ice cream sandwiches out them in the morning.

My cookies spread to much and seemed oily. I did not care for the butter and oil combo. I had to add more flour to make them less greasy. But, I just feel like its missing something. I added chocolate chips and butterscotch chips to my cookies. It was fun to try something new and they were good, just not great. Thanks for sharing

anybody who says these cookies were not good need to go back in the kitchen and try again. i have been using this site for 2years and this is the first time i was compelled to write a review. i have made oatmeal cookies,oatmeal raisin cookies, chocolate chip, oatmeal chocolate chip,heathbar toffee and chocolate chips. this is THE cookie recipe. >>>>>>Still using this recipes 7 years after writing this review and it's still awesome.  I started blending up the dry oatmeal and mixing it with the flour and it just got even better.  I'll post pictures later

Perfect; the best oatmeal cookie around.  I added an extra 3/4 cup of oats, and added a splash of vanilla extract, as others suggested. These make excellent sandwich cookies with  a bit of chunky peanut butter (warmed in the microwave) between them.  Lovely.

This makes a good cookie base, but I had to add a few things and I changed the marg/oil for 1 c butter.  I also added 1/2 c peanut butter and 1/2 c unsweetened coconut flakes.  I did like the others suggested and also added 1 tsp of vanilla.  We love these cookies and will definately be making them again.  Thanks for posting the recipe.

Very delicious. .. I added within the 3 cups of oats (as other reviews suggested) 2 packets of instant apple - cinnamon oatmeal, for more flavor and a tblsp. of flax seed, for a more healthy version.  Everything else, as recipe says.  Everyone in my household loved them! Thanks for sharing Cowboys

I thought these were excellent with the changes made that others suggested.  Add 1 tsp of vanilla but I only added 1/2 EXTRA C. of oats for fear the cookies would turn out too dry.  Glad I did.  Turned out great!

Five ONLY w/ the following changes, remove the oil & margarine, replace w/ 1 cup of butter.  increase the flour to 3 cups, decrease the oats to 1 cup, and increase the baking powder to 1 tsp.  These changes make it a 5 Star rating!

These are good, but a bit too sweet for my taste buds.  To be honest, I think the butterscotch chips contributed to this.  I halved the recipe and subbed coconut oil for the oil & margarine, but otherwise made it as written.  Next time, I'll use about a third less sugar if I use the butterscotch or any other sweet addition.

Fantastic cookies! And they they make so many. Not too sweet in my opinion. I did add a little extra flour and oats just because a cookie that spreads is not pretty. This will be my cookie recipe from now on!

YUM! I added 1 tsp vanilla. I did put the batter in the fridge for a while b/c they really spread out for me- these were really thin cookies. After being in the fridge for a while they spread a tad bit less. Thanks Ellie!

I've tried many oatmeal cookies from Allrecipes. first I added one more cup of oatmeal (like most of the reviewers suggested)and the batter was still very loose , then when I baked them the bottom was very dark , also it was so sweet and thin . they tasted like granola bars not like cookies.

Lots of butterscotch flavor.  I cut the butterscotch chips to 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup dark chocolate chips.  I like more of a dark brown sugar flavor in cookies, but this one didn't have that.  Even so - Yum! Yum!

After seeing the reviews for this cookie and following the recipe, I thought I would come out with a fantastic cookie.  This cookie was awful!!  I don't normally bake cookies that call for veggie oil, but I tried this one anyway.  I swear you could taste the oil.  I couldn't even pawn these cookies off on my 13 year old son and all of his hungry friends!!  It was hard and not at all tasty.  I consider myself a fairly good cook and baker, but this recipe, along with all of the positive reviews did leave me wondering if I had done something wrong!

These were so good! I also liked that you could change it up according to your liking. I decided to add 1/2 cup of butterscotch chips and 1/2 cup of chocolate semi-sweet morsels. Next time I will probably add white chocolate chips and omit the butterscotch (not a big fan of those). I did do as some other reviews suggested and added 1 tsp vanilla extract and 1/2 tsp cinnamon. I also added 3 cups of quick cooking oats. They came out wonderfully delicious! Make sure you keep a close eye while baking so that you don't overcook. There is nothing better than a chewy cookie!! Thanks!

These were pretty tasty cookies! I did do as other reviews had suggested and added 1 tsp vanilla and upped the oats to 3 cups, also used raisins and pecans instead of the chips. My first batch didn't spread much, just puffed up. So I lightly pressed down the next batch and they were much better. They're a very nice soft cookie, not too sweet. Will be making again.

This recipe was just what I was looking for: gooey and soft...not too bready.

Although to make sure and achieve my goal, I made a few alterations to the recipe. I put only 1 1/2 cup flour. I put an extra 1/2 cup oatmeal. I put in 3/4 tsp salt instead of the 1/2 called for. I did not use butterscotch chips. Instead I loaded these with tons of raisins and dried cherries. Yummy! tastes like a Starbucks oatmeal raisin.

Very simple cookies to make and delicious, too! The only thing I changed was I omitted the butterscotch chips, but only because I didn't have any.

This recipe is delicious! The only ingredient swap I did was to use butter instead of margarine. I've made them twice already, and also wrote the recipe onto a 3x5 card and stuck it in my recipe box for easy access. The oil works!

Yummy! I substituted butter/shortening for the margarine because I don't buy margarine, so I did not make it exactly the same but it came out good. No problems w/the recipe. Made rounded teaspoons. After the first batch, I added vanilla and cranberries for the second batch, then I added walnuts to that for the third batch, and I finally ended up adding ghirardelli double chocolate baking chips to the last batch. So, the recipe grew. Did not have any problems with the 2cups quick oats, But I threw in some old fashioned oats just because I like to see the grains and because I am trying to justify all the fat and sugar. This recipe doesn't need the additions, I just like playing with my food:) almost forgot, I used 1/2 whole wheat just because I always do and don't see any reason why I would use all white, it's very good, still sweet, and extra fiber:) I can almost not feel guilty for eating 1/2 dozen while I bake them!

My daughter just loved these oatmeal cookies!  I only used 3/4 cup butterscotch chip - plenty sweet with the brown sugar.  We like chewy cookies in our kitchen, so I started checking them @ 8 minutes.  Don't overbake them otherwise they will be crunchy!

Crunchy and sweet :0) Added the 1 cup of extra oats and 1 tsp vanilla per suggestions. Update 2014-Made them again without the extra oats and still delish!!! Great when you're out of butter! :)

I made three batches of these, with a little tweaking to each. The first I followed almost exactly, except added 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, omitted the chips. Yum. Second I added 1 cup of pumpkin, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, & 1 tsp cinnamon to make a yummy oatmeal pumpkin cookie. For the third and final batch, I added 1 cup of chopped and peeled apples, 1 tsp vanilla, and 2 tsp of cinnamon for a yummy apple cinnamon oatmeal cookie. MMMM!

LOVED these easy to make cookies. The dough was perfect for scooping with my dough scooper and made perfect portion size cookies. I added 1/2 a cup of chopped pecans and 1/2 a cup of sweetened coconut rather than the butterscotch chips. I did follow the other reviewers recom'ds about adding a tsp of vanilla. I can't wait to make these again!!

These were excellent!  The texture was perfect.  My husband doesn't like oatmeal cookies, but he really liked these.  I used coconut in place of the chips and also used butter instead of margarine and they turned out great.

Sadly, I consider myself a chocolate chip snob...I've never gravitated toward a chocolate chip cookie I haven't liked...I came across this recipe and it just sounded good... so I "cowboy'd up" (*groan*) and gave it a shot.... I was nervous the whole time... until I tasted the dough (I know, I know)...and at that point, knew that I had a winner.  These were awesome... they were chewy... they were crunchy... they were light...and the butterscotch chips a pleasant change.  The only thing is that the first batch got stuck to my cookie sheet... so I had to stop and scrub that off... but then I broke out the parchment... and from then on, it was smooth sailing.  This is a keeper!  Thank you for this wonderful cookie!!

Straight up, across the board 5 stars.  So many options too.  I initially mixed this with no chips.  After putting the first batch in the oven, I added semi-sweet chocolate chips to the remaining dough.  After putting the chocolate chip batch in the oven, I mixed in some craisins.  All were great, but oddly enough, I liked the chocolate chip batch best...and I'm not a chocolate person.  I think it did a better job of taking the edge off the sweetness.  I might use less sugar next time.  Probably will try raisins and pecans.  DO use butter.  DO refrigerate dough before cooking (seriously, do this). DO add about an extra 1/2 cup of oats.  DO add vanilla.  DO try different options.

Excellent recipe, thanks for sharing! However, I did make a few adjustments; 3 cups oats, 1 tsp. vanilla, 2 tsp. cinnamon (as suggested by others) plus 1/2 tsp. ground cloves and 1 1/2 cups Craisins (dried cranberries). I flattened them slightly before baking. Great texture and very flavorful!

I had to change things a little because I had to substitute...but they were great.  I used 1 cup of butter flavor crisco instead of the 1/2 veg oil and 1/2 margarine.  I also added 1 tsp cinnamon. And omitted the butterscotch chips because I didn't have any.

Great recipe! I also substituted vanilla instead of chips and butter instead of margrine. Crispy yet soft in the center. Thank you, I would say just like my grams cookies.

just awesome! brought them to work and everyone said they were great! will def make this again. however, I did make some substitutions.  I ground up whole steel-cut oats as I did not have any instant/quick cook oats. Because of this, they came out denser, chewier and healthier with more fiber.  I did add vanilla and cinnamon as some other reviewers suggested.  Who doesn't put vanilla in their cookies?  I didn't have butterscotch chips but I did have some Ghiradelli white choc. chips! that's it.  this is the kind of recipe you can fool around w/a bit and add your own flavors and it will most likely be a good cookie!

Yum, Yum awesome. What a great twist on oatmeal cookies.  I did add some raisins to one batch and this was even better!

These cookies are delish!!  I did read the reviews and baked half of the cookies per the recipe.  Great!  The second half, I added 1/2 t of vanilla and 1/2 c additional oats.  There were even better!!!  So, the next time (and there will be a next time!!), I will add the vanilla and additional oats.  You gotta make these cookies!!

I have made oatmeal scotchies for years, I will use this recipe instead. The cookies were delicious and not as overpowering as I have found most oatmeal butterscotch cookies to be. They lasted two days (and only because I made them in the late afternoon).

WOW!! These are sooo good!  I used applesauce instead of vegetable oil & splenda for the sugar.  I also added a generous splash of vanilla.  Too make sure they didn't flatten out, I refrigerated the dough for about half an hour and baked them for about 12 minutes.  It all worked perfectly and they're so tasty!!!

These cookies were very tasty anf chewy. I added some toffee bits because I didnt have enough buttersctoch chips and they turned out perfect! I even made them a second time with choclate chips for a workplace party (the were all gone in a few hours) and they were better than any of the chocolate-chip oatmeal cookie recipes I've tried in the past. This recipe is a great base for a oatmeal cookie, and then you can have fun adding different and fun things to the recipe like m&m's, raisin ect. One of my new favorite cookie recipes

I have made this recipe over and over again. My husband loves these and apparently so do the guys at his work! Like others I increase the oatmeal by one cup. It is a sure hit and a refreshing break from the old standards. Thank you so much for this recipe :)

The recipe was too dry so I had to add more liquid (milk seemed to work the best) but the dough was all crumbs and they only tasted decent. I won't be attempting these again!

These cookies are great!!!  I made them just as stated, no substitutions, and they came out PERFECT!  I admit I was skeptical with the vegetable oil but the cookies look and taste like store bought...Thanks for a wonderful recipe that will be in my cookie-making rotation!!

It's true- these cookies are amazing!!  I am throwing all other oatmeal cookie recipes out of my recipe box and leaving the only one worth having- this cookie!  They are also super easy to make and foolproof.  I made some of the batch the first night and froze the rest for the next night...not sure how they would turn out.  Both batches are perfect!  You can't mess them up!

I read all the prior reviews.  I baked the cookies today.  I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla, used only 3/4 cup of brown sugar and 3/4 cup of white sugar.  I replaced margarine with butter.  Margarine is not healthy.  I split the amount of butterscotch chips between semi-sweet chocolate chips and butterscotch chips, as I'm not that fond of butterscotch chips.

The first two batches I followed directions using 1 teaspoonful of dough to bake.  Following the 10-12 minute bake time, the cookies were dry and hard.  I like my cookies soft and chewy.  I then used 1 tablespoonfuls of cookie dough.  It worked better making tablespoonfuls of cookie dough.

I've used better oatmeal cookie recipes.  These cookies were still dry.  I would not make this recipe again.

5 Star Rating from the 12 year old and the 16 year old. I used butter instead of margarine per other reviewers and 2/3 cups sugars on both the white and brown sugar. Added a splash of vanilla and some cinnamon. Up'd the oats another 1/2 cup as well. I also used one cup whole wheat flour and one cup AP Flour and no one noticed. I split the batch and added raisins to 1/2 and choc chips to the other half. Gives a healthy amount of cookies and they were a big hit! Thanks for the recipe!

A cookie with oil in it, humm, had to try it after reading the reviews. I don't use veg. oil anymore, so I used peanut oil. Don't use maragine either as everything baked burns with it in it, so I used butter. I don't use bleached flour anymore either, but found some selfrising flour that I didn't want to throw away and used it, just did not add the baking powder. Most recommended vanilla so added that in. Just did oatmeal cookies without the chips.  Anyway... These cookies are AWESOME! Best I've tasted in forever.Wow... thanks for the recipe :)

These were really good.  I like my cookies cripsy on top and soft in the middle.  I did add vanilla, and next time I think I will add another cup of oats.  Otherwise, really good.  Perhaps a tsp of molasses would be good also.

These had GREAT flavor!  I didn't expect them to be so crunchy and if I make them again, I'll probably reduce the oats by a cup.  They are very sweet, which is my preference in a cookie, but my roommate thought they were too sweet and would have preferred them without the butterscotch chips.  I definitely recommend giving this recipe a try!

Perfection with a few changes!  I added 1 tsp. of vanilla, an additional 1 c. of oats, and used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup applesauce in place of margarine and oil.  I reduced the brown and white sugar to 2/3 cup each.  I also used chocolate chips because that is what I had on hand.  These cookies are 5 stars with these adjustments.

I actually tried this recipe out because of the great reviews. I think it smelled a lot better when I was making them. The taste was not so good. I can't explain it, it wasn't sugary enough. I should have put more sugar. I took people's advice of adding 3 cups of oatmeal instead of 2 and I omitted the chips and added raisins. Maybe the raisins did it but what is an oatmeal cookie without raisins?! Eh, don't think I'll try it again.

These have a great chewy/crisp/buttery texture! Added 1 cup semi-sweet chips, and 1/2 c butterscotch chips, 1/2 cup white chips and about 3/4 cup heath bits (was trying to use up partial baggies of things leftover from Christmas baking) They are DELICIOUS!!

I have made these several times over...they are unbelievably good!  You have to just make sure you take them out at the right moment...don't over cook them.  Every time I make these they are devoured and everyone loves me :)  Make sure you have lots of milk on hand to eat them with.  Thanks for the awesome recipe.

The best oatmeal cookies! I made a double batch which made ~80 cookies, reduced the white sugar to 2/3 of a cup, and used chocolate chips instead of butterscotch and old fashion oats rather than quick cooking.

Very good cookies!  Not too sweet, which is always my beef with cookies having butterscotch chips--they are so sweet it is hard to overcome that sometimes.  A little sweet, a little salty, and a hefty cookie with the oatmeal in it.  Delicious!  The cookies spread a little, but not a huge amount so I was able to get 8 cookies on my sheet (I usually only do 6 in case they spread.)  thanks for the recipe!

These turned out very good.  They were crunchier than I was hoping.  I used milled oats, which I think are also known as old-fashioned oats.

YUM!!! this is by far the best oatmeal cookie recipe I have ever used! I changed a few minor things, I added vanilla for my own preference. Also, I didn't use butterschotch chips (sounds yummy, but I didn't have them) and aded walnuts and raisins. Everybody LOVED these cookies- and I fed them to a lot of people! This is definately a recipe I will use again and again!!

Delicious! These are wonderful, everyone loved them and we ate so much as they were coming out of the oven I decided to freeze the rest of the batter to save us from ourselves. I added chopped pecans to a batch and those were to die for!

I just made these yesterday. They are sooo yummy! I did have to make a couple of substitutions based on what I had on hand. I replaced the margarine and oil with Smart Balance Buttery Spread... I figured in the end, it was basically the same thing. And I replaced the butterscotch chips with cut up chunks of a giant Hershey's Special Dark bar. The cookies are soft and chewy and they didn't flatten out too much like some other cookies tend to do. This will be my go-to cookie recipe from now on!

YUMMM! Tastes like those butter crunch cookies from the school cafeteria, only better! I have made these a few times and they are always gone by the end of the day. I've also added chopped pecans and the kids didn't even notice.

Oatmeal cookies are my favorite and this recipe is great. Made a few little changes. Added teaspoon vanilla. Used butter instead of margarine and old fashioned oats instead of quick oats. I think oatmeal cookies and raisins are naturals, so made that switch. Perhaps because of my oven or making the cookies a little larger they needed 13-14 minutes. Came out great.

0These did not turn out well following the original recipe. They were a mess on the cookie sheet -- the dough was very wet. I added chocolate chips instead but that was my only change. The second cookie sheet full I added more oatmeal but even still, they bled together in the oven. The cookies stuck to my Silpat baking sheet (didn't know that was even possible!) and they were very crispy -- not chewy or soft. They crumbled when you ate them. They tasted okay so they weren't a total loss or anything -- just not spectacular. I will keep looking for a true five star recipe for oatmeal cookies.

Wow, these are delicious! These are my new favorite cookies. They have a great texture and once you eat one, you can't help but have another (and another...) I was planning to add a tsp of vanilla like other users recommended, but I forgot and when I remembered it was too late, so I just skipped it. They still turned out great... I also used raisins in turn for the chips. The wet mixture had me skeptical at first, but once the dry ingredients were mixed in, the dough looked much better. If you follow this recipe exact, you can't screw it up. Tip: if you notice you're recipes aren't turning out to well lately, replace you're baking soda! you're supposed to replace every 30 days. it makes your foods fresher.

A great recipe. I thought, though that it was kind of much sugar with 2 cups, so I just added ½ cup white sugar and ½ cup brown sugar and it turned out great, I think they turned out to be sweet enough anyway. Very delicious. If you leave them in the oven for a couple of extra minutes the'll be more crispy, Shorter time in the oven = more chewy, it's up to you..

good chewy cookie..but you have to only add the egg yolks if you want chewy. In the end if you need moisture just add a little water. I added an extra cup of oats, and made half with mini chocolate chips, and half with raisins and hickory nuts.  (soak your raisins in boiling water for 5 minutes)  I added wa

These were really good. I used butter instead of margerine, brown instead of white sugar, and canola instead of vegetable oil, because that is all I had on hand. I omitted the butterscotch chips as my family does not like them, and added an extra cup of oatmeal, as well as 1/2TBS. of cinnamon for some oompf!. I baked them on parchment paper, which I love( the cookies slide right off and clean up is a breeze). These cookies had a nice shape and appearance and had just the right amount of softness to them. Very nice.

I have been enjoying recipes from this website for a while now and I had to join just to say that these cookies are marvelous. You will laugh when you hear my adjustments:
I didn't have any quick oats so I used 5 packets of brown sugar and cinnamon Weight Control Instant Quaker oatmeal. I added a few pinches of clove, ginger and cinnamon. I added a capful  of vanilla. I made "kichen sink" cookies and threw it some chopped dates, a few chocolate chips and a half cup of raisins that were so old I had to let them sit in boiling water for 15 minutes.
I creamed the butter and sugar with an electric mixer and also added the flour using it. Switched to my trusty wooden spoon for the oatmeal.
I found 8 minutes to be plenty of time at 350 for smaller cookies. The recipe was JUST what I was looking for- crispy on the outside, chewy inside. When they are refrigerated they are mostly crispy, just how I like them. 
Oh, and the taste of the cookies- delightful, almost buttery. A really wonderful recipe. Thank you so much for posting it.

Very Good cookie recipe.  I LOVE the oil idea.  I love oatmeal cookies but could never get them to be chewy.  They always came out too crispy, even tho I removed them from oven while still soft in the center.

This recipe made cookies that are tender-crisp on the outside and chewy/soft inside.  And the cookie stays like that for several days!  I think it's the oil that does it.  I added vanilla, cinnamon, raisins and walnuts, omitted chips and lessened the white sugar almost 1/4 cup.  Thanks for a great oatmeal cookie recipe.

Great cookies, but not what I was expected.  These aren't really oatmeal cookies, but cookies with some oatmeal in them.  My cookies were done in 8 minutes and actually started to burn a little, so watch them carefully!

AWESOME!  I doubled the recipe so I could use the whole bag of butterscotch chips and after making 5 dozen cookies I froze the rest of the dough for later.  I am looking forward to thawing it out and baking the rest of them!

We all enjoyed this cookie in our house.
To make it more 'healthy' I did the following with great results:

1. instead of white sugar I added Splenda at the same amount requested. I used brown sugar as normal.

2. the oats were oat bra, wheat bran and flazseed mix

3. I used WW flour for half the flour requested

4. I added 1/4 cup wheat germ and increased the butter/oil a smidge to make up for the extra dry ingredience.

I have had great luck with this recipe. I make them small-almost morsel size for the kids'lunches. I also add vanilla and use whole wheat flour. Because of timing, I usally make the dough one day and bake it the next. My kids like them so much that these cookies have found their way into our weekend baking rotation.

Fantastic!!  I only had half cup of butter so needed to find a recipe I could use.  So glad I found this one!  I used the oil and 1/2 cup of butter flavor crisco shortening.  Only addition was 1 tsp vanilla.  These are a snap to make.  They come off the cookie scoop in a flash; no sticking to the scoop.  They baked up perfectly...11 minutes on the Airbake, 10 on the teflon coated.  I was afraid they would spread like wildfire so didn't overcrowd but they didn't.  They looked like a picture when I took them out and did not run together at all.  Didn't need to refrigerate dough between batches either.  Crispy oatside with soft chewy center.  A perfect cookie.  **be sure to beat sugars well with egg and oil/margarine or shortening for best result.  Should look like light lemon yellow in color.  That should ensure there is no grainy sugar texture or taste.  Would definitely recommend when one is short on butter.

I love these!  I did change to Butter instead of margarine (stay away from all transfats) along with the oil.  And choc. chips instead of butterscotch. I make 1/2 batch for just myself, but make large cookies. 
If I don't overbake them, they stay chewy til the end!! Love that!!!

Mmmm good.  I used a little less sugar and a little less oil.  I also used choc chips instead of butterscotch, but I think butterscotch or raisins or any kind of chip would be good.  My daughter is taking them to class for school tomorrow.

Everyone loved these!  Next time I think I'll use less oil (maybe about 1/4 cup instead of 1/2 cup).  I also added some shredded coconut and substituted chocolate chips for the butterscotch chips.

This is my "go to" recipe for cookies, however, I change it up a bit to make it a healthier treat. I use butter instead of margarine, coconut oil instead of veg oil, either organic whole wheat or organic white flour, only 1 cup sugar (I use coconut palm sugar)and raisins and sunflower seeds instead of butterscotch chips.  My husband loves them!

My 6 year-old DD helped me make these after school today. We both liked them a lot! Like other reviewers, I used extra oats, real butter, and vanilla. I subbed a combo of coconut oil & applesauce for the oil. Bummed I didn't have butterscotch morsels, I used 3/4 semisweet chocolate chips instead. Very good and will be made again!

My little boys love cowboy cookies. So much so that I'm tired of making my usual recipe (which uses chocolate chips, not butterscotch). I gave this recipe a try. My children did not care for it and whined about the "wrong" chips. I, on the other hand, found these to be absolutely ADDICTING! Seriously, this is now my most favorite cookie in the world. 

When making these (or the chocolate chip version), I use quick cooking or old fashioned oats interchangeably; it doesn't seem to make a difference. My other recipe calls for shortening (instead of the margarine/oil combo), but I detect no differences in flavor or texture either way. 

I prefer my cookies soft and underdone; my mother-in-law prefers them crispy. This recipe makes good cookies either way. Take them out a little early for soft ones; leave them in a bit for crispy ones. I've even slightly burned them on accident, and they still tasted wonderful. 

I frequently freeze this dough. Make the dough balls and put them on a cookie sheet (you can put them close together, since you're not baking them yet). Pop them in the freezer. When they're solid, transfer to a freezer bag. Take out and bake from frozen, as many or as few as you like. They are a bit crispier this way, but still wonderful.

Loved it! Thanks for posting Ellie! Will make again! I followed the other reviewers by adding the 1 extra cup of oats and 1 tsp of pure vanilla. I omitted the chips, replaced with rasins. I then doubled the batch. Great!

Tweaked this  a bit.  I used 1/2 the amount of sugar, used whole wheat flour, added flax seeds, used cinnamon instead of salt, and raisins instead of butterscotch chips.  Delicious and nutricious!

These are some confusing cookies. On first bite, I thought it was very very delicious. However, they're so sweet and "fat" tasting I find each additional bite less and less appealing. They remind me a lot of the cookies they sell at Subway, which I find have the same problem. Could be just me though! As recommended by others, I added 1 tsp vanilla and 3 cups oats. Baked for 8 mins.

Best oatmeal cookies I've ever made! Crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. I tripled the recipe and after rolling into balls stored some in the freezer to bake at a later time. They were perfect even right from the freezer into the oven.

Every time i've made this cookie its received rave reviews ... its the perfect balance in texture - crisp on the outside with a semi chewy middle and soft center.  You can make the cookie softer or more crisp by varying the cook time which is another thing I like about this recipe.  I use butter instead of margerine, add 1/2 tsp vanilla, double the amount of salt (kosher), and swap out butterscotch for chocolate chips.  I've tried many many cookie recipes and this has become my definite staple, go to recipe.  It's super easy and when I bring these to potlucks or meetings people really enjoy them.  These cookies are addictive and yummy!

Made these for my grand daughter's band competition.  They were yummy.  The only change I made is adding vanilla.  I did keep the dough in refrigerator while others were baking, which I do with most of my cookie dough.

Added more oats, tsp vanilla, and decreased the sugars to 3/4 C each.  Used butter instead of margarine.  Will make again!

A great recipe to use up odds and ends from the pantry.  I followed another member's suggestion using an extra 1/2 cup of oatmeal and used 1 cup of butter. I added chopped macadamia nuts and a dash of vanilla. Very tasty...soft in the middle and crispy around the edges.  I used my convection oven with baking temperature of 350 degrees.

Makes a very good cookie! Great as described, You can pretty much add anything you like to them. For example, Ive added cinnamon and apples before or peaches. My favorite is as follows: I use butter instead of margarine, use one cup of wheat and one of white flour, use cup of brown sugar and one cup of Splenda Sugar-Bllend for baking, I use white chocolate chips instead of butterscotch, increase oats to 3 cups instead of 2, add 3 tablespoons benefiber powder (to increase fiber), 3 tablespoons of flaxseed meal, add 1/2 cup of walnuts, and add 1/3-1/2 cup of dried cranberries. YUM!

Made 64 cookies instead of 36. Maybe I mixed too much and put too much air into the batter? Although decent flavor, nothing spectacular & took too long. Very airy/light when done.

These are very good cookies.  I used Heath brickle chips and added 1/4 cup of peanut butter.  I also used butter instead of margine and added a 1/2 cup of nuts.  They have a great texture.  I will makes these again.

I made these once as per the instructions, except using a half and half raisin and choc chip mixture in place of the butterscotch; they turned out good, but a little too oily and missing some flavor I couldn't quite identify.  The second time I used 1/2 cup of applesauce and 1 tblspn of oil in place of the 1/2 cup of oil, reduced the white sugar to about 1/4 cup, and used a dried berry mixture from Trader Joe's.  They turned out wonderful!  They're soft and delicious; they turned out a little cakey, which I enjoy but isn't for everyone.  A definite keeper!

I very rarely write reviews, but I couldn't pass this one up.  These cookies are awesome!  I added the tsp of vanilla as others had recommended.  I didn't have butterscotch chips on hand so I used a cup of heath bar chips instead and they came out great.  They were super easy to make.  An hour start to finish and I had 4 doz perfectly risen cookies sitting on my counter to be put away.  I will definitely be making these again and playing with what I put in them.  You will not regret making them.

Amazingly delicious!  I did substitute butter for the margarine, and added 1/3c. extra flour so they wouldn't spread too thin.  I also used only brown sugar to ensure a nice color.

The cookies turned out very very hard. The only way to eat them was to dunk them in milk. They tasted very good then. I followed the recipe as directed. Not sure if it was my fault or not.

I made these exactly as directed with no changes and they were delicious. These disappeared in a hurry! They were the perfect blend of soft middle and crispy edges. I did use butter instead of margarine, since I never buy it. I didn't add extra oats or anything else.

Delicious!  I cut the sugar to 3/4 cup and used 1/2 cup applesauce in place of the margarine.  Instead of butterscotch chips I used good old fashioned raisins and a dash of cinnamon.  I was craving hearty oatmeal raisin cookies and this hit the spot!

This is a really good cookie recipe. I omitted the butterscotch morsels and replaced them with golden raisins. They are chewy and delicious. Thank you for the recipe.

Great cookies. I substituted butter for margerine, and decreased the white sugar by half. I also used old fashioned oats and added 1 tablespoon of cinnamon! YUMMY!!!!! A new favorite!

I also took the advice of others and made some minor changes. I used 3/4 cup of white sugar, added 2 teaspoons cinnamon, 1 teaspoon nutmeg, added 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, added an extra cup of oats and used chocolate chips instead.

YUMMERS are these cookies delicious. I also froze them as the batch is quite big and I have to say that they are even better after being frozen. My fiancee took them to work today and said they were hit so he's taking some more in tomorrow :)

I have been looking for a great recipe that I could have as a base for a bunch of variations; this is it!  Added the extra cup of oats and the t. vanilla.  I didn't have chips of any kind so I added 1 c. chopped walnuts and 3T. instant coffee granules  and 3/4 t. Saigon Cinnamon.  Cannot wait until my husband tastes them.  I used heaping regular spoon-fulls and made 51 good sized cookies.  For a party I would make them littler and get more out of the batch.  WOW!  Thank you for sharing this recipe with us.

I got so many compliments on these cookies.  Everyone loved them.  I too added 1 tsp of vanilla and I used 1/2 c. raisins and 1/2 c. craisins.  This will definitely be one of my top cookie recipes.

VERY GOOD oatmeal cookie recipe. The only thing I did different was the chips. I didn't know if the family would be bit butterscotch fans, so I did 1/2 cup butterscotch chips, 1/2 cup chocolate chips. I also added a dash of vanilla extract as well, (I saw other people reviewing this cookie added it so I figures why not?). Everyone loved the cookies. I brought some to work and they got rave reviews as well. I made them a little smaller as well, and ended up with almost 5 dozen cookies. I'll definitely make them again!

Followed the basic ingredients but did not use butterscotch chips since I do not have them on hand. What I did, though, is use white chocolate chip chunks and sliced fresh strawberries. The smell from the oven is just unbelievable and the cookies are the perfect crunchy yet chewy ones. When storing, make sure you put it in an airtight container or Ziploc and add a slice of bread to keep the moisture out as it crumbles when not stored properly.  Made this three times in one week and family seems to never get tired of it.

Added more oatmeal like others suggested and vanilla too.  Used 1/2 cup peanut butter chips and 1/2 cup Chocolate chunks  also.  A big hit with my girls and husband too!  It's a keeper.

very good! I was planning on making these exactly as written, but I just couldn't bring myself to leave out vanilla! I added 1 tsp of vanilla (it really makes a difference) and I also added a cup of coconut because it was staring me in the face when I opened my pantry. (as you can probably tell, it's hard for me to stick to recipes) SO good! I'm sure the recipe's awesome as written but I think it's a great one to play aroun with, too!

Followed recipe exactly, except I didn't have butterscotch chip, so I sub'd peanut butter chips!  Very nice!  Thinner, but Soft with a slight crisp right out of the oven.  Hoping they don't get crunchy after they cool!

Didn't have butterscotch so used 1/2 cup choc. chips and 1/2 cup diced maraschino cherries - well drained.  Added 1 Tbls more flour as the cherries are really moist.  The football players were looking for more!  They all really liked the chocolate-cherry mix.

Perfect recipe! So fattening, but delicious! :) I used raisins instead of the butterscoth and they turned out perfect. Actually made about 4 dozen good sized cookes. I also used butter instead of margarine. Yummy!

Made 24 cookies. Used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour. 1/2 brown sugar and 1/4 white sugar. White choc chips. I would add more raisins and nuts next time. Maybe a little flax seed. They are good and even better next day.

Good! Excellent flavor and texture. I had no chips, but had coconut, dried cranberries and raisins. The coconut was definitely a good addition. I added 3 cups of oatmeal and the vanilla as some reviewers suggested. I guess it's clear I was trying to use up things in the frig and the cabinet. I will certainly make again-maybe even with the chips!

I followed the previous advice of adding cinnamon and vanilla.  I added 1/3 cup extra of oats, 1 cup of cocconut and 1 cup of rasins.  I also used chocolate chips instead of butterscotch.  It is a little sticky but I sprayed my hands with pam and no problem.  This is a traditional Cowboy cookie to me.  Excellent recipe!

Awesome.  I used butter with a little bit of margarine for it and the rest was the same.  This is quite possibly one of the best cookie recipes ever!!!  Easy to make, crunchy by soft and perfect.  Not too sweet either.  Do make it!  It will make lots of people smile!

Fantastic! Soft and yet crisp texture to the cookie with the butterscotch is soo yummy! I followed the recipe exactly. I would recommend chilling the dougfh just a little and then rolling them into soft balls before baking to help them from breaking later. Oops one broke, I better eat that one ;) You will enjoy this recipe!

Great recipe.  Added vanilla extract, cinnamon, and other spices.  Also chopped up prunes and added those to the recipe.  No one knew a thing.

I am not sure what I did wrong.  The cookies turned out flat and on the mushy side.  Very sweet too.  Will have to try them again because of all the great reviews.  I did not care for my batch at all.  I ended up throwing some of them away.

Baked for 12 minutes and they were chewy and perfectly cooked. I used semi sweet chocolate chips instead of the butterscotch.

Delicious! As seems to be the norm, I upped the oats to 3 c. and added 1 tsp. vanilla. Next time I will try using cinnamon chips!

A good recipe as is, but I don't like butterscotch chips, so I substituted 1 1/2 bags of Heath Bit o' Brickle chips instead. As others have done, I also used 3 cups of oats and added 1 tsp of vanilla. A keeper.

These were the best oatmeal cookies that I've ever made. I did follow other users' advice and add an extra cup of oats and 1 tsp of vanilla. I also used 1/2 cup of applesauce in place of the oil and used chocolate chips instead of butterscotch because I didn't have the butterscotch.   Usually when I attempt oatmeal cookies they spread and don't turn out at all like I want, but these were really easy and came out awesome! This is a great oatmeal cookie base that I look forward to using again and again!

Not impressed. Although the flavor was good, the consistency lacked. The first batched baked was pretty good, but those after that spread too much, even tho I popped the dough in the fridge between baking batches. I would chock that up to two things: using all butter and too much leavening. If I made this recipe again, I'd omit the baking powder and use half butter and half shortening.

This is the first time I've felt compelled to write a review.  These cookies were terrific - light and crisp on the outside, just chewy enough on the inside.  Perfect!  I wanted oatmeal raisin cookies, so I substituted raisins for the butterscotch chips.  I also added a pinch of cinnamon and, based on some of the other reviews, some vanilla.  I will be making these again and again.  I also made about a half the batch the first time then froze individual scoops of dough.  I baked them twice thereafter - once partially thawed and once straight from the freezer.  The frozen ones were not as perfectly round, but the taste and texture was just fine.

This was a pretty good recipe, the cookies came out crispy on the outside.  I added a handful or two of raisins and a whole bag of chocolate chips instead of butterscotch ones to the dough, but that was the only change I made to the recipe.  I like them softer so I let them bake for about 13 minutes.  This isn't the recipe I was looking for, but it was still a good one that I'll keep and make again.  Maybe in addition to the raisins and chocolate chips I'll add some toasted walnuts next time.

I am a cookie junkie! I really liked these. They were soft, and slightly chewy. I froze half of them and ended up retrieving them from the freezer after only one day. They are awesome frozen too!

These cookies were just ok.  They lacked the chewiness that you expect from an oatmeal cookie and the flavor itself was unimpressive.  Even with other's suggestions of the extra oatmeal and vanilla, I will not be making these again.

THE.BEST.OATMEAL.COOKIES.  I am so excited about having found this wonderful recipe!  I only added an additional 1/2 cup of oats (I used regular old fashioned, but I pulsed it once in the processor to thin them out a bit), and I omitted the butterscotch, and added chopped walnuts and milk chocolate chips.  The texture is PERFECT.  A light crisp on the outside, and a soft/chewy center.  Delightful!  I can't wait to make these again - thank you so much for sharing your recipe with us!

These are absolutely awesome!!!  I pretty much made these as the recipe stated except for three minor changes, they are as follows:  I used butter instead of margarine, added 1 teaspoon vanilla and also added 1 cup of chocolate chips in addition to the butterscotch chips, everything else the same.  They were crunchy yet soft at the same time.....It made 4 dozen exactly so I let my husband take 2 dozen to work today for a meeting.  He said it was like a shark feeding frenzy and they were gobbled up in no time flat.  He said he also got a thumbs up from the VP.  I highly recommend and will make again and again :-)

These turned out great!  I added 1 tsp vanilla and a cup of raisins.  I left out the chips only because I thought I had some but didn't.  Very tasty!  Will make again.

Yum, easy and fast. I did however make a few modifications due to lack of items. I used 1\2 c brown sugar-packed and 1/2 cup granulated brown sugar to amke the full cup of brown sugar,  I did add 1 cup of white sugar as directed too. I used bread flour in place of all purpose flour. This idea from Alton Browns chewy choc. chip cookies. I made them in small teaspoon fulls and when just lightly browned I took out of the oven and sprinkled lightly with white sugar. YUM!  I did not add the butterscotch chips, made just plain oatmeal cookies, no additions. WILL MAKE AGAIN and AGAIN!

Added the 1 tsp vanilla, used 3 cups instant oatmeal and butterscotch chips as others did... here's the kicker. I added a pinch of ground clove, ground allspice and cinnamon, 1/4 c raisins, 1/4 c coconut and 1/4 c chopped pecans. I wish I would have put chocolate chips in too! This cookie is VERY moist and tasty! Can't wait to serve them!

Good cookie!  Yummm!  

I halved the recipe since I only had one egg on hand...but other than that, followed as is.  Didn't even need vanilla!  I think that the cinnamon chips would be awesome in it as one other reviewer said.  If you are a cookie dough freak like me and my kids, you will LOVE this dough!  It is SO good!

I think I cooked the first batch just a few mins. too long as the bottom of the cookies had "hollowed out" in places...so the second batch I just watched really closely.  My oven is a bit wonky, so I can't blame the recipe.  The second batch was perfect ~ gotta love oatmeal scotchies!

I was lazy and threw the whole thing into a 13 x 9 pan, then put  a handful of choc chips I had leftover on top.  They were gone in a flash.  I have been bugged for more for a couple of weeks now.  Thanks for a new family favorite.

we loved the cookies, made some changes though. I reduced the oil part by half and replaced it with the apple sauce. Also I added about a cup of raisins, half cup of chopped walnuts, and reduced sugar by third.
it was a hit in my family and with neighborhood kids.
Thanks for posting.

I don't enjoy baking as I'm not very good at it, so on the rare occasion I do bake cookies or cakes, I follow the recipe to the letter. These cookies turned out absolutely fantastic! I baked them for exactly 10 mins, and they cooled to a perfect crispy yet chewy consistency. They are a touch too sweet for my taste (next time I'll use more brown sugar than white) but otherwise, they are better than any oatmeal cookie I've ever tasted. Thanks so much, Ellie!

I added 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp cinnamon and without that I think they would be very bland.

Perfect cookies!  I did use chocolate chips since I didn't have butterscotch on hand, butter instead of margarine, and I added 1 tsp. vanilla as recommended.  I did not refrigerate first and they turned out perfect!  Good flavor, great texture and very easy to make.  Be sure to cream the oils and sugars well.  Enjoy!

These are really great!  I've tried a few cookie recipes from the web before and this is my favourite so far.  I substituted half of the sugar with a smaller amount of Stevia, and used chocolate chips and walnuts instead of the butterscotch chips.  Also added vanilla.  When I let the cookies sit after taking them out of the oven, they got stuck to the tray, so after that I took them straight off after 10 mins each time and they worked really well.  Thanks for sharing!

Wonderful cookies that baked up perfect and did not spread too much.
They are crunchy outside yet chewy in the middle.
I added 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/3 cup walnuts and 1/8 cup raisins and used butterscotch/milkchoc. chips: Nestles. The cook time is perfect for my taste.  Try these you will enjoy!

I know I'm going against the flow here, but hubby and I didn't like these.  They were very flat and with all that sugar in it they STILL didn't taste very good.  I even added chocolate chips after the 1st batch were done and the choc chips didn't add anything.  Now my 4 and 6 year old boys ate them but they will eat just about anything.  I won't be making these again.  Sorry.

Really great fresh from the oven. I believe this is the recipe my grandma used, only she used chocolate chips and added nearly a teaspoon of cinnamon. Delicious!

These cookies were very sweet and chewy! YUMM!YUMM!YUMM!  This is how we like cookies in my house. I added a tsp of vanilla and everything else stayed the same.  Next time I'm adding nuts.  Thanks for the recipe.

I definitely baked them too long when I put them in four 10 minutes.  Too bad I didn't taste one before doing the whole batch.  They ended up way too crisp.  Good flavor though - I'd try them again.

These cookies are really good, light and fluffy.  I didn't have butterscotch chips so I substituted with 1 cup of crunchy peanut butter.  I made 38 nice sized cookies using my ice cream scooper.  My son loves them too.

I only cooked these for 8 minutes; at 10, they were really dry and crispy. They have a good flavor, but still a little on the dry side. I followed the recipe exactly and I am an avid baker, so I was suprised to find these weren't as good as these other reviews suggest. Maybe it's the oil?

Absolutley delicious.  The oil makes them chewey and soft every time.  I have neighbors who request these cookies all constantly.  I accidently made a different recipe once and they could totally tell and didn't like them at all!  These are the best oatmeal cookies I have ever tried and I follow the recipe exactly....it even makes exactly 3 dozen and only needs 10 minutes!  You will LOVE these cookies.

I made these cookies with only one change.  I used chocolate chips.  My family and I agree that this is a great recipe.  A single recipe made over 8 dozen cookies and they're going fast!
I was concerned that the batter was too dry, but the cookies spread nicely.  A real winner!

These were great, but dense- I think it's because I used real butter instead of margarine like the recipe calls for.  I think with marg. they would spread out better- I had to pat them down before baking.  I'm giving 5 stars because they are the best tasting oatmeal cookie I've tried and am sure with the marg. they'd be perfect!  A keeper!

These cookies were great, but I think there was a bit too much oil in the recipe as most of them ended up stuck to the pan. However, I mashed them all up and we had *fabulous* vanilla ice cream topping for about a week! Will definitely make them again, with less oil.

My Family thought these cookies were terrific!! Every night my husband and I do something different with our little girl and tonight we made these cookies.  I substituted chocolate chips, nuts and M&M's for the cup of butterscotch chips.  She had a woderful time adding whatever she wanted and the recipe was very forgiving.  I'm sure we added almost 2 cups of the goodies and it still turned out great.

This has turned out to be one of our favorite cookies. My picky eater son says he loves these. If you don't have nuts on hand try using cornflakes crushed and you get the nutty flavor without the expense of nuts to buy. I will make these over and over.

These were prettyb good. I never used oil in a cookie before. They turned out very moist and chewy. I added instead of butterscotch I put chocolate chips, chocolate covered raisins, and chopped nuts. Yummy

I normally don't like things made with butterscotch but these are fantastic. My husband liked them so much he asked if he could take them to work for his co-workers. "Everyone raved over them!"

These are delicious. I added a teaspoon of vanilla and about 1/2 cup extra of oats. 1/2 of the cookies I made with just the butterscotch chips and the other 1/2 I added mini semi-sweet chocolate chips as well. Both versions were great.

Oh my GOSH! Hands down the BEST oatmeal-butterscotch cookie I’ve ever had. Plus they don’t go flat and are greasy! These are fab! I did use butter instead of margarine and added a teaspoon of vanilla.

These are amazing! I added 1 more cup of oats, a splash of vanilla and some dark chocolate chips alongside the butterscotch (my hubby's favorite).  I didn't have margerine, so I used butter.  Made them big (a handful of dough per cookie) and baked them for 13 minutes. Perfect texture and taste!

The kids loved these and are begging to have them again.  I did use butter instead of margarine for our preference.  Cooking time was spot on.  They have a really great texture and flavor.  We can't wait to make these and try out different chip flavors.

Delish! And easy to make! I don’t like to make substitutions for my first time but I did. I didn’t have quick cooking oats so I used old-fashion rolled oats. I didn’t have margarine so I used butter. It still tasted fantastic!

This amazing recipe deserves my first review! The crunch and chewy factors were spot on and everyone loved it. In fact it was on par with a fancy store bought cookie mix and I will definitely make it from time to time. BTW I roughly halved the recipe to get 20 cookies. I used raisins and a few nuts, but didn't use margarine and brown sugar.  Otherwise, the ingredients were cheap and easy to find, making this a overall great recipe. Thank you.

A perfect recipe. I forgot to buy butterscotch chips.  I used milk chocolate chips.  I could have done without them.  I added 8oz package frozen coconut,  thawed. Also one cup pecans, chopped and roasted in the microwave for about 1 minute.
My husbands likes crispy cookies so I  gave them 14 minutes at 350 degrees.  The only change other than the chips will be butter instead of margarine,  a personal preference.  Thank you for the great recipe.

These turned out really well, and my family loved them. They had just enough crispness with a little chew and were not cakey.  I didn’t have any butterscotch chips but did have toffee bits & they blended in well with the oatmeal taste. (I live at high altitude, so- as with most recipes- had to make high altitude adjustments so they come out as intended: added 1-1/2 Tbsp flour and 3 Tbsp liquid, reduced baking soda/powder by half, and increased oven temp to 365).

First time making this! I used butter instead of margarine, added another 1/2c of oats, added 1tspn of vanilla, added 1/2tspn cinnamon and used 1/3 of oil instead of half. Did not use the butterscotch chips at all. I like them plain!Next time I would cut the sugar...a little bit too sweet for my liking. Baked for 10mins in my over and it's perfect! Crispy on the outside and chewy inside!!! Im happy with my first try!

Great tasting and good texture. I did not use butterscotch because I didn’t have any so I used Craisins and a 1/2 cup of coarsely chopped walnuts.

Oh my but these are good!! Followed the recipe substituting some almond flour and brown rice flour for 2/3 of the white flour. I used the full cup of brown sugar, but only 1/3c erythritol in place of the white sugar and they are plenty sweet. I will add the recommended vanilla next time... and there will be a next time!

These were delicious. I made a smaller batch and threw in a little cocoa powder and peanut butter since I didn't have any butterscotch chips. So so good, will definitely make again.

My familys' favorite. I add it cup of chopped pecans and hold back a half cup of oats. I get a softer more chewy cookie.

Really good oatmeal cookies. I added some leftover chocolate chips and peanut butter chips. I used the 3 cups of oatmeal as suggested and vanilla.

These are delicious.  I loved the butterscotch chips because they don't seem as overwhelmingly sweet as chocolate chips are in cookies.  These cookies has a wonderful soft, chewy texture.  Based on reviews, I used 3 cups of oatmeal instead of 2 and added 1 tsp vanilla.  I also added 1/2 cup each of crayons and walnuts.  Really great!  & I like that they aren't giant cookies.

Really good. Used 3 cups old fashioned oats. I didn't have vanilla. I reduced the sugar by 1/3 for both kinds but added a bunch of chocolate chips to the butterscotch. I cooked them till they browned a bit which may have been too much- about 15 min. They were crisp but I think I'd like a little more soft centers. Will make again!

These were perfect - I made them exactly as suggested and used butter instead of margarine. I also added skor bits for a really decadent treat. I will make these again for the traditional cowboy cookie with peanuts, raisins and coconut too - so many possibilities with this cookie. Its my go-to oatmeal base from now on.

I made these as a gift to give to friends.  Yummy!  Some changes to this recipe, I cut the white sugar to 3/4 cup.  I added 1 tsp of vanilla (I think it got missed in the writing of this recipe).  I also added 3/4 cup of white chocolate chips and 1/2 cup of dried cranberries.  I would usually add nuts but this time no nuts.  Oh and I used my electric mixer to mix the butter, oil, eggs, vanilla. Great recipe.  Quick to put together.

I used chocolate chips instead of butterscotch chips, and they were a HIT for the ugly sweater party last year. Everyone loved them, and there were hardly any left at the end of the night, even though the batch made like 40 cookies!

I love these cookies. The first time I used the butterscotch chips. I loved the texture of the cookies, but thought the butterscotch chips were a little too sweet. I made them again using mini Reese's Pieces, and they were awesome. Peanut butter chips are also good. These are MUCH better freshly baked, so those that we won't use within the first day or so go into the freezer. Then we can have a fresh-tasting cookie whenever we want!

I made this cookies for a party and everyone that had them were so impress. I always make chocolate chip cookies and everyone loves them but I wanted to change it up a bit and I had some oats in my kitchen. I added 1tsp of vanilla extract and 1/2 cup extra of the oats, they were super good!

I made the recipe exactly as described for one dozen EXCEPT I added almond slivers instead and mini choc chips. 

They came out fat, which is fine! I'm no fan of a flat cookie. They were very crumbly, but perhaps I didn't give them enough time to cool; they did firm up. However, even crumbly, they might be tasty over ice cream! 

After the first dozen I added vanilla and sunflower seeds and let them sit longer. I found the cooler they got, the better they tasted, but it still has an oily taste. Not a bad cookie, but not a 5 star cookie for me.

These are so crispy and delicious! I made them with butter rather than margarine and gluten free flour and didn't add the butterscotch chips. They are my favorite oatmeal cookies and am happy to have found a gluten free cookie that tastes so delicious.

Awesome! I made it as following: no white sugar, 1tsp vanilla and they turned out GREAT! Baked them for 10 minutes, nice and fluffy. Sweet enough for me, I just loved them! I added nothing to them, but I could definitely see potential for raisins, chocolate, nuts, etc. Great recipe! Will be making this again, as I froze 2/3 of the batch! They smell wonderful and are just right. This is the way an oatmeal cookie is meant to be!!

Very popular with my husband and daughters. I only use coconut oil now, and I suspect that may be why mine came out on the dry/crispy side. I also followed other reviewers recommendations and added a pinch of cinnamon. They were too sugary for my taste, but I'm not eating them- so success! Thanks for the recipe

I homeschool and my kids (10 and 11 years) just made these for our first cooking class.  My son put chocolate chips in his and my daughter used the butterscotch chips.  They all taste great!!!  But I do prefer the butterscotch over the chocolate chips.

Excellent cookie but too sweet. Easy to convert to being gluten free. Grind up oats for the flour, forget the white sugar as it doesn't need it and add a scoop of natural peanut butter for a kick. Use parchment paper when baking.

I needed a recipe that didn't use butter since I was out, these fit the bill.  I added sliced almonds and used semi sweet choc chips since that's what I had.  I also added a tsp of vanilla, and used 1 cup whole wheat flour in place of the all purpose, and 1/4 cup almond flour and 1/4 cup skim milk powder, so only 1/2 cup of all purpose in these.

As suggested by others I made it 3 cups oatmeal and added 1 tsp vanilla.  I also used semi-sweet chocolates as that's all I have.  They turn out really good.  Will bake this again.

Took the advice to add an extra cup of oats, made some small additions(I'll mention below) and voila! Oatmeal cookie heaven! I'm so tempted to make another batch asap. You know those oatmeal cookies that sort of melt in your mouth? This recipe gives you that kind of cookie. 
 
I scaled recipe back to 2 dozen instead of original 3.

Additions:  I added some water at the end of mixing, 1-2 TBSP(the extra added oats made the dough seem a bit on the dry side)

2/3 cup chocolate chips

3/4 cup shredded coconut

2 tsp vanilla

The cookies turned out great! I didn't use the butterscotch chips, but I added one teaspoon of vanilla extract. They were sweet, and soft. I'm definitely making these again :-D

For years I have tried to make cookies that were soft and chewy...the kind my hubby loves. I've tried every tip given to me, with little or no success, until NOW!  This is the very best oatmeal cookie recipe I have ever made!  I'm presently preheating the oven to make a double recipe to take with us on our annual fishing trip up north.  I plan to add chocolate chips to a couple dozen, butterscotch chips to others, nuts to some, raisins to some and some will have a little bit of everything!! Thank you for sharing your delicious recipe, Ellie!!

I have made these twice...and they were delish.  First time, I didn't have vegetable oil so I used coconut oil and it added a nice little flavor to it.  I also used butter in place of margarine.  I could see these cookies as good with any sort of add in such as white choc chips, choc chips, nuts, toffee bits, etc.

The 2nd time I made them I used gluten free flour white choc chips and coconut oil and butter again.  And they were the same great cookie.  I think next time I'm going to try adding in a bit more oats or reduce the sugar.  I'd like to play with this recipe just a bit to see if I can get them to not spread so much but still remain chewy.

I liked this recipe very much. I always read the reviews before trying out a new recipe so  I used 2 1/2 cups of oats and added about 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts.  THEY WERE OUTSTANDING!  I was very pleased with the texture and taste of these cookies. Meant to take a picture but they were gobbled up before I remembered haha! Now my go-to oatmeal cookie recipe for sure!

Great Recipe! Everyone loved this cookie! The only adjustments I made was to add a teaspoon of vanilla and 3/4 cup chopped pecans.  The batter was a bit wet as others suggested but did not affect the cookie.

So simple, easy and good. I was shocked at how easy and tasty these came out. I substituted milk chocolate chips for the butterscotch and they were soooo delish!!! I literally could not eat just one.

These were the bomb; a big hit!  I added some dried cranberries and took some vanilla icing to the tops of them right out of the oven so the icing would melt, then stuck the cooling rack in the fridge to solidify the icing.  Perfecto!

It seems that most people gave a rating of 5 stars.  While I think the cookies are good, I think they deserve 4 stars.  Meaning, I've had better.  Essentially, these are Oatmeal Scotchies.  You can find a recipe for oatmeal scotchies on the back of the bag of any butterscotch chips.  I did make a mistake and used regular oats instead of quick cooking oats, but I don't think this made much difference overall.  I chose to make them into very large cookies, only because it was late in the evening and I didn't want to be tied to the oven all night.  They are good, and you should try them.  But for me, they deserve 4 stars.

Amazing! Thank you for sharing this recipe! I have baked recipe as is and WWOW, Wonderful. Then I opted to omit the butterscotch chips and oh wow, wonderful. Then I used a combination of reviews and added a tsp. vanilla, and 3 Cups Oats instead of 2, again WOW! I've since varied again and tried adding another reviewer's variation of adding 1/2 C. firm apples. And WOW again! My last personal variation, I added 1/2 Cup Craisen's and 1/4 Cup finely chopped pecans, and oh wow! All I can say is AMAZING & WOW! Again thanks for sharing. Thanks also to all the reviewer's for all the advice & variation's. 
My incredible & loving husband of 25 yrs., who (used to be) very picky...Enjoyed every one of these variation's of this recipe. I also thank ALL Recipes.com for being the greatest source to my husbands culinary growth! Being a Southern born Rebble, he lived up to his name rebelling any "New" recipe many years back. Living here in Iowa 25 years now, He is now considered a Generic Yankee by marriage & location. When it comes to the food,..well he says...Just consider me an ALL RECIPE MAN!
My Thanks to all of you...for helping me broaden my husbands culinary horizen's!

Pretty good! I find baking cookies very difficult, and these turned out decently. I added some shredded coconut, because it was left over from some time ago.

Made it 3 times, with butter instead of margarine: 1-original recipe, 2--with 1 c extra oats, 3--with 1/2 c extra oats and cinnamon chips.
All were good, better the next day. 1 c of oats made them a little dry; 1/2 c helped them not spread so much. 
Still like the oatmeal scotchies recipe from Quaker a bit better.

Great Cookie!!!!  nice dough to work with, not too dry. We used real softened butter not margarine in our recipe. 
We added reese's pieces and m&m candies mixed together to ours and it was a huge hit with the kids (ok, and us adults) !

I made these cookies as holiday gifts for a few close family friends, and they were all raving about them! These came out so soft and chewy, and the oatmeal flavor really shines to make a perfect holiday treat. I followed the recipe exactly, although instead of butterscotch chips I used chopped pecans instead. Great flavor! I'll be making these again soon!

tattoodprincess is right, if you take the time to cream the butter, oil and sugars until very smooth, you really can't go wrong with this recipe. I used 2 1/2 cups oats, 1/2 cup pretzels and substituted 1/2 c m&ms and 1/2 c chocolate chips for the butterscotch chips. Turned out GREAT.

I loved this recipe but the changes I made were to use 2t. coarse sea salt instead of the 1/2 t. regular salt. I also added 1 cup of Kraft Carmel Balls instead of the butterscotch chips. It made for a really nice sweet salty cookie. YUM YUM

I didn't want to fiddle around with oil and margarine so I made these with 1 cup of real butter (that was half melted purely by accident in the microwave), I also added a tsp. of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of cloves and use chocolate chips instead of butterscotch since it was all I had on hand. These were amazing and did not last long!!  I'm making a second batch today!

I changed oats to 2 1/2 cups, omitted chips and add 1 tsp. vanilla with the eggs and 1 tsp. ground cinnamon with the dry ingredients.  Yummy!

Also did it with 3 c. oats, 1 tsp vanilla and original recipe.  Yum.  May decrease some of the sugar next time since the butterscotch chips make it extra sweet.

Great cookies! I did tweak the recipe as others have with the addition of vanilla and some spices(cinnamon,ginger,nutmeg,allspice) Did not increase the oatmeal.   Baked for 10 minutes-perfect

As someone who has a horrible baking addition and makes cookies almost every day (my husbands coworker love me) I have to say this is by far my favorite cookie recipe. I just love the butterscotch and oatmeal and they are nice and soft and chewy with a little crisp on the edges. Also as someone who pretty much alters every recipe I encounter, this is the only one I have yet to change in any way.

These cookies are too flat. Don´t think that´s my fault. Though they taste very good. They are really chewy, but don´t store them too much. Otherwise they´ll become crumbly.

Delicious!  Loved these!  Just right on the crunch/chewy factor.  They don't freeze well after baked, however (they tasted fine but ended up really soft).

Too much oil.  Cookies were too greasy.  I am not a super baker.  I admit that.  And I don't understand the chemistry involved in creating the perfect cookie.  I know that baking soda, baking powder, butter, eggs, oven temps, and even cookie sheet material all have a part in making a crunchy, but chewy, yummy cookie ... but doggone it.  This was not the right recipe for me. I followed the recipe exactly.  I set the timer for 8 minutes and stood there like a hawk to avoid anything dark brown.  I was looking for golden cookies.  But my cookies turned out very flat, too crispy (hard), and way too greasy underneath.  I had to wash and dry my cookie sheets after each batch, and even then, I could see the next round of cookie dough sliding slowly on the sheet in the oven. I have never used oil before in cookies.  And I never will again.  On a more positive note:  My hubby and kids enjoyed them!  Butterscotch and oatmeal are an awesome combo ... regardless of my sad chemistry work!  :)

These were more crunchy than I was expecting and a bit too sweet. But I generally liked the overall flavor, I'll try some variations next time around.

Awesome.  Soaked the raisins in hot water - added a dash of cinnamon and will add walnuts next time as well and possibly more raisins.

This recipe caught my attention because of the margarine & oil combo. Someone mentioned a nice spread.  I baked them they did not spread for me, but I solved it, I put the smash to them! All in all the recipe is good, this is an excellent base. This will be a go to recipe. Thanks for sharing the good stuff!

Pretty darn awesome! I made these about 10 times on maternity leave (it didn't help the weight loss)! Just a thought - try white chocolate chips instead of butterscotch. My sister and I both like it better with the white chocolate.

Super-delicious!  A little soft, a little crispy on the edges. I added cinnamon, and used cranberries + raisins instead of chips. Also some ground flaxseed.

These are great. I only had 3/4 cup of brown sugar and added 3/4 cup white sugar to cut down on total sugar. Instead of butterscotch chips I added a mixture of raisins and craisins and 1/2 tsp cinnamon and a pinch of cloves.. Outstanding texture, slightly crisp, delicious.

Totally great cookie recipe! Consider using flavored instant oatmeal for the regular quick cooking oats. I used the brown sugar and maple flavored and it was the bomb!

Quite yummy. I used 1 & 1/2 cups of brown sugar rather than one of brown and one of white because that's what I had on hand. They worked out really well at 10 minutes on the dot at 350. I also used 1 cup butter instead of margarine and oil because, again, that's what I had. And a bit less salt because I added salted butter.

I had never seen a cookie that called for oil so I was going into this hoping to find a nice, chewy cookie with some good flavor. I added walnuts as well as a bit of unsweetened coconut flakes. I put them on stoneware pans and made them a lot smaller than i usually will, about 1" balls. Then I took them out at 8 minutes rather than the suggested 10-12. I left them cool for 5 minutes on the pan before moving them to the wire rack to cool. The taste was perfect and the warm cokie texture was what you would hope for. But the real test was this morning, would they still be soft after sitting and cooling all night? I left them covered, btw. So it's 8am but I just had to know so I snuck a cookie with my coffee. Sure enough! Nice and soft and chewy like I've been trying to accomplish for so many years. I'm keeping this recipe and modifications in my arsenal for good! Thanks so much.

I followed the recipe almost exactly, only inserting some vanilla and they turned out wonderful!!  I had to tell myself to stop eating the dough because it was so good.  Then I took the cookies over to my friend's house to go with our dinner.  She has three kids.  Her oldest daughter picked up one and took a bite.  Then her eyes got big and she told me that it tasted like a yankee candle smells.  Between the four of us we nearly polished off the cookies I brought that night :)

Delicious! I reduced the white sugar just slightly, increased the oats to about 2 1/2 cups, and used just over a cup of mini chocolate chips and mini M+Ms.  They turned out great and everyone loved them.  I will definitely be making them again!

My father in law loved them. I didn't have too much confidence that these would turn out well. But, they were great, and that's coming from someone who doesn't really care for butterscotch or oatmeal!

Excellant cookie.  I made them with craisins & white chocolate chips. Easy to make and chilling them a bit before baking helps them to keep their shape. I used a regular ice cream scoop sized disher because we like larger cookies. I got 25 cookies. YUMMY! Thanks for sharing.

These cookies were amazing! Since I didn't have any normal vegetable oil in the house at the time, I used olive oil. That made it smell weird at first, but I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract, and it turned out great. Also, it's fine to use butter instead of margarine. Lastly, use parchment paper when baking, or else the cookies stick really hard to the pan. Be sure to try this recipe!

OH my Goodness what a great recipe.  I added cinnamon and used it to top a can of pie apples that I had opened the night before.  I made a cobbler.  My husband can't stop eating it!

I made these cookies exactly as written (except I used butter/canola oil). They were awesome! I'm not sure how long they will last in my house. My mother stopped by and LOVED the added butterscotch. Kids and husband raved about them, too. Next time, I might cut back on white sugar by just a bit.

Delicious!  we added the vanilla (always have to have some vanilla) as others suggested, but instead of the extra cup of oatmeal, we added a cup of crushed chex cereal - really added a nice light crunch!

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for.  So soft and yummy!  I followed the suggestions of a few other reviewers and upped the amount of oats to 3 cups and added 1 tsp. of vanilla.  You basically want the cookie dough to roll easily in your hands without sticking.  If it isn't firm enough or is too sticky, it's going to spread out too much and your cookies will look like pancakes.  Once the dough was the right consistency, I just made 1 1/4 balls and set them 2 inches apart on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet.  I baked for 11 minutes, and they came out perfect.  I can't wait to try this with chocolate chips.

excellent recipe! Once the cookies cooled, I mixed a glaze of 1 cup powdered sugar and 1 tablespoon of milk and drizzled it over the cookies VERY lightly for a fun hosting treat.

I wish I could give these cookies at least 8 stars! They are absolutely deicious! Look great, chewy, yet melting in your mouth. I am writing this as my second batch is in the oven. Next time I will try to use Splenda instead of sugar, so that my Mom could try them. 10/29/10 I did put 3 cups of oatmeal-turned out even better. Added some pecans and I was in Heaven!

These cookies were awesome!  I followed other reviewers and added an extra cup of oats to the dough.  I also used chocolate chips instead of butterscotch (that's all I had on hand), and refrigerated it for easier handling.  I found that when mine baked, they were little puffy mounds...sooo I flattened them all out a bit with a spatula, and problem fixed! They looked perfect and tasted delicious :~)

First of all, I halved the recipe and still came out with more than 18 cookies! I halved the white sugar, increased the flour & oats slightly (to avoid spreading), added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp vanilla extract and skipped the chips. This was a very flavorful way of making oatmeal spice cookies. I think next time I may add raisins. They didn't spread too much and were crispy around the outside and chewy in the middle!

These are the best cookies I have ever had or made in my life.  Hands down. especially because you can add just about anything to the mix and make fantastic creations.  We've done milk chocolate, dark chocolate, butterscotch, cinnamon chips and no chips at all.  We've done butterscotch mixed with each of those others seperatley.  We've omited the chips and mixed in apples apples and raisins.  I've sent the dry mix out as gifts in mason jars too.  After making it about 50 times, I learned to just keep a couple batches in the freezer.These cookies are THAT good.

These were the perfect texture!  I was intrigued to try the 1/2 margarine 1/2 oil combination and I was pleasantly surprised!  I did add the 1 tsp of vanilla as suggested by others but I only used 2 cups of quick cooking oats (that's all I had) - but I'm glad I didn't try 3 cups b/c I think the cookies would have turned out crumbly/dry.  I also used chocolate chips instead of butterscotch and as well made a few without any chips and they were just as good - they might be a good cookie for ice cream sandwiches.  Thanks for the recipe, this could be my new and only chocolate chip cookie recipe!

My mother used to make these when I was growing up, & I modified this recipe per my diabetes & what I remember from my mama.  I changed the flour to 1 c. all purpose 1 c. whole wheat, used whole oats, and changed the white sugar to 1/2 c. sugar & 1/2 c. splenda.  I also use real butter as I'm from the South, and that's just how we do it. I also use semi-sweet chocolate chips as that's how my mama did it. Beautiful recipe!

Very nice.  Just like cowboy cookies should be.  The only change I made was substituting chocolate chips for butterscotch, since that's the way I prefer them.

AMAZING cookies! I used chocolate chips and added 1/2 cup extra oats as suggested.  I made a huge batch for my parents' moving day, even the movers raved about them. Made them again for a two week road trip--they held up well while travelling, also froze well beforehand. Thanks for such a great recipe!

GREAT cookies!  I was leary of making them because I live at an elevation of about 4900 feet, so I was concerned that they would be runny.  They turned out perfect and weren't the least bit runny.  I used butter flavored Crisco in place of the butter (I needed the butter for another recipe) and added about 2 tsp vanilla.  I will definately be making these cookies again!

These are very good, great light consistency, nicely chewy without being too chewy, they don't flatten out, and hold a nice shape.  I double the recipe and they turned out perfect.

This is the second time in one week that I am making these cookies - and I doubled the recipe the first time!  They are delicious - chewy and crunchy at the same time.  I was able to make them dairy and soy free by omitting the chips and using a half margarine half shortening sub for the butter.  If you roll the cookies into balls before baking, they turn out perfect - wonderful to look at before you devour them!

I really liked these cookies. I substituted 1 C white sugar + 1 1/2 T molasses for the brown sugar, since you can't find that where I live. I also added ca. 1 1/3 C reeses pieces + chopped bitter sweet chocolate instead of the butterscotch chips.

Great cookie, but really need an extra cup of oats.  I really like them with raisins or chocolate chips.  Don't overbake them they are good a little soft.

Awesome cookies.  I was looking for an oatmeal cookie only because I have a bunch of oatmeal that needs to be used. I was never a huge fan of oatmeal cookies.  I AM NOW!  Great recipe.  Like others I used a teaspoon of vanilla and added an extra cup of oats, although next time I will not add a extra full cup.  Half a cup extra is enough.

Excellent recipe. I read the reviews and added additional oatmeal and vanilla.  I added my own touch by adding caramel chips instead of butterscotch and also added cinnamon and a touch of nutmeg.  Very yummy.  My daughter loved them, too.

They are absolutely delicious! I changed the recipe just a little, I used 1/2 of white sugar, a cup of raisins instead of the butterscotch chips, and added 1 tsp of vanilla.  My husband loves desserts and this ranks up there with the yummiest cookies we've had! Thanks for a great recipe.

Lately I've been having trouble with my oatmeal cookies being too flat and crumbly...not with this recipe!  These turned out nice and soft and didnt get flat.  They tasted yummy too!  I added some extra oatmeal and vanilla as others suggested and used raisins instead of chips because I didn't have the chips.  I will make again for sure.

We liked these cookies.  I used half whole wheat flour and half white flour.  They were pretty salty, but I think it is because I left out the chips.

I just made these today.  This recipe is very similar to my mother's recipe, but I liked that it has more oats so I tried it.  The only thing I did different was omit the butterscotch chips and up the oats to 3 cups.  I used a small stainless steel scoop to form the cookies (approx 2 tsp measurement) and had a yield of 7 dozen.  They are delicious!  I put the majority of them in the freezer in a ziplock bag so I can take out a couple as I need for my kids lunches.  Will make these again.

I've only eaten two, so far, but I'm pretty happy with the results.  I've been on a health kick lately but I love cookies so I figured making my own oatmeal version would be a good idea.    Based on comments, and my own tastes, I decided to forgo white sugar altogether and added cinnamon honey (half cup, in it's gelled state) instead, 1/2 tsp of vanilla, an extra half cup of oats, and three handfuls of slivered almonds.  I also left out the butterscotch chips and put a handful of milk chocolate chips into the last third of the dough that was left.    My oven bakes a little unevenly so they were done in under 10 minutes, a little browner than I think they were meant to be (but maybe because the honey bakes faster than sugar too) but they still taste awesome!

Increased oats to 3 cups and added some vanilla. Omitted butterscotch chips since I did not have those on hand. The texture was great! I preferred the plain cookies to the ones we added chocolate chips to. This is the perfect plain oatmeal cookie recipe!

By recommendations, added extra cup of oats and vanilla. Frankly, I preferred nibbling on the dough to eating the baked cookie! Texture was wonderful, but the flavor was not as rich as I like in a cookie, and was too white-sugar-y (hard to describe!). Not bad, but I will look elsewhere for a cookie.

I have tried 4 other recipes for oatmeal butterscotch cookies this is the only one that worked. I did refridgerate the dough first and then rolled it into balls before baking. They came out like cookies not like homemade paper!

This recipe is good but not the best. I guess it is really a personal choice of how you like your cookies. If you like thin and crispy cookies then they would be good for you. But I personally think if they were more fluffy on the in side and crispy on the outside they would be absolutely awesome.

This recipe is very good. I followed directions exactly and came out great. It makes a lot of dough; so much so that I froze half for the next week. It was also very inexpensive. Great cookie if you're looking for a little variety.

I think these cookies are great although I also altered the recipe a little.  I added 1 tsp vanilla and the extra cup of oats.  I also added 1/2 tsp cinnamon with raisons instead of butterscotch chips.  After tasting them I would definitely make with the chips next time, it would taste great.  Unfortunately I was making them for my nephew who likes oatmeal raison.

these were super tasty!!! i added vanilla and one more cup of oats since i didnt have the chips. i think it was able to compensate for the sweetness and added a bit more chew. fantastic recipe. letting them brown is great; still really chewy and a bit crispy.

These were a huge hit at a family gathering- a nice big sturdy cookie. I think they would be even more fabulous with choclolate chips but well, that goes without saying, right?

This is my favorite oatmeal cookie recipe.  It bakes up beautifully, and you can make it with raisins nuts and cinnamon too.  Chocolate chips are very good as well.  I like to make slice and bake cookies with it so I have some whenever grandchildren come over.  My husband and I like 'em a lot too.  I use an insulated cookie sheet to bake them on, and they cook through without burning on the bottom.  I am so glad to have found this recipe.

This was a favorite growning up.  I have continued the tradition of making these for my kids.  I do modify it to meet the recipe my Grandma use to make by adding 1 tsp. of vanilla extract, using 1 1/2 cups old fashion oats instead of 2 cups quick oats everyone seems to prefer the Nestle Mini Morsels.  We do not like the butterscotch chips and regular size chocolate chips seems to be too over powering.  I bake them precisely 10 minutes and let them set on the pan.  They are always chewy delicious cookies. Everyone I have given this recipe to has asked me what I do differently because thiers did not turn out like mine.

I usually can't make an oatmeal cookie without screwing it up. In fact, after my last attempt, I vowed to give up trying my hand on oatmeal cookies. These though, these turned out perfect! I waited till the morning after to review to see if they're still chewy, and they are! I seperated the dough in half and used raisins for one half for my boyfriend and used the butterscotch chips for the rest of us. Perfect! These are a keeper.

I followed recipe exactly and added 1 teaspoon of vanilla after reading other reviews, these were so good! I gave some to the neighbors so I would not eat them all! I will definately make these again, maybe with chocolate chips or raisins.

The best oatmeal cookie I've ever made! I used real butter (only because I was out of margerine) and used chocolate chips instead. Love it! I've never really loved an oatmeal cookie before this recipe! I'm planning on taking other reviewers ideas for the future!

My family LOVES these cookies!  They are so easy to make that my 3yr old and 2yr old boys help me make them all the time.  The only problem is that they're so delicious, I think we can eat them all in one evening.  Many times I will make just one cookie sheet of them and freeze the rest of the dough for the next night.

OMG! This is truly a fantastic recipe.  I have just taken my first batch out and eaten one whilst warm and I have never tasted any thing like this home baked.  I did change mine to white cho chips as in Australia the butterscotch chips are not common and added 1tps of vanilla essence and one of cinnamon.  only had 60ml of oil so made it up with the butter which I changed from marg.  Definately a biscuit to serve when having guests.  Thank you thank you thank you!

These cookies are amazing!  Don't skip the butterscotch chips because that's the ingredient that makes these so good.  I used three cups of quick oats instead of two.  You could probably use 2 or 2 1/2 cups if you were running low.  I recommend eating these warm with a glass of milk.  I can't wait to mail these to my boyfriend.

Wonderful recipe!  I made a double batch and was very impressed.  They turned out perfectly chewy, and not too soft. I also liked that it didn't use too much of the expensive butter. Oil is much cheaper here.

These have to be the best oatmeal cookies I have ever tasted! I did add 1 tsp of vanilla and about 1/4 tsp of cinnamon, and left out the butterscotch chips. They are great. The texture is perfect!

Very yummy! I was looking for an oatmeal raisin w nuts cookie and used this as a base. Exactly what I was looking for. I added the extra oatmeal as suggested and also the 1 t of vanilla. YUM! I added about 2 cups of raisins and about 1 1/2 cups walnuts. Will definitely use this again, next time hopefully I'll remember to add some cinnamon.

These cookies are very good, but a little on the sweet side...if you have a major sweet tooth...these are definitely your cookie.

Excellent! I used butter instead of margarine but found the cookies a bit greasy. Next time (because I will definitely make them again) I will cut the amount of butter or oil to make them a bit less greasy.  As well, they're super sugary so I would also suggest cutting down the white sugar a bit if you want something less sugary.

My husband just told me these cookies are GREAT!  And i have to agree.  i followed some of the reviews and used 3 cups of oatmeal and 1 tsp. of vanilla.  I also used chocolate chips instead of butterscotch.  Simply delicious.  Thanks for the recipe.

Exactly what i was looking for- a wonderful, chewy, moist oatmeal cookie! I added 1 more cup of oats and 1 tsp cinnamon. I was fresh out of vanilla,but i'll definitely add it next time. I also baked until just golden(about 11 minutes) for maximum soft chewiness. Truly a great recipe. Just PERFECT with some additions.Thanks so much!

These are absolutely fantastic!  I can hardly wait until my kids get home from school so they can try them.  The only changes I made were to add a tsp. of vanilla as suggested by several reviewers.  I also added about 1/2 cup more oatmeal.  I used cinnamon chips instead of the butterscotch chips, but I am looking forward to trying the butterscotch the next time I make these.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Best consistency....equally soft, chewy and yet crisp on the outside. I only missed a little spiciness, would add cinnamon or allspice next time. Didn't have the butterscotch chips, but recipe would work well with them and any of the usual additives too...cranraisins, raisins,chopped nuts, chocolate chips etc.

I agree...one of the best oatmeal cookies I have ever ate!  I took some of the advice and added 1tsp of vanilla.  I also only added 1/2 cup extra of oatmeal as I was concerned that 1 cup would be too much as others had suggested...they were great with what I did but you could go up to 1 cup.  I also didn't have any butterscotch chips so I used some semi-sweet chocolate ones and it was awesome!

This will be our new standard oatmeal cookie!!!

The basic recipe was good for me, I just don't care for butterscotch so I substituted chocolate chips. Some said their cookies were soft but mine were nice and crunchy which is how I like them.

A great oatmeal cookie recipe!!!  I baked two batches today and they are even better than I expected.  I did as some of the other reviewers suggested and added 1 teaspoon of vanilla... and increased the oats from 2 cups to 3 cups.  They were so good.  Since we aren't butterscotch fans, I substituted 1 cup of dried cherries  and added 1 cup of chopped pecans in the second batch. The cherries were a bit tart and they played off the sweetness of the cookie perfectly.  If you are looking for a fantastic oatmeal cookie recipe... look no more... you've just found it!!

These were very good cookies- good flavor, nice texture, look nice on a plate, very dunkable! I think the next time though, I will add some peanut butter to the batter. But that is just my own preference.

I followed this recipe exactly and the cookies turned out great!  They have a great oatmeal taste that is perfectly complemented by the butterscotch chips.  Some of the cookies did get a little crunchy after a day but the ones I froze were fantastic when heated in the microwave for a minute. They are best served warm and soft.

These are very yummy!  However, they are not a very traditional oatmeal cookie in the sense that they should have more oatmeal in them.  Next time, as others suggested, I would add more oatmeal.  The changes I made were to add raisins and white chocolate chips instead of the butterscotch simply because I didn't have any on hand.  I also used real butter.  The other thing I noticed was that the ones I baked on a metal sheet pan were flat and crispy on the edges and took 11 min to bake and the ones I did on a stoneware pan, retained more of their mounded look and took 9 minutes to bake.  I will probably make them again but with adjustments.

Just finish a batch of these fab cookies with a few minor adjustments:  I added one more cup quick oats, 1 teaspoon vanilla, 1 quarter cup unsweetened coconut, and substituted the butterscotch chips with 1 cup dried cranberries.....FABULOUS CHEWY GOODNESS!

Don't change a thingg the first time you make this. After your first batch, you can start making changes. The cookies are fantastic!!! In the future I will try chocolate chips and cranberries instead of butterscotch chips. The dough is unbeatable, I'm sure it's b/c of the oil. Mmmmm....

These are so yummy!  Like others, I made a few changes...  butter instead of margerine, added 1 tsp vanilla extract, 3 cups of oatmeal (I didn't use the quick cook oats and they turned out fine) and I added dried cranberries (halved) instead of butterscotch.  Can't get enough of them!

Like everyone else I made some minor changes - butter instead of margarine, no chips, added vanilla.  These were very good.  Next time I will cut back on the amount of white sugar, I reduced it to about 3/4 cup but I still think it was too much.  I am looking forward to trying them with different ingredients, thanks for the recipe!

excellent cookies- the best i've had!! I didn't have enough margarine so i did half and half of margarine and shortening. I also only used 1/4 cup oil. I added vanilla. I did half batch with chhocolate chips and the other with Raisins( no butterscotch chips)...delicious...they will not last the day!!

Absolutely the best oatmeal cookie I have ever had! Cooks perfectly, no overbrowned bottoms.  Nice and crisp on the outside and soft on the inside!!  Amazing flavor.  Great plain, with butterscotch chips, and whatever else you can think of to throw in!!

Really great! Exactly what I was looking for. I only had butter (no margarine) so I baked them about 10 minutes. They are nice and soft. I also added about 1/2 C raisins. Nuts would also be great. Thanks!

I made these last night and they were fantastic! Even better after they have cooled completely, and they even warm up well in the microwave, or toaster oven. 
I added the 1 tsp of Vanilla Extract and the additional cup of oatmeal like reviewers suggested.
The recipe makes A LOT of cookies. I used a 1 tsp scoop so the cookies were small, but even if you were making bigger cookies, this recipe make plenty :) I finished scooping the rest of the batch and froze it. I hope they work out when I want to have them again :)
Next time I will cut down on the sugar by 1/2 cup and see if I like that just as much.

I've been making this recipe for years and have always followed the advice of adding 1 c. of oatmeal and 1 tsp of vanilla.  I've loved them with one wish...that they would not be quite so flat.  Recently I learned that baking soda needs something acidic to react with to be a good leavener.   I know brown sugar has acid, but I experimented by adding about 1 tbsp of sour cream.  Oh My!  This worked beautifully!  It enhanced the taste a tad and the cookies are so beautiful.

Very good recipe.  I did use 3 cups of oats and some vanilla as some people have suggested.  The cookies came out chewy and very tasty.  I actually used some chocolate chips with this recipe by the way.  I would definitely make them again.

Very good!  My family really enjoyed these.  I also added 1 tsp of vanilla.  I skipped the butterscotch chips and added 1 C of raisins instead.  This is definitely a keeper.

Delicious!  I made minor changes such as adding half splenda and half sugar as well as adding regular oats because i didnt have quick cooking.  I also used Enova oil instead of vegetable oil.I also only had regular chocolate chips on hand, so i used those instead of butterscotch.  But they turned out great!! Definitely will make again!

These were excellant.  I used exactly the way the recipe said and they turned out nice and moist.  I baked for 8 minutes at 350.  I didn't need any extra oatmeal as some other reviewers had mentioned.  I think it would of been too much. Thanks Ellie for such a delicious recipe!!

These cookies were so very good. I did like a lot others and added an extra cup of oatmeal to the mix. I also added 1 tsp of almond flavoring, 1/4 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon and dried cranberries. Oh my!!! Soft and chewy!! My DH and his buddy raved on and on about the cookies. My coworkers loved them too. These are definetly a keeper.

I must need my head examined since I made these today in the blistering heat.  But, these caught my eye when I was reviewing the contents of my recipe box and I just had to make them.  I'm very glad I did; these are great, and as previous reviewers have said... there's a slight crisp to the outside and a yummy chewy center. Maybe the butterscotch chips made for an extra sweet cookie, but I think I'll try reducing the amounts of sugar next time as well as the amount of oil.  The dough was slightly greasy, although it had no effect on the final outcome.  I used 1 1/2 c brown sugar and 1/2 c white sugar.  Oh, and I also added french vanilla extract.  Thank you for posting!

What a great cookie!  I doubled the recipe and had eight dozen!  I froze two dozen for later, but after giving the kids each a dozen the two I had for my hubby and I got eaten quickly!  I guess I will be baking off the remaining two dozen soon.  As suggested by others, I added the vanilla (1 tsp. for regulat batch).  I added 1C raisins, but I think next time I will omit the raisins and add some chopped nuts, as well as more oatmeal.  Thanks so much for this recipe.

Great recipe!  used butter, safflower oil, white sugar (cos I was out of brown), choc chips (didn't have butterscotch) and added 1 tsp of cinnamon.  These were delish.  I look forward to using the brown sugar, butterscotch and adding about a half cup more oatmeal next time.  thanks for this yummy recipe!

OMGoodness! sooooooo yummy and goey, yumm I did some changes though, 1-1/3 cup sugar, 1 tsp. vanilla, 3 cups oats (no chips), 3/4 cup unsalted butter. It was sooo awesome, also, don't go over 10 minutes, when u scrape them up they'll be falling apart but when they cool off they'll be very chewy. Next time I'll add macadamia nuts and dust powder sugar on top....thank you!

These turned out fine. I took my vanilla out of the pantry to add it, but I don't think I did. lol. So maybe next time I'll remember, and they'll be as incredible as everyone says! But they were delicious even without the vanilla, so if you don't have it, don't worry!

This is a great recipe!  I followed others advice and added 1 tsp. of vanilla as well as an extra cup of oats.  The cookies turned out perfect.  I love how they are a bit crunchy on the on the edges and chewy in the middle.  My husband really liked these as well, so I this recipe is a definite keeper!!

I loved this recipe!  The combo of the margarine and the oil made a chewy cookie on the inside and a crisp cookie on the outside!  I used 1/2 c of pecans and also added 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  
I am definately going to use this recipe again....they were beautiful too!

These cookies are incredible. I used chocolate chips instead of butterscotch chips. Also added 1 tsp. of rum extract. Everyone asked if the cookies had coconut in them. They were so good!

mmmmm, these turned out great! made as written except added one tsp. vanilla. made about 5 1/2 dozen cookies, so i'm trying the frozen method as someone has mentioned - freezing them on a cookie sheet and putting in a freezer bag. when it comes time to cook, just cook a little longer.

These cookies were very good and very easy to make.  I added about 3/4 c. chopped pecans, 1 tsp. vanilla, and probably an extra 1/2 to 1 c. butterscotch chips.  The cookies were delicious, but a little too sweet for me.  Next time I will make it with chocolate chips, instead, and not add any extra.  Overall, a great cookie!

This recipe was really good! I like the texture of the cookies, crispy outside and chewy centers. 
I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp of vanilla, which I really liked. I would also cut down on the sugar and the oil and add 1/2 cup of oats. 
It also helped to refrigerate the dough before baking because the oil causes it to be runny.

Great recipe.  However,I used 1 1/2 cups of oatmeal instead of 2 cups and I used light margarine and it turned out wonderful!  I also added 1 tsp of vanilla.  Very soft and chewy!! My 19 month old son even loves them!

These are very good- the oil makes the texture thin and crisp, but chewy in the middle.  I used butter and canola oil.  I also used a mix of butterscotch, white, and semi-sweet chips.  I've never made Cowboy Cookies before.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was really just not good!  With the first batch, when the dough started to brown, the butterscoth bits were burned.  With the second batch, the bits were fine but the dough was undercooked.  Will not make this again.

Great recipe! I didn't have butterscotch chips so I used 1 cup of raisins instead and added 1 tsp of vanilla extract. My 6yr old DS said that he loved them but they needed more raisins so I may add another 1/2 cup next time.

Very good recipe! Cookies were nice and chewy. I added about a teaspoon of cinnamon and they turned out great. Enjoy!

Excellent cookie! I followed the recipe except for adding 1 tsp. vanilla and I only had old fashioned oats, but they worked fine. Thanks!

Very, very good. My grandma used to make the best oatmeal cookies, and I looked up the recipe so I could make it at home. The cookies are soft and chewy, and have the perfect flavor for an oatmeal cookie. Definetly make this.

Excellent!  Very soft and chewy and rose to just the right height and consistency.  I used chocolate chips instead of the butterscotch, which my kids don't care for.  These were gone in one day!!!  Thanks!!!

These have the perfect cookie texture. I made them exactly as written and then again substituting chocolate chips. I liked the ones with chocolate better, a little less sweet. Thanks for the awesome recipe.

mmm, these turned out very nice!  they were a little greasy for my liking, but they taste great and are both crispy and chewy.  I might add a little extra flour next time, and experiment with nuts/chocolate-butterscotch chip combos.  thanks!

I just made these cookies and they turned out great!!  I made a couple changes.  I added about a tsp of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg to the flour mixture, and I substituted raisins for the butterscotch chips.  With my husband and two boys, I know they won't last long.  Thanks!

Fantastic cookies!  I made some changes and they still turned out great -- I substituted butter for margarine and used white spelt flour (my roommate is allergic to wheat).  I also used raw sugar instead of white, and in place of brown sugar I used a second cup of raw sugar and two tablespoons of molasses.  I haven't tried the original, but I would recommend these modifications for a more organic cookie.

These were a tad too sweet for my taste and I prefer chocolate chips to butterscotch, but the oatmeal part was very moist so I would make again and sub choc chips or some cinnamon and raisins.

These cookies are great!!  My family loved them, and they don't usually like oatmeal.  I also added a couple of handfuls of chocolate chips along with the butterscotch chips, but otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  My kids have asked me to bake these all the time! Thanks!

I've used shortening, butter, and/or margarine in cookies, but never oil. Maybe that's why these turned out to be DELICIOUS!

Our family LOVES this recipe.  We take these cookies to church potluck and always leave with an empty plate.  If these cookies are too sweet for you, why not reduce the sugar or make some veggie crisps?

These cookies are fabulous! The butterscotch chips really add a nice flavor. Only thing I would do is add more oats and a little less white sugar, they are very sweet.

Very good cookie recipe!  I have been searching for a long time for an oatmeal cookie recipe that tastes like these cookies -- other recipes are too cakey or too dry.  These taste like they come from a bakery.  I can't wait to try the recipe with chocolate chips or raisins.  Thanks!

I followed all the directions and didn't add anything extra and they turned out great.  Not doughy, mine came out thin but not like a wafer.  Simple too.  This is a good recipe to do with your kids as one review mentioned.

Awesome cookies!  A huge hit at the office party.  I made 2 batches - 1 with chocolate covered rasins & 1 with butterscotch chips - everyone loved them.
