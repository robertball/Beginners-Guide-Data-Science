Great recipe. I love serving apple dumplings with cook and serve vanilla pudding poured over them too (warm, of course). You can also add a few spices to the pudding (nutmeg, etc).

My whole family went crazy over this recipe. We usually have to visit a nearby Apple Ranch for their Apple Dumplings which are $5 a piece. Now I can make my own any time I want. I just made them today and already my husband wants to know when I am making them again!
