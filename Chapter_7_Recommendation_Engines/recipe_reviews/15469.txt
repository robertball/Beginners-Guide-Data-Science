I've been looking for a good chocolate cookie base recipe and finally found it with this! I substituted the peanut butter chips for coarsley chopped Andes Mints candies (I've been looking for an excuse to use them) and they were to die for! Followed the rest of the recipe just about exactly (other than cutting back on the sugar just slightly). I baked them for 9 minutes, then finished with my "perfect cookie trick" by removing them from the oven, then dropping the pan from about 8" in the air onto the hard countertop (Seriously! Try this!), and letting them continue-cook on the hot cookie sheet for another 2 minutes before removing them to a wire rack to cool. They were crispy on the outside, moist, chewy and decadent on the inside and all-around cookie perfection! The best part of this cookie recipe is that all of the cookies turn out exactly the same size, shape and texture. These freeze beautifully in a ziplock bag to extend the "life" of that fresh-baked cookie taste, and my whole family just loved them. Just a note: Don't ruin this great cookie by using stick margarine in place of the butter (that stick margarine stuff is so hydrogenated, it's one molecule away from a plastic! lol) - much, much better with the real thing. Can't wait to try other "chips" with this recipe in the future. Thanks for the great find!

Scrumptious. I added 1/2 cup peanut butter and cut down on the butter a bit, but otherwise made it the same. Thanks.

This is a soft, buttery, rich chocolate cookie that I found changes dramatically depending on how it goes into the oven.  Soft, chewy, crispy, will all depend on how flat and how big the cookie dough balls are going in.  I did the first batch straight from the scoop and they turned out thick and soft.  A lot of people prefer their cookies this way so I can't downgrade them for that.  The second batch I used the same amount of dough but flattened them slightly (as I always do and should have stuck with here too!) - a little chewier, not quite as thick, and much better, at least for my tastes.  Peanut butter and chocolate fans who love soft cookies will love this one.

Here's the thing--I made this recipe with my youngest boy and we lost a little flour in the process of measuring it and getting it to the mixer bowl, we lost a little egg during the egg-cracking process, and I'm not really sure if my son snuck in more sugar while I was getting my camera. With this said, even though I was sketchy about how this recipe might turn out with the little mistakes that were made, this recipe turned out a very nice cookie. Soft and fluffy and very nicely chocolate-y. (The raw batter was in-sane......but don't tell my kids that. Ha.) The best part is they did NOT stick to the pan AND I didn't need to chill the dough, which for me were excellent parts of this recipe. Next time, I'd like to try this with half of the butter replaced with peanut butter. I bet that would be really good. GREAT rainy day recipe to make with my son and bond. We had a BLAST and he was so proud of himself. NOTE: 350 for just about ten minutes was just right for us.

Awesome cookies.  My first recipe for chocolate cookies that didn't go flat and crispy.

So good!  I like this recipe a lot better than the Hershey's/Reese's recipe on this site.  I baked them at about 7.5 minutes so they are soft and chewy.  I used half whole-wheat pastry flour and Sunspire pb chips (no trans-fats).  Also used 1/2 cup brown sugar and the rest white (next time I would probably reduce the sugar by about 1/4 cup).  I got more than 2 dozen too, using my pampered chef scoop.  These cookies taste great and look beautiful too!

I looved these. Infortunately, it was not unanimous, but I still think they deserve 5 stars. I followed the recipe exactly, and the dough is quite thick and stiff. For those who like thin chewy cookies that are not too dense, this is not the cookies for you. These cookies are really heavy, thick and dense, and that is what I like about them! They do not spread much. You can feel both the flavors of the peanut and the chocolate. People all have different tastes, so I did not rate it according to whether everyone loved it or not, just rated according to whether it is a good cookie that comes out the way it says it will...and it does! Loved it, kids and brothers loved it too! thanks!!

I used to use the recipe on the back of the peanut butter chip bag to make these. They always taste great, but every time they would fall flat!!! These cookies don't. They taste great, and look great too!

My son loves these type of cookies.  He still liked them and they turned out looking very nice, but I prefer a sweeter cookie.  After I had already made these noticed that the peanut butter chips had a similar recipe on the back with more sugar in it.  If you are making cookies, would not cut down on sugar.  Seems like whoever created this recipe wanted to make a less sweet cookie.  If that's what you enjoy, this is a perfect recipe.  I prefer a sweet cookie, that is why I eat cookies.

This cookie is delicious with or without the peanut butter chips. I used margarine instead of butter and they came out perfect. I will definitely make these again.

These are amazing. I had to leave them in the oven for an extra minute or two and then let them cool for a while before tranferring them to the rack. I didn't do that with my first batch and they basically remained as dough. Still tasty, though!

These cookies are awesome! Way too good to have in my house all the time! So much better than the Reeses recipe on the bag. I will definately make these again cause they were gone the very same day I made them. Very addictive, now you have been warned! Thanks for sharing!

Wow! These were so good! I switched the butter for margarine and had no peanut butter chips so I used semi-sweet chocolate chips and white chocolate chips instead. They were absolutely great! My family devoured them super fast! Thanks so much!

Amazing! Used a combination of dark cocoa and the traditional kind. We also used 1/2 peanut butter chips and 1/2 milk chocolate chips (due to what we had on hand). We also had farm eggs so they were very small. Decided to use 3 to make up the difference. Perfect!!! Thank you.

Excellent cookies! Soft but not falling apart. My husband--who is "not a sweets person" cannot stop eating these! The dough freezes well too--I made them into balls, froze them on a cookie sheet then transferred them to a ziplock bag. I cook them straight from the freezer--just for a few extra minutes.

Totally yummy! I'm thinking in our process to make these cookies, my daughter didn't add quite enough peanut butter chips. There was more cookie and little amount of chips to the batch...can't blame the recipe...really think it was my kiddo. Other then that, we loved the cookies. Made them to donate to the Veteran's Center for Cookies Across America. And they went over nicely.

This recipe is absolutely amazing!  They taste sooo good!  I took some to a bridal shower, and they were a big hit.  I added a bit more vanilla, but that is just because I always add extra vanilla to everything.  I recommend this to everyone. It is like a browie with peanut butter..only in the shape of a cookie! Awesome!

These cookies are easy and delicious! I made them exactly as the recipe said to and I love them! My only tip is that I prefer to hand mix my cookies and the batter for these is very thick! So I suggest either an electric mixer or a good warm up before the workout! Other than that, they are wonderful!

I just made these. They are the best cookies I ever made. Couldn't have done better myself. One problem, it had to cook longer. I don't know if it's my oven or what. Probably just my oven. I'm glad I chose this recipe!

AWESOME! I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 light brown sugar (I do this with all the cookies I make). I only used 1/3 cup cocoa (b/c it was all I had left), and I added 2 cups of milk chocolate chips. These were by far the best peanut butter chip/choc chip chocolate cookies I've had!

Wonderful chocolate cookie! Next time I think I will add roasted peanuts with the chips for some crunch. I am also planning on subbing out the peanut butter chips for dried cherries and walnuts in the future. Really nice chocolate base that you can play around with.

These are excellent cookies. I used 1/2 butter, 1/2 shortening and subbed 1/2 cup of the sugar with brown sugar. I set aside about 1/2 cup of the pb chips to press into the top of the cookies right out of the oven. Soft and fudgy, and you can't beat the chocolate-peanut butter combo.

I make an average of about 100 dozen cookies a year for charity, and this recipe is going to become a staple for me. They are absolutely delicious!

These were ok. Kinda dry and crumbly. I used margarine instead of butter and followed one reviewer's suggestion to use 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar.

Unbelievably good!  I followed the recipe exactly except I think I made my cookies a little big.  They were so good though!  Very soft, sweet with a little salty.  Oh my goodness..I made them last Wednesday and I'm making them again tonight.  LOVE them!  Tonight I'm going to try chocolate chips, cut down the butter and add some peanut butter.  We'll see how that goes, but I have a feeling they will be awesome!  This cookie recipe is perfect.

These took 20 minutes to bake up in the oven.  And then, they still weren't moist and chewy like cookies are supposed to be! And I had leftover batter that was dry and didn't form into balls.  I do not recommend this recipe.

I'm not a big fan of chocolate based cookies and these changed my taste buds for sure.  I didn't have a full 2 cups of peanut butter chips so added some chocolate chunks to the mix.  Wonderful!! The hubby was not disappointed.

Amazing!  Thank you for sharing!  They came out perfect and were eaten (too) quickly! Everyone at work and at home raved about these.  Made them as is.  Next time going to make a batch with peanut butter chips, a batch with chocolate chips and a batch with Andes mints.  I did try the trick where I dropped the pan onto the counter top as mentioned by the reviewer on the front page.  Greatest cookie trick EVER!  I will never make a cookie without doing this again.  Must say that it was worth the price of the Ghirardelli cocoa powder if you can find it.

Great cookies! Mine did not flatten much at all. I decided to make the second batch bigger sized and served with ice cream ( like some popular restaurant do) and they made a perfect dessert! Awesome recipe, a definite keeper!! Thanks for sharing!

I made these with my 3 yr old tonight...they're fabulous!  I agree with a past reviewer that these are like 2 bite brownies with pb chips in them.  I used the Reese's chips, and I have to say it took away from the cookie, buy a non Reese's pb chip./  Their chip has too much of a distinguished flavor.  The cookies were very moist but slightly crispy on the outside at 11 minutes.  I agree that 8-10 minutes is not long enough, but I was working with a gas oven.  Different ovens result in different cookies.  Overall a fabulous cookie I will make again.  Definitely necessitates a TALL glass of milk.

This is a wonderful, addictive, chewy cookie recipe. The only thing I did different, because I do this to all of my cookie recipes, is change the sugar.  I used 1 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  Next time, I will probably do 3/4 cup of white sugar and 3/4 cup of brown sugar.   
 
Following another reviewer's suggestion, I dropped the pan of cookies from about 8 inches above the counter after they were done. I'm not sure what it did for them, but they turned out great so I'll do it again. :)   
 
This is a definite keeper!

I am so mad I can only give this five stars. When I say it is the best cookie I have had the pleasure of eating and making, this is an under statement. All of the previous cookie recipes I've made off of this site have been a disaster (puffy, cake like, and dry inside by following their recipe). This cookie turned out soft, moist, and chewy. The only thing I did to this which brought it over the top was add 1 1/2 cups of peanut butter and 1 1/2 cups of semi-sweet chocolate chip morsels. Believe me when I say that this recipe will be part of the many recipes I pass down to my children.
My first batch yielded about 18-20 cookies and with a family of 5 they were gone within an hour.

Just to add more glowing feedback ~ I made these cookies exactly according to the recipe, and they are divine!  I love the combination of rich chocolate and peanut butter, and they were very easy to make.  On an occasion when I made 3 or 4 different kinds of cookies, these stood out easily as the best.

OH MY GOSH!! YUM!! My family loved this recipe ~ I used white chocolate chips in half of the dough, and then chocolate chips in the other half ~ they both were great. (I didn't have peanut butter chips) I used a pampered chef stoneware  to bake the cookies on and had to add a few minutes for baking time.  These are my new favorite cookies :) I think pecans or macadamia nuts would be wonderful too in this cookie.

I am usually hit or miss with the consistancy of cookies but these came out PERFECT!  Great taste and texture.  I baked them on a silicone baking sheet for about 9 minutes or so. Easy recipe and great results.

Excellant cookies! So much better then the recipe off the Reese's PB chip package. These cookies keep their shape and don't flatten out vs. the recipe from the package. Definately would make it again!!!

The best cookies ever! Taking some other suggestions I made a few changed. I turned the 1 c. butter into 1/4 c. unsweetened applesauce, 1/4 c. natural pb, 1/2 c. room temp butter. Also used 1/2 c. brown sugar, 3/4 c. white sugar and special dark chocolate powder. That cuts down the sweetness so the little peanut butter nuggets really stand out. Also, used mini-pb cups instead of chips. MMMMMMMMMMMM this is the best recipe I've ever found on the internet and right up there in general (sorry can't beat Gram's gingerbread cookies).

This is a 5-star cookie for sure!!  I followed the recipe exactly as written except I used Reese's Pieces mini baking chips because that's what I had on hand - sooo good - these would be great for halloween cookies this way because of the colors!  The chocolate flavor of this cookie, and the texture, are PERFECT!  So many possibilties with this recipe as far as add-ins... looking forward to making this with the andes candies that another reviewer mentioned!  Also, I baked some trays where I left the cookies in mounds and baked some where I pressed them down a bit.  It didn't make too much difference, but if you prefer flatter cookies, then definitely press them down a little bit.  Either way, they taste great!!!  Also, I used a medium-sized cookie scoop and got exactly 3 dozen cookies from this recipe.  IF there happen to be any cookies that don't get eaten up while they're still fresh (and yes, I know this is a big if!), crumble up what's left and freeze them... then mix into your favorite ice cream for a treat, it's delicious!!  No good cookie should go to waste :-)  UPDATE:  I followed some of the reviewers' advice the 2nd time I made these and used 3/4 cup granulated sugar and 3/4 cup brown sugar - the cookies had an even better texture!  To get a smooth look, I rolled them into balls first and then slightly flattened them before baking.  I also used Andes mints for the second batch... a perfect mint/chocolate combination!  Love this recipe.

Followed the recipe exactly.  I Used Penzies Dutch Process High Fat Cocoa but even so I still was not too impressed with this cookie. I found them very hard, not crispy just hard.  I would much prefer something a little more chewy.

Yummy and VERY rich.  I replaced some of the butter with peanut butter and used unsalted butter.  These were good with butterscotch chips or pb chips.  They get crumbly the next day.

These are very yummy, soft, rich cookies. Super chocolate-y and brownie-like. My BF said they were the best cookies he's ever had. Made them for a very large graduation party and they were loved by many young men (my nephews friends) and the adults alike. I find them quite sweet though, but that is normal for me. These do not flatten or spread for me, so I push down a bit on the cookie ball, and do not refrigerate the dough. White chips also work well in these for a change. Lastly, I get way more cookies out of these, weighing them to about an ounce- and they are a great size.

Wonderful cookies! Made a few modifications - used milk chocolate and peanut butter chips (mixed) and I added 1/3 cup of peanut butter.  Added a little something.  Turned out AMAZING!

These are great cookies! The bag of peanut butter chips I bought was just about 1-2/3 cups, so I cut down the recipe slightly and it still made 4 dozen nice-sized cookies. I'm guessing the recipe as written could make nearly 5 dozen. I made these with my 11-year-old son that is learning to cook and he thought they were amazing. Thank you!

Loved this recipe!  Only change was to sub in 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  Baked for 9 minutes and let sit on the pan for a couple minutes before moving to a rack.  These were still soft the next day. Will definitely make them again!

used 3/4c butter instead of 1c, and 1/2c brown sugar + 3/4c white sugar (1 1/4c sugar total).  these were super yummy and rich, and could even use less butter and sugar.

These are really tasty.  I dropped by the Tablespoon full and it took about 15-17 mins to cook.  Made 27ish large cookies.  I didn't change a thing.

I could not imagine a better chocolate/pb cookie recipe. I am usually a very harsh cookie critic, and I thought that these were great. The texture was soft on the inside and a little bit crunchy on the outside. The taste was perfect. The only change I made was I added 1/3 of a bag of mini semisweet chocolate chips-- this made them even more chocolatey.  You won't regret making these.

Such a wonderful base recipe for cookies!  I'm a recent college graduate and don't have a lot of wiggle room in the budget to buy extras (like brown sugar) when I already have similar products (like granulated sugar).  I really liked that this recipe gave me the option of using ingredients I already keep on hand.  I substituted cocoa powder for about 6oz of baker's chocolate - worked wonderfully.  My cookies needed about 12-15 minutes to cook, but that might be my ancient oven.

Yum! I was happy with these - wonderfully chewy and perfectly moist! I made them relatively small, which I probably wouldn't do again with the amount of chips in the recipe... I wanted to enjoy a bit more chocolately cookie goodness! But, to me, this still deserves 5 stars.

This was very easy to make, and the results were delicious.  When I teaspooned the cookies on to the baking sheet they didn't come out looking too nice.  I made balls from the dough for the next batch, and they looked and tasted great.

AWESOME RECIPE!!! I LOVE IT! The only change I made was, I used 1/2 cup of Shorting and 1/2 cup of butter. I like the flavor and crispyness that the Crisco leaves. Other than that the recipe is PERFECT!

The best!!  I've made these according to the reese's peanut butter chip recipe and they are good, but usually turn crispy.  Follow this recipe exactly and make sure you use real butter.  they are soft and you will definitely want to keep eating them!  MMMM!!!

This was such a great cookie. I actually had to cook it for 13 mins to get it fully cooked, but not over done. It was nice and chewy, and I loved the destinct chocolate flavor against the peanut butter chips. Very very good.

i did not change a thing... and they are indeed very dense and rich.  ADDICTING.  I agree with saying that they are like little brownie bites with peanut butter chips.  YUM

DH actually said to give these "6" stars...LOL!  Just got done making these and he absolutely loves them needless to say.  Thanks for an excellent recipe.  Followed the recipe except for making them a little larger and baked a couple more minutes longer.  Awesome!!

I followed the recipe exactly, and used Reeses peanut butter chips, which were a huge mistake!  The chocolate base of the cookie was tasty, but the Reeses chips were so salty compared with the cookie base that it was a bit odd.  I don't remember normal peanut butter chips being so salty.  I'll try again with some other sort of chip.

This is one of the best cookie recipes that I have come across.  I followed the recipe exactly and drizzeled a peanut butter glaze over the cooled cookies.  They are soft and full of rich peanut butter flavor.  Everyone at Thanksgiving dinner loved them.

These cookies were a delight!! Didn't have peanut butter chips, so substituted orange and black peanut butter M&M's (for Halloween) and WOW!!  They were delicious and even better the day after baking... soft, moist, flavorful.  My 7 yr old son and hubby are huge fans.  The consistency of a brownie packed with peanut butter chips.  Thank you Michelle!  It's a keeper.

I made a double batch of these. since that would call for 3 cups of white sugar I substituted 1 cup of brown sugar. The cheapskate pb chip company only puts 1 & 2/3 cup of pb chips in the bag so I just used 2 bags. I think my cookie scoop is on the small side but I like it that way :) I cooked them for anywhere between 7-9 min and let them rest on the hot pan for 2 min. I ended up with 130 yummy chewy slightly crisp bottom cookies! So, so, so good!!! UPDATE: made these without any Pb chips and they are just as awesome that way too! Def my go to chocolate cookie!!

Based on the reviews, I had high hopes for these cookies, but unfortunately, no one in the family loved them.  I think with some tweaking, they could be wonderful.  I would cut back on the cocoa a tad and cut the chips by a third of a cup.

These cookies are delicious. I followed the recipe exactly, except for adding an extra splash of vanilla. The first batch I scooped the dough and baked for 10 minutes. The cookies stayed about scoop size and were thick and soft. The rest of the dough I rolled in balls, flattened, and baked for 12 min. I also "dropped" the cookie sheet straight out of the oven. The cookies were large and chewy. They were wonderful both ways. Everyone loved them, and they were easy to make.

Perfect as is! I doubled the recipe and added an extra 1/2 cup of mini-PB chips that I had in the cupboard. Made them about half the size and baked at 325F Convection for 8 mins. These will not last long.

This was exactly what I was craving! I had gone to the store and purchased peanut butter chips dreaming of this type of cookie, all warm and wonderful straight out of the oven. You can tell winter has arrived, let the baking begin! I searched the different recipes and saw the submitter's comment that they are impossible to screw up which was good because while baking them, I was helping three members of my family with different school/ work projects, so screw up factor would be high! As I blended and sifted, I was shocked to realize I only had 1 1/4 cups of flour! Ugh! I said to myself, " We'll find out if they are impossible to screw up." After digging around in my cupboards, I ended up using about 1/4 cup of coconut chia granola cereal and a half a cup of Cocoa Pebbles ( gotta love Fred). Anyway, thank you thank you, thank you for submitting this recipe! Believe it or not these cookies turned out beautifully and were so delicious, it was unreal! I do cook and bake a lot and can be pretty picky about what I consider good, but if these cookies can handle my healthy cereal and the kids cereal and still turn out this phenomenal, that is saying something! The cereal actually gave them a little extra wonderfullness! Thanks again for the great recipe!

Absolutely wonderful! I opted to use 1 cup PB chips and 1 cup dark chocolate chips.  Really rich and decadent! Only advice was to let rest on sheet a few before transferring to cooling rack.  Mine baked 10 min for perfect results. I used parchment paper, which I always recommend.

Amazing cookie! I substituted coconut oil for half the butter, otherwise stuck to the recipe as written. I baked on ungreased, parchment lined cookie sheets. Heavenly!

These cookies are great! I made them for Christmas cookies and for my boyfriends birthday. If you don't flatten them with the spatula, they look like a real thick man cookie (which was great for my man) and are super tasty. I didn't have to change anything in the recipe, and it was an easy and quick one too.

Awesome recipe! This was my first time making Chocolate Cookies and I am so glad I chose this recipe. Cookies hold their shape well, and are not too too sweet. My 3 year old son loves them, and so do I! YUM!

These cookies are the bomb and so versatile!  I have made this recipe using peanut butter chips, butterscotch chips, mint chocolate chips, and Andes baking pieces, and they have been a hit every time.  These also freeze very well unbaked so you can pull out and bake as many or as little as you want.

Gooey and so richly delicious!  Substituted half of the peanut butter chips with semi-sweet chips, as other reviewers suggested.  Great suggestion; I'll continue to do so in future.  Cooked for 10 minutes, middle rack, and followed the drop-from-8-inch suggestion and let sit on pan for 2 minutes.  A bit unusual, but turned out great, so I'll keep it up, quirky as it is!  (Recipe made just short of three-dozen medium-large cookies.)

These came out so perfect. I mixed in chocolate chips with peanut butter chips just to play with the chocolatey cookie. Don't skimp on the sugar - the cocoa powder will take over!

These are great - really soft and chewy, almost like a brownie bite. I used 1/2 c peanut butter & 1/2 c smart balance instead of butter, and then added white chocolate chips. Yummy!

Wonderful recipe, thanks!!  I was skeptical, but they turned out great on the first try, even with half of the butter substituted with Earth Balance.  Baked for 9 minutes, they come out tender and slightly chewy on the edges.  The peanut butter chips are a pleasant surprise with such a chocolatey cookie.  Yum.

Amazing!  A perfect chocolate cookie recipe. Peanut butter chips are only the beginning for this versatil recipe.  Try it with mint chips for a 'better than' version of everyone's favorite Girl Scout cookie or toffee chips and macadamia nuts for a sophisticated, adult treat, or with dark chocolate chunks for a 911 chocolate emergency.

Followed the recipe and a tip from another reviewer who gave her "perfect cookie" tip...bake 9 minutes pull from oven and drop the cookie sheet from about 8 inches in the air onto the hard countertop then let the cookies cook on the hot cookie sheet for 2 minutes then transfer cookies to cooling rack. Perfect consistency...crispy on the outside and moist chewy and decadent on the inside.  The recipe is perfect. The COOKIE is perfect.

I wasn't crazy about these cookies.  They were easy enough and they came out just as they should, I think, but I didn't think they were chocolate-y enough or sweet enough.  I'd probably add chocolate chips in addition to the peanutbutter chips if I ever make them again.

Yum!  I substituted 1/2 c sugar for peanut butter - ended up with a combination of grocery store brand and an unsweetened natural brand.  I ended up slightly reducing the amount of pb chips, since there seemed to be a risk of getting more chips than batter.  They came out amazingly fudgey, puffed up, and delicious! I took them out while they seemed uncooked, but after a couple of minutes they were firm yet still wonderfully moist.

Love these! My husband can't get enough of them either. You WILL be tempted to eat the whole batch at once. I've done these twice. The first time I used butterscotch chips instead of peanut butter and that's yummy as well if you aren't a peanut butter fan.

These cookies are amazing. The batter was really thick, and I ended up having to bake these for a lot longer than the suggestion. That might have been because I made my cookies a little big. Oh well! These were amazing!

My son suggested both peanut butter and chocolate chip cookies, so I made these with both.  I made a double batch because the recipe said it makes 2 dozen, well that was a miscalculation!  I ended up with 8 dozen!  Thankfully it was for a 4th of July party and they were spectacular!  They stayed soft and didn't lose their flavor over the 3 days it took to eat them up.

Absolutely delicious! I also added 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips for some extra chocolate. My husband loved them as well. I think I ate half the cookie dough before I even baked them.

Delicious! Definitely good with a glass of milk! I used 3/4 c. white sugar and 3/4 c. brown sugar.

These are SO GOOD. I use them to bribe my baby brother to help do yard work so I don't have to :). They're his favorite cookie! Thank you!

I added about two tablespoons of peanut butter because I wanted the cookie to be really peanut buttery, but I think they would taste good without as well. I also used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of white. Very yummy cookies!

These cookies are fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out delicious. Note - if you use a heaping teaspoonful for your measurement (as the recipe suggests), it makes about 5 dozen small cookies (not 2 dozen).

I had to make a lot of changes.  The first time around i followed the recipe exact and they came out like dry little balls.  The 2nd time around I changed it up a bit.  I used less regular sugar and added brown sugar.  I used 1 stick plus 2 tbls of butter with 1/2 cup shortening.  Used 1 cup less of flour and added 1.25 cups of instant rolled oats.  Only used 1/3 cup of cocoa.  And cut down the baking soda by 1/4 tsp and added 1/4 of baking powder. Basically a complete overhaul.  The 2nd batch came out fantastic.  The cookies spread and were chewy and moist.

I halved the recipe servings as we're just 2 and I don't need cookies for a month!  Everyone seems to have issues with the softness and how flat the cookies become but I halve my recipe, follow it to a T and I end up with lil' plump and chewy cookies so I'm not sure where they're going wrong! :(  I spoon my cookies out with a tbsp(rounded) and leave them as a ball to cook, they flatten out but they still remain tiny and plump.  Excellent cookies though!  I made a batch and had friends over, by the time everyone was gone there was only 3 left for me and hubby!

I could eat the batch!  I will enjoy using this recipe for a basic chocolate cookie, only to build from there.  Lots of depth.  I love this amount of cocoa!  Thank you, Michelle!

These are very good.  I followed the recipe exactly as written, although I only made 1/2 a batch since I didn't have enough butter for more. I used a cookie scoop and got over 24 from half a batch!  I would make these again, and wouldn't change a thing!

Awesome cookies...So chocolaty and perfect texture. The only thing I did different was I substituted 1/2 cup brown sugar for 1/2 cup of the white sugar. And baked them for 8 min. Thank you for sharing these!!!

Used 1/2 margarine, 1/2 Crisco...used 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 white sugar...probably added an extra cup or so of Reese'e chips (I like my chips!).  Turned out well...first batch out of the oven was slightly underdone, so I ended up cooking the rest of them for ~12 min at 350 (they are for a bake sale, and I didn't want to risk them being underdone!).  I got 5 1/2 to 6 dozen cookies out of this batch, though!  They would have to be giant to only get 2 dozen!

These are probably the best cookies I've ever made! Mine turned out nice and chewy. I made as written other than cutting the recipe the in half. I got exactly 18 cookies using my cookie scoop.

These are so perfect! They taste just like Reese's peanut butter cups! My husband is deployed and requested chocolate cookies w/pb chips, and this is the recipe I found. I followed the recipe almost exactly but also took another reviewer's suggestion and added some creamy pb, just a spoonful. The pb chips come in a 1 3/4 cup bag, so I just used one bag. The spoonful of pb made up for it! Used the kitchenaid stand mixer, can't imagine stirring this batter by hand. Overall, delicious and will be making them again!

OMG I'm making them as I write this... All I can say is WOW! I've tried the recipe from the back of the pack, I've tried my grandma's recipe and they always ran flat.... Not this one! Oh and try it with white chocolate chips.... SO GOOD! Thanks for such a great recipe!

Great Cookie!  Agree w/others, back of the hershey bag recipe just isn't as good as this.  Those cookies tend to be much more delicate-hard to get them to set.  Go from undercooked to burnt so easy, BUT these are super.  Can't say enough-try them!!!

Excellent cookie and far from the traditional. In order to ensure the cookie was chewy and not crunchy, I replaced half of the white sugar with brown sugar.

I will be making these again!  They are a nice change from your typical chocolate chip. I made them exactly as stated in the recipe, which yielded 3 dozen exactly.  The texture was perfect--not too hard or soft (I find the cookies made with the recipe on the back of Reese's PB Chips come out too soft and they fall apart)  My husband and children loved these and they were gone within 48 hours (alright, I had a few too!) :) Thanks for the recipe!

Good Lord I'm ! I didn't properly read the yield on a single run of this recipe. I saw "12 servings" and figured a dozen cookies (1st time cookie maker from scratch). I tripled the recipe, killed my $4 Walmart mixer, and my arm after the mixer broke but...TOTALLY WORTH IT!!! I brought 30 cookies to work for a unit of 10 people, they vanished quickly (the cookies, not the people), and that's with two people out sick. So 30 cookies were wiped out between 7 people really because I had my fill after baking.  BTW...a triple recipe has yielded 6 dozen cookies so far and I've got plenty of dough for probably 4 more dozen in the fridge.  AWESOME RECIPE THANK YOU!!!

I would have given this 5 stars but I didn't think that the appearance was there. Maybe I used to much dough or not a big enough scoop. But with that said, these were AWESOME!! I followed everything to a T and these were just to good. As with some other reviews these were a cross between a brownie/cake/cookie, but whatever they are a cross between I made these 2 days ago and now they are gone. I WILL be adding these to my rotation!

I followed the recipe and these cookies turned out amazing!! Though not as soft as one might suspect. That's ok for me though because I enjoy crisper cookies. 
This will definetly be made again!

I love this recipe! I've made it several times and it's always delicious. The dough is thick and SO good too. I always use Hersheys Special Dark cocoa - I think it gives the best chocolate flavor. It's good with white chocolate chips too!

My favorite cookie ever!
Used Dutch Process cocoa, which I thought wouldn't be strong enough but it was awsome!
They were like the best parts of a chewy cookie and brownies put together. 
My cooking time was longer, I just learned to wait untill the tops weren't shiny anymore and the centers were set, then I pulled them, they finish cooking out of the oven so they don't get overdone. 
Thanks for the new family favorite!
(finally, a cookie that can keep up with my husbands!)

The recipe is great, it does have a tendancy to lean to the dry side, we are chewy cookie people. Try adding 1/4 cup more butter, and with the sugar I used 1 cup white and one cup brown. It helps also to roll and wrap in waxed paper and slice and bake........handy for any time!

I got 4 dozen small cookies from one recipe dropping "heaping teaspoonfuls" of dough.  Lots of compliments!

These cookies are wonderful! I think they are the best cookies we have ever had. They are slightly crisp on the outside and gooey on the inside. No tweaking is necessary. This recipe is perfect!!!

Pretty good. I followed the recipe exactly and would make one recommendation - more peanut butter chips!! I like getting lots in each bite and the bag I used only had 1 2/3, so I would add more.

not sure what went wrong, but I followed the recipe exactly, however these come out WAY to dry for my liking.  I really gave it a good try, I baked 3 batches, the 1st for 10 min, the 2nd for 9 min, and the 3rd for 8, hopeing it will not be as dry.  with the 8 min batch comes out looking under cooked, but still tasted dry!  my kids usually can't stop eating fresh baked cookies, but they didn't even want 2nd.  I had to forced them to do the taste test for me....

I was honestly kind of disappointed. I was expecting them to turn out a LOT better because of the reviews. The first batch, I cooked for 10 minutes at the suggested temp, and they were SOOO gooey and uncooked in the center. I ended up having to cook them at 20 minutes at 300 instead. They turned out ok, but that's just it... I've had much better home-made cookies. These seem to be a bit crumbly and so-so.

These turned out perfect.  I made no substitutions.  Deliciously moist, soft and kept their shape.  The dough will seem really thick at first, but it will turn out beautifully.

Definitely the best cookies I've made! I made the recipe as is, except I had to bake them for 12 minutes, and even then they were still soft and chewy. The chocolate part by itself is OK, but with the peanut butter chips the combination is phenomenal! I couldn't stop eating them! Will definitely be making these again.

I made a great big batch of these last night for some friends and they LOVED them! They turned out perfectly. Absoultely declicious cookies! The only bit I changed was using M&Ms instead of peanut butter chips, since I have a hard time finding those around here in WA. I'll definitely make these again. Thanks for the great recipe!

For some reason, these cookies came out a bit dry for me. Not sure if it was the type of butter I used, but that was the only thing that could have possibly ruined the recipe for me. I still got compliments on the cookies, but they were too dry for me. The taste was great, and it seems like a good recipe, but the cookies were definitely too dry after the first day.

A great recipe with a fantastic flavor.  Most of the recipes that I have found for chocolate cookies have been too sweet, with the chocolate look but not enough to taste.   These are perfect, and earned me rave reviews at work.  I am making another batch today... 3 days later.

I did not have white sugar (yeah I know! how could I) so I used brown sugar and because I only had cocoa sweetened I used that and cut the sugar a little. They were great!

Oh my goodness!  These were absolutely the best cookies I have ever tasted!  I usually eat 3-4 cookies out of a batch, but I ate 6 out of this one and probably would've eaten more if there had been any left.  I followed the recipe EXACTLY and they turned out wonderfully!  Thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you!

I recently started baking and these were one of the first things I tried. Although many of my friends loved them, I thought they were just ok. I may try playing with this recipe when I make them again. But, def. a crowd pleaser.

These are the best cookies I have EVER made!  The consistency was perfect.  I did adjust a couple of things.  I added an extra 1/2 cup of flour and reduced the peanut butter chips to only 1 cup.  I cooked my cookies for 12 minutes and they were perfect in my oven.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  It is my new absolute favourite and my family's too!

These are my daughter's favorite to bake and to eat.  I don't like crispy cookies, so these are perfectly moist and chewy.  We keep them stored in a baggie and if they are around... they will stay soft for about a week.

This recipe turned out AWESOME!  I doubled the recipe and put in 3 cups of peanut butter chips and 1 cup of chocolate chips.  This was a LOT of chips.  If you are going to double the recipe, I recommend putting only 3 cups total.  It turned out wonderful though, even still.  Very sweet and yummy.  I used parchment paper and cooked for 8 minutes and they just slid right off.  Cooled for about 5 minutes on the wire rack and they were set perfectly.

These are wonderful! The first time I made them, I pulled them out a couple minutes early. They were not very good under cooked like most cookies. Follow the directions exactly and they're to die for!

This are awesome.  I followed the instructions exactly as written.  They came out of the oven (9 minutes) and all the kids in the neighborhood playing in the snow were waiting by the door for cookies.  And, they all wanted seconds!

Cut the sugar and baked some on a silicon sheet and some on wax paper on a cookie sheet. The cooking times varied but you just need to keep an eye on them. They all came out pretty solid but not hard, moist but not too chewy. A very good overall cookie texture in my opinion. I would recommend not using Reese's peanut butter chips, however, as they were way too sweet and overpowered the cookie. This isn't the recipe's fault though. Next time I'll try to find another brand of chips or chop the chips and use a smaller amount since I don't like my cookies terribly sweet.

I used mini reese's peanut butter cups in the middle of the cookies instead of using peanut butter chips - turned out perfect! I also added 1 tbsp of water to make the cookies more moist.

Followed the recipe to the T. My husband is a firefighter and went to the fire academy to do some training.  I made him two batches of cookies so that he could have something to snack on.  He shared them with some of the guys, and now he has people knock on his door to see if he some those "good cookies".

Wonderful! I had to make three batches for a church picnic because they kept disapearing! They are VERY rich. More like brownies. And they stay soft. I have now used peanut butter, chocalate, m&m's, and butterscotch chips. All great. Thank you SO much!

These came out a little bit flat for me, but I think my oven might be a little cool. I turned the temperature up 20 degrees to see if they would set before melting flat and they did really well. My husband loves them despite the fact that the first tray or so came out ugly. Try these!

These were very good, and oh so sweet!  Make sure you have milk to go with these!  These are chewy and a great chocolate flavored cookie, the peanut butter chips are the perfect accent.

Hmmm, very good!  If you love the flavor of peanut butter and chocolate (as I do), definately try these.  I hate when cookies flatten out, and these did not.  I'm trying not to eat them all while they're still warm.  I had to leave the kitchen!

I made this twice. The first time around, it's way too sweet even though I use my rule of reducing sugar 25% of all the recipes here. However I really like the texture of the cookies so I played around a bit and came up with half butter/half shortening. I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup (1/2 white and 1/4 brown). And also reduced the chips to 1 cup peanut butter chips and 1/2 cup chocolate chips to oomph the chocolate flavor. The cookies almost don't spread at all so you don't have to put it 1 inch apart. It's on the fluffy side, if you like them flatter try 1/2 tsp baking soda instead of 3/4 tsp and flatten a bit with a fork. Will definitely bake again, maybe with white chocolate chunks next time.

I like the thick and chewy nature of these cookies.  If you want a flatter cookie with the same taste, try the Reese's® Chewy Chocolate Cookie recipe on this site.  I used 50%wheat and 50%white flour (adding 2-3T. of water with the wet ingredients to account for the wheat flour), and they turned out great!  Each time I make these, they get rave reviews.

Used the 10 minute baking time and added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips in substitute of 1/2 a cup of the peanut butter chips because I had only one 12 oz. bag of peanut butter chips. Still hot and fresh out of the kitchen! Great fast and easy recipe for cookies.

Took forever to stir, it was so stiff. Also only used a little more than 1 cup of chips because it was so dense.

I loved these cookies and I'm not the greatest Baker but they turned out great.  The dough was a little thick and had me worried but was great. Dont cook past 10 mins as the bottoms burn easy learned that on my first batch lol.

I baked these cookies for my family & they said they were absolutely great! As I was the baker, not the taster, I have to comment on how sticky the dough was! I tried to just drop them on the sheet, but it stuck to everything! I did however, wet my fingertips a bit & shaped them on the tray & that worked well!

These are definitely a hit for chocolate lovers! It is like having a deep chocolate brownie converted into a cookie with little touches of peanut butter goodness!!

I made it as is, plus some chopped up Reese’s cups as I didn’t have a full two cups of peanut butter chips. Delicious! I scooped it into a half sheet pan covered with foil and spread it out to bake and cut into bars, so I could have smaller portions. I got 36 gorgeous, chocolatey, peanut-buttery bars and clean up is easy.

I made a half batch and followed the recipe. Baked for 10 minutes on convect bake 325 degrees. They flatten quite a bit when cool. Mine didn't turn out as pretty as the photo on the recipe here, but they are tasty! Kind of like a brownie cookie.

Scrumdiddlyumptious & very rich! Thumbs up all around at our house. The cookie is dark black & very rich (not the dark brown of brownies). I used butterscotch chips instead of peanut butter (because that is what I had) and they are delicious! This cookie goes perfect with milk or vanilla ice cream. I could see these making an outstanding ice cream-cookie sandwich.  I imagine if some wanted it to be less rich you could cut back on the cocoa. Even though these are drop cookies, I rolled them very lightly (1-2x around my palms) so they would bake evenly. Other cookies I've made w/ cocoa haven't always spread the same way as a tried & true chocolate chip cookie. They came out nice & even. The recipe made 5 dozen cookies.

Love. Love. Love. This recipe is perfect. If you want to add a little kick, 5-7 slices of cooked bacon crumbled in the cookie batter will do it.

No intentional changes. I accidentally added baking powder instead of baking soda. I tried to take out the baking powder but left it and added the baking soda to it as well.   It didn't seem to affect the cookies because they turned out perfect and really delicious. I will definitely make these again.

First time to make these, but it won’t be the last.  I added some sliced almonds to some & dusted with powdered sugar before they were completely cool.   Took them out after 8 minutes & I love the soft center.   I’m going to add them to my Christmas cookies.

I used shortening and butter (half of the butter it called for because it’s what I had) and half cup peanut butter chips and half milk chocolate chips. They were really good hot out of the oven but over the next few days they just were not good even though kept in a large zip lock bag.

I used a 1.5 TBSP scoop for the cookies to make a total of 33 cookies. I like how they had volume to them and dont go flat. I baked mine for 9 min. Will definitely be keeping this recipe! :)

There's not enough butter. They came out like puffy little cakes. I was hoping for a more soft, chewy texture.  After taking the first batch out of the oven and discovering this, I added more butter to the remaining dough. That helped some but still disappointed as I baked them to send to my son who's stationed in Okinawa. There's another recipe that calls for 1.5 C butter, think I'll try that one next time.

Very similar to my fave choco chip cookie recipe.  I substituted half the white sugar for brown to make it even closer. I love the taste & texture of these but at 10 mins on 350 mine were still VERY gooey...like hard to get the larger ones off the cookie sheet without them looking like a pile of goo. I took them out at 11 mins & made the next sheet smaller.
After cooling for a couple mins they were just like I love my cookies, kinda crisp on the outside but very soft inside! Great flavor & just the right amount of sweetness!

I made these delicious cookies for a bake sale. I didn’t have any peanut butter chips, so I substituted them for semi-sweet mini chocolate chips. When I put the cookies in the oven for 11 minutes, they were still really raw, so I put them in the oven at 350 F for 13-15 minutes. They turned out delicious!

Tasty cookies. I used Hershey’s special dark cocoa powder. Dough is very thick. I added the peanut butter chips, in one third I also added butterfinger baking bits, and in the last third I also added white chocolate chips.  For thinner crispier cookies, slightly flatten the “dropped” cookies.

I substituted the peanut butter chips with the peanut butter M&M candy. The dough was thick and nonstick. I was worried that they were undercooked at 10 minutes so I baked the second patch longer than 10 minutes. The result was better. My boys loved their first bites of the cookies. My boys want more so I am pleased with the turnout. I will make more later. Thank you for sharing this recipe. God bless.

Very good cookie recipe!!  I made them into large cookies and baked for 13 minutes.   In the past I made these cookies following the recipe on the back of the Hershey  peanut butter chips package.  That recipe produced  cookies that tended to spread.  These cookies hold their shape and taste heavenly.

This is the best cookie recipe I've ever made! I added 1 cup mini chocolate chip pieces, which went perfectly.  It was an unusually stiff dough, so, after eight minutes in the oven, I flattened them out with a fork and baked them for another five minutes. Also, instead of greasing them pan, I took the easy route and placed a piece of parchment paper on it instead. I usually double the batch, but I didn't this time, and I turned out making 24 large cookies! Tip: Eat them the morning after you've baked them with an ice-cold glass of milk for the best experience!

Wow! One of the best cookie recipes I've ever made and also my new favorite cookie.  My husband and I love the pb/chocolate combo and these really hit the spot. I used Reese's brand of pb chips (my favorite chocolate brand) and they worked out nicely. I froze half the batch (form into balls and throw in a freezer storage bag) and just added a minute or two to the bake time, no need for defrosting, and they were perfect each time.

I made this recipe as is with the exception of halving it. In my honest opinion, the cookie was decently good. It wasn't as sweet as I would imagine a chocolate cookie to be, so next time I'll up the sugar. texture was cake like too.

These were great. 
I made 1 1/2 the recipe, using 1 cup butter and 1/3 cup chunky peanut butter. 
I also used 1 1/2 cup sugar and 3/4 cup brown sugar. 
I addition, I added about half a bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips I had in the pantry.

We loved these cookies.  What struck me is that they didn't fall flat, and were nicely soft but not mushy.  I'm glad I added almost a cup of mini semi sweet chocolate chips in addition to the other ingredients, or else I think these cookies could have turned out a bit bland.  Next time I might add a bit more salt, or use salted butter.  I also used half brown sugar and half white instead of all white sugar, in addition to being very generous with the vanilla since I didn't have a high-quality one on hand, just my emergency, better than nothing back-up generic. I kind of think those changes made it five star.

Used white chocolate chips instead of peanut butter chips, turned out great! If you're looking for a chewy cookie with slightly crispy edges, definitely try these. I made 38 cookies from this recipe. Another user here suggested slightly flattening the mixture on the tray, which I did.

I bake cookies every day and this is the first 5 star rating I have given one. I have made so many chocolate cookies and this recipe really does turn out chewy. I added a little more cocoa to make it dark chocolate. I also used chopped up mini reese's peanut butter cups instead of peanut butter chips. I also made some pressing mini marshmallows in the top instead of peanut butter chips for a more s'mores taste.

ChocolatePeanutButterLover: Sub 1/3 c butter with natural peanut butter. Reduce the sugar by about 1/4 cup. Sub 1/2 white for brown sugar. 1&1/2 cups of chips is enough. Flatten dropped batter with a fork for a chewier cookie that's not as thick. Bake 9 mins. Press 1/4 c pb chips on top of the cookies right out of the oven for a nicer presentation.  XMAS: sub chips with walnut pieces and glacé cherries. Makes 3 doz. btw.

Ok these are so good. I ran out of peanut butter chips so I used chocolate chips which was still super good. It also made over 70 cookies which I didn't expect so now I have a ton of cookies... The cook time for my oven was around 13 minutes, not 10, and I cooled each batch for about 10 minutes (I used two trays). The cook time varies from oven to oven though. Overall, it's a great recipe, especially if you're throwing a party!

Didn't realize this would be a "soft" cookie, which I do not like.

I first tried these cookies out on my family.  I followed the recipe to the letter.  I was surprised how thick the batter was...almost like brownies so needless to say I was a little concerned.  My concern was unwarranted.  They are the best!!! My husband liked them so much that I had to make a batch for him to take in the "work cookie container" that gets passed around.  They all loved them so much that this is the only cookie allowed in the "work cookie container"

The chocolate cookie base was outstanding especially when slightly overcooked.  FOr my taste the pb chips were far too sweet.  Next time (and there will be a next time) I will replace the pb chips with a 50/50 mix of dark chocolate chips and either mint chips or  baking M&Ms.

I've been making these cookies for years. Everyone gobbles them up, you can't go wrong. Just note that the recipe says 12 servings, but it makes at least 24-36 actual cookies.

Love this recipe. I make it exactly as stated, and every time it has made a truly delicious cookie. I have made this with peanut butter chips, mint chips and chocolate chips so far. I am sure I will think of new chips to try, but I will not use a different chocolate cookie recipe ever again. Thanks for sharing!

These are pretty awesome. I brought them to work and they were very popular.  The only thing I did different was add a cup of big fat white chocolate chips, because why not?  I will add the white chocolate chips again next time too.

These turned out nicely.  If you like brownies, you'll love them--the texture and moistness is just like brownies.  Personally I was hoping for something lighter in texture.

Oh my gosh SO GOOD and fudgy. I usually make the Hershey's recipe, but will be retiring that one after trying this one! Sometimes I swap out peanut butter chips for white chocolate, or mint for the holidays. DECLICIOUS!

I liked these cookies, but they didn't taste as good as I had hoped.  I didn't change the recipe, so I don't know where I went wrong.  I will try again, but maybe I won't put as many peanut butter chips in it.

Amazing!!  My 7 year old daughter and I made these after school.  I prepped all the ingredients before hand to make it go smoother.  We had so much fun and I want to teach her to love to cook and make memories with the two of us sharing a special time such as making delicious cookies together.

I followed the recipe to the Tee, except for one thing....I added a secret ingredient (a tablespoon of instant decaf coffee).  I learned this trick from many pastry chefs and it truly makes a difference.  

Then, I tried the trick of baking it for 9 minutes, then taking it out of the oven and banging the cookie sheet on the counter top and letting it cook for another 2 minutes on the hot cookie sheet before taking them off. WOW, it made them crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.  

A perfect 10.  This is a keeper.  Thank you so much for sharing!

Great recipe!  They are slightly sweet and light on chocolate flavor.  The peanut butter-chocolate combination is delicious.  Mine didn't spread too much and turned out crispy on the edges and chewy in the middle.

I made these cookies for my husband and kids, who are huge peanut butter/chocolate fans.  Usually I can take the combo or leave it.  These, however, are AMAZING.  The cookie is soft, almost brownie- like.  The only change I made was to use margarine instead of butter.  I find that it makes a chewier cookie.  WONDERFUL recipe, and it will be used frequently, I'm sure!

These were a big hit. I baked them just short of the time, because I like a really soft cookie. They were a little too much like batter in the center (though still delicious), so I'll stick with the recipe next time around.

I made a couple changes, but these were AMAZING. I used one stick butter and 1/3 to 1/2 cup vegetable oil. Also used 1 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup packed brown sugar. I only had a half bag of Reese's peanut butter chips. Wow, these cookies are moist and chewy, even after cooling. Not too flat, just right. Will definitely be making them again.

I used a bag Reece's Peanut Butter chips and added a 1/2 cup of Trader Joe's semi-sweet chocolate chips.  Turned out great.  Everyone loved them - kids, neighbors, friends.

Good (I believe) as written. As always I tinkered w/original.   Sub 1/2 C oatmeal flour for 1/2 of ap flour, added 1/2 c peanuts, increased salt to 3/4 t, increased vanilla to 1T.  Dirtbiking boys and dads approved.  I agree with other positive reviewers that the basic chocolate dough is very well balanced and suitable to infinite variation.

AMAZING! Chewy delicious cookies!!!! Family said best they ever had homed or store bought. Baked until they looked still not quite done and they were chewy and so tasty! As someone else said this is a great chocolate cookie base as you could substitute just about anything into these bad boys and they would turn out fantastic!!!! Good luck but you won't need it!

I just served the first batch of these still warm and, after the first bite, my daughter said they're the best cookies she's ever had. (And I make some really good chocolate chip cookies, too.) My husband barely finished the first one before he was reaching for another. YUM!

The taste is very good, but it's a little bit on the dry side. Next time I will try using a bit more butter.

These are amazing! I used some chocolate chips to replace a small fraction of the peanut butter chips and they were still amazing and everyone loved them. Thank you so much for sharing this.

Love this recipe! I was also looking for a good chocolate base to use with my crushed Andes mints! This worked out beautifully. I will be trying it with the peanut butter chips also. The cookie itself is soo nice, it's kinda soft and fluffy almost cake like with a perfect outer crisp to it.

Only change was to add some semi-sweet chocolate chips with the peanut butter ones.  Amazing fresh out of the oven.  Once cooled, they are crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Very yummy.

Nice mild flavor. I didn't have peanut butter chips so I used 1 cup mini m&m's and 1 cup crushed walnuts. After the first batch came out a little on the raw side I upped the cooking time to 10 minutes. Good recipe and cookies don't spread much, even if you don't refrigerate the dough beforehand.

like a brownie with peanut butter chips!  Everyone at my house gobbled them down, 3 adults and 3 boys all loved them. My toddler didn't like them but she doesn't seem to like chocolate yet.

I found this recipe to be extremely bland. I didn't try it once but twice they just didn't have a lot of taste to it. I have a feeling that it just didn't need as much flour as recommended and probably at least a 1/4 cup less of chips.

One of the best cookie recipes I've ever made. I used chocolate chips and M&M's rather than peanut butter chips. They were moist and chewy and delicious.  Will try other add-ins next time.

These cookies are ridiculous!!!  They are so soft and chocolatey!  My family of four can polish off a batch in 48 hours easily!  They are the perfect combination of chocolate and peanut butter!!!  What a treat!!!  You will not be disappointed.

Followed the recipe exactly as written, except I did not grease my pan.  I had no problems with sticking. I also cooled my cookies on cardboard; it helps to absorb some of the grease (I used to use newspaper, but I don't like newspaper ink soaking into food I'm going to feed my kids).  Cookies did not spread a lot and have a chewier texture versus crispy.  I baked mine for 10 minutes.  I got 3 dozen cookies using the Pampered Chef medium scoop.  Very simple, very good.

This turned out for me to be a disaster. I followed to letter--dough was too dry & pb chips never melted. I tried a variety of things to make it more moist as I baked in batches but they never worked :0(

These are great! After reading some reviews, I added 1/3 cup peanut butter... and I only had 1 2/3 cup p/b chips, so I topped it off with some mini chocolate chips.  Baked for 9 minutes and they are PERFECT! Yum! Thanks for the recipe.

Yummo!  I made these the other night and my husband who is not a big sweet eater (by choice for fitness reasons) told me never to make them again because he couldn't stay away from them!  My children loved them as well.  This is a go to recipe from now on!

The best chocolate peanut butter cookie I ever made.
I like to use peanut butter M&Ms in them.  A friends son made these for the NY state fair and got a honorable purple ribbon for 4-H.  it's a keeper.

We did not enjoy these at all, unfortunately!  The premise sounded promising and like something we would love.  I made these Christmas Eve for Santa and it was all he could do to choke one down, lol.  The texture was a bit too much like a brownie and the cocoa was too overpowering, in my opinion.  The peanut butter chips were completely lost.  Will not make again.

Just got through making this and the wife and kids love them. Crispy on the outside - soft in the middle. Mixed in 1/3 white choc chips along with 2/3's peanut butter chips to help balance out the cocoa a little ant they look and tasted great. Wonderful recipe. This first time was a trial run for our annual Holiday gift giving... it made the list and was so good I am taking it for office Christmas dessert party.  Don't know how anyone could not love these. Enjoy!

Excellent cookies!  Easy to make and tastes delicious.  I had a bag of PB Chips that was 1 2/3 cups, and I thought there were still plenty in the cookies.  I'm excited to try variations on this nice chocolate cookie base.  Thanks - this is a winner!

Perfect combination of chocolate and peanut butter. Followed recipe exact. Wouldn't make any changes. Rich, soft, and hits the craving spot along with a glass of milk.
FYI - These make WAY more than the listed 2 dozen. It's more like 4 1/2 to 5 dozen cookies depending on size.

Great recipe.  I did use one suggestion by another member with using 1/2 cup of peanut butter instead of chips.  These are delicious.

I added less sugar- only 1 cup of white sugar and 1/4 cup of brown sugar. I also did half shortening and half butter. These are amazing! Best recipe I found for!

Wow, I made these cookies a couple hours ago and boy are they tasty!!  After following the recipe to a tee I found the balance of chocolate and peanut butter flavors to be perfect and I really enjoyed the chewy/moist texture. I will definitely be making these again!  Thanks for the recipe!!!

Wow! These cookies were amazing! The only change I made to the recipe was to use half margarine and half butter because I was low on butter and they still came out fabulous.

Love these cookies! My son is allergic to milk so I substituted the butter with 1 1/3 cup of veg. oil. I also tweaked it a bit by adding pecans, only 1 cup of sugar and used semi sweet peanutbutter chips. They were still very sweet and turned out great. I made big cookies rather than small ones so they took about 3 extra minutes to bake but came out wonderful. Chewy! Yes! Delicious!

Absolutely delicious! I did make a couple changes since I didnt have all the ingredients. Instead I used half of white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar. Also used 1/2 cup of peanut butter instead of the peanut butter chips.  Cant wait to make these again!

My husband loved them! My only issue with them is how quickly they lost their chewy consistency. They got kind of crumbly, not even crispy, a few days after baking.

I didn't care for these cookies...but everyone else in my world raved about them. Diff'rent strokes, I guess! (I found the chocolate too overpowering and if I made them again I would reduce the cocoa.) Be careful with the baking time -- like brownies, they should be mushy when taken out of the oven - leave them to cool for a few minutes on the sheet before moving them to a cooling rack.

Um, yum.  Better than expected.  One of the only cookies I've ever made where I actually like the cookie better than the dough.  Perfect texture.  Mine took 12-15 minutes to bake though, and I got more than 24 cookies out of the recipe.

Yum! Two thumbs up. I split the dough in half and added peanut butter chips to first half and toffee chips to second. Both were outstanding! Crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside when straight from the oven. A new favorite.

These are delicious!  I live in Asia, and vanilla is hard to come by, so I only used one teaspoon.  Also, I used 1 cup of peanut butter chips (that's all I had) and some chopped up dark chocolate bar.  I will make these again even if I don't have any peanut butter chips.  I'm sure there are lots of other options that would taste good, too.

Very good! The dough was a little sticky, and made it hard to incorporate the chips evenly, but my husband has been consuming them very quickly. Will definitely stay in my recipe box and regular rotation. Thanks!

This cookies is delicious! The consistency is beyond words and the combination of chocolate and peanut butter is to die for. The batter was hard to work with after everything was mixed together and I began forming the cookies. But, it was worth the work. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

So good!  Chewy enough for me and crunchy enough for my husband.  Even my 5 year old, who hates peanut butter, couldn't stop eating these.  Thanks for a great recipe.

These are GREAT :) My husband has been gone for 3 weeks so I wanted to make him something special for his homecoming and BOY were these the right cookie.  The only thing I did different is I doubled it and did 1 cup of Brown Sugar and 2 cups of white and did one bag of Peanut Butter chips and one bag of Chocolate chips. I am posting this recipe on my Facebook for all my friends ... Thank You

These cookies are to die for! Anytime I bring them to a party they get rave reviews. Have replaced peanut butter chips for chocolate chips which is also a good result.

So delicious- almost like a brownie in texture. I balled the dough and pressed just a it, and they stayed nice and thick. My brother requests these all the time now. Thanks!

These are great but refrigerate them before forming balls and baking so they won't spread out too thin.

If I could, I'd give this recipe 10 stars- I'm not a peanut butter fan, so I just swap them out for chocolate chips (or do half a batch of each).  I've made these cookies countless times and every time people have raved about them.  My husband always asks for these over plain chocolate chip cookies.

OMG... pure bliss. I made these using smart balance spread and half a cup of wheat flour and these still turned out perfect. I baked for 8 minutes and these were on the gooey side, perfect with a tall glass of milk. MMMMmmmmm

These are good cookies, but I made them for Christmas with a bunch of other kinds of cookies and they weren't as popular as the rest. I think just because the darkness kind of scares people off. They were good though!

This is the absolute best cookie recipe ever! Well, in my opinion. I make it exactly as written, except the last few time I made it I did not have the chips so just made chocolate cookies. They are rich, moist, dense cookies. I put them in the fridge and they are like a piece of fudge! I crave these cookies all the time! It's an addiction.

These were utterly fantastic!  The only change I made was to add in about sixteen coarsely chopped reese's mini cups before baking. The milk chocolate bits were delicious contrasted against the rich chocolate flavor of the cookie itself. Yummy!

Turned out really good.  The only thing I did differently was chill the dough overnight (which was done because I was too tired to bake them that night, not because I wanted to change the recipe.) Because of this I had to flatten the balls of dough out using the bottom of a glass.  I made them using the small pampered chef scoop and baked for exactly 8 minutes.

Awesome super easy cookies!  I used shortening instead of butter and they came out soft and cake-like.  I also patted them down a bit with a fork prior to putting them in the oven as the batter is pretty thick.  Will definitely be making these again, and again!

I baked several different cookies for Halloween and New Year's Eve parties and I think this one was the best among them.  I have nothing bad to say about these.  I baked them for 10 minutes and they were nicely soft and chewy.  The right amount of sweetness and saltiness from the peanut butter chips got everybody's immediate attention and they disappeared quick.  Although a friend of mine disagree, I will definitely add some pecan or walnut pieces next time.  She thought they were just as perfect as they were.  Definitely making them again for sure!

In a word- YUMMY! I substituted butter flavored Crisco and they turned out really soft inside and crispy outside. A very easy cookie recipe and not overly sweet.  They were so good right out of the oven!

Amazing! Your friend’s mom is a miracle worker. I cannot bake and these cookies came out perfect. I did change the chips from peanut butter to heath chips and chocolate chips. That’s only because that’s what I had. I’m so making these again for a Christmas party and this time I’m using peppermint chips. Thank you thank you people think I can bake now.

We loved this recipe.  It was exactly what I was looking for.  I changed the 1 1/2 cups sugar to 3/4 granulated sugar and 3/4 light brown sugar.  And I used salted butter, just in case anyone had that question.  I found these baked up nicely right after the dough was mixed, and straight out of the fridge.  I used a small cookie scoop and scooped them heaping, baked for 11-12 minutes, got about 3 1/2 dozen.

Easy and delicious...as others have said, 1 recipe makes around 4 dozen.  I made the dough a day before and refrigerated it so that I could bake them up quickly, which worked great.  Just make sure to leave time for the dough to come back to room temperature, otherwise it is like trying to scoop rock hard ice cream.

Made these when some of my husband's friends came over and they were inhaled. I had to stash some away in a baggie so I could be sure my girls got some the next day. Didn't need to change a thing. I am not much of a baker, I prefer to cook, but these were truly idiot-proof!

This has t be the best cookie recipes I have tried in a long time.  The cookies came out so moist and chewy.  I couldn't find peanut butter chips, so I substitured the chocolate peanut butter swirl chips, and it the perfect amount of peanut butter flavor.  I baked these for 9 minutes and they came out perfect.  I made my cookies into 1" balls, and it made about 4 dozen cookies.  I think I ate a dozen all by myself!

I learned the hard way, chopped up peppermint patties do NOT work in this recipe.  I did half with chips and they were ok.  The other half I replaced the chips with chopped peppermint patties and they melted all over the baking sheet.  I prefer the chocolate mint cookies from this site.

I wanted a chocolate-based cookie and these turned out perfect. I followed the recipe to a T, except I wasn't in the mood for peanut butter chips, so I used butterscotch I had on hand and they turned out awesome!! Didn't dry out at all, still very moist and chewy when cool, just as I wanted. Perfect!

I was disappointed in these cookies with the high rating it had... My youngest daughter who LOVES chocolate took a bite and asked what was in these cookies. I'm sure the disappointment was my fault??? Not sure what I did wrong. The only thing I did different was I used the Peanut Butter swirl chocolate chips and the reese's peanut butter chips. My husband said he didn't think they were bad and neither did my oldest daughter who doesn't care for chocolate too much. I tried them and they were OK.

These are really great! I used a bit less sugar than was called for and they were plenty sweet.  These are very rich cookies and the batter was very thick. I will definitely use this recipe again and again, thanks!

This is a yummy cookie and is easy to make. Great recipe, just not my favorite type of cookie. I followed the recipe using mini peanut butter chips, and used 1/2 crisco, 1/2 butter. I cooked mine at about 9 minutes and they turned out chewy and not too gooey, and boy are they good when they are still warm! If overcooked, they are not nearly as good. Grab a glass of milk and enjoy!

I am so skeptical when it comes to cookie recipes; it seems like even cookies with very high ratings are still not that great to my family. This cookie was the exception. It's absolutely perfect and everyone raved about them. I followed the directions exactly aside from cutting the sugar back to 1 cup and using half whole wheat/half unbleached white flour and butterscotch chips instead of peanut butter chips (it's just what I had on hand). These are a keeper. I can't wait to take them to church events, get togethers, etc. I know they'll get rave reviews!

I baked these exactly as the recipe stated, except I baked mine for 10 mins.  My oven always requires a little more time to finisg baking things.  They turned out fantastic.  I used a cookie scoop so I got a few more cookies out of this recipe.  I am glad I did becuase my husband ate every single one of them in 2 days.  Thanks for submitting a great recipe!

I used Ghiradelli Chocolate chips in place of the PB chips; and I put in about 2/3 the amount of chips called for. I also added chopped walnuts. DELICIOUS!!!! Also--unless you make these quite large, you will likely end up with far more than the 2 dozen yield.

These were awesome.  I made them big and they needed about 12 minutes to cook.  I followed the recipe exactly except substitued not quite a 1/2 cup brown sugar and not quite a full cup regular sugar, that way it wasn't quite as sweet.  They are sooooooo good.  I couldn't stop eating the batter as I was spooning it onto the cookie sheet!

These are actually the same dough as "Chocolate Chocolate Chip Cookies I" on this site, which is my neighbor's favorite cookie variety that I bake...
Peanut Butter chips add another flavor than just "chocolate again."

Great recipe.  They was not enough peanut butter flavour as I would have liked. I would replace some of the butter with peanut butter as per other viewers suggestions. Plus I would not add the salt if you use salted butter. But they turned out nice and soft.... I will make them again.

Did these for our GRIN Girl's Night In bunch; "Girls Raised In the NORTH" with one member who owns a local "casual fine dining restaurant".No pressure here when it's your turn to contribute!
Didn't have the peanut butter chips so I subbed s-sw chocolate chips in one batch, walnuts & s-sw chips in another and coconut & s-sw chips in another.
Whew & Thanks ... I'm safe for my dessert contribution.

I have made these cookies many times since I found the recipe and have loved them every time.  Sometimes we use M&M's baking bits, chocolate chips or sprinkles instead.

These were great.  I used 1T Vanilla.  Before adding peanut butter chips I split the dough in half.  I half the dough I added 1C coconut + 1C White Chocolate Chips.  In the other half I added 1/4C peanut butter and 1C peanut butter chips.  Both versions were a hit.

These are great. They're delicious, people love them, and they're easy to make. I always have trouble with making them look like cookies and not big clumps, but their appearance does not diminish their tastiness. I don't think it has anything to do with the recipe, it's probably something that I am doing wrong. I think the problem lies in the fact that I don't form them correctly.

Instead of the peanut butter chocolate chips, I sprinkled half of my cookies with chopped walnuts and the other half with powdered sugar.  I even spread peanut butter on one for my mom, who adores peanut butter!  The cookies were very soft when they came out of the oven, but they stiffened to a wonderfully chewy consistency once they cooled down.  This recipe is so simple and perfect for those times when you don't feel like visiting the grocery store to buy special ingredients.

These are okay.  I used butterscotch chips instead so they are pretty sweet, maybe two sweet actually.  I'll try again with peanut butter sometime.

A great chocolate cookie base! I used a bag of white chocolate chips and 1 1/2 cups of dried cranberries and won over the heart of a ONLY chocolate chip cookie lover. The dough was easy to work with and the cookies kept soft for quite a while.

These are fantastic!  Made them for my son and he thought they were delicious.
My best friend also loved them!  Will def. make this again.

I also made a second batch but tossed in white chocolate chips instead of peanut butter!

The cookies were good, but my husband, who adores chocolate, did not rave about them.  Apparently, the chocolate cookie was a bit overpowering -- but not in the "chocolatey" way.  If you would not choose a chocolate cookie over a "traditional" chocolate chip cookie or oatmeal cookie, I wouldn't recommend this recipe.

Awesome recipe, much better than the recipe on the peanut butter chip bag.  They do not spread much, and are very moist and chewy.  Using a small cookie scoop, this recipe made 75 cookies.  Baked for 9 minutes (I have pretty heavy cookie sheets) and they came out great.

This was an awesome recipe! Though I did change it a little bit. I didn't have any cocoa powder so I just put in 1/2 butter and 1/2 Crunchy peanut butter. I also put in chocolate chips instead of peanut butter chips. It came out really well!

This is an amazing recipe! I have to admit, I haven't followed directions exactly yet since I don't care for peanut butter chips that much. However, I followed other recommendations and included 1/4-1/2 cup peanut butter with wonderful results. I also made one batch without the pb and added fresh cranberries in place of the chips, which gave them a great sweet/sour taste.

I personally do not like peanut butter. I made these for a potluck and everyone absolutely loved them. So I figured they deserved five stars from all of the raves I got. The only change I made was adding 1/2 cup of peanut butter and I used the chocolate/peanut butter swirled chips.

I made these for a cookie exchange and they were awesome.  I think the quantity is off, I wanted to make 36 and it told me I needed 6 cubes of butter!  So I just did half and it made a ton of cookies.

I loved the recipe, yet didn't have a lot of things on hand. So, I used margarine instead of butter, and did a cup of chocolate chucks and a cup of craisins to take the 2 cups of peanut butter chips. But they still turned out delicious!

YUM!! First batch I made with peanut butter chips, second batch I made with butterscotch chips with mini milk chocolate kisses pressed into the top. Those were delicious. Next time I will try white chocolate and macadamian nuts.... a great base for so many possible variations. Thanks....this is now my very favorite cookie recipie!

These cookies are very soft delicious! They have a mild chocolate taste that blends well with the peanut butter chips - I used Nestle Peanut Butter & Milk Chocolate Morsels. Also, I would recommend completely melting the butter as opposed to simply creaming it with the sugar...the dough becomes very stiff and nearly impossible to work with after you (try to) blend all the dry ingredients together. For an aesthetic touch, I rolled each cookie in sugar prior to baking it -- it came out beautiful!

I substituted peanut butter cups for the chips and they came out great!  Very good cookie that I would make again.

Definitely will make these again!  A few alterations: only 3/4 c. butter, because that's all I had; reduced sugar to 1 c.; used 2/3 c. wheat flour (you could taste it if you knew it was there - I might reduce it to 1/3 c. next time); and reduced PB chips to 1 c. (I might use the whole bag of chips next time).  I also would've like more chocolate flavor, believe it or not, so I might increase the cocoa as well.  This recipe is a keeper!

This recipe made me over 60 cookies, and within the first few minutes of their presentation, almost 10 were gone!  Due to a lack of peanut butter chips, I decided to use chopped walnuts, and it made for an extremely delicious combination.

Delicious! I, too thought the batter was very thick and a bit concerned, but boy was I wrong. These puffed nicely and held together wonderfully. The only thing I did different was decrease the butter by 3 tablespoons. Thanks for the recipe!!

These were really easy to make and turned out fantastic.  I didn't have two cups of peanut butter chips.  I used one bag which is actually 1 2/3 cups, but it was plenty "peanutbuttery".  Definitely a keeper!  Thank you!

I loved it. It taste so good i couldn't stop eating them. They were very thin and very chewy. And before putting them on the cookie sheet you should put them in the fridge. But i loved them!

These disappeared very quickly.  They almost taste like brownies they are so rich.  When I first made the batter I thought the recipe was wrong because it was so thick, but they turned out delicious.

We loved these.  Great combination of chocolate and peanut butter.  I added some chocolate chips to the mix and that made these cookies all the more delicious.

This recipe is wonderful. I don't know why people think they're to sweet. Soft and gooey. And even my boyfriend who hates chocolate/peanut butter combinations liked these cookies.

These are so good!  I started to give these a five, but after the cookies cooled, they had a hard time staying together.  They seemed to crumble.  I'm pretty sure I measured everything correctly and I even had to extend the cooking time a bit.  But at any rate, even the crumbs were delicious!

I made these cookies for a friend's birthday and they were a huge hit!  I followed the recipe exactly, except that the bag of peanut butter chips I bought was too small so I added a few semi-sweet morsels to bulk the cookies up.  Delicious! Next time I will buy the right size and see if I can peanut butter them up, but they don't *need* it--- these cookies are soft, rich and delicious!

I loved this cookie and devoured them regardless that I follow the South Beach eating plan for the last year and a half. They do turn out soft but I think I have a slow oven. Baking them longer just made them keep their shape and they did not dry out. It kept its chewy texture even for long baking times. I did use the top rack of my oven because I dislike crusty cookie bottoms.

Very tasty cookies.  I did have adjust the cooking time to 12 minutes though. The batter was very thick and sticky, tough to work with but well worth it.

YUM YUM YUM!! These cookies are so good and even simpler to make.  I substituted chocolate chips in place of the peanut butter chips (didn't have any on hand) and they were even better.  I am notorious for screwing up chocolate cookies but this recipe made me look gourmet. Too easy not to try!
