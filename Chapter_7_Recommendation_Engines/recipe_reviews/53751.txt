Made as written (or should I say my husband made as written) except he used casing instead of the netting and ground up the peppercorn instead of leaving them whole. This turned out really good! We have made a LOT of summer sausage and with venison too but this one had the best texture of all of them by far. Most get kind of a wet smacky texture but this stayed the perfect firmness. While the texture was SPOT ON, the flavor lacked a little in my opinion. I will add more of the seasoning and add some cayenne pepper or even more black pepper next time. This is a keeper and one I intend on playing around with more once I have venison.  Thanks for sharing!
