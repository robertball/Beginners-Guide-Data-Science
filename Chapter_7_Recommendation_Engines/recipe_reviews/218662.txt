This is a really sweet and simple almond cake. It is like a cake donut in texture, with a slightly crispy top. I glazed it while it was still warm, and even my husband, who doesn't care for almond flavouring, liked it.

Very moist, delicious, and easy to make.  Would be a great breakfast bread. Reminds me of an almond shortbread cookie.
