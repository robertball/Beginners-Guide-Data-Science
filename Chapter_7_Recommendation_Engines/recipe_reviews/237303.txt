CASSANDRE - why don't you just put up your own recipe? What you have done is completely different from what the original author submitted! And your version sounds terrible, BTW. This is so aggravating with this site. Don't review recipes if you HAVE NOT actually made THIS recipe. 'Nuff said.

Simply delicious! It was so good my siblings finished the tahini sauce with their spoons. 

I just changed a few things to suit my tastes :

Marinate chicken with 2 tsp tahini and 3-4 drops of lemon juice for 3 hours in the fridge.
Bring ¾ cup + 2 tbsp water and half of a Maggi®’s heart vegetable broth (Coeur de bouillon Légumes, Maggi®) to a boil over medium-high heat.
On low heat, whisk in tahini, soy sauce, 1 large clove of garlic and ginger. (I skipped honey, but still delicious.) Then, add 2 tsp of Tipiak® Fécule de Cuisine (a mix of potato and manioc starches) and cook on very low heat for 4-5 minutes.

Just before serving, cook the chicken on low heat in a non-stick frypan without butter or fat : the oil in tahini and the low heat will avoid the chicken to stick and it will cook slowly to keep the meat very tender and juicy.

This was surprisingly good! I altered it somewhat. I added a yellow bell pepper and an onion. Sauted them with the minced garlic and then added the water and the bouillon. Then I added the tahini, soy sauce, honey, garlic, sesame seeds, and pepper. I also added some cashew butter and thai chili paste which added a nice kick and enhanced the flavor of the sauce. I added the chicken and some froze broccoli florets last so that it would not be overcooked and it would take on flavor from the sauce. I did not add the flour at all because the sauce was already thick. In fact, I had to add some additional chicken stock to thin it out. Served it with rice. Overall, though, really great!

Made no changes but did double it. My kids and I loved it and we all had seconds (which is against my diet but it couldn't be helped!). I hardly ever make the same thing twice but this one is going on a rotation! I served it over rice and we had baked yellow squash also. Would be great with broccoli and other veggies added in.

I increased the garlic to two cloves and thickened with 1 tablespoon corn starch instead of flour. If I were to repeat I would add chopped pimentos for color and whole cashews for texture. My household thought that this dish was so-so.

I wish that there was a 4 1/2 stars, but I'm rounding up. Anyway I really liked this, but felt that the sauce came out sort of... thick. Maybe that's my fault? I had kept the tahini in the fridge and it was a little thick, so I'd suggest that if you are using tahini let it get to room temperature. Anyway, it was really tasty, with a nice hint of sweetness. I used a pound of chicken tenderloins and it worked out well. I used vegetable broth instead of a bouillon cube, and didn't use any sesame seeds because I didn't have any! :) 

I didn't use any rice or noodles or anything -- instead, I served it with some sauteed dark leafy greens (an "Asian" blend with bok choy, kale, chard, etc) that I'd sauteed in a peanut oil blend with some more of the fresh ginger. I think it worked well together as a fairly healthy meal.

Fantastic! I added coriander, ginger, black pepper, cinnamon, and cloves to the pan cooking the chicken. I substituted pancake mix for the flour I did not have for the sauce.  I served it with cooked gold beets in a pita topped with cilantro. So delicious!!

I have made this 2x since finding the recipe. I have this jar of tahini that I was trying to use up! This recipe was a perfect solution.  I love feeling like I am cooking outside of my usual comfort zone with this. Creamy and yummy served over rice and with a solid veggie side. I will keep watching for new ways other cooks have added a twist to this base recipe.

Fabulous! I've used Allrecipes for years... and this recipe inspired me to review for the first time. I decided to try this, wanting to use up my tahini. Thanks to other reviewers for additional ideas. I served this tahini chicken over rice and served with a tomato, cucumber, red onion, balsamic vinegarette salad. For the sauce, I added a chopped white onion, extra garlic and ginger, some lemon juice, and extra pimentos that were hanging out in my fridge. For the chicken, I leveraged another reviewer's ideas and cooked with coriander and pepper. I served with a slice of lime, green onions, cilantro, and a dab of garlic chili paste (sambal oloek). My family devoured it! Thanks!

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe. Next time I will omit the flour, sauce was thick enough without it. I didn't have fresh ginger so used dried instead. I topped with toasted pine nuts since I didn't have sesame seeds. We served with hummus, and a salad of diced fresh tomatoes, chopped parsley, purple onion in a balsamic and olive oil dressing. Next time I will try over couscous and add some cayenne like other reviewers mentioned. Very tasty.

WOW - Everyone loved it! It was really delicious and not hard to make. I followed the recipe, except I used  3 chicken breasts instead of 2 because  I didn't think 2 would  be enough for us. Will definitely make again - thanks for sharing this recipe!!!

I made no changes to ingredients besides subbing out chicken broth for the water, and we did not care for this dish. There just wasn't any flavor to the sauce and we ended up drowning it in soy sauce to get it to taste ok.

Turned out really bland for some reason and I used the exact ingredients except I did add some red bell pepper. The only other thing I did different was I through it all in the crockpot. Probably won't be making this again.

I thought this recipe was delicious! Simple, quick and tasty! I decided last minute to make rice but it would've only taken the estimated 10 minutes to cook had I only made the chicken and sauce.

4 21 17 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/237303/tahini-chicken/ ... 'Never had tahini chicken until now.  Maybe I'm just not a fan of it.  I like tahini though.  I subbed homemade chicken broth, 3/4c; & 3/4t dried ginger.  Maybe I'll like it better tomorrow.  'Seems kinda bland; not bad, just bland.  Next day:  I do like it better.  The ginger flavor developed.  Maybe a little sesame oil would be a good idea.

This is simply awesome! It is very easy! The chicken marinated in tahini browns up so beautifully with the Oil from the tahini. I used just a touch of sesame oil and also made again using shrimp. I have served it with rice and I have turned it into a pad Thai version with rice noodles. Can't say enough about how good and versatile this recipe is! Very open to interpretation too! It's staying in my cooking repertoire!

Quick and easy.  I didn't have honey, so substituted with sugar. Next time I will try with a bit of brown sugar (I don't use honey for anything else).  I made my own tahini from a recipe here: roasted sesame seeds pulsed in a food processor or blender  with olive oil.  My husband found it a bit bland (hence the 4 stars) Next time I might try a couple of hot peppers, or a jalepeno, chopped fine.

This was very good! I was skeptical since this recipe looked kinda plain, I followed someone's tip and marinated the chicken with half lime and tahini, I used corn starch instead flour,  I added half of the ginger, at the end added some coliflower, yellow carrots and broccoli because I wanted to add some color and texture  and added some salt and pepper to taste, I loved it!

I agree  with the author of the recipe that this is an out of the ordinary flavor with the tahini as the main flavor.  I tweaked it a tiny bit, to adjust to what I know my family likes (we love ginger, so I added more, and I used a bit more soy sauce than written).  We toasted a good handful of sesame seeds and sprinkled on top just before serving, as well as a sprinkle of sliced green onions (mostly for the pop of color and fresh taste).  We were getting tired of eating the same old things on rotation, and this perked up our taste buds just perfectly.  Oh, and my 9 year old loved it, which is a bonus when kids will eat the same meal as the adults!!  Sorry, one more thing... we served over couscous but I actually think next time I would prefer it with rice.

I've made this several times, it's a recipe that tastes like you spent hours making it. I use Whole Foods general tsos chicken chunks instead of actual chicken and vegetarian chicken bouillon. I increase the water to 1 c., add a pinch of ground red pepper and omit the flour.  I simmer the finished dish uncovered until the sauce thickens on it's own. I serve this over plain rice that I've added some cooked mushrooms and a handful of chopped cashews to. Thank you

I love this recipe and it's become part of my repertoire. I usually end up adding more honey. I serve it with quinoa and it's very good. The nuttiness of the quinoa goes very nicely with the nuttiness of the sauce. Tips: At first, when you put the tahini with the other sauce ingredients, it doesn't look like it's going to mix right at all. Stir it with a whisk for a bit, and then as you slowly cook the sauce-over very low heat, I've found-the whole sauce comes together very nicely. And the flavors meld as you're cooking the chicken. Like I said, I usually add more honey because the soy sauce makes it a little too salty. But when you balance it with more honey it's good. Re. fresh ginger, don't be afraid to buy it even if you've never used it before. It's weird-looking but trust me. The flavor is NOTHING like dried ground ginger. Peel some of the ginger root with a vegetable peeler-don't cut it off the "hand" of ginger-just peel some and cut that part off and chop it. Put the rest of the ginger in a ziplock bag and keep it in the freezer almost indefinitely. Tahini keeps forever in the cupboard too.

Simple and delicious! I would add a little more ginger next time, and maybe a few drops of chili oil or something. My husband loved it, and the leftovers the second day were just as good!

I picked up tahini sauce from a South Asian supermarket in my neighborhood and thought I'd give this recipe a try.  Oh how wonderful the blend of garlic, ginger and sesame came together in the sauce.  I doubled the recipe and my husband and kids loved it the first night and we're thrilled we had leftovers for the next night.

This was delightfully tasty, and pretty quick and easy to make for a novice like me. The hardest part was finding Tahini, which I ended up ordering a big jar of off Amazon. But that jar will go to good use--I'll definitely be making this again!

This was a fantastic quick main dish! I didn't have fresh ginger, so I used ground. It still tasted great! I will definitely make this again! It went very well over basmati rice. And I served a green salad with it. My husband and daughter loved it too!
