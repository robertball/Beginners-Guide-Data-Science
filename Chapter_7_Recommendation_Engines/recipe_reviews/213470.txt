Very delicious, wonderful blend of spices, my husband ejoyed it and is from India but suggested I add a little yogurt next time to increase the amount of the gravy.  Curry chicken is one of his favorite dishes but he prefers more gravy.  He also suggested adding some serrano peppers or indian chilies.  It is great served over Basmati rice.  Thanks Madhu!

Delicious! I made a few changes though... I used a 28oz can of diced tomatoes instead of one fresh tomato, added 2 tsp cumin, carrots, mushrooms and bell pepper.  Also, I don't know what ghee is and I didn't have any cilantro, so I omitted those.  I used 1/2tsp ground cardamom instead of the pods.  Turned out really well!

Fun to try a traditional Indian recipe. Most curries in the U.S. have curry powder in them but I didn't miss it in here at all. This dish was very flavorful. I added some cooked potatoes which I already had and some peas and carrots. I will make this again!

This was delicious and spicy. I substituted a can of diced tomato for the sliced tomato, omitted the cardamom and ghee since I didn't have them (and cardamom's expensive), and threw in a small amount of ground cinnamon instead of cinnamon stick. You have to be careful if you do this (

I made this recipe last night, & it is a keeper. It was flavorful & slightly exotic. My meat & potatoes crew wanted seconds. The only change I made was to add more water than that specified in the recipe; 3 tablespoons water added at various cooking stages was not enough. I ended up adding about 1/4 cup after I added the chicken. Then I allowed it to simmer as directed. Sooo good! I served it with long grain white rice, though I imagine Basmati rice would be great as a side dish.

This was an amazing recipe! Absolutely worth the time it took to prep and cook! I read the comments and agree that you need more than 3 tablespoons of water. I did not use glee, but butter and substituted the tomato for a can of diced tomatoes. I also added green beans, julienned onions and red peppers. Delicious!

I give it three stars because I just don't trust my midwestern palate.  I made this recipe exactly as called for.  It was a lot of work.  In the end I was so disappointed because I really didn't care for it.  My husband however, thought it was great.  I tasted 'bitter' very strongly whereas my husband (who loves bitter things) did not tasted bitter and really liked it.  I wish I could pinpoint what in the recipe caused my bitter backlash, then I would try modifying it.  So, to summarize, I'd give this a one star, my husband would give it 5 stars, so three stars it is.

Wonderful.  I love the mixture of spices. Iadded the  chili powder at the very end so it wouldn't be to spicey for my kids. Does need salt, though, and we don't usually use much salt.

I followed the recipe but was disappointed with the result. It smelt great, but tasted bland (even with all the spices). Maybe it just needed a lot more salt or sugar, but I think next time I make curry, I'll use coconut milk, since that always seems to turn our well.

My husband and I both really enjoyed this.  I added a bit more chili than the recipe called for, because we like our curry really spicy, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  And the leftovers are great too!  We will definitely be making this regularly.

cardamom pods...CAREFUL, too much of these and it will taste like tree bark.  My Palestinian landlord loved it...took seconds.  I think he was just hungry and misses Palestine.

I don't know what I did wrong, but this was not good for us. I'm a huge curry fan, and I love tumeric when added in w/ other spices... but this was bitter and I felt the cilantro added a bad taste (didn't compliment the dish)

This was tasty, but too dry for our preference. Also, it seemed work intensive, but that is likely from the fact that essentially the cook is putting together a curry blend. I did not have rice or flat bread on hand, so heated some leftover spaghetti with garlic as the supporting starch.

I have never had curry (or any type of Indian/Middle Eastern food really), but I made this tonight and I LOVED it!  I chopped the tomatoes instead of slicing them, and I cut the onions in half and sliced them that way.  Also, I could not find cardamom pods, so I used 1/2 tsp of ground cardamom.  Also, I served it over minute rice since we were out of basmati.  It was great!  My husband loved it.

This was time intensive, but very tasty.  I was hoping for more of a curry flavor that you get with curry powder, but I still liked it.  The only thing I didn't understand was the amount of water it called for, I wound up having to use at least 1/2 cup.  I also added sliced carrots and served over basmati rice.  I would make it again!

This did not turn out for me at all.  The turmeric was too pungent, maybe I had it too long in the cupboard as I usually just use curry powder.  I will not do this again and though it was edible, not enjoyable.

I added a tin of coconut milk and cooked in the crock pot on slow for 6 hours.

Came out great with lots of sauce.

So flavorful! I usually serve it with seasoned rice(of course, seasoned with spices from the recipe), and the browned onion on top. Delicious!

I made this one first and enjoyed it though I didn't have all the ingredients on hand. Nevertheless, it turned out quite well except it wasn't as spicy as it should have been. I will make this again.

I used a frozen cube of tomato sauce as tomatoes are not pleasant at this time of year. I threw on a handful of green pepper on top. next time i will use more. It is an easy if a bit time consuming recipe. It is easily adaptable to adding vegetables. Much better than a packaged curry powder.

We added a little cayenne pepper, used ground cardamom rather than pods, used ground cloves rather than whole ,and used regular butter instead of ghee.  Other than that, I think we stuck to the recipe.  Served over jasmine rice - it was so yummy!  Definitely a keeper and will make again!
