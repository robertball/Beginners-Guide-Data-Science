This was really good! Definently a company meal.  I served it over buttered lingunie and it made a beautful presentation.  There were 4 scallops per person and it was very filling.  I made a special trip to our asian grocery store for some of the ingredients.  You could go a bit lighter on the mayonaisse on the scallops, but it was good to mix with the noodles.  Also if you don't like spice don't be afraid to still use the right amount of chili garlic sauce.  I am the biggest wuss abou spicy food and it wasn't spicy at all. The flavor was really nice.  One note: I did have to cook the mushrooms for longer than the recipe said, but maybe mine were bigger.  Thanks for a delicious and unique dinner!

Oh my goodness. Pure bliss. Without a doubt the best recipe I have made from this site. It's simple, it's five-star restaurant quality, and it's definitely company-worthy. I call that a home run! I used leftover scallops from a dinner out the night before (talk about cost-effective), and the ONLY change I made to the recipe was to quarter the scallops for presentation and I served over linguine that I tossed with about 1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan (to add weight to the pasta). Other than that, no alterations necessary, and well worth the trip to the Asian market to find my new best friend -- Japanese mayonnaise!

Followed the recipe as is. Amazing! And presentation was excellent too! Reminded me of Hotate-Hokkaiyaki from Japanese restaurants. Think next time I will add fish roe to give it the crunchiness of Hotate-Hokkaiyaki. =)

This is a fantastic recipe followed to a tee and could also be modified for individual tastes. Too much chili-garlic will take away from the taste of both the scallops and the mushroom. Thanks for sharing !!

This was delicious!  I substituted chives instead of green onions and served alongside grilled veggies and garlic mashed potatoes.  Succulent textures abound.

This was eye rolling, groaning good!! It is definately a must try! I think this rates 8 stars. The sauce tastes just like the sauce they serve over the mussels at my favorite Chinese restaurant. The family REALLY loved it! Thanks for the recipe! * * I'm thinking next time I'll use baby bellas and put one big sea scallop atop each mushroom, like appetizers ;)

Yum, yum!! I made this served on a bed of linguine, and it was delicious. Well-worth the trip to the Asian market. The topping tastes just like the topping on one of my favorite sushi rolls. This would make a great party appetizer with mini Portobello mushrooms.  I used the inexpensive, frozen "mini" scallops, and 1 lb. (4, 4oz. bags) was just the right amount to cover the mushroom caps. Thanks for the fantastic recipe, Angie!

This was a great new way to incorporate scallops into a meal besides broiling. I enjoyed it, my husband raved about it. It definitely made us a special Valentine's Day meal.

Made this tonight and it was great. Definitely do not need 2 pounds of scallops with 4 mushroom caps. Couldn't find the Japanese mayo, so I found a simple recipe and made my own. Also added cayenne pepper to scallops and some shredded parmesan cheese on top. Definitely can adjust the recipe to suit individual tastes.

Wow. Just Wow. Like someone said, I didn't have access to Japanesse Mayo. So I used hellmans mayo, chili sauce, and Tuong ot sriracha. Teaspoon of chili sauce and the sriracha to your liking. I ended up using two teaspoons. 

Made the recepie as it says. Served it over parmesan linquini with spinach. I actually ended up mixing the linquini with the remainder of the sauce that I made and my oh my that was great.

This is a sloppy and poorly put together dish. Ingredients have potential but the flavor is overwhelmed by the mayo plus it's missing something..... Im not going to eat this again.

Are you kidding me.  Heinz Chili Sauce.  What an abomination.  I followed the recipe and it would have been good but at this point I questioned your judgement but followed the recipe anyway.  Awful - the tomato chili sauce ruined this.

This was rather good but I don't know that I would like it "alone"...which doesn't really matter because I will always serve it the way I did this time with Onion Pasta from this site.  The two combined were delicious.  I found it much easier to soften the mushroom caps in a 400 degree oven for about 10 minutes.  It is the way I have always done it and when I started them on the stove I just thought to myself, why am I doing this.  It really is a personal preference.  I also added more chili sauce, about a teaspoon and it still wasn't too spicy.  Before going in the oven I threw on some parmesan for good measure...it never hurts anything in my world.  Absolutely beautiful presentation!!  Thank you for the recipe.  It was worth the trip to the asian market for the Kewpie Mayo.

This is DELICIOUS. I couldn't find Japanese mayo so I made a spicy sriracha/mayo mix to use instead as was suggested by another review. Worked fine. Small mushroom caps are perfect for appetizers.

Outstanding. Made the recipe for two and borrowed the Japanese mayo from my new granddaughter who was raised in Japan. Will absolutely make this dish for company.

Delicious recipe!  This is a keeper, and it is good enough for a special occasion.  I don’t understand the very low ratings from those who referred to Heinz bottled chili sauce or from those who said it was poorly put together.  I found it incredible, and I saw no reference to anything from Heinz.  As others have done, I used Srirachi chili sauce.  For those who do not appreciate a spicy flavor, be sure to use it sparingly, because even a little makes it surprisingly spicy.  I liked it, but I have lived in Sichuan and am used to much heavier spices.  I have used Kewpie mayo while in Japan, but I found that U.S. mayo with a bit of (liquid) sushi seasoning sauce (which is basically rice wine, with sweetener and a few spices) was a fine substitute.  My Japanese wife and I both gave this recipe five stars.  As an aside, my only serious detour from the recipe as written was to add freshly grated Romano cheese, which complemented the other flavors nicely.  I recommend not cooking the scallops as long as recommended.  Scallops, like shrimp, are perfect when barely done.  Any more cooking toughens them, changing the texture significantly.  Sautéing them until they are browned and then cooking them even longer under the broiler is far too long.
