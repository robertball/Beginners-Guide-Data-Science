I have made this several times in the last year.   It is delicious and so simple to make.   It goes really well with strawberries and pineapple but can be used with any fruit you like.  Everyone loves it.  I am always asked for the recipe.  I often fold in the entire tub of cool whip rather than  trouble with decorating the top.

I'm so excited!  Can you believe 50 years ago when my daughter was in first grade, one of the mothers brought a fruit dip to the school that was awesome.  She called "The Best Fruit Dip" and said it contained Coco Lopez.  I've been looking for it on and off for the past 50 years and I think this must be it!  Can't wait to try it.  The other Mom claimed to have lost the recipe.

Took a risk making this, because it only had one review.  But I thought the coconut would go great with the fresh pineapple I was serving.  Like a pina colada dip.  This is not fancy and uses processed ingredients, but it was so easy, a little different with the coconut, and it was perfect to bring to a party.  Everyone loved it.
