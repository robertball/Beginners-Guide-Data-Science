Love this!  It whips up amazingly creamy.  I use skim milk and Splenda ( still whips fine) and then a little creamer

I make a very similar whipped lattte. The ratio of instant coffee to water to sugar is slightly different. I prefer my version, but then again it's my version. Thanks for sharing your version.

I have made this over and over now. I don't use boiling water, just regular tap water. I use Nescafe Rich French Vanilla instant coffee. I also double the batch so I can share it with my daughter. I put ice in a glass and pour over skim milk! So yummy!

It tasted delicious, and was easy to make, except the frothing part. Because I did it by hand, it took a lot longer to froth, than to use a hand mixer. I would definitely make this again :-)

I have made this twice now and I  liked the second time better where I  cut back on my coffee granules to 1 tablespoon and added ice to my cold milk before spooning sweet coffee mix on top. 
Either way... this is a fabulous drink...just my personal preference- a little less strong and the milk is super cold.

It was so good! I made with 1/2 cup 2% milk and 1/2 cup of half and half or whatever I have at home. It was fun to make and yummy!

This is awesome!!! It tastes divine. I accidentally used normal water instead of boiling water. I thought that it wouldn't work but however it worked great and didn't make a difference.

I made this by placing the hot water, sugar and instant espresso in my VAVA milk frother.  Worked perfectly.  Tasted great.

My husband and I loved it! I made it exactly as the recipe was written but there are SO MANY possibilities, I’m sure we’ll make this a lot in the future with many different twists!

The coffee mixture whipped up perfectly with a handheld electric mixer. It made a lot, so I'll try halving it next time (1:1:1 ratio). I like it over coconut milk!

So good! I use it to top oat milk over ice — or on particularly slow afternoons, iced espresso.
