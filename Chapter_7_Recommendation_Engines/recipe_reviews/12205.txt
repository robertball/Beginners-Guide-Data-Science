I just finished making this recipe, and boy was it good! I did tweak the recipe a little though, based on previous reviews I took their advice to come up with something relatively similar.  Instead of the ingredients listed above, I used 3 Granny Smith Apples, ¾ cup of all purpose flour, ½ cup white sugar, ¼ cup rolled oats, ½ cup brown sugar, 1 tablespoon baking powder, 1 egg, 2 teaspoons of cinnamon, and 1 tablespoon of melted butter. Like the recipe says, I first mixed together the flour, white sugar, egg, and baking powder; only I found the mixture to be a little too dry so I added some water. Then I sliced the apples (I left the skin on and you couldn’t even tell they were there) and mixed them with 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. After that I greased an 8x8 pan and spread the apples evenly around the pan. After the apples were in place, I spread the “cornmeal” mixture on the apples and then topped it with a mixture of 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, the brown sugar, and rolled oats. Finally I topped the whole thing with the melted butter. The pie tasted DELICIOUS!! And it was indeed low-fat. I think I may have used slightly too much cinnamon but other than that it was GREAT! Thanks for the recipe, it was so easy!! I will definitely make it again!!

Most apple crisp recipes seem to have as much fat as chocolate cake- I'd rather have the chocolate cake! This one is low-fat and delicious! The topping came out very crunchy- just what I was hoping for. I changed the recipe a bit by using 1/4 c. oats and 3/4 c. flour, as another reviewer suggested. I also used half brown sugar and half white sugar because I like the flavor of brown sugar. I didn't feel that cinnamon flavor was too strong.

I thought this tasted really good! I only used 4 large apples and I had plenty..I used 3/4 cup of flour and 1/4 cup old fashioned oats.  Mine didn't really have a "crust" per se, but there were bits and chunks of it which was very crispy and crunchy..loved it.  The best part of it was that it was low-fat and healthy for you.  I even left the skin on the apples for more nutrients and fiber.  Next time I may use all 8 large apples, use a 9 x 13 pan and increase the topping by at least 1 1/2.  A KEEPER!

THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST APPLE CRISP I'VE EVER HAD! THE TOPPING IS SO CRISPY, EVEN AFTER A FEW DAYS IN THE FRIDGE (IF IT LASTS THAT LONG!) SO FAST & SIMPLE TO MAKE. MY ENTIRE FAMILY LOVES IT! I'VE NEVER MADE OR HAD AN APPLE CRISP, THAT HAD SUCH A CRISPY TOPPING LIKE THIS ONE. TRULY THE BEST! -SANDRA

I've looked for a VERY long time for an apple crisp recipe with a crunchy, almost hard crust like we used to get in the school cafeteria.  This one comes close.  We like it a lot.  I used Honeycrisp apples and they were a bit sweet so I cut down on the sugar and also cut the cinnamon in half since we don't like a strong cinnamon flavor.  Excellent!

So delicious!  I only ended up using about 5 small-medium sized Royal Gala apples since that was all that I had to use up.  It all fit nicely in a 9x9 square baking pan (it was of medium thickness-- not too thick).  I left the peels on the apples, as suggested by another reviewer.   The only other changes I would make next time are to use brown sugar instead of white for the topping b/c I think it would be even more attractive.  I would also not hesitate to mix the flour mixture into the apples, rather than just spread it on the very top.  My husband helped me to make the flour mixture & had accidentally mixed some of it into the apples before he re-read the directions.  We served the apple crisp with Blue Bunny's cinnamon ice cream (a limited flavor for the fall/winter) to accent the spice in the crisp.  The combination was marvelous & was not too sweet at all!  Leftovers tasted even better the next day after being warmed in the microwave.  Thanks so much for a great recipe!

This was very tasty. Everyone liked it. I would have liked it better if the cinnamon was mixed in witht the crumb topping and not sprinkled on top. It gave the appearance of being burnt. Overall, very good though.

This is by far the best apple crisp...I do not like the recipes that use rolled oats for the topping. The topping on this is so crunchy and the apple are very sweet. I did tweak the apples a bit by adding nutmeg, ginger and flour to make the apple have a syrupy consistency. Will make this again. I doubled the recipe and made it in a 9x13 pan.

I thought this was great.  I had a lot of pears, so I was looking for an easy way to use them up.  I did not change anything on the topping and I thought it was absolutely perfect! Cooked up crispy, and sweet, and was delicious.  Thank you!!

I'll give it 5 stars.  It tasted great!  Uses ingredients I have on hand!  And it doesn't use a stick of butter like most recipes - due to that fact I will be more likely to make it more often.  I think the addition of the egg is a brilliant way to get such a crispy crust..  I generally like oats in my topping but I didn't miss them here.  I used granny smith apples.  Oh one more comment.  I thought it was a good topping to fruit ratio - not too much and not too little.  THANKS!

This was a wonderful recipe.  However it did not specify what type of apples to use.  I used Braeburn because they were on sale and it only took four apples, not eight, and the pan was very full.  So I just made a double batch of the topping, put it in two 8 by 8s and it was delicious!

Very yummy! I was unsure how a fruit crisp with so little butter would be ( I usually use a whole stick of butter just in the topping!) but am trying to cut back and this sounded sensible.

The topping sounded unusual to me, but turned out great! I liked how crunchy it came out. 

I did add a little lemon juice but that's what I always do with a crisp. Thank you for this new apple crisp addition to my recipes!

A nice change from the oatmeal topped apple crisp I usually make.  I did reduce the flour to 3/4 C and add 1/4 cup oatmeal

So - my husband is not a big fan of baked apple recipes but he LOVED this one. I must have used really big apples 'cause 8 was way more than would fit into an 8x8 pan. So I made 50% more topping (using 1 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar) and baked in a larger pan. I also backed off the cinnamon using the prigianl amount instead of increasing it. The crispy topping really was crispy and SOOO good! Thanks for this recipe!

This recipe was okay, I made it because the ingredients where simple and I needed to use up some apples. As other users suggested, I would probably add oats if I decided to make this recipe again...and will try to mix with brown sugar. It was a little too sugary and starchy for what I'm used to in an apple crisp.

I really liked this recipe. I also did half brown sugar based on someone else's suggestion because I like it on my apple crisp. I think next time I will add a little more butter on top and even more sugar because we like ours gooey and crispy at the same time.

This is different than any other type of Apple Crisp that I've tried.  It's not a juicy dessert if that is what you are looking for but it's still very good.  My test-o-meter is my picky hubby and he thought it was a winner.  I will definitely make it again.

This isn't your traditional apple crisp, but it is very good and fairly healthy. First of all, only use 4-5 apples for an 8 inch dish, depending on the size of apple. You do not need 8 apples for an 8 in. dish!  As suggested by others, decrease the flour to 3/4 cup and add 1/4 cup of oats. I use 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. It definitely has a hard, crunchy top, but it tastes good. I suggest taking a knife and poking the surface of the topping to break it up.

I made it, but it did not come out very good.  The top was really hard, and it just tasted bland and eh.  Not making it again.

This was great!  Much better than the one I used to make, and lower fat than any I saw listed.  I took the advice of many who reviewed and cut the cinnamon down.  I used about 2 teaspoons.  I also used half white sugar and half brown sugar.  The topping was crunchy and wonderful!  However, mine did not fit an 8x8 pan and I had to use a bigger one.  Maybe because my apples were dry, I also had to add 1/4 cup of orange juice to moisten mine up a little at the end.  The flavor was great and everyone loved it.  Thanks, Sande.  I will definitely make this again and again.

Excellent apple crisp! I did add some oats and brown sugar to the topping though. But definitely better than my other recipe for apple crisp.

Very, very good!!! Wow! That'll be my pie and crust from now on! Only because I'd forgotten to add vanilla extract to my apples, I came up with idea to add it to melted butter on top! I think this is delicious. Must say I used 2 tbsp butter ;) Crust stays very crisp! LOVE THIS RECIPE!!

I took the recipe up to 48 servings. I had 30 apples to use and a crowd to feed. It was super easy, super fast, and DELICIOUS! I added extra cinnamon, but aside from that, I followed the recipe.   It is different from traditional crisps in that it doesn't have oats, but for a quick dessert it can't be beat.

12/21/04 Tried this Apple Crisp Recipe today!  It is the best crisp topping I have ever made.  Yes I will cut down on the cinnamon on top also.  This goes fantastic with some whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.  What a great dessert! Kudos!

Loved it. Made twice in one week. First time added 1/4 c. oats as suggested. Thought that the first layer of topping used a little too much sugar, although still good. Second time I used more oats (1/2 cup oats and 1/2 cup flour) and only 1/2 c. white sugar for topping. Substituted brown sugar for the white for the final topping.  Thanks Sande for this great recipe that I don't feel quite so guilty about eating.

Something went horribly horribly wrong with this recipie.  The "crumble" part didn't crumble at all.  Seems like it needed more butter or something...  Also, I probably should've cubed the apples.  Still debating if I should just throw the whole mess away, or if there's something I can do with it.

O.M.G. So good!

I needed to adapt the recipe a bit. I used 16 very small but sweet apples from the backyard and baked in a small rectangle stoneware so bigger than 8" square but not 9"X13". The amounts for the topping stayed the same. I did add a bit fresh Meyer Lemon to the apples while I was slicing to keep them from turning but that's the only thing I did different.  

It came out phenom! Will I make this again??? Absolutely!

I really liked this recipe.  This is the only crisp recipe I've tried, where the "crisp" part of the dessert, gets actually crisp, which I like!  I don't know if it has something to do w/ the egg or what, but I don't change a thing.

I made this today with 5 large apples - was too many for the size of the dish - 4 would be perfect.  Will make again because it tastes great, but next time, will mix the cinnamon in with the (brown instead of white) sugar and melted butter for the topping.  The top was crisp where there was melted butter drizzled, but not where it wasn't.  Thanks for a tasty recipe, Sande

I changed a lot for this recipe but it's great for beginners. I didn't add baking powder (ran out) and I added only 1/3 cup of flour and 2/3 cup of oats. I added about 3/4 cup only brought brown sugar and walnuts. I added about 3/4 tbsp cinnamon to the topping with an egg and mixed well before adding to apples. With the rest of the cinnamon, I just sprinkled it well over the apples (I had thrown the apples with cinnamon in the oven for about 12 min just to ensure they all baked well). I wish I had nutmeg to add but I loved it. Cinnamon flavour was strong.. Would only add 1 full tbsp next time.

My family really enjoyed this recipe, super easy to make and very yummy. I did change a few things, I used apple pie spice instead of just cinnamon and used Splenda to help cut back on the calories. Used Granny Smith apples which turned out to be a good choice, the only thing I noticed which I did not like was the apples didn't break down much and make a syrupy sauce. Might add a few more minutes to cook time or raise temp. Otherwise, a great desert! Ohhh don't forget the vanilla ice cream!!

Great recipe!  However, I used brown sugar for the topping and not white.  I also increased the measurement for the cinnamon and also added a bit of nutmeg.  Topped it with fresh whipped cream infused with vanilla.  Fantastic!

Delicious and so easy! We whipped this up last night in an effort to salvage a failed Apple Turnover attempt, and it was totally worth it. Perfect texture, crisp yet soft...we couldn't get enough! Might use less sugar next time, though.

I took this to a Halloween party today and it was a big hit!  I filled a 15x11 pan with apples (about 14?) and made the topping 1.5x the amount.  I also added in a bit (maybe 3/4 cup) of a multigrain flake and cluster cereal that we had as well as adding the cinnamon, some nutmeg and sprinkle of pumpkin pie spice to the topping mix.  I forgot to melt the butter for the top, so I just cut it in small pieces and dropped them on top before placing the whole thing in the oven.  The topping turned out so crunchy and delicious!  I served it on a dessert buffet so it was served cold, though I bet it would be even better warm with some ice cream!  I will definitely make this again!

This is a great apple crisp!  I added 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar as someone else had suggested.  I might cut down the sugar at the end that is sprinkled on top...came out very sweet!  Very good crumble!

Was googling apple filling and came across this yummy recipe. I made it with Gala apples, subsituted some flour with oats and to make topping a little more moist I added margarine to it and spread it accross top then drizzled more on top. It was a yummy hit with some very picky eaters.

Made the apple crisp according to the recipe and found it to be just alright; however, I would not serve it to guests.  (didn't love the crumb mixture) It tastes ok and is low fat, but I prefer a more traditional apple crisp.

The apples were really good, but the crust wasn't.  I'd cut down on the cinnimon and put brown sugar.

This recipe was very easy to make. I too would decrease the amount of cinnamon. All I used cinnamon sugar as a topping and it worked out great. Will make again soon

Delicious, and a big hit with my husband!   The topping was terrific and crunchy, and I'm so excited to finally have found a low-fat apple crisp recipe! I must have had large apples too, because I had to use an 11x13 pan to fit it -- and then I found that 1 Tbs of butter wasn't really enough to drizzle, so I sprayed the top with Pam to moisten before putting in the oven.  I used 1/4 cup of oats and 3/4 cup flour for the topping, which was terrific. Next time I might also try reducing the sugar in the topping to 3/4 cup, as it was a touch too sweet for my taste (although my husband said to keep it exactly as it is!).  I used brown sugar for the final topping, which gave it nice color, and I found that 45 mins was plenty long to bake it.  Helpful hint for mixing the egg into the flour: use a fork and it'll crumble evenly.  Thanks for the recipe!

This wasn't what I was expecting.  It was really heavy on the cinnamon and the top had a strong egg flavor.  I was disappointed in this recipe.

Overall the taste was good.  But I couldn't get the crispy crust everyone speaks of.  From the beginning, the crust was powdery and did not mix well with the apples.  The overall look was disappointing also.

This was my first try on something like this and I must say it was good. Especially if you like cinnamon. My dish could only hold about 7 sliced apples and I didn't use the full amount of the cinnamon/sugar sprinkle on top, eyeballed it I guess you could say, otherwise it seemed like it would have been too much. The crisp part was very good, a bit sweet but a great contrast to the apples. Served it with whipped cream, would be great with vanilla ice cream. Not to mention, overall, this was pretty darned easy! Yummy! Was a hit for our Thanksgiving dessert along side that traditional pumpkin pie. :)

Is this recipe a test or a joke? It is not very good and is very unbalanced. One tablespoon of baking powder is far too much.  One tablespoon of cinnamon is too much for 1/4 cup of sugar.  A tablespon of melted butter for the top is far too little. I will not use this recipe again.

I wasn't impressed with this recipe.  The filling was dry, and I think it would have been better with sugar and cinnamon mixed in with the apples.  I didn't care for the topping at all.   I found this topping heavy and hard rather than crisp and light.   I will not make this again.

I don't know how the author fits 8 apples in an 8x8 pan -- 5 filled it nicely for me. But this is very good. I added 2 tablespoons of butter to the crust mixture thinking maybe it would make it a little softer (because I'm OK with soft, and with butter). It was still really crunchy and I was dubious as I chipped through it to serve the crisp, but it added a delicious texture. I served it with "Southern Boiled Custard" poured over, and it was fantastic.

Was very easy and turned out ok.  Next time I might add some oats to the topping.  Also, might mix some of the topping down into the apples, too... so it's not just a layer of apples and a layer of topping.

Very tasty and simple dessert. Don't crumble the butter too fine, leaving it in pieces is what gives you the 'crunch'. Also super with fresh peaches too. Don't forget the vanilla ice cream!

I followed the recipe and it didn't turn out. The flour mixture just sat on the top of the apples. I added over a cup of (hot) water while baking and increased the temp and time and it turned out ok. I think there are better recipes out there.

I must admit that even though I have tasted quite a few apple crisp, this was my first time making one. I added soft butter to the apples along with the melted butter for the topping. And because I really wanted that extra crispy taste, i spinkled instant oats on the top. it was goog but next time I want to and nuts and raisins.

My boyfriend loves apple crisp so I made this for him as a surprise... and sure enough he was definitely surprised. This was amazingly easy to make (except for coring the apples since I don't own an apple corer). I am not the greatest fan of apple crisp, but I was loving it (especially topped with vanilla ice-cream). I would definitely do this again.

I have avoided crisp and cobblers before because of the doughy consistency.  This, however, was just right.  A bread/cake consistency and very flavorful.  My kids loved it!!  Very good with vanilla ice cream as well.

I think that the apples I used may not have been juicy enough for this recipe.  The crust never mixed in with the juice and ended up as just a dry, powdery topping (like before I even baked it)...there simply was no moisture to "bake" it into a crust.  It was ok but did not the crispy topping that I expected.

I used my own apple recipe but I have been looking for a really good crisp on top. I found it! This crisp is the absolute BEST!

This was delicious.  Very good warm out of the oven with a little milk on it.  Even better with icecream.

Most of these sorts of pastries rely on grease, butter or margerine. YUCK. 
Why not think of your family's health and use olive oil? The extra light version adds NO taste, works just like grease, butter or margerine, except in your veins.

A pleasant and uncomplicated treat. I advise preparing in a ceramic oven dish and serving with custard. Pairs well with coffee.

Delicious but super sweet. Actually too sweet. Made it a second time and reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup and increased the flour to 1 1/4 cups and it was more to our liking. We also used Almond flour as both my wife and us are gluten intolerant.

Very good recipe!!! I would recommend covering it with tin foil while baking so that the sugar won’t give it a burnt look.

I made this just to try it and boy oh boy was it a hit with my husband and kids. They now ask me to make it almost 8-10 times during the  fall/winter months. I also added a 1/4 cup quick oats for an extra crunch and added 1/4 cup of brown sugar instead of white for the topping. And in the mixture of dough I added 1table spoon of vanilla extract gives its a more savory taste. Although if you just make it as the recipe says it’s also very good. Enjoy!!

This recipe is easy to follow but you have to tweak it.  Next time I'm going to add 1/4 of a cup of butter (I use Smart Balance) and mix the apples with the dough mixture so that it mixes better.

Worse recipe I've ever made from ALLRECIPES.COM!
One egg this not enough for over 2 cups of dry ingredients. 1 1/2 tablespoons of cinnamon is way too much cinnamon for the volume of other ingredients.
I made the recipe to use up some extra gala apples and should have just thrown then away because I wound up throwing them and the other ingredients I used out because this was HORRIBLE!

It turned out really nice.  I have never used eggs before in my apple crisp but my family and I really enjoyed this.  Nice topping.  I would use all brown sugar and less of it in future.

We made it per this recipe. We used an apple corer-peeler-slicer from the 30's and processed 5# of apples in about 25 minutes.  They are smaller organic apples which is the size the peeler was intended for originally.  It also gave us fun time together, which is hard to make time for usually.

Tastes great!

Finally found a good recipe that doesn't call for oats, as my husband hates the texture. There was a nice mix of crunch, syrup, and mushiness. I always use multiple types of apples as each kind produces a different flavor and texture when baked.

This recipe was excellent! The only change I made was 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon mix on top drizzled with butter. I was surprised how good this came out considering the flour sugar mixture was overwhelming.  Loved it.

I doubled the amount of melted butter to drizzle over the top and added 1 tablespoon of brown sugar directly to the sliced apples with the cinnamon. It was delicious. Vanilla ice cream on top is best

Not only was this easy to make it was sooooooo good.  I could eat the whole thing myself.  As the other reviewers said 4 big apples are enough for the 8 inch pan.  This is a keeper.

I don't usually review, but I just have to say that this recipe is not very good. I made it according to the instructions and it came out horribly. The apples were dry and the topping was soggy and gross. Sorry, but it just wasn't good.

This was not at all what I expected. The overall appearance was not attractive. The egg/flour/sugar mixture was wet and runny.  the only thing that improved it was the addition of Ben and Jerry's ice cream on top. I know now to stick with the "Joy of Cooking" recipe.

I thought this recipe was great and my guests agreed...most went for seconds!  I used a combination of Granny Smith and Cortland apples and I added a little lemon juice when I was mixing the apples and cinnamon.  Very easy and very yummy!

It did indeed taste really amazing but nothing about it was crispy which was a complete let down.
I added some oats because I remember putting some in when I took cooking in high school, I think this added to it.

This recipe is super tasty!  I always double the amount of butter that I drizzle over the top, but it is awesome.  My husband LOVES this stuff and he doesn't usually eat sweets.  It's very easy and doesn't require a lot of ingredients.  I like it!

Easy and delicious, perfect for a cool fall evening!  We topped it with vanilla custard and my husband can't wait for me to make it again.

The family loved it!  I thought there was a bit too much cinnamon, so next time I will use a bit less and add a touch of sugar to coat the apples before putting on the topping.

The flour topping did not turn out at all. It was crunchy and tasteless. My husband and I did not like it and I will not make it again.
