This stir fry will be a staple in my family from now on!  I had to make a few changes out of necessity.  I didn't have the sherry, cornstarch, or red pepper on hand, so I just omitted the sherry, substituted flour for the cornstarch, added carrots cut into strips and vidalia onion....YUM!  I have kids ages 4 and 2 and they just inhaled the veggies with the stir fry sauce on them.  My 4 year old doesn't like veggies very much, but when I asked him which was his favorite in this recipe, he couldn't decide!  Grown ups and kids alike will love this one!

This was a good basic recipe.  I did make several changes.  I made a marinate for the meat (3T lite soy sauce, 3T rice wine vinegar, 1t garlic chili paste and ½ t minced fresh ginger).  The meat probably marinated for at least 15 minutes.  I stir-fried the broccoli as written in the recipe.  I then added 8oz. of fresh mushrooms and cooked for an additional minute or two.  I also doubled the sauce recipe, as recommended by others.  I didn’t have any sherry so I substituted rice wine vinegar, which worked well.  I added 1t garlic chili paste and another ½ t minced fresh ginger to the sauce recipe.  I didn’t have a grease problem with our meat, as other have written.  If you do marinate your meet (which I recommend for a lot of added flavor) please remember, this isn’t meant as a substitute for the sauce recipe.  We ate this over basmati rice.  The whole dish was ready in about 30 minutes.

This is the ideal recipe for folks who like a toned-down, blander version of Chinese food. 

I added about half a cup of thin onion strips to the veggies, which added some much-needed flavor. I would also suggest doubling the sauce recipe because this barely made enough sauce to cover the veggies and meat, so it was rather dry. 

Also, be sure after you’ve browned your meat and garlic to drain it! This should have been mentioned in the recipe because less experienced cooks might follow it word-for-word and end up with a greasy mess. 

Overall, this was an easy-to-make, hearty meal, but I’ll try for something with a little more zing next time.

This recipe was AWESOME! My husnand and I have been trying our own chinese recipes and this one tops them all. I did alter it a little bit though, I marinated the boneless chuck shoulder cut up, (thin) in 1/2 cup of the sherry, 1/4 cup of good soy sauce, a TBL ginger and a TBL cornstarch, I also added about a TBL of this awesome spice  from mickeysrubsandspices galled "great garlic pepper" If you love garlic check out that site, I met the guy at a street fair and these are all great spices, plus free shipping!  Anyways, I marinated it only for an hour but next time I will do overnight. Then we made the actual recipe the same just exactly doubled the sauce and added about 5 cloves of fresh garlic. Extra ginger too because I only had dry, not fresh. All and all, this recipe is great for the whole family and beats any take out restaurant! Thanks so much for the post.

I read so many reviews,  you all added something to make it more favorful. Recipe with ingredients listed, needs something for flavor. Sesame oil, onion, crushed peppers. Something for a bit more flavor, savory or spice.

I doubled the sauce and marinated the meat in sherry, soy, garlic and cornstarch (which makes the meat tender!).  I also added dried black mushrooms and the whole family loved it!

I gave this 4 stars because of the changes i made but i great starting point. First off, I did not have any peas on hand and i made this recipe much larger. I sliced a large onion, julienned some baby carrots and sliced red pepper. I doubled the sauce and used a bag of steamfresh broccoli which i added at the end. I also added a splash of the beef broth to the water for the rice. Next time, I will actually triple the sauce becuase i added so many more vegetables. I will also try rice wine vinegar as a previous reviewer had mentioned and also as mentioned you should drain the beef before adding the other ingredients. Overall, it was very good and will make this again.

This recipe is sooo easy and delicious!  I sub mirin (rice wine) for the sherry, and think that gives it a much more Asian flavor.  I also usually double the broccoli and up the garlic to 3 cloves, because otherwise I think its a little bland, and I garnish with toasted sesame seeds before serving.  I have also found that the amount of sauce is too low, so I usually add a little extra soy sauce and mirin, and sometimes a little water, as it begins to cook down.  I'm sure its just because of all the cornstarch, but for me, its not even close to enough sauce to cover all the veggies and meat.  I also agree with another reviewer that some onion would be a good addition.  (I haven't tried it that way yet though.)  But this is really delicious, and there are never any leftovers at our house!

This was a simple fast recipe that was delicious!  My husband really enjoyed it and my (2 yr old) daughter actually ate all of her vegtables.  Will definitely make again.

This time when I made this, I used the top round steak and added a little sesame oil. My boyfriend ate all of it! I didn't even get one bite. 

11/08 I made this again and next time i will definitely marinate the meat like other reviewers have done. The meat was very inexpensive resulting in a chewy texture but the flavor was great. This is a favorite.

Great substitution for our standard chicken stir-fry.  We usually overcook our vegetables so it was good to know how long to truly cook them.

So easy to make. I added fresh ginger and carrots and made extra sauce. I will marinade the meat first next time but I loved this recipe. Much cheaper than ordering out!! You can make it in 30 mins or less.

This was so good :) I followed everyone's advice and marinaded the sliced beef overnight in one portion of the sauce minus the cornstarch and sugar. I drained it before cooking and added 2 x times the sauce recipe as indicated since I increased the veggies. I added 1 tbs of Sesame oil. I left out the bell pepper and Pea pods then added a small sliced white onion to 3 cups of broccoli. My husband really liked it but thought it was missing a flavor you taste in a traditional asian restaurant. I would love to know what that is. Next time I will try it with the bell pepper, pea pods, bean sprouts and some zucchini.

Great Recipe!  Cutting the meat against the grain, thin strips, and marinating really helps to tenderize the meat.  I would definetly make again!

Very good. I doubled the sauce as mentioned previously.  I used a combination of vegetables that I had left over from a fresh veggie platter- broccoli, carrots, red pepper, and mushrooms.  I also added a sliced onion with the beef and garlic.

This recipe was soooooooooo GOOD!!  I wish I could give it more stars.  I didn't add the Sherry Cooking Wine because I didn't have any and didn't feel like buying it just for this recipe alone, I also used low sodium beef broth and low sodium soy sauce.  I added a ton of mushrooms and skipped the pea pods because we're not big fans of it, but you can pretty much add ANY vegetables to this recipe.  Also, I didn't double the sauce as others recommended but it's definitely a must because the beef and the veggies absorb it all.

Not very good. Hardly any flavor.  The veggies weren't too bad but the meat is really bland.  This recipe needs something more to satisfy.

This was pretty good.  I doubled the sauce as another reviewer had suggested and it was the perfect amount.  Next time I will add 1 Tbsp more soy sauce.

Very tasty, doubled the sauce as suggested and added a thinly sliced onion as well.  I also added red pepper flakes as I tend to like everything on the spicy side.  A great, quick dish with little mess!

Great tasting dish, although we would like the sauce to be thicker so we may change some things next time around to thicken it up.

This was not a "HIT" in our family. Very bland. Even with a top sirloin...what a waste of food. Unless you enjoy tasteless food, please, choose another recipe!

This recipe was excellent!!!  I mixed up the sauce ingredients but also added about a tablespoon of an Asian Peanut marinade.  Once all mixed I poured sauce on 1 Lb. of beef and let it marinade for about 3 hours.  It was a big hit with the entire family!

Really good, will probably make this again. Only change was that we made it as beef & broccoli since we did not have the other veggies on hand. The only reason it did not get 5 stars is because it just was not quite as good as the beef & broccoli you get at Chinese restaurants.
