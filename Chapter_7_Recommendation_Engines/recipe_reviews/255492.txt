I was unsure of how this was going to turn out (it started more soupy than I was expecting) but over the course of a couple-3 hours it thickened to a great consistency and even better taste!

Made this recipe today.  Came out great.  I omitted the spinach and added crumbles instead.  I also used Arrowroot the last hour of cooking as a thickener.  It worked great, and there is no taste to arrowroot.     It does make a large batch, so just a warning, you probably not be able to eat all of it at one sitting.

You could also use cornstarch or flour for a thickening, but I would recommend the cornstarch over the flour.  Actually arrowroot is best, because it is tasteless.

This chili has a lot of flavor!  However, the amount of chipotle powder was way too overpowering, even after I added more of all the other spices.  Also, the chili was a little more liquid-y than I'm used to, and I even drained/rinsed the cans of beans.  I would put the spinach in at the end next time because I did not like the texture of soggy spinach.  But overall, good with some sour cream to tamper the chipotle!
