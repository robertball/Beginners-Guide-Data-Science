Good basic recipe.  Recommend cut jicama in slivers (julienne), and lightly toast the slivered almonds in a frying pan.

This is fast, it's easy, and good but could benefit from protein like grilled chicken strips. I would reduce the amount of vinaigrette as well. The salad shouldn't be swimming in salad dressing.

I'm not a salad lover but I really like this recipe. It's quick and easy to make. I used apples instead of jicama and we added the vinaigrette according to taste.
