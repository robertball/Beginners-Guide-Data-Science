Delicious, moist banana bread! I baked mine in one 9x5 glass loaf pan, so if you're like me and only want one bread here's what I did.  I cut the topping in half.  For the batter, I used 1/2 c. white sugar & 1/2 c. brown sugar, kept  the same amount of butter, eggs, banana and vanilla.  I used 1/4 c. of buttermilk, 2 c. of flour, 1 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice, 1 tsp. of baking powder, added 1 tsp. of baking soda, 1/4 tsp. of cinnamon & 1/2 c. of walnuts.  The bread was done baking in a little over an hour and the topping was nice and crunchy.

This was the best banana bread ever!!!  I did use equal portions of white and brown sugar-because I like my crust more chewy.  I use a convection oven and only cooked it 1:05, but could have cooked it even less.  My picky kids even love it!

Very good banana bread. Great streusel. I LOVED that it made so much streusel, for I refrigerated the remaining and will be using it on future muffins & breads..will save a lot of time when I make any other breakfast bread/muffin recipe, & it stays fresh in the frig for a very long time!

This was really great! Whenever I have made bananna bread in the past it has always come out really heavy and to moist. This was a perfect recipe. I did use up some whole wheat flour that I had on hand and the rest white flour.  I also used 3 smaller loaf pans so they cooked in less time. Great recipe thanks sooo  much!!!

I made no changes to this recipe. I had some cinnamon roll instant oatmeal that I needed to use up, so this recipe was perfect. I just cut back a little on the pumpkin pie spice. The streusel topping was way too much, I ended up throwing almost half of it away. If I make this again, I will add a middle layer of streusel. Smells wonderful.

Just came out of the oven......smells awesome.......have to keep the kids/husband out of them so they can at least cool - unlike the blueberry lemon loaf.  
Ok, I snuck a piece.......awesome!  As good as it smells!

Good but the topping is so crumbly. I think next time I will try melting the butter. I just think it would stick together better that way.

Moist, sweet, very much like a banana muffin.  Changes: Sugared rather than floured pans 1 tsp salt in batter White whole wheat flour in place of white 4 bananas (because of using whole wheat flour) Baked 52 minutes using heavyweight anodized aluminum bread pans.

I had already started making my banana bread using a different recipe when I found this one, but I borrowed the streusel topping idea and it was great! I don't think I'll ever make banana bread or banana muffins without it again!

Try adding 8oz of canned tuna, drained of course, what a fancy way to impress your family and friends!

Bread was just okay and we did not like the topping.  Disappointed because we want to increase oats in our diet.
