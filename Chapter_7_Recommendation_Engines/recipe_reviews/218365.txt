I've been making Waikiki Meatballs for years.  The recipe was originally published in a Betty Crocker cookbook in the 1970's, and has always been a family favorite recipe.  Make exactly as printed - it's perfect!

I have loved this recipe for years. Never thought about putting it in the crock pot, but it works for soccer practice night :) the original recipe calls for 1/4 teaspoon ginger for the meat balls and 1 tablespoon soy sauce for the sauce. I highly recommend adding that to what is written here.

This sauce is delicious!  I made it exactly as is. However, I did not put it on meatballs - I baked boneless/skinless chicken breasts with this sauce poured on top of them.  After reading a blog of another fellow "AR Peep" who had made this and commented it would go well on just about anything, I knew I had to try it.  I believe next time I make this I will have pheasant. Hubby said pork would be great as well.  Thanks for a great sauce!

What a terrific change-up over the usual Italian or BBQ meatball recipes. Where has this been all my life? I made it on the stovetop tonight (baked meatballs and simmered them in the sauce while rice cooked) and was rewarded with smiles all around. Only one change, red pepper for green, because that's how we roll. I used apple cider vinegar because the recipe didn't specify and it just seemed right with the other sauce ingredients. It was a good choice, adding another layer of flavor to a simple, but so very tasty dish. I usually think of ways to improve a recipe as I'm eating it, but with this I was thinking of variations, like adding soy sauce to make it teriyaki, or a little cayenne to give it a kick. I would definitely use the sauce baked over chicken breasts, too. With less cornstarch it would make an island-inspired stir-fry. And it would be so good with pork tenderloin. Oh, the possibilities... The meatballs were delish, too, and such a solid simple recipe that, like the sauce, there are many possible variations, by adding different spices. I made gluten free breadcrumbs in the food processor and they worked perfectly. Next time (and there WILL be one) I might use crushed pineapple so I get a little pineapple in every bite, but that's just a matter of personal taste. This really is a very good recipe. Thank you, Sammie, for adding 2 new guns to my kitchen arsenal. You rock!

These were AMAZING.  I used two 1.5 lb bags of frozen meatballs, doubled the measurements for all other ingredients, and set the slow cooker for 4 hours on high.  I'm sure fresh meatballs can be cooked on low but I wanted to play it safe since I was using frozen and they were absolutely perfect.

I read somewhere you should wet your hands with water before rolling the meatballs.  Surprisingly, it works really well at preventing meat mixture from sticking to your hands.

I got this recipe from the the recipe card club back in the 70's Anyone else remember the yellow plastic box and you got one set of cards per month. This is still my kids meal of choice and they are in their 30's and 40 now. I never put it in the crock pot. I think the meatballs would get too done. Serve over white rice.

We liked this sauce but it was a bit too sour for us, maybe less vinegar.  We didn't put it in the crock pot just over top ready made meatballs as we were short for time.

I've made these for years. I use not only the pineapple juice but the cherry juice as well.  We like a lot of sauce with the meatballs and rice. I like to make a thicker sauce as well and put a bit more cornstarch in. I also add canned lychees if I can find them.

Delicious!  This is a very easy recipe to prepare.  I served it over rice as a main dish.  It would also make a delightful appetizer.  We loved the sweet/sour sauce combination.  I used a top  grade ground chuck.  Now, it is no longer a faceless recipe as I made it for the Allstar South Region January activity.

The recipe didn't specify but I think I should have used canned pineapple in syrup instead of its natural juice. It wasn't sweet enough so had to add extra brown sugar. It was OK with meatballs but I think the sauce would be better used for a sweet & sour chicken recipe.

I used ground turkey instead of beef and it turned out fabulous.  Definitely a keeper. And definitely will make again.

I made it with 50% lean ground beef and 50% ground Peppered Bacon.  I baked the meat balls on the treager at 300 degrees for 30 minutes while I made the sauce then simmered the meatballs for 30 min.  Served over jasmine rice.  Yummy

So good!  The meatballs were delicious!  The sauce was just a little too sweet for me, but that may be because I used crushed pineapple rather than chunks.

Very good! Hubby and I enjoyed it over white rice, and thought that browning the meatballs before adding them to the sauce added lots of flavor. Will keep fixing this for sure! It keeps very well in the fridge and seems to improve in flavor the 2nd and 3rd days.

The meatballs had a nice texture but were bland. Next time, I will add some ground ginger, garlic, and hot pepper flakes. That should solve the problem. The sauce was well balanced, however.

Excellent! I followed the directions closely. I made mine in a deep frying pan because I like meatballs to be browned. Made the sauce in a separate pan and then poured it over the meatballs. Cooked it with the cover on the pan.  I also added 1/4 tsp. powdered ginger to the meatballs and about 1 T. soy sauce to the brown sugar and corn starch sauce.  I made some brown rice to go with this and served it as an entrée. I also used part red wine vinegar and part apple cider vinegar. I added the juice from a 15 ounce can of pineapple chunks. I did not think it was too sweet. I thought it was perfect.  Next time I make this I will serve it with steamed broccoli, and some chinese vegetables. And I may toss in some green onion slices.  I really enjoyed it. I'm looking forward to eating the leftovers.

These were a hit as appetizers.  I used ready made, frozen,  all beef meatballs, added a bit of ginger and soy sauce to the pineapple sauce, and simmered everything in the crockpot on low for 4 hours.

I have been making this very same recipe for over 40 years.  It was received in a cookbook from military wives that was a wedding present.  I also now use plain frozen meatballs and often add red, yellow, or orange sweet peppers for additional color.  I also add either chives or finely sliced green (spring) onions when serving.  It makes great leftovers.

IT was really good, family loved it.  Meatballs could have had more spices but I guess I could have always added in.  Also recipe could have stated better maybe as to what size to make the meatballs --apps or entree and larger ones I think would affect the cooking time.   but very tasty all in all and kinda easy

Thanks for posting! This recipe is a classic and I remember making these back in the 70's.  I like to saute the pineapples so they start to brown before adding them  to the sauce.  The recipe is a great balance of sweet and sour and  with pre-made frozen meatballs, preparation is quick and easy.

It's obvious that this recipe was from the 70's. No taste  worth bragging about . I am going to make again and update the recipe. This was probably really good to people back in the 70's when cooking and spices weren't a big thing like today. Sorry Betty Crocker!!

One thing I would change is the amount of liquid,  as it is now the liquid  gets too thick  while in slow cooker.  I would increase liquid by a few ounces or decrease cornstarch by 1 tablespoon.  Other than an excellent recipe.

I used 1 lb beef and 1/2 lb veal.  The sauce was very well loved in our house, I'm always looking for a more tender meatball.

Easy, but unexciting. I made it as written and it could have used a bit of red pepper flakes. I'd rather have barbecued meatballs, so probably won't make again.

Meatballs were great.  The sauce was way to sweet for my family.  Will try again but cut down on the sweetness in the future.

This is a great favorite at our parties. Most people I know just put BBQ sauce on them. I love the sweet & sour more. Great sauce, worth making.

Quite tasty. Hubby loved it. Great addition to the dinner rotation. I left out the peppers because I am not a fan of bell peppers. Rather than a slow cooker, I placed in a casserole dish, covered with foil, and baked at ~200 for 2.5 hours. Will be making this again.

Tasted great!!!  Doubled the recipe and added 1 tsp garlic powder.
Cooked the meatballs on a pellet smoker with hickory pellets for 1 hour at 275°.  Everything else was done as written.  Even though the type of vinegar is not specified, my choice is rice vinegar.  But between the choices of white or apple cider vinegar, I would use white since it adds to the sweet and sour taste of the sauce.

Yum! For vinegar, used apple cider vinegar.  Made 17 medium meatballs. Preheat time was about perfect for mixing although I still needed to quickly roll the balls. Bake time was perfect for tidying up then making sauce -- I think sauce came together in about 10 minutes. Started late so sat in slow cooker only 2.5 hours; didn't seem to be a problem.

I can see how people would like this but it wasn't for me.  Not a big fan of the pineapple flavor.

Made it as written the first time which was very good, then I made a few changes  for my seconded time. Used 2 lbs. ground beef 1 lb. pork sausage & added a pinch of Chinese 5-spice 2 garlic cloves minced. For the sauce I used a whole red & green bell peppers, red onion & 2 stalks of celery all chopped and sautéed . Made it a bit better.
Thanks

Couldn't wait the 5 hours of slow cooker so I put it in a pan at low and let it seamer for 3h. The balls were rock solid and dry. After putting the mixture in the fridge the sauce solidify.
I could appreciate the flavors but the texture wasn't interesting at all. I might try it one more time in the slow cooker and change my review after.

Delicious!  The only change I made was using 1 lb ground beef and 1/2 lb ground venison because I'm trying to get some ground venison used up.  Will make again.  Second time I used just 2 Tbsp brown sugar.  Will try 1 Tbsp next time since pineapple juice is sweet on its own.

I think this is stood recipe and very easy. It was a little sweet for my taste. I liked it enough that I think I would try it again with less brown sugar.

Good recipe if it is an appetizer.  If you want to serve it as a main course, (served over rice) I'd make a few alterations.  I added a small amount of low-sodium soy, then grated in some fresh ginger, some garlic, and some sesame seeds.  I had a bottle of Asian sweet/sour sauce in the frig that I added in as well.  My slow cooker is the kind that you can brown and saute in as well, so I browned the meatballs, then added the sauce called for in the recipe, then the green peppers and pineapple, but it was obvious there would not be enough sauce to put over rice, and I thought it could be enhanced with the additional Asian ingredients.  Worked out well.

I made this for a fourth of July Hawaiian themed pool party.  I used pre-made meatballs from Costco and followed the remainder of the recipe, tripling the amounts to accommodate the greater number of meatballs and crowd I was feeding.  (about 40) These were a huge hit, with folks raving about how good they were.  Even my two year old nephew couldn't stop asking for more meatballs.   Unfortunately, I didn't get to try the recipe, as they were all gone by the time I stopped to try one! Will definitely make again.

the only change I made was to add some of Trader Joe's sweet chili sauce. I didn't have enough cornstarch, so I used this to help thicken the sauce.  I did like the sauce  as written though.

I mixed in half a pound of ground turkey with the beef since I didn't have quite enough beef.  I would make it entirely from beef next time.  I also thought there was not quite enough sauce.  Other than that, the flavor was very good.  My family has requested I make it again in the future.

These are very good. I made minor additions to the meatball mixture: two cloves of minced garlic and extra milk. and, because I like bell pepper, doubled the recipe amount to 2/3 cup.

Very tasty and easy recipe.  I would like a bit more distinction between the sweet and sour mix  but not sure how to achieve that.  I also will add some  "kick" to the recipe with cayenne pepper next time.  My wife an I enjoyed the change and I will be making this often.

Delicious! I don't usually like to  change and then rate it, but I did add a bit of ginger to meatballs, and added soy sauce to sauce  as called for in the Waikiki meatball recipe,  also from this site.  This recipe was a hit, and will make again soon with smaller meatballs and serve  as an appetizer.

Easy and tasty - served with Jasmine rice for a Hawaiian themed party, and used Ikea meatballs.  Substituted apple cider vinegar for vinegar with no problems.

I made this for a wine appetizer party and they were gone in five minutes.  I definitely recommend making your own meatballs versus using frozen prepared.  This makes all the difference and it's worth the effort.  A great recipe that I will definitely make again.  I know I have a hit when people ask for the recipe and I got a lot of requests for this one.

Made this because it appeared to be similar to a jarred baking sauce that we used to buy when we were first married back in the late 70s and early 80s. (I think it was called something like Le Sauce).  Used the sauce over 4 chicken thighs baked for 40 minutes at 350 degrees F in a 9" square corning ware baking dish.  Cut the sugar in half and it was very much like the old jarred sauce. My wife loved it served over rice.

Meatballs seemed bland. I think they needed some ginger or soy sauce to give it some added flavor. As they were,  it was like eating a hamburger with sweet and sour sauce.  My husband and I liked the sauce much better.

Doesn't really say how big to make your meatballs.  I made mine about 2 inches which was too big to get sauce with each bite.  Made as described but doubled the peppers (stamp size squares of both red and green), added 1 tbls ground ginger and 2 tbls soy sauce while in the cooker.  Ate with Chinese mustard on the side.

This was great! Nice for a change. The whole family enjoyed it. I used a larger can of the pineapples for more sauce and it was just enough to go around. Delicious!

Delicious, I used a pork/beef blend, and added ground ginger and soy sauce to the meatball. The family raved at how good it was, served over jasmine rice.

The meatballs and sauce were really bland. I doubled the sauce and added soy sauce, salt, onion, and yellow pepper. After three hours in the slow cooker the vegetables were still not soft so I transferred it to a big pot and simmered it on the stove for 45 minutes. Served with hot rice. This meal was just okay.

These are my family's favorite meatballs.  I  double the recipe for the meatballs & triple the recipe for the sauce.  I add an extra small can of pineapple juice for the sauce and serve them over rice.  These are a must have for the holidays.  I use a cookie scoop to make the meatballs.

I've been making these as appetizers for years.  All of my kids and grandchildren love them and are disappointed if they aren't on the menu at family dinners.  I often use the frozen pre-made meatballs and find them to be just as good and they don't take long to cook.

I haven't tried this recipe, but by looking at the ingredients, it's very similar to a recipe I already have except I also put about 1/3 cup or so (if not more) of soy sauce. OMG I love this dish. sweet and sour meatballs are amazing
