Made this for the weekly office meeting. Decided to forgo the frosting & just top with powdered sugar. It was GREAT!

My family has used a frosting similar to this for decades, only we omit the cream cheese. I have followed this cake recipe many times now and it is always a crowd favorite! I get so many complements. I usually have the frosting in a bowl next to the cake and I usually have to tell people that they are supposed to put a dollop onto their cake. For that reason, when I make this next week for a potluck, I am going to just frost the cake ahead of time! I really recommend following his recipe, no need to change anything, itâ€™s perfect!!!!
