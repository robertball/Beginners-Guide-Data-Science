This was good but not quite as good as it sounded. The flavor of the marinade and the sauce was delicious, but the peas were hard to work with. The coating was so thick that the tuna didn't cook fast enough (and I was going for rare), so the peas just ended up burning--which wouldn't have been so bad, except then the wasabi taste was lost. Maybe I misunderstood the recipe--"crushed" to me means there are still some chunks in the mix. I think it would have been better to toss the peas into a food processor and grind them to a bread-crumb texture. I'll try it that way next time.

I thought this recipe was delicious!  There are only 2 of us, so I cut the recipe in half.  Even with only 1/2 pound of wasabi peas, there were a lot left over.  Next time I will only buy 1/4 of a pound. (I can buy them in bulk at a local market)  I used a food processor to crush the peas. I had a hard time with the coating; a lot of it stuck to the pan, and some of it burned.  Luckily my husband likes that burnt flavor.  After the steaks were cooked, I sprinkled some of the unused crushed peas over the steaks to bring back some of that wasabi kick.  The sauce was delicious. I didn't have any saki, so I used Chinese rice wine. This was all-in-all a terrific way to cook tuna.  My husband loved it.  He has spent some time in Japan and really enjoyed the flavors. I will definately make this again.

the sauce and marinade was *great*.  I used wasabi paste instead of the peas, based on other reviews of burning and such.  I still had some burning, but I think I just need to adjust the recipe a bit.

I used a pestle and mortar to thoroughly crush up the peas, but they gave the tuna an off-putting gritty texture. The wasabi flavor was also lacking - I wish I had whisked some wasabi paste into the marinade. Oh well, thanks anyway.

Great use of the wasabi peas.  My husband loved the flavors in the marinade and the spice of the wasabi.  Great way to prepare tuna steaks!!  Congrats on being a finalist!

I think the flavor of this would have been really good, but the "crust" burned and quite frankly, burned wasabi just doesn't taste good.  I also managed to overcook the tuna, but that's not the recipe's fault - it's mine.  I will try this again though, because we love both tuna and wasabi around here.  When I try again, I'll use wasabi paste you can buy in a tube from the store and use it as a glaze.

I enjoyed the recipe but I found that the wasabi peas didn't have all that much kick to start with.  So I wouldn't blame the lack of kick on the recipe.  Some way of adding additional wasabi to the pea mixture would be good.

These were not as good as I had hoped. I took the advice of others and ground the wasabi peas in the food processor. And instead of breading the tuna with the crumbs, I just sprinkled some on the top instead of baking. Even though I ground them, there were a few pea chunks that were like little pieces of gravel when you bit into them. I also didn't care for the flavor of the marinade, and it's due to the Chinese 5 spice powder. The cinnamon in the powder is overpowering for the tuna, in my opinion. I love tuna, but next time I will stick to the sesame seed coated method. It's always fun trying new things, though, and we still ate these tuna steaks. But we won't make them this way again.

Wonderful! Our mouths were on fire,and we kept going back for more! I didn't have any 5spice powder, nor did I know what it was, so I mixed together cayenne pepper, garlic powder, cilantro, a little curry and a little cumin. I didn't have any tamari either.  Turned out super hot, but REALLY good! I served it with a rice and spinach salad.

Quick note: I left out the brown sugar. People were saying that their crust was burning. I suspected that may be due to the sugar. Mine did not burn at all.

This is delicious, it did not burn as some people remarked.  The recipe has erred in saying one pound of the peas.  You only need one package, or about 3 oz.!  I added more wasabi paste to the marinade after I cooked it.

I made this for dinner this evening, sized down to 2 portions, and I loved it! I made it per the directions this time, but next time will try it with the wasabi and breadcrumb substitution. The husband isn't a giant fan of peas. Oh well.
I found the sauce amazing. I did end up having to make up a second batch of marinade to make the sauce, because for some reason, my tuna steaks soaked up almost all of the first batch.
I must say, I didn't have the same problem some reviewers did with the crust burning. I cooked them on medium heat, for a few minutes per side, and got golden deliciousness.

I absolute love these flavor combinations.  However, I did my tuna outside on th grill.  Seared for 2 minutes on each side.  It was perfect. However, I did have a hard time getting the wasabi pea mixture to stay adhered to the tuna.  Will try several of the tips that were offered from other cooks here.
