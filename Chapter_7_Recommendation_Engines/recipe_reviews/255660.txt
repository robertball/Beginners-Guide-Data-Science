10.15.16  Made half a recipe which called for half of a small butternut squash (and mine was small).  I peeled and cut that half into cubes, but if I’d used  all of it, the meat/sauce mixture wouldn’t have even covered the squash.  I ended up using about a quarter of a small squash.  I did use Spanish tomato sauce which gave it a little kick of heat, and added a whole bay leaf (not ground bay leaf) to the picadillo, removing it before serving.  I typically add potatoes to my picadillo, but the butternut squash was a nice change.  I live in Florida, I’ve eaten a lot of picadillo (love it, too), and this is a good recipe.  MarieSoler, thanks for sharing.

I have never had Picadillo before so I was not sure what this would be.  I thought the ingredient combination sounded awesome.  It was okay.  I did not add the extra salt since 1800+ per serving is high.  Maybe it will be better tomorrow.  It is good but not great tonight.

Have made this several times and found the ingredients can be changed ( more or less of the spices) and it was still delicious.

Great recipe. Taste delicious!!! Used diced tomato with tomatoe paste instead of tomato sauce., and ground turkey instead of ground beef. It's what I had available and it came out very tasteful. Household each and two plates. No leftovers.

Delicious!! I have made it as is and loved it, and also altered it to adapt to what I had available. It’s highly adaptable so it’s nearly impossible to mess this up! I usually make 3lbs because it goes fast. Sometimes I serve it with rice, sometimes I sauté some small cubes potatoes, other times with mashed potatoes and cheese (rellenos de papas -potato balls- are to die for)...sometimes with eggs. I’m telling you you could use this so many ways.

I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say one packet of sazon, not the entire 1.4oz box of packets. 4 star for what I believe is an error - it smells amazing so far.

The Badia sazón comes in small packets which are about a teaspoon each.  I use 1 packet for 2 lbs of ground beef.  It gives yellow coloring and flavor.  Sorry for the confusion on the sazón amount.

Delicious! I made my own Sazon seasoning because never having heard of it before I wasn’t sure I could find it in Ontario
supermarkets and I had all the ingredients. Then I used way too much because I wasn’t sure how much was in one store bought packet. I compensated by adding less hot sauce. It still turned out great. A little spicy but not too spicy. Next time I will remember that 1 packet of Sazon is equal to 1.5 teaspoons, not tablespoons.

I’m a fairly new cook, and this is one of the few recipes I repeatedly make. I had never had Picadillo before, so I  an’t compare it to anything, but I love how complex the flavors are for being so easy to make. Love the raisin/olive mix, especially. This recipe has never failed me, and is an interesting choice to bring to potlucks. Freezes great.

Was very easy and a huge hit with the family! I made it just as the recipe outlined.
