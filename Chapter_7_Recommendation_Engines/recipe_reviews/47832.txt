Four stars because of the high fat content, but I have been making this salad for years.  It is always a huge hit.  NEVER use fake bacon, or fake anything when you are in the kitchen.  I do this as a layer salad. Building from bottom to top, it goes, lettuce, carrot, broccoli, cauliflower, bacon.  Smear dressing mixture over top and SEAL in the salad ingredients with the dressing from edge to edge.  Now refrigerate overnight.  Just prior to serving, toss salad.  Your veggies will be nice and crisp and fresh and the dressing will have developed properly.

Well, I thought that I knew better than the author and served this salad in less than 1 hour. No raves, but good. Then the next evening I served the remainder of it, and YOU ARE RIGHT - it takes a night in the fridge and it's perfect. Magic.. my parents loved it. My kids tolerated it.

My family loves this recipe. As another reviewer mentioned, it originally came from a MN restaurant. They served it tableside just adding the dressing before serving. The dressing definately must be refrigerated to blend the flavors which in the original recipe included 1 tbsp. apple cider vinegar. I do add 1/2 cup shredded parmesan and some shredded colby-monteray jack blend to the veggie mix. I think that REAL bacon makes a difference too as my recipe calls for 1 pound crumbled. This is not a low cal, low fat recipe, but for low carb fans, it does fit if you use Splenda instead of sugar (a little less, as Splenda seems sweeter). I also do chop the brocolli and calif. somewhat small and keep the lettuce just chopped. I'm bringing this tonite to our neighborhood party, hope they like it!!!

While I enjoyed the flavor, I initially began by leaving out the sugar.  Absolutely NO need for extra calories and unnecessary calories.  I liked it a lot.  However, I made it again but this time I used plain Greek yogurt instead of mayonnaise and I like it a whole lot more.  It had a nice 'zing' to it.  I kept the rice vinegar, a splash of apple cider vinegar, onion powder, Parmesan and I added dill weed.  It is sooo good!  I use it also as a vegetable dip as well as for my daily salads.  It's perfect now and guilt free.  Try it sans the mayo and it will be much less greasy and caloric.

liked this but not with white sugar, added 4 tb of seasoned rice wine vinegar to it instead.  did the sweet/sour thing but thinned the mayo a bit and i am not into completely sweet or thick salad dressings myself.  also added 1/4tsp of penzey's toasted onion powder (killer stuff), a bit of  fresh garlic and some parsley and fresh basil.  could play with the herbs....

We doubled the amount of greens and added homemade croutons and chopped hard-boiled egg. The dressing is key, I made it exactly as written.  Delicious!

This is a GREAT and EASY salad! I've made this a dozen times sice I first came across it last summer.  It always goes down great! Never any left over.  The dressing is enough for double the salad recipe for us though.  I have doubled the reicpe and skipped the greens a couple of times and it went over just as well.  DO LET DRESSING SIT IN FRIDGE OVERNIGHT! Rice wine vinegar works great for thinning out dressing if you like it that way!

It was alright.  Addicting?  Well, I'm the only one who had seconds, but even I wasn't particularly thrilled.  It was just alright.  I thought there was way too much dressing for the amount of veggies.

Wonderful “make ahead” recipe.  I make the dressing and cut up the vegetables the night before.  Just before serving, I mix it all together.  Always double the recipe for gatherings because it’s the first thing to go. I use low fat mayo and everyone still asks for the recipe!

This salad was ok, but not great.  Made it twice now and I make the dressing the night before as directed but the first time the only taste I could discern was mayo.  Second time I added a splash of apple cider vinegar and onion powder.  Definitey helped, but I'm still not making this again.

This salad is deliciously sweet and salty.  However, the next time I make this I will reduce the amount of mayonnaise by 1/3 or even 1/2, as I felt it was a little excessive (and I am not a calorie counter). Of course you could also add more spring mix and veggies to compensate for the abundance of dressing!  Overall this a really tasty salad and one I'm sure to make again.

YUM!  I made this for a family get together and LOVED it.  My husband was hesitant about me making it when he saw the cauliflower... but chopped super fine, even HE thought it tasted good!  Definitely make the dressing the day before.  While you're at it, cook and crumble the bacon and chop the cauliflower so all you need to do is toss all the ingredients the next day!  You won't be dissappointed!

This was missing something.  I haven't quite figured out what it was, and I may not because my mom is gone and I never got the recipe from her.  But I remember this salad, I grew up on it since mom made it at home.  Though Tequilaberry's is now closed, you can still get this salad at the Vineyard.  Oh....and just a tip....the original salad has real (crumbled) bacon, and the cauliflower is chopped up fine (kids usually don't notice it).

I think this Salad is Fantastic. Great Recipe and Simple! Who can ask for more. You must follow the directions as far as refrigerating the dressing overnight. It is one of those recipies where it is much better the second day. Yum!!!! I recommend this for busy working moms like me. Who dont have a lot of time to make healthy dishes but strive too! Very enjoyable!

I also played with the recipe some and put in some boiled Egg and Crunchy Chinese Noodles!

I made this for dinner tonight and it was great. Only change I made was I added 1/2 of shaved Parmesian cheese to the greens instead of 1/2 cup of grated cheese. Of course I still used the grated cheese in the dressing last night.  This did not serve 8 however. But we had this salad as our main course, it served 4.

I hadn't had this salad in years and decided to make it for friends who had never had it.  So glad to find the recipe.  My friends loved the salad and wanted the recipe.  To lower the fat just a bit I used Miracle Whip light salad dressing and only about 6 or 7 strips of bacon.  Also added a little broccoli for added color.  Fantastic salad.  Certainly won't wait years to have it again!

UNBELIEVABLE!!! My man-friend said this was THE BEST salad he's ever had! he actually wanted to have his ice cream as his appetizer and finish off with the salad...so easy and just perfect for the homemade spaghetti with Italian sausage and garlic bread. I'm glad I purchased extra parmesan so we can have this again later in the week!

Great salad. I make the salad, the spread the dressing over it as a layer (not mixed in) and refrigerate overnight. It can be served that way or after sitting overnight, mix everything up, by folding the dressing back into the salad. Always gets rave comments from guests and the recipe is always asked for.

This was a great recipe!  Unfortunately it looked a little weird and my kids (5)had a hard time getting up the nerve to try it.  They aren't big cauliflower fans but it was so good I didn't push them to try so I could have seconds tomorrow.

Really good!  I used miracle whip instead of mayonnaise.  Will probably cut the dressing recipe in half next time, I added it to individual servings & had alot left.

One of the ladies in my card club often brings a salad similar to this to our potlucks.  Unfortunately, although I followed the recipe exactly, it seemed to be missing something.  I guess I'll have to call my friend and see what she puts in hers.  Thanks for the post!

This salad was a hit at our weekly office luncheon.  I used 4 strips of bacon, cut into bite size pieces, instead of the bacon bits. Delicious!

My mother in law has been making this salad for what - 40 years now? It is commonly called "Overnight Salad". Hint - it tastes MUCH better if you use chopped onion instead of carrots in this salad. 
You layer it in the dish, seal it and leave it overnight in the refrigerator. Next day, stir very well, and you have a very addicting salad.  

Leave the carrots out, and toss a handful of flax seeds in instead!
You don't even have to measure the mayo - just spread a thin layer on top of the cauliflower like you were frosting a cupcake. It's hard to do this one wrong.

I've made this salad tons of times, but the lettuce gets wilted!  So if you don't have a crowd to eat it right away use coleslaw instead, it lasts many days.

I have used a similar recipe for years and everyone asks for it for the holidays. I double the lettuce and use mixed greens,add broccoli,young small peas,celery,cauliflower and water chestnuts (the more crunch the better). Also, I have used cubed chicken and made it as a dinner salad. This recipe is only limited by your imagination.

This is truly an AMAZING Salad!!!  I had never had anything so tasty in the salad category for some time... and the flavor was incredible with the recipe only changed by the elimination of cauliflower and the addition of diced fresh tomato.  Increditble!!!  And my guests loved it as well...  No leftovers on this one!!!

I've used & enjoyed dozens of recipes from this site... and had a few fall short. This is too sweet, greasy & just has no redeeming taste!

I thought I was going to like this salad more than I did.  If I make it again, I think I will use fresh bacon next time and possibly add some dried fruit.  It was good as is, but after a few bites, my husband and I had both had enough.

Sorry to say, i found this salad gross.  I made the dressing ahead like the reviews recommended and still found it too dry.  Nobody at my dinner party ate this salad, it's, NOT a keeper...

Delicious as is. I made it the night before and refrigerated it, then added the dressing just before serving.

I have been using this recipe for years, but I keep the ingredients in separate containers in the fridge, and use them for individual dinner salads.  That way I can enjoy this salad, even when I'm dining alone, but do not have to make up a big bowl of salad.  This recipe can be modified to be low carb.

This recipe i haven't made in years. Thanks for reminding me to make. It was from a restaurant in Minnesota called the Brandyberry.the secret was to get all items cold separately and put together right before serving, otherwise it got weepy. Original had broccoli, not carrots.original also just used a head of lettuce, lettuce chopped in larger pieces. Seems to me mine also had some cream in it.

I've made salads before and then had quite a bit leftover, however, THIS one I had none left!  I used less dressing and put the rest to the side if someone wanted more on theirs.  I also omitted the sugar and added a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar.  Let the dressing sit the night before and tossed the salad before serving.  VERY easy to make and very quick.  This is one definitely worth the try.
