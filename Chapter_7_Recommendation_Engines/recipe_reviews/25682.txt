I made this on the stovetop. The only thing I changed was.....I steamed 6 dozen Mahogany clams instead of using canned clams. ( strain the broth from steaming the clams through cheese cloth to ensure that there's no sand) and add to soup instead of the clam juice mentioned. THIS WAS FABULOUS!!!!!!

It seems I'm seldom able to make a recipe as written. Like the others, I did it on top of the stove. I scaled the recipe to 2 servings.

I had 2 hot Italian sausage so I stripped them out of their skin to make "meatballs". Sauteed them in garlic flavored olive oil with 2/5 of a huge onion. 

Snipped up some roasted, dried bullnose peppers. "hey Google, what's 10% of 5oz in grams?" About 14 grams of dried King Bolete mushrooms from Finland went next along with a can of petite diced tomatoes in juice and a little extra water because the veggies were dried.
I added the basil and salt as directed. I only had 1 box wine in my house so ? c Moscato went in. When these had simmered a bit, I added 1# seafood medley from Costco. 

I covered it and cooked it just long enough to thaw and cook the frozen seafood.

Three of us had a bowl and there is enough leftover for at least 2 more bowls.
Spectacular!
