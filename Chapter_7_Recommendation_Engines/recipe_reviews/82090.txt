I doubled this recipe as we were having company over for steak & the sauce as a spray just wasn't that wonderful but since I had made so much of it I kept it in the frig. A week later I wanted to slow cook a 5-6 pound trimmed brisket & wanted marinade for it. I thought I'd try this as it really had time for the flavors to blend & it had a great aroma when I re-opened it. I placed the brisket in a baking pan made small stabs deeply (against the grain) in the meat & inserted halved garlic cloves in the slits. I did add more Worchestershire to the already prepared sauce as we like the spiciness poured this over the brisket & covered the top with freshly grd pepper. I foiled the top of the pan tightly & placed it in the frig overnight. The next day I took the pan from the frig awhile to remove the chill cooked the brisket in a 300 F oven for 2 1/2 hours. It smelled great cooking. It tasted like it had been smoked outside! I set on the counter for about 30 minutes then sliced the brisket thinly at an angle getting little slices of garlic embedded in many slices of meat. I strained the juices from the pan & kept it warm. Everyone was spooning this on their servings! No sauce went to waste & the leftover brisket was just as awesome the next day! Will give the spray technique another try only will make it about a week ahead of the time I'm going to use it. Thanks!

I just love this spray and have used it often for the last 13 years now. It keeps really well in my fridge. The recipe comes from a steak resteraunt in Sitka Alaska and they are famous for their steaks. My recipe is a bit different but has 1/3 cup vermouth 1/3 cup peach/apricot brandy 1/3 cup tiakomen(spl) meat marinade and the 1/8 cup kitchen bouquet. The key is to have the steak at room temperature and let me just add this is not a marinade since it can easily overpower a steak. Also I spray some on the steak spray on the coals/grill and let the evaporation come up onto the steak. I know it is a bit expensive to make but I usually give a couple spray bottles to friends as gifts.

This was OK but honestly I think I prefer just a plain piece of steak with salt and pepper as seasoning. The liquid smoke gave it an interesting smoky flavor but other than that it was too overpowering for the steak.
