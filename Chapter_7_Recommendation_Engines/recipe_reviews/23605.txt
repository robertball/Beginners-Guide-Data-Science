This is something that I make when I've really got to stretch out what I've got in the cupboards/fridge. To really make it work for you, add in whatever vegetables you have on hand and a can of tomato sauce or two. I like to add carrots, zucchini, spinach, red pepper. garlic. Spices, I'll usually add basil, fennel, thyme. If you've got a little bacon grease in your fridge, saute your vegetables in that before you add the rest of your ingredients. TIP: I usually add a little molasses in my speghetti sauce for a deeper flavor and a little sweetness.

Excellent.  I did make a few minor changes though. I used shell noodles instead of macaroni and cooked it seperately and then added it to the hamburger/tomato mixture, so I left out the 2 cups of water. I used a package of beefy onion soup mix since that is what I had on hand.  I also cut back on the oregano, since my canned tomatoes were already seasoned with basil, garlic and oregano.  Hubby loved it.

I stuck to the original recipe and was surprised both and how simple it was and at how much my family liked it. With so many people adding to or changingt he recipe and commenting, I just wanted to say that it is good on its own. Simple and good.

My husband said it was better than the one his mom used to make - I added a little spaghetti sauce to thicken it up and it turned out great!

While this was hearty, simple, and quick, it was just an average meal. Not to say my family didn't like it---we all did! It just isn't a dish I'd purposely plan into my weekly menu. On the other hand, it was perfect for my needs tonight: a dinner I could throw together using simple items I already had on hand. For that reason alone, I'd make it again if I found myself in a pinch. By the way, I did throw in a large handful of fresh spinach just before adding the cheese. It did make the dish more colorful while sneaking in some veggies!

Very good and easy!  I did make some changes only because I wanted to use what I had on hand.  First I used 2 lb's of ground beef and no onion soup mix.  I sauteed one samll onion and one small green pepper with 3 cloves of minced garlic, then I added the ground beef to cook.  I used 2 fresh tomatoes (peeled and diced)and dired parsley, dried oregano leaves and lawry's seasoning salt.  I added the water and pasta.  When the pasta was done I add the parmesan cheese and about 2-3 handfuls of shredded  colby jack cheese.  Sorry for all the changes but it was very good!

This is a great weeknight recipe. It is quick and easy. I used garlic mushroom soup mix, because I didn't have any onion soup mix. Next time, I will use the onion soup. I added some dry minced onions. I, also, used chopped canned tomatoes to save a step. The leftovers were great for lunch, too. Thanks for the recipe.

I just love this! It's like a healthier, home-made version of hamburger helper. After I started it, I realized I had no canned tomatoes, so I sliced up a large fresh one and threw in an extra cup of water. I thought this might make it taste "plain" but it still had loads of flavour! I also used the cheese I had on hand, which happened to be Havarti and Cheddar. This will definitely be a regular in my household!

Awesome! I used One can diced tomatoes and chilis 10 oz and 14 oz crushed tomatoes, added 3 extra ounces of water and used 2 cups rotini - everything else the same and it turned out amazing! This is my new staple for weeknights with room for variation each week.

Pretty good! Quick and easy. Very Italian-ish and yummy. It would be great with a salad and some bread! If you liked this you might try the Mexican version of this Taco Casserole (also on this site!) I will make this again.

Simple,quick and easy to make.  I added a clove of garlic and doubled the mozzarella.  I plan to add some chopped onion and substitute ground turkey for the ground beef.  It's not a favorite but good and everyone liked it.

Pretty tasty (my 1 and 4-yr-old both ate it!) and just used stuff I had around the house.  I only simmered for 15 minutes.  Didn't have canned tomatoes so I used a jar of chunky Ragu spaghetti sauce.  I also mixed the mozz cheese in as someone suggested.  Not the most special meal, but good for a quick and easy meal.

Great base recipe. I made a few changes. I used rigatoni pasta and precooked. Cooked the rest in separately and added diced green pepper and mushrooms. Skipped the water but added a small can of tomato sauce along with italian diced tomatoes.. Added everything together and put into a 3 qt baking dish. Covered with cheeses and baked at 350 for 50 min. The family loved it!!

This is a really nice easy recipe to make.  It makes a quick weeknight meal.  It also has quite a bit of flavor from the onion soup.  The only change I made was to use small shell pasta because it was what I had and it was really good.  Also next time I may use a can of diced tomatoes instead since you just have to chop the whole tomatoes which takes a little time.

This is super easy and quick to prepare, and I always have the ingredients in the cupboard, and it tastes great, too.  I only had 1 and 1/2 cups of uncooked elbow noodles, so I just decreased the water to 1 and 1/2 cups, worked out perfectly.  I will make this again on a night I don't want to think about what's for dinner or don't plan ahead.

This is not gourmet by any stretch of the imagination, but it has a good flavor and filled 4 hungry peoples bellies.  The only change I made was to use a 28oz of diced tomatoes instead of the whole ones.  Thanks for the recipe.

To make this recipe a little healthier, I added chopped spinach (drained), artichoke, and 1/4 cup fat-free ricotta cheese.  Then I substituted macaroni pasta for cooked whole wheat penne, cut the cheeses in half, and sauteed with a half a cup of pasta water.

I've made this many times from my "grandmother's recipe". The only thing she does diffently is add chopped onion to the ground beef and the noodles are shells, not macaroni. A simple, quick and tasty casserole!

This was quick, easy, and pretty tasty!  It was kind of like a skillet lasagna.  I was out of dried oregano, so I used an Italian blend instead.  I also used diced tomatoes instead of chopping up the whole ones.  Oh, and they were the ones flavored with basil, oregano, and garlic.  I also didn't even measure the cheese, just kind of eyeballed it and threw it in and mixed it up.  The kids loved it!  My 2yo had seconds!

I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe. My 5 year old and 1 year old loved it. I'm rating it a 5 because it is an easy, kid friendly, great tasting recipe that I can whip up after work. 

Substitutions: I used a can of diced tomatoes and marble (mozza & Cheddar) cheese on top.

My husband and I loved this dish. I used spiral noodles as that is what I had on hand and it worked great. I did add a little more tomato sauce as someone else did. I think next time I will add some onions and mushrooms. mmmm

Awesome!   I used Mild Italian Ground Pork instead of Beef - and to die for!  Tastes just as good as my sauce that I cook for hours in a crock pot - the dry onion soup mix - that's the key - taste is so good - my family loved it, and ready in 45min.  Thanks for sharing this!

I sauté onions and minced garlic and then add the beef. It seems I never have onion soup on hand, so I add garlic salt, oregano and some Italian seasonings. This is great for stretching the week before you can go to the grocery store.

This was simple to fix and actually pretty tasty too. It wasn't too tomatoey. I thought it would taste like spaghetti but it really didn't it was sort of like a beefaroni with some tomatoes. I used stewed tomatoes and only had a 14.5 oz. can. We rated this 3.5 stars for a decent meal. Thanks.

very quick dish, substituted the macaroni with egg noodles and the canned tomatoes with 3/4 chopped tomato and 1/2 cup corn. I will definitely be making this again.

Not a sophisticated recipe, but a good one.  Nice for a  family with young kids.  Mine loved it.  I substituted beefy onion soup mix and wide egg noodles.  We will make this again.

It was quick and easy to make, but I wasn't a fan at all.  I couldn't even finish a full serving.  My one year old loved it on the other hand.

Love this recipe. We substitute tomato paste and extra water for the diced tomatoes (because of a picky child), and smother it with extra mozza cheese at the end. Simple and delicious for the whole family!

I've been making this for years, think I found the recipe on a package of Catelli pasta way back in the '80's. Instead of macaroni, I use rotini. It's my go to when I get home late and need supper on the table quickly, it's also my go to if someone drops by, and stays for supper. With a salad and some kind of nice bread or rolls, it perfect (although I use more that 1/2 cup mozza..I load it on) Everyone loves this simple meal.

I didn't have onion soup mix so I fried onions and peppers, added 2 beef boullion cubes, used 2 -3 fresh tomatoes chopped, fresh grated parmesean  cheese and everything else the same.

I made the full recipe for my husband and I.  We loved it. Made it per recipe-it was easy to put together, in particular, because I did not feel well.  He took leftovers for lunch.  Will make again!!

I was seriously surprised!  5 stars for taste and ease!

I just added 2 teaspoons "Beef Better than Bouillon" and I used rice noodles.  I didn't have mozzarella so I doubled the parmesan and WHAMO - tastes like lasagna.  Family loved it and even the boys (who don't like tomatoes) said "Wow, supper smells great!"

I've been making this for years. I found the recipe on the package of onion soup mix. When my two boys had their own families, I got the request from them for the recipe. It's now a staple in all of our households. Easy to make while staying in time shares where kitchen pans are not always the best.

At first bite, my husband said "I LIKE it"!  I made just a couple changes:  replaced the onion soup mix with a sprinkling of garlic powder, maybe 1/8 tsp., used Farfalle pasta and the only canned tomatoes on hand --  fire-roasted.  The result was delicious!!

It didn't really taste like anything.  I had to use crushed tomatoes instead of whole because that's what I had but I followed the recipe for everything else.  Just ok. Hamburger Helper tastes much better.

Very yummy. I made a few changes based on what I had at home; I used bowtie pasta which me and my SO both like texture-wise a lot. Also did half-hamburger, half Italian sagusage which added a nice flavor. Very good recipe -- you can do a lot with it!

My 13 year old son made this, and it is a great homemade recipe for new cooks.  Satisfying and tasty, and not too salty, even with the onion soup mix.    My whole family enjoyed it.

didn't have parmesan cheese, so just used extra mozzarella. Used petite diced tomatoes so I wouldn't have to chop them myself. Stirred in a couple handfuls of fresh spinach just before adding cheese. Otherwise, followed directions. It was pretty plain; needed more flavor. maybe sauce would have been better?

5 stars for the simplicity, and for the childhood memories this stirs up! My mom made this a lot but we didn't have meat very often so she used drained and rinsed kidney beans for protein. We loved it! It's simple and filling, and perfect for families on a tight budget. Thank you BJ!

This is a quick, easy, weekday meal which turned out better than expected.  The dry onion soup mix was a concern but I followed the recipe and it was easy and very tasty for the effort involved in making it.  Sure you can add things to this if you choose to do so, but now you have created more work than you need to as this is good as written.  I served it in the skillet with just the addition of some fresh basil over the top.  I will make this again and I am sending the recipe to the kids so they can make it for their kids.
