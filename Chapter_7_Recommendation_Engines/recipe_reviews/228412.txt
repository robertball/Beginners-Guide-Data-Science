Simple, yet tasty! This comes together very quickly...the hardest part is waiting for the cucumber to marinate an hour!  I love marinated cukes and this is a nice change from the usual. Next time I think I will use one clove of fresh garlic instead of granulated. The only change I made was to double the green onions.  Delicious!

Wow, Wow & Wow!  What a terrific variation for a cucumber salad. I wasn't sure whether or not to use "toasted" sesame oil, so I used half toasted and half regular. The marinade is delicious. Only other change I made was to add more green onion.  This recipe is certainly a "keeper".  Only regret is I didn't double or triple the batch.  I won't make that mistake again. Thank you for sharing this great cucumber variation.  (*I tried to review previously which didn't post, so if the first review appears from cyber space, please excuse the duplication)

I have been making a similar dish. To offset the sweetness, add balance and crunch, I add thinly sliced radishes at serving time. It adds color too. Radishes are not good if added when marinating cucumber. They become unpleasant in texture.

These are great! Worst part was slicing my finger on the mandolin....ouch! I'll be more careful next time-because there WILL be a next time. Only I know I need to at least double it because it doesn't make very much-though I don't think I'd make enough for leftovers because the flavor is pretty strong and it's easy enough to just make it up for dinner (I ate the whole thing myself and was glad I didn't have to share it!) I  also think some shredded daikon could be good in this. I had a huge cucumber (seedless) and there was more than enough vinaigrette. My sweet chili sauce had garlic in it so I left the extra garlic out. Everything else was the same and I found the amounts perfect, although I am a lover of sesame oil. Sprinkled some sesame seeds on the top. Great Asian side dish! Thanks!

Great flavor!! I used a mandolin to slice the cucumbers so it was super fast to prepare. I used jarred garlic rather than the granulated garlic. I'm always happy to find Asian dishes without soy. This salad is not spicy in the least to me, especially with the added sugar, but I wouldn't change a thing! Honestly, I didn't think I was a big fan of cucumbers but I will be making this again!

This recipe is great!!  A nice change from a mayo based dressing.  Like others you can't stop eating it....addicting!  If I have fresh tomatoes I chop them up and add them also.

Really good cucumber salad that deserves 5 stars as it is written.  We like a little kick sometimes so I added a teaspoon of spicy Asian chili sauce and we loved it both ways.

You had me at Thai sweet chili sauce! Love this variation on cucumber salad! I have made this several times now and like to use the small baby cucumbers because they seem to stay crunchy longer. While I have made this "as is" and enjoyed it, I'm not wild about sesame oil. I love feta with cucumber and found I can add the feta if I leave out the sesame; they just don't meld well together. It's just a personal preference, this is still 5 stars! Thanks for sharing!

We liked this recipe, a lot, but I did cut the sesame oil down to 1/2 teaspoon.  I made it up in the morning and they were flavor packed by dinner time.

I really liked this.  However, unless you are big on sesame oil, reduce or leave out. Next time I'll reduce it.  This was good though.

This was so tasty and refreshing! I used a clove of fresh garlic in place of the granulated. I made this earlier in the day, and the cucumbers released some of their water, but this didn’t compromise the flavor, but the cukes were softer (like refrigerator pickles). Just wanted to mention that in case others prefer their cucumbers crunchier. I will make this again! Thanks for the recipe!

Light and refreshing with as much zip as you'd like to add.   Great way to help use up summer cucumbers especially for those who are calorie conscious.   Thanks for posting as it's found a home in my "regular" box.

This was a simple and delicious recipe....I made it to accompany an Asian shrimp dish with rice but I would recommend it be used for any Asian dish with noodles as well.   Wonderful!

I didn't have the Thai sauce, but Google said that I could replace it with plum sauce mixed with Siracha, and that worked. I also added some sesame seeds. I like it more than the usual vinegar based Asian cucumber salad because it has a bit of a kick to it.

Awesome! Only changes I made were to use garlic powder and a bit less (wanted a lighter garlic flavor), and I added some sliced red pepper (think I'll use orange or yellow next time, and add basil or mint), and a few turns of black pepper. Quick & fun to make, and delicious, this is worth saving for the vinaigrette alone. Someone asked about white or black sesame oil, I happened to grab Phoenix Claws and Jade Trees by Kian Lam Kho today, who says black sesame oil is the more traditional Chinese, and white is un toasted, more used in Middle  Eastern cooking. I have both & happened to choose the black when I made it last night, but I'm sure the white would be just fine, too. Anyway, I love this salad!

Made this recipe last night, and it was tasty ! A nice and welcomed change from the typical mayo based version.

I did omit the sesame, and added a little bit more sugar and onions - everyone loved it !

7 21 17 ...  https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/228412/cucumber-salad-with-thai-sweet-chili-vinaigrette/ ... I liked this, but thought I'd like it more.  I like spicy food & this is spicy!  Spicy is the main flavor though.  Easy enough to add more sugar, but, as is, it's spicy with a hint of cucumber.

Very easy to make and flavorful.  The only addition I did was add chopped radishes and celery.  I also added the juice of half a lime.  Also, I didn't have the sweet chili sauce so I used 1 Tablespoon of asian chilli paste.  Very good

Yummy! I put in about 1.5 t sugar, because I like my cucumber salad significantly sweeter. Other than that, it's a keeper! I served it with Stuffed curried Thai puffs from this site. Most people actually spooned the cucumbers over their curry puffs. Yum!

Super easy and delicious!  I subbed distilled white vinegar for the rice vinegar and a tbsp of minced fresh garlic instead of granulated garlic and it worked well.  I've got loads of cucumbers growing in my garden and expect to be eating this recipe several times a week throughout the summer.

This is delicious as is. To turn it into a light lunch, I add shredded carrot, rice noodles, cilantro, and crushed peanuts. I make this often in the summer when my CSA provides me with more cucumbers than I know what to do with.

We love this recipe just as written but for extra crunch, sprinkle the sliced cucumber with  salt, let rest in a colander for 30 minutes before rinsing and patting dry enough to add to the sauce.  I make this to accompany every stir fry.

Mmmm. Enjoyed multiple times as written - and look at the calorie count! I pair this with a red curry butternut squash soup - the perfect combination of cool/sweet with savory/spicy. Thanks so much.

Good recipe - something different.  However, most got thrown away just because it wasn't something  I craved.   I would prefer it with half the onions and maybe just a touch less sesame oil.

I was bored of my regular cucumber salad so I tried this. It seems like the quantities are way off here. I used twice the amount of cucumbers but between the vinegar and chili sauce the salad was so sharp. It was edible the first time I served it, but after marinating for another day we just couldn't stomach it. I'm not trying this again.

The flavor of these surprised me. I am not too familiar with Thai food, but there was a lot going on flavor wise. They were sweet, salty, and a tad peppery or vinegary. I actually was able to find the sweet chili sauce at Trader Joes and my garlic powder container, from Penzeys, said granulated garlic on the top. Until I saw that I was confused to that ingredient specifically. It said to cut the cucumber thin. I sliced it about 1/8," and I used a partially peeled English cucumber. I ended up doubling the other ingredients as I had quite a bit of cucumber slices. Only change was, eating it after 5-10 minutes. I just prefer crisp cucumbers. ty

Delicious and just like we've had when we eat out! Might ramp down the cilantro a bit, but otherwise just great!
