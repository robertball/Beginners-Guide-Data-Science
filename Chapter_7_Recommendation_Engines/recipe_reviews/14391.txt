This was very good. I used new baby red potatoes and just left them whole. I also added some cayenne pepper because I like things spicy. I also only had light mayonnaise but it still tasted great. I served this to my fiance and two of our friends. My fiance doesn't really like sweet potatoes but he ate all of his. Everyone really enjoyed it.

This salad includes enough of the conventional "potato salad" ingredients to keep the traditionaslist happy but the addition of the sweet potatoes makes it just different enough that most eaters will comment on it. The folks I served it to really liked it.

I made this to take to a Thanksgiving potluck and thought it was very tasty. Next time though I would peel potatoes and cube instead of slice. Also, I couldn't find any dill relish -- I used sweet. Yummy!

This was just OK I thought.  I didn't think it was bad, but I didn't love it either. I served it to my parents who like potato salad and neither of them finished what they took.  Maybe it wasn't traditional enough for them?  I think it's a hard recipe...it wasn't traditional for those wanting that but not really interesting enough for those wanting something really different.  I wouldn't make it again.

I made this for sweet potato lovers and everyone thought it was "just okay". Won't make it again, not a bad recipe, just not to our liking.

Delightful.... I followed the recipe exactly and found the dressing with fresh parsley to be very tasty. The next time I'm going to add some hard boiled eggs.  This would be an outstanding dish to bring to a pot luck dinner.

This was really good, I thought I wouldn't like it because I have never had both sweet and red potatoes together but it was good.  My picky eaters weren't too pleased. But that is okay,because they hardly ever are...

I get lots of compliments when I make this salad. It's very tasty. I found it tastes better when you make it in advance and let the flavors mix overnight. I also make more (about double) "dressing" than the recipe calls for. I found it a little bit of a pain to cook the potatoes, but I don't usually make potato salads. So, no strikes against the recipe. It is worth the effort though, since it tastes so good.

A very nice change of pace from the usual potato salad. Not too much mayonnaise; not too little. My SO, who likes mustard-based potato salads, said this one didn't need any. I added a little balsamic vinegar for a little more punch. Did not have red onions, but used regular and added some roasted red pepper for color. Did not have parsley, either, but this stands well without it.
