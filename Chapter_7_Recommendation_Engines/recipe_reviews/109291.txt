This recipe turned out very well with some minor alterations: 
1) I used slightly more liquid than specified in the recipe, I believe about another half-cup of water to get the rice tender. 
2) I did not add the asparagus until about 7 minutes before I pulled the risotto off of the heat. The asparagus had time to cook adequately without going limp, adding a nice counterpoint to the soft texture of the risotto. 
3) This is not a recipe for 2 servings. This recipe had no problem feeding 3 people for dinner and two more for lunch the next day.

This ended up tasting pretty good with very few modifications. I made a double recipe. It was still a bit too "al dente" for my taste when I was done adding the broth. So I added another 3/4 cup water, cooked about 10 more minutes, and it worked out just fine. After tasting the recipe, I'm thinking of trying it with shrimp the next time.

I've never made risotto before & I'm not a big fan of recipes that require me to stand and stir for a long time; however, this was VERY tasty and worth the effort.  I enlisted the help of my teenagers with the stirring...  I used 3 chicken breasts, 1 regular onion, and 2 cans (about 4 cups) of chicken stock.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  It easily fed 5 people with no leftovers and we will be making it again.

This is a nice, basic risotto recipe.  It needs MUCH more liquid though, at least 4 cups.

Yum. I added a little poultry seasoning to the chicken to add a little flavor, as chicken can get bland at times. Next time I would use 1/2 to 3/4 c wine. I think I used a bit too much. I also used one quart of chicken broth (like I always do when making risotto), adding one ladel-full at a time. Like many other people, I didn't add my asparagus until the last 10 minutes or so. This turned out really nice.

This is an excellent recipe.  Instead of chicken and asparagus, I used cooked, frozen shrimp and frozen peas.  It was very popular (and delicious)!

Outstanding! I love a good Risotto and this is a true Italian dish. Risotto is a little hard to make the first time, however, these directions were excellent. Best recipe I have found on this sight by far!

It needed an additional cup of chicken broth and I added a 1/2 can of mushrooms.  I cut the rice back to 3/4 cup and kept all of the other ingredients flavor come out so it wouldn't be bland.  It isn't special occasion spectacular, but I would make it again as just a regular meal.

This is a bit time consuming but it was delicious.  I upped the wine to 3/4 c. as suggested by another reviewer.  The only things I did differently were:  I used fresh basil only because I happened to have it.  I also used half chicken broth and half vegetable broth because I didn't have enough chicken.  It wasn't dry at all like some of the others said.  The consistency was just right, slightly al dente.  I also did NOT put the asparagus in until the last maybe 8-10 minutes, which was perfect.  It had a slight crunch.

This recipe came out great even with my substitutions due to lack of ingredients! I used minute rice due to lack of risotto, and frozen asparagus which I didn't add until the last addition of the broth because I didn't want it to overcook.  I did use about a cup of extra broth like someone else suggested.  And, unfortunately I was out of white wine so I used a cup of hard cider...  :)  It still came out great!  This recipe is definitely worth trying!

Made correctly this is beyond a 5 star recipe--I used approximately 5 cups of chicken broth and skipped the Parmesan cheese (was out).  Incredibly delicious!  I diced the asparagus stalks but left the tips in tact (added the tips during the last round of broth).  Will definitely make again!

This was my first attempt at risotto.  I read some of the other comment and was concerned about the amount of liquid.  I ended up using 2 1/2 cups (split in three) and it worked fine. I probably could have done the 2 cups.  Other than that this recipes was pretty easy and straightforward.
This was a really tasty recipe and I will def. make it again.  I made it as a side dish so I left out the chicken. The recipes yielded a lot, I would think it is more than two servings even as a main.  
I also noticed the nutritional information seems very high, even for the large portions.  When I put the recipe into a nutrition calculator, it came back less than posted on here (I did with and without chicken)

This dish was really good, my picky italian father who makes risotto all the time even liked it... i made some changes, I added in mushrooms with the juice, as like the other readers said it was a little dry, definitely recommend adding more chicken broth, I also added saffron for my flavor and color.  Instead of adding the chicken in at the end, I added it in in the middle as it looked like the chicken was getting dry as well.  Will definitely make again, might try just mushrooms and asparagus and make it a side dish

Very good flavor.  I used 4 cups of stock, shitake mushrooms and broccoli instead of asparagus because its what I had on hand.  Mushrooms were amazing in it.  I will make this again exactly the same way or with the asparagus instead of broccoli.   Try it with the mushrooms!!!!

Fantastic!  I'll absolutely make this again!  I used 2x the chicken broth, as recommended by other reviewers.  I did not use the oregano, basil, salt, or pepper, and it was still amazing!  Completely forgot the cheese, too, and didn't miss it.  A rich roasted garlic flavor throughout, the family scarfed it up!

Very Good. I roughly doubled the recipe, and it was enough to feed six comfortably. I decided to use chicken thighs instead of breasts because I think they have a little more flavor. Like many others, I definitely needed more stock and wine than the recipe called for. I followed the advice of many reviewers and added the asparagus closer to the end of cooking, giving it a little more crunch. I also decided to add the juice of a little less than half a lemon a few minutes before serving and it added a really nice flavor to it. I would definitely make this again.

I used broccoli instead of asparagus.  This was only the second time I have had risotto and I really don't care for it. It had a very nice flavor but takes a lot of time and patience.  Probably won't make again.

I made this vegetarian and added a bit more asparagus.  Also, instead of wine I used more chicken broth and 1 or 2 tsp red wine vinegar.  I also only used 1/4 cup cheese as that's all it needed for my taste.  Very delicious and I believe it would have been just as delicious without the substitutions.

Yum - I loved this!! I had to add a little more chicken stock at the end and keep cooking because though all the liquid would absorb, the rice was still a little too al dente - but that worked perfectly.

I am sooo sad that I didn't read previous reviews.  There is WAY too much balsamic vineger in this recipe.  If you like vinegar this recipe is for you, otherwise reduce it at least by half.

This is more of a perfected "chicken and rice" dish. I've tried recipes with chick soup, creamed etc and nothing compares to this. Simple and just real good. The kinda meal that turns out the same every time you make it. Thanks!

I love risotto. This required a bit more liquid than the recipe called for. I ended up adding quite a bit more white wine. I also used portabello mushrooms rather than asparagus. My dinner guests all enjoyed this. The basic recipe is good - just needs a little tweaking.

This was just okay. It needed much more chicken stock than the recipe called for and thus ended up taking much longer than anticipated. The parmesean cheese was too much; the overall flavor was just parmesean cheese and asparagus.

I made this last night and it was outstanding.  My husband and I both loved it.  The only modification was I used a little more (about 1/4 cup) white wine.  I agree with an earlier post that the asparagus could be added later.  It would have a better texture and color.  Will definitly be making this again.

Great recipe, but agree with the other reviewers comments regarding the wine (increased by adding 1 1/2 times what the recipe called for) and broth.  I needed more than double the broth as what the recipe called for in order to get the risotto to the softness I wanted.  I also needed to add some salt and garlic powder for a little more taste.  All in all, great recipe!

Being the first day of Spring I was excited to make something with asparagus. I used Champagne instead of white wine. I used left-over chicken. I am not a fan of mushy asparagus so I cooked it seperately and then stirred it in with the chicken. The amount of liquid and timing on this  was spot on for me.  This was good for me but I guess the rest of the family is not a fan of risotto. They didn't get the whole creaminess thing. More for me. :)

This is a great recipe in that it gives you the basic techniques and then you can make it your own if you like. I have made it several times now. I've made it with the listed ingredients and also made it with different kinds of rice, cooked chicken breasts, omitting the wine, substituting different vegetables, different aromatics such as shallots, etc. My family loves it. It's simple, inexpensive and just lovely.

This was great. I followed some of the other reviewers advice and added more liquid (extra 1/2 cup of chicken broth) and didn't put the asparagus in until the end. My very picky boyfriend even liked it. Next time I'm going to try peas instead  of asparagus just to mix it up.

Great, basic recipe.  For all of those complaining about the amount of broth... that is just the idiosyncrasy of cooking risotto.  It requires both less liquid (added in small amounted intervals) and constant stirring to absorb.  I thought this recipe does a great job of introducing this concept.

Very good.  I skipped white wine (as I usually do onbthese receipes), used chicken theighs as that is what I had around and added a little more asparagus.  I had to use a bit more chicken stock to compensate for lack of dine, but came out fantastic!  Will make again.

Delicious- I added fresh parsley and basil at the end. Just be patient as it takes a while for the risotto to plump up and be tender but it's really good and a nice change!

I've made it several times now. Like all risotto dishes, the stirring is a pain in the neck. But... it is delicious and worth the effort. Even my 12-year old who doesn't fancy asparagus all that much loved it. My family cheers when I suggest it for dinner! As other reviewers have mentioned, you might need to add more water as you go to ensure a creamy texture. But that's a minor point that almost goes without saying anytime you make a rice dish, so I'm not going to knock a star off for that!

This recipe was just okay. I ended up having to add extra broth because the rice was still under cooked. Didn't really care for the overall flavors either. Will not make again

This wasn't perfect, but it was so nice, I'll give it 5 stars anyway. I made it pretty much exactly as written, except I had a bit more chicken, 1.17# (17.17 oz.) instead of the 10 oz. specified. (I have no idea where people find chicken breasts that small.) I didn't know what kind of white wine to use, so I used a Moscato d'Asti, which is sweet. The "add stock, and stir some more" steps were a bit involved, but I took the time. I'm not very experienced with risotto, but I've made a few different recipes, and in comparison this one didn't seem to come out with the desired "creamy" rice texture. Overall, though, I enjoyed eating this over two dinners, and it's still worth recommending.

I love this recipe and so do my kids! The only variation that I use is substituting frozen peas for the asparagus and using a full 4 cup container of chicken stock instead of 2 cups to make the rice nice and soft. This is one of my family's go to dinners and usually makes our weekly menu

We really liked this.  When I went to make this I discovered I was out of chicken.  Being 40 miles from a grocery store I used what I had on hand, which was ham.  Also sauted some mushrooms and used ham base for the broth.  Will try it with chicken next time I go to town.

This is only the second time I've made risotto, and it didn't turn out too well. I tried to scale it up for 5 people too. It took a VERY long time to get the rice soft enough and I had to add a LOT more stock. My mom (who's an excellent cook) was kind of hovering around helping and she said I rushed the first part of the stock addition... So, for anyone else who is a beginner risotto maker like me, DON'T RUSH IT!! Otherwise it will end up taking you hours and hours. It didn't taste too bad once it was FINALLY done though, although by then I was sick of the smell of it...

I really liked this recipe, but my husband and kids thought it was just okay.  I made it without reading any reviews first, and it turns out that I had to add another cup and a half of chicken stock (broth).  I later read the reviews to find out that I wasn't the only one!  Anyway, I'll make it again because I LOVE asparagus.
