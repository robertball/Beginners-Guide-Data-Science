I picked this recipe up from a few college friends 2 years ago and have been making it ever since for small hangout get-togethers.  Even though I love this recipe, I have discovered some of the things that make it not go so well. 1) Don't add too much beer, it will ruin the texture and make the flavor really bitter.  2) What type of beer you use makes the dip a hit or success.  Amber Ale and regular light beers have always worked well, but I would avoid wheat beers and stouts.  3) Light cream cheese has a negative effect on the overall flavor and texture as well, but one package light and one package regular seems just about right.

Big hit wherever I go with this!  I add 1 pint of sour cream and we like cheese (hey, we live in Wisconsin) so I usually put in an additional 2 cups of shredded Pepper Jack cheese and adjust the beer accordingly.  DELICIOUS!!!!!!!  People can't stop eating it!

Everyone raved about this all day! So creamy and delicious, and really does go best with pretzels. I tasted it to see with Tostitos, and it just wasn't the same, so continued with pretzels. Every one wants the recipe now, and my husband keeps asking for more! We've had it twice and will be having many more times to come! As of 10/26/06 I have made this numerous times now. My husband even wants it at home quite often and complains when we run out! I didn't take it to a tailgate that we decided to do breakfast for though. I was told that from now on if I don't bring it I would be banned from my own tailgate! Because everyone likes it so much, I now have to times everything by 5 as our tailgate neighbors come over for some too! I've also used various beers to find the perfect one. The best one I've used is Miller Lite. As good as it is already, it was a little better with this. I think I've given this recipe to more people than I have with any other ever! Thank you so very much for the perfect football tailgate dip!

This recipe is a keeper!  I noticed some people had trouble with lumpy cheese.  All you have to do is grate the cheese fine and mix together with the creamcheese in the food processor - let it run until it's smooth.  The beer gives it a great flavor, and we love pretzels.  The husband said, "don't lose that recipe!"

This was gone very fast.  I've made it twice now and it turned out far, far better when I beat the cream cheese for a few minutes before adding anything, and then let it sit in the fridge overnight.  It is good on pretzels or pretty much anything.

I have made a dip similar to this for several get-togethers as well and it's always a hit. A few things I add are, diced cooked bacon and diced green onions. Remember to garnish the final product with some extra cheese, a few pieces of bacon and some of the green onion to make it look extra yummy.

This is my absolute favorite party dip!  We like it served with medium sized honey-wheat pretzel sticks (twists).  I don't measure out the beer, I just pour in until the consistency is to my liking.  It is better the next day so refridgerate overnight.  It also thickens up quite a bit, so take that into consideration when adding the beer.  I use any beer I have on hand, and it varies from cheap brand to well know brands.  It is known that any get-together we have I bring this!!  Very good, Thank You!!!  *Forgot to mention that I add some green onions to the mix also.*

Made this for a Christmas party and served it with those new Fritos scoops... my family liked it, but I had plenty left over.  I added cilantro and dried, minced onion to give it a little more zip.   I'll probably try this one again, maybe adding some green onions next time.

----------Note added later (3/30/02): I discovered that keeping this dip in the fridge a few days really improves the flavor- we really enjoyed the left overs, even better than the first time I served it!    The second time I made this recipe, I added green onions, chilled the mixture overnight, and turned it into a cheeseball by rolling it in chipped beef-- delicious!!

On star: I didn't like the lumpiness of the shredded cheddar cheese (maybe the fine shredded would have been better); taste was very ok. I took this to a party, and word got around that it "isn't that good." I threw it all out, and won't make again. Even my husband, who eats anything not nailed down, didn't like it, and that says a lot. I made it exactly like the recipe, with no changes. I did like the kick from the beer, but there are much better dips out there.

While we do very much enjoy fine craft beers (and some tasty mass produced ones, as well), we, ironically, do NOT like foods cooked w/beer.  This is the exception to rule (perhaps because it's not *cooked*).  Both Mr. LTH and I very much enjoyed this dip served w/pretzel rods and braided honey wheat pretzels.  I used 1/2 ff sour cream and 1/2 1/3less fat cream cheese.  I also added some chives, garlic powder, and crushed red pepper (next time, I think I'll replicate the seasonings in the ranch packet myself).  I used some yummy Sam Adams Octoberfest as my beer and it added great flavor (didn't measure, just added until dip was the desired consistency).  I served this to Mr. LTH's band at a pre-gig get together and they all raved.  TY for a great recipe!

This is a nice, easy recipe to throw together that uses minimal ingredients.  If you are expecting a heavy beer flavor though, you should look for a different recipe.  This beer dip has more of a ranchy cheese flavor, and then you are left with a slight beer aftertaste.  The beer provides only a subtle flavor at the end of the bite, and I even added a little extra poor of beer into mine.  I made mine using Miller Lite and I am serving it with beer bread and the recipe for Cayenne Pretzels on this website (highly recommend them.)  If you want to add more beer into the dip than what it calls for, I would go ahead and do that.  As the dip sits in the fridge, it thickens up, so a little extra beer won't hurt the texture of it all.

always a hit, but works best with crackers.  Comes out a little thick.  I usually need to add more beer.  Always a family favorite.

This is so delicious!!!  I made it last night for our tailgate on Saturday and we can't wait to taste it tomorrow seeing as it is completely delicious right now!  I made a few changes, though.  I doubled the recipe and used 2 cups sharp cheddar and 2 cups pepper jack cheese.  I used fiesta ranch packets to give it more kick and I added more beer than it called for, about 1 and 1/4 C total (I used Miller lite).  I also added green onions and a few dollops of sour cream.  We are serving it with pumpernickle and onion pretzels and honey wheat pretzels .

This was WONDERFUL.  I used a blend of cheeses, only about 1 1/4 cups though.  I think that 2 cups would be too much.  I wanted to try this before I took it to a super bowl party and it was a hit at my house.  I think I would even try it with some crab in it!!

I have been making this for years now and it's always a big hit. I don't measure just dumb until I like the texture. I know for sure that I use more than 1/3 C beer. I shred my cheese fine because the big chunks of shredded cheese don't add anything. I highly recommend this be made the day before the flavors really blend that way and it tastes much better. The key is what pretzels you choose. We have found that the flat pretzel chips taste the best we didn't like the little rods at all.

I made this dip for Easter.  Took into consideration all the tips regarding using finely shredded cheese, using a pale ale beer, adding scallions, making several days ahead.  Made it on Thursday; tried it - not good.  Tried in Friday, Saturday - not good.  Made the mistake of taking it to Easter dinner; came home with the bowl mostly full.  This is bitter, and we did not care for it at all.

I have been making this dip for several years - and I never have left overs!  We can't stop eating it until it is gone, no matter how full we are!  It tastes best if it is made the night before you plan to serve it.  My husband calls this dip "better than sex dip"  'nuff said.

I love this dip, and i really hate beer! who knew! I used to use Hidden Valley brand ranch mix until i realized they use MSG, so I instead tried the Good Seasons garlic and Herb mix.....oh my goodness so much better! It has a deeper, herby, garlicky unctuousness. I also add a dollop of sour cream to make it even creamier.

I brought this to work - everyone LOVED it!  I did make a few variations - added the green onion as previous reviews had done - and I also added spinach (previously frozen).  This is a winner!

Made this for a party where I knew a lot of people liked beer.  This was a HIT!  I made the recipe as is and everyone loved it...including me!

I made this several days ago as a dip and was going to double the recipe, however, I only doubled the CHEESE, I forgot to double the ranch mix and beer.  It turned out really thick, and...well too cheesy, but obviously it was my fault.  However, I made stuffed jalapeno peppers night before last and just used that to stuff the peppers, they were great!  So if you have any left over, add a little more cheese to it, and stuff some peppers.

WOW the ranch packet made this dip sooooo saltyyyy!!  i added more lite cream cheese & lite sour cream to try to make it taste less salty - didn't work, so i added sugar to cut the salt. it's okay.  i'm going to add some onions too. why not?  it looks like an onion dip :)  i wonder if it would be good baked and then served cooled so the cheese won't be in shreds still?  might try that.  anyhoo - just wanted to post that the ranch (hidden valley buttermilk ranch) packet made is super salty!  (at least to me!)

This dip includes every flavor I love with pretzels...ranch, beer, and cheeder and cream cheeses.  I use a bit more beer to make it soft enough to not break the pretzels.  Everyone loves this.

Used close to double the beer it calls for since we didnt like it so thick.  Great flavor and good beer background to the ranch flavor.  Great served with pretzel chips or regular pretzels. Friends and family always enoy it.

There is nothing creamy about this dip and anything softer than a pretzel would not stand up the texture.  We made the mistake of bringing it to a party the day we made it and it was just ok, but after sitting in the fridge for a few days it was really good.  My husband is addicted.

this dip was easy to make and very well received at a party held last night.  all the guests literally raved about it, and at the end my best friend said it better be at every future party we hold.  i used one regular cream cheese and one light, and added 3 minced green onions.  next time i'll add 4 or 5.   and there will be a next time.  had to refill the bowl.  refrigerated overnight after preparing.

Excellent recipe. My friend made it while we camped but she used whipped cream cheese. It was ready in 4 min with no messy utensils. Must use a good beer. Dark beer is not recommended.

Perfect with honey-wheat twisted pretzels.  I didn't feel the need to blend the dip because I like the shredded cheese chunks.

I took this dip to a potluck and everyone couldn't get enough of it. I used a gluten free ale (Green's Amber Ale) because the hostess and many of the fellow party goers are GF and it still tasted delicious. And to top it off, I supplied gluten free pretzels. I would highly recommend this. Just make sure you use a food processor so the cheese doesn't get clumpy.

This is a favorite at our house - even kid friendly!  We like to use pretzels best but if you're looking for a healthier option, try carrots!  I've even spread this on a piece of lunchmeat and rolled it up for a low carb meal!

We tried this once with a strong beer and once with a mild beer and we definitely liked it better with the mild beer. It's good, just not my favorite dip.

I did not care for this dip.  I am glad I only made 1/2 the recipe.  I found it way too salty.  Not much was eaten either so it wasn't just me.  I also added quite a bit of extra beer to try to get the saltiness out but it didn't help.

This was very easy and easily transportable, so it was great to bring to a party. If you like cream cheese, you'll love this. I have made this using both Miller Light and Bud Light, and those are perfect. One time I tried a stronger, darker ale and it just wasn't the right flavor. Keep it cheap, keep it simple.

I made this dip to take to the lake on Memorial Day Weekend and it was the first thing gone!  Definitely a crowd favorite!  I add just a little more beer to get the right consistency.  This is my new "go-to dip"!

Good dip! Needs more beer than called for (my opinion) or it is too thick I used Corona.  I also used dill ranch (it is what I had on hand) and the flavor is great!!  Thanks for the recipe.

I can't comment on how good it is after being chilled because my husband didn't want to wait! We both that it quite delicious immediately after making. If there's any left, I'll taste in a few hours! Easy and quick; definitely will make again.

Good flavor, I did find I needed to add more than 1/2 cup beer to get a consistency that didn't snap the pretzel twists. I used a reduced fat finely shredded cheese, maybe full fat really blends the dip into something more creamy, but no one complained about the extra beer and the cheese flavor wasn't compromised using the reduced fat cheese. Used High Life with good results, tastes as good if not better after sitting a few days: thanks very much for sharing.

By the time a adjusted and tweaked and adjusted this recipe it was very yummy. The recipe as made was very salty and not enough beer taste. I ended up adding another brick of cream cheese and more beer.  My advice  for this recipe is add the ranch mix a little at a time and taste as you go to get the proportions right. I will make it again, but with my changes.

followed another reviewers suggestion and used port wine cheese. Tasted great - the only thing was, given its pink coloration from the port wine cheese, people thought it was a dessert.

Turned out awesome! I heated it on the stovetop to melt then blended the mix until it was a creamy consistency, everyone loved it.

This was a big hit!  The only changes I made was I added green onions and a couple of heaping tablespoons of sour cream to make it easier to dip into.

This dip is a hit at tailgate parties! I have been making dip like this for years but not with the ranch mix it's a plus!!! But I used a lager beer & wise pride cheese it's more of a port wine cheese it adds a TON of great flavors. Don't by cheep cheese!!! I also tried it w/ an Amber beer which also work better

very salty made as is but a good base to start. Once I added 3/4 a container of 16oz reduced fat sour cream it made the dish perfect. So next time I will do one package of cream cheese and 2/3 cup of sour cream. Everyone loved it once I made it less salty.

I made this for a party and it was a hit.  I added the green onions and crumbled bacon and after trying it myself I would never serve it without those two ingredients.  I would also suggest added more beer then the recipe calls for.  I streamed enough in to make the mixture runny, refridgerated it overnight and it was perfect!

This is a great recipe and always a huge hit at parties.  For all of you who didn't like it....you have to use finely shredded sharp cheddar and serve with pretzel rods.  I have never met anyone who doesn't like this and all of my friends use this as a staple for parties!

Not the best recipe. Sorry. It was too much beer and the shreeded cheese didn't look so good. Maybe use less beer and different kind of sharp cheese might be better. I'm not giving up on this receipe. lol. I will try different ingredients!!

This dip is the BEST! Every single time I make it at least one person asks for the recipe - and usually more.  At work they call it creamy crack because it's so addictive. I always use finely shredded extra sharp cheddar, and an IPA for the beer. I serve it with Utz medium size sourdough pretzels. Not too thin, not too thick.

I had 2 dip recipes choices  and couldn't decide so I mixed them together .  Blt dip meet beer dip! I added a cup of mayo and a container of sour cream and fried bacon as well. Holy  it kicked this up a hundred notches . It's an even bigger hit than the plain beer dip which is pretty great . It does need a night to marry a second night is even better ! I also made home made pretzel bites to accompany . Can you say yum!!! I call it Crack dip !!!

Excellent recipe! Great with crackers and pretzels. It is thicker, so if you want it smoother, add a bit more beer. I think adding green onions would be great.  I actually got this recipe from Hilltop Tavern. They have it on their salad bar and served with crackers, pretzels and bread. Yummy!!!

I was unsure of whether or not I'd like this, but I had all the ingredients on hand and decided to make it for a party.  I was wrong to be skeptical because it's delicious! Used half sharp cheddar and half colby jack cheese and threw it together in the food processor.  Will definitely make again!

Good but not great.  Wierd flavors especially straight out of the fridge. Definitly better after it comes closer to room temp.  Pull out of fridge about an hour before serving for best taste.  I would give it 3 1/2 stars if I could.  If you are a real beer lover you will like it if you are just ok with beer may not be your favorite.

Very good. Would be much better with a little less ranch (too salty) and more beer, as it tightens up better than advertised. Good beer is a must.

Simply amazing! Goes great with pretzels or wheat thins. I've tried several kinds of light beer and they all taste great! I use sharp cheddar cheese, which really intensifies the flavor.

I didn't have time to let it sit overnight, so I am not sure how much more the beer taste (used Miller Lite) will come through but I would have liked a little more of that flavor.  All in all, pretty tasty, but not knock my socks off amazing.  If you need something cheap, quick to make and easy I would suggest this though.  Next time I *might* add in a few dashes of hot sauce, just to kick it up a notch.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!  :)

I've made this a couple of times now and absolutely love it.  I've used Samuel Adams Summer Ale and Oktoberfest and both were very good in it.  I think I add more than 1/3 cup, though...probably closer to 1/2 or 3/4 and then let it chill for a couple of hours. The longer it chills, the stronger the beer flavor. Wonderful with pretzels. Thanks for the recipe!

This was tasty, but too.. I'm not sure.  The powdered ranch was just too strong and salty, and even though it tasted good, I felt a bit sick after each bite.  I'll probably make it again (with some tweaks), but my husband loved it as is.

Good Dip with honey pretzel sticks.  I put in 1 cup sharp cheddar & 1 cup regular cheddar.  It was a little too flavorful since the dip itself has so much flavor.  I would stick to all regular cheddar next time.  Also, I softened the cheese & cream cheese in the microwave for 45 seconds & it made it smooth enough to stir & then put it in the refrigerator to harden up.

Everyone who tries this recipe raves!  I never get to take any home, so I've learned to make double and only take half or the family whines.  We love it with pretzels, but my boyfriend and I love it with sour dough bread pieces.  I cut up a bunch, or have the bakery slice small loaves and just pile them up around the platter around the bowl of dip in the middle and let them go.  And boy do they go!!  I also add a little garlic salt to the mix and also just add beer til we like the consistency.  We find that a little thinner with the bread works best.

i make this dip often and very rarely have enoughto go home with. i do always add more cheese but other than that i wouldnt change a thing. i shocked at how many people have never had a beer cheese dip, but are amazed at how good it is. ive memorized this recipe because im asked for it consstanly.

This was easy and tasty. Finely shredded sharp cheddar is a good choice. I add 2-3 green onions, thinly sliced for flavor and appearance. Using 1/2 cup of beer was the perfect consistency IMHO - little stiff straight out of the fridge but after sitting on the buffet table a short time it was the perfect consistency and stayed that way. Was great with any pretzel - regular, honey wheat, butter. Wheat Thins were tasty too. 

Thanks for a great recipe! I tried something else and it was awful so even happier to find this keeper!

I liked this dip a lot.  I read the reviews and decided to use the ingredients listed but add a half cup of sour cream, double the beer (Miller Lite), and add some chives.  It was so good, even right away, despite other reviewers saying that it should sit for several hours.  I "tested" quite a bit of it right away.  I did serve with pretzels and also rye chips, which I preferred hands down.

This was really, really tasty. And quite addictive. Only difference on my end was using homemade ranch dressing, also from this site. Be careful you only make this when you have company....it's NOM.

Very tasty!  Everyone at the BBQ loved it.  I tried it with Soda Pretzels, and they went well together.  The dip I blended in the food processor, and had to use much more than 1/3 cup of beer.  I used about 1/2+ of a bottle.
I've uped this from a 4 to a 5 . . . the dip gets much better with time in the fridge for the flavors to get together!

This was great! I made some bagel chip to dip into it. I microwaved the cream cheese 15 seconds to soften it so I could blend. Also microwaved 20 seconds when the cheese was added so it would mix in better. Yummy! Made Crunchy Bagel Chips from this site.

I made this to try and tide the family over  until Thanksgiving dinner, they all loved it but sadly I never got the chance to try it. The bowl was empty before dinner, next time I will make more. I did add about 1/2cup of sour cream because it was a lil thick, other than that I stuck to the recipe.

I was looking for something different but not too strange to take to a family picnic. It turned out really good. None left. I used finely shredded sharp cheddar, Miller Lite, and served with wheat crackers & 3 different pretzels. Made a really nice tray, will make again. So easy!!!

Somehow I realized too late that the recipe called for 2 PACKAGES of cream cheese instead of 1. I tried to improvise with some left over sour cream (I don’t think it was even a ½ cup) and it came up delicious!! Everyone loved it!!! I had read some reviews stating no to use it with veggies but with pretzels or wheat thins and to tell you the truth.. I liked it better with carrots and celery than the crackers (but I don’t know if it’s because I messed up the ingredients :-). I made this on Friday and we had it on Sunday…no doubt the longer in the refrigerator the better taste! 

Definitely I keeper!

This dip was so quick and easy to make. I took some of the others advice and used finely shredded sharp cheddar cheese and also used a light beer, also used the new Snyders Pumpernickle and onion pretzel sticks. Everyone loved it at the octoberfest! Will be making this again for sure! Thank you so much! : )

I took this dip to a potluck, with odd results.  Most of the women thought it was average and the men thought it was to die for. The guys just scarfed it down. I gave it four stars b/c the women would have rated it a 3 and the men would have given it an easy 5.

We were having a tailgate luncheon at work to celebrate an upcoming football game. Of course we couldn't have the beer so we had the beer dip!!  It was a great hit. Easy and so delicious.

Oh my gawd this dip is a hit everywhere I go. My friends always ask for the recipe and ask that I bring it to the next function.  I use crackers with mine.  I let it sit overnight and have had no problems with kids eating it.

When you overhear someone saying this is exactly how it tasted in Germany, then you know it's a great recipe! I added maybe 2 Tablespoons extra beer and let it sit overnight. Served it with pretzels!

Made this, followed the recipe given.  Next time I will cut the ranch dressing in 1/2.   The ranch was a little over powering.  Overall, very good recipe.  Will also play around with using different cheeses and beer next time.  Used a local brewery brown ale for the beer.

It's delicious, but a tad salty. Next time, I might try adding more cream cheese and/or low-sodium ranch dressing mix(if available anywhere). And maybe a little more beer to go with the extra cream cheese.

The beer and cheddar combine to create an odd bitter taste on the finish. It was the only thing at my party that didn’t get eaten. I really don’t get why people rave about it. Although I will note that many of the positive reviews were by tailgaters who more than likely can’t taste the bitterness if they’ve been drinking beer. Actually, at that point it would taste good.

very easy recipe.  I have made it twice now.  The first time I was not crazy about the texture but everyone LOVED the flavor.  They are having an eclipse party at work tomorrow and asked me to bring this dip again.  Today when I made it it came out smooth, thick and creamy with an amazing flavor.  Not sure what made the difference but wow!  Really Really Good!!  Definitely a keeper!!

This dip is tasty and was SO easy to make! For the beer, I used Montauk Driftwood Pale Ale, which added a nice complexity to the overall flavor. I didn't quite use the full two cups of cheese-- maybe one and a half to one and three quarters. Even with just that much, it seemed like mostly cheese! 

Grabbed some pretzel chips and took this to a work gathering at the beach. People weren't going crazy over it, but it did garner some compliments.

Very Good!  With less beer it would be thicker for a spread.  I used Ranch Popcorn Shaker jar instead of opening a package from ranch dip seasoning.

My husband requests this EVERY week to go along with spicy pretzels.  I have found you have to be sure that the cream cheese is softened by leaving it out on the counter (and not using a store brand, name brand works best from my experience).  Also, the fancy shredded cheddar is better.  I switch up the beer used to give it a different flavor.  My kids love it too!  {there isn't so much beer that the kids would be affected}

My husband and I love this dip!! We have made it exactly as written several times and have shared the recipe with friends. We have used different kinds of beers, and they are all good. The dip works well as a sandwich topping with a pretzel bun. Also good with spicy Cheez-its if you can find them!

This was FANTASTIC!! Highly recommend it! Only suggestion ... don't use the pretzel sticks, shown in the picture.  Hard to get much dip on them - everyone agreed would have been better with regular pretzels.

Well, I've made this a number of times...read the recipe wrong the second time and used 2/3 cup of beer instead of 1/3...I liked it better.  It's kind of salty and I've started using less of the ranch mix.

This recipe is so addicting! I love it with Keebler Flip Side Pretzel Crackers. I made it with Hidden Valley Fiesta Ranch dressing mix and 1/2 cup beer the 2nd time and it was even more amazing! I consider it more of a cheese spread. Definitely better the next day. Great easy recipe!

Using the spicy package of ranch dressing mix give a sharper bite to the taste.  Serving with the flat pretzel crackers is by far the best way to enjoy.  An easy and very good dip for any special event.

Even though I used HALF of the ranch mix like others suggested, this dip was extremely salty...and I love salt.  I used Miller Lite beer.  I checked and checked if I missed something in recipe, but I didn't and I cannot beleive there are more people saying how salty this was.  Unfortunalty, I will not make this again.  Thanks though!

Sorry...this was a major disappointment.  It tasted like plain cream cheese and cheddar...the ranch dressing did not come through nor did any hint of the beer.  I added chives, parsley and a few drops of hot sauce which improved it somewhat but will definitely not make this again.

This recipe is good, but not something I could eat consistently due to the heavy cream cheese flavor. That being said, people raved about the recipe. I made it twice in one week; the first time I followed the recipe exactly and found it tasty, but the second time I added some jalapeno and topped with scallions, and liked the added zest even better. I used a hand beater to mix the cream cheese and shredded cheese, and didn't have a problem with lumpiness. I used Miller Lite, and found that to be appealing.

I made this for a tailgate yesterday and it was a HUGE hit.  In fact, when I left, I was asked to leave the dip!  I used other recommendations and mixed very well so it wouldn't be lumpy.  I also added about 1/4 cup of sour cream to readuce lumps.  I used a simple Bud Light for the beer and chilled overnight.  I served with the thick pretzel sticks and it was great!  Will definitely make again- very easy!

Always a crowd pleaser when I show up with this dip.  There is one bad review on this list - but if you use an immersion blender there are no lumps and the dip is nice an smooth in texture.  This dip is even good on a bagel!

I made this for an Oktoberfest party, it was a hit! I did add some sour cream to make the dip less lumpy.

Hello! My fiance & I were invited to our friends house this eve. to watch the OSU vs. USC football game on their big screen TV. I wanted to bring something festive to munch on. Since my fiance bought a 12-pack of Goose Island Honkers Ale, I thought it made sense to use some of it in this dip. While I liked this (my fiance didn't, but he does not care for cream cheese dips), I didn't love it. For one, I could barely detect a beer taste. I whipped this up earlier today, so it hardened up a bit in the fridge (not rock hard, but firmer than I would have liked). B4 my fiance & I left for the game, I zapped the dip (in a Gladware container) in my 850-watt micro. for ~ 1 min. to soften it up & then add. almost another 1/3 c. beer (it will appear "liquidy," but don't panic - it will blend perfectly). I could taste a little more of the beer at this point, but it was still very subtle. For those of you wondering if you can "lighten" this up, yes you can! I used 1 block regular/1 block red.-fat cream cheese, red.-fat cheddar & low-sod. ranch mix. I honestly couldn't tell this was "semi" low-fat. Oh, and if you are wondering how to soften your cream cheese w/o melting it, try micro. in 15 sec. intervals (it took me exactly 1 min. to reach a perfect "mixable" consistency). All in all, this was tasty, it went well w/ pretzel rods for "dunking" & was extremely easy to prepare. Would I make it again though... probably not (there's not enuf flavor, IMHO). Thx. for sharing anyways, Michaeleen

This is a really good dip. I was a little apprehensive at first but it turned out great. I bought a really good loaf of onion, potato and dill bread and a loaf of asiago cheese bread to go with.

Ive been wanting to make this recipe for a while and finally realized I had the stuff for it in my pantry and fridge. This was pretty good. I used a wheat beer and sharp cheddar cheese. This is VERY good with pretzels. This might be nice warm....all ooey and gooey. I might try that next time. Thanks for the recipe! :)

I have been making this for several years & I have given out the recipe more times than I can count. Very easy to mix by hand if the ingredients are at room temp. Refrigerate for several hours, or preferably overnight.  Serve at room temp. for best flavor. I only serve it with the mini pretzels or the square ones.

This is a great dip that's very flexible and can go with a lot of different food items. I personally like to make it with Guiness and eat it with tortilla chips, but when I make it for others, I usually use Amber Bock or Blue Moon and serve it with some medium-thick pretzels. It is a little bit hard after refrigeration, but it's perfect once it's softened at room temperature for a few minutes.

I followed the recipe as is, refrigerating for 3 hrs but it was a little hard, so we microwaved it until soft. It was also salty-must be from the ranch dip b/c no salt was added?  I won't make it again.

Great recipe. I modified to try to reduce the fat by using 1/3 reduced fat cream cheese and added one cup of fat free sour cream. I also added 2 chopped green onions and some crushed red pepper.

Made this for the super bowl.  It was pretty good!  I used Heineken dark lager because the store was all out of New Castle.  Next time I want to try it with New Castle or Budweiser for sure.

I enjoyed the dip, but it was more cheese than beer.  I used a Newcastle brown ale, and I think next time I'll use something with more kick (a pale perhaps).  I took others' suggestions and melted the cheeses to make it creamier - I'm not sure I'd like it the other way.

This was very good and pretty easy.  I added some dried diced onion which added a nice flavor.  I used Miller Lite for the beer which was great, I think a stronger beer would have been a bit dominating.  The recipe made a lot more dip than I expected.  I made it for the big game tonight - I served some hot (microwaved for 1-2 minutes) and some cold, and had toasted french bread, baked soft pretzels, and regular hard pretzels as dipping options.  My first preference was the french bread with the soft pretzels as a close second, and then the hard pretzels (but I don't generally eat them much, so it's probably personal preference).  I actually liked the warm dip better than the cold as well.  A nice standard dip for game nights!

TOO SALTY. The flavor is spot on but the salt is way too heavy. I think next time I will use .5 oz of the ranch mix. I cannot believe no one else commented on how salty this recipe is and I like salt

Warning- this is addictive! My coworkers couldn't stop eating it. I was a bit weary to try this, because I tried another version of beer dip from this site, which bombed terribly. For the beer, I used Amstel Light, which I don't drink, but it was the only thing in the fridge. I think it tasted fabulous for this dip! I was so pleased that this recipe succeeded, but disappointed I brought home an empty dish. I'll be making this again, thank you!

We made this for Monday night football and it was well received. Next time I will shred my cheese a bit finer, since the big chunks made the texture a bit off. Everyone wanted the recipe.

This is th best dip!  I often make it for parties and there is never any left over.  I stir in some chopped fresh chives.  I also add some as a garnish.  I serve it with small pretzels.

The taste of this dip is unique and wonderful. I couldn't get enough of it and neither could some of my guests.

I will be making this dip for many parties to come. The beer really made the dip.

Thanks so much!

I liked this dip we took it our friends and it was my first time trying and or eating it so I told them they were my guinea pigs and they loved it. But as I was just going on to write this review I realized I completely forgot the cheddar cheese...  :( But it was good just the same. I did add double beer and mixed it in the processor. Next time I will have to make it the way it is written, how I screwd up something so easy I will never know.. But it ended up gone even without the cheese.

I have made this twice now for parties and it was a big hit both times. I added green onion and used Sam Adams one time and Firestone Double Barrel Ale the second. I can't imagine this would be as flavorful with something like Bud or Coors. Also, you absolutely have to let it chill for at least 4-5 hours to achieve its serving consistency. Served with mini pretzels.

I took this recipe to an office party and 1/2 of it didn't get ate.  Some people really liked it, but they said it is an acquired taste.  I love beer but not beer dip.  I won't make again.

This dip was pretty good!  I bought twisted pretzel sticks, which I preferred over normal pretzel twists.  My boyfriend actually liked eating the dip with tortilla chips.  His brother liked eating it with his finger! haha  I probably won't make this dip again because it wasn't anything too spectacular.

This is an absolutely wonderful and easy dip that makes a ton! It is great with pretzels and/or crackers. After the first time making it, I thought I would like a little more of the seasoning so the second time I used a pack and a half of the ranch dressing mix. MUCH BETTER. I also agree it is a better consistency with the fine shred cheddar.

I've made it several times---exactly as the recipe states----I do use finally shredded Cheddar; and I always make sure I refrigerate it overnight.  Always a hit and it can't be any easier to make.

My mother in law first introduced this to me and we LOVE it! It's best after it has "set up" overnight.  We serve this with pretzels which absolutely compliments all of the flavors.

This dip is fantastic and dangerously addictive.  I think the reason for any negative reviews is what people are dipping.  This dip does not work with veggies or with potato chips.  With pretzels, pita, or sausage bites, it is a match made in heaven.

I love this and have made this dip for many parties.  I add chopped green onions.  YUM!!!! (Don't forget to let this sit out a little bit before you serve it--it is a little hard right out of the fridge and breaks the crackers!)  :)

This was a hit at my last party.  So easy and is made ahead of time.  Trader Joe's in our area carries pretzels that are a little thicker than usual stick pretzels, that worked well for dipping.  This would be kid friendly with alcohol-free beer.

This dip has a strong ranch flavor but not bad. We ate it with not only pretzels, but also crackers.  Very  tasty.
