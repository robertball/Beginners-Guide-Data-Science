You've got to try this recipe. I made a few changes. On the advice of other reviews I sauteed the onions along with garlic(love garlic) before adding the stems. I doubled the recipe and added 5 strips of bacon(low sodium) and a tablespoon of finely chopped red bell pepper. I used only half of the amount of monterey jack cheese, exact amount of dill and all jumbo lump crab(about 20 oz). I also added about double the amount of white wine(pinot grigio)and butter to the tray. EVERYONE wants this recipe. They were delicious.

I used a mix of Gruyere and aged sharp chedder instead of monterrey jack.
I prepared the mushrooms the night before.I sliced the butter into cubes & microwaved it until it was melted. I dipped each mushroom cap into the melted butter. I accidentally added wine to the stuffing.So,I added the entire 16 oz of crabmeat. I shredded the gruyere and chedder with the other ingredients, & stuffed the mushrooms. I put them in the fridge overnight. I baked them in the white wine, and they were wonderful. However...one day later, I found out something else that makes them even better. 
I baked them in the oven at 400 degrees. I wasn't ready to eat them when they were done, so I left them in the oven, & turned the oven off.2 hrs later I was ready to eat them, but they were cold.I put the pan in the microwave for 2 minutes and re-heated them. 

Well...OH MY GOD!!!!! They were incredible...I thought I had died and gone to heaven when I just ate them.It seems that they are best if you bake them, let them cool,then re-heat them just prior to serving them. Adding wine to the stuffing mixture, and marinating overnight makes a difference also. The first time I served them, they were cooked, but the inside portion of the mushrooms were still white, although soft and warm. When I baked them tonight, let them sit, and then re-heated them...I ended up with that really nice soft, brown, totally immersed in butter mushroom through and through...and the crabmeat stuffing really popped.

I tried to find a crab stuffed mushroom recipe after eating at Ruth's Chris steak house where they had amazing crab stuffed mushrooms. This recipe was just like it!! I made them as an appetizer for thanksgiving and everyone loved them. Next time they will get the spot light a little more. I added more garlic to the crab mixture and it really brought out the flavor.

One word to describe...YUMMMMMMMMM!
This was really good. Even my fiance who doesnt like mushrooms loved it. I did however make a few changes. I used imitation crab meat, added 3 large cloves of garlic and sauteed in butter with the green onion and added salt, garlic powder & pepper. I also used whole wheat bread chopped up finely. The dill is a must. I usually don't care for dill too much but it was excellent in this dish. Also the Jack Cheese is a MUST! I also used medium size portabello mushrooms and used chicken broth in place of the wine. I also put Monterey Jack on the top and Baked for about 20 minutes then broiled for a few minutes to make the top nice and crispy! mmm thanks!

How anyone could have given this recipe 5 stars is beyond me.   While they were easy to make, they had no flavor whatsoever.

Excellent recipe!  I doubled the recipe and brought it to a party with several of my girlfriends, and they were gone FAST!  I made a few revisions, per other readers' reviews:  I added 1/3 of a red pepper (finely minced), added some fresh garlic (which I sauteed with the butter and green onions, before adding the stems).  I used fresh dill weed, from my garden - fresh herbs make such a big difference in the end result!  And I added a few dashes of Original Mrs. Dash.  I think next time, I will not add any cheese to the bread crumb mixture - I'll just put it on top.  These turned out wonderful, and they were the hit of the party!  Everyone is still raving about them, thanks!

Excellent! Made these for dinner guests and everyone really enjoyed them! Followed the recipe to the "T" using 1 can of white crab meat. Made 30 medium sized mushrooms with this and could've filled another 2 or 3. Next time I make these I'll add some fresh chopped garlic and saute it with the onion for a little extra kick! These are definitely restuarant quality. One suggestion would be to fill the shrooms first then just place them in the melted butter and move 'em around to get them coated otherwise they get too slippery to handle.

Reading the reviews, I actually feel kinda bad for the submitter cuz all the reviews start "great recipe after i basically changed every ingredient in it."  
I always make the recipe as close to exact as possible to be fair before making changes to it.   I was surprised at the omission of garlic too, but wanted to try it as written.  The mushrooms turned out delicious even with out bacon, garlic, or all the other ingredients everyone else seems to think they need. The stuffing was easy to make and they looked beautiful when the cheese got golden and bubbly.  The hubby and I fought over the last one!! 

So, maybe next time a sliver of garlic or two, but then again, maybe not. I liked the recipe as written.

These were very good. I added chopped jalepeno, garlic and a little salt. It took
longer to make than I thought it would. I doubled the recipe and all were gone in 
a very short time.

I stuck pretty closely to the recipe, only using fresh dill and crushed garlic croutons for the bread crumbs, and I liked the flavor they contributed.   I did find the wine kind of pointless. I would call these good, but not memorable, and given the price of crab, I wanted these to be memorable.

This recipe is just plain yummy! I added a touch of salt, roasted red peppers, & used canned white crab meat.  Hope you enjoy this recipe as much as my family did.

I love stuffed mushrooms.  Used 2 cans of lump crabmeat cause it's WAY more flavorful then white crabmeat, Italian breadcrumbs and more melted butter.  I'll probably try garlic with the onions next time to check out how that tastes.  Man, I started popping them things like Tic-Tacs when they came out the oven.

These were fantastic!  Truly the best stuffed mushroom recipe I've come across yet. (I've made several over the years)They make a nice presentation and for those who claim not to like seafood, they might not realize they are even eating crabmeat. A real keeper!

These were delicious. So yummy, they were gone in a flash. I used canned white crab for the filling. I also added the white wine to the filling instead of putting it in the pan. This was a happy accident because it totally worked! Only thing that's absolutely lacking from this recipe is salt. I ended up adding quite a bit of salt to the filling, a bit of pepper, and even a few dashes of hot sauce before the flavor finally popped.

I jsut got done eating these and they are phenominal! I used a mucato wine because I thought the slight sweetness would compliment the crab and it did! I also used an Italian cheese blend, but just a great recipe overall!

When I made this recipe, the mushrooms didn't need to bake for a full 20 minutes; They were done after about 12.  I used canned crab meat, which is inexpensive.  PLEASE don't use "imitation" crab, as this changes the flavor of this recipe.

I get rave reviews every time I make these.  This is just like the appetizers you order out, my husband says better!  These are wonderful!  I don't use the dill or the wine, mostly I don't have it on hand.  I use immitation crab meat and I only shred the cheese that goes in the stuffing mix.  I place a small chunk of cheese on top of each mushroom, that way it doesn't fall all over the pan.  This makes many mushrooms.  These are a special treat we absolutely love them.  Thanks for the wonderfully easy recipe.

Oh my gosh, these are the best stuffed mushrooms I have ever made. I used Pepper Jack Cheese to spice it up, we like food a little spicer.  Even our son who doesn't like mushrooms loved them.  So, so good you won't be disappointed

After carefully reading other reviews, I followed the recommendations to perk up the flavor since the most common complaint was blandness.  I used premium crab meat, used fresh breadcrumbs (one slice of bread, crusts removed equals 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs, btw), finely chopped red pepper, etc.  Anyway, no matter what you do, these cannot be saved from blandness.

What a tasty treat!! I substituted grated parmesean cheese for the jack, added fresh cracked black pepper and 1/2 tsp sea salt, and some sauteed pressed garlic (2 cloves). I also omitted the dillweed because I don't enjoy that flavour. I used freshly cooked king crab meat, and topped stuffed mushrooms with a small drizzle of hollandaise sauce. They were great.

These mushrooms are a new must have at our family gatherings.  They were a HUGE hit! I did add 2 tbsp minced garlic, onion salt and garlic powder to the pan & fried it all together.  Other than that they were wonderful!  I was nervous about the wine but they complimented the mushrooms wonderfully!

So Yummy!  Everyone just loved these.  So good and easy to make.  The only thing I changed was that I used chicken broth instead of white wine as I didn't have any wine on hand.

These were really tasty & easy.  Trader Joe's has the best canned crabmeat.  I also threw in a little cream cheese for good measure, and used parmesean cheese (all I had on hand).

I made these for a New Year's Eve party.  YUMMMMMMM!  After reading some of the other reviews, I did make a couple of changes.  I added about 1/3 of a 8 oz. brick of cream cheese, added a healthy dash of Worchestershire sauce, a bit of cayenne pepper.  I also dipped the mushrooms in the melted butter.  I filled 44 mushrooms with this recipe.  They were great.  Next time I will also had garlic.  I did miss it here and can't believe I didn't add any.  I always add garlic.  I will also use red pepper flakes, instead of cayenne.  I also made these the night before as others have stated.  I think it would be great made with sausage too.  My husband said they were the best!  Thanks La Vaun for this recipe.  You did good!  :)

Savory means full of flavor and these didn't have it.  This time, I cut the bread crumbs in half and added all the cheese to the mixture.  I topped them with finely grated paremsan reggiano.  I also added two small cloves of finely chopped garlic - upped the green onion to include the green tops to 4 TBS.  Fresh ground pepper and a dash of hot tabasco.  And NEVER EVER substitute with fake Krab - that's blasphemy.  If you're going to all the trouble to make these make a lasting impression and use the real McCoy.  My mother-in-law makes a similar recipe but uses brie cheese and no bread crumbs in hers.  They are a buttery delight!  This is a good basic recipe to begin, but there are way too many bread crumbs in it for filler when you really don't need them.  The mushroom cavity holds the stuffing together.

This is a great recipe.  Just served this at a party last night and it was a hit!  Several people asked for the recipe too.  I did add some alterations, I added some minced garlic when sauteing the mushroom stems and green onion.  I also added a few dashes of worchestershire sauce to the final mix before stuffing the mushroom caps for a bit of kick.  Very good overall.

I made these as part of a main course for dinner about a week ago. I put them over basil pesto angelhair pasta, they were a huge success. Very good, I added a lot of parm to the final presentation but we are total cheeseheads at my house. The extra was eaten the next day for lunch and kept really well over night in a plastic container. I can't add anything to this recipe. It's really good the way it is.

NOW THIS IS A STUFFED MUSHROOM RECIPE!!Much better than a recent recipe I tried from the site.Didn't have the dill, used a blend of 4 different cheeses (mont. jack,cheddar,etc.)also added salt & chopped garlic clove to the butter for filling.Placed stuffed mushrooms in pan & poured melted butter over top of them.Used the total amount of shredded cheese in the filling , none on the top.

This was the hit at the family christmas party. The first platter was gone in 2 minutes max. It was the only dish that was completely gone and  I tripled this recipe.

Yummy!  I did tweak it though.  Used shrimp instead of crab (diced), used yellow onion instead of green (again, diced), used chedder cheese (diced) IN the stuffing, then topped it with mont jack while baking.  Put some white wine in the dish while baking and it made the mushroom caps really flavored!!  My husband told our friends, '... and we spend $10 for these at Perry's (a local steakhouse) and hers are just as good.'

Excellent recipe!  Served them for a wine and cheese dinner party and decided to add these amazing mushrooms to the menu.  My guests were so glad I did.  I did add wine to the stuffing mix to keep it moist and it added so much more of a gourmet flavor to the recipe.  I did what one review mentioned and made them the day before and had them marinate overnight fully made and soaking in the wine/butter mixture.  I added monteray jack cheese on top.  Baked them in advance and let them sit for a while before serving. Had rave reviews on this recipe.

Very disappointed in this recipe.  Very bland and just blah.  It did nothing to compliment or  highlight the crab.  I used king crab and followed as directed.  I feel like I wasted some very expensive ingredients. I'll try another recipe the next time. Sorry.

These were very bland. I followed the recipe exactly as posted, but found them to have more of a bread crumb flavor than anything else. I will not be making these again.

Delicious but oh so sinfull with all the butter... Note: Dill is the perfect spice for this, dont substitute, as well as the Montery Jack cheese is required- when I was forced to substitute motzarella cheese, it was not nearly as good.

This recipe was great. Very easy and delicious. The only change I did was use fresh dill. Just make sure you buy large stuffing mushrooms, as it yields a lot of filling. Excellent.

These are great! I started snacking on them as an appetizer and half of the pan was gone in about 20 mins. AWESOME! Easy to make too. I premade the filling and refrigerated it until right before I stuffed the mushroom caps. A+

After seeing the great reviews, I was eager to make these.  I now realize that many of the "5 star" reviews are written by cooks who altered the recipe - not terribly accurate!  I followed the directions but felt that they were definitely bland - I would add more seasoning next time.  Also, the mushrooms were not done and the whole thing was kind of watery.  Next time, I think I will sauté the mushroom caps briefly in perhaps garlic butter before stuffing them to allow for some of the water in the caps to evaporate.

I don't get it.  I love crab, like mushrooms, but this was tasteless! Seriously.  Glad I didn't waste a whole pound of crab on it.  It was flat, weird textured, and boring.  Seriously bummed.  I made it exactly as written, even though a big part of me wanted to change/add something.  I'm a good cook, but wouldn't waste the ingredients trying to improve this one.  To initial poster, I'm sorry, I wanted to love it, but it just didn't work.

I was trying to find an appetizer that wouldn’t kill my Weight Watcher points. I calculated that these were 2 points per serving – which is high, but they were worth it. I just had to take a longer walk the next day. I liked the dill. I think next time I might add a touch more.

So good!  I made this exactly as called for but I used a combination of cheddar/jack and it was great.  I ended up having a lot more filling left over so next time I will buy more mushrooms - but I cooked it in a dish and used it as a dip, so it didn't go to waste.  I did take the advice of others and made these the morning before the party, then heated them up in the microwave and they were perfect!

Absolutely delicious! You do need at least double the butter in the baking dish to coat the mushrooms. I also left the dill out but that's just a personal preference as I think dill is vile, I tossed in some parsley to compensate. My husband loved them too!

These are a really good base recipe, but I gave it 4 stars because it needed modifications.  I added more seasoning (fresh minced garlic, oregano, salt and pepper) and added 1/4 tsp more dill (otherwise it is hardly noticeable). I also added 2 TB of cream cheese to give it a richer, creamier texture. Make sure to use quality crabmeat to avoid any "fishy" taste.

These were a big hit at our Thanksgiving dinner.  Personally, I think they would be better with a 1/2 block of cream cheese added to the filling, but they were gone so fast, its hard to say!

This recipe is really not great at all.  It's not disgusting, but lacks any flavor and is messy compared to other stuffed mushroom recipes.  If you're going to use this recipe, you will need to doctor it up somehow.

Made these with leftover crabmeat from steamed crabs we had and they were very good.  Happened to be out of white wine and had to substitute chicken broth which worked out fine.  Also the crabmeat I used had 'Old Bay Seasoning' on it because of how it was cooked, this actually perked up the recipe.  I have tried other stuffed mushroom recipes on this site and this is the one we like the best.

I read the reviews and the majority of people rated this well so I made it for a special occasion and they were very bland. Basically they tasted like baked mushrooms. Someone wrote they can't be saved but I think if I made them again I could make them taste decent. I would cut the mushroom stems in the stuffing recipe down to about 1/4th cup. I would add triple the cheese. I would also saute garlic and yellow onions in the green onion/mushroom stem part of the recipe. I think that would do the trick. I will have to try it someday and let everyone know. However, I am all mushroomed out at the moment.

Followed this recipe with the exception of replacing the dill with fresh pressed garlic. Not a big fan. Hardly any got eaten at a New Years Eve gathering, but they did taste better the second day though.  Needs more than just a few changes to make this recipe better than okay.

These were amazing!  I made them for Thanksgiving appetizers.  My picky husband first turned his nose up and said crab and mushrooms don't go together, but promptly ate 9 of them once they came out of the oven.  MIL raved about them too!  Thanks for the recipe.

This was absolutely delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly as written (w/the exception of cooking in wine) and it was exceptional.  I'll definitely be making this one again.

Made these for a family get-together and everyone loved them.  I made a few slight changes (hints that I got from the other reviews).  I used imitation crab meat instead of real crab, I did not grate the cheese for the topping as leaving it in one piece made it stay on easier, and I did not add the wine to the dish when baking.  I will definitely make these again.

These are awesome! My husband doesn't like green onions so we put the stems, garlic, and a little white onion in the food processor and then sauteed in the butter. We also added a little salt and just used some canned crab meat. Restaurant quality if i do say so myself, hehe. Thanks!

I thought these were very good! They were a last minute add on to our anniv. dinner and I didn't have jack so I used cheddar. My husband like them, but asked that I leave the cheese out next time. So we will try with them with no cheese also.
This is going in my favorites! Thanks!

My husband and I hosted a Christmas dinner party and we used this recipe without testing it first.  We were a little nervous, but they got rave reviews and they were all gone, nothing else we made was all gone.  These have a wonderful flavor.

I love this!!! I did add garlic and white wine to the stems and green onions. I also doubled the butter and wine in the baking pan. I did omit the dill as I do not like it. This is a keeper and will be made for holidays and oh heck any day! I have 4 children the youngest 16, and a granddaughter and sunday is a great day as they all come to see mom! This will be an addition to our sunday dinner at least once a month, maybe more!

I used smaller baby portobellos, garlic salt, and a mix of a finely shredded Italian cheese blend (instead of the Monterey jack).  Then, I left out the dill and the wine.  It was delish!

This recipe is is very easy (especially coming from someone who is not very good in the kitchen), and the ingredients blended very nice together.  Next time I'd probably add shredded carrots and in place of the chopped mushroom stem, I'd use chopped onions.  Overall, great idea & much success.

This recipe is delicious! I omitted the green onions and used a cheddar cheese mix I had left over from taco night. I also stuffed a couple of Roma tomatoes because I ran out of mushrooms and it was so good. This is a great way to use left over crab legs. I almost made a crab dip but I'm so glad I didn't. Thanks for the recipe!

Made this as an appetizer for a huge spaghetti potluck for friends and family. It got rave reviews! Everyone loved it! I took the advice from some other reviews and added 3 cloves of garlic when sauteing the mushrooms and onion. I also used colby jack cheese. Wonderful recipe!

This was the huge hit at my x-mas party.  They went so fast I barely got a change to taste it, lol.  I ended up making a second batch couple days later for a brunch.  The second time around, I omitted the wine on the bottom of the pan, and I must say that I liked it better that way. imo, the wine made the bottom of the mushrooms kind of slimy. Also,  fresh crabmeat is a must.  Yummy!

I made these a second time and they turned out better. I think it needs garlic. I meant to add it but forgot. Will make again but add some garlic as it needed some flavoring. I didn't really taste the dill at all.

I made these several hours earlier just to get a lot of prep work done.  When they came out of the oven they were simply ok.  I refrigerated them until time to serve, popped them in the microwave to reheat, and there was a definite difference in taste/texture.  They were great and everyone raved.  The only thing I did different was add garlic and used a combo bag of preshredded colby and jack cheeses.  Oh and one more thing, and they needed a good shake of salt and pepper after baking.

The mushrooms were delicious. We used imitation crab meat and tomato garlic Monterey Jack cheese. We omitted the lemon juice. Also, we had closer to thirty small to medium sized mushrooms and there was plenty of stuffing. We put the extra in a ramekin, topped it with more cheese and baked it. We will definitely make these again.

These were very good.  As with most things the taste reflects the quality of the ingredients.  I'd highly recommend using Gruyere (or similar cheese) instead of Monterey Jack and use real crab, not imitation.

I left out the egg, lemon juice, crab, and dill, and instead substituted a block of cream cheese.  Also sauteed chopped mushroom stems with a little onion and garlic before adding to filling mixture.  Filling holds together great and is rich and creamy.  I used 3 small boxes of mushrooms and could have used some more, since I still had filling left over.  Instead I put leftover filling on a little piece of rye bread with a little cucumber and some dill on top for tea sandwiches.  Two-for-one!

I made this recipie, with some variations for my own taste, for a Valentines supper and my bf and I both loved them, the filling was so good you could eat it plain.  They turned out phenominal, we thought they tasted as good as the ones we order at Red Lobter.

These caps were absolutely delicious! I did not use the egg, added garlic and onion, more seasonings and grated asiago cheese in lieu of the jack. Wonderful and thanks!

these were good, but not great.  I think it was the egg that made gave them a bit of a strange texture... a little puffy and not dense enough.  However, we ate them and enjoyed them anyways !

This is pretty much a flawless recipe. Dill weed is optional in my opinion. People go NUTS over these stuffed mushrooms.

These were a hit at my holiday party. Every year we have an appetizer buffet with champagne and wine service.These were great. I threw in some minced garlic during the saute process.

Tasty. I used chopped baby shrimp instead of crab, bread crumbs from a can like you purchase in the baking isle at the grocery store, shredded Mexican blend cheese, and maderia wine. Even with all those substitutions it still turned our delicious. I prepared 8 mushrooms for my husband, my son and I and that was the perfect amount.

These were a pretty good starting point, but they needed a little more flavor.  I added garlic (we love garlic) and some Pampered Chef dill mix.  I also put in a little extra wine to the pan, and even a little in the stuffing.

This recipe was pretty easy to make, but definitely needs some different seasoning, maybe salt, garlic salt??  Anyway, it was good, just season it a bit more and  you'll be good to go.

These mushrooms got rave reviews at my party and several begged for the recipe. I sauted a clove of garlic with the green onions and added 1t. of LaMar's Famous Seasoning which I use on just about everything. I also used pepperjack cheese to spice them up. Sometimes we just eat these for a meal. Very yummy!

I made this appetizer as written, it yielded 29 mushroom caps, and served it at a family function.  The comments were that it was "ok".  I have to agree with another reviewer who commented the recipe was bland, it really did lack flavour.  It wasn't bad, just lacked that extra something.  I do however think its a great idea, easy to make and worth making again with a little tweaking on spices. I would recommend to any first-time makers of this recipe to add some sort of kick to the mixture. I'll figure out what and re-comment

Just tried this recipe and I love it. I live in Oregon and just back from the coast crabbing and wanted to try the stuffed mushrooms. I'm a big fan of the oneS at Red Lobster and this recipe is better!! Will definately make them again. For the bread crumbs I used Italian seasoned crumbs and also used a jack/chedder cheese mix. How anyone can give less than 5 stars is beyond me!!! TERRIFIC!!

I used olive oil, unsalted butter, seasoned bread crumbs, as a difference because of not having supplies. Very juicy if cooked right and delicious flavors.

This is my first attempt at making stuffed mushrooms. Good recipe. As written, recipe would be a little bland. I added 1/4 tsp thyme & oregano to the crab mix and some fresh garlic to the onion/stems mixture in the pan. For the future I would recommend salting the mushrooms when you are coating them in the buttered dish. These were quite tasty and definately worth the time. I could have gotten 36 mushrooms with the stuffing mixture, because I had some left. Next time I may try using larger mushrooms, because they were rather difficult to work with being medium size. Also, the leftovers were better than fresh out of the oven. If you don't need them right away, refrigerate and enjoy the next day! Thanks for the recipe!

I thought these mushrooms were good and easy to make but fairly bland (I didn't use the dill weed and that could be why but I did not have any on hand). I did add several minced cloves of garlic to the green onion and stem saute and added salt, pepper and garlic seasoning. Next time I will make sure to get and use the dill to see if I can warrant 5 stars.

These were just o.k.  They definitely need something more because they were on the bland side.  I did add fresh garlic as suggested. Maybe adding mayo? Not sure if i will be follwing this recipe again.. Sorry..

This is an excellent recipe. The only change I made was to sprinkle sea salt on the bottom of the pan and decrease white whine by half.  It gave it a lot more flavor! Will make this again.

This was a really great appetizer. I used large portobellos. Everything came out great. I didn' thave white wine but still enjoyed them. If i were serving this to a crowd I would have opted for fresh crab over canned crab which I used tonight.

I served this as an appetizer at a dinner party of five. In retrospect, it is far to filling to be an appetizer and it so potent in flavor that it really dimmed out the main course of almond allspice fish I served after. This is good for a party, but don't serve it as an appetizer.

These were delicious!! The only change I made was in how they were cooked: I sprayed the caps with cooking spray and baked them in the oven for 5 minutes before stuffing them.

This would be way better with real crab, but I always buy the crab in the pouch because it's cheaper. I tried it with pepper jack once and it was better than monteray jack cheese, though.

Delicious! I also added some chopped spinach and artichoke hearts, along with a bit of cream cheese.  This is the way I had been making it for years, but never measured anything (the ol' Italian way!).

These were great. The only change I made was I sprayed my pan and shrooms with PAM. I still added white wine (mine was lemon flavored) and used mozzerella b/c it's what I had on hand. These were so wonderful. I really overstuffed them and added more crab than recipe called for. Thanks so much:-)

These were quite tasty.  I followed the recommendation of preparing and letting them marinate overnight.  I made a couple that night and the rest the next day to taste the difference.  Marinating overnight made them way better! Leaving them in the oven to cool and then heating them in the microwave made them taste better too.  It was great because I took them somewhere for Thanksgiving so I prepared them the night before cooked and cooled them in my oven then all I needed to do was pop them in the microwave at the house I was at and they were hot, tasty, and ready to eat. I did a couple things different like fresh garlic and put a little white wine in the stuffing. They didn't give me that wow taste I was hoping for which may have been due to the wine in the stuffing I didn't personally like the flavor the wine gave them but everyone enjoyed them and there was nothing left! I also mixed all the cheese in the stuffing; I thought that would work better with all the cooking and reheating they went through.

Brilliant! I substituted water for white wine, but the recipe still turned out wonderful. I also substituted seasoned bread crumbs which gave it a little more flavor. The mushrooms had the perfect tenderness. Overall this recipe was a success!

i also added some fresh garlic, diced red pepper and chopped leeks instead of the scallion. i also used some half and half to moisten up the mixture. it makes them extremely moist and makes the stuffing nicely packed. and i also added about a tablespoon of old bay to the stuffing mixture. yummy! i liked the addition of the wine as i had never tried that before while baking them.

These were a great hit at a recent party - everyone commented on how good they were.  I enjoyed them too, but thought perhaps they needed a little extra something, perhaps a little garlic.  I used canned crabmeat.  I will definintely use this recipe in the future.
Update:  When I made this again, I minced fresh garlic and sauteed in the butter, which added alot more flavor.

These were good - but not great.  We followed the recipe exactly (but omitted the dillweed) and used king crab. We preferred them with a complimentary sauce rather than alone, and we enjoyed them, but thought the crab was overwhelmed by the cheese and mushrooms, and they lacked flavor besides. Next time we will use less mushroom and cheese and play around with seasonings. Thanks!

Fantastic appetizer!!! The bottoms were still a bit soggy from the wine baste at the bottom of the tray so I recommend having a serving plate/tray with some paper towels ready for when they come out. I garnished with some Garlic Powder and a dash of red pepper for a special ping. . .

We pretty much stuck to the recipe, only we didn't use the wine and we used imitation crab meat and these turned out wonderfully!  They were delicious and were a hit at our dinner party.  I will certainly make these again.

These were very good but I did a little tweaking. I sauteed the mushrooms in butter and garlic oil before putting them in the pan. I used Panko(Japanese)breadcrumbs because they are lighter. The presentation was very nice, my husband and son loved them...thanks

This was my first attempt at stuffed mushrooms but they turned out great! I would use a little less crabmeat next time - the crab taste overpowered the cheese and mushroom tastes. These were easier to arrange than I had imagined.

These came out pretty awesome. Just a few things I added...sauteed a tiny bit garlic with the onions and lemon sauce and added salt and paorika to the mixture to give it a little needed taste/kick.  I also wont add the white wine to the pan next time as they were a little too mushey for my taste. Even my grandma loved them and shes hard to impress!

I made these for a christmas get-together. While the mushrooms had great flavor and were cooked perfectly, the crab was a bit too masked, and didn't shine like I had hoped it would. All around, though, a nice dish.

Maybe I did something wrong, but I thought these mushrooms were bland. They tasted like tuna (it could have been the crab I used). Neither my husband or I liked them.

Made these for a New Years Eve party using imitation crabmeat.  I omitted the dry white wine altogether, I didn't see the reason in doing this and I don't like to cook with wine anyways.  Anyways.....these were a huge hit, everyone loved them and there were NO leftovers! Yay!  Kudos to the chef.

Not that great.  We ended up throwing them away because only a few people ate them at our party. They just didn't have much flavor.  I would add garlic and salt.

I thought these were just ok.  I was really expecting something fabulous based on reviews...but I think they fell short, sorry!  I followed exactly except for adding a bit more garlic.  My guests seemed to like them but nobody raved or asked for the recipe...so will probably not make again.

Very easy to make, especially if you put all of the stuffing ingredients into a food processor.

I made these for an appetizer at Thanksgiving.  They were gone in no time with many compliments!  The only change I made was omitting the extra dose of cheese on top...I didn't want to mask the great flavors beneath.  They were perfect.  I am making them again for Christmas!  I also filled more than 24 mushroom caps, maybe I used smaller mushrooms.  I will have this in my recipe box and definately make again!

This is fantastic!  I also took the advice of others and added minced garlic while sauteeing the green onions and stems.  I used white cooking wine instead of dry and it turned out wonderfully! Will definitely make again and again.  Thanks for the recipe!!

This recipe is awesome!  I've made it a couple times and the only thing I do different is add a little red bell pepper.  It does make a lot more mix than what your average shrooms can hold, so get the big ones!

Everyone I served these to loved them, however I felt like the filling was a little bland.  Next time I make them I will definitely have to add a little something extra to give the dish the flare I'm looking for.

I personally didnt like the taste of this recipe.  I think it needed chopped fresh garlic.  I didnt like the flavor the wine gave. I wont make it again, but suggest to anyone who does,to add the garlic to the mushrooms when sauteing and dont use wine.

These were good.  I just used bread crumbs.  Not sure what "soft crumbs" are ... fresh bread cubes??  I also added a little red pepper flakes to spice it up.  Will make again.  I used two cans of crab meat, next time I'll only need one.

I made these during Christmas time and they were excellent!  The only thing is they are much better right out of the oven, which makes it hard to take to a potluck.

This was a huge hit!  I didn't have bread so I used ritz crackers.  I bought pepper jack cheese to spice it up and it worked wonderfully well. These were the first to go at the holidays.

Huge hit at my house today.  I used extra crab meat and used mozzarella cheese and panko crumbs.  I seasoned with the Chsapeake Bay seasoning I got at Penzeys spices or you could use Old Bay.

It was really bland, so the next day I put mayonnaise and grated cheddar on top of the mushrooms and warmed until melted. That helped.

This is by far my favorite recipe for crab stuffed mushrooms! It has a perfect balance of flavors. It is rich, but not over the top... I much appreciate that this recipe excludes mayonnaise, which -in my opinion- is usually added in the absence of true flavor from better ingredients.

Delicious!  I used garlic like other reviewers, and used more crab meat than it called for (we like lots of crab).  Just so you know, this makes more than 2 dozen... I ended up using two packages of baby bellas, plus a leftover portabello cap from Christmas.  Will make again!

I used yellow onion instead of green onion and sautéed it with fresh garlic, omitted the dill, used asiago cheese and lobster cause that's what I had on hand. I recommend spooning the white wine over the mushrooms halfway during the baking time. I spooned it over at the end because they needed some moistness and it really brought it together. Yum!

With a few suggestions of adding some chopped garlic to the green onion mixture while cooking, salt and pepper, some parmesan cheese, and cheddar cheese (because I did not have monterey jack on hand) this was excellent, tasty, and very close to restaurant style stuffed mushrooms!   NICE JOB!  WILL MAKE OVER AND OVER!  People that said it was not tasty...you have to add your own spices to your families taste at times.

Yummy recipe! I took advice of some others and cooked the mushrooms prior to adding the filling for approx. 5-10 minutes (took alot of the water out so they are not mushy). I added a 1/4 of the mushroom stems to the filling, doubled the jumbo lump crab meat, and used fresh dill. Also, I baked the stuffed mushrooms for about 10 allowed them to cool slightly so they would suck up the wine then re-heated for another 5 minutes. They turned out fabulous!

I made this into a crab bake.  I sauteed onions, celery, red pepper, garlic cloves, and a jalapeno pepper; no mushrooms.  Followed the receipe, except for the mushrooms, and garnished with lemon and diced green onions.  Delicious!!

What an amazing and delightful recipe;  I felt like a gourmet chef! With my large bella mushrooms that I had no clue what to do with that evening, this recipe was tasty and filling. I added a pinch of fresh garlic (not to drown out the mushroom/crab taste) but just enough for a small tang. I will definitely add this to the keep file and use again...soon.

Yum!  I left out the bread since it's just filler, and used mozza & cheddar instead of jack cheese.

I used 8oz of canned lump crabmeat. I added 2 tbsp of minced garlic in the butter and also added a couple of teaspoons of Old  Bay. Next time I will use even more garlic and maybe add some cayenne pepper.   I might also use Indian spices or Thai spices next time to put an "ethnic" twist on these.  However, it was a huge hit at the party! If you try this recipe, I definitely suggest trying to flavour it up more but it is an awesome base recipe.

Sure lots of stuffed mushroom recipes to choose from! I did love that the mushrooms stay white & crisp in the center - just like the Olive Garden's! This one was bland as some of the others have said. I even added garlic to the onion mixture. Next time I will cut down on the crab, add more garlic & onion, add Parmesan as well as more cheese, perhaps some cream cheese. Overall much better than others I have tried in the past.

I used the cheese I had in the fridge and chicken stock instead of white wine. It was good, the hubby loved! But I didnt think the inside was done all the way and I cooked twice as long. Maybe I over stuffed. Will try again though, because we love mushrooms!

Awesome.  I used the large portabella mushroom caps and sauted diced baby bellas, onions and garlic to mix in with the crab meat. MMMMMMM.  Turned out perfect.  I am making it again for the holidays.

This recipe was pretty delish.  I made it into an entree for two by halving the recipe, and using 2 portabella mushrooms instead.  I added 4 button mushrooms (including stems), garlic, and also some parmesan, extra cheese, and Mrs. Dash on top.  My husband loved it.  :)

No one could stop eating these delicious appetizers!! I followed the recipe exactly. Makes a lot of stuffing so have extra mushrooms on hand. I took them to a dinner party so I followed entire recipe to the end, but reducing cooking time by 5 min. I drained the wine prior to travel. I then popped them in the host's oven for 5 min prior to serving with a tiny bit of wine in the bottom. Everyone raved over them!

I made these for a party, and although they were all eaten, I thought they were good, but not 100% perfect.  I thought they could have used a little bit more flavor, although I don't know what.  I did add 2 cloves of garlic to the recipe.  I will make them again.

excellent. i did slightly alter the recipe. i used gruyere instead of monterrey jack and used panko bread crumbs. i added about 1/2 T of dijon mustard and a couple of dashes of worcestershire. i also added some finely minced garlic when i sauteed the mushrooms and onions. using good quality crab is key. thinking this would also be good with some kind of sausage substituted for the crab.

Excellent! Didn't have Mont. Jack cheese on hand, so subbed with shaved parmesan, b/c that's what I did have. If it's available in your area, do use fresh white backfin lump crabmeat. You will need to pick it for shell particles, but it's well worth the effort! Very tasty!

This is a favorite at gatherings. I did make a couple of changes though. I used canned crab and chicken broth instead of the white wine suggested by others. I also didn't have dill on hand, so I left it out. They are wonderfull as a side dish or as a hot appetizer!

Great recipe. I made the crab stuffing and used portabello mushrooms to stuff. Baked in oven at 350 for about 30 minutes. One addition to the stuffing mixture: cayenne pepper. It added some zing. Thanks for this recipe. I enjoyed it very much.

Pretty tasty.  These turned very cute, and they were simple to make.  The stuffing was a teeny bit dry for my taste.  I would make these again.

I added chopped garlic and grated parmesan cheese. I also added some mayo. I did not use the wine because the mushrooms would make enough liquid themselves. These were great! Did not last too long. Will make this again!

This recipe was ok, but I'm gonna keep looking for the perfect Stuffed Mushroom recipe.  I left out the dill, simply because I didn't want to spend $3 on a pre-packaged amount, and use only a little amount.  I don't use dill nearly enough to justify the purchase.  I added about a tablespoon of mayo because after mixing all the ingredients, it was a little dry, and I also added a clove of garlic, salt and pepper.  After all the additions, it was still a little bland, so I really couldn't imagine what they taste like without the extra ingredients I put in.  Over all, like I stated, it was ok.  Thanks for the recipe, but I'll keep looking!!

Very good, though my diced crab was a little too big. (I used imitation crab) Next time, I'll be sure to mince the crab very finely.  Perhaps into the food processor after cooking it with the green onions.

These were very tasty, and so easy that my husband made them!!  We used imitation crab meat and that worked out well.  We used these as an appetizer in a Cajun-themed dinner, and everyone was impressed... even the guests that don't like mushrooms loved this recipe!

I made this recipe for a housewarming party and everyone gobbled it up.  When I cooked the stems and green onions I put a clove of garlic in there for flavor and I did add a little sage ( about a 1/4 teaspoon) for flavor as well.  I did forget the egg and so it didn't stick too well together but it was still great!!!

I put this on two portobello mushrooms and it turned out pretty tasty although the crab mixture could have had a bit more *upmh*. I think I may try cream cheese in the mixture next time ...

I didn't followed the recipe closely because my kitchen was not well stocked. So I used whatever was available: I used onion instead of green onion, Italian bread crumbs instead of soft breadcrumbs, and a mixture of parmesean and cheddar instead of moneterey jack. I omitted the dill, and by mistake, I mixed all the cheese into the mixture so I have to place extra on top. But you know what? It turned out great! Next time will follow the recipe more closely :-p

Only thing I did different is I used less wine in the pan and added more butter!  Otherwise these are delicious!!  Excellent recipe!

I made these for New Years Eve.  I followed others' suggestions for adding a bit of minced garlic and also left out the egg.  Although it was a bit difficult to stuff because there was nothing to bind it together (the egg's job, I suppose), it was no more difficult than any other stuffed mushroom I've made.  I had rave reviews, and have been asked for the recipe.  They went quickly!  Thanks for the recipe.

Heavenly! These were the BEST stuffed mushrooms I've ever had! I only made a few changes; 1st I used a single portabella mushroom (for a single serving) & imitation crab meat. 2nd I  added a touch of salt & lemon pepper. 3rd, I used a dollup of cream cheese at the end along with the monterey cheese. I may had added just a touch more dill weed & lemon juice (I just threw it in, didn't measure precisely). Actually I forgot to use the wine & didn’t use the slices of mushrooms, but still good! Full of flavor! Thanks for the recipe!

These were excellent.  Used imitation crab and parmesan cheese.  Scaped the gills from the mushrooms with a baby feeding spoon; just fit the inside rim of the mushroom cap.  The servings were generous at three each (or maybe my mushrooms were just big).

A little dry in the stuffing department.  I did add a lot of extra seasonings as the receipe didn't call for that much.  The cheese was a good touch.

I just tried these last night and they came out wonderfully. I used imitation crabmeat, and also added several cloves of minced garlic to the whole mix.

Putting the ingredients into a food processor to dice them made this very simple. I did end up having extra stuffing left over to make more caps. No problem though!

These crab mushrooms were sooo good! I made them for a wine party, and I got great raves. Easy and simple. I used surimi instead of real crab. Next time, i'm going to use real crab, just to see what it's like.

These are possibly the best stuffed mushrooms I've had.  The monterey jack cheese is a wonderful complement to the crab stuffing.  And, I was thrilled that they were so simple to prepare and pop in the oven.  We're having company next week and these delicious mushrooms will definitely be on the menu!

I am rating with a 2 star although it may have been lousy due to my own alterations. I used portabella mushrooms first off and added a few dashes of hot sauce and took former raters advice and added a bit of garlic. Followed all the other directions and I was very disappointed with the outcome. May have been my own bad as I have stated.

I made this recipe for friends, and everyone loved the mushrooms.  I added extra lemon juice and  black pepper, and chopped up the crabmeat as much as I could.  I think I used too much wine, but they still turned out great!

I made this is a  "test" recipe to see if I should take to my Husbands holiday party. They came out great. I took advice from some other reviews and I added fresh garlic and salt. They came out great! I will make them again for the holiday party. (I didn't know what wine to get so I bought pinot grigio-it tasted great).

I was afraid theese were going to be too bland considering the only spices were dill weed and lemon juice but they were surprisingly good.... i didnt have any white wine or the right amount or right kind of cheese but i compromised using probably a fourth of the cheese recommended.... they were good, i will definately try them again using the wine and cheese i bet they will be twice as good.

Loved this recipe with just a few changes: separately ran one slice of wonderbread and then the stems through the food processor (mini chopper).  Used prepackaged shredded fancy Monterey Jack cheese and covered the bottom of the baking pan, about 1/8 inch with Cavit Pinot Grigio 2003(It was already open).  I used lump crabmeat making sure all the cartilage was removed.  Served the mushrooms with RVTZ Cellars, Russian River Valley, Chardonnay, 2000.  Everyone loved it.  I was looking to make an impression.

These were good, not amazing, but good.  They seemed a little bland to me.  I had to add salt, I also used chicken broth instead of wine (our friends don't drink) maybe it would have been better with wine.

I make these every New Year’s Eve for my friends and family. I sauté lobster first and then add it to the bread crumb mixture along with the crab. It’s always a hit and over the years I’ve had to increase the amount I make every celebration. Guess they like them!

These turned out amazing - I made extra stuffing and made stuffed pork chops  with it - amazing!!! I made a few changes but loved using the wine rather than butter.  I sauteed garlic with the butter and onion (used yellow onion rather than green).  I used Panko bread crumbs (extra) and 2 cans of crab and crumbled bacon. I didn't have Monterrey Jack so used fresh Parmesan and Cheddar and a tablespoon of Italian Seasoning.  The stuffing was light and flavorful - 

I usually go for mushroom caps with cream cheese, but this will be a favorite now - The wine added the richness without over powering the crab and bacon - so yummy!!!

I made them according to the recipe although I used the big brown mushrooms rather than the white.  It turned out really well although I would try to work a bit of cream cheese into the filling just to give it a bit more zing.

Very good.  Cooked them in a disposable pan on the grill over indirect heat.  I used imitation crab but will try the canned crab next time.  Definitely serve with lemon wedges.

Not sure which recipe was posted first because they are both the same (Perfect Crab Stuffed Mushrooms) but OMGeeeee!! Yummm!! I added a tad of Garlic, Worchestershire and Horseradish to the stuffing and used sweet onion and seasoned dry bread crumbs instead of green onions and soft bread crumbs (only because thats what I had) and added the stems that I chopped up to the filling.... Will DEFINATELY be making these again!!

I made these for a neighborhood New Year's Eve party, and was disappointed in them. They were bland and just off-tasting. Thankfully, I made a second plate of stuffed mushrooms using a different recipe, and those received rave reviews and were devoured by the group.

Love this recipe.  Most of the crab stuffed mushroom recipes add a lot of cream cheese; which tastes good, but is not good for the waste line.  I didn't need the butter and added garlic. wonderful.

Horrible recipe,the wine made them feel like they have slime on the outside and ruined the taste. Made them for a party and they were barely touched, maybe next time without the wine,no idea why you need that.

Very good.  Not difficult to prepare.  I used fresh dill but put too much in; next time I will look up equivalent of fresh-to-dried for dill.  Decided to try to make the mushrooms into "finger food" so bought puff pastry sheets and cut each sheet into 9 +/- pieces depending on size of mushrooms.  Put puff pastry half-way up and around the mushroom and put in regular sized muffin pans to bake.  Turned out fine - just had to adjust time up a little bit for baking. The egg (ingredient) sounded a bit strange but I went with it and I didn't notice it at all when cooked.  Used panko bread crumbs - couldn't find soft crumbs - they worked fine.

Made a half batch for "girls night in" as an appetizer.   I added a large clove of garlic (pressed) to the mushrooms and onions, as recommended by several other reviewers, used 3 T of chardonnay, substituted a mild swiss.  One can of lump crab, which was a little more than a half cup, and really stacked the stuffing on top of the mushrooms.  Also, I sprinkled with paprika to give it a little more color.  This was a hit, and received many kudos, and suggestions for  whipping this up holiday parties!

This was really good.  Mushroom cooked all the way. I used baby portobello mushrooms.  I would put a touch of salt and pepper in the caps before filling.  I could only get imitation crab but it did come out very tasty.  I even mixed up about a tablespoon of yellow mustard with about three tablespoons mayonnaise with a teaspoon of horseradish for a sauce option.

Delicious! I followed other member suggestions and used Gruyere/Cheddar mix and dipped the caps in butter prior to stuffing them. For the wine, I used Pinot Grigio.  As with many of my recipes, I added a couple of tablespoons of Montreal steak seasoning for the extra umph. Took them to a friend's dinner party & they were a HIT!!!

I used this recipe to fill huge portabella mushrooms. I used a bit of extra lemon juice in the mix and with Sauterne wine, these were savory and really good. I use this recipe whenever I want to show off "my" good cooking! Many thanks to the chef who created these!

I have made these several times with rave reviews! My recipe came from a cookbook I purchased many years ago in the Atlanta airport. I made them yesterday with large portabella mushrooms, the only extra tweeking I did was to add a bit of Old Bay Seasoning to the mix & the white wine I drizzled over & placed in the pan was Beringer Moscato. Excellant! I made them in the microwave for 4 minutes & my husband (who travels a lot) said they were better than any he has had in a restaurant. Enjoy!!

This recipe is so perfect that my boyfriend said I was a keeper when I made it for him for the first time.  I also added chopped shrimp to the ingredients...yummy!  Thank you for sharing.

Great recipe. I just used a marble cheddar and added some crisp fried bacon to the top of each cap. Also used a red wine. 

Don't cheap out on your crab purchase for the best taste.

They were good when piping hot, but the crab taste was too strong for my liking. Next time I will do something fish-less. They weren't terrible, but I wouldn't make again.

This is a great recipe to follow as is or as a starting point. I don't always have the exact ingredients on hand but these are by far a favorite for everyone I have made them for. I do one thing differnt - I always use large portobello caps vs. small mushrooms. Excellent recipe and a must try!

Went with Sharp Cheddar and added some red pepper flakes for extra flavor.  Turned out yummy!  Broiled the top like others suggested, reheated leftovers in the toaster oven the next day and it was still awesomely yummy!

Excellent.  I use 1.5 cups shredded (hand picked) and substituted panko bread crumbs.  I also left out the lemon juice.  Will definately make again!

I made these for my husband, who LOVES mushroom and crab meat.  While they turned out well, I felt the wine in the bottom made them soggy.  I would omit the wine and I'd also omit the cheese on top.  My husband said he liked a little in the mixture, but none on top.  Overall, they were a HIT!  He ate 9 of them in about 30 seconds.  ;-)

We these for my mil for mother's day. I used both cap muchrooms and portabellas. My husband said the portabella's were much better. We followed the directions and added a bit of garlic powder. He said that they could have used more kick.

Were very good! I did eliminate the butter and used cooking spray to sautee the onions/mushrooms.  I used Parmesean cheese instead as well. Also, for the breadcrumbs i just toasted a piece of bread and mixed in my "magic bullet" and that worked great! I would for sure make these again.

This was a really great, really easy recipe. I made it for my co-workers at a "anything stuffed" theme potluck and I won the best dish trophy!  Just as others did, I added 3 cloves of fresh garlic that was sauteed in butter with the green onions, added salt and pepper, used whole wheat bread chopped finely, used colby/jack cheese and used chicken broth instead of wine.  Yum.  Thanks for the added suggestions; it helped make my dish a winner.

Good, not the best.  Made with chicken stock instead of wine.  Also added 3 strips of REAL bacon (not very common for me).  A little greasy, but tasty.

Made these for Christmas Eve dinner...they turned out PERFECT. We followed the recipe exactly, although we halved it to make only 12 mushrooms. We found a 12pack of the same size mushroom caps with short stems, which ended up being great since regular packages of mushrooms can come with all sorts of different sizes. Everyone loooooved them, and I will definitely make them again!

I adjusted this:
fresh chives instead of green onions, sauteed scallops and garlic with the chive and shrooms, skipped the dill, used Swiss cheese instead of Mont Jack, added a few dashes of cajun spice. YUM!

These were tasty; we found them a little bit bland, though! I added some more seasoning, but I'm not sure if I'll make them again.

My husband and I really liked these.  However, I made them for a party and no one else seemed to really enjoy them, I had a lot left.

These were pretty good. Next itme I will experiment with the seasonings as I felt it was a little  bland for my taste. The wine did make the bottoms soggy, but I wouldn't change that as the wine did add a nice flavor. I will be making these again, but will sub another seasoning for the dill. and maybe parm cheese for the monterey jack.

These were GOOD. I have made them a few times now, usually for holiday get togethers, and they are always a hit.

Absolutely phenomenal.  I wasn't crazy about the dill and am experimenting for a better herb to include, but definitely will be making repeat appearances on party menus!

A lot of work. There was too much liquid in the pan. I got rid of liquid, stored cooked mushrooms in frig, then reheated them...it worked fine.

These just were not a big hit.  Many did not like the texture the egg gave it nor were many thrilled about the dill.  I will leave out the egg and dill and add many other spices such as garlic salt, cayenne pepper, savory, blackening seasoning, etc.

Everyone loved them, I wish I had made more!  I did add extra breadcrumbs(I had 2 cups worth) and I did not have jack cheese so I used Provolone and Swiss Cheese.  I omitted the crab due to some guests that cannot eat it.  They were great!!

Very tasty and easy to make.  It took me a little longer for prep time but overall these were a hit.  Very good reheated as well. I did add a lot of garlic (3 cloves) and some chopped up black olives.

I thought these mushrooms were okay.  The filling is pretty good, but maybe not salty enough for me?  I even followed others suggestions and put red onion and garlic in.  The people at my party seemed to love them though... I am only one person.

These were good but expected a little better flavor. I also added minced garlic while sauteeing and thought they were a little bland.  People did seem to like them though...just didn't seem to rave!
