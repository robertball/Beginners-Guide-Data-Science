This is great soup. The first time I made it I used half and half and it was great. The second time I made it I used 1% milk and it was still good. If I were making this for a group of people I would use the half and half but just for me 1% works just fine (in an attemp to cut down on fat).

It's so easy! I kicked it up a notch by using freshly grated ginger and nearly 1/4 cup.... I like it spicy! I also switched the 1/2 and 1/2 to heavy cream. I serve it with a dollop of creme fraiche or sour cream. Everyone raves over this.

This is a wonderful recipe. I used about 1/2 cup Ornage Juice and fat free half and half. Also used 4 teaspoons of ginger instead of 2. Wonderful recipe to be re-used over and over again.

This was wonderful. I served it to my husband who raved and raved. I subsituted light soy milk for half/half for a lighter approach.

What a fantastic recipe! Because I really enjoy the flavor and spiciness of ginger I tripled the suggested. Very easy to make looks and tastes fancier than the effort put into it and my husband loved it! Easy to make easy to clean up crowd appeal...5 stars!

Amazing carrot soup just what I was looking for. It doesn't get much easier than this. I used 3 cups of milk instead of 2 cups half-and-half and it still gave me a very consistent soup. I used butter instead of oil though I don't know that that made much of a difference. Just missing a little seasoning of some sort. I used fresh grated ginger and added oregano and a little parsley. I will use this recipe again and again when I don't know what to do with leftover carrots. Thank you!

Very good soup! My husband, company and I really enjoyed it. I made it with Chicken broth and it had great full flavor.  I used a Braun Mixer Stick instead of a blender to puree it and it turned out really well. Will make again!

What a great soup! I usually make the curried carrot soup from this site when I want to use up my carrots but this time I tried this recipe and I am so glad that I did! Very simple easy and delicious! I can see myself making this a lot during the winter time! I didn't have any half-and-half so I used 1% milk and it was still great! Thank you for sharing!

This is the first review I have ever made. I joined just so I could say how delicious this is! The only change I made was using 2 cups of heavy cream instead of half and half and leaving out the salt. I think the vegetable broth had enough salt that more wasn't necessary. I had no trouble blending this in my blender and I did not let it get very cold before blending (I saw other reviewers saying how they had to let it get really cold before it would blend). It was velvety smooth and absolutely wonderful. I should have doubled the recipe!

I thought the soup was average. I scooped a spoonful of sour cream into each bowl and that helped kick up the taste a little bit.

Really good recipe. I like the heat from the ginger. I added fresh parsley but I next time I'll make add some cilantro. I used 1 cup of light cream and 1 cup of 1% milk and it was still rich and creamy without most of the fat.

this lacked something to add as a spice --and it needs to be cooled almost to a medium warm temperature in order to be blended enough. Without this temperature tip it was almost chewing through this soup -- it did make great left overs after being refridgerated and pureed again.

This soup is excellent and didn't suffer from my substituting chicken broth for the vegetable broth (probably should have checked the pantry before starting to cook)! Also tastes quite good cold on a hot day.

Who forgot to invite the flavour? I doubled the ginger and bland as bland can be. Was looking promising until I added the half-and-half and any flavour from the carrots/ginger disappeared. I even added nutmeg and it did nothing! Too bad. At least it was really easy to make.

This soup is delicious. It's good for a celebration but adding in the half and half adds so much fat to what would otherwise be a healthy soup. Next time I make this soup on a regular weeknight I will try using milk instead of half and half I think it will be just as tasty and much better for you. I used grated fresh ginger and I think the amount of ginger could have been doubled.

Exchange ginger for 1/4 c. fresh ginger. Add a sweet potato. I added a touch of cream on top for serving. Otherwise with a high enblender no cream is required. I have a Vita Mix. Excellent recipe.

This is a great soup recipe. I wanted something a little different but easy and with ingredients I keep on hand. This fit perfectly. I did make a few changes in that I used fresh grated ginger chicken broth I added some chopped fresh cilantro and cooked it with the carrots and about 1/3 cup of orange juice to add a little sweetness. I finished it with 2% milk and it was good!

Excellent soup! I did make one change however... I used 1%milk instead of the 1/2 and 1/2 (10% cream) it tased great and with way less fat. I loved it and will make it again. That's the real test isn't it?!

I made the recipe exactly as-is but found it to be very bland. I added a lot of salt and pepper and additional ground ginger to increase the flavor. Using fresh grated ginger would probably help. If I make it again I would try some of the other suggestions to add orange juice or sour cream. I used a blender and the consistency was great.

This is the best carrot soup recipe I've made so far. I did use 6 tbs butter instead of 2 tbs oil and I used water and chicken bouillon instead of vegetable broth. I doubled the ginger as other reviewers suggested and used a lot of black pepper to give it flavor. Thanks I'll definitely make this again. It's very easy to throw together with what you have on hand.

Fantastic!! I doubled the recipe as I had a ton of carrots from my garden. I then used only 3 cups of half and half rather than 4 as it was quite creamy at that point. Very good and highly recommended!

For those who state that this soup is bland - try adding a couple of teaspoons (or more to taste) of acid like vinegar or maybe lemon juice. Add it just before serving. I have made this several times and often use just plain white vinegar. Try it I think you'll find that's what is missing. Also if i want to change it up a bit and make it vegan I replace the half and half with low fat coconut milk. It's yummy that way too. A great recipe!

I used skim milk instead of half and half it tasted like baby food. I definately will use half and half next time if I make this again. Since I didn't like it that much I added some brown sugar yumm it was much better.

Followed recipe exactly. Made this for our first "Food Club" meeting. Our secret ingredients was ginger. The only difference was I doubled the amount of ginger. This won RAVE reviews! Next time I make I will try with milk to save on calories if just for me. Great recipe!

I added a lot more ginger which was really tasty but I had a lot of trouble getting it smooth. It didn't affect the taste but it did look disconcerting.:) I'd also probably use 1% milk instead of half-and-half in the future as it didn't add much and it made it seem too heavy for my taste.

I followed the original recipe Then at the suggestion of others added 1 cup of orange juice and doubled the ginger. I made it 1 day ahead of time and just warmed it prior to serving. Very easy. All twelve of our guests including my vegetarian daughter loved it.

If you love ginger like I do grind some nutmeg into the pot with the ginger to kick up the flavor. This came out very well and was easy to make -- I used my immersion blender to blend ingredients in the same pot -- no waiting for it to cool or transferring much easier. Next time I think I would use less milk (it tasted too rich to me with the half and half).. coconut milk might be a nice substitute. Be sure to add lots of freshly ground pepper! Delicious!

I'm not a huge fan of carrots but I love this soup! It's nice and creamy. I tend to make it a little healthier though and use skim milk instead of half and half. I've also made it vegan by using coconut milk instead. It's great either way.

Yum. I like chunks in my soup so I sauteed some veggies and added them. This recipe calls for enough ginger- don't go too crazy with adding more. I used whole milk and wouldn't be surprised if it garnered 5 stars with heavy cream. Thanks for sharing!

I made this for me but quickly remembered i don't like ginger duh. So this review is from my husband sister and co-worker which loved it. The recipe was very simple and i followed it with the exception of using Fat Free half and half to reduce fat. I will make again for them maybe without ginger for me:-)

This was pretty good and simple to make but somewhat bland. I added salt and I also added a splash of white wine as the Extended Table Cookbook suggests in their carrot soup recipe. That is a good addition.

This soup is great-even better if you add a couple tablespoons of coconut milk and a dash of cinnamon and garlic.

This soup is amazing. The only thing I didn't put was the cream or any milk. Instead I added 5 cups of water and 4 tsp of low sodium vegtable broth powder. It's healthier that way.

I boiled up a chicken bouillon with celery and onion for my broth (5 cups water boiled down to 4 cups) since that was all I had handy and used 1/2 cup apple juice to sweeten a little. Next time I would cut the ginger a bit. I love the taste but not so much burn. In any case it was delicious! I'm going to make it again tomorrow. Yum!

the recipe was is only 3 star I ended up having to added 3x ginger and 1/4-1/2 cup orange juice. That did the trick and it ended up 5 star!

It was good mostly because the carrots I used were very sweet and fresh. Next time I would put a lot more ginger in it.

This was a simple carrot soup to make. I made a few changes to the recipe though. I used fresh minced ginger in place of ground ginger. This I sautéed with the onion. I used heavy cream in place of the half and half. One thing I added that definitely went well with this was nutmeg. This was an interesting and satisfying recipe to make. Fun way to use carrots.
