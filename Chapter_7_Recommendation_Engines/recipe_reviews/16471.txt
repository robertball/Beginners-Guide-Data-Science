I too added about a tablespoon of chili powder. But try this one...instead of over rice or pasta, add the mix to a casserole dish and then top it with a cornbread mix prepared as directed. You'll have to bake it a few minutes longer that's cool too.

Our rendition of this simple recipe turned out great --d made terrific leftovers for lunch.
But we really had to add quite a dose of spices to make it taste right. We added: cumin, onions, garlic, ceyenne pepper, black pepper and garlic salt. 
It's a good basic recipe to start from, but it would be way too bland without spicing it up a bit.

I added chili powder and red pepper flakes to this recipe as I found it too bland without any spices, but then of course we like alot of heat.  I would likely make it again.

WOW! So simple but so good. I used fresh diced tomatoes, a little onion, I added the cornbread that someone suggested, baked, put cheese on top. My family loved it! Good basic recipe that can be changed to use items on hand and/or taste! Be creative. Thanks for the keeper!

This was really easy and really good over rice!!  I did add some extra spices like garlic salt and mushrooms as well as seasoned salt and chopped onions or onion salt would be ok...My husband and kids liked this one!

This recipe was very good and easy to make. I added some chili powder, cumin, garlic and onion powder. Without it would have been bland. Great topped with cheddar cheese. Would definately make again.

This was a very easy quick dish. Easy to experiment with different spices and vegetables. Even tastes good topped with cheddar or parmesan cheese. Will absolutely make again.

This is an okay recipe.  I had to add a lot to it to make it not taste bland.
I used petite diced tomatoes and a little water for juice.  I followed other suggestions and added a little garlic powder, chili powder, seasoned salt, red pepper flakes and parmesan cheese.  I also added a few drops of worcestershire sauce and I melted a beef bullion in a little hot water and added about a tablespoon of that.  I put chopped onion and canned mushrooms in also and about a third teaspoon of sugar.  I served it with elbow macaroni.  My husband liked it but it was a lot of testing and tasting to make it edible.  I'll keep the recipe because he liked it but for myself I wouldn't make it again.
