I thought they were delicious...but overbaked at 30 minutes! I wish I had checked them at 25 mins. By 30 mins they were almost burned.

I doubled the recipe.  I took into account previous reviews and added another 1/2 cup of peanut butter for the doubled recipe.  I also doubled the salt.  I added about a cup of chocolate chips to the brownie dough and melted an additional 1/2 cup of chocolate to be swirled into the dough before cooking.  
The result was amazing!  I got amazing comments from all who partook!

we enjoyed these but they weren't much like brownies.  the peanut butter mixture tastes more like a thick peanut butter cookie, almost as if you made the cookie dough and baked it in a bar.  the chocolate was a little understated, i might add chocolate chips to the peanut butter mixture next time if i were to make them again.  thanks!

I didn't think these had much flavor.  Disappointed I won't make again.
