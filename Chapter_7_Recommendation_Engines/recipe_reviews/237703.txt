I took the recipe submitter's suggestion and used 1/2 cup of plain greek yogurt and a half cup of naturally sweetened grapefruit juice. I kept the chia seeds but omitted the coconut butter. Very good.

I just made this now and it hit the spot.  Lately I've been pulling back from overly frozen smoothies because they either give me a headache or heartburn from the sugar.  This was perfect because it's not too sweet.  I actually forgot to add the honey in my haste and I don't even miss it.  While I like coconut butter for cooking I couldn't bring myself to add it to the smoothie so I used unsweetened coconut flakes instead and I didn't have blackberries so I used raspberries and blueberries.  It made a pretty  purple drink.  I've always used chia seeds but never noticed before they are a great iron, calcium, and protein source as well as fiber.  Added bonus is this doesn't use frozen banana (a mainstay of my normal smoothie) so I might actually get my kid to try it. ;)

Throw in a handful of frozen kale - you'll never taste it and it will up the nutrients!

The chia seeds made it so thick you had to use a spoon so it wasn't like a smoothie but a pudding.

Quite delicious. I used raspberries instead of blackberries. Thank you for the recipe.

This is not a bad start, but try adding 1/2 - 1 cup of plain non-fat kefir, instead of almond milk and you have a great start to your day! If you want to boost your metabolism add some egg white protein.
