10.25.16 ~ We really enjoyed this dish.  Loved the slight hint of sweetness from the brown sugar in the marinade sauce.  I steamed the rice in the morning and put in the fridge so it would be cold when I added it to the wok.  I needed to stretch the meal, a little bit, so I added some steamed broccoli and carrots.  This dinner came together quickly which in my book, makes it a great weeknight dinner.  Thanks natty's pantry, for sharing your recipe.  It will be used often.

Made this just like the recipe. My family loved it. My kids wanted the leftovers packed in their lunches the next day. It was very easy to make and will be put into our recipe rotation.

This was fantastic!!! 4-year-old and 2-year-old even gobbled it up! It is slightly sweet, the onions ended up nice and caramelized and the cilantro adds a great perk and freshness element. I made the recipe as written expect for the following (lazy) changes: 1/2 tsp of black pepper to replace the white pepper, I'm not sure how many cups of cooked rice I used but I originally measured out 1 cup of uncooked rice, and I about doubled the cilantro. I might add some red pepper flakes next time to give it extra pizazz. I WILL be making this again, thanks!
