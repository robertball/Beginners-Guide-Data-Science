Good mix of flavors.  It's nice using the soy for the "salt" in the dish instead of regular table salt, which adds no flavor of it's own.  If you leave the roast whole and marinate the day before cook for 20 minutes per side on a med-low flame.  Let rest for 10 minutes covered with foil and slice.  Much better that way--more tender.

This marinade is incredible. I recently used this recipe and applied it to 20 lbs of tri tip for a company picnic (proportions increased accordingly). I also added some garlic salt and went a little heavier on the crushed garlic and black pepper to the mix and cut the meat down to 2-3 lb pieces, fat side removed, and let marinade overnight. I cooked this over a charcoal grill until between medium rare to medium and sliced up into approximately 4 inch strips. This was a major hit at the picnic. A side note the remaining marinande was applied to the meat throughout the cooking process for additional seasoning.

Great for camping. Just freeze the meat in the marinade the day before. Defrost at the campsite and grill. Slice the meat up and serve with tortillas, salsa and sour cream.

i've been looking for the perfect tri tip marinade and i've found it.  followed recipe exactly, sliced it, marinated for 5 hours and it was absolutely perfect!  i also prepared it whole/cooked 20 min per side as another reviewer said and it too was incredible.  this is hands down the best tri tip i've ever eaten.  my whole family loved this.  definitely a keeper!  thanks!

This is a good start, but next time I will put a lot more garlic in the marinade, and some extra pepper.  Still my guests liked it a lot.

This was excellant!! I'm not much of a beef eater and rarely cook it, but I was having a craving for a steak. I bought some tri-tip steaks but wasn't sure how to cook them. I used this recipe and it tuned out very tender and flavorful. I did cook it in the broiler instead of on a grill for the same amount of time. I will definitely be making this again. Thanks!!

I made this recipe for a group of people last night. Since I don't eat red meat, I can't speak for hand, but everyone loved it! I bought tri tip steaks at Costco which didn't need any trimming or extra work. The only thing that I did differently was that I added fresh rosemary and a touch more garlic. It was a great success and I will use this recipe again.

I have used many different marinades over the years. This was such an easy one and was so good. Even my three year old Grandson loved it. He said" oohh Grandma, this is so nummy". Am making again this weekend, but will add fresh rosemary from the garden.

This was just the best and the only way I will now cook/grill Tri Tip. It was so full of flavor and so tender and best of all my husband loved it too.  We did grill it and it marinated for 3 hours in a sealed ziplock.  I would not change a thing with the ingredients.  This would be excellent to prepare and marinate during your work day and then come home and grill, super simple with results that are unbelievable.  Thanks for a great recipe that will get used on a regular basis.

I used this on two sirloin steaks, marinated from frozen for about 8 hours.  Grilled to perfection with just the right amount of added flavor.  Be sure to cover your grill though as it does flame up quite a bit.  I also added about 1 T of teriyaki sauce to the marinade.  Thanks Erika for a great, easy recipe.

OH, this marinade was the best. I followed the recipe to a T! I ended up grilling the steak slices 2min per side roughly and they were perfect. My boyfriend said, "this is the best steak I have ever had- even at a restaurant!" Perfect. I foresee a lifetime of using this wonderful recipe. Just excellent!!

Like the name...it is easy to prepare! The flavor is very good but not excellent like some reviewers raved. If I were to make this again I would add some brown sugar and more garlic.

Super Easy to make and very tasty.  I think it was a little salty.  I let it marinade for 2.5 hours.  Next time I'll try it with low sodium soy sauce.

This steak was pretty good.  It tasted like a steak from an Asian restaurant.  But, there was enough flavor.  My husband even seemed to enjoy it and he doesn't like to use soy sauce very much in recipes. I ended up marinating the steak for more than 24 hours, probably 2 days.  But, it was yummy.

Every time I make this, I get rave reviews.  If I forget to marinate the night before I put it in a food saver bag for at least an hour.  Just remember to sear the meat and cook low and slow on the grill.  The internal temperature is important if you care about how rare the meat is.  YUMMY!!!

Yummy, yummy.  I do increase the amount of marinade but keep the proportions exactly the same.  I also just marinate it in a resealable plastic bag.

Yummers! Very nice, basic marinade.  I usually substitute salt with soy sauce for other marinades as well.  I kind of just needed instruction on how to cook the tri-tip steak, because I had bought it for the first time.  Thanks for the tips!

I live in Bakersfield, CA. where everyone thinks himself a tri tip master. This recipe put them all to shame. The marinate soaks completely into the meat, not just on the outside!

Hands down the best tri tip marinade ever. I will not use any other in the future. My husband likes to slow cook the large cuts of Tri Tip with an indirect heat method (oh my!!)so so tender and flavorful. We used or favorite rub last time we cooked and it was good but not great, 
nothing compared to the results you get from this recipe. Thanks!!

Thumbs up! I only had about 3 hours to marinate my tri-tip roast and cooked it whole (vs. sliced) and it was just right. Nice flavor to complement the meat.

This really is a great recipe.  Perfect flavor for the meat.  I pierce my meat with a fork and leave it whole prior to marinating and grilling.  Everyone who eats it requests it again.  Thanks!

An easy go-to meal.  I think this meat tastes best medium-rare.  We didn't slice the meat, we just grilled the steaks whole.  Also, we marinaded it overnight.  Very yummy!

This worked really well.  I also added steak seasoning in place of the salt/pepper.  I cooked my tri-tip in the oven for about 45 minutes for medium rare.  I will make this again.

I thought that this recipe was very good.  I did not have time to marinade that long so I used my foodsaver to vacuum seal it for 1 hour.  The meat was very tender and flavorful.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

One of my favorite grill recipes.  The use of soy gives it a different flavor than your traditional salt/pepper steak seasoning.  I prefer my tri tip grilled whole instead of cut into steaks.  A couple of tweaks: I like garlic so I use about half a bulb (about 7 cloves).  I also add pepper to the tri tip right before grilling.  Instead of water, I use about a quarter cup of OJ to let it marinate with a little bit of acid.  After marinating overnight, I sear each side for about 3 minutes, then cook roughly another 10 to 15 mins each side until it reaches 125 to 130° internally.  I'll also pour leftover marinade onto the meat as it cooks, as not to let the great flavors go to waste.  After cooking, I let it rest under a foil tent for about 10 minutes before slicing -- against the grain of course!  Juices that run off the meat after cooking and slicing (and NOT the uncooked, leftover marinade!) go great on top of the meat.

Awesome... The only thing I changed was to use teriyaki sauce instead of the soy sauce... My picky eaters have ranked this their new favorite.

I prepared one small tri tip with this recipe and another small tri tip from the same package with the oregon herb dry rub (another allrecipes.com tri tip recipe).  I cooked them both on the grill (whole) in the same way and this one was more moist and tastier.  Unfortunately, there were no left overs of this tri tip, only the dry rub.  Both were good, but I would definitely recommend this one.

I tweeked the recipe..and all I can say is..Winner Winner TRI TIP DINNER! This recipe is VERY simple and very tasty. The soy sauce really adds a lot of flavor. What I did was instead of grilling the meat, I baked it WITH the marinade. I used both granulated AND fresh Garlic. I added a ton of black pepper on top of the tri tip to coat liberally. I did not cover the pan with foil as I like my meat to have a crust. I did cover it within 10 minutes at the end. I baked it for approx 45 minutes.  I let the meat sit and used the marinade to top the meat when serving. I did not measure the ingredients..just eye balled it..  VERY tasty...beats going to a steak house..

Making this marinade to spec, I give it 4.0. I like it because it was different from my usual seasoning mixture, it definitely had a unique taste to it. Kind of a euro-asian flare. My adult daughter loved it, and she is very hard to please and loves steak. I used the tri tip loin, marinated it for 6 hrs, then in a med-hot pan, cooked two strips, side by side, 3 mins ea side, rested for 3-4 minutes, then let the juices flow.  It was much more tender, plus the fact that I had time to let it marry for 6 hrs helped, I'm sure.  We like ours rare, and I cooked it to perfection, which is a feat in itself :).  Very happy with the results.  Thanks for sharing a different type of marinade. I will probably use it again.

I have been making a similar marinade for years. The only difference is instead of water, I add some vinegar (red wine or white ) as it is very tenderizing. I also use at least 4 garlic clove sections for maximum flavor.

This was so easy, and the tri tip came out great! I used 4 cloves of garlic instead of 2, and grilled the tri tip before slicing, but otherwise followed the recipe as is. I will definitely make this again.

I doubled the sauce - let marinatye for a few hours. Didn't have time to slice, or access to grill. So baked in the oven on low (325 degrees) and then finished off under the broiler. Sliced and servved. My family really enjoyed! Do not overcook the meat if using this method (Sorry - I can't remember exact baking times).

Very nice and simple, tasty recipe.  Although it does not seem to make a lot it does flavor the meat adequately.  Marinaded overnight and grilled, delicious!  Definitely easy.

I felt this recipe had too much oil in it.  It took away from the other flavors.  Also, it flared up pretty bad when first placed on the grill due to the oil.

This was a pretty good recipe. It was the first time I made tri tips. I didn't realize there were 4 steaks in the pack. Since it's just me, I grilled a steak at 4hr after marinating. It wasn't that great. Then I grilled the next day and it was very good. The recipe was easy and I would make it again.

Tri tip beef is something that I rarely find in the grocery store so when I did find one I decided to try it to see what this cut of meat was all about.  Now that I had the beef I needed a recipe.  I turned to All Recipes.com and there was my recipe.  We marinated the meat for about 12 hours and then cooked it whole.  It came out juicy and so delicous.  Can't wait to try this recipe again.

To those who thought the recipe was bland, I used this as a base and spiced mine up considerably. With the new additions, it was incredible! I substituted 2 tablespoons lemon juice for the water in the recipe, 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes for the black pepper, and added 1/4 cup red wine, 1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger (you can substitute 1/4 teaspoon ground) and 2 extra garlic cloves.

This was great!  We didn't slice prior to cooking because we had just one big steak that we were splitting.  The marinade had a good flavor which enhances the meat and was even good as a leftover steak sandwich for Monday's lunch.

I made one change, and used Worcester sauce instead of Soy ( due to an allergy), but this preperation makes tri-tip one of my go-to recipes instead of something to have to labor over.

Really good and really easy. I doubled the garlic and added some garlic powder. I also used a lot of fresh crushed black pepper.

This tri-tip recipe was soo tender and tasty!  Knowing how I like to turn the flame up on meat, the suggested amount of cooking time was just perfect.  My whole family enjoyed this very much,between four of us we devoured about 3 1/4 lbs. of meat. We usually have leftovers but there were none tonight. My husband said I could make this for him anytime I wish. I would not change a thing on this recipe.

My family loves this one--even my 3 picky kids ate it and asked for more.  I've made it a couple of times and plan to use this for other cuts of meat as well.

I was disappointed; but it's not the recipes fault.  I should have known a recipe with so few and unexciting ingredients would turn out a little bland.  I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I guess the effort that went into the tri-tip really showed.  The recipe really needs something to make it more exciting.

I did give it 3 stars, because to me 3 stars = mediocre.

Nice flavor. I did double the garlic and went fairly heavy with the black pepper. I also did marinate it overnight.

The marinade was very good.  I wish it had permeated more of the meat though so next time I would marinate it overnight.

I loved this. I made a few changes. I doubled the garlic and pepper. I added 1 tsp paprika. 1 tsp spicy mustard and a 1/2 tsp crushed ginger. I doubled the original recipe.  Oh my was this delish.

This is just perfect!  I get four small slices of tri tip, use this marinade and then throw on the grill.  Easy and very tasty!  Fairly healthy too.

Easy recipe, marinated for about 6 hours in fridge, grilled a few minutes on each side, and it was fabulous. I was worried that it would lose it's tenderness if sliced before grilling -- but it was very tender and flavorful. I also made extra sauce and marinated some huge raw shelled shrimp in it in another ziplock bag, then skewered them and grilled along with the tri-tip.  They were FABU too!   Thanks for the recipe :)

Very delicious. I was looking for a recipe that I didn’t have to marinate for too long. I also didn’t slice the tri tip before I BBQed it. I’ll make it again

Rather than grilling the meat I cooked it up in a pan.  I read that some folks found the marinate too salty so halfway through the marinating time I stored up the meat.  Came out great! Very flavorful! Delicious over rice and will definitely make it again!
