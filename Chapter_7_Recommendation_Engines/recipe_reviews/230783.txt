This was so easy to make and it tasted GREAT! I can't wait to make it again; my family LOVED it. Th only problem was that I didn't make enough:)

I followed this recipe (almost) to the letter. It's EXCELLENT as written! Don't be afraid of the amounts of onion & garlic the flavors all work together so well nothing overpowers anything else imho. The only thing I did to "own" the dish was to use 1/4c Sriracha vodka and 1/4c plain vodka. I also only had a half-pint heavy cream so mixed it with 2% milk... it had no deleterious effect on the final product. Simple. Delicious. My favorite kind of dinner.

This recipe is great. I would highly recommend adding 1 tsp of red pepper flakes when adding the basil. It gives the recipe a perfect kick when combined with and neutralized by the cream.

We very much enjoyed this recipe. It definitely makes enough for two meals for a family of 4! It could use some red pepper flakes to spice it up a little.

Wow! This is by far the best penne vodka recipe I have tried! the sauce is actually thick enough for my picky vodka sauce daughter! I pureed the onions and garlic with the tomato after sauteing and it was thick even then. I was unsure about the amount of onion and garlic but it was perfect! The only thing I may add is a pinch of red pepper flakes since my daughter likes the spiciness of that addition.

Made this easy recipe last night for my family and they raved about it! I subbed in white zinfandel instead of vodka as I didn't have any around. This fed 3 of us with lots of sauce left over for another meal. Sooooo yummy!!

Delicious. A nice change from meat sauce. As other reviewers did I added some red pepper flakes.

Great recipe. But I would use diced tomatoes instead, and I used only 6 oz of tomato paste.  I also added large shrimp and frozen peas. Delicious!!

This was a very good recipe! I did alter it slightly by adding in half of a cup of parmesan cheese and allowing that to simmer along with the heavy cream. Will make again for sure! Does anyone know if you can freeze this?

Added blackened chicken for protein to round off the great sauce taste.

Super super bland. I followed the recipe as noted and even used very good quality canned plum tomatoes (san marzano) organic tomato paste & a spanish onion.

Good but not great IMO. I found it to be just a bit bland (not sure how with that much garlic). I added some crushed red pepper and that helped a bit. I think next time I will saute my spicy Italian sausage first and then cook the onion garlic and tomatoes in the rendered fat.
