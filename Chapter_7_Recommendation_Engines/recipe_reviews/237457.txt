I liked the addition of the pasta to this tuna salad, but the ratio of tuna to pasta was off for us.  Fortunately, I didn’t add all of the cooked pasta at one time, added about 3/4 of it, which probably equates to about 5-6 oz (rather than the 8 oz that I cooked).  Adding all of the pasta certainly would be a way to stretch the budget, that’s for sure, but you will lose some of the tuna flavor.  We don't eat bacon bits, so I cooked crisp a couple slices of bacon which worked out well.  This recipe makes a lot, and in this house, this is definitely five main course servings, rather than a side dish. I added a bit of chopped red bell pepper which gave it a pop of color and a little crunch, and after I took the photo, added  some green peas (great addition!).  Hubby is much more of a tuna lover than I, and he REALLY liked it, and I LIKED it.  Thanks for sharing.

I made this with some substitutions because I didn't have a couple of items. I added Mancini's Giardiniera to give it some kick.  I didn't have bacon bits and my pasta box was bigger than 8 oz. so I added another can of tuna. I also threw in some Italian seasoning and my husband really liked it. I would like to make it as written sometime soon!

Used: Lime and Cracked Pepper Tuna (rather then plain), only 1/4 cup of Mayo, Lime juice instead of Lemon Juice and Lemon Pepper instead of black pepper. We also added Corn Kernels, Cherry tomatoes and Green Peas. Waiting for the salad to meld and tasting top occur

Tasty, quick, easy - I used red lentil pasta and added Celery and some shredded red cabbage instead of bacon or bacon bits. Very yummy.

Delicious. Little less mayo and more bacon. Lemon adds great flavor.

I do not like canned tuna but I tried this at my inlaws house and I liked it. The tuna was not overpowering.
