Wow!  This was very easy to make and sooo good!  I am glad I doubled the recipe, because we were definitely hoping to eat this again.  It is easy, but very good!  The only change I made was to simmer the chicken for a bit longer than the recipe suggests.  I served this in a bowl over garlic mashed potatoes!  Yum!

This really was fantastic and so quick. Only adjustments I made were omitting the garlic (my family does not care for garlic) and using pre-cut chicken tenderloin strips (you can see from the pic they were about 2 inches wide x 3.5 inches long) which made the cooking time slightly longer (but only like a minute or so). My hubby and kids were begging for seconds and bc I doubled the recipe (we have a large family), they were so excited to have the leftovers the following night! The only criticism I would make is marinading it in the bbq/Worcestershire mix for an hour or so before cooking (which really isn't a criticism bc I haven't tried it and don't know if would REALLY make a difference). However, it would obviously extend the prep time...and not make it a "quick" dinner but might meld the flavors slightly better. I will try it next time (and there will be a next time) and update my review (or maybe someone else will try the marinade step and post the findings in the meantime). This aside, it still gets 5 stars for being fantastic. We served this with mashed potatoes (pre-made refrigerated kind) and steamed green beans. Thanks "Aaron" for a great and fast dinner!

It's chicken W/BBQ sauce on it. I thought the Wostershire & butter would change the BBQ sauce taste some....not really. It makes the sauce thinner & cooking it down so it thickend at the end is good, but all in all its chicken in BBQ sauce.

If I can get my barbecue sauce hating husband to eat barbecue chicken you get five stars. My family loves this recipe and it easy and quick to make too. I don't cook the chicken in a sauce pan I brush chicken breast with the sauce and bake them in the oven for about 35 minutes. Great recipe thank you.

Very tasty.  I found this online today when I was looking for something quick to make.   What a perfect way to "jazz" up bottled barbecue sauce (because basically that is what you are doing). Much better than just the barbecue sauce. I also added about a 1 1/2 tablespoons of honey. Once I heated everything up, I poured it over the chicken and baked it (covered) at 350 degrees for about 40 minutes. This is very very good. I will be making this again

I really like how fast this was to make. I added a dash of liquid smoke. This is going to be one of my go to chicken recipes since I only have like 30 minutes to get dinner done.

I modified this in that I used individually quick frozen chicken tenders.  I cooked the chicken frozen in a mix of butter and olive oil, when the chicken was cooked through I added the sauces and garlic, cooking until thickened.  Very tasty, was quite a hit with family and friends that were over.  I will definitely be making this again.

This recipe was so easy to make.  It was a lifesaver when I had not planned ahead and was able to whip this up quickly.  My whole family ate it, which is very rare.  I had leftovers and warmed up the chicken in the microwave the next day and added it to a salad.  It was even better the second day.

Thank you so much for sharing this simple but delicious recipe.  I cook most every night but sometimes just want a simplistic way to come up with something quick and tasty.  This recipe is really good.  P.S.  Ignore any negative comments.  It's great to get alternative ideas to improve upon a recipe and then there are others who just feel the need to be negative instead of appreciating your kindness to share a recipe.  Thanks again!!!

Thanks for posting!  I was going to make chicken and stuffing but didn't have stuffing and didn't want to go to the store.  I had these ingredients and it was great!  I added fresh sliced mushrooms and served on egg noodles.

Delicious recipe!! I was blown away by the simplicity and was surprised there were no tweaks on this one! Like Sweettreats, my husband hates BBQ sauce but I had him try it yesterday without telling him he couldn't tell and said it was good XD Thats when you know you got full stars. My husband is Indian so I spiced it up with chili powder, course pepper, little more butter, onion powder, and then roasted the thighs and wings in the oven; delectable.

Loved it! Simple. Great recipe for a good dinner after a long day at work. First time I made it with a honey barbecue sauce. It was too sweet for this recipe, so I tried Jack Daniels barbecue sauce. It was much better.

I agree with the user who stated this is chicken with BBQ sauce on it. My question is how can this cook to a safe temp in 10 min? I cooked it longer and it still felt questionably mushy/under-cooked.

Ok so i am 14 and i made this. It goes to the simplicity of this meal!! It is amazing and super simple. My mom didn't like the sound of it at first, but once she tried it, she said she can never discriminate a meal again. My family love it!!

I made this and it was a big hit at our house!!  I started by doubling the sauce recipe.  I left out the garlic powder and added 1 Tablespoon Honey (single recipe).  Plus I used KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce, original flavor, for the barbecue sauce.  I used chicken tenders and sprinkled some McCormick Grill Mates Barbecue flavor on the chicken and then seared the chicken for just a minute on all sides in a dry pan, no oil. I then placed the chicken into a Pyrex dish sprayed with Pam, and spread the sauce on kinda thick.  Baked at 425° for about 15 minutes.  There was a lot of sauce left so my husband used some of it on the RIBS that were getting ready to go on the grill!  He later said it was the best rib sauce he ever had!!  There was even some sauce left for dipping!  I'll definitely use this recipe again...and again...!!!

I love this recipe.. It is super easy and it tastes GREAT. However if you want to mess with it you can add almost any spice to add a different layer to the flavor. tonight I added seasoned salt, Onion powder, Pepper, and Lemon Juice.

My 9 year old son and I made this together. It was easy enough for him to follow and it came out great! There were no left overs, which is rare in this house. We did add a little lemon juice and soy sauce to it. Thanks for the great quick meal!!!

Thank God for the pregnant tired wife, this recipe is so quick, easy & delicious. What I did different was, I added a lil more of everything than the recipe required & I seasoned my meat before cooking & cooked for 5 min on each side on med heat. This recipe is very fool proof, anyone can do it

Smells divine, meat is tender and tastes really good.  I cut mine into nuggets because it's easier to eat and sauce and it came out wonderfully :)

So easy and flavorful! I served it with rice and broccoli and it was a big hit. Perfect for a last-minute weeknight dinner - and it won't send you running to the grocery store. I'm even thinking about using this chicken to make BBQ chicken pizza in the future.

This is good, but you gotta dredge the chicken in flour first and brown it. Remove from pan, then make the sauce and add the chicken.

This was fantastic! I'm generally not a huge BBQ person, but this had a nice subtle taste and was unbelievably tender. So easy! Used Jack Daniels BBQ sauce the first time. Second time, I used trader joes sriracha garlic BBQ sauce and both were great.

I absolutely loved this recipe, needed a fast tasty meal for my 4 boys. So I chose this one and even my kids loved it. I did change 1 thing, the bbq sauce can be spicy, so in place of 2/3c of bbq, I added 1/3c ketchup and 1/3c of bbq and the family loved it. Will be making this one again soon.

"It's like fancy restaurant chicken," my husband said. Huge compliment from the grill master  since I never cook meat inside. Very easy.  I did have to use A1 since I was out of Worcestershire, but I'm sure what the recipe calls for would be even better!

My husband is a bit of a picky eater. No meat is good until it has had a good helping of salt on it. Ever since I learned that, I have made a list of recipes he doesn't ask for the shaker. This one made that list.

Very, very easy to fix and generally have ingredients on hand so can throw together quickly in an 'emergency' when unexpected family/friends drop by. Came out very tender, too.  But, nothing special on the whole and the overall taste is very dependent on the barbeque sauce being used.

This was SO yummy and extremely easy to make and pretty quick too!  I had a surprise visitor tonight (11 year old girl) and she along with my 8 year old LOVED it.  I followed the recipe exactly and really enjoyed the flavor and texture of the chicken.

My first recipe to try since I discovered allrecipes.com and I was not disappointed. Incredibly simple, used the remains from a couple Kraft Thick'N'Spicy BBQ bottles from a cookout. Chicken came out very moist and flavorful. The main picture doesn't at all do the chicken justice, as when cooked to recipe the chicken should have a nice thick glaze-like sauce all over it.

For the kitchen without a spice rack to rival Penzey's, this recipe is a lifesaver.

We thought this was just ok.  Agreed with the reviewer that said fresh ingredients would have helped this dish.  I do give it points for ease of preparation.  Doubt I make this again for me and hubs, but will keep the recipe for when the grandkids come over because it seems very kid-friendly.

This was SUPER easy and delicious! My hubby and I both liked the taste. I loved how easy it was to throw together after a long day at work. I did cube up the chicken into bite sized pieces before cooking.  Made for easy eating. We served it with rice and green beans.

I waited until the last moment to defrost chicken. My boyfriend was due home in less than an hour & I had nothing planned. I had previously saved this recipe & decided to try it out. We REALLY enjoyed this chicken, especially because of how easy it was. I seasoned the chicken with pepper & onion powder (& a pinch of salt). I also doubled the sauce & served over rice. The cooking time was a bit longer than stated. After dinner we headed out to the store and coming back inside the entire apartment building smelled of this delicous dish! thanks!!

This was great!  As a new cook, I look for quick and easy meals to make after work, and this totally fit the bill.  My chicken took a bit longer to cook, but that was okay.  The sauce was good and had a nice little kick to it.  I will serve the leftovers over rice for tomorrows dinner!

I made this and loved the flavor! However, I used a different cooking method due to what I was cooking on the stovetop. I ended up marinading this overnight, adding minced garlic, and then baking it for 25 minutes at 350. It came out great! I used chicken thighs when making it.

This was delicious and saved me on an emergency cooking day. I have pretty spicy barbecue sauce, so I added ketchup as half the sauce. Turned out perfect!

Really Quick. Really Easy and came out perfect using whatever was in the refrigerator. Next time I may use a different BBQ sauce jut for variety.  This was a winner.

I used thighs and they turned out great. I like TJ's BBQ sauces (no HFCS...just good old sugar). Real garlic and ginger could be good w/ prawns. I'll fix this again after I use the frozen leftover sauce.

I love this recipe!  Pretty easy.  I did tweak it a bit.  Used fresh garlic in the sauce and pit chix in oven instead of stove.  Delish!  Thanks for the crafty idea.

Loved this!  So simple!  Too much sauce, though.  I halved the recipe and it was perfect.

I changed two things. I cooked the chicken from Frozen in my insta pot since it was frozen and I was hungry! I also added some minced garlic in place of the garlic powder. Tossed the cooked chicken with the sauce in my iron skillet and it turned out amazing!

I kind of liked it but I would brown the chicken before stirring in the sauce otherwise the skin is rubbery instead of crispy

My son found this recipe and made it as the recipe stated.  We loved it!  Yes it is jazzed up bbq sauce but it had a sweet tangy flavor to it.  Think I am going to try the sauce over round steak in the crock pot.  Thank  you for the sharing this!  Yummy!

I just eyeballed the bbq (2 different kinds) and Worcestershire sauce and used a whole clove of garlic and just a couple shakes of garlic powder and it turned out awesome! i definitely let it cook longer to caramelize more and get more thick. Then served with roasted veggies :)

The only thing different I did was cut down the Chicken Breasts and baked it at 400 for 35 minutes (time would carry, use a meat thermometer).

We had a large package of chicken so we were making two meals...found this recipe super easy, had all ingredients on hand and everyone loved it! Will definitely add to the regular schedule for meals. We did not adjust anything although we measure by eyeballing...lol

I used chopped garlic instead of powdered,  still didn't change the taste of the BBQ sauce flavor,  I also marinated it for an hour before cooking.  Turned out well everyone liked it, will probably make it again :)

Excellent taste! I have made this several times- I stick to the recipe, just cutting the chicken a little different. I made the pieces bite sized instead of strips.

I agree with another poster who said this was nothing more than chicken with bbq sauce. It wasn’t bad, it just isn’t something that knocked my socks off.

This was extremely easy to make! If you have a little more time than 15 mins let the meat marinate in the sauce for 30 mins. My husband and I hate bbq sauce items, but my husband and I both killed it.

On Wednesday night, I've made this and have leftover chicken with using half a chicken breast for my meal. I've used Sweet Baby Ray's Hawaiian BBQ sauce and didn't add any flavors to season it.  It was real good! I'll make it again.

It was good as it was but it was pretty much BBQ so I added chili powder and a pinch of crushed red pepper to spice it up a bit . My kids ate all but 3 pieces so it must have been good lol. Also since I wasn't pressed for time I put it together this morning and let it marinade a few hours then cooked it slowly

Was tasty but reminder as they are strips don't cook for too long.  Good base recipe.  I added garlic powder and dried chopped onion.

I liked it, but it would be better if the sauce would thicken.  It is easy, though, and I would make it again.

This is so very good. I needed a fast recipe for a chicken quarter I had to cook and tried this. I added some balsamic vinegar with everything else and used my frying pan and simmered it on the stove. My Mom eat every bit and she is VERY picky

Yes, this really is a no brainer, however, it DID offer me a suggestion (that I never would have thought of on my own) when I was stumped for a quick meal.  I happened to have frozen chicken breast strips, and some homemade Jack Daniel's Stillhouse bbq sauce, so, voila!  It was a great meal with a baked potato and salad. Oh, and, the sauce, which I also added sautéed onions, was also great over the potato.

It wasn't great. After reading other's reviews I decided to go easy on the BBQ sauce and increase the other ingredients. but it still was overpowered by the BBQ sauce. I don't hate BBQ sauce(otherwise why would I have made it?) but it just seemed like I saturated it in the sauce and called it a day. My 12 year old didn't like it either.

This was very tasty. The ingredients change up the bbq sauce just enough. I used the exact ingredients listed, the only difference is the way I cooked it. I sautéed the chicken separately in butter, then mixed the sauce heated it up and then added the chicken. The reason I did this was because other reviewers said that the sauce was a little runny because of the juices from the chicken. By cooking them separately I didn’t have this problem. Next time I will double the sauce portion so that there is enough to go over pasta or rice. Super fast recipe will definitely make this again.

It's good and worth making again but the sauce thins out so much with the chicken juice. Need to leave the cover off to let it boil off and thicken.

This is the first time since I've returned to meat-eating that I've enjoyed chicken.  I cooked it probably a little longer than you suggested and I added salt and pepper, too.  And I love how tender the chicken got.
I'll be making this one again.

Very simple, quick, and flavorful! Was very skeptical to make it at first but after reading the reviews, I just had to try it. I made it as is the first time. The second time, I sauteed some onions first with the butter then add the rest as in the recipe.

This is a great simple main dish. I did make a few changes. I used 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce, 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, 3 cloves of minced garlic, and then I threw in some minced onion, black pepper, and a little bbq chicken rub. It turned out great. Our daughter never eats bbq sauce on anything, but she ate this. We served it with baked broccoli and rice.

Very tasty and easy to make! I did simmer mine for 25 minutes on medium-low (low on my stove since it tends to warm more than it implies), ended up with very moist and well cooked chicken.

This was decent BBQ chicken on a night without much time to cook. Husband like it, and I may make again, but it's not in the regular rotation.

This was sooooo easy and tasty. I really liked the addition of the Worcestershire sauce. It made the sauce a little tangy.

My family is very picky about bbq chicken: some like it grilled on, some add after grilling, and one only likes bbq as a fries dipping sauce. Everyone ate this up! Definitely adding to my regular meals list.

The chicken did not pick up enough flavor just even justify adding more to the bbq.  Emergency chicken, only.

I didn't have garlic powder :/ so I saluted minced garlic in the butter a little and then added the rest into pan. I realized after I did that, maybe the recipe just meant to coat the chicken and put into pan and keep sauce in a bowl outside pan? But it still came out so yummy :) we should have made more for us. Next time! Loved how quick and yummy!

Easy and yummy. I was out of Worcestershire sauce so I used cider vinegar. And added some brown sugar. In the last few minutes I tossed in some broccoli. Adding the sugar aided in the caramelization of the sauce.

ATTENTION : Mom's with picky kids (or husbands..) This one is a WINNER! My 8 yr old son who complains Every time I make chicken, absolutely loved this recipe!  i was SHOCKED when he said, "Mom, this is awesome! I want to eat it everyday! And even for Breakfast, lunch and dinner.." haha.  My husband loved it too! He gave a thumbs up, AWESOME!.  I made the recipe as it says, no need to change it at all. I made with Sweet Baby Rays bbq sauce and put it over mashed potatoes.

As one other reviewer put it, this is chicken with BBQ sauce. Not that great, but not terrible. Butter, garlic powder, and Worcestershire sauce don't add any noticeable difference to the meal (I made some chicken separately without these ingredients and no one was the wiser once I told them). Skip these ingredients and just cook your chicken in the BBQ sauce.

I was really surprised by this recipe...so very good!! And just like the recipe title says, it was an "Emergency Chicken" for us too?? Scrambling around the kitchen trying to figure out what to make for dinner one night I pulled up this app & this recipe. I double the sauce, used whole frozen breasts & it worked great! We actually used homemade sauce someone had made & it had great flavor along with the other ingredients. Highly recommend!!

Really great. Made exactly as listed, my chicken tenders were a bit thick so I think I ended up simmering for closer to 8-10 minutes, then let the sauce thicken. Very well received by my husband. We served over an Asian style rice and veggie mixture. delicious - we will definitely make again, this simple recipe is a keeper for a go-to meal on busy days.

As usual, messed with the recipe a bit. Had a total of about 1 1/4 lb chicken. half from rotisserie breast the rest raw boneless skinless thighs so sauteed thigh strips; cooked down the sauce then added the cooked chicken. Quick, easy and yummy!

Made mine in cubes., just because we like our chicken that way. I didn't realize I was out of worcestershire sauce, so I used some soy sauce. I added a bit of minced onions and about a tablespoon of honey. I did cook it a few minutes long than suggested because I am terrified of undercooked chicken. It was pretty good!

Amazing recipe! I was so sad I didn't have any potatoes! Instead of garlic powder, I used fresh minced garlic (we are garlic freaks in my house) and squeezed a lemon into it. AMAZING. I had absolutely no idea what I was going to do for dinner I just thawed out two breasts and while I waited I found this recipe! Put it together with some cheesy rice and was good to go!

I started putting stuff together and realized I didn't have any BBQ sauce.  I used 2/3 c Herdez Salsa Casera Medium.  Turned out great.  Definitely will try it again.

I gave it four stars because I changed the BBQ sauce to chile sauce because we don't care for BBQ.  Also rubbed fresh minced garlic , salt, pepper and a little olive  oil  on the chicken and let it sit in the refrig covered  for about two hours.It was very good.

This was very easy and good. And I had everything on hand !  I served it over egg noodles and added a salad. Clean up was a breeze ,too. Another "I'm tired and I don't want to cook" recipe to add to my short list.

I made this last night - the directions were a little unclear on the cooking of the dish.

So I cooked with the chicken with the sauce in a wok-style frying pan covered on medium for 4-5 minutes and then removed the cover and cooked for 5 more.

The only change I made to the sauce was the addition of Hungarian Paprika to "kick it up a notch" (the way my wife likes it) and it was a SMASHING success!!

Definitely a keeper - will be making again!

Easy, flavorful and everyone liked it.  I cooked 4 thin sliced chicken breasts and the water from the chicken thinned the sauce.  I poured the sauce in the pan and reduced it.  Thus recipe is a keeper.  And so easy.

A little roux will thicken the sauce. Naturally, a little Sriracha improves things.

I fall back on this recipe at least once every other week or so. It's quick, it's easy and it's incredibly tasty. I usually have all of the ingredients. In fact, chicken breasts are a staple on my grocery list.

I liked this a lot and not taking away from it but another way we love is to cook the chicken in 1/2 water - 1/2 heinz 57 sauce depending on the amount of chicken your using and I cook it down 30 minutes or so.

this was, EASY.. and GOOD.. my 9 and 5 yr loved it, and that's all that really matters for me.. as an elemtrary teacher and tired on Friday night, family didn't feel like deep fried easy.. this was it!! I liked it for the fact that it was simple and all on hand, just had to grab the chicken on my way home.. served with Lipton chicken noodles and fresh tossed salad.. next  time I'll double it,  and with left overs I'll make shredded chicken..  my 9yr old son wanted 3rds.. it's a staple in our house.. thanks for sharing

We love this dish so much!  We eat it at least every 6 weeks because it is so good, and so easy!!  We do add a bit more chicken than it calls for, and we cube it into 1 inch cubes so that it will cook faster and is easier to eat for kids.  Love it!!

This was a hit with my very picky husband.  I cooked the chicken how the recipe says except I used "garlic expressions" dressing instead of bbq sauce and Worcester.  It was delicious.

The success of this recipe REALLY depends on the BBQ sauce you buy. 
I found that using generic BBQ sauce that has a mild flavor does the trick (Specifically, the Stop & Shop brand). When I experimented with Kraft BBQ sauce, the flavor was overwhelming IMO.

Wow!!! super easy and delicious!    I was a little  aprehensive at first,  but it came out great! I used skinnless, boneless  chicken thighs since thats all I had on hand. I doubled the patch because  I have a family that can EAT! It was great flavor combination  and my family and I  loved it! I made it Mexican  rice and was a big hit! Thank you for a great recipe !

This was an amazing chicken dish! My boyfriend and I just moved into our new apartment so our kitchen was pretty empty to start off with. We followed the recipe exactly and it was one of the greatest dishes we've ever had!! Quick, easy and delicious. Thanks for posting!

I would make this again.  the chicken I used turned out a bit tough, I think I overcooked it.  but the sauce was very tasty and you can't beat it for a quick meal.  the kids enjoyed it as well.

This is my go to recipe when I need something hardy and fast. Delicious, just the way it is! If you cook it longer, it carmelizes the sauce and is SOOO good! Great to pair with ANY side, tonight was paired with a ten minute boil bag of brown rice. So quick and so good!

My family loves this recipe! I pan sear my chicken for a little added flavor.  Instead of garlic powder I add crushed garlic to the melted butter in the frying pan then I add the sauce and meat. I also simmer for about 15 minutes. Tonight we are trying the sauce with thinly sliced pan seared pork cutlets.

I had two boneless chicken breasts and wasn't sure what I wanted to do with them.  Tried this today and thought it was great.  Added a salad and rice pilaf with the chicken.  Very simple and tasty.

Great recipe. I used fresh garlic and added extra seasonings but otherwise followed the recipe. I have loved simple BBQ chicken since I was a child. I really liked this slight change of taste to a meal I already loved. I will make it this way from now on.

It was very good and simple to make as advertised.  I do not care for Barbecue sauce so was a bit hesitant, but it was very good.  My husband loved it.  I only used 1 chicken breast for the both of us, so no leftovers, but will have to make again soon.

I'm always looking for fast tasty meals that my family would love and this was a big hit! I used hickory barbecue sauce out of necessity since it was what I had on hand. It gave it an outdoor grilled edge. I've already shared this with my daughter & I will recommend it to many of my friends.

Easy and my hubby and four year old loved it. I served over white rice and peas on the side. I cooked half an onion in the butter before adding the BBQ sauce. I used real garlic instead of powder and for a little kick I added a touch of chipotle pepper. Delic!

Killer! What a great idea and agree it is very flavorful! I feel like there could be a fresh something thrown in, like red peppers or scallions, but it is brilliant as written.

Like its name, this recipe surely is one of the easiest and fastest for making a chicken dish that's delicious and comforting to the stomach...it's truly one of those recipes when you're in a hurry or simply lazy to spend more than 20 minutes cooking. Both of my husband and i love it, and we had it with rice and mixed veggies...but next time we're gonna eat it with mash potatoes.
