I am delighted to be the first to review Occasional Cooker's newly published recipe.  I made these when it was still a personal recipe and here is my review:  Occasional Cooker has a great recipe here! I did change the method by baking my wings in the oven first, without the sauce (this can even be done a day or two in advance), and then grilling them using the sauce as a basting/dipping sauce. Turned out great!! I used a product called Thai Chili Garlic Paste, which is really hot, so I did cut back on the amount and just added it to taste. I also used fresh ginger (3 times as much) for the dried. Hubs and I really enjoyed these and didnâ€™t find them to be too sweet at all. Thank you, Occasional Cooker! This will be repeated for sure!!

I made this recipe exactly as stated, only I used drumsticks and thighs since I didn't have wings.  This was very tasty.  I also dialed down the chile sauce for my kids, but if it were for just me and my husband I would have added exactly what was indicated in the recipe.  It helps if you turn up your oven the last 10 minutes of cooking to "crisp" up the skin.

This dish was a deliciously sweet savoury item with fantastic flavours mixed through. Easy to handle for spice-accustomed with a tang, yet a larger challenge for those who don't have a hot tongue. However the chicken is well cooked... for Western standards....Asians tend to like chicken cooked through, tender and chewy. This chicken felt too raw for good Asian taste for me.

Excellent dish! I loved how all the flavors came together. I used 2lbs of drumsticks & 2lbs of chicken thighs (skin removed) and there was more then enough sauce. If using drumsticks & thigh's use a baking sheet a little deeper, to collect the juice run off. Make sure you brush the sauce over chicken every 15min like the recipe calls for and it will caramelize perfectly! I also used pureed ginger instead of fresh & it also gave great flavour. This recipe would also work good on the BBQ. This is a keeper!

Just finished making these and my children, as well as myself, love them.  Honestly, I've never taken the time to rate the recipes I've made, but felt that this one deserved it.  I made extra sauce because I like mine coated.  I put them under the broiler to get them extra crispy.

Tried it for the first time today...Loved it.  I reduced the sugar and used pineapple Teriyaki sauce instead.  

Didn't have the chile-garlic sauce so I used regular pepper flakes and added 1 more glove of garlic. 

I also like having my wings with sauce so instead of just basting it I threw the entire mixture over it and just let it slow bake.

YUMMY!!!

I scaled this recipe down for just the two of us, and used breast and made boneless wings. I did marinate my breast tenders in a little bit of the sauce since white meat could dry out when baking. They cooked up nicely in 20 minutes. The sauce is wonderful and would taste great on just about anything, I would like to try some grilled salmon with it. Thanks Occasional Cook for a great recipe.

I subsituted honey for the brown sugar. I used drumettes and dipped them in the sauce  before placing on the cookie sheet. I poured the remainder sauce over them.  I did not baste them. I cooked them for 40 minutes. They were delicious.

These were fabulous!  Took them to a Super Bowl party and everyone loved them!  So flavorful!  I used Tyson frozen chicken wings and rinsed the ice glaze off before cooking- will definitely make again!

I used chicken quaters  since I didn't have wings. The sauce was perfect amount for 2 pieces of chicken quaters. I brushed the sauce over chicken every 15min. Baked it about 45 minutes until it reached 165F . Serve it with white rice.

Made as directed except for using one more clove of garlic and I only had regular chili sauce, not garlic chili sauce. I used 2 lbs of wingettes/drumsticks. Next time I will double the sauce as I only had enough to baste once. I will make again because they are very tasty. One note: this burnt the bejesus out of my baking sheet. Mama Mia, thank God for barkeeper's friend. Next time FOIL the pan.

Took these wings to a Superbowl party on 2/2/14 to watch our Seahawks kick the Broncos' butts! Everyone loved the wings.  I ran out of my chile/garlic sauce, so squirted in some Siracha.  Could have used more, as the wings weren't spicy enough for me.  But they sure are tasty.  Also rather than laying the wings on the pan and then brushing them with sauce, I threw them all in a large bowl with the sauce and just bathed them in it.  Knocked off the extra and laid them individually and already sauced on the pan.  Yum!!

Did not have Chili-Garlic sauce, so used sweet chili sauce and one extra garlic clove. Cooked for a total of 60 minutes, turning and basting after 20, 20 and 10 minutes. Baking for a final 10 minutes. Done perfectly. We loved this recipe!

I was tasked with bringing chicken to our neighborhood Chinese New Years celebration so I made this using drumsticks instead.  I quadrupled the recipe for 54 drumsticks and used 3 cups of the sauce to marinade the chicken for 2 hours first.  I baked them for one hour and basted twice with the remaining sauce I had them under the broiler for 2 minutes and the turned out GREAT!  BIG hit at our function!

Do not hesitate a moment to try this recipe.  I have never attempted wings and wanted to bring some to a party I was invited to.  They were the hit of the party!  Spicy, sweet, crunchy, gooey deliciousness.  I added extra garlic, and globbed the sauce on rather than daintily brushing it on.  Had for a meal with jasmine rice and salad with ginger dressing and then made some for my party which I kept simple with a few chopped scallions on top. All was consumed in less than half hour.  I can't wait to make it again and maybe broil it the last 5  minutes to get a bit of char on top.  Amazingly good and best of all, EASY!!!!!

Followed another reviewer's suggestion to mix the marinade and the wings in a ziploc bag first and then toss the wings and the marinade into a 9 x 11 baking dish.  These turned out pretty darned good and I will add this recipe to my favorite chicken wing collection. Will be repeating this for sure. Thanks for posting.

Used honey in place of brown sugar, 1t ground ginger.  We ended up broiling at the end of 40 minutes to try and get a little crispness.

I made this recipe with drumsticks. They were delicious! I did not have low sodium teriyaki sauce so I used regular. I cut the ginger in half. I also used 1/2 tablespoon of minced garlic in place of garlic cloves. I added a tablespoon of hot sriracha sauce to spice it up a little. We baked them in our air oven and brushed the sauce the last 10 minutes. Will make again for sure!!!

I made this recipe last weekend and am making it again today.  I have made many recipes from this site and have always read the comments and taken them according to what I and my family likes.  I used honey as one user suggested the first time I made these and my son and I LOVED them.  Hubby said they could have used some hot sauce so this time I put in a little hot sauce in.  We all love wings and my son said it was a nice change from the hot wings he usually gets.  I am addicted to this recipe!

These wings are pretty mild. Easy to make. I would make again ...but would kick up the spice a bit.  I like with a bit more zing but with a mixed crowd good for all.  Young kids could handle no problem.

This is a great recipe and I've made it many times with some variations on the sauce. It's the hoisin, garlic, and ginger root that makes the sauce. I marinate these over night and have grilled and fried them. They go good with fried rice.

Great recipe and went over well at the Super Bowl party. Ended up using 4 lbs. of wings because couldn't find 3, just added a little extra of the ingredient and only brought 2 wings home. Baked them and moved to crockpot to keep warm. Will make again.

I used all the same ingredients but changed the cooking method. It was too hot to turn the oven on so I grilled the wings. When cooked through, I tossed them in the sauce and then grilled them for a few more minutes, turning a few times,with the lid open. They looked beautiful, just like the picture. The flavor was lacking something though, just can't put my finger on it. Will definitely make them again.

Yeah, this dish was great! I gave it 3 stars only because the chicken was a little too raw for me. The taste was wonderful though.

This was a very flavorful dish. It was the Saturday before Super Bowl when I decided to make this so needless to say there were no wings left at the store. I instead chose to make it with tenders. A much healthier approach as well. Just make sure to cook it for a shorter time.
