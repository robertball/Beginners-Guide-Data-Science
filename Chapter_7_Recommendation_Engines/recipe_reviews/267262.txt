I did change the method of this recipe slightly, as I used dry beans, rather than the canned. After sauteing the vegetables, I removed them to a bowl, added the dried beans (16 oz) to the pot, and covered with water by 1". Cooked on high pressure for 15 minutes, NPR 25 minutes, then opened the pressure cooker and added the vegetables back in and proceeded with the recipe. I did not use the chili powder (that just sounded strange to me for bean and ham soup), but instead added some fresh thyme and parsley. Overall, a tasty soup, and one that I would make again.

Very good soup! I am new to the instant pot.  I made navy beans before hand in the instant pot then added 6 cups cooked beans to the recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and it had a nice balance of broth to beans. The chili pepper gave it a nice color and added a little more flavor. Easy to make and I will make it again. Thanks for the recipe

The only ingredient I didn't use was celery. My family don't like it. It was very good and my husband wants it added to the menu.
