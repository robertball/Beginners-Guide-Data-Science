Wow.... I didn't have high hopes for this as most oven baked chicken fingers are just "so so", but these were fantastic! They had great flavor and the breading was nice and crispy. The sauce seemed like something my family wouldn't eat so I made my own: remaining 1/2 cup coconut milk (light), 1/4 cup water, juice from 1 lime, 2 tsp. soy sauce, 3 TBSP sugar and 3 TBSP corn starch. Whisk in a pot before putting on heat, bring to a boil and keep warm until served. My PICKY PICKY kids devoured this! Thanks!!!

I marinated my boneless, skinless chicken breast for 12 hours in coconut milk, grated ginger, lemon zest, a bit of garlic and soy sauce.  Other than that I followed the recipe and it was super moist, super delicious.  Keeper.

Love this chicken! I've made it 3 times now, and get great feedback from guests and family.  Tonight I served it with white rice, stir fried broccoli and pineapple with a terryaki sauce. I also cheated and used 2 chicken gravy packets as a sauce instead of the suggested sauce.  Thanks, katie!

This was interesting; I liked it but my husband seemed on the fence.  I mixed some coconut milk with the egg for coating the chicken.  I didn't make the coconut sauce, but instead mixed mayo, honey mustard and some cayenne together to make a sweet and tangy sauce.  Served with mashed potatoes and broccoli.

This is a great recipe and even if you tweak or substitute things a little it is pretty reliable to turn out yummy!  For example, I didn't have lime juice so I used lemon and my son eats GF so I used GF crumbs instead of panko and I combined all dry ingredients together, the GF flour, coconut and crumbs and the results were 5 start dining!  As for the sauce, I took advise from others and tweaked it a bit to suit the taste of my family...i still used the mayo and coconut milk but I added soy sauce about a tsp and cayenne for spice.  DELICIOUS chicken...my 8 and 2 year old devoured it, my daughter was on the fence (a little too different for her) and my hubby loved it and is having the left overs for lunch!  I made it as chicken breasts and served it with side salads.  Thanks for this awesome and unique recipe!

I enjoyed the flavor of this, but using the directions listed, my chicken pieces did not get very crispy or brown in the oven.  Some of them seemed a bit soggy.  I like mine browner, so I might try coating them with some pan spray before baking next time.  I didn't have coconut milk, so I used 3 T cream of coconut to 13 oz. h20.  I will make again.

WONDERFUL! I wanted a chicken recipe that was a little off the beaten path, and this was just the ticket. I made it nearly exactly as stated except for my use of full fat mayo instead of low fat :), and I pan fried them in coconut oil rather than baking them. The result was fantastic. The breading stayed attached just fine, the flavors balanced wonderfully, and the coconut was apparent without being overwhelming. The sauce was great too. I didn't really know what to expect with a mayo and coconut topping, but drizzling that on top was quite flavor enhancing. I added about a tsp of brown sugar to it for a bit more sweetness. I recommend that if you are into that kind of thing. 

Overall - fabulous recipe!

A little messy to make, but I have to say all three kids and a husband LOVED it.  I did not make the sauce because of the mayo, and instead served it with Saucy Susan to dip.  I made white rice and brocolli on the side.  Cooked it at 375 for 12 mnutes as my chicken was cut thin.  Very yummy, thanks for posting!!!

Great recipe!  I served it with steamed broccoli and a recipe for Pumpkin Cheddar Grits that I got from a local magazine.  The Coconut Carrots from this site might be a good pairing.

Good, but needs a couple tweaks. The ratio of 1 C. coconut and 1 C. bread crumbs, needs to be cut down so there is more coconut than bread crumbs. I didn't use the recipe's sauce. I used reviewers: 1/2 c. coconut milk, 1/4 c. water, juice of 1 lime, 3 T. sugar ( I only used 2 T.), 2 t. soy sauce and 2 T. cornstarch. Bring to boil, stirring constantly, and keep warm.  Maybe put chicken under broiler if doesn't brown enough.  Sauce was still pretty thick, maybe cut down to 1 1/2 t. cornstarch.

This was fantastic! I forgot I had to marinate them so I just skipped that step and just breaded them with some garlic powder in the bread crumb mixture. I also added some soy sauce to the sauce. I served it with the Asian coconut rice recipe from this site.

WOWSA !  This is a grreat recipe. I had coconut flour to use and I sprayed the finished chicken "fingers" with canola cooking spray before cooking. Wonderful, I made two sauces, the pineapple sauce you can find on this site and a savoury sauce with chicken broth, cornstarch, red pepper flakes. The coconut flavour came out more when dipped in the savoury sauce. So good. Thanks

Delicious! My boys love this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly except for the dipping sauce (step 5).  I hated to throw away the leftover marinade so I thoroughly cooked that as my dipping sauce and used the leftover coconut milk (plus water as needed) to boil rice so I had coconut rice to serve as a side dish.

Tried cooking this last night. Awesome recipe. I boiled the marinated sauce with chicken strips. Use the same recipe. Then coated the chicken strips. Instead of baking. I deep fried the chicken strips. Be sure to keep an eye with you're deep frying because the coconut coating cook fast. Thank you for sharing the recipe. Love it.

This was so good!!  I've tried other coconut chicken recipes and they have never turned crispy.  These were crispy and flavorful.  I substituted lemon juice for the lime juice but followed the other directions.  Very, very good!

My hubby and I LOVED this recipe. I pan fried it until crispy and baked it for 15 minutes at 350 to ensure it was no longer pink. I forgot to pound the chicken out and it came out fine anyways. I baked it the second time as the recipe suggests, however it was better fried and baked. Thank you for sharing your recipe. I now have another reason not to go out for a delicious Chinese meal!

This was a hit.  I cooked it in coconut oil and had a little bit of a hard time with it cooking too fast and burning.  This is not a flaw with the recipe at all just in my inexperience with coconut oil.  I omitted the coconut milk cause I didn't have any on hand but dipped the chicken in egg first.  I added panko bread crumbs to the coconut for tor the coating.  It came out delicious.  I also added some shredded coconut to rice and it was a wonderful compliment to this delicious dinner!

I absolutely loved this recipe. It was full of flavour. I left out the coconut flakes (not a huge fan) added an extra clove of garlic to the marinade. Followed directions perfectly and my chicken came out juicy on the inside and extra crispy on the outside! Cannot believe it was not fried. Served with brown rice and vegetables made an awesome healthy meal.

This was fantastic!! I used fresh lime juice instead of from a bottle and I didn't grind the coconut into crumbs, I put it in shredded with the panko instead. I also added shredded coconut to the sauce while it was cooking. Next time I think I will add small pineapple chunks to it as well. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Flavorful recipe that combines flavor and texture.  I added a dash of curry to the marinade. I also blended all the dry ingredients together in a blender which made a great texture on the chicken. Served with a jasmine rice and didn't include the mayo. Delicious.

This was a really easy, yummy recipe and very kid-friendly, too!  We all enjoyed it and I would definitely make it again.  My son didn't care for the sauce, but my husband and I liked it a lot.  The only change I made was to omit the salt (which I usually do) because the soy sauce is already salty.  Thanks a lot!!

This came out very well. I was a bit skeptical, I didn't think the flavors would seep into the meat well, but they actually did. I added a bit of ginger to my marinade, and also used sweet soy (it's all I had on hand, and I thought it would go well), turned out nicely! Also got a nice crisp from the panko breading, though after baking it seemed to want to come right off the chicken, but with careful handling I kept it all in place. I will make it again for sure! EDIT: Forgot to mention the sauce part. I felt like it would really lack on flavor if I just mixed the coconut milk with the mayonnaise, so what I did instead was put a bit of orange marmalade in the mix with some soy, mayo, the coconut milk, and a pinch of brown sugar. It worked well with the dish for us :)

My husband said "this is the best thing you have ever made" - fun to bread with my daughter - I didn't have any raw eggs, so we used chicken broth to coat.  I never actually heard of this (and have been to buffets) - but it tastes so healthy!

I was skeptical, but this is a great recipe!  It reminds me of coconut shrimp you commonly see on restaurant menus.  I did not make the sauce to go on the side, but I bet sweet chili sauce would go really well with it (though I didn't try it).

I really liked this recipe as a base. I bought some coconut for another recipe and needed to find another way to use it up. This worked. I of course pounded the chicken out so that it cooks quicker and stays moister. I used flax as an egg replacer and mixed it with the soy sauce and lemon instead of lime. I mixed the marinade in with the flax to coat the chicken and just used panko/coconut to coat. The breading adhered beautifully. I used sour cream instead of mayo and added a bit of soy sauce to the coconut cream sauce topping. It was not bursting with taste but had a very pleasant and mild coconut flavor. I probably won't make the recipe again because my kids didn't care for it. More for an adult palette.

My family loved this recipe.  I did something wrong when I made the gravy..I think I just need to cook it longer.  But the chicken didn't even need it.

Ooooooh yeah! Wish some kids here liked this one more cause I want to make this one more often. I dont think the coconut milk was necessary though. And I just drizzled it with cream of coconut. So I will make my own modifications next time.

I'd give this 10 stars if I could. The only change I made was to substitute low sodium salt for the soy sauce. I have high blood pressure and am forbidden from the soy by the doc. I first made this for my best friends family and there were no left overs.

Tried this on Father's Day weekend and we loved the chicken!  The sauce...not so much.  We found it really bland and in much need of spicing up.  I'll make the chicken again for sure, but without the sauce.

Delicious and easy! My family loved this recipe. Even my 12 year old picky eater. I served with French fries and instead of the dipping sauce in the recipe I used a sweet and sour red sauce. Will absolutely make again!

I thought the chicken was great.  I might have sliced mine thinner because it only took about 20 minutes to cook.  I did flip them half way through.  We decided that this would be good with shrimp as well.  The only thing was that no one in my family wanted to eat the sauce, so I made a basic sweet and sour sauce and instead of pinapple juice I used the coconut milk and a squeeze of lime.  Everyone loved that with the chicken.

I followed directions pretty closely. The only thing I differed from in the directions was the time the chicken spent marinating. I was in a rush and only marinated it for an hour. It still turned out well and was moist and coconuty underneath the perfectly crunchy crust. I also didn’t make the sauce this time around but it was still well received. My son and husband both loved it. I think it’s their new favorite chicken recipe I make. We’re all quite happy with it.

Prepared exactly as written. Love the concept; this technique provides wonderful crunch but without unhealthy frying. But there wasn't enough flavor. Will try again with the following changes: add Siracha and use 3-4x more soy sauce & lime juice in marinade; use parchment paper instead of foil to line pan; spray tops of prepared chicken strips with cooking spray; bake 20-25 minutes. Served the dish with pineapple fried rice.

This recipe was very good!  My husband loved it, too! I followed the recipe as written. The only suggestion that I would make is to forget the foil and use some non-stick cooking spray. I also needed 2 eggs to coat all of the pieces. This recipe will be added to our favorites list.

Really good! I didn't make the sauce for dipping but  the chicken turned out great! My picky 3 year old even loved it. I will definitely make it again!

I did not have coconut milk or lime juice so I marinaded with regular milk and lemon juice. Also, I had to use 2 eggs- small adjustments.

Easy and quick!

The marinade = super fantastic!  Started to do the egg, flour & crumbs but the coconut/panko wasn't staying on the chik very well.  I skipped the egg & flour. Marinade straight to toasted shredded coconut. Worked much better.
Hubby says next time make more!  Very tasty.

I thought this was delicious and so did my family and friends. I left out the lime juice because I didn't have any and used light coconut milk. Only had time to let it marinate for a few minutes. For the sauce (which was quickly devoured), I used coconut milk, soy sauce and cornstarch. Delicious, will make again!

Pretty good, but I thought there would be more flavor after marinating all day.  The chicken was cooked perfectly as described and the breading had great texture, but just not much flavor.  I guess I was expecting a stronger flavor like coconut shrimp in restaurants.  I'll make it again, but just not for guests or a weekly staple.

This is a great recipe. I am new to this whole cooking thing and it was easy. I love the fact that it wasn't fried. Familly loved it too!  Any other ideas for sides? Can't wait to try this with Prawns.

I used coconut flour, silk almond milk and didn't realize until I started the preparation I was to marinate for a minimum of 3 hours but I was committed!  So the marinate was more like a half hour total. But it was good ! Will do it again and have it marinate as required. Also the time suggested (30 minutes) to cook the chicken at that temperature is too much in my opinion. Cook at 350 and then broil for the last five to crisp and brown up the top !  We ended up eating late but it was worth it.

Used a cup coconut flour instead of plain and did not process shredded coconut, left whole to ramp up the coconut flavor.  The sauce is critical, perfect for the finished strips.

We loved this chicken! It was sooo good! I only had coconut water so I used that and 2% milk in the marinade. I sprayed with cooking spray before putting in the oven. Delicious! Oh I made rice with left over coconut water and it was also yummy!

I made a few substitutions to be more carb-friendly and it still came out great: almond flour, wheat panko, unsweetened coconut, tablespoon Swerve. Also used tamari instead of soy sauce, and included it plus lime juice in the sauce as well.

What a perfect, flavorful chicken dish! The dipping sauce was good, too, but I don't think it's necessary. Still trying to figure out the best sides to go with it, but I'll definitely be making this again!

More work than is justified by the finished product. It does not brown and I have found there really is too much coconut milk. It is not a nice looking dish at all and that is important to me and my family

I"m not sure what I did wrong. The flavor was great but the chicken coating was mushy.  It was not very crisp like I imagined. Next time I think I will fry it in about 1 inch of oil. 30 minutes also seemed too long to bake. Maybe my strips were too small but I doubt it.

Delicious!! Just one small tweak to make this amazing: whisk in 2.5 Tbsp of sugar, and 3/4 tsp soy sauce, to the sauce (and 1 Tbsp cornstarch if you want it to be thicker).  I could drink the sauce- SO GOOD! I put the sauce in little dishes so I could dip the chicken rather than drizzling it on.  -- I also used coconut oil to brush the foil on the pan instead of olive, and coated the top of the chicken lightly with pam before putting in. I marinated about 12 hours (just FYI) and used lemon extract (1/8 tsp) in it because I can't have citrus juice. -- Add ons: I used the marinade with water to make some rice, the flavor doesn't come through much- next time I think I'll dress it up a little by adding more soy sauce and some fresh ginger.  Pineapple might also be good! - I also did steamed broccoli and steamed it with some soy sauce and sriracha in the water to give it a little flavor.

I was making coconut rice and had plenty of coconut milk left over. I stumbled on this recipe and thought I'd try it. I wasn't sure how it would turn out, but it came out absolutely amazing!! I did change a few things from the recipe instructions: As I was on a time crunch, I couldn't marinade for the 3hrs so instead I left it for 30min in the bag. I crumbed it as instructed and pan fried it (instead of the oven). Chicken was golden, with a crispy shell! It looked and smelt amazing... Now for the taste test: I had my wife taste it as she is really honest with my food (which I love) and she was in heaven. My coconut rice came out really good, but this coconut chicken came out amazing!

Quite good! I made it as written, and my very fussy kids and mildly fussy husband all liked it. The meat was a little dry, so I might cook it a little less next time. I'm also going to play around with different breading options -- ground pork rinds and parmesan cheese might be yummy.

I made this minus the lime juice because I was out. The taste of this dish is fantastic. The coating was crispy. I had an issue with it sticking on the bottom so it was only half breaded. I'll make this again. I don't know if this would work with shrimp but I really want to try it that way, too.

I made this for a Caribbean theme night.  I used sweet coconut milk instead of unsweetened, seasoned panko bread crumbs and a teaspoon of coconut rum.  For the sauce, I substituted the reduced fat mayo for plain Greek yogurt with sweet coconut milk and a tablespoon of coconut rum.
Everyone wanted the recipe!!

This was great! I used 3 cloves of garlic instead of 1, pounded whole chicken beasts (instead of strips) flat while in the marinade (inside the closed bag) but only had enough time to let it marinade for an hour, and it was still awesome.

The chicken was excellent. So crispy right from the oven. The sauce was kind of bland so I added some coconut extract and some flaked coconut to the pot and it was good. My family enjoyed this a lot.

Sorry I did not really like this. The coconut milk made the chicken go a funny texture. There wasn't really much flavour and the coconut on the outside browned quicker than the breadcrumbs. Not one for us I'm afraid.

It was tasted but overall a little too fattening for my family. And the breaking slid off of the chicken too easily when  cut to eat. I would possibly make again, but not my favorite recipe, personally.

It was just Ok. Tasted like it was missing something. I would try a variation of this some other time, but as written, not so much.
