This is a family christmas traditon in my home. The few changes I make is to add 1 (16oz can frozen limeaid) and use pink lemonade instead of regular. I still add the orange juice to it also. We always make two batches for x-mas one with Brandy for the adults and one without for the kids. It's always a hit.

This is such a delicious treat.  The green tea gives it a really refreshing flavor.  Using blackberry brandy also works really well, but it's just plain yummy any way you make it.

Incredible! This was our exclusive "holiday" drink for years, but now make a couple of double batches in the summer. Nice to have on hand. Make it in an ice bucket several days in advance of first use. Easy to take to parties. Usually use caffeine-free tea and Sierra Mist, but the cranberry lemon-lime drink is good, too. Have made it with Stevia instead of sugar, and it was good. Couldn't tell the difference. It's all good.

Delish!  I used a combo of 1/2 Cherry UV and 1/2 plain vodka.  Definitely has a kick to it!  Also used Sierra Mist Cranberry Splash for the soda.  Very red and festive for the holidays!

Just what i was looking for!  I had to alter my recipe because i realized my lemonade and oj were only 12 oz cans, so i cut down the water in order to not over-dilute the mixture.  I also ended up adding about half of the bottle of lemon-lime soda to the mix because it was a bit too strong for my taste.  This came out the perfect texture and was very pleased with it.  I only had about 1 glass left after our super bowl party, and we had a small party.  Will definately make again!

I made this for NYE and used Blackberry Brandy.  Took awhile for it to freeze, so make sure you have time to let it get hard, otherwise it was GREAT!

I had been looking for a recipe like this for these hot summer months. My parents used to make this when we went camping. I didn't have the recipe but this seems like exactly what my mother made. It appears the frozen juice concentrate has been shrunk by 25% since this recipe was posted because I can only find 12 oz cans. This actually works out great though because you can use the entire fifth of brandy and use 2 cans each of the lemonade and orange juice and increase the rest of the ingredients by 50%. Been a real hot summer so far this year and this will be batch number 3.  The fifth is actually about 4 ounces more than what would normally be used but it works out fine for me....lol

I thought this was great but quite sweet, so I used Squirt instead of Sprite. I also used locally-distilled cherry brandy, and all of my girlfriends begged me for the recipe.

Great recipe and very similar to one I use at holiday time. Modifications: 2 cups water to boil tea bags 4 min, use a mix of 2 black and 2 chai. 6 cups water boil to dissolve 1.5 c sugar. Use rest of recipe and allow to freeze overnight. The chai provides the right spice element for winter. Green or black is perfect for summer.

Served this refreshing cocktail during a warm California Thanksgiving . Rave reviews by all! I garnished each drink with fresh, frozen raspberries for a bit of color.

Really great summer cooler! Wonderful, refreshing flavor that you can hardly tell is alcoholic (and I added an extra half cup of brandy!) I could only find 12 oz frozen OJ and lemonade so I changed the servings on the recipe to 18 to get everything to the right proportions. Worked perfectly!
