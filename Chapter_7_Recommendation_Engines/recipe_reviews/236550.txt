A fun change for a sandwich. I made mine as written and added some ham slices to DH. The cheese did make a mess in the waffle iron but I was expecting that. Thanks Desiree for sharing. Served this with 'Yummy Cheese Fries' and 'Spicy Fry Sauce' from AR and a tossed salad. Not a light meal but one that we enjoyed.

Delicious and crispy sandwiches. Assembled on a cutting board and flipped over the waffle iron to make sure both sides we're compressed
