This is an interesting combination of flavors. The tarragon and citrus flavors work well together. The celery and green onions add a nice crunch. I served this salad on a bed of baby greens for a light lunch.

I used a little white onion instead of green and mostly orange zest with only a little lemon zest (what I had on hand was a single lemon, several oranges and white onion). I also accidentally doubled the tarragon. It came out good. A nice change of pace from the traditional chicken salad.
