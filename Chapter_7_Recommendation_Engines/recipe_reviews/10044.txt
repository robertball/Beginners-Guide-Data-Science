Rich and festive looking Christmas bar.  Easier than other Christmas bar recipes as it is in the one-layer, brownie type bar cookie family.  Also a nice alternative/addition to spice cookies as the primary flavor is almond with just a hint of cinnamon.

I really like the flavor of these cookies.  They are a wonderful combination of flavors of almond, butter and cinnamon.  I tried this recipe for a cookie exchange and they were a big hit.  They are also very quick and easy to make.

Used for a cookie exchange (made a lot & easy). I had my doubts while spreading out in pan. But it evened out and puffed up beautifully. Very fragrant and buttery. Got a lot of compliments and remarks on them. I will keep this recipe for next year.

The 15x10x1 pan is for the 60 serving receipe. I was surprised that this cookie turned out to be a cake!  I toasted the almonds and added to my batter, also I added the cinnamon to my batter.  I was pleased with my version of the recipe.  Also, baking time is 25-30 minutes as this is a batter.

I made this easy recipe today and it was disappointing. I agree that it has a dry, cakelike texture and not a lot of flavor. I would not make them again.

I would definitely classify this as a cake rather than a cookie recipe, but regardless, the texture was AMAZING. It was wonderfully light and fluffy, and I liked the flavor better than most cakes because it was not too sweet.

This cookie was not very good.  It was hard to spread out in the pan.  This cookie was too dry & too crumbly.  I will not be making this cookie again.

These have a good flavor.  I opted for only one color of sprinkles and they looked fine.  They are a little dry and drefinitely not a sweet cookie.  I did enjoy them with coffee.

I've made this recipe every Christmas for the past four or five years.  Everyone loves it!  They are very tasty and so easy to make!  I actually spread the dough pretty thin on a cookie sheet (doesn't quite cover the whole thing).  I'm surprised to see other people say it is a cake because I've never had that experience with this recipe.

I made it for Christmas, I used a 9x13 pan and it came out like cake. I baked it 1/2 hr. My sister loved it  and my 10yr. old doesn't want me to make it anymore.

My mom and I couldn't locate our traditional Christmas recpies, so we looked around ALLRecipes.  We found this one and changed it from bars to cookies and there was absolutely no flavor. I was disapointed and they are all still sitting on the plate, a week later. Hope others have better luck.  It sounds like it should be yummy.

I'm sorry, this cookie just wasn't good. The size pan is too large so the bars turn out thin, and the combination of red and green and chopped nuts is unappetizing. I won't be making this again.

These taste really great it is one of those things where you bite it and it tastes like christmas!  I will make this recipe again but I think the texture is better suited to being a cookie rather than a bar.  Thank you for sharing, very easy and yummy!

This is an easy and delicious cookie bar. The dough is sticky so be sure to really grease the pan or use parchment paper. Will definitely make again and use different colors for the occasion.

I’ve made these a few times now with no recipe changes in my 12x18” jellyroll pan and love them. Fresh out of the oven they are a little cake-y.  But in true cookie fashion, if they last more than 24hrs they will dry out slightly to take on a more typical cookie texture.  I recommend making them in the larger pan size so that they stay a little thinner, and using just yellow sugar crystals makes them look like they’re dusted with gold. Beautiful & delicious!

These are very easy to make and I need a few cookies like that for the holiday. I only made them once, but I plan to make them again next year. I added notes to my saved recipe for next year:

1. Add a little more cinnamon to the almonds to add flavor.
2. Be sure the almonds roast. They should be a light brown color.  Those taste better. 
3. Don't skimp on almonds.
4.. I sprinkled red sugar, then just added a little green for color. It didn't look like a mess. 
5.. Don't skimp on the sugar if you want a sweeter cookie.
