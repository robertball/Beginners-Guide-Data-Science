This is a good cookie, but there are a few issues with it.  First of all, it's not really a gingerbread cookie.  It's more of a "spice cookie."  The finished product tastes almost exactly like a recipe I long ago came across called "ice box cookies."  So if you want a gingerbread cookie, this is probably not the cookie for you.

Having said that, the dough was incredibly crumbly.  It basically formed coarse crumbs upon mixing with my hand held electric mixer.  The crumbs do come together nicely when you pack them, but if you're looking for an easy dough to work with, then this isn't it.

When all is said and done, they taste really great.  But they aren't easy to make, and they don't really taste like gingerbread, hence the rating...

My husband and kids made these tonight.  I like them better than traditional gingerbread men, which are too hard and crunchy for me.  These were soft and delicious.

This recipe for gingerbread people is excellent. The butterscotch pudding flavor really adds sweetness to the cookie. I would highly recommend this recipe for anyone looking to make gingerbread cookies with their kids!

I made these with my little one last night, but I did make a few changes. I agree with another reviewer about the dough being too crumbly, so I added about 1/3 cup unsulfered molasses at the end. They were soft, spicy and delicious!Although next time I will reduce the ginger to 2 1/2 teaspoons, it was a little much for my taste. Also I iced these guys with royal icing using meringue powder, recipe can be found at wilton.com. With my revisions I would give this recipe 5 stars.

It was very hard to work with even after refrigerating for 1 hour.  I needs more than just one egg as far as wet ingrediences go!!

I would rate this a 5 but the cookies are a tiny bit of a pain. Firstly i had encountered the same problem as many others have - dough was far too crumbly, i added about 2 tbs more of butter that solved it. Refrigerating is only an option. If you do that you'll have to completely rework the dough to get it back to ready to roll and cut. After the cookies were cut and cooked i ended up with a cookie sheet. Not individual cookies. I just recut the cookies before they cooled and left them to cool before i removed the excess and them. The excess was probably enough to have doubled the cookiemen though..... All and all taste isn't bad, i dont like full flavored gingerbread men nor their hardness so this was a great replacement. I would definitely recommend them more so if they would have stayed like a whole not a blob.

These cookie were good. I don't know as they are really gingerbread cookies, they have a more butterscotchy flavor.  But still very good :)     I did find the dough a little dry as well but after kneading it a few times it was just fine.  Also I didn't bother to chill the dough, just rolled it out immediately and cut out the cookies.

These cookies tasted great & were stiff enough to decorate, but yet soft enough to actually bite into.  We enjoyed them!
