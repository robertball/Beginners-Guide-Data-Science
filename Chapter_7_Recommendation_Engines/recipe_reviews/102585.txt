Good consistancy.  We added prawns and squash.  Very bland overall.  Wouldn't make again without changes.

I don't have a dutch oven, I actually used my cast iron skillet to make this dish. I used hickory smoke bacon in place of the prosciutto and I used a cup of frozen peas/carrots mixed because that was what I had in the freezer. I was doubtful that my husband and kids would like it but they INHALED it. There was a little under a half cup leftover after dinner. The cooking method was a little confusing and odd to me--I would make this again but I think I would try to find a simpler way to cook it.

Easy and incredibly delicious!  (I substituted sharp cheddar cheese for Parmesan because that's what I had.  It was a great, simple meal.)

I had to improvise a little because I didn't have all the ingredients.  I left out the onion, ham, wine and peas.  It was a very basic risotto, but my family liked it very much anyway.  We added tons of parmesan on top at the table and it was oozy and yummy!!  I will definitely make this again.

Pam, Just had this again for dinner. It rates a 10 in our house. I make it exactly the way you presented it in the paper last year. I go easy on the fats for the extras, just steam the veggies. We use a dutch oven, and I think that might be the key to the success of this recipe! Thank you

This was very good - I didn't think it was bland at all. To me, it was like a fancy, good version of ham and rice.  I don't know if I would call it a Risotto. I actually did not do the "baking" part. After I added the broth and water, I simply put a lid on it, brought it to a boil, and then simmered for 25 on the stovetop. It was perfect! No need to bake at all. After simmering, I continued with the recipe as usual. The parm cheese is a perfect addition! Great for leftover ham. I loved it!

Soooo good. I'd like to experiment with other veggies, like asparagus, but for a first time risotto cook, this was great. My neighbor thought I was stirring for hours and hours. Makes a nice huge batch and we had leftovers for days. I used asiago and parmesan (it was what I had in the fridge) but I will make this again and again. What an inexpensive, great meal. Kids loved it too!

this took a very long time and wasn't very flavorful.  We didn't care for it. But my kids(and husband) are pretty picky.

I made it exactly as directed and it was so simple. No problems with flavor and baking it sure frees up the hands during a dinner party. I think this would be a fun recipe to experiment with different flavors. Thanks for sharing!

We enjoyed this recipe, but I did make some changes.  I prepared it stove-top, like a regular risotto.  That was just as easy for me.  And I had some lemon grass, so I added it while it was cooking.  I love lemon grass, so I liked the flavor it gave the dish.  The only drawback with that is fishing out the grass before serving.

This was a margina risotto for me.  The risotto turned out kind of mushy and not enough flavor even though I added dried porcini mushrooms.

my go-to recipe - looks and tastes fancy but is super simple.
Try with mushrooms (browned in butter) instead of ham for a vegetarian version - yummy

Did not include the wine since I didn't have any and the recipe was still great.
