This recipe is similar  to a honey mustard chicken I have made in the past so I gave this a try. I used Boneless, skinless thighs  since it does not say what type to use. I used real maple syrup as well. The recipe was very easy to make and my husband did like the thighs (he rated this recipe a 4). The "sauce" did not thicken up during baking and was quite runny when added to the tops of the thighs.
