This is more work than it needs to be.  Simply dip the chops in seasoned egg mixture, bread with finely crushed cracker crumbs and fry in butter or margarine.  They will be crisp on the outside, yet tender and moist on the inside.  My mother has been making pork and chicken this way for 40 years.

If I hadn't added the two cups of water that the recipe called for after pan frying these, I think that we would have really liked this. There's no way that 2 cups of water is going to disolve/absorb into the chops in 20 minutes. I gave it 30 minutes and the chops went from nice and crisp to soggy...and dry on the inside. If I made these again I think I'd take the chops out of the pan after cooking, make the gravy and then maybe put the chops in the gravy to finish cooking. Or, just cook them through in the beginning and top them with the gravy on the dinner plate.

Capt N these are my mom's exact pork chops.  I loved these things growing up.  I was so glad to see them on here...I always deep fry.  Not the healthiest, but they always turn out great.  Thanks for posting.

I tried the pan fried version of this recipe.  Following the recipe exactly only led to the breading getting all soggy and falling off the chop during cooking.  Will I try this recipe again.  Never

Okay so I didn't have Saltines but I did have Captain Crunch cereal. Unbelievable! I can't believe how the sweetness of the cereal flavors the pork perfectly. Mangia bene!

Tasted ok but I had to add rub to give it flavor. Next time, I won't drag the chops twice through the crackers. Make sure you get those crackers to CRUMB size in order to cook the chops properly. I, like most others who tried this recipe, did not use 2 cups h2o. Used 1/4 cup with dissolved chicken bullion cube and taste was great. Idea was good, but directions need fine tuning. Thanks for the recipe- I would do it again with the adjustments made!!!

YUM!! This was very good. I did pan fry the pork chops and added garlic salt, season salt, and some chicken buillon powder to the cracker mix. Then when I removed them from skillet I put pepper and garlic salt on them. They were crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. YUMMY!!!

I would just like to comment and say you are really putting an effort into it.We usually take the pork chops and dip in eggs then cracker crumbs then fry them.Ofcourse we like making gravy also from it.I usually eliminate the salt and use garlic salt.It gives it a better taste.I fixed my cracker pork chops for my mother who was skeptical and some friends and they loved them.They still rave over it but it was simple to make.Also sautee some onions and add to the gravy also does great.

Good recipe.  Nice alternative to fried pork chops made with bread crumbs.  I didn't bother to make the sauce.

I made this for dinner tonight, and it was great.  I used ritz crackers and added pepper and garlic powder to the crumbs.  I had thin-sliced chops, dipped them in egg, cracker mix, back in the egg, and in the cracker mix a second time.  Then I pan-fried them and drained them on paper towels.  They were a big hit with my kids, even my two year old who refuses to eat any meat other than chicken nuggets!  The pork chops were very crisp on the outside, nice and juicy on the inside.  I skipped the sauce-making step because it didn't sound too appetizing to me, but will make pork chops this way again for sure.

These were so fast to make.. Loved that it was so easy as I hate to cook. They were nice and moist. I did not add the water and stuff at the end of frying as I wanted them crispy. Definitely should have spiced it before I fried it. Great recipe though. Thanks.

I really liked the recipe. I see most felt the first step of coating the meat in crumbs was useless but it actually makes a glue for the crumbs to stick to so you get an even coating that will not blow off while frying.  only i used flour on the first coating then egg then club cracker crumbs.  the deglazing process makes a nice sauce if you add a tsp of butter.
my husband really liked it for a change of pace. thanks

These were really good but I did make a few changes. I used egg for dipping in place of milk, added a tsp. of pork rub seasoning to the cracker crumb coating, I then fried them about 4 to 5 minutes on each side and eliminated the water and boullion step as I wanted them crispy. They were excellent.

These were delicious!  After the 20 minutes cooking, I put them in the oven for 15 minutes to "crisp" them up a little.  They were very yummy!

Just ok.  I thought they were kind of bland even though I added garlic and pepper to the crackers.  Next time I would cook the pork chops plain and then coat and fry them.  I don't like the water stage, found it made the crackers crispy on the outside but soggy on the inside.

I added the ckn bouillon to the crackers & added a little lime juice to the egg.  Then I skipped the water at the end & instead put the chops in a warm oven to finish them off.  My family loved it so much that there weren't any leftovers!

GRRRR!!! It took me FOREVER to find the icon for rating/leaving a comment! Sheesh!
Anyway...
These chops were AMAZING!! Yum!!! 
I was looking for a different way to make them because we're getting kinda sick of the same old baked chops. I saw this recipe and couldn't wait to try it!!  I did alter it just a bit. I added some seasoned bread crumbs to the cracker crumbs for flavor and I skipped the water step & just deep fried them.  FANTASTIC!!!! My picky hubby ate THREE of them!! lol  I will definitely be making these again!!

This recipe is so good! We have made it again and again. I skip the last step and just simply deep fry them. The only thing I did was season the chops with pepper and salt before the crackers and I added garlic powder to the cracker mix just to give it more flavor. Great with mashed potatos and gravy :) Yummmm!! Thanks for a wonderful recipe :)

Yummy! Yummy! I made these and they were super easy and fast. I didn't add the water and chicken bouillon because I wanted them crispy! Just make sure you season the pork chops! Thanks for a great and cheap recipe. I am going to make them tonight with pork cube steak to make it a super cheap meal!

Oh my goodness! I was kind of "ifs" about saltine crackers as the breading/coating...but oh my goodness! It turned out very delicious!  I thought my son would never stop eating dinner last night... Thank you for sharing this wonderful but yet simple recipe...

Wow, I can't wait to make this again!  The pork chops were crunchy on the outside and so tender on the inside.  It's so simple to make.  I skipped the water part and just pan friend them.  I used seasoned salt, Spike and Italian seasoning in the cracker mixture.  I can't wait to try this on chicken.

I found the water part of this recipe worth skipping next time. They became soggy and most of the breading came off. I will also use suggestions from other reviews to add spices to cracker crumbs.  They were very bland otherwise.

To my surprise, these indeed were very good chops! My family thought it was chicken! I added some all-season salt & garlic powder to the cracker mix, used 2 chicken bullion cubes and used less water (1 1/2 cups...maybe even less next time b/c cooking time did exceed the 20 minutes the recipe calls for). Tasty new way to eat pork...will make this again. Thanks Capt-n for the recipe and good luck in your truck stop venture!

I was looking for something different.  My husband is a truck driver, so when I seen that Capt-N wanted to start a truck stop I had to try it.  My husband loved them, and so did I.  They were very good, and I will be making them again. My husband wants me to make a much larger batch so he can take them to work with him and share with the other drivers. I think I just might!

it will also work if you don't add water just put a lid over your skillet and let them steam. If that is the way you like your chops!

Adding the water they went from nice and crispy to soggy and the coating falling off. Could also use some more seasonings.

Everything was going great until I added the 2 cups of water to the skillet. I knew it wouldn't absorb all that water, and it didn't. The chops were nice and brown and crispy after frying, then turned all soggy in the water. Most of the nice coating came off in wet slabs. My family politely ate it and didn't complain, but I will never serve this dish again.

These were the best pork chops I've ever made. My husband loved them!

Today they were epic failure. Not sure why you would use so much oil and I have no idea why you would fry something to make it crispy then put it in water and make it all soggy? What did I miss? Ugh!

These were great. I didn't make the gravy because I didn't want my pork shops to be soggy, so I just fried them instead. They have the best taste.

For goodness sakes DON'T Add the water, if you want gravy take up the chops and the chunky stuff left in the pan make your gravy then add the chunky stuff back in right before serving your gravy. it a nice favor burst in your gravy. grandma taught me right!

This was great but used Ritz crackers instead of saltine crackers and kept them warm until time to eat and added the gravy on top then. Thumbs up with this one. Thanks, dhadler  Hope this was helpfull.

I'm not a fan of frying, but I am glad I tried this one. I ran out of crackers so I used crushed rice krispy cereal it gave it a nice flavor. I skipped the water and bouillon part. I made 8 chops for 4 of us and all were gone by the end of the night. I will keep this one in my recipe box for sure.

Wonderful meal! I didn't use bouillon (didn't have any), didn't use water and used Stoned Wheat Things for the crackers. Also pan fryed them, using just the olive oil. Will definitely make again, this meal was a hit. And I recommend just going straight for dipping the chops in the egg, then rolling them in the crackers. Thanks for the recipe!

These were truly delicious!  I only added 1/2 cup of water, and made a cream sauce with rosemary and artichokes to go with it.  It's our new favorite way to cook chops.

My husband doesn't like most pork chop recipes because they are dry, but he loved this one.  I used beef bouillion cubes since that's all I had and tried some with crackers only and some with flour and crackers and they both came out yummy.  Hope you get your truck stop capt-n.

My family and I really enjoyed this recipe, I will be making it again for sure!!  I didn't have enough crackers so what I did was I dunked the pork chops in flour (seasoned with garlic salt and pepper) first then I dipped it in the egg, then I coated it with the crackers. This may affect the crunchiness but the one I made was nice and crunchy too. It was awesome..  I did not do the water and stock part.  Thanks Cap.

These pork chops were delicious and easy to make.  I skipped the water stage alltogether, and simply fried the chops.  Then I sprinkled them with a little salt and pepper. I also used very thin cut chops. They were moist and tender with a crispy cracker coating.  All of my friends loved them!

the taste was fine, but I don't like how soggy the outside got. The water made all of the crispy crackers mushy and they fell off. next time I will stop after frying the chops in the cracker mixture.

First time I fried pork chops with a coating. Turned out very good. I just fried, no water added to skillet. I followed recipe other than I did season after the water with thyme, sage, garlic & black pepper to taste. Very tasty, tender & moist. Also I used boneless pork chops's less than 1/2" thick.

This was fantastic but I should say I made a couple changes. I rinsed and patted dry the pork chops. Then I seasoned both sides with salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder. The crackers I uses were keebler club crackers. Pan fried the chops in oil til browned on both sides and then popped in the oven to finish at 350 degrees.  Perfect. Juicy and delicious with awesome flavor. Fiance and daughter agreed it's a keeper

I agree that the recipe calls for too much water and it makes the bottom of the chops soggy (that were previously nicely browned).  I would use less water, or take the chops out of the pan after frying them and top it with the sauce when serving.  I added some seasoning mix and garlic because it needed a bit more flavor.  I would make it again with a few tweaks, my family liked it overall. I served it with quinoa & broccoli.

Skip the part about adding water! It turns the crumbs into a soggy mess, which also killed the flavor. I'm sure it would have a better taste if it were deep fried.

All the chicken broth it did was ruin the crispy cracker crust. Also they need some seasoning in the crumbs.

Yum!! I fry panned it... so i omitted the water and bouillion cube (that i didn't have)... And I used tollhouse crackers, that were a garlic herb that i had gotten on sale rather than saltine crackers...oh so good! I also omitted the cayenne, I was worried be too spicy on top of the paprika. Delcious! I 100% recommend double dipping in the crumbs though. Thanks for the share!!

Omg! I added a splash of bread crumbs...and pan fried in Olive oil only on like 250... For about 20 min each side... Then when brown...fired it up and made crispy... Never added the cube... Just salt, pepper and garlic powder in the eggs... Rolled in the crackers and little bot of bread crumbs. Best I've ever had! EVER!

Tried this tonight, it was so easy to make. The only thing, I needed more crackers than 1/2 the package. They were so delicious!!!! Excellent recipe.

So my wife's injured and can't cook, so I've been doing most of the cooking the last few days. I decided to try this recipe. I didn't do the bullion or the water, just fried them and they turned out pretty good! I seasoned the pork chops before I battered them with the crackers. We live in Louisiana so we season a lot more! Lol. It gives a texture that bread crumbs can't give, but it needs a little more seasoning.

Dissapointed :(  .... Had they been done without the water they would have been amazing. But, after putting them in water the coating got soggy and fell off.

This was a lot of mess (I hate dipping and then frying in batches) but my family absolutely loved this.  It was good.  I did the fry (dry) method and also seasoned the saltines.  It was a huge hit!

These pork chops were a hit with my whole family.  They were a welcomed change form our traditional bread crumbs.  I didn't do the water part and they still came out fantastic.  I rubbed thm with some garlic, salt and pepper prior to coating. I also used Ritz because I didn't have any saltines.  They were moist, buttery, and surely a make-again!!  Thank you!

These were OK, my fiance liked them. I cooked them in the deep fryer and they were pretty juicy. Next time I will probably pan fry them to see if they are any better.

These pork chops were very tasty.  I didn't make the gravy, because no one in my family cares for it.  I will definitely make these again.

EASY!!!! My daughters actually ate their entire serving! The pork chops were so moist and the taste was so unique! And did I mention that it was EASY to make?

Superb!  We choose the frying only method -- leaves a great coating and tender chops.  I like to serve it with mashed red potatoes and bacon and onion green beans.  Healthy?  Maybe not, but there are NEVER leftovers!!!

I fried these, and they turned out wonderful.  This is how I will be preparing pork chops from now on.
