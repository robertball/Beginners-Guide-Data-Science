9.2.18  This is the same recipe as another low-carb Instant Pot® cheesecake  recipe on this site, with the exception that this has the addition of the zest of one lemon, which is the one thing that I wasn't wild about.  Garnished with chopped pecans and a caramel sauce.  This was O.K., but I think I’ll stick with the other recipe which I’ve also made for now.

If you are desperate for cheesecake and don't want to wait, this is a decent substitute for baking one.  Although the  texture does come out different, it does taste like cheesecake!

I won't make this again.  It turned out the consistency of tofu and did not taste good.  My husband, who will eat just about anything, tried topping it with all sorts of things to make it edible and nothing helped.
