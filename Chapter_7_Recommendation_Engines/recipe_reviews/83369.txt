We made this tonight and it was super yummy. Next time we make it, we'll probably use more vegetables, but its a keeper for sure.

This was the first time I had used seitan and only had an 8 oz package, so I added mushrooms, broccoli, baby carrots, and water chestnuts. I also served with a organic brown and wild rice mix, flavored with tamari sauce. My husband and 19 yr old son loved it (altho neither knew it was vegetarian instead of chicken!) I will definitely make regularly now.

Very delicious. Our store didn't have Seitan, so I used frozen Veggie Chicken Strips and it was delicious. I made it for dinner with my parents (not vegan) and the loved it. Even my super meat eater father went for seconds! Wouldn't change a thing with this recipe!

This was really good, my boyfriend (who has been known to scoff at my attepmts to "vegetarianize" meals) ate two servings!  The only complaint was that it was a little too sweet, so next time I may cut down on the brown sugar a little bit.

Quite tasty. Both my bf and I loved it.
Did not turn out the same color as the one in the photo though, ours was brown.

A great find. Will be making this again and again. I use fructose instead of brown sugar.

This was good. The sauce tasted great. I used a canned seitan which I didn't really care for but that doesn't reflect on the quality of the recipe. I also added extra vegetables. Yummy. Will make this again.

Wow! This was amazing. Made everything exactly as directed - except I used Morningstar chicken strips since I don't have a clue how to find seitan out here! We served it over rice - though next time I may try to add some more veggies. But this was definitely great, my non-vegetarian husband gave me the ok to make it again (which is rare!)

This was the first time my husband and I have ever had seitan (wish I knew how to pronouce it).  We really like the flavor of this sweet and sour souce.  We added a lot more vegis than what the recipie indicated.  Joel likes seitan - better than tofu, but not as well as chicken (of course).  We will eat this again.  Thanks!

I made this dish for my husband and his ultra picky vegetarian father.. it came out amazing! I sauteed the seitan until brown,added in all the vegies including baby corn, chunks of yellow and red peppers ... and the sauce was so delicious over whole wheat linguini... I would definitely make this dish again!

Very yummy! I am putting this on the rotation! I think the brown sugar and what kind of vegetables are included really make the dish. Thank you for a yummy seitan recipe!!

My 4 year old gobbled this up! I swapped out the canned pineapple and juice for 2 cups fresh pineapple and used a cup of apple cider. I will definitely make this again.

Maybe I just thought I liked sweet and sour dishes, because I didn't care for this at all.

This is a great and easy recipe that I made even better by adding a few extra ingredients.  I added sugar snap peas, half a can of mini corn that you often find in Asian cooking, and a handful of tiny grape-tomatoes.  My husband, who is a new vegetarian, licked his plate!

I'm not a fan of the chunks of pineapple, but overall it was very good! I will make this again.

This is a quick easy dish that is sure to meet the whole families approval.  I use an electric wok, throw in any extra vegetables I have in the fridge, add the seitan then the cider vinegar, soy, pineapple juice, brown sugar and corn starch all at once.  5 minutes of stirring and it is ready to be devoured.  We love it over sticky rice!

This recipe tastes amazing!  I am not sure why, my sweet-and-sour sauce was watery (I think I used too much pineapple juice).  I had to add more corn starch and drain some of the liquid, even after I added the extra corn starch.  I think it is really necessary to brown the seitan (or tofu, which is just as good to use with this recipe).  If the seitan or tofu is a bit crispy, it will make all the difference for the better.  Note to self:  the whole can of pineapple chunks is not necessary for this recipe.  Half the can would have sufficed.

Cooked this tonight and it was really good! Super simple and fast to make and I had most of the ingredients already.  Few tweaks I did: I only had a 10oz can of seitan tidbits (you can find at a Natural Foods store or asian market) so I added 6oz of baby bella mushrooms.  Also, I had to add more brown sugar because it was too vinegary as stated in the recipe.  I also added about a tsp more cornstarch to make thicker. I also added about 1/4 cup of ketchup to make it like they do in the takeout restaurants (why you usually see this recipe with a red sauce).  Thank you for the recipe!!! Delicious with white rice

We loved this dish.  We didn't have canned pineapples so we used mixed tropical fruits in a can.  It was amazing over rice.
