I always love an excuse to use saffron, and this delicious rice was a great use for it. Easy to make, too, exactly as described.

Wonderful, tasty rice recipe and a great way to use up a pomegranate (we have a tree). The only change I made was to use homemade chicken broth because we had some on hand. Will definitely make this rice again and again!
