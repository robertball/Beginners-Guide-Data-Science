I used this dressing as a marinade and marinated the chicken breasts for 3 hours then grilled them. They were phenomenal. My husband couldn't stop saying mmmm!

Tasty refreshing salad,Jill! Everyone loved the dressing, especially. I added spinach and baby mixed greens to the romaine. Yum. Thanks for sharing.

This was a very yummy dish!! I forgot about the orange juice though and substituted the drained manadarin juice with about 2-3 TBS of lemon juice instead of the regular orange juice and it turned out just great!! Thanks Jill!!

This was very good, and I even forgot to put in the mandarin oranges! (I kept eating it, thinking "Did I miss something? Well it still tastes good, but still...") My only complaint is that I didn't cook up enough chicken! Instead of a garlic and herb seasoning blend, I just used garlic powder and what I had in the cabinet that I thought would go well, and it still turned out fine!

The only thing I would change would be to cut down on the garlic herb seasoning as it was a bit overpowering.  I'd cut it in half.  It was also a bit gritty so I think adjusting the seasoning would fix this.  Other than that, it was great.

Very flavorful and easy vinegarette dressing. I added green onions to the salad for extra taste. This recipe will be used often in our household.

This was great. I had to change a few things just because I didn't have everything I needed. I did not have white wine vinegar on hand so I used a little bit of white vinegar with a little white cooking wine. I also did not gave the garlic and herb seasoning so I used some garlic salt and Italian seasoning. We couldn't grill because it was raining like mad outside so I cooked them in a pan putting half of the sauce mixture in and when I flipped the chicken I poured the rest of the mixture in. It turned out great! We served it with a side of pasta. I will be doing this again soon!

My husband is a very picky eater, 'oranges and chicken', you know that look, but he liked it, he liked it.  Maybe I should change his name to Mikey.

I doubled the recipe and used half as a marinade for the chicken and half as dressing.  I think making the dressing a few hours in advance helped dissolve the spices of the garlic-herb blend.  Everyone loved it.  Will be made again.

I doubled the recipe and used half for marinade, half for dressing as suggesed by others. I also cut my chicken into strips beforehand and marinated for 30 minutes. Although having several pieces on the grill was a little more work, the chicken was very moist/tender and each piece was delicious. As for the marinade being used as dressing... i would have prefered it a little thicker, maybe next time I'll add a little mustard or more oil. I did add some fresh herbs (basil, lemon verbena) the flavor was very bright. Perfect for a summer dinner salad.

I usually skip the chicken making part and use just the dressing making part of the recipe. I made the dressing to take to a potluck and everyone loved it! I usually lessen the amount of vinegar as I do not like the taste of it; I put in just enough to give it a little tart. I also put in a little less of the garlic seasoning (I use Ms. Dash) as it can overwhelm the orange flavor.

I liked it. I seasoned the chicken w/ S & P and garlic powder before cooking, and only added a tsp. or so to the dressing. I used fresh spinach instead of lettuce. I will make this again.

Jill was correct. This was a very refreshing treat on a warm Fourth of July.  Easy and quick to prepare and nice to serve to company.  My youngest granddaughter really liked the mandarin oranges.

the dressing was really good. Perfect for the salad. I had to broil the chicken instead of on the grill. Wish i would have done it on the grill.

This recipe was excellent.  The only modification that I did was use 2 pounds of chicken - 4 breasts, since my fiance thinks salad isn't a meal unless it has a lot of chicken.  Everybody loved this recipe.  Nobody complained about gritiness of the dressing.  I used Mrs. Dashes original blend for the garlic herb seasoning.  Next time I will add another can of oranges.

I really liked this salad, it was a nice change from lettuce, tomatoes and ranch dressing. I will make this again. My husband liked it also which I wasn't sure if he would like these veggies in a salad or even oranges but never complained.

This was great!  I made it for my diabetic neighbor's birthday on a hot day when a cool salad was perfect.   I made 1 and 1/2 times the dressing to marinate the chicken as suggested by someone else.  I used chicken tenders and just sauteed them in a non-stick pan.  I did add a bit of orange rind and salt to the dressing. (the dressing is very garlicky- if you don't like garlic, try another herb blend maybe)  I shredded bigger carrots, also added cucumber slices and sliced, toasted almonds to the salad.  I would maybe add red bell pepper next time too.  It was a huge hit and everyone loved it!  Thank you for a great salad.

I thought the vinegar was to over powering, maybe cut down vinegar in 1/2 would help. I do not think I will try this one again.

Great Salad!  I marinated the chicken like one other reviewer and my husband absolutely LOVED this recipe.  Normally if we try something new he will say its okay to make again but this time he said it tasted, "GREAT"  The chicken was so moist from marinating it and very flavorful.  I also thought if you wanted you could add gorgonzola cheese just for additional calcium.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!!!

Followed the recipe exactly.  Great, fresh flavor.  I don't have an outdoor grill, so I used my Cuisinart indoor grill/griddler - perfect and good for you too!  Thanks for the recipe!

The dressing for this smelled amazing.  I used the 1/2 cup to cook the chicken in, since we don't have a grill.  The chicken was the best part of the entire recipe.  When it was all put together, it tasted a lot like an asian-type of salad, but without any sort of tang to it.  It definitely needed something extra in it, maybe soy sauce, but there just wasn't any zing to it.  It wasn't bad, but I won't be making it again.

Great Taste!  Really enjoyed the salad, but took a little time to get use to the grittness from the sugar and seasonings.  My whole family like it it is going into my recipe binder.

It was okay, but not nearly as "orangy" as I expected.  The broccoli over powered everything else and the dressing was more "vinegary" tasting rather than orange.  Not bad, but I'm not going to make it again.

Very fresh lively salad.  The dressing is wonderful and I loved the mandarin oranges.  I did add toasted slivered almonds because I felt something was missing. I put diced red pepper in it.  Wonderful summer dinner!

It was okay - I found it very peppery, which I think came from my bottle of salt-free garlic and herb  seasoning blend. I'd probably try it again with half as much seasoning blend.  Otherwise good.

Delicious. I used snow peas, Italian seasoning instead of garlic, and added green onions. It didn't taste as much like orange as I thought it would. The mandarin oranges were the kicker for that flavor. So yummy! These servings were the main meal for my husband and I and he cleared his plate while I had some left on mine. So no, it doesn't serve 4 unless you have a side dish.

I marinated my chicken for 4.5 hours. I basted them constantly during the cooking process and they were still extremely bland. I liked the flavor of the marinade, but it would have been better as a dipping sauce instead of a marinade.

It was okay, but it wasn't what I was looking for.

The chicken was wonderful . tender and moist.  Very flavourful.  My husband had trouble chewing broccoli and raw carrots.  I replaced the broccoli with fennel as that wa what I had on hand.  I liked it but I think a good garden salad with mandarins or oranges would have been just as good or better.   I will be making this again, maybe serving the chicken on a bed of rice and letus.

I would have added more chicken and less seasoning in the dressing. But beside that I would recommend you making it.

I like the freshness of the salad, but it does need some work.  
A few changes I made: I added ginger & garlic to the dressing and marinated the chicken in it. I omitted the broccoli and oranges.  Instead I added mango, avocado & cucumbers.  I think this could really go for a good arugula mix and maybe a little more tweaking, but overall a good base!
