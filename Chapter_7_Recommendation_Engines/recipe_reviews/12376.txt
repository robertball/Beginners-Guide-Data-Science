I had never made any meringue pie before and found this one easy and very delicious.  My boyfriend actually said he'd have to quite eating the lemon meringue pie because it doesn't compare to the orange!

I thought it was fantastic! I substituted the orange juice to 1 orange popsicle and the corn starch to flour and it turned out magnificent!

I wasn't satisfied with how the pie turned out.  The zest made it bitter (yes, I know not to use the white part) and gave it more texture than I care for.  2 egg whites made for a very skimpy topping also.

This recipe was definitely very easy to make, but I found that it was rather skimpy on the meringue topping as well as the filling.  The filling was a bit runny, even though I followed the recipe perfectly.  It tasted good though, and everyone seemed to like it, but I have to admit that it was a bit disappointing.

Although I had issues with this recipe solidifying, my husband and I loved the flavor and texture.  I think I may have over cooked the starch mixture.  Need to really watch this.

Tastes like a lemon pie. Thought it would have a stronger orange flavor.

Easy to make. I recommend having your ingredients all ready to go when you start. It makes it so much easier in the long run. My kid and I had a blast making this together. Easy for her to help with and you don't need a ton of baking experience to get it right.

Cook the filling just a little longer and it'll thicken up nicely...double the recipe to make enough pie filling and meringue then you're good to go!
