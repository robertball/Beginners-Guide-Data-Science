good, but next time i will be doubling the cream cheese filling and using two cans of fruit.  one wasn't enough to get good coverage for the whole pan.

Baked for time specified and it was gooey in the middle.  Baked longer, but didn't help.  It tasted more like apple crisp with a little chocolate flavor.  Expected more of the cream cheese flavor to come through.
