I have made this recipe a couple of times and everyone has loved it!!! A couple of things I noticed is that I could only fit about 9 slices of bread in the pan before it started overflowing and it took 1 1/2 hours for mine to cook. I think next time I make it I will only use one can of apple pie filling and then I will be able to add more bread. Also make sure you spray the foil or it will stick.

This recipe was amazing.  I chose it because, unlike many of the other "make ahead" french toast recipes, it truly was 100% ready to go in the morning.  Just pop it in the oven.  When I made it I used one can of apples, and made sure it was apples and water only--no high fructose corn syrup--to keep the recipe from being over-the-top sweet.  The apples turned out so delicious, next time I probably will use two cans.  I used Pepperidge Farm cinnamon raisin bread, and baked for 90 minutes.  Everything else I kept exactly the same.  I used a cake pan and had no problems with it boiling over.  I didn't turn it upside down, and I thought it made a very nice presentation "as is" with the cinnamon swirl bread.  The bread wasn't incredibly crispy, as pan fried French toast can be, but it certainly wasn't gooey either.  I think using a slightly more substantial bread, like Italian or the cinnamon swirl, instead of white or French, makes a big difference.  I made it for a brunch for 11 people, and everyone absolutely raved about it. It was so incredibly simple--15 minutes the night before and you're done.  This will definitely become a staple in my house.  Thanks for a real keeper!  Note:  I made this again and didn't bake it as long.  Yuck!  Make sure you bake it long enough.

I have made this a fewtimes and everyone just loves it! Instead of the canned pie filling, I used fresh apples (3-6), peeled and thinly sliced. I tossed those with 1/2 cup melted butter (3/4 cup leaves a soppy, greasy mess at the bottom), 3/4 cup brown sugar, and 2-3 teaspoons cinnamon. I have always been able to fit eighteen slices of bread in my 9x13 pans (three layers of six). This bakes up perfectly in 70-75 minutes. Spraying the tin foil is an absolute MUST or it will stick. This recipe will be around our house for a long, long time. It's absolutely perfect!

The flavor of this french toast is really great, but you really need to make sure this is cooked completely through!  At 60 minutes, mine looked done, but was still very wet at the bottom of the bread layer.  We had to do a little improvising under the broiler, but all reviews were still very positive!  This is a keeper for sure... longer cook time and maybe a little less milk.  Yummy!

This was very easy to make and very good!  My husband loved it. I cut the recipe in half and baked it in a 8x8 pan.  Based on advise from others, I replaced 1/2 the milk with cream and cooked it for the full 75 minutes - it came out perfect and wasn't soggy at all.  To perfect this recipe, all I'd do is use just a little less brown sugar and syrup, so it's not quite as sweet.  Other than that, this recipe couldn't be any better!

HUGE hit with my husband and everyone at the office.  Instead of usung canned apple pie filling, I sauteed my own in a little butter and maple syrup. This made it *perfect*!!!!

Mmmm great recipe!  The only reason it did not receive 5 stars is because we did find it a little sweet for breakfast.  I will definitely make this dish again for brunch, but I think next time I will use McIntosh apples instead of apple pie filling, I think the brown sugar gives it enough sweetness.  I also want to mention that I cut this recipe in half and it turned out great!

Super easy, turns out great! A couple of suggestions... I've made this twice now, and it's been a hit both times!!! First time I made a 9x13 and could only fit 18 slices of bread, 2nd time I cut the recipe in half and used an 8x8 and fit about 10 pieces of bread. When it says to "press down", press down with some force, not  patting the bread. The first time I made it, I used the canned apple pie filling and it was good, but too sweet (and i LOVE sweet stuff). The 2nd time I peeled and sliced apples, put them in raw, and it turned out awesome! Both times I baked mine no less than an 1hr and20min.  I put a cookie sheet lined with tin foil under it to avoid bubbling over. I made sure to spread the egg mixture evenly over the bread w/ spatula, almost rubbing it in.  Spraying the tinfoil so it doesn't stick to the bread is helpful.  Also, I didn't invert it either time and it presented great and didn't seem to make a difference. People will be asking for the recipe guaranteed!

I just made this for Christmas brunch this morning and it was a hit! I kept it in the oven a little longer to make sure the bread was cooked all the way through! I already passed it along to my family members. Nothing but yummy!

This was a very good recipe. It was very simple to put together and bake. It was a little to sweet for my taste buds but my kids loved it. I thought it should be a little crispier too but my oven could have played a part in that. Thank you

Although I like traditional French Toast better, this was good and festive for a 
brunch I had.  My kids (both young and old) really liked it.  I used thick cut Texas style bread, so not as many slices used.  I also cut back on the sugar.  It was good reheated with vanilla ice cream on top!

This was a delicious breakfast treat!  Based on some other review comments, I made a couple changes to the recipe and got rave reviews when I brought it to a post-prom teen breakfast.  

Important:  Be sure to grease the aluminum foil you use to cover the casserole when baking or it sticks to the top layer.  I didn't remember to do that - not a huge deal though, because you flip it over to serve, so the torn part is hidden on the bottom of the dish.

Changes:  I used fresh Fuji apples (I think I used 3 large ones) peeled, cored, and sliced very thinly instead of canned apples because I wanted no additional sweetness to the brown sugar and maple syrup called for in the recipe.  I also used Pepperidge Farm's Cinnamon Swirl bread for the bread ingredient - very yummy!

The finished product was not at all mushy.

This turned out great.  The first time I made it I cut back on the sugar and used the applepie filling...it was great.  The second time I made it I still cut back on the amount of sugar but I used splenda.  I also made my own apples with fresh apples, a little brown suagar, butter ans mostly splenda.  I cooked them in a pan until tender and substituted thenm for the apple pie filling.  Very tasty and healthier.

This was VERY very good.  A nice Sunday brunch meal.  I used only 2/3 of the required brown sugar, and still found it pretty sweet.  I can't wait to try this with Challah bread (white bread doesnt really cut it for me).  I think I will definately try Rose Cook's suggestion about the peach and blueberry filling.

Made this recipe for Christmas morning and it was a big hit.  Everyone enjoyed it then and also in the following couple of days - very good reheated.  Both children and adults enjoyed it.  Really press the bread down into the apple pie filling, making sure that everything is nice and tight. This makes it much easier come serving time.

This was delicious!!  All I got was raves.  I changed the servings to 18 - used a 11X15 dish.  I did not increase the brown sugar, in fact, I barely put in 1 cup.  Also, I kept the apples at 2 cans.  This was not too sweet.  I think one of the secrets to this recipe is to make sure it is cooked long enough.  I put it in for 75 minutes, covered.  Came out moist, not soggy.  I'll do this one again.

I made this for a church breakfast - YUM. This is a keeper. Per a previous review, I did add some chopped pecans on top on the apples before pressing the bread down (by the way, I could only fit 18 slices -- 3 rows of six slices), and I added some chopped pecans on top. I was worried about inverting the pan - but it was a breeze.

This was good but the bread was quite soggy. It was more like bread pudding than French toast. I probably won't make it again.

First, I didn't have apple pie filling, so I used tart thinly sliced apples (turned out to be the best part).  I personally liked this recipe, but my "wannabe food critic" husband thought it tasted uncooked (it was thoroughly done).  He didn't like the mushiness of the bread, but did think it tasted good.  Of course, he doesn't like his regular french toast to be "creamy" in the middle either.  Go figure.

I have prepared this according to a few other's suggestions.  I have used 1 1/2 loafs of peppridge farm cinnamon swirl bread torn into pieces, with 1 can of apple pie filling.  That was my only modification of this recipe and followed all directions otherwise accordingly.  It was very easy to make.  Tearing bread seemed to allow the egg mixture to soak well as it appeared just a little moist/wet before I covered it overnight.  I baked 1 hr, and then tried the broiler suggesting but my syrup didn't carmelize (probably because I used sugar free, didn't matter, everyone still loved it)  Also, when serving, I did not flip the dish over, everyone scooped from the 9x13 pampered chef stone I baked/served it in.  I am being asked to bring to future Easter brunches as everyone loved it.  Thanks for the recipe!  It's a keeper!

I thought this was amazing and delicious - the kids didn't like it as much, but you can't win them all.  I used homemade chunky applesauce instead of the apple pie filling.  I don't think I'd use the canned filling only because it's so sweet and homemade applesauce is so easy to whip up - great recipe though!  Thanks!

The idea is delicious. When I make it, I cut up fresh apples and layer them over the butter/cinnamon mixture. I also leave out the syrup at the end. My whole family loves it.

Delicious!  With a bit of alteration on my part. I used 4  big Granny Smith apples. Peeled and sliced thin put in a saute pan with 1/2 c. brown sugar,1 c water and saute covered, stirring when necessary. When apples are done, add 1 tsp cornstarch that's been mixed with a little water to the apple mixture.  Cook until thickened like an apple pie would be. Had to used 21 slices of bread instead of 20 also. It was a big hit at Sunday morning golf!  Some women said "very rich--but delicious" while some of the men said, " I'll have another piece and I can't eat another bite I'm so full!"

I didn't have canned pie filling, so sauteed some sliced apples in a bit of maple syrup & butter... I used raisin bread & added some chunks of cream cheese in one layer.  Rave reviews!

This was so good!  I followed another reviewer's advice and used a loaf of Pepperidge Farm Cinnamon raisin bread instead of the plain bread.  Since this bread was slightly sweet, I did not add the maple syrup at the broiling stage, and we found it to be plenty sweet.  Everyone loved it, and we will have it again!  Thanks for the idea, Caljake!

This recipe is a winner. Easy to make and everyone loves it. I usually make it for work and its great for a large crowd. So nice to make ahead the night before and cook in the morning. And its not very expensive for how many servings it has. In fact making it tonight for our xmas party tomorrow. I will pair it with some creamy potatoe ham casserole & its a complete breakfast for a big crowd. Its fail proof.  try it

This recipe is delicious! I didn't have time to make it the night before, so instead of pouring the egg mixture over the bread, I dipped each piece of bread in egg before layering it over the apples, and then poured the remaining egg mixture on top. I should have used a deeper dish, though, as it did bubble over; nonetheless, even my husband, who doesn't care for french toast, ate this up. So good....

We did encounter the same cooking problems as everyone else, but had to give it 5 stars for its deliciousness!  We baked it for the entire 75 minutes and it was a little soggy in the middle.  Next time we will bake it for 90 minutes.  We didn't want it too sweet so subsituted one freshly sliced, tart apple for the apple pie filling and it was awesome.  This is a new family favorite!

Excellent Recipe! A little too sweet for our liking, but would make again and cut back on the sugar/syrup as well as only using one can of apple pie filling and combining that with fresh cut apples. Definitely use a deep 9x13 pan or lasagna dish!

Summary: a very good special occasion breakfast but makes too much for one pan.

I brought this to a breakfast casserole potluck and it was super popular, many people asked for the recipe. It was nice to have the variation with so many egg casseroles brought. 

I reduced both the bread and pie filling but my pan still overflowed all over my oven. Next time I will use one can of pie filling. With the bread, I will cover the pan once with slices, spread some egg,  cover the pan with another layer of bread, then egg and then be done. This should take less than one loaf of bread, I think. Oh, also, I left out the milk entirely and will probably do that again.

And I will put a jelly roll pan on a lower rack in the oven, just in case it spills over again.

It took  longer to cook because I had too much in the pan. I think 1 can of apple pie filling would have been enough.

Brought this to work and ended up printing out copies for many. It's a big crowd pleaser. I've done a 13x9 (1 can of apples 10-12 slices of bread), 8x8 (1/2 all ingredients 8 slices of bread, 1 can apples) and just recently a large catering pan ( 2 and a half cans of apples 20 slices of bread and double all the other ingredients) Same cooking time for all.  I have had success each time. The only thing is a bit of overflow in the oven with the 8x8 dish. Thanks CALJAKE!

Oh Boy!!!  This is the goldmine of french toast recipes!!!  I used two 10 inch corningware bake pans instead of the 9X13 pan which allowed for enough room.  I also used 16 slices of 12-grain bread which fit nicely in a double layer (8 slices per pan).  I had no apple pie filling on hand so I used 1/3 of the Apple Pie Filling Recipe on this site submitted by Terri (thanks for that great recipe too!).  The 12-grain bread gave an extra chewy crunch and next time I think I may add chopped walnuts in between the bread layers!  Thank you Sue!! :)

This was good but very, very sweet.  It's better as a dessert than a breakfast meal.  I would definitely take purplesweetheart's recommendation and use fresh apples, like Granny Smith, instead of the canned.  Even the kids thought it was too sweet.

I made this for breakfast this morning and it was really good.  I used blueberry pie filling and halved the recipe.  I think next time though, I'd use fresh fruit - apples or blueberries or something - and skip the pie filling.  With the butter and sugar in the bottom you really really don't need all the sugary syrupy stuff that goes with pie filling.  If you must, you could likely bump up the brown sugar and butter if you're skipping the pie filling.  I think fresh apples would be way better.  Kids LOOOVED it as I made it though :)  With fresh fruit, I'd give it a 6  ;)

****UPDATE****
As I suspected, WAY nicer with fresh apples even with the skins left on.  I didn't even really up the butter and brown sugar in the bottom of the pan either, maybe just a smidge as I was measuring what was called for.  So good!

I made it for Christmas morning.  I used the sugar free apple pie filling and cinnamon swirl bread.  It had just the right amount of sweetness for us.  I think next time I will add some nuts to the brown sugar mixutre.  Thanks for the keeper recipe!

This was excellent.  Everyone loved it. I cut the recipe in half and only was able to fit in 8 pieces of bread as opposed to 10.  I used normal canned apple pie filling and it was so easy!  Only thing I didn't do was add the maple syrup at the end and we just scooped out of the pan instead of dumping the pan over.  Excellent.  Will definitely make again!

I absolutely loved this french toast.  I've never attempted any french toast before, but I don't know that I'll try another!  I made it exactly as stated with the exception of halving everything for an 8x8 pan and using the cinnamon swirled bread that someone recommended.  I also took everyone's recommendations to bake it the full 75 minutes.  My husband and I loved it!  I wouldn't change anything.  I'll definitely be making this again!

I cut this recipe in half and baked it in an 8x8" glass pan.  I used only 8 pieces of bread and pre-dipped them in the french toast mixture before refrigerating overnight (as another reviewer suggested).  It baked for about 40 minutes.  I didn't broil it after putting on the syrup due to the glass pan.  Solid recipe!

We enjoyed this last Christmas --Made it Christmas Eve to bake while opening presents.   On the sweet side try to lite apple pie filling or fresh tart apples. Leave uncovered for last 10 minutes or more to crisp up. yum

This is a great recipie for brunch.  It makes a large amount, so the second time around I halved the recipie and it worked fine.  Also I use cinnamon raisin bread instead of white and it is excellent.
Thanks for the Great recipie

This french toast is SO yummy! Making it the night before is SO much easier! I used thick sliced bread so I didn't need as many slices...I used 12 slices.

I make this every year, for either Thanksgiving or Christmas.  Simple to put together, and everyone loves it. I always use a dense bread, like country white, and cut it in cubes.  It makes it much easier to fit it all in the pan, and I think the milk mixture absorbs better.  I never bother adding the maple syrup, I don't think it needs it.

This was so delicious. I followed the recipe to a tee except I baked it right away. The advice was right to spray the aluminum foil cover because it rises. The whole family enjoyed it warm and cold. Delicious.

Made this for Superbowl Sunday Brunch and everyone LOVED it.  Only switch I made was using the thick texas toast bread instead of french.  I am wishing I had a deeper dish though because it bubbled out and over into my oven. (it needed cleaning anyway!)  Thanks for the yummy recipe!

I rarely review recipes but I had to make sure to comment on this.  This was awesome!  I made it for a football tailgate this morning and everyone LOVED it!  I used 1 can of apple pie filling and two fresh apples.  Also, I used Texas Toast like a few others mentioned...used 12 pieces, two layers right on top of each other.  It was scrumptious!

I had 30 guests for brunch; everyone asked for the recipe. I used challah bread cubed; if I hadn't, the break wouldn't have soaked up enough of the batter. I soaked the cubes in the milk and egg mixture until they were soft. They absorbed it very well. I sprayed a metal large casserole pan very well with olive oil spray. It did not stick at all. It looked georgous when it came out of the oven. I baked it for 60 minutes as I live at 6500 ft. I did cut it in squares turning it over to the apple side on a decorative platter. My guests devoured it. I shall surely make this again, as will my many guests who took the recipe. Yetta from Albuquerque.

I made this for christmas morning and was met with fabulous comments.  The only thing I would do differently is soak the bread prior to putting it in the baking dish.  I could not get the egg mixture to spread evenly.

I had high hopes for this one.  Instead of pouring the egg mixture of the bread, I dipped each piece and then placed it over the apples.  I discarded the remaining egg mixture in an attempt to keep my bread from turning soggy.  I removed the foil the last 15 minutes of baking and then broiled it for as long as possible without it burning.  The apple mixture tasted great.  The top of the bread was nice and crunchy, but again the rest of the bread was mushy.  This is my 3rd French Toast casserole to try.  I'm giving up and sticking to the old fashioned way of making french toast.

This was the 1st French Toast casserole recipe I have tried that didn't come out soggy.  I scaled the recipe down to 7.5 servings.  The kids wouldn't touch it, but they are extremely fussy.  Husband thought it was good.  I thought it was a bit sweet.  I did use half and half instead of milk as others have suggested.  I did make a mess flipping it though!!

I made a much smaller version of this breakfast ( a single versus a crowd version) but cutting the amounts of bread. And for the bread, use your favorite bread for this, don't limit yourself to plain white bread.

This is easy and delicious! Like others, I thinly sliced fresh apples and lightly sautéed them in a little bit of butter instead of using canned pie filling - they were perfect! I also used whole wheat bread (16 slices, fitting 8 to my pan and then adding a second layer of bread). I increased the eggs from 6 to 8 so that each serving had the equivalent of one whole egg. I baked it for 75 minutes to make sure it wasn't soggy. Adding real maple syrup and broiling for two minutes was a nice touch - really finished it off!

I made 2 glass pans (9 x 13) last night using 1 french loaf in each pan cut in large cubes. I used unpeeled cored sliced apples with honey and butter with a sprinkle of cinnamon for the bottom of one pan and the other I did the same to the apples except I added dried cranberries. yummmy...In the egg mixture, I put eggs, 1/2 & 1/2 cream, vanilla, cinnamon and 1 tbsp of sugar.I put bread cubes in a bowl a little at a time and poured the egg mixture over it then put it loosely on top of the apple mixture then sprinkled a tsp of sugar on the top. This morning, the family and son's friend thought it was chronic (awesome)! ;) I will definitely make this again because it is prepared all the night before then in the morning you only have to pop it in the oven!

I love this recipe!  The reason for only four stars is I did make a few changes after reading the reviews.  I only used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup butter.  I also only used one can of apple pie filling.  I used cream in place of the milk and I used cinnamon raisin bread instead of white bread.  It was a great base recipe though and the result was so good!  This will be part of our Christmas morning breakfast for sure!

I made it with 3/4 c sugar and 1/2 c butter but I still didn't like it.  It didn't seem that appealing in the picture but I had already committed to it so I tried it anyway.  It doesn't look any better in person.  Maybe fresh apples might help.  I cooked mine for 1 hr 10 min and it wasn't soggy but it still doesn't taste wonderful like the other review claim.  It was ok for those who like sweet mush for breakfast or lunch.

I gave it 4 stars because even after baking for close to 2 hours and a trip to the broiler it still came out soggy. However, everyone requested it again so next time I'll just try a little thicker bread. I used bread that was medium dense from a local bakery and I think that was my problem. Very yummy!

We loved it!  I used whole milk and just a little less than 1 1/2 cups and regular apples.

I LOVED this yummy french toast, and it was so easy! This was the perfect recipe for our busy family- I never have the time or energy to cook up a nice breakfast, but since this was 'make ahead', it saved me! I did change the amount of bread- I was using a smaller baking dish, so I ended up only using 8 slices of bread. I actually don't know how I could have fit 20 pieces of bread in my LARGEST baking pan, though. I also found 'no sugar added' apple pie filling, and chose that instead, after reading other reviews saying it was too sugary. It was great! My oven tends to cook a little quicker, so it only took about 50 minutes, and then 3 minutes on broil. The consistency wasn't as crispy as some people make their french toast- it was kind of a mix between bread pudding and french toast. It didn't bother anyone, though.  I will DEFINITELY make this again, and maybe even try different pie filling flavors :)

The only thing I thought would be improved with this recipe, was to cut down on the sugar used. I have a sweet tooth, but this was even a little much for me. Next time I will make my own apple mixture (cooking them in butter, a touch of sugar and cinnamon) instead of the pie filling - which I thought added a lot of sugar and also made the texture of the apples softer than what I would've liked.  I think overall, it is a good recipe though. I will make minor adjustments for our tastes and use the recipe a lot.

Very,very good,and so easy! I could not put in 20 slices, maybe 16, and I really pushed the bread down. I like the idea of trying it with raisin bread next time,and also using my own apple pie filling. I did have to bake it a little longer, but not much, because I let it sit out for an hour before baking it, and did take the foil off the last 10 minutes.

This was absolutley amazing.  I strongly recommend that you don't use the apple pie filling, though.  Use fresh, chopped apples.  I used about five macintoshes for a half-recipe and I think that's one of the reasons this turned out so good.  It made it healthier, too.

the IDEA is great. the RECIPE ISN'T.  it requires too much tweeking. it simply doesn't fit in the pan for starters. I reduced it and it still overflowed. The cook time is alllll wrong... if someone could purge this recipe out of the site and put in an amended one, it would be a 4 or 5 star breakfast. But the way it is right now I feel all of you have been way to generous with the stars...aside from the overflowing and the extra cook time... the thing tasted great. note... next time i would definitely use fresh apples.

The flavor was delicous. I love sweet so it worked for me, although it was soggy and i cooked it for the full amount of time. Maybe because i could only fit 12 slices of bread, and i used the full amount of egg. But it still tasted good soggy or not, although i wish it had a little crunch to it.

This was SO good!  I scaled down the recipe and actually made it for dinner one night.  I used no sugar added apple pie filling as well as sugar free maple syrup and it turned out really yummy.  It's been requested again since.

I love this recipe and it has become a Christmas morning tradition in my family.  Both my mother and mother in law rave about it - the best thing is how easy it is to put together!  I only use 1 cup of milk to help eliminate sogginess, and I also use 1 1/2 cans of pie filling because I can't get it all to fit in the pan.  Spray the tin foil with some Pam before covering the pan; it will help prevent the bread from sticking during baking.

This was a big hit at my house! I didn't use all of the egg mixture. I used just enough to soak the bread. I used homemade apple pie filling and homemade french bread.
Like I said it was a real hit at our house.
And mine cooked up perfect in 60 min.

I made this for Easter breakfast and everyone loved it.  I used the amish white bread from this site (reducing the sugar to 1/4 cup), one can of apple pie filling and eggbeaters.  It was delicious.

Disappointing. The bread was soggy. I used slices of Cuban bread. Will not make this again. The flavor was good enough to put up with or try to correct the sogginess.

I loved this recipe, Sue.  It was wonderful having Christmas breakfast sorted out the night before.  I baked the dish for 1 hour and 15 minutes whilst I went out for a run and relaxed.  

I followed the recipe as written but added some sultanas to the canned apple layer.  I used a double layer of white bread on top.  

My only other suggestion is that lining the pan with baking paper and also putting baking paper over the bread mix before the foil to prevent sticking.  I lost the top crust of my bread layer to the alfoil.

I did use the maple syrup glaze step as well.  I didn't find the recipe too sweet and my mum (who hates things too sweet) agreed with me.  The canned apples I used had no added sugar.

I served this with low fat vanilla icecream.

It was good but I found it too sweet. If I was to make it again, I would either skip the butter, sugar, etc step or else I would just use apples (i.e., not pie filling).

Excellent Christmas morning treat!  My substitutions - fresh sliced apples lightly fried in butter and cinnamon instead of pie filling; a thin layer of maple butter instead of drizzled syrup and  baguette slices instead of sandwich bread.  Worked out well.  Next time I'll soak each piece of bread first and pour the remaining egg mixture to avoid the bottom layers being too saturated.

Everyone loved this.  Very pretty presentation, very filling and moist.  I made several alterations:  In addition to halving the recipe, I decreased the amount of brown sugar, added about a 1/4 c. chopped cranberries between the sugar/butter layer and apple layer to cut down on the sweetness and add visual interest.  To avoid bubbling over, I used a springform pan (the bottom wrapped in foil).  Easy to invert & turn out and did not bubble over at all!

We loved this recipe! I made it with the Granny Smith apples instead of the apple pie filling and used egg substitute and skim milk.  I also used only a half cup of butter and brown sugar.  I was worried it would be too sweet.  It turned out PERFECT!

wow!! i really enjoyed this dish.  it was perfect for breakfast.  very simple procedure, and very nice that you make it the night before and all you have to do in the morning is pop it in the oven.  i always hate having to wake up early to make good french toast, so this was very good for me. and.. it was delicious!!! i added a couple pecans both under the bread with the cinnamon apple mixture, and on top. i think the pecans were a really nice touch, and made it even more delicious. must try this one.

This is wonderful!  VERY sweet.  I used a deep 9x13 pan so it wouldn't cook out over the top of the pan.  I used thick sliced french bread, so used fewer slices. Think it would be great w/blueberry or peach pie filling too.  Thanks Sue for a great recipe.

I loved it. I only used one can of caned  apple pie filling and no syrup. It will be sweet enough without the syrup.Plus I dipped the bread instead of pouring the mixture over it, than layered it.

This was great, but I had to make several adjustments.  I omitted the butter, brown sugar, & cinnamon (too sweet for my taste).  I made in a 9x9 pan, so I used only 1 can of apple pie filling, 10 slices of bread (used Pepperidge Farm cinnamon-raisin bread), 3 eggs, 3/4 cup milk, 1/2 tsp. vanilla.  Baked for 45 minutes.  I omitted the maple syrup, but wish I hadn't.  Will be making this again, so I will add it next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

I read the reviews followed tips that other reviews gave and it turned out awesome! I used an 11x17 pan without changing the ingredient amounts. I used evaporated milk instead of regular milk and baked it for about 90minutes before drizzling the maple syrup on & broiling it. I put a bit of melted butter to coat the pan and then added about a tsp of lemon juice and a sprinkle of ground nutmeg, ground cloves and cinnamon to the 2 cans of apple pie filling (to avoid it being overly sweet) before spreading it in the pan. I found a local bakery makes french toast bread which is thicker sliced white bread with maple syrup baked in (yum!), and I used the entire loaf which was 20 slices. A few of the slices I cut in half to fill the pan and I really smooshed the bread down into the apple pie filling. After pouring the egg mixture (to which I also added spices) onto the bread, I used a rubber spatula to spread the egg mixture all over the bread filling in any extra spaces. It turned out firm and not soggy with wonderful apple flavor to compliment the traditional french toast flavor. I would make it over again just the same. Everyone loved it, and the few slices I had leftover tasted kind of like an apple fritter or streudel pastry when I had a slice cold from the fridge the next morning. A good to go breakfast! It never needed any additional butter or syrup on top even when it was warm from the oven. I'm so glad I read the reviews and made the adjustments I did! Recipe reviews can be

I have made this a fewtimes and everyone just loves it! Instead of the canned pie filling, I used fresh apples (3-6), peeled and thinly sliced. I tossed those with 1/2 cup melted butter (3/4 cup leaves a soppy, greasy mess at the bottom), 3/4 cup brown sugar, and 2-3 teaspoons cinnamon. I have always been able to fit eighteen slices of bread in my 9x13 pans (three layers of six). This bakes up perfectly in 70-75 minutes. Spraying the tin foil is an absolute MUST or it will stick. This recipe will be around our house for a long, long time. It's absolutely perfect!

This recipe was delicious and I cut back the brown sugar to about 3/4 cup and the butter back to 1/2 cup.  I cooked it for the full 75 minutes and then broiled it with imitation syrup since I didn't have any maple. I also used cinnamon swirl bread in lieu of white bread. Everything else was the same and it turned out amazing.

My family absolutely loved this recipe. I  did have to substitute fresh apples for the canned filling because it is what I had on hand.  I was only able to fit 18 slices of bread into the dish and I had to really squish it to get it to fit. My bake time was also longer than stated.  I baked it for for 75 minutes covered (grease the foil!) and then uncovered for an additional 20 minutes uncovered and before broiling. This will be a standard holiday family breakfast for years to come.

Great !  Very easy to make.  You really can't go wrong with it.  I just had to downsize it a bit but other than that made it by the recipe.

Great recipe for a gathering! A few modifications....used real apples and blueberries, cut crust off of the bread, and used 1/2 the sugar. Everyone added their own pure maple syrup. Served with vanilla Greek yogurt and Canadian back bacon. Great crowd pleaser with my family.

Easy.  Used 1/2 c. Butter and 3/4 c. Brown sugar, and 1 can of apple;  just squirted some syrup on at the end and boiled for 4 minutes or so.
- cook for over 75 minutes - more like 1.5 hrs.
If find a cherry filling with no high fructose add that with the apple
- do cover with nonstick foil cos it fluffs up and may stick to foil

Delicious!!  Made a small batch first 1/4 th of given ingredients, but later regretted not making a larger quantity cause it was finished in 10 minutes!  5 ppl ate it and loved it. Didn't have apples so used cherries, but I feel apples would be best. Will try again soon for a Sunday brunch :)

This is an easy and delicious recipe.  I used day old Italian bread and cut into thin (20)slices It did not take a whole loaf,  and cut the butter down to 1/2 cup.  Everyone wanted the recipe.

We liked it.  Didn't have apple filling so used blueberry filling instead.  Use an entire loaf of white bread and doubled the layers overlapping and distributing the slices to cover before pressing down into egg mixture.  Will try adding cinnamon to the egg mixture next time. Did not invert the mixture and just scooped out of pan -- less dishes that way.

We tried this and it was delicious. I only used one can of pie filling, one stick of butter, and 3/4cup brown sugar, and added some dried cranberries to the pie filling. Also omitted the syrup. It was sweet enough, with the cranberries adding just a touch of tartness.

This was awesome, I followed another review, sautéed apples in  1/2 c butter and used cinnamon raisin bread. I didn't bother with the syrup and broiling - we used syrup at the table.  This was a huge hit.

I followed this recipe word for word (only I cut up slices of thick maple flavored french toast), and had to double it as I was taking it to a large gathering for Christmas brunch.  It did take an hour and a half to cook, but turned out phenomenal! Everyone absolutely loved it! Definitely a keeper! DELISH!

This recipe looked really fantastic to me--easy to make, ideal for a busy morning b/c you do everything the night before but cook it, and I love apples so that addition to French toast was right up my alley. When I prepared this, I thought two cans of apples seemed like a lot but one didn't exactly cover the pan so I used two. I used Pepperidge Farm cinnamon bread and that was a great addition. It wasn't 20 slices but whatever was in a loaf completely filled my glass 9x13 to the brim (two layers of bread). Too bad I didn't account for the expanding bread when it baked and I ended up with a mess in my oven because the juices bubbled up and over. Be sure to use a taller 9x13 if you can, or put a baking sheet under to catch the overflow. It still baked through and looked great. Unfortunately, it was way too sweet, and I'm a big fan of sugar, my friends. So for me to think it's so sweet it was almost inedible is something. Because I loved the cinnamon/apple combo, I'll give this another whirl but will use thinly sliced fresh apples. The brown sugar/butter in the bottom of the pan will be plenty to sweeten those up to what I hope will be an ideal level.

tasted very good but took forever to cook. 90 minutes plus sitting in a warm oven while we had a meeting.  Made in  a foil pan, not sure if that made it take longer.  Used a combination of breads we had - artisan sourdough and cinnamon raisin.  Used one can pie filling and about 2 C of thawed unsweetened frozen apple slices - plenty sweet. Agree with some others that this is way too much butter and brown sugar in the bottom.  served it right out of the pan and everyone loved it.  Not sure it would have held its shape if I had turned it over on the cookie sheet.   
Will make some changes and make again.

I made this for Easter Brunch and it flew out of the casserole dish to OMG's this is so good and Yummo's! It was a great! I used Pepperidge Farms Cinnamon Swirl bread but that's the only thing I changed and it was fantastic! My grandchildren loved it and I'll be making it again and again! Thanks for a great recipe!!

Good, but I agree with the reviewers who say this is almost too sweet for breakfast.  It tastes more like a dessert.  I used cherry pie filling since that is what I had and toasted a cinnamon swirl bread so the bread wouldn't be soggy.  This worked perfectly, but I don't think the syrup or the sugar and butter mixture is necessary--unless you use fresh fruit, in which case, the bottom sugar and butter mixture would be nice.  I did make sure to press the bread down into the pie filling and used tin foil on the bottom and sprayed it generously.  Glad I did--some of the bread was sticking to the tinfoil.  Thanks for the recipe!

I recently used this recipe for a breakfast and it was awesome! Total homerun!!! I ended up baking it for 70 minutes - used whole milk and instead of white bread I used the Cinnabon cinnamon bread and it was out of this world yummy!!! Make sure foil isn't to tight when baking, I had one piece of bread stick a little to the foil.

Made this with the apple pie filling recipe on this site. I used 6 cups of apples and scaled the filling recipe back to serve 10. This turned out okay but was super liquidy and too sweet (although our kids absolutely loved it). Next time I think I'll just saute the apples in butter and cinnamon if I'm using fresh apples. Thanks!

Excellent! I made this recipe twice already. The first time I only had one can of pie filling on hand and it turned out fine. The second time I did use both cans and it was good both ways. This one is a keeper. Thanks

I made this for breakfast New Year's day and all of my guests couldn't get over how beautiful the dish looked. It not only looked beautiful but it tasted amazing. I could only fit 18 slices of white bread in my dish and I would highly recommend putting a cookie sheet underneath to catch all the yummy overflow.

I made this for my family on Christmas Eve for Christmas morning brunch. It was super easy and very tasty. Next time, I will try using sliced french or italian bread. Drizzling the syrup over the top & then broiling it was ther perfect finish! It carmalized on top & made it gloriously chewy & crispy. We had sausage patties with it, special Christmas coffee, & grapefruit halves. It was perfect for a holiday breakfast.

I have been making this for Christmas morning breakfast for a couple of years now. Because the recipe calls for it to be made the night before, then baked in the morning makes it a perfect holiday breakfast...while its baking we are opening gifts...Simply delicious....My family looks forward to our new Christmas morning tradition!

This is a decedent tasty recipe.  I modified it slightly although I am sure the recipe as is works just as well.  I used raisin challah bread and sliced it in 1" thick slices.  I was able to fill the pan with approximately 9 slices of bread.  I used only 1 can of apple pie filling.  I used the recommended amount of milk and eggs, but when pouring the mixture on top of the bread I only used about 1/2.  The finished product was excellent! Next time I will cut down the sweetness a bit by browning some fresh apple slices on the stove top first in lieu of the canned apples.  Definitely try this recipe as you will not be disappointed.

This was just "ok."  It served the purpose of feeding a lot of people with minimal prep, but I didn't feel as WOWed as most of the reviewers.  It was kind of sloppy and just tasted like warmed up pie filling over bread.  Not my favorite, but it gets points for being convenient and serving a lot of people.

Very good. I made it with raisin bread like other suggested. I left out the maple syrup part because I didn't have any. It was perfect without it. I think the syrup would have made it too sweet. Definately a keeper.

This was SO EASY and super yummy!  I made this for my monthly "Supper Swap" club that I belong to with 5 other mom friends of mine who also have little ones and busy schedules. I made 8 pans so I halved the recipe and made it in 8x8 pans.  I used apples from my apple tree in our backyard and also used the Pepperidge Farm Cinnamon Swirl bread and used 1/2 milk and decided to go on a whim and substitute sugar free French Vanilla creamer for the other half milk it called for. I baked it fo 90 min and it turned out great!!!  We did top ours with a Mrs Butterworths sugar free syrup (like you would a traditional french toast.)  Next time just for the heck of it I would like to try it using the apple pie filling and texas toastjust to see the diffence but I loved how it turned out and using my own apples...they're FREE!  This one is a keeper though I agree!

Decided to make this at the last minute today for brunch and it was delicious, even without preparing it last night. Besides not putting it together the night before, I also cut the recipe in half. It was delicioso!!

Only 1 can of apples is key.  I also use cinnamon raisin bread instead of plain white.  Always the 1st dish gone at an open house.

Fantastic recipe!  I was only able to squeeze in 9 pieces of bread, but I used thicker, cinnamon swirled bread.  I made it for a large group during a vacation,and it got rave reviews. I will definitely make it again.......

Loved it.  Didn't follow recipe exactly.  Don't know how you'd get that many bread slices into a 9x13-inch pan so I used 12 slices of bread.  Didn't need maple syrup on top -- sweet enough.  Next time I'll try using blueberry pie filling.  Followed one poster's recommendation and greased tin foil so french toast wouldn't stick to it.   I'd also suggest adding some chopped pecans to the brown sugar/butter mixture on the bottom.

This was actually quite delicious, even though I looked away from the broiler for a split second and it started to burn.  I quickly took it out and since it is served inverted it was just fine.
This is a very rich dish.

I made this for my husband and my 2 year old and it turned out great!  I reduced the recipe to a 9x9 pan since there were only 3 (2 1/2 really) of us and it was still more than enough.  I also substitued soy milk for the regular milk because my daughter is allergic to milk and I could not taste a difference.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was so good and so easy!  I made this for a Christmas Day brunch - prepared them xmas eve, and they were a big hit!  I had to split the recipe in half and put in 2 smaller pans.  I used 3 eggs and 1 cup of milk; I think I'd increase this next time.
Having said all this, I'm making it again soon!

This is a wonderful recipe.  I made this for a special weekend brunch and it was a bit hit.  I used cinnamon swirled bakery bread and that worked out well.  I will be making this again and again...

very good and oh so easy. even good the following morning reheated in the microwave. this is great - i even cut it down to serve 5 instead of 15 and used an 8x8 glass pan - same great results.

oh - i baked it at 350 F for 45 mins with the tin foil OFF... cooked faster it seemed.

Four stars from a bona fide french toast hater!  Baking it seemed to firm up that slimey milky bread in the center which made it inedible to me.  Too much butter for my taste, but you don't need the maple syrup with the apple pie goo as a topping.

It was a little soggy but the taste is fabulous. I cut the recipe in half, and did 12 slices of bread in 2- 9 X 13 pans.  Very gooey. I'll definately make this again.

Very good and easy.  I did change some of the ingredients, 3/4 C brown sugar, 4 eggs, 1C milk, 6 pieces of pepperidge farm cinnamon bread and only 1 can of apples.  My family loved it! We added some whipped cream for the top.  Definately make again.

Because there are just two of us here, I split this in half and made it in a 9x9 pan - that's where things got a little messy. My dish overflowed, which wouldn't have been so bad had I thought to put a cookie sheet underneath it. After it finished baking, I shut off the oven before putting the syrup on top and broiling it, to let some of the smoke dissipate. This was a very messy dish (my fault I'm sure), but we really liked it. It had a nice dense bread center (unlike other overnight french toast recipes that we've tried - they were mostly mush and some other odd ingredients). Instead of milk, I used half & half, simply because I had some in the house that needed to be used up.

It was a lot of work and a lot of time, but I will definitely make this again because it was worth it.

This was really a hit at our house.  I made it last Easter and have had many requests to make it again.  It was just as good or better the second day for leftovers!

Fantastic recipe.  Makes a terrific tasting dessert.  Tends to be a little bit messy to serve, but it's definitely worth it in terms of taste.

I will definitely be making this again!!! The first time that I made this I followed the directions to a 'T' but the down fall was that using slices of bread invited people to take a full slice instead of scooping out a portion so that everyone could enjoy. This time I used brioche bread cut up in cubes. I still ran out because this dish is so delicious!!!!

 I only used 1 & 1/2 cans of apple filling.

This recipe was a nice change. Loved that you put it in the fridge the night before then just pop it in the oven. The taste was good but like other reviewers there’s no way to get the full amount of bread in a 9x13 in pan. Hate only giving it 3 stars but I was the only one in the house that would eat it. Had others I would give it a higher rating. Not a repeat but worth trying. Thanks for the recipe.

Best French toast bake yet.  Better luck tearing bread into chunks.  Whole slices made a dense flat bake, torn pieces rose and fluffed in pan.  You need a pan below to catch dripping in oven.

I read several of the reviews before making this recipe myself.  I used can apples in water (drained) and it turned out fantastic.  Not to sweet.  I also baked it at the recommended time of 75 minutes.

Perfect for Christmas Day! Make it the night before and pop it in the over while trying to stay awake for the kids unwrapping presents. 
I forgot to top with maple syrup and it was a bit too sweet. Everyone still licked their plates clean, including my mother in law. I'm going to use one less can of pie filling next time. Which is going to be this Saturday.

We absolutely loved this. I attempted a half batch and didn't account for the butter to bubble up and over the edges. I suggest placing a cookie sheet underneath if you do a half batch to avoid burnt butter on the bottom of your stove. Ooopsie!

Yes! With my little changes like less sugar and half the recipe for just 3 people, still too much food. But a great dish for a family especially on Christmas morning. I also used fresh apples. Apples in butter, cinnamon, brown sugar... YUM. 
I will be making this again.

Way too sweet - even though I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup could have done without it at all - The apple pie filling would have been enough or maybe I should have used fresh apples.

Great recipe! Easy to make and delicious to eat. Baking time does vary. I baked once for 75 min and it was dryer done. 2nd time 75 min was “moister” (if that’s even a word) done.

This was delicious!  I halved the recipe and made it in a 9 x 9 baking dish.  I used Pepperidge Farm cinnamon raisin French toast bread and used 9 slices.  I baked for 70 minutes, then the 2 minute broiling with syrup.  I will bake a few more minutes next time.  I may add chopped pecans on top of the apples.  It is very sweet, which I like.

This makes way to much for just the two of us. What I have tried that is easy to make the number of servings you need. Aldi stores have apple strudel bread (at least they do in the fall). I mekd the french toast by dipping the bread in a milk and egg mixture with afew teaspoons of sugar and cinnamon to taste. Let the bread soak this up a bit. Fry in a bit of butter. Tastes great topped with maple syrup or powdered sugar. Or try browing apple slices in butter then add brown sugar, apple cider and cinnamon. Simmer for awhile to thicken sauce. The apple mixture is also good on pumpkin spice pancakes

I love this recipe, but it's too sweet for our tastes.  We halve the sugars, and use sliced apples instead of the apple pit filling, and we like it much better.

Turned out very tasty. I used only 1 can of the apple pie filling and it was plenty, 2nd can would have been too many apples. BE SURE to have either a cookie sheet underneath or something else, because it will bubble over.

I agree with another review, it was SO soggy.  I baked it for almost 2 hours, and still it was soggy.  I finally put it in the microwave in smaller portions to get it done.  It has a very good taste to it, but I don’t think I will be making it again.
And, no, I made no changes to the recipe.

Absolutely delicious. Served on Xmas Day for brunch. My only addition was double the cinnamon, and I used French bread.
More like a dessert, than French toast.  Making it again tonight for brunch tomorrow for guests

I just finished making this for my family this morning as a special Thanksgiving breakfast. I took a bite; Yummy- It tastes delicious! The aroma of cinnamon in the kitchen is tempting. I can't wait for my family to wake up and try it. I'm 100% sure my kids, most especially will love it. I love the fact that the recipe is easy to follow and convenient to prepare overnight and toss in the oven in the morning.

Four of us all made this recipe for an early morning faculty meeting and every recipe tasted different.  They all tasted wonderful, but none of them even looked the same.  They all tasted so good, I'm planning to make it for Christmas morning.

Halved the recipe and put in a 8.5 x 11 pan but still overflowed, consider a deep dish disposable next time.  Delish, made our own apple pie filling

Far too sweet and the bread was mushy- more like a bread pudding.  I will not ever make this again.

This recipe is fantastic.  I needed a recipe that I could use for Advent breakfast at church for over 100 people.  It had to look beautiful.  I followed the recipe the first time I made it but found there was too much brown sugar syrup so I cut that in half.  To invert the very hot casseroles quickly was dangerous so instead of putting the apple pie filling on the bottom of the casserole pan I put it on top -on top of the bread layers and egg mixture.  No need to invert-looks beautiful.  Threw in a few cranberries on top on look more festive-done!

This didn't work for me and I am sorry it didn't. It should 
have its a perfect recipe. I forgot to keep the foil on it as it
cooked, that's all. I used 2 cans pie filling , and rasin bread.
It spilled over in oven and made a terrible mess. Dish still fine but soggy underneath and far to sweet.  Even though this should  have worked out, I don't think I can try again. The sweetness and mess will always remain with me.

This a pretty good and easy. I double stacked Texas toast and use almost the whole loaf. It is very filling so I would probably half the recipe if I make it again for just our family.

We like this very much. Make sure the baking dish has room for the apple/egg mixture to bubble up and expand to avoid overflow in the oven. I use cinnamon swirl bread and it is delicious! Very easy.

I make this recipe every year, the night before Easter.  Easter morning I just pop it in the oven for about 1 and 1/2 hours. Everyone loves it.  I also use Pepperidge Farm cinnamon raisin bread. Easter is coming, so this year I will make it again, and hear every ones oooo's and aaaahs. It's SOOOO GOOD !!!!!!!

I made this for new year's day breakfast and it was a hit. I was a little concerned since I didn't let it sit overnight but baked it immediately after mixing the ingredients. I added one more egg, used a mix of milk and half and half and a few more pieces of bread. It came out beautifully although I had to bake it for about 90 minutes. It's important to let it cool so that the bottom mixture can thicken a bit. I can't wait to make this again. Delicious!

This was great; although I did make a few changes. I used 1/2 cup butter and also added 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice to the sugar mixture. I spread this on the bottom of an 9x13 dish. I then added thinly sliced apples all over this versus using the pie filling. I mixed the egg mixture as written but added a tsp of pumpkin pie spice to this as well. I used thinly sliced challah bread and dipped it in the egg mixture. I ended up with two layers of this and poured the little bit of egg on top. I sprayed the foil and in the fridge it went overnight. Straight in the oven for 60 minutes covered and then uncovered the last 10. I cooled for 5 minutes and flipped it over as I plated it. It was plenty sweet without the apple pie filling and no maple syrup either (almost too sweet). Everyone gobbled it up. I like that you can literally just throw it in the over straight from the fridge in the morning versus having to sit out like other morning casseroles.

I made this for my Christmas brunch and it was very good! Instead of using apple pie filling I sliced 4/5 smaller apples and just used that. Came out excellent with less sugar. I also used apple oat honey bread from Wegmans instead of white bread and it was great! Will definitely make this again!

Pleasantly surprised at this easy to prepare, bake and serve brunch entree.  Simple to customize for family or friends by adding nuts to the topping, substituting fresh fruit for the canned, using any bread on hand, etc.  Our crowd of 7 (all ages) raved and asked for seconds.  Almost having dessert for breakfast.  A new Family Favorite!

This is a wonderful brunch recipe – easy preparation and good flavor.  I had made it in a round pan so the presentation would be attractive but it fell apart when I inverted the pan.  This is probably my fault because I didn’t let it rest long enough and my bread wasn’t as stale as I usually use for French toast so it was a little mushy despite baking it for 70 minutes. But overall, the flavor is very good, and it made a yummy Sunday morning breakfast.

I made this yesterday for our church's annual Father's Day breakfast.  We made 3 batches per full steam pan. Afterwards, everyone was commenting how delicious this was and wanted the recipe.  It was a real hit. We did not however let this sit overnight.  We let it sit for about 30 minutes with no trouble.  Also, we could not broil the maple syrup at the end, we just drizzled it over the top.

I made this for a group of friends at the beach.  It was a hit. I made it with 2day old Italian Bread sliced 1 inch thick. Used enough to pack bread in tight.  I recommend using a larger pan as it bubbled over and I lost a lot of the yummy gooey stuff on the bottom.  Did not use the syrup and it was still quite sweet enough for everyone with the sugary apples oozing down the pieces of french toast!   Must cook it for at least 90 minutes until knife comes out clean.  Will definitely make again.

We LOVED this recipe!  Our oven acted funny, so I'm not sure about how long it took, but it was fabulous!  We skipped the maple syrup and broil step because of the pan we used, but followed the directions exactly otherwise and we will be making it again soon...the kids want to have it everyday!!!

Great recipe!  I used 3/4 cup cream and 3/4 cup milk instead of all milk and cinnamon raisin bread instead of white.  Turned out wonderful!  Made it for Valentine's Day brunch and it was a huge success.  Thanks.

This is absolutely delicious!  I really smooshed the bread down to make it all fit before I poured in the egg mixture.  I cut down on the sugar and cooked it for 1-1/2 hours to fully cook the middle.  I also uncovered it for the last 1/2 hour.  This was delicious and very filling.  You only need 1/2 piece (a hungry guy can eat a whole piece).  I only fit six slices in a 9 x 13 pan, too (I was able to get 4 slices high - barely).  A new family favorite!

Gr8eat tasting.  I used 7 eggs, Texas toast - which came to about 8 slices, canned milk, and 1 1/2 cans of apple pie filling.  The other half of the 2nd can of pie filling was used in an 8x8 dish that I made at the same time.  The group that I made it for loved it.  The only drawback to the recipe in my opinion, is that it took a full hour and a half to bake.  I then drizzled syrup on it and put in under the broiler for about 2 minutes.  Will definitely make again, but will keep long baking time in mind.

Very tasty.  Halved the recipe and next time would definately use fresh apples not canned.  But it was a great breakfast to just pop in the oven for Easter Morning!

A little too sweet and soggy.  I wish I would have broiled longer on low because we liked the crunchy edges.  The second time I made this and halved it.  Used less than 1/2 cup of butter and less sugar.  Cooked longer.  Good, but not awesome.

I thought this was a bit too sweet. I did use Challah bread so it came out very light.  I found it to be like a sweet bread pudding.

I rated this a 3 based on appearance.  I think I followed the recipe exactly, but even after letting it rest for at least 10 minutes, the topping stuck to the pan and the dish just looked awful.  A generous sprinkle of powdered sugar took care of that, and it was very tasty.  Don't know if I'd try this one again.

Very good, but you have to buy the right filling or you end up with a lot of goop and not a lot of apples. I used sheapards bread and it turned out great.

This tasted wonderful, but I was disappointed in the presentation. Probably my error, but it kind of "splatted" out, and didn't hold it's shape. I used fresh apples and cut back on the syrup. Perhaps I'll try again. Thanks.

I only ended up using around 10 slices of bread. My 9x13 wasn't deep enough.

Delicious!! I made this for a breakfast at work. I didn't change a thing. Everyone raved about it and asked for the recipe! I felt bad because my dish was empty and a lot of the food that other people brought was left on the table.
I will be making this for Christmas morning for my family.

Awesome!! Awesome!!  Awesome!!  I just wanted like a "French Toast Casserole" and found this great recipe.  I only used 17 pieces of bread and I used the apples with cinnoman and sugar already in them.  Great, fast and easy recipe.

We had this for brunch today. Everyone thought it was great.It was very easy to make . The best part is that you can make it the night before and cook it the next day!

I recently hosted a Mother's Day Brunch for my family. I got rave reviews on how good it was!  And I loved it because it was easy to make the night before so on the morning of the Brunch, all I had to do was pop it in the oven!
