I love this recipe, however, I have to admit, I changed it somewhat.  My daughter had made this and said that she had replaced some of the oil with applesauce.  One of the other comments said that it was awfully sweet, and I am trying to cut down on fat and sugar, so......I cut the sugar in half (only 1 cup), omitted the oil and put in 1 cup of applesauce.  It turned out scrumptious!

Don't know what I did wrong, but this bread would not cook through, even though I followed directions and then cooked for 15 extra minutes! I cut it open anyway to see how it tasted, and it was way to sweet. I will not be making this again.

Really good!  Super dense and moist so if you love that type of baked good you will love this.  Next time I will add nuts because for me I think it would make it even better.  Thanks for sharing!!
UPDATE - I tried the bread with the nuts and suprisingly I did not like it as much.  Made it a third time adding some raisins and absolutely loved the addition.  Also increased the cinnamon to 2 tsp.

Very good -- dense and sweet. I consider it a dessert bread. The changes I made to the recipe was to use 2.5 cups of cubed McIntosh apples to which I added the juice of one lemon.  I also added a teaspoon of lemon zest to the dry ingredients.  I also used a full teaspoon of ground cinnamon.

I've made this several times for two years now, and each time it gets rave reviews! To add some depth I usually replace 1/2c of the white sugar for 1/2c dark brown sugar, and applesauce in lieu of some vegetable oil. Go generous on the vanilla and extra generous on the cinnamon! It needs an extra 20 minutes to bake, too.

I made this recipe with a few changes. I do not like baking loaves, they never cook in the middle. I put the batter in muffin cups and baked at 350 for 25 minutes. They came out moist and delicious! As others have suggested, I used half granulated sugar and half brown sugar. I also doubled the cinnamon. I also added chopped walnuts.

This recipe was a amazing! The bread came out perfect, with a crispy crust and moist inside. I used red delicious apples, and I doubled the cinnamon, but that was all I changed. Overall great!

I was having lunch with a friend I hadn't seen for a while and wanted to take her something so I whipped this up real quick and took it warm.  She said it was the best thing she'd ever put in her mouth!  I changed it slightly by using 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar.  I also used Granny Smith apples mainly because so many reviews said it was too sweet.  I sprinkled the top with turbinado sugar before baking.  After the suggested baking time, it was still soft in the middle so I turned off the oven and left it for about another 15 minutes.  It was fine after that.  I will be making this again, this time for me!

This was fantastic. I used two mini loaf pans. I cut waaaaay down on the sugar using 1/2 cup Brown sugar and about  3/4 cup white.  I also added in 1 cup of rhubarb.  It's delicious!

Holy moly,, this bread is good. Takes a bit longer to bake than the recipe states. Just leave the foil on top of the pan and bake an extra 10 minutes at 275 degrees.Turn off the oven and let it sit in the oven for an additional 10-15 minutes,still leaving the foil on top. Take off the foil and allow to cool in pan for 10 minutes. Turn out onto a wire cooling rack and cool about 15 minutes. Slice it up and slather on some butter. So yummy. A keeper for sure

Such an easy recipe and adaptable to personal preference.  Based on other reviews, I decided to reduce the sugar and replace part with brown sugar.  1/2 cup brown, 3/4 cup white.  I also added a handful of raisins.  I baked it for 45 minutes, but it needed a bit more time, so I turned off the oven and let it sit inside for about 15 more minutes.  It turned out incredibly good.  Thanks for sharing.

Wow!  Amazing bread!  The only changes I made were, I added only 1 cup of sugar, doubled the cinnamon, doubled vanilla extract and used olive oil. I had no trouble cooking it. It rouse beautifully and the texture/density is perfect. Also, I didn't peel the apples. There's no need because you can't tell they are there, so don't waste your time.

After 1 hour, bread was almost uncooked in the middle.  I added 15 minutes, then 15 more, then upped the heat to 375 and cooked it 20 more minutes!   Toothpick STILL wet in the middle.  I took it out, waited the 10 minutes.  The slices 2 from each end were the only ones cooked. I sliced the rest, put them on a cookie rack on a cookie sheet and cooked at 350 for an additional 15 minutes.

Yummy!  You just keep wanting to have a little more!  I made this as written, using about 1 1/2 Jazz apples.  This took about ten minutes longer than the suggested hour, and I'm sure it varies with the temperature of the ingredients and the weather outside!  Now you'll have to excuse me while I go back for just a little bite more!

I read the reviews and despite some lousy ones, forged ahead. None of the problems encountered with other reviewers. Baked for total one hour, covered the last 15 minutes. Need to make sure you use 9x5 loaf pan. I was surprised to find I had loaf pans of several different sizes so this may have been why some reviewers had problems with overflow and undertaking  if the loaf pan was smaller in size. Did cut the sugar down to a cup though as suggested. Thanks for a great recipe. It was easy, did not peel the apples, chopped them in food processor. Greased the pan but did line bottom with parchment.  Slipped right from pan in 10 minutes .

So, I just made this recipe and signed up for Allrecipes just so I could give it a 5 star rating! It was the easiest thing ever and my family liked it so much, they ate the whole thing. I followed a few of the tips from the other reviews and modified it a little. I used 3/4 cup applesauce and no oil, two fuji apples (a little more than 2 cups) and cut the sugar in half (1/2 white and 1/2 dark sugar because I was out of light brown). I also used 2 tsps of cinnamon. It was crunchy on the outside and so moist and delicious inside. Plus it smelled great in the oven!

After reading the reviews I did a few minor changes. I added a little less sugar, 1 C unpacked brown sugar and 3/4C white sugar.  Added a little more than 2 tsp cinnamon and was generous with the 2 tsp vanilla.  Instead of oil I put in plane apple sauce as well. I also have trouble with bread loaves not cooking all the way through.  So, I baked the bread at a lower temp of 325 for 50 minutes and then covered it with tin foil and baked another 20 minutes.  It came out perfect, cooked all the way through and not burnt on the outside!  It turned out soo yummy.

Wow, this is the best bread made in a long time.  Its very moist with a nice crispy outside. Made two loaves, and couldn't be easier to put together. My husband and I both loved this bread and will be making it again and again.

Amazing bread!  I used half white and half brown sugar...yum!  Also used Gala apples (as that's what I had around)  and extra cinnamon.  I will definitely make this again!!  I always wrap my breads in foil within 10 minutes of coming out of the oven.  Keeps all that moisture in!

Great recipe.  I was looking for something to do with some apples I didn't really like.  I used brown sugar and cut it to 1 cup, substituted apple sauce for the oil and used white whole wheat flour.  It was fabulous!!! Thanks for sharing!!!

Pretty good, but way too sweet. Also, despite generously greasing the pans with Pam spray, this bread sticks to the bottom every time. If I make it again I would definitely line the pan with aluminum foil; otherwise, you're sure to get a ruined loaf of bread.

Edit: 
Changes made to original recipe:
Ingredients :
- one cup brown sugar instead of two cups white sugar 
- one cup unsweetened apple sauce instead of oil
- 1 1/2 cup diced apple instead of two cups apples
- 1/2 cup soaked raisins
- Added another 1/2 tsp of cinnamon 
Method:
- Mixed apples and raisins in after mixing in flour mixture instead of before. 
- Baked bread for 55 minutes straight instead of 45 then 15 with foil. 

Result: Good bread! A touch salty though. I will use less salt next time. 

Previous Review: I had the same experience as Debra Lynn Gale. I made the bread exactly as the recipe says, put it in the oven, and three hours plus later, with all the apple chunks already turned to mush and the curst rock hard, the dough inside the crust still looked and felt and tasted very obviously raw. I had to throw the whole thing out. It's very upsetting and disappointing after all that labor and wasted ingredients, especially since the crust had looked and tasted promising. 

I have baked hundreds of cookies and muffins and dozens of bread and cakes. This is the first time I bake something that I can't salvage in any way and have to toss out.

I did feel while putting the dough in the loaf pan that the dough was way too dense and too full of apple chunks to bake properly, so that may be what the problem is. I may try again using one of the modifications others have suggested.

Now on minute 22 of additional cook time just trying to get it to be anything but batter with a crunchy top.  If I attempt this again, I will cut the sugar and salt measurements in half. The amount of sugar makes the loaf cook like a giant cookie rather than a cake/bread.

I love this recipe.  I did change a few things... instead of 2 cups white sugar I used 1 1/2 cups white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar, I also substituted pumpkin spice for cinnamon, and coconut oil for vegetable oil.  But this recipe was easy to follow, and I will definitely be making it again!!!!

Very tasty bread!! I only made a couple changes based on reviews and what I had on hand. I used white whole wheat flour, only 1 cup of sugar (1/2 brown, 1/2 white) and I only had 1/4 cup of oil so I melted some shortening to make up the difference. Also sprinkled the top with extra brown sugar and cinnamon, which made a nice crispy topping and smelled so good in the oven!!

The loaf ended up light and moist, and my brother's raving about it.

I don't tend to like overly sweet things, so I cut the sugar in half. Used a bit more than 2 1/4 cups (unpeeled) apple, and sprinkled the top with apple bits and sugar. 

Next time, I'll probably use three apples and dice only one, and mince the other two apples. Might want to add nutmeg and other apple pie spices while decreasing cinnamon to  1/4 t or less

I followed the recipe and it wouldn't cook all the way through and the batter bubbled over the top of the baking pan and spilled all over the bottom of my oven.  The top of the bread was super crunchy, almost caramelized from all of the sugar.   The bread was too sweet for me.  I decided to read people's reviews after making the bread.   Many said they cut the amount of sugar in half.

Pretty tasty bread!  I doubled the recipe to make two large loaves.  I used less than half the white sugar called for and substituted half of the white flour for whole wheat.  I also put more than a teaspoon of cinnamon in.  Next time, I will put more cinnamon and maybe some nutmeg or all-spice to give it more flavor.  I ended up baking it for 45 minutes, then 15 more minutes with foil, and 15 more minutes left in the oven off.  It was perfectly done and full of juicy apple chunks!

Very tasty. Used 2 Granny Smiths, halved the sugar and substituted brown, tbsp of vanilla instead of 2 tsp and added 1/2 tsp nutmeg. Didn't use foil. Not too sweet and very nice with tea.

This was good, however I did make the changes of using whole wheat pastry flour and cut the sugar in half...it was still too sweet for us. Next time I will cut the sugar back even more and add an additional 1/2 cup apples and walnuts as well! Thank you!

This bread is exceptionally good. Moist and not too sweet (used granny smith apples).  Loved the crust like exterior.  To save on dishes I did not mix the flour, baking powder and cinnamon in a separate bowl.

I don't understand what happen. I literally followed the recipe from A to Z. It didn't bake properly. I even added more time and the bottom got overcooked, the top was crunchy but the inner was still raw.

First time.. followed the recipe exactly   too dense and lacking in flavor. Very doughy  and I kept cooking until the skewer came out reasonably clean.  I ended up tossing it.  2nd time I made it, I doubled the cinnamon, and ;still found it to be like a dough ball.  Still not happy with the flavor...  weak.   SO the the 3rd time I made this, I put in into a square pan, not a loaf pan,  I used 1 1/2 T. apple pie spice.  and that helped the flavor, but still doughy, it fell,  (which made it worse) and all through this time,  the top surface of the bread cracked..  I live in Colorado Springs... and maybe I'm doing something wrong, or expecting a far better result with everyone's 5 stars.. but I'm not willing to waste more ingredients on this recipe.  Unless someone can tell me what the heck I'm doing wrong!.

Very nice reciepe.  Quick and easy to make and no special ingredients. I used Granny Smith apples because that’s what I had and it still turned out well the only thing is that it did take a little longer than what the recipe called for to make but other than that it was great I made it today for the first time in between my mother and my daughter it’s gone

Something is amiss with this recipe.  At no point did it.come together as a batter. It looked like apple crumble going into the pan. I triple checked to.make sure I didnt write something down wrong or miss something. After the cook time and extra, it was a mess.

I doubled this and got 6 mini loaves for teacher Christmas gifts.  They smelled amazing while baking!  Added extra cinnamon and also some nutmeg to the batter, along with chopped pecans.  Sprinkled the top of the batter in each pan with some cinn & sugar, then baked for 35 min., then covered with foil and baked another 5 minutes.  Yum!  Also wanted to say that when I read people's reviews  about their loaves not baking properly, keep in mind that if you sub applesauce for the chopped apples and the oil, the batter will be very wet.  especially if you use both apples AND applesauce.  The chopped apples will release a lot of juices while baking.  I used chopped apples and the oil & had no issues with this lovely recipe!  Enjoy!

A big with all of my coworkers. I used Fugi apples instead (what I had on hand). I cut down on sugar to 1 and 1/2 cups instead of 2 cups due to sweetness of Fugi apples.

This is a wonderful recipe. I did have to cook it approximately 45 minutes longer once it was covered. The only change I made was 1.5 cups sugar and half cup of brown sugar. Yes it's sweet, but myself and the office liked it that way. More than a few times I heard "that is the best bread I've ever had!"

I made this Apple Bread and it was very good.I made some changes that is why I am giving this recipe three stars. I only used one cup of flour instead of  two because my bread would never get done in the middle.I also used one cup of sugar rather than two cups because I read one reviewer said the bread was to sweet.I will be making this recipe again because its a keeper. I made this recipe a second time this time I added some milk because it was to thick to stir.The milk keeps the bread from being so dry.The last time I made it my mother and brother said the bread was dry but it was good.

Love it!  Opted for the less sugar suggestion, and added chopped pecan and raisins.  I doubled the recipe and made 2 loaves and a 9” round (coffee cake).  Only change I’ll make next time is a little less salt.

I made muffins out of this. They were yummy but I did change the recipe. I used 1,1/2 cups of sugar. Next time I will make it with 1, 1/4C...Also will substitute brown sugar as the color was to light. They were very dense so probably will change it up more.

I cut the sugar to 1 cup and added 1/2 cup of non-sugar sweetener. It was still too sweet. I will try again with a reduced ration of sugar and non-sugar sweetener. Otherwise it was very tasty. Took longer to bake than stated.

I love this recipe because it is so versatile. I quadrupled the recipe and cut down on the sugar and oil by adding applesauce. I also put some of the apples over top before baking for a bit of a crust. A little drizzle of caramel after and this was a hit!

I only added a little more cinnamon.  Was so disappointed.  Bread was very dense, pale, sweet, and couldn't taste the cinnamon.  Looked nothing like the picture posted.  Amazing how most of the people who gave five stars did adjustments.  Would not recommend or make again.

This turned out excellent! I made a couple of small changes though; I used a cup of brown sugar in place of half the white sugar, and used a spoonful of almond extract and a spoonful of hazelnut extract in place of the vanilla. It has such a great texture! It’s the perfect combo of dense, moist and crumbly. In a house full of 6 people, this bread didn’t make it through the evening lol. Everyone loved it :)

Tastes pretty good but I like really sweet things. I ran into the same problem as other low ratings. It didn't cook all the way through. I followed the recipe exactly and the only solutions online were too much liquid. My oven is fairly new and I just cooked a pie last week that came out great, so I don't think it's a temperature or time adjustment. 45 minutes uncovered it looked done, 15 minutes covered, took it out, let it cool and imagine my surprise to cut through and see batter in the middle. Yet, the sides and bottom stuck to the greased pan. Not to mention the top cracked and sunk. I put it in for another 15 and it didn't make much difference so I gave up and have been eating it as is (see photo). Not a recipe I'll repeat, and as I'm not an intuitive baker, I always follow the recipe. If I make another apple bread I'll be trying the Breakfast Apple Bread I found on this site as it's half the sugar. (Also, note, how come the comment that says they want to strangle people hasn't been removed? I mean we are talking baking here. If it makes you that angry I think there are other issues at play. ??)

I am afraid l have to agree with Debra Lynn Gale. I made it today in my newly-calibrated oven, at the right temperature, and it was completely raw in the middle. I gave it more time, and it simply was inedible, and it sounded so good.??

I made it exactly like the directions said. Right now, I have cut it apart and have it under the broiler to try to get it to cook on the inside. Very disappointing, but tastes okay.

I made this for my church bread sale, along with some of the "Mom's Zucchini Bread" . Honestly,  I didn't try this one myself, but I was told it was very good!!!   I did however,  lick the pan after I made it, and that tasted yummy!                                         
Try it the way the recipe is written, then you can always vary the sugar, etc. to your taste! 
I found it to be a very quick and easy recipe to make, and it smells so good when it comes out of the oven!

I think this recipe has great potential but I am going to have to play with it and tweak it. For one the baking time was off for me. It was still raw in the middle after following the directions. I ended up turning the oven down to 300 and baking an additional 20-25 minutes for it to cook through. I will use different apples next time because I got an overwhelmingly sweet and cinnamon taste, but no apple flavor. I used 2 Gala apples so next time I am going to use Granny Smith and cut the sugar and cinnamon down some. All in all though it does have a super crust and when baked through has good texture. Just gotta tweak it some.

It was way too sweet.  I used 1 cup white and 1 cup brown sugar and I'll probably do 1/2 cup each next time.  I may substitute some of the oil for applesauce, but I'm afraid of it becoming too moist.  I cooked it for the time stated and I noticed that it was still undercooked.  I will keep the bread in a bit longer.  I also used 2 Granny Smith apples.

Despite being in my oven at 350 for 95 minutes, the bread never cooked through. I followed the recipe exactly,  so not sure what happened. It is EXTREMELY sweet, so if I made this bread again I would use about half the apples and half the sugar.

I made it but I put it in a preheated oven... two batches baked at 350 for 45 minutes , then covered with aluminum foil for an additional 15 minutes... tested with a toothpick.  Then took it out and it was all goo in the center.  Then put it back in for another 15 and still gooey... have now taken the foil off and cut the bread in half and put back in for another 15!  Taste good but goo what am I doing wrong??? Even split one batch into smaller pans and still got goo!

Okay, I am a decent baker.  I can follow a recipe and have been making holiday breads for the last week.  This is horrible.  I am not sure if  the liquid was left off?  Or if you should add baking soda instead of powder?  But I played it safe after reading reviews about it overflowing the pan and made up 2 smaller loaf pan with parchment paper.  I  mixed it up as per directions and it's like glue!!!! I managed to get it into pans and have baked it so far for well over an hour.  Its flat and  like glue.  What a waste of ingredients and time.  It smells good is about the nicest thing I can say.   The only thing amazing about this is the fact anyone got it to turn out right. What a MESS!

I ended up baking this during a stressful evening and didn't realize till I was in the middle of mixing ingredients that I didn't have the eggs required so the only difference to the recipe was the substitute of 1/2 cup applesauce per egg.

I really like this bread. I followed the recipe except I added ground ginger, ground nutmeg, and cake spice(penzeys). This bread is really sweet. I would suggest using only 1 cup of sugar.

My "Bread" if you want to call it that. Didn't well it didn't breaden I guess. I followed the recipe exactly and it didn't cook it just got really hot. It never became bread. I decided to try it again but halved the recipe and put it in muffin cups instead thinking it might cook better. It didn't. I am not necessarily blaming you the author, maybe I just messed up somewhere along the line, twice, in the same way. If anybody has any idea what I did wrong please let me know

This bread took forever to cook! When it was finally done  in the middle it was burnt on the bottom and stuck to the pan even with greasing it like you said!  Very disappointing!

I love this simple recipe.  I did use 1/2 brown & 1/2 white sugar though.  I also mistakenly read 2 apples instead of 2 cups. LOL.  They were large apples, so it was about 3 cups.

It was delicious. However, I did make some changes. To start with, there was no way I going to use that much sugar, so I used 1 cup and I used brown sugar instead of white. It still came out sweeter than I personally like so the next time I make it, I will either use only 1/2 cup of sugar or I will use applesauce as substitute for the sugar and for most of the oil. I actually used 1/4 cup of Olive Oil and 1/4 cup of a mixture of canola and soy oil. I also added grated nutmeg and sliced almonds (need to get rid of them). With those changes it was absolutely delicious. It does have a sort of crispy outside but inside is very soft and moist. Too sweet for breakfast but a great dessert or snack bread with coffee. Can hardly wait to make it again with less sugar to make it more suitable for breakfast. I gave it a 4 only because of the sweetness. Had I used ALL of the sugar the recipe calls for I'd have given it a 1.

Mine took an extra hour to cook! The oven was fully preheated before I started. I think the issue was, I added the leftover apple, which was maybe enough to make a third cup, which might have been the issue. Although the cooking time dramatically increased, it was still really good. I will be making this again!

Love. This. Bread. It is a little sweet so it’s not so much a breakfast but a dessert loaf. Mine cooked perfectly. I used olive oil and 2 tsp British Baking Spice instead of cinnamon. So wonderful.

So easy and so delicious! Made this recipe a little more “healthy” by using 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup applesauce; and using 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar ONLY. 2 cups of sugar would have made the bread too sweet. I also added more cinnamon for taste.

I love the bread, I use butter instead of oil.  So easy and quick to make. I leave it in 1 hour, and little larger baking dish, works better for me.  Thankyou.

Very disappointed with this recipe! The author should let us know what apples to use. I cooked according to the recipe, even an addititional 15 minutes. It still came out gooey. It was blonde in color and not the caramel brown the picture shows. I used Fuji apples. they might be too juicy for this recipe. Won't use this recipe again.

I made this and followed the directions exactly as written. When it came time to take it out of the loaf pan,,,,the top came open and the middle poured out literally. Still very raw center. I thought I'd put it back in the oven for a while longer and after almost 2 hours in total it was still quite raw in the middle.

I have tried many apple bread recipes before and baked using two yesterday (this recipe being one of those). This is by far the best!! The top comes out crunchy and stays that way even after storage. The bread has outstanding taste and texture.
I added less sugar than listed and will cut back a bit more next time.
Delish!!

Delicious and moist. Followed the recipe exactly, only added more spices and nuts...1/4 teaspoon ground cloves and 1/2 teaspoons apple pie spice along with the cinnamon. Also added a cup chopped walnuts.
A great autumn recipe.

Does not cook all the way through, so if you're planning on timing it just right, it takes WAYYYYY longer than 45 + 15 minutes. I ended up letting it cool only to have it dump out uncooked..

What an incredible recipe. My only change was adding two tablespoons of cinnamon. That is a personal preference for myself. I love bold flavors. The extra cinnamon was a perfect amount and it balanced out the recipe nicely.

This is delicious apple bread.  The changes I made were cutting the sugar from 2 cups to 1.5 and using whole wheat flour.  I also added ten minutes to bake time.  I do recommend!

Delicious! Here are the substitutions I made from looking at other reviews: replaced the sugar with rounded 2/3 cup white suger, 1/3 cup brown sugar, replaced oil with margarine, and increased cinammon to about 2 tsp. I made it into both a loaf and muffins and they both turned out great! Muffins took about 20-25 minutes and loaf took closer to 50 both at 350F. Just the right amount of sweet and moist!

I would rate this 0 stars if I could. So confused this recipe got such a high rating. I am an experienced baker and followed the recipe except for using 1 cup sugar instead of 2. Bread was inedible. Do not make.

This recipe is delicious! I doubled the recipe and made three big loaves of bread with it. I did reduce the doubled recipe by one cup of sugar because 4 total sounded scary. It still turned out great and might’ve been too sweet with 4. Definitely a make-again recipe :)

I will defiantly make again. I did not add all the sugar, only 1 1/2 cups. Next time will probably only do 1 cup of sugar. I also made these as muffins. It made 12 over filled muffins.

Mine turned out awesome, but I did make some changes. First of all I used half a cup each of white and brown sugars, totaling one cup instead of two. It turned out plenty sweet and I think 2 cups would have been way too sweet. I also used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil and used a heaping teaspoon of cinnamon. Before covering with foil, I brushed the top with a mixture of butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon to give the top a nice sweet crunchy crust

Wow!! This is some breakfast!  As normal for me, I made a very few changes, mainly to technique.  I put three granny smith apples in my blender with the oil, and chopped them that way.  Not really smooth, but a little chunky.  Doubled the recipe but cut the sugar back by 25%, since we don't like really sweet things, except my husband.  He is really sweet.  A double recipe got me three mini loaves, over which I sprinkled poppy seeds for crunch and a bit of extra flavor.  Even the dough was tasty.  Try this.  I will be making this many times in the future.  Muffins.  Mini-muffins, breads, mmmmmmmmmmm.

This loaf wasn't what I expected.  Maybe because I cut the apples into bigger chunks.  It was a bit to moist, and not enough flavor.

I cooked it for the time said, and I had to cook for another half hour; making it a total of an hour and a half! Even then the inside was still too "gooey", but the outside was too hard! Also, the picture looks a bit different than how it turned out. It's  a shame because it did taste good, so I at least gave it 2 stars. In the future, I will try using Amish Cinnamon Bread recipe (Tess Cooks 4u on YouTube) and adding apples to it.

An excellent dessert bread, but it does not want to cook in the middle even with added time. I also made a tray of muffins since I have a smaller loaf pan and those turned out amazing; they were done after about 25 minutes. I added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and 1/2 cup of raisins to the recipe for extra flavor. The crunchy top of this bread is the real seller on this.

I used half all purpose and half whole wheat flour. I also used only 1 cup of sugar instead of two cups. It came out great.

I had the same problem as another reviewer, it just would not cook through. I cooked it as long as I could, checking every few minutes, finally removing when outside was VERY dark brown, but center was not cooked enough to eat. I had to throw it away. :(

Served this to some VIP guests and they raved about it.  It was heavenly and I will definitely make this again and again.  I do agree, though, that it takes a LOT longer to bake than stated.  Maybe due to the density.  I baked it for 1 hr 45 minutes and then it was finally done.  Used Granny Smith apples, and only 1 1/2 cups sugar and it was perfect.  BE SURE to oil and flour your pan - half of my bread got stuck and turned into crumbles.  That was the part my family ate and they did not complain at all because it tasted AMAZING.

Made it twice -- absolutely the best!  I doubled the recipe, but reduced both the sugar and oil by about 1/3 each.  And I added about a cup of chopped walnuts.  It's SO good -- a kind of sweet, crispy crust, melt in your mouth interior.  This is a keeper -- I may never buy bananas again!

I'm sure this recipe is delicious, unfortunately the directions are .  I cooked this bread for over 1 hour and it came out like soup.  I used up all those ingredients and ended up having to throw it all away because it was unedible.

I made changes per other reviewer's. I always hate when review make a ton of changes to a recipe and it doesn't even resemble the person's recipe. But I knew what I wanted to make and this recipe kind of fit the bill but I knew it would not be to my taste. So I hope that others will find this helpful. I used 2 cups of chopped and small diced apples plus I cooked apples in butter in a frying pan and added those. In total I used three small apples diced (2cups) and then an additional three small apples fried and brown (equaled 1/2 cup cooked).  I only used one cup of sugar splitting it brown and white. I added one banana and cut the oil to 1/4 cup. I would have used applesauce instead if oil/bannana but I didn't have it.  I used less salt; 1/2 teaspoon. I used more cinnamon; 1 tablespoon. I sprinkled  a small amount of brown and white sugar on the top so it would brown and get crunchy.  I used reusable parchment paper since people said it stuck to the pan.  I cooked it on 350° for a total of 70 minutes and I did NOT cover it. FYI - I make a very thick and dense banana bread which is similar to this and needs an hour of cooking. So don't be afraid to cook it longer!!  I checked it at 50 minutes it was not brown on top and still very mushy in the middle. At 65 minutes it was almost done but I gave it another five minutes more. Hopefully it's not over done and dry. After 10 minutes, it came off of the parchment paper beautifully without sticking.  It looks delicious and it's perfe

Listen, Im not a master at baking, but I can follow a recipe well- and I don't know what happened with this bread. It was baked beautifully on the outside, but complete goo on the inside. I baked it for another 15 mins, still goo. Another 10 mins, same thing. It would not come together, and stayed wet. 
Maybe the apples gave off too much moisture? It's too bad, because the smell was amazing and the batter was very tasty.

Very good bread after a few changes!  I used only 1 cup of sugar (half brown, half white sugar), applesauce instead of oil, only 1/2 tsp of salt, double the cinnamon, a little extra vanilla, and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg.  Yum!

My boy friend really likes this. Based on reviews I made some adjustments. 
2 1/2 cup apples (shredded, diced, & thin slices)
1 tbsp cinnamon
Juice from 1/2 lemon on apples prior to adding in wet ingredients  & lemon zest in dry ingredients 
1/4 tbsp cloves
1/2 cup white sugar & 1/2 cup brown sugar
4 oz apple sauce & 1/4 cup oil
Followed time in oven as called for & it was cooked perfectly

Really delicious.  Used raw cane sugar - 1 and 1/4 cups.   Added some milk because batter was super thick.  Also added chopped walnuts.  Baked at 350 for 40 min, then covered and turned up the heat to 375 for another 20 minutes. It was just done, but left in the oven for about 15 minutes after turning it off.   Crispy outside, moist inside.  Next day a bit mushy and more moist, but still very tasty.

I would bake it unwrapped next time and I needed over hour and a half for it to be fully cooked.  I also replaced the 1/2 cup oil with 1/2 cup apple sauce for extra apple-ness.

It should be called apple bread PUDDING and then we are fine. It took me double the time to cook it and it has the consistency of a bread pudding. Good taste for a bread pudding.

This is a wonderfully moist bread with a slightly crispy crust, and a really good flavor.  I think the apples I used might have been Macintosh, but not sure. I reduced the sugar to one and a half cup, added  a little lemon and nutmeg and used a full tsp of cinnamon.  I don't know if these changes made it any better than the original, but it sure was good!  I also added a tsp of soda.  I used two smaller pans, since I often find that bread will cook too much on the outside and leave the inside undercooked with a larger pan.  I will be making this again, and maybe try it with zucchini.

I have made this 5 times now and each time I am actually amazed at how delicious this is. It is pretty easy to make. I use whatever apples I have on hand. The only thing I have had to do is increase baking to 1 1/2 hours. It comes out perfectly and it is a wonderful treat for the whole family. I am making a loaf today for a family reunion!

Note: Make sure your bread pan is greased well. Let bread really cool so it will come out of the pan easier. I put double cinnamon, a personal fave.

Made this for the first time today, took it to a pot luck gathering.  EVERYONE raved about it and wanted the recipe, even the men. I used frozen apples from the store, thawed them a bit, then diced them.  Turned out perfectly.  I used 4 mini pans, and baked a little shorter time.

First, as followed was a powdery mess. Not dough or anything like. Had to add applesauce to fix. Second, if you live at 6700ft it takes appx twice as long to bake. Yes high alt requires adjustments but how about listing them? Don't exclude us folks, we bake (or learning to bake) too. ??

Love this recipe! It produced a somewhat dense, very moist bread, just what I was looking for. I used sweet apples, so added only half the amount of sugar called for, and it came out perfectly sweet when drizzled with a powdered sugar/lemon juice glaze.

Love that the recipe is so quick and simple and that all the ingredients are cheap pantry staples! Next I'm going to try it with blueberries in place of the apples. This will be my go-to basic quick bread recipe from here on out. Thanks!

I made this with one apple and one banana, chocolate chips,  and walnuts.
I made cupcakes and even though they stuck to their holes, they tasted moist and great. But had to take them out of the pan with a knife.

I thought it was very good. Very moist and dense, as the others have said. I made a few changes tho. I cut the sugar in half, using both white and brown. I also used 1/2 cup cinnamon applesauce in place of the oil. Followed the cooking directions and it came out perfect. I will make again many times.

As another poster said, it won't cook through.  I left it in the oven for an hour and a half and it's still not cooked in the center.  Also it's wayyyyy too sweet.  I was really craving apple bread or cake and this is a major disappointment.

I made adjustments based on other reviews.   I used 1 1/2 c white sugar and 1/2 c brown sugar.   Also, I chose to use three large Granny Smith apples chopped fine (in food processor) with a little lemon juice to prevent browning.   Additionally, I made a streusel topping with 1/2 c brown sugar, 1/2 c self-rising flour, and 4 tablespoons butter and added it on top during last 5-10 min of cooking time.   Turned out fabulous!   Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This recipe is overly sweet, and the cooking time was way off. I had to bake this bread for about 90 minutes for it to get even close to done. As it is, we are toasting slices just so they are not mushy. Next time I'll reduce the sugar by a half cup and substitute half brown sugar.

I'd make this again. I did double the cinnamon as we love cinnamon.  I also cooked it in a muffin tin lined with cupcake papers. I didn't peel the apples, and I used 3 golden delicious, amounting to 3 cups of apples, loosely. The top has a lovely crispy crust and the bottom is moist without being doughy or heavy. When the muffins were about half cooked, I sprinkled a little cinnamon sugar on them, then finished.

I made some modifications to better suit my personal preference taste and texture-wise.  Also to cater to a finger food party, I made these into muffins instead of a loaf.

 ADJUSTMENTS:

– Servings:  13 medium/large-sized muffins

–  Total bake time in a muffin tin:  35-40 minutes @ 350F

–  In addition to all listed ingredients, I also included:
*  1 cup of dark chocolate morsels
* 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts
*  1/2 cup of chopped pecans
* sprinkling of brown sugar to top each muffin

This is an excellent bread. It goes together quickly and uses ingredients in most pantries.  I followed the recipe with the exception of reducing the  overall amount of sugar and substituting half of the white for brown sugar.  I also increased the amount of cinnamon and added a dash of nutmeg. The loaf turned out dense and moist and the apples provide lovely fruitiness.  The flavors of the spices and apples blended perfectly. As with all baking, don't follow the recipe baking time guidelines exactly, you'll need to start checking the bread a bit early, after about 30 minutes, and monitor until done. I added about 7 minutes to my time and I ended up with a loaf that was medium golden brown with a top crust that had a bit of a crunch without being dry. The big guy gave this bread a big thumbs up so I'll be making it again.  The addition of nuts and/or raisins would be wonderful.  IDEA:  Now in thinking about additions, it's occurred to me that cinnamon red hot candies would be amazing in this bread!  I'll definitely be trying that variation!

This was one of the most delicious things I have ever made or tasted. I read some of the  other reviews and also adjusted this recipe slightly by using 1 1/2 cups of sugar and 1 tsp cinnamon, and I thought it was just perfect. This was a huge hit in my house and also among my coworkers. I made 2 smaller loaves rather than one big  one, so cook time was about 40-45 minutes. I also used honeycrisp apples. I definitely recommend this recipe!

This was such a hit! Everyone who has tried it absolutely loves it :) a friend of mine said it was like sweet bread and apple pie had a baby together. The only change I've made is that I double the amount of cinnamon/apple pie spice, and I switched out all the oil with unsweetened applesauce. Letting it sit a day also allows the flavors to settle and develop too. I've made it several times now!

Delicious!  I decreased the sugar significantly by using 1 cup of brown sugar, used 1/2 cup of melted butter for the fat and added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon each of nutmeg and allspice.  I lined the loaf pan with parchment paper and had no problems removing the bread from the pan in one piece.  This recipe is a great way to use apples that a little past their prime.

I needed to use up some aging apples.  I used two Granny Smith and half a Gala, cut into smallish pieces, skins on.  

Like others have said, a dense and moist bread/cake.  As per some reviews I cut the sugar in half, and it was still sweet enough.  I was out of cinnamon, but it was fine without it.  I was generous with the vanilla. I would have used some brown sugar but I was out.  

Maybe I used too much apple, and went a bit light on the (grape seed) oil ( I thought I should since I used less sugar), so I had trouble trouble stirring the flour mixture in.  So I added a dribble of 1% milk, with no ill effects.  

I cooked it for the 45 minutes, plus 15 under foil, plus another 10 just in case. It cooked through nicely.  It came out of my well oiled pan with no effort.  I sprayed the pan before preparing the batter, as per the recipe, and so there was a thin coating on the sides and more on the bottom.  I think that's why it slipped out effortlessly.

I ate it warm with some salted butter, and warm with some Limoncello drizzled on top, and it tasted good both ways.

This is so delicious.  I did change a little.  I used a tart apple and used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar.  Added a little more vanilla.  It stuck to my very well greased pan, so next time I will use a greased tin foil pan.  I did cook it for an additional 20 minutes with the tin foil on as it wasn't done.  But omg it is so delicious.  I will definetly make it again

I made this and put it in two smaller pans. Didn't seem to want to get done (and I even put it back in for a few extra minutes)  Wouldn't even come out of the greased pan!! I guess I'll serve it with ice cream as apple crisp!  lol

I've made this recipe a half dozen times and it always comes out great. It's very forgiving. Sometimes I accidentally put the alumn foil on for the initial 45 min, then keep it off for the final 15 min, OR I have to bake it for more or less time. It's always firm on the outside and moist on the inside. Yesterday I substituted persimmons for apples because, well, my apple tree is now dormant but my persimmons tree is off the hook. Had to cook the dish for an extra 15 minutes but mmmm, it is equally delish as always.

I probably will make it again. Easy with good results.  I reduced the sugar by one third--apples are plenty sweet.  I also leave the peels on my apples. Complemented nicely by ice cream.

I made this using 3 apples, and replaced 1 cup of white sugar with brown sugar and also doubled the cinnamon. It was delicious. However, my loaves are very thin (an inch and a half tall if I were to guess) and was wondering how well it would cook through if I just made the full recipe into one loaf instead of two.

This bread is very good, but salty!  I am about to bake for the second time and I will be reducing the salt significantly.  I used a wide variety of fresh-picked Virginia apples.  Bread is delicious.   Just slice and eat!

Wonderful! I have never had a loaf of bread turn out with such a beautiful consistency.  The taste was so good.  And the top was perfect.  I may try it in muffins tins to see if it turns out as well.  Thanks sharing!

It's amazing.  It's a sweet bread, more like desert than something you'd eat for breakfast.  I doubled the recipe and substituted brown sugar for 1/4 of the white sugar.  Also added more cinnamon and some nutmeg.  Really good stuff.

I have made this bread 3 times already and have tripled the recipe as well. I have been asked to make this again over and over and it's the best. The only thing I did differently was the bake time. I baked for an initial 50 minutes then covered with aluminum and baked another 15-20 minutes. It was perfect each time.

Delicious apple bread recipe, thank you for sharing.  I made the following modifications: substituted butter for oil, decreased sugar to 1.5 cups, increased vanilla to 1 tablespoon, increased cinnamon to 1 teaspoon, added 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice, added a handful of chocolate chips.  Also, I used 2 large apples which I think is more than 2 cups of chopped apple.  I had to bake this for at least 30 minutes longer than what the recipe says.  But it was well worth the wait!

Yes, quite enjoyed it... added raisons and 1 tsp. finely chopped candied ginger...it's texture/taste reminds me of blonde brownies.
TIP ..I had no trouble getting it out of my baking pan, I used a greased silicone baking loaf pan, it just popped out.

This is delicious but it's too much batter for one loaf pan. I cooked mine in a bundt pan and it was just right.  I also cut back on some sugar like the other reviews  suggested

Great recipe! I made mine using all purpose gluten free flour and it turned out more of a pudding texture, though it was deliciously caramelly (lots of sugar) and it disappeared fast. Also, it didn't fit in a normal sized loaf tin for me, it overflowed by a lot, so I would recommend using a larger square tin if you are using gluten free flour as I did. It's fine to use normal apples not baking ones, the ones I had were also a bit old but it came out well.

Wonderful, very moist.  Used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown. Also turned off oven after 45 minutes as another reviewer suggest and left in oven for 45 minutes.

I loved this so much.  I made a few modifications.  I doubled the cinnamon. I added a teaspoon of baking soda. I only used a cup of apples and I cup of white Sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar. I also mixed the wet ingredients and then added the dry Ingredients after that I added the diced apples. It turned out wonderful.  Yummmmm...I almost ate half of it. My husband ate the rest. It did not last half a day. Nice crust and so moist. This is so delicious!

Absolutely delicious! So dense and moist on the inside, and a nice crunch to the outside -- Mmmm! I used Gala apples in mine and may experiment with other kinds! A few changes I made was adding lemon juice to the apples and then some lemon zest to the batter. Also, 2 cups of sugar sounded way too sweet for my liking, so I only did 1 cup of white sugar and then 1/2 a cup of brown sugar - although next time I may just do half a cup of each! Thank you so much for sharing this yummy treat!

Best ever! I used a full tsp cinnamon, cut sugar down to 1  1/4 cups, and added more apples . Was still sweet and delicious. We could eat this dessert bread in one sitting!

I would have given this 4 stars because the bread was still slightly too sweet after I reduced the amount of sugar to about 1 1/2 C, but between my two toddlers, my husband, and I, the loaf is almost gone in less than a day! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Made this today. Batter was very very thick and bread turned out like a brick. Tasted it....tossed it. I must have done something wrong.

Great recipe.  I needed a way to get rid of extra apples and this was the ticket.  I have made 4 loafs so far and am planning on sending more out as Christmas gifts.  I did switch from white to brown sugar and cut down the amount by about 3 Tablespoons (my husbands suggestion--did this on the second loaf and we liked it better).  Used 2-1/2 cups of apples as well.

This is a new favorite in our house! It is so good! Very moist and the edges and top get just a little crispy.

Like other reviews cut the salt back to 3/4 tsp.  Also added a dash of nutmeg...for my taste.  It is a good moist bread with and nice crust.  Will definitely make often because it is so very easy to put together.
