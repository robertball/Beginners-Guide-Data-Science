Not a bad start, and kind of boring as is, but my additions took this over the top to something truly magnificent! I made the sandwiches on "Bread Machine Focaccia," also from this site. I rubbed the chicken breasts with olive oil, and seasoned them with salt, pepper, and Montreal Chicken Seasoning.  I didn't saute them in a skillet, prefering instead to grill them. I also built a "deluxe" version of this sandwich by adding bacon, Romaine lettuce, and sliced tomato. It was out of this world delicious and, paired with "Rachel's Tomato Basil Soup," was a picture perfect summer meal.

This was absolutely delicious.  A couple of notations I might add.  I used lowfat mayo and it had plenty of flavor.  Also I grilled some red pepper and red onions in butter in a separate pan and added it on top of the chicken.  For the size bread I had there was only enough spread for 2 sandwiches.  I would recommend doubling the spread.  We will use this often.

FABULOUS! My husband, four kids, and I just loved this sandwich. I quadrupled the dressing - it is just great and will work well on other foods. I topped the sandwiches with roasted red peppers, leaf lettuce, and sliced tomato. Also used a Rosemary Focaccia. My family wants this again tomorrow night for supper! Thanks so much! I cannot say enough good things about this recipe - but I suggest the roasted red peppers and also make extra dressing.

Quick and very tasty!  I cooked my chicken on my George Foreman for 5 minutes and threw all the ingredients for the spread in my mini food processor-it took no longer than 10 minutes from start to finish.

Awesome sandwich! I used some leftover italian herb grilled chicken I had on hand.  All I need to add was some roasted red peppers and some cheese. My husband added a bit of bacon to his of course! This was perfect for a quick and easy meal.

I made this sandwich for a party and people talked about it for weeks.  I bought the foccia bread at Panera Bread and sliced in half so I had two large rounds, then added the lettuce, chicken and sauce.  Best to slice your chicken thin. It was outstanding!

I made my own bread for this- not a focaccia, but a nice french peasant bread. I split it, spread a garlic/rosemary/dill butter on the inside and toasted it... Terrific. I will _try_ it with the foccacia next, just on the off chance, but I cannot see how it could taste better...

One comment; the quality of the mustard is very important. The Dijon is the bare _minimum_. I ended up using Pommery, which is a stone ground French mustard. Very, very grainy and thick. 

Worked so well that I started fantasizing about starting a restaurant so that I could serve this sanddwich.

I left out the bread and just had the chicken with the spread on top, with some veggies on the side and it made a great dinner.

Good eats.  I used Dijonnaise and just added rosemary to that (hey, I'm all about ease over here).  I also used perdue thin cuts (thinly cut chicken breast) to save time in the "pounding" area.  I used the "easy focaccia" bread recipe from this site (with garlic added) and set out other condiments as in; tomato slices, romain lettuce, sliced red onion, etc. so everyone could create their own.  Thanks Lisa!

EXCELLENT! Upon getting home late tonight and not wanting to really "cook" this was great!! I doubled the sauce (as others suggested), added a DASH of dill/garlic powder. I didn't have (nor could I find) rosemary foccica bread...just "plain" focciacia worked great for us.  Added a leaf of lettuce and a slice of deli colby jack cheese....mmmmmmmmmm. Easy AND delicious! What a great combination!!

I made this for a dinner party - couldn't find foccacia; substituted pumpernickel and rye. Created make your own - served w/lettuce, roasted red peppers, red onions and cheese - great hit. Made chicken ahead of time & heated up in oven for 20 minutes before serving. Very easy - would definately make again - but use sliced jack cheese.

A simple recipe, though some may find it a bit bland.  I topped my sandwiches with sauteed sweet onions and Swiss cheese.  The addition of rosemary to the mayo/mustard spread is genius!  I was disappointed that my purchased focaccia was moldy, so I had to serve the sandwiches on hamburger buns that I had on hand.  I had planned to grill the chicken, but a thunderstorm forced me to saute them on the stovetop.  I sprinkled the chicken lightly with Greek seasoning prior to cooking.  A quick and easy weeknight recipe!

These are really good and easy to prepare.  Having fresh rosemary enhances the dressing as you would expect any time you use fresh herbs.

Delicious! Everyone loved this and I cannot wait to make it again. I didn't have any focaccia bread available so I used refrigerated crescent roll dough (two triangles together to look like a square) to make the bread portion. I sprinkled powdered garlic and dried rosemary on top. I think this would be great for a gourmet picnic or served alongside a pasta salad. Thank you!

This is a very good sandwich.  It is quick and easy to prepare plus it tastes delicious.  Next time I make this, I am going to add tomato slices, romaine lettuce, and shredded mozzerella.  I'll toast the mozzerella, chicken and bread under the broiler and then add my veggies.  Even though this sandwich could be served hot or cold, it loses some of its flavor as its cools.

I loved this recipe, it was so good. My husband said it was a very good "quiznos" sandwich. I toasted the sandwich before serving under the broiler. It turned out to be a hit with the family.

This sandwich was great! Not overpowering and very filling. I served my chicken cold, and used the recipe for "bread machine focaccia".

Very yummy! I bought a prebaked foccacia from Panera and used it. Next time I think I will double the amount for the spread as I couldn't taste it much once the sandwich was made. I did add roma tomato slices and mozzarella cheese slices and baked in the oven long enough to melt the cheese. It was very good warmed up the next day also!

This recipe rocks!

Although I did modify it a little,  I marinated the chicken in the olive oil and rosemary for an hour.  and then barbequed the chicken. 
 I still used the mayo/mustard/rosemary spread on the focaccia bread. everyone loved the recipe. I had a party and did this for the main dish, I had cut up tomatoes, greens available.

WOW.  This was a FABULOUS sandwich!!!!  My husband said that we could definately fool guests--they would think it was ordered out from a nice restaurant!  I used ALOT of pepper (covered both sides of the chicken breasts which added a lot of flavor) and let both sides get dark and crunchy (a just grilled kind of texture).  I served the chicken hot which was a fabulous combindation with the room temperature focaccia and cold, crisp lettuce I added to the top of the chicken.  To make the dish look more gourmet and appealing, I served the  sandwich open-faced on a large, green leaf of romaine lettuce, added a bright yellow ear of corn, and some sliced tomatoes.  Looked beautiful but tasted even better!

Delicious! I like to add a few slices of tomato and some baby spinach leaves for a great sandwich all around. You could also use turkey instead of chicken. Very good.

This is an absolutely fabulous recipe!  I am now addicted to it and will be going broke buying piles of chicken breasts from now on!  It is a little messy though, so not terribly kid friendly.

Absolutely delicious.  Husband loved this and I thought it was wonderful as well.  Very easy to make and the taste is amazing.  I did add some sauted onions and lettuce as a personal preference and the hubby wanted cheese, so you can change this up to suit your personal tastes and it still is wonderul.  Thank you for the post.

This was very good! Per other reviewers' suggestions I added romaine lettuce and tomatoes. I also ended up cooking the chicken in rosemary, instead of putting the rosemary in the spread, and it was excellent that way.

The spread is what makeks this sandwich so tasty.  The recipe makes more than you will probably put on the sandwiches, but offer the additional to your guests because they will probably want it.

The thinner you can pound the chicken, the better.  Like others recommended, I doubled the sauce ingredients and it was just enough for 4 sandwiches.  As I could not find the focaccia bread, I used Oroweat Country potato bread.  I would love to try it with the garlic rosemary focaccia bread.  Next time I think I will try a slice of provolone cheese on the chicken breast as soon as it comes out of the skillet.

This is a really good sandwich & not difficult to make, nor time consuming. I placed a sheet of plastic wrap over chicken breast before 'wacking' it with a meat tenderizer...  Thanks Lisa!

This is a great base chicken sandwich to add whatever you like too!  Let me tell you that sauce is so good!  On mine I did a Mediterranean cheddar, tomatoes, onions and a slaw I threw together.  It was messy but worth it!  Thanks!

This was a great sandwich. I used deli sliced chicken and just sauteed it really quick with the garlic and cracked black pepper in some warm olive oil for flavor then assembled as directed. My son was hesitant to try the rosemary but I talked him into letting me use crushed rosemary and he ended up liking this sandwich as it is. I used a sub sandwich roll since I didn't have the focaccia. Very good, thanks.

This was fantastic and we will make this again and again. Only problem I had is I could not find focaccia bread and I am not a big baker. I used Cabata bread instead and it turned out great. 

The seasonings in the mayo made this recipe and for a touch of spice I added some horseradish.

Great!  My husband and I both loved these.  I didn't have time to make the bread, so I put slices of our normal homemade white bread on a cookie sheet, sprayed them lightly with canola oil, sprinkled with garlic and rosemary and lightly broiled them.

Great sandwich! I normally don't like chicken on my sandwiches (except thinly sliced chicken) but this was really good! I used crushed dried rosemary instead of fresh.

The spread for this was great. However the bread I used wasn't. It was some grocery store cheese bread. I will have to make this again with the focaccia bread (I searced 3 grocery stores for it but couldn't find any). I think the spread would be great with fish.

I made this recipe for my mother and family the day i returned from college on Mother's Day. It was easy so it didn't require much pre-planning, and everyone absolutely loved it.  A really good focaccia bread is key for them to turn out well.

Yummmmm. Awesome chicken sandwich. I marinated the breasts in a garlic marinade then cooked them on the grill instead of frying them. My family looked at me like I had two heads when I served the chicken on the foccacia instead of rolls like I usually do, but they changed their tune once they had a taste. Thanks so much for the recipe!

This sandwich is fantastic!  I doubled the sauce, and used a packaged mix for the focaccia bread, which I made with the dough cycle of my bread machine. Simple and easy!  Loved it and have added it to my favorites. Thank you!

Absolutely FABULOUS!!!!!  I did take another persons suggestion and doubled the dressing and added lettuce to the sandwich.  We had this sandwich for dinner two nights in a row at my picky husband's request.  I was fortunate to have been at the bakery just as the focaccia was coming out of the oven.  Thanks, Lisa, for a recipe that will be used over and over again in this household.

this sandwich was pretty good. it was a liitle too much work i thought. pounding the chicken was the worst part of it all. make sure you buy the thinnest slice of chicken breast meat you can find to make it easier and quicker.

WOW! Made it with focaccia from TFM; added fresh spinach under chicken; roasted red pepper strips and provolone cheese over chicken. Ran under broiler before topping sandwich with bread just long enough to melt cheese. YUM!

Delicious! I broiled the foccasia with jalepeno havarti then put a layer of spinach under the chicken. I also used a garlic grain mustard as i was out of dijon. 
Will be a go to sandwich on a lazy day!

this was great! for the sauce, i added a few more things into it. i added sage and some parsley into it, as well as fresh lemon juice to give even out the spicy dijon mustard. i also added lettuce and tomatoes so there wasnt just chicken and bread. the chicken was grilled instead of sauteed and i waited for it to cool down

i made these with the "creamy lemon chicken soup" by taste of home on this site. these were really good. unfortunately my focaccia bread molded before i could use it so i just used flatbread (which i had on hand). they turned out really good. my hubby hates mayo but actually loved the sauce! next time i'll probably try adding different herbs.

I write reviews to remind me what my family said about the food I cook.   My brother, who was over at the time, said it tasted like a Jack in the box chicken sandwich, but better.   Hubby, who doesn't like mayo too much, said it was good.   I would make this again.

I'm fixing this for a second time...says something about it being pretty darn good. For a change I fixed this simple recipe without adjusting ingredients. They made really good cold sandwichs as leftovers.  I used regular foccaccia bread and chicken tenders.  I'll probably pound the tenders a little this time...fill the bread better. I like the idea of a slice of bacon or cheese and rubbing the chicken with any seasoning of choice. I use Smart Balance mayo and extra garlic.

This is a great chicken sandwich. I bought chicken scallopini already flattened at the grocery store, and sauteed it along with the garlic in olive oil.  It only took 5 minutes on each side. I also covered plain focaccia with olive oil for salads and dressings and sprinkled with rosemary, and put it under the broiler until toasted. I then laid the chicken cutlets on top of the bread and added roasted red peppers on top, left the top slice of focaccia off and served open faced.  Served with a simple salad. It was amazing.

My husband and I loved this. It tasted like a gourmet sandwich you would get at a restaurant. I bought the foccacia bread at our grocer's bakery. Next time I will try Panera's. I'm going to try this for the kids. Dont know if they'll go for it or not.

I thought these sandwiches were terrific!  I made some changes, I grilled the chicken and served it on asiago cheese bread, but I left the spread the same.  It was so good...I could have just had it on the bread, minus the chicken!  Also, served these sandwiches with homegrown tomatoes and avocado slices.  Delicious!

Followed the recipe pretty closely. substituted the foccacia for some kalamata olive boule bread (because that is what I had on hand)and toasted it in a pan first. I used more of the dressing and added thin slices of cheddar and seeded tomato slices. I heated up the open faced sandwich under the broiler. Very good, will try again. Thanks for the recipe.

Really great sandwich.  I didn't saute my chicken 12-15 minutes, it was only 1/4 inch thick, that takes maybe five minutes max.  I thought the sandwich could've used something more, tomatoes or spinach or cheese, but as it was I still liked it very much.

it's a very simple sandwich, but it tastes great!  the spread is DELICIOUS!  i added fresh grated parmesan cheese, and i think next time i'll have to add lettuce and tomatoes.

Tasty, easy sandwich recipe. The sauce is the best part. I turned the chicken over and cook both sides, to make sure it was cooked all the way through. I added cheese, lettuce and grilled onions... You can also add a dash of seasoning salt if you have it. The foccacia bread is great warmed too. Yum.

I didn't care too much for the dressings on the sandwich.  I thought it was too much flavor going on all at once with the bread and the dressing.  I didn't think it was tasty, but everyone else liked it okay.  It wasn't a huge hit.  I won't be making this again.

Loved this!  I had leftover chicken thighs already cooked, so I just warmed those up and used them.  The focaccia I used had plenty of garlic in it, and the spread was perfectly sweet/tangy.  I used creamy dijonaise as that's all I had for mustard, and added honey til it tasted just right. Will be making this many times as summer comes and we want a warm but not hot meal.

I made this for my husband when he came home from work.  He thought he had done something awfully good to deserve this sandwich!!!  I bought the bread, but I saw a mix for it in the bread machine box aisle.  I think I'll try making my own next time.  VERY GOOD!

My family really enjoyed the mayo/dijon spread.  I enhanced it by adding some garlic powder and a tiny bit of cayenne just for flavor, not for heat.  We wanted to grill the chicken, so I felt like just peppering it wouldn't give it enough flavor.  I marinated it for a half hour in the marinade recipe from 'Marinated Chicken Pita Sandwich' also on this website which was yummy.

Similar to one I've made except with addition of finely chopped celery, and green onion to taste, plus the addition of 1 teaspoon sour cream mixed with the mayo and mustard.  The crowning glory is roasted slivered almonds, 1/8 to 1/4 cup.  Mix in the chicken with all ingredients and then spread on rolls or bread. This came from a popular caterer in our area.

This was a good base recipe for a tasty chicken sandwich! Next time, I will make witha few additions.  First, I will definitely make more of the mayo/mustard spread. Second, i would a a few toppings like baby spinach leaves and finely sliced red onion. Get creative and add even more like roasted red peppers!

I made this as directed combining it with the "Bread Machine Focaccia" from this site (which I HIGHLY recommend). Delicious! I added romaine, tomato, and sauteed red onion. The dressing/spread is excellent, but I think next time I'll season the chicken more, perhaps marinate it in something. A slice of bacon wouldn't hurt either.

Amazing!!! Used fat free mayo, which still tasted delicious. I followed some of the other comments by using a roasted red pepper/red onion topping, and it was a great addition. Also used an asiago cheese bread, which worked well.

Yummy!  My husband and I had these sandwiches for dinner last night, and we both loved them.  I sliced the chicken breasts in half horizontally, so they were thinner and grilled up quickly.  I also doubled the spread.  We'll definitely have these again.  Thanks, LCLARKE!

My husband and I were both dubious over how such a simple thing might be so very special. But the combination of flavors was amazing.  Even when I tried it a second time at first we still thought we had to have been mistaken at believing it would taste so good, but surprise, it really was that good.

I have never been a fan of the chicken sandwich, but I gobbled this one up! I used tomato basil foccacia bread instead and it was wonderful! I didn't have any fresh rosemary and I used dried, which was not good.  Just leave out the rosemary if you don't have fresh...

Good, but next time I'll add less rosemary. Maybe I'll try a different herb since hubby isn't to crazy about rosemary...that being said, it was nice having something aside from the ordinary.

I should have left the original recipe alone.  It would have bee perfect. I marineated the chicken in olive oil and fresh rosemary as another reviewer had suggested and it was too much rosemary.

I thought this Sandwich was awesome!
I used Parmesan Focaccia Bread instead, Only because Price Chopper didnt have the other. But either way this was Very Easy to make and the Mayo and Mustard Go very very good together, I will be making this again! :o)

Didn't think this was great.  I used romaine lettuce, a thick tomato slice, and thinly sliced onion, and still didn't like it.  The rosemary was a bit too strong I think - plus I think the bread I used didn't help.  I made the Easy Foccaccia and added garlic and rosemary to it - maybe that's why?  Anyway, I chopped up the chicken breasts and made caesar wraps out of it from another recipe on this site - they are great (eating one right now) so all is not lost.

Easy & pretty darn good!  The chicken was extremely flavorful & the sauce a hit.  I made this for a lunch with friends and added spinach lettuce with coleslaw as a side and fresh fruit for desert.  Delicious light lunch and easy to prepare in advance!

Very good.  I cooked chicken med/high for about 4 minutes each side, let rest for 5 minutes.  I used Scali bread instead and added a little bit of lemon and green onions to the mayonaisse mixture.  I shredded some lettuce and cut thinly sliced cucumbers and this came out fantastic.  My Nephew who is a very picky eater said "mmm, I like this".

Nice sandwich Lisa.  I had to serve this on ciabatta bread since that's what hubby brought back from the bakery.  We liked the spread, so I would use it again on future sandwiches.  Thanks for sharing.

I liked this recipie, but it wasn't anything amazing.  my bakery didn't have focaccia bread, so I used a roasted garlic loaf.  We had our sandwiches warm.  It was quick it was easy, but nothing to wow about.

it was good! i didn't have any rosemary or special bread, so i substituted with parsley and regular sliced bread and it turned out tasty! my only qualm was that the chicken and sauce was a little too moist for my bread and made it soggy, so i would stick with fancy bread.

So good for something that’s this easy and quick to make. I didn’t have focaccia bread, so I served it on thick slices of home made challah.  Delicious!

Was bored and gave this a try. I couldn’t find rosemary bread so I used Onion Rye (personal favorite). Does taste like a gourmet deli sandwich. 10/10 will do again

I thought it was really good! The sauce is what did it. It was just enough. The only thing I did differently is cook boneless, skinless thighs , because I had them on hand. I ate it on ciabatta buns. I browned the buns on the same black skillet I used to cook the chicken in. I will make this meal again.

My family loves sandwiches so i decided to try this one.   When i make somthing new I always ask what i could do to make it better next time.  My husband relpy was "use a different recipe."  I thought it was passable, but everyone else thought it was too dry and boring.

Smart Cookys will recognize this as a great way to be prepared for those days you don't feel like doing a 3 course meal, or are just too busy.  This is so much better than picking up Pizza or greasy fried chicken!

I've been using this recipe for years and am just now getting around to rating it ~ this is awesome! My family LOVES this sandwich and they request it often! I do make extra sauce for those who like extra. I highly recommend this recipe. It's one my favorites from AR.

This was wonderful.  My whole family liked it.  Even the kids (ages 6, 8 and 11).  We had it warm and added sliced tomato and lettuce to the top of the chicken once it was cooked.  I used Homemade Focaccia Bread from this site for the bread.

This was the best sandwich I have had in ages.  The rosemary made the dressing, so don't leave it out.  You can also add cheese and bacon.  Excellent.

One for the recipe box.  Effortless, with good results.  My finicky husband enjoyed it commenting, "very tasty but too minimalistic, needs some sort of vegetable added".  Next I'll have to try it with sauteed red peppers and lettuce as TheeArtisticOne suggested.

LOVE IT! This recipe is amazing and honestly quite quick! I used dry rosemary rather than fresh and I soaked it in water for about 10-15 min to bring out more of that amazing flavor. I also added some sauteed red peppers w/garlic, some fresh lettuce/arugula, and used garlic rolls instead of focaccia. My family was definitely satisfied!

Very Tasty. I pounded the chicken breast so they were a bit thinner. I also seasoned them with salt, pepper, and italian seasoning. I added roasted red peppers to the sandwiches along with chopped pepperocinis.

This is an excellent base recipe (hence the 4 stars) for what could be an absolutely wonderful sandwich.  I prepared the chicken and the sauce on this one as stated in the recipe, used foccacia rolls split in half, spread on the sauce, added cream cheese whipped with garlic, minced red peppers and green onions for awesome flavor, once the sandwiches were assemble, I basted both sides with garlic butter and grilled in a panini press.  These were the best!  Thank you so much for sharing your recipe which can be used in a multitude of ways to make fabulous gourmet sandwiches.

My husband surprised me one day by making this for me and it was delicious!!  He used asiago bread, added a little oregano to the chicken, and used dried rosemary instead of fresh--and it was great!  He also left out the Dijon-style mustard because we aren't fans of that...  Next time, we will double the mayo and rosemary mixture.

Like others, I couldn't find foccacia.  We used "squagles" - square bagels - which I toasted just before making the sandwiches.  The family concensus was thumbs up, but not way up.  Some added more spread which helped.  I think what was lacking is veggies - even lettuce & tomato would help.

I liked. I used focaccia bread bought from Wal-Mart, they were the size of a sandwich a piece, and sliced it in half. I think maybe the taste of fresh rosemary on a sandwich like this was slightly overpowering, but I still enjoyed it, especially the pieces of chicken cooked as instructed. That was the tastiest part. A little dry, I added mozzarella cheese, olie oil, and djionmayonaisse. Felt like something more could have been added, but wasn't sure what else. Still, overall, and excellent sandwich.

Great spring/summer party recipe.  I make these and people ask who my caterer is.  The rosemary mayo makes the sandwich. In the fall/winter I use slow roasted plum tomatoes to give the sandwiches a heartier dish (because tomatoes stink at this time of year).

Great!  I used my breadmaker to prepare the dough, then I used the focaccia for Gourmet Chicken Sandwiches (from this site).  Family loved it.

This was great....this is the same "sauce" I make to put on roast turkey and swiss sandwiches on chiabatta bread...that too is to die for...sooooo good!I made as is and loved it...but have also steeped garlic in evoo to rub on the chicken before grilling...and McCormacks tomato basil marinade is EXCELLENT also!

Basically, I made a coleslaw-like salad using mustard+mayo+olive oil+honey+carrot+cabbage, and used plain bread, toasted with mozarella cheese and dried rosemary on top. Even the chicken breasts, I marinated about 15 minutes with black pepper, a pinch of salt, oregano, and rosemary.
Ok, so I altered the whole recipe. Sorry. :p
Was good, though! My friends and I liked the coleslaw-salad-spread.

Thanx for the recipe!

I liked this recipe although next time I will have to pound the chicken a lot thinner and get the recommended bread insted of the thick french bread that they had left at the supermarket bakery. I did really enjoy the sauce mix that you spread on the bread. Hopefully by the next time I make this I will change my 4 stars into 5.

I used rosemary onion focaccia and bought two loaves.  I doubled the spread recipe, but wished I'd had a bit more.  However, I added provolone cheese (2 sliced per loaf) and it kept it from being too dry.  This was plenty to serve 4 people with leftovers for lunch the next day.  I served it with a green salad and cantaloupe - wonderful for a hot summer night easy supper!
