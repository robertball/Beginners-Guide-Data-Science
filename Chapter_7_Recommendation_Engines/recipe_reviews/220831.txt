Drats!  I only made half a batch for our dinner tonight!  It may not last if I don't stop picking at it!  As per suggestions made by the submitter of the recipe, I used different mushrooms and nuts (walnuts).  I checked out morel mushrooms only to find that not only are they seasonal but very very expensive as well, so I used criminis (baby bellas).  I sauteed the mushrooms for a bit in a touch of butter for browning, and I dry roasted the walnuts in a pan.  I'm sure that with each substitution of mushroom and nuts that the flavor will vary a little.  Next time I'll use hazelnuts because I think that will go with the nuttiness of the rice itself.  I think also that I'll go a little short on the sour cream, too, if I even add it at all!  I've been eyeing this recipe for a long time, and I'm so glad that it can now enter my repertoire of side dishes.  Thanks!

I made this last evening. Using Lundberg Wild Rice Blend. I switched out the water for chicken broth, used sliced mushrooms and chopped walnuts.  I totally omitted the sour cream.  It was rich and very satisfying.  Great for those who are lactose intolerant and healthier for us all. Served with chicken thighs.

Followed recipe except I added some fresh basil that I had on hand.  Mine didn't look too appealing after adding the sour cream, but it tasted good!  Thanks JessKZ for this recipe...it was fun to make!

just made it, maybe it will be better after refrigerating overnight? but it's kind of bland and I'm going to end up chopping up some herbs and add spices to make it ok or add more rice b/c there is too much sour cream,
