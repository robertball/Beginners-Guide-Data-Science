These turned out excellent and much better than I had anticipated. I think the key is in the thickness of the slices. They need to be thin but not paper thin. To get them to the point they are super crisp they get pretty brown BUT the browner they got the better they tasted. They almost got the tang you get from a fried green tomato. I was very impressed with these and plan on experimenting with different flavor combinations. One step that I think would improve this recipe is to toss the sliced zucchini in the salt rather than sprinkle the salt on after they are already on the baking sheet. This would distribute the salt more evenly.  Excellent recipe!

I love how simple these are to make and how yummy! First time I cut them too thin and some became one with the baking sheet... but I stood and ate the ones that were thick enough. A great snack.

Loved the flavor of these chips. I only had small diameter zucchini so the baked slices are too small but they taste wonderful. I agree with another reviewer that there is a tangy "fried green tomato" flavor that is satisfying on a ketone diet. Will be looking for bigger zucchini to make them to share.

Delicious! Crisp! Great substitute for potato chips. The only problem is they have to cook so long that by the time they're done they are a fraction of the size and weight they started at. I used very large zucchinis but ended up with only a small container of chips. It's a lot of work for a small yield but they are so good it might just be worth it!

I don't know if I did something wrong but these did not work for me. They were so brittle and stuck to the parchment paper I ended up having to throw them away. I used a mandolin so maybe they just need to be cut thicker.

I made these they were good, to prevent them from sticking to the pan I used a silicone baking sheet it worked great

Came out with good flavor. I used butter cooking spray in pan and on top of zucchini plus I added pepper. I didn't have a slicer so with me cutting them some took longer to cook and mine weren't as crispy as I would have liked but they are very tasteful I will try again when I get a slicer.

They take longer than 2 hours to cook.  I also added garlic powder and they tasted pretty good. I think these would be more suitable for a food dehydrator than an oven. But regardless the taste is excellent. 4 stars because it is very time consuming.

Made mine to thick I think they took along time to crisp up, made marinara sauce to dip in, great keto dish.id post a picture but it doesn't allow it.

I sliced the zucchini 1/8” thick on a mandoline & added pepper. I was surprised how the zucchini was actually pretty sweet after baking. Will try slicing 1/4” thick next time to see what thickness I prefer. Definitely will make this again and experiment with different spices.

Not bad at all! Agreed the zucchini loses more then half it's size from evaporation however what it loses in size makes up in taste for sure, just have to make alot.
