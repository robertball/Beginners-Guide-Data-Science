I used organic black beans and organic chicken broth in this recipe. I didn't need to wait an hour for my onions to caramelize, mine were good to go in about 20 minutes. I always drain and rinse my beans--because I do this, I knew to add just a little more chicken broth. This is one of the BEST refried beans we've ever had. After tasting it, I regretted right away not making double. Luscious is right.

This is one awesome recipe!  There are only a couple of things I changed here; first, I cooked the bacon and onions in a little bit of olive oil with a pinch of sugar, and put in about triple the garlic.  Also, I didn't add the cilantro at the end, because it tasted perfect without it.  And it only took me about an hour from start to finish.  This is a recipe I'll be making often.  Thanks!

I needed to use up some bacon I had around so I used regular bacon instead of turkey bacon, but the recipe was DELICIOUS! The flavors in the beans were great. I made it as a side dish for enchiladas and spanish rice and it was a perfect complement.

It was delicious and went very well w the salmon I made from here. 
Both I and my friend enjoyed the flavor immensely and its low fat....

Absolutely delicious!  I used regular bacon, just because hubby likes it better.  After trying this, I don't think I'll ever buy canned refried beans again!

These beans were good - but..... I was skeptical about the bacon in refried beans. I should have followed my instincts.  Maybe I shouldn't have followed a few reviewers advice and added in the cooked bacon at the end of cooking.It added a very strange texture that did not go well with refried beans. I tasted it before I put the bacon in and loved it - would have given it 5+ stars. It was similar to the beans you can get in many authentic mexican restaraunts. It also took considerably longer to cook than stated. Once adding in the chicken stock it took a little over 2 hours. So that was 3 hours total for a side dish. However, the time issues didn't bother me as much as adding in the bacon ruined the dish. Perhaps putting the bacon in at the beginning of the cooking process would have changed the end result. But bacon in this dish is not needed. The cilantro is a must.
I have made this dish several more times with out the bacon - 5 stars for sure. I always double the recipe and use the leftovers later in other dishes.

Wonderful taste! I rinsed the beans first and omitted the salt. Even with doing this I found it tasted fine. I also added a bit of cumin. I will make this many, many more times I am sure!

I followed the recipe exactly, except I forgot to buy fresh cilantro so I added a few tablespoons of dried instead. I really liked this recipe the bacon gave it some great flavor (but in the future I'll follow the advise of a another user and add the bacon last so its crispy).

Whoa! Salt overload alert!  I used about half the salt called for and it was decidedly too salty (as opposed to a little too salty).  Easy enough to cut back on but be forewarned!  Even if using regular bacon was partially responsible, I doubt a full teaspoon of salt would be necessary!  Other than that this was very good! When I asked Hubs (you’d think he’d get this by now) for a more elaborate and helpful response than “it’s good!” he remarked that these beans were second only to our favorite Mexican place in Naples (owned and operated by a man from Mexico!).  Ok, now he’s telling me how much he liked these beans in a clear and understandable way!  I did make some changes in deference to Hubs’ sensitive innards and taste preferences.  I subbed minced green pepper for the jalapeno (thank you, thank you very much, he said) and eliminated the cilantro (more thanks).  I would have liked the additions of both, but I don’t see how either could have made me enjoy these more.  I made what is becoming the recurrent mistake of not carefully reading the recipe before I proceeded and found these required a 2-hour cooking time.  I didn’t have that kind of time when I started supper so I cooked them with a significantly shorter cooking time.  I can’t imagine how much better they’d have been had I cooked them longer but who knows, maybe they would have been!  Whether or not you include the cilantro or jalapeno these beans will please your palate – just be very careful with the salt!

Loved it.  I used turkey sausage instead of the bacon and used less celantro.  Yum!

Excellent. Next time making this, cut back a little on the chicken stock if wanting firm refried beans for burritos as more can be added if needed.

This is great. I stirred the bacon in before serving so it was still crispy.

since first making this recipe the first time, i have made it a hundred more.  it's my absolute go-to for refried beans and i always double the recipe because it's also great for leftovers.  better than any can i ever opened.  my son and husband stand over the pot and eat it with spoons.  it's that good.

These refried beans were just like you get in a Mexican restaurant.  They had a great depth of flavor and tasted rich and slow cooked.  I used regular bacon because that is what I had in the house - it gave the beans a nice smokey flavor.  I left out the salt since I used regular bacon and it was fine.  I left the other ingredients the same, but, used (2) cans of black beans and ended up using close to 2 cups low sodium chicken stock.  I would definitely make again, but, not on a week night.  It was worth the wait, but, took a long time to get to the pefect consistency.

Used smoked bacon that our neighbor makes.  Had to cook longer than stated to reduce fluid, next time I will add less chicken broth.  Instead of using potato masher, I put the whole mixture in food processor.  Flavor and texture excellant.  Agree, may never buy canned beans again.

From the rave reviews, I somehow thought the turkey bacon was going to be okay in this.  It tasted like I had added chunks of bologne to my beans.  Yuck.  I'll be looking for a different recipe.
