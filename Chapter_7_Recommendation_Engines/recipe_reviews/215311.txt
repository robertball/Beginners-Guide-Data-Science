This was delicious and easy!  Also easy to modify.  I used only green peppers (others too pricey right now). I added a small can of chopped green chiles for a little zip, and used Great Northern beans instead of garbanzo (my kids don't like garbanzo beans).  I also use V8 juice instead of tomato sauce, and found that just one can of tomato paste makes it plenty thick.  This will be a regular at our house!  Thanks!

Great!  We aren't vegan--not even vegetarian--and it was still appreciated.  Great way to make a chili in the crock pot that is hearty and really healthy. It makes a ton and was delicious for days afterwards.  I only had one small can of diced tomatoes, but just added a little extra veggie broth to make up for the liquid that would have been in the canned tomatoes.  We have a large crock pot, and it almost didn't all fit!  For the reviewer who was worried about sodium, just check the sodium levels of your veggie broth, rinse your beans well (or use fresh and soak them overnight before), and/or omit the salt.  I can't see what else would be adding so much sodium. ALSO, I didn't saute any vegetables in olive oil first.  Just added all to the crock pot.  Not sure if that would have made a difference, but I doubt it.  Cooked 8 hours on low.

DAIYA Vegan cheese is the way to go, it actually melts so you can have Nacho's!  I added some Lime Juice, used Mexican style canned tomatoes and threw in some Jalapeno's, found I didn't need the broth.  This is a great make ahead and freeze in portions dish, especially to take into the office and have for lunch and looks wonderful with all the different colours.  I served it over brown rice and it's really filling.  Thanks Grete!

I'm not vegan- in fact, I'm not even vegetarian, but we LOVED this! We had dinner guests, with a mix of dietary restrictions and this was a big hit with everyone!!
I sauteed the peppers,onions and garlic as suggested. I added an 8 oz package of fresh mushrooms in the last couple of minutes of sauteeing. 
I left out the spinach, used only one can of tomato paste, and used 2 cola-sized cans of V8 rather than 1 can of tomato sauce. Otherwise, I used all veggies and spices as listed. 
We will definitely break out this recipe the next time we have guests with strict diets. (And probably sometimes when we don't!) Thanks for posting!!

So good... All of these ingredients wouldn't fit in our slow cooker so we put it in a big pot on the stove for about 4-5 hours and let it simmer. Delicious. Everything just melts in your mouth. And the taste, you can't even tell it doesn't have meat in it. Lovely.

Yummy!  Doubt my kids will eat it, but it's delish!!  I omitted salt and olive oil and just threw everything into crockpot.  Also, instead of buying all the cans of beans, I bought the dried 15 bean package and presoaked them overnight in water.

This was sent to e-mail a few weeks ago and I made it that day!  the grocery store was out of the zuccini and squash, so I used parsnips and mushrooms instead and fresh spinach instead of frozen.  LOVED it and am making it again today.  It makes a lot, so I gave some to my parents who are not vegan, and they begged me to make it again!

I would give this 5 stars but WHERE ON EARTH is all of that SODIUM coming from!?!? That is A LOT of sodium! How big is an actual serving? I know it SERVES 15 but is that a half cup? 3/4 cup? Also, I am bummed out that there isn't really THAT much protein in it..maybe I'll throw some tofu in there...

WAY too much tomato. The consistency was like tomato sauce with vegetables. Won't be making this again, but if I did I would use only 6 oz tomato paste and no tomato sauce. Also, 4 Tbsp. chili powder would be plenty.

This is not your traditional chili but it is a good chili nonetheless . I did not have zucchini and squash so i replaced those with diced carrots and celery.Worked out nice and replaced the tomato sauce with vegetable cocktail like one reviewer did and it was also good.

Total Comfort Food! Apologies to the vegans out there, but I used the recipe as a guide and made it into a pot of beef minestrone. Based on ingredients I had on hand, I subbed butternut squash for yellow; added diced celery, carrots and chopped frozen green beans; subbed two cans of kidney beans only and one 28-ounce can crushed tomatoes as the only canned tomato product used; a little cumin and a tablespoon of dried Italian herbs subbed for chili powder and oregano. One half pound of beef stew cut in small dice, and beef broth completed the soup. Just used a big soup pot and sauteed the vegetables and beef, adding everything else and simmering 2-3 hours.
Even more delicious the next day.

This is a very hearty chili with great flavor!  And I am such a carnivore!  Great for those participating in a Daniel Fast.

Wonderful chili recipe, very flavorful, and imho you definitely won't miss the meat!  I have a 6-qt. crockpot, and as other reviewers stated, the ingredients filled it to the brim.  Just a few minor modifications...I used a 16 oz. pkg. of frozen spinach, same size of frozen corn, only one onion, 3 tsps. jarred minced garlic, and added 2 cups cut-up fresh green beans I had on hand.  As suggested by other reviewers, I skipped the sauteeing step and added the peppers, onions and garlic directly into the pot, and used canned Mexican-style tomatoes with green chilies.  I also cut way back on the chili powder; I used 2 Tbsp., and that to me was the perfect amount, considering it also calls for a Tbsp. of cumin, which is similar to chili powder.  Any more would have been too overpowering.  The one ingredient I added that veered me off the vegan path was a cup of homemade chicken broth I had in the freezer, in lieu of vegetable broth.  In all, the chili is excellent, and it came out perfect...not too thick OR thin.  I cooked it about 6-1/2 hours total.  It made plenty of leftovers, and right now I am enjoying a bowl of it for lunch as I type this.

This recipe has good taste but it is WAY TOO spicy!  I even cut down the chili powder down to 4 tablespoons.  If I do this again I will try 2 tablespoons.

This is AWESOME! It tastes good as leftovers too. My husband (not vegetarian) and I (vegetarian) loved it. I will definitely be making this more often. I'm not vegan so I used cheddar to top and corn chips on the side. YUM!

We are contemplating a transition to a more vegan or at least vegetarian lifestyle and trying a few new recipes. This one definitely will be added to our rotation, vegetarian or not.  
Didn't have the zucchini or squash, but there was plenty without those two. Seems like you can add whatever you have or want. 
Also i didn't have tomato paste or tomato sauce, just used some hot salsa instead, it turned out well. We were very pleasantly surprised.

This came out phenomenal. I did use cumin, red peppers, and some other spices as suggested by others who made the dish. I also opted to add red peppers and jalepeno, it didn't made it too spicy. I absolutely love this dish and the way it came out.  I did add some vegetable broth because the paste made the soup very thick and I used the broth to loosen the soup. I went and added the meatless crumbles and a little bit of avocado and vegan cheese. Thumbs up!

I followed this recipe exactly because I am not a believer in "oh I changed this for that..) Blah blah blah, who cares. This dish turned out awesome and my 7 year old said, "Mom, this chili has things in it I normally don't like but it tastes just like NORMAL CHILI!!!" :) My only complaint/tip would be as another reviewer stated, all the ingredients DO NOT fit in my standard crock pot so we had to transfer it to a pot on the stove, where I cooked it first on high and then on low for about 3 hours. Good recipe.

This chili recipe is outstanding!! In an effort to a) start cooking more at home and b) eat more veggies, I spotted this and was very drawn to it. The preparation is fun because of all the different colors of the ingredients. Tricked me into thinking I’m a domestic goddess. If you like spice, I suggest using fire-roasted diced tomatoes for the recipe. If not, I’m 100% positive regular diced tomatoes (which the recipe calls for) would be equally as tasty. Highly recommend this recipe, especially for the cooler months (though we don’t get much of that in Florida lol).

I made this and my kids loved it! I modified it by skipping oregano, adding cinnamon and about a teaspoon of soy sauce. It's thick, hearty and delicious! I also left out the tomato sauce and spinach. I forgot the spinach and thought 2 cans of paste and 1 can of  sauce would be too thick. I also added 4 oz of water.  I msde it on the stove too. I will definitely make again!

This was delicious. I followed the recipe to the tee with one exception. I added two finely chopped habanero peppers because I like spicy. This was still not quite spicy enough and next time I make it I'll likely add 3 or 4.

It's really impressive how delicious this is without any animal products at all. I am considering adding Seitan the next time I make this.

This was a good, hearty recipe and easy to make. Based on the review that the tomato was overwhelming, I used only half of the tomato paste, and instead used a little more of the tomato sauce since it is not as concentrated. I used fresh spinach rather than frozen. The family doesn't care for zucchini or squash, so I left that out, and I used some vegan ground meat substitute to make it more hearty.  I also added about 3 tbsp. of brown sugar to cut the spice a bit. It was a hit with the family. I will definitely be making this again.

This is my second time making it and it came out just as good as the first time! It’s the perfect dish to make for a big group of people on a cold fall night. I had Fritos (which are vegan), avocado slices, and shredded cheese on the side for people to add also. So yummy! ??

This was so delicious. I ended up not adding spinach and garbanzo beans since I don't care for them much. I also added an orange bell pepper because I love them. It had a great consistency and was very tasty when mixed with a serving of brown rice.  As a busy and active college student, this kept me full and sated for either lunch or dinner throughout the week.  It was nice to know I got enough servings of veggies each day too. I am totally making it again.

I love this recipe.  It's become a go-to of mine.  Recently I made it for a work pot-luck and for a friend's pot-luck.  Both times I received high commendations.  Totally recommend.

I’m surprised by how delicious this was! I added carrots, celery and a can of pinto beans and it was almost overflowing my croc pot. I’ll definitely be making this again! Thanks for sharing :)

Fantastic Recipe!!   The first time, I followed the recipe as written.  6 Tbs of Chili powder is way too much and over powers the vegetables (it is also half the bottle of chili powder).  The second time I made it, I used 2 Tbs.  Turned out much better.  Also, there is way too much volume for a medium crock pot.  I would cut it in half if you have a 6 quart crock pot or less.

Way too much tomato!  When I finally tasted it, it was like I was spooning tomato sauce from a tin that has a kick (even though I didn't add the full amount of chili powder)

I added a little honey and a few other seasonings to make it palatable.

Loved this chili!!  I read some of the reviews and made some changes based on those i.e. added 6 cups of water.  Make sure that you have a large enough vessel, I used a large stew pot because I have a human size crock pot =)  I also took the time to clean out a few items from the fridge by adding kale and edamame - delish!!

I followed advice from others and cut the chili powder down to 2TBSP- but felt it was lacking something- I'll try with 3 TBSP, or cut the cumin next time. I also only used 1 can each of paste and sauce. I used frozen peppers (red, yellow, green) from Trader Joe's which were perfect! Got good reviews from the potluck I took it to. Definitely a keeper for getting lots of veggies in and would definitely be good with meat too ;)

This just barely fit in my 5 quart slow cooker without any extra liquid per step 2 (I didn't need the extra sauce or broth).  If your slow cooker is smaller, be prepared to cut back.  Good flavors.

It turned out great. I did it for a potluck. It was a winner by my co-workers. I did substitute the dice tomatoes with a can of Rotel. It gave it a nice bite. Plus, I found a can of black beans with lime and jalapeños.

Loved this chili! I found this recipe while looking for Daniel fast meal ideas. It’s easy and makes a lot. I followed the recipe as written except for the chili powder and spinach. I ran out of chili powder, but 5tbs was perfect. My crock pot was filled to almost overflowing so I had to leave the spinach out. Can’t wait to make this again! Next time I’ll try it with the spinach and half the tomato paste.

Initially I didn't have enough sauce but I settled with extra tomatoes and an additional can of paste. It was delicious. My kids loved it. Couple of days later I added spaghetti sauce and put it over veggie noodles.  It was very tasty.

I will Devin make this again. I ended up using about 2-3 cups of broth instead of 1. Also, 6 tbsp of chili powder is pretty spicy.... I suggest starting with 2 or 3 and then add more if you’d like.

Not a very yummy chilli recipe, too tomatoey and bitter for a chilli. So - I turned it into a soup and added cooked chopped spaghetti noodles and leftover stuffing and everyone raved about it. Weird lol

I make this every week, just about!!!  My husband and I have lost 120 pounds together with delicious vegan recipes like this. And our children are eating better also.   I made it for our daughter and family while we were visiting them in California and it came out SO hot 2 of us couldn’t eat it!  The other 4 loved it.   I think it was the difference in Chili powder.

I made this as written, but there was too much to fit in my slow cooker. I put it in a big stock pot and put the gas on the stove as low as it would go, and let it cook overnight.  I found it  bland despite all the chili powder, and also lacking a certain richness. I added a bunch of seasonings, and might add veggie grounds to make it more satisfying for dinner.

So so good! My vegan daughter just asked for the recipe! ( I didn’t add spinach because I forgot to buy it. It was fine. )

Came out great! I only used green peppers (instead of red and yellow) and did not sautée the veggies first nor did I use veggie broth because I forgot to buy some! I just added water and it turned out delicious!

I used NO SALT ADDED canned beans and diced tomatoes.  I also sauteed in tbsp of water vs. oil.  I also substituted Mrs. Dash for the teaspoon of salt.  Lastly it called for 4 cloves of garlic.  So I used 9.  It takes a bit of time to prep, but it is easy.  It's as delicious as it is healthy.  And by not using salt or oil, this is 100% whole food plant based.

Don't think it needed the second 6 ounces of tomato paste as I needed to add much more broth to make it thinner.   Very good flavor and loved the vegetables.  Would make it again.

An excellent, easy vegetarian weeknight chili that is quite flexible. I liked the mixed beans and the many textures from the various veggies. I only used 4 T. chili powder, and that was plenty. I also didn't have a yellow squash, so I threw in some frozen cubed hash brown potatoes instead. I wilted fresh spinach and added it right before serving since I didn't have frozen on hand. I think one can of tomato paste was plenty. I also needed a bit more liquid/stock. This recipe filled about 3/4 of my 7-qt slow cooker, so it makes a lot!

It was much better than I expected it to be.  I've been looking for vegan recipes for my health nut dad (the last person on earth you would guess would have a quadruple bypass). This recipe has a lot of flavor (even though I forgot to buy oregano). As delicious as it was, I'm not likely to make it much though. So much prep! I think my hands would be sore today even if I didn't have rheumatoid arthritis. Good food though, and it makes a large batch.

I thought overall it was a really great recipe. I did reduce the amount of tomato paste and sauce, only using 1 can of each. I also only had 4 tablespoons of chili powder and it was perfect. Very versatile on what veggies to throw in. I will make again.

I made this and it got rave reviews from my Vegan friends - they wanted the recipe. I did adjust to my taste. Did not include corn to cut down on carbs and omitted yellow squash. I added in carrots and chopped cauliflower to substitute.  I used 1 white onion & 1 red onion and a more garlic. Only needed 1 can of the tomato sauce.  I did add in a bit of liquid smoke also for flavor.  Will for sure make this again.  Would recommend cutting the frozen spinach in half as it seemed to overtake the chilli a bit .

It was delicious! However, it does not fit in a standard crockpot  and the prep time was longer than anticipated. Because my lid would not fit, I covered my crockpot with foil and let it cook on low for 4 hours. I did not let it cook an additional hour because I was making it for an event the next day and I knew that it would be on the steam table for a few hours. Both vegans and non-vegans loved it!!! It's worth making again for a special event.

This was the first chilli I have ever made and it was delicious. Things I did different - tinned corn (drained) instead of frozen, left the yellow squash out and some of my measurements were slightly off, because I used Australian cup/spoon measurements. Also, I don't know what tinned tomato sauce is because it's not common here so I used bottled stuff, I guess it's the same. I also ran out of chilli powder, so I ended up with 4 tbsp of chilli and one of chilli flakes, which was plenty spicy enough. Both of us are meat eaters and my partner made a meat one as well (we had a party last night and served the chilli's up with burritos and salads and stuff) and we both loved this chilli more than the meat one. I will definitely make this again

I may have been a little generous with the peppers, onions and zucchini and by the time I got everything else in my slow cooker I didn't have room for tomato sauce so I skipped that ingredient.  It was awesome.

I made this for vegan visiting family members.
EDITS TO RECIPE:
 • I used tomatoes with mild green chilies,
 • 15oz can of whole kernel corn (drained & rinsed),  
 • omitted the salt. Everything else as per the recipe. 

It was quite good, I don't think anyone added salt. 2 of us at the meal were not vegan, & found it delicious--we didn't miss the meat! 

Next time, I would do everything the same, as edited, EXCEPT I would  DECREASE the chili powder to 4 or 5 tablespoons instead of 6. (I did use a crock pot liner--made clean-up a snap!)

This dish is absolutely awesome. This was a hit with the whole family (none of whom are vegan, which says a lot) . My 14 year old liked it, my 20 year old loved it. My parents ( both in thier 70's loved it and my husband & I loved it. The flavors were amazing. It was such a warm and friendly dish.  I will be making this dish again. The only thing that I will do different is to only add about 1 1/2 tablespoons of chili pepper. I had only put 4 of the 6 called for tablespoons and my family loves heat but had it of been any hotter than what it was Im not sure we could have handled it. Overall this dish is a win.

Second time making it!  I decreased the amount of onions and peppers since I typically cannot eat these.  I also added quinoa this time.  Excellent, yummy and fairly simple for someone like me who does not cook a great deal.

For my first time using a slow cooker as well as making chili, I must say it came out pretty well. Taste great also. Although I wanted to keep it healthy, I also wanted it to feel traditional. I substituted the zucchini, spinach & corn for Beyond Meat brand crumbles for a "ground beef" texture. This will be a regular meal in my household.

I made the dish as instructed with the exception of the tomato paste (only one can) and I increased the vegetable broth; it was delicious. When I make it again, I will add more corn (12 oz. bag) and will use Great Northern Beans (the chickpeas were not as soft as I like even though they did not take away from the recipe)

We omitted the spinach and subbed the garbanzo beans and kidney beans with additional black beans.  It was delicious.  The only thing it was missing was some spice, but that was easily remedied by adding a spicy homemade salsa that we also made.

This is great for the Daniel Fast!  I made it with 2 red and 1 green bell pepper (what I had on hand), and made it on the stove top.  It was really thick so I ended up adding 4 cups of veggie broth.  It is excellent by itself but my hubby like it with brown rice.  You may want to cut down on the chili powder, it does have a kick, if I make it again I think i will lower it to at least 3-4 Tbsp.  It does make a lot of chili - food for freezing!

I halved the recipe and added some other veggies, but it still made about 10 servings. I also used canned corn (drained) instead of thawed frozen because that's what I had. It's really yummy and I can't wait to make it for more people than just myself, it's sure to be a hit.

I absolutely loved this dish! I've eaten it for lunch and dinner for four days lol and I made it again tonight! I'm a new vegetarian so I'm just now getting familiar with different vegetables. I couldn't even tell all of these veggies were in it so that's a plus! I made it exactly like the recipe says and wouldn't change a thing...

This was a great recipe (and my first slow cooker adventure!). I made a couple modifications: used homemade vegetable stock (made with mushrooms), and overnight presoaked beans (not canned). I also added mushrooms and four chopped and de-skinned tomatoes in place of one lf the tomato cans. Since I had no yellow squash or spinach, I omitted those, but added extra zucchini and mushrooms instead. I liked the spices combination (I thought this much chili powder was too much but it turned out fine). This is a great recipe that's perfect for using up all those veggies sitting around in the fridge. It is indeed hearty but also light. 

I had to cook it in two portions since the ingredients were making my slowcooker overflow.

delicious, I prefer spicy foods so I used hot chili powder. this came out so good! next time though I will use 2/3 of ingredients because it was at the rim on my slow cooker

Only giving this 4 instead of 5 stars because based on other reviews I omitted the tomato sauce, just used tomato paste and a can of diced tomatoes. I also added mushrooms. Will definitely be a "do-again" - and it was beautiful, too!

I made this exactly as suggested but will make a few adjustments to fit the desires of my family next time. I will omit the spinach because of the texture and use half the suggested amount of chili powder.  Instead of garbanzo beans, I'll try lentils or more kidney beans.  Other then that, the flavor was great and made enough to feed my family of 7 with leftovers.

Not being vegetarian, I thought I might miss the meat.  Not at all!  The only changes I made were to cut the chili powder by two tablespoons and omitting the cumin.  Everything else was done as directed.  This was delicious!  I made homemade cornbread to go along with it.  This is a keeper!
 This time, I omitted the yellow squash and instead, used 3 zucchini.  Perfect!

I'm not vegan, in fact I love meat and did not miss it in this recipe. I'm trying to cut about 90% of the meat from diet for weight/health reasons, I didn't think I would be able to do it but this dish gives me hope that I can eat vegan and actually LIKE it!!!

I didn't follow this recipe exactly, and here were my changes:

- No tomato sauce
- I used half a dozen large mushrooms instead of the yellow squash
- I mixed up the spices a bit by mixing chili pepper with paprika

Even with these changes, I doubt I'd make this recipe again for a few reasons:
- It's HUGE and it barely fit into the slow cooker. I was worried that it wouldn't cook through, but 6 hours on high heat was sufficient
- As another reviewer has mentioned, there is way too much tomato in this - I think it would have been better to add only 6 oz of tomato paste
- The flavour in this isn't very layered - it would have had a deeper flavour, I think, if you replaced 2 of the bell peppers with some carrots and celery. Plus, the spice mix doesn't add a lot of flavour - adding some coriander to the mix would have been helpful, I think.

I would not consider this spicy at all. Probably won't make it again.

Good base, but lacking in flavor. We have a lot of leftovers so I'm going to add 3-4 tablespoons of cumin and some red pepper flakes at a minimum.

`Very good! the only reason I did not give it five stars is because, like whyaduck said, too much tomato paste! But, thanks Grete!
