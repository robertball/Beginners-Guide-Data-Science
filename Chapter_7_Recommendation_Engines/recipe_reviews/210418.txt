Two tips for you:   1) An 11.5 oz. bag of Ghirardelli 60% cacao bittersweet chocolate chips is about $3.99.  A 4 oz. Ghirardelli 60% cacao bittersweet chocolate baking bar is about $3.59.  Therefore, if you buy the chips instead of the bar, you have almost enough chocolate to make this dessert on two different occasions (vs. having to buy two bars at about $3.59 each to make it once).  If you use the chips, you'll be short 1/4 oz. of chocolate each time you make it, which is not a big deal, and the chips melt faster, too! 2) This recipe is delicious, but I gave it four stars because it's a lot of extra, unnecessary work to have to make the center mixture separately from the cake.  There are many other recipes out there that are just as good that do NOT require you to do this.  Other recipes simply have you melt the chocolate and butter in a double broiler, add the sugar, pour that mixture into the egg mixture, add the flour, put in ramekins and bake.  And, if you bake it the proper number of minutes, you'll have a perfectly molten center just like this recipe, without having to refrigerate anything.

I found this recipe in an ad in one of my magazines. I've made it many times, and my guests always ask for the recipe. It's wonderful and comes out great every time. I like spreading a little raspberry sauce around the bottom of the plate to make a nice presentation and add a little something extra to the taste. I've even made the batter ahead of time, put it in the individual dishes, and then refrigerated it for several days. Pop it in the oven and they still come out great!

now I must admit, I really improvised; I did not want to leave my house just to buy ingredients.... so, the texture was great, the taste, ok.  BUT definitely was b/c of my substitutions:  had no Ghirardelli choc, so used 45% cacao semi-sweet choc chips (365 brand) and had no heavy whipping cream, so used dry milk and made it very thick when adding the water (this mixture would not harden in the fridge, so stuck in the freezer for a few minutes, and turned out just ok).  I subbed spelt flour with 1 T. of potato starch for the cake flour.   The chocolate was way too sweet, so def. make sure you use the chocolate it calls for.  Also, I baked it in regular cupcake tins (with liners) and baked for about 11 minutes (I had enough batter for 10 cupcakes).   The consistancy of the "lava" did improve the longer I waited to eat it (about 10-15 minutes after it is removed from oven is perfect).  And oh, if you are watching it bake, and the liquid in the middle starts to ooze out a little at the top, take out immediately, it was in there too long.

This is the first time I've made/eaten a lava cake and oh my gosh! This is so good! I did make one major change to this recipe though, I used all semi-sweet chocolate because I have a big sweet tooth and bittersweet just wouldn't have done it for me. This came out so perfect. For the center, I lined a mini muffin tin and put the ganache in the individual cups. I simply needed to remove the liners from the hardened middle and put it in batter. Saved the mess of rolling into balls (and probably made a bigger chocolate center - but I'm not complaining!) I simply garnished this with a sprinkle of powdered sugar and raspberry preserves, it was perfect. Thanks for posting!

Great recipe. I made some modifications that worked great. First, I used a nice bittersweet chocolate not 60% to tone it down a little. I let the filling harden overnight which was much easier to deal with the next day. Next, I doubled the recipe for cake (filling too) and made them in muffin tins. I made 18 mini cakes filling them about 2/3rds full and baking them for about 12 minutes. I let them cool and flipped them out of the pan. The center tends to cave just a bit. I made fresh cinnamon whip cream and raspberries to fill in the dent. It was a hit! No left overs or sad faces.

I also found this recipe in Good Housekeeping a few years ago. They are so easy and come out right every time.  The other recipes that do not have the center can be very tricky to get done just right--basically they are an undercooked cake--this one is not.  When I make chocolate ganache for cake or cupcakes, I make a little extra, then scoop it into balls and store them in the freezer.  That way they are always ready when I want to make these lava cakes!  It's really too messy to roll them in your warm hands, so I use a spoon (a melon baller would work too). Sometimes I mix in a little frambois to flavor the center. A raspberry coulie squirted or dabbled on the plate with the fresh raspberries and a sprig of mint (served on a white plate of course) makes a gorgeous presentation.  I do not use the whipped cream because it leaves a heavy taste in the mouth.  These cakes are very, very easily reheated in the microwave (in the cups) for just a few seconds.  They come out like freshly baked.

Very quick and easy. I microwaved everything. I did all the mixing/melting two days ahead, and poured the batter into a large-muffin pan (meant for six) since I don't have ramekins, and the center mixture into a small tupperware container. Then I stuck it in the fridge. The night I was serving them, I rolled the truffles while the oven was preheating. I didn't use raspberries, the cool whip was enough. Just a warning: Very dark chocolate. I might try a different chocolate for the lava next time. Overall: everyone loved them.

Yum! This was perfect for Valentines Day! I used Green and Black's 72% cacao baking bar. I baked them in silicone muffin cups (made 10 this way). They reheated well in the toaster oven the next day too!

I am 14 years old and i was able to make the whole recipe on my own with very little mess!  I didn't have a beater so i wisked the egg, sugar and vanilla extract for 5 minutes by hand and there didn't appear to be any issue.  I also did not have a ramekin, instead i substituted a big muffin tin and cooked them like muffins.  Once the cake came out i waited 5 minutes and then used a bottle cap to make a hole in the center of the cake.  Then i used a knife to deepen the hole in the cake.  Then i placed the balls of filling in the holes.   I placed the stuffing i had taken out to make the whole on the top of the hole, so it was nearly not visible. Then instead of raspberries and whipped cream.  I used Ben & Jerry's ice cream (Milk & Cookies flavor/ any flavor you like will do). And i melted Hershey's Chocolate Syrup in the microwave for 5 seconds and drizzled it in a zigzag motion over the ice cream and lava cake.  IT WAS AMAZING!!!

I love this recipe. I didn't have a double-broiler, so I melted semi-sweet chocolate chips 30 seconds at a time and stirred. I put the two in the fridge overnight so I could pop them in really fast during the meal. I couldn't get the center to curl up in balls, so I put some at the bottom of the ramekins and then put the rest on top. They turned out pretty well. I served them in the ramekins.

Try adding coffee liqueur to the "lava" creamy center of this cake like Kahlua.  Or  other possibilities are Bailey's Irish creme or even a touch raspberry extract. YUM!

Wow. They look and taste really amazing and they aren't too difficult to make!  I followed the recipe pretty much exactly except I used semi-sweet ghirardelli chocolate chips. I probably should have waited about 10 min to eat them so the "lava" wasn't so runny but I couldn't wait!!

I love this recipe. You aren't eating raw cake batter, which a lot of other recipes require in order to have the liquid center.  However, after making the chocolate balls, I like to FREEZE them. Then, after pouring the cake batter into the ramekins or muffin tins, I drop one of the frozen balls of chocolate into the center of each. The cake bakes beautifully around the ball of chocolate ganache, which melts in the time it takes the cake to bake. Simplicity, perfection. Delicious and impressive.  This is a great recipe.

My daughter requested "anything chocolate" for her birthday dinner. I made these cakes and they were a big hit! They are "everything chocolate"!! Followed the recipe except I didn't have the 60% chocolate, used 54%. Doubled the recipe and used large muffin tins. Made ahead of time and refrigerated until ready to bake. Easy and delicious! What more?

This is very good. Definitely need ice cream with it and a glass of milk. It is bitter chocolate so be prepared for extra dense flavor. I did find that the chocolate in the middle did not firm as others stated. A visit to the freezer helped that. Best part of this cake was I made the batter, put it in my ramekins, placed them on a jelly roll pan, covered them, and put them in my refrigerator before dinner. Well, we were so full from dinner, I ended up not cooking them...for two days! I pulled out the pan and put it on the counter to warm it up, I put my frozen chocolate balls in the middle and cooked it for the fifteen minutes as stated. They came out perfectly. This is a great recipe for a dinner party since I can make the majority of it an advance! Thanks!

Good recipe!  I would recommend doubling the lava part of the recipe as it didn't seem to have enough of the filling compared to other recipes I have tried.

I didn't have ramikens and made these in regular cupcake paper with a cupcake tin pan.  My grandsons loved them.  The "lava" didn't flow out, but was gooey and soft.  After they cooled, I would put them in the microwave for 9 seconds and my grandsons gobbled them up.  Will make again and forego purchasing ramikens.  The lava is a little difficult to work with as it melts in the hands so you have to work quickly, but these are well worth the effort.

I've made this many times, following directions (although not always Ghirardelli chocolate) and it's really good.  I always get compliments on it.  Much better than the mix you buy which I grabbed once as I needed a quick dessert and knew I didn't have everything at home.

I gave this 4 stars for taste but 3 stars for the overall making of this recipe. I followed the recipe as is and I put the chocolate mixture in the refrigerator for 4 hours and it never firmed up. I did stick it in the freezer and when I took it out to start forming the balls it very quickly turned mushy and when I put it back in the freezer to have it harden up it never did so I was quite disappointed in that.  I also was only able to fill 5 ramekins and they weren't even filled very much either.  So I was a little disappointed since I didn't have the balls to put in the middle of the batter so when they were done baking when you put your fork into it there was no "lava". But I do have to say it was so good and chocolatey and I did enjoy the taste of this.  I might attempt it one more time to see if it works out again but I am undecided at this point.

Used 45% baking squares (semi sweet) and followed recipe to "T".  Filled one ramekin and six muffin tins.  Ramekin turned out perfect at 17 min. , molten in the middle, the muffin tins at 19 min. were molten on the bottom.  Wondering if adjusting temp. would have made a difference.  Ganache in the mini muffin paper in the freezer was an excellent tip=no mess.  Testing out the reheat the next day trick to see if I can make ahead.  Will make for 16 guests at my sons request for this to be his birthday cake.  I think I can....did not have ganache for the extra cake and it was moist and wonderful.

These are very good.  Easy to make, moist and the center is so tasty.  Perfect amount of chocolate.  I did not change a thing they are perfect just as they are.  I served with vanilla ice cream.

This dessert presents so well and tastes even better. Probably the best dessert I've ever had, and it looks like a million bucks. I served it with a raspberry sauce drizzled on the plate, a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a sprig of mint.

It was my first time making this cake. So easy.  I made it with all Purpose Flour instead of Cake Flour and turned out just fine and really delicious!

These cakes were not only easy to prepare, but they are easily prepared hours, even days ahead of time! I made them for Thanksgiving and prepared them the morning of.  I heated them up in the oven 350 for 10 min and waited about 5 to get them out of the cups for serving.  Perfect.  No sticking or mess.  A week later my husband took the remaining 2 left in the fridge to work.  He said he followed my instructions for reheating - again, perfect.  Thanks so much for this great recipe!! Will definitely keep and use for future engagements.

I used large Symphony bars (4.25). The extra .25 only made it more chocolately. My daughter's in chocolate bliss!

Simple to make and very delicious. I didn't have Ghirardelli bittersweet chips or bars on hand, so I used Baker's Semi-sweet squares, but I added 1/4-1/2 tsp dutch cocoa powder to the center mixture and the cake mixture, which worked out just fine. It was still so deep and rich and chocolatey that it was quite necessary to serve with whipped cream. I loved how simple the recipe was, too, and you can store the separate parts in your fridge for a couple days for when you desperately need something terrifyingly chocolatey and are ready to dirty a ramekin...

An excellent recipe - my first serious baking endeavour (other than bread and banana bread) and it was a smash hit! Good thing I made extras as guests requested seconds. I made the recipe exactly to spec and wouldn't change a thing, except possibly to double the recipe to make the cakes bigger. Served with oranges marinated in a light syrup made with julienned orange peel and topped with whipped cream and shards of candied ginger. OUTSTANDING!

I'll never understand why someone who doesn't follow a recipe and changes the ingredients, trashes the recipe.  To anyone considering making this, I will be rich, DUH! and it will take time to make, DUH!  You do have to do it right.  BUT, it's totally worth it.  A rich raspberry sauce on the plate and a light dusting of powder sugar make a five star appearance your guest will be thrilled at.

This has got to be one of the best lava cake recipes I have ever made. I took the suggestions of other reviewers and doubled the lava part of the recipe. My husband says it's better than the ones in the high end restaurants. Perfect.

These were amazing! The chocolate balls seemed a little small at first, but ended up being plenty! I made 12 cupcakes and baked at 400 degrees for 12 minutes.

These came out good, and were very easy to make. I think my ramekins were bigger than 4 oz, because I had enough batter for 4 cakes. I reduced the temp to 375 and baked for 18 minutes, because of the larger size.  I personally do not like dark chocolate, so next time I may eat this with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream, or use milk chocolate for the center.

This recipe was super easy! I just used 60% caco chips and only needed one bag. First off if I make it again, I would use about 50% more of the filling recipe. I used a cookie scoop (2 tsp size) to make the balls. With the original recipe, I had enough to make 5 easy scoops and for the sixth one I just used what was left and took a little from each ball. Also if I make it again, I would squish the balls to make them flatter. As balls, they poked out of the batter a bit and I just covered them up before baking. Turned out okay, but I think they would have been better if a little flatter instead of balls. After I made the balls, I put them in the freezer. The batter was very easy to make and I just used a large muffin tin. Filed it about 1/2 full and it went up to 3/4 full with the filling. I coated the tin in shortening and coca powder, and the cakes came out easily after going around the edges with a knife. Also too, I didn't have cake flour so I used all purpose, took out 1/2 T and put in 1/2 T cornstarch.  Shifted it twice to incorporate the cornstarch. I also just microwaved everything. Overall, just a easy recipe and very pleasing for a dessert.

I made my hubby these lava cakes for Valentine's Day. He's a chocolate lover, and these cakes definitely satisfied that sweet tooth. They are vey rich, so I found it necessary to cut the decadence with a barely sweetened homemade whip cream. I also made only 4 cakes in 8oz ramekins, but still followed the baking time and temperature in the recipe, and it worked out really well.

WOW AMAZING !!  I made them exactly as the recipe except for the chocolate. I used chocolate chips (I couldn't find any bars) I mixed dark chocolate with some milk chocolate (about 75% of the amount of the dark and 25% milk choco) Thanks for sharing.

Yummy!  I made this for a Christmas Eve dessert and it turned out wonderfully.  It's very rich, though-have a tall glass of milk with this one!  I used bittersweet Ghirardelli chocoalte chips instead.

The only thing keeping me from giving this 5 stars is the fact that it didn't really have a lava filling, it was just a DELICIOUS, fudgy cake.

I found this to be tedious, requiring a separate step to make the "lava" balls, and I found the cake somewhat on the dry side.  I prefer lava cakes to be gushy.  The flavor was good.
Perhaps baking it for a minute or two less might help.

Prepare the ramekins and make the chocolate balls ahead. If you do you can pop this out at the last moment. Your guests will be VERY impressed.  I put some Creme Anglaise under it and garnished with berries. 

The only part that isn't perfectly clear is step 5. Use a stand mixer and turn the mixture on high. Just let it run for 4-5 minutes. The mixture will take on the constancy of a thickened cream.

Absolutely wonderful. I didn't have any since everyone wanted seconds and ate them all. The compliments were flying and since they're easy to make, we're having them again today. This time I made a double batch of the chocolate centers because I have a feeling I'll be making them again really soon! I also topped them with homemade whipped cream. My son wanted to help and we had so much fun, which was a big bonus. Thanks for the recipe!

Amazing!  I have attempted Lava Cakes before, however none of them had much of a gooey center.  The making of the chocolate balls beforehand is genius.  I did not use the Ghirardelli bar, I used the chips and it was no problem.

WAY TOO RICH! the filling in the middle was rich to the point of bitter. Next time i would add sugar to the filling, or just use semi-sweet or milk chocolate. At this point, I don't know if i would even make these again...

I give four out of five stars because while the cake itself turned out beautifully the inside was just a little too bitter for my taste.  I've tried to do it a couple of other different ways, but I just can't make the gooey inside to my liking enough to continue attempting this recipe.

These were pretty good.  But, I dunno, seemed a little time consuming and expensive for the small yield.

I have made other lava cakes before but these were far superior. A little more work initially but worth it in the end!!

I did a trial run before serving the dessert to my guests.  The first time I made the cake,  it was a little over cooked and I didn't have the lava melting out.  I thought it also needed just a little bit more sugar.
The  day my guests came over.  I cooked it for 12 min and added a 1/2 cup of sugar instead of 1/3.  It came out perfect.

These were pretty good.  Not the best I've had tho. The only thing I changed was I used Ghirardelli semi-sweet choc. for the filling, only because I have a lil sweet tooth. I put the filling in mini cupcake liners and threw them in the refrigerator, then popped them out into the batter instead of rolling into balls, Less mess. Served with whip cream and I made a raspberry sauce, but served it on the side, as not everyone likes raspberries in my house. Would make a beautiful presentation tho.

Good taste but way too much butter.  They were greasy and crumbly.  I cooked for the exact amount of time and the center was almost dry.  They did easily slip out of the ramekin though.  I will try another recipe with less butter

I didn't have ramekins so I used muffin tins. I baked at 400 for 12 minutes and I used a semi sweet center because I love sweets. I noticed it's best to let the balls freeze and use small sized ones. Do not pour all batter, make sure you save some for after adding the ball to cover it. If not they tend to cave in at the canter and the bottom won't hold. Delicious though:)

First time and they came out PERFECT. SUPERB. I was afraid of using too much dark choco considering i prefer sweet so i just replaced 1 oz of bittersweet for semi-sweet, next time i'll try 50/50. I added a small scoop of TALENTI vanilla ice cream to soften. Delicious!

I have made lots of chocolate lava cakes using different recipes but i could never perfect it because it needed right timing. Most of the recipes require you to undercook the cake so there would be chocolate lava inside. This is the first time i finally got it right. It is not undercooked cake. This recipe provides for a perfectly cooked cake with lava inside. Lots of thumbs up.

Pretty major disaster.  I did freeze the centers before baking but they all disappeared anyway.  The temperature is too high.  They were burned in 12 minutes.  I personally do not like dark chocolate.  I made these for my wife's birthday.  She said what she could eat did taste good.  I wi;ll try again at a lower temperature and perhaps a slightly smaller serving size.

This recipe was great but I believe that 60% bittersweet chocolate is a bit too rich for my liking. Although, I used a ganache I had made the day before to fill chocolates which was made with semisweet chocolate. Other than that I was extremely satisfied with the results. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Great. Just great. It was all okay but the plates were terrible. But the food was good so 5 stars. Something I changed, instead of double boiler I use a microwave and it melted just fine if you use it for 15 seconds on half power

The recipe turned out without any problems and was fairly easy to make, but we thought it tasted terrible. The cake part was extremely dry and the filling was lacking ooziness even when eaten immediately. I did like someones idea of adding a little chambourd to the filling.

Absolutely delicious. But I need help. I don't have ramekins so I used non stick muffin pans instead. My problem is that the bottom always stick to the muffin pan and when I invert it out, there is a hole in the center. Even though I have tried to butter the pan first as well as butter the pan and then sprinkle with sugar or cocao powder, it always have the bottom center stuck to the pan leaving the cake with a hole in the center and some of the lava flows out. It still taste incredible, just does not look perfect. Any help from anyone would be appreciated. thanks

This is a good recipe, but what makes the center even better is a little less butter and a Tbsp or so of Chambord.

Turned out exactly as I'd hoped!  I baked mine in four large, greased, ceramic cereal bowls and turned them out onto individual serving plates when they finished baking.  Topped with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream, these were fantastic!

I have made lava cakes before but was excited to try this ghirardelli version.  Honestly, I was not that impressed.  The chocolate flavor was of course delicious, but the amount of work that went into it wasn't worth the hassle.  

Baking at 400 for 15 minutes seemed too long and the balls at the center were delicious, but kind of annoying.  

I will stick to my favorite 5 ingredient molten lava cake recipe :-)

These were easy to make and delicious.  I did use semi sweet chips instead and microwaved them (with the heavy cream and then again with the butter) instead of using the double boiler and had no trouble.  I've had trouble in the past with molten cakes breaking apart when removing them from the ramekins so this time I just left them in there when serving.  They look nice in the ramekins anyway!

This was our Christmas dinner dessert. I made this 3 days before we cooked it and just stored it in the fridge. Put some cool whip and thawed raspberries on the side of it. Easier than I thought it would be, it was my first effort at using a double boiler.

Made this as New Year's Eve desert.  I liked that I could put it together early then pop it in the oven when we were ready for it. Steps were easy to follow and presentation was beautiful. The only issue I ran into was the lava wasn't very lava-like.  It didn't flow as I expected.  But I think this was my fault as I baked them a little longer than called for.  Despite the thick lava, the taste was amazing, everyone asked for more... too bad they were single servings :)

I made these lava cakes for a dinner party and they were a hit! They were not too sweet and very moist. If you don't have ramekins, this recipe makes about 8 cupcakes. I added a raspberry sauce and balsamic glaze to these cakes. Delicious!

not the greatest I have had, definitely for those that like dark chocolate and as others had said could either use more sugar or sweeter tasting chocolate. the cake part is a little dense to my liking. otherwise they turned out beautiful.

What you bake in makes a difference. Plus cut a circle of baking paper in the bottom. Even greasing does not stop it from sticking

I found this recipe so I could use up the extra ganache that I had made previously.  I didn't have enough ramekins so I baked the cakes in stemless wine glasses. I left the cakes in the glass and put a scoop of ice cream on top with fresh berries. They looked and tasted great!

Made with only 1 TB coconut oil, 1 loose cup of Costco chocolate truffles, upped to 1/2 c sugar, added 3/4 c of fat free Greek yogurt to batter at end. Amazing!

I will definitely make these again! I was searching for a lava center cake that does not have to be left raw in the center (usually requiring lots of undercooked eggs, and they were made for my sister's birthday who is 3 months pregnant). They turned out delicious!! So rich and chocolatey! I added crushed roasted hazelnuts to a few of the centers and they were even better!

This recipe was super easy to make and turned out very good!

I made the following changes:
- Used Splenda for sugar
- Microwaved chocolate on 50% for both centers and cake
- Used chocolate chips
- Sifted cake flour
- Using cupcake tin rather than ramekin
- Formed balls with cookie dough scoop
- Topped with a lightly sweetened topping
- Whisked by hand for a few more minutes

I used chocolate chips because they were cheaper per oz.  I used microwave on 50% (or defrost) because it would cool faster in fridge so I don't have to wait 2 hours.  I waited like 20 minutes instead.  I actually put it in freezer for last 5.  I don't like touching my food, so I used a small cookie dough scoop.  Note: This does make them a little bigger than what they might normally be.  I only got 3 lava cakes with this recipe.

I created a lighly sweet topping using Crema + powdered sugar.  Splenda or sugar would have worked just fine too.  I love the flexibility of crema and also use it in savory Mexican dishes.

I paired it with Talenti's Coffee Toffee Frozen yogurt and topped the cake with raspberries.  (See my photos.)

Things I would do differently in future:
- Use milk chocolate chips
- Use 1/4 cup butter + 1/4 cup of canola oil
- Top with chocolate shavings instead of raspberries
- Use expresso in the cake batter since I like the lava cake with coffee ice cream

NOTE: You don't have to worry about filling your ramekin or cupcake tin beyond 1/2 way.  Since there is no baking soda or baking powde

The "lava" filling was amazing. Disappears on your tongue immediately.  The cake part was a little more egg-y than I like. Flavor was good, but just not what I expected.  But the lava, though... Considering eating it from a spoon and nixing the cake next time.

This was a great treat for my family, but it only made 4 cakes (my ramekins may have been a little bit bigger). I'm giving this 4 stars because the chocolate truffle in the middle took a really long time to become firm. But, overall it tasted amazing!

For the cake flour, I used 1.5 tsp cornstarch and the rest all-purpose flour. Otherwise, did not modify.

It came out great - VERY rich, and not overly sweet. You have to want something that tastes like strong, rich dark chocolate. Not like birthday cake.

This recipe is so easy to make. I loved the fact that I could do it ahead of time and bake it the following day. The chocolate ganache for the centers was too soft to work with but I put it in the freezer and scooped out small teaspoons into a mini cupcake holder. Dusted with powdered sugar, served with vanilla ice cream and a drizzle of caramel sauce.  Awesome taste of chocolate heaven!

I think I might have over cooked it. The center was not liquid chocolate but kind of hard. Flavor was good so I will try again another time. Reheats well in the microwave and stove.

Amazing and so special for Christmas dessert!
A bar of chocolate is 4 oz which I didn't realize until I began cooking.  I used 2 oz of tollhouse chocolate pieces for the center.  Didn't get stuff so divided into 6 scoops and froze until placed in cake mix.  They were wonderful

This recipe is easy to make, but I think the cake part tastes somewhat boring and doesn't match up against the filling.  If I make it again, I plan to use a full teaspoon of vanilla and maybe more chocolate for the cakes.

I'm a pretty good cook and I followed this perfectly, but every single one of them stuck, half were burned within 7 minutes, and the lava centre wasn't lava at all, just slightly moister than the rest. Having said all that, they tasted nice enough for my family to eat the non-burnt ones straight from the ramekins, but I wasn't able to serve them for our dinner party like I was hoping.

These were so hugely successful at two recent dinner parties I hosted. I baked and served them in individual ramekins with chocolate covered strawberries and cream. This will be made often in the future.

Oh, this was heavenly. Especially with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on it(didn't have raspberries). However, a word of caution: I changed the servings to 8 and it only made 5. Hmm, maybe my ramekins where larger than what was used here?

Delicious but not my favorite version of this dessert. Served with some creme anglais and fresh whipped cream. Used semi-sweet chocolate for the lava center. Cake is quite dense due to the chocolate-to-flour ratio. I prefer this dessert with a lighter cake surrounding the molten center.

This was my first time making lava cake although i have eaten it many times.  This recipe was very good.  I did not use Ghirardelli chocolate but it was still good.  I will definitely be making this recipe again.  :)

Super easy, came out with molten center, soft outside. But the flavor seemed a bit lacking. Probably won't make again.

Made this exactly as the recipe specifies and it came out perfect.  Gave the filling plenty of time to harden before forming into balls (it melts very quickly), and then placed back into the fridge - took them out and put on cake batter right before putting everything into the oven.  I love dark chocolate, and this really hit the spot.  Over all, not too much trouble for something very delicious!

I don't like dark chocolate, so I used milk chocolate chips instead of the bittersweet baking bar. The centers never did harden enough to make balls. It might have worked better if I'd used the milk chocolate bar (it's hard to ensure exactly 2 ounces of chips). It tasted fantastic, but there was no lava in the middle...the truffle 'melted' into the rest of the cake.  Guess I'll just have to keep trying. Everyone loved the way it tasted.
