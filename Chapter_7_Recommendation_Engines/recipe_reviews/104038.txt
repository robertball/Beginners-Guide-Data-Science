I made this recipe this past weekend for a family get-together. It was a big hit. I was pleasantly surprised and this will definitely be a recipe I make for the holidays.

Wow.  I thought these were fantastic.  I used all Splenda Brown sugar because that's all I had - and oil instead of butter.  It worked great - although they were probably denser than the original recipe.  I think you could also decrease the amount of chocolate chips and still have plenty for great taste.

YUM! i just made this as regular sized muffins and they came out great. I used whole wheat flour instead of white and plain splenda instead of splend sugar blend. Overall they are very moist and yummy. It made about 18 regular sized muffins!!

Awesome recipe. My 3 year old diabetic daughter loved them.  I even substituted the splenda blend for just splenda to reduce sugar and still worked wonderfully.
