Made this exactly as directed and found it to be not at all too sweet.  I have switched from using the elbow macaroni to a whole 16 oz box of rotini and the amount of sauce is still enough.  I have found that making the sauce the day before and then adding it to the chilled macaroni just before serving makes a creamier salad and it isn't absorbed by the pasta.  Love it love it love it!

I am rating this recipe 5 stars because the basis for the dressing is SO good!!  I did make some changes, but I think it is just a very versatile recipe.  I used miracle whip instead of mayo, apple cider vinegar instead of white and half the sugar called for.  I used white onion (I didn't have any red ones, although I would have preferred that!!) and some cold left over frozen sweet peas as the ones in the can would be too mushy.  I used cucumber, and chopped boiled egg.  I made this at the last minute, as we decided to grill burgers on our grill, even though we are thigh deep in snow! Hahah!!  It was great even after 45 minutes in the fridge, but it was creamy.  We ate leftovers for lunch today and loved it even more!  Will definitely make again.  I have a family of 5 and by cutting the recipe in half, we didn't have too much leftover!

This is a great recipe.  Like others, I added 3 hard-boiled eggs.  I cut the sugar back to 1/4 cup and the vinegar by half.  I then added 2 and 1/2 tablespoons of sweet pickle relish and 1 teaspoon of garlic powder.

Great macaroni salad and definitely classic picnic food!  Everyone has their own take on these types of things and I adjusted this to my own taste preferences as well.  I used lite mayo and cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup.  I used 2 Tbsp. of mustard, one yellow and one dijon and next time I might cut back on that just a bit.  I added 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder and 4 hard boiled eggs.  I left out the green pepper and used a bunch of chopped green onions.  I did add the carrots and a 5 oz. jar of drained and chopped green olives with pimento peppers.  This reminds me a lot of what my Grandma used to make every summer.

Well I went ahead and made this according to the author after reading the reviews saying it was to sweet because I tend to like savory things sweetened a little. This was disgustingly sweet to the point of tasting like it was a macaroni dessert. Everything else was ok but the dish was ruined due to the sugar content. I'd start with a few tablespoons maybe up to 1/4 of a cup but the original amount was WAY to much.

i think the dressing is fantastic.  it's a little sweet, a little zingy from the vinegar, a little mustardy, it all blends well.  i truly love it... just not on macaroni.  i think the dressing would be a star on potatoes... to make potato salad.  also, next time i'll just add a splash of vinegar because it made my dressing runny rather than creamy.  --- UPDATE --- i tried the dressing again with potatoes and it was heavenly!  all i did was decrease the sugar portion to about half a cup... yum yum.  (just a note - after a day, the sweetness cuts down.)

Used only ¼ cup of sugar…that was plenty. Also added a decent amount of paprika and garlic powder. Also, I would recommend using the diced pimentos- they really add a lot of flavor and color. Be sure to refrigerate overnight, it is much better the next day.

Classic is the key word here ... nothing to pretty it up, nothing to add additional flavors, nothing to create a "change" ... just a perfect, classic recipe everyone will love!  I not only think its perfect as is, but is also the best base for getting crazy with your own preferences.  Here are a few suggestions/hints I have found to be helpful ... some reviews have mentioned it too runny, too sweet, too much onion, or needing some chopped egg, I personally found the "runny" dressing to substancially thicken up overnight in the fridge, but if you are serving within an hour or two of making, I'd suggest tossing with partial dressing and saving the rest to add if necessary just prior to serving that way you control the wetness.  I actually prefer adding a bit of dressing to give it a little fresh kick just before the serve.  As for the sugar, I have found a little less is needed if you use white vinegar and mayo, but all is needed if using apple cider and miracle whip. It also aids in the consistency of the dressing.  To somewhat counter the bite of the onion I chop it a bit fine to blend in better as I'm not a fan of chunky onion bites, but certainly using less is an easy fix. As for the chopped egg, its one of those preference things but often a "must" for some so throw it in there. Same with adding cheese, or mini shrimp, or other veggies, there is no limit to personalizing this perfect start.  But, for a fresh, classic macaroni salad, you won't go wrong with "as is" either!

5 star though a tad on the sweet side for me, but perfect for my hubby's taste buds.  Reminiscent of a cole slaw dressing and immediately after mixing the dressing all you can taste is sweet, but this dressing blends beautifully after chilling for 4+ hours and settles right down.  Many reviewers noted that the dressing was runny; to counteract that, I added 1/2 the sauce after draining the macaroni and let sit for an hour.  This allowed the macaroni to absorb the dressing and gave it an added flavor boost.  Much like other reviewers, I added and subtracted to suit the family's preferences, ie., eggs, green onions, etc., but the dressing is really what makes this salad outstanding.  Served this with a pork tenderloin recipe from FoodNetwork.  The spicy sauce on the tenderloin was a perfect counter for the sweetness of the salad.  Outstanding and definitely worthy of 5 stars which are not to be given lightly!

I was in charge of making macaroni salad for 125 teenage girls at a retreat. I used this recipe (times 12!). The salad was a huge hit. That's really saying something considering how picky teen girls can be. 

I've been trying to find a good macaroni salad recipe for years ever since I tried some at a great Hawaiian restaurant. Nothing has really satisfied me til now. This recipe is a keeper.

The only thing I did differently was to not rinse the noodles but add the vinegar right after draining. That's what Cooks Illustrated recommends when making mac salad.

This recipe delivers a delicious, classic macaroni salad that most people will love. The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly and it was a big hit at a bbq we had. Subsequent times, I tweaked things around so it would fit our tastes more closely, and now it's a commonly requested item at potlucks, bbqs, and family dinners.  The changes I've made are as follows: a) I cut the mustard (ha) in half  b) I decrease the sugar to 1/3 cup c) I leave out the listed veggies and instead add eggs, sweet pickles, 4T pimentos, and green onions d) I double the dressing recipe and put half on to make the salad then add the other half after 4 hours.   This is also a great salad to toss in crab - it adds quite a great flavor!

This is an excellent macaroni salad!  Having only ever had macaroni salad with plain mayo as dressing...I was a little scared when I started putting the dressing ingredients together. I tasted a small helping immediately after mixing in the veggies and pasta, and it tasted really sweet....HOWEVER...I just had another helping after it has been refrigerated for about 3 hours and it is just yummy!! All the flavors really came together and it's not too sweet or too tangy. Also, the dressing/pasta ratio is perfect, just the right amount of moistness.   As for presentation....I love the yellow color that is had from the mustard...and I'm glad I decided to add the shredded carrots. The orange and green colors from the veggies make this a very pretty dish. I left out the pimentos, simply because I forgot to buy them.  This yummy, refreshing salad will definately be showing up this summer during cookouts and picnics.  I think next time I make this, I might try adding hard boiled eggs, cubed cheese or diced ham.

I just love this recipe.  It's the closest that I could find to my Mom's homemade macaroni sald.  I do not add the carrot because not everyone likes them and I love the touch of yellow mustard.

This is a great recipe AS-IS. 

I will mention that the amount of sugar seems like a lot, but if you allow it to sit overnight (or longer) it tastes so better. The next time I made it I did cut the sugar to 1/4 t and it was really good immediately, but after sitting overnight it was very bland. I keep this in mind if I'm making it for right away, or for an event in the next couple of days.

I've made this for several food days and family events. It's almost always the first one gone and I get many rave reviews :)

This recipe was INCREDIBLE!!!!! We loved it!!! I used 1/8 cup of apple cider vinegar and 1/8 cup of white vinegar, and used green onion rather than red or white onion. The pimento was such a great addition! This is BY FAR the best mac salad I have ever made!!! THANKS SO MUCH for submitting it!!!!

My family LOVES this mac salad! I read all reviews and cut the sugar amount in half and used Apple cider vinegar. Definitely chill the macaroni separately from the dressing and add right before you serve it. Makes a world of difference! I think I have one serving left...

I love this recipe and have made a variation of it for years.  Instead of mixing up the mayo, vinegar, and sugar though, I mix the about 1/3 mayo with 2/3 salad dressing and cut back slightly on the mustard.  I too add an egg and because I think celery is what tends to make the leftover salad watery (well, if you have leftver), I leave it out and use celery seed instead.  I also like to use red pepper instead of green and add a cup of cubed sharp cheddar cheese.  This is a very versatile salad and always go over big with family and friends.

I (we) LOVED THIS!  The only problem I had was it was kinda runny so after reading many other recipes I decided to add in 1 (16 oz.) container of sour cream and it was perfect, nice & creamy! I also used red onion & instead of a whole green pepper I used 1/2 red pepper & 1/2 green pepper. Thanks so much for the recipe, I told my husband we will never again buy store made macaroni salad!

I loved this recipe.  I read many other reviews and also many a few changes.  Because there are only 2 of us I downsized the recipe.  I used green onions finely chopped, and yellow, orange and red peppers finley diced. I used less than 1/4 cup sugar. I used 1 tbsp white & 1 tbsp cider vinegar.  I used 1 tbsp Dijon & 1/2 tbsp dry mustard. I also used Mircale Whip and added 2 tbsp sour cream.  For more color I added 1/3 cup frozen peas and corn and sprinkled smokey paprika.  I also added 4 strips and cooked bacon coarsely chopped.  It was the first time in many years I have made this type of salad and I will make it again.  Thanks to you all for your reviews...

This recipe was a definite ol' time classic macaroni salad! My husband's family from CT loved this when they came into town.  I picked this out and it was a big hit amongst all the family! Wouldn't change anything!

WOW!  Fabulous-haven't had macaroni salad this good since we left New York.  Just like they make in the NY deli's.   I followed the directions  exactly but left out the carrots and pimentos.  I also used different colored peppers I would also suggest making it a day ahead, it tastes better the longer it sits in the fridge.

I tripled the recipe for a picnic. I didn't add the carrots or pimento peppers. I used a combination of white vinegar and apple cider vinegar because I didn't have enough of the white. Worked great. Also, I ran out of regular mustard so I used dijon and again, worked great. Due to the reviews, I decided to play it safe and reduce the amount of sugar by half. Seemed perfect. I made it the night before and the flavors were great the next day. I didn't reserve any of the dressing for the next day but I do see where it would be nice for people who like creamier salad to add some at the last minute. However, I thought it was great regardless. I chopped all the veggies really small because I don't like having huge chunks of any particular thing stand out. The flavor distributes better in my opinion, when everything is chopped small.

Loved it!  Best I have ever had.  I halved the recipe, but only used about a quarter of a small onion which I will eliminate next time as I thought it was too much.  I did add a small chopped carrot and used 1/2 each of a chopped green and red pepper for color.  I started with a reduced amt of sugar as some thought it was too sweet, but ended up adding the full amt (1/3 c. for half a recipe.)

This was great! I made it for a BBQ at our house.  I did change a few minor things: 1) like other suggested I cut the sugar in half and it was definitely sweet enough for all of us, 2) I added sliced green olives (delicious!), and 3) I added 3 cut up boiled eggs.  I had my doubts about the vinegar, but it really added a nice flavor (plus not having to use as much mayo is a bonus as well).

Super sweet. I even added more noodles and lowered the sugar amount. Definitely not eating again. If you like sweet macaroni salad, this is the one for you. If you prefer a more savory tasting one, this isn't the one for you.

If you like a sweet macaroni salad than look no further!! I tried to fix the sweetness by adding more mayo,mustard and vinegar but it is beyond repair.

My husband refused to eat it and went to get carry out.  This was embarrassing!!  This was absolutely terrible!!  I added only 1/4 cup as opposed to 2/3 cup of sugar and it was way too sweet.  This is just a terrible recipe.  My husband wanted to give it to a widowed elderly neighbor and I asked him -- "what did he ever do to you?!"   I'll stick with the tried and true -- Mayo/sour cream basic recipe.

This is a great recipe for mac salad.  I spent 10 years in Hawaii and ever since have looked for a mac recipe like the ones I found at the local lunch counter.  It's great.

Too sweet...I should have known better when I saw the ingredient list (sugar, and mustard? never had a macaroni salad with mustard in it) but went ahead and tried it anyway...had to pour it all into a strainer and rinse, rinse, rinse to salvage my macaroni. Ended up with a true classic macaroni salad by using 1/2 cup of Mayo, 1/2 cup of Miracle whip, 1/2 cup sour cream, onion, celery, green pepper, salt and pepper to taste.

I found this recipe to be WAY too sweet and it called for ALOT of onions. I tasted it a few hours after I made it and all those onions practically burned my mouth... and I really do like onions. I wouldn't make this again, because I think it was inedible.

The recipe is a real good one... Until it came down to the sugar. Macaroni salad should NOT have that amount of sugar!! I only made half the recipe- every other ingredient as called for. From there I added 1/2 Tbs. sugar as needed to aquire desired taste. DO NOT add the full amount of sugar called for unless you want a sickeningly SWEET mac salad! I think its nearly a better alternative to skip sugar all together & use some sweet relish. Otherwise, a good, decent mac salad... I also diced up some cheddar cheese & threw it in for a personal preference- turned out wonderful & I wish I had made the full amount after seeing how fast it was devoured!! Will absolutely make again- just no sugar. Substituting with sweet relish is a better, more appetizing option. Or just leave out the sugar- it really does not need it (especially if you are using Miracle Whip which is on the sweeter side).
UPDATE: after making this several more times, everyone has agreed the sugar called for is outrageous. We start with 1Tbsp. and add more as needed. Also, adding in 3-4 hard boiled eggs is a very nice twist! And we substituted peas for the celery while leaving out green bell pepper. This is a dish that always disappears, and very popular. Just needs some minor changes.

this is definitely a keeper, and very versatile!  I did use half the sugar, and it was still a tad on the too-sweet side. Also used red pepper, didn't opt for the pimentos, & added some frozen peas and canned tuna. One of those stand-by recipes for BBQ's and summer potlucks! yummmm

I made an account just to give this a proper rating.
This salad is RIDICULOUSLY sweet.  I even tried adding extra sour cream to try and neutralize some of the sweetness, but it could not be saved.  
Please don't be fooled by the 5 star reviews.  Everyone should stop giving this a good review if you HAD to change the amount of sugar.  I'm sure if the people giving this positive reviews left the recipe in tact it would be inedible for many people-- and therefore not worthy of a positive review!
Please stop rating recipes based on your modifications.  
I feel very cheated.

Excellent recipe. I have never cared for macaroni salad, absolutely can't stand store bought, so I made this for my husband. Served it at a party and everyone loved it. Even me. I read several reviews and used the following suggestions; double the ingredients for the dressing escept cut the sugar in half. MAKE THE NIGHT BEFORE! It will be runny but letting it sit overnight the noodles will absorbe the dressing, blending all the flavours and leaving it with just the right consistancy. I have made it with and without the carots either way is great. I don't like pimento so I leave that out and add sliced black olives.

Sickeningly sweet..... Use 1/4 cup of sugar instead of 2/3 of a cup unless you want your Mac salad to taste like a Jolly Rancher.

LOVE THIS and so does my family :). I don't use pimentos and I found that 4 cups of noodles is too much. 2.5-3 cups is just perfect to coat them perfectly. Also, don't rinse the noodles. Pour the dressing over them while they're still hot and refridgerate.

Love this recipe.  Last time I made this I used leftover noodles that were already cold - the salad was tons more creamy.  Will be doing that again for sure.

Classic.  Excellent.  To improve the nutrition of the salad, I prefer to cut the sugar to 1/4 cup and the salt to 1 tsp as well as use reduced-fat mayo.  It still tastes wonderful. We also mix up what we use as add-ins.  Current fav: cheddar cubes, blanched broccoli florets, fresh English peas and a small amount of diced red pepper (mostly for colour).

My husband said I should say this was excellent. It was quite good and pretty easy to make.  I did not use the peppers or the pimentos, didn't have them. I did add some cubed sharp cheddar cheese. Also sprinkled w/ dill weed before I mixed it. It was very good.  Once we have cherry tomatoes in the garden, I think I will add those, too. Quick and easy and good...... it all makes a great recipe.

Not that this yummy dish needs another positive review, but I do have to say, this is one of the tastiest pasta dishes I have made.  After eating this as a side dish, I like to mix the leftovers with tuna and bring to lunch at work the next day.

Excellent and very simple to prepare.  I did up the sauce by 50% as it seemed a little dry after sitting in the fridge a few hours.  I skipped the celery and added cubed cheddar instead.  I also used green onion vs. the regular kind.

I only used green pepper, celery and onion in my macaroni salad and as other users suggested I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup.  It seemed too sweet until I added a squirt of yellow mustard, then it was perfect.  I refrigerated it overnight and it was delicious for our barbeque the next day.

Awesome!  Don't freak out if dressing seems soupy at first.  Once chilled overnight, it has the perfect consistency.  THE DRESSING IS THE KEY!!  Add or subtract whatever you want. (I substituted green onion, deleted green pepper and added celery seed, paprika, 3 chopped eggs, and 1/2 C shredded cheese.) You can't screw it up!

I had high hopes for the receipe based on all the great reviews. I found is horribly too sweet. I wished I would have read more of the reviews regarding this. I will try it again with only half, maybe less, than the amount of sugar called for.

The first time I made this recipe, I did not read any other reviews. I made this exactly as written, and had the "bad feeling" about the 2/3 cup of sugar (and I used raw sugar, as I don't eat anything refined/over processed). It was TOO sweet. 

The next time I made this, I changed it quite a bit: First, I omitted the sugar altogether.  I used Apple Cider Vinegar instead, and used German mustard. I add more celery and carrots, and half of a jalapeno (very finely chopped). I don't add pimentos, but I do add some cubed sharp cheddar cheese. I try to cube it small enough so that every forkful has a bit of cheese. Sometimes I add paprika, depending on whether or not I remember.

My boyfriend will gladly eat the entire dish in one sitting, but if I ration him, it'll last him and I about two days (using it as a side, and sometimes as the main entree). I hope I've helped!

Overall this dish is really good but the onion was very overpowering. I will leave that out next time maybe use green onion or dried onion instead.

This is my go-to recipe for macaroni salad since the first time I made it. Everything a classic should have, nothing it shouldn't. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because it calls for way more sugar than I think is necessary. I cut it in half and it's plenty sweet enough. I could probably cut back a bit more and still be satisfied. If making it for the first time, I would recommend starting out with half (or less) the amount of sugar than the recipe states and see what you think. You can always add more, if that's your preference.

So sweet with sharp onion flavor when you bit into one, since it was such a strong contrast. No balance of flavor at all. No one liked it and thought it was way too sweet.

I have made this several times with different variations. I always eliminate the green pepper (personal preference), and sometimes add small-diced cheddar cheese. Other times I add chopped pimento-stuffed  green olives. The onion varys according to the season. I can't always find good-looking green onions, altho I do like them. This is a very versatile recipe that you can personalize. It's definitely a "keeper"!
Thanks for publishing it again, especially for those who might not have it.

I love macaroni salad, and since I have found this recipe, it's the only one I make. I have yet to try a macaroni salad that I like better than this one. Letting it sit for several hours or overnight is a MUST. I don't use the optional items. The only change I made was using less sugar (1/3 cup) - I have tried it with the full amount and it definitely tastes better with less. This is one of my very favorite recipes on this site, I make it all the time and I am often asked to bring this to get-togethers.

Not to my liking. A very specific taste I've never experienced in a macaroni salad - sickly sweet. Think about it: there's almost as much sugar as mayonnaise in this recipe. Nearly ruined my picnic. Awful, would never make this again!

This was very good for a "salad potluck" at work one day. I made a few changes based on the reviews of others: -use red onion. -add hard boiled eggs (approx. 3) -half the amount of sugar. -half the vinegar. -1/2 tsp garlic powder I also used red wine vinegar, because that was all I had.

This is NOT what I think of when I think of a "Classic" macaroni salad. I followed this recipe to the letter and had a really bad feeling when I dumped 2/3 cup of sugar into the dressing. I should have followed my gut and left it out. The sugar gave this dish a bad flavor.  I was EMBARRASSED to serve it to my in-laws, but had no choice since I didn't want to waste all that cooked pasta. They were polite enough to eat it but pointed out immediately the overly SUGARY flavor. Do yourself a favor and find a recipe that does not include sugar and there was definitely too much of a mustard flavor.

This is a very yummy macaroni salad. I halved the recipe though because I was the only one eating it. I read alot of reviews and it seemed like alot said it was too sweet so I added the sugar slowly until I found it just right, I ended up using only half of what was called for. I didn't use celery or peppers as I had none and used 2 eggs. I was making it to eat for lunch so I used only half the dressing at first but reserved the rest for tomorrow if it needs more. I do agree with another review that this would be even better with potato salad and will try it. I will definately be making this dressing over and over again, thanks for sharing. UPDATE: I just made this with potatoes and it turned out even better then with the macaroni. I still added the 2 eggs as it adds more flavor to it. I made the macaroni salad once with no eggs and it was kind of bland like it was missing something, so adding the eggs adds alot of flavor.

As written, I thought this recipe had far too much sugar -- I cut it down by more than half.  Otherwise, I thought it was delicious.  Instead of prepared mustard (which I don't much care for) I used Dijon mustard, and it was really nice.  It wasn't 'yellow', and I think it gives a nicer flavour.  Because I'm not too fond of raw onion generally, I think that next time I'll try it with pickled onions.  I liked that the dressing wasn't too heavy, unlike most pasta salad dressings I've tried.  Thanks!  (Oh yeah, my boyfriend loved it!  And he's the "pasta salad" connoisseur... lol)___ Update:  I omitted the onions altogether this time, but used 1 each of a red and green pepper, the celery and grated carrot, and I added beets.  Delicious!!  And soooo pretty!  (Note: I didn't use pickled beets -- I buy fresh beets and then roast them in foil in the oven for about an hour at 350.  When they cool, I peel them and slice them.)

This is my go-to recipe for potlucks.  I add 3 boiled eggs and 3 cans tuna, plus canned peas. I do reduce the sugar by 1/4. The key is making it the day before so the flavors can blend and the sauce can soak into the noodles.

This is a salad I will add to my favorite collection. My daughter loves this salad. So easy to make with a sweet taste. It is an easy recipe to make and take to a pot luck dinner. I used medium shell pasta because I love the way the sauce gets caught in the crevices of the pasta-yum! I did cut back on the mustard and only used less than a Tablespoon and I used 1/2 cup of onions only because the onion I had was a very strong tasting onion.

This is an awesome salad recipe. I found it works best if I make the dressing and refrigerate it for an hour or so before mixing with the vegetables and macaroni - it's thicker and creamier and sticks together better.

I used a 1 lb box of elbow macaroni, 1/2 c Miracle Whip light, 1 tsp vinegar, 1 tsp sugar, 1 tsp mustard, omitted salt, pepper, salt free Emeril's Essence, 2 green onions, 2stalks celery, 1 red pepper, 2 carrots, 2 hard boiled eggs, all finely diced, added FF Ranch and FF sour cream until it was wet enough. Very good, just like Grandma used to make.

Definitely the best macaroni salad I've ever made - and I've made A LOT.  If you don't like it too sweet, reduce the sugar just a bit.

My husband LOVES this macaroni salad.  It reminds me of the classic summer backyard barbecue.  Just the right amount of sweet and tangy.

Delicious! I omit the mustard, (not a classic macaroni salad ingredient) and used only a tablespoon of sugar. I use dill pickle juice instead of plain vinegar, and some chopped up pickles too. Didn't use bell pepper or pimento (didn't have any). Wonderful, addictive! Hint: best the day after. Just add a few tablespoons of milk or dill pickle juice to moisten it up before serving again, since the pasta soaks up a lot of the dressing.

First turn off was the bright yellow color and I put less than half of the mustard called for. No one in my family ate more after the first bite except for me, who now has to eat e whole dish myself otherwise it will go to waste. Sorry.

Great dressing for macaroni, although we did find it a tad too sweet.  So, will make that adjustment when made again.

Needed something for an easy side dish from things i had on hand.  This worked well.  Made 1/2 batch and it still made a lot! Did cut back on the sugar and skipped the celery and pimento.  Used a red bell pepper, sliced carrots, onion, and diced cheddar cheese. Tasted even better the next day.  Will make a day ahead if i can next time.

Not sure why this is called a Classic Macaroni Salad. Way too sweet and watery. Not creamy at all. Was attempting to show my son how easy it is to make a Mac Salad and we threw these ingredients together without altering the recipe.

I made this as is except I left out the onion and added chopped green pepper.  At first it was a bit sweet but by the time I served it the next day, most of the dressing had been absorbed by the pasta and it was AWESOME! Not too sweet at all. I loved it and I'm not a big macaroni salad fan. My mother-in-law loved it. Everyone loved it.  I'm making it again for Memorial Day.

This is entirely too sweet.  I couldn't eat more than a few bites.  My kid wouldn't even eat it.  The overall taste is okay, but needs only about 1/5 of the sugar.

This wasn't bad....not sure it was what I wanted, but all the same it wasn't bad. Did modify it a bit. Used half an onion instead of whole, cut sugar down to 1/2 c and used Splenda instead of sugar. Did add some cubed cheddar cheese after I making it, as it seemed to lack something else, cheese added well to taste.

I made this recipe for Easter a few years ago.  Ever since, at every family gathering, at every work event, church function and social event, I am mandated to make it.  I act like its a very special recipe that I don't cavalierly share - but in fact, I can make it with my eyes closed it's so easy.  It is my forever go to pot luck dish.

Much too sweet for our tastes. Not sure about adding sugar at all honestly. Especially not this much. It tasted like the boxed macaroni salad you can buy at the store, so if that's your thing, go for it. I won't bother with this again personally.  I'm sure it's popular with many but I had to spend the rest of the evening trying to adjust the sweetness out. Sorry, not for us.

This was just ok.  Not nearly enough "sauce" and I even used less macaroni than called for.  The flavor was pretty good though.  I like a sweet macaroni salad, so it worked for me.  I could see it being too sweet for some, however.  With a few minor adjustments, I'm sure this could be a great salad.

This is now my favorite cold salad recipe. I found it very easy to make, and I even tweaked it a bit adding some of my other favorite spices and cheeses. This made the cut for my summer BBQ gathering.

Fantastic recipe! I am not a big fan of macaroni salad, but after making this recipe (for my husband) I fell in love with it. The dressing gives it a nice tangy taste that is even good, maybe better the next day. I also cut back on the sugar (1/4 cup) and found it to be perfect. Super fast and easy too - always a plus.

Very good pasta salad...I also added 3 hard boiled eggs and left out carrots-didn't have any on hand. I used apple cider vinegar and yellow onion but red would be a bit tastier. I did sautee my onions until caramelized since my husband doesn't like raw onions. Excellent! Even better as it sits and overnight is phenomenal!! Will make again for parties. Used amount of sugar stated and used whole box of pasta. Was perfect!

Didn't change a thing! The first time I did notice that I should have chilled it longer as it was better the second day after being in the fridge overnight. At first, I chilled for 2 hours and it wasn't enough. So good! Looking forward to making this for all our summer picnics! Thanks for the awesome recipe :)

I love this salad! I've made it numerous times and it's my go-to recipe whenever I need to make a sharable dish. For those that thought it was too sweet... put it back in the fridge! The first time I made it I remember thinking it was oddly sweet too. But as it sits in the fridge the flavors come together and it becomes absolutely wonderful. Thanks for sharing!

I cut the sugar in half and this was still far too sweet.  Maybe this recipe is "classic" in other areas, but it's definitely not the norm for my area of Virginia.  The mustard was interesting, but I'd cut it in half *IF* I dared to try this recipe again.  I added tomatoes, as I have never had macaroni salad without them.  I also added diced cucumbers and a little more pepper.  I hope it will mellow a bit over night.  I'm not sure if I have the nerve to serve this to my guests.  It's unlike any macaroni salad I've tried around these parts...

So good.  I followed to recipe and love it!  It was just a little sweet, but the next day I added more mayo and vinegar and it was perfect for my family .  I will use this recipe always.  I think it would make great potato salad too.  Thank you so much for this great recipe.

This is a great summer salad recipe!  Cutting back on the sugar to 1/4c. is a must.  I can't imagine what it tastes like with original amount.  Used Honey Dijon in place of the yellow mustard and added crumbled bacon right before serving.  Loved the pimento peppers....to me that really enhanced the taste.

I have to preface this by saying I am not a big fan of vinegar except on French Fries.  However I thought this recipe was horrible as far as my taste buds were concerned.  I scaled it down to 5, followed it precisely and all I could tast was vinegar and dry mustard.  I literally washe it off.  Added more mayo and some dill pickle juice a a tough of hot sauce.  Now it was delicious,  I am sure this is only me, but for anyone who really doesn't care for a strong vinegar taste this may fit your needs.

Wow! I'm not a fan of pasta salads but had to bring one to our Cub Scout camp. This turned out great! And everyone else must have thought so also because the bowl was emptied - and that was even using whole wheat pasta. Only minor change was using red onion and I also added a bit of red pepper - both just to add a little color. Thank you!

Fast, Easy, and Delicous!!!!I love this macaroni salad!  This was the first time I had ever made macaroni salad, and it was great.  We started eating it as soon as I got it made.  I added just a little more oion, celery, and carrots...it's great!

Very good classic recipe. I followed the recipe, and added two hard boiled eggs as others had suggested.  I didn't think it was too sweet - it had just the right taste.  It tasted better the second day, so next time I hope to be ready enough to make it the day before I need it!!

Great recipe - exactly what I was looking for.  I did, however, took heed from some of the earlier reviews and reduced the sugar by half.  I also used apple cider vinegar because that was all I had.  In addition to that, I left out the onion because my family does not like it and added onion powder instead.  I also added a bit of Old Bay seasoning, parsley flakes, Tabasco for a kick and a tiny bit of sour cream to give a nice creamy mouthfeel.

This was awesome as is. It's just classic macaroni salad. I didn't think it tasted like dessert or that it was too sugary at all. It does need to sit for a few hours to taste right and it looks weird when it is first mixed up.

I read the reviews on this recipe and was considering adding less sugar. I actually did not quite have enough, so I did add a little less. I thought this recipe was delicious! I really liked the onion and I put in red bell pepper instead of green since that's what I had. I almost did not add the pimentos, but glad I did... I love this recipe and will definitely use it again. Thanks!

Delicious!  I used half the amount sugar (was plenty sweet with half the amount!) added 6 tbsp sour cream, 2 tomatoes, garlic powder and cayenne pepper.  Left out peppers and carrots! Came out amazing!  Definitely have to let it sit for a few hours so it isn't soupy....

Super easy and quick to make! Fresh favors with sweetness. Delicious and plentiful! Gave it four stars only because it definitely should be made a day ahead for maximum flavor . Also it calls for a lot of unhealthy sugar (but worth it). Highly recommend  stirring well before serving to restore moistness without having to add more mayo. Enjoy!

Excellent macaroni salad! I have made this a dozen or so times and each time it is devoured by my family. I did make a few changes. I cut the sugar in half and also the vinegar. I added 3 hard boiled eggs, chopped and occasionally I have added a little bit of sour cream to make it extra creamy. I usually use sweet red bell peppers in place of the green. This is truly a great classic macaroni salad!

I just made this for a family reunion and it is fantastic!  Only change I made was to use red onion and red pepper instead of green and for the mustard I used Weber's Horseradish prepared mustard.  Added a really nice kick to it. The initial taste made me want more. Not too sweet and so flavorful.  Can hardly wait to taste it tomorrow. I did make 1 and 1/2 times the dressing because I don't like dry macaroni salad plus pasta soaks up dressing as it stands. Love this recipe. Comes very close to my mother's and hers was the best! This is a real KEEPER!

This is a great pasta salad. Definitely refrigerate overnight for best flavor. I followed the recipe exactly but I did make 1 1/2 times the amount of sauce as the pasta absorbs some of it. Creamy and delicious!

yum! remember to coat the pasta in olive oil before applying the dressing.  it will keep the pasta from drying out.

When I first started making this I wasn't too sure...it looked to "wet' and seemed to have a lot of onion.  This turned out to be FANTASTIC!  I didn't have celery or carrot, so I added a large chopped onion, a small jar of drained and chopped pimentos, and about 6 small dill pickles, chopped.  I also didn't have white vinegar so I used apple cider vinegar instead.  I read a lot of reviews about this being too sweet, but I still added a scant 1/2  cup and it was perfect.  With all those onions and vinegar, you need some sweetness to tone them down.  I also thought the salt and pepper quantities were perfect as well.  One of my favorite recipes I've gotten from this site in a long time!

I like to use shell macaroni sometimes to change it up a little.  I omit the vinegar, sugar and bell peppers and add finely  diced green olives.  I would use green onions or finely diced onion about 1/2 c and dash of celery salt adds a distinct flavor.  Also add before serving about 1/2 c shredded cheese.  If taking on a picnic it is safer to omit eggs.

I have made this recipe several times and for large groups of people. Everybody just loves it. Would change nothing about it. The combo of sweet, tangy are fantastic. Easy to make.

This tasted like how a true macaroni salad should taste.  I should add though, I found the "dressing" mixture to be a little on the thin side.  I'm used to a thicker coating on my macaroni salad.  I'm guessing this is because of the lower fat mayo I used, but it could be that plus the combo of vinegar that thinned things out.  I'll probably never buy full fat mayo, so there's no way for me to confirm this.  But just thought I'd mention it in case others are also intending on using low fat mayo.  Other than that, this was spot on in taste and appearance.  Thanks for sharing!  And with any cold starchy salad (macaroni, potato, etc), leaving it in the fridge to firm up is a must.  It makes all the difference and it also gives the flavours a chance to come through

I was looking for a classic macaroni salad, but updated from the one my mom used to make.  This was delicious.  However, I used Dijon  mustard in place of the yellow, rice wine vinegar, and added hard boiled eggs.  Sprinkled with paprika.  I brought this to a barbecue and it was a hit!

I loved this salad.  I always seem to "tweak" recipes, so my changes are not a negative reflection of the original recipe.  I omitted the pimento and substituted some red bell pepper.  Also added a couple of chopped hard boiled eggs and the real "kicker" came from a jalapeno that I had on hand.  Absolutely loved the addition of the jalapeno pepper.  This was so good, that I'm making it again to take to a high school graduation party.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Warning from other reviewers on the sugar. Start small, add to taste. 1/4 cup was plenty for us. I also used Apple cider vinegar. Added eggs, sweet onion and skipped pimento. Except for that, which I'm glad I paid heed, I would have given 5 stars.

Love this salad! I did read some of the other reviews and made a few adjustments. I cut the sugar in half, added paprika, garlic powder, used yellow bell pepper instead of green, and red onion. So amazing. Thanks for the great recipe.

Cut the sugar in half and you got a winner. The second time making it I used 1/3 cup sugar, added 3 hard boiled eggs and the family loved it.

Have tried this 2 ways ..as written and with my modifications .. As written for me its a 3.5 stars...with a few modification for personal taste it 4.5 .. hence the 4 star rating. It is flavorful and definately needs to refridgerate over night for best flavor. The recipe calls for Mayo .. dont use Miracle Whip.
My Modifications .. cut the pasta to 2 cups , eggs to 2 , and added 1/2 cup of plain greek yogurt for a creamier texture .. i prefer my mac salad just a touch on the sweet side so add 2 packets of splenda ... next time I am going to try it cutting the mustard back too.

I grew up in the North and live in the South. I miss these types of deli salads. I make this often and always get compliments. The mustard powder offers just enough tang along with the vinegar. I mess around with the sugar a little so it won't be too sweet. I always put in the cherry tomatoes and make double dressing, adding more of the dressing before serving. It is always a hit at any event. Easy to whip up too!

Too sweet for what I consider to be a "classic" macaroni salad but it is all a matter of taste. The next time I make it I would only use about a third of the sugar the recipe calls for. I would also incorporate more mayo.

I made this for my Marine son when he was home to visit.  He, my husband and myself absolutely loved it!  I sent the leftovers back to base with my son and then had to make again a few days later for my husband because he wanted more!  My husband has never really liked macaroni salad before!  Also, my son and his finace have requested that I make it for their wedding reception.  I think it says it all!  YES, its a keeper!

Made this recipe exactly as written!  Actually doubled it and had it tonight with hamburgers.  Can't wait to have it with ribs tomorrow!  Recipe is perfect, 5 stars!  I don't understand people rating their version of a recipe, I rate the recipe as written.  Any changes would come later.  NO changes needed for this one!  Thanks for sharing!!

Way too much mustard and sugar. The dressing by itself makes an excellent honey mustard flavored (no honey of course) salad dressing.  Luckily I tried it before adding the noodles and veggies.  Saved the dressing for a tossed salad.  In my opinion, "classic" is misleading.  It is far from it.  Maybe it should be called Sweet Mustard Macaroni Salad.

Superb recipe, not at all like the purchased salads. Always a hit at gatherings. Have made this several times, experimenting here and there.  My only final changes are to use fresh red pepper for color, and to omit the salt the recipe specifies, as I salt (1.5T) the water I cook the pasta in. Then, if needed, I salt to taste as a final step!

Now, the only refinements are: (1) use 1/2 green pepper and 1/2 red pepper for color; (2) no pimento; (3) chop onion very very finely, almost like minced, to retain flavor while hiding onion bite from anti-onion-chunks folk; (4) celery and pepper are sliced and chopped into chunks no larger than frozen peas.  

Using eggs makes so little difference I have dispensed with that variation, unless I feel there's a need for protein.  The excessive sweetness that some reviewers comment on pretty much disappears if the pasta is refrigerated for several hours or overnight.  Try the recipe first before you cut the sugar! As an added tip, I have found apple cider vinegar to be helpful in this recipe if I have it available.

I use weight instead of volume where possible.  Four cups elbows weigh 22 oz, so, using the convenient one pound box gives you a surplus of sauce.  Four cups of rings weigh slightly under 16 oz.  Four of ditallini weigh 19.6 oz. My point?  Depending on the pasta used (and its surface area), the "creaminess" of the sauce will vary.  Nonetheless, you'll be happy regardless of what one-pound pasta box you use, or if you use volume.

I found that it needed more mayo to make it creamier but the taste was really good.  I had to omit the celery (didn't have any) but I did use the pimentos.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this for a Barbeque for Fathers day.  It was good but not  great.  I was hoping for a creamier substance I think I will keep the recipe because I liked the not overly sweetness of the dressing and tweak it a bit and more than likely add a little more Mayo next time.

Good recipe, but it was a little sweet, and it can be made more healthful without losing any flavor.  I used 1/2 cup Splenda, light mayonnaise, and added about 1/4 cup fat free sour cream.

This was amazingly delish.  I initially thought it would be too sweet also, but I let it chill for a few hours, the flavors merged together wonderfully.  I think next time I'd like to add dill relish, just for tang.  Maybe that's where the pimento peppers come in.

For how quick and simple this recipe was, it was VERY good. I actually liked this type of Macaroni Salad, and I'm not usually a fan.

I love this recipe!  It's very easy to make.  Maybe I have a sweet tooth but I don't think this is to sweet (some people said it was to sweet).  Everyone that tries this loves it.  I don't put the whole onion in (i'm not a big fan of onions) but I do put some in.

This was easy and tasty.  I made this the day before and I ended up making a little more of the "sauce" just before I took it to my potluck because it seemed a little dry.  Next time, I'll just make the extra at the same time and pour it over just before serving.  Then I don't have to do double duty!

Came out beautifully! I did cut the onion and sugar down to about 1/3 - just personal preference, depends on how oniony and/or sweet you want it. I did as suggested by another reviewer and added hard boiled eggs. Also as suggested made both the sauce and pasta the night before and chilled separately & then combined shortly before serving.

Took out Pimento peppers, carrot, bell pepper because I don't like those things.  Added diced cheese, 4 hard boiled eggs, and 4 Tbsp dill relish.  Yum!

My Mom in Law Loves this recipe... Since first trying this recipe...I have made this 6 times in 7 months to take to family gatherings at her house! I've never been a big fan of Macaroni salad in general, but this recipe seems to be well received.

This recipe was very good!  I did change things up a bit to suit my families likes.  I left out the celery, green pepper, carrots and pimentos.  I added, 4 chopped hard boiled eggs, 1 roasted red bell pepper, 1/2 can sliced olives, some small cubes of cheddar cheese and 1/4 cup of sweet pickle relish.  Mmmm my whole family gobbled it right up.  I think this is a great " base" recipe, esp since you can add and take away whatever you want and it still turns out delicious.

Great base macaroni salad!  Raved by my family!  I did have a bit of fun, as I tend to do with recipes.  Doubled everything but the noodles.  Used a little less green pepper and added a whole red bell pepper.  I may cut the vinegar just a little bit next time in order to thicken the sauce a bit, although I think the resulting thinness was my fault.  (a bit of water got in...)  Great taste and full of vegetables too!

Made this for a 4th of July cookout recently and received lots of compliments on it. I used the small, mini-tube pasta and it yielded WAAAAY too much pasta for the recipe; should've stuck with the elbow macaroni instead. I had to double the dressing because of this but it turned out great and hubby really liked it. I used 1/2 tsp onion powder in place of the onion because we don't like onions in our food, and it tasted great!

This was an easy, fantastic recipe. I made it for a cookout, and it got rave reviews. I loved it so much I made another batch the very next day! For my version, I used cider vineager instead of white, a scant 2/3 cup of sugar, and added 2 tablespoons of sour cream. The dressing is very runny at first, but it gets thicker in the fridge overnight. For best results, I recommend making it a full 24 hours before you plan to eat it. Delicious!

I took this to a family reunion.  They all said it was the very best mac salad they've ever had.  I agree.  I love this recipe.  The only change I make is 1/3 cup of sugar.  Everything else the same!  Tastes even better the next day!!  We love it!

My husband said it tasted just like his mom makes, which he loves. I had to change some things to make it taste more like hers. I used mircle whip instead of mayonnaise and I doubled the amount of mixture. I didn't use onion, celery, peppers or carrot, instead I added cucumber and shredded cheese.

Quite a bit sweeter than the macaroni salads I am accustomed to.  Next time I will cut sugar back to 1/3 cup.  I also added a 1/2 cup of sour cream to the mixture to make it a little more creamy.  Overall a good salad.

I love this macaroni salad! I don't add the carrots or pementos, but I've made it several times now and it always turns out fabulous! Everyone that tries it, loves it!! I DO use 100% whole grain macaroni and Kraft Mayo w/ Olive Oil to make it slightly healthier. No one can tell that it's whole wheat pasta! I'm making this recipe again today for a cookout. LOVE it!

DELICIOUS SAUCE!!!  In making this recipe I made the sauce as directed and put my own choice of vegetables and stuff into the pasta.  I made mine with green and red peppers, along with a couple hard boiled eggs, little cheese cubes, tomato, and chunks of ham.  MMM writing this review is making me hungry for left overs!!!  Good night and bon appetite!

Wonderful, simple recipe!  I made this for the first time for a Mother's Day cookout.  I substituted apple cider vinegar for the white vinegar and left out the bell pepper and pimentos.  I added chopped hard boiled egg and bacon instead.  Everyone asked for the recipe and wanted some to take home.  I am going to keep this in my recipe box for future occasions!

A little too sweet for my taste when I made the recipe as is.  Next time I cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup and added tons of fresh veggies.  I will make it again for sure!  The kids loved it!!

This is a very, very good salad. I did change a few things though. Miracle Whip instead of mayonnaise, cider vinegar instead of white, cut back to 1/3 cup of sugar and added about 1/3 cup of sweet pickle relish, 4 hard boiled eggs and maybe a little more black pepper. I have shared this with a few others and they say it's the best macaroni salad they have ever eaten! Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!

Perfect name for this very classic mac salad! It is fantastic. I bring to every summer picnic. I use 1/2 the sugar but other than that I make it exactly as written. Make sure you make it the night before - it is so easy and it tastes so much better if it sits.

This is the best macaroni salad I have ever eaten.  I have made it several times now but somehow keep forgetting to rate it!  The thing I love the best about this recipe is that it is not swimming in mayo.  Too many macaroni/potato salads are and I don't care for them at all.  The only thing I change is to cut down on the sugar a bit.  It's fine with the full amount but just a little too sweet for my taste.  Also, it tastes even better if you make it the day before you plan on serving it.  So yummy!

A great recipe for a basic, old-fashioned macaroni salad.  I used small penne for the pasta because I had a lot leftover from some Italian pasta recipe I had made. Also, I omitted the chopped celery, but used a few shakes of celery seed instead. Mix the dressing ingredients separately and CUT BACK ON THE SUGAR, and a bit less on the mustard and salt too.  I used minced Vidala onion. We really enjoyed this macaroni salad.  The bonus is that it's a lot less work that the Amish macaroni salad I usually make from the recipe on this site.

I gave this recipe to my mother, who happens to be cooking challenged, and the recipe is so simple even she can pull it off.  She made it for a cookout today, and it was so good that everyone was asking about the recipe!  If my mom can make it, and it tastes great, you know it's a fantastic recipe!

This was excellent! I took the advice of countless other reviews and used a little less than 1/4 cup of sugar, added some hard-boiled eggs and also backed off a little bit on the amount of vegetables. I also made it the night before our party and made another batch of the dressing (minus the veggies) and let it sit in the fridge overnight as well. The pasta will soak up a lot so having the extra dressing to mix in before serving is almost neccessary. Was a big hit with my family.

Made exactly as written (well...1/2 recipe) and I thought the dressing tasted...weird.  Too much mustard, maybe?  It had an after taste that I've noticed also in the macaroni salad in the deli case at our local grocery store.  My daughter said that it tasted like deviled eggs...which I love...just not as the overwhelming taste in macaroni salad.

This is my favorite macaroni salad now, I have searched for years looking for good ones and this is the best.  I do use less sugar like the other reviews though, and I am still experimenting with different ingredients.  The latest I used eckrich smoked sausage for the meat and onion gr olive, it was very good.

To be fair I made this as per recipe before making changes.... It WAS Way too sweet... Need to cut back sugar and vinegar to 2 Tablespoons for each. Need to add more mayonnaise, add hard boiled eggs chopped and I would also decrease the mustard to 1 Tablespoon. For better flavor Use 3 Green Onions finely chopped OR red onion instead of yellow onion!

This is a good recipe but I made the following changes which really enhanced the salad:  6 boiled eggs, chopped; 1 small can of sliced black olives, 2 cups of frozen peas.  I've also made it with a pound of crispy cooked bacon!  Lots of ways to experiment, but this is a good base recipe, thanks for sharing!

This is how I make mine most of the time! But instead of adding vinegar, chop up some PICKLES instead!! I also do not add any sugar, tastes better and is much healthier.  Hard-boiled egss are also a good addition.

this was a good recipe, I kinda doctored it up a bit. Next time im not putting the 2/3c of sugar in, it was way too sweet. Instead of mayo, I used half sour cream and miracle whip. I added cucumber for added crunch and a little fresh dill to give it some flavor.

Delicious!  The dressing is just great - really light for a creamy one.  I reduced the sugar in mine substancially, and I would advise anyone else to do the same.  However, this is purely a matter of taste, so I wouldn't criticize.

Awesome! I didn't even put the carrots, celery, or peppers in it (picky family), and it is the best I've ever made/had! I'll never buy it from the store again. Thank you so much!

LOVED this recipe!!  I cut down on the sugar to 1/3 cup like other reviewers suggested and found it to be sweet enough for me.  Definitely a make ahead dish though.  It tastes much better the second day.

This is the second time I have made this salad in the past month and have made adjustments to the original recipe. I scaled the pasta down to two cups but kept the dressing the same; the macaroni does soak up some of the mayo mixture but doubling it makes it perfect when refrigerated! I used 1/3 cup + 2 tbsp. of sugar instead of the 2/3 cup, added two hardboiled eggs, 2 stalks of celery, and a bell pepper.  Great, easy recipe!  I'm looking forward to trying this with potatoes next time.

I made the recipe exactly as it was written and I had no complaints.  The dressing is quite sweet but I served this with ham and the sweet cut the salt of the ham nicely.  Very quick and easy and pretty much all of the ingredients are pantry items so it doesn't require an extra trip to the store which earns extra points in my book.

This is really a great recipe!  But - you really need to chill this well to get the best taste. I found 4 hours wasn't enough - it tasted good but seemed a little sweet.  After 10-12 hours, the sweetness had mellowed and the salad was great!  It was a wonderful cross between a traditional mac salad creamy dressing and a slaw dressing.  We made a triple recipe and they scraped the bowl!

This recipe is great.  I have never attempted macaroni salad, but this is definitely a keeper.  I made half of the recipe and omitted the green pepper but added 3 hard boiled eggs, cut into pieces.  It has been sitting in the fridge and gets better and better.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Made this salad to take on a picnic.  I found the recipe & made it in less than 30min.  Super easy and really delicious...only change I made was adding sugar gradually until I liked the taste.

Very good.  My daughter made this on Father's Day and I made it the other day.  Will definitely make again. I added the pimentos and cut down on the sugar.  Used shredded carrots and Hellman's light mayo and large elbow macaroni. Daughter put cheese cubes in hers.  I may have added a little too much mustard though.  Will cut back next time.  Would really be good with diced ham also.

Great recipe.  For one box of macaroni pasta (16 oz), I used 1 1/2 times the dressing.  I also cut back on the sugar, as recommended by other reviewers (about 1/2 cup for the one box of pasta).

Everyone at the picnic always asks for the recipe!  I cut down the sugar by half and added red, green and orange peppers.

This is the best that I have made so far.  I did cut back on the sugar and prepared mustard by nearly half; otherwise, I think it would have been way too sweet for our family.  I cut-back on the mustard because I did not want a "yellow-looking" salad.

Will definitely make this again.  Just a couple of changes, but nothing major as this is a very good base recipe.  I didn't rinse the macaroni, but let it cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally. This lets starch build up, which allows the dressing to stick to the pasta better. I also used Dijon mustard rather than plain, and cut the sugar by 1/4. This is a really good base recipe which can be tweaked and created with whatever vegetables and/or pasta you have on hand, and the dressing is easily adjusted for personal taste.

I have made this several times in the last couple of months.  Anytime I make recipes with mayo I always cut the sugar almost out of the recipe.  I do not sweet slaws, macaroni salads, etc...
Each time I have made it nothing is left.  I would say cut the sugar to your taste and the recipe is perfect.

I learned a valuable lesson on all recipes today just because a recipe has really good reviews by lots of people doesn't mean its gonna be good. This was the absolute worst tasting macaroni salad Ive ever had. I followed the directions exactly as stated and I live with 6 other people and none of them could bare it. It was runny, vinegary and putting sugar in it was a huge mistake, needed more veggies in it as well and was way too sweet. What a waste of food. If you want a good macaroni salad this is not where to find it.

I wasn't sure how to rate this recipe because on one hand it is the exact macaroni salad recipe I was looking for but I did have to make a couple of changes to the recipe.  So, I'm rating the recipe a 3 before the changes and a 5 after the changes I made.  It seemed like the recipe called for way too much sugar for my taste, so I changed the amount to 2 tablespoons and that made the sweetness just right.  Also, I decreased the salt and added just 1 teaspoon.  And instead of 1 whole onion I added about 1/4 of a purple onion.  Once I made these changes the recipe was fantastic.  The vegetables are crunchy and the flavor just right.

Awesome recipe, some people believe it or not do not know the difference between Mayonnaise and (Yuck) Miracle Whip which is already sweet - If you us use real mayonnaise the recipe is perfection !

Delicious & Simple!  After reading the reviews, I only added 1/2 C sugar, because I couldn't risk it being ruined.  Turns out, 1/2 C was perfect!
I added onion, peppers, and cucumbers.  I omitted the celery, pimentos, and carrots because I didn't have any.  Feel free to get creative with the veggies/extras.  This recipe seems like it is very forgiving!  Enjoy!

I made this recipe exactly as it was for myself and my guest this weekend. There were a few guests who stated they did not like macaroni salad. I asked them to at least try a bite of this one. They agreed and after tasting it had up to three plates of it with their meal. :) Everyone including myself will continue to make this !! I can't wait to make it again !!

Really good but really sweet!  I will make again (probably many times!) but use 1/2 the sugar.  My husband loved the yellow mustard in it.  I suggest you let it sit overnight but reserve 1/3 to 1/2 the dressing to add just before serving.  A great BBQ-on-the-deck side dish.  Very easy to make and  so much better than grocery store deli salad.

Tried this recipe 3 times.  

As is, way too sweet!
It's perfect if you cut the sugar to 1/3 cup, even 1/4 cup.  Increase the pepper by 1 teaspoon.  Just remember that if its too sweet add pepper.

Last adjustment was that I added diced roasted red pepper and not the optional pimento.  You can get that canned or skip it all together.   

Another tip is to only use green bell pepper. Red,  yellow and orange will only add to the sweetness.

I wasn't too crazy about this recipe.  I cut the sugar back to 1/4 cup because I didn't want it overly sweet.  I used red bell pepper because I didn't have a green one.  This is an okay recipe, but it seemed rather bland to me.

what about the vinegar - I made 3 batches eliminated the vinegar (made the whole mix WAY to sour with the mustard) - less
Mustard, so not so sour - and a few teaspoons of sugar - Gotta make it again this weekend - just wish i had exact measurements - oh and definitely added hard boiled eggs.....

I liked it with some variations ... instead of so much sugar, I only put 2 tsp (along with 2 tsp of sweet pickle juice instead of the vinegar). I just stuck to the celery (v. adding in carrots, peppers, and pimentos) and put in 3 chopped boiled eggs. I use 1/2 cup of red onion as well ... so I guess I did alter it somewhat!

I have made this 3 times in less than a month. I thought only my husband and I would like it but the kids did too and keep asking me to make it. I made it according to the recipe minus the pimento peppers which is an optional item anyhow. - lkc

A lovely salad and the dressing is amazing with less sugar of course. My hubby was doing (mmm mmm mmmm) between every fork and the other, I love it when he does that.

A friend and I made this recipe for a work function once, and ever since, we've had the job assigned to us to make it for every cookout! It has a nice bite to it, but we're a little more generous with the vinegar than it calls for, and we add cheese. :)

I added more macaroni (minus the optional carrots) otherwise kept to the exact recipe and it was a huge hit!  I had to make another batch soon after since it was gobbled up with no leftovers at a family function.  Is a keeper! Perfect touch of sweetness although not too sweet.  I used 5 cups of macaroni and maybe that's why it wasn't TOO sweet, but I'm gonna keep this one around! (Recipe is much better if it gets to sit overnight)

This is a fantastic macaroni salad! Really easy and so good. I used Miracle Whip instead of Mayo and cut the sugar in half. Everyone loved it. Will definitely be making this again!

So glad I tried this recipe.  I have made it 3 times lately for company.  Everyone likes it and one person wants the recipe.  The fact that you can adjust it to your own taste is awesome.  We like it mainly because the mayo with vinegar makes it less creamy and not so rich, and it keeps longer.

Really good!  I made as directed except I cut the sugar by almost half due to the reviews and I used lite Miracle Whip instead of Mayo.  Next time I think I'll add a good bit of thawed raw green peas and more pimento.  Thank you!

Really liked this recipe for macaroni salad. I followed a few of the other reviewers' tips: cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup and used 1/2 TB less mustard. I also added some frozen mixed veggies, shredded cheddar cheese, and bacon bits - my family loved it! The following day, I added some tuna and served it over some Romaine lettuce, and it made a nice little lunch :) I could never really find a good recipe for a classic macaroni salad (without all the fancy ingredients or things I didn't have on hand), but this one is a keeper! Next, I'll try it for a potato salad :)

I really liked this recipe!!  Only reason i rated a 4 is bc it would b way too sweet with that amount lf sugar.  I cut the sugar in half and its perfect.  When u first taste it it still tastes really sweet.  But a few hours in the fridge and it tastes just right.  Otherwise, this recipe is amazing!  I brought it on a camping trip and i had several people ask for the recipe.

I don't cook much and have never made a macaroni salad before. After finding this recipe it sounded easy enough and I wouldn't have to go to the store for anything. I cut the serving size down to 4 since 10 would be way too much for my little family. I added 5 grape tomatoes sliced up and cubed cheddar cheese. Everything else was as the recipe states for serving 4 people. My kids are pretty picky as they are 1 and 4, but they ate some of it. My husband thought it was one of the best things I've made and I myself thought it was pretty yummy. I did think the sugar content was a little too much, so maybe I'd cut that back next time. Otherwise, this recipe was really good. We even had left overs after dinner which is good because I'd definitely eat it again. Thanks for this quick and easy recipe! :)

This recipe tastes great but be advised it makes a lot of macaroni salad, and you can't freeze it.  May want to consider cutting the quantities in half.

This is hands down the best macaroni salad I ever made or tasted. I follow the recipe to a T, except for the pimentos because I never have any in the house.  So much flavor, everyone raves about it, and they demand that I make it at every BBQ.  The only thing I can say about the negative reviews is that people really do have different tastes, and that can be said about every recipe on the planet.  It doesn't matter how good it is to one person, someone else won't like it...period.

I found the base for the dressing a great start. I did find it a bit dry the next day so I tried the suggestion by JqSmith at adding the dressing the day of the serving but still made a little more dressing about a cup more.

sweet, cut back sugar; needed boiled eggs & celery.  Did not have so used celery seed.  Made the dressing the night before, pasta really sucks up the dressing may want to double so can keep adding as needed

this looks delicious and actually has some flavor.  you know when you go to picnics and someone brings regular macaroni salad and you know they just threw some macaroni together with mayo and a bit of milk and it's just so lazy where everyone else brings all kinds of summer salads that have at least 6 flavorful ingredients?  thanks for justifying macaroni salad with a good recipe because people who are lazy and cheap make "regular" macaroni salad and they should be ashamed of themselves.

My husband and I both loved this. It was not too sweet at all. I think the mustard balances it out nicely. I made it exactly as described, but I think next time I will add more mayo to the dressing so it is creamier and add the dressing to chilled noodles. By letting it sit in the refrigerator for several hours the noodles absorbed the dressing and made it a tad dry. Flavor was spot on, but just not creamy enough. Otherwise a total winner in our house!

I followed some suggestions from other reviewers and used 1/4 cup sugar, garlic salt instead of regular salt, and added paprika (which turned the dish orange XD). I accidentally added too much vinegar, so I had to put in a lot more mayo. I taste tested it before sticking it in the fridge so it'd be ready for this evening's Thanksgiving feast, and it's okay. It's probably because I accidentally let the bottle of vinegar "glug" by tipping it over too much, but in any case 2 tablespoons seems like an awful lot. If you like a mild macaroni salad, cut the vinegar in half or use 1.5 tablespoons. Taste it before adding the full amount.

Note: I cut the recipe yield in half. Four cups of uncooked pasta is an awful lot.

I really liked this macaroni salad recipe, the pasta didn't dry out and it makes a good basic side dish.  I didn't add any celery or pimentos, and only half an onion (around here we're a bit iffy on raw onion and we don't like celery).  With the sugar I noticed that others had complained it was too sweet, so I just added it spoonful by spoonful into the dressing base until I was happy with the taste, although it was way less than 2/3c.  I did use half regular mustard and half Dijon, I'm running out of both so I just made it up to the right amount.  I didn't grate the carrot and I added 2 in total, and half a capsicum just because we had it.  It's a very versatile base macaroni salad recipe.

I liked it. I cut the serving in half and followed the recipe exactly the same except the sugar. I usually cut sugar when I try recipes online since they usually seem a bit too sweet for me. I put a bit less than a quarter cup for half serving and it was really good. 
It was very similar to the amish potato salad recipe that I have.
I think next time, I would put some eggs in for a chainge.

I made the recipe just about exactly as stated. I did add the optional carrots. I used red bell pepper instead of the green because that's what I had on hand. I added cut up hard boiled eggs. I've never made macaroni salad with the sugar and vinegar because it didn't sound good. Those two items were the key!!! This was the best macaroni salad I've ever made or had. It wasn't too sweet like I saw on some reviews. It was great! Everyone in my family loved it. Note- Make sure you put it in the frig for the 4 hours like it states. When you make it and mix it together it will be very runny. I thought I messed up the recipe. After the 4 hours in the frig is was perfect!

I'm only rating the mayo mix for this recipe because, let's face it people,  the add-ins you use do not matter. I used pickles, eggs, shallots, ham and cheese because that's what I had, but anything will work--throw it in there. The mayo mix is really good and is sweet but it is meant to be that way obviously.  The portion of mayo to pasta is right, it wasn't too dry or too runny.  I'm saving this one.

I was pleasantly surprised! Not too sweet and just creamy and savory enough to be absolutely delicious! Will definitely do again and again . Like many others, i added garlic powder which totally made the dish.

If you make this with a spicy mustard, like Boar's Head, it counteracts the sweetness and its amazing!

I had never made macaroni salad before but I promised myself that on this July 4th I would not settle for bland supermarket macaroni salad! I read the reviews and used less vinegar and sugar but otherwise followed the recipe faithfully.  I thought the end result was a little salty for my taste (I tend not to use a lot of salt in food) so I added 4 boiled eggs.  It was truly delicious.  The salad had that homey "pleasing taste" like the description says.  My family loved it. They liked that it wasn't overwhelmingly mayonnaise-y.  I can't wait to have some more tomorrow and see how much better it tastes.  Thank you for a great recipe. I will never buy macaroni salad from store again.

I loved this recipe, i'm glad i chose this one. i made it according to the recipe first and i thought it was a tad sweet. After it sat over night though it was absorbed into the pasta and was really good. i made it again and added garlic powder, paprika, chopped hard boiled eggs, a large can of tuna and some crispy crumbled bacon. I always add tuna because mac salad just isn't the same without it to me and the bacon because.....well its bacon. lol Top notch, saving to my recipes.

I did not care for this recipe. After desperately trying to tweak it with salt and other savory ingredients to balance out the sweetness I chalked it up as a loss. It was like noodles swimming in sugary cream.

Fantastic when made with only 1/8 - 1/4 c of sugar!  The whole family loved it and it reminded me of macaroni salads of my youth.  The dressing is perfect in taste and was just the right amount for the amount of pasta.  I made it 6hrs ahead of being served so the dressing had absorbed into the pasta, which is just the way we like it.  My family doesn't like salads that are very saucy or have too much dressing.  The only variations I made from the original recipe was reduce the sugar to less than 1/4 c and a little more than 1/8c.  I also didn't have any macaroni noodles on hand so I used multicolored rotini spirals. I wasn't sure they would work okay with this kind of a dressing since I normally use Italian dressing with those, but it turned out fantastic.  I really liked the shredded carrots in the salad.  I have never thought to add them to a cold salad, but they really worked well.  I think this salad would work well with other additions like some thawed frozen green peas.

Made this recipe for a Memorial Day BBQ.  As others have suggested, I reduced the sugar amount to less than half.  Added shredded carrots, celery, red onions and diced cheddar cheese chunks (I know..sounds kind of odd but it was really good)!

Thanks to Graden for submitting this recipe and for everyone who wrote in with their suggestions.  The collective wisdom of knowledgeable cooks is hugely helpful to those of us who are culinarily challenged.  Great mac salad.  As suggested by others, 1/4 cup of sugar was plenty. Used a little less mustard and a little more celery that the recipe call for.  Also added the eggs, used a sweet yellow onion, substituted a red bell pepper for a green one and did not put in either the pimentos or carrots.

Very nice. I did reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup and didn't notice a difference. This is very similar to a macaroni salad that my mom makes and she adds diced gherkins to it. It kept very well in the fridge and makes a truck load for large gatherings. Great for summer barbecues. Thanks!

This macaroni salad was perfect! The balance of flavors is just right.  Not too much mayo and just enough flavor from the vinegar and mustard. Definitely try this one. You won't be disappointed.

After 40 years of making Macaroni Salad, this IS IT!  Hubby does not like Mac Salad, But HE LOVES THIS ONE!  I reduced the amount of sugar slightly, and it's perfect.  This salad tastes best if made 2 days ahead.  I also serve sliced eggs on the side.

Great recipe for macaroni salad! I used 1/3 of a red, yellow, and orange bell pepper instead of a whole green bell pepper for color. I decreased the mustard to 1 tsp. because I'm not a fan of mustard (this made the salad sweet and tangy kind of like a coleslaw). As others have said, this was even better the next day! I had to fight my husband for the last of it!

I have tried making a few different versions of macaroni salad and have never been completely satisfied. This time, however, I finally found the macaroni salad I was looking for! I followed the recipe for the dressing exactly and it's wonderful. For the rest of the recipe I used macaroni noodles, red onion, celery, red pepper, and peas. It was delicious!

Ok, so this is delicious. I'm a poor college kid, so it was nice to be able to make something out of stuff that you typically just have laying around. I don't like peppers, and my carrots had gone bad, so I left those out. Also, I'm not big on onions and pepper, so I added half of the onion, and maybe about half of the pepper (I put it straight in the mix from the grater without measuring, so I'm not for sure). Oh, yeah, and I used rotini pasta. It definitely would have been better if it had more vegetables besides the celery and onion, but I still loved it. I've been craving macaroni salad for a week, and this definitely took care of that! Next time I might try adding broccoli or radishes, but we usually have some assortment of vegetables around my apartment, so it's nice to know that I'll be able to whip this up whenever I feel like it!

Completely forgot the mustard and now the salad is all in Tuperware chillin in the fridge and the mixing bowl is already in the dishwasher so I will have to add it next time because THERE WILL BE A NEXT TIME!   UPDATE:  Used this dressing w/ only 1/4th cup of sugar to make CHICKEN SALAD...OMG...so freakin good!!

Let me begin with I'm not big on macaroni salad, but my husband can't get enough.  So when our local deli discontiinued carrying his favorite, something had to be done.  Once again allrecipes to the rescue.  I made a few changes, cut sugar in half, added green and yellow peppers, refrigerated the dressing and added a touch of olive oil to pasta before cooling.  So delicious even I had seconds.

This was very easy and VERY yummy!  I made it without celery, carrot, and pimento peppers because I didn't have them on hand.  Next time, I will cut down on the sugar just because it was a bit too sweet for my hubby.  I'm thinking of cutting the vinegar, as well, because it has quite a bite afterwards.  But, I will definitely be making this again!  Thanks!

I was searching for a classic mac salad and came across this recipe.  It did not disappoint.  I have to say I am not a huge mustard fan, and was a bit worried to see my mixture turn yellow, but it blended nicely with the rest of the ingredients and was not overpowerful.  

Make sure you chill this the night ahead, as it is much better the next day.  This was a huge hit at my BBQ.  Enjoy.

I didn't make this early enough and so served it after it sat for about only and hour and a half.  It was WAY too sugary but I figured that the next day it would be better.  Although the flavors did meld it was still way too sweet for my taste the next day.  It reminded me of store bought macaroni salad.  I did like the proportions of ingredients but I don't think I'll make it this way again.  I'm still looking for my forever macaroni salad

Wow, I couldn't stop eating this salad.  Definitely adjust to your taste.  I read other reviews and only added 1/4c of the sugar and also cut the vinegar by half.  I don't really like the idea of putting so much mustard so I only put 1tsp in mine.  My guests asked for the recipe. This is a salad you want to make a day before so that the dressing is not so runny.  Once it cools, it's creamy and delicious. Loved it--will make again and again.

I have been making this recipe since 2009 and my kids love it! I don't add the sugar, chopped pimento peppers. I will put in a pound of cooked shrimp and I add seasond salt. This does not last long in my house.

I think this is one of the best recipes I have ever tried.  I gave it 4 stars because of the sugar. I only put 1/3 of a cup of sugar and it was still a little sweet for me.  I made it an hour before supper and it was still wonderful but the next day it was fantastic and the sweetness had been absorbed by the macaroni..  I used red bell peppers instead of green because that was what I had.  If you can let it sit overnight for the next day. It was still very creamy and not dry like most of my pasta salads are the next day.

By far this is the best receipe that I have seen anywhere.  Just made it the first time tonight but it will not be the last. I am diabetic so I used Splenda instead of sugar couldn't tell it wasn't sugar.  Thank for sharing this one

VERY sweet, glad I only used half the sugar called for! Yes, classic is supposed to be on the sweeter side, but this was way too sweet. Okay base recipe, did tweak quite a bit for our tastes though, and with the sweetness and need for alterations, I give it two stars...

This is a really good classic recipe for macaroni salad.  I took the advice of the other reviewers and decreased the amt of sugar.  Next time I might add hard boiled eggs.

Great recipe... still could be tweeked. I used green onion, added olives and left out the bell pepper. It came out sweeter than I would have like.. which could be fixed by using less sugar and a little more mustard, maybe dijon. I added ham to make it more savory. Next time i will go with my gut and add pickles and top with paprika.

I'm the person that always adds the extra ingredients to "make it my own".  Although I cut back on the sugar, and I really don't understand pimentos; I think this recipe is perfect! Sweet, tangy, creamy and simple!

Did someone ask you to bring macaroni salad to a party? Are you craving macaroni salad? Are you thinking about a delicious macaroni salad you've had previously?  
Then this is the recipe for you!  I made this exactly as written(&i never do that) and it was fantastic.  A straightforward salad that everyone will enjoy.  Make sure you make it ahead of time so the favors can meld.  It was not too sweet... Just like the title suggests., classic.  Thanks GRaden!

The basics of this recipe are perfect but we did our own tweaking and got it the way we like it. We cut the sugar to 3/4 cup and half the salt and added a tsp of celery seed and changed the onion to green onions, also used 1/2 tsp dry mustard instead of regular mustard and changed it to apple vinegar instead.

My family really liked this salad! It sure makes a lot, which is great, because we like leftovers, too! I would have given it 5 stars, but I didn't add the onion, celery, pepper, carrot or pimentos. I also followed a suggestion from another reviewer to chill the macaroni and dressing separately and add them together before serving. It worked perfectly! Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent salad even having subbed celery seed for the celery, and onion powder for the chopped onion. I cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup and it was perfect for our tastes. My picky guests were very happy.

I sized this recipe for 150 people and it called for 15 large onions.  When we mixed it up, we decided to use 1/2 that amount of onions and it was fine.  We mixed it the night before (about 16 hours ahead), and it was very, very good!! It makes alot--I estimate the amount prepared when the recipe is sized for 150 could have served 200 as a side dish.

WOW, This is so good. Very tasty, little sweet, little tangy. My son couldnt wait to eat it so I gave him a bowl before it sat in the fridge. I made a double batch. I did cut back on sugar a third. I but i think it should be cut in atleast half.  Bet this is real tasty with cut up chicken. Yummy   thanks

This is a great recipe!! I did make a couple changes only because of my tastes. I left out the bell peppers and carrots. Then added celery seeds. This is by far the best recipe for macaroni salad I have found!  This is a great side to make and have on hand in the fridge. We found that the more time it was in the fridge the better it tasted!

I have been looking for a different macaroni salad and this one is great! We enjoyed it very much and will serve it again.  Because of concern for blood sugar levels I have substituted on packet of Stevia a natural sugar substitute, and it worked very well, Stevia is a plant and it is very sweet, so you only need a little to go a long way

This recipe is perfect, as is, with NO CHANGES! It has been a hit at every meal that I've served it at, and I have been asked for directions on how to make it numerous times.  I have substituted fuscilli macaroni, but that makes no difference to the taste.

Outstanding!!  My husband is super picky and he was eating this even before it was chilled.  I did add 5 crispy strips of bacon chopped and 4 eggs and used 1/2 the sugar and rice wine vinegar since I was out of white vinegar.  Nonetheless, this was an outstanding recipe and I will be sure to use this one many times again in the future.  My husband loves it!

A very good basic recipe as written, but made even better by following some of the reviewers' suggestions. I decreased the sugar to about 1/4 cup; added four chopped, hard-boiled eggs and six slices of bacon, crumbled.  My guests raved about this salad and requested I serve it again the next time they come to dinner.  That's a hit in my book!

Delish.  Good base.  A tip on the onions: After chopping, put in a colander or sieve and run under cold water for 30 seconds or so, that will take the bite out of them.

LOVE this! I have made it pretty much every week all summer... it goes perfect with steak or fried chicken, and when you add a little bit of shredded cheddar cheese (about 1/4 cup) it allows you to fill all of your food groups! Its been a big hit for everyone I've served it to!

This was a great recipe. I didn't want it super sweet, so I used only 1/3 cup of sugar to start, and thought that was enough. I added the grated carrot, and omitted the pimento. I used1/2 green pepper and 1/2 red pepper as that's what I had on hand. It was a hit at my Labor Day BBQ. Will definitely make again!

I had been craving macaroni salad because I love the macaroni salad I get at Hawaiian BBQ's. This was extremely similar. I omitted all the veggies mainly because I do not like crunch at all in my macaroni salad (texture issue). Instead of the onion, I added green onion (no crunch and not as strong onion flavor), and I only had apple cider vinegar on hand, so I used that. I ended up eating some at dinner and it was great, but I had some for lunch the next day and it was AWESOME. This definately tastes better the next day. Yummy!! Very similar to Hawaiian BBQ's as well.

Have made this several times, and I love it!  I don't think I'd ever even tried macaroni salad before this one, but this is totally addicting.  Only change I make is to used sliced baby carrots instead of shredded ... I like the contrast of the chunky pieces of vegetables with the smoothness of the macaroni, all tied together with just sweet enough dressing.   Yum ... going to a picnic this weekend ... think I need to make it again!

This is the best macaroni salad. I just love it. I used red peppers instead of green because I'm not a fan of green peppers. I used a little less sugar. I also added some green olives because I love them. I have made this several times and its always great! Thanks for the recipe!

A great salad!  I did use a finely chopped red onion, substituted apple cider vinegar for the white vinegar, reduced the amount of sugar in half, plus added carrot and dried dill weed.  Think I might reduce the amount of pasta next time to make it just a little creamier, but otherwise everybody loved it.

This was very good. I only used 1/4 cup of sugar though and it still turned out delicious. I didn't have any carrots and so obviously left that out but it was still very delicious. And I also added 6 hard boiled eggs.

This was very good, but a tad sweeter than what I was looking for...I was looking for a mac salad that's more savory than sweet(My family still ate all of it, lol). But this is a very good, easy recipe that I will keep for future tweaking !

This was great, I left out the vegetables (I don't like crunchy stuff in my mac salad) and used half the sugar. I will definitely be making this again!!

This macaroni salad is SOOO good! I made enough for twenty servings, for a party my family was having and had spent well over 1 1/2 hours in the kitchen chopping up the veggies etc. But when I mixed the dressing in with the other ingredients and the macaroni, then had a taste of it, I had no choice but to make another batch of it for myself! It was THAT good.

I have been making this macaroni salad for a couple years now; everyone loves it! I am always asked to bring it to every get together and party that I go to. The only changes I make: I leave out the carrots and peppers and ADD chopped hard boiled eggs :)

This was an excellent recipe. I was afraid it was going to be too sweet, so I cut the sugar in half, but I really dont think I needed to. I also added hard boiled eggs, just because of personal preference, it was just as good without. I love the dressing, it was excellent for a summer cookout!

Really good. I cut down on the vinegar by about half and I cut the sugar in half to suit our tastes. I also added 4 or 5 hardboiled eggs. Yum! *I am giving this 4 stars because I made the dressing as is the first time and threw it out to make the changes. It was too sweet and the vinegar came through a little too much.*

Yummy!! I used cider vinegar, 1/2 vidalia (sweet) onion and added 2 chopped hard boiled eggs and a couple dashes of paprika and cayenne pepper for some heat. Very good and got lots of compliments. :)

I needed a recipe to take to the grandmother-in-law's cookout so I followed this exactly (doubled it plus added 4 eggs) and it was a huge hit! Everyone loved it and she wanted to keep the leftovers! :)

I thought this was really good, but I should have read the reviews and prepared it the night before. I only let it set for 5 hours and my husband thought it was too runny. I thought it was OK. The next day it was PERFECT! Thank you for sharing!

Made exactly as described with the exception that I didn't use the pimento so I added a little smoked Paprika powder instead.  I also used no fat mayonnaise and it made no difference at all.  Very nice!

I followed this recipe exactly and we LOVED it! The only thing I would change is the onion. It was just way too strong (and I only used half, and a red onion at that). Next time I'll use green onion.

I made this recipe exactly as listed and loved it.  I took it to a company BBQ and everyone loved it as well.  The second time I made it, I used honey mustard as that was the only mustard I had in the house and the store was closed and it came out a little different (slightly sweet) but it was still great.

We loved this macaroni salad!  I did only use 1/3 cup sugar but that's personal preference.  I didn't add the carrot or pimento pepper but next time I'm definitely adding the carrot not only for flavor but for some additional color.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  It was delicious!

I eliminate the sugar and add a liberal sprinkling of dill.  Also I found that using a larger pasta, such as rigatoni gives it a better flavor.

I made this yesterday for todays superbowl. I omitted the bell pepper and added garlic powder. I also had no small elbow macaroni so I used bowtie pasta which made this look very attractive. I let sit covered overnight and served this afternoon. Sooo delicious all my guests said, so this will be a keeper for future get togethers

I have searched HIGH AND LOW for a good macaroni salad, this is the best yet!  The only thing I did different was I didn't add the green pepper or pimento but added the carrots.  Chopped everything in the food processor, super easy.  The dressing is so good.  Make it a day ahead of time, it's great!  Thank you!!!

This is a fantastic pasta salad, the only draw back I have found is that now I am required to bring a big bowl to every family gathering no matter the season or holiday!

I would have given this five stars but I think 2/3 cup of sugar would have been waaaayyy to much for us.  I reduced it to 1/4 and found it to be plenty.  It is delicious though and I used cucumber and grape tomato in place of the celery and bell pepper.

Yes Yes Yes! This is a great Macaroni Salad base recipe to work from. I think everyone has their own ideas about how sweet or tart they like their food and as such should start with half the sugar and vinegar and add more as desired but remember that the flavors will get bolder as the salad sits. Especially the sweetness. I used just under the called-for amount of sugar and about half the vinegar because my boyfriend isn't fond of too much zestiness in food. I omitted the green pepper since we were out and the pimento since I do not care for them. I used a smaller onion and diced it instead of chopping it so there weren't large chunks of onions in it. I also added more celery and grated a couple of small-medium carrots into it to make up for the lack of pimento. Any time I can get away with adding more carrots or celery to a dish I always do for the nutritional value it adds. I also used a little less mustard and some ground celery seed (like celery salt but without the salt!). I sliced sweet grape tomatoes in half and cubed some mild cheddar cheese, each about half a cup. Probably more like 2/3 on the cheese but I just eyeballed it.   I can hardly wait to eat this as a side with brisket in a couple days. I'm sure I'll have some for lunch tomorrow since it is so good. My boyfriend who typically doesn't care for many of the ingredients on their own, or raw, etc also really enjoyed this. I used mini penne instead of macaroni and I must say it looks a lot nicer.

The 2/3 cup of sugar was WAY to sweet. I used 1/3 and it still was a little sweet for my liking. I did add the eggs and some cayan pepper. I am going to research another mac salad recipe next time.

I just finished making this for our church picnic, and it is GOOD! I only gave it four stars, however, because when I gave it to my husband to taste, he instantly commented that it was too sweet. (I only put half the sugar called for.)   It is a definite keeper!

This was very good. I've been making macaroni salad for years but this recipe is a little different and I like it. I will be making this again. The only thing I did different was to cut back on the sugar and add celery seed. I used red pepper for some color. Didn't have any pimento but will add that the next time.

I get compliments every time I make this. I now use only half the sugar because I find it too sweet with the full amount, but otherwise a perfect blend of flavors!

This was a VERY good macaroni salad recipe! Thanks so much for sharing. The dressing is so good. The macaroni salad tastes better the longer it sits in the fridge, so by the 2nd and 3rd day I liked it even more.

Everybody loved it.  I added parmesean cheese and left out celery, bell pepper & pimento...personal choice.  It is important to let this sit in the fridge for several hours so ingredients can come together.

I gave 4 stars b/c I changed recipe after initial review and insight from others chefs.  However, I bet this recipe could do great on it's own (but a little sweet/tangier).  I cut down the suger and vinegar by half, added more mayo to taste, added hard boiled eggs, and I didn't have celery. I turned out great!  Thanks!!

Exactly the way my Mom's tasted.  for years I could never match it (most recipes are too creamy).  Definitely let it sit in frig overnight-it looks a little too creamy when you first mix it.  thanks for sharing!

I have never been able to make a really good Macaroni salad so I have always let someone else make it for our family get togethers but this time I found this recipe and everyone raved over it.  My son in law was so upset when he went to get his 5th serving the next day and it was gone! They were all fighting over the last spoonful.    I wouldn't change a thing.  I didn't add the pimento peppers in mine.   Thanks again!

Delish!!! This is the best Macaroni salad I've ever had! I had to make modifications because I didn't want to run to the store for ingredients. I used the celery,sweet onion (I used a Vidalia) and grated carrot that the recipe called for I didn't have a green pepper, but used these items instead. I added diced Pink Lady apples and frozen peas. My husband loved it mainly because it wasn't all mayonnaise like so many Macaroni Salads are. I'm already planning to make this again for our annual Beach Party!

I cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup.  Is a little runny when first made, but the pasta soaks up the liquid overnight, so cook the pasta al dente.  Delicious!

Made this exactly as instructed; maybe a little less sugar based on other reviews.  Thought when making the dressing that it was going to be too much mustard, but it was perfect.  Added a couple of hard boiled eggs, and could add some olives; just a matter of taste.  Thanks, I will definately use this recipe again.  Very good!

Wonderful recipe!  Got lots of compliments on it.  I made the liquid mixture, but I put about 3 tbsp of mayo into the cooked noodles, and then about 3/4 of that mixture into the noodles.  I also added tuna and hard boiled eggs.  Sprinkled pepper and paprika on the top!

This was way to sweet for my taste.  It would make a great coleslaw dressing.  I would cut the sugar back by half if I make it again. I found there was a little to much dressing. I also added 2 eggs to mine an some cheddar cheese.

Not that you need another glowing review but, here's one, anyway! Didn't change a thing except number of servings; cut it in half .   Delicious and not a scrap leftover.  I look forward to doing this again!

This is an exceptional Macaroni Salad! I didn't think it was too sweet at all, like most did. I added hard-boiled eggs and three kinds of olives to it (green, black and katamala).  Very, Very Good!

I made this for a large group of people and everyone of them LOVED it.  Changes/additions made: used apple cider vinegar, 1/4 sugar, red onion, added frozen corn and peas & boiled egg, paprika & garlic powder. Guests from this dinner are still calling me for the recipe!

FABULOUS!  I made one little change-I only used 1/3 cup sugar.  My husband loves it even though he's usually the 4 cups of mayo for mac salad! Can't say it enough-FABULOUS!

I added red peppers and about 1/4 cup sweet pickle relish.  Loved it!  This makes a TON.  We had 8 adults and finished about half the bowl.  I think I'd cut it in half next time.  A keeper though.

This is a nice base recipe for more salads,excellent mac salad. I did less sugar, I really dont like sweet and used yoghurt mayo. My kids do not like green peppers, so I used roasted red peppers.

Love this recipe!  I have made it several times now, both exactly as written and with a few modifications. I add chopped boiled egg because it just doesn't seem like macaroni salad without it. And I cut the sugar in half because I like a little less sweetness. Once, after I had already started making it, I realized that I was almost out of plain yellow mustard so I used half yellow mustard and half spicy brown. Worked out great. But I have gotten lots of compliments either way. You won't go wrong with this recipe!

A good macaroni salad that was made for a funeral. Not out of this world, but good. Followed the recipe exactly using a red onion. A little on the sweet side. Next time I would reduce sugar to 1/3-1/2 cup.

This salad tasted pretty good. It was very easy to prepare and took very little time. The only thing I wasn't sure about was the amount of sugar because lots of reviewers said it was too much but a few reviewers also said after being left overnight it was just sweet enough. So I compromised by using less than originally called for in the recipe but also a bit more than just half the amount. It came out a bit too sweet so next time I will just use half the amount of sugar. Aside from this the recipe was really good. I had used ziti because that's what I had and it still came out good. Tasted just like the macaroni salads I had previously at parties and restaurants.

Loved the basics of this recipe!  I had some left over kraft macaroni and halved thsi recipe and it made a delicious salad.  I used miracle whip, apple cider vinegar,  red bell pepper and 1 t. onion powder instead of onion.  The rest of the recipe I kept the same only half.  I have been looking for a recipe like this for a long time!  Thanks!!!

Just made this today. Followed the recipe for the sauce and didn't change a thing. Used red bell pepper, carrot, celery, and onion in the salad. Halfed the recipe but it still made a bunch! Delicious.

I orginally rated this 2 stars and wanted to throw out the whole bowl. What a mistake that would have been!! The first taste was terrible and FAR too sweet. After letting it sit a few hours it seemed to mellow out and it became DELICIOUS! One of the best mac salads I've ever had. I did cut back on the sugar a bit because that much sugar makes me feel guilty. I absolutly love this recipe and recommend it to everyone....just let it hangout in the fridge a few hours.

This is a good macaroni salad. I liked the crunch of the pepper in it. I made it as written except not adding carrots, I didn't have any. Other reviewers complained about the vinegar taste but we didn't notice it at all. We both like eggs in our salad so next time I'll add some. Other than that, this is a great macaroni salad as written. Thanks for the post!

This is a classic macaroni salad recipe.  I did make a few changes as suggested by other reviewers, thus only 4 stars.  I halved the macaroni, but only decreased the dressing by a quarter.  I substituted cider vinegar and spicy brown mustard for the regular versions and only used 1/3 cup sugar.  It was fantastic.  No need to ever buy it at the deli counter again.

This is a terrific salad!  I'm not a macaroni salad fan typically but this was very, very good.  I did double the mayo because it was pretty dry at first, and I also used apple cider vinegar rather than white vinegar for hubbie's likes.  Keep in mind this makes a TON!!  We will be eating it all week... happily!!!

Really good! I made a few changes.  No carrots, added ground red pepper and 5 hard boiled eggs, used 1/2 FF sour cream and 1/2 lite mayo, mixed Dijon and yellow mustard, and used just under 1/4 c. sugar.  Even though it was "healthier", it still had plenty of taste and went over well.  I love that it is moist, but not mayonnaise-y and soupy! If I had used all regular mayo, I bet it would have gotten 5 stars!

For me, when it comes to macaroni salad, it's all about the sauce and this one is a keeper.  The only change I made was to decreased the sugar to 1/4C.  It was lightly sweet and couldn't be any more perfect.  I like to throw in whatever is colorful and in season as well such as red and orange bell peppers,cucumber, radishes, etc.  I also like to fold in a few chopped hard boiled eggs and some cheese crumbles.  Delicious!

This is the best macaroni salad I have ever made. I have been giving this recipe to all my friends and family. I can't wait for my next cookout because this is going to be 1 of my dishes. I add bacon bits(and a little bit of relish for my husband on his plate) on top as a garnish with a little crunch to it and it was excellent. This will be my macaroni salad recipe for life.....unless my husband gets tired of me making it. Lol

I made this recipe, and it's good! I don't particularly care for vinegar, so I omitted that, and I also added pickle relish to the recipe which my family enjoyed, and chopped boiled eggs. I also loved the addition of shredded carrots. I give this recipe a 5 star rating. Very good!

very good, will make it again.  Didn't put any onion in it.  We didn't think it was too sweet, but thought it was a lot of sugar to put in.  Maybe next time will cut back on sugar just to see.

Not really a fan. Very sweet. Could be good once you get used to the very different flavour. Almost like a coleslaw dressing on pasta salad.

I used 1/2 the sugar called for and this was still too sweet. Maybe this is what Macaroni salad is supposed to taste like?  This is sugar coated pasta . NOBODY liked this. Won't make this again, unless I omit sugar completely.

Best macaroni I've ever had! I made this for my sons Baptism party and everyone loved it! I thought the recipe made a large quantity but everyone had seconds and some even thirds! Before I knew it the bowl was almost empty. (we served 10 people) Here are the changes I made, I used red pepper instead of green, I left out the onion and I used about 1/3 cup of sugar. I also think refrigeration over night is a must! This is a must try, don't skip over this one!

WOW! I made this over the Memorial Day weekend and had none left! My husband raved over this recipe and told me, "it's a keeper"! It doesn't have that lingering after taste that I've found in other macaroni salads and has a nice blend of sweet and tangy! Never will I buy store bought again or make any other! Perfect as it is, made no changes at all!

This was so so good. I made it for memorial weekend barbecue and both my sisters wanted the recipe.  When I went to make it the recipe I cut into my green pepper to find it it was bad on the inside.  I did not have another so I used a red pepper and it still came out fantastic.  I can't wait to make it again using a green pepper.

This is a very tasty, sweet macaroni salad. I loved it although some thought it was too sweet. I didn't change a thing, I just added more grated carrot & more chopped pimento which makes this very good. This salad definitely needs to set for at least 4 hours, mine was overnight. A nice change from the basic macaroni salad recipe, colorful too. It was a bit dry after setting overnight, but didn't really affect the flavor or texture. I will be making this again, thankyou (:

I was really impressed with this recipe!  It was very flavorful even though we started in on it early (after one hour instead of four).  I mostly followed the recipe; as other reviewers suggested, I added some frozen peas (nuked for 2 minutes with a little water, because I forgot to drop them in with the pasta for a minute's worth of boiling), cubed cheddar, and sunflower seeds.  Also, when I made the dressing, I used white wine vinegar (it was what I had, plus it has more flavor than white distilled) and added sugar to taste (honestly, probably only a tablespoon or two).  I halved the recipe, so that could have affected the ultimate outcome, but one of the things that I really liked about this salad was that it wasn't super mayonnaise-y.  The dressing was just enough to moisten it without making it heavy.  Excellent!

Delicious!! I used ditali pasta which worked very well. Red pepper instead of green, personal preference. I added the optional grated carrot. Gave it a little extra color. I threw in about a teaspoon of celery seed. Only other change was rice vinegar. This salad was scrumptious! I served it at an informal family dinner for 16 people. Everyone loved it. Made it again this week, just for me!!

Excellent sauce recipe!! Made it first time yesterday as originally posted, then again today for a function but, and my face is red for this one. I ran out of Mayo, d'oh. Thankfully topping up the mayonnaise required with whole plain yogurt worked. As a slightly healthier/you ran out of mayo alternative :-) Wonderful, and thank you for posting the recipe.

I followed the recommendations of other reviewers and cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup. I love carrots so I grated 2 instead of one. I made this sort of late and only let it chill for 1 hour... the next day it was fantastic, so next time I will prepare it ahead! I loved the crunchiness of all the veggies.

This was so good! I had been craving some macaroni salad, so I decided to make this one and I'm glad that I did! The only thing is that it was a little sweet like other people had stated, so next time, I'll reduce the sugar to maybe half a cup.

I make this often. The only thing I change is I add some shredded cheddar or marble cheese. Make sure you let this sit in the fridge for a while before serving or else it's runny - it's better the second day!

This is the first time I have made macaroni salad, I usually will buy from the grocery store.  It looked very nice, but it was way too sweet.  I tried to negate the sweetness by adding more vinegar and mayo, but that didn't seem to work.  The sugar overpowered the whole salad. I think next time I will have to experiment with the amount of sugar. I am disappointed because I was really looking forward to chowing down on some macaroni salad.  Oh well better luck next time.

If you're looking for a grocery store macaroni salad recipe, this is it. Tastes just like store bought, which is what I didn't want. It has a very tart, salad dressing taste, even tho I used real mayo.  My hubby & daughter liked it tho.

This is THE BEST macaroni salad!  I've made it a couple of times and it is more delicious the longer it sits.  Try to make it at least 6 hours before you want to serve it - even the day before if you can.  I brought it to work and my co-workers loved it and begged for the recipe.  A friend has made it many times since I shared the recipe with her and everytime she tells me how much her family enjoyed it.

This is a big improvement over my previous attempts at macaroni salad.  I followed the suggestions to cut back on the sugar and I'm glad I did.  I used red onion, but cut back on the quantity.  The salad did absorb the dressing while it chilled, so next time I plan to only put part of the dressing on, chill, then add the rest of the dressing just before serving.  This one's a keeper!

This recipe was really good and different than most macaroni salad I have made.  You get both a tangy and sweet taste from the sauce.   I did reduce the sugar by about 1-1/2 tablespoons.  DEFINITELY refrigerate overnight.  I served it after 4 hours being refrigerated and the sauce was runny and didn't cling to the macaroni.  It wasn't very good the first night.  The next day the sauce was thick - clung to the macaroni and was perfect.  What a difference! I guess the extra time helped the macaroni absorb some of the sauce.  Next time I'll probably add some small chunks of cheddar.

Oh my goodness!!! The BEST macaroni salad I have ever made. The second time I made it I left out the green pepper and the optional carrots and pimentos and put in petite frozen peas and a little more celery instead. Wow! I will not be looking for a new recipe for macaroni salad again ever, this one is very literally PERFECT! YUM

The best mac salad recipe!  This is better on day #2 and #3 so plan ahead.  I did not add mustard and it still came out great.  I will never buy store bought again.  Thanks for sharing.

My best friend and I made this salad for her wedding reception.  It was extremely easy.  I have to say I hate macaroni salad. My mom hates macaroni salad. But when we tried this we both loved it.  It was wonderful. I think it tastes better sitting overnight, just keep extra sauce on hand because it can dry out overnight. I recommend it. It's really easy to make.

The first time I made it with Miracle Whip, which made it far too zesty. I added some cheddar cheese and Ranch dressing to tone it down. Did not have green pepper, but added frozen peas (rinsed in a colander to thaw). After 6 hours in the fridge, the flavor had mellowed and everybody loved it.

The second time I followed the recipe, including using regular mayonnaise. I liked the Ranch dressing and cheddar cheese, so I added them again. Also diced some ham and tossed that in.

Made it a couple more times and followed the recipe exactly. Making it again today, but with a bit less mustard and sugar, as that is what I prefer.

This is a great recipe that can be easily tweaked according to your tastes and what you have on hand. For best flavor and consistency, be sure to 1) let the sauce-veggie mix "mellow" in the fridge for at least a couple of hours and 2) not mix the sauce into the pasta until an hour or so before serving.

I needed a quick pasta salad to bring to a cookout we were going to this weekend, so I picked this one.  I was tempted to cut back on the sugar as others had advised, but didn't because alot of other people said it was perfect.  I guess this is just a matter of taste, because we all thought it was just waaayyy to sweet.  I will try it again cutting back on the sugar, because the rest of the salad was good.

My goodness, this is good! I used organic rice vinegar, reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup, and used honey mustard instead of regular mustard (but I'm sure it would be great with any kind of mustard). Also added some white pepper for extra zing. Just delicious.

I reduced this to 6 servings and it still made a ton, which is fine but definitely for a party.  I did not use sugar or pimento but 2 Tbs of sweet pickle relish instead and apple cider vinegar and grainy brown mustard, and it was delicious!

Snaps for JMOR777! This recipe is wonderful. I decided to make this on a whim and didn't check to see if I had the ingredients I needed. I had the basic sauce just not all the extras. I used red pepper, no onion and less sugar. The best discovery I ever made was using a bag of frozen veggies instead of chopping them. The salad stayed so cold even out side! Great way recipe!!!

I loved this recipe.  I made it for my family for a BBQ and everyone loved it. I don't like macaroni salads that are loaded with mayo and this one definitely was not.    Good flavor...highly recommend.

Great basic macaroni salad recipe has just the right amount of tart/sweetness to it.  It really does improve if left for 24 hours.  I always like to tone down my onion a bit so if I don't have a sweet onion I use a regular onion and dice it up small for the salad then soak the diced onion in cold water for 1/2 hour before adding to the recipe it will calm down the flavor of the onion.

I was not a great fan of this recipe.  My idea of a classic macaroni salad doesn't have a taste of vinegar.  By adding the vinegar & sugar it gave the salad a "store-bought taste."  I am an avid user of Hellman's mayo & it tasted like I used Miracle Whip.  The basics are here for your recipe but my preference is to skip the vinegar & sugar.

This was pretty good but way too sweet for us.  I didn't have any celery so I added a teaspoon of celery seed to get a little celery taste.  I will make this again with only a couple tablespoons of sugar and use seasoned salt instead of regular salt.  I cooked the macaroni about 1 minute longer in hopes it would not soak up too much of the 'sauce' and become dry, it worked well as the next day it was still creamy.

This recipe is basically like my own recipe, except with about 1/2 the amount of sugar, and I use Miracle Whip plus diced hard-boiled eggs.  But what I do when I make macaroni or potato salad is I mix up the vinegar, sugar, salt, pepper and yellow mustard and add it to the hot macaroni or potatoes and refrigerate it for a couple of hours or overnight.  This gets more flavor into the macaroni or potatoes.  Also if your dressing seems a little dry, try adding a splash of milk.  At family reunions, etc., my kids would only eat my salads.

Yummy!
The dressing taste is similar to that of the good old broccoli salad.
I made it as directed and loved it.  It was served at a party we had and several guests liked it as well.

Delicious! I omitted the sugar completely as I don't like sweetness in my mac salad at all.

Might have used a little less onion. I used two very small onions instead of one large, and it seems very very oniony!

Overall, excellent recipe. Just like my Mom used to make!

Fantastic! I wound up being short on time and added only one bell pepper, 1/2 a vidalia onion and no celery but people raved about it. My neighbors are all requesting it for the Memorial Day barbeque. I might reduce the sugar to half a cup next time, as is was pretty sweet.

This is a great salad.  I too used a lot less sugar - but I like a tangier taste.  I highly recommend making this a day before needed because the flavor is even better after being refrigerated overnight.

I cut the sugar to 1/4 c. because  others noted it was too sweet otherwise. I only had cider vinegar which I thought was good but then again I like a tangier vinegar. I used a grater to grate the onion and sometimes add baby shrimp. I think this recipe is great! It is creamy without being overdressed and has just the right amount of zip and zing and does seem to please a wide range of tastes.

I had to modify this recipe quite a bit to get it to work. The 4 cups of uncooked Macaroni noodles was a LOT! I had to use twice the mayo and twice the mustard. The vinegar was too strong, and the sugar was way too much. I liked the ingredients, I just had to modify it. My husband liked it, so that is a bonus!

My husband and I really enjoyed this.  It's definitely the vinegar that gives this the right "tang".  I found it tasty even before waiting the "4 hours" before eating.  The sugar is necessary to offset the vinegar which can be overpowering to anyone not used to the sourness.  I added the sugar a tsp at a time after everything was mixed until it "cut" the strong taste of the vinegar.

Waaaay tooo sweet.  Cut the sugar down to 1/8 of a cup and was much better.  If you don't take sugar in your tea or coffee and eat bonbons all day, this recipe will be too sweet for you.

MMMmmmm... only changes I made were acording to our families taste.  I omitted the green pepper and pimento.  Also used 1/4 c sugar and only a little onion because it seemed extra strong.  I could eat this for dinner on it's own!  Very well received, Thank you

Very good. However I did reduce the sugar to 1/3 cup instead of 2/3. It was excellent.

I made this today with a few alterations. I added frozen(thawed)peas, fresh garden grape tomatoes(halved), sweet relish and honey mustard along with the regular mustard. I also used yellow, green and red peppers as this is what I had on hand and used fresh green onions with the greens instead of regular onion. I also left out the pimentos. I did use grated carrots and Miracle whip for the dressing and also the vinegar and sugar. I thought it was spectacular and I usually do not like Macaroni Salad. Thanks for this one I will be making again!

This macaroni salad received rave reviews at my dinner table.  I followed the receipe as is with the exception of using whole wheat elbow macaroni and ommitting the onion (because I didn't have one).  I also added 3 hard boiled eggs as a previous reviewer suggested because my family likes egg in their salads.  I will make this recipe again.

This macaroni salad is the best one I've made!  It has just the right amount of zing vs. sweetness.

This was EXACTLY what I was hoping for! I used half the sugar(and I'm so glad I did), used rice vinegar,  and left out the pimentos. This is the best macaroni salad ever!

I made this for a get together with my family. In my family it is a great honor if the dish you bring is gone first. I am so glad I made it cause it was the first gone... It was very good.. The only change was I didn't have celery and added dill weed instead. I also took others advice and reduced the sugar. Easy and tasty salad

Like alot of other members, I cut back a bit on the sugar and I'm, glad I did- I used a half a cup and it was still pretty sweet. I would probably use even less for next time. I also needed some extra mayo in it. Overall it was a prety good macaroni salad.

I feel pretty silly reviewing this recipe with all the changes/additions that I made.  This is what I did:  basically 1/2 mayo & 1/2 sour cream, 1/2 yellow mustard & 1/2 dijon; green onion instead of regular; added sliced green olives and shredded cheddar (small amount).  Did not use bell pepper (husband's preference).  I also reduced the amount of sugar by about 1/3.  For what it's worth, everything else was the same. Nevertheless, we just loved it, my husband is hogging the leftovers!

I hosted a little get together and this recipe was a hit right away! "Scrumptious" and "Wow" were just a few ways this dish was described! Took the advice of less sugar and it turned out great...thanks for a wonderful addition to my recipe collection!

Great recipe.  It was a hit at my 4th of July bbq.  I didn't have white vinegar, so I used cidar vinegar and cut back a little on the sugar.  Also used about 1/2 the mustard.  As I was pressed for time, instead of chopping all the veggies, I bought a container of already chopped veggie bits at the supermarket and used that (I added onion separately, as that wasn't in the bits).

Overall a pretty good recipe! I think it tastes better the next day actually! I only used about 1/2 cup of sugar and it tasted just about right. I excluded the peppers both bell and pimento and added the carrots, which it needed! Next time I'll add hard boiled eggs to give it a little more in it.

This is my favorite macaroni salad recipe.  Just how my Nanny used to fix it.  My only advice is to make this a day ahead as all the flavors need to soak into the macaroni.  If it is a tad bit dry the next day just add a little milk and stir!  I do omit peppers and carrots although I am sure they are good in the salad if you like them.

Like all these recipes, I replaced the macaroni  with cauliflower, I used Doctor Pepper instead of mayonnaise,  in stead of onion I used sausage, and replaced the celery with Carmel corn...kust kiddingI made the recipe exactly and it was awesome

Really sweet. I always cut back on sugar, but even 1/4 cup was too much. I added some more mustard and then it was very yummy. Next time I’ll do a couple tablespoons sugar. 

I also used 3/4 cup mayo and it was plenty. Have also made it before with plain yogurt instead of mayo which was great. Will half the recipe next time as it’s too much for two people.

It was a very good macaroni salad. My only change would to put no sugar next time. The addition seemed odd to me; so, I only added half but it still made the taste a little funky. I also added kalamata olives to give it a salty kick, and hard-boiled eggs.

This is a very forgiving recipe.  After reading the reviews, here are the changes I made:
used Mircle Whip instead of Mayo. Cut sugar in half.  Used four boiled eggs.  Reduced the onion to 1/2 cup finely shopped red onion. Reduced the Mustard to 1 generous Tablespoon.  As other folks suggested, I mixed in only 1/2 of the dressing.  Refrigerated overnight.  The next day, before my guests arrived, added the remainder dressing.  Yummy!

I used all the ingredients for the dressing part. I  used the recommended amount of mayo and then started adding  less amounts of sugar, mustard and vinegar than called for, tasted and added more of sugar, mustard and vinegar until I was satisfied with the taste. 

Everyone has their own tastes in mac dressing, so adjust it to suit yours.

So good! I didn't rinse the pasta because I wanted it to be a bit sticky so the wonderful sauce would stick. I also cut back on the sugar to 1/4 cup.  Thanks for the great recipe.

this is a fabulous recipe that will be my staple mac salad. Made as directed with the following changes... I used red bell pepper vs green, red onion vs yellow, and added two chopped boiled eggs. I used white wine vinegar - that's what I had on hand. Turned out fantastic, all loved it and it even got a strong nod from my cooking wiz sis.

I've made it several times for the 4th of a July etc .Everyone loves it. My son really likes it .. Not too sweet.. Was looking for one like my mother use to make. This is close... Only changes I made were  1/2 c mayonnaise 1/2 c sour cream.  My mom always used half mayonnaise,half sour cream in both  her macaroni salad and potato salad..

Followed the recipe exactly and IMHO it's the perfect macaroni salad.  Tangy, zippy, great mix of textures, not swimming in mayo, and the flavours all really come together well.  Do leave it in the fridge overnight though, it's much better the next day.

I made this as is except I used more vinegar , and added two cucumbers.  I made the whole box of macaroni and doubled everything. I had it for breakfast lunch and dinner for the next 4 days... We (just me and my husband) ended up finishing the entire bowl!! It is very good! Thank you for sharing!

This is not classic macaroni salad.  The classic doesn't have green pepper in it, but does include some pickle relish - sweet or dill.    Also, waaaaay too sweet for my taste.  1 tablespoon sugar would be plenty.

I had a hankering for some macaroni salad and happened on this recipe.  It looked like a good place to start, of course, I made a few variations:  1). Some reviewers thought it was too sweet so I cut the sugar by half.  Turns out 1/3 cup is sweet enough for me.  2).  I used cider vinegar instead of distilled.  3).  I used Miracle Whip for the dressing.  4).  I used a couple of fresh Red Fresno peppers for the pimento.  5).  I added 1 pound of grated sharp cheddar cheese.  I did put carrot in it so the result is more orange than most macaroni salad.  Does not matter to me -- it's good and it will become part of my repertoire.  I am not much of a cook and it is great to have another yummy dish I can make!

I shouldn't even be rating this but it did motivate me to make a macaroni salad. I added broccoli, snap peas, red peppers, and used bottled Italian dressing, It was very good I am giving it 5 stars because I am sure it would be excellent as printed.

I made no changes. How in the world can you rate a recipe when you've changed it with your own ingredients?? This is not fair to the cooks who are seeking to try the original recipe.

Disgusting! I'll eat darn near anything, including escargot, horse, kimchi, etc, but I couldn't choke down a bite of this. Way too sweet!

This is a pretty good recipe overall.  I read a lot of the reviews and it seems that the main problem with the recipe is the sweetness so I added the sugar last and did so by a tablespoon at a time.  I'm glad I did because 2/3 cup would be way way way too much. I estimate that I used about 2 Tbsp  and it turned out pretty good - everyone loved it. Frankly I don't think sugar is needed at all in this recipe. I always leave out the pimento and carrot and use red bell peppers instead of green . You could also reduce the vinegar a bit.

Did half elbows and half rings. Dressing is perfect! Did not use green pepper.  Added a half of yellow pepper. Also mixed in 10 ounces of tuna and 2 chopped hard boiled eggs. Served it topped with chunks of fresh tomatoes from my garden.

I didn't change this recipe at all and it was way too sweet!  After tasting it, I then started making changes to try to cut the sweetness.  I added eggs, more mayo and vinegar, but it was still way too sweet.  If I make it again I'll only add 2 tsp. of sugar.

I used 1/4c sugar for a double batch and added 7 hardboiled eggs. Didn't add carrot or pimento pepper (because my store had none) but would try that in the future. It was excellent like this and was a huge hit at the grad party I brought it to. I might try adding tuna in the future as well!

Made it according to recipe, but did short the sugar because of the comments of others.  (I underfilled the 1/3 cup measure by about 15%).   Even then I found it too sweet.  Also, I had an overabundance of dressing for the amount of macaroni.

My daughter & I have made this macaroni salad many times.  This time I watched CHEF JOHN'S recipe and combined both recipes.  I used cavatappi macaroni (it's a little fancier than elbows.)  I used a Vidalia onion (sweeter than regular onion), white pepper, 1Tbsp. of sugar and a little garlic powder.  I omitted the jalapeno and poblano peppers.  The major difference I found from watching the video was  not to rinse the macaroni and to allow it to cool
completely and to NOT mix it with oil to separate.  It needs to be sticky and stick to your hands per CHEF JOHN.  Also after cooling & dressing the salad, cover it with the plastic wrap directly on the macaroni.  This was a FANTASTIC salad & thanks to CHEF JOHN for his expertise suggestion.  I will DEFINITELY make this again & again.  Thanks also to GRADEN for the basic recipe.  Now if I can only find a great potato salad recipe.

I've been making this for years and it seems to be a crowd favorite. The adjustments made were: 1/4 cup sugar, and no pimentos. I let it sit overnight. Next time I would only make 1 box of macaroni since the dressing was spread a little thin.

Like another reviewer suggested, I didn't rinse the macaroni off after draining it; I immediately added the vinegar to the noodles instead.  Not sure what kind of difference it made but the whole thing came out great!!

Our favorite recipe for mac salad. I half the recipe exactly as written which is enough for 8 people with some left over.  Did not have pimento, subbed red pepper. I like the crunchy texture anyway. Other than the great flavor, I liked that it does not get runny but creamy. I think I might add one or two hard boiled eggs the next time or try it with Penne Pasta as suggested.  This is definitely a keeper.

This was the best macaroni salad recipe I have found. I usually stick to potato salad because every macaroni salad recipe I tried was not very good. I made it according to the recipe but with only 1/3 cup of sugar. It was a big hit on the 4th of July. Never getting deli salad again.

This is my favorite crown pleasing recipe base I have ever used- like most I also make small changes- First change is less sugar- unless you are used to Hawaiian mac salad and like it sweet! Then I tried it with the new "spicy" yellow mustard- very nice! Also I either cut the macaroni in half or double the dressing, depending on how many I will be feeding- If made as directed and left to sit over night in the fridge, which makes it taste better, the dressing gets completely soaked up. So I reserve half and mix in before serving (after I double it). If I have I also chop some radish for color- or use red peppers as well. I have also mixed in some small cubed cheddar cheese just before serving!

I found this recipe about a month ago & have already made it 3 times with 4 people asking for the recipe! As others suggested, I added the 3 eggs, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, cut back the sugar to slightly less than 1/2 cup, & used green onions (personally not an onion fan). Everyone so far has loved it & taking it to pass at 2 summer get togethers this weekend. Thanks for sharing! ;)

Delicious recipe ! Only thing I changed was I added the three hard-boiled eggs and cut the sugar down to one half a cup . Also I did not use the pimentos , I just added a little extra green pepper . Not too sweet . I doubled this recipe for the Fourth of July picnic I went to . It was gone within 15 minutes of serving . Absolutely fabulous and easy to make .

My family recipe called for one seeded and finely chopped tomato, but not pimento,sugar, or vinegar. The mayonaise seemed to have seasoning enough. For those who do not like - or have handy - any celery - a dash of celery seed works well. After draining the macaroni, I sprinkle with just a tiny dash of olive oil (perhaps 1/2 teaspoon) and stir thoroughly to keep the pasta from clumping. I also add the onions immediately, while the macaroni is hot, so that maximum flavor is absorbed.

I've made this recipe every weekend since I've discovered it and wouldn't change a thing. I am going to try the sauce recipe for potatoe salad, I was told that this is the best for that as well. This recipe is going to be a steady staple this Summer and it may even cross over to the Fall and Winter. Excellent!!!!!

This is a very popular recipe.  When I first started making it I was afraid it would be too sweet and too soupy, but it turns out neither is true.  Works fine as is and is even better the next day.  A good make ahead.  If I take it somewhere for pot luck, everyone wants the recie.

Sorry, I have to have hard-boiled eggs in it for it to be good.

I have been making this basic recipe for 60+ years.  We rarely measure but mix "to taste."  We always add hard-cooked eggs, omit the pimiento peppers,, but add the kicker:  sliced green pimiento-stuffed olives.  Perfect!!

I made this recipe vegan using Just Mayo - the best mayonaise sub out there, trust - and it was perfect. I cut the sugar a bit, but I followed the rest pretty closely. Thank you!

I thought this recipe was awesome! I had about 2 cups of elbow macaroni and 2 1/2 cups left of rotini and decided to make this. I made additional adjustments to the sauce: I used a little less than 1/2 cup of the sugar, added 1 tbsp of apple cider vinegar, 1 1/2 tbsp of sweet relish, 1 tbsp of lemon juice, 1/2 tsp of dill, 1 tsp of celery seeds and stirred the sauce with all the other ingredients listed. It was delicious! Creamy and tangy, with just the right amount of sweet! Definitely a keeper! Thank you Graden for sharing!

Nearly forgot the sugar which made it way too vinegary - however, only added about 1/4 -1/3 cup of sugar and found that provided sufficient counter-balance to the vinegar.  Basic macaroni salad with lots of potential for changing it up

I added the vinegar from my peppercini jar which gave it a great flavor! Then I also added 1/2 c cubed cheddar cheese & 20 sliced Best Maid pickles w/Sea salt (diced) Delicious, this is defiantly a keeper

I halved the recipe and wish I had eliminated the sugar or used just a teaspoon. I also halved the vinegar and it was also too much. After taste testing the sauce I ended up pouring half of it through a strainer in order to save the chopped veggies and added more mayo, mustard and seasonings. I pretty much started over. I'll have to see how it tastes after it sits for a few hours and marinates in the fridge. I like trying new recipes and experimenting. You never know till you try...and I'll try something different next time. Lola

The ONLY change I make when preparing this perfect macaroni salad is that I vary the pasta. Today, I used bow ties.

I am giving it 5 stars because this is the classic recipe for mac salad, but it has way too much sugar.  I have been making this for so long I do the "pinch" method and add what is probably around two tablespoons or so.  I just eyeball it.  I want just enough sweetness to work w/the tart of the vinegar.

I do love JqSmith's idea of making the dressing a day ahead of time for the flavors to meld and then adding it to the pasta the next day.  From now on that is how I will do it.

Made it exactly as is and it's perfect, also made it with Apple cider vinegar and cut sugar in half and it's still amazing. I use a dicer to chop some celery, carrots and onion. Passed this on to more than a few people already and the requests keep coming every time

This recipe was worth making and very good especially if you haven't made macoroni salad before. I made this recipe but added hard boiled eggs and dill pickles. At the same time I did a seperate version but with potatoes to make a potatoe salad (minus a few of ingredients like the pickles that I added, carrots, green peppers, etc...only kept the onions, eggs, and celery along with the mayo mixture and red potatoes ). I actually recommend doing this on potatoes instead!! The mayo mixture is perfect for potatoe salad as someone previously recommended!

I just made this exactly as written and think it turned out great. I will save half without hard boiled eggs since my son in law is allergic, but add a couple to the rest of the family's. Thanks for the recipe!

Since my measuring cup is metric I might have added a little too much vinegar, but other than that this was pretty good and dead simple.  I boiled eggs, chopped them up, and added them to the salad as well.  It definitely tastes better after left to chill over night rather than a few hours.

First time try on this recipe and it works perfectly. It is not very sweet and I think the recipe is very good that it allows me to play with the ingredient without changing the dressing proportion at all. I added some sausage into my salad and it tastes great!

I love this macaroni salad. I make the dressing on the side and add until I'm happy with the combination.  I leave out the optional carrots and pimentos, and add little chunks of mild cheddar cheese.

I was looking for a cold macaroni salad recipe for the extra macaroni left-over when I made Mac and Cheese the other day. This one has a great base sauce - I gave it 4 stars - but I modified it slightly and it's delicious! I reduced the sugar to 1/4 c, reduced the mustard to 1 Tablespoon and the onion to 1/2 of a large onion. I completely omitted the celery, carrot, bell pepper and pimiento. Instead, I added 5 slices crisp, cooked bacon (crumbled), a bit of garlic powder (about 1/2 teaspoon) and one can petite diced tomato (drained). Going back for seconds now...

I followed the recipe exactly, and the results were amazing.  When it was about half gone, I added some bacon bits because I had 'em on hand and there was nothing else on the kitchen radar that called for bacon.  Those bits of fried pork took the recipe to the next level!  The next time I make this (and there WILL be a next time!)  I'll add the bacon right from the git-go.

My daughter came home recently from having dinner with her boyfriend's family begging me to make Macaroni Salad like his Mom had made. I am a terrible cook! So allrecipes.com has become my lifesaver. She didn't particularly like this the first time I served it so we began to tweek and learn. We add 2 Tablespoons of Sweet Relish and 1 Cup of Cole Slaw Dressing. I also leave out the green peppers just because our family doesn't care for them and I cut back on the vinegar by about 1/2. Definitely refrigerate over night. I served it straight after making the first time and I think that was the major reason my daughter didn't like it. But this one has definitely made it into the family recipe file.

My husband who hated macaroni salad loved this!! He said he could eat the whole bowl!! I did as others suggested and only used 1/3 cup of sugar and it still was a little sweet for my taste. I added 3 eggs as we'll and next time will add more. Also to the dressing I added celery seed, garlic powder, and a splash of milk to make it creamier. I also added an extra stalk of celery and an extra carrot. Was delicious

Nice flavour, but a bit on the sweet side.  Next time I will cut the sugar by half and add a bit more salt and pepper to season.

This is a great recipe to play with. I had made this once as is, with the exception of halving the sugar and that I used brown rice pasta. It got a lot of compliments, keeps well. When I made it again I used a special brown rice rotini pasta, added some paprika and it turned out even nicer. Lots of things you could do to modify it to suit your wants :)

I make pasta salads about once a month.  I was craving something traditional after making so many "fancier" pasta salads.  This hit the spot.  Like others, I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup, a little less vinegar, and added 1/3 cup sour cream to make it creamier.  You can add whatever vegetables you have on hand.  I used 1/2 a yellow onion, 1/2 red pepper, 1/2 green pepper, peas, 3 boiled eggs, and cubed cheese.  Really hit the spot for what I was craving!

I gave it 4 stars only because I modified this because of other reviews. I did half the sugar. I did add the carrot which was optional. I added some shredded cheese based on reviews. This got rave reviews even from my daughter who does not eat macaroni salad!!!!  While it is fine after 4 hours in the fridge, it really is even better the next day!  Thank you for such a fine recipe!

I loved the recipe. Just perfect.Although i did some changes. 
I didn't add the celery or pimentos. 
I put apple cider vinegar instead of the white. Put half an onion and half the green pepper and 1 carrot. Added chickpeas, sliced black and green onions, shredded cheddar cheese and 3 boiled eggs.
The other sauce ingredients i kept the same

Giving this 5 stars based on changes. Sorry. I added 1 tsp paprika, 1 tsp garlic powder and 3 hard boiled eggs. Reduced sugar to 1/4 cup. Put two thirds dressing on. Refrigerated for about five hours then put the remaining dressing on. We loved it.

I thought this was pretty good though I used much less sugar because I didn't want it sweet at all. I thought the pimentos added a really nice flavor. I would make this again.

Tried this recipe for the 4th of July 2014, It is amazing. Just as it is. I was kind of hesitant because of some of the reviews stating it was too sweet. It good just as it is. Understanding we all have taste buds that react to different taste in different ways. So I will only say how my taste buds reacted and I love it. Even my nine years old who hates everything loved it. I kinda was nervous because of the celery and onions which she hates, she watched me make it and was saying no mom no onions and no celery, but I wanted to make it as the recipe called for at least. So if I didn't like it I would adjust the next time. All my guests loved it and wanted the recipe. Next time I may make it as it is on the recipe but add shrimp, or crab meat, or maybe chicken. Glad I foud this recipe. It beats my old favorite by miles. Taste better than my old favorite from the deli. There's a new mac salad in town for this family.

Loved it and will definitely make this again. I will cut the sugar to 1/3 cup of sugar next time. I used a red pepper in place of the bell pepper because that was all I had. It added a nice color to the dish without changing the recipe too much. I also added 6 chopped hard boiled eggs because I like egg in my macaroni salad.

I use 2 16oz boxes (alot of us), just adding the green pepper and onion for vegetables, sometimes adding some drained cans of tuna too. After the sauce is mixed (I use a little less vinegar and sugar than stated) in with the pasta I sprinkle and mix in some dill weed and cilantro. I've also made this only using the sauce, grilled chicken strips and cooked, frozen broccoli. This is a regular at family cookouts and a favorite.

This is a very delicious dish!  I didn't add carrots or pimento because I didn't have them on hand.  I did add a 5oz can of tuna though.   It was a hit with the whole family even a 2 yo and super picky husband.

This is fine if you like the mass produced flavor of your local grocery deli. The comments I heard were more concerns about why Mom didn't make the macaroni salad.

After dumping in the 2/3 cup sugar, I read the comments and realized this was probably a mistake. If you did this, not to worry! Just add an extra 1/2 cup mayo, 2 more celery stalks, an extra (red) onion and green pepper, 2 more cups of pasta, and sprinkle garlic powder and paprika liberally. That is what I did and I think it turned out great.

I prepare a very similar recipe all the time, especially in summer months, and it is always a hit with family and friends.  I add cheddar cheese, cut into small cubes, and normally do not add onion or carrots (as a personal choice).  Other than that, recipe is the same!!!  I do find that on the 2nd or 3rd day, if there's any left, you have to add a bit more mayonnaise to keep it moist!!  If you haven't tried this one, it's definitely one to  add to the top of your list!!!

I liked this recipe, but I'm not a fan of a strong mayonnaise taste. My husband on the other hand is and he did not like this recipe as much as other macaroni salads. He did say it tasted better on the second day than on the first. I however thought it was one of the best ones I've had!

Oh dear me. This was phenomenal and I found it quite difficult to stop eating. I halved the recipe, and since I didn't have any pepper, omitted it. I also added two chopped hard-boiled eggs, because that's the way my mom always made macaroni salad, and---what can I say?---I love it that way. Very, very good!

This macaroni salad was so good we didn't even wait to refrigerate it before eating. Then, immediately after breakfast this morning we ate more. I reduced the mayo and sugar (also used organic cane sugar)just slightly but followed everything else exactly. Will definitely be making again!

Fantastic my first time ever trying to do a macaroni salad. I too added boiled eggs. I did not add celery.
Only problem ( NOT WITH SALAD) the adjustment chart diode not allow for smaller serving.

This is wonderful!  This makes a huge salad so look out!  I cut down the sugar to 1/3 cup, added pimentos and about 1/2 cup of chopped cheddar cheese (very small chunks, about 1/4").  The salad complemented a Thai Red Curry dish I served for dinner.  Plenty of salad left over, which I don't mind a bit!!!  This recipe is so simple and definitely a keeper.  Thanks for sharing Graden!!!!

We love the dressing for this salad!   I used it today on potato salad, same dressing just 6 or 7 potatoes - 5 hard boiled eggs - 3 stalks celery - 1/2 large red pepper diced - 2 medium dill pickles diced same size as celery.   YUMMY !!   Best potato salad I ever made and I'm old!

I found it turned out to taste like honey mustard. To alter this recipe I would probably cut down the sugar as well as the vinegar and mustard, as the dressing that was made straight from the recipe was very intense.

I'm not sure how "classic" this is but it has a good foundation for greatness.  I liked the addition of sugar, though I reduced the amount to 1/3 cup.  It rendered a delicate sweetness, and balanced well with the other ingredients.  There was definitely something missing, so I added 3 hard cooked eggs as others suggested, sliced black olives, and cooked green peas.  I also suggest using green onions as they have more flavor.  Personally I don't like bell pepper in my mac salad, so I omitted it.  The dressing stays nice and keeps the pasta moist in the salad, with no need to add anything else prior to serving.  Great for potlucks.

I was curious about the amount of sugar, so I decided to try this to see if it worked.  It did not.  The sugar was overpowering, making the dressing more fitting for a fruit salad than a standard picnic standby.  I remade the recipe, and dropped the sugar to 1 Tablespoon.  It turned out just fine.  I would maybe go 2 tablespoons if you hae a particularly sweet tooth.
As for the rest of the recipe with less sugar, this turns out a very standard, expectable, maccaroni salad.  It isn't particuarly spectacular or memorable.  It would do, but just isn't all that memorable.

I wanted to make a different side so I chose this to try, everyone loved it.  The only thing I did wrong was, the recipe called for 4 cups macaroni, so I brought 2, 16oz. boxes of macaroni.  I didn't realize the once one box of macaroni cooked it would equal 4 cups, so I had to add more ingrediants.  Just wanted to put that in my rating in case there were others that didn't know that too.

I love this recipe! It's always a hit at parties, but I cut the sugar by half. I find it way too sweet for my taste.

I have never made a traditional macaroni salad before but this turned out fantastic.  I did make a few changes due to what I had on hand.  I didn't have yellow mustard so I used spicy brown, I was low on yellow onion so I used red, and I was all out of green bell pepper, but I had a very small jar of pimentos, so I added those.  I think these were minor changes so I know the original recipe is solid.  If you like spicy brown mustard on your sandwiches I highly recommend it for this recipe, it was wonderful!

Great because I omitted the sugar and used condensed milk, jalapeno mustard, and added olives and pickles. A success!

I combined this recipe with Kim's Macaroni Salad from this site and it made a PERFECT macaroni salad!  I liked the apple cider vinager from Kims better than regular white.  I also added pepperoncinis, overall very delicious!

I've made this recipe several times and its always a big hit! As noted by previous reviews, I cut the sugar in half and prepare the recipe the day before to allow the flavors to marry overnight. An excellent, easy to make recipe!

I made this recipe for our yearly family camping trip and it was about gone the first day. I made night before we left and let sit for almost 24 hours in fridge. It was delicious beyond words and everyone is demanding I make it again this week lol (especially my kids!). Thank you for sharing this and so glad I came across it!

pretty close to what Mom used to make. I use Miracle Whip instead of mayo, if for no other reason, Miracle Whip can withstand setting out little longer without worrying about spoiling in the heat of the sun on a picnic. I use little less sugar, 1/2 cup is good. Substitute only one tablespoon of prepared horseradish instead of mustard. I also like little more celery, some frozen peas go well in this salad, and maybe some canned meat like Turkey Spam or some other. Adding the meat can make this dish a meal in itself.

excellent and simple.  I added a little dill and pickled jalapeno instead of the pimento because that is what I had on hand.  It was a bit too sweet. I think I will half the sugar for the next go around.

This is a real winner!  Due to my family's tastes I only added the vegetables they liked but other than that I followed the recipe as written.  This recipe can be adjusted so easily to adding or deleting any vegetable that suit your family's taste.  I did not have enough time to make it the night before but even after four hours in the ref. it was still DELICIOUS!

This is a good basic recipe and was a big hit at my 4th of July BBQ yesterday, but I scaled way back on the sugar, to about 1 TBSP, as my family prefers tangy and spicy over sweet entrees and side dishes. The other proportions were great and I have added it to my recipe box with the amendment.

Good base recipe!  Thanks!  I cut back on the sugar and vinegar & it was still yummy sweet.  Skipped the mustard altogether(I just don't care for yellow food, lol).  Didn't have any peppers or pimento so I threw in some frozen peas, chopped tomato, cut-up string cheese & crumbled bacon. I always toss in parsley with any salad and I used rotini instead of elbows.  What a very pleasant surprize!  Perhaps not what the poster intended, but good anyway!! I may throw some sunflower seeds on the next bowlful as well, lol.

This recipe was great! The only change I made to the recipe was to decrease the amount of sugar to 1/4 cup.  I did add chopped hard boiled eggs and cubes of cheddar cheese which complimented the flavors nicely.  I followed other recommendations to add half the dressing the night before the other half an hour before serving.  Made it for a company party and everyone loved it!

I like the carrots celery and green peppers and the tang of the vinegar that said no one liked the sugar or mustard . It's not bad but if your like my family and don't eat sugar on a regular basis don't try this or just get rid of the sugar before you start.

I prepared this salad according to the recipe and it was ok. It was a bit different than my usual creamy pasta salad and I will likely stick with my regular but I wouldn't hesitate to try this.

I always use equal amount vinegar and sugar in these type of dressing recipes. Usually not more the 2 or 3 TBL. Seems to always come out right that way. My mama taught me this

This recipe is perfect, the only thing I did differently was I halved the recipe, added 4 hard boiled eggs and 1 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese. Also I didn't add any of the optional items. This has already became my go to recipe for macaroni salad!!!

We love this recipe. A touch of sweet, tart, and a dash of mustard. The rating of 5 stars is right on. I did not change a thing, like to try recipes as they are and see if I want to change. I wanted it just as it was. Will be using this one a lot.

I loved this recipe but I did make a few changes.. I cut back the sugar to about 1/4 cup an vinegar just a little bit.  I love eggs in my macaroni salad so I added 6 to it.  I doubled the mayonnaise.I did add some paprika an some fresh parsley on top an put in fridge.. I will make this again.. It was a hit here with my family..

I followed this recipe with only adding 1/4 cup of sugar and even that was too sweet. It also made a very yellow salad with all of the mustard that was added. It tasted like those acidic deli counter salads. We tossed this. Now on the look out for a good basic mac. salad from this site.

I am addicted to this stuff! I seriously can't stop eating it. Definitely make it a day ahead. I didn't use the carrots or pimentos (personal preference) but did add 2 cans of low sodium tuna since we always had tuna in our mac salad growing up. A very simple recipe but a staple in my house now.

This macaroni salad is the best I've ever tasted.  My family now calls it "Bangin' Macaroni Salad" and we no longer buy from the grocery store.  It's become my new job during the summer. :-)  I add the carrot, but not the pimento peppers.  I also add garlic powder.  I use lowfat Mayo and cut the sugar to 1/3 cup, to make it a little healthier.

I made this exactly like the recipe without the optional shredded carrots. It is awesome! If you want a make salad that taste like it is from the store's deli but with your own fresh ingredients, this is it!! I have been looking for a make salad that tastes like this for what seems like forever. Thanks you!!

I've made this many times through out the summer and I really like it! Everyone loves it. I like to switch it up a bit every time I make it. Sometimes I add all the veggies, sometimes I will only add red pepper, peas, and cubed chedder cheese (my favorite). And even though the sauce is sweet, I really like it. Much better than deli Macaroni Salad!

Made for the millionth time. It's great as written but we add less sugar, less mustard and most definitely refrigerate overnight! Also, the following day RESIST THE URGE to add any more Mayo. Just give it all a good stir and your set. When it sets overnight, it absorbs all that goodness and imo you are left with a perfectly made macaroni salad. Not at all too wet or creamy. I think it's perfect! We use one full box (16oz) of pasta for this recipe.

This is wonderful as prepared. For my family's taste, I omit the onion and bell pepper and sometimes add crumbled bacon, which makes it even more delicious than it would be otherwise, if you're a real human and love bacon. But terrific recipe as written!

This was incredibly delicious! I didn't have elbow pasta, so I used tiny shells. I was getting bored with all the italian dressing and plain mayo style salads. The sweet mustard sauce was the perfect change! It was almost like some honey mustards. It was very addicting. There is a lot of sauce at first, but that is because it hasn't set yet. There is a lot of room to play and perfect it to your taste, so there really shouldn't be any negative reviews. In fact, I don't like raw, crunchy veggies in my cold salads, so I steamed mine first. It's all preference. Add ingredients, remove, change quantity. Just play with it. I know I will. But my DH loves it too, so either way, this is a keeper for my house!

I LOVE this dressing! I use different pasta ingredients most times...just pasta and frozen peas.....maybe next time  celery or green pepper. It's the dressing that gets 5 stars! Wonderful!

I would highly suggest cutting the sugar down to at least 1/3 cup.  It is far too sweet with 2/3's sugar, and I couldn't counteract the flavor.

My rating scale (cause number of stars is subjective): 1-Didn't like it, 2-It's okay, 3-Liked it, 4-Loved it, 5-Can't get enough of it. Maybe it's just me but this tastes almost exactly like a a particular chicken chain's mac salad.... delish! Oddly, I was asked a couple of times how much cheese I used???

I reduced the amount of mayo and sugar and mustard.  I really like how this doesn't dry out like a lot of pasta salads tend to do.  I have used this recipe three times recently and think it may soon become my go to pasta salad!

I liked this recipe. The only changes I would make is using less mustard! The mustard flavor was a little strong. I did add more noodles as others suggested and there was still plenty on sauce.

My daughter, who thought she didn't like macaroni salad, tasted the dressing before I added the macaroni and said it tasted "just like honey mustard, only better" :) And I thought the dressing was exactly what I wouldn't like - I grew up on plain mayonnaise macaroni salad. My family doesn't like peppers or pimentos, and I didn't have celery, so mine was simple with just carrots but it was DELICIOUS! We ate it all in one sitting but next time I'll make sure it sits overnight - I can tell the flavors would have been even better if we'd waited. I'll make this a LOT this summer!

This recipe is so good.  Left out the bell pepper and pimentos but followed it to a tee.  Took it on a recent family vacation and everyone gobbled it up.  Will definately make again!  I actually reminds me of a salad my grandma used to make with shrimp.  May have to add that next time!

I added paprika and made these substitutions: Used 1/2 as much sugar as called for (and substitute Splenda if that's your thing). Used 1/4 cup mayo & 3/4 cup Greek yogurt.

Also good with thawed frozen peas.

I just made this salad today.  I loved the flavor.  I agree with quite a few, that the flavor reminds me of coleslaw....which we love.  Thanks to all those reviews, I'm going to add a few more ingredients later.  I just joined allrecipes the other day, and I'm impressed with the reviews.  So many other websites have lots of reviews with out people trying the recipe at all.  Thanks!!  I'll be back!

I have modified this a little . I use a little less vinegar, 1/2 tablespoons less on the mustard, 1/2 large onion,  minced 5 large carrots and a half of a large cabbage in an immersion blender. Use also the diced pimentos in a jar. Taste better the next day. Can use the whole onion if eaten the next day because the strong onion taste is neutralized  and does not taste as strong.

Simple, easy, and very classic.  Do cut the sugar in half, there's no need for the amount of sugar the recipe calls for.

Great base, I did modify: used bow tie pasta, left out peppers and added black olives(diced), chopped celery, cubed cheddar and cubbed ham. Also added 1/2 tsp garlic powder and 1/2 tsp paprika. HUGE HIT at little league potluck with kiddos and parents:) WILL SHARE AND MAKE AGAIN.  Possibly next time adding red onion as I left out for kiddos and adding red bell pepper.

This is a great macaroni salad recipe to use throughout the year. I have added par-boiled frozen green peas or small broccali flowerettes. I am not a pepper fan and always use purple onion. Cubed ham can be added. I do like the basic recipe and the dressing which makes the salad.

Made this for Father's Day cookout the night before.  I reserve some of the dressing.  The morning of, add the rest of the dressing (to coat) and veggies, because I think they stay crisper.  You can, obviously, add or omit whatever veggies you like.  I add broccoli, cukes and red and yellow pepper.  Omit the onion and celery, as I'm not a fan.  My favorite of several pasta salad recipes I have.

This is the macaroni salad recipe I have used for years, just did not have a reference point as to dressing amounts. I made as stated, it was a bit dry and then made it again.Added 1/4 cup more mayo and 2 more tbs. of vinegar. Omitted the green pepper, imo it overtakes the other flavors. Also used sliced green olives instead of pimentos. My mom uses this recipe and adds sliced hard boiled eggs.

Very good macaroni salad.  I read the reviews before I made it and did decrease the sugar by half.  It tasted great like that.  The green peppers and onions also gave it a good crunch.

We really liked this recipe.  It is a very good, basic recipe that you can trust.  I did find it to be just a little bland, so I kicked it up myself just a tad to make it more flavorful.  The changes I made were to double the sauce, add about 8 eggs, diced, cut back on the sugar some (I don't care for things to be too sweet.)  I also don't like a lot of crunchy things in my mac salads so I cut the onion back to about 1/4 cup.  To make up the difference for flavor, I used a generous sprinkling of onion powder as well as about 1/2 tsp. of celery seed.  Also, used more mustard than it calls for.  It sounds like a lot of changes, but they were very minor.  I would just sprinkle until i liked what it tasted like.  I will def. make this again.  Also, we had some left over cooked shrimp, and it was very refreshing to eat as a main dish salad.

I've been craving Macaroni Salad so I made this recipe today.  LOVE it!!!!  I only had Apple Cider Vinegar on hand and just used 1/4 cup of sugar.  It is SO GOOD.  Thanks for sharing.

I made this salad but used only 3/4 of the sugar called for. I thought it was still a bit too sweet. I added in some more mustard & salt and that helped a bit. Next time I make it, I will only use 1/2 the sugar. It does make a very tasty classic macaroni salad....

Sorry, I didn't have the last 4 ingredients (celery, bell pepper, carrot, or pimento), but based on the rest of the ingredients, this was delish! The sweet (sugar) and tangy (vinegar) complemented each other, very creamy and smooth. I would love to try it with the rest of the ingredients! Thanks Graden for this basic but delicious macaroni salad recipe! :)

Definitely a keeper!  I also cut the sugar in half and added a couple of hard boiled eggs.  Tasted it before storing and could not stop eating it!

The perfect base to a classic mac salad! I did cut back on the sugar and actually substituted with splenda, used apple cider vinegar instead and added chopped green olives instead of just the pimentos. Delish! Thanks!!

I think this recipe is good, but I found it to be ridiculously sweet. I only used 1/4 cup of sugar like others said, and still, too much for me. I did not have yellow mustard on hand, so I used 1 tbsp of spicy brown mustard. I thought it came out pretty bland, but I'm not sure if it was the mustard or not.

Delicious!  I read the other comments and reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and it tasted just fine.  Instead of pimento in mine I finely diced up about a half of a pickled jalapeno.  It provided just a nice little bit of lip tingling heat.  I will be making this one again!

I enjoyed this easy recipe for a Mac salad that was so tasty. I used salad dressing (the white creamy, "whipped" kind) as half of the mayo to get that extra tangy flavor I remember from my grandma's recipe. I skipped the celery, and added a couple of hard boiled eggs. Even after a couple of days in the refrigerator it was delicious!  Will make it again and again, great with a burger and fresh fruit for a summer dinner!

I found this recipe a year or two ago and still use it every time we barbecue or have a party!!! Absolute favorite macaroni salad! The only thing I change is I add a little more mustard and vinegar. I also add red and yellow bell peppers for color and omit the pimento peppers. DELICIOUS!

Been making this recipe for years though I had recently lost my original recipe card, and couldn't for the life of me remember the measurements! I am glad someone else uses this recipe as it is amazing! Thanks for posting it; now I can make it again! If you haven't tried this, you MUST. Trust me, no matter where you go it's always a huge hit. I can't tell you how many compliments I have receivd over the years.

This was very good! I made some changes. I used light, eggless mayo and cut the sugar back to 1/4 cup to make it healthier. I also used red bell pepper instead of green for color, and orecchiette pasta instead of elbow macaroni because the store I was at didn't have any. Everyone really liked it!

I have made this several times as written, but found it to be a bit dry the next day.  Just made it this week, and only used 3 cups of macaroni, instead of the 4 that the recipe calls for.  It was a lot creamier the next day, just the way we like it.

I used only 1 T mustard, as I am not a big mustard fan and I also didn't use the pimento peppers. I realized that rainbow pasta would also make this a great recipe.

was pretty good.  reminded my family of the taste of potato salad.  did end up adding frozen peas and shredded colby jack. used both shredded white onion and thinly sliced green onions.  will omit the celery or have it sliced super thin next time as i didn't like the flavor that much.  will definitely make again but will keep working with the ingredients ... roasted red peppers are going in next time :)

It was a good salad, but I found it a little too sweet. I made it again and cut the sugar in half and it was perfect.

Great sauce for this salad, although I'm going to add less sugar next time to make it a little more tangy

I just made this and it is DELICIOUS!  I don't even like macaroni salad but this tastes very different than traditional macaroni salad.  Try it, you won't be disappointed.

Everyone loves when I make this! It's sweet and not as creamy as regular macaroni salad. I made this for a party and I had everyone asking for the recipe. I dont like to use a whole green pepper, usually about a half.

I put a little less sugar, don't use carrots, and haven't tried it w/ green pepper only because I usually don't have any. But I love this macaroni salad and I almost never like macaroni salad. I don't know what the difference is, but this one's wonderful!

I made this before Hurricane Irene knowing we'd want food that could be eaten cold in coming days. I just used the ingredients we had, so onion and green peppers (no celery, no carrot or pimento peppers). It seems very versatile and would work well with lots of different variations.

I made the dressing almost exactly - I substituted apple cider vinegar for white because that's what I had. 

I was a little worried it was a bit sweet and mustardy but in the end it came out really well. Everyone loved it! So, it was quick and easy and was enjoyed by all.

I will definitely be making again and playing with different vegetables to include and maybe a bit less sugar. A fantastic recipe to have as a basic for barbqs etc.

I usually shy away from macaroni salad because it is often bland or just tastes like mayo.  Not the case here!  I did cut the sugar in half though and it was plenty sweet.  I used white ground pepper as opposed to black and yellow bell pepper, not green (what I had in the fridge).  I did add the grated carrot and put relish in place of the pimento.  I made the dressing the night before and mixed it with the cooked macaroni the day of my BBQ.  It was a hit!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was the best homemade macaroni salad I've ever had - except that it gets too dry. I'm going to try adding more of the sauce next time.

This macaroni salad is OUTSTANDING!!!  My family LOVES it!!  Just the right amount of sweet and tangy goodness.  Whenever I bring it to parties, people just can't get enough.  People always request the recipe.  Luckily I know it by heart because I make it so much.  The dressing would be great for cole slaw, too!!

Delicious!  I made this for dinner last minute and only had time to refrigerate it for 15 minutes before serving it.  Tne sweetness did decrease a bit and I suspect that tomorrow it'll have an even more balanced taste.  As for changes, I added 1/4 cup sugar instead of 2/3 cup, added red bell peppers instead of green, carrots and only 1/2 yellow onion and left out the pimentos.  I also sprinkled in celery seed which I love in mayonnaise-based salads.  I will definitely make this again.  Thank you for this!

This is a very tasty recipe.  Here is the only thing I changed simply for preference only:

-No celery, pimentos and I added some frozen sweet peas.

As for changes I felt were needed, the dressing tastes great, but as others said I used only 1/4 cup sugar and I think more was needed to give it a creamier texture.  So I used the exact same ingredients in the dressing, but just used 1.5 times the amount listed.  So instead of 1 cup mayo, it was 1.5 cups, sugar instead of my scaled down 1/4 cup I used .375 cups(1/4 * 1.5)  etc.....  Will make again, probably today in fact!

What a great recipe!!! I didnt have pimento peppers and wanted the colour so instead, I cut down the green pepper to 1/2 and added 1/2 red pepper.  Additionally I added a can of corn drained and this was hit and will be made again and again for our family.

I cut the vinegar and the sugar in half as a personal preference, and used a mix of red and orange bell pepper instead of green. I also added about 1/3 cup frozen peas. It is good, but I think next time I'll cut the sugar back to 1/4 cup.

A really good macaroni salad recipe! I used only 1/3 cup of sugar and still found it a little sweet. I added some garlic powder, ancho powder & a teaspoon of relish. Will definately be making this macaroni salad recipe again!  Thank-you!

I made this for a barbecue birthday party. It was gone in minutes. I only got to have a little bit of it and it was awesome.  Everyone commented on it and wanted the recipe.  I am making again right away by request of my family.  I didn't change a thing.

I love macaroni salad, but wanted to jazz up my recipe.  I tried this one and it was a huge hit at my cookout.  My teenage nephews absoulutely loved it!! One even asked me to make it for his bday in February :-).  Needless to say, this one is a keeper.  
I used roasted peppers, added eggs and relish, and I cut back on vinegar and sugar.  DELISH!!!

I have made this recipe multiple times now and everyone LOVES it! I did reduce the sugar and did not end up using all of the liquid once combined only because my husband is not crazy about "wet" salads. I have tried this with elbow macaroni, farfalle, and gemelli and they were all fantastic!

I used Bragg's apple cider vinegar, reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup, and used an orange bell pepper. This made a great side dish for dinner on a sunny day!

It's pretty good.  I cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup and found that to defineltly be sweet enough.  Anymore would be too much.   All-in-all it was a good macaroni salad but with all things it's just a matter of preference and tweeking it to accomodate your personal taste.  I'll be keeping this recipe for sure:)

Macaroni salad is traditionally a sweeter salad than other pasta salads. That being said I thought this was really good, but I did tweak it a little. I cut way down on the onion, to around a 1/4 cup (personal preference!), and like others I cut down on the sugar and added some sweet relish. I didn't have any green peppers so I cut up some baby carrots for extra crunch, and added 3 boiled eggs at the suggestion of other reviewers. I also put in a small jar of pimento stuffed olives because I love them. I added the celery too and the result was delicious! Everyone has different tastes and tweaks recipes accordingly, but had I made this following the recipe to a T I'm sure it would have been just as good!

Great recipe for the salad dressing.  I've been looking for something other than the typical salty yet flavourless mayo/sour cream version and this is it.  Although I find the recipe made too much dressing, I used about half of it on the macaroni and kept the other half in the fridge to use at a later time.  Thanks for this one, will make again !

I used Hellman's mayonnaise and because we don't eat green bell peppers, I used chopped red bell pepper. I did opt to use the grated carrot AND the pimentos. Tasty--though quite sweet for us. Like it dosen't really fit. AND, I think it's missing chopped hard-boiled eggs and a little dill. Next time I make this, I'll either cut way back on the sugar or I'll omit it entirely and I'll throw both chopped hard boiled eggs and dried dill weed in.

This was my first homemade macaroni salad.  I really liked it, even my husband who always tells me he doesn't like macaroni salad enjoyed it.....seconds even.

I only used green pepper, red onion and cheddar cheese.  And used 1/2 cup sugar.  Sitting in the fridge for those 4 hours the pasta soaked up the dressing and it wasn't runny.

Really, really bland made as written. Must be doctored with so many additions that by the time it's edible it no longer resembles the original recipe. I'm not sure why this gets good reviews. By the second day the salad was too dry, had to make more dressing. Once the vinegar mellows upon sitting what little flavor their is vanishes. Will keep looking for a better recipe!

This truly is the perfect, classic macaroni salad. Like other reviewers I cut the sugar; with about 1/8 cup sugar the flavors were perfectly balanced. Don't worry if it seems like too much mustard at first, just trust the recipe! It looks very yellow after it's mixed, and if you taste it right after mixing the mustard flavor will seem very up-front--but let it sit overnight and it will be perfect. I made this for a family party and everyone love-love-loved it! This will be my go-to recipe for macaroni salad from now on.

Second time I made this wonderful macaroni salad.  This time I didn't have green peppers so I put cucumbers, black olives and cubed up some colby jack cheese. I kept all other ingredients the same.  It turned out so yummy that had two requests for recipe. Thanks.

I've never made a review although I've been using this site for the last year or so! This salad is very creamy and a bit sweet but the vinegar balances it out nicely...Seems to be even more tasty after is sets up over night! Happy Eats!

This is fantastic!!  The only thing I changed was the sugar. I doubled  everything in the sauce except the sugar. and it was plenty  for a double batch of sauce. Added eggs, tomato, cuccumber, green pepper red onion and sharp cheddar cheese (goes nice against the sweet) Hopefully the people at our family gathering will like it as much tomorrow as I do tonight! Thanks for a great recipe!!

I made this macaroni salad for Thanksgiving.  I added eggs and decreased the sugar and vinegar. My family raved over it and its been requested for Christmas dinner! I give it four stars only because I think you really do need to decrease the vinegar and sugar. I cut the recommended amounts in half. Using the grated carrots doesn't add much to the taste but it makes it prettier

Great recipe!  At first I thought 2/3 a cup of sugar was too much, but it added an amazing sweetness.  This is the best maceroni salad recipe i've ever used.  I didn't add the optional ingrediants or celery.

I definetely would say this is a great macaroni salad starter.  The you can add other stuff.  Mine I like with a mix of sour cream and mayo, eggs, roasted red bell peppers (from a can), parsley or any green herb - not rosemary.  You can make yours a five star easily.

This was very good mac salad.  A little too sweet so I'd reduce the sugar next time.  I used cider vinegar instead of the white, and added some additional mayo after it chilled because the dressing was a little too thin.  Will make again.

This is wonderful!! I will never buy store bought again. I only gave it 4 stars b/c I cut back on the sugar and mustard as others suggested. I also cooked the carrots and diced them. I want to let it sit overnight, but I keep taking bites!

This has to be the best macaroni salad EVER!!  It was VERY good!  The only thing I changed was no green peppers b/c my family doesn't like them, I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup and the mustard to 1 tablespoon.  It was delicious!  Thank you!

I thought there was way too much mustard in this recipe.  I used half the amount but it still came out too mustardy.  I'd say a tablespoon is more than enough.  Next time I'll use a teaspoon and a half.  Other than that it was great.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very flavorful, loved it!  I omitted sugar, used Red Wine vinegar in place of white vinegar and it was very good.  This is a versatile recipe, you can add omit as much as you want and it will still be good!

Used red pepper instead of green pepper, so good, don't buy grocery store mac salad, too many preservatives.  This is a good, and fresh alternative.

I am giving it four stars to start.  I just made it, and I did the dressing as directed and instead added dry onions, olives and turkey bacon.  So far, so good!  Can wait to see how it tastes after it has a chance to blend!

Great recipe.  Followed recipe except used 1/3 cup sugar after reading some other reviews.  Didn't add carrots or pimentos.  Loved the flavor, but might use a little less mustard next time.  Thank you, I will definately make this again.

I have made it twice...first as directed, but used a red bell pepper instead of green since no one in my family cares for them and deleting the chopped pimento, and because I had it, a RED onion.....it was "ok". Not a fan of that sweet/tart taste. I had one child who detested it and one child who loved it. The other kids were "so-so" with it. The next time I made it, I completely cut out both the vinegar and the sugar and instead of using 2 1/2 tbsp of yellow mustard, I used 1/4 cup honey mustard dipping sauce (I use Kents brand). I left everything else the same like I did before.  Everyone, ALL my kids loved it.  I think the shredded carrots, celery, red onion, red pepper and cucumber gives it a beautiful color contrast and yummy crunch.

This recipe was good but not what i was looking for. Im use to macaroni salad being more of a mayo base without mustard. That being said, with the recipe only calling for 2 1/2 tbs, i thought it would have been fine but still, i think there was way too much mustard in it for what im use to. It reminded me of a potato salad dressing instead of macaroni salad.  Like other people, i reduced the sugar. I halved it then added a little at a time to get to my taste prefrence.  Good salad but ill only make it again when im looking for something different that my usual.

This was delicious, I gave it 4 stars only because it was a little too sweet & I had to cut the sugar from 3/4 cup to less than 1/4 cup. Instead of 2 1/2 tablespoons of mustard I cut to 2. And the recipe made double the amount of sauce than is needed.  Other than that this is a great one! Oh & I added 2 hard-boiled eggs!

This recipe was the first one I used and the first time I made homemade macaroni salad.  I will never stray from this recipe although I will use whatever veggies I have on hand if I don't have time to run to the store.

I made this for my daughters birthday party...it was a huge hit.  I gave this 4 stars for two reasons, it was a little dry for mine liking and I added chucks of cheese.  Next time I will make again with a little more dressing...everyone loved it!!  Thanks JMOR777!!!!

I made this recipe with some modifications based on readers....ie. 1/4 cup sugar, added extra stalk celery, 1/2 cup sour creme, 3 minced garlic cloves, 1 chopped carrot, 1 chopped roasted red pepper (i tend to like a bit more veggies). I did mix sauce and keep separate overnite from macaroni/veg mxture.  What a great salad. Everyone (except maybe the odd real picky 10 year kid) loved it. I am so glad i read the reviews from readers, I found the advice and opinions very helpful. because certain commonalities would appear over and over again.  A KEEPER.!!!!

The flavor of this salad is great!  I give it 4 stars only because it seems to me that the proportion of pasta to veggies is off.  Granted I'm a veggie lover, but there were just not enough in this salad.  Seemed like a ton of pasta to just a few veggies.  I will make this again and again I'm sure...but with more celery, peppers, onions, etc.

Loved it!  I made this for my husbands work picnic, had to feed 36 people, I always dislike it when someone changes the recipe and gives it 5 stars, but have to admit after reading other reviews I did everything exact with the exception as I only put 1 tablespoon mustard but the basics for this recipe is absolutely the BEST!!!  Everyone at the picnic raved and not a macaroni was left!!! My husband balked at bringing the macaroni salad because it has never gone over in the past. I will definately be making it again! Thanks for the recipe!

Wow, this is the best macaroni salad! They can get old and boring....not this one.  The dressing is awesome.  I used seashell pasta, cut the sugar to 1/4 cup and added frozen peas.  Enjoyed by everyone.  Thanks for a great recipe!

For years I have been at the mercy of my mother to make macaroni salad for me.  And she doesn't have a recipe so sometimes it was good and sometimes it wasn't so I have been looking for a recipe that tasted like hers (when it was good) and I've found it.  Thank you JMOR777!  I've made this for several cookouts this summer and everyone loves it!  The only change I made was to add a 1/2 cup of sour cream and I chop up three hard boiled eggs in it.  I only use 3 cups of the macaroni, otherwise I think it gets too dry.

The saladd was a great succes at the party. I did not measure macaroni, so I had to add more mayonnaise. I prepared it the day before, and the next day I added some sour cream. I also added can of carrots and peas and mild white chedar. It is the taste of the sause that makes it so tasty.

Great... exception, suggest sugar to taste; this was too sweet for me, but, as the other reviews indicate, this is a subjective thing... as is most everything in cooking! :^)

I decided to make this for a BBQ. I wasn't to sure about the amount of mayo required for this recipe at first. However, I followed the recipe as is and made the salad and it was a big hit!

This was easy to make but ended up being very runny.  I did what another member suggested, added the mayonnaise mix to chilled macaroni about 30 minutes before serving and it was still pretty runny.  I also only used 1/4 cup of sugar so it wouldn't be too sweet.  Great flavor though.

I just made this recipe and it would be good, but I would use a lot less sugar than the recipe says. Otherwise a good recipe.

Very good!  Maybe a little too watery.  I also substituted red pepper for green pepper and added some chopped pickles and cheese cubes.

I was worried about making this.  I've never made a macaroni salad.  But it was a hit!  I will make this again without any alterations.  It was prefect as written.  It taste similar to a macaroni salad at a good salad bar.  Thanks for the recipe!

My family is not big on macaroni salad, but we wanted another dish for our 4th of July dinner and I tried this... WOW! It's incredibly good, you can taste all of the flavors evenly, and - best of all - it's not "mayonnaise-y" in the least! Two thumbs up!

This salad, oh my goodness. Good the first day; better the second!   I used cucumber instead of celery and added a few boiled eggs, like others suggested.  Also, I only added a couple of spoonfuls of sugar because i like my dressings tangy rather than sweet.  SO GOOD!

I added green onions (1 bunch), fresh parsley finely chopped 4 Tblsps, 1/4 tsp celery seed, 1/2 tsp celery salt, replaced 1 tblsp of mustard to dijon mustard, needed more mayo and less sugar. When I make this for a party it all goes. If any leftovers people want to take it home.

I halved the recipe because I thought 10 servings would be too much.  Used 1/4 cup sugar due to people saying it was too sweet.  I used a red bell pepper because that's what I had, and I did not add the carrot or the pimentos.  That said, this was delicious.  I'm picky about my macaroni salad, and I would definately make this again.  If I were going to a bigger function, I would definately make the entire amount, just not for my family of 4.

This salad has WAY too much sugar in it. I should have followed other's suggestions and cut back on it. But I decided to be fair and follow the recipe to a T. It was horrible. I even added more mayo to cut the sugar down and it was still inedible. I ended up throwing the entire bowl away. The dressing in this just isn't right. I will keep to my gramma's macaroni salad recipe.

May not be your favorite right off the page but is so easy to modify to your taste and/or available ingredients.  Like most, we like less sugar - half the amount.  Mustard is an option in our book unless we add eggs.  I make it gluten-free with brown rice pasta and nobody has complained yet.  Maybe jalapeno, cucumber, cilantro, cabbage, & fish next. Very versatile, 5 stars.

I just finished making this for a barbacue get together tomorrow. And of course my husband and I had to try it. Guess what?  This is fantastic!!!! I made it exactly with just one exception, I used Splenda for the sugar. Next time I will had a little less though, as a bit sweet for me, but not my husband. I just love it. Thank you so much for a great versatile dish. Claudia

Very good!  I cut the recipe in half, and only used a little less than 1/3 cup sugar.  I also used a food processor to mince the onion, celery, carrot, and red pepper. I thought this would add more flavor, rather than mincing or chopping it by hand.  Yes, 3 eggs were added to the recipe.  Loved it!

I love this salad and so does the hubby.  I make it in big batches just to eat over several days myself!  I only gave 4 stars instead of 5 because I cautioned and went with reviews to cut down the sugar.  I used exactly half of what it called for.  I figured if it wasn't sweet enough then I could always add in, but not take out.  It was perfect with just half the sugar. Also, I like my mac salads fairly creamy and this is just enough to coat (once it sits and soaks in).  So if you are like me, then do 1 1/2 or double the sauce for the recipe.  But even as is it tastes great. We're a big fan of olives and eggs in our mac salad, so at the end I added those in too.

I followed the dressing recipe exactly but just added garlic powder and paprika.  I used different vegetables since we aren't huge fans of the ones listed.  I used garden tomato, sliced black olives, and green onion.  I also added 4 hard boiled eggs, chopped.  When serving, I add chopped up hard salami and a little bit of fresh dill to make a complete lunch and the kids loved it!  As recommended by others, over-night refridgeration is a must and it really does cut down the sweetness, making it a perfect macaroni salad...and I usually don't even like macaroni salad!  Thank you for an easy, cheap, and yummy summer dish!

I tried this recipe for the first time last night to bring to a bbq today. When I checked on the salad this morning the taste was delicious, BUT it was absolutely DRY DRY DRY. If you are going to make this recipe try tripling the mayo and mustard and almost doubling the vinegar. Or you could cut the pasta in half (which might be better if you are just making for your own family). This recipe made an overflowing aluminum disposable tray worth of food! So I would say use the recipe its tasty but make your life easy and use these adjustments so that the pasta stays moist and delicious!

OH. MY. GAH. This was the best macaroni salad I've ever had. I made it to go with the pork chops we were grilling and it was so tasty. The only thing I did differently was cut back on the sugar. I used not even 1/3 of a cup. Everything else was the same though. MMMMM...definitely making it again!

I love this recipe. Its a GREAT basic one. I changed it a little, i halved the sugar (otherwise it would be too sweet), i used a yellow pepper instead of green to give it a milder flavor, and did not use the pimentos(over kill). Turned out fantastic! Great way to get the kids to eat Peppers, Carrots and Celery:o)

THIS Is ONE AWESOME SALAD!!!!  VERY rich in flavor! This recipe is a KEEPER!!!  I did add some fresh sweet basil tho.  If you like a toned down salad, this is not for you.  I have never been able to make a good macaroni salad.   I will use NO OTHER RECIPE, further searching is no longer needed.

Perfect recipe for a crowd.... ! I used splenda instead of sugar (and i didnt add the full amount of splenda either).. and save a little of the mayo mix to add just before serving.. it refreshes the salad if you made it earlier in the day for a party.. just toss the leftover mayo mix in just before you eat.. goes so well with bbq chicken!  My dinner party loved this one..!

I made this recipe “as is” and again with some changes mentioned by others. The amount of sugar called for in this recipe, made it simply inedible. And the prepared yellow mustard made it too tangy and not at all aesthetically pleasing. Unless you’re feeding Martians who may appreciate a neon-yellow salad, try using Grey Poupon Dijon Mustard instead of the prepared yellow mustard. The taste is much more sophisticated and blends much better.  I also added a bit of Paprika and an extra stalk of celery.   With the changes, this is an excellent recipe.

This salad was a huge hit at the BBQ. I just cut the sauce recipe in half for a lighter, more refreshing sauce and it still came out great. Highly recommended!!

I make this salad all the time.  I reduce the sugar to 1/3 cup and add a couple teaspoons.  Everyone asks for the recipe cause it's so good.  This salad is definitely a hit at any meal!

Very good!  I used the entire pkg. of pasta (17 oz).  Also instead of using a green pepper, I used yellow, red and orange for color and also a purple onion. Beautiful dish and tastes great!

I liked the creaminess of the salad but found it much too sweet.  Next time I'll cut back on the sugar and make it ahead of time - it's better the 2nd day.

I am not a fan of mac salad, but this is soooo good! My family loves it and they get so excited when we have it. One thing I do make sure of is that the noodles are really dry before I put the dressing on. Otherwise it can get a little soupy.

this was good, my first time making macaroni salad and everyone really liked it!  The only changes I made were to add a little less than 1/4 cup sugar, and I didn't feel like grating the mini carrots I had on hand so I left them out completely and I also left out the pimentos.  I used kraft light mayo, next time I will add dill pickle chunks and some hard boiled eggs.  Thanks for sharing!

Tastes a whole lot like the Yoder's Macaroni Salad that my husband loves.... a little less creamy, but I used high fiber pasta and lowfat mayo, so it's so much healthier - I'll sacrifice a little creaminess for that savings!

This is an excellent recipe!  I doubled the amount of macaroni for a party but backed off on doubling everything else except for the mayo for fear it would be too sweet or too spicey.  It worked out perfectly leaving the other ingredients as is for the 4 C. macaroni recipe.

Classic is a great name for this salad. I used the ingredients that I had on hand, so I omitted peppers and celery.  I dont believe I used the full 2/3 cup sugar, but use your judgement.   Not too mayo tasting.

I grew up in New York, and practically lived on deli macaroni salad.  Since moving a few years ago, I've tried numerous macaroni salad recipes and have been consistently disappointed.  This is the closest thing to deli style macaroni salad I've found yet - it's a hit with the whole family!  To everyone saying it's too sweet - you have to let it sit for the recommended time.  Even after 2 hours the sweetness settles down.  It seemed soooooo sweet and a bit runny at first, but after letting it set in the fridge for a couple of hours, I can't keep my mom from sneaking in 'just to try it'!

I have made this macaroni salad now 3 times. While I feared, when first making it, that it may be too sweet, I elected to make it exactly as the recipe called for, except for adding 2 or 3 boiled eggs and a bit of sweet pickle relish. I also sprinkle the top of the finished salad with hungarian paprika. (It makes a lovely presentation that way.) Surprisingly, my family loved the salad and everyone who ate it loved it. No one found it too sweet at all. I have abandoned my old macaroni salad recipe in lieu of this one which my family and guests love. I would recommend it.

Aside from using Kraft Fat Free Mayo and leaving out the pimentos I made it exactly as directed and waited nearly a full day before trying it.  The consistency I thought was good as were a lot of the flavors but, like many reviewers, as is it was too sweet for my taste.  Next time I'll cut the sugar in half and/or use a spicier mustard (I used honey mustard)

Excellent, old fashioned mac salad!  Like some others I cut the sugar back quite a bit but the proportions of dressing to macaroni (and I added quite a few more, finely chopped, veggies) were perfect.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this again today and it tastes wonderful.  I did not have the fresh green pepper; although, I do in the freezer but I was only making a half recipe for myself as my husband does not like macaroni salad and it is just the two of us.  I used hot dog relish instead of yellow mustard as I am out of that as well.  Other than that, I did the same as the recipe instructs with the exception of something I always do with pastas.  If you reserve just a little of the starchy cooking water from the macaroni and add it to the sauce and macaroni it will help to "marry" the sauce to the pasta and makes the texture so much  more like a salad.  Not everyone my prefer this but I do this to all my pasta dishes.

I love this recipe with my changes.  I served this at a huge BBQ Fundraiser.  People were coming back again and again for more.    Here are my changes...I omitted the bell pepper, carrot, and pimentos.  I also changed the amounts of a few things to the following: 2 TB vinegar, 1/3 cup Sugar, 1 TB Yellow Mustard.  I also added 3 TB of Sweet Relish.  And it is a must for this to sit overnight. Great basic recipe!

This was really tasty!  I omitted the pimento peppers and used red onion to give it some color.  The onion was really potent, so I only used half and that was more than enough.  Next time I will make a little extra dressing because the salad was a little dry the next day.

Love the recipe, made some tweaks that were delicious:  See new recipe here...  2 1/2 cups uncooked tiny shells macaroni 2 1/2 cups radiatore pasta 1/2 cup cup mayonnaise 3/4 cup sour cream 1/4 cup distilled white vinegar 2/3 cup white sugar 2 1/2 tablespoons prepared yellow mustard 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 1/3 teaspoon ground black pepper 1/2 large onion, chopped 2 stalks celery, chopped 1/2 green bell pepper, seeded and chopped 2 cups frozen peas 1/2 dozen baby carrots chopped  This variation was fantastic, and I serve it regularly as a potluck dish at my church.

This is very good and great for sharing with friends and family.  I'm glad I cut back the sugar to 1/2 because it is sweet.  I also will cut back a bit on the onion next time as a personal preference.  Thank you.

The only macaroni salad I knew how to make was mayo, pepper, macaroni and tuna fish.  Love the internet.  I made this and it's delicious. I used only 1/4 cup sugar.  And 2nd time used half on onion.  Still too oniony for me...but...now that I have the basics on making a great salad, I will tweek each time I make it.  Oh, I added a can of kidney beans.  GREAT recipe.  QUESTION??? ARE THERE FRESH PIMENTO PEPPERS OUT THERE?? OR ONLY PIMENTO PEPPERS IN A JAR????

Really really good. I didn't have green peppers only had red so I used some of them and used green onions instead of regular onions to make up for the color contrast. I will make this one again its really super tasty!!

I followed reviewers advice and used mayo and a lot less sugar.  It turned out great.  I have made this a few times and it is always gobbled up.

Very easy to make and seems to taste better each following day. I made this for a housewarming party and it was a big hit. Cut the sugar by a third & added chopped red and yellow bell peppers. Fantastic! Not too sweet or sour. Will try it next time adding peas & possibly chopped ham.

The dressing is great. I followed the recipe exactly, but added a little more peppers and grated carrots. The carrots were a nice addition to giving it some vibrant color. This will be my macaroni salad recipe for many bbq's to come.

This is the best macaroni salad I've ever had!  Made it for a neighborhood picnic, and everyone said it was great!  I actually cooked a whole box of pasta, and doubled the dressing.  LOVE the addition of the yellow mustard for that great color.  I sprinkle the top with paprika, just because.  Thanks so much for this keeper!

It's a big recipe! I made this for a potluck party and everyone liked it. Many people had seconds. I made the sauce and cooked the noodles the night before and put everything together the next morning to serve it in the evening. That seemed to work well. I garnished with some celery leaves.

So yummy! I made a few very minor changes: I used 1lb (uncooked) of bow tie pasta, 1/4 cup sugar only, Grey Poupon Dijon mustard, and red onion. Everything else stayed the same. It was DELICIOUS! It definitely needs to be refrigerated for at least a few hours. It allows all the flavors to come together and absorb into the pasta. I made it for a BBQ party and received many praises. Thank you for this wonderful recipe!!

I made this recipe exactly how it states but added egg, had it at my party on sat, and the only one who ate some was my hubby, and he told me it was good, I think he was only saying it to make me feel good since the whole bowl was left there totally full, I dont like macaroni salad, so I couldnt try it, dont take my rating to heart, this got totally good ratings so maybe the people I had over, just didnt like macaroni salad, cause the potato sald I had here had mostly the same ingriedients, but potatoes instead of macaroni, so maybe that was it :)

Never made this type of salad before.   I have 30 people today for a bridal shower. Someone gave me a recipe and luckily I tasted it after 3 hours.  It was horrible.  Online I found this recipe and doctored mine up.  This saved the day.  It tastes great.  Thank you.

This is not what I expected when I saw classic Macaroni Salad. It actually tastes like honey mustard dressing, very sweet and lots of mustard. However, I decided to make it work and added finely chopped onion, green peppers, pepperoni, kidney beans, hard boiled eggs, and carrots. That made it really good! Not at all what I wanted but turned out to be great.

Basic ingredients, however, it was too sweet for me and I did not like the prepared mustard.  I used coleman's dry and added a little more liquid.  I also substituted 1/2 half greek yoghurt for 1/2 of the mayo to cut down on the fat.

I used this recipe the very first time I made macaroni salad. I always preferred my Mom's and never made it.  But now that she is gone -  I wanted to make some.  My family loved this. the only thing I did different was substitute white wine vinegar (because that was what I had) and I used celery flakes, because I can't use celery before it goes bad. Thanks for a new family favorite!

I thought it was very good. It wasn't too sweet for me. I added red and green bell peppers for color. I did not add carrots. Next time maybe I'll add a little jalapeño for some kick.

The first time I made this macaroni salad it was unbelievable!!!  The second time I used low fat mayo and it was way too sweet.  So...regular mayo, cut back to 1/4 cup sugar and it is perfect!!

I made this recipe for a party.  It was the first time I have ever made macaroni salad.  There was 15 people at the party, and at the end of the night, no salad left, with lots of people asking me for the recipe!!  I left out the onion, and pimento.  I used whole wheat pasta, and low fat miracle whip instead of mayo, and this recipe turned out amazing, and has made it to my recipe book.

Delicious variation of classic macaroni salad.  The mustard gives it a great tangy taste.  I did not add green pepper or pimento and it still came out great.  Next time, I would reduce the sugar slightly.

We used this recipe for a graduation party and it was well recieved- guests were surprised that we would make our own and not buy it premade? They were surprised at how fresh and tasty it was. Lots of compliments. We made it pretty much as stated in recipe.

This recipe is very good, but I did reduce the amount of sugar, added some relish and paprika. I think next time I will omit the vinegar. Overall it was very good and recieved lots of compliments.

really good, but the raw onions took over and that's really all you taste.  Next time I would either cook them a bit first, use dehydrated minced onions or just omit them all together.

Loved this recipe.  Cut the sugar in half after reading other reviews and added cucumbers.  I did think that is was mustardy, but I didn't mind it.  Different, but good.

This is outstanding, and I'm not a big fan of bell peppers.  But the flavors all meld together in this one, and it is a definite keeper.  I didn't change a thing, except I did not include the optional grated carrot and I used a sweet Vidalia onion. My brother went back for seconds before I could even get it into the refrigerator!  UPDATE:  I have now made this recipe more times than I can count, and it always gets rave reviews.  I now add the grated carrot.  Wonderful, wonderful!!

Simply just delicious and I will be making this again next weekend for our BBQ. My only gripe, and this is just personal, is that both my husband and I had a sour stomach from the raw onions. Next time, I'll just omit them or perhaps cook them up first. Very simple dish yet a big hit!

If you chop up ham, cheese, and add a can of corn and sliced black olives it's a meal. Oh try using dijon mustard and I use red wine vinegar

Made this for Memorial Day and absolutely loved it.  Used my own homemade mayonaise.  I do, however, think it could use a red or yellow pepper added to it.

Great Recipe!!! I made a few changes to this recipe. I used reduced fat mayo(I hate miracle whip), reduced the amount of sugar to 1/4 cup, added 2 tbsps of pickle relish and a couple dashes of paprika. I made this the night before I served it. I got rave reviews about this recipe. Even my husband that hates mustard and refuses to eat anything with mustard gobbled this up. I will make this again and again.

I made this recipe for a holiday BBQ and it was a big hit.  Just like the recipe says "pleasing taste that seems to suit everyone".  It is easy to make and isn't overly heavy with sauce like most store bought kinds.  I recommend letting it sit in the fridge over night to give the flavors a chance to really meld together.  Would recommend to friends and I do plan to make it again.

So, I'm only giving this four stars because I loved it but neither of my kids did (4 & 1.5) and they are really good eaters, so I was a bit surprised.  I did find it too sweet for my taste, and I only added half the sugar -- I think next time I'll only add 1.5tbsp and see how that is.  I also used balsamic vinegar and dijon mustard -- and 5 spring onions rather than 1 cooking onion.  I really liked it and will be making it again for sure!

I would suggest cutting down on the onion and bell pepper. It was way too strong; however, it was still really good. I followed the recipe exactly and I would really suggest making adjustments.

This was wonderful.  I only used 1/3 cup sugar and added frozen peas and chopped pimento olives.

My husband made this because he loves macaroni salad.  I was so pleasantly surprised at how delicious it was!  He changed the recipe a bit by adding red peppers in lieu of celery.  I have to say that I loved it and I know our friends and family will ask for it at our summer barbeques!!

Pretty good. I cut the sugar in half, cut the mayo a bit too, and added a good shake of garlic powder. A good, basic pasta salad.

I used apple cider vinegar and frozen peas for the veggies (no onion, bell pepper, or celery). I used about three cups of mini star, standard size elbow, and tomato/spinach twist pasta. Everyone loved it from the two year old to the grandparents!

This is very similar to my recipe of my grandmothers.  The only difference is I add either a can of drained white tuna or white chicken. Huge hit for anyday!

Delicious! Was a smash hit at my bbq a few weeks back, I thought that it called for too many onions so I didn't put the full amount but I think that was a bad call it definitely needed more.  It only had time to chill for about 3 hours but was still DELICIOUS!

Excellent Recipe.  I didn't change a thing and it was 5 stars.  I did include all the veggies and options, like the pimentos.  The kids and I both really enjoyed it and I will make it again.  I now have a "go to" recipe for Macaroni Salad.  I will try some variations in the future to see how they turn out.  While eating it I was thinking it would be good with some hard cooked egg in it and maybe some small cheese cubes.

I made this recipe twice. It is delicious! The first time I cut the sugar and vinegar in half. The second time I followed the exact recipe and didn't think it was to sweet. It was great both ways. My husband loves this macaroni salad. I will be making this salad again. Thank You!

Overall, very tasty but way too sweet. I used only 1/4 c. of sugar and it was still too sweet. The overall flavor and texture was quite good especially when I added some cubes of cheddar cheese and a bit of celery seeds.I also used cider vinegar vs. white.  I will make it again, just with less sugar.

This is a great recipe.  I didn't add the bell pepper or any of the optional ingredients.  I did however, add some Old Bay Seasoning and 3 hard boiled eggs.  This is also a great recipe for potato salad.

I thought this was just ok.  I halved the sugar amount because I thought it would be too sweet, and frankly I thought it was still overly sweet with half the sugar that the recipe calls for.  I also thought that it wasn't enough sauce for the amount of pasta it calls for, it turned out on the dry side.

When I make this I'm often asked "what store did you buy this from?"  This is the only recipe I've used for macaroni salad for about 1.5 years now.  Everyone just RAVES over it!! I don't put the peppers or carrots in it but I do add 3 to 4 hard boiled eggs.  It's also great when made with small shell noodles!

I love this macaroni salad... I am 8 months pregnant and this recipe has been the food i've craved and lived on! before i was pregnant i hated macaroni salad i couldnt even stand to look at it... then i found this very simple recipe and absolutly fell in love! this is better the next day. But if you need it in a hurry i throw mine in the freezer for a little bit, it seems to give it that next day taste a lot sooner.

I love this take on Mac Salad. I put in about a quarter of the onion, leave out the peppers and carrots and substitute chopped green olives for the pimento peppers. Fantastic.

I'm amazed no one mentioned the onion being too much.  I followed the recipe pretty closely, added one whole chopped red onion and it tasted like I added jalapeno peppers to it.  Had to rinse it out in a colander, pick out the macaroni & redo.  Salad was great, but 1 whole chopped onion was waaay too hot.

Yummy! I Followed as is..then remade with a few of my additions...this is a YUMMY recipe as is..but I only gave it 4 stars because you can do so much more with it.  Add eggs, more carrots, more onions..little bit more mayo and mustard...delish! Oh the second time I made it..I used lowfat Mayo..I felt much better eating it a bowl at a time! :)

This was really different from other macaroni salads that I have made.  I found it a little on the sweet side.  I will cut down on the sugar the next time I make it.  Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent.  I made the sauce exactly as the recipe states.  Added a few heaping spoonfuls of sweet relish, added a lb box of macaroni and celery.  I used a few spoonfuls of dried onion flakes also and added it to the sauce in the bowl while I waited for the macaroni to heat up.

Great salad. I did as most reviewers said and decreased the sugar to 1/3 cup and used apple cider vinegar. I added 8 boiled eggs, two tins of corn, a red and yellow sweet pepper and shredded cheddar cheese. I added more mayonnaise to suit my taste. I put half of the dressing and made it soak over night. I did not have to add the rest of the dressing. Everyone enjoyed it. I just had a bowl after being in the fridge for almost 2 days and its even better now. Thanks for this recipe.

This made a huge batch, but it was eaten quickly. As with other salad recipes, I added a few tablespoons of miracle whip to add a little zing and offset the 'heaviness' of the regular mayo. I also needed to add a touch more vinegar and mustard at the end. You can cut the pepper back by about 1/2 though.

LOVED IT! I added three hard boiled eggs and crabmeat. I was skeptical about the dressing, but it tastes great! Since I wanted some meat in there, I added some crabmeat as well.

Excellent! Definetly needs to sit in the fridge for the hours recommended. I added half a red pepper (gives a nice colour) and used half Miracle Whip half Hellman's for the mayo.

I wasn't that thrilled after I pulled it all together -- it is the classic kind of flavor for mac salad.  But the kids LOVED it!  Who knew?  They are a picky bunch, too!

I did add the grated carrot, but not the pimentos. Otherwise made exactly as written. The taste was very good, but the longer the salad sat, the drier it got. I like a creamier macaroni salad, so next time I would either cut the macaroni in half, or double the sauce. Other than that, though was just fine as written.

This is very similar to a recipe that has been in my family for generations.  As a previous reviewer has done, we also use apple cider vinegar and less sugar.  We tend to use frozen or fresh veggies over canned.    The key to this recipe is to allow it to 'set' - sometimes overnight!  Once the vinegar has a chance to thoroughly permeate all of the ingredients, you end up with a mouthwatering treat.  Additions - Cheese, cubed lunchmeats, any veggie you have on hand!  The more variety of texture you have, the better this is going to be.

I'm rating this based on the original recipe, which I followed exactly. If you have to modify it a lot, it's not really accurate if you give it many stars then. I thought it was too sweet tasting for me. Perhaps it was all the sugar or the white vinegar, but it had an odd taste. It changed it from tasting homemade to something you may get from the grocery store deli. I won't be making this again.

Okay, I was not crazy about this recipe ... I like my macaroni salad to be more on the tangy side ... dill pickles and mustard, that kind of thing ... but, my other half absolutely LOVED this recipe ... I followed it exactly ... I thought it was too sweet, but I would ... LOL ... he, on the other hand, thought it was the best macaroni salad he'd ever eaten ... so, that's why I am giving it 5 stars, for him and his sweet tastebuds ... if you like your macaroni salad sweet, you will probably like this ... if not, don't even try it ... thanks!

This was pretty good, I used 1/4C. sugar and it was plenty sweet, I cant see using any more than that.Did not use pimentos, didnt have any. I like that it wasnt just mayonaise,It always seems so greasy to me when using mayo only. The dressing was soaked up into the macaroni,but I liked it a little dryer, and it still had some moistness in it. Also I used celery seed, I just had to in macaroni salad.

With exception to cutting the recipe in half and omitting the peppers, I followed this recipe to a T. OMG, this was the biggest bowl of macaroni salad I have ever seen. That's ok. It was so tasty, it won't sit in my fridge. Thanks for the recipe!

This salad is exactly what I was looking for.  I needed it for a cookout and it was perfect.  The only change that I made was to use apple cider vinegar since that is all I had.  I used a sweet onion and a couple of shredded baby carrots.  Since everyone had said that the salad really needed to sit overnight but also that it dried out some overnight, I made the dressing the night before and just added the pasta a few hours before the dinner.  That said, that was a few days ago, and I still don't think that the salad is dry.  We're still enjoying it. (It does make a lot!!)

This is a pretty good, slightly sweet tasting macaroni salad. My bf (who dislikes creamy pasta salads) liked it, so I guess it's a winner at our house : ) Made a half batch to take to a friend's cookout/football party this weekend. My friends also seemed to like this (which is also a plus, since the last time we got together I made a Ranch potato salad that no one, including me, liked!). I like the texture (i.e. non-creaminess), but, when I think of macaroni salad, I really expect something less "runny". If you are looking for a creamy salad, you may be disappointed. All in all, though, I liked this a lot and would make it again in the future. I did change a couple of things in order to suit my/our tastes (without my changes, I probably wouldn't have liked this as much...). Instead of green pepper, I added a comprable amount of cubed mild cheddar cheese, added some frozen peas and subbed a couple handfulls of shredded carrots (from an 8 oz. package) for the grated carrots called for. Thanks for sharing!

This is the best.  I added a little more mayo, used apple cider vinegar instead of distilled and added 4 chopped eggs to the salad.  Definitely use the pimentos and shredded carrot, not only does it add extra flavor but it makes it look great too.

I have been looking for a macaroni salad recipe like this and I was not disappointed.  This salad was great!  I read the reviews before I started, so I decreased the amount of sugar.  I made 1/2 a recipe and used about 1/4 cup of sugar.  I also used a little less mustard.  I used the veggies I had on hand, celery, yellow bell pepper, and I threw in some fresh chives and parsley from the garden.  I didn't use onions, so I added a little onion powder to the dressing since the chives were very mild.  It gets better as it sits, but the 2nd day it was a little dry for my taste so I made some more dressing, and it was perfect.  Next time I will double the dressing.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

I made this for a friends cookout and it was a hit.  The mustard adds something intersting to the recipe.  It whipped up in no time at all.  Due to some dietary restrictions I did not add some of the ingredietns (peppers, etc) and threw in some of my own.  It was even better a few days later!

I loved this recipe.  Best dressing I have had on macaroni salad.  Will make this plenty of times over.  I like a lot of others only 1/4 cup of sugar and it was delicious.  Red bell peppers added some nice flavor too instead of the green

Way too sweet! (And I usually have quite a sweet tooth.)  Very easy though.  I added cubed ham.  Next time I'll use sweet relish instead of the suggested sugar.

This was great! I was looking for a traditional macaroni salad recipe and was very pleased with the results of this. I did add a little extra mayo and left out the celery. Everyone raved over it!

I made this for a summer dinner party. It called for too much sugar imo. I added in more vinegar and salt after to balance it out. I also added in much less mayo the called for. I added in some green onion and red pepper in addition to veggies called for.

This is a good, easy recipe. I've made it several times over the summer, tweaking it a little differently each time. I've cut the sugar down to 1/4 C., and find that rice wine vinegar gives it an interesting tang - not overpowering, just enough to let you know it's there. Our local Trader Joe's sells canned roasted red peppers & they really give the dish some color and flavor as well.

very yummy! I put half the amount if sugar that it called for though. And I cut the onions so small that even non-onion eaters wouldn't notice them.

This is the best macaroni salad I've ever made or eaten! I have spent a ton of money on crappy store-purchased, tasteless salads for as long as I remember. Yesterday we organized a barbecue for today, and I was determined not to let another awful salad ruin it. I made the salad last night. It was delicious. My family raved about it. I thought it was the end-all/be-all, and my neighbor and her guests loved it. (It made so much, I was able to share with my neighbor who was also entertaining family and friends.) How nice was that? This is the best macaroni salad recipe I have ever found. I will be sure to keep it and make it forever. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you for sharing it!

Excellent base for macaroni salad.
You can add many different ingredients depending on your personal taste. I like to add hard boiled eggs, olives, and cucumbers. You may also add shredded chicken, cheese, or radishes. The options are endless!

Cut back on the sugar a little or try honey. Everyone should try this as a summer standby as we usually have all of the ingredients around.

This is a great classic mac salad. I also reduced the sugar significantly (3/4 c) and vinegar (5 tbsp) and it came out fine. A light sweetness and tang. I added diced red pepper, celery and a little carrot. Simple, easy to make.

This was pretty good although it was a bit on the sweet side. Next time I will decrease the amount of sugar.  I didn't have celery so I omitted it. I think with the crunch from the celery it would have added to the texture.  I halfed the recipe and added 3 hard boiled eggs. It was a great addition! Overall good recipe. I will use it again but decrease the sugar a bit and maybe add some relish.  Thanks!

Everyone seemed to like this, I personally didn't care for it.  I did use half the sugar as others suggested and would use it all next time to see if I would like it more.  Wasn't sweet or creamy enough for me.

Taste just like the deli's macaroni salad.  Minor change: I just added half the sugar and it was plenty sweet. The other half would of made it way too sweet for my taste. Delicious for a bbq side or to take to a potluck.  It makes a ton.

Best every mac salad. I think it serves more than 10 though. Sometimes I make this with low fat mayo with balsamic vinegar and  artificial sweetner. Definitely Sweet onion. A real keeper. Thanks.

Delicious, the only change I made was that I used apple cider vinegar.  In the future I will make approximately 1/2 of the dressing more as I felt that it was ever so slightly dry (possible a personal preference)  Thanks for the recipe, it is a keeper.

Just made this tonight with some cheeseburgers and potato salad. Everyone loved it. It does have a sweet taste to it but its good. I'm not fond of celery and peppers but ate them without any dislike. I made it without the pimento peppers and did add some cubed sharp cheddar cheese. Good!

This is the best EVER macaroni salad. I don't usually make this, because I don't like mayo-based salads, buy boy am I glad I tried this one! I hosted a family BBQ and this was a HUGE hit with everyone. I love, love, love the sweet and crunchy taste of this salad. Made changes, as follows: decreased mayo to 2/3 c., vinegar to 1/8 c., 1/2 c. sugar, 1/2 Tbsp mustard (don't like mustard), added 1/4 tsp. celery seed and paprika, diced 1/2 red onion and celery, used frozen (thawed) peppers (grn, yellow & red) which I diced, and omitted the pimento. I let it sit in the fridge for about 4 hours before serving. This was even better as leftovers with some diced ham added in for lunch, the next day. YUMMY! I will be making this again and again.

I loved this salad, and my husband and coworkers agreed.  I made it the night before (for dinner the next day).  In the morning, the noodles looked a littled dry so I just added a couple more table spoons of mayo.  It was really flavorful, creamy and delicious by the time we ate it for dinner.  I'm going to add cubed cheddar cheese to the leftovers tonight.

Great and versatile recipe!  Based on some other reviewers' suggestions, I also cut the sugar down to 1/3 cup.  I also omitted the onion because no one here enjoys them in salads.  I used sweet, red bell pepper in place of the green, omitted celery and carrots and added cooked, seasoned chicken breast meat to make this the main dish.  Thank you for this recipe; we all enjoyed it very much.

I got lots of compliments on this when I served at a birthday party today.  A different dressing on a classic salad.  Warning...it makes a ton...I think it's a lot more than ten servings or we don't eat as much as everyone else, which I doubt is the case :)

this was pretty good. i had some extra shell pasta that i had already cooked a day or two before and had sitting in the fridge...so made the sauce for this and mixed it up. the color was a little yellow at first but after it sat for 5 hrs it toned down, and the flavor was pretty good. i think its a little too sweet though, next time will use less sugar. thanks!

Excellent.  I did cut back on the sugar and still thought it was delicious.  A great addition to this would be small chunks of ham and cheddar cheese.

I just made this for July 4th, first time ever making macaroni salad, and everyone really liked it. I did make changes (personal taste), I used the mayo that is made with olive oil (lower fat)and added eggs, pickles, carrots, grated cheese and made the sauce the night before then added it right before we ate it so it would be creamier, hubby said he would even of like more sauce on it. I did not add all the sugar, just didn't seem right, or the peppers or celery, I forgot to buy pimentos, or I would have added them. This is a great recipe to make your own, the sauce is great, then just add your ingredients to your own taste.

I added hard boiled egg to this recipe and reduced the amount of onion.  Even with half an onion I felt there was too much onion.  I used only half the sugar after reading others' comments.  I also left out the celery (because I didn't have any), and it turned out fine.  I was worried the day I made it because I sampled a bite and was displeased with the sugary taste.  After the dressing set overnight, however, it tasted great.

I followed the recipe exactly and I really pleased.  My family usually buys the pre packaged container of this side from the local grocer.  This blew their socks off.  Try it for your next summer picnic.

This is a very good recipe for tasty macaroni salad. Choose your onion carefully. I had Spanish (yellow) onion on hand and thought one large would be a lot. I used a medium and was glad I sampled before chilling. The onion was over-powering and would have completely taken over the flavors. I ended up digging out a lot of onion - about half and it was very good but still had an onion aftertaste the next day. A large mild onion like Vidalia or Walla Walla would be good. Scallions may be nice with this recipe. I skipped the carrot but included the pimento. A really good dish.

This is the macaroni salad that I've been looking for... just like grandma's!  It did need a little more dressing though- about 1/2 of the recipe more.  Other than that it was perfect!  Thank you for posting! :)

I have to say this is and 'okay' recipe for macaroni salad.  I followed other's recommendations and cut the sugar in half, but it was still a bit too sweet.  It was also very 'tangy' which tasted out of place in this salad.  I made it in the amount the recipe suggested and my guests barely touched it.  I'm not sure I'll make this one again.

Great sweet and sour type macaroni salad.  I cut back on the sugar to 1/3 cup and used cider vinegar and dijon mustard.  I think this would be great with cut-up hard boiled eggs.

I followed this recipe exactly, it makes a lot, if you want it for a large gathering. Everyone liked it, a little sweet for my taste, but it was a hit. I may try it again with less sugar and a little more mayo and see if turns out creamier. The assortment of veggies in it is fabulous.  Overall a good one!

I use dill pickle juice instead of vinegar. If you want it a little sweeter, use bread and butter pickle juice and omit the sugar altogether.  Sometimes I'll even mix in some sweet relish.  But I've used this basic recipe for years and people love it.

I made this following the recipe and tossed in some tiny canned shrimp for good measure.  It was very good, but a little sweet for my taste.  I think next time I'd use half or quarter of the amount of sugar.

I didn't use the celery, carrots, or pimentos. Instead I used red pepper and another green. I loved the difference the sugar made. I got many great reviews from my co-workers.

This was good, but a little on the dry side. I took advice from other reviewers, and did not put as much sugar in it. I will double the sauce with less sugar to take care of dryness next time.

This is very good. I've modified it by using 1 tbs. less mustard, about 1/5 cup of vinegar, only 1/2 cup of sugar, and lighten it a bit by adding a mix of mayo and plain yogurt. Excellent! But this recipe is a great classic base.

Very good, basic recipe. I made dressing as is, but would definitely use a little less sugar next time. I added some quartered cherry tomatoes, and their acidity helped some with the sweetness.

This tastes just like my moms, I will back off by maybe a teaspoon or two of sugar, but it was absolutely wonderful. I just really made the sauce from this recipe, but added green pepper, fried bacon, and quartered cherry tomatoes into the pasta, it was really good, my mom said she liked it better than her own. Thanks for the recipe!

Made this last night! Easy to make. My 3-year-old niece "helped" me with mixing the dressing and putting the vegetables into the bowl. Definitely would make it again. It's a nice change from "regular" macaroni salad.

Omitted the sugar. Used red pepper and added grape tomatoes (halved) and cheddar cheese. Yummy!

I made this to take to a church picnic...to rave reviews!  Instead of white vinegar, I used white wine vinegar.  It's the best I've made.  The other reviewers thoughts were very helpful, too.  Thanks!!

This was an excellent salad - personally I didn't notice the extra sweetness others are commenting on.  Overall, it sort of had a deviled egg appeal with the added mustard which I really liked.  Like most of you, I added my own personal twist.  I wanted that extra toothiness so cut two chicken breasts into strips, cooked them and  let them cool to room temp.  Once completely cool I shredded them into the finished salad and incorporated fully. Additionally,  I also substituted the green pepper with a red pepper to give that visual pop since I left out the pimentos.  Enjoy!

Well, I wish I had read ALL of the reviews before making this.  I have never made a macaroni salad before so I didn't think twice about adding the sugar.  For us it was just too sweet. Chilling the salad does take some of the sweetness away but not enough. Not the taste we were looking for.  It was more like eating a "honey mustard" macaroni salad rather than a "classic".  When I was mixing the dressing I couldn't help thinking the sauce would have been better on chicken than using it in a salad.  Would maybe make this again but definately NO sugar.

This was great! I subbed cider vinegar for white. I left out the sugar altogether, but, I did use a couple tablepoons of sweet relish. I also left out the green pepper as it gives my hubby wicked heartburn. Thanks for this recipe, it was my first try at mac salad and I'll go back to it again and again!

I added less than half of the sugar which was recommended and it turned out great. If i had added all of the sugar to the dressing it would of been WAY to sweet. I cant even imagine...

Later i also mixed in some cubed cheesy bratwurst, cracked mixed pepercorns, finely chopped cauliflower and a handfull of cheddar cheese. I topped it off with a couple tablespoons chopped hot peppers. It was very good :)

The vinegar and mustard were too much for us. It is a nice way to sneak in a few veggies (and use leftovers from the fridge).

Overall, I really liked this recipe. I didn't add the sugar which I think would've as other people noted too "sweet but with that said, the mustard seemed to overpower the salad, so I added a little bit more salt, pepper and mayo.

Yummy, this is a great recipe. I used ¼ cup sugar and spicy honey dijon mustard, I will probably use less sugar next time because it is still sweet but DELIOUCOUS.

I got so many compliments on this easy, quick recipe. Next time, I won't add onions  - they didn't seem to 'mesh' flavor-wise with the other ingredients. Also, this dish is definitely better the day after. I would suggest, as other readers have, refrigerating it overnight. :)

I made this using leftover salad, rotini, and shell pasta from my pantry. I also added some red cabbage, and omitted the carrots, and used red wine vinigar instead of white.  It came out great.  Next time I make it I will cut back on the sugar just a little.  This one is definately a keeper.

Very good. I'm glad I read the reviews first. As a result I used less sugar, only about 1/4 cup, and that was plenty. The only other change I made was to use stone ground dijon mustard in place of yellow mustard.

i found this recipe really helpful! this was the first time i ever attempted to make macaroni salad, and it was a hit. i did improvise a bit though. 

- instead of using 1/4 cup vinegar, i only used 1/8.
- instead of using 2/3 cup sugar, i only used 1/8.
- i used guldens spicy hot mustard instead of the prepared yellow mustard.
- instead of adding celery, bell pepper and carrot, i added cucumber and chunks of ham.
- i didnt have any pimento peppers, so i took that out too. 

overall, i love the way my macaroni salad came out. the only downfall was, it was a bit watery. this recipe definitely isnt what youre looking for if you want a thick and creamy macaroni salad. 

i will definitely be making this again. 

by the way, i used rotini instead of elbow macaroni, and it worked just fine! :)

Mmmm-good!  My favorite macaroni salad on this site is Kim's Macaroni Salad but I wanted something different.  This is great - similar to Kim's but more veggies.  I too cut way back on the sugar - one tablespoon - and had to use three jalapeno peppers in place of green (the jalapeno's are in Kim's!)  Thanks submitter.

I've made this recipe a couple of times now, but I just add about 2 tsp sugar. I julienne the carrots and it gives it a nice touch and color. It's a classic.

Will DEFINITELY make this again, but with no sugar.  I halved the amount of sugar and still found it too sweet. It's a GREAT recipe and we all have different tastebuds.  Adding the sugar gradually while tasting is my suggestion.

This was the first time I had ever made a macaroni salad. I had to make it for a company picnic and I have to say that everyone just loved it. All my co-workers wanted to recipe...and one of them even thought about it they had it for a late breakfast snack and for lunch! 
I did modify the recipe slightly...using only 1/8 of sugar, 1/4 tablespoon of salt, a bit more mayo, and a tiny extra kick of pepper. 
This is a great recipe that overall had people saying that it was the best macaroni salad they ever had.

Yummy! This is one of those things you crave for. I only put in 2 tablespoons of sugar and a half onion and it turned out excellent.

I was looking for a new recipe for a macaroni salad.  This was a hit!!  I didn't add the pimento peppers and used green onions instead of a regular onion.

It's not bad, it just doesn't taste like much of anything except sweet mayo and macaroni.  By all means reduce the sugar because if you don't the sugar will be all that you taste and for me that was way too much.

Fabulous!  The only substitutions I made were using rotini instead of elbows (a 1 lb. box), Splenda instead of sugar and rediced fat mayo.  I took it to a Labor Day picnic and everyone loved it.  I will definitely make this again!

I made this just last week and ate most of it myself. I did make some changes to the recipie. I only added about a half cup each of onion and green bell peppers and I also threw in about a 1/4 cup of dill relish. I did put in about 1/2 cup of sugar which balanced out the flavor. I loved it. Will make again.

We used this recipe for our company picnic this year. It's pretty good, but we made some adjustments. We didn't use the pimentos, and added olives. We used red pepper instead of green. Next time I make this, I will cut the sugar down, because it is a little too sweet for my taste.

The first time I made this, 2/3 c sugar seemed like an awful lot, so I used only 1/2. It was still way too much,  sickeningly sweet. The next time I used only 1/3 c. Much better. I figured that maybe the 2/3 c in the recipe was a typo. But now I use only 1/4 cup, if any. I also reduced the vinegar to 1/8 cup. It was a hit on 4th  of July. Even picky grandson liked it.

This was a good recipe. I did find it a little dry so I doubled the mayo, sugar and vinegar. I also added some sweet relish. After the small changes, it reminded me a lot of my grandma's. YUMMY!

What a yummy salad recipe!  I liked that there were the flavors of the peppers and onion (I added 1/2 of an onion instead of the whole thing), yet the sauce is so sweet.  I did add the grated carrot which added a nice color.  Also, I prepared the salad using a 22 oz. bag of large shell pasta and that was just the right amount to get the pasta/sauce proportioned just right and it looked so appealing with the shells.

my kids absolutely love this salad. my son was helping me make it one day and he suggested that we put some hard boiled eggs in it. i use one egg for every cup of pasta. i also substiute italian salad dressing for the vinegar. it adds just enough extra flavor.

I made this for a church function, but my husband and I liked it so much we didn't take it.  The dressing is light and sweet, which is nice.  This will definitely become one of our summer favorites.

4 stars only because I think it didn't need as much sugar or vinegar as it called for. Maybe half as much as it calls for on both. Other than that and the addition of 4 hard boilded eggs, this recipe is SUPER delicious!! Thanks so much!!

This is an absolute staple in my home during those summer picnic days. I always get rave reviews. I do cut the sugar back a little bit because it's a little too sweet for me if I don't. Great recipe!!!

This was awesome. I did use less sugar however (about 1/4 cup) and added some boiled potatoes to give it a little more flavor as Im not a huge macaroni fan. I also did not use pimento. Other than that, I did everything as the recipe said. Terrific. Thanks.

I usually cannot stand macaroni salad. Ive always had it with just the elbow noodles, mayo, egg and celery. SO blech. But this was amazing!! My mom liked it aswell! 

I did take the suggestions of others and used less sugar, however.

This was ok but not my favorite.  The honey mustard taste is a little overpowering and there is a lot of sugar in it.  I will probably not make this again.

I made this with corn and it came out great. I only left out the peppers and celery. I think it's a good, versatile dressing.

This salad was very good. I should have read the reviews before I made it, but I felt that the sugar was too much so I did reduce it before hand. I doubled the recipe (all except the sugar and mustard and allowed it to sit overnight in the frig. I added boiled eggs and relish to mine. Thanks for the recipe.

I took this to a company picnic, most everybody said it was pretty good.  The macaroni sucked up a lot of the dressing mixture...so next time I'll chill them overnight in separate containers.  It was easy and good...I'll be making this again!!!!  Thanks!!

I used whole wheat noodles.  I also took one reviewers advice and kept my cooked noodles and my "dressing" in two separate containers overnight, so as not to have the noodles suck up too much moisture.  I thought it was pretty good, but not many people at the potluck I was at actually ate it.  Maybe the noodles scared them?  I'll do it with regular noodles next time and see if I get a different response.

This was a hit at my house for the 4th of July cookout.  Perfect mayo/mustard balance.  I didn't use the 'optional' items, but I'm sure they would have added great flavor.

This is a great recipe!  I deleted the carrots and kept everything else the same.  It really has a lot of great flavor the next day.  Took it to a work function and everyone loved it!  I made extra dressing the next day and added to it as it was pretty dry after sitting overnight.

YUM!!!!!!!!!!  This is some great stuff!  I used 1/3 cup of sugar and subbed dijon mustard, but followed the recipe otherwise.  What a delicious salad- I can't wait to take this to a party!  This is the flavor I love in a macaroni salad!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

The recipe does call for way too much sugar, and I started with  1/4 cup.  Will reduce probably by another Tbsp.  It's soupy after first making, but this recipe is absolutely best the next day, or a few hours, after the sauce thickens and gets absorbed.

Solid base recipe that allows for modifications depending on personal tastes. I added hard-boiled egg, chopped black olive, sweet puckle relish and a hint of parsley. I cut back the vinegar and sugar to half.

Being that I’m from the south I am used to macaroni salad being on the sweeter side. However, this was way too sweet for me. It’s a great salad. But if you do not like super sweet than I would suggest adding in only 1/4 Cup sugar and adding by taste if that’s not enough!  My first 1/2 batch was horribly sugary, so I made a second 1/2 batch with no sugar at all and mixed both batches together to balance out. I needed leftovers anyways. I also got a little carried away with grating the carrots so I just added the extras in.

2/3 cup of sugar sounded way sweet. So I followed advice of others and cut it in half. Cut the amount of onion by half. Omitted the carrots. Didn't have fresh pimentos but the jarred type was fine substitute and added plenty sweetness to make up for reduced sugar.  It tastes similar to, but better than,  the store bought stuff at a fraction of price. I like how it stays a little wet over time like store-bought.  Possibly because this recipe doesn't use milk. I guess the macaroni doesn't absorb vinegar?  After this,   I WILL NEVER USE SWEET PICKLE RELISH AGAIN like other recipes call for. No complaints from others either.  A keeper and will definitely make again.  Thanks.

I was worried it would be too sweet so I only used 1/4 cup of sugar. I also only used half of a red onion, which I cut into thin slivers and the en chopped so that a bite of onion wouldn’t overpower the flavours.

I made it again with just a little less than half a cup of sugar, still very much sweet but 2/3C sugar.... No. read other comments most say 2/3C sugar is too much. I followed the first time as recipe instructed, don’t be like me. Otherwise, when sugar is cut back it’s pretty good.

Always a hit, at home or parties. I put half of the sugar requested, and added 1/2 tsp of celery seeds. This is a keeper.

So sweet even on 1/3 cup of sugar.  Ruined the salad completely.  Had to throw out as it was the worse macaroni salad I've ever made due to the sugar. If you do by tablespoon ot may be ok.  I  would not make again.

Skipped the sugar entirely.  Used scallions instead of yellow onion.  Used green olives with pimentos.  Mixed avocado mayo and olive garden dressing, and only half the yellow mustard called for in this recipe. Added half cup of grated jack and cheddar cheese.

Made as recipe instructed. Way too oniony! Seemed like the kind you get at the grocery store prepackaged. I added more mayo, paprika, and dill to try to cut the onion flavor down a little.

I used brown instead of yellow mustard because that is what we like. I also didn't use carrots the first time I made it because I didn't have any. My daughter stated it was the best macaroni salad she has ever had and not to ever make another recipe. I made it a 2nd time with the carrots  and she said it wasn't as good. To me it just added a little extra texture and color , not too much extra flavor. But I like the idea of the extra veggies where you can. Great recipe, will make over and over again.

I cut back on sugar and it was still sweet enough. I used sweet pickle relish instead of dill but like the option of changing it up if I want something different. Next time may use dill and less sugar. Hubby loved it.

Made some minor changes to the dressing less salt more pepper used a pepper medley, used Splenda in stead of sugar, added a bit of a vadalia onion dressing to it and I used only a portion of a sweet yellow onion because we have sensitive eaters that dislike onion here....  this is a great taste overall and I suggest dicing the pepper and onion and celery as small as you can and I shredded the carrots instead of gratting them I should have grated

I had made Macaroni Salad before but never like this one. This is really good. Not too much mayonnaise and just the right of everything. I just finished making 4LB. And it only took me 30 minutes or less. Thank you for sharing this recipe. ????

This recipe is an excellent base. I add garlic powder, paprika and dill to the mix to add a punch of great flavour. I also change up the vegetables I put in it.  This salad always gets devoured quickly when I make it.

Just got done making this for the first time.. I cut the sugar in half (my husband needs to cut out sugars) used 1 tsp of Salt (for medical needs) but left the other spices as is..I didn't have a whole Green Bell pepper, so I used some Red Pepper too, shredded a medium carrot, onion & celery!  It's resting in the Fridge.. Will update later & let you know how husband liked it too!  So far, it looks luscious
UPDATE: My husband LOVED this & asked me to make it again!!  This time, I added the full amount of Sugar, since I thought it could be a bit sweeter... He'll never know tho!!!  It makes a lot, but keeps very well for several days.

This recipe has the flavor i was craving. Perfect! My grandchildren said they didnt like the vegetables in it but ate the macaroni. I was told it was a bit too runny but that just may be that it wasn't refrigerated long enough.

This is the recipe I’ve been trying to find for years! Delicious! Only change was to cut back on the sugar a bit. I doubled the recipe and used a whole box of elbows and I had enough for an army!

Color is needed. Next time  I will increase the green pepper or add some peas to increase the color and fiber in this salad.  The dressing is lovely.

I added a yellow and red pepper plus green pepper to it. Everything else stayed the same. I have made a lot of macaroni salads over the years, but this recipe was by far the best. Everyone raved over it. I love it too.

I have made this macaroni salad many, many times, and it is always a hit. The dressing is phenomenal, but I do cut  the sugar in half. I  find it just the right amount of sweetness to my taste. Since I love stuff in the salad, I also add more celery, carrots and peppers to the dish. I leave out the pimentos, and use black olives , and also cut up a whole block of cheddar cheese. The recipe is so versatile, you can doctor it in many ways!!!

I made it the day before and it was very dry the next morning. I think I will make extra sauce next time or cut down on the macaroni. Great flavor!

Loved the dressing.  Added a pinch of cayenne.  Used spicy brown mustard.  Used red and green pepper, green onions and celery.  Great recipe to adjust to what you have on hand.  Make extra dressing, the pasta soaks it up!

I made it very basic.  I just added onions, green pepper, eggs and celery.  I followed the mayo dressing and I prepared the pasta a head of time.  After letting it cool, just added a little of the mayo dressing the night before and the rest of it in the morning.  I added the eggs and green pepper the next day as well,  It is now my go to macaroni salad for home or to take to a party. Excellent.

I followed the recipe but did what another reviewer suggested and cooked the macaroni and mixed together all of the other ingredients the day before.  I didn't mix the macaroni with everything until the day I served it.  This was fantastic and definitely a hit with the family.

I made this a few, days ago and it was a hit! I put my own twist on it, as everyone has their own preferences. I didn't add the bell pepper, but I did add some diced up tomatoes and a can of drained tuna. It was very delicious!

Made recipe exactly as written.  Was concerned it might be to spicy as we had a guest that was not a fan of spicy foods but it was not, he even went back for seconds! I added the optional tbps of water and mayo before serving as well....not sure if it really made a difference. Great flavor !

This classic macaroni salad was the bomb. I will definitely make it again & again. I did add 3 boiled eggs & 1 tsp of crushed red peppers for a little kick & 1 tsp of garlic salt with dried parsley. I loved it and so did my roommates.

I made 1 1/2 times because it was a large gathering and it was too much.  I also left out the carrots and put in more green pepper along with red pepper and yellow pepper.  Made it colorful and delicious.

This was very delicious exactly as the recipe is written! It is also very versatile. I like to sub the white vinegar for apple cider vinegar, and usually leave out the onions. I also love to add chopped black olives and 3-5 chopped hard boiled eggs! It is best with the eggs!! Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this and it is wonderful! I only used 1/4th cup of sugar, did not add the carrots or pimentos. I added hard boiled eggs. The longer the flavors have to blend together just makes it so much more flavorful!!!

This is delicious!  My husband and I keep eating it and I would bring to any event. I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup based on many suggestions and that was perfect. I also used half a green pepper and half a red pepper and included the carrot which all made it colorful and crunchy.

I used sweet vidalia onions instead of yellow onions.  I also used Miracle Whip instead of mayonnaise.  The salad was great and everyone who had it raved about it.

Way too sweet. If I made it again, I’d cut the sugar to 2 tablespoons max.

I made it, and it was great; however, like others, I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup. Even with that amount of sugar, it was plenty sweet. Also, I used dijon mustard in place of yellow. I'm not sure why. I know it would have been awesome with yellow. :) My husband loves it!

I made this salad for a funeral luncheon.   I used an entire 16-ounce box of macaroni.  I only used 1/2 teaspoon of mustard since I am not a fan of the mustard taste.   I did not use the onion, green bell pepper nor the pimento peppers as I avoid these foods regularly.  I used more celery and carrots in my recipe.  I mixed up the ingredients the night before I needed the dish.   I think the taste was excellent!  The dressing was definitely not runny but my salad seemed a touch "dry" the next day.  So the only other change that I would make next time is to mix half of the dressing the night prior to serving the salad.  Mix in the remaining half of the dressing an hour prior to serving the dish.  I will definitely be making this macaroni salad again and again.  I do think I might also try this dressing for a cole slaw dish too.

This recipe is absolutely delicious!

 I omitted both peppers because of personal preference. I also used dry mustard instead of yellow mustard. 

It is definitely a touch on a sweet side but that is how I like it! Great recipe!

After reading lots of the reviews, I was prepared for a sweeter macaroni salad.  I think if the name were "Sweet and Tangy Macaroni Salad," most would be more prepared for the flavor.  My husband and I thought it was good and would probably make the perfect pot luck dish because it has such a unique flavor that doubtfully anyone else would duplicate the dish.  I cut the recipe down to 5 servings (based on the automatic serving calculator) and only used 1/4 cup sugar (vs 1/3 that is listed for 5 servings). I set the macaroni and sauce in the fridge (separately) for 48 hrs.  The sauce is perfect smoothness for the macaroni.  The taste was really good (sweet and tangy) and I think would go well with pork chops, fried chicken, etc..  Next time, I think I would cut back just a bit more on the sugar and maybe even the vinegar but not by much or it would taste like all the other recipes.  Definitely something worth making again now that I know what flavor to really expect. Thanks for the recipe Graden.

Made this today to have with our burgers.
Made a half-recipe and used only half of the onion in the recipe, and Stevia Blend instead of the sugar called for.
A really nice side dish —- we’ll make again!

We all really liked it. Made quite a few changes that others suggested. Halfed the sugar, 2tbsp white vinegar and 2tbsp apple cider vinegar, threw in 3tbsp of sour cream and 1/4tsp each paprika and garlic powder. We also used 1 green and 1 red bell pepper. Turned out excellent. Will be making it again.

Great recipe! Easy to make, tasty, and pretty. For my taste, I could’ve used half the onion and a tad less sugar. I would use a whole onion if I had sweet Vidalia onions, but even with regular onion it mellows with time so it’s a good thing to let the salad sit for a couple of hours at least before eating it.

I use half mayo and half miracle whip just my preference. I use half white vinegar and half apple cider. No more than 1/4 cup sugar and I add thawed peas and carrots. I love the texture of peas in a macaroni salad. I made the recipe as written the 1st time and came up with the above. Thanks!
Also, it is wayyyyy better the next day, once the flavors mix and mellow.

Good base recipe, I tweak the seasonings a lot and use cider vinegar. The pimentos are what give it the distinctive aftertaste I like in store-bought macaroni salad.

2 1/2 tablespoons of the mustard powder was a lot (for me anyway) if you don’t want it to over power the sauce, I would cut back on the suggested amount. Otherwise it was very good.

Cut the recipe in half since it was just for my DH and myself. Cut the sugar in half and used rotini pasta instead of elbow. It was very good but as others had suggested I should have cut the sugar, was a little bit too sweet.

This is such a good base recipe!!! I didn't think it was too sweet at all! We added red/green peppers, lots of onion and some boiled eggs. Also added some chopped ham to make it more meal-ish. It's so yummy and we'll be making this often and probably a semi-regular fridge staple. I wish I had a picture lol we've eaten so much of it the last couple days. We did have to make a little extra of the sauce, but that's no big deal. Super yummy!

Recommend NOT adding sugar but adding 1/2-1 tsp dill seasoning for an extra savory perk. Delicious! This is indeed a classic. I also used salad mac instead of elbow, and used dry chopped onions (rehydrated). :)

It was absolutely wonderful. I used Ditalini pasta instead of elbow. My salad came out orange due to the smoked paprika I used. I used a lot of it. I also used ground Chipotle pepper for its smokey flavor and hotness. It really gave the salad a kick. I used extra vinegar, extra kosher salt and less sugar. I used miracle whip & mustard but I omitted the pimento peppers because I couldn't find them at the store. I also used red onions, shredded cheddar cheese and boiled eggs. Everybody loved it.

Best macaroni salad I've had in years!!!  The dressing is amazing and that's more than half the battle when it comes to wonderful macaroni salad!  I did tweak it a little;  about 5-6C macaroni noodles,   a little over a 1/3C of sugar,  1 1/2 C mao(Dukes),  3-4 hard boiled eggs chopped up,  cider vinegar and a generous splash of milk.  Heavenly,  Divine and Perfect!  Thank you so very much for sharing !!!  Reminded me of so many lovely memories of my childhood and the family  that surrounded me......Thank you again!

This is the first time I have ever written a recipe review.   Also the first time I have ever been let down by a recipe by this site.  This macaroni salad was disgusting sweet and runny.   I tried to save it by rinsing the whole bowl of macaroni under water and starting from scratch with a few tablespoons of sugar.   I noticed most reviewers changed the recipe, some drastically.   I learned a lesson to actually read the reviews instead of relying on one that has five stars.

I love this recipe and have made it several times!  I do cut back the sugar and vinegar because I don’t like the sweet macaroni salad.  I add a couple of sliced boiled eggs sometimes.  I use Dijon mustard instead of yellow and it adds a little tart heat to the flavor. It’s really good with the pimentos, but if you don’t have them, is ok because it’s still wonderful!

Yum!!! I doubled it for a larger crowd, and it was a hit! I only used one onion, and I had no celery or carrots. Also, I only refrigerated it for half hour, since I was in a hurry. It still turned out awesome! Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a very simple and tasty recipe for macaroni salad.  I added hard boiled eggs and granny smith apples  to the recipe and it was perfect with the salad.  Great for a family gathering or a barbeque.

New favorite macaroni salad recipe!
I of course made a few tweaks. I didn't have fresh celery, next time I will use celery. I also halved the amount of sugar because 2/3 cups just seemed like too much, 1/3 cup was perfect. I added 1 small cucumber, grated (about a cup). I also added about 1/4 tsp cayenne powder. I only had 1/2 green bell pepper diced and 1/2 of a medium purple onion diced, so I used that. It was just right flavor in my book. We will definitely be making this again. My husband said, "you need to make this more often." Even my five year old who is on the fence about pasta and macaroni salads ate what I gave him!
Winner winner, macaroni salad with dinner!

This is a delicious and very versatile recipe. Per other reviewers, I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup. I would definitely not use more than this as 1/4 cup is on the brink of being overly sweet. I used cider vinegar (which I think was a tad too strong a taste for this dish... I will use the white distilled, as called for, the next time.) I added cubed cheese, green onion, and a sprinkling of dried parsley. I omitted the pimentos as I didn't have any on hand. Everything else in the recipe I kept the same. My husband loved it so much, he asked me to write it down so that I can make it again. (I have a habit of making dishes and then forgetting what recipe I used when I want to make it again.) A+ on this one!

I’ve been making this recipe for years now and the only thing that I change is the amount of sugar. I use less than half of the amount (depending on how much I make) and it’s just sweet enough. I always make it a day ahead because the flavours have time to blend. It’s a crowd pleasers even for the extra picky ones. I always have to make more because my guests leave with some

Way too sweet and I decreased the sugar to 1/3 cup based on other’s reviews. Followed the recipe otherwise.  Very soupy.  Am cooking another pound of elbows to hopefully dry it out and spread the sweetness out.  Glad I made it the night before so I can hopefully save the ingredients and the salad.

Great ratios as written but the first time around I did a boo-boo and went heavy on the vinegar.  Very tasty, so that's how we roll. I also made a batch jammed with tiny-chopped jalapenos and habaneros and BACON that kicked major arse!!

Loved the recipe! I made a few small changes. I changed the mayo from 1 cup to 1 1/2 cups and changed the sugar from 2/3 cup to 1/2 cup. I also added 1/2 cup frozen green peas, just because I like peas in my macaroni salad.

Took other reviewers suggestion, 1/4 cup sugar is plenty.  Also this recipe makes enough for 15 to 20.

Absolutely excellent.  I was skeptical about the sugar (especially after reading some of the reviews), because I'm not usually a "sweet" fan.   But I nervously put in all the sugar called for and it is perfect.  Seriously.   I wouldn't change a thing.  

I didn't have carrots and pimentos, so I did omit those.  And I only used half an onion (just a personal preference).   

Honestly, I think this is the best classic macaroni salad I've ever had or made.  I'm excited to have found this recipe!

Easy to make and very tasty. I did find it to be a little sweet so, next I'll probably cut the sugar in half. Otherwise it's the perfect recipe

Everyone loved this salad!  I did modify.  Taking the advice of some readers, I reduced the sugar (I used slightly less than 1/3 cup and it was the right balance.   I made it Vegan (Vegan mayo), diced two dill pickles and used the pickle juice instead of vinegar, added 1/4 cup grated carrots and some dry chives.  A big hit at 4th of July!

A great, basic comfort food.  I forego the carrots and the whites from hard boiled eggs to make it complete.  It doesn't last more than a day in my home before it's gone.

Revised: 04.27.2019 for the protein I used home made Lox from this site, awesome yo have to give it a try! Another great summertime side ...... it'll compliment Smoked Beef Back Ribs, Roasted Grilled Greek Tacos and Green Chili Cheese Sliders ...... yuppp another Awesome 4th of July pre prepped meal! Added black olives, a bit more mustard,  red bell peppers and baked then re toasted on stove top chopped bacon with black pepper. Agreed ...it's a Classic Macaroni Salad!

This was the bomb.  I made a few changes because I'm not a lover of much veg so the only onion I used was in boiling the pasta.  For colour I added tomato and chives.

The flavour was great.

I chopped the vegetables in my food processor making them very small. I added carrots for color and I added some hard boiled eggs. This was a huge hit and I'm making it for a large party this weekend. Peas would have been perfect in it too.

I made this with a few changes....added onion, hard boiled eggs and cherry tomatoes. It was a huge hit with a crowd. The dressing was delicious.
I also made it a little healthier, used whole wheat pasta, Splenda instead of sugar and a light salad dressing.
5 stars all the way!

I omitted the green pepper and pimento. Cut the sugar  to 1/2 c and mustard to 1 T.  Added some onion and garlic powder. Used red onion and added some peas.  I did have to add a bit more mayo after is sat a while.  I will try combining the macaroni and the dressing shortly before serving next time.  Good staple recipe.

I've made this many times, and it has always been a crowd favorite. I do add some chopped hard boiled egg, and tweaked it with  garlic and onion powder. Make sure you make extra sauce or add less macaroni.... the noodles will absorb the sauce   while chilling.  The first batch I ever made was a tad dry. Leaving it chill overnight completes the process. An excellent recipe in my opinion. Oh yea, one last thing, add some halved cherry tomatoes... it gives it some color and adds to the overall flavor and appeal.

It actually didn’t turn out the way i expected. I had never tried the recipe before the day of my party of 35 people, doubled the recipe and followed the recipe to the letter. I’ve never gone wrong with allrecipes recipes. I doubled the sugar... big mistake. It was so sweet, it was really not edible. . I had a few members of my family taste it, and they agreed with me. If i try this recipe again one day, i won’t put any sugar at all.

This will be the third time I've made this recipe since Mother's Day.  Now my family requested it again for Father's Day!  I reduce the sugar a little bit but otherwise I follow the recipe exactly.  The funny thing is that this is not my favorite macaroni salad as it is too sweet for me but my family loves it!

Made it as a side for a beach picnic, and it came out great.  I used a mix of distilled white vinegar and white balsamic vinegar. I used a mix of regular mustard and Dijon mustard. I also added some sweet relish and chopped dill pickles and used a pinch more salt and pepper than listed.

This was so good! I was initially a little unsure about the flavour combination in the dressing, but it worked very well!

I searched for "classic macaroni salad," and this recipe came up #1 in search results.  (I've eaten it, but I've never made it before.  I wanted to experiment with a trusted, well-rated recipe.)  I'll admit, though, I couldn't make myself use the 2/3 c. sugar called for in the recipe.  We don't eat a ton of sugar, and it just seemed like...a lot.  I ended up using 1/3 c. knowing I could always add more.  I didn't have any pimentos on hand, so I added half a red pepper for color.  Followed the rest of the recipe as written.  I didn't add more sugar -- it was plenty sweet for us -- but I understand that's subjective.  The salad itself was ok.  No complaints, but nothing about it really stood out.  If I use this recipe again I'll probably cut the sugar back further to 1/4 c. I'd also consider a different type of vinegar (maybe apple cider or white wine) and/or a different mustard (maybe dijon or spicy brown) for a little different flavor.

Decided to make for a cookout today. I think it has good flavor but it's way too sweet for me. I'll make it again but cut out a lot of the sugar.  I will see how the other guests like it.

Not a fan of raw onion in salads so I skipped that and added carrots and Fresh Parsley in place of it. I also added four hard boiled eggs and three for garnish with some smoked paprika. Love the wet mix, not as heavy as all traditional Mayo recipes, for sure would make again.

This was my 1st time making macaroni salad and it was very good. I used this recipe  and slightly modified the ingredients. For example, to ensure my macaroni salad was not too sweet I reduced the amount of sugar and white vinegar,.  I also added  more mayo so salad was very creamy.  Additionally, I hard boil eggs that I chop up and add it to my macaroni salad with a little paprika on top.

Thank you to the person who shared this recipe . My family really enjoyed the macaroni salad.

WAAAAAAY too much sugar. I looked at that amount and cut it in half, but it was still too sweet. I spent 20 minutes adding salt, mustard, and garlic powder just to get it to the point of being edible. A solid base recipe with the exception of this. If I made it again, I would start with a couple tablespoons of sugar and increase if necessary. 
I also added cooked chicken to make it a meal, which was good.

The basics of this recipe were really good, however, it is too sweet (even after chilling for 4+ hours) and I even backed off on the sugar by only adding 1/2 cup. So I will use 1/3 c or 1/4 c sugar next time.   I also added one diced dill pickle to break up the sweet a little.  I used Apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar.  I decreased the prepared yellow mustard to 1 Tbsp only because I did not want the mustard to overpower the other flavors and I didn't want the salad to be so yellow, but I did add about a 1 tsp of ground mustard.  Lastly I used 1/2 red onion, instead of 1 white onion, for added color and I prefer the flavor of red onion.  I did not add the pimento as I do not care for that flavor but I did add the carrot.   All in all, I will definitely make this again!

Excellent and quick and easy. I did reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup. I also added about 5 chopped up sweet pickles and did use the pimento. It was not overly sweet had a nice tang to it the way macaroni salad should and was a total hit. Make it the night before and let the flavors blend. HIghly recommended.

This a GREAT recipe to build off of & either follow exactly OR make it your own. THIS is the classic recipe that I think my mother used.  With that said, I deleted the sugar & carrots but used red/yellow peppers which are slightly sweet. I also used lite Hellman’s mayo. My version is slightly acidic but I like it better than the sweeter version. I’m actually chilling my version now & thinking of putting 2 chopped, hard boiled eggs into the mix?

YUM! Delicious and will be added to the recipes I take camping with us! I hated having to change anything in this recipe but i needed to make it lower in fat. I changed the mayo to Miracle Whip Light and omitted the sugar all together. I used apple cider vinager because i did not have any white vinager and I used spicy brown mustard instead of yellow.  This was good!

Other than adding hard boiled eggs, i made according to the recipe.  Since others mentioned to cut back on sugar, i only added a half cup instead of the 2/3 cup.  What i didn't care for was the yellow mustard taste to the dressing,  maybe a spicy brown would have been better or  eliminating it entirely.  So its just okay for me.

This is great! Sometimes I make it with all different colors of bell peppers. I have made this at least 20 times. It always turns out great just never omit the onion or celery, everything else is customizable.

I made this salad with the additions of white wine vinegar instead of white vinegar.  I also cut back on the sugar because the white wine vinegar was also sweet. I did not add carrots because I did not have them but added frozen peas and cucumber in it and some feta. We both loved it

good, but too sweet. I cut down the sugar by about half and it was still super sweet. next time I'll only put 1/4 cup sugar at the most, and add more mustard. it needed more of a tangy flavor. I'd double the carrot amount and pepper amounts as the proportions of noodle to other mix ins was not very good. still a good recipe base, we all have our preferences.

This recipe is great!  My family and friends love it and always ask for the recipe.  The only thing I do slightly different is cut the sugar to 1/3 cup.  It's plenty sweet!

This is the  best tasting Mac salad ever! I used Dijon mustard and decreased by 1 tsp only because my family are not mustard fans.  I also used purple onions and gently blanched them. I am not a fan of raw onions. 
I made sure the Mac was very aldente because it really soaks up the dressing and becomes very tender. 
•••Most important. Let it rest in the refergirator over night.  It will soak up the dressing and become tender.  Do NOT over cook the Mac!

Soooo sweet.  I cut the sugar in 1/3 but still, the first flavor that I get when tasting it is sweetness.  Not what I prefer in a macaroni salad.  I'm sure people who like it sweet would really enjoy this recipe.  It's not right for me though, sorry.

I think the ratios in this recipe are right for everything except the sugar... I wish I had cut it back.. I really thought I should as I was making it but I prefer to make it as called for the first time so ... I pushed forward. Other than it being ENTIRELY too sweet, it would have been good. I would make it again but I'd cut back the sugar by a good bit.. like.. more than half.. maybe 1/4 c total...

This recipe is excellent.  However, it doesn't make enough sauce.  I cut the recipe in half and only use 1.5 cups pasta.  I also reduce the amount of sugar.  It's way too much as written.  I saw many people say the dressing is runny.  Probably because the pasta wasn't cool.

We usually buy a store made salad and they are mediocre at best. So when my sister asked me to bring macaroni salad as a side I found this one. Everyone passed at first and when I insisted everyone of them liked it! I was concerned about having so much as a leftover buy my husband enjoyed having a couple scoops as a side until it was gone

Really way too sweet.  I tried this two times and the second time I used way less sweetener and it still came out too sweet.  I do think this is the first recipe that I have given a low score.  It makes a good base recipe and I would leave out the sugar altogether and maybe use a bit more mustard.

This is the most delicious macaroni salad I’ve ever eaten or made. The only tweak I made was putting two fistfuls of sugar instead of 2/3 cup and using half a red bell pepper instead of green. I did use the pimentos. 

 Next time I will use a tad less onion. I’m also going to add a meat/protein to it. Absolutely scrumptious!

LOVED IT. This will be a basis for several more pasta salads that I get creative with on addition ingredients. I threw in a small amount of chopped jalapenos to give it a bit of a kick. As others suggested I went with only a 1/4 cup of sugar; and for the quarter cup of vinegar I went half and half with white vinegar and apple cider vinegar.   

Next time I will try leaving out the mustard and instead of most of the listed ingredients, I will throw in bacon, lettuce, and tomato for a BLT pasta salad.

Outstanding Mac salad recipe. I did just a couple things different. I used Miricale whip. It sweeter than mayo so I only put 1/4 cup sugar in the mix. I added 3 hard boiled eggs and garnished with black and green olives on top. Delicious

don't make macaroni cheese often but had leftover shells.  used this recipe but really decreased the amounts.  I only used a pinch of truvia and that was enough.  I had some leftover lime vinegrette and used this instead of vinegar.  I also used grainy mustard.  just before serving I stirred in a handful of shredded cheese.  was great

As many people have said, I did find it a little too sweet but I also used Apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar which tends to be a little sweeter. I also found I wanted it a little saltier, but that's just personal preference. I also added garlic powder because I add it to everything. I think this is a good recipe. I always just use my favorite vegetables for these kinds of things, so I just used carrots, bell peppers (using all 3 colors makes it a very colorful dish), cucumber, and black olives. I added onion powder to the dressing as well since I didn't include whole onions.

Great, easy recipe, but like others, I found it a bit too sweet, so I halved the sugar.

I made this like the recipe called for and it was a little to sweet, so next time I will use less sugar.  Everyone liked it though, and it all got ate.

I had to throw this stuff in the garbage.  I sure wouldn't serve it to my guests.  2/3rd of a cup of sugar?  Some one made a huge mistake in this recipe.  But hey, I thought well a lot of people apparently made this concoction and thought it was good so what the heck?  I got to the HUGE amount of sugar in the recipe and I thought.. Really?  But decided to do this recipe just like the recipe told me too.  Big mistake.  Sweet sugar taste in Macaroni salad is a huge boondoggle.  

If you make this, don't follow the recipe and put 2/3 cup sugar in it.  It's a waste of your time and money to do so.

I have the pickiest husband when it comes to Macaroni salad.  He requested that I buy it at the grocery store versus making this recipe.  Well I made this recipe and he could not stop eating the salad.  Awesome flavor.   Thanks!

I was surprised the dressing was so good because I thought the sugar would make it to sweet. I did add red onion and some green pepper too. Simple recipe and very good.

My family likes savory macaroni salad so we did not add sugar. We did add cucumbers - quartered, one very finely minced garlic clove, and the juice from one small lime. Husband loved it.

Absolutely disgusting. This recipe is sweeter than most desserts. My instincts said run away and I should have listened. I'm not sure that salvaging the recipe would even be worth it, but if I tried, I'd eliminate all sugar and all vinegar, add 4 minced hard-boiled eggs, and add 1 cup each of diced green peppers, and sliced radish and 1/2 cup each of packed grated carrot, diced celery, minced onion, and chopped parsley. In other words, I wouldn't make this recipe at all. I hate to give a bad review to any submitted recipe, but this demands a response. Don't do it. There are better recipes everywhere.

Like a lot of you, I tweeked it a little. I added 3 eggs & 2 tbsps. of sweet relish. I also used a sugar substitute. I got many compliments at my cookout! I will definitely make this again!

I made exactly as directed. Everything had settled to the bottom after 4 1/2 hours of chilling. The top was clearly dried out and all of the wet mixture had sunk to the bottom. I stirred it up and it was very good. My suspicion is that tomorrow's leftovers, with the extra fridge time, will be better than good- great even. Would have given higher review if the recipe insisted on make-ahead +4 hours or more mayo or something to think em things up so it didn't all dribble to the bottom.

Made it according to directions, but cut sugar in half.   All a matter of taste, but I prefer a little less sweet.  Perfect and simple macaroni salad. Everyone loved it!

I followed the recipe, like that it's quick, easy, and tasty. Next time I'll play around and add more veggies, sub green onion for sweet onion, a bit less sugar, blanched broccoli sounds good for this recipe

Great recipe.  Like the other reviewers, I cut way down on the sugar -- I put in 1/8 cup and it was sufficient.  Also, I cut down on the salt to  3/4 teaspoon. As a personal preference, our family does not like mustard, so that was omitted.  I swapped out the pimento and replaced it with red bell pepper for a crunchier taste.

I have made this recipe many times and I am often asked to bring it to parties. I make it exactly as written minus carrots.   Do make it the night before so the flavors meld. When melding the macaroni absorbs the sauce, so reserve a small amount to apply right before serving. This one is a keeper!

This recipe is great. We have never added the grated carrots or pimento peppers but usually use a few jalapeños instead. Ive also never found a need for the sugar either. This is a great summer dish.

Sickingly sweet when made as is.  I couldn't eat it.  Unfortunately for me, this led to me frantically draining finished salad in a collander to get as much old dressing off and adjusting spices and dressing before company came.  Ended up scrapping this HUGE thing of salad and just doubling the amount of french fries because I was too embarrased to serve.  I thought to myself 2/3 cup sugar was too much when making but had never used a recipe that made this much before, and thought it would even out.  I didn't take the time to read ALL the reviews about it being too sweet becuase I just glanced at the overall rating and went ahead making it, big mistake.  Gross.

This is a great, basic macaroni salad recipe. You can add and subtract the veges and it still turns out great. I made this without any sugar and it still is delicious. It makes it slightly more savory.

Delicious! I made it exactly as instructed and it turned out awesome. Some reviewers were concerned about the watery-ness when first mixed. If you prep it the day before the noodles absorb the moisture. I added a little bit of cheddar cheese the next morning, and I will experiment more with it the next batch I make.

I had to double the recipe to feed my family. I did what a lot of people suggested and cut down the sugar to a lot less than even what it was before I doubled it. It was still too sweet. I ended up having to add more lemon juice and salt to cut the sweet. There also wasn't enough mayonnaise to deal with the larger recipe. I will be making this again, but I'll be making adjustments as I go.

I make this with gluten free pasta. My wife and family love it never have any leftovers for the garbage! I will make a double batch sometimes and leave it in the fridge for the family to eat with whatever they want. Recipe is simple l would not change a thing.

I'm giving this recipe 4 stars because I don't think it was the perfect recipe. It did give good direction and inspiration and had all the elements to make the dish perfectly to my taste. I didn't add any ingredients in its entirety from the beginning and added more or less to taste. I ended up using the recommended amount of mayonnaise, vinegar, salt, ground pepper, and celery. I added 1/2 of the sugar, 1/2 an onion because I felt it might be too strong, I didn't add a green bell pepper because I didn't have any on hand. I added a red bell pepper. I finely grated 1 whole carrot which came to about 1/2 cup. I added about 2 teaspoons garlic powder to taste. I would have added peas or corn but because it was for a potluck, I wanted to keep it as traditional as possible. Will definitely make this in the future!

This is the first thing I've ever made, that people asked me to make again. Just for that, I give it 5 stars. :) Recipe is easy to follow and delicious. I made it exactly according to the recipe the first time - people, this makes A LOT of pasta salad. We took to church potluck, gave some to my parents, gave some to my in-laws, gave some to the neighbors, and still had plenty for us. Second time, I cut the recipe in half - still had a lot but was just right for gathering of 8-10 adults + kids. Was asked to make it for a third time today (this is a first in my 38 years of life) and will be trying it with olive oil mayonnaise and adding some paprika (found in other reviews). This is a great recipe for a non-cook who needs to bring something to the event - easy to make and people love it!

Great recipe.  I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup and soaked diced onions in ice cold water with a splash of vinegar for 15 minutes to mellow them.  I also used a 16oz box of gemelli pasta.   Delicious!

I would reduce the amount of onion to 1/3 sweet onion, lower the amount of sugar (a little too sweet for my liking) & add 1 more tbsp of pimiento.  Letting it sit overnight makes a huge difference vs only waiting 4 hours.

I made it and my family loved it! I used a 1/2 C sugar, just to cut down on the sweetness. I followed the rest of the recipe to the letter. The only thing I did that was different, is that I made two full batches of the dressing in two separate bowls. In one large bowl of dressing, I added my onions, peppers, celery, three hard boiled eggs, macaroni and mixed well then refrigerated. I placed the second small bowl of dressing in the refrigerator as well. As my macaroni absorbed it's dressing, I had additional dressing on hand, that I could add so the salad didn't dry out. It was very creamy and delicious.

Yes, I made a change...left out the carrots and sugared to taste. My husband said it looked pretty. He liked it a lot. I made this for a lunch tomorrow so it is in the fridge combining the flavors. It may be a summer salad but I will make it anytime during the year.

This was wonderful.  So good for summer.  I just didn't add the sugar because I don't like sweets.  I will definitely make this again!
Thank you for the recipe,
Sandy

I was pleasantly surprised at how good this is!! Based on the amount of reviews, I thought I would give it a try.  I think it's better than my mom's recipe that I grew up on! I can't wait to make it for the next family bbq!!!

I made the dish but followed the recipe loosely.  It turned out good and everyone liked it.  It actually flew off the table.  Because I had so many "on hand" items in it, I renamed it pasta dump.  It will need a little more salt and pepper than what the recipe calls for.  Yum oh !

While I did not use pimento, everything else was done exactly by recipe and we loved it! It was not dry at all. Made it the day before for  a potluck, the flavors werewell blended and yes it does make quite a bit - I will look into halving the recipe next time

Like others ,I put in only 1/2 the sugar.  Sweet  relish and a sprinkle of curry added a great touch.  I added fresh ,chopped chicken and it was amazing . My family all agrees this is by far the best macaroni salad I've ever made!

This recipe was easy to follow.  I did make some modifications to the ingredients.  I read reviews that the salad was too sweet, so I used a little less sugar.  I also used onion powder instead of chopped onion.  I doubled the recipe and it was a huge hit at a backyard BBQ.  I made the salad the night before so that all the ingredients could settle together, it was delish!  First time making a macaroni salad, but definitely not the last and I will continue to use this recipe!!!

In my family potato salad is the constant side at EVERY holiday dinner....not anymore! Thank you for your great recipe and thanks again all recipes for another five star recipe!

This is by far, the best  macaroni salad I have ever tried. No more store bought macaroni salad ( which never really tasted that great to me anyway).  My family just devours  this recipe. I stick to the recipe for the most part. I add different colored peppers and also have added some cubed cheese which my husband suggested.

I make this macaroni salad at least a few times every summer. I give it four stars only because I make a few changes.  I use about half the sugar, add a tad more mustard, some chopped red peppers, and also some shredded cheddar cheese.  It definitely tastes best if you can let it sit a few hours, or overnight like the recipes says.

This is delicious!! Only things I did different were that I used a Vidalia onion - because that's what I had- and added some crumbled bacon on top for a little salty crunch...whole family loved!  I've always just bought macaroni salad- not anymore! Thanks for great recipe

I eat gluten free, so I used gluten free Barilla pasta and this turned out great.  The gluten free pasta comes in smaller boxes (12 oz. versus 16), so I used the rotini pasta, which is larger than elbow macaroni, and it worked out perfectly.  I took it to a spring luncheon/potluck and it was a hit.  I don't think anyone guessed that it was gluten free because it was so tasty.  This is a keeper for sure!

This is a great tasting, easy to make & by far my favorite pasta salad recipe. I have made it many times. The only change I made was to substitute orange instead of green bell pepper, to add a little more color.

Loved the crunch of the veggies.  The flavor was good.  Not enough sauce though.  Could have been more saucy.

The first time I made this salad I made it directly as the recipe stated and I thought it was ok. My husband thought it was too sugary and sweet so the 2nd time I read a few reviews and combined different aspects.  I had changed the servings to 6 so it is a little less than what is the original keep in mind. I added 1/4 a red pepper, diced carrots, I cut the sugar in half, added 3 eggs, reduced the vinegar a smidge, added about 1/2 tsp of garlic powder. This was amazing and a big hit for everyone.

Five stars because, like many others, I find it's absolutely wonderful exactly as presented, But the recipe also has two great strengths: 1. It's versatile and there are a whack of additional ingredients you can add, according to personal preference and taste, without in any way ruining it (roasted red peppers, olives, frozen peas, hard boiled egg, green onion, green or red pepper, corn niblets, for example, little pea-size cubes of cheddar cheese); even the white vinegar can be replaced with red wine vinegar, white wine vinegar or apple cider vinegar without ruining the recipe, these merely add a more slightly fruity accent; and 2. The secret key is the vinegar, sugar, mayonnaise, dry mustard, salt and pepper sauce. It needs nothing more.

Delicious! I used rice vinegar instead because that's all I had and it is great! It came out kind of sweet!

Loved this recipe!!  Added some dried cranberries one time (just because I had some!)  Another time added sun-dried tomatoes.  Recipe easily halves.  Used less sugar and that was fine.  Will try others suggestions in the future.

Pretty good! I love the 'creamy sauce' that's in it. We didn't add any sugar because I didn't want a sweet pasta salad. 

Next time, I would add tomatoes, more shredded carrot and maybe a few other veggies. Maybe some cheese? 

Ended up adding some hard-boiled eggs to it too and that added a perfect touch to this recipe!

For this recipe, I removed  the bell peppers.  Turns out even better without the after taste that bell peppers give. I also add 6 boiled and chopped eggs. It helps reduce the sweetness.

Fantastic! Tastes like the stuff from the deli. I cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup, used brown mustard,  increased the pepper, added garlic powder and used  apple cider vinegar directly to the noodles, as another reviewer mentioned.

I really liked this macaroni salad.  I do have a couple of things I would do differently next time I make it:  

- Use a little less sugar
- Use only larger size elbow macaroni
- Less onion - you don't want the onion to overpower it - which is what happened to me when I used a whole large onion

Excellent mac salad!

This pasta salad is perfect. I don't like the crunch of raw onions so I grate the onion instead of chopping it.

I have made this salad since i found it here a few years ago and its been a hit with my family ever since.  Like most i cut down on the amount of sugar. I also skip the bell pepper and substitute the white onion with Red Onion, it is delicious!  I think this recipe must be tweak to your own taste.

I have made this recipe many times.  It is very easy to make, not a lot of prep work.  I follow the recipe as is and always get rave reviews.  It says that it will serve 10 but in reality it will serve many more.  I enjoy making this for our family reunion because it can be made a head off time with great results. Even the kids like this  recipe.

I really liked the blend of flavors but it was a little too sweet for my taste. Next time I think I would use 1/4 cup of sugar and add some sour cream.

The dressing on this salad was very good.  I added 1 tablespoon of sweet pickle relish.  Next time I will add 2.  I also thought there was too much green pepper and maybe too much celery.  Radishes might be a nice addition and maybe a couple of eggs or cubes of cheese.  Will be making it again.

I added about 3/4 cup of sliced black olives along with a generous cup of cubed Colby cheese. Tip:  the outside of the macaroni box says 16 oz when in actuality it was exactly 4 cups. This recipe needs to sit for 24 hours uncovered or else it will be runny. Be patient. This is an awesome recipe that my family LOVED!  I will be making this again for sure. This recipe will make a huge bowl so it is great for a large family or party. Also I chose to leave out the carrots and palmettos.

This is the very first recipe I found on this site.  I have never been a huge cold pasta fan .... until now!

Making it the day ahead of time makes a world of difference in the flavor.  I love to make this pasta along with roasted chicken breasts and fresh fruit for a large gathering of friends and family.  They fight to see who gets to take home the leftovers (if there are any!)

I did cut the sugar in half like others recommended. I do add blanched broccoli flourettes for additional veggies, color and textures.

Loved it!!!! Only thing I would change for next time is a bit less sugar & a bit more mayo. To combat the sweetnees I added a bit more mustard & it worked. I also used "Light Mayo" to reduce fat & didn't use vinegar since I didn't have any, but it didn't seem to make a difference so I'm pleased!

We loved this recipe. It is simple enough for the kiddies to enough but still has something for the grown up crowd. I love how much this recipe makes. I made it up, split it in two and gave half to my mum and took the other half to my mother in laws house for Christmas lunch (its super hot here we have salads and cold meats for lunch here).
There was enough for both sides, awesome and it is a cheap recipe to make. Cousins on my husband's side are Vegan and this was SUPER easy to make vegan without losing any taste or flavour (we just used the normal Mayo that happened to already be vegan)

As you would guess by the 4 cups of uncooked macaroni, this recipe makes a ton!!  I used less sugar (about 1/2 c.) and didnt add the optional grated carrot or pimentos.  I made the dressing the day or 2 before and then added to the chilled macaroni the day of.  I wish I had doubled the dressing because it seemed a little dry - I wouldn't have needed double, but probably 1.5x the original amount.  Although it would have been nice to have extra to add if needed when we ate it as leftovers.  Would be good with cut up crab.  I gave it a 4 instead of 5 stars because although it was good, it was just a basic salad and nothing too exciting.  
Thanks for the recipe!

Yum!  I wanted something to go with ribs, but the store bought mac salad is too saucy for my taste.  This is perfect.  I did cut down on the sugar a bit (used a little less than 1/4 c.)  I 'm not fond of green bell pepper so I left them out and I didn't have the pimentos.  I used red onion.  It is really tasty.  Looking forward to seeing how much better it is tomorrow.

Perfect classic mac salad like I used to get in the delis back East!  Alterations:  halved the sugar and onions, added 1/4 cup cider vinegar,  added teaspoon of dill relish.  Delicious!

To make it vegan friendly, I used "Just Mayo," instead of mayonnaise. My husband and kids really enjoyed this sweet tasting recipe.  My son even asked me to pack some in his school lunch for the next day.

Cut the sugar in half and it was still a little sweet, and used apple cider vinegar.  Otherwise, made as written, leaving out the optional bits. Great macaroni salad!

Made this salad yesterday and it was a huge hit. I set the quantity to 15 people which called for 3 pounds of pasta and it was way too much left over. This is a great recipe and definitely going to keep this one!

I normally don't like macaroni salad with mustard in the sauce, however this turned out very good.  I made it for a party and got many rave reviews on it.  I left out the peppers, carrots and pimentos as we didn't have any on hand, but otherwise made as is.  Will definitely be making again!

Perfect classic macaroni salad recipe. One caveat:
I had to reduce the sugar. I used 1/3 c. (as recommended by others) and even that was sweet, but not overbearing. I may try 1/4 c. next time. We love a tangy salad so we did add more vinegar to the recipe than it called for as well. We used shells and they were great little dressing carriers! Delicious same day and day after! This is a keeper for sure! Thank you.

This is my go to macaroni salad - I've made it exactly as described in the beginning.  Its very good, but I like my way better. I now use dijon in place of regular mustard,  Follow your Heart Veganaise (expensive, but worth it) and I use half the sugar.  I like the small round macaroni better, I make sure to dice my veggies very small to keep a consistent salad. It is very popular with my family and friends.

Loved, loved, loved this salad.  I made a full batch but I live by myself and passed around the rest.  Every person I gave to wanted the recipe and raved about it.  I probably would cut down on the sugar a bit though.  Definitely the macaroni salad to take to parties, picnics.

This was a classic mac salad.  But I found it a little bland.   I added fresh parsley and basil. Would be good with dill too. I make half of the amount. So obviously I cut the dressing in half as well.  I find it to sweet, so the second time I made it I only added about 2 Tbsp. of sugar.  Everyone in the family like it.

tried this as was, too sweet. so I cut the sugar to 1 tsp and used 3T diced dill pickles in place of the vinegar. for heat I added 2T diced poblano and a shake of cilantro (fresh cilantro would be even better). I boiled the whole wheat elbows only 2 minutes, drained and added to the rest while still hot, then into the fridge for at least an hour. over night is even better.. yummmm!!

I made this recipe as written, using the optional pimentos but not the carrots (only because I didn't have carrots on hand). I think the salad would have been even better with the orange color and crunchy texture of carrots, although it was very crunchy and textured without them. It was delicious as written, but adding some Jane's Krazy Mixed-Up Salt improved it and added an extra layer of flavor. This is a perfect easy potluck dish and tastes just like the macaroni salad you get from the deli.

Edit: It's even better on day two! Let it sit in the fridge overnight.

This has become my families favorite macaroni salad.  It is easy to whip up quickly and is very tasty.  Four stars instead of five because as others mention, the published recipe is way too sweet. So now, I cut the sugar in half and use cider vinegar.  Other than that, I follow recipe exactly.

I made as is minus the pimento.  It was great!  Got lots of compliments!  Be sure to chop the veggies small and make the night before to mellow the onion and meld the flavors.

This was a great salad! I also used less sugar as well as less bell pepper. Lastly, I added seasoned salt instead of regular table salt.

I liked it. I only added 1/3 c sugar because 2/3 seemed like too much. I left out celery because I don't like it and pimentos because I didn't have any. Next time I think I'll only add 1/4 c sugar since it was really sweet. I also added more miracle whip than 1 c, 2 chopped cucumbers and can of drained corn. It was delicious.

I have never made macaroni salad---but this recipe has changed that.  My only suggestion is to reduce the sugar by two thirds.  Exceptional taste and looks good with any barbecued food.  Thank you!

This recipe looked really good except the sugar and vinegar amounts. So I only used about 1 TBS of each and changed the celery to seedless cucumbers and  used about half the onion. It turned out great!

My husband really liked this recipe and so did I.  It was so good that I adapted it to Cole slaw, using cabbage, carrots and green pepper plus the dressing ingredients.  The sweetness is what my husband liked.  I have substituted Splenda for the sugar on occasion.  I did cut the recipe in half which seems more than enough for a large dish.  Maybe if you are preparing for a party or large family, you might want to prepare the whole quantity.

YUM!!!  I used 1.5 boxes of macaroni noodles but kept the sauce ratio about the same (just over-measured on the mayo).  I did cut the sugar down to a little shy of a 1/4 C & added a some finely chopped red pepper instead of pimento.  VERY happy how this turned out (see my pic).  :o]

My family loves this macaroni salad. The only thing I changed, like many of the others that commented, was I only used a 1/2 cup of sugar and 1/4 cup of vinegar and added a few dashes of paprika.  Thank you for the recipe. I make it at least once a month.

I cut the sugar to 1/4 c but I found it still WAY too sweet for my taste. My kids won't eat it because it's too sweet for them too but my husband likes it, so it's not a total waste. I like that it thickened overnight and I think it'll really be good next time if I cut the sugar down even more to maybe 1 or 2 tbsp. This definitely won't be my go to recipe but now I have a better idea of what I want and how to get there from here.

My family usually doesn't eat macaroni salad but they demolished this one. Great recipe! I did make some small changes. I used a green onion, red bell pepper and added a little garlic powder. Absolutely delicious.

A tad bit on the dry side, so I added some additional mayo.  Otherwise, it totally reminds me of the macaroni salad my grandmother made.

I should have read the reviews- 2/3 cup of sugar was way too sweet. I added garlic powder and paprika also. I also added a couple jalapenos   (we like spicy food) instead of green pepper. I added the shredded carrots. I will make this again, just using less sugar.

It was different than other macaroni salad I've had. Definitely on the sweet side. Almost tasted like a honey mustard sauce in it. I followed directions exactly with the exception of adding cheese and it got good reviews so I would make again possibly adding ham next time as I think it would compliment the flavour.

I used half mayo, half miracle whip for a total of 1.5 cups, 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar, 1/4 cup sugar, 1 Tbsp. mustard and 1 tsp. each garlic powder, season salt and pepper. Used 4 veggies: 1 red and 1 yellow bell pepper, 2 carrots, and 2 stalks celery. I also added 8 slices cooked chopped bacon. Made this for a work party and it was gone in 5 minutes!!! With these changes everyone said it was the best pasta salad they ever had, 9 people asked for the recipe!

Best recipe I've found except I used cider vinegar instead of white vinegar which gave it a less pickled flavor which was phenomenal! I'll definitely be using this recipe from now on!

This recipe is spot on the traditional Macaroni Salad I came to love from all the little league picnics and Kids football banquets from the 70's.  Nothing frou frou, or strange,  just the exact flavor profile I have come to love.  I used Low Fat Hellman/Best Foods Mayo in place of regular,  Absolutely wonderful!!!!

Big hit! Some revisions: Used 6 ounces mayo, 2 ounces mayo with olive oil and added a tablespoon of pickle juice; used thinly sliced green onions; skipped the green pepper and onion, but did use the grated carrots and pimiento. I will make this often and next time try with less sugar.

I reduced the sugar like several others did.  It was pretty good, but the dressing needs some fine tuning.  I will also finely chop the veggies instead of dicing next time.

I couldn't bring myself to use the whole amount of sugar. So used half and thought it was still too sweet.The rest of the recipe was good, I'll just cut back on the sugar a little more next time...I think 1/4 is all that's needed.

Good recipe that can be modified with various veggies. I halved the sugar, as many have suggested, but it still is a bit sweet, so I'll reduce the amount of sugar next time.

I just made this recipe today, but because I changed a few things.
I used diced sweet onion instead of red, used no peppers, and diced 1/4 cup of carrots.  This was fabulous. It's not very creamy, so if you're looking for one that is, add 1/2 more of mayo.

I halved the sugar to 1/3 C. and it was STILL too much sugar. I ended up making a whole other half batch, sans the sugar, just so I could cut the sweetness down to a tolerable level. It perhaps had too much vinegar, too, but maybe I just didn't like the recommended vinegar because it was just so cloyingly sweet. It was like eating tangy candy! If you're not a fan of sweet salads, I'd recommend only adding a tablespoon of sugar.

I forgot the sugar at first and we rinsed the pasta, so it was a little bit watery when we finished. That said, I cut down on the amount of sauce a little and there was a lot at the bottom of the bowl.

I have made this recipe twice to rave reviews. Only changes from the original was cutting the sugar down to 1/2 cup, using scallions instead of the onion and I omitted the peppers. I found making the salad the night before gives the flavors a chance to meld and cuts down the sweetness.

This was delicious! A huge hit! I would recommend the same as a few other comments, not to use as much sugar or vinegar, as I halfed it and it was still plenty sweet. Also to wait to mix the macaroni together with the sauce til the day of. Was very creamy and good!

This is the best Macaroni Salad I have ever made!  I followed the recipe exactly, but did not use the optional pimentos.  Made it for Christmas Eve and everyone loved it.  I will definitely make it again and again.  Thank you!

One of the staples in the summer months in my house! It's a great salad recipe. I like mine less sweet but it is certainly easy enough to adjust.

Yum, this was delicious, although I made a few changes. I didn't add the pimentos or celery as I do not like crunchy things in my salad, and I added half a can of tuna. Will definitely make this again.

Made half the recipe & it easily served 8 as a side dish. Made as written with the addition of 1 hard-boiled egg, a mixture of red, green & yellow bell pepper, did not use the carrot or pimento. Nothing more to say, just a 5-star good, classic macaroni salad!

Needed a quick recipe and this did the trick. Delicious, but I did changed some things. Added 1/4 cup of sugar and 1 1/2 tablespoon of mustard instead. Will be making this again.

This is delicious! I'll definitely make it again, with a couple minor changes. The onion was a bit too much for me, so I'll reduce the amount used in the future. And like other people have said, this dish practically begs for me to add hard-boiled eggs.

Pretty darn good, Graden! Chloe didn't really like it too much, but that's only because Mommy only had spicy mustard, not yellow. It gave It a kick though!

Delicious! I didn't change a thing, except I used a whole box of elbow macaroni. As with all pasta salads, the pasta soaks up some of the moisture overnight. I added some plain old water to it in the morning, just to loosen it up a bit. I didn't find it too sweet as some others said. Brought it to a potluck at church and came home with an empty bowl. That says it all. Thanks for the recipe.

Love, Love, Love this!!!  I followed the recipe but reduced the sugar slightly.  I also added broccoli & sharp cheddar cheese cubes.  I couldn't wait 4 hours to eat it, so I made an additional batch for our BBQ tomorrow.  Very versatile!!!  This would also be good with celery or bacon added.

Great alternative to pasta salad or a three bean salad. I made only 1/2 of the recipe.  Only two in our
household.  You should try it!

I think this is a great starting point for a macaroni salad.  I also thought it was WAY too sweet.  I made half a batch (perfect as a side dish for 4-6 people) so next time instead a 1/3 C sugar I will only use 1-2 T.

Delicious, a great starter recipe! I was skeptical, however, with the large amount of sugar (and even I am a sugar NUT). The kids were on the fence about it too, and so i had my mother taste it and her feedback was that it was a WAY too sweet. Cutting down the sugar almost in half made all the difference in the world!! Awesome recipe otherwise, I will be using this one forever!

I made this for lunch for my wedding day.  Super easy and it was amazing!  It tastes very similar to restaurant/store styles...I followed the recipe exactly (but added very little carrot and no pimentos).  I will be making again...had many people ask for the recipe!

This came out really well!  I made the dressing as is except I only used half the sugar called for.  Also I didn't  measure the vegetables, I just chopped a bunch up and threw them in.  This was a very yummy macaroni salad recipe.  I plan on making it again!

It was good, but it was somewhat lacking flavor.  I tihnk in order to make it 5 stars you would need to make a few changes.

I think the dressing for this is perfect as-is and it tastes as good as the stuff you buy in the deli section! I do leave out the celery and carrot though, since we don't like them raw, and increase the peppers to compensate. I'll also substitute fresh red peppers for the pimientos if that's what we have on hand.

To me this salad was "ok".  It may just be personal preference but I didn't care for sweetness of a macaroni salad.  I made it as directed.

So good! Big hit with kids and adults. Made this just as written, but I reduced the sugar a little bit and found it still sweet, but pleasantly so. The grated carrots are essential in this salad, they really add a lot.  You should absolutely make this at least the night before, because the flavor improves so much after chilling together overnight, great recipe!

While I loved the basic recipe, it was a little seet for our taste.  I will definitely make again, but will decrease the sugar to 1/3 c.

So simple and quick to make.  I chopped and mixed all of the dressing ingredients while the macaroni was cooking.  Will definitely be making this dish frequently!

After reading the reviews, I cooked the macaroni and added light mayo, mixed thoroughly.  I made the "dressing" seperately (it makes a lot so halve it) and added it to taste.  Everyone loved it.

I basically followed the directions to the T...
 All i did was a dded 3 eggs, and doubled it. This was VERY wet, even after sitting OVER 8 hours in the fridge!!! I was expecting a creamy end result!!!!
 And the after taste is a bit strong of onion. 
Was a TAD on the sweet side, but the tang of the vinegar kinda compensated for that.

 Good base to tweak next time.... OK IF YOU use it "AS-IS"; unless you like a very wet, tart and tangy Mac salad with a onion after taste....!

Great recipe but it calls for way to much sugar.  1/4 cup is more than enough.  This is a great "make ahead" recipe, as it tastes even better the next day.

Very yummy.  Perfect for a summer picnic.  Just added some hard-boiled eggs and used Splenda rather than sugar, and apple cider vinegar.

One of the best we've ever had.  Love the dill weed added that another member suggested.  Will save the recipe for family members.

Fantastic recipe, everyone loved it!
I did cut the vinegar, and the sugar in half (personal preference) I thought it was way too sweet.
Thanks for the recipe, it will be my go to Mac salad recipe from now on.

I make this all the time EXACTLY as it is besides the fact that I don't use macaroni. I find that shells hold on the sauce and flavor much better. Awesome recipe!!!

GREAT recipe! Followed just as written-- Except I did listen to other reviewers and cut the sugar back to 1/4 cup, and it is plenty sweet! Also did not add pimentos or celery, but added a red bell pepper in addition to the green bell pepper. Great recipe...will use all summer long!

This is one of the macaroni salad recipes that gets shared whenever I make it for a large group. I usually bring extra copies of the recipe because so many people ask for it.  I was a little hesistant about adding the sugar to the dressing, but it mixed with the flavors of the vinegar, mayo, and mustard so well!  The only thing different I did was to omit the green pepper, only because I don't care for them (too overpowering).

I made this earlier today for the 4th of July tomorrow & I can't stop eating it!! Delicious!! I did change a few things though and did add some things. I felt that much sugar is just crazy so I only used 1/2 tablespoon probably pointless but that’s what I used. I only used half a red onion and it still has a lot of onion flavor which is fine with me but for others it may be too much.  I didn’t use celery or pimentos. I did use the carrots and green pepper. I also used 3 hard boiled eggs and mild shredded cheddar.  I used 50 % more mayo and another tablespoon or so of mustard. We will see what everyone thinks tomorrow but my husband & I already love it & can’t stop eating it! Hopefully it will last and be around tomorrow if we don’t eat it all before then.

This recipe is YUMMY!!!  I cut down the sugar to a litte more than 1/3 cup as other users suggested and used Veganeise instead of mayo.  I'm usually not a huge fan of macaroni salad cuz it's too mayo-y, but needed to make something for a BBQ, so I tried this.  My spoon kept going into the bowl cuz I couldn't stop eating it.  Def going to keep this recipe for future use!!

This recipe has the perfect combination of ingredients that give the dressing for this macaroni salad a pleasing and fresh taste.  I tweaked the other ingredients to include my family's favorite veggies - lots of chopped up ripe tomatoes, one cucumber sliced thin and quartered and left out the pimento and the peppers.  It received a rave review and I have since prepared this and brought it to parties and other gatherings - and it's always been a hit.

This is my go-to recipe for Macaroni Salad.  I get swamped with requests for the recipe everytime I make it.  Next to my Deviled Eggs, this is the most requested dish for me to bring to any gathering.

The only thing I do different, is no carrot (hubby doesn't like it).  But I put in red pepper and yellow pepper to make it more colorful.  It's still the best recipe in my box.  :D

Update:  Still making it as scripted omitting carrot and still family fave. - August 2015!

Very easy to make and a thumbs up by friends and family, however I used half the amount of sugar called for as I found it too sweet already.  I would also substitute the onions for spring onions next time.

Whipped this salad up tonight and it is scrumptious, love it!!! It is a sweet salad and I think that is what makes it sooo good.  I did add some boiled eggs and held the carrots and pimentos. Can't wait to taste it tomorrow :)

loved it,just like one my Mom used to make, she added ham for dinner. I did the celery,green peper,red onion,cherry tomatoes(halved),cucumber and crumbled bacon.I followed others advise mixed it all the night before except the tomatoes and let chill very well before I added 1/2 the dressing I added the other half just before serving.Definitely tastier the longer it sits.

This was excellent. I was craving macaroni salad and found this recipe to give a try. I had tweaked it a little bit because of a few ingredients I didn't have. I didn't have distilled vinegar so I used white balsamic vinegar to the measurements in this recipe. This substitute definitely added a punch to it! I didn't have pimentos so I just used black pepper, yellow, and red peppers is all I had so used those. Overall still turned out just as delicious! Had two bowls of it. It's going with me to lunch tomorrow for work!

I couldn't bring myself to use a whole 2/3 cup of sugar, so I only used about 2 Tbsp, but then reduced the mustard by about half so it wouldn't be too tart.  I still had to add about another 1/2 cup of mayo, as the pasta sort of soaked that up after a while.  I used 1/2 cup chopped vidalia onion, one stalk celery and one small red bell pepper.    I also added about 4 chopped hard-boiled eggs, as we like eggs in our macaroni salad.  Ended up being a crowd pleaser!

This was a great recipe.  I used 1/4 cup sugar and added a little dill relish and sweet relish, and I didn't have celery  or carrots, and add some sliced green olives. I would use the green olives again.

tripled this recipe for a birthday party, modified only to add 1 red bell pepper rather than green. did not add any carrot or pimento. made the 'dressing' the night before and added to chilled macaroni the next day. Perfect consistency and perfect flavor. Definitely a keeper.

This salad was great! I made it the first time for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit.  The only thing I might change next time is to cut down on the sugar just a little bit.

This is really good pasta salad! It's definitely on the sweeter side..and I only used 1/2c sugar. I added Garlic powder and a can of peas! Delish!

Made for a surprise party and it was a BIG HIT! Here are my modifications: I used apple cider vinegar, Ken's honey mustard dressing, hard boiled eggs, red and green peppers BUT left out the celery (not a fan). I put the chopped carrots on the top the next day. The macaroni had soaked up most of the dressing over night so I made 1/2 the dressing again and added it to the macaroni. This is why I only gave it 4 stars even so I won't buy store brand macaroni again!

This recipe was amazing!  I made it for my daughters birthday party BBQ and everyone loved it...there was nothing left.  The only thing I did less of was the sugar & used a spicy brown mustard, because that is all I had.  But it was great...thank you.

zesty...and family approved. Will make again and again. Super easy to throw together. I was worried at first bc the sauce was runny. I threw the elbow mac. & sauce in separate bowls in the fridge and let them chill until I needed it. Once we were ready for lunch I made sandwiches and threw the elbow mac. & sauce together and voila! I made this on a short notice as a side to go with my club sandwich.   Yummy!

This was a good recipe, a little sweet, so next time I will reduce the sugar and the vinegar.  It was very popular with the crowd I served it to.  I kept the celery and the onions, but I substituted the carrots and peppers for diced ham and red kidney beans and added fresh green peas.  The sauce was very nice.

If you like Macaroni salad, this is a great recipe, though I left out the celery, bell pepper and optional pimento.  Unfortunately I'm the only one in my family that likes macaroni salad, though my husband said it was the best one he's had.

This is THE best Macaroni salad!  Every time I make it someone asks me for the recipe!  I do not add the carrots or pimento!  Always make it the day before for the best blending of flavor!

My official macaroni salad recipe from here on out!  Skipped the green peppers, carrots and pimentos.  Used Miracle Whip instead of Mayo.  The dressing was perfect!  Thanks!

UPDATE: I veganized this using Veganaise and its still awesome!  Thanks again!

Very good dressing, needed to make last minute side dish with ingredients on hand, I used tri color rotini noodles, cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup omitted celery & green pepper, substituted 3 hard boiled eggs & bag of frozen peas, turned out great.

I used 1/2 the sugar but thought this was still too sweet for my taste..I will also cut down on the mustard a little as well.  A nice, plain macaroni salad is what I like, and with small changes I think this would be it!

Two stars for presentation- it is very pretty.  I sure wish I'd read other reviews first and cut down on the sugar- way too sweet for my taste.  However, it's going to a potluck so at least it will look nice on the table!

I made it as is, and other than being too sweet for my personal liking, it was fantstic! Got really great review from the potluck, so I think it's just my personal taste about the sweetness. Will make it again for sure with less sugar! Yum!

Seriously delicious. I added my own little twist by using colorful macaroni, no mustard (cause my family doesn't like mustard), some yellow and red chopped up bell peppers, some chopped up broccoli and easy on the Mayo. Delicious. The white vinegar gives it a yummy taste. Great recipe! Thank you :)

Good basic recipe.  I read reviews and reduced sugar by 1/2 and used only a small onion and it was still too much onion.  Very good besides the onion.  And - just a word of caution.  I used a red pepper since I didn't have green and it turned the salad a lovely shade of pink!!!

Less onion for sure. That may just  be my taste though. The dressing is really good.

For some reason it turned out a bit dry.  We usually prefer to eat our pasta salads on day 2 because they tend to be more flavorful.  The flavor was good, but the pasta absorbed all the dressing.

I love this salad.  I did cut back on the sugar as suggested,didn't have pimento, and I used spicy brown mustard.  Everyone loved it, there were no leftovers.

I give this recipe five solid stars, though I did make some changes to original: - My husband's allergic to carrot so I substituted a large handful of fresh peas.  - added two hard boiled eggs. - I'm a huge fan of apple cider vinegar so I added that instead of distilled and the flavor really came through beautifully! - Lastly, I added about half a tablespoon of dill and used fresh ground peppercorns equaling about 1 teaspoon (I love the stuff!).  The dressing was wonderful, creamy and flavorful. The recipe also made enough for a large family gathering or party! Will make again!

A very nice standard Mac Salad with a zippy flavor.  Not bland like a reg Mac salad with just Mayo. I didn't have white ditilled vin but I did have some rice wine vin. That is already sweetend and I added sugar to taste. I also added eggs as I felt my family would miss them. Also I want to note that people are saying that it is watery. Tto avoid this, do not rinse your pasta and let it steam off excess water in the strainer not a bowl until cool. and also refrigerate for the 4 hours, it will be perfect.

This was the first Macaroni Salad I've ever made and it was a huge hit.  I used onion powder instead of raw onions due to personal preference, and instead of shredding carrots I finely chopped.  With these additional it was still thoroughly enjoyed.

Just made this.  Too sweet for my taste.  I'd cut back on half the sugar.  You can always add more if you like it sweeter.  I also skipped the peppers and the carrots, as my guests won't like them, but if I was making this for myself, I'd add them for the crunch and color.

This is really, really good!! I added some chopped Spanish olives, I've read that some people haved added a hard boiled egg and I am thinking of adding that next time. Oh yeah, there will be a next time for this recipe - it is that good. I'll never buy store bought macaroni salad again!! Just a heads up, when you go to serve this, it may be  a little dry. If you like a creamy salad I would reccomend making more of the dressing to add onto the salad before serving.

This salad was a big hit at my family reunion. Very delicious, instead of green peppers I used yellow bell peppers. I also took advice from some of the viewers, chill the dressing and the macaroni seperate. Good idea, the salad was nice and moist.

Loved this classic salad and super easy to whip up the day before.  I used balsamic white vinegar instead since it was all I had at the time and it worked well. I also put the onion in a food processor instead of just chopping it since there were a few people who may not have tried it had they seen the chunks of onion.

Loved it, I did alter the recipe a little. I omitted the green pepper and carrots. Instead I used half of the sugar, 1 can of mexicorn, chopped seeded tommatoes. The rest of the recipe I kept the same. If i had used 2/3 cup sugar it would have been way to sweet.

I was not incredibly impressed with this salad.  I, like a number of other reviewers, found it to be a bit too sweet for my taste.  I prepared it for a dinner at my in-laws and initially only let it chill for around six hours.  It was ok then, but very sweet.  I then let the leftovers chill overnight and tried the salad again without much change in the flavor.  I did add three hard boiled eggs, but other than that I prepared it exactly as directed.  I may try the recipe again, but alter it as previously suggested and use less sugar.

I made this recipie for 50 people and only had to make a few adjustments. I ended up adding an extra 2 cups of mayo, decreased the amount of onions, switched the green peppers with pickle relish and I added shredded cheddar cheese and hardboiled eggs. I would probably not add the hardboiled eggs next time as it just didn't seem to "mesh" well with how the rest of the recipie tasted.  Also I noticed that the macaroni absorbed the creamy dressing once it cooled so cooling the macaroni first would probably fix this problem.

Made for 20 for a church picnic and was fantastic!  I cut back on the sugar, but no other changes.  Definitely a keeper.

This was a hit at my BBQ! I minced the onions and other veggies in the food processor so there weren't large chunks of onion/pepper/carrot and I would definitely do that again! Thanks!

This is good.  Just right amount of ingredients. I did not have green pepper and I added 2 boiled eggs.  I used "cutting celery" from my garden and was delicious.  We will make this all the time.

What could I have been thinking by only making a half recipe of this salad?  I'm starting a campaign to rename this to "WORLD'S BEST MACARONI SALAD".  I did adjust the mustard and sugar to our taste, this recipe was the tool to make an extraordinary salad.

There was definitely too much sugar, and I could have done with half a medium onion.  I added some curry powder to mine (once I was done correcting for the sweetness) and it was delicious.

This was an easy macaroni salad and, while its still melding in the fridge, the preliminary tests came out very good. I made it as specified but with whip instead of mayo, and one and a halved the recipe (6 cups pasta, everything else increased proportionally).  I will likely make again for future cookouts, as the macaroni salad they sell pre-made tends to be a little heavy and gross. This has a nice fresh, clean feeling.

I would suggest that you use Miracle Whip and eliminate the vinegar and sugar.  This will make a less sweet salad I also would add Colby Cheese in bite size chunks this adds a richness that is wonderful with the vegtables.

This is my family's favorite recipe.  Every time I make it, and no matter where I bring it, the salad gets rave reviews.  It's so easy and it is delicious.  It goes with all kinds of foods and is perfect for a picnic or barbecue.  I follow the recipe exactly, but I use Splenda in place of sugar.  Love it!

i say be careful not to add to much vinegar...a little goes a long way and too much will ruin it (I made that mistake).  Otherwise, very good.  I added chopped pickels and hard boiled eggs too.

Good base.  Use less sugar and vinegar. I nixed the bell pepper and pimento. Seasoned to taste. I used olives, hard boiled eggs, celery, pickles, red onion, cucumber, carrot, and mac. How's my elbow?

Overall pretty good. I used the full amount of sugar and it was not to sweet. Next time I will omit the onions as they were a little overpowering, as well as use a little less vinegar and mustard.

So-so.  Only used 1/4 cup of sugar which was enough.  Also used whole-grain macaroni.  Didn't like the taste of the raw onion.  The recipe as a whole seemed to lack something.  It made a TON.  Lasted forever.

Good basic dressing, but it's just too sweet. I had read the reviews stating they thought it was too sweet so I put in 1/2 cup and tasted...already too sweet! I'd limit it to 1/3 cup sugar. When I rebalanced all of the ingredients to this measure it was the perfect blend of sweet and tangy.

Totally wonderful recipe! Everyone loved it! :) Only change for me is to add less sugar than called for. It was a little too sweet but tasted amazing none the less! :) Thanks for sharing!

This salad is fantastic. I have made it numerous times following the recipe exactly and it turns out delicious each time. The last time I made it I used red onions, red bell pepper instead of green, and added frozed peas and diced ham and it was even better. The base for this salad is so good that you can experiment with it making changes until it is your own. It is fun to try different ingredients just to see how it turns out and I have not ruined it yet. I may try trowing in some red grapes next time just to see how it tastes.

I'm just really confused about the 2/3 CUP of sugar!  That seems like a whole lot of sugar to me.  I put in a few tablespoons and it was still sweet and delicious without the added calories and a cotton-candy amount of sugar!

Great salad recipe!  Easy and Quick.  I halved the recipe and omitted the carrot and pimento peppers.  Instead of sugar I substituted 2 packets of splenda.  Turned out fantastic- perfect blend of sweet and tangy.

Love this recipe! Substituted apple cider vinegar and only added 1/3 c sugar. Also added peas, but not carrots. Big hit with the family. I'll keep using this one!

Wow! This recipe is fantastic! The vinegar really added a special flavor to it. The serving yield is way off - what they have as ten servings is definitley enough for 20-25! I added hard-boiled eggs and a bit more mayo.

I am giving this 4 stars because we all have different tastes, likes and dislikes.  I made some changes and my result was more like 3 stars - just mediocre.  I decreased the sugar significantly as hubs sometimes has an aversion to sweet things (unless, of course, it's a Reese's cup).  I used green onion and red bell pepper, no carrot or pimentos.  I also added some hard boiled egg.  Guess this one's just not for us, but I'm glad I tried it.

Love this macaroni salad.  I leave out the carrot, onion, and pimento peppers.  I also add in a sprinkling of Season Salt and substitute green pepper for red.  Delicious!  Best macaroni salad recipe I have found yet!

Made this for a bbq and my boyfriend said it was the best macaroni salad he's ever had.  It was devoured.  I followed the recommendations to reduce the sugar to 1/3 c, and added a bit more mayo.  I also left out the green pepper for some picky eaters, and everyone agreed they wouldn't want the pepper in there anyway.  Will definitely make this again and again.

This was delicious!  I can't get macaroni salad in England and hadn't thought of making my own.  It was very easy I will be making it again and again.  I added a hard boiled egg and left out the pimentos [didn't have them].    I added the recommended amount of sugar because I like a sweet macaroni salad, but it was waaay to sweet!  I ended up topping up with mayo to balance it out and it was good, but only gets 4 stars because I will only use 1/2 the sugar next time.

Way too sweet... I used closer to 1/3 cup of sugar and it was still too sweet. But it's a start; you can mess around with it and make it yours.

A hit!!! Been making it for the family for over a year now. They love. Made it for my husband's office pot luck and everyone was requesting the recipe!!   Let the sauce blend overnight for flavours to flow through. Mix with pasta right before serving for a really creamy salad.

I made this yesterday for a family BBQ and it was SOOOOOO delicious! EVERYONE raved about it and my boyfriend even said it was the only macaroni salad he's had that was better than his mothers! He wanted to know why I had been holding out on him! This dish has been chosen as mine to bring to all family gatherings now!

Very good. Rated 4 not 5 since I'm not a big mac salad fan, but my husband is. Usually too sweet for me, so thought I'd take a chance on this recipe. Decided to use 1/2 sugar called for and taste- was still too sweet for me as I prefer savory pasta salad in general so decided to add some dried dill and extra salt so that did it for we. Great way to get more veggies into kids though. Thanks for a great recipe. PS- hubby and kids liked it too!

This is my first review.  This has become a weekly staple in my house.  My husband raves about it and although he will never eat leftovers, he eats this until it is gone then asks when I'm making it again.  I make it exactly as written and I whole wheat macaroni.  I highly recommend adding the carrots, it gives extra crunch, flavor and color.

Very good! I will probably cut back the sugar a bit as it was a tad sweet for me. However, I loved that it didn't taste like potato salad (I know weird right?!) which I have found alot of other recipes to be.

Superb! We just finished a yummy dinner. Served this macaroni salad with roasted chicken and biscuits. I decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup and mustard to 2 tbsp. Had no bell pepper on hand, but did add the shredded carrots. My kids said this was the best macaroni salad I've ever made :) I love compliments!

We found this quite tasty. We eliminated the red peppers and mad a smaller quantity. The dressing for this salad is also quite good on cole slaw.

This is a good sweet macaroni salad. I used whole wheat elbows and splenda instead of sugar. Next time I will try it without the sugar, just to see if it's better. I didn't use the bell pepper either.

WOW omg I just made this now and it is absolutely wonderful I never made home made macaroni salad before and thought I'd try my own instead of buying so I could limit my salt as I do low sodium but I made it to a T and added just a little relish and wow this is amazingly delicious I'm having it tomorrow so I know the flavors will sit overnight in the fridge better then I"ll add the boiled eggs on top and maybe some paprika like my uncle does but thank you ever so much I will make this from now on as I just love macaroni salad I think I"ll serve it with pulled pork tomorrow thank you again ever so much now if only I can stay out of it till tomorrow LOL...

AWESOME! Was looking for a mac salad to accompany a dish modeled after a famous local eatery--a deep-fried half chicken liberally doused in the restaurant's signature "Sassy Sauce"--the "bird" is placed atop two slices of white bread, with mac salad on the side to cool off your taste buds off between bites.  This mac salad was not too mayonaiss-y... it was tart yet sweet; perfect.  Would not change a thing (except next time I will maybe add more celery and/or red bell pepper!)  It was great combined with the "birds" but would be a super side dish with any picnic-style fare.  It lives up to its name:  CLASSIC...

Great! I was out of elbow macaroni and used spaghetti pasta instead. It was still good. I served them on crackers.

I didn't have elbow macaroni so I used egg noodles. It was soooooooo YUMMY!!!!  I think if I'd had the macaroni it would have been even better! I took it to a pot luck and it got all snarffed up!

This is simply the BEST macaroni salad I have ever had!  My husband and I usually don't like macaroni salad because they usually have too much mayo.  I love the flavor the mustard and vinegar added to the recipe.  It received rave reviews even from my little picky eaters!

Absolutely love this recipe. Followed it exactly as written. It don't taste like mayonnaise like a lot of salads do. I have had requests for this and have given out several copies of the recipe.

An easy to make salad which suites most people's taste! Our family isnt too fond of vinegar so to thin the mayonnaise I used milk. I added less sugar and hence got a nice creamy salad without the harsh vinegar taste. Great recipe!

This salad is great! I just finished making this a few minutes ago and I tasted it before putting it in the ref. I'm bringing this to my son's Christmas Potluck at his preschool tom am. I added 2TBS pickle relish and cut the sugar in half. I also put in all the optionals. It was very tasty. I love that it has color and "hidden veggies" for my picky eaters!   Thanks for sharing JMOR777!!!!

This is exactly like the macaroni salad that I had as a child.  The only thing different is that I added approximately 1 cup of 1/4" cubed American or Cheddar cheese.  This recipe is absolutely outstanding!!!!

I made this recipe just as directed except that I didn't have celery so I used some celery seed for the celery flavor.  This was fast and easy to prepare - the hardest thing was waiting four hours to eat it!  Simply wonderful! This will become a staple in my house!

I followed this recipe pretty much to the letter except used a lower-fat mayo and I doubled the recipe for a party. This salad has an interesting flavor but was too sweet for our tsste, and mine turned out a bit soupy.

This was good but really sweet...I will cut the sugar next time. Used this dressing and added all the veggies we like, frozen peas, sweet relish, red bell pepper, grated carrot, celery and red onion. Very nice, Thank you for posting. I will make this again.

The base sauce for this recipe is perfect.  You can add or omit items as your family prefers.  I do not add onion as most of my kids do not care for them.  But, this recipe is great even so.

I made this for a cookout and got some good reviews.  But for me it was just too sweet and way too much ingredients.  If I make it again I'll reduce the ingredients and add the sugar by taste.  I am giving this 3 stars because my boyfriend and some in his family really liked it

Got lots of compliments on this macaroni salad and will definitely make again. I left out the carrots. Also, if you don't like the taste of vinegar, you might want to decrease the amount called for by the recipe. The vinegar taste was a bit strong. This is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.

I read reviews before making and changed from 2/3 to 1/4 cup sugar. Since I don't like peppers these were eliminated, also added 4 boiled eggs.

This is an excellent variation to macaroni salad, especially for those that like a bit of zing.  I'm not a big fan of jalapenos, but I have to say this is by far my new favorite macaroni salad.  It was not too hot, just right.  Keep in mind, that I DID remove the seeds from the jalapenos.  My husband, on the other hand, is a huge fan of hot sauce, peppers, etc.  Even though this was not over-the-edge hot, he enjoyed it as well.  Great recipe!

This was THE best recipe.  I made some changes since I did not have everything exact.  I used rice vinegar instead of what was called for since that's what I had on hand. I also used roasted red peppers from a jar verses the green peppers and I added celery seed since I did not have celery.  It was great.  I just mixed everything to taste rather than exactly what the recipe called for.  It was great tasting, especially the next day.  We finished the entire dish instead of having leftovers left in the fridge.  My husband loved it.  It was a hit and I will keep that in the box for future reference.

I served this recently at a party. Everyone loved it and said it was unlike the mundane macaroni salad in which you just use mayonaise. Many people asked for the receipe and to have some to take home. My cudos to you. Perhaps it could have been a little less sweet -- only negative comment.

At first I thought the dressing was too sweet, but once the onions, celery, and bell pepper got mixed in, the flavors came out and mellowed out the sweetness.  It tasted GREAT and was just what I was looking for!!  I added peas and chunks of jack cheese...

I wasn't sure what to rate this one because I didn't really like it.  I was looking for more of a gourmet macaroni salad recipe and this tasted exactly like any macaroni salad you buy pre-made.  If you like those kind - you'll love this.  If you want something more gourmet - this isn't for you.  I should add too that I halfed the vinegar and it was still WAY too vinegary for me.

i cut the sugar down to about 1/2 that was called for and it was still very sweet.  definately would not use the whole amount.  my dressing was quite runny too.  i added extra macaroni and it was still a bit runny.  i also added a few hard boiled eggs.  the taste was pretty  good.  sweet and tangy.

This was pretty good.  Very creamy.  My first thought though is that it tastes like a potato salad rather than macaroni salad.  I would definitely recommend letting it sit overnight as it was much better the next day.  It really needed time to firm up.  When I first made it, I thought it was too runny but the next day it had the consistency of macaroni salad.

Great recipe, very easy to make. I had left over elbows from another recipe, so I halved this. Used Bermuda onion for nice color effect.  Must use much less sugar! I used about 3 Tbsp (for 1/2 the amount). Could've used only 1 Tbsp.  It's still a keeper!

I thought this was very good, but my family agreed it was a little on the sweet side.  Will definitely make it again, but will reduce the sugar.

Pretty good- I think next time I would tone down the mustard & onion. I halved this recipe & used sliced carrots. (no pimiento- yuck!)
