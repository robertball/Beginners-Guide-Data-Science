This is actually a Manhattan Clam Chowder recipe, not Rhode Island as the title indicates.  Living adjacent to Rhode Island, RI clam chowder is actually a clear broth...sort of like Manhattan without the tomatoes.

This is like a recipe that my mom taught me to use up leftovers from a clambake . I use V 8 or Clamato Juice and the water that the clams were steamed in . Made from scratch , it does go good on a cold wet day with a grilled cheese sandwhich .

Just tasted like clams in tomato juice.  I tried to save the dish and spice it up but nothing really helped.  I will stick with my cream based clam chowder.  I just wanted to try this because of less fat.

Yum...  This was great and very easy.  I much prefer Red clam chowder over it's white counterpart.  It's much healthier for you, too!!!  I added a pinch of basil and oregano to mine for a little italian flair.  If you're used to white, and have never had red clam chowder, it isn't really fair to compare the two.  They are 2 different animals completely.  5 Stars!

This recipe was fantastic. I swapped half of the carrots for celeryâ€”which I recommend to all. 
I'd like to take issue with the few negative reviews. I grew up in RI (1957) and have had red chowder, just like this, all of my life. I had done some research and the red, tomato-based chowder is traced to RI's Portuguese immigrants, who came with tomato-based soups. New Englanders called it "Manhattan" chowder as a derisive term, because it was not clear or white. But RI red chowder was always a fixture at George's in Galilee and at Iggy's and I wouldn't eat a clam cake without some!

Actually, in addition to the clear chowder served in Rhode Island, there is indeed a tomato-based chowder that has long been a RI tradition/favorite -- what we call "Rocky Point Clam Chowder." Even though Rocky Point chowder has a tomato base, it's definitely not "Manhattan,"  it's 100% Rhode Island. This recipe is something of a version of that. It's not a bad chowder at all, but I just can't help comparing it to the real Rocky Point chowder I grew up with.

Ok so this is an ok version of Mahatten chowder.  RI chowder is a clear chowder, using chicken broth and clams and spices...Not sure where the name came from, but it is an ok recipe all in the same...

I submitted this recipe about 10 years ago.  I continue to make it often.  I live a weak stone's throw from the RI border.  Forgive me for not knowing that RI's chowder is clear, as I have never had it.  I just assumed that the red was yours because every eatery, from the City to all along the coast, offers either red or white.  This recipe is a quick and easy fix for the red.  The tomato soup and sauce in the recipe is not the major player. It's the 46-oz can of clam juice, which is not always easy to find.  Add just enough tomato sauce for color.  Thanks JimD for your review.  I have the same memories of the Shore Dinner Hall.

Loved this. I think it is very close to Rocky Point's Clam Chowder, Does anyone out there have a 'from scratch' recipe for the "Clam Cakes" that go with it? I sure do miss the Rocky Point Dinner Hall, there is nothing like it.

Almost spot on.  My mom's RI Clam Chowder, (mostly from memory and Rocky Point Dinner Hall, mmm, can smell it now)!  My mom always used 6 large Quahogs that she steamed and strained the broth with cheesecloth.  She also added a can of chopped clams with liquid. She added minced celery, about two stalks minced, and two or three good shakes of celery seed to the end product.  She did not add tomato sauce, just the tomato soup and used the hot broth to clean out the can and add to the broth.  All the other ingredients in the base is really good.  This is as good as it gets to Rocky Point Chowder!!!

My mom made RI clam chowder very similar to this but only with onions and potatoes.  She added about 1/2 can of tomato soup for color only.  It did not alter the flavor of the fresh clams dug up by my dad.  I miss Rocky Point chowder now that I live in TX.  Enjoyed all your comments!

People writing that this is Manhattan clam chowder are 100% incorrect. Yes, Rhode Island is known for the clear broth clam chowder, however there is also Rhode Island Red Clam Chowder. It is tomato based with potatoes, but no other veggies. Manhattan has other veggies like carrots, this does not.  As others have stated, Rhode Island Red is typically served with clam cakes, and can be made with leftovers from a beach clam bake. This recipe should probably be re-labeled as it includes carrots so it is not traditional Rhode Island Red.

Great recipe!  My guy is from Rhode Island, and he loves this chowdah.  I added some red pepper flakes, garlic, and black pepper to spice it up a bit. Since I had some fresh parsley, I chopped it up and added it with the clams.  This will be a dish I make regularly in the winter.  Thanks for posting!  Now all we need is for someone to post the recipe for Rhode Island Clam Cakes!
