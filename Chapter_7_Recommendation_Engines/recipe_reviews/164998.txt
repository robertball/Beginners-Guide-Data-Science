This was delicious! It was the favorite dish at my family's Thanksgiving! I did change a few things though. I only used one egg, extra cheese, and extra Ritz crackers to mix into the casserole as well as top. I did this because I had read in previous reviews that it was runny. I also used two, large, fresh broccoli crowns instead of frozen.  It was so delicious and not runny at all! EVERYONE raved about it and it was the only dish that was completely gone.

This is a wonderful way to turn healthy veggies into a naughty treat! Love this recipe and had to control myself from eating half of it for dinner! I did change it up a bit. I used 2 16oz packages of broccoli & cauliflower blend since that is what I had on hand. I used cream of celery soup since I don't like cream of mushroom and I also omitted the onion since I don't like onion. I forgot to add the eggs, but it didn't need them. I made this years ago for a holiday dinner and everyone loved it. I would definately eat this over green bean casserole!  ** I made this a second time as the recipe stated and I would definately suggest leaving out the eggs! It had a weird scrambled egg consistency and I much preferred the casserole without the eggs.

I made this last night following the recipe exactly except I used fresh broccoli; my husband and I both loved the flavor but it was a bit too juicy. Next time, I'll add some bread crumbs to the mixture to soak up some of the wet ingredients and possibly some cooked chicken or turkey to make a one-dish meal. Very tasty dish!!!

Following advice from other reviewers, I used 1 egg instead of 2, 5 tablespoons of butter instead of 8, and added extra cheese (about 1 1/2 cups instead of 1).  I crushed up one sleeve of Ritz crackers, mixed about 1/4 cup into the casserole (to thicken as others said it can be a bit soupy), and spread the remaining ~3/4 cup over the top.  I used a 9x13 casserole dish and cooked it for 40 minutes at 350 (to soften the onions - they were still a little crunchy after 30 minutes).  It was delicious and it got great reviews from my family (young and old)!!  I think I will try this again as the recipe is written (only 1/2 stick of butter though - 1 just seems like too much!) - will update my review if I do.

I left out the eggs based on the other reviews and it was what I was aiming for.  The onion was still kind of crunchy so next time I would pre-cook that before throwing everything together.  We prefer our veggies a little softer, so I might cook it longer or find another method to soften them up first before baking.

This recipe was really easy to throw together with ingredients that I already had on hand. It was very creamy and tasted great. I loved the Ritz on top - gave it a nice crust. I made a 9 x 13 pan, but if you had a smaller crowd, you could easily split into two 8 x 8 pans and freeze one for a later time. My toddler coulnd't get enough of this great casserole!

Love it! It has been a family and church favorite for quite some time and have the recipe memorized I make is so much!  The only thing I change is omiting the butter, don't think it really needs it with the cheese. Even people that don't like broccoli eat this!! Also, I cook the brocolli and drain when I mix with all the ingredients and it always turns out perfect!

This was great!!! I would suggest do not add the butter. I thought, well I will put 1/4 cup and am now regretting it because after reheating it gets greasy. I can't imagine 1/2 cup. Also I pretty well followed the recipe with some of the added suggestions and it turned out nice. Instead of the Ritz on top I mixed in with the casserole and added French's Fried Onions and extra cheese in the last 10-15 minutes of baking. I will definitely use this recipe again.

We found this dish too moist for our taste. We did like the crackers on top.  I will try the recipie again, however, I will adjust the wet ingredients and I will use fresh chopped boccoli.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a big success.  I did make some modifications however.  I used 1/2c mayo and 1/2c sour cream, and added an extra 1/2c of shredded Jarlsburg.  Also, to those of you who found the casserole to be runny, make sure to thoroughly drain the thawed broccoli before mixing.  I REALLY use the back of a spoon to press the water out of the broccoli when it is draining in the sieve.  Also, the recipe DOES call for 1C cream of mushroom soup, not one can.  Maybe that makes the difference  between a runny consistency or not.  I did use the 1C soup, and didn't have the problem of it being too runny (I also only used 1 egg per the other reviewers suggestions and it turned out fine.)  

Tonight for dinner I am going to make this again, using a mix of frozen broccoli and cauliflower, and throw some leftover turkey in it to make it a main dish.  My husband is requesting it, and it really is that good.  Thank you, Rach :0

Very good!  It probably only needs 1 egg instead of two.

Allrecipes sent me a different broccoli casserole recipe in my email. I wanted to check out other recipes because I had never heard of a broccoli casserole before. I came upon this one which looked much easier with half the ingredients, and decided to try.
I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could, SO GOOD!!! The modifications I made: Fresh Broccoli, saute onion, no eggs, 2/3c light mayo and 1/3c light sour cream. I also mixed some of the crackers in with everything.

This recipe has been in my family forever.  My Mother got this from one of her ladies clubs.  She`s been dead a while now, but we children and  grandchildren still use this wonderful recipe.  It is the first time I have seen it on line!  We have to double it because you can`t get enough.  We do not use mayo in our family, we use Miracle Whip.  It adds a tang that mayo just can`t give.  It was really kind of Rach to share this with everyone.

I made this recipe but realized at the last minute that I was out of broccoli. I steamed a head of cauliflower instead, and I was thrilled with the result! I'll use the recipe for either broccoli or cauliflower in the future!

I think the concept is fantastic! I did agree with people here the eggs were not necessary. Since mayo is made with eggs, I just used a cup and a half of garlic aioli (instead of plain mayo for extra flavor) and it did the same job with more flavor! My husband isn't a huge fan of lots of onions so I used half an onion. My attempt to make this slightly more healthy was by using 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup.  Let's just say once these changes were made....it did NOT stay in the house for long! It was gobbled up very fast!

I made this but didn't have "Ritz" crackers so I used a bread crumb/ butter topping & omitted the 1/4 cup butter the recipe called for. Reduced the recipe down to 4 servings & it turned out GREAT! Also used a cheese sauce instead of shredded cheddar because cheddar gets "oily" & separates when it melts unless it has a starch to soak up the oil...Thx 4 sharing =)

This casserole is great! I have been making it for years (with a couple of exceptions).  I use sour cream instead of mayo and added a can of sliced mushrooms.  It is perfectly cheesy and not dry at all.  When I don't have the buttery crackers I substitute saltines - just as good.  My kids love it! My grandkids love it! My mother-in-law loves it!

Made this as side dish for Christmas, and was well received.  I did reduce egg to 1 and increased cheese by 1/2 cup and added some extra crushed crackers mixed into the casserole.  Will make again.

This is pretty much identical to Paula Deen's recipe! It's delicious but the butter should be melted and poured over too the crushed ritz crackers before baking, I think that's why people didn't like how much butter was recommended because this recipe has you mix in the butter. If you make this recipe as is and just pour the 1/2 cup melted butter over top the ritz crackers it's perfect!

I thought if was overall good, I just felt it needed a little less butter and a little more salt. Just a little too oily for me.

I made this for our New Years dinner. The flavor and consistency was great but I could still taste the mayo in it so next time I think I will add 1/2 cup of mayo instead of 1 cup. I also used regular saltine crackers instead of the buttery kind. My girls usually love this casserole when my SIL makes it but they did not care to much for this one.

This is a quick and easy broccoli casserole recipe with good flavor. I made a smaller version since I'm single and didn't want to waste a lot of ingredients in case it didn't turn out well.
A few things: 
The veggies were a little too crunchy, the onions still kind of raw. I was able to cook the casserole a bit longer at a low temp. Next time, I will probably cook the broccoli and onions before mixing them for the casserole. Also, though it may be understood, you must add a bit of salt to the mix, otherwise it will be bland. 
Overall, I was satisfied with it.

I have been making this for 40 years.  I now use cream of celery soup since some of my grandchildren can't eat mushrooms.  I think it may even be. Enter with the cream of celery.  I have also used cream of broccoli but we like the cream of celery. Enter.

I have been making this for many many years....only one egg, skip the butter.   Top with more cheese, then the crackers and press down on the top of the mixture.  Makes the top crunchy....

I love this exactly as is. I have played with it at times. My favorite alteration is to add a can of cheddar cheese soup and use 30 oz of broccoli and only use a half cup of mayo.

Its Easy and very tasty. I use different types of cheese such as Swiss and omit the butter all together.

I got this recipe from my Mother-in-law and have been making it for years.  It is extremely close to ours, the only differences are that we use the boxes of frozen "chopped" broccoli instead of broccoli cuts,(which is what most of the pictures show), you don't end up with big chunks of broccoli.  We also only use 1 Tbsp of grated onion and we use crushed cheese cracks like cheeze its or nips.  Not that this recipe isn't wonderful but this makes or casserole extra special.

This was liquidy, overwhelmingly oniony (and I only used half an onion), and very disappointing overall. I've enjoyed several casseroles on this site, but this one needs a lot of help.

I didn't have frozen broc. but had a head and a half of fresh to use up. Steamed broccoli about 4 mins then mixed in half the soup mixture. Baked about 25 mins and turned out awesome! I'll use double broc. next time to make the full batch! Hubby loved it.

I omit butter and it turns out just fine.  Also for a change you can use 2 cups croutons instead of crackers.  Sometimes I add mushrooms to it also.  Always a hit a holiday celebrations.

I have been making this recipe for about ten years now. I have no idea where my mother got it from. However instead of Ritz i use Bisquick. You make the crumble out of the butter and Bisquick. Its AMAZING! I use the same crumble on top of home made mac and cheese. Always a great side dish at any event.

I used fresh steamed broccoli, sauteed mushrooms with EVO, garlic, thyme, oregano and margarine. Attitude dash of Worcester sauce, a splash of chicken broth, tightened it up with double strength cream instead of using cream of mushroom soup. We do not use onions, so I added about two cups of sharp cheddar a quarter cup of Parmesan along with the rest of the ingredients listed and baked it off in the oven at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes, turned out perfect. I have also mixed this with leftover quinoa before baking, excellent.

I made this as described, but cut back to an egg and a half, and added more broccoli.  Although I gave it extra baking time,  it still came out runny.  It just has too much in it which overwhelms the broccoli - a whole cup of mayonnaise and a stick of butter?  All I could taste was mayonnaise, and the whole thing was just too rich.  A  casserole like this should complement the flavor of the veggie, not drown it!

Delicious!  My whole family loved this recipe.  The only adjustment I made was to use 2 large crowns of slightly steamed fresh broccoli florets.  The only mistake I made was not doubling the recipe to accommodate the second helpings!

I have had a hard time finding a broccoli casserole that I liked. Well not any more. I first made this as written, only fair way to do. I made a couple of changes 1/2 cup fat free sour cream and 1/2 cup mayo. My husband cannot eat raw or partly cooked onions so I cooked those with my fresh broccoli. Family loved it. Will make this over and over.

I am not a broccoli lover but this wasn't bad. It wasn't what I expected, it was fluffy and eggy ( almost quiche like and I was expecting it to be looser)...I used cream of celery soup and subbed half sour cream for the mayo. It still had a pretty strong mayo taste- even more so when it cooled. If you like the taste of broccoli and mayo this would be great for you.

Delicious casserole.  We used only one egg, added 1/2 tsp salt, and baked for 10 minutes longer because we like our vegetables softer (we used 3 small/medium heads of fresh broccoli).  We also sauteed the onions before adding to the casserole.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is the same recipe that I've been making for the last 12 years, I've made it for the last couple thanksgivings and my wife and kids love it!  the only think that I do different is i butter bread crumbs for the toping and mix a little in to make it more solid, and use 1 3/4 cups of cheese and omit the added butter.  Excellent recipe!!!

2 things that are not correct. You must COOK the broccoli first (that was not indicated), and the BUTTER is for melting and sprinkling over crushed crackers (it does NOT brown correctly if you don’t do this).

This was so good!  The only change I made was I omitted the eggs.  I don’t feel like it would add anything to the dish and was amazing with out it.

I have been making this same recipe for more than 30 years.  I had planned to make it Thanksgiving Day.  I always keep cream of mushroom and cream of chicken in my pantry.  Oooops.  I had no cream of mushroom.  All the stores were closed but that did not matter.  I had just suffered a heart attack earlier in the week and I did not need to be out anyway.  My children and grandchildren were coming.  This is their favorite.  I had an idea:  I would use cream of chicken with herbs (the first can of soup I picked up).  It was the BEST this casserole dish has been in the 30+ years I have been making it.  Everyone agreed that although they thought it could get no better than before, it had surpassed even the best years.

Made this a few nights ago. The recipe is good but a couple of things I’ll be doing different next time. Using the full onion was too much. I would only use about half of the onion instead. Also there was too much mayo.

Excellent dish. I omitted the onions because I don't like them in casseroles. Next time I make this casserole, I will skip the butter as the cheese and Ritz crackers made up for the loss.  Also I didn't notice that the recipe  calls for 1 CUP of the soup, NOT one can - oops! I used the entire can and still got great results. This dish is really good, will definitely make it again.

I am not an onion fan, I may add onion power next time but it was great. Also, blend the broccoli so it will have a smoother taste.

I have made this many times, and it's great.  When I don't have enough broccoli, I add other veggies to make up the difference, like zucchini, yellow squash, peas and/or corn.  I also blanch my veggies for faster cook time.

I read the recipes about it being to runny or watery. The changes I made were...i added two large chicken breasts and an extra 3/4 cheese. I mixed fresh broccoli and cauliflower that I steamed.  I used a small can of cream of mushroom  and half cup mayo and half cup sour cream. I used the butter to brown the onions, then steamed the broccoli and cauliflower. Once the onions, broccoli and cauliflower were al dente, I threw them in a salad spinner. It definitely helped. Also using both eggs bonded everything together in a 13x9 pan. Before putting in the oven I topped it with 1/2 cup shredded cheese, sprinkled with grated Parmesan cheese, and those crispy fried onions. Broil it right before taking it out of the oven. Then let it sit for five minutes. Wasn't runny at all :-)

I had to make a few changes to what I had on hand, and due to this I gave it a 4.
I had only 1 head of fresh broccoli, so I substituted one cup of rice in with the ingredients. (did not cook the rice before hand) 
I noticed someone said the onion tasted pretty raw, so with the butter I sauteed the onions. 
When I do make this recipe again, I will either double the cheese or do 1/2 Velveeta and 1/2 cheddar in hopes to get that cheesy goodness I was hoping for and remembered from when my aunt used to make this at Thanksgiving!

I made this instead of my usual (bland) broccoli casserole for Thanksgiving and it was not only easier to make, but far more delicious!! I made it exactly as written, and the onion provides the zip that everyone enjoyed so much. Don't miss out on a simple and delicious dish!

I changed this, but I want to save my changes.  I used a mix of fresh broccoli and cauliflower, and cooked them to crisp tender.  I mixed together a can of cream of chicken, 1/2 cup mayo and 2 cups shredded cheese, then mixed with the veggies.  Covered the top with a cup of crushed croutons.  Baked covered at 350 for 1/2 hour, then uncovered for 15 minutes more.  Delish, my company loved it.

Loved this recipe. My changes...I used fresh broccoli which I blanched first. I also added diced ham and a can of diced, cooked potatoes. I also didn't have any Ritz crackers and I used some sauteed panko bread crumbs on top. It came out great! I was really surprised just how good this recipe came out!

I made this casserole for a pot-luck last night and it was devoured quickly.  It has a great flavor your guests will love.  I added about a dozen crushed crackers to the casserole itself and I'm glad I did.  The texture was perfect.

I have been experimenting with different recipies for this dish, most have flopped with my family. The ingredients in your recipe come closest to what I have been looking for. The only problem I had was I had to use cut broccoli, the store was out of chopped broccoli. I should have chopped it up because the broccoli was not tender. Also, I used sharp chedder cheese and chunks of Velvetta. Next time I will try 1/2 cup of mayo instead of 1 cup. The flavor was wonderful, only the broccoli was hard.

This is the favorite recipes we have used for years in our family.  It is a favorite at a family meal or a formal Thanksgiving/Christmas feast.  It is probably my favorite way of having broccoli!  Yum!
