The bean pods of the mesquite can be dried and ground into flour, adding a sweet, nutty taste to breads, or used to make jelly or wine.  When used in baking, the mesquite bean flour is used in combination with other flours – substitute ¼ cup-to-½ cup mesquite flour for each cup grain flour. Mesquite bean flour is used in breads, pancakes, muffins, cakes and even cookies.  Usually found in TX cooking.

My family loved these cookies once I tweaked it a little.  I made a batch exactly as the recipe says, and they are pretty good.  Then I tried adding different combinations of nuts, coconut, dried fruits, etc.  The favorites by far were the ones with chopped pecans, flaked coconut, and dried cranberries.  I also made a batch with white chocolate chips (all I had on hand), coconut, and chopped walnuts that were very tasty, and another with just coconut and slivered almonds.  Everything I made got eaten, but we definitely think they're better with a few add-ins of your choice!

I've never used mesquite flour, so didn't know what to expect.  I'm definitely not a fan, but can't blame the recipe.  I think I just don't like the taste of mesquite.  The cookies had a definite bean aftertaste that was very odd.  I brought these to work, and everyone (jokingly) accused me of bringing pot cookies. :)  They weren't bad, but just left a really weird aftertaste.  Most of the cookies got tossed.  Interesting experiment, though!
