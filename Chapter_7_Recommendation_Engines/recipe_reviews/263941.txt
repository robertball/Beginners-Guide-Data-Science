I just got done eating what I made.  I also uploaded a photo, if it didn't go through I'll try it again.  So yeah, this is pretty darn delicious and so much neater than making actual buffalo wings, which I love.  I made this to plan on taking it to work with me during the week.  It's gonna work out great! ......The only thing I changed was that I used both breasts of a small  rotisserie chicken instead of raw meat.  I just shredded it and put it in at the end.  Everything else I did pretty much to the letter.  It's GREAT.  I like spicy food but I really enjoyed this more with juuuust a bit more bleu cheese dressing on top.  I used a top quality blue cheese dressing and that seemed sort of important...it was creamier than lesser brands.  o, in all, it was just GREAT and I'd definitely make it again.  Thanks for combining two of my favorite foods, Sandman!
