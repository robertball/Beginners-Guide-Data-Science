I almost bypassed this recipe, since, generally, I make cookies "from scratch."  I am SO glad that I tried out this recipe!  It was suprisingly good, and, though I did not use the banana in the recipe; instead I rolled the cookies into sifted powdered sugar before placing them on the baking sheet, and let them cool-they were so soft and tender.  I made a home-made strawberry frosting and put that on the flat side of the cookie and made "sandwich" cookies out of them.  What a treat!

My husband wanted Strawberry cookies.  This recipe was quick and easy, but we did not use the bananas.  Cookies tasted good, very sweet, but I could not get them to cook all the way through without burning.  Looks like you may need to experiment a little, but have lots of different ways to try.

These cookies were great! I was so surprised at how fast the banana flavor worked its way into the cookies. I will surely be making these again. They are simple and sooooooooo soft and yummy!

Did these without banana & rolled in confectioners sugar before I baked (found on another recipe), and they looked so pretty! Tasted wonderful! Will do this again with different cake mixes as I need to use them. Thanks!

This recipe is not only super easy, but super delicious!  I've taken them to every xmas party this year since they are such a hit!  I've even tried adding pureed banana to them, which also tastes great.  I wasn't successful in getting the banana to infuse by placing it in the container with the cookies.

I put the banana right into the mix because it was really soft. I didn't taste banana but I will try again following the instructions next time. I also use applesauce instead of oil.

I used the 15-oz package of cake mix.  Added 1 tsp. of baking powder.  I let the batter sit about 15 minutes before handling it.  Rolled into tsp. -size balls and rolled in powdered sugar BEFORE baking.  Baked mine for a little longer than directed - but that could just be my oven.  Didn't do the banana in the container thing - but will try it next time.  Came out pretty good - for what they are!  Will use this recipe again!

very good! great to make with kids. I used 1 1/2 bananas instead of 1 so I did not have to shove a banana in my cookie jar like the recipe called for. I would like to try them with chocolate chips for a banana split cookie!
