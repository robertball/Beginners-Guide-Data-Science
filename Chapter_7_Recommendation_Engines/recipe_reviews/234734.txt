I have a different twist on this one. After boiling and cooling the eggs, roll them on the counter to crack the shell all over but do not peel, return the eggs to the cold water with just the tea and soy sauce in the water. Let them soak over night, then peal the eggs. You will be delighted with wonderful individual patterns on each egg.

These were great! I followed the recipe for the marbling of the eggs, but made my families traditional deviled eggs! They were a hit! Love that there is no food coloring involved.

I make Martha Stewart'a version of this (3 cups Earl Grey or other strong tea + 1/4 cup soy sauce). After fully cooking the eggs, shock in an ice bath, then roll on the counter to lightly crack the shells. Submerge in the tea and soy sauce mixture, but do NOT cook again. 30 minutes cook time is way too long. Let sit 3 days in the fridge in the tea and soy bath. No need to fill. Serve with black sesame seeds and kosher salt. Easier, good flavor.

I did a trial run this morning with only 2 eggs, cause that is all I had....... and great recipe and technique.  I can not stop chuckling over the remark of disgusting looking........ lol.... that is the point for Halloween.  I will make these again soon...... after all it won't be long till Halloween and I am all for these cute recipes.  I also do Martha Stewarts "Bat Wings" and they are black and creepy and wonderful tasting and I don't care for chicken that much.

I missed the leave in water until cool for the color soaking, so my color was pale.  I didn't try the actual seasoning, I was just going for the look.  I read one review that soaked in cold colored water for 3 day in fridge, I liked that variation to try....
It definately worked, and was pretty cool.  Mine needed the extra time to finish darkening, but that was my fault.  One of them did come out fully dark, so I know it would have worked with the extra time.

All-in-all, this recipe worked pretty well... 

However, I feel like simmering them for 30min in that second round is a bit much.

I'd suggest using a butter knife to tap and crack the eggs. When I tried to roll the eggs - it created a few large cracks that resulted in an excess of the dying mixture leaking into the egg. One of my eggs had such a big crack from this method - enough liquid leaked in that the entire shell came off - dying the entire egg brown. 

Like other users have mentioned - this is mainly for aesthetics, as opposed to taste. The one egg that got soaked in the mixture did have a noticeable taste difference, however (IMO).

Also like another reviewer mentioned, I used my own deviled-egg recipe in place of the suggested one from above.

Check photos for my results.

These were a huge hit with my family at Halloween.  I'll definitely make them again, but wish I could find a way for the yolks not to turn green from all the heat.  Maybe not heat them up again but just soak them overnight in the darker liquid? I did not use the filling but my own filling since my family likes it.

Wow, just wow! One of the best dishes I've found on here. Definitely a lot of prep involved  (don't rush the freezing time!) but worth every second. Will make many times again!

Fun and easy.  I used the only tea I had, Chai tea, and soy sauce...that's it.  Sat for about 40 min. Orange pepper instead of red with paprika sprinkled on the inside.  I had lots of stuffing.  I'll be making it again and again experimenting each time.

It was a lot of work just to get eggs and salsa. Make for the looks not the taste.
