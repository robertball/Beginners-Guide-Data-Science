I followed the recipe, using all beef hot dogs and reduced fat crescent roll dough. The kids thought these were great!

The kids loved these and they are super easy to make!  A quick kid friendly dinner that they didn't complain about.

Pillsbury crescents are not sold where i live, so i had to get the recipe from somewhere else. The recope turned out great and i used mini hotdogs instead to give it a little bites look. Awesome!
