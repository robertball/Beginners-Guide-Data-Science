Well... I altered this some which I think enhanced the quality of the dog food. Any low fat meat would work here as well as fish such as tilapia. Beef and chicken livers work well too. If you cook a whole chicken in a pressure cooker to soften the bones you can puree that to use in the recipe as well, but no whole bones... or add bonemeal which is preferable anyway. As others mentioned... the sodium content is of concern. The garlic in moderation is Ok but that said... don't add it everytime you make this. Garlic is good for helping to control fleas but at the same time it can cause anemia in our little furry friends. Use brown rice and add vegetables like pumpkin (good source of fiber) carrots, peas, beans, etc. Also, add brewers yeast (not the same as active yeast)!! Oh... use olive oil. And I'm not sure what's up with the thyme... I can't say it's harmful, but until I find out for sure... better omit it. These are dogs afterall... not people!

although the basic recipe is pretty sound, I do agree with the other reviewer that the sodium content might be a bit high. Also, the garlic powder might not be a good idea. While it would be yummy in a human recipe, it's unnecessary--and actually toxic in high amounts for dogs.

Beef buillion can be very high in salt - I would suggest using a low-salt or no salt bullion, or homemade beef broth.

The  high sodium content is a concern. Homemade beef stock is much more flavorable...especially if you use soup bones with a heavy marrow content. Makes great stock for these receipes.

Doggy heaven.  The only change I made was to use low salt beef broth.  I know that raw garlic is a no-no, but garlic powder in moderation appears to be okay according to my research soooooo?...

The only reason would give this recipe 4 stars is because I don't think you need the seasoning -- garlic and thyme. The dogs however LOVED this and I didn't use the spice, including the bouillon. Too much salt isn't good for the dogs, and neither is garlic! Dogs love cheese, and the rice is definitely a filler and an extender. Nice job!!!

Since originally making this recipe, I have revised it, using only one beef cube.  This is for convenience, what many might have on hand, but we actually use 1 teaspoon Minor's All Natural Beef Base, which has 25% less sodium than a single cube.  Have also made this using the liquid after poaching chicken and the puppers adore it.  The 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder is reduced to 1/8 teaspoon, but not deleted.  Avoid fresh/raw garlic and onion for your pets as well as other toxins like grapes, chocolate and sugarless gum they might happen to get into.
