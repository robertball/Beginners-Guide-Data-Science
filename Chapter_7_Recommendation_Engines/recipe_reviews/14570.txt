Very tasty and flavorful. We didn't have a grill, so we made it in the oven (450 for 25 mins then 350 for 30-40 mins), and it was delicious that way, as well. Very tender and juicy. Good luck!

Cornish Game Hen tastes great with just salt, pepper, and olive oil, in the oven as well. It comes out surprisingly moist and juicy. This version was very garlic and herb flavored, and maybe because of the strong flavor, we couldn't eat as much of it whereas we usually eat a whole bird each when it's cornish game hens. I love garlic though, so I didn't think it would be too much at all. This dish came out tender and moist, (used an oven) but missed something in flavor...it was almost so rich, yet still missing something flavorwise. I think we like the plain old salt and pepper version better after all that work and excitement of sticking herbs under the skin. Definitely has a distinct flavor to it and worth trying. Next time I'd be curious to stick other things under the skin...like maybe barbeque sauce or something more traditional like that!

I changed a few things on this.  I marinated the hens overnight, and then rotissery grilled them (not cutting them in half)  I basted the marinade on the hens while they were cooking.  The flavor was incredible, and they came out moist and juicy.

I made this for my husband and I for Christmas dinner.  We loved it!!  The flavoring was subtle and wonderful after being grilled.  We did grill a little longer than called for, but it still turned out soft and juicy.  We will definitely have this again!!

I made this for our Christmas dinner, and it was fantastic! It was as beautiful as it was delicious. I served it with small red potatoes with the center peeled. My husband and three teenage daughters loved it. We live at a high elevation and so I'm not able to thoroughly cook chicken on a grill. I baked the cornish hens for 3 hours at 350. This is a definite keeper. It was much less time consuming than the usual turkey dinner. Thanks Richard for sharing your recipe!

Great flavor.  It was too cold to grill outside so roasted instead.  450 for 20 minutes then 40 mins at 350.  Too long but still tasted great.  Next time would try 20-30 at 350.

The flavor was good, we used an indoor grill which didn't do it justice.  Will try it again on an outdoor grill.

Made it without any changes.  It grilled nicely and was enjoyed by  all.  Fresh herbs , garlic  and wine made a delicious marinade.  Will fix it again.

This is a delicious recipe and I didn't change one thing.  I like the part where you have to lift the skin and rub the ingredients on the flesh.  I marinated for two days and grilled outside.  You hit this one on the nail Ricardo, thanks!
