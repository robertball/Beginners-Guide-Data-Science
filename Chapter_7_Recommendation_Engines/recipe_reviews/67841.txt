Wonderful! :)  It took me a little longer to cook it as I used an indoor grill, but by the time it was done my entire house smelled of it (oh - I loved it!).  It was great.  Everyone said only good things about it - I doubled the recipe because we had alot of people over and I had 2 people ask for it! :)

these were so yummy, and we didn't even use the dressing because we didn't have any on hand.  the kick from the garlic along with the sweet, tangy pineapple (which is so delicious warm & grilled!) is a wonderful combination.  we also marinated and grilled a few of the peppers.  served on big, honey wheat buns. super! everyone cleaned their plates!

Delicious.  Love the warm pineapple.  I used fresh pineapple and just rubbed the garlic/oregano on the slices before I grilled it.  Turned out great.  Thanks!

This recipe turned out really amazing but I did make a few changes.  First off, I marinated the chicken in a store-bought teriyaki marinade for about an hour, and then I drained it and used the pineapple juice and garlic (I didn't have oregano so I didn't use any) for the time specified in the recipe. Then I cooked it under the broiler, brushing it occasionally with the pineapple juice. I added the pineapples to the broiler according to the recipe. I didn't have ground red pepper so I used red pepper flakes in the thousand island dressing. Also, I used onion slices in place of the green pepper.  It was amazing! I'm going to make this all the time!
