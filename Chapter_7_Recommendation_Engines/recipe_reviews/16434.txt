This is an absolutely delicious salad and I am definitely going to make it again.  The combination of cilantro and jicama is wonderful.  I did change it a bit.  I used 2 pounds of calamari instead of one, partly because the bell peppers I used were huge.  I omitted the jalapeno pepper, but the next time I make this I may substitute a milder pepper, perhaps an anaheim.  I was not sure how big a bunch is--for the cilantro and parsley--so I used about three quarters cup of torn cilantro leaves and omitted the parsley.  Another reviewer mentioned that this does need some salt, But I like to leave that to the individual.

Very good recipe but I suggest changing a few things. Use 2 lbs calamari and add some salt to the boil. Next time I will not be using a full bunch of parsley. The flavor was way too overbearing. 1/2 bunch is more than enough. I added some lemon juice to the dressing and some extra salt. I will definitely be making this many more times.

while the final dish was very good, it came out more like "soup" than salad!  I used 4 lbs of calimari; only doubled your recipe, and there was way too much 'vinagrette.'

Delicious but it's a lot more work than the recipe implies.

I added more garlic, salt and pepper for added flavor.  Did not add the beans since I am not fond of them and it was delicious.  Definately would make again.

I followed the recipe and added lump crab meat which added flavor. received numerous compliments and only about a cup for leftovers. Definitely a winner!

The balance between the calamari and other ingredients needs adjustment.  If you choose the same amount of vegetables, increase the calamari 50 to 100%.  The taste is very good, it's just the balance that needs help.
