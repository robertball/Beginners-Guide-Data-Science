These muffins were just ok for me. The muffin was not very sweet. I would suggest adding an additional layer of brown sugar and cinnamon. I also topped mine with it.

Definitely awesome! I made a batch and they were gone in barely a day. It was demanded I make another and double the recipe.

Use allot of the cinnamon-sugar mixture. Also, don't add to much milk or they will become very thick! I always add a little bit more sugar too. ;). Still a good recipe.

Made a few changes based on some other reviews. I added brown sugar and cinnamon directly to the batter and put a layer of the sugar/cinnamon mix both in the middle and on top. I put small pieces of butter on top of each one before I through it in the oven. They look awesome and smell delicious! Still waiting on them to cool so I can taste them:)

I used a 9x9 pan and added a little nutmeg to the brown sugar and cinnamon. I also made layers. It tastes like a coffee cake and I love it.

These muffins were ok. They were not very sweet.  I would have added more sugar to the batter.  The recipe did not make 24.  I was lucky to get 15.  I would use butter instead of canola oil to complement the brown sugar. I would try these again, with the adjustments, but it may be easier to just find a better recipe.

I used mini muffins when I made mine and I added brown sugar, and walnuts into the batch as well as some water. I found my mixture was very thick. On the top I also added a walnut piece for each muffin. These are not very sweet but I don’t mind that, they are good for the morning.

Definitely could use more sweetness. Maybe even some vanilla or almond extract. What I do, since it is a “breakfast item”, is spread some butter in the middle and pour some maple syrup over them while they are warm. I’ll definitely be making these again, but maybe tweaking the recipe a little to my taste. If you prefer a mild sweet flavor these are perfect for you. I just have a major sweet tooth.

Family and I loved these. Added capful of vanilla and maybe 1/4 cup of brown sugar based on other reviewers saying not sweet enough. Also used self rising flour and omitted salt/soda/baking powder.  Rose beautifully fluffy and tasted delicious with cinnamon sugar topping.

The only thing I do differently is use organic coconut oil and it adds a little flavor to the muffin itself.  These are great to make ahead for busy mornings.

I made these according to the recipe and
they came out alright. My family enjoyed them and loved the little cinnamon concoction in the middle.
One thing I suggest to keep to the recipe at what it is but give it an extra boost is to take,
1. One quarter cup brown sugar
2. Two tablespoons of ground cinnamon
3. One quarter cup of butter
Mix and melt in a microwave for 45 sec. then drizzle over warm muffins. Hope this was helpful! :)

I just made these. My only change was to use almond milk instead of cows milk, due to allergies. I was very unimpressed. Bland. Too dense. If I made some of the changes mentioned in the comments, they may  be ok, but then it would be a different recipe because there were a LOT of changes mentioned. These won't be made again. The ones I already made will probably go uneaten, which is unheard of in my house with a 15 year old boy and his friends passing through my kitchen every day!
