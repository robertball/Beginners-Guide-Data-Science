A delicious dish that I modified slightly.  As I steamed cooked my squash, I made a mixture of the other ingredients by omitting the cheese and adding shredded fresh carrots and sweet, succulent pimentos.  I put a cup of the cornbread stuffing on the bottom of my 9x13 dish, added my squash mixture and then put another cup of the cornbread stuffing on top.  Baked in the oven at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes.  Whoooooooo, Buddy!  Boy howdy, did this turn out great!  My cat and I highly recommend that you use the cornbread stuffing over any other type of stuffing.  I think I need to hit up my brother for some more  fresh squash so I can make it again.

Excellent and easy!  I, too, added the about 4 oz of the 6 oz pouch of stuffing mix to the squash/onion mixture and it came out creamy good! The 2 oz of stuffing mixed with the cheddar cheese gave it a wonderful crunchy topping.  Highly recommended as a great alternative to potatoes for a side dish!

Very good recipe.  I have made it several times since finding it on AllRecipe.  The only thing I change is I mix half of the stuffing mix into the squash mixture and sprinkle the other half along with some shredded cheese on top of the casserole.  The stuffing mix gives the casserole a nice flavor.  I use cornbread or chicken stuffing.

In spite of achieving a full five star rating at this time, had moderate expectations about this dish thinking it might be bland given no added spices and few ingredients. We were very pleasantly surprised as it made a tasty, versatile side dish, and simple to pull together. We added the optional cheddar cheese but otherwise made as written. We will definitely make this again. Thank you MCOATES.

I have one very much like this one,  1 pkg. of Pepperidge Farm herb stuffing,  and use 1 lb. zucchini and 1 1/2 lbs. summer squash....cook the cubed squash & onions in boiling water with salt.  drain,  fold it into the soup & sour cream, (which has been mixed together.   Mix the bread crumbs with melted butter,  then layer half bread crumbs on bottom of 9 x 12 pan, then the squash mixture, then top with the rest of bread crumb mixture....I will try the cheese next time I make this, it is delicious....also think in summer to top it off with some fresh tomatoes under the cheese...YUM!!!!

I thought they were a little bland. And there was to much bread crumbs on top.  Next time I will season it more and use bread crumbs that are crushed and not put as much on top.

Yummy!  I used fat free sour cream and added about half the cheese and stuffing mix to the squash mixture and topped the casserole with the other half of each.  In addition, I didn't have cream of chicken soup so used cream of celery.  Will definitely make again!

This truly is fabulous. Smells and tastes like Thanksgiving! It's great as is, but I like to chop up 2-3 chicken breasts and mix that in for a more hearty meal.

My wife loves squash. This is similar to hotdish from my youth, without the ground beef. I shredded the cheese with the coarse blade of my food processor and set it aside. Then the summer squash (4 cups). Shredding the squash second makes cleaning the disk easier. I fried the onion first, because the shredded squash cooks quickly. I suspect most kids would think the shredded squash was pasta.

This truly is an UNBELIEVABLY good casserole.  Made it for my non squash loving family and they all gushed over how delicious it was.  Only change I made was to add some real crumbled bacon bits to the topping just because I had some and it sounded good.  I will definitley make this again.  It's the perfect side dish for a nice comforting meal.

So delicious! I used several types of squash, zucchini, patty pan, yellow crook neck.  I also used cornbread stuffing and put 1/2 the stuffing mix in the squash mixture, the remaining over the top, and baked it in my cast iron skillet. I will definitely make this again!

I use zucchini and yellow squash.  I shread the squash  and mix everything together.  Leave a little of the stuffing mix whole to crunch up smaller and sprinkle over the top before baking.  Very good recipe!

Yum! I loved this dish. I used butternut squash, a sweet potato, doubled the cheese and it turned out just perfect. Next time I will add more variety to the casserole (include some carrots, potatoes, and zucchini) and find better stuffing for the top. I used stove top due to time constraints for prep and noted that it had some bad ingredients that I try to steer clear of (high fructose corn syrup, hydrogenated oils, etc.) Other than that, this dish will be made many times over!

This is so delicious and easy to make.  Definitely will make it again.  I did alter the recipe a little.  In addition to the recipe I added diced carrots, 1 diced green bell pepper, sliced button mushrooms, salt, pepper, garlic powder.  In addition to cream of chicken soup I also added a can of cream of celery soup. I used jiffy brand corn bread, which I crumbled, so had a sweetness to it, which I loved. A dusting of mexican shredded cheese and garnished with diced tomatoes

This is one of my favorite ways to use the mountains of summer squash from the garden. I just saute the squash and onion in butter until tender and skip the water. I only use about 1/4 - 1/2 cup of the sour cream and skip the cheese. Although I do not make a habit of using canned cream soups or packaged stuffing mix I will cheat for this recipe! Delicious. Note: I have tasted this before using low sodium products and did not like it nearly as well.

Basically, Cream of Chicken(or any other cream) makes almost anything taste great. Pretty good recipe. I really liked it. Tasty way to serve up your squash! I didn't use any sour cream as I just didn't have it but I found the casserole rich enough without it. Added 2 cups of chopped carrots. I also took the advice to add half of the breaded stuffing in with the casserole. All of it on top would of been too much. This goes into it might make again category.

Love, love, love this casserole.
I only made a slight change on how I prepared it.
I cooked my onions first (I don’t like crunchy or firm onions) then I added my squash and cooked.  I cut my squash in chunks so they would be firm in the casserole.
I took this to Sunday supper and everyone love it.  They commented on how much they like the squash chunky and how tasty it is.  I was asked for the recipe.  It’s a keeper!

Great casserole. Made for the holidays and did as others and mixed about 2/3 of stuffing in the squash mixture and topped the rest.  Also added about 1 pound of diced carrots and it was amazing.  Going to make it again tonight and add some mushrooms as well.  I think it would also be good with some chicken.  It is a great base to add whatever you might like.

I made a few substitutions, such as cream cheese instead of sour cream and used cream of mushroom soup. I added 5 additional cheeses, chopped garlic, chives, 1 more egg, a bit of Carnation milk, red and yellow mini bell peppers, chicken pepper sausage, onion and mushrooms. I also followed the suggestions and used part of the stuffing in the squash mixture and the remainder on top with additional cheese.  The  stuffing and soup was gluten-free (because I can't eat it) and my gluten-loving family LOVED IT.

I *always* read the reviews before I make a recipe.  In this case I ended up shredding the squash in the food processor, and adding the (cornbread) stuffing mix to the squash mixture.  I then topped it with the shredded cheese and some bread crumbs,since I put all the stuffing mix in the casserole itself.  It was fabulous!  My husband just ate his second squash casserole meal of the day!

Everyone really enjoyed this and I think this may have been the highlight of dinner for DH he kept talking about it. I like others threw in some extra veggies some finely sliced carrots for color and a handful of frozen peas I that were lurking in the freezer. I also added the other half of the bag of stuffing mix to the veggie soup mix and used the optional cheese on the top. Really liked it and its versatility.

Wonderful! Had a bunch of squash and zucchini to use, and have a BF that barely eats veggies...sigh. Followed the recipe almost to a T. Added cream cheese to the sauce instead of sour cream. Worked out great! So good that it was his late night requested snack!

Excellent and easy.  I didn't have cream of chicken soup in the pantry, so I used cream of mushroom.  I also added fresh, sliced shitake mushrooms.

Love this recipe! It's a family favorite... we always add some grated carrot for color and flavor. Also we usually use half zucchini. I have made it with cream of celery and cream of mushroom as well for a little variety.

Awesome dish. I modified it by using ritz crackers instead of the stuffing mix. My mom doesn't care for squash but she sure loved this dish. Thanks

This was a delicious recipe! My only criticism is that it is a little vague in some areas for a non-cook like me. For example, it says to use 3 crookneck squash, but does not mention how much squash, exactly, that would be. I had one butternut squash, and was not sure what the relative size of a crookneck squash is to a butternut squash. I tried the recipe anyway, and it seemed to work well with one butternut squash. I also used half the sour cream, and a couple of tablespoons of cream cheese. I have tried this in a few recipes which call for sour cream, and I find it adds a nice sweetness without requiring much cream cheese at all. Everything else I did as suggested, and it was a hit! Because I did not mash the squash, but just mixed it well with the other ingredients, the casserole came out with almost a macaroni and cheese consistency. I highly recommend this recipe!

I was skeptical about making this for Thanksgiving, but at the last minute decided why not. I followed the recipe and did not add any cheese. It was delicious. I had no leftovers will definitely make this again.

Very tasty.  I didn’t have any sour cream but read some other reviews where it was omitted with good results so proceeded with making the dish.  Loved the flavor of the cornbread stuffing mixed in.  Probably would have been 5 star review if I had included the sour cream tho.  Without it, the dish came out a little dry.

Heavenly! Sautéed the zucchini, carrots and onions together. Used cream of celery soup as that was all I had....and Savory Herb Stove Top (full box!).  Will make this weekly for as long as the zucchini keep growing!

I am pleased with this recipe with one exception.   No water needed as squash sweats enough without it.  If somebody doesn't care for stuffing, then substitute a sleeve of Ritz crackers instead.

I make it with Ritz Crackers and also add them to the squash mixture...Much better.  Then make a ritz/cheese crumble for the topping and dot with butter.

I love this recipe, but I did make two changes. I used two squash and one small zucchini I needed to use. Also, the first time I made this I spread the stuffing on the top as directed in the recipe. Each time thereafter, I've added the stuffing to the entire mixture and we liked it so much better that way. This is one of my favorite recipes and each time I make it for friends, I'm asked for the recipe. Also, I really enjoy having leftovers cold for lunch. Try this one.

Delicious! The only modification I made was to salt & pepper the squash while it was cooking. I also keep my stuffing mix in a canister (there are only 2 of us and a whole box is too much to make at one time), so I just sprinkled it on top until it was the consistency I wanted, not sure how much it was, but know the whole box would've probably been too much.  I've made this a few times and even our pickiest friend who doesn't like squash or onions went back for seconds. Thanks for sharing!I

Update: I make this all the time now and have made a couple more modifications. I sprinkle the stuffing mix  on the bottom and sprinkle the top with French fried onions. So good!

I'll rate this a "5", because it is great just the way it is. I did make a few changes that are just personal preferences.

While I saute the onions, along with some garlic, I steam the sliced squash. And I include some green squash (zucchini) too. I don't always use any 'cream of' soup, but if I don't have it, I use a bit of lite mayonnaise.

I put about 3/4 of the stuffing in the casserole, then crush the rest and add some of the cheddar cheese....it's a nice topping.

I like the addition of grated carrots as others have mentioned.

Adding chicken makes it a great main dish, and when served with a salad, it's a hearty and comforting meal for a chilly fall or winter night

I followed the advice of others and added half of the stuffing mix to the squash mixture and put the rest on top. I also added some diced cooked chicken to this to make it a main dish casserole. Yummy way to use our abundance of fresh yellow summer squash. This is a keeper.

i made this but my advice is dont put the stuffing topping on until its almost done are the topping will burn before the squash gets done. also no need for the carrots.

I've been making this for years for Thanksgiving.  I  boil my squash with onions and salt and pepper until it is tender, but not falling apart. I omit the cheese and put in chopped water chestnuts, as well as the cream of chicken soup and sour cream. I put Pepperidge Farm herb dressing on the bottom and top.   My family loves it and looks forward to it.

This recipe was really good. I didn't have stuffing mix so I chopped up whole grain bread, tossed some seasonings and some extra virgin olive oil on and baked it for about 20 minutes. Then coated it with some melted butter before throwing it on top of the casserole to bake. Yummy

Holy smoke. I am in no way a master chef. I read the reviews for this particularly easy bake and made a few modifications. First of all, I did add about half of the stuffing mix into the squash after cooking. The rest of the recipe I followed to a "t", with the exception of: I minced two cloves of garlic and cooked it with the onions and squash; instead of simmering in water, I simmered in Zickles juice, and I added some crushed red pepper to the oil before initially cooking the squash...only because I like a little spice. I did add the optional cheese because, well...cheese. This. Turned. Out. Amazing. Thanks for the base recipe! I'll definitely make and modify over and over and over!

This dish was a hit at our Thanksgiving dinner!  To make it vegetarian I used cream of mushroom soup instead of the cream of chicken. I also added garlic powder, sea salt, and pepper to the squash mixture. Doubling up the recipe worked well. Deeeelish! Thank you!!!

I LOVE this recipe! We had a bunch of squash from the garden that needed to be used and this was the perfect way to do it. I cooked and cubed 4 chicken breasts and added them to the squash mixture to make it more of a complete main dish. I also used the cornbread stuffing, which I think really made the dish. My husband isn't even a big squash person and he loved it as well! This will definitely be a regular in our menu.

I followed fellow recommendations and put half the bread  crumbs in the soup and sour cream mixture. Of course I mixed the soup, cheese, stuffing mix,  and sour cream together before adding the squash. I topped it with cheese and then the remaining stuffing mix. I really didn't use a full 6 ounces though. I had some stuffing mix left, so now I'm making plans on using it to make meatballs!

It was way too saucy!  I more than doubled the squash and it was still saucy- my husband who knows nothing about cooking told me I should've added more squash, I told him there  were at least 6!

Excellent - use butternut squash for maximum flavor and fat free sour cream, low fat cream of chicken soup to keep the calorie count down and fat content lower

This was pretty good!  I also baked some chicken breasts to have a complete meal.  I also added some mushrooms that I needed to use.  I think next time I might add some peas too.  Thanks for the recipe!

easy to make and very delicious. I did not have stuffing mix so I substituted about 3/4 of a sleeve of buttery round crackers. Also added salt and black pepper to taste. For those who think it's too bland try adding about a tsp. of cayenne pepper.

Subbed parmesan/romano cheese because that is what we had, and used cream of mushroom with a chicken bouillon cube for same reason

Really good, even better the second day I think.  The only reason I gave a 4 was that I've had some better.
