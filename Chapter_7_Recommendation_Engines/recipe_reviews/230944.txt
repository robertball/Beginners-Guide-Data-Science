I tried this recipe for dinner and thought the taste was just ok. The fact I didn't have cream may have been a factor.  So I am giving it three stars because The amount of time required far exceeded 20 mins!  It took about an hour in total for me to prepare and cook this meal.  I don't know where the time estimates came from but it's difficult to brown chicken, then reduce tomatoes and then make a cream sauce in 15 mins!

Works fine with no salt diced tomatoes, but then I'm used to low salt foods.
