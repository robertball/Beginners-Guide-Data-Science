I'm giving this five stars because I love the way it tastes after I altered it. I haven't tried it the original way, but they way I made it is delish. I used thinly cut flank steak instead of the chicken. I also used one can of beef broth in place of one of the cans of chicken broth. Everything else stayed the same. This is spicy! Not so spicy that your eyes water, but spicy enough to make your taste buds tingle. I love this soup! It would've been great with chicken and only chicken stock, but I had to work with what I had. The end result was phenomenal (although being from the Sonoma Diet you probably should steer clear of the beef component).

The soup was great. I at a bowl and my husband at the rest. I doubled the recipe so that I could have left overs for this week.

My family and I really loved this soup.  I could not believe how healthy it was because it had such great flavor.  I doubled the recipe and used napa cabbage instead of regular cabbage.  I think this is key because the texture of the cabbage is much better than the hardier regular cabbage.  I substituted cristini mushrooms for the shiitake as I wasn't able to locate them.  I think any type of mushroom would work well in this.  Also, I didn't have reduced sodium broth or soy sauce so just used the regular version.  The end result was amazing and we will definitely be making this again - my husband raved about it and he is a picky person!

This is a good and simple hot and sour soup made with ingredients I had readily available.  Next time, I will either increase the broth or reduce the amount of chicken and cabbage.  Its not quite restaurant quality, but good enough for a better than average soup.  Perfect for colds!

It was pretty good, but a little too hot for my taste. I may make it again, but I will probably only give a couple of shakes of red pepper.
