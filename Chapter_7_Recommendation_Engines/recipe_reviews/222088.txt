I followed the recipe exact. I did bake my muffins at 350*, they were done in 20 minutes. I loved that this recipe used a minimal amount of sugar especially since my bananas were quite ripe and sweet enough on their own. My whole family loved these!

Had the recipe not said "healthier" I doubt I could've detected the difference!  Moist, and a tender crumb bursting w/ banana flavour!

Loved this recipe. Instead of muffins I made 3 mini banana bread loafs.  I substituted a yogurt butter blend for the butter and it came out very moist and delicious.  Nice recipe for those who love that banana bread taste without so much of the guilt.

I read so many commenting about the butter in the recipe.. I agree using applesauce is a healthy exchange but there is nothing wrong with butter as long as it is real butter and not margarine.. Butter is a healthy fat if used correctly and not in an abundance.. I do substitute butter sometimes with other things depending on the recipe and consistency but don't be hating butter.. It is not a bad choice!!!

I made the recipe as is! It was amazing. But I didn't stop there. I added 1 tsp vanilla extract and increased the cinnamon to 1/2 tsp for the mixture. For my preference, that was better. Great recipe. Family loved it. OH, and today when I made the recipe, I added green food coloring for St. Patrick's Day. Went over big.

I made a few changes but the basic recipe is a good start.  I added 1 Tablespoon of cinnamon to the muffin mix and added 1/4 tsp to the topping mixture.  I subbed applesauce for the 1/3 c butter for an even healthier muffin.  I did use butter for the topping and regretted it because it soaked through the muffin and the cups were sitting in butter when I took them out of the oven.  I will try applesauce for the topping next time. I will definitely make these again though.  I'm trying hard to NOT eat them all right away.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Fantastic recipe! I made a few minor changes, including subbing half of the butter for 1/3 C of pureed pumpkin that I had leftover in the fridge, adding 1 tsp. cinnamon to the batter, and adding some oats to the crumb topping.  Baked at 350 for 20 minutes, made 12 muffins instead of 10. Will absolutely make again!

Best receipt I've tried so far. Used more cinnamon, and added lots of whole oats to the topping. They're gone in a day here!

Oh my goodness!  I’ve made a lot of banana bread in my day, my past favorite included sour cream.  This recipe moves to the top of my go-to list from now on??. I did substitute applesauce for butter and truvia for the sugar only in the bread batter.  Left the crumb topping as is and it was superior to any I’ve ever eaten.  Thank you so much for sharing!

I'm not much of a baker, but I had 4 ripe bananas and had time to make something of them on a rainy Sunday afternoon.  This recipe fit the bill.  The only things I changed were to add cinnamon to the muffin mix, used a sugar/Stevia blend and only used 1/8 cup, and I didn't do the topping.  I only had jumbo muffin cups, so it made 7 muffins.  I baked them for 22 minutes and they were perfect.  Very moist and delicious!  Will make these again, for sure!

I didn't make the crumb topping so this is for the muffin itself. There's too many bananas. It kept the center from baking properly. The muffin had a weird rubbery/eggy/spongey texture.

So I tried to make it even healthier.. I ditched the crumb topping, replaced 1/3 melted butter with unsweetened applesauce, used whole wheat pastry flour instead of all purpose, and made mini muffins.. One recipe made 42 mini muffins.. Baked them for 13 minutes..... 32 calories a piece!! And DELISH!

I tried the recipe and followed it exactly. First of all it is not very healthy with the butter and sugar amounts. I think you could easily cut down on the butter with applesauce and the sugar is too much. As far as the taste, it is moist, but just okay flavor. I would try a different recipe with more flavor or add some.

I made this recipe as stated, but added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla to the wet mixture. I forgot to add the crumb topping, and they still turned out great! I'll make them again for sure... And this time I'll remember the topping too.

Excellent. I didn't have 4 bananas, only 2, so I added a couple of handfuls of frozen berries. Instead of butter, I used I can't believe it's not butter to make it even healthier. Now I know a quick and easy recipe to use up those brown bananas instead of throwing them away. Thank you

I made these muffins this morning, and they were excellent! I followed the recipe exactly, with one exception-I used Splenda in place of the white sugar. I'll definitely be making them again.

Delicious!  I used raw sugar instead of white, and added a generous tsp of vanilla along with several shakes each of cinnamon and nutmeg.  Lovely banana flavor, and not sickly sweet!  Best served warm with lashings of good healthy butter in my opinion.  The crumb topping is very nice, but you don't even really need that if you don't want the extra sugar, the muffin itself stands on it's own.

Pretty tasty! I accidentally used 1/2 cup of butter instead of 1/3 cup, but they were still pretty good.  I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.  I like that there is less sugar in the batter...makes me feel less guilty about the yummy streusel topping!

It turned out really good. My husband ate 2 pieces after it cooled off. The only thing changed was I made it into banana bread in a loaf pan. I searched on the internet and it said 350 degrees for bread and 375 for muffins is preferable. I send recipe to my mom who loves banana bread.

This is healthier than the other Banana Crumb Muffin recipe, not the healthiest.  It's a great option for less sugar.  They taste great too!

I followed the recipe exactly ,except I used six jumbo muffin cups. I baked them 5 minutes longer. Delicious!  They looked like the giant muffins you buy at your grocery bakery shop.

This is a "healthier" version of the very popular Banana Crumb Muffin recipe.  The texture of this muffin is just slightly different than the original.  I still love the original but I will make this sugar reduced version from now on.  Thanks for posting.

Did this recipe exactly as it is. Delicious! Will definitely be making these again! I loved how many bananas it called for, really kept them very moist and yummy. Less flour, less oil, less sugar and more bananas than an original banana muffin recipe.  Absolutely deserves 5 stars!

These were moist and delicious.  Just sweet enough...the topping made it more sweet but the muffin by itself was good.  I didn't feel bad feeding this to my 10 month old (removed toping) and 3 yr old.Will try using low-fat yogurt or apple sauce instead of butter next time. I made recipe exactly as written except I used ww flour.

I made this recipe using some of the other suggestions.  Added cinnamon to the muffin mix and used 1 tablespoon unsweetened applesauce in place of the butter on the topping.  I also added the quick oats to the topping mix and only a little bit of flour.  They came out great

Wonderful, flavorful muffins!  I added a bit of quick oats to the crumb topping, but the rest is exactly as directed, and we could not be happier!   I got 12 muffins from the recipe, though, not 10.  Yay bonus muffins!

Was out of AP flour but used Bread flour. Used all the sugar because bananas were not quiet ripe enough for me. Turned out great. Not too sweet and had nice tops. Will put a smidge of vanilla in next time.

I swapped out the butter in the muffins for unsweetened applesauce and they came out AMAZING! I added these to my recipe box and am looking forward to making them again.

My daughter requested banana muffins for a treat following her upcoming breast cancer surgery, however, she wanted something with less sugar and a healthier recipe. I made six extra large muffins and a small loaf pan from the ingredients. I had my boys try the loaf pan and they loved the banana bread!! Thank you, I know she’s gonna love it!!

I did not read the recipe correctly and made mistakes, but the muffin taste and texture still turned out great!
My mistake was adding the brown sugar,white sugar, and cinnamon in the batter. And I used 3 bananas because I did not have 4.
I also substituted 1/2 cup of all-purpose flour for Quinoa flour.
I added 1/2 c. chopped pecans, 1/2 c. chopped walnuts, and 1 tbsp. poppy seeds.

My son made these (he’s 18) and they came out very good. Even though he usually likes things sweet, he thought these were great and so did I. They are not very sweet but just enough to make them enjoyable. The crumb topping really adds to the experience. Personally I would have liked walnuts or pecans in these and feel they would have been even better with those additions but my son is allergic so he didn’t put any. Made this in a 5x9 stoneware loaf pan.

I love these muffins! They have the texture and amount of sweetness I like. I made as written except I added cinnamon and omitted the topping. I use 2 large ripe bananas, the size wasn't mentioned so thought i'd be safe with that. It was perfect for me. Have made them twice now and it's a keeper. I freeze them so I won't eat them all in a short time. They are excellent to just pull out of the freezer and pop in the microwave. They are perfect in 40 seconds according to my microwave anyway.

I found this to be a simple, healthy recipe for muffins. I always add/ substitute extra healthy stuff into my muffins, so instead of butter, I used olive oil. I added a 1/2 cup oats and 1/4 cup mini semi-sweet chocolate chips, as well as I used 2 eggs to up the protein quotient some. And, as I am that mom that adds wheat germ to "everything," I added 1/2 cup wheat germ (with cinnamon and flax.) These come out tasty, hearty, and a great way to use up almost dead bananas.
As I was going for healthy, and since I add the chocolate chips, I always skip out on adding the topping. I have made these numerous times....soooo good!

These muffins turned out great!  I added 2T of ground flax seed and 2T of water (to soak the seed-turned gelatinous) to pack an even healthier punch.  I also baked at 350* for about 22 minutes.  It made 12 muffins.

Do you happen to have a nutrition guide? I want to try them. But I have to stick to recipes I can get that info on. 5 star for sure but my restrictions toward a healthy lifestyle include calories and the rest of the nutritional values.

Okay, this is my own fault for violating a basic rule of baking: Read the whole recipe before you begin. I didn't do that, and that's my fault. 

Anyway, they taste great, just really too sweet for my liking

This is a great quick recipe, I used whole wheat flour and instead of using white sugar used pure raw honey.  My family loves these deliciously moist banana muffins.

I made these muffins this morning after finding the recipe yesterday.   They have a delicious flavor and made the kitchen smell wonderful, as noted in many reviews.  However, instead of using all white flour, I used 3/4 C flour and 3/4 C Almond meal.   I also, in the second half of the batter, added about a quarter cup of chopped walnuts.  Having a few nuts remaining, I sprinkled them on top of those muffins.  The recipe made 12 nice size muffins.  They are very moist, a bit more than I prefer.   I will make them again, tweaking the recipe to get them closer to the right fully baked consistency.

These muffins were great! I made just a few changes to suit our tastes. Used only 3 bananas,(that's all I had)used half white-wheat flour and half all-purpose, added a tsp of vanilla and doubled amount of cinnamon for topping. Very moist and just sweet enough.

I followed the recipe until I got distracted and put the brown sugar in the batter.  Once I did that, I decided to add a tsp of vanilla and 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and forget the crumb topping.  They are delicious.  I did underbake them a little.  Probably my oven as they didn't cook evenly.  Some were just right and others had soft spots of banana.  I will definitely use this recipe again!  Next time, I may try "skinnying" it down with applesauce.

This review is for my own notes. 4 stars because I think the spices are really needed for flavor (don't have nutmeg). Used half brown sugar, half white. 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice. Probably could use more cinnamon. IKEA pink Mini muffin silicone cups on baking sheet for 18 min. Makes about 17. Came out great. They are so bite size it's hard not to just eat all of them!

Delicious and bursting with banana-ness! Made these for my toddler *crossing my fingers that she loves them* though I'll eat them if she doesn't. It's super simple. Cut the baking time to about 10 minutes (probably should have toothpick tested at 8....since they kept cooking as they cooled in the pan). Didn't need to grease in my nonstick and cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup - and that was plenty for my ripe bananas! Only used 3 bananas b/c that's what I had on hand....this is such a good recipe for 12+ month olds.  Left off the streusel topping - I don't need her jumping off the walls before bedtime! Still plenty sweet.

This was super quick and easy! I only had 3 bananas and the muffins still came out very moist. I also added approx. 1/4 -1/3 of a cup of Heath crumbles that I had left over in the pantry. This made for an excellent banana toffee carmel crumble muffin. I will definitely make these again! I was able to cook at 375 for about 20 mins, and got an excellent crunch from the topping.

I had 4 black bananas to get rid of, so I made these.  I added a bit of cinnamon to the batter and substituted applesauce for the eggs because my son is allergic to eggs...they came out looking beautiful and tasting even better!  I love that there is butter in the recipe rather than oil - it gives them a very rich flavor.

Amazing flavour, even though I didn't add the crumbs. I also realized I ran out of muffin liners so I greased the pan, but they stuck and I was left with really broken muffins.

Really good!  Made it with wheat flour instead and it came out great.  The topping is superb.  I cook for the 18 min and they come out perfect.  Make sure you only use brown sugar for the topping and white sugar for the muffin.  First time I made them I used both for the muffin on accident.  Boys like when I add chocolate chips in them.

Yum!  These muffins are so scrumptious!  I only had 3 bananas, so I substituted a cup of unsweetened applesauce for the other banana, and it worked well.  I also took another reviewer's suggestion of adding extra cinnamon to the topping as well as vanilla to the batter.  The flavor is superb!  I will try adding a little oatmeal to the topping the next time I make them for a little more texture.  Highly recommend these!  I don't think they will last very long!

I took a healthier approach and made a few substitutions. Stevia in place of granulated sugar, gluten free potato-rice flour in place of reg flour, coconut oil in place of butter. I also added some freshly ground peanut butter (organic no sugar added) a tsp of peanut butter extract, cinnamon, vanilla extract and baked them in mini muffin tins :) came out super moist and flavorful. My daughter loves them!

This recipe is extremely similar to the original, even in exact appearance. The only change I see is an exta banana was used and the refined sugar is cut by a half a cup. I have to admit I actually like the base on these better as they taste more like banana than sugar. Although, I would like to rework the topping. I found it to sugary on the original recipe too. Both recipes also have a soft texture and for whatever reason I prefer a more dense muffin. Really liked how the refined sugar was adjusted on this without affecting the recipe though. I took them out of the oven at 18 minutes. The topping seemed pretty much done, while the batter on top appeared slightly wet looking still. I turned off the oven, but set them back in for about eight minutes, checking twice, and it worked. They were perfectly baked.

This is the best banana muffin recipe I've tried. I especially appreciate the minimal amount of sugar without sacrificing taste!

Recipe came out great. Made a few modifications: instead of using the brown sugar and cinnamon as a topping, I added it to the mixture. And replaced the 1/4 cup of sugar with a 1/2 of cup of sweetener (Splenda). I also left out the extra tablespoon of butter and 2 tablespoons of flour. I added to caps of vanilla extract and used slices of bananas as the topping instead. Cook time was about 15 mins. Great recipe! Thanks

Was absolutely delicious.  I followed the recipe except for the fact that I only had 3 bananas instead of four.  I can't wait to make these again. The banana taste was not overpowering and it was so light.  Love love love this

So good! Light and moist and it makes me feel good to give my family something a little healthier. I couldn't tell any difference between these and the more fattening banana crumb muffins.

My 14 year old made these and loved them. Not as decadent as the orignal banana crumb muffins....but a nice lighter change. Great way to use up those over ripe bananas! Thanks!

Terrific recipe...some of the best banana muffins I've made - EVER.  I appreciate the fact that you didn't call it a healthy muffin - it is healthIER than the original by cutting sugar, but it still a treat.  I reduced the amount of sugary topping I put on the muffins - it just seemed like too much.

A hit with the whole family! No need to bake a less healthy version! Tastes great! Will use this one over and over again! Didn't change a thing.
