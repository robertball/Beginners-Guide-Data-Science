Very good! And fun to make! The sauce needed about a tablespoon more of soy sauce than what the recipe says but overall they were delicious.

These were good and the cilantro was a nice addition. I chose the alternative method for cooking as the recipe submitter listed. I prefer a crisp on my wontons and the alternative method did the trick. I think the filling could have used a little more flavor so next time I will add some sesame oil to it and maybe some ginger.
