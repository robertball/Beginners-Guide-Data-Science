This is an excellent recipe. Very similar to the pies my Italian grandmother made.

This was a lovely subtle pie, really nice. I had a few issues with the pastry though, it seemed to be sticky and crumbly at the same time. I don't know whether that's the recipe or the chef, though, because I don't tend to use a method like that for pastry, so I could just be inexperienced. It was, as someone else said, quite a complicated pie to put together, and it took me quite a while, but I think it was worth it, although unless anyone gives me any tips I'll just use my usual pastry for the crust.

The taste was great, however, there was too much rice and it was way too dense and a bit dry.  I would liked to be a little bit more of the creamy base so next time I will reduce the amount of rice.  I will make this again.

I thought this was wonderful. It's very floral, which some family members found off-putting. If you're unsure about the orange blossom water, you might try reducing the amount by half; it's pretty powerful stuff. I might bump up the zest, too. Next time, I would blind-bake the crust and maybe omit the lattice crustâ€”or bake the pie partway, until the surface firms up, and try to add the lattice mid-bake? When I set the dough strips on the filling, they started to sink down into it, and the filling's so wet, they didn't bake all the way through. The filling started browning before the crust was set, so I covered the top with foil for the last part of baking. Worth experimenting with this one, though.

This is a good, nice, but not a rich pie. Delicious on its own, but the taste is not very festive. I agree with other reviewers that the dough is very difficult to work with. 2 cups flour is too much, I added 1 3/4 cups and it was plenty. The dough is crumbly and it is imposible to cut it. I put it into baking springform and pressed with my fingers. It is the only one way that I could do with it. I didn't have enough dough to make the lattice strips. So I ended up making crumble topping. The recipe makes too much filling, so be sure to make large edges. The filling is a little runny but it sets quickly in the oven. I think the pie has too much rice, 3/4 cup would be enough.

Lucky enough to have a taste when a co-worker made it. It's tender, creamy, delicate; love the flavor of the aromatic orange flower water and orange zest.

Full disclosure: I am not Italian, but I loved this dessert. I made it and everyone loved it. I had a little difficulty finding the orange flower water, and finally just ordered it online. But I think it is those little touches that take recipes like this into a whole new realm. Authentic, made from scratch, (of course), and divinely delicious, it is one I will make again and again. Thank you for sharing this old world recipe.

I really wanted to love this pie but there was too much rice and it was not very creamy at all.

Instead of raisins, I used pineapple slices to garnish it.With cherries in the middle,like what you would put on a ham at Easter.
