I'm giving it 4 stars because that's the average and I didn't want to rate it the way I made it... which would be 9 stars. Usually I'm annoyed when people rate a recipe when they've completely changed it, but it's like passing a stone to get a recipe approved on this site (unless of course, you have a recipe for Corn Fudge which apparently they have no problem publishing... but I digress).  I saw the reviews that said too saucy and too bland... so here's what I did and it might just be the best thing I've ever made.  ***My husband is washing all the dishes right now if that's any indication.  I carmelized some red onion and put that at the bottom of the 9x13. Then I put down 3 butterflied chicken breasts I had lightly browned first.  Covered with a slice of swiss cheese. Poured the sauce over (sour cream, sherry, & 1/2 the amount of soup) and baked.  Oh, then sprinkled about 6 thin slices of crumbled cooked bacon.  Served this crazy mess over some egg noodles and I swear, I'm so darn proud of myself.  This was really excellent.  I stole the ideas from some other similar recipes on this site.  Forgive me, please, for reviewing a recipe I changed so much.  I just had to share.

Mother and I have this recipe but with a few changes. We cut the breasts into bite sized pieces, flour them with salt added and sautee. Also we add about 1 lb of sauteed mushrooms and onion.Instead of sherry we use a light white wine or chablis as it is not as strong as the sherry. My family loves this recipe.

Pretty good. I was unsure because it seemed like would be a little bland. I used 2 mushroom soups and 1 chicken(not a fan of too much cream of chicken flavor)-the 98% fat free soups-turned out great, 16 ounces of sour cream, and 3/4 cup of sherry. It made a good sauce over egg noodles. I also browned the chicken before baking and I seasoned the chicken with salt/pepper/onion powder as it browned. Very tasty.

This is a good, quick recipe.  Sauce has a very nice flavor.  However, 4 cans of soup seems like a lot!  I used three (two cream of chicken, one cream of mushroom) and could hardly fit it all into the pan.  Next time I might try two cans and adjust the rest of the ingredients.  Also used sherry, rather than cream sherry, and it turned out fine.

Awesome!!  I loved this recipe, it was a break from the normal chicken!!  It tasted as if it was from a High End Restaurant and my guests loved it!!The only thing I will add in the future is a little seasoning!  other than that it was perfect!

This is a recipe that my grandmother used to make and my entire family loves it.  It's funny to me that my mother & step-father make it and also my father & step-mother.  We actually switch it up occasionally with marsala instead of sherry, both are good.  My mother omits the cream of chicken soup and I like it that way better.  It is one of those things that I can throw together real fast if I just have a tub of sour cream and a can of cream of mushroom soup.  (I use one can of soup and 1/3 cup of sour cream, 1/4 cup of sherry).

Got rave reviews....  Sauce is great as rice "gravy."  I didn't have a can of cream of mushroom so I substituted more cream of chicken instead, and I still got asked for the recipe.  Nice change of pace from the usual fare and so EASY!!

This recipe needed some work. I added 1tsp Thyme. I only used 1 can of each cream of... and 4 oz sour cream. Add to this a cup of half and half so it is not so thick. I also chopped and sauted an onion and to make a pot pie kind of filling added fresh peas,carrots and potatoes. Serve this with some bisquits and you have an easy dinner.

Made this tonight for me and my wife, substituted a can of golden mushroom soup, added sauteed mushrooms and onions, added 4 oz. cream cheese, added 1 cup artichoke hearts. Was tempted to add garlic but did not want it to steal the flavor of the cream sherry, so did not add it. Served this over linguine. Oh, my goodness was it ever good! I just had to brag about it on my Facebook page!

I liked this a lot.  It was very simple and tasty.  I served over pasta.  This is not for someone who does not like the flavor of sherry.

Super easy and very tasty - we used all lowfat ingredients (except for the Sherry) and it was still great.  I'm sure with the original ingredients it would be even better.

Delicious but needs a little tweaking. My husband suggested that maybe next time I could add mushrooms, and some parsley for some color. I halved the recipe and had an abundance of sauce as well so I recommend cutting back to anyone reading the recipe.

only used half the recommended soups and sour cream. before I put the chicken in the soup mix, I dusted them with a little salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder.  It still seemed like I could have cut the soup mixture down even more but got rave reviews on this one.

My husband and I weren't too thrilled over this recipe. It was kind of bland. I added 2 cloves crushed garlic, salt, and pepper and it still wasn't that great. Plus it made WAY too much sauce. It was a total waste. I used maybe 1/4 of it. The rest got thrown out. It wasn't bad, but I'll probably never make this again.

Very good! Very simple! The sauce made a tasty gravy for potatoes. Will probably halve the amount of sauce next time, and will probably add mushrooms. Outstanding!

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I did substitute one can of garlic mushroom for cream of mushroom because I already had it.  It added a lot of flavor and I recommend it.  This recipe makes about twice the sauce you need but I'm freezing it for another night.  Nobody would ever guess how easy this is.

This was a very good recipe! The sauce was very tasty and might try it on potatoes at some point. My only real gripe was that it was a little dense for my liking. I added less soup than called for, and it was still pretty dense. Great, unique flavor though.

Perfect!  It's incredibly easy, but tastes very refined.  I grilled the chicken first, so it had wonderful grill marks that added to the visual appeal.  The first time I made this I halved the recipe but still used 2/3 cup sherry, so it tasted distinctly like sherry and got mixed reviews.  The second time, however, it was amazing.

My boyfriend is tired of baked or fried chicken so tried this out on him. He raved about it. The sauce is perfect as gravy over mashed potatoes. Definitely a keeper and very easy to make.

This was surprisingly good. I didn't know what it would be like opening up all those cans. I added a lot of fresh ground black pepper. Yum.

My mother has been making a dish like this since I was a little boy. I make it without the mushroom soup though. It is very easy to make and is incredible over white rice with Pillsbury crescent rolls or biscuits.
