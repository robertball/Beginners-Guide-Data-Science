This is the way my mother used to make scalloped corn.  The only difference is we added 1 egg for each can of corn, 1/2 cup of half and half or mild, 1-2 tsp. of onion salt and pepper.  It is delicious and my grown sons request the recipe to make it themselves.

This is the exact recipe my mom had made for years!  There are others on this site that are more "cake" like (my grandma made that kind for holiday dinners) but this one was a Sunday dinner veggie growing up.  Always brings back memories of adding too much milk and no enough crackers and having runny corn (which my dad hated) or not enough milk and way too many crackers and having a dry, gluey mess!  Thanks for the recipe - I hope to pass it on to my kids!

My mother had always made this recipe.  It is bland if you don't add anything, but add some salt, pepper, and butter then it taste great.

This was a family favorite growing up.  I enjoyed this recipe but added two full packs of crushed saltines. Will make over and over again.

This was really good as is.  I mean, you could add other spices and butter to jazz it up, but it's really good as is.  It was really simple and didn't need much prep time at all.  I will probably make this again.

I think it was wonderful. I think it is missing a little something but that may have been me. I think maybe it needed a bit more pepper and some salt in the mix.

This is the old tried a true Scalloped Corn recipe but I have always added chopped union and salt and pepper. A few years ago a neighbor made a full dinner for my family one year after I had just got home from the hospital and one of the things she brought was scalloped corn, but she added about 1/2 of a small jar of red pimento and I loved it and I now add  the pimento every time I make it. Everyone liked it better. Good neighbors are great!
