This recipe is a keeper.  I used a small can of corn instead of carrots.  The yogurt is a good idea for people watching thier waist line.  However, the taste was slightly noticeable.  Next time I will try low fat sour cream.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

This recipe is great! I thought it would be too spicy, but it was just right! My 3 year old daughter even likes it!

Was ok but not as flavorful as I would have liked, even tho I used garlic and onion and taco seasoning with my chicken. Probably won't make again.

Very delicious  and super easy to make. Period.  Defiantly going to the top of my list.  I love the addition of the carrots. The yogurt, queso cheese and cream of chicken soup were delicious  ingredients. If your sensitive to spice hold back on the hot sauce. Unfortunately there weren't any leftovers!

Absolutely delicious. Instead of using garlic hot sauce  I used garlic and tapitio. Also added olives to the cheese sauce. Amazing and filling.
