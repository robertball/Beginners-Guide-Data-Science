I was a bit skeptical, but made this to take to Easter dinner.  It was so yummy, and honestly, was even better the next day!  It looks very fancy, and was sweet but not too sweet.  We loved it!  Thanks!

What a delight with two of my husband's most favorite items- butterscotch pudding and pecans!

This is a fabulous pie. My grandmother used to make it every Christmas. I am so happy to find this recipe and continue her tradition.

Very good... I think we like traditional pecan pie a little better but this was a nice change and didn't stay around long!

Do you have to cook it in the oven if youâ€™re not topping it with meringue?
