My mouth was watering to try this recipie and as it cooked and baked it looked delicious but when I served it the crust was a disaster, the only way I can describe it was glue.  The only explaination I could think of was my filling was boiling when I poured it in the crust and topped it.  So I made another one (I think a failed recipie is a challenge and I keep trying to prove I can do it!) and this time let the filling cool before filling the crust and it turned out Perfect!  My husband loved it and the kids at least picked out the turkey, no vegatables for them!

Crust is the key thing in this recipe. I've made it twice with 2 different store-bought crusts and one time it was amazing, the next time it was disgusting. I'll stick with the refrigerated crusts that come folded up. The filling is fabulous and doesn't come out super runny like I expected. Will make this every time I have leftovers to use up, whether it's turkey, chicken, or roast. Excellent recipe!

A delicious recipe for leftover turkey. I didn't feel like making another pie crust, so I greased the bottom of my pan and used leftover stuffing as a topping. It was great! My child and husband loved it!

My husband is extremely picky about his pot pies and he LOVED this so much he asked me to make it again with beef tonight.  I made a few changes.  I used the onion and the celery but for the rest of the veggies I used half a bag of frozen corn, peas, carrots, and string beans.  I only used one boullion cube and 1 cup of water.  I cubed the potatoes pretty small and after the veggies and potatoes were cooked I added a jar of Homestyle turkey gravy.  I also used about 2 cups of cubed turkey.  I baked the bottom crust for 10 minutes while the filling was cooling and then covered with the top crust.  I sprayed the top crust with butter cooking spray to give it a little more color.  It came out perfect.  My husband ate almost half the pie.

This turned out really well and is a great use for that leftover dark meat that never tastes as good reheated.  I followed another reviewers advice and used leftover stuffing as the top crust and it turned out beautifully.  I also used leftover turkey broth instead of the chicken boullion.  I was a little hesitant about the spices, but the flavor was good.  I may use a little less parsley next time just for looks and add a little poultry seasoning for a little extra "turkey" flavor.  One warning, though.  This makes a BIG pot pie.  The recipe calls for a 10 inch pie pan (which I don't have) so I used a medium casserole dish and it still filled to the brim and spilled over a little while cooking.  Just be sure to put some foil under the dish to catch spills!

First I want to say thank you to the original poster and that I loved the flavor of this recipe so much I wanted to make it again but with a few important changes.  As stated by some others, this pot pie has no sauce to it and that’s a must for me. So I exchanged milk for cream and doubled the quantity to 1 cup.  There is no measurement for potato in the recipe, and it needs it. The first time I used 3 small russets and it was far too much so I changed that to 1.5 cup cubed potato.  I used turkey stock from the boiled turkey carcass and it made a noticeable improvement.  I increased the amount of turkey from 1.5 cups to 2.5 cups and slightly increased the amount of flour to 4 Tbs. I also used torn pieces of turkey instead of cubed but that’s just a personal preference and shouldn’t affect the flavor.   With these modifications the result was a perfect pot pie with a creamy sauce and great flavor. You may wish to slightly increase the seasoning to compensate for the additional turkey.  Pre-baking the bottom crust for 5-6 minutes is a must as the filling is now more liquid.

Good flavor but no sauce to speak of which brought gripes from my boyfriend, we had leftovers plus extra filling so last night I carefully scooped out the filling from the leftover pie into a large sauce pot, added the extra filling I had set aside and stirred in a can of family sized Campbell's cream of chicken soup (w/enough milk to bring the whole lot to the right consistency) heated it through and served it over the warmed pie crust -that did the trick - it was delicious and tasted even better than the pies from the famous Chicken Pie Shop of San Diego.  Definitely add the soup - it makes this recipe perfect and earns it that 5th star.  I also used the flaky butter crust, it was a perfect compliment and had the best flavor of any crust I've ever made.

Best pot pie I have ever had! I used two tsps of chicken base instead of bouillion cubes. And then I added about another cup (maybe less) of water & another 1/2 tsp of chicken base so there would be more gravy. I did add some frozen peas but I did not add any salt because my turkey was well seasoned .... & I didn't add the spices until I added the turkey because I didn't want to cook all the flavor out. Used a homemade pie crust...YUMMY! Thansk Linda!!!

This was great.  I had a 14-pounder in my freezer and it was time to cook it.  After deboning, it yielded 10 cups of juicy turkey.  I tripled this recipe (for freezing) and used 3+ cups of turkey in each.  Oherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  It was perfect.  The only thing I would try for a change is to add a packet of turkey gravy and an additional cup of water to the pie filling (per pie).  I like the taste of turkey gravy and I like it to taste like turkey, not chicken.  If you're going to make turkey pot pie, this is the one to try.  Thanks.

I have made this recipe several times now, and it is always great every time.  It turns out less runny if you let the filling cool before putting it in the pie shell.  It is also yummy with chicken.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I always get a great response from my guests when I cook this! It smells great and tastes even better. No canned food for this recipe, it's made with ALL FERSH veggies! I love that, it tastes so much richer that way and it is so much healthier too! AND IT'S PRETTY EASY TO MAKE :)

whipped this up with recommended changes to a ROUSING success!  Changes I included: almost everything i could find in the fridge after a crazy Thanksgiving weekend! - Mushrooms, frozen peas & corn, diced red pepper, fingerling potatoes... mixed in leftover gravy with the turkey & floor, also added some to the veggies, along with turkey stock (added chicken stock when i ran out).  Baked the bottom pie crust for 10, and couldn't find my pie plate so made it in a 8 x 8 casserole dish.  Also, drank a glass of Pinot Noir while cooking, and am sure that helped.  Husband RAVED and I basked in wine and glory!

I normally try to follow a recipe exactly the first time I make it rather than making changes, however I knew after just reading the ingredients that I would have to do some tweaking to make it a little more flavorful.Here are the changes I made:I used about 14 baby carrots, chopped up. I also added 2 cloves of minced garlic to the butter with the other ingredients. I had to use chicken broth instead of the bouillion and after using 2 cups decided this was not nearly enough liquid so I added a third cup of broth. Then, instead of using another pan, I added the turkey and some other spices...1/2 tsp. paprika, 1/2 tsp. rosemary, and 1 tsp. dried sage...to the broth/veggie mixture, heating it to a boil. I then mixed 5 tbsp. of flour (to accomodate the extra broth) and 1/2 c. milk and added to the boiling mixture.  Allowed to cook for 5 more minutes until it thickened and removed from heat. I made 8 individual pot pies using large sized glass custard cups. For the crust I used Pillsbury pie crusts and baked them for 10 minutes to brown to prevent a soggy crust. For those reviewers who think the crust needs to be homemade, Pillsbury makes a good crust...and my husband actually thought it was my usual homemade crust. I will definitely use this recipe again and think the extra time is worth it because it has all fresh ingredients and there is no disgusting cream of chicken or mushroom soup. With all my changes I give this recipe a four and will continue to experiment with seasoning

This was amazingly good.  The only changes I made: * Omitted the parsley because I didn't have any. * Added 1/2 tsp of sage & 1 tsp of poultry seasoning to the onion/carrot/celery mixture. * Increased the turkey to a little over 2 cups & also increased the flour to 4 TBLS & Milk to 2/3 cup to compensate for the additional turkey. * Decreased the number of potatoes to 1 1/2 and added about a cup of peas. I used Pillsubury pie crust in a deep dish 10 inch pie plate. Was one of the best pot pies I've eaten.  My husband proclaimed it as "professional".  I will definitely make this again.  Delicious & easy, what more could you ask for?

Wow!  Made this tonight with the leftover christmas turkey and boy, was it a hit.  I followed directions precisely, used pillsbury pie crust and let the filling (which smelled absolutely heavenly) cool for ten minutes before pouring it into the pie shell.  i brushed the top crust with a beaten egg before baking and it turned out to be beautiful and delicious.  This recipe is a keeper!!

I was looking for a way to use the last of my Christmas turkey leftovers, and boy, did I hit the jackpot.  This was fantastic!  I've never made a pot pie before.  It took a little while, but was well worth it.  I did use some other reviewers suggestions. I added some frozen peas while the potatoes were cooking, and added a can of cream of chicken soup (and about 1/2 can water) to make it more saucy.  I also used cut up baby carrots instead of fresh ones.  After cutting up my turkey, I realized I had about twice the amount the recipe called for, but I threw it all in anyway!  The flavor was wonderful; after putting the pie in the oven, I did had enough filling left in the pan to make another one, but my husband ate ALL of it while the pie was baking! He's a picky eater, and we weren't sure he'd like this, but he gave it 2 thumbs up while his mouth was full.  I will definitely try this again soon using chicken.  This is a great recipe!  Thanks!

I used this filling but put it into individual pot pies and froze them. Then all I had to do was pull them out and bake them for dinner.  It made about 6 pot pies, and was a quick, yummy dinner!

This really was the perfect way to use up leftover turkey...I used a pre-made crust and used chicken stock intend of bouillon and water, everything else was done by the recipe. This was first time to make a pot pie and it definitely won't be the last. We all really liked it!

This needs tweaking. It has very little flavor and what it does have comes from the MSG loaded bouillon cubes. Use chicken stock (homemade if possible) instead of the bouillon and water. Add some sage, thyme, if you can have garlic add that. Carrots and peas are almost essential in a pot pie recipe. Don't be expecting a ton of sauce with this. Pot pies aren't supposed to be runny. The ones that are pre-made or frozen are because the companies that make them want to save money. Veggies and meat cost more than sauces, so they use the sauce as filler.

Let me say straight away that I modified this recipe quite a bit out of necessity, but the general recipe itself is a good one and we were all very pleased with our pot pie.  THe changes I made were:  A single crust which served as a topper (no soggy bottom crust!), more carrots and celery and fewer potatoes, one T. fresh +1/2 tsp dried thyme (personal preference over oregano), and 2 tsp. jarred chicken broth base instead of bouillon.  Using only one crust simplifies the recipe.  Just dump the filling into a shallow dish (mine was an oval but a 10" deep pie plate would be fine) and top it with your rolled out single-crust.  I just crimped it around the edge and cut a few slits on top.  This is a fine family meal.  Four servings if you've got hungry teenagers and a big husband!

Great recipe, but I bake the bottom crust first, before adding the filling. Drape the top crust over the baked one , so it won't burn. My family loves that the bottom crust is fully cooked.

VERY GOOD!  This recipe came in handy by taking a small amount of turkey and feeding 7 people.  The changes I made were to cut back on the parsley, use frozen peas and carrots, add more milk, and brush the crust with egg prior to baking.  I doubled all the ingredients and made two pies.  It got two thumbs up from the entire family.   Thanks Linda for such a VERY GOOD recipe!

We make this every time we have turkey. We love it. We substitute stuffing for the top pastry crust.

I have made this pot pie more times than I can count and we just love it. 
After the first time I made it I started to experiment. I always use 2 cups of chicken broth instead of the water and bullion. Pie crust is not my specialty so I buy the refrigerated ready made crusts. I have used frozen peas in this recipe and they are good if you like peas(don't use canned, they're too mushy). I also don't care much for oregano so I usually use rosemary or thyme instead. A little celery seed is also good.

Delicious.  Period.  I do recommend at least 2 full cups of cubes turkey. Crust is great if you do 2 things: 1) let mixture cool, as others have said, before pouring, and 2) bake bottom crust 5 - 8 minutes first before adding mixture and top crust.  Adding a jar of homestyle turkey gravy was a real plus, as suggested, and use a medium sized casserole dish, not a pie pan.  Cannot wait to make another!

This recipe was incredible! I was looking for a recipe that didn't include some sort of canned soup or frozen veg, so this fit the bill perfectly! the only thing I changed is instead of the 2 cups of water and 2 boullion cubes, I used 2 cups of reserved turkey gravy stock. (the drippings of the turkey + water from the boiled potatoes, scraped bottom of roasting pan, and voila, gravy stock). It tasted wonderful! i also only used one pie crust on top, because i find that bottom pie shells always turn out glue-like in pot pies. an incredible recipe that is sure to see my table again! thanks so much linda!

Nothing wrong with this recipe. I omitted potatoes (for the lack of) and added mushrooms and peas to take their place. I only had one pie crust, so I used it on top. Filling WAS NOT WATERY. It was thick and seasonings did not overpower. This was fun to make with my 3 year old too. Zero leftovers.

OMG!  Wow... I certainly added my spin by making a scratch crust using the fat skimmed off the top of refrigerated turkey drippings in place of shortning in the crust.  I also added frozen peas, diced leeks, and fresh mushrooms to the saute before adding the turkey/milk mixture.    I also used a slotted spoon to fill the pie crusts before baking so the excess liquid could drain out and the filling wouldn't be runny.  It stood up stiff like a pecan pie would and didn't run out all over the plate when sliced.  Loved it!  This is a new staple in my post-thanksgiving lineup.

My family loves this recipe.  I use Bisto instead of flour as it adds more flavour and does not clump like flour does. Like others I add frozen corn and frozen peas to the recipe and instead of using regular pie crust, I use a puff pastry. I cook the base pasty first and then add the filling and top it with more puff pastry.  Yummy!

I followed the recipe exactly, but pre-baked the bottom crust for 7 minutes. Be sure and let the filling cool to room temp before putting it into the crust.  Fantastic!

Oh ya, it's worth it! I used left over gravy instead of the water, milk and flour. I also added frozen peas and cold turkey after cooking the other veggies to cool the filling. I put it in my Pampered Chef deep dish baker with room to spare!

This is an absolutely delicious recipe. I made it into individual pies using
whole wheat crust and substituted chicken broth for the water and boullion. 
It was well liked by everyone and is on now the "family favourites" list.

Best Potpie ever!  I make the filling in a triple batch, divide among vacuum bags and freeze.  I cheat and buy the REFRIGERATED crusts (Pillsbury is the best) and then I can just thaw out a bag overnight and dump it in the crust to bake.  * If you make multiple batches it is SOOO much easier to not mix the veggie/ turkey ingredients first, just dump the correct amount into each bag and then mix up the sauce and use a measuring cup to distribute evenly.  Otherwise you'll end up with the last bag full of mostly just peas!

This pie was really good! I did, however, leave out the carrots and subbed with corn. Would have preferred peas but I was out of them. I also used a good 2 cups of turkey.  I had a deep dish pie crust in the freezer and a Pillsbury crust in the fridge so I was able to use them up. Thinking about doing this one again since I have so much turkey left over.

This was fantastic. I made it as is, and even though it was a little more prep than my usual pot pies, it was well worth it.  I actually made three and froze two. Turns out they don't suffer from being frozen--the one we took out of the freezer last week was fine.

This was awesome. I changed a few things because of what I had available. I used fresh green beans instead of celery, I used white wine and herb chicken broth instead of the water and bouillon cubes and I used a jar of turkey gravy instead of the milk and four. Perfect.

Great taste and fairly easy. My husband gives it 4.5 stars, he would like more crust so thinks we should make it into individual small dishes. I doubled the sauce and then I thought there weren't enough "insides" and it was a bit runny. I would go with double both or do 1.5x the sauce if following the original recipe. I used chix stock to cook the vegis and chix. I added minced garlic to the onions (which I increased to 3/4 a cup) and added potatoes to the mix. I also pre-baked my bottom crust for just 5 min. and cooked it all at 375 deg for about 40 min. If I had one of those metal crust covers I would have put it on toward the end, the edge was getting fairly dark.

Finally a pot pie recipe that doesn't need cream soup.  I made a few changes to suit what I had at hand, but followed the spirit of the recipe and it was a very good way to use up leftover turkey and vegetables.

Wow! I can't believe how good this was, and I'm not a fan of the cheap store bought pot pies. A fantastic way to use left-over holiday turkey. My changes were: I added a touch of rosemary (my turkey was already flavored with that) and I only used one large skillet - not two like step #3 suggests - since my turkey was precooked. I didn't add any extra liquid, as some users suggested. I felt like there was just the right amount of creamy filling.  I didn't have any pre-made pie crusts, so I used the SUPER easy " No Fail Pie Crust III" on this site (halved to make only 2 crusts - and put them in the fridge until my filling was ready) and it turned out perfect! Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

Update: Made this again last night using two boneless, skinless chicken breasts I had on hand. Didn't use potatoes this time around and therefore only used one bullion cube and one cup of water, since I assumed not as much water would be absorbed with the lack of potatoes. Also added a cup of sliced fresh mushrooms and two frozen crusts this time. Just goes to show you how great and versatile this recipe really is!

This is such a good pot pie.  I have made it 3 times now and need to rate it.  It is the best for left over Turkey. So easy to make.  I use extra potatos and Turkey and also Poultry seasoning.  Very tasty, the whole family loves.

This was incredibly delicious. I followed the recipe almost exactly... except I cooked the potatoes in 3 cups of water, 2 large bouillon cubes.  Once they were almost cooked, I added in a box of frozen mixed veggies. This made a lot of filling, so instead of a pie pan, I used a deep square pyrex dish... the premade pie crust worked fine it it.

The combination of spices is wonderful with turkey.  It smells great baking.  I used with crust recipe for vegetable pot pie (also from this site) and both turned out great.  This would have been a really full pie dish so I put it in the size smaller than a 9x13 pan (rectangle) and it was just right.

This is a fabulous recipe, although I can nitpick the way it is presented. It would be easier if the ingredients list gave measurable quantities of chopped veggies (e.g., one cup, or 1/2 cup) rather than "two small onions" or "two carrots diced" or "three small potatoes peeled and cubed." My small onion or potato might be different from yours. Besides, to make life easy, I buy celery and onions, etc., already chopped, and I had to guess how much of each to use. I substituted fresh chopped cilantro for the dried parsley and also used chicken broth rather than water and chicken cubes, and all of the pie pans I own or prepared crust bottoms I could find in the store were 9 inch rather than 10, but otherwise I followed the recipe precisely and it was delicious.  Also, I doubled the recipe, made two pies which I baked at the same time, and froze one of them for future use.

Everyone in my house loved this recipe! It is the best pot pie I have ever had. The only change I made was to add 4 cups of turkey instead of 3. Will definitely use this on a regular basis.

Perfect pot pie! I've done it twice now, once with turkey and once with chicken... easy and yummy with homemade pie crust.

This was really good!  I used my own turkey stock and used frozen mixed veg (broc, cauli and carrots).  I also took the suggestion of another reviewer and used a can of cream of chicken soup and I used half and half instead of milk, and was able to forego the flour/roux sauce since it was think, saucy, and creamy.  This also made it possible to make it all in one pan.  I added all the liquids at once, threw in the potatoes and frozen veg, and when they were cooked, added the turkey.  Yum!  This will now be a Boxing Day tradition!

It sounded good at a first scan, but as were putting it together, I saw that it called for Parsley (Lots) and Oregano.  I hemmed and hawed on this, but finally followed the recipe, assuming that the author had some idea of what they were doing, I was wrong, the Oregano and Parsley have no place in a turky pot pie and the only flavors that could be discerned was these very wrong ingredients.    The lowest It will allow is 1 star, but it deserves -10.

I am very, very impressed with this recipe, the results were outstanding - my husband said it was almost better than the Christmas dinner itself!! I made my own recipe rough puff pastry for the pie crust - fresh pastry always works better than store bought. The only change I made was that I had some very thick leftover gravy from christmas dinner so I subsituted it for the bouillion cubes and water. As it was so thick I also omitted the milk and flour stage and put the turkey into the pot with the vegetables once they were cooked and just added 1/4 cup of light cream - delicious - thank you for sharing it.

Really good recipe for Turkey Pot Pie!.. It took a bit of work, but so much better to do a scratch recipe than use the MSG canned ones!... I pre-baked the bottom crust about 8 minutes and I used my leftover turkey from Thanksgiving and added some sage because I like the flavor in pot pies... This recipe will actually feed 4 hungry people with two servings each!.. Yum!~

EASY ... and DELICIOUS!!!
I used canned POTATOES and added frozen peas.... consistancy was perfect!
We love this!!! It freezes well too!

EVEN EASIER VERSION -
I sauted small onion in butter, added sliced/drained canned potatoes - sliced canned carrots, 1 cube bullion & 1 or 2 tsp Poultry seasoning.   I then added 2C milk and 1 package of McCormicks Country Gravy - allowed gravy to thicken then added the turkey.  I left it all in my cast iron skillet and topped with a ready made pie crust.  FAST FAST FAST & EASY EASY EASY - DELICIOUS very close to the original version of the recipe!!!!

this recipe was good. although, right after adding the oregano, i thought... i should have added something else - like thyme or savoury or sage - a spice/herb that goes well with turkey. alas, it was too late, and i wasn't a big fan of the oregano taste it had... yet everyone else that tasted it LOVED it. i also replaced some of the milk and chicken stock with cream of mushroom soup - condensed. just a thought. it was also very easy to make. will definitely make again. thank you.

I've made this 3 times this week (once for my sister's family).  This recipe is so good.  I don't bother with a pie crust, I just top it off with homemade buttermilk biscuits and decrease the last baking time by 5 minutes.  The sauce thickens up nicely and the herbs make it so tasty!

I tried to prebake the crust but it only shrunk and I hadn't yet done the homework on baking an empty pieshell. I used homemade turkey broth instead of water and buillion, didnt use celery, added 1/2 cup peas, a handfull of leftover brocolli and cauliflower and topped the pie with leftover mashed potatoes, moistened with 1/2 cup of turkey broth, over a cup of frozen chicken gravy to make sure it was moist enough, and sage, thyme and rosemary instead of oregono and parsley. 

The flavour was really good, next time I'll add more salt and spices and DEFINATELY prebake the crust. Ours was raw and I baked it for almost an hour. We will make this again though, it's a great way to use up any leftovers. Thanks a bunch!

This was very tasty!  Used store bought crusts and, instead of 2 c. water w/ boullion, I used 1.5 c. chicken broth and most of a can of cream of mushroom soup.  I took some reviewers' advice and stuck the bottom crust in for 5 - 10 minutes before filling, cubed everything really small, and kept some chicken gravy handy...which I ended up not using.  Filled with carrots, onions, green beans, and potatoes...thanks for sharing the recipe and suggestions.  This will be a cold weather regular!!!

This pie was very good.  Very nice flavour.  The only downside is the time it takes.  I was all afternoon in the kitchen making this.  It says PREP TIME 20 MINUTES, no way!!!  I even made my pastry the night before.  I made enough for 3 pies so my measurements were not accurate but pies turned out very tasty.  The only change I made was the addition of a can of peas and some dried basil.  I would definitely make this again but not for a while I hope!!!

I've made other "pot pies" before and was a little afraid that the filling would fall out into the pan once I took a piece out.  Amazingly it all stayed together and every piece was perfectly "pie-like".  You would think that since it all stayed together it would have been dry but that was NOT the case.  I used Pillbury refrigerated pie crust dough.  This must be the original pot pie recipe that all the other pot pie recipes have since tried to copy but failed ;-) - WONDERFUL!!

Great recipe - I sauteed the veggies in bacon fat, because I had just cooked bacon for a different recipe (and pork fat rules!)  I followed other reviewers recommendation to let the mixture cool before putting it in the crust.  Excellent down home food!

We found this pretty good. Only change I made was using one stalk of celery instead of two and one carrot instead of two. Tasted really good on one of our chilly Michigan nights. Thanks for sharing.

I enjoyed making this recipe.  I diced up my potatoes to the same size as green peas, which I added for color.  I made my pot pies in individual casserole dishes too.  My family really liked this recipe.  Of course, my husband liked it even better the second day.  I tend to prefer saucey pot pies and would be apt to add a can of cream of chicken soup for more gravy.  I will make this again.

I made this recipe last night with left over Thanksgiving turkey, it was wonderful.  The only change that I made was to use Swanson's chicken flavor booster instead of bullion cubes.  I used Molly's perfect pie crust recipe and it was awesome also!  Thank you for a great recipe.

This is a great recipe.  I doubled it....and it filled 4 pie crusts.  You can opt for less calories and place crust only on top, just makes for messier serving! :)

I made this dairy-free for my daughter.  I used rice milk instead of milk and I sauteed the veggies in olive oil instead of butter.  I used homemade turkey stock instead of chicken bouillon.  It was still amazing!  This was a great dinner!

This was very good. I made a few changes...instead of using chicken bouillon I used the homemade turkey stock.  Boil the carcass and bones after picking all of the meat off of the turkey and put in pot, cover with water and throw in leftover gravy, carrots, onions - anything for taste.  Simmer all afternoon and then drain the broth off the bones into another pot.  Put in fridge and then, when the fat hardens on the top, scrape it off and discard.  Now you have a great stock - a REAL and healthy alternative to high-sodium bouillon.  The taste is completely different and much, much better.  After I added stock and simmered the Pot Pie mixture, I added mushrooms and peas.  I also added summer savory (sage) and rosemary and thyme.  I did not add a flour mixture.  I then made a home-made biscuit recipe and rolled it thin, placed the pot pie mixture into a casserole dish when the mixture was hot, then put the biscuit mixture on top and baked in the oven at 350 for about 15 minutes.  I made biscuits with the leftover biscuit dough and served with a salad.  Awesome.

Made this last night with minor changes - absolutely the best pot pie I've ever eaten! (And I looovve to eat!) My changes were: instead of oregano, I used Bell's seasoning for that real Thanksgiving taste and chicken broth in place of the boullion and water (to which I threw in a bit more salt).  Excellent recipe that I will use forever...

No more tired Thanksgiving leftovers! I did use a slotted spoon for the filling so not to get too soggy of a pie. Thanks for sharing, I look forward to it next year as our new tradition.

Pretty tasty!  Next time I would cut back the potatoes to two, add more turkey, and make more 'sauce'.  It was a little drier than I would have liked, but that is easily remedied.  Great way to use up leftover turkey.

My first attempt at a pot pie was a success!  Deelicious!  The only thing I did differently was to add about 1/2 cup of homemade turkey gravy since I had it in the fridge and wanted to use it up.  The next time I make this I will add more turkey since my potato/turkey ratio was off a bit.  Really great flavor, loved it!

I think this is going to be my traditional meal to make with Thanksgiving leftovers! The flavors were amazing and it was very easy to make!

I was looking for a good base recipe that I could customize to what crazy leftovers we had from last night's Thanksgiving Feast & this was THE place to start.  I had 1/2 box of pre made pie crust in the fridge,so I didn't have to mess with a recipe for crust & just did a latice on top. I used 1 carrot & 1 parsnip & then threw in a handful of green beans & mushrooms & a shallot along with the chopped onion just because I wasn't sure what else to do with them.  I threw in 1/2 a white sweet potato.  All the other measurements, liquid, ratios, spices etc remained the same.  I did have some water that I had boiled my turkey parts in & threw that in there along with the bouillon. I have no imagination when it comes to cooking "off the cuff"...I just wanted to use what I had.  All the measurements were right on.  I think this was pretty Fool Proof which makes it 5 stars in my house.

Made this when I first spotted the recipe.  Made exactly as written for the filling, etc., but substituted a frozen bottom crust and a "roll out" purchased pie crust for the top.  We now make this same pie all winter long when we have leftover chicken or turkey.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very tasty! Definitely pre-bake the bottom crust and cool the filling.  My second time around I used a can of Campbell's Cream of Chicken, and the consistency was definitely better.

This is missing two key ingredients that make my pot pie great......CHEESE and Cream of Chicken soup....give it stick ability......Also the BEST pie crust is store bought crescent rolls for pop pie...they rise pretty...they are great and easy to roll together....

Fabulous pot pie.  My family loved this recipe.  I did add some corn and green beans to give it a little more flavor.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks

It was good, but I have tasted much better.  I prefer mine with more vegetables, it could have used some peas, etc.  Maybe use the mixed vegetable mix and less of the spices.

I made this after Thanksgiving and it's YUMMY!!! I did leave out the potatoes and added a little cream of chicken soup to the turkey mixture. About half a can.  I actually did two variations: the first I made like a traditional pot pie, but put stuffing as the first layer (then poured the turkey mixture over it), and with the remaining mixture (it made too much for my crust) I put it in individual ramekins and used stuffing as the top crust.  Try it, it's sooooo good!!  Top either version with cranberry sauce and oh my, 'gourmet' pot pie!!!  SO GLAD I tried this recipe...I'm making it for Christmas dinner along with my family's favorite side dishes!  Can't wait...

I used this recipe after Thanksgiving to use up the leftover turkey. Everyone I shared it with has loved it and I ended up making four turkey pot pies for family and friends. They can't get enough. My favorite part is combining the flour in the pot with the turkey and milk. I was worried it would be sticky and clumpy but it blends perfectly to make a great consistency in the finished product. One thing I did a little different was to chop up large pieces of the veggies instead of dicing. We like chunky pot pie. The flavor is fantastic! Thanks.

VERY good recipe. I bit dry for my taste but that is easy enough to fix. The only thing I did different was the potatos I had were quite large so I only used two. Instead of fresh carrots I used a corn, carrot and pea frozen mix I had in the freezer. I kept thinking there was no way all of that was going to fit in my deep 9" plate, but it fit perfectly. I added just a touch of sage for a bit more flavor. I will increase the liquid a bit next time for personal taste. Over all a really VERy good recipe. Thanks for posting it!

This was really good. I think next time I will make it with chicken. I did pre cook the bottom crust for 10 min. just to firm it up a bit. other than that I went by the recipe exactly.

My husband loved it!! I made some adjustments. I cut parsley down to 2 tbs. I added frozen peas for a little sweetness.I made it into turkey and dumplings instead of turkey pie, so I added more juice. I increased the water to 3 cups, added 3 boullions, increased the flour and margarine to 4 tbs ea. I had leftover turkey in the freezer. I increased that to 3 cups.  The result was wonderful.....Definitely a keeper.

Thanks for a great basic recipe that any cook can modify based on ingredients on hand.  I had NEVER made any type of pie before today when I tried this recipe to use up my traditional Super Bowl roast turkey. I cheated a little by using the refrigerated pie crust you roll out and just plop in the pie plate.  The result was outstanding !!!   And because the whole dinner is in the oven in a single dish, I could clean up all the kitchen stuff before we sat down to eat.  Super-quick cleanup after dinner.  Thanks again.

My husband and I both said "yum" when we tasted the pot pie.  However, I used chicken and only put on a top crust,which was sufficient and cut down on calories.  P.S.  I add frozen peas and mushrooms.  Do not overcook the potatoes!!!

This is a great recipe. I used 3 cups of turkey, frozen mixed vegetables with the celery and onion and added extra pepper for taste. Also used chicken base instead of the bullion. Also made the pir crust and baked bottom for 10 minutes. This came out great. My family complained that there was not enough! We are a family of 7 so I guess I need to double it next time. Thanks for a great recipe that I will make over and over.

This was very good.  The two men in my house raved!  Instead of leftover turkey, I used chicken.  I had boiled a whole chicken, and used half the meat for the pie.  Instead of boullion, I used the chicken stock I just made, so I needed to add more salt.

I thought there was too much oregano, so next time I'll use a little less, and add some poultry seasoning.  And I should have added peas!

It was very easy because I used Pillsbury pie crusts.

This recipe was great!  My husband and I had never made pot pie before, but this recipe made it very easy.  We used chicken broth and one less potato than the recipe called for.  We will definitely use this one again!

Tasty. I made it just as the recipe said and we loved it! It wasn't too salty and didn't need any other seasoning. Normally my hubby doesn't make it through a meal with out reaching for the Cajon. But not this time! I would also like to try this with different veggies like corn and green beans.

This recipe is great!  My husband, who hates any cream based soup, loved this pot pie since it uses chicken stock.  He said that this is how pot pie is supposed to taste!  So, I'll be making this again using chicken, turkey or beef.

Very good!  My husband really liked it, great way to get rid of some of that extra turkey meat.  I did make a couple of changes, though.  As it was cooking I noticed that there was not going to be much of a sauce (other reviewers noted this as well).  So, I added an extra 2 tablespoons of flour, and 1 tablespoon of butter to step three.  I ended up adding at least a cup and a half of milk, adding extra as needed once I stirred the two mixtures together to get a good consistancy/sauce.  Also, let the filling cool before putting in the crust (I took it off the burner and then rolled my pie crusts out to give it time to cool a little.)  It took longer to cook on the stovetop than the recipe said, next time I will try covering the saucepan at least part of the time to speed up the process. I used the butter flaky pie crust recipie from this site as well-- worked perfectly.

The filling on this is absolutely the most flavorful filling of any pot pie I've ever had. I almost couldn't stay out of it while I was putting everything together! I made my own basic pastry crust, but I added a little garlic and onion powder, with some dried oregano and basil to the flour before I cut in the butter, and let me say, the combination of the savory crust with this amazing filling was out of this world! I am definitely going to break out this recipe for the Christmas ham dinner leftovers and wow the extended family as well.

This was a great recipe!  I doubled it and made 2 pies out of it (one I froze).  The recipe works well doubled also.  I think next time I may add a bit more salt to the mixture and brush the top of the pie with an egg wash before baking.  Great recipe, thanks!

This recipe was very good.  I made a few changes to the recipe; I first baked the pie shell to avoid a soggy crust; I did not use celery because I did not have any, but did use some frozen peas and corn.  I also substitued chicken broth instead of the water with the chicken bouillon other than that I followed the directions exactly.  My pie came out delicious-a nice pie FULL of turkey and all the trimmings--hubby loves the pie!  Thanks Linda!

Followed recipe in all things, except instead of 2 cups water plus bouillon, used 2 cups of turkey broth since had plenty leftover after Thanksgiving.  Bottom crust came out doughy- next time will follow reviewer's advice and bake bottom crust for 10 min before anything.  Also cooled mixture a bit after thickening and had no problem with mixture being watery.  Brushed top crust with beaten egg for extra golden color- worked out great, looked and tasted good.   However filling came out enough for 2 pies- will either make second pot pie with extras or, might just make some rice and pour over it, like a "turkey a la king" meal.  Very yummy taste though, will make again.

I followed pretty much everything except I went with the gravy mix in place of the boullion cubes, and added water because of the previous reviews and it seemed to need it. It turned out awesome! I'm going to try it next time with portobellos in place of turkey for my daughter, can't wait to fix again. My husband absolutely loved it, and it was great the next day for lunch! Thanks!!

I altered it by using home-made turkey broth, no milk, and leftover gravy.  We fight over it, I think I'll have to start making 2 at at time!

Very tasty. My husband loved it. I didn't feel it was necessary to cook the meat and veggies in a separate pot since I was using leftovers. It was a real time saver. I also added pie crust to make it a little more savory.

Very, very dry.  Next time I will only use 1 potato.  They absorbed all of the moisture out of the filling.  Needed to bake 25 minutes longer than noted.  Disappointed because I really love turkey pot pie.

Made exactly as directed except that I subbed homemade chicken broth. I also used previous suggestions & cooled the filling for 10-15 minutes before filling the pastry. The pie came out perfectly golden and delicious, and what a great-looking result for my first-ever homemade pot pie! Thanks so much-- will use again and again.

Excellent!  Just remember to increase your thickening mixture if you add extra broth!  Made with Flaky Butter Crust from this site and my husband said it was the best pot pie he's ever had!

This was awesome!!  I added thyme instead of the oregano and it was loved by all.  Thanks so much!!  I baked the pie crust for about 10 minutes before filling the crust and will probably do it for more like 15-20 next time to get the crust more cooked on the bottom.  We loved it regardless and I actually found a recipe that makes me enjoy leftover turkey!!  LOL

I tried this recipe tonight.  Excellent!!!!!  Others stated that it was dry and the time and effort was somewhat extended.  Not at all!!  Extremely easy to make; ready in no time at all.  And as far as dry, totally untrue.  I can only say that if others had issues, it could very well be that they are use to the kind that’s purchased frozen, has more gravy than veggies and meat, with a prep to dinner table time of 30-35 minutes.  If you appreciate home cooking, this is it!!  This was an excellent recipe and I will definitely make again and again.

This was delicious, even my husband who is a picky eater enjoyed it.  I did add a packet of turkey gravy to the mix.  I also used a 9inch premade pie crust.  I added a handful of baby carrots, and 2 celery stalks, & 2 potatoes..It was excellent.

This recipe was very yummy, although time consuming.  It took me a long time (but I had to make a pie crust too- I used Oil Pie Crust from this site).  I used leftover diced chicken from Roast Sticky Chicken- Rotisserie Style, also on this site.  I used one cup of veggie broth instead of the boullion and a carton of natural chicken gravy in place of the milk and other liquids.  This made way too much for my pie dish- I also filled two ramekins with the mix and will make a crust for them later.  Very tasty, but not sure I'd make it again because of how much time it took.

Excellent recipe- you will be pleased making this one.  First pot pie ever and it was great. Cheated and used refrigerated pie crusts. Used only one potato and added 3/4 cup of peas instead.  I also decreased the parsley to 2 tablespoons- perfect!  Next time I'll try individual pot pies to avoid dishing out big sloppy slices.

I made this for dinner tonight with chicken instead of turkey.  It was very good and like other reviewers suggested I added more chicken stock and a 1/2 cup of peas.  I felt that there was too much parsley in this recipe and in future I will add 2 tbls. instead of three.  I also used soy milk instead of regular milk.

I have made this dish twice, and it's been a hit both times.  I added frozen mixed vegetables, fresh parsley, a touch of cayenne pepper, garlic, and more liquid (the first time was a little dry).  I also used frozen Marie Callendar's Pie Crust (it's better than mine).  It pleased even a tough critic like my mother-in-law (who doesn't consider herself a "pot-pie" person)!  Thanks!

Sorry, I was very disappointed with this recipe.  Maybe it was because I used dark meat.  It tasted very bland and doughy. I don't think this one is a keeper!  Thanks anyway!

My family did not care for this recipe.  It was the first pot pie recipe I'd ever tried and it wasn't juicy enough.  I also think it needed something. Also all the pie pastry recipes were for 9 in pies, so I had a ton of leftover filling.

I loved this. I didn't have carrots or celery so I subbed them for a can of peas which i added after the pitatos were cooked and celery salt. no pie crust either so I put it in a baking pan and rolled a can of Cresent rolls on top. It was delicious and everyone in my family loved it including my picky 2 year old.

Really good use of leftover turkey.  I made some changes for personal taste but it would be fine as is.  More turkey, more carrots, no potatoes, added peas, broth instead of boullion.

I made some adjustments based on other user reviews and this turned out wonderful.  I added some green beans, used 3 green onions instead of regular onion, 3/4 cup milk instead of 1/2 and added a half a can of cream of mushroom soup.  2 potatoes instead of 3 and I cooked it for about 15 minutes longer.  My whole family loved it and ate seconds.  It was a great way to used the thanksgiving turkey! Using the extra milk and soup gave it plenty of sauce.

I really appreciated that this recipe calls for all fresh ingredients and no canned, condensed soup is needed. I used a Butterball frozen turkey roast and I did reduce the amount of basil called for to 1/2 tsp and swapped the flour for corn starch. This was a great pot pie and was enjoyed by the whole family.

As many reviewers have already stated, you may add or adjust seasonings and ingredients to your taste. However, the basis of this recipe is delicious! I had reservations about so much parsley but went ahead and used the amount listed in the recipe.  I also added about 1/4 tsp poultry seasoning, 1/2 tsp fresh chopped rosemary, 1/2 tsp kosher salt, 1/4 tsp fresh ground pepper and omitted the oregano.  Increased the amount of turkey to about 2-1/2 cups.  I used 2 tablespoons of left over gravy and substituted 2 cups chicken broth in place of the water and chicken bouillon.  I also increased the milk to about 3/4 cup.  Left the amount of flour the same.  I only had one pie crust and the amount seemed too much for a 10" pie plate so I used a 9 x 11 glass dish with one pie crust on top.  Next time I might not leave it in on 425 for 15 minutes because the crust got a little too brown...but that's just my oven.  That's why I love allrecipes.com....you have tried and true recipes and informative  and creative reviews.  Thank you to the original poster and to all the reviewers for sharing!

I thought this was just ok. Like others said it needs more water/chicken stock than the recipe calls for. I also found it quite bland. I think sage, Rosemary, thyme might work better than the parsley and oregano. The one good thing about the recipe is that I had everything on hand. If your family is not real adventurous when it comes to eating this is a safe choice. It tastes ok, just not enough flavor for my taste.

Followed exactly - used No Fail Pie Crust recipe and it turned out great. As a personal preference, I will add more liquid next time as mine came out a bit dry.

I have made this recipe numuerous times and each time it comes out really nice.  I have only used chicken.  If you don't have pre-cooked chicken (or turkey), and you have to cook the chicken, poach it in the 2 cups of broth (with parsley and some poultry seasoning if you have it) called for in the recipe and use that same broth when you mix it into the sauteed vegetable.  You don't have to peel the potatoes, just cut them a little smaller if left unpeeled.  Also, I definately recommend baking the bottom crust first - until it's golden brown.  Then let the filling and the bottom crust cool a bit before pouring filling in.  I brush egg yolk on top crust before baking and it comes out a rich brown. You can use egg white if you just want a sheen on the crust  Don't forget your steam vents on the top crust.  Great recipe.

Really good! but you need to let the filling cool so that  when you serving it will not fall apart on you.

What a great way to deal with those post-holiday Turkey leftovers. I didn't have any chicken bouillon, so I improvised with cream of mushroom soup, extra salt, and added in some garlic and onion powder. Even after all of that, the filling was still the tiniest bit "blah" so I mixed in about a half cup of leftover turkey gravy (made from the turkey drippings), and added more veggies (frozen corn and peas). I also ended up having to bake the pot pie longer than the recipe calls for. Still, the filling was the perfect amount of creamy, without being runny. The bottom crust could've been more crisp--I might pre-cook that a bit next time--but the store-bought crust held up well. This definitely does make enough to feed 8 people, and I ended up with almost half a pot pie leftover. Next time, I might halve the recipe and use actual pie pans, or even make individual servings that I can freeze. Oh, as a warning, I tried reheating part of the pot pie in the oven set at 350 and, while the top of the crust was still crisp, the flavor of the pie wasn't great--it was good, but not great--and the bottom crust was a gluey mess. Still, I'd make it again; if only to try it with the chicken bouillon included.

LOVED IT!!! Original recipe was great. I didnt have enough pie crust for top and bottom, so I used another review's idea and topped with stuffing. That was the only change.

This is a stellar pie!  A real masterpiece.  I just popped my second one into the oven, using leftover Christmas turkey.  This is a firm pie that doesn't lose its shape or run all over the plate when you cut it. And oh my, is it delicious!  I don't know where Linda learned to cook, but she's a real master!  You should try this recipe.

This was a great recipe! I didn't use onion or parsley, but I threw in some frozen peas. I added potatoes with the rest of the vegetables except the peas (I mixed them in at the last possible moment). I used about 2 cups turkey and just one large potato. I brushed the crust with an egg wash before baking. I did taste the oregano a lot, so I would half the amount unless you're fond of it.

PERFECTLY AMAZING!  The only changes I made were to use fresh parsley because I happened to have it on hand and to include the celery greens along with the celery.  This recipe made me enjoy eating turkey, something I can't usually say.  I am not one to give all 5 stars to a recipe, but this one definitely deserves it.

This is a great way to use up left over turkey (and for unused pie crusts)!! This was the first pot I made and I was a bit nervous, but dang, this si fantastic!! I'm freezing some turkey so a few weeks from now I can make it again! This was easy enough to make during a crazy busy Monday evening! I did not have oregano (lame, I know) so I just use Italian seasoning. I also threw in some left over corn. Soo good!

This was so good. I altered the veggies to use up the rest of some of our Thanksgiving feast. I also thought it wasn't thick enough for my taste so I added a a few tablespoons or so of left over turkey gravy. If you don't have any and want to thicken it up some cream of chicken soup would work as well.

This was a wonderful way to use the leftover dark meat from our Thanksgiving turkey! I only made a couple additions to this recipe. I added close to a cup of bias-cut sugar snap peas when sauteeing the veggies, and added only about the equivalent of one carrot because that is what I had. I also had leftover fat-free half & half, so I used that in place of the milk. After it was all combined, I added about 1/2 teaspoon of poultry seasoning and it was just about perfect. I did pre-bake the crust for about ten minutes, then let it cool before adding the slightly cooled filling and it turned out wonderfully.

I make this dish with either turkey or chicken and enjoy it both ways.  Try adding fresh or frozen green beans, corn and peas for additional flavor. This is a terrific dish for a chilly evening and makes an outstanding leftover.

Do not alter anything! I followed the recipe almost exactly (added a few peas at the end) and this was the best pot pie I have ever tasted. The sauce turned out perfectly, tasty, thick and creamy, much better than a canned soup filling. Delicious!

This is the easiest and best turkey/chicken pot pie I have ever made. I use store bought crust to cut down on time, turns out great each time I have made it. I usually make a double batch and freeze the second pie for later.

Mine came out perfect.  I even added more as I was cooking the filling so I was able to make 3 pies.  I made the top crust from scratch but used a frozen pie crust for the bottom to ensure a good shell.  great recipe!

Fantastic! I used frozen leftover Thanksgiving turkey and was happy to find a perfect recipe for it! Very hearty, filling, and absolutely delicious! For the crust I used the "Pastry for Double-Crust Pie" recipe on this site. I was very happy to find it wasn't too runny - the leftovers never made the crust soggy in the fridge! Remember the bouillon is pretty salty in itself - you may not need to add any additional salt for seasoning. I think this pot pie would be fantastic with pretty much any meat!

I loved this recipe,  I only put a top crust on so save on fat and calories.  I used leftover turkey from Thanksgiving, and the broth from roasting it instead of the bouillon cubes and water, and it turned out wonderful.  I was thinking of using the same recipe for turkey stew.

My husband gives this a 5, I give it a 4. Easy and yummy recipe.  I prefer a saucier pot pie, hence my four stars.  My husband, who doesn't like pot pie, gobbled it up and wants me to make it again. For the first time in my life, I used a premade pie crust. Never again. The flavor and flakiness of a real pie crust outshines the fake one and will add dimension to the recipe.
10/2019 finally found a yummy pre-made pie crust for when I don’t have time to make my own: Wholly Wholesome. They have several varieties including whole wheat and gluten free. I stick to the Traditional pie shell to appease the family.

This was an excellent basic recipe.  I'm sure you could tweak it to your own tastes...but, the only change I made was to 2-3x the amount of turkey (only because I had it and wanted to use it up)--so our pies where very meaty.  The 3T. of parsley seemed a bit much, but, I ended up using the amount called for and glad I did--it worked well in this recipe.  I didn't put a bottom crust on, just top.  I used my easy crust recipe & really liked it for this pie--2 cups flour mixed with 2 t. salt, mix together 1/2 cup veg. oil & 1/4 c. cold milk--use a whip.  Pour onto flour mixture & with a fork bring it all together -- do not over mix or knead.  Put into a ball and cut in half.  Put half between waxed paper and roll out to size of dish.  This crust recipe could not be easier!

I've only made the stew/filling part of this so far, and it is out of this world. My changes: Doubled the recipe; Substituted half the carrots with parsnips; Substituted half the water with leftover gravy and white wine; added a splash extra water; Left out the bullion (the gravy & white wine were plenty of flavor), added chopped fresh thyme; used a mixture of half & half and skim milk instead of milk. This came out so savory and flavorful. The ultimate comfort food. It would be great on its own as a stew. I'm going to bake it tonight in a casserole dish under biscuits for old fashioned pot pie. We'll still have a couple meals worth left over for the freezer.

This hit the spot, exactly what i was looking for! The only thing I did different, was that I didnt have any parsley on hand, so I omitted it, and I used chicken stock instead of the bouillon, which I think gave it a much richer flavor. I also added corn since I had leftovers from Thanksgiving. If I would have had peas, I would have added those since I love peas in my potpies. Next time I may add more liquid so that it doesnt dry out when reheated.  Other reviewers have recommened adding soup to this recipe, but I would not recommend this, its wonderful the way it is. But I am not a fan of the cream soups, so to each thier own. I will definately use this as my go to recipe from now on, it beats my old pot pie recipe by far!! Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this the other night for my family. They loved it. They actually fought over who would get the last piece. They ate everything-vegetables and all. I did reduce the amount of parsley and added sage, rosemary, and thyme. I used chicken stock instead of bullion.

This was pretty good.  Next time I will cut the parsley by half and add some sage, thyme and poultry seasoning.  I also added some salt and pepper, as it tasted a little bland.  I let the filling cool to room temperature before adding it to the crust.  Don't be afraid to pile the filling high when you fill the crust.  I found it "shrunk" while cooking, so my pie was a little flat.

I made this using chicken instead of turkey. I used 2 chicken breasts cubed and it filled 2 deep dish 9" pies. I am not a big "spice" person and to me there was too much parsley. Next time (and there will be a next time) I will only use a tablespoon or two. My husband agreed that the parsley was a bit much and he doesn't like pot pies but he sure loved this one.

Delicious. I baked it in a 9x13 pan and only used a top crust to cut calories, and used extra vegetables as well.  I mixed  3 cups of water with a chicken base and had lots of delicious gravy.  This is a keeper!

Delicious!!!!!  Used stuffing on top instead of top and bottom crust for something different.  Used 2 cups stock instead of bouillon and water.  With stuffing cooked at 350 for 25 min covered with foil and 5 min without foil

I made this recipe, and it turned out alright. The crust was fine, as I followed previous reviews and cooled the filling before pouring it in, and it came out nice and golden brown. The only problem I had with this recipe is that it was extremely bland. It has a lot of potential, but quite frankly I feel like I wasted the last of they turkey that we only have a few times a year. If I make a pot pie from leftovers again, I would definitely try and use more versatile ingredients, maybe use whatever else I had with the turkey (stuffing, anyone?) and try and add some stronger flavors, maybe a bit of bacon, garlic, leeks, and fresh herbs. Four stars for it's potential.

This is very good fixed the way one of the reviews stated, with stuffing on top and no bottom crust but I would try baking it the whole time in a 350 degree oven and maybe tent with foil. My husband hates pot pies and when I told him we were having turkey pot pie he wasn't too thrilled.  Then he saw it come out of the oven and said that wasn't what I expected at all and actually loved it so its a keeper...
I used stock in place of water and bouillon (more flavor can't hurt)

I have been making this recipe for my leftover turkey for over 2 years. It is my husbands absolute favourite. I do substitute homemade stock for the bouillon and water and then have to increase the salt to taste. This is an amazing recipe. The pies also freeze wonderfully.

Delish! I reduced the amount of water/buillon to one cup and added 1/4 cup dry vermouth. I also added a little freshly grated nutmeg to the white sauce.
No one should ever open a can of 'cream of...' soup again!
I used left over stuffing as the bottom crust and puff pastry with an egg wash on top. Yum.

Easy to make.  Used Herb Provencales seasoning, added 2 cups of turkey, left over frozen carrots from the xmas dinner and cut the potatoes really small.  Added chicken broth instead of the boullion.  Also used Pillsbury pie crust from the fridge section.  Super easily and SOOOO good!

Fixed this last night.  Good, but needed more seasoning.  Next time I will add 1/2 teaspoon thyme and sage.  Add 8 ounce sliced mushrooms.  And will use all broth instead of milk.  My husband liked and will definately fix again.  Would be good with leftover chicken, ham or beef (adjusting the spices to the filling)

Too heavy on the onions and needs more turkey/sauce compared to the amount of veggies, but overall very tasty.  I used a premade grocery store brand crust and it was great.

Awesome, 

	I used  a  Pillsbury  roll out pie crust,  and a can of chicken broth to simmer the filling down.
I  also baked the bottom layer of pie crust on 425 degrees for  8 minutes while the filling was cooling. 
I let the filling cool before putting it in. It came out so good!,  It tasted  fantastic. I like to add a little ketchup to mine, I have been eating pot pie’s like that since I was a kid.  Will make again…

I've never made a pot pie before, but this was a great way to use up left over turkey.  I used about 1-1/2c gravy in place of some of the water and bullion and added some poultry seasoning and left over corn.  It was very flavorful and a great dinner for a rainy night.  I will definitely make it again.

If I were a newbie cook, I'd think that I was the reason behind this dish not turning out.  I gave it two stars because it wasn't completely inedible, but I was truly not impressed.  Other reviewers commented on soggy bottom crusts, and some recommended adding a little cornstarch with the liquid.  Heeding that advice, I added the slightest amount of cornstarch.  Really wish that I hadn't.  My pot pie came out so thick and dry.  Blah!  I should have added more liquid instead.  Also, the seasonings were a little weird.  Oregano seems out of place in a pot pie.

I thought this recipe was terrific, everyone loved it. I took the advice of another reviewer and I used 3 cups of turkey, 1 packet of turkey gravy and 1 cup of water and used the same amount off all ingredients. I thought the extra turkey gravy really gave the pie that creamy turkey pot pie flavor, not dry at all. I also used the pastry recipe Pastry for Double-crust Pie.

This was my first attempt at making any type of meat pie and I can honestly say this was absolutely wonderful!  My husband and 4 year old both agreed that this was a hit and a new family meal.  Thanks for sharing this one!

We make this recipe pretty often and it gets thumbs-up from the whole family, including our picky three-year-old. We often omit the baking and pie crust, and just serve the filling poured over slices of bread (like a hot open-faced sandwich). It doubles easily, if you have a lot of leftover turkey. :) Thank you for posting this!

Oops it got cut off...
or until crust is golden brown. 
This made enough for 2 pies, so one is in the freezer for an easy weeknight meal!  I just stick it frozen, in the oven at 350 for 1 hr!

This is my first time making this recipe, and I can't tell you how pleased I am with how it turned out.  I didn't use the milk since I have a DD with a dairy allergy, so I subed almond milk with ghee (clarified butter).  Plus I minced some garlic and added a can of peas 'n carrots along with the fresh vegetables.  If I could give ten stars I would! Great recipe...

Yummy.  To cut fat and cholesterol, and have one less dirty pan to wash:  dissolve 1.5 T cornstarch into milk; stir turkey into pan with cooked vegetables; bring back to low boil;  slowly add cornstarch mixture; cook and stir until thickened.  I sauteed the vegetables in vegetable oil instead of butter and using the cornstarch means that the additional 2T butter isn't needed.  Big cut in saturated fat and cholesterol.  I didn't miss the butter, but I haven't made this with butter, so maybe it would taste better, but the end result was very good.  On the servings, I used a 9.5" pie plate.  I don't see this serving eight hungry adults...since it includes protein, starch, and veggies, one-eighth of this pie with a side salad doesn't seem like a lot of food.

This recipe was yummy although a little time consuming. I chopped the potatoes, celery, carrots and turkey the night before so that when I got home from work, dinner wouldn't take too long. The part that took the longest was waiting for the veggies to get soft, and waiting for the mixture to boil. I added about 1 tsp of poultry seasoning and just skipped the parsley and oregano all together. I cooked the bottom crust first in the preheated oven for about 10 minutes and THEN I added the filling. I would make this again although I may just boil the veggies in the bouillon mixture instead of cooking it in butter.

It was a great dinner!  My husband loved it.  The only thing I changed was that I used sweet potatoes and mixed skim milk with fat free half and half.  The sweet potatoes were a great addition.

My husband isn't fond of Turkey Pie but I thought I'd try this recipe with our l/over Thanksgiving turkey.  It was very good and he's now a Turkey Pie fan!
I did the prep & clean up in the early afternoon and then put it all together about an hour before we were ready to eat.

Everyone I've ever served this recipe to LOVED it.  I've even had friends leave out the oregano because of an alergy - and it was still awesome!  I think the way the vegetables are cooked with the orgeano and parsley at the begining is the key to this recipe.  I love it!

This is a fantastic recipe - the only change I made was to substitute thyme for the oregano just because I like the flavor better - I used pre-made chicken broth rather than the water & boullion but I don't think that had any impact on the recipe.

YUM!  i made this for dinner tonight and it was fabulous!  i added a can of mushrooms and a few other spices as well as an extra 1/2 cup of water to the vegetable mixture.  i still can't believe how great this was we'll be making it a LOT!  it did take me about 2 hours to prepare from prep to dinner table but it was totally worth it!

This took a bit of time (chopping, dicing, etc.) but it was all fresh and was worth it.  It looked dry before I put it in the pie, so I added about 1 cup of leftover giblet gravy.  It was the perfect consistency.  Instead of making a big pie, I used oven-proof salad bowls and only topped it off with the crust.  Personal pot pies!  I Also only used 2 potatoes and doubled the turkey.

Extremely good! A great way to use up leftover turkey. The only thing I did differently was to add some frozen green peas and a touch of half & half to the milk and flour mixture to make it a bit creamier. Overall, it was excellent as it was, but I just tweaked it to our personal taste. Will use this recipe again for sure!

This is my husband's favorite dish.  Great way to use up leftover turkey from the holidays or special occasions.  Instead of bouillon and water, I use chicken stock for added flavor.

What a great way to use up Thanksgiving leftovers!

We loved it so much that I've started buying pre-cooked cubed turkey- I just use the Pillsbury pie crust.  This is a regular in my rotation now...thanks for the great recipe!!

Very Tasty but a little dry.  We poured Turkey Gravy over top and it was perfect.  I added peas to this and used the pillsbury roll out crust which was suprisingly flaky buttery good.

Everyone thought this tasted great!!!  I used Pillsbury roll out crust which helped save on time.  I also added fresh mushrooms, garlic, peas & some poultry seasoning and it turned out wonderful.  I took advice from some others and prebaked my pie crust for almost 10 minutes.  Thanks for the recipe, I will make this again!!

This serves as a really good base recipe.  I used pillsbury premade pie crusts to save on time.  I used fresh sage and rosemary leftover from Turkey Day.  I added mushrooms to the veggies and lots of garlic seasoning (we like lots of flavor and others said this recipe was bland).  I didn't have bouillon so I used canned stock and leftover gravy.  It turned out great!  A little dry for my liking but my picky husband said it was perfect.  I had gravy on the side.

This is a delicious pot pie, truely comfort food.  I used frozen diced potatoes, and frozen peas & carrots instead of fresh carrot.  I baked it in a square 8' glass dish to make serving easier.  It's a keeper!

I made this the day after our thanksgiving dinner and my husband has made me make this three times since (within a three week period).  I also made this for a dinner party and people asked to take home the leftovers. 'Nuff said.

Didn't have celery or carrots, but used peas, this pie is very good, never thought I could make a good pot pie, but this is delicious, Only thing it seems that I need more salt, but that is why it says salt taste.

I did not have leftover turkey, so I used canned, which gave this a nice balance of light and dark meat.  Delicious for dinner!

Turned out really well for my first time. Topped with cornbread instead of pastry and used 2c. (1 can) of Swanson reduced sodium/fat chicken broth in place of the water and bouillon. Baked in a 8" square stainless pan @ 400 for about 20-25 minutes. Oh yeah and I also subbed in chicken for the turkey.

Wonderful! I will make that again and again. I used the "Basic Flaky Pie Crust" posted by Stephanie and it was the best I ever had! The combination ist just wonderful.

We smoked a turkey the day before we made this and the leftovers really added to the flavor.  I also doubled the sauce and decreased the parsley.  I added fresh garlic when the veggies where sauteing and some peas.  I didn't have a 10" pie pan and so this ended up making 2 9" pies using a single crust.  I topped it with stuffing drizzled with butter at the point when the oven was turned down to 350 degrees.  It's a very good recipe.

This is a great way to use leftover turkey.  I did change a couple of things.  I use a refrigerated premade piecrust, I omitted celery and potatoes and used grated carrots.  I also added about 1 cup of frozen corn.  It came out perfect.  It is a great family favorite and definitely a comfort food.

Very good- my family really liked it.  Next time I may save the turkey carcass and try to make broth out of it so it tastes more like turkey instead of chicken.

My family really liked this recipe.  I didn't have the carrots, so we did without and it still tasted great.  I did follow the advice of another reviewer and added a packet of gravy.  We used "homestyle gravy" instead of turkey gravy, though.  Also, I didn't have the boullion so I just used a can of chicken broth from my pantry.  It seemed to work well.  I will definitely use this again.  Thanks for giving me something to make with our leftover turkey!

I've tried several pot pie recipes and this was the best yet.  I liked that the filling was thick enough to hold it's shape inside the crust and serve on a plate rather than in a bowl.  Like other reviewers, I reduced the potatoes to two and added a cup of peas.  Chicken broth works well in place of the water and bouillon.

Great pot pie! I changed it slightly by substituting 2 pkgs. of turkey gravy mix for the flour and milk. For step #3 I made one pkg. according to directions, added the turkey (2 cups), then added that mixture to the vegetable mixture. After that was mixed, I sprinkled one more pkg. of turkey gravy mix on the turkey/vegetable mixture, stirred it until completely incorporated, then let it cool down before putting in the pie crust. I think the added flavor of the turkey gravy mix really did the trick for us.

Great recipe. The only alteration I made to it was I used Grand's Flaky biscuits for the topping, instead of another crust. Well worth the work to prepare this dish!

The day after Thanksgiving we invited relatives back for leftovers, but wanted to have something freshly made. This recipe was perfect. Since we had other carbos, we substituted 1.5 cups peas for the potatoes. It was a hit. We even botched the cooking time and it still was more than half eaten with all the other food we served 7 guests.

WHAT A HIT! THE WHOLE FAMILY LOVED IT, ESPECIALLY MY 4 YEAR OLD. I MADE ENOUGH FILLING TO MAKE 2 PIES AND I AM GLAD I DID.  THIS RECIPE WILL BE A  NEW YEAR EVE TRADITION FROM NOW ON!  IT WOULD BE GOOD EVEN AS A SOUP!  VERY TASTY!  HUMMMM!

Although I don't normally rate recipes, I felt compelled to do so for this one.  This is a foolproof recipe.  Everyone loved it.  I did cheat with the pie crust. I used store-bought frozen deep dish pie crusts.  I used one of the pie crusts to make the top of the pie.  It was delicious!

Loved it!  Saved some calories by eliminating the pie crust and serving with roles instead.  Serve with pepper on the table.  I'd add a photo, but it's all gone!

Great recipe. I made little pies for the freezer for the hubby! I did add extra spices. I cooked it in a pot, and tasted it a few times before putting it into the tins. Thanks for a great recipe

This recipe is  awesome. The only thing I found odd is using chicken bouillon in a turkey recipe. You can use turkey gravy instead; add after cooking veggies

I had a little too much liquid and second the need to let the filling cool first.  I also used sage and thyme with just a little tarragon, as I don't think oregano goes with poultry.  Otherwise I loved it!

Absolutely love this! Should have cooked a little longer to get the sauce to thicken more but the taste is simply wonderful. I used a pound of ground turkey instead as I didn't have a cup of turkey lying around in the fridge. Great comfort food material.

This turned out great! Except I really changed it up because I didn't feel like having two crusts. So I just threw the turkey mixture into a casserole dish and topped it with a thawed frozen pastry, put a couple of slits in to let the steam out. So good with half the calories of pastry.

Delicious recipe! But with a few modifications. My picky 6,5 and 2 year old looooved it and my husband ate half the pie himself! 

First, I used the juices I saved from roasting the turkey along with 2 cups of Campbell's " chicken stock first" instead of water. Because of the flavourful juices I used I didn't even need the chicken bouillon. I also used fresh baby carrots (about 15 of them) instead of frozen and 3 stalks of celery and only 1 large potatoe (3 would have been way too much!) I also only used half the amount of parsley. 1 1/2 tbsps was plenty!  I baked the pie using Pillsbury frozen pie crusts which was great but next time I will go the extra mile and do a home made crust. 

This recipe is definitely a keeper! I'll use it after every turkey dinner and I am looking forward to trying out some chicken pot pies with this recipe.

This a great easy recipe - I used frozen deep dish pie shells and let them warm up while making the filling - one for the bottom and one for the top.
In addition to the ingredient list, I added in about 3 cloves of diced garlic, a handful of diced mushrooms and used 1c. table cream instead of 1/2 c. milk to make it a bit thicker and richer. (But it meant we needed a bit more chicken stock than the 2 c.) It could have used even a bit more chicken stock to made the sauce a bit creamier and more saucy - but depends on if you like your pie runny or stiff.

This is an outstanding recipe, perfect for holiday leftovers!!! And easy to make also. I added a 1/2 bag of frozen peas and just let them defrost in a bowl and added the to the turkey concoction right before I added it to the crust. I almost did it with a refrigerated pie crust, but the crust is seriously the best part of a pot pie, so I made a butter pie crust. It only took an extra time, was so amazing, and showcased all of the flavor perfectly.

Great recipe. I make a simple Bisquick crust, following the package directions for biscuits then rolling it out to form a large enough piece to line the inside of a deep dish pie plate and a 2nd as a top.

I'm not a huge fan of pot pies in general, but thought this one was good. I'd make it again. I only used a single crust on top because I needed to freeze it for a few weeks and then reheated. It worked out perfectly to use just one crust and freeze it with the crust unbaked, then defrost it in the oven and bake until the crust was golden.

I've made this twice now, first time was word for word and we enjoyed it. The second time I added ground sage and took the water down to 1 cup. In place of the second cup I did a can of cream of mushroom and wow--almost like my mom's. It's a keeper!!

This has to be the best pot pie I have ever made! It has so much flavor and is very easy to make. I made it while my in-laws were over for dinner and the loved it! Next time I think I will try it with chicken. I can't wait to make it again!

This was very tasty and was a great way to use up Thanksgiving leftovers! I used two cups of chicken broth instead of water and boullion cubes a mix of seven small red potatoes and Yukon Golds because that is what we had on hand. I left the skin on when chopping the potatoes. I also added a half cup of frozen peas to the broth mixture when the potatoes were done because we like peas in our pot pies. Otherwise I followed the recipe as written and will make it again.

Just tried this recipe for the first time, delicious. My Family just loved it. I took the suggestions from others and increaded the milk to 1 cup and used 2 cups of chicken broth instead of bullions. Other than that i did not change anything else. will make this again and again. Next time is beef instead of turkey. Thank you for this recipe.

I used a good cup more turkey, a bit more potato, a bit less carrot and no bouillon cubes (to cut down on salt).  Simple adjustments to suit our tastes.  Otherwise it was a real hit!  and a definite 'make again.'

Love this recipe.  After Thanksgiving I use left over turkey (if there is some) and make small turkey pot pies and freeze them.  AS a small pot pie they cook up great.

4 1/2 stars!!! This was so easy and tasted great!  The only changes I made were I used 2 tablespoons of parlsey and will probably only use 1 1/2 next time, added a little bit of garlic powder and a tad more bouillon.  I also used fat free half & half but added extra milk as well.   Next time I will use my crust saver so the edges do not brown too much.  Over all, great, easy recipe I will use again!

This was a good basic recipe that is easy to add your own twist.  I was surprised with the amount of parsley that was called for but decided to go for it and it worked well.  I did add about 1/4 tsp of thyme and ground sage each which I think livened it up a bit.  I did an egg wash of half and half with a yolk on the crust which really made it nice looking.  Though next time I might just consider making this with a top crust only as it is very rich.

Delicious! I have used this recipe a few times with leftover turkey from a roasted turkey and it's sooo good. The first time I made it, I thought it was a little bit dry, so now I add a little extra milk and a big spoon full of gravy to the turkey/milk/flour mixture and it makes it even better! It's just as good with chicken.

I used this receipe with Thanksgiving leftover turkey. Was delicious! Added some peas and corn to the filling as well. Also made with minced turkey - which tasted good, but not as visually appealing as thick pieces. The only issue I had was the pie crusts - definitely makes all the difference, so buy or make a good one! I'd recommend a crisp layered pastry crust.

I just made this tonight for dinner and it was good but kinda dry.  I followed the recipe all the way except I used 1 can of chicken broth and a store bought crust.  It wasn't very saucy so next time I make this I will add some turkey gravy or cream of chicken soup.  It was fairly simple to make and I had enough filling for 2 pies.

Great pie. Only had 9 in. crusts, and this recipe made about 1 1/2 pie's worth of those. I ended up adding another 3/4 cup of turkey to the mix and making it an even 2 pies. The recipe as-is seemed kinda thin on actual turkey at the end, so adding more at the end made it more of a turkey pie and less a potato pie with turkey flavoring. My potatoes took about 10 min to cook in step 2. To avoid gluey crust syndrome, I brushed egg white on the bottom crust before putting the filling in, and I let the filling cool 15 min after it was done cooking.

This was my first time ever making or having a pot pie. I have Celiac disease, so gluten is out, but I found a great gluten free crust recipe and decided to give this a try. My husband has problems with dairy, so I try to cut back where I can. I used canola oil and vanilla almond milk instead of the butter and milk. I was worried that the sweetness of the almond milk would clash with the rest of the ingredients, but it turned out fabulously! I think the sweet balanced out the savory flavors and made it taste unique and delicious. My husband said it was the best pot pie he had ever had! Thanks so much for this recipe!

I really liked this recipe. I cheated and used store bought pie crust because I didn't have time to make a homemade crust (made this dish after a lonnnnnng day at work). Next time I will omit the oregano. I'm not a big fan unless it's in Italian food. Other than that... I liked it.

A wonderful recipe!  The key to the filling flavor is the butter and oregano.  I also added 3 cloves of minced garlic to the mix as well as some frozen mixed vegetables.  I didn't have any leftover turkey, so I went to the grocery store and purchased a rotisserie chicken.  I carved out the breast meat and used that as my diced turkey.  It was wonderful!  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

The whole family loved this! It made enough for two meals and it was nearly as good the second day. I made it with store bought pie crusts and it turned out fabulous and flaky. I didn't have celery so I added extra potatoes. I also didn't have parsley so I added some basil and cilantro. Can't wait to make it again!

Great Recipe. Perfect use of the leftover thanksgiving turkey. Made the crust from scratch. Add peas and subtract potatoes if you like.

My husband, who doesn't like pot pies, ate this when I made it with our leftover thanksgiving turkey, as well as leftover again 2 days later! He wants me to KEEP this recipe and agreed it would be good to have with company! So that alone makes this a success for us. I made a homemade pie crust for the first time in ages, and it was good, but for convenience sake I might use the refrigerated next time. I did make a couple of changes due to our preferences- I left out the onion, reduced the carrots to 1, reduced the potatoes to 2 because that's all we had, and added some frozen corn. The creamy part in this has a wonderful flavor without taking away from the veggies- much better than store bought pot pies. I will make this again!

I used Herbes de Provence as the seasoning which turned out great.  When using a prepared refrigerator pie crust, make your pie and set in a cold oven.  Set the temperature to 450 and let bake for about 15 min. Then reduce the oven to the suggested temperature setting.   This works well with any kind of pie you are baking.  The bottom crust is never soggy.

Soooo yummy and easy to make.  I did increase the water by 1/2 cup and added 1/4 teaspoon of sage and 1/8 teaspoon of dried thyme and 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder.  This made it even more tasty.  Thanks for the recipe :)

I've only made about 10 different Chicken or Turkey Pot pies in my lifetime, and have to say that i have finally found a recipe worthy of keeping...my only changes were, that I used about 2 cups of turkey and the broth from my turkey baked the day before left over.  I also used a boxed crust mix from pillsbury for my crust. I would also say that this would probably feed 10-12 people easily.

Despite semi burning the carrot and celery mixture and using beef stock by accident this recipe still turned out quite decent. 
I did use other suggestions of cooling the mixture before putting into pie shell. I would however recommend using more spices. 
Even my 2 year old son enjoyed it. Definately will make again.
Thanks

This is the best pot pie I've ever eaten.  My entire family loved it.  I doubled the recipe because I really didn't think one pie would feed my family of 8.  One pie would have been enough, but my husband and son had seconds just because it was there and it was so delicious!!!  Definetely a keeper!!!  Thanks!  :)

Delicious recipe!! This is a great way to use up leftover turkey from Thanksgiving. Add frozen peas at the end! I tried this recipe w/ potatoes and w/o.. both were great! I also added sliced carrots after mixing for a quicker recipe. Definitely a keeper in my house

We used half and half instead of milk and added about 1/2 cup of frozen peas as well at the end.  It's very tasty.  We also used mashed potatoes instead of cubing fresh ones since we needed to use it up and it was great.

This was very good. I cut down the amount of dried parsley to probably 1 Tbsp added 1 tsp dried thyme used rice milk instead of dairy milk and added some peas.

I only gave it 4 stars because I thought it was a little too heavy on potatoes and too light on the turkey. I also added a bit more milk to my mixture as the gravy was a little thick. Otherwise, I loved the recipe! It was so delicious and my fussy 5 year old daughter ate everything on her plate! The only other changes I made out of necessity were to use 2 cups of readymade chicken stock b/c that's what I had on hand, I used fresh parsley as opposed to dry and I added a cup of peas in place of the extra potato. It was phenomenal! And with readymade pie crust, it was easy too! Thanks!

This was pretty good for leftover turkey.  Could use more seasoning.  I only used a top crust b/c of what I had on hand and used the same skillet I cooked the veggies in to bake the pie which cut down on dishes.

Made this and loved it. I did make a few changes though. I was to lazy so i did the veggies in a pot with the onion, carrots and potatoes and let them cook in chicken broth and butter for a while. Then i added the peas at the end. for the turkey all i did was add 2cu. of cream of chicken soup and one can of turkey gravy and 1/3 cup water let it cook till nice and hot. dumped out most of the chicken broth in the veggies and then added them to the turkey. Let them all cook together for a while and then put it all in the pie crust. I did pre bake the pie crust for about 6min. though. Put on the top crust and baked as it said in step 4. WAS AWESOME. The gravy and soup made it so juicy but not runny. It tasted wonderful. Will make again and again.

This recipe yielded the best pot pie I have ever had. The mixture comes out perfectly. I used ready made pie crusts for both top and bottom, skipped the oregano, subbed garlic salt and added a pinch of sage. I will definitely be making this recipe again and again. Kudos to the author.

Never posted a review before but had to rate this recipe.  The pot pie turned out AMAZING! I am not much of a cook and so I still can't believe how good it came out. I made 2 pies and had family over and everyone loved it.  I did make a couple of changes to the recipe.  I added peas instead of celery.  The grocery store was out of refridgerated pie crust so I used croissant dough instead.

Other than using store bought pie crusts, I followed this recipe exactly and it came out beautifully. Make sure you let it set up for a few minutes before cutting it so the filling sets. Mine looked messy because I didn't wait, but the taste was fantastic.

I love this recipe. I found it a few years ago and have been making it every thanksgiving and Christmas since.  It has become a left over tradition for my husband and me. It is truly the best pot pie I have ever had. One thing I do diffrently is I put my pie sheel into the pie pan and then bake it by itself for 10-15 minutes until slightly brown and then I add the mixture to it top and it and bake it. By baking the bottom shell first I avoid that soggy bottom which happens with pot pies.

Oh my gosh, this was the best pot pie I've ever had. Yum, yum, YUM! I made it last night, and it is gone today....there are only two of us eating it. The only changes I made were to use chicken broth instead of bouillon cubes and water (I didn't have any on hand), and used my leftover pie dough that I made for my pumpkin pie. I also added a little bit more flour just because it looked a bit runny. I took the advice of other posts and let the mixture cool a bit before putting it in the pie crusts. Next time, I'd add peas just because I like them in pot pie, and what I'll do is make mini pot pies using a muffin tin and making little individual ones. I found it really messy to slice but that's to be expected. Thanks for posting this was absolutely delicious!!

What a delicious recipe! I follewed the directions exactly and unfortunately found the filling to be a bit on the dry side (for my family, at least) so I added a can of cream of chicken soup the second time I made this and it was just the way we liked it. With all the spices called for, it turned out to taste like a pot pie I would order at a restaurant. It also made enough to fill two 9 inch pies so I froze half in a freezer zip loc bag and the night before we wanted pot pie again, I just moved the bag into the fridge to thaw. It was ready to be baked by dinnertime!

This was yummy!  I got a turkey on sale in May and was wondering what to do with the leftovers. This pot pie tasted even better than the first day of roast turkey!  I took the advice of others and doubled almost tripled the turkey meat, used 2 cups of chicken broth b/c I didn't have bouillon cubes and didn't have oregano so substituted with italian seasoning.  I used a trader joe's pie crust to top it off and baked it in a pie dish.  It was seriously delicious and can't wait to make it again!

Great recipe!  I added garlic, peas, turkey broth instead of chicken bouillon.  It was good but it's still missing something.    I think next time I will try adding feta cheese.

Delicious recipe but I did make two MINOR changes.    First of all, I never use water when making any sauces or bases.  I always use a stock - either vegetable or chicken, and things come out much more savory.  In this case, I replaced the water in the recipe with vegetable stock.    Also, I did add about a 1/2 cup of frozen peas and a snick more turkey than the recipe called for.    This is a winner pot pie recipe - no goopy, cornstarchy mess or super fattening cream filling.  Thanks so much for sharing this!

FANTASTIC!  We're not big vegetable eaters so I only put in the potatoes and a can of corn. I didn't have any parsley or oregano so I just used Italian Seasoning.  I doubled the broth, flour, and milk so there would be plenty of sauce and I used the ready made pie crust.  I had to practically beat the family away from the filling or I wouldn't have had any left for the pie!  I have to make this once a week now (with chicken) or they start fussing!

Easy recipe, especially if you use store-bought crust (I got mine from Trader Joe's). Just a few changes: I used chicken broth instead of water and chicken bouillon, added peas and omitted the potatoes (thought it was too much starch), and added about a tsp. of thyme because I felt the mixture needed a bit more flavor. I also just poured the mixture into a pie pan and topped it with one crust. Turned out yummy! I'll probably use this recipe again with chicken.

This was an incredibly delicious pot pie! I had a lot of leftover turkey from Thanksgiving, and I wanted to present it differently to my family, who were all getting a bit tired of it :) Since my family is so large, I doubled the amount of filling, but only used one recipe for pastry. (I used the oil pie crust from this site) I skipped the bottom crust, and only put the top crust on. This made it less rich, and a  little healthier. I did make one change in the filling...I didn't use nearly as much parsley as was called for. In my double batch, I used 3 tbs., which is half of what I "should" have used if I followed the recipe to a T. Personally, I think that the parsley flavor would have been way overpowering if I had added the 6 tbs. Other than that, I made it exactly as written, and my family LOVED the results! Thanks so much for sharing, this is going to be a new family favorite!

This was super good.  I only changed a few things as I went along thinking it could make it better given other reviews.  I refrigerated the filling until it was cold so that it didn't make the bottom crust soggy, I salted and peppered the filling to taste once it was all made and before putting it in the fridge (not with the herbs), and I doubled the amount of meat it called for.  I also used the Butter Flaky Pie Crust recipe from this site as many other people did.  It was so good!!!  Our pickiest eater (our 2 year old) ate his share and more!

This is one of my new favorite things to make. I am not an experienced cook and so I was nervous about making my first pot pie. It turned out amazing! Everyone in the house was so impressed. My only complaint is that there were no leftovers to look forward to. It was completely devoured.

THis is an excellent recipe that my husband loved.  The flavor was great...although, I  added some rubbed sage, garlic powder and thyme.  The only complaint that I have is that, as other reviewers have noted, the filling is not as moist as traditional pot pies.  However, that can easily be remedied by adding additional liquid as the veggies simmer. All in all, a great additional to my recipes I use for left over chicken and turkey carcasses.

I made this the day after Thanksgiving and my family thought it was great.  I did add a teaspoon of garlic powder and increased the turkey to 2 cups.  I will make this again many times.  I like to try new recipes and this is a keeper.  I was a little hesitant about the bottom crust being mushy, but no need to worry.  It was perfect.

Yumm-O!  I added frozen peas to the sauteed vegetable mix, about 1 cup.  The mixture was 1 cup too much for my 9" pie, most likely due to the added peas.  But it was so good!

This is such a good Pot Pie.  I will make it forever.  I used light butter and no fat milk so it is not too rich.  I will  add green peas next time.

I pretty much kept this recipe as is, with the exception of adding frozen mixed peas and carrots to the turkey mixture for a little while to soften them up. It was great, thanks for a great recipe. DH loved it!!!

This was the best pot pie recipe I have come across. I used 2 store bought deep dish crusts and just flipped one over the other. I did substitute a half bag of frozen carrots and peas when I added the potatoes instead of using chopped carrots with the sauteed vegetables. My whole family loved it and I'll be saving this recipe for my book.

The filling has a wonderful taste.  The only change I made was to add more turkey, corn, mushrooms, and omited one potatoe. If I had followed the recipe I might have had more sauce. The end results reminded me of a quiche but, still very tasty.  I will try this recipe again, this time following the recipe without additions.  I made my own crust therefore, spending more time then I wanted in the kitchen.  This could be a good company dish. Thank you for the recipe and I will try it again and report my results.

Pretty good. The only change that I made was instead of adding water and bouillon to the veggies, I boiled the potatoes separately in chicken broth, transferred them with a slotted spoon to the veggie mixture and added 2 cups of turkey gravy that I had left over from Christmas dinner. The reason for the "pretty good" comment was that I found the potatoes overpowering. Next time I'll go with 2 potatoes and increase the turkey to about 2 1/2 cups.

I did not have celery or carrots so instead I added a can on drained tender sweet peas and OMG it was delish!!!! It gave it a wonderful seet taste and complimented the pot pie very well. I also didnt have turkey so I used 4 chicken breasts and did not add parsley or oregano. My husband, picky 12 yr old and 11 month old son all loved this dish!

This was SO good!  I had to add a little extra chicken broth while the potatoes were cooking, as it was getting low.  Other than that, didn't change a thing.

Instead of the boullion and water, I just used chicken broth because it's the same thing.  The recipe made a ton of veggies so I doubled the turkey, milk, flour and broth and made it in a 9x13.  I didn't use a bottom crust, just the Pillsbury crust that you unfold (unroll).  I'll make this again!  My family loved it!

This became a great guideline for a beef pot pie. Replace the turkey with beef (a round roast was our choice but you could use other cuts) and the chicken bouillon with beef soup base or bouillon. I also used a pack of frozen mix veggies in substitution for the carrots and celery. Have fun with it.

This was amazing.  Growing up we ate a lot of the frozen pot pies so I feel scared when it comes to potpies.  But my husband has asked many times to have them & I refuse.  But I have been looking for a recipe & they are all so high in fat, except for this one.  I used store bought pie crusts which work just fine.  It did take a little longer than I had planned on due to cutting everything up.  I did a few things differantly.  I chopped all the veggies instead of how it said.  I used one large baking potato instead of 3 total.  Potatoes are pricy here so I felt I wanted to save & the one, cut very small, worked great.  I completely forgot to add the milk & already had the pie in the oven.  It still turned out amazing.  I will try to add the milk next time to see if it makes a differance.  I added some garlic powder & I only used 1 tbsp of the parsley instead of the 3 tbsp.  I also used chicken breasts, cut & cooked instead of turkey b/c I did not have turkey.  My whole family loved this & I will make it again & again.

VERY tasty recipe. I did improvise a little because I didn't any bouillion cubes. I used chicken stock and some leftover gravy. I also used a biscuit topping so that I didn't have to make a crust. A half recipe made plenty for 2 generous single-serve pies. I made one pie and refrigerated the rest of the filling for the next night.

I had leftover homemade gravy from my turkey at Christmas so I substituted that (approximately two cups) for the  bouillon, water, milk, flour, salt and pepper.  I also used more turkey, less carrots and celery.  I used two homemade pie crusts.  It tasted a little bland so I would definitely add the salt and pepper next time.  I will make this recipse again.

My husband and I made por pies for the first time and used this recipe and they turned out amazing!  We added salt, pepper, garlic powder and Vegeta seasoning and it really added lots of flavour.
Thank you so much for such a great recipe - My husband said it tasted just like his Mom used to make :)

This has great flavor but I think needed more sauce. I used refrigerated roll-out pie crusts which made it very easy to make. I had leftover roasted chicken which I substituted for the turkey and added poultry seasoning for extra flavor. The only thing I would do different is to not combine the meat with the flour, butter, milk mixture as it completely shredded, and perhaps double that mixture. Next time I will fold the meat in at the end. Always use fresh vegetables for better texture and flavor.

Fabulous from start to finish, I used store bought pie crust bottoms and home made tops.  I doubled the recipe and it made 4 9" pies. Enough to feed a small army of teenage boys.

This was my first potpie, and it tured out very well.  It was so easy to make.  I substituted turkey left overs with 3 slices of cooked smoke turkey from the deli.

THis was a very good dish and I don't think I would change a thing. Tho I used precut carrots,and a frozen bag of mixed veggies that included diced red peppers and snow peas. Very good. Well,I did x-nay the celery but that's me. And I had a fine time cooking,no over the shoulder peeking and trying to do for me that I stated in my profile. yaaa! All in all,a good and fun to make recipe.

this was pretty good.  i used a refrigerated crust for easiness and added peas, garlic powder and lots of pepper.  i'd add even more pepper next time as it could have used some kick in the flavor.  it also didn't have much "sauce", next time i would either add some cream of chicken soup to give it a little more.  tasted great though and a good recipe for using up leftover turkey.

OMG, this was THE BEST Turkey Pot Pie EVER.  It did take a long time to put together but worth every minute.  
My daughter who hates EVERYTHING loved it.  I made it almost to the letter but I had some leftover "drippings" from the Thanksgiving Turkey so I used that instead of boullion cubes.  WOW!  Hats off to the person who came up with this one!!!!!!!

This was DELICIOUS! My husband scarfed it down. I had leftover pie crust from an apple pie, and had all the ingredients available. Very simple and tasty!

I made this recipe with no celery or onions, but added thyme, and rosemary. I also used fresh parsley instead of dried, but it came out fantastic. I made it using leftovers from two days ago, and it brought new life to the turkey. 

In hindsight chopping the turkey a bit better would have helped a lot.

This recipe probably deserves 5 stars but since I tweaked it, I had to give it 4 stars. I eliminated the boullion cubes, flour and water. I sauteed the cubed potatoes with the onions, celery, carrots and added sliced white mushrooms (though I would have preferred baby portabellas). I added green beans that were left over from the day before. Added a whole can of cream of mushroom soup with 1/2 can of milk and the diced turkey to the pan of sauteed veggies. I would use less oregano the next time as I'm not too fond of it. I used Pillsbury 'ready-made' pie dough. Browned the bottom pie dough for 15 minutes before adding all the ingredients. One pan for cooking and 'ready-made' dough made this dinner 'easy as pie' and delicious!!!!

I have made this recipe many times before with left over turkey and it is perfect every time!
This time I did everything the same but with leftover roast beef and beef bouillon. 
Just as good with the beef!
Thanks for such a great recipe.

This was a wonderful pie!!!  I loved it.  I doubled the recipe and we actually ate it twice in one week.  I used chicken instead of turkey--just boiled it and broke it into pieces.  I also used the bottom half of some green onions because I'm pregnant and for some reason, regular onions are too strong for me.  I used a pie crust from my mom, who has used it for years.   1 1/2 c. flour, 1/2 tsp. salt, 1/2 tsp. baking powder, 1 Tbsp. sugar, 1/2 lard (but I used butter and it was excellent), and 1/4 cup. of water.  This is enough for one double-crusted pie.  I also baked the bottom crust for 5 minutes in a 350 degree oven before I put the veggie/meat mixture in.  I followed everything else exactly.  AMAZING!

I made a few changes after reading some reviews: I swapped a T of fresh thyme for the oregano, used only 1 t parsely, simmered down a large can of chicken broth (instead of using boullion and water)
I used refrigerated Pillsbury pie crust- Fabulous- and made 2 pies with just a top crust. I also used only one potato but added a container of sliced sauteed mushrooms and some thawed frozen peas.
And I used rotisserie chicken instead of turkey. The results were fantastic. My family gobbled it up. I froze the other one and popped it in the oven straight from the freezer on 300 till bubbly. This recipe is a keeper. Next time I will omit the potato all together.

This was hearty and rich, at the same time it was kind of bland.  Maybe I'll tinker with it if I want to make again.

I made this tonite using a double recipe of the "No Roll Pie Crust I" from another poster.  It was REALLY good, but I did not use oregano and I changed it up quite a bit to use up some canned carrots and potatoes I had on hand.  I also used canned turkey gravy in an effort to use that up as well. Thanks for the yummy recipe!

Very good!  To add more flavor I added minced garlic while I was sauting the onions and celery.  I also added some frozen veggies into the fry pan and added more turkey than the called for.  This was very flavorful and everyone loved it.  Thanks!!

We made this with leftover Christmas turkey and my picky, picky kids just gobbled it up!!  No complains or picking out the veggies!! I couldn't believe it.  It is a keeper.  I made it using Pillsbury crust, with only 2 large potatoes, and added some frozen peas.
Very good!

This was delicious. I hate to change things but I did just a little. I added a can of cream of chicken soup for more liquid and instead of pie crust I used leftover stuffing for the top. As people say, "this is a keeper".

Easy & Delicious!  I made a larger dish so I doubled the stock but kept the milk and flour measurements as is.    Added left over meat stuffing to the base layer, mixed the potatoes half sweet, half white and used packaged dough already prepared - could not have been easier or tastier!   This is truly a keeper!! Thanks

This was a really good recipe.  I normally don't care for pot pie, but I liked it.  I used chicken instead of turkey and I added some brown gravy mix and an extra cup of water to the cooking vegetable mixture.

This pie was delicious, but, as most reviewers have noted, was completely lacking in that wonderful gravy that usually comes from cutting into a warm pot pie.  I did miss that.  And I only used two potatoes instead of three, and that was plenty.  So as far as pot pies go, it was mildly disappointing.  BUT it was still a delicious dinner and even better for lunch at work the next day!

This was very labor intensive for a moderately experienced cook.  But it was WELL worth it.  I went around the table and asked each to rate the recipe and the only one who seemed not pleased was my 2 year old.  Now I just wish I had the turkey leftovers at my house ;).

Though this had nice flavor, I expected more of a gravy consistency, so it was a bit dry for us.  Made it with chicken, threw in a couple of handfuls of frozen peas.  Also used "Better Than Bouillon" with 1tsp extra and a little more water; but that all seemed to get soaked up into the veggies and didn't really provide more sauce.  I may try combining some of the ideas from this with my old pot pie recipe.  Thank you, Linda!

This recipe was great!  My boyfriend and I both really liked it full of flavor.  I did do a couple of things differently.  I used frozen mixed veggies, which saved chopping time & initial cooking time & added a can of cream of mushroom soup.  It was very moist & tasty.  I even had leftover mix so I will probably make a smaller one later.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!

This was delicious. I changed a few things. I used a can of low salt chicken broth and frozen peas and carrots. A ready made pie crust really made it easy too. Would definitely make it again.

Replaced boullion & water with 3 cups low sodium chicken broth.  Added 2 more TBS flour to thicken the extra liquid.  Seasoned turkey with poultry seasoning before cooking.  Added 1 tsp fresh ground black pepper. Decreased potatoes to 2 small, finely diced, with 1 tsp salt to broth (potatoes soak it up). Surefire no-mush crust: Prebaked bottom crust 425 10-12 minutes (be sure to prick with fork all over before baking).  Next time I'll skip bottom crust and use puff pastry on top. We're filling people. Yummy!

I wish there was a 10-star rating for this recipe.  I followed the directions to a tee and this came out absolutely perfect.  Bit of advice, let it cool down before you eat it...we were so excited we did not wait and ended up with burnt tounges.  Thanks, Linda for the superb recipe.

Never made a pot pie before, but this turned out great.  I used refrigerated pie crusts and chicken in place of turkey. I used only 2 potatoes since I have a 9 inch pie pan.  I cut them into pieces about the size of peas so they would cook quickly and had no problem with a dry filling.  I added a little sage, too.  It turned out fabulous -- better than I had hoped for a first attempt.  I loved the flavor and filling consistency.  My pie crust was golden in less time than the recipe called for by about 5 minutes, so watch it.  This is a keeper.

Thanks for this recipie. It is VERY good. I added fresh rosemary rather than parsley and it adds a wonderful flavor. I have made this twice and both times it has been maah-vell-ous.

This pot pie has a wonderful flavor. After reading the reviews, I was anxious to see what my own results would be. First, there is no problem with flavor, and the time put in is well worth it. However, it really is a little dry. I would recommend adding an extra 1/2 cup to 1 cup of broth, or for something different: Make some gravy with chicken or turkey broth, and pass it around table to spoon over your pot pie. This second idea is what we did and it worked just fine. Other than the dryness, which is easily corrected, the pie is fantastic and I will keep this recipe. Just try it for yourself and experiment with the extra broth or gravy. Thanks for a nice pot pie recipe using left over turkey.

This recipe rocks! It's so easy, and incredibly delicious. We add a bit of cayenne pepper, for a bit of heat. We've made it twice already since Thanksgiving.

I've made this four or five time.  I discovered it last year and it has been a keeper.  The only alteration I make is instead of the celery, I use two additional carrots.  Also, I use the Pillsbury pie crusts...so good.  Also, be sure to refrigerate the mixture before pouring it into the pie crust.

And I thought my own version was good! This pot pie was excellent. Couple additions: brushed beaten egg white on crust before baking; used fresh parsley. I actually had too much filling!

Loved it, loved it, loved it.  Yes, this recipe does have a lot of steps, but it was easy to follow and prepare.  The dish turned out perfect on my first try.  Delicious.  Leftovers freeze quite well.  I'm cooking for just two, so the entire pie is too much for my husband and myself to finish in one sitting.  So, I sliced the pie into individual servings, wrapped each serving in a piece of plastic wrap, and placed them all in a large freezer bag.  Now, we can reheat only as much as we need.  That's a great way to have 'fast food' that is homemade and good for you.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.  I'll be making this one over and over.

Yummy, yummy! We had gallon freezer bags full of leftover turkey, and this was a delicious way to take care of them! I also used a refrigerated pie crust, and I used a frozen bag of mixed veggies...turned out awesome! A recipe we will use again and again!

We really enjoyed this dish.  However I agree with others that it needs more sauce.  I will try this recipe again, but maybe double the sauce.  overall, very tasty.

This was well worth the time and effort (but I did the pie crust from scratch, too).  It was my first pot pie, but the directions were very easy to understand.  I was worried about stirring the turkey and flour into the melted butter at the same time, so I whisked the flour in until smooth, then added my turkey.  Very tasty.  My hubby wanted it more salty, but it was fine for my likes.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe is very forgiving. I had to omit the onions and celery (family preferences) and added in frozen peas. I put the filling in an extra deep pie pan and placed a 9 inch refrigerated pie crust on top. I'm sure that two crusts would have been twice as tasty, but I wanted to reduce the fat content. Everybody except my 2 year old liked it. Someone even asked for the recipe. Next time I will add more turkey, and sneak the onions back in. Thanks for a great way to use up that leftover turkey!

Used this recipe the day after Thanksgiving and my family loved it. It's very important to allow the mix to cool before putting it into the crust. My daughter was eating it right out of the pan. Definite keeper!

Pretty good flavor.  I knew I would try this because I've been searching sites for pot pie recipes and this same recipe has come up 3 different times.  I did have to alter this recipe.  I added additional water and I wanted peas instead of so many potatoes.  I also used the frozen Jeno type turkey breast.  I will make this again.

wonderful pie!  Used Philsbury refrigerated dough.  Next time, I'll tweak it to what we prefer a little more now that I know the basic recipe is absolutely workable.  We like a little less potatoes, more meat, and will substitute gravy for some of the liquid inside.  Also, shredded, stringy turkey instead of cubed.  Wonderful recipe, Linda. Thanks!

A very good pot pie! I doubled the number of bouillon cubes to give it extra flavor. Next time I think I'll have to double the liquid too. Being to dry was the only problem I had with the pie. Thanks for the recipe!

This might be the best recipe I have ever found for turkey pot pie. Make sure you allow the filling to cool before putting in the pie shell, it makes quite a difference.  Lots of flavour and just the right thickness.  Good "stick to your ribs on a cold day" meal.  Thankyou Linda

This was very tasty!  The times seemed wrong, however.  The initial preparation took me much longer than the 20 minutes stated in the recipe and the baking time was much less.  Came out about the same though.  I'll make this one of our regular family recipes.

Very delicious recipe.  When preparing the crust I use a small heart-shaped cookie cutter to make the vents then lay the cutouts on top of the crust, brush it all with egg white then sprinkly cracked pepper across the top for a beautiful golden brown crust.  Martha Stewart would be proud.

Wonderful use of left-over turkey.  I adjusted the spices and added some frozen mixed vegetables.  The results - a definite keeper!

I love this recipe - just made it today and it was simple and easy to throw leftovers in 
(corn, potatoes, etc.) the only thing I had to do to change it was add a litte
cornstarch to thicken the sauce because I was in a hurry and wasn't sure if it
would thicken with more cooking. I HIGHLY recommend this recipe!

I just made this for dinner tonight using my leftover Thanksgiving turkey. It was absolutely delicious! I cut up all the veggies the night before so it was easy to throw together the next day. I won't wait for leftover turkey next time--i'll try using cooked chicken. Try this-you won't be disappointed!

Very good - I used store bought pie crusts and it still came out tasting good. I would suggest adding more vegetables (to your preference) but it came out with the gravy-like consitency I desired. Yum!

This was a fantastic pot pie, and I am thrilled I got my husband to eat leftover turkey one more time!  He loved it and had thirds.  The flavor is great!  I made it with a little more turkey and fewer potatoes.  Thank you Linda!  This will be new holiday tradition for the leftovers.

my first time ever making a pot pie. it was creamy and fantastic! the whole family loved it! except for my little one who swears green peas make his throat itch? the pie shells came as a 2 pack, so I used a pie shell for the top too. I wasnt sure what to use that you roll out. great recipe!

This is a great recipe but as usual I needed to add my twist. I took some tips off of other reviews that were posted. I used chicken broth rather than water and used 1 bouillon cube. Doubled to amount of ingredients for the sauce . I also used left over dressing to replace the top pie crust.

Good as any recipe out there. I find that making the potatoes pieces smaller and shredding the turkey helps in my pies.  Personally I use Herbs De Provence, not the herbs in this recipe, and I add garlic. Instead of pie crust I use Puff pastry, it's so much easier and Smart and final has a very good quality one. After making the filling I let it cool then cut up the puff pastry sheets into 8 squares, place about a tablespoon or two in the lower half of the square,  fold over and seal and prick the top. Then I freeze them so you can pull out a meat pie anytime you want and bake it, it simple and easy and tastes wonderful. Just remember to do an egg wash on top before baking so it's a lovely golden brown.

We both like it, I used butternut squash instead of potatoes, it was what I had. I also used 3/4 cup of milk and 4 tab of flour. Second time cut the parsley to 2 tab spoons and added 1/2 tsp of sage  and rosemary 3/4 thyme. Hubby gave it 5*!

This recipe takes time, but it’s worth it!!! It is easy to make and tastes amazing. I make it with chicken typically, except after Thanksgiving when I have extra turkey on hand.

This tasted awesome! I followed the recipe almost toa T. Only changes were I try to fit 2 cups of cubed turkey and four small potatoes. That’s caused my pie plate to overflow. After reducing the ingredients in the pie plate I added the top crust and itcame out perfect.BTW I ate the overflow with a spoon.

Flavor was great!!!  I tossed everything in a crockpot then added the turkey and flour toward the end. Then cooled it down with some frozen veggies then added it to the deep dish pie shell.   My husband loved this. It’s a keeper!!

This recipe was so delicious! Followed the recipe pretty exact, only thing I didn’t have was the parsley. I also let the mixture cool about 15-20 minutes before putting it in the crust and it came out perfect! Hubby said it was the best pot pie he’s ever had!

Always great! I just use store bought dough and follow the recipe as is! I’ve done it with chicken and turkey and it’s been great, it’s also a great budget recipe. I just make a roasted whole chicken every week to use in various recipes and this is one of them. I will say use medium potatoes, I only had 3 huge russet potatoes and I ended up over stuffing and I still have some raw potato left. Way easier than I thought pot pie would be!

I made this for my family of 3, myself and my 5 year old each had a quarter and the man ate the other half.  I was able to make another pie with the ingredients left over.  This is the best ever! We are having it again tomorrow night!  *I used pillsbury frozen pie crust 2 packs

I made this exactly as the recipe called for, and it was delicious! I used a box of puff pastry sheets, which is a must. I put egg wash over the top layer of pastry, baked exactly as recipe stated, and it came out perfectly baked with a nice brown & flaky top! Great way to use up leftover turkey, will be making again.

Absolutely fabulous pot pie! I made a few adjustment based on reviews and it turned out perfect! I baked the bottom crust for 10 minutes so it was nice and brown, I used turkey stock instead of water and boullion and finally I added about a cup of leftover turkey gravy! Definitely will make again.

Great recipe. When no one wants to think too hard about dinner, this has gone into the rotation with our other goto meals. Always satisfies!

I liked it, but it was a bit dry for our tastes.  Next time I would make it with more liquid or maybe adding some milk or cream to it.

I think the recipe as is has potential, but for me a pot pie means lots of mixed veggies.  Having only celery and onions and carrots doesn't make a pot pie for me.  And I am no fan of bouillon.  Thank you for the starting place for the pot pie.  I will not review the recipe based on the changes I made...solely but what I feel.

That said:  I looked at other reviews and followed suit in making my pot pie.  I opted for a 16oz bag of frozen mixed veggies; I upped the turkey to 2.5 c (both white and dark meat); I used low-sodium chicken broth, and I used heavy cream versus milk.  I followed the directions as written, but added in some additional herbs such as garlic to enhance it.  I did not pre-bake the crust, but used good ole Pilsbury refrigerated pie crust.

Excellent recipe. I made this the day after Thanksgiving and my family ate every bite. The only thing I did differently was to swap out the carrots for a thawed bag of mixed veggies.

I used my own lard pie crust recipe, and made some other changes, made notes for the next time I'll make it. 
Cut everything into bite-size pieces.
I blanched the veggies and lightly steamed the potatoes before adding to mixture. Next time I would cook the potatoes a bit longer, as they took a long time to soften in the pan.
I didn't have all the items, so I subtracted 2 cubes chicken bouillon, 2 cups water. I added 1 15 oz. can Cream of Chicken soup, filled the can with 15 oz. of whole milk, and approximately 2 cups of leftover turkey gravy. 
I used about 2-1/3 cups of leftover turkey..
I used only about 2 Tbsp of Parsley.
Cool the filling slightly before filling the shell.
If using home-made pie crusts, keep in the fridge while you are cooking the filling.
Thanks for sharing!

This is a definite keeper. I followed the recipe exactly, except I substituted about a half cup of fresh chopped parsley instead of dried parsley because I had it on hand. Excellent flavour, excellent recipe.

I make this pie as it was written. Although I may changed up proportions. Sometimes more Turkey. Other times more potatoe.I use a butter pastry for the crust, which helps this recipe be 5 stars. Exceptional Thankyou.

Made this with the left over turkey from Easter and boy was it ever good.  I had leeks left over so I used that instead of onions.  I did let the filling cool down before I put it in the pie crust.  I made it with Tenderflake ready-made pastry.  Will definitely make again!

Great recipe!! I added a little more potato and carrots and added some frozen peas. The gravy needed a little extra milk as well. I used Pillsbury refrigerated crust. Very happy with this recipe!

This turned out great but I made a few changes. My ready dough was bad so I made my homemade pie crust and I baked the shell for six minutes prior to putting the vegetables in (as recommended by others so the dough wouldn't be wet). The crust was wonderful this way.
Instead of water I used chicken broth but I doubled it so there was more liquid for the potatoes to get tender.
I used broccoli and green onion instead of white onion and celery along with the carrots. It was great!
I used a little more flour to make it thicker, I put a pan underneath but did not have the problem of it overflowing as someone else mentioned.
I'll definitely do this again, delicious!

Loved it. Only change I made was to add some turkey gravy. Definitely cool the filling completely before putting into the crust.  Everyone loved it. Will make again and again and again. My new go-to pot pie recipe.

This recipe is phenomenal! I used a homemade pie crust to accompany the delicious filling and my husband could not get enough. I used to pay around $14 for a local bakery's chicken pie, but now this will be my go-to for turkey and chicken pies!

I used leftover fried turkey and it turned out wonderfully. I added a couple diced jalapenos for some bite and we loved it . The best part was that between the two of us it lasted about three meals.

Great recipe to follow.However I found it a little bland so I had to improvise a bit.   Made 4 batches 7/8 - 6 inch pies Added 8 cups of cube turkey 1 extra chicken bullion, additional spices garlic and red pepper, cayenne (touch) lots of grounded pepper (Only 8 table spoons of parsley - the whole package) 12 midsize cubed potatoes, unfrozen peas and 1/3 cup cream improvised/enhanced on the recipe otherwise it would have been too bland.  Don't forget to roll out the top of the pastry when your topping it up high like most do the top of the pie crust will be short... I usually roll it out just a touch.. Then clean it up when I fork the rims..

Looking for various ways to use my leftover turkey, I thought this the easiest of pot pie recipes and I had most ingredients on hand.  My family of 5 loved it.  They all had seconds...I had pecan pie! I added a clove of garlic, frozen green beans, that I snapped to make smaller,  added few shakes of dried thyme and omitted the potatoes. Instead of pie crust, I popped open my last can of immaculate biscuits, arranged them in a baking dish and poured the turkey mixture over to bake.  So it wasn't traditional looking, but the flavor was excellent.  Will definitely make again.

This is so simple to make. And tastes absolutely fantastic. I used premade pie shells from the store to make this even easier. I was able to make three "deep dish" pies. 
The only issue is the calorie and fat content. A little high but soo worth it!!

I chose this recipe because it was from scratch,no canned soup.
  I only made 2 changes.  1st I didn't use bottom crust to save on carbs. 2nd I had run out of parsley so I used thyme and a little sage ( I like these flavors with turkey).  The result was perfect .  Will make again  with chicken.

I followed this recipe as written using store bought crust and it was fantastic! I look forward to having this again and trying it with beef.

I've made this recipe many times, and followed the top review recommendations for pre-cooking the crust, sub'ing cream (1 cup), sub'ing stock (2 cups), more flour (3tbs), more turkey (2.5 cups), plus I add mushrooms (1 cup diced), plus 1/2 cup each frozen peas & corn.  I used 3 small peeled Yukon gold potatoes instead of russets since I freeze these often. Finally, I prefer the taste of fresh parsley vs dried, so I chose that route too.  The resulting creamy filling is ridiculous good.  I actually prefer this use of turkey over the Thanksgiving day roast.

this is one of the BEST pot pies I've made,. However, I didn't follow to the T. I didn't have parsley so I used Italian seasoning. I forgot to add milk to the turkey, butter and flour mixture, so I added it to veggie mix. I used liquid chicken bullion with water. I also used frozen veggies mix. I let the filling cool completely and also baked the bottom crust for about 5 minutes before pouring filling it. I baked at 425 for 15 mins and then 350 for 35 mins. it was perfect. flavor on point! will make again and will try with beef.

I've made this today, since it's Thanksgiving weekend and I still have a bunch of Turkey left. Instead of the water I used Chicken broth and instead of celery I used peas. It was absolutely delicious! Thanks for sharing it! We'll make it again for sure! This was A+++

Pretty good. I used turkey gravy instead, and half the parsley and it will still a bit strong. I also used frozen peas, carrots, and fresh potatoes.

Very good recipe! :) I used to love my moms Turkey/Chicken Pot Pie, but never knew how to make it. So I found this recipe and tried it...now my son loves MY Turkey Pot Pie! It was very good, and fairly simple. Thank you for this recipe. :)

I made this tonight with left over turkey. It turned out great. Only thing I didn't do was measure out the spices, just added what I thought was enough. I used pilsbury roll out crusts and it turned out perfect. I liked that the filling wasn't runny.  Will be adding to favorites!

I made these few adjustments as I do prefer my pies dense and chock-full of meat & veggies.
I shredded the turkey versus cubed. Skipped the celery and carrots. Added 1/4 cup chopped green bell pepper, 4 small pre-cooked potatoes, 1/2 cup chopped fresh broccoli florets, an extra 1/2 cup of turkey, a bit more oregano and voilà!

The only change I made to this recipe was omitting the potatoes, I added a tad bit more flour to compensate because I was worried the mix would be too runny. It came out fabulous! I absolutely love this filling, in the future I plan on trying the filling as a base for soups (cream of chicken and wild rice maybe?). My only recommendation is to purchase a good pie crust like Pillsbury.

This was fantastic. I read a lot of the reviews and incorporated those changes into it. I used the Pillsbury pie crust from the dairy section and baked the bottom crust 6 minutes, plus cooled the filling, before adding filling to crust. I didn't have any trouble with the crust this way, it was light and flaky.

Other mods from the suggestions in other reviews: I exchanged milk for cream and doubled to 1 cup, used chicken stock instead of bullion, increased turkey to 2.5 cups and flour to 4 tbsp, measured potatoes to 1.5 cups, and added 2 cloves garlic, 1/2 tsp sage, and 1/2 cup mushrooms. With all of the adds I ended up with enough filling for 2 pies, so I made one with a bottom crust and one without.

This was so good!  I doubled up the recipe and put it in a 13x9in baking dish because one little pie is not enough for my big family.  I also had to double up the pie pastry recipe to make up for the bigger container.  I used leftover shredded turkey from Thanksgiving. I didn't have enough parsely and I was out of celery, think it would've been better if I had the right amount of ingredients. I also used chicken broth instead of bouillon because I didn't have it and it's expensive and it has a bunch of MSG in it.  I think it would be better with some peas added, it's just not pot pie without the peas.  I did what the other reviews suggested and I let it cool before pouring in my crust. Because I put it in a bigger container, I had to bake it about 10 minutes longer. This is a keeper though.

A first time pot-pier, I followed the recipe pretty much and loved it!  A few tweaks out of necessity due to a picky veggie eating hubbie.  Celery and onion were off the table so I cut down the onion to 2 T (he'll never know its in there)and subbed the celery for an eyed pour of frozen mixed veggies (carrots, corn, peas, grn beans, limas).  Also, subbed one of the carrot sticks for a parsnip stick and oh my, sooo good.  As per some reviewers suggestions, I added a little more flour and milk, used rosemary, Italian seasonings, and parsley, and added poultry seasoning and Adobo (instead of salt) to the turkey mix.  Lastly, because I only had one pie crust left and plenty of mashed potatoes leftover from Thanksgiving, it became a sort of mix between pot pie and shepherds pie by spreading (or dolaping, rather) the tators over top in place of a second pie crust.  A sprinkle of shredded cheddar over top to add a cheesy crust and voila, DANK POT PIE!!!!  Thank you so much original poster and reviewers, if it wasn't for you we wouldn't be stuffed right now!  And btw, the Pinot was a capitol idea and thoroughly added to the cooking experience!  Energy saving tip:  wait until filling is done and cooling before heating up oven and par-baking the crust, otherwise the oven sits there cooking empty for a good 20 minutes while you are waiting for the filling to cool.

i love this recipe I make it every year except I add more veggies and a mixture of other spices to make it just right. I am not a big pot pie person but this pie is a major hit with all of our friends and family. its great with croissant crust makes it extra fluffy and just throws it over the edge of yummy. major requests from friends that live hundreds of miles around us. wonderful recipe!!!!

Definitely needs more sauce.  Will double or triple the amount of milk next time. I added frozen peas for color. If I make it again I will use half and half and make the sauce separately will add the turkey (2 cups) directly to the vegetables and then add the white sauce.  The flavor was nice. Will also add some thyme. I cooled the mixture completely before I put it in the crust.

This recipe was really good. This was my first time making turkey pot pie and it came out great!!! I agree to let the filling cool for about 15 mins so the crust isn't gluey. Great recipe.

This pot pie was delicious. I modified it by using pot pie noodles instead of the crust, since I ate so much pie over the holiday. The seasoning was just right and I increased the amount of turkey to 2 cups.

I have been using this recipe for the past 7 years and it's become a post-thanksgiving tradition in our home. The recipe is perfect as written. The only minor change I make is to use Goya adobo all-purpose seasoning in place of salt and pepper and add an Italian seasoning blend to the veggie mixture. I use Trader Joe's crust, which has no lard or artificial ingredients and tastes like homemade. Perfect every time.

The only complaint I have about this recipe was that it ended up a little too salty with the two bouillon cubes and the sauce was a little bit thin.  Good otherwise, and exactly what I was looking for!

I doubled up on the amount of flour, milk and butter with the turkey to create a little more sauce and it turned out awesome! Will definitely make again!

VERY good..... the use of white and dark turkey meat made it very tasty. I have put this into my recipe box and will use it for all turkey left overs...it will probably become one of those recipes handed down for generations to come.... thank you.

I loved it! I made my own pie crust and added frozen mixed veggies with my favorite better than bouillon and it came out flavorful and filling.. This was enough for 2 pies so I froze  half for next time .

This was sooo good! I added one pkg frozen corn and I tsp poultry seasoning. I also used a 13X9 baking dish and made a homemade buttermilk biscuit mix for the topping instead of another pie crust. Also used the egg wash. Absolutely amazing!

I liked it, my two non-vegetarians liked it. Success. My husband was not home so no opinion from him. Good flavors, crust was fine. Pretty much followed recipe to a T except that I was out of oregano, so I substituted Italian season instead. I will definitely make this again, as it is a good way to use up leftover turkey. I'm used to a little more gravy in my pot pies, but it could have been that it took me too long doing other things that I reduced the vegies and broth too much. This is the only reason I gave it 4 and not 5 stars...would give it 4.5 if I could. It was almost more like a pasty than a pot pie. May experiment a bit next time.

Wow!  If you use allrecipes' "Ruth's Grandma's Pie Crust" with this recipe you won't be disappointed.  
I have tried multiple variations - my favorite is to substitute the red sweet potatoes for normal potatoes (makes it more colorful and tasty) as well as add carrots.  I also make my own turkey stock, so I prefer to use 2 cups of homemade turkey stock in place of the chicken boullion and water.
My boyfriend can't get enough.

This is the first review I've written. I wanted to make my husband a turkey pot pie using my mom's leftover turkey from Christmas. I had never even eaten a pot pie before, let alone make one! He came home as I was cooking the ingredients in the pot and said it smelled so good....he wanted to eat it straight from the pot. I substituted frozen peas for the celery (I don't care for celery), used two potatoes instead of three, skipped the parsley, and added some poultry seasoning. I also used a store bought crust to make it simple, and a packet of turkey gravy to pour on top. He said it was "fancier" than the one his mother makes...and it was his favorite thing I've made for him! I even liked it! A definite keeper.

Great recipe "as is."  Have made this several times, and find that it is enough to fill two eight-inch disposable pie pans.  I use the pilsbury "rolled-up" crusts, and find that they work well.  I DO let the mixture cool for 1-2 hours before assembling, and I also bake the lower crust for 8-10 min at 425 before adding the mixture.  I cover the edjes of the crust with foil, and remove 10 min before the end of cooking.  This helps to prevent them from being overcooked.  Great with peas or corn added as well!

I find this recipe a little time consuming to make, but it is well worth it. I usually double the recipe, and I get 2 8-9 inch pies and I put the leftover filling in a small casserole dish with leftover mashed potatoes or sweet potatoes on top. Delicious, and freezes well too.

Made this for 4 hunters at deer camp using wild turkey meat from this springs turkey hunt.  Crocked the turkey legs in Italian dressing and had to substitute the chicken broth for beef broth but got raving reviews from the crew.

I gave it 4 stars only because it was a bit time consuming. Definitely saving this dish for a weekend recipe when I have more time. I used 2 cups of chicken broth instead of bouillon cubes and water, but other than that followed the recipe to the letter. It was a big hit! The ingredients were even enough to fill TWO 9" pie crusts so I was able to cook once and eat twice... bonus! My son asked for seconds, that's how I know I made a fine meal. Great idea to clean out the freezer of left over frozen veggies.

My new favorite pot pie recipe. I pre baked my crust and added the filling. I made a roux first, then added the broth. Turkey was cooked with the veggies. I added some sage cause I like that herb. Super tasty.

Easy and delicious!  I would do two things different next time: cube my potatoes smaller and add a bit more turkey...just to use more leftovers, not for taste.  My husband and kids loved it and it was even better the next day!

Fiance and i both liked this. I added some pressed garlic to veggies like i do for everything. Added extra milk since once all mixed together it seemed a little thick. Will def make again but add more variety of veggies next time. Was hesitant on the amount of potato. I used 3 small ones and was still a lot. Green beans corn and peas would be great. Great for turkey leftovers!

Just tried this recipe tonight on my Thanksgiving leftovers. I had read through some of the reviews, and would agree with some comments and changes. I don't keep many dry herbs on hand, so I used what I had, I used less than 0.5 T Italian blend spices. BTW, I had doubled the recipe. I used 5 yellow potatoes, but found that to be a bit too much potato, and will cut back on the next go around to about 3 potatoes. I added in 1 cup of frozen peas. I had over a cup of leftover Turkey broth, and added water to make it 2 cups. Then used 2 cups of water, 2 packets of Mazola no MSG chicken bouillon. But the pie was not as saucy as I'd like. Maybe cutting back on the potatoes or adding an extra cup or 1.5 cup of broth might help. Next time I will also be adding in more meat & peas. Also, I cut out the bottom crust, and used 2% milk to bring down the calories. Overall, it is a solid recipe, and a great base from which I can switch up on my own. Thanks!

I love this recipe! The only changes were I used chiken instead of turkey and did not put in any peas which I dislike.

Very good way to use leftover turkey.  Everybody enjoyed this recipe very much.  I made 3 extras and froze them unbaked.  This worked great for nights I didn't feel like cooking.

I've been making this recipe for years and modified a few things a tiny bit to make extra creamier sauce and 2 extra pies. This last time I made it was the best to date!

3 recipes pastry for a (10 inch) double crust pie
 
1 1/2 sticks of butter, divided
 
1/2 Vidalia onion, minced
 
1 small bag baby carrots, sliced
 
1/2 cup dried parsley
 
1 tablespoon dried oregano
 
6 cubes chicken bouillon
 
6 cups water
 
5 lbs  potatoes, peeled and cubed
 
6 lbs chicken breast cooked then cubed
 
2/3  cup  all-purpose flour
 
2 1/2 cups heavy cream

Added
1 can of corn 
1/2 can of baby peas

This will make the most amazing and creamy pot pie filling! No need to add salt. I bake the bottom crust before I add filling to avoid gooey bottom. Makes 3 pies

Perfect recipe! I make it gluten free by using a gluten free pie crust and by substituting the regular flour with tapioca flour. Also, I always use homemade broth. I've made it with Thanksgiving leftover turkey and with leftover oven roasted chicken and both times it came out amazingly delicious!

Excellent!  I added a quarter tsp of chopped basil, and frozen peas.  I also used two cups of chicken broth with two bullion cubes instead of water. I WOULD MAKE AGAIN!!

Me and my family loved this recipe. I made two! (one to keep and one to give away) and the measurements doubled perfectly! Even my picky son who said he hates pot pies LOVED it and asked for seconds! Easy peasy and fun to make. Thank you!

I have made this a few times and every time I do there are never any left over. Even my picky two year old will eat it! I did follow one users suggestion of letting the filling cool to room temp and I found it came out perfect! If you buy store bought crust or make you're own it tastes great either way. I don't normally add all 3 tablespoons of parsely either. I do about 1 to 2 tablespoons and I found for us that it enough! Awesome recipe and really came in handy after Thanksgiving! Comes out great with chicken to!!

Tonight I served this to my husband and boys (16yrs and 12yrs).  After dinner they rated it. 4 Stars each from the boys and 4 3/4 Stars from hubby.  My hubby said he would like a little more gravy/sauce with it and the boys agreed. I only added 2 potatoes which was plenty and i added a handful of peas. They would love for me to make it again!! Thanks for a great flavorful easy recipe.

Great way to use up leftover turkey. I made this a couple of days after Thanksgiving. We liked it real well, but made some homemade gravy to pour over the top of it.

I think I like food with a pit more flavour. I put peas instead of carrots and added some balsamic vinegar to give it a bit of a kick but it wasn't enough.  Quite dull.  I will experiment some more to try to add "something" to it.

I've got a few things about this recipe. 1 - This is, by far, the best recipe I've come across, and it came out perfectly. 2- Made your own crust. I never buy store bought crusts, mine came out so flaky and just added so much more to the recipe. (for a double pastry recipe, 2 cups of flour, 1 tsp of salt, 2/3 cup shortening and 6-7 tbsp of water) 3- I do have a problem with the times listed on this recipe. It only takes about 20 minutes after you have all the vegetables prepped. If you really want to include all of it, I spent about almost an hour doing everything. I expected it since I've cut vegetables before (and making my own pastry), but it's a deceiving thought. 4- Also, a pot might be easier than a pan. I was smart and used a deep frying pan, but it was tough stirring it around. 5- Add more turkey, and use small potatoes. I used 3 baking potatoes, so they were huge and I barely tasted the turkey. Next time I'll either add more turkey or add more turkey and buy smaller potatoes. 6- I recommend this recipe definitely. Next to making my own crust I followed it exactly and my husband and I devoured our bowls. Happy cooking!!

This pot pie is amazing. Take a shortcut and buy Pilsbury pie dough, not the frozen kind, but the ones that come two to a box, rolled up and fresh where they have your other Pilsbury products.

Yummy! I doubled the recipe and ended up with enough filling for 4 pies! I put the leftover filling in the freezer for a quick meal one night. I added some frozen peas and green beans. Also I used turkey stock, and threw in my leftover gravy from Christmas dinner, so reduced the flour a little bit. Really yummy. Kids loved it and so did my Pot Pie hating hubby :)

Amazing. My only complaint would be that there was no direction on how much turkey to use; maybe that's why I wound up with enough filling for two pies. It's ok. I'm surprised it made it into the Tupperware. I kept sneaking spoons of it. Two thumbs up.

I made this recipe with pillsbury ready made crust and it was really good. I used 2 cups of chicken stock instead of the bullion cubes and water. I would use less parsley next time, but other than that I thought the recipe was perfect.

Absolutely Delish! I used fresh turkey stock instead of the bouillon & only one crust (just a personal preference), but otherwise followed recipe exactly...AND, this was the best pot pie I've ever had!! Even my husband (who normally thinks of pot pies as "peasant food" & refuses to eat them) went back for thirds! Thank you so much for this recipe that has immediately made the family favorites list!

My Family liked this recipe.  I used left over turkey from Thanksgiving. I did let filling cool before putting it in pie crust. I added some left over turkey gravy into filling and used 1/2 of chicken bouillon instead.

Great recipe! I used the store-bought Pillsbury pie crust and the bottom crust didn't get soggy as I feared. I did let the filling cool for 15 min or so before pouring it in the crust as another reviewer had suggested and maybe that helped?
The filling was a little more soupy than I wanted so I ended up adding some extra half-and-half and cornstarch to thicken it up. 
I was afraid it was too much parsley at one point but once everything came together in the end it was fine. You'd be able to get away with 2Tablespoons instead of 3 though easily.

This is a real pic!  This recipe came out looking fantastic and tasted even better.  The key to the look and the flaky crust was the brushed egg on top like other reviewers suggested with the refrigerated pillsbury brand pie shells that you roll out.  I also prebaked the bottom crust a bit which seemed OK except the sides folded in on me.
We substituted some other vegetables, broccoli and mushrooms, because we had no carrots, and those were great too.  We were very happy not to have some cream of soup added because the more meat and vegetables the better!  This recipe didn't need any of that goop.

I tweaked this slightly with others' suggestions. I added an entire 10oz can of condensed cream of mushroom soup because it really was too runny. once the rest thickened up, it was perfect. I didn't add the extra milk like someone suggested because I thought it tasted fine and I didn't want to change the consistency. There were WAY too much veggies in this and I had to toss 1/4 of each in a salad just to not be wasteful. I used two small celery ribs (a good amount) and only had longer carrots but i think one big one would have been fine. I should have imagined what would fit into a pie dish before chopping. 2 small potatoes would have been fine instead of 3. because of the extra soup, I could have added extra flour and 1/2 cup of milk to thicken it and make two pies but only had one dish and prepared crust available. So I made some rice to top this off with and used it for lunch the next day. will use a home made crust next time. baking the bottom crust first for 8 mins really helps with not having the filling become too soggy.

We really liked this recipe, but after looking through the reviews made some initial changes. We only used one cup of broth, left out the oregano/parsley (none around) and eyeballed how much veggies would fit (slightly less than the amount suggested above, probably 2:1 to meat). After adding the meat mixture we also put the 11oz can condensed chicken soup. We let the mixture cool down for about 20 minutes and then popped it in the oven.  We were only searching for a way to use up thanksgiving leftovers, but my husband was so enamored I'm sure this will come out again. Thanks!

Great for leftover Thanksgiving turkey. Made no changes and my whole family said this recipe is a keeper! However I think I will add a little more milk next time it was a little dry but had a great flavor.

This was a great recipe, I used it twice in one week. I had cooked potatoes which i chopped small andI added them for a short period, I also  added my stuffing and corn, My son doesn't like Turkey but ate 1/2 the pie.

This was a wonderful pot pie.  No one in my family is super fond of pot pies, but all went back for seconds when I presented this one. Next time, I would lightly grease the pan to prevent the crust from sticking and cook the potatoes with the carrots and celery...they were still a bid crunchy at meal time. My addition to this recipe was 6 cloves of garlic and chicken base instead of bouillon cubes. Excellent flavor and very little cream sauce which makes it "meaty."

This is one amazing recipe! I made it to the "T" the first time. The second time I made it, I followed almost everything. I didn't have onions, so I used a leek instead, fresh parsley, and garlic. It was just as delicious! This is my go to recipe for chicken pot pie too!

I should start off by stating that I made some changes.  I added more seasonings (thyme, sage, paprika, etc), 2 cloves of minced garlic, subbed broth for water and bouillon, used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk (had some I needed to use up) and increased that amount to 1 cup.  Made a home made crust.  End result was extremely tasty.

I made this last. I wanted to use up left over Thanksgiving turkey. It was fantastic. My husband thought it was delicious. I used 2 cups cubed turkey meat and added a can of cream of chicken soup. I also used a pillsbury refrigerated pie crust. This is a keeper for sure. I'm sure it would be great with chicken too. I had to give it four stars just because I added the soup and extra chicken.

LOVED!  My entire family loved it - in fact I barely have any leftover!!!
This recipe was super delicious and very easy to make.  I made a few changes - no bullion cubes as they tend be flavored with MSG and instead used 1 cup of chicken broth.  Also, based on other reviews, I used 1 and 1/2 cups of 1/2 &1/2 for the milk.  I also added peas.
The entire meal was Super creamy and super yummy!!! (Yes...I know not low fat but once in a while this deliciousness won't hurt us!!!)

I really did like this recipe. I changed a few veggies around to fit what we like in our household. Instead of celery, I used fresh broccoli and added peas as well. This is a good simple recipe but with plenty of flavor.

Like other reviewers, I altered the recipe.  However, this recipe is a good starting point.  I added leftover dressing to the vegetable mix to season it.  My dressing has cornmeal, sage, celery, onions, pepper, etc. in it.  I also added minced garlic to the flour butter mixture.  I don't understand other reviewers who cook this dish and then  say it has no taste.  Taste the filling before you put it in the pie dish and then season it how you like!

I also used 3/4 cups milk and 4 tbsp flour and a little extra butter to accommodate the extra flour.  I like that the filling is thick and not runny, but that is a personal preference.

I baked my bottom crust for 5 minutes and let the filling cool before putting it in the pie dish.  I brushed the top crust with a egg white.  Yum!

Great!  We made it with one refrigerated pie crust because that's what we had. The filling was firm, so the one crust worked fine. Hit the spot this chilly day after Thanksgiving.

Very, very simple made with common ingredients found in most home kitchens!  Followed the recipe exactly, except that I added a 4oz jar of diced pimentos right before pouring the filling into the pie shell.  Awesome!

We made a turkey that had been in our freezer since last Thanksgiving. My husband gets a free turkey every Thanksgiving from work, and since we never do Thanksgiving at our house, every October we make turkey to make room in the freezer for the next one. This weekend we made our turkey and now we had to figure out creative ways to use the leftovers. 

This was dinner last night, and the first homemade pot pie I attempted (the crust was store bought). My family loved this. My husband ate half the pie. 

I had to make some adjustments based on what I had on hand. 
1. I had a 9 in. pie crust and pie pan so I reduced the ingredients. For step 2 in the original recipe, I used 1 carrot, 1 celery, 2 small potatoes, 1 1/4 cup of turkey, and 1 cup of water. 
2. I heated the vegetables in olive oil instead of butter in an attempt to make it healthier.
3. I added fresh minced garlic in with the potatoes. 
4. I don't buy chicken bullion cubs so I added 1-2 tbs. of homemade leftover turkey gravy (made from the turkey drippings) to the 1 cup of water.
5. I replaced the oregano and parsley with 2 1/2 tsp. of Ms. Dash table blend. 
6. In step 3 from the original recipe, I didn't use flour and butter because I had leftover turkey gravy. I heated 1 cup of leftover turkey gravy and 1/4 - 1/3 of milk with the turkey.
7. I had some left over cooked mixed vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, corn and pimento) that I added at the end.

I used a frozen pie crust, but the filling was amazing! Even changing up some of the ingredients (like using corn) didn't make it fail. LOVED IT!

This is a hit!  For a lower fat option, make your own crust with a cup of whole wheat flower, 2 tbsp of margarine, 2 tsp of baking powder, and 1/3 cup of milk.

When I told my husband I was making this after Thanksgiving, he seemed unimpressed;However after he ate it, he raved about it for weeks and asked when was I making it again. It came out delicious even using the store bought pie crust. Will definitely make this crowd pleaser again.

Although my spouse really liked this pot pie it was not the best I've tasted. The filling consistency was good not runny. The amount of filling was just right for two deep dish pie crusts ( the better kind with more generous amount of dough)I used  turkey stock instead of chicken boullion. Next time I will season after mixing all the filling together and tasting first as there is no indication for approx how much salt and pepper. I used three medium potatoes and it seemed a little excessive. Cooktime was just about right as crust was perfectly cooked.

Good way to use left overs. I used Pillsbury Big and flaky crescent rolls as the covering for the individual serving pot pies I made in personal serving dishes. I also added frozen peas. They were good but needed a little more flavoring, I will try adding more spices next time.

Although I think I could speed of the preparation, this recipe is great. I've never made a pot pie, so I was leery. But it didn't disappoint. I would, though, add peas next time. It just doesn't seem complete without peas.

This recipe was delicious and so easy to make. I used a store-bought pie crust (the top of which I brushed with egg yolk) and followed the advice in the reviews and allowed the filling to slightly cool before placing the top crust on. This is a fantastic recipe, which I will now use with roasted chicken as well!

I made this pot pie for dinner after Thanksgiving,  Oh my gosh, this is an incredible recipe.  The flavors are super! The pie crust stayed flaky, I was afraid with all the liquid that it would be a soggy mess.  My husband has raved about this dish even when he ate the leftovers.  I will definitely put this one in my recipe box!

Yummy
Good use of Thanksgiving turkey leftovers. 
Taste great when made from scratch. I was nervous putting un the water. I didn't want soup. But it thickened up nicely.

My husband loved it! I thought the parsley & oregano could be reworked into something better or more interesting! I used http://allrecipes.com/recipe/butter-flaky-pie-crust/ for the crust & I think with every bite my husband raved about the crust & it was eeeeeasy!

This turkey potpie was definitely a hit in my house. I made it as staed in the recipe with the exception of the parsley (I was out). My husband and son both went back for seconds. I will use this recipe in the future.

Great recipe - everyone wanted seconds! I used Martha Stewart's Pate Brisee recipe for the crust and subbed some dried thyme in place of the oregano and parsley. A family favourite for sure!

I tried making this a few years ago and just didn't like it. It seemed really dry and there was WAY too much parsley for my taste. My wife asked me to make it again this year after Thanksgiving and I decided to give it another try. Instead of using 3 tablespoons of parsley, I only used 2, and also put some shredded cheese on the bottom of the pie and on the top before I added the top crust. It was perfect! I'm making it for the second time in a week. This will be my "go to" and I'm also going to try it with chicken

This was a great start. Consistency for me was perfect. Just enough "sauce"...veggies and meats...I added in some other veggies...but there was no FLAVOR! That was my only problem! So I'm saving this and will remake and rework the spices.  Thank you for the recipe. =)

This dish was SUPER easy to make.  If you are worried about the calories from carbs, just do a top crust.  Also, I added in 2.5 bouilon cubes and 2.5 cups water.... it made it just a bit more "wet" - Also - make sure to pay close attention to "salt and pepper to taste" - this should be done right before dumping into the pie shell.

Perfect!  I added extra celery, carrots and turkey.  I also added dairy-free margarine and coconut milk in place of the butter and milk for a dairy-free version.  I wouldn't say that it feeds 8 hungry adults, though.  I have a family of 6 - 4 kids and 2 adults.  We polished it off.

Pretty good, but the recipe calls for waaay too much parsley. I'm going to make it with 1 tablespoon (if I ad any at all) the next time I make this recipe.

Oh my, just got finished eating my hearty slice and this was scrumptious.  Maybe better than Thanksgiving dinner. I tweaked a few things: I covered the filling with mashed potatoes as I didn't have any whole ones left. Stirred some sage and fresh rosemary in the butter.  Wow.  Never made a pot pie before and it was easy enough.  Well worth the effort!

The best pot pie we've ever had!  We only made a few small changes.  I still had onion and celery stuffing mix left from Thanksgiving.  I used a cup of the onion and celery stuffing mix that also had parsley, rosemary, thyme, and sage.  I used 1 1/2 cups of water instead of 2 cups.  Just before filling the pie crust, I added 1 small can of peas and 1 small can of corn (both well drained).  I had enough pot pie filling for 2 9" Pillsbury deep dish pie crusts. The Pillsbury pie crusts come in packages of 2.  I filled one shell and put the other pie shell on top of the pot pie.  The 2nd shell I had to roll up in a ball and roll out with a rolling pin before placing it on top.  Delicious!  We will be making this again!

I made this recipe according to the directions and it was amazing!!!  I added a little extra flour to the mix because it came out slightly watery.  The only thing I would suggest is cooling it for about 20 minutes before cutting it.  Thanks for sharing!!!

Here are the don'ts...
1. dont over fill
2. pinch crsts together on top of the outter edge, not under or it just explodes... see # 1. 
4. let cool before filling crusts. or else it gets gummy. 

Enjoy!

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I made ours with a whole wheat crust, and added a handful of frozen peas to the mix.  I baked it in a regular glass pie pan, so there was some filling left over, which we froze for future use in "pocket pies."

Very tasty.  I added a bit of cayenne, used chicken stock instead of bouillon and water, and left else as is.  Next time I will cut down on the parsley a bit.  Otherwise, was fantastic!

I baked this with the left overs we had. I modified it a little by minimizing the requested vegetables. I did let it cool, which was suggested by the other reviews. It came out perfect. My husband absolutely loved it.

I have to agree .. this is an excellent recipe! I lamed out and used Pillsbury Pie Crust from the refrigerated section. Delicous way to use the last of my turkey breast purchased last weekend. Very simple to prepare. Tastes delicious!

First time making Pot Pie ever! My family & I are addicted to this one now! I've been bragging about this recipe to all I know. I made 1 pie the first time (got 3 kids); I did add some Lesueur peas (1/4-1/2 can) & used Pillsbury roll out pie crust...YUMMY! Everyone was looking for 2nds & 3rds. I made two more pies...GONE!! 22lb turkey & this is the first time in years I haven't had to freeze any left over turkey! Love this recipe! BTW, the last 2 pies went outside (it was really cold) to speed up the setting/cooling...they couldn't wait to eat; my kids LOVE this!!!

spectacular.  Just needed 1/2 cup more milk to give mushy consistency.  I used puff pastry top/bottom and gave egg wash.  UNBELIEVABLE.

This was a fantastic recipe.  I used chicken stock in place of the water and bouillon,and replaced 1/2 cup of the stock (water) with white whine.  I also used cornstarch instead of flour.  Instead of pie crust I used a leftover can of cresent rolls as the pie crust top and used no bottom crust.  I had no leftover potatoes, so I just used diced parsnips instead.  The flavor was fantastic.  Will definitely make this again next year with my leftovers.

This recipe was better then I thought.  It tasted better then it looked as well.  I like my pot pies a little creamier.  I made a few changes. I added some frozen peas and a few fresh chopped mushrooms.  I didn't have any pie crusts laying around so I just poured the turkey mixture in a casserole dish and put a bisquick mixture (bisquick, milk & egg) on top and baked according to the bisquick box.  Turned out great.

We are a family of four adults and one 4 year old and most of us are not too fond of leftovers.  But, I could not stand the tought of discarding the rest of our Thanksgiving turkey today. Then I came across this recipe and decided to give it a try.  It was so great that we ate the whole thing in one sitting. I made it pretty much as written. I used the Walmart brand of refrigerated pie crust sheets, and substituted canned chicken broth for the chicken boullion cubes, used 2 instead of three tablespoons of parsley and added four potatoes instead of three. I baked it longer than suggested as it took a while for the crust to brown up. Both the top and bottom crust were delicious when done. It was excellent.  My family actually asked me to make it again and I will.  But, next time I will definitely add more turkey or chicken than the recipe calls for.

Delicious!!! Perfect comfort food. I made a couple changes...I used 2 cups of chicken stock instead of bouillion and water. I also added one can of sweet corn and 2 tablespoons of cream to 2 cups of turkey instead of 1.5 cups. As someone else mentioned, definitely let the filling cool before baking it. AMAZING! Enjoy :)

This was incredible! I made this for my family after thanksgiving and due to our large number had to make 6Xs what the recipe called for and make miniature pot pies and it turn out more than excellent!! I didn't need 3 potatoes per pie however, it was good with about two any more and it would have been over powering.

I love this recipe. My sister helped me make it and it was great. The only thing I change was spreading egg white on the top. I love the look it gives pie. I am so going to make it again one day. I have to say it was the best pot pie i have ever tasted. . . but it was the  only pot pie i ever tasted that wasn't store bought. :D

This was my first turkey pot pie and it turned out phenomenal!!!  I added some green onions and tumeric to my filling.  Instead of using dried up parsley, I picked some fresh bunches from my garden and used that.  For the pastry I just followed the tenderflake recipe.  And I let the filling cool down before putting into the pie shell.  Will make again with chicken!!!

I thought this recipe was fantastic!  I didn't have a problem with extra filling, as I used a 9.5 inch pie plate and it calls for a ten inch.  I did use the smallest white potatoes I could find though, and only omitted one to replace it with 1/2 cup of cremini mushrooms and 1/2 cup frozen peas.  I thought the sauce was perfect!  I let the pie sit for a good 35 minutes before cutting into it.  It's still blazing hot and the sauce sets up nicely!  I was concerned after reading some of the reviews but I had no problem at all.  I used the ready made refrigerated crusts too.  Enjoying the left-overs today, and still the creaminess of the sauce is perfect!  Will be doing again after Thanksgiving next month! :)

I echo what everyone else said - this is delicious!  I use turkey stock instead of chicken buillon, and the leftover meat from the carcas after I make the stock.  I also add corn or green beans, whatever I have on hand that sounds good. I agree with those that said that this makes a HUGE amount of filling, easily enough for two pies (today i'm freezing some for later, sure it will be great!) Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Am I the only one that had to cook the pies for a longer period of time???  Noone else seems to mention this.  I cooked it at the recommended recipe temperature of 425F for 15 minutes and 20 minutes at 350F but it did not appear to be near enough cooking time.  I had to add 20 more minutes extra.  I also made a few changes by changing the chicken bouillon and water with chicken stock and added extra chicken bouillon concentrate as well for added flavour.  I would definately make this again....

This was a good basic recipe. It needed more flavor so I added three cloves of garlic to the veggies when sauteing. The store didn't have rolled up pie crust so I just put it in a baking dish and added biscuit dough on the top. I also added fresh mushrooms and frozen peas to the veggie mix. My Dad can't handle potatoe well so I put in rutabegas instead.

came out great, only used top crust - added a half cup more milk and cup more broth for more gravy, but we also like huge pieces of turkey instead of cubed.. great!

Great!  I used a little extra water and it didn't come out runny.  I used 2c chicken stock instead of the water and bouillon. Also, I chucked in about a half cup of peas.  I also added some garlic powder.  This made next to enough filling for 2 pies though!  Definitely would make again.

My family LOVED this recipe!! Soooo much better than frozen is what they all said :) The only thing I did to this recipe was doubled it since my family loved it so much and as far as the crust, I used frozen crusts and instead of just rolling it out again and placing it I let it thaw then when I was ready to roll it out I softened some butter and placed it with the crust and just kneaded it enough to where it was incorporated then rolled it out. It was yummy and buttery and turned out awesome for the crust! Just a thought for those who don't want to use frozen but don't have time for homemade ;) Also the 2 cups of water is never enough for how long it has to simmer. Every time I make this I have to add more water to keep it watery enough to cook the potatoes. Did nothing else to the recipe. Awesome!

I thought it was kind of bland - not that you can do much with leftover turkey but this really didn't have much taste.

Delicious! I didn't think it looked like nearly enough turkey so I added more. Didn't have celery so I used more carrots. Next time I have leftover turkey I'll think about this ahead and cut my turkey thicker so I have a little bit larger chunks. Thanks for a great recipe.

My family liked the pies, but I thought they were a little bland. Also a little dry. I wonder if the potatoes soak up the saucy filling. I incorporated some of the advice from previous reviews (waiting for filling to cool). I had added some peas and used my homemade turkey broth - which should have given good taste. I think I would add more spices (bay leaf, a little garlic) next time and cut the potatoes (or use only half).

SO yummy!  This was the first time I've ever made turkey pot pie, tasted JUST like mom's homemade recipe I ate growing up!  I like to cook fast and easy, used Pillsbury Pie Crust (baked for 8 min. before filling), then a frozen veggie medley pack steamed in the microwave, used all seasonings and plus the potatoes.  I used 1 Cup of chicken broth plus a can of turkey gravy in place of the bouillon and water.  This made a lot of filling so I froze the extra for future use...came in quite handy on a snow day a few weeks later, and just as delicous!  Thanks for the recipe, Mmmm!

So yummy.  Did what other reviewers suggested and used refrigerator pir crust and let liquid filling cool a bit before pouring into the crust and it came out great.

This was wonderful but I made a few changes.  I added a cup of half and half cream instead of one of the cups of water, 1/2 cup of white wine, and wee bit more flour.  Just before filling the crust I added a cup of frozen peas.  I made sure to leave the filling to room temperature before filling the pastry.  I will definitely make this again, although it is by no means low calorie.

This was ok. I'm a pot pie fanatic and I've had better recipes. I just wasn't a fan, sorry. I do want to note the 3 Tbsp. of dried parsley was a bit much. I'd decrease it to 1 Tbsp.

This is a great recipe!  My family is a big fan of peas in pot pie - so I subbed the fresh carrots for frozen peas and carrots, and didn't add them until the end - and it turned out great. Tastes even better the following day

The recipe is AWESOME!  I made it last night with leftover turkey from Thanksgiving.  I had never made a pot pie before.  I only made a few small changes - I was out of oregano, I added some sage, thyme and garlic powder instead.  I increased the liquid and turkey by about 1 C each.  I used chicken stock and turkey drippings (with the fat removed) instead of bullion.  so so good!  A definite keeper!

Tried this recipe tonight--it was fantastic!  I am an amateur cook, and found the recipe quite easy.  I added frozen corn to this recipe and did not include celery.  I also modified the vegetable mixture cooking instructions by combining the water, veggies, and spices all at once (instead of in two steps), then boiling until potatoes were tender but still firm.  My fiancee and his mother couldn't stop raving about this pot pie--I am told it should be my signature dish!  Fantastic.  Only complaint is that there wasn't much of a creamy gravy-like filling, but I might modify the recipe to have a cream-based soup to fix this.  =D  Still, DELICIOUS!

Excellent flavor! It looked beautiful! This was very good but a little dry since I added a lot of other "dry" ingredients.  Next time I will add more liquid.  I used fresh herbs instead of dried and added fresh thyme and green onions.  I also added a dash of red pepper flakes.  I added garlic, a shallot, mushrooms, and peas.  I used 2 cups of turkey.  I used all purpose flour, wheat flour, and soy flour.  I used a premade pie crust for the bottom, which I baked for about 8 minutes before filling the pie.  I used a flat pie crust (bought at Trader Joes) for the top.

Made this just after Thanksgiving, it was SO good! I only made a few adjustments. I only used two potatoes and I used an egg wash on the inside of the crust so the filling would not soak through. I also followed other reviews and waited for the filling to cool before putting it in the crust. Next time I will add a half of a cup more turkey because it didn't seem to have enough, and I think peas would also be a good addition. Overall this was a great recipe, it even made yummy leftovers. My friend asked for the recipe the next day, always a good sign.

This was delicious!  What I did differently: I used a package of frozen peas, carrots, green beans and corn.  I upped the water to 2 1/2 cups.  Added another boullion, upped the flour by 1 T and used 2 C of turkey.  It was soooo good.  My 5 year old inhaled it!

This was so easy and delicious!  I used my own broth instead of chicken bouillon with water.  I also added chopped green pepper and substituted thyme and sage for the oregano.  This was a keeper and I can't wait to make it again.  Thank you for a wonderful way to use leftover turkey.

Great!  Added some frozen peas, sherry and thyme.  Brushed the crust with melted butter before baking.  Comfort food.

Made again subbing sweet potatoes for the white and omitted the milk.  Even better!

I love this recipe and it's a perfect dish to hide healthy foods in so my husband will eat them. I add flax seed to the filling right before I fill the pies for omega 3's. I also add garlic with the onions and whatever veggies I have (corn, green beans, etc.) I also make mini pies so I can freeze some for later!

This was pretty good, although I found it to be slightly bland. I added some chopped garlic and used season salt instead of regular. Also next time I'll try using half & half instead of milk. But overall it was good & easy to make and I will make it again.  I didn't have a ready made crust so I decided to try making one (which I'd never done!). I used the "Crust for Veggie Pot Pie" recipe from this site, which I added shredded cheese & parsley too. It was also very easy to make, and very yummy with this recipe!

I made this with chicken and served it over potato rolls instead of using the pie crust.  It had good flavor but could have used a little more seasoning.  The only other thing I would change the next time is to add more liquids, as I like my pot pies a little more runny.  Thanks for the recipe!

Really yummy! I love peas so I mixed in some frozen peas to the filling right before adding it to the crust. Next time I wont do that, the peas got too soft and turned the ugly greenish-brown. That was the only bad part of the dish, so I should have left the recipe how it originally was, perfect!

This was delicious!  I skipped the potatos and put double the turkey (about 3 cups)  I used half cream and half skim milk.  I used store-bought frozen pie crusts.  Easy and delicious!  I will make it again.

Made 2 pies with left over turkey grom Thanksgiving. I gave one to my Grandparents. Absolutely delicous! They want the recipe! I saved the other pie for my family. This recipe is definitely a keeper. Next in I will try using left over stuffing as a substitute for the top crust, as suggested in past reviews.

I didn't have turkey, so I used chicken instead and added some mushrooms. It turned out perfectly. It's also very easy to make.  Will definately make it again.

Very good!  The only reason I gave it a four for is because I would like it to have more sauce/gravy.  My husband loved it and had several helpings.  I made the crust with the "basic flakey pie crust" that is also listed on this site and it was the perfect combo.

i was apprehensive about trying this...but it was wonderful! i used peas instead of celery and cake flour for a fabulous crust.  i did take the advice of one reviewer and added 1.5 T of cornstarch to milk and it worked out perfectly.  i made 4 individual pies and froze 2 unbaked.

Made exactly the way listed in the recipe, it turns out a little bland. I like my food to have a little spice and more flavor. I added crushed red pepper flakes, chili powder, granulated garlic powder, and cajun seasoning. This helped, and all in all not a bad recipe for another left over turkey recipe.

I made a pot pie for the first time and love this ! One change I made : I used one potato and one carrot instead of two potatoes. I brought the leftover to work on the next day but it tastes best just our of oven.

It's OK - didn't turn out as good as the beef pot pie.  I think it's because I have a hard time finding convenience turkey meat (besides roasting my own turkey!)

This recipe was so easy! I used another recipe on this site to make a yummy crust. It all turned out so great! I didn't have all of the spices. I also added a can of cream of chicken soup just to thicken it up a bit. Yummy!

This was great!  A good way to use up leftover turkey. I omitted the celery and added peas, it dries up though if you keep it in the fridge for too many days.

I've made this so many times, it is a great recipe.  My boys are picky eaters and they both request this pot pie.  I have followed the recipe exactly and I have changed it other times.  I use less meat sometimes and add zucchini, corn or green beans.  It is easy to make a double batch and then freeze 1/2.  Thank you for the recipe!

I needed a recipe to use up some leftover turkey and happened to find this.  The only change I made was to add about 3/4 a can of cream of chicken soup.  It was excellent and smelled so good.  It is a definite keeper!!

Awesome recipe!  I have used this for left over turkey, for hamburger, for leftover meatloaf.  Very versatile recipe!  Try using Jiffy brand pie crust.  It makes a flaky and delicious crust.

There were no leftovers!  I substituted chicken broth for the bouillon.  In addition, I added frozen peas.

Pretty good - maybe use more turkey than the recipe calls for?

Just tried this recipe and it's EXCELLENT!!!!
I used a little more turkey broth when I saw it was a little too thick. Instead of carrots I used a package of frozen peas and carrots, and added a little poultry seasoning.
    Everyone raved about it.  Thanks.

Works great for chicken too!  I add celery seed to my pie crust to give it extra texture and flavor.

This meal was delicious!  I also added about a half cup of our hickory smoked gravy from the turkey we smoked on the bbq. This gave it a slightly smokey taste as well.  Yummy!

I reduced the parsley to 2Tbsp, I added about 1/2 - 3/4 cup more of broth, a can of mushrooms, a can or corn and a can of peas.  It was a tasty dinner but I don't think it was good enough to warrant the effort involved.

Wonderful!
I altered this a bit.  I used a low-fat crust and was a bit lighter on the butter.  Very nice!

I like this recipe for the basic proportions, although I did add extra broth (about 2/3 cup) as suggested. It was not dry. Next time I would also try the gravy on the side idea. I think it would be nice with the crust. (I used "Best Ever Pie Crust".) The seasoning was my problem. The oregano & parsley made it seem sweet for turkey. I will try  sage & thyme next time.

WOW!!  Just ate some of this, went back for seconds, then had a few extra bites out of the pan! Delicious! I added a clove of garlic to the veggie mix, added 2 cups of turkey, and left everything else the same. Thanks Linda, for this excellent recipe!

This recipe is excellent!  Yes, it does need time to prepare and bake, but my family enjoyed it a lot!  It has terrific flavor and not too soupy, just right.  Try it, you'll enjoy it.  I substituted chicken for the turkey, and it worked wonderfully.  Its the best pot pie recipe I have tried yet.

This is a good recipe.  I used a 9" pie pan and cut down on the amount of vegetables (half an onion, 1 stalk celery, 1 carrot and 2 small potatoes) so it fit perfectly in the pie pan. I also used one can chicken broth instead of the bouillon and water and added one package turkey gravy. Will try a chicken pot pie using this recipe and replace the turkey with chicken and adding some cream of chicken soup.

Made with leftover turkey - excellent! I didn't have celery, so I used peas instead. I also added extra milk and whipping cream to the turkey and flour. I thought the mixture was a little dry so I added a can of potato soup with about 1/2 C milk. Next time I will try something different or just add more milk to make more sauce. I used Pillsbury crust. My family really liked it! Thanks!

This was excellent and I have added it to my "old fashioned recipe box" but I think it could be even better with more veggies and maybe some more thickener. None the less scrrrrumptious. Thanks for the great recipe!

I never thought I would like pot pie so much. I added a twist by using the turkey from thanksgiving that I Bar-B-qued over coals. Nice smokey touch. Be sure to add enough water, or it will turn out a bit dry.

I have to agree with the not enough sauce but there is also WAY too much parsley for my liking anyways.  Its almost like parsley pie.  I will make it again but make some changes to the recipie next time.

Mmmmmm...  I substituted 3/4 light cream for the 1/2 cup milk (creamier sauce), and used fresh parsley.  Next time I will have to add some peas, as I did miss them.

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for to take care of [some] turkey leftovers. It was tasty, and relatively simple to prepare, but it was time consuming. Plan at least 30-40 minutes to prepare, then another 35 to bake. It was worth it though!

It was a perfect recipie.  I sustituted a grilled peppered turkey tenderloin for leftovers, and used vegetable broth instead of chicken bullion and water.  It was a great early fall dinner.
