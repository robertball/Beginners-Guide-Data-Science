I have been making this meatloaf for years. We all love it. I usually double the recipe and quick freeze the mini loaves for another meal.

Thanks to other poster on the tip for decreasing the milk.

This meatloaf has a good flavor, but I think there is too much milk and not enough spices in the meat mixture. I couldn't even shape it into "loaves" it was too mushy.I thought about adding some bread crumbs but thought maybe the oatmeal would soak up some of the milk. I also had to bake it longer to get rid of some of the moisture. I think I will try it using bread and just a few Tablespoons of milk and some salt and pepper next time.

I have made this many, many times and it is my husband's favorite meal.  (He is a very picky eater.)  You just can't go wrong with this recipe.

GREAT!!!!!!!!!!  Sorry, I changed it just a little.  Added 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1 tbsp worcestershire, and cooked onion with the beef.  I also added 3/4 cup oats since it was a little too mushy, but this made it a perfect consistency.  All in my home loved it.  Now my new meatloaf recipe.  (sorry Mom)

We really liked this recipe.  I used a mixture of ground beef and ground pork.  I also used seasoned salt rather than regular salt to add some flavor.  I did take a star away because we thought the sauce on top was too sweet.  Next time I will cut the sugar in half.  The nice thing about this was my neice still loved the fact that there was cheese in her meat loaf, but I didn't have to deal with the mess of it all running out like you get when you placed all the cheese in the center of the loaf.  I will keep this recipe in mind and make again for sure.

I thought this recipe was great!  I added some ingredients so it was a meal by itself.  I gave it only 4 stars because my kids didn't think it was so great.  I did make some changes...first, I decreased the milk by 1/4 cup, I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs instead of oats, and I add some things: 1/2 of a red pepper, about 1/4 cup of corn, some button mushrooms, and garlic.  On the sauce, I decreased the amount of the ketsup and added a touch of Wortschesire. My husband liked it a lot too, and I think, in time, so will my kids.

These were the best meat loaves I ever tasted.  I  used a mini-loaf pan that has eight mini loaves in it and it worked wonderfully - got to skip the forming part - yay!  My kids gobbled them up and so did my in-laws.  My husband said they were his favorite EVER!!  Thank you!!

I am afraid that we did not enjoy this dish very much. While the meatloaf was moist and the texture was quite nice, we did not find it to be flavorful. Neither of us could taste the cheese. In fact, the term “bland” came up several times during the meal. The sauce was good, though. In short, it was edible but not something we would ever want to have again. Probably just us since most everyone else liked it.

I really enjoyed this, but I thought that there was too much milk, the loaves were a little soft for my taste--next time I'll cut the milk by half.

Awesome! These were a huge hit tonight! My husband and non-meatloaf lovin' daughter claimed these were WAY better than traditional meatloaf. They really were outstanding and held together wonderfully. I didn't have oats so I used breadcrumbs. I'll make these quite often, I'm sure!

This is a GREAT recipe.  It has great flavor, is easy to make, makes great leftovers, and is easy to double so you can freeze some or serve a large crowd.  It's a hit with everyone I've served it to.

This recipe is great! I love the topping! I did add seasoning to it (my family likes spicy food!).
I also found it a little too mushy, maybe I'll decrease the milk by a little next time! I will definately make this one again! A great meal that the whole family loved!!!

I have been making these for some time now.  They are an awesome main dish.  Making individual loaves means that my husband can have just plain ketchup on his while I love the sauce called for in the recipe.

My meatloaf loving husband declared this the best recipe I've made. July 12, 2009 - still the best meatloaf I've ever made. This was the first recipe I made from this site, and still a favorite.

My husband LOVED these!  He said he wants them at least once a week!  I ended up making my own sauce because I found myself out of ketchup, so I used tomato sauce, vinegar, sugar, mustard, and a little barbeque sauce.  Luckily, I remembered to write down the recipe for the sauce because that was his favorite part!  I also substituted a colby/monterey jack cheese blend for the cheddar, which gave them a nice mild, sweet flavor.  Excellent recipe!  -Allison

Very tasty!  In place of the shredded cheddar I used cubed cheddar, which was a good cheesey choice.  I also added fresh ground pepper and some garlic powder.  I formed it into one meatloaf, because we love the leftover meatloaf made into sandwiches.  The glaze was just a tad sticky, but very good.

I never cared for meatloaf until I tried this dish! If you make it exactly like the recipe says, it can be bland so I add salt, garlic powder, and other spices to taste. Makes a big difference. Have made for company several times and have gotten raves every time! A keeper all the way!

I have subscribed to T.O.H. magazine for years.  I'm so excited to find them here at All Recipes!
  
This recipe for Cheddar Meat Loaves has been one of my family's favorites for a long time.  It is the only meat loaf recipe my family will eat!  I love the sweetness of the sauce.  I frequently prepare this dish in the morning before work, then cover w/foil and refrigerate until my son comes home from school.  He pops it in the oven with a couple baked potatos and I get to come home to a ready-to-eat supper!  Who could ask for more?

I love this recipe! I didn't find the meat mixture too mushy to work with at all, it was just fine. I added some black pepper and worcestershire sauce (I always do with beef) but that's really all that I changed.

Good recipe. Nice presentation. Glaze was a bit too sweet but can be easily modified.  Next time I will also decrease the milk to 1/2 cup and jazz up the flavor a little more with minced garlic and a dash of hot sauce.

This is our new meatloaf!  Our favorite part is the sauce on the top.

These are great. I usually make the loaves a little bigger, but wouldn't change a thing in the recipe.

This was so good!  I did cut down on the sugar in the glaze but it was yummy!  I double the recipe and freeze them individually.  They make a great fast meal!  Thanks!

Tastes absolutely wonderful, however the oil in the cheese may cause heartburn.

I made this recipe for a cooking group I am involved with.  I made 6 8x8 pans and 8 9x12 pans - and considering how many families tried it, it seemed to be loved by most!  It is a very kid and husband friendly recipe, and easy to prepare.  I froze them before baking, and they took some time defrosting, but were great!  I highly recommend this recipe!

This was a tasty and quick recipe.  I made them up ahead of time, stuck them in the fridge and headed off to work.  My husband put them in the oven when he got home.  He loved them!  They even made good leftover meatloaf sandwiches.

I went to Florida with my mom to visit my Grandmother.  I took along this recipe to make while we were there.  My mom liked it so much she know makes it at least 2 to 3 times a month.  My Grandmother also likes it.  She lives alone and these are freezer friendly. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!!

Just had to add some herbs (rosemary, oregano, etc.) to jazz it up a litle.  Baked as one loaf in a loaf pan.  Had plenty of sauce/topping.  We enjoyed!  Next time might add more oats.  Loaf was moist and tasty.

Very sweet meatloaf which my kids liked but not so much the adults. The topping was what did it I think.  I will make again since it was easy but cut down the topping ingredients a bit.   I didn't make individual loafs, instead I put it in a 11x7 dish and cooked for about 40 minutes. Thanks

I made this tonight and my family liked it.  I also replaced the oats with italian bread crumbs and it worked out good.  

What I like most about this recipe is that I can customize the mini loaves.  I can make some without the ketcup topping.  And since it was very bland to me, I can make some loaves with more seasonings.  Also, I could see making a double batch and freezing the rest for later.

I have been making this recipe for a awhile now, ever since I saw it in the TOH magazine. It is a favorite with the family. I love the serving size. The only change I had made to this was to lessen the brown sugar. I LOVE this sauce!

I reduced the amount of milk to about 1/4 cup and added another egg, 1/2 green pepper, some mushrooms, and parsley.  I also reduced the amount of brown sugar in the sauce to about 1/8 of a cup - with all of the sugar in the ketchup, you hardley need any.

MEAT LUMPS!!!! ;o) They were quick and easy. And we really liked these little meatloaves.  My 3 year old ate a whole one.  I did cut back on the milk and on the brown sugar as was suggested by others.  It was still a little too sweet. But I will definately make them again. Thanks

These weren't bad and they weren't hard to make - they just lacked flavor - a very basic meatloaf made into little loaves. Thanks for sharing but I can think why I would make them again.

Great Recipe.  Make sure to chop the onions up really small for the kids, or only use half as many... thought it was yummy, easy, and different.

Multiplied this recipe for 100 for our church to serve at the soup kitchen. People went out of their way to tell us how much they enjoyed this meat. Even the children loved them. I then made some for my meatloaf hating husband and he wanted to know when we were going to have them again. Thanks for another winner!

The individual meat loaves are great for serving.  The flavor was delicious and each loaf was covered with sauce.  There were no left overs.  I will definitely make this again.

I had searched all over for this recipe...made it once and my teenagers LOVED it (true meatloaf HATERS!).  Thought I had found in on the internet, and now realize I had probably gotten it from my Taste of Home magazine.  Glad I came across it again.  This time I SAVED it in my Recipe Box.  This is definitely MY favorite meatloaf recipe - nice and quick, and a little on the sweet side.

Maybe I did something wrong...we did not like this recipe at all.  My husband agreed that it tasted like BBQ mush.  My 2 year old son (who loves meatloaf) wouldn't eat this at all.  Sorry for the negative review.

These are amazing! Also very easy to make up a batch and freeze what you don't need for future meals if you're trying to eat better, but there's only 1 or 2 of you in the household!

My family has enjoyed these for years. I usually skip the ketchup mixture and just pour some bbq sauce from a bottle on top. That makes it even easier. I love having leftovers to freeze for another night.

The best part of this meatloaf is the sauce on top.  The meat itself is a bit bland. Maybe with some garlic and such it could be improved.

Great recipe.....
economical, tasty and versatile....
Sliced cold makes a great meatloaf sandwich! Stored in the fridge it, can be heated to it's original moistness with a steamer....a great fast shortcut to a delicious meal on a busy day.

Kids really liked it!  Added a couple of dashes of hot sauce to make it a little zingier...

I served these Li'l Cheddar Meat Loaves during a progressive church dinner.   I had a main meal at our home and what a hit these were.  Not only is the sauce great on the top, when I placed them on each plate, I put some sauce on the plate and then put the little meat loaf on top.  These are wonderful!!  I baked them in little alumnium pans that I found at Ollie's.  Perfect size.  SOOOO GOOD TOO!  Even my best friend wants to know how I made these delicious loaves.  I have friends wanting to know how to make this sauce for the tops too.  They do not believe me when I tell them how easy it is.  Thanks!!

I have been using this recipe for several years and it is THE BEST meatloaf I've ever made.  Very moist and the topping gives the little loaves a great flavor. Besides, they look really cute!  I'll never replace this one.

This was my first time making meat loaf (and the 1st time I ever liked it, too).  I did change it up a lil bit.  I sauteed the onions in about 3Tbsp. olive oil until tender.  Used 2/3 bulk sausage and 1/3 ground beef and also added extra oats because the olive oil I added to the onions made the recipe too moist.  Otherwise, I did everything else the same, and absolutely loved these little meatloaves!

These were OK, but nothing great. I have definitely had better meatloaf, so I won't be making this recipe again. They came out moist, but tasteless.

The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars was because of the topping. No one in the family liked it but they loved the loaves themselves! It is a great size for kids and they feel like they can have their very own loaf.

This receipe is great for kids.  My whole family loved it.  People who have heart problems can eat it because, of the low salt content.

I have found that the brown sugar DOES need to be reduced to half, at least for my family's taste. I also sometimes add crushed french fried onions-if I don't have any fresh onions- and instead of the oats, I prefer to use about 3/4 cup of seasoned bread crumbs. Lastly, I form this into a large oval in either a jelly roll pan, or 13x9 pan, and adjust the oven time to about 45-50 mins {very approximate guess!} The leftovers are great, and my family loves this dish. It can be greasy, but meatloaf has never been known to be a top health food, right?!!

This recipe is too bland, leave out the cheddar to save fat calories & add your favorite meat loaf spices. You don't taste the cheese anyway. Following others suggestions, I made the sauce with only 2 tbsp. brown sugar & it was great! Also, 8 loaves? They looked like meatballs! Make it into 4 instead, you can always cut them in half for serving.

I thought this was just okay.  I decreased the milk to 1/2 c. and added 1 clove garlic.  I could not taste the cheese and thought it was very greasy.  I might make again with some changes.

I'll have to agree with others who said there was too much milk in this recipe.  It was a bit mussy and I thought the sauce was too sweet.  It had a good flavor once I removed most of the sauce but I didn't really like this one enought to try again as it is. I think I'll try it with some bell pepper and leave out the milk all together, also I think I'll cut the brown sugar in half and increase the ketsup and mustard.

My family really enjoyed this.  I followed the reviews and reduced the milk to 1/4 cup and seasoned it with Lawry's, garlic salt and some pepper.  I also baked it for about 35 minutes before adding the topping.  Since the one in the recipe had received mixed reviews, I used a different one : 1/4 c ketchup, 2T brown sugar and 1 tsp. dry mustard.  I spooned this on and baked it for 10 more minutes.  Even the kids liked it!

Very easy recipe and quick to make.  Husband commented it was bit on the ketchupie-side, but I enjoyed it.  Maybe next time I will add some W-Sauce & cut back on the ketchup.  It will definately be a reoccuring meal in our home.

We thought this recipe was just o.k.  I decreased the milk to 1/2 cup, like others have suggested, and still found it a little mushy.  I didn't care for the texture with the oats.  I have a similar recipe that uses the same sauce on top, but uses seasoned bread crumbs, no Cheddar cheese, and uses about 1/3 jar of dried vegetable flakes.

This was a huge hit with my ultra-picky crew. Kids and husband loved the sauce. I usually have all these ingredients on hand and it stretches a pound of ground beef into two meals for a family of four (as long as the kids are little, anyway).

This was great! We usually don't like meatloaf, but this was yummy. I didn't have any oatmeal. I added a little flour to absorb some of the moisture. And instead of the ketchup mixture I put ranch dressing on top. It was a hit!

I have made these several times and my family loves them.  None of us care for regular meatloaf but these were great!

This recipe is really delicious.  I have never liked meatloaf, but this one is great!  It wasn't too mushy and the sauce wasn't too sweet.  With the cheese in it, it reminded me of a cheeseburger.  I served it for company and it was completely gone.  My husband had thirds.  My six-year-old, who does NOT like meatloaf, actually ate the whole thing.  This recipe is one I will make again and again.

This is one of our family favorites that I have been making for several years now.  I saw the recipe in the Taste of Home magazine and have passed it on to many friends and family members since then.  Thanks for the good eats!

Try this one, you won't be disappointed.  My family does not usually care for meatloaf but they love this one and more amazingly they requested I double the recipe so there would be leftovers.  Great taste, great texture, great recipe!!!
