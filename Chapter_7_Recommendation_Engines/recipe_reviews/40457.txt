This cocktail is absolutly delicious.  I did not have any sweet and sour mix on hand, so I used Margarita Mix, and it turned out great.  Serve well chilled and enjoy.

This was not like a regular Cosmopolitan at all. It was very sweet, with a fake candy taste, with none of the tartness of a regular Cosmo.

I've made this for 2 girls' nites and even those who typically don't like cosmos emptied their glasses more than one round.

It's okay if you like sweet drinks, but it is NOT a cosmopolitan.

This is definitely NOT a cosmo.  2-3 shots vodka, SPLASH of cranberry, SPLASH of triple sec.  It should be a faint pink not candy apple red and NOT that sweet. yikes.

While this may not be your "traditional" cosmo it is absolutely delicious!  It is requested by many of my friends but be careful!  They are potent!
