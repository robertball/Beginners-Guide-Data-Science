Nice flavor on the marinade. I love grilled salmon and this was a nice change of pace. If you're like me and don't like your salmon overcooked, I highly recommend you cook for less time. Mine was plenty done after 12 minutes - cooked through but very moist.

LOVED the flavors, but the grilling heat and time this recipe calls for seemed to dry up the salmon way too much, and I followed the instructions to the T.  Even at the midway point when I went to re-baste the fillets I noticed it was already seeming to dry at that point.  I think next time I will try this recipe again but on a stove-top skillet

Oiled my salmon and got it on the grill. I added more maple syrup and basted the fish while it was on the grill.  Wow.  It was delicious. This took me 12 minutes to grill.  6 minutes per side.

This turned out fantastic! Of course cooking time varies depending on the thickness of your fillet

I made this recipe as is and we loved it. Will do it again but will add half the salt as it was a bit too salty because of the soy sauce. I didn’t find it too sweet at all. Depends on your preference.

I have made this recipe several times, on the bbq and in the oven.  It's always tasty and easy to make. We followed the recipe exactly today, and it turned out as described, with the fish coming easily off the slightly crisp skin.

Too sweet and the maple flavor is too strong for our tastes. It was okay,but if I make it again, I will replace the maple syrup with honey and add more ginger. Although this will make it a completely different recipe, so I probably won't make this way again.

Really good as is! Just watch it on the grill. The syrup in the marinade burned a little.

Perfect marinade, easy to make and delicious. Good combination of sweet and salty. 10 minutes max cooking time on a preheated grill.
