Hubbs, kiddo & I loved this! Followed directions except for the butter & type of mussels. I used Smart brand butter & whatever my market had on hand for mussels. The scallops were teeny tiny so we did 1/2 pound. This will be made again. I added red crushed pepper & 21 Salute from Trader Joeâ€™s to just my plate. The only recommendation I would make is bread- you can use the scarpetta to soak up that delicious sauce!
