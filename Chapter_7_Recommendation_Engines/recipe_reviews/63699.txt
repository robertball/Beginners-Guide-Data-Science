This worked out well at our BBQ, I added some other veggies, and some chicken the next day with the leftover dressing, and it tasted great. We'll use this anytime we're doing kabobs!

This was very, very good...loved the flavor!  I also added large chunks of red onion to the kabobs.  (And omitted the rice, because I'm in Phase I!)
