Great easy recipe. I've used it to make cinnamon pull-apart bread several times. If you are new to using yeast and hot liquids, I'd suggest some caution  -- it's easy to kill the yeast if you let the milk get too hot on the stove. Use a themometer if you can't "guess" what about 115 degrees feels like. 
Thanks for the recipe!

This bread was great!  Everyone raved about it.  I'll definitely be making this again.  For everyone considering making this recipe:  be very careful when heating the milk mixture.  We had to do it twice as we killed the yeast the first time.  In the end we wound up throwing the ingredients in a bowl and putting them in the microwave for 30 seconds rather than heating them on the stove.  This worked perfectly and when we added the yeast it foamed just like the recipe says.

Yeast hint: If microwave the milk, be aware that the temperature may continue to rise 5 to 10 degrees F after you take it out. Let your milk sit for 5 minutes and after nuking and use a thermometer to make sure it is not over 105 to 110 degrees Farenheit when you add the yeast or you may kill it.

Attempted this recipe twice. The dough never rose.  I've made bread before and never had dough not rise before.  My yeast was new and the place I put the dough dark and warm.  I don't know what happened but I will not be attempting this recipe for a third time.

This is the best bread i have EVER had in my entire life. Incredible texture and taste. Try it topped in butter or make sandwiches with turkey and swiss cheese. Unbelievable, I'm not kidding. I also tried making it with whole wheat flour and it was very good as well. Use "i can't believe it's not butter" instead of butter for a lower-cal bread. YUM!!

I used this recipe to make monkey bread- my son asks for it every morning!  It worked great.  The milk/yeast mixture didn't get foamy like the recipe specified, but it rose perfectly!  Thanks!

One of the best bread recipes. Very simple recipe ,not overly crowded with directions. I used it to make loaves of cinnamon bread. It was perfect! It's also very easy to tinker up a bit.I did find the rise times a bit short so I opted for double in size except for the final. There, I ovened the loaves when they had risen and looked like loaves.For those who had failures to rise, remember that yeast is a very sensitive live culture. Too hot and you kill it. Too cold and it doesn't wake up. Salted butter works just fine although excess salt will slow the culture as will too much sugar. Just cut down on the recipe salt. If you start with warm liquid at about body temperature and it is slow to activate, just give it a bit more time. It will come around if your yeast isn't dead. Yeast culture needs to be foamy to make your dough rise.Don't give up on it.Another note, the final dough should be on the stiff side to give body to the final product. One thing to remember, you are making bread..and to be blunt,you need to work hell out of the dough. Keep kneading until you get tired--and then knead some more. when the dough is ready it should stretch much like melted cheese. This really is a great recipe and well worth the effort.

We fell in love with the sweet rolls they sell at the Aloha Stadium Swap Meet in Honolulu and this recipe nails it!  My first attempt, I killed the yeast.  Second time, (I omitted the butter from the yeast process), the milk was too cool so I set the bowl of milk, yeast & sugar into a larger bowl of hot tap water and viola!  It started foaming within minutes!  I took it out of the warm bath and let it activate for 10 mins and mixed the dough according to the recipe and added the softened butter with the eggs.  I brushed with melted butter before and after baking.  I mixed up cinnamon honey butter for spreading on them and my friends raved!  I'm making these on Thanksgiving, for sure!  And this was my first time EVER baking with yeast.

A great recipe!  I have used this for loaves, buns, and most importantly Cinnamon Buns using the Cinnamon Bun Icing recipe on this site.

I do have a question... I like the texture when I sub. Bread Flour (??Hard Flour??), but how do you modify the basic recipe to get the dough consistently to the correct elasticity??

I used this recipe to make braded cinnamon bread..  Simply follow the directions, cut raised dough in half, and roll out to form a large rectangle.  Spread butter evenly all over, and sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar.  Fold in half, and cut 3 even strips leave one end connected, pinch all open seams,  then brad and wrap around to form a circle.  Bake as suggested. Pour any sweet glaze over top before it cools.

This is the perfect recipe to make any sweet creation, thank you for sharing…

This was a very good bread recipe and I made it in my bread oven. I just melted the butter and warmed the milk before adding it to the machine. I didn't think it was sweet enough for true sweetbread but it is very versatile ans delicious so I gave it 5 stars.

This is a simple, lovely, versatile recipe. I have never had bread not rise and have been making at least one loaf weekly for years, the simplest trick is to not use old yeast, and to stick your finger in the liquid. It should be very warm but not burn. I have never used a thermometer to measure it.

You can let your bread machine do the dough cycle for this. It works quite well.

I love this! Thank you so much for this recipe. I add cinnamon sugar and vanilla sometimes but this in itself is very good! I also drizzle warmed nutella over the rolls, which makes a very good morning treat.

This was my first stab at baking with yeast. It turned out quite well. They tasted lovely, and I paired them with chicken in wine sauce. They did turn out more like a biscuit rather than a roll, but they were yummy!

Mine rose fine and it tastes great! I even used expired yeast. I live in a a very dry climate although. The only thing that I noticed about the recipe is that is states to add oil to the mixture, and then later in the directions it states to use half the oil for the bowl and the other half for the baking pan. So all 2 Tablespoons of my oil went into the dough, and I used my bread machine to knead the dough without any oil and a squirt of Pam on the cookie sheet. I'm not sure if this is how it was supposed to be, but it turned out fine for me. Also so far I've just used a little less than half of this to make 20 small dinner rolls and I have plenty left which I'm considering portioning out into dinner rolls and freezing.

I made it! My husband and kids love it. I've made small changes though. I didn't put the melted butter together with warm milk, sugar and yeast. I mixed  it with the flour instead (I melt the butter in microwave for 35 seconds, then let it cool down for 5 minutes before I mixed it with flour, salt and eggs). In my experience, compare with the one that I did exactly like the recipe said, with this way my dough rise beautifully.  I also reduced the baking time to 15 minutes. It made a nice golden brown on my bread. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, @irocket !

Simple and easy bread recipe. I followed the recipe to a T. Used this recipe to make pigs in blankets and the bread turn out wonderful! Reason why I only rate it 4 stars is bc the title sweet bread just wasn't sweet enough.  Next time instead of 1/3 cup sugar I will make it 1/2 cup sugar.  Thanks for recipe :)

Very first time making yeast bread with 4.5 Q KitchenAid mixer. Success! (And I just learned how to use yeast 2 weeks ago). Thank you for the recipe. Very easy to follow and common ingredients. Before baking I brushed with whisked whole egg. Texture and presentation is lovely. My kids love it too!

This is a great recipe! I made chocolate chip bread with it. I had some left over and made plain rolls. The boy said its his favourite of my breads so far :-) I killed the yeast on my first attempt. The milk really does need to be just warm. It rose beautifully and my wreath came out lovely. I'll use this recipe in the future for sure,
. Thanks for sharing :-)

If I could give this 0 stars I would.  The bread did not rise.  It was just awful.  I don't know what I did wrong.  Should I have left it longer to rise?

I prepared this recipe for the first time today, cutting the proportions in 1/2 as a tasting test  ..  end result was a bit crumbly as someone else said but the taste was just sweet enough without being overwhelming  ..  will use again because it allows for so many variations  ..  perfect for cinnamon or french toast, bread pudding or whatever your imagination creates  ..  Thank you for sharing

Soft and slightly sweet. They come out perfect everytime even if you subsitute for whole wheat flour. I've also used it to make cinnamon rolls many times. Great recipe!

Simple recipe with a very good taste.  I would have liked for it to be a little fluffier and not so crumbly though.  I tried this for dinner rolls with butter, which was good.  I used it the next morning for a ham, egg and cheese sandwich.  Not bad.  The best was when I made a roast beef sanwich.  The sweet flavor in the bread mixed nicely with the meat.  I'll keep this recipe filed, but will continue to look for a fluffier dinner roll recipe.

Used the dough to make cinnamon rolls. OMG!!!!!! They tasted just as good as the mall chains if not better. Topped them with a vanilla cream cheese glaze. One thing be very careful with the temp if the milk. My first attempt the yeast didn't bloom because I didn't let the milk get hot enough to melt the butter.Next attempt I brought milk up to temp and added butter then bought it back up to temp, and that worked perfectly. Didn't have a rolling pin  so I used an empty wine bottle and it rolled like silk, also used the back of a 1/2 sheet to  roll the dough on and that was the perfect size.I Got 8 rolls out of the recipe, 2 which were HUGE. Even used parchment paper to line pan with just like the mall chain for easy clean up. Will definitely use again but next time will 1/2 it

What a great, easy recipe!  Made it with 4 preschoolers; it's forgiving, and delicious!  I had the kids roll it into small loaves, baked it, and it came out perfect.

My dough isn't rise we'll either. Maybe because the recepie ingred states 2 tablespoons of oil. I put both in the dough.  Was one for the dough and the 2nd for coating possibly?

One of the most consistently tasty recipes I have encountered, and I use it pretty regularly in my household now. Basic, but versatile! I can add more sugar/honey if I need a sweeter batch or leave it as is for breakfast rolls. I also braid it like challah for dinners with my church group. Thanks for sharing this!

Made these as rolls for dinner tonight. It was my first attempt at making any yeast rolls and they were pretty good.  I'll make these again with a little personal tweaking.

Love It! It didn't work for me on the first attempt but I know what I did wrong (the milk mixture was too hot for the yeast) . I tried a second time and I am so glad I did. I recommend this easy recipe to everyone! Thank you

This recipe didn't work for me. It wouldn't rise well, it was dense. Maybe it would be better sea level, but here in colorado, it was disappointing.

I tried making this twice, both times my bread never rose.  I wonder if the yeast was over stimulated with the temp of sugar, milk and butter, perhaps too hot.

This was my first time baking bread, and it turned out to taste wonderful!  Especially with some home made butter to go along.  My only complaint was that it was slightly crumbly, but that was probably my own fault.  Still, it made five little loaves and was great.

Fantastic, simple recipe. The bread is sweet, but not too sweet. I add 1 tsp "ground mixed spice" and about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of dried peel and cranberries to make the PERFECT Hot Cross Buns. My Brit ex-pat tells me they're closer to the real thing than any other recipe.

This recipe was great. Simple and enjoyable. I used a non-sticking spray to reduce some calories and put it into the mold and it worked fine. I definitely recommend this recipe to anyone.

The bread wasn't as sweet as I expected it to be so next time I'll add more sugar. But overall this was a great recipe. My kids and husband love it. We even used the bread to make grilled cheese sandwiches. They were the best ever!

Not exactly what I expecting, but they are tasty. I had hopes of it tasting similar to the Hawaiian King’s rolls after reading some of the reviews , but it honestly tastes more like day of the dead bread when you add sugar.

I was lazy. So I threw all the ingredients in my bread machine dough cycle (45 min).  Divided the dough into rolls. Waited 45 min to rise. Then baked for 20 min.

Fluffiest rolls. It was delicious with cinnamon butter and I can't stop eating them.

I used egg nog mixed with lemon juice and maple syrup instead of milk. I didn’t heat the milk but it was a warm kitchen and I let it sit... So good! I added brandy for flavoring and got a little crazy with the egg wash but it turned out great! I let it rise twice for longer times than the recipe and folded in walnuts these the end. I will be making this again!

Made this into caramel and apple sweet scrolls. Was easy to make and even though the dough was rolled out thinly it puffed up really well to get decent sized scrolls.  Managed to make 36 from 1.5  x the recipe.  Was a nice cross between a dough and a cake and very fluffy.   Will make again.

I love baking bread, and I thought I'd try this recipe as a deviation from my usual bread-making routine.  The bread was a tremendous success, and it even kept well overnight, though the edges tend to get a little crisp and stale if left out.  I will definitely be making this bread again.

Super simple and delicious!  I added some canned red bean paste into the middle of the rolls to make a bao-like breakfast or snack.  Definitely will make again.

Made this exactly as directed. Taste was great, but mine turned very brown after only 20 minutes of baking. Inside was still very good. Will try these again at a slightly lower temperature.

after many, to many to even count failed attempts to make home made yeast bread finally a recipe that turned out pretty much perfect first try!! I did use a digital scale and thermometer to make sure everything was exactly correct seeing as how I am an inexperienced baker. I was singing to the heavens when this dough plumped up so beautifully .  Definitely keeping saved and will make many times to come. one batch of dough made 4 mini monkey breads and 8 regular rolls. thanks so much. 10 stars in my book!!!

This was a fairly easy recipe to follow. The only difficulty I had was getting the dough to rise. I finally got the dough to rise by adding another yeast mixture to the dough and re kneading. The additional water and flour I added to the dough may have diluted the sweetness of the bread and may have made it more dense rather than a light consistency.  But I will definitely try this recipe again and will use the instant yeast packs and possibly add more sugar.

It is a great recipe. I will definitely be making it again . If ever you are having an issue about  it raising, it maybe because the milk, sugar and butter mix was too hot for the yeast resulting in it not raising properly.

Easy, tasty, goes a long way.  Followed the recipe as stated. Instead of rolling into balls, I used a round cookie cutter so they would all be the same size. That worked great.  Brushed them with butter when they came out. Everyone enjoyed them, froze the rest for later. Will definitely make again.

I replaced the sugar in the recipe with honey and it turned out great! Soft, fluffy and sweet. I had to add more flour than the recipe indicated, but it turned out great.

Tried this twice, both times it wouldn't rise...thinking maybe I used a salted butter?? Will check it in the morning! If so, off to the store in the morning for some unsalted butter and we'll try it again!

LOVED this Recipe!  Just made it this morning.  Ok, I admit I was expecting a sweet roll, you know Sweet!  This wasn't what I was expecting, but it was still Good.  My husband came in the door for lunch and asked if I had made bread.  He ended up eating TWO of the rolls for lunch.  They would make a excellent dinner roll due to the fact that they aren't heavy like a regular store bought roll, and they do have a little sweet to them.  The only two additions I made was a little more flour in the bowl while it was mixing as it seemed a bit wet to me, and while it was  mixing I added a little bit of cinnamon.  I didn't measure it, I just tapped it out while the dough hook was mixing.  My husband wants me to make these again for the Holidays!

My son liked these (tho' he's 18 and likes everything!) but my husband and I did not. This recipe tasted just like dinner rolls, but dry. So so dry. If I wanted a dinner roll recipe I would have looked for one. I wanted sweet bread. This is not it. It needs to be sweeter and moister.  I want to try tweaking this and see if I can get it to come out better, or I will look for another recipe.  That said, the texture was great...good outer crust and firm bread inside.
