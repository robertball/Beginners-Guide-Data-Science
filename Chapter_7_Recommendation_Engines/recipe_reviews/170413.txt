This is excellent! I was cleaning out the freezer of my husband's deer meat getting ready for the new season (didn't have any elk) and ended up using some white tail chops and stew meat (abt 2lbs). I normally always follow a new recipe as written (and would never rate it down if I made changes and didn't like it!) but ended up making a couple changes out of necessity and LOVED the results!   I couldn't find the cream of onion soup (have never heard of it either) so I used cream of mushroom.  I also used beef broth instead of water and chopped fresh sage leaves instead of rubbed which I was out of.  I browned the meat a bit before adding to the crock pot and deglazed the pan with the beef broth to get the browned bits and add more flavor to the dish.  Yes, a tiny bit more work but it was SO good!  I served it over rice and my husband and little ones loved it.  I may try adding some sauteed/browned mushrooms next time... This recipe is a keeper!

If you don't have elk roast, this is really good using round steak.

This was delicious, of course I had to make substitutions for what I had on hand... I used elk stew meat instead of roast, which turned out so tender! and I didnt have cream of onion soup so I used cream of mushroom and added extra onion. I was in a hurry and accidently added sour cream in the beginning,but it still turned out. I also threw in some mushrooms for fun. My husband added some johnnys seasoning when my back was turned, and although it did make it taste better, the recipe was fine without it.I will definitely use this recipe again, maybe next time without the substitutions!

This is the best elk roast recipe I've tried.  Very flavorful.  I'm not a big fan of the flavor of elk but this hid it perfectly.  Yummy and very easy.

I made this with cream of celery since I did not have the cream of onion.  The flavor was excellent, but the meat was very tough, even after 8 hours of slow cooking.  We had to cut it up and serve it like a roast.

This was excellent. I substituted leftover steak for the elk roast and used jasmine rice adding a tablespoon of sourcream on top of each serving w/ a dash of paprika. It was the best dinner we have had in awhile.

i used deer meat and did'nt have time to slow cook it, so i threw everything "except the sour cream" in a pan and simmered it for 2 hours then added the sour cream and simmered another 30 minutes. it turned out great. very tasty.

Very good. Couple minor variances. Used cream of mushroom, used beef broth instead of just water, added a few tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce to the recipe, and in the end thickened it slightly with corn starch. Served over rice and noodles, but I'm sure mashed potatoes would be good too. We used stew meat chunks from the elk my son harvested this fall and didn't shred the meat, but rather served it in chunks. Was very tender after about 5 1/2 hrs. in the crock pot. One note about cooking with wild game, rinse your meat off & soak it in milk or buttermilk at least overnight before preparing. That helps tenderize the meat and takes a little of the gamey taste away.

If I could give this recipe more than 5 stars I would!  It's incredible!  I haven't been able to find cream of onion soup but I've made it with cream of celery and cream of mushroom and it has been amazing either way!  I also add about 1 lb of mushrooms and cut the water down to 1/2 cup to make up for the water the mushrooms add.  I usually serve it over egg noodles and it always gets rave reviews and my guests always go back for seconds and thirds!  Thank you for this deliciously easy recipe!!!  It's a favorite in my house!

It's hard for me to rate this.  I made the recipe with only the following changes: used cream of mushroom soup (not sure what cream of onion is), and added some sautéed mushrooms to the crockpot.  I served this with mashed potatoes. It was a good stroganoff but I realize now that elk meat is just not for me.  I thought the meat, although tender has a strange texture and not a great flavour.  I won't eat again, its just not something I enjoyed - but the recipe was a good one, and if you like elk meat, perhaps this is a nice way to try it.

This is delicious! I made a few changes added a packet of onion soup and switched out cream of mushroom soup for cream of onion (just didn’t have it on hand)  next time I might try to add a thickening agent to the sauce when I add the sour cream... for sure going to make this one again.

My son-in-law received a large elk roast and my daughter wanted to use it up. My daughter has celiac so needed to make GF. Made with GF mushroom soup, 2 cans. Roast was probably about 4 pounds. Also used beef broth in place of water. It smelled wonderful cooking in the crockpot all day. I left before it was done, but they, and my son and daughter-in-law who they invited over said it was delicious! They served it over rice.

It was okay, but I followed the recipe  exactly (even found the cream of onion soup) and we were not impressed with the overall flavor.  As I said, it was just okay. The elk was tender, but the flavor of the liquid/soup/gravy/broth was just nothing special at all - kind of bland.  We would  not make it again.  Anyone else have a better recipe?

This recipe is wonderful! My father in law is big on hunting so we are always getting sent home with some kind of game. Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out just like it's described. Had it the first night with noodles and the leftovers with mashed potatoes using the sauce as gravy, so good! Will definitely be making this again!

Very tasty! This is the first Elk Roast I've made. I wasn't paying attention and added the sour cream in at the beginning, Still tasted great! I did add some additional water as well and carrots about half way through cooking. Served over wild rice.

Very delicious! I didn't have steak seasoning or sage so I omitted those. Used one can of cream of mushroom soup instead of onion. I didn't have a roast so I used ground elk instead. Everything else was the same. Yummy! The hubby loved it!

I used moose meat and it was great also.  Used cream of mushroom soup and the taste was awesome!  I need all the help I can get using up all the moose meat we have.
