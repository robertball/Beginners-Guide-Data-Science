This worked out well and is as easy as it looks.  I added a table spoon of sugar and a pinch of salt. Having no butter milk in the house I used 3/4 cup yogurt with 1/4 whole milk .

I believe the amount of buttermilk in this recipe is entirely too much and should be 3/4 cup, a little less if you use skim milk soured with vinegar. I followed the recipe but ended up having to add more cornmeal. The process of cooking stovetop works though. So here is what I will do next time: Whisk together 1 cup self-rising cornmeal, 3/4 cup buttermilk, 1 egg. Pour 1/4 cup into a non-stick skillet and cook over medium low heat until browned; flip and brown the other side. If desired, butter bread at this point.

LOVE These! So easy! I added a drizzle of honey to the mix and topped the cakes off with fresh blueberry topping and more honey. YUM!

Me and my 3 year old son love them.  He is a picky eater too.  I can't even get him to try cornbread but he will eat these.

I did not have buttermilk, so I used one cup of 1% milk. I let the batter sit  just a little bit to thicken before I poured it. These were very good and I will make them again.

Great stuff. Simple. I added a little sugar because Iâ€™m a sweet cornbread fan.
