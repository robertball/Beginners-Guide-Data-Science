I have never had ham loaf before and I thought this was delicious.  The horseradish saved this from being too sweet.. was a nice layer of flavor in this. Will make this again.. great idea for Christmas ham leftovers

Used whole wheat bread crumbs instead of rolled oats. Loved the horseradish sauce!
