My family loved these cookies.  I use butter in cookies instead of shortening and also added raisins. I have a request to always have these baked and handy!

I followed the recipe exactly only added a teaspoon of cinnamon and a cup chocolate chips. They won't eat anything in my house without chocolate in it. My cookies were not crumbly and dry at all they were chewy and moist. I did use a reduced fat peanut butter I don't know if that had anything to do with it and the shortening I used was butter flavored. This recipe was a great way to "hide" the whole-wheat flour, usually you have to use a blend of white and whole-wheat flour. The peanut butter was prominent which masked the taste of the whole-wheat and the oatmeal masked it's grainy texture. I thought these cookies were plenty sweet enough. The only thing I would like to reduce is the amount of shortening by replacing it with apple sauce to make it a slightly more healthier alternative.

Excellent. No wheat flour after taste. I substituted a half cup applesauce for shortening, added a cup of chopped nuts and a couple handfuls of raisins. After the first panful, I added a third of a cup of sugar to the rest, which made the rest much better. Will make again.

This is a great recipe. When I made it, I used honey roasted peanut butter and added semi-sweet chocolate chips (3 cups with the original recipe). If you add the chocolate chips, be sure to reduce the brown sugar by 1/4 cup. Otherwise, you will have some really sweet cookies!

NOTE: If you reduce the recipe to make 2 dozen (with chocolate chips), then a 1/3 and 1/4 cup of brown sugar works. That's what I use.

Fairly healthy and tasty cookies.  Not too sweet.  Makes large batch and the cookies freeze well.  Good with milk or coffee.  Could be more peanutbuttery.

These cookies were soooooo good!  I only put 1 cup of butter and I only had 1 cup of peanut butter so I added 1/4 cup olive oil to the recipe.  I also added 2 handfuls of chocolate chips.  Those are the only changes I made and they turned out  fantastic.  My whole family loves them.  I will definetly be making these again.

These were delicious.  I did use canola oil instead of shortening.  But, the peanut butter flavor did overpower the oatmeal flavor a tad, so next time I will use half as much peanut butter.

these cookies were a hit. loved the unexpected compliment of the peanut butter and oatmeal together. I added some seasoned applesauce, used all butter, and also added craisens and dried blueberries and vanilla extract.

I have made this recipe several times and it's a no-fail effort, even at Denver's altitude.
I have added raisins, chocolate chips, cinnamon, butterscotch chips, and combinations, all with great success.
When I prepare this recipe, I like to use natural crunchy peanut butter and increase the salt by 1/2 tsp, since I use shortening and not butter â€” it adds to the flakiness and pie-crust-like texture of the cookies.
A great variation I've found is to omit 1/2 cup of brown sugar and put turbinado or white sugar on top. I do this by carefully shaping balls of dough and pressing them into a plate containing sugar. It's a wonderful crunchy top for these surprisingly light and delicious cookies.
One thing the recipe doesn't mention is DON'T OVERMIX when adding dry ingredients to the shortening mixture. The cookies come together just fine, and are flakier when mixed until they just come together.
What an awesome recipe!

My family really enjoyed these cookies! My husband loves oatmeal cookies and I wasn't sure how he would like peanut butter/oat combo but he really, really liked it (said they were one of the best he's had)! I used butter (just don't use shortening) and all natural peanut butter. My son wanted me to add raisins per suggested by other reviewers and I was happy with that addition. I think they would be great without too. No one had any idea that these have whole wheat flour :) I made the dough; baked one dozen and individually froze the other 2 dozen. I have since pulled out a dozen to bake when needed and they turned out well! Great way to resist eating too many in one sitting!

Woo-ee, this recipe makes a TON! Woo-ee! I used Trader Joe's chunky peanut butter, free-range eggs, white flour and half white sugar (I was running low on brown sugar). 350 for 8 minutes made for a perfect cookie, little soft all around. Huge hit with my boys. I liked these because there was no need to chill the dough and they didn't spread or stick to the pan.

I used butter instead of shortening, and only used 1 cup instead of 1 1/2 cups.  I used old fashioned oats, because that was what I had on hand.  They turned out great!!  Love them!

These were pretty good! Next time I'll use half whole wheat and half white flour, I found them a little grainy. Overall a good cookie :-)

I loved these cookies. My daughters boyfriend loves oatmeal cookies so we couldn't decide between peanut butter or oatmeal. I found this recipe and figured what the heck it would combine both. They were soft, chewy and buttery just the way I like it. Thank you for posting this recipe.

This recipe is great! I was leary of the whole wheat flour taste coming threw after it was baked. But to my surprise, the kids never even noticed that I used whole wheat flour.  I did cut back on the brown sugar to 1 cup packed.  It didn't stop the kids from chomping down these cookies.  Will diffently make again and again.

These were awesome!!  I did not have shortening so I used butter and also whole wheat flour instead of white.  These went so fast in our house!  My husband asked me to not make another batch so he would not eat them all! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe with us!!

Great base recipe! My first thought was "that's a lot of shortening" so I substituted 2 sticks butter and 1/2 cup coconut oil. I didn't have regular whole wheat, so I used whole wheat pastry flour and white whole wheat. I used regular oats and only used 1/2 tsp of salt too. Took them out at 9 min. every time and they were perfect. My boys and I love them!

This recipe is awesome as is. After a few batches I substituted 1 cup of butter and 1/2 cup butter flavor shortening. Amazing. I've also started using about 1 cup of peanut butter chips for more pb flavor. Sometimes we add chocolate chips. Everyone raves about these cookies. And I like the fact it uses whole wheat flower and oatmeal.

These are some seriously tasty cookies. The texture is amazing...soft, yet nice and chewy. The oats give them that amazing texture, and they also make these healthier than a lot of other cookie recipes. I really liked the use of whole wheat flour...no one who has tried these has been able to guess that they contain whole wheat flour. The peanut butter flavor is great, and all the ingredient amounts are perfect. I did use half butter and half shortening, because I don't think shortening is real healthy, and this recipe has a LOT of shortening in it. Other than that, I made these as written, and I'd definitely make them again. They're great! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

These are awesome peanut butter cookies.  I like that they use wheat flour and oats and they stayed soft and chewy.  I only made half a batch which yielded plenty of cookies for our family of 5. After baking 2 batches, I added in some peanut butter chips for the last batch, and those were even better and, of course, the first ones eaten.  So now we will add those in the beginning.

I followed the recipe and found the cookies to be too sugary. I was hoping that with ingredients like oatmeal and whole wheat flour these cookies would have been more wholesome.

These are fabulous!  I usually don't like cookies made with all wheat flour, but the peanut butter masks the taste, so they are delicious and nutricious!  Only change was I made them with butter.

This recipe was alright. They fell apart too easily and  the flavor didn't blow me away. HOWEVER!!!!! I saved half the cookie dough and I pressed it into a pie pan! I baked it at 350 for about 12-15 minutes. Let it cool then poured 2 packages of chocolate pudding pie mix in. Drizzled some peanut butter on top and put it in the fridge for a few hours. IT MADE AN AMAZING PIE CRUST! My family went nuts for it! The pie didn't even last through the night! So as a cookie recipe this wasn't good, but as a pie crust- FABULOUS!!!!!!!!!!

Great taste and perfect texture. They are soft with a little crispness on the outside.  Best peanut butter oatmeal recipe I've used.

The only change I made was add chocolate chips. I love the idea of whole wheat flour as an ingredient. One word to describe these cookies is delicious!

My family and friends found these cookies to be quite delicious.  They do have a very flaky, crumbly texture.  They freeze well which is good because the recipe makes many, many cookies.  Plan to share when you bake a full batch of these!

Great cookies!  I did alter mine on the second round for my own preferences......I changed the servings to 48 because I always freeze half of them.  I only changed a few things to the recipe itself.....I used 1 stick of butter flavor crisco and 2 sticks of real butter.  I also like to use the country style oatmeal so I left out a cup and just used 3 cups.  Then of course I love choc. so I added 2 cups of M&M's and a cup of raisins.  I  baked these on my baking stones for about 13 to 14 mins.  which gave me a nice thick, chewy and slightly crisp cookie.    Perfect cookies to take on our Trail Rides!  Delicious!   Thanks so much for the recipe, these are a keeper.

good combination... of oats and peanut butter I did substitute to make healthier though, grapeseed oil in place of shortening,  sorgum flour/Teff flour combo instead of wheat  flour and maple syrup instead of sugar...added a touch of shredded coconut as well. Great idea to combine the two, happy cooking ! I gave 4 stars due to my changes :0)

YUM! I agree with other reviewers--butter makes these delicious. I never have quick cooking oats in my house, so I used regular rolled oats which gives these a wonderful texture. I might even use more oats next time. I also added chocolate chips.   Be sure not to overbake these. They're much better soft--more peanut butter flavor, better texture. I baked my first batch for 13 minutes which made them too crispy. By the end, I was only baking them for 9 minutes which was just right.

These were absolutely phenomenal!! I made them for my family with a few changes based on what others said-I did go with 2 cups of Quick cook oats, I didnt have any shortening, so I substituted that for 1 stick of margarine, and 1 stick of butter. I added a tablespoon of vanilla as well. THEY WERE SUPERB!!

Being on a diet I had a sweet tooth and wanted to eat something sweet. I used butter instead of shortening, splenda brown sugar blend, instead of brown sugar, and low fat peanut butter. I found these cookies to be excellent considering the ingredients and the ease to make.

This was a very good recipe.  I'm always looking for ways to sneak in whole wheat and oatmeal and this recipe did both with great results.  They were easy to overbake though so if you want chewy cookies take them out when set and light brown on edges.  They would be even greater with peanut butter chips:).

These cookies are already soooo delicious but try using chunky peanut butter for an extra crunch.  Also, try adding some Cinnamon, it goes really well with the peanut butter.  Emma;-)

Very good - and a sneaky way to get my 2 year old to eat more whole grains!  

I doctored up half the batch with shredded carrot and raisins - Very yummy.  I didn't measure, just eye-balled it.

The first half of the recipe, the undoctored half, tastes remarkable like the cookie part of the Girl Scout peanut butter sandwich cookies (but softer).  

I'll definitely be making these again.

These cookies were great! I used butter instead of shortening. I also cut the ingredients in half. (I had to crack one of the eggs in a separate bowl to split it in half) I also baked each batch for 8 - 10 min. I found that flattening them with a fork didn't work very well so I rolled little balls and squished them slightly flatter with my hand. Yummy!

Really good cookies. Just the right amount of sweet. My mom and dad liked them. This was my first time making home-made cookies. The only problem was that I could not taste the oats at all so it's basically like they like just went to waste. I had to use dark brown sugar instead, I used only about half the amount of shortening and I only had white flour so I used that.

I love these cookies!!! they made the best no bakes. I was out of eggs so in substitute I used 2 tbsp of water 1 tbsp of oil and 2 tsp of baking powder for every egg. Then put the cookie dough by tbsp in a Ziploc bag and froze over night. They turned out amazing!! Will definitely make again. :)

One of my family's new favorites!!!  We used 1 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortening on one batch, all butter on another, and they were so good!  Be sure not to overbake, b/c they become very dense.

Yum!  Just pulled my first bacth out of the oven.  This recipe is definitely a keeper; glad it makes a big batch.  I keep the dough in the refrigerator and bake fresh for school lunches.  I used 1C butter and 1/2C shortening and they were tender and delicious.  I didn't flatten them, just used a small scoop to portion them onto the baking sheet.  Can't wait to try some variations, like chopped peanuts and chocolate chips.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Made recipe using all purpose flour not wheat. Didnt seem to make a difference, the texture was good and they were very chewy. Also added peanut butter chips, but the cookie seemed to lack flavor.

These are a great way to take care of a peanut butter craving. The cookies have a nearly perfect crunch-to-chewy ratio. I substituted butter for the margarine (my only alteration to the original recipe). Lots of peanut flavor. I baked these for 9 minutes and they turned out really well. A great way to fill your cookie jar!

I used white flour instead of whole wheat (it's all I had in the house). These cookies are like crack, especially the next day! Everyone's crazy about them and they were SO easy to make. Definitely a keeper.

These were very good.  I did make quite a few changes because of what I had on hand.  I used margarine instead of shortening I would still use this because shortening tends to make things taste greasy.  I only had 1 cup of brown sugar so I added 1 cup of white sugar.  And I used the old fashioned oats because I like the texture as opposed to the quick oats that are crumbly and flakey.  I baked them for exactly 12 minutes and they came out chewy with a crisy texture around the edges.  After cooling they did not get crumbly.  Maybe with the changes I made that is why.  Not sure.  But I will definitely make these again.  Thanks for the great recipe.

WONDERFUL cookies. I used natural pb, dark brown sugar, and replaced the butter with Smart Balance 67% margarine spread (no trans fats) with good success. I also put chocolate chips in half the batch - yum! These cookies are so good and it's nice to know that I'm serving my family a cookie that's somewhat healthy in addition to being delicious.

Rich and yummy!  I used natural peanut butter, so I needed to add more brown sugar.

GREAT recipe, and a healthier alternative with the whole wheat flour and oats.  I reduced the sugar to 1 2/3 cups and added one more egg (4 total) which made them more cake-like and less crumbly.  I bake them 11 min. then press a Hershey's kiss into the middle of each cookie and bake an additional 2 min. Perfect!  I've also added mini M&M's to the batter and baked them that way, and those were excellent too.  The whole family loves them!

I cut the recipe in half and used 1 stick of regular butter, 1/2 cup honey, 1/2 cp smooth PB and 1/2 cp chopped peanuts, 2eggs, No salt. Baked at 325. Plenty sweet enough and I loved the honey/PB combo!

This is a great recipe.  I did not have exactly everything for ingredients so I winged it.  I did not have enough oatmeal but I had those instant packaged ones in cinnamon swirl.  I used 3 of them along with that little bit of oatmeal I did have.  I also used butter in place of the shortening.  Makes a big batch.

Yum, Yum, Yum! These cookies are so good! I followed the recipe except switching margarine for shortening (trying to use it up, I will use ghee next time). I also used crunchy peanut-butter, regular oatmeal, and chocolate chips. This is our new go-to cookie recipe!

I made a small batch of these the other night when I was overtaken with a need for cookies. I liked that it used whole wheat flour. These were yummy warm. No idea how they tasted cold because since I made a small amount, I ate them ALL when they were hot!

I've made these twice according to the recipe with the same batch (I froze half the dough).  The first time they turned out OK, but they were a bit dry and crumbly without much peanut batter.  I baked them for the recommended 12 minutes and although they did not look overdone, they were.  I made the other half last night, but added a half cup of raisens (1 cup for recipe) and baked for 9 minutes - they turned out great and it was amazing the difference in peanut butter flavor.  Great Recipe - be careful not to over bake!

The best peanut butter cookies I have ever had.  My husband could not stop eating the dough.  Only changes I made was I used chunky peanut butter instead of regular smooth peanut butter; did not have shortening so used 1 cup of butter as a substitution. AWESOME COOKIE!

With all due respect to the recovery community, we call these "crack cookies" because they're so addictive.  They're fantastic.  I've had better luck with all butter instead of shortening, and I add mini morsel chocolate chips.  Simply amazing.

The whole family loves this!  I made a few changes, one by removing the shortening and substituting it with more peanut butter.  The oatmeal, we found takes out alot of the yummy peanut buttery taste if we don't. I also added one half cup unsweetened applesauce, which gave it a creamier and less crumbly consistency.  Delicious!

these cookies are superb! had a ton of PB in my cabinets and wanted to do something tasty with it, so I made these. I added a few touches though, such as 1/2 cup of PB chips, used butter instead of shortning, and froze the dough fo a few hour before baking (only becuz i didnt have the time right then to bake them). made them alot bigger than the recipe says to but the were, buttery (not greasy), flaky, and perfectly sweet yet not overpowering. I have made them twice so far and will make them again for sure. thanx for posting!

I had reservations about the 3 cups of oats and as it turned out I was right to have that concern.   This recipe is terribly dry and crumbly so I decided to add an extra half cup of nut butter which helped a little.   The dough it is very difficult to work with.  The taste and texture not worth the work.  The oats in the cookies are very dry but they are edible so I am giving it 2 stars.   My photo looks much better then they really are.  If you are going to try these I would recomend using half of the oats and add an additional 1/2 cup of nut butter.  I came back to give an extra star because the family is eating them up.  However be cognizant  that the recipe is off.

I've used this recipe probably six times now, with one alteration: chocolate chips.  Mostly the Tollhouse Minis.  They are a HUGE hit every time I make them!  I've made them for work, church groups, neighbors, and just to have for my kids.  All ages, men and women LOVE them!  My only other alteration is I cut the bake time by 2 minutes to keep them super soft.  Great recipe!

Wholesome and Delicious!  I have made these cookies several times and I bake A LOT of cookies!  They are a huge hit with everyone who tries them.  A few things I change, just due to preference:  I don't use shortening, I use butter... they are still tender and moist.  I use old fashioned oats and pulse them in the food processor and, because chocolate RULES, I always add semi-sweet chocolate chips.  For me, I also add raisins,  but some don't prefer them. I love the salty/sweet combination. Thank you for a delicious recipe! :)

I liked this recipe a lot.  Great peanut and oat flavors.  I used regular all purpose flour instead of whole wheat.

This is a great recipe! I used 1.5 cups of margarine instead of shortening, added an additional 1/4 cup of white sugar and a handful of dried cranberries. DELICIOUS!

Delicious. Even though mine lacked the vanilla extract they were still yummy and fluffy. First time I've had fluffy peanut butter cookies.
Next time I'll be putting in some dates or prunes, to add a little more sweetness.

This was an awesome recipe. I added 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 cup chocolate chips. Next time I'm going to add peanut butter chips. I used crunchy peanut butter the first time I tried it. I made mine into balls and they rounded out nicely. I sprinkled on cinnamon sugar after it was baked to give it a little "oomph" and it was a hit in my house!

Wow. i love this. i didn't have all the ingredients but used rolled oats, butter, brown sugar, the salt, and whole wheat flour with 2 eggs, whipped it all in one bowl, and baked at 375 degrees. Because I wanted to keep half of the batch, I selected to freeze a few cookies for later use (the following week and baked around 8 big luscious cookies). Thanks for the great recipe.

These are pretty good. I'm not a cookie maker, and we'll see how they store (I'm in the middle of baking them right now), but they're easy and my kids are all chowing down on the ones that are cooled. I made some plain an some with chocolate chunks. I'll definitely make them again, but add something else, because without the chocolate they're kind of blah.

Added a bag of chocolate chips and used butter instead of shortening and rolled oat instead of quick oats. I made them pretty large only 3 would fit on each cookie sheet. I flattened them out quite a bit but not completely flat. They took about 12-13 minutes to cook in my convection oven at 325 degrees. They were very good! Next time I will use crunchy peanut butter. I would also like to figure out how to make it more healthy maybe honey in place of some of the brown sugar and something inplace of the butter/shortening. Really good cookie!

This is a standard recipe I highly recommend. I feel that it is unfair to rate a recipe that I did not follow to the letter. But to unrate it brings the stars down and this is a wonderful recipe. Why I changed it? I ran short of oatmeal (like by half) and whole wheat flour. I also don't like shortening so much. I love chocolate chips. The beauty of this recipe, is that it is so basic that subbing a bit here and there does not jeopardize the outcome. I used half butter. I had to add flour to make up for the lack of oatmeal. The chocolate chips always work. Came out great.Its a  keeper.

Great peanut butter/oatmeal taste.  I substituted butter for the shortening.  I thought they were a tad salty, even for a peanut buttery cookie; so I would reduce the amount of salt to 1/2 tsp. in future batches, if using butter again!

These are delicious and easy. I used little extra flour being at 7000 feet. I will say that this made about 80 cookies, not the 36 it says it does!

I used 3/4 c butter & 3/4 c shortening, but otherwise kept the recipe the same.  I baked for 10 minutes, but I think it was a bit long for my oven, as they didn't come out quite as soft in the center as I would have liked.  Delicious flavor though!  Will definitely make again.

These are delicious! I used 1 and 1/2 sticks softened butter as I did not have shortening, and used white flour for the same reason. I couldn't stop eating them. Even the dough was delicious. I used a pampered chef baking stone and they came out perfect. I will be making this recipe many more times.

Enjoyed these cookies! After reading suggestions, I did use butter instead of shortening.  Also, made a batch with some additional goodies--added cinnamon, raisins, dried cranberries, walnuts, and chocholate chips making a sweet-nutty-chewy cookie!  Recipe is just as good with just peanut butter and oats.

These were pretty tasty but a little too sweet for me. I used 1c shortening and 1/2c vegan butter. I also used 1 egg and egg replacement for the other 2 eggs. I also threw in a dash of cinnamon. Next time I would use less sugar. (maybe start w/1 1/2c)

These cookies tasted great and had a great texture.  I've made a lot of peanut butter cookies over the years and some of them can be quite bland and boring.  These were moist, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  I didn't have any shortening so I just butter.

Absolutely delicious! I added some banana so I could reduce the amount of butter. I also added more cinnamon and chocolate chips.  Overall, this is a fantastic recipe.

I cut the recipe to 24 cookies as I thought this was too large a batch for us. Peanut flavour came through just fine.  This may have changed the consistancy somewhat. I thought they had great texture and flavour!  I also added raisans and then come chocolate chunks to the second round in the oven and got well over 3 dozen average size cookies.

They were pretty good, not really my style though. They were very textured and only slightly moist. Very salty peanut butter taste in mine, although i suppose it depends on your brand. It took about 11 minutes to cook right.

These were really good, and made a ton of cookies!  I actually made them gluten-free due to my own diet limitations (I used my own rice flour blend in place of the wheat flour, added 1 tsp of xanthan gum, and used gluten-free oats from Bob's Red Mill).  I like a little more peanut butter flavor personally so next time I would maybe add a little more peanut butter.  I also may try drizzling a little chocolate over the cookies as well.  All in all, these were great cookies, and stayed great even after I altered them to make them gluten-free (which is pretty high praise)!

I used 3 sticks of butter instead of the shortening and not as many oats (I just winged it because I was too lazy to measure it but I KNOW it wasn't 3 cups)...I used a bit more peanut butter and even added a large handful of chocolate chips.....I was suprised at how flat they came out but perhaps they are supposed to be like that?  Anyway, there's is something very wonderful about these cookies....since they are made with whole wheat flour maybe....they just taste wonderful and you know they are that much better for you.  My one year old is beggin for more that is for sure!

These aren't bad, but they are not that great either.  Very crumbly and I didn't know if adding an extra egg would help so tried that with the last 1/2 of the batch and it didn't do anything to help it!  Taste wise they weren't bad not peanut buttery enough for my husband but overall I thought they were OK taste wise for me, I just didn't like that they crumbled soo much!

I found this recipe too blah.  I did use white flour and perhaps that is the reason.  I knew it would take less than 12 minutes to bake in my oven and after trying it found 8 minutes to be about right.  Nice texture, nice looking, but a bit crumbly.
I would not make this particular recipe again, but maybe try another similar one.

I love this recipe! It is a great and healthy cookie to give to my family.  I just use a small ice cream scoop instead of rolling and flattening and they turn out fine.  I also add about a cup or so of dried cranberries for an extra flavor boost and vitamin boost!

The best part about this recipe is that it uses sheat flour.  I would recommend omitting most of the salt however.  Good cookie!

They had a good taste and remained good for a week (maybe longer - they were all gone then), but as another reviewer stated, very crumbly. I was looking for something chewier. FYI, I used white flour and added chocolate chips.

Made these for a coworker's birthday, and also sent some to my boyfriend.  They held up well over a couple of days and I really liked them.  I used extra crunchy peanut butter to give the cookies some peanut chunks.  Great stuff, thanks!

Mmmmmmmmm...very yummy. Divided the recipe by 3 and still made 15 cookies! Added a chopped small bar of white chocolate and kept the sugar amount the same and used wholenut peanut butter - just the right amount of sweetness. Didn't have any wheat flour so used self raising and omitted the baking soda. Made the cookies about 1cm high and hot they melt in the mouth and cold are both chewy and crunchy - perfect just someone please stop me from eating them all right now!!

I made these as written with the addition of 1/2 cup dry peanuts. They turned out wonderful. Lots of flavor, and a lot of cookies. Easy and fast. It took longer to bake than to mix. Thank you for sharing.

Probably the most dry, tasteless cookie I have ever had. I followed the directions exactly, and it made a lot of cookies that I will probably throw out. Don't even know how to adjust the recipe enough to make these better, so. I will be looking for a different peanut butter / oatmeal cookie recipe.

Very yummy! However, 10-12 minutes in my oven was way too long. Cut to 7 & they came out great. Also added 1/2 c sugar, like mine on the sweet side. Thxs 5 stars!!!

I had a cookie emergency -- needed cookies for 50 teenagers and few ingredients in the house -- and this recipe, with some changes, made me look like a hero!!!   I had only 1/2 cup of butter, but extra peanut butter made up for it.  I cut back the flour and added extra oatmeal.  Tossed in some cinnamon because I didn't have vanilla.  Then, because I could, I added raisins and white chocolate chips.  I made them  smaller, about 1 tsp each, and had about 100 cookies for the kids.  They were delighted.  I can't wait to try them following directions.

These Peanut Butter Oatmeal Cookies are the bomb!! I used real butter instead of shortening and all-purpose white flour in place of the whole wheat flour, only because  it is what was on hand.  I will be making these again for sure!

Can be made chewy or crispy depending on how long you bake them. I added peanuts for extra crunch.

These cookies are the best of two worlds, peanut butter, and oatmeal! I cut the recipe in half since there are only two of us to cook for and I also cut the sugar to 1 cup unpacked brown sugar. They are light and have a wonderful crisp bite.  Who knew whole wheat flour could be so good. I think these will be the cookies I make instead of one or the other of peanut butter or oatmeal cookies. Excellent recipe, thanks!

I followed the recipe closely, used honey roasted chunky peanut butter instead of smooth. They came out quite good, my husband liked them, which is saying alot, because he can be picky. I would have preferred them to be a little sweeter, but that is just me. I will make them again and maybe add some dried cranberries to half of the batch.

Iâ€™ve been using this recipe for 2 years.....it is excellent. I make big batches and freeze them. Whenever my kids feel like eating them, I just put some frozen cookies in the toaster oven for a few minutes and they taste fresh baked.

I use butter instead of shortening and sunflower seed butter instead of peanut butter.

I really liked these! They spread nicely and have a great texture. I used a 1/3 each of crisco, coconut oil and butter, which made them light and slightly crisp/slightly chewy.  I added some chocolate chips, which was a good call, as they are not very sweet. The recipe makes a lot of cookies!

After I had creamed the butter and sugar I realized I was short on oatmeal, so I added some Honey Bunches of Oats cereal, so I know this didn't come out like original recipe, but to us they didn't have enough peanut butter flavor.

Kids and I loved it! I read in one of the reviews that adding raisins was a good idea so the second time around I added the raisins in the egg vanilla mix and let it plump for an hour. I made the cookies but they all turned out really crumbly which was disappointing. I realised it was because the raisins soaked up egg so the dough fell short of egg. My suggestion, plump the raisins in water separately and then add it with the rest of the ingredients.

These are good! I used half butter half crisco and regular flour and they turned out fine. First batch I did regular recipie, but added a few more oats to the rest. No need to press with a fork either, these bad boys flattened out fine by them selves.

They are yummy! They don't taste like a typical peanut butter cookie though. They remind me of a nutritious breakfast cookie. I used non salted crunchy peanut butter, applesauce instead of shortening, half white flour (all I had) and half almond meal. They are soooo moist! My husband and I love them! In one batch I cut up bananas! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Great recipe.  I used butter instead of shortening when I make the standard cookies.  It also converts to vegan and GF very easily with flaxmeal/water instead of egg and coconut oil instead of shortening and GF flour.  I call it Peanut Butter Lover Oatmeal Cookies.  Add chocolate chips and you really feel the love!

This recipe is great!  Very simple and delicious.  I subbed some almond extract for half of the vanilla, used butter instead of shortening, and gluten free flour instead of wheat flour (I think this contributed to the fabulous finished texture).  These were the most tender, buttery, lightly sweet, melt-in-your-mouth cookies!  I will note that the peanut butter flavor is on the subtle side.  If you're looking for a peanut butter overload, this recipe might not be for you.

I used butter and white flour, and I did not press the cookies before baking. They still spread quite a bit. The flavor is very sweet, buttery. I would not call this a "moist" cookie, they really taste a lot like a traditional PB cookie just with the oatmeal texture added (as opposed to an oatmeal cookie with peanut butter flavor).

These cookies were sooo good! I am adding this recipe to my list of favorite cookies. I did modify the recipe though, and used 1 cup Butter Crisco, 1/2 cup butter, 3/4 cup creamy peanut butter,  3/4 cup extra crunchy peanut butter, added a 1/4 cup chopped honey roasted peanuts, used dark brown sugar, added 1 tablespoon vanilla extract, but I only used 2-3/4 cup of quick oats, and instead of whole wheat flour, I used all-purpose flour, and added 1/4 cup of Flax Seed. Dropped by tablespoons onto Pampered Chef Baking Stones, and baked the cookies for 13 minutes, and let the cookies set on the stoneware for 2 minutes, before removing them to a wire rack to cool completely. With this recipe, I found it made 76 cookies. These cookies are crisp and addicting! I like that I could add a bit of fiber to them by adding the Flax Seed. I added the cookies in a tin and placed them in the freezer, so I can enjoy them any time I want a cookie (or two). Next time I make these cookies, which will be soon, I'm going to add some miniature chocolate chips, to change up the recipe a bit. Thank you S. Hynek for posting this recipe. It's definitely a keeper!!!

These are super good! They spread out a little too much for my liking (this would probably be remedied by chilling the dough for an hour), but they still tasted great, and they were SO soft and chewy!

I also decided to add 1 cup of chocolate chips to the batter; my students went CRAZY! One even said, "This feels like Christmas morning!"

I like my cookies thick.  These cookies spread a lot.  I followed this recipe exactly and I bake a lot.  I was surprised that they spread as much as they did.  The recipe did not yield 36 cookies.  The only reason I am giving this a 1 is because the tasted okay.  I will be looking for a different recipe next time.

These were so good, and very easy! I helped my son make these for a Cub Scout badge. However, we didn't get 3 dozen like the recipe says... probably because the dough was so tasty we kept eating it!

This recipe is delicious! The first time I made these I  had to substitute egg beaters for the egg and they came out wonderfully. The second time I used a real egg, but decided to increase the brown sugar by a smidge b/c I was using all natural (Teddy brand) peanut butter and the dough wasn't sweet enough. This batch also came out extremely well. This is a great base PB cookie recipe that would do well with additions such as raisins, chocolate chips or nuts.

The cookies were good, but could have been sweeter.  They have a good texture.  I found that they did not taste that much like peanut butter.  I used white flour instead of wheat, and added about 1/3 cup of granola in addition to the cup of oats (I only made 12 servings).  I also used butter instead of shortening.  Overall, good cookies.

Love these!!! They are nice and chewy, which I really like. They are a little on the sweet side, but with a tall glass of milk they are great! Thanx so much for this recipe!

Sorry not my type of cookie, the kids really did not enjoy these. But they did come out light and crunchy melt you mouth texture.

I divided the recipe in thirds so I only made 1/3 recipe and they came out really fabulous! I used "peanuts only" natural peanut butter and did not even notice there was less sugar. The kids love them and they are good for them too.

The cookies were tasty (probably from all the shortening and sugar), very rich (I suggest a glass of milk with these) but they were also very crumbly, which was a downside.
