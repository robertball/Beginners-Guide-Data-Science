This is a great recipe for feeding a bunch of hungry visitors in the morning.  I do make some changes however.  I omit the potatoes & substitute a hashbrown crust on the bottom.  I also add broccoli & mushrooms & any other veggies on hand.  I did need to cook this for almost an hour & to finish it off I broiled it for a couple of minutes, but I also used more eggs.  Go crazy & experiment with additional ingredients!  Add some dill weed or fresh rosemary for added flavor.

Great one course meal! Few changes:Mix everything in skillet but when to add potatoes, I removed the mixture,saute the baked potato slices..then everything on top  [easier to remove from skillet] also used cheery tomatoes sliced in half). Please do brown for a few  minutes: makes a great presentation!...  with a saled served it at dinner! Received raves !!!

This was my first frittata and it was so pretty and easy to make, even the kids could do it!  Next time I am putting extra cheese on because I like it to be artery clogging, mmmn.

Oh!  Just a tip: I had to cook it a bit longer (30 minutes) maybe my oven is a bit dodgy?  Watch the middle of the pie to see if it's set.

Excellent! Great basic recipe suitable for wide substitution and variation. I didn't have ham, so I used cooked bacon; I didn't have red pepper, so I used green. I used a big iron skillet and the consistency was wonderful and the pie was easy to cut. I used 7 eggs and cooked it for 25 minutes. It was perfect!

Watching carbs, so substituted zucchini for the potato and didn't feel deprived.  This is a pretty basic omelet - nothing unusual here - but the sliced tomato, which I placed on the omelet just before baking rather than mixing it in, really dressed this up.  Lots of red and green going on, so this would be a nice choice for a festive Chriistmas breakfast.  Just salt and pepper is fine, but this would benefit from some seasoning to boost the flavor - I added fresh minced garlic  and fresh chives.  I made a half recipe and baked it in a shallow ceramic baker, about 30 minutes.

This is the BEST And Thank you for all your Suggestions 
Here are mine
I have a very picky Family that does not Like Onions and the Peppers OR the mushroom I know it is Silly!
So What I did I Cut the potatoes Like I was making Mash Potatoes it's Alot faster
and I justed Mixed everthing in a big bowl I used Minced Onions To still have the taste and I added Season Salt I Love it on potatoes and I put in bacon instead of ham about 1 lbs I know it is alot but thats what they like and added alot more Cheese bout 2 cups I thought it was to much but the Husband LOVE it!
And I dont have a Cast Iorn Pan So I used A pie pan and I had to bake or 45 min but I dont know if that is because I live in High Alitude 
Thank you for this recipe it will be a family favorte For ever!

I suspect there are a few other at-home chefs in the same boat as me: I don't own a cast iron skillet! I know - shame on me! I followed the recipe exactly, aside from adding a bit of garlic. Once I got to the point that everything was to go into the skillet and then into the oven, I put the veggie/potato/ham mix into a quiche dish, poured the eggs over that, sprinkled the cheese, and then stuck the whole thing in the oven at 375 for about 45 minutes. You'll know it's set if a knife inserted near the center comes out clean!

This was a great meal for dinner but I baked it in a pie shell to make it like a quiche.  It is definitely a "keeper" recipe.

Good recipe!  I also used a shallow glass baking dish.  Sauted onion and pepper as directed and tossed in the ham for a couple of minuted before combining all of it before baking.  It looks good and tasted garden fresh!  Thanks, Melinda

This recipe was EXCELLENT!! I didn't have a skillet so I put everything in a sqaure baking dish.  I wanted to feed more people so I did 10 eggs instead of 6.  I also used 3 small potatos, extra mushroom and bell pepper and added cooked bacon instead of the ham.  Every person loved this recipe and you can basically add anything you desire to the eggs.

Super - served two hungry men and myself for dinner with a tossed salad and toast.  One doesn't like tomato so I placed sliced tomatoes on one side only, and then topped with cheese and a sprinkle of paprika.  Very tasty and eye appealing.  Many thanks!!

My first Fritata and it is fantastic.  I  usually take all the same ingredients & make a non-baked version but this surpasses that.  I didn't have ham - not even breakfast sausage but used 2 hotdogs - hey - it's all I had in the way of meat.  just sliced them length wise & then sliced crosswise. I upped the ingredients by about 50%. I laid the tomotato slices on top without mixing in & put the cheese on top of that. I baked for about 22 min with 2 min under the broiler.  I have a bigger appetite then the small serving it was calling for .  I would say this serves 4-6 instead of 8.  It's too delicious to be giving small slices.  Of course not everyone has a big appetite.

Yum!  Doubled well in my 12" cast iron skillet.  Served 5, with enough leftovers for another breakfast.  No veggies, maybe I'll try to sneak in some red bell pepper next time.

"Really, really, really good.", my husband

"Best of the best." my son, 7 years old

"Awesome!" my son, 9 years old

My 7 year old even requested it for Christmas morning breakfast. I swear I didn't pay them to say any of that! I didn't have the bell pepper or the mushrooms so I replaced them with spinach. I also used red onion and didn't have quite enough tomato, but it didn't matter, it was still wonderful!

Updated - Made this for '08 Christmas morning and doubled the recipe. Used less of the onion and tomato and it worked out perfectly.

So happy to find this recipe. Wanted to make an omelet in my cast iron skillet. It is delicious as written. Served it at a casual brunch with 3 other recipes from this site. Got raves from my guests. Thanks so much.

Yummy and fairly quick meal!  Made this tonight to use up some ham from Christmas and changed a couple things to suit what was in my fridge.  Used 2 eggs with 6 whites and didn't cook my veggies in olive oil, just sprayed the pan.  I used a combination of zuch, red pepper and mushrooms.  I decided to dice my potatoes and didn't have a tomato.  Threw all into a deep dish pie plate and poured egg mixture over, then baked for about 35-40 mins...15 would have been way too undercooked, but mine had alot of stuff in it as I didn't measure!  Turned out great, love dishes like this one!

This recipe is really easy to substitute ingredients for!  I didn't have any parsley or tomatoes, added mushroom and onion, used sausage instead of ham, and used mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar, and this omelet turned out delicious!  Will use again.

I omitted the potatoes and saved 15 minutes of cooking time. Very quick and easy. I've never been able to make a good stove top omelet, so this is the way to go for me.

This was really good. My husband and I loved it. 2 of us ate the whole 8 servings. I did change a few things though. I baked the potato in the microwave then I peeled and chopped it. I browned the onion and pepper in margerine, added the mushrooms. In another bowl, I beat the eggs with a fork and mixed the ham, potato, and tomato slices. Mixed the whole mess together and baked it 30 minutes. We ate it with buttered toast. YUMMY!!!!!!!!!!!

This was so easy and a family hit!  Had ham left over from Christmas Eve and added in a little spinach...otherwise followed recipe exactly.  Placed slices on top for a colorful, festive look.

Most likely I did something wrong on this one, but I followed it and it didn't taste good to me.  I will try to make it again.  Thanks for the recipe.

I didn't bake this as recommended but cooked on the stove top and then popped it under the broiler to brown off the top.  Wonderful, will make again, thank you.

Great for our gluten free guest. Great flavor. Needed to bake so took a little longer than called for, but turned out great!

Entire family loved this dish; I did add 1 tsp of chili powder and some minced garlic for more flavor. It would be easy to make substitutions for the filling ingredients, depending on what was at hand.

Really good recipe. I've tried this one with ham and or sausage it's great with either but I fry the sausage first and cut up in small bite size pieces. I've made this with or without the mushrooms and tomatoes.

My family loved this one!  I had to leave out the red peppers because my son doesn't like them, so put in more onions and mushrooms to compensate.  Also made a cheddar/monteray jack cheese mixture for the top.  Primo!

I thought this recipe was excellent!  It can be a bit time consuming chopping up everything, but well worth it.  It was even better the second day!  I forgot to add the chopped parsley and it was still very tasty.  I will definitely make this one again!!

I have Crohns disease, and this dish was easy on my stomach and easy to make. Im also on a no wheat and no dairy diet, so I only put cheese on the half for my family and it was still great.

Really good. Enough for 5 adults (seconds, too).  Next time I will cook it for at least 45 minutes.  I used basil instead of parsley & added brocolli like someone else suggested.

I needed a dairy free option for a brunch guest with health concerns so I made this leaving off the cheese. This was one of the few baked egg dishes that didn't call for milk. It was good but it took forever to cook and I had to finish it off in the microwave since everything else was done.

I do not care for eggs, even though I'm pretty great at cooking them, so this rating is based on my father's appraisal. The ingredients sounded fantastic, though, and after asking him what he would have added - he couldn't think of anything to say. Great recipe!

This was nice for a weeknight dinner with a salad, or for brunch on Sunday.  My husband and I ate the whole thing (I used 4 eggs only, cause that's all I had).  I would definitely make this again.

Good.  Be sure to cut the potatoes super small so the pie isn't so starchy.  We did ricotta cheese to give it more richness.  We mixed in the ricotta with the eggs as one mixture.

I loved this. I didn't make it exactly to recipe because was missing some items. I made mine with turkey sausage, orange bell pepper, garlic, potato, cheddar and mozzarella. I needed something to make on the fly. Quick and easy. Served it with side of black beans. BIG hit in my book :)

Great recipe and easy to adapt to your own mix of ingredients.  I usually add vegetables and garlic in the sauté too along with some rosemary and extra cheese, and often cut the meat, for a great meal any time of day.  I have to cook it significantly longer than the directions - even with 6 eggs, 45 minutes is not unusual to get the inside semi-firm.

Made this for the family and they loved it, I did make some additions and subtractions to the ingredients to suit us but all in all very pleased with the results!  I added sausage and bacon, 3 more eggs, some Rotel and a bit of garlic powder.  I also added a bit of cream to the egg mixture and it came out more moist than when I made it without.

Made this for a "Men's Breakfast."  My husband requested bacon, so I substituted it for the ham.  I only had green peppers, but I think equally good.  I also increased the egg count to 8, and baked it a few extra minutes (probably about 20 total).  I didn't get to test it myself, because there were no leftovers.  Good indication it was a hit. My husband did say it was good.

fantastic! I subbed zucchini for the potatoes, and made mine with all veggies (spinach, onion, bell peppers, halved grape tomatoes). I had so many veggies, I ended up needing 8 eggs (I also added a splash of milk as I wisked the eggs). the cast iron skillet in oven method was perfect! I let each person add cheese as needed rather than add to whole recipe.

Very good frittata. I followed the recipe pretty closely except didn't have any parsley and used more vegetables, maybe double the peppers and mushrooms and more cheese too!  The potato could have boiled a few minutes longer than 15 mins but was pretty big so will depend on how big yours is.  This will definitely be my go to recipe for frittatas from now on.

I've made this according to the basic and it turned out great.  Now I'm experimenting because I had an overabundance of fresh eggs, so I doubled the recipe, and it's in the oven as we speak.  I lowered the oven temp to 325 due to the large volume.  Wish me luck !!

Easy to do and you can use whatever veggies you want, leave out meat, etc. Made it for brunch this morning and everyone loved it. Great recipe!

This was a terrific and very easy recipe.  A big hit with family and friends.  Only change I made was to put everything in a baking dish and straight into the oven (as suggested by some of the reviewers).  Thanks for recipe, I will be making again and again!

Delicious and healthy!  Can omit ham to make it vegetarian.  I've also tried adding cooked asparagus or zucchini and both were good.  It keeps well in refrigerator and slices can be reheated in a microwave.
