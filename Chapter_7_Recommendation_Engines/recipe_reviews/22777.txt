I love these cookies!  I make them every year.  I am not wild about nuts so I use a cup of mini chocolate chips.  I used a tablespoon sized cookie scoop and had about 72 cookies.  I don't know if it was the combination of my oven and the fact that I use parchment paper but I have to bake them for 16 1/2 minutes.  They are soft cake-like cookies that are soooo addictive!!  UPDATE 12/14/10 - I usually use orange extract instead of grated orange peel.  I increase the orange flavor by using 1/2 teaspoon of the extract in the dough.  I also use 1/4 tsp of orange extract in the glaze.  Make sure to sift your powdered sugar.  It does help the glaze not be as runny.  I like to keep them in the refrigerator.  They also freeze quite well! I think next time I make these, I will try diced dried cranberries instead of the chocolate chips!

Add some vanilla and more sugar and they are great.  I made them without the orange because I am not really an orange fan, and they still came out great.  They are light and fluffy, kind of muffin like in the middle.  Very yummy!

These cookies turned out good, but I changed the recipe a little.  In the cookie and the icing, instead of orange juice and peel, I used maple pancake syrup.  I used raisins instead of nuts.  And added a little cinnamon.

I made this recipe for a recent cookie exchange, where I had to bring 7 dozen cookies.  I doubled the recipe and in no time I had delicious cookies and.. I was voted #1 in all 3 competitions (tase, look and unique)!  I've added this recipe to my favorites!
