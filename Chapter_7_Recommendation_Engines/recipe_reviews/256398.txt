I didnt do the water bath stuff. I just microwaved the cream cheese/milk mixture instead & baked the thing normally. I didn't do the "let sit in oven ajar for an hour" thing either. & it turned out PERFECTLY! I hate the texture of traditional cheesecake so this sounded like a great way to try it with a texture I could handle & I'm glad I did because it is delicious. Next time I will top it with whipped cream & strawberries.

I should have realised from the title that this cake is not going to end up like Japanese cheesecake. It should not be 'spongy'. My cake ended up being way overdone and I think that last step (leaving in oven with door open) is the reason why. I looked back to my tried and true Japanese cheesecake recipe (Cotton Soft Japanese Cheesecake from Diana's Desserts) and realised that this is more or less the same recipe, only Diana's does not say to leave it in the oven after cooking! Sigh, I am not straying from Diana's perfect recipe again. Sorry, I really wanted to like this recipe.

Made it exactly as the recipe said. Hate it when people change the recipe and then say it's terrible.  I liked it immensely. My only complaint is, it was a little underdone. Could just be my oven or incorrect water bath. Had never cooked anything in a water bath, so it could be me doing something stupid.  I fed some to my neighbor and he went home and made one. Good stuff and I will make it again. Thanks for posting this.

Tastes really eggy. Would be better with maybe some strawberry whipped cream. I microwaved the cream cheese and it did turn out spongy.

I followed the recipe and it worked out great.  I will be making it again as it is a great dessert that is not too sweet.

Good, but the texture was a touch rubbery.  However, it did balance well against whipped cream and berry syrup.

The cake was so high and full but flattened while cooling.   The only modification made was adding a little vanilla.   While it is hard to call it a true cheesecake, the cake is unique. and got rave reviews.  It had a dense angel food cake texture.   It is not overly sweet, mild cheese-not eggy flavor, and is perfect with a fruit topping.

This is definitely more like a sponge cake than a cheesecake, but it was still yummy.  I made it exactly. Would be great with strawberry compote or any other fruit to complement. Light and fluffy!

I feel the 1hr 10mins is little too long. 1st 35mins set at 165 degree, last 20 mins at 150degree. The TOP little brown n texture was perfect.

This is an absolutely perfect recipe. And I'm even at high altitude!! I was immediately attracted to the recipe based on this bain-marie method, which is exactly how a souffle cheesecake is supposed to be made. The egg whites are incorporated into the cake mixture and yields a perfectly baked japanese souffle cheesecake. It tastes very very close to what we have in Japan, and what we pick up at the Japanese market in Denver. Bravo!
