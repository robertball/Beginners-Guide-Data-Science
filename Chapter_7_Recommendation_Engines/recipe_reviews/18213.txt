Three stars if prepared as written - 30 minutes at 350 degrees is neither long enough nor hot enough to cook the potatoes let alone brown them.  Raise the temperature to 450, however, and you'll have nicely browned potatoes with somewhat crispy edges and a creamy interior.  I turned the potatoes 15 minutes into cooking time, then turned them and roasted them for an additional 10 minutes. Great eye appeal, and they taste as good as they look. Easily five stars just by raising the oven temperature.

These are GREAT potatoes...I added salt, pepper, garlic, and cajun seasoning to the rosemary/oil base...I sliced my potatoes instead of quartering(to speed up the cooking process...and make more crunchy area) and they were GREAT!!  These are some of the best potatoes I have had.

These potatoes were a little bland for my taste.  I adore rosemary, but I felt that they were somehow lacking.  Oh, here's a tip for the seasoning: take a zippered plastic bag and throw the potatoes inside after cutting and then pour the oil-rosemary mixture in as well.  Close and shake.  One less bowl to wash!

This recipe is a favorite at my house except i cut smaller pieces and shake them in a zip-loc bag to coat them. After the 30 min I top them with fresh grated parmesan cheese and put them in for 5 more min they are amazing.

I would suggest much smaller pieces or else the potatoes have to dry out to cook through. Easy to make and the flavor was good (make sure you like rosemary)!

You know, they serve these potatoes everywhere in Italy. They are all crispy on the outside, creamy in the middle, and flavored with olive oil and rosemary.

Excellent!  I used red potatoes and added a little garlic to the oil.  Also, I used the broiler on the oven for a few minutes at the end of baking to make the potatoes crispier.

The potatoes were not cooked properly after 30 minutes, it took an extra 10 minutes, and they still were not browned.  Instead of Yukon gold potatoes, we used the baby red potatoes which were even smaller and should have taken less time to cook.
I don't think I would make this recipe again.

This dish sure tastes good. I had to cook longer than thirty minutes and I switched the rosemary for basil. It is a dish I will serve again.

Overall these are pretty good, but I found I had to slice them thinner in order to get them fully cooked in the 30min at 350. Also next time I will cut back on the rosemary a bit as it was slightly overpowering.

Although they took longer to cook than the recipe indicated, once done, the potatoes were crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside. Very good.

these were really great.  I used russet potatoes since that is what I had and cut them about 1/4 to half inch cubes.  My son loved them so much.

We enjoyed them.  Used a higher temperature, 200 degrees C.  Cooked in about 40 minutes.  Let them brown a little, sprinkle a little bit of salt on top at the end.

I had a bunch of fingerling potatoes that I needed to use.  I cut them into 1/2" to 3/4" pieces, baked them at 450 degrees F for 30 minutes (covered with aluminum foil).  They turned out perfectly done!  Not one potato was undercooked.  This recipe does have quite a bit of oil.  The potatoes did not stick to the pan at all, which was nice.  I might add a tablespoon less next time but then again these were perfect so I might not.  I also used 1 1/2 tsp rosemary, 1 1/2 tsp basil, 1 tsp salt and no pepper.  The seasonings were great!

I cut the potatoes into smaller pieces (had some big Yukons), but they still took longer than 30 minutes at 350.  I thought the flavor was a little bland, but not bad.

I make these all the time. Suggestions: If you break the potatoes up by hand and leave some jagged edges, they break off while roasting and get all crispy and fantastic. Also...I'd crank the oven up to 425 or 450 for the last 10 minutes or so if you like crispy potatoes (crispy on the outside). Play around with seasonings...almost anything works on roasted potatoes.

don't think they tasted as good as other recipes on this site. Perhaps, I like a little more spice. Shall try them again though.

I have tried this recipe (does take longer - try 45 minutes to l hr depending on your oven) and have used red potatoes instead.  My husband, who does not usually like any potatoes except mashed, raves about this recipe! I use fresh rosemary which I can still get from my garden.  Delicious!

Very tasty.  I diced the potatoes in my food processor and it still turned out.

I made this dish this past weekend and good grief did my husband like them! I did omit the rosemary as I discovered while making this I was out of that herb. I hurriedly sprinkle the potatoes with garlic powder and paprika. They cooked up really well and the flavor was really good. When asked if I should make them again, my husband emphatically replied, "Oh, yes!"

This was ok. I suggest adding more spices to really help it out. And I also had to cook them longer than stated in order for them to be done. I added garlic and a little extra salt after baking to help bring out flavor

Awesome.  This is something I can bring to a potluck.  A GUARANTEED hit. Yum.  I did put the rosemary into and through an empty pepper grinder in order to make it less stick like.

Switched it up since I was out of Rosemary. I used Italian seasoning, sea salt, a little black pepper, and sprinkled with Parmesan cheese.

Added garlic to the recipe along with the dried rosemary. Used red potatoes and it turned out perfect. Had to put the oven on 375 and left the potatoes in for about 40 minutes. They were amazing.

A lovely easy way to make potatoes. I had some leftover gold potatoes and needed a side dish so I tried this recipe. I followed the advice of reviewers and cut the potatoes in 1/8 s and added a little garlic powder for taste and cooked them at 375 for about 40 minutes and they came out perfectly. They definitely require a little extra cooking time then the recipe calls for but all in all this recipe really gave me a great starting point and was very easy to make. Thanks!!

These turned out pretty good but took about 25 minutes longer to cook than listed, and I even turned the over up to 400 for the last 10 minutes. They also were a bit too oily, so if I were to make them again I would scale back on the olive oil.

We must have the same Momma, 'cause mine makes these, too! :o)   This is a staple in my family. The only thing we add are additional herbs (any Italian, fresh or dried, will do) and garlic. They go great with everything.

I made this exactly as written, using part of the first bag of Yukon Gold potatoes I think I've ever bought. With the given time and temperature, the potatoes were only very slightly crispy on the outside, and a tiny bit underdone inside, so more time or temperature would be useful if (when) I make these again. Also, I thought there was maybe too much olive oil here, as a lot was left on the baking sheet I used. On the plus side, I don't know much about rosemary, and I thought a tablespoon of it might be too much, but in the end the amount was just right, and the simple taste of the potatoes with rosemary was great.

These were great. My family really liked them. I only had rosemary leaves, so I ground it in a coffee grinder to a powder. Worked much better.

It's so good!! I used parsley instead of rosemary, though, because I didn't have rosemary. But it's really good anyway.

Turned out nice, but a little too oily. I would toss the potatoes with oil and seasonings first, then put them on the pan.

I was looking for something to do with redskins rather than always boiling them, and this fit the bill.  After reading previous reviews, I added more flavor by mixing in chopped garlic and extra salt with the oil.  Tasty.

I made this recipe with a Tri-tip roast and asparagus. It was easy to make and we liked the rosemary and olive oil flavors mixed. Was looking for recipe that would be easy to make while traveling in trailer and this will be going with me on my trips. Very easy and good!

Passable with some more spices.
