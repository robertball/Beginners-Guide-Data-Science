very good! I only used half a head of cabbage & kept the other ingredients the same, It turns out more creamy that way! I also carmelized a small chopped onion & added it to the mix. Lastly, I transfered it to a baking dish, topped with panko bread crumbs and baked @350 for about 10 min.

This was really, really good!  It's the middle of summer and cabbage is chep but hubby doesn't like coleslaw and corned beef and cabbage doesn't seem right in July so I tried this recipe and between 2 adults, 1 teen and 2 toddlers we polished off the whole big bowl!  Now I did add an extra strip of bacon cause c'mon, it's bacon!  but aside from that I followed the recipe exactly and sooo good, everyone loved it!

Loved this dish. I live on my own and in the Netherlands where we grow a lot of cabbage. This dish was a great one pot dish with plenty of leftovers to play with. I didnt use bacon but used finely diced ham instead, adding a little oil to replace the loss of bacon fat. Heated some up the next day for lunch and threw in a handfull of leftover rice. Yummy!!

My family loved this recipe, even my 6yr old who doesnt like to eat his veggies. I didnt have any sour cream so I substituted with 1 cup of evaporated milk mixed with 1 tbsp vinegar. Came out perfect!

This is, without doubt, the best cooked cabbage recipe I've ever tried.  I made it exactly as written.  The few leftovers went into some home fries the next morning and we loved it!

Yummy!  I put in a little extra bacon (because you can never have enough bacon) and used it to fill a pita.  Made a great little pita sandwich.

This is an excellent recipe that I really enjoyed. However, a little tip, take the cabbage off the heat and let it cool slightly before adding the sour cream or the sour cream may curdle a little if the pan is too hot. Otherwise very tasty.

This recipe just isn't good. I used fresh cabbage from my garden, and followed the recipe exactly. The leaves are so greasy that the cream sauce isn't even sticking to them. The flavor isn't that great, either. I prefer Beth's Scalloped Cabbage.

Cooked as written, used 1 lb bag of shredded cabbage.  First bite was kind of weird because I didn't know what to expect.  Then I couldn't stop shoveling it in, really good

I looked at this recipe for a few days before I finally decided to try it. I was so sure I wouldn't like it with of all the fat but I was so wrong! It was so good and very easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly and decided as long as I save it for special occasions I should be okay. This is a keeper!

Smooth and creamy with just the slightest bit of tang from the sour cream. I really enjoyed this, but then I guess you have to like cabbage in the first place to like this because it didn't make a convert out of Hubs. If it wasn't for him and his durned pickiness I wouldn't hesitate to make this again.  Pan browned brats and AR's Garlic Dill New Potatoes completed the meal.

Quick and Easy!  That's the most important thing about this recipe. My wife likes just a little more sauce so like some of the other folks here I added a little milk (1/4 - 1/2 cup) to the white sauce.  And again like others I used only a half a head of cabbage to keep it as creamy as possible. Prefect side dish when you're trying to maintain a good table for a high fiber yet low meat content menu.

This is like my ideal recipe. Its SO tasty. And I don't even really like cabbage. Ingredients I already have lying around. Few ingredients. Not very time-consuming. Possibly not that healthy though... ;)

This cabbage dish was AWESOME! I wish I could give it more than 5 stars. It was my favorite part of last nights St. Patrick's Day dinner (and I loved everything!). Thank you for sharing it. I did the same thing someone else did - only use half a head of cabbage and keep all the other ingredient measurements the same. I may try it next time with a whole head just to compare but it came out wonderful as it was. I can't wait to bring it to my next potluck or family gathering!

Good but one suggestion - The sour cream curdles so turn off the heat before stirring in the sour cream - Otherwise ... very good

I love this!!! I've made this many times and the only thing I've changed..for my own personal tastes after the initial 2 times following exactly, is I add smoked sweet paprika and smoked sea salt at the very end of the cooking time...and I sprinkle some of the paprika on top..makes a nice presentation...thanks for a keeper of a recipe!!

Made as side dish for Christmas and was a big, big hit.  Added touch more sour cream to empty out the container, then once assembled I put into oven at 350 for about 30 minutes because I thought it might be better that way plus I needed to keep it warm.  My husband finished off leftovers that night and was looking for more.  Will become a staple in our house.  EXCELLENT!!!

Wow! Yum!! My 5 yr old gave it a 16/10! I think I agree. Next time I will try to make it a "tad" healthier by cutting back some butter and using plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. 
Defiantly a keeper!

Only did a half a head of cabbage because that is what I had and it was so delicious. I also added a rainbow carrot to the mix during the pan frying and it added some nice flavorful crunch. This made cabbage a new favorite.

If you like bacon, you will probably like this dish regardless of how you feel about cabbage.  I love red cabbage, but I am not very fond of cooked green cabbage.  I really like this dish and could probably eat it all day.  The only change I made was to substitute plain greek yogurt for the sour cream because I didn't have any sour cream on hand.  This is one I will definitely make again.

Love this! What a surprise! My CSA loaded me down with a huge cabbage at the beginning of November. There are just two of us & my husband only likes coleslaw, which isn't my idea of a cold weather dish! This creamed cabbage turned out so good I almost ate half as soon as it was cooked. I didn't have any sour cream on hand so I just used a little half & half with a drop of vinegar. I think it would've been just fine without it, too. Yummmee! I feel compelled to comment on Michael Jackson's negative critique. although he says he followed the recipe exactly, I suspect he didn't give the flour enough time to absorb the grease & cook. My cabbage was anything BUT GREASY,

I wanted something different for a large family dinner over the holidays, so this was a good use of the almost whole head of cabbage that had been purchased for a stir fry.  I did add some whole milk since I was looking for more sauce.  Cabbage is not that populer, but several people liked it, including a couple requests for the recipe.

This was really good and addicting.  Added some red pepper that I had frozen and garlic and onions.  Used bacon grease I had in the fridge and cooked ham instead of bacon.  Will definitely make again and again.

Seriously, heaven in a bowl. I did throw in one small sliced sweet onion and a mess of minced garlic. It's not diet food but once and a while, it's just WONDERFUL to indulge. This would be over the top slopped over a bowl of mashed potatoes. Kind of like a white-trash colcannon. NOTE: I did not add the full amount of salt. Just a pinch. I also added fresh ground pepper.

Excellent recipe.  I tasted when done and needed something so added a couple sprinkles of Cayenne pepper.  Also added some onion and garlic.  Next time I may cook about a half cup of egg noodles and add to it.  Am sharing recipe with all my children as I know they will like it too.

The whole family enjoyed this easy and delicious recipe. My shortcut was to use pre-cooked bacon bits (from Costco) sautéed with some butter. Everything else was as written.  Just be sure not to over-cook the cabbage.

We wanted something different for our cabbage dish on new year's day. I chose this one because it sounded interesting, easy to make and I had all the ingredients. I am so happy I did! This dish was a huge hit on my dinner table. For the first time ever, I had no leftover cabbage!  I made it exactly as the recipe reads. I cant think of anything I could do to improve it. This is a keeper. Try it!

Ok, even my 13 yr old boy couldn't get enough of this!  Super good.  Here is a tip:  use the precooked bagged bacon if you are short on time.  Tastes great.

SCRUMPTIOUS! I got cabbage for ten cents a pound today, so it's Cabbage Week. This recipe is SO GOOD that I wouldn't mind eating it for dinner tomorrow too! Didn't have bacon on hand so used sausage. I also put in a sprinkle of dill seed. How can such a humble veggie be so delicious? I made a huge stockpot full and between two people (and one lunch reserved for tomorrow) it is gone! I like reviewer allisony's comment: "Proves anything is good when coated in three kinds of fat ;)" Ha! Bonus: is guilt-free, because...........it's cabbage! Thank you, jessann5!

This is my favorite creamed cabbage recipe I've ever tried. To lower the fat a bit, just substitute the sour cream with plain greek yogurt and a good brand of turkey bacon. This is a tasty, tasty recipe!

Amazing and slightly healthier! I had already made bacon on the weekend so I didn't have the drippings to cook with as well I am eating healthier so I changed it slightly. I added 1/3 cup water, only cut up 1/2 the head of cabbage with all the rest of the same ingredients as well as a tablespoon of vinegar. My whole family loved it and they wanted more. I would make this again in a heart beat.

Yum!  This is delicious!  I too pre-steamed my cabbage because I like it cooked a little longer but other than that, no changes.

Very good. I used chopped ham instead of the bacon and this was delicious. We served over mashed potatoes. I'll make this one again.

Five stars from Hubs on this one, but only 3 stars from me.  I made half this recipe, but used the entire 1/2 cup of sour cream.  It looked like it needed it.  I’m not sure what the purpose of the flour was.  It seemed to sort of stick to the bottom of the pan while I was cooking the cabbage.  Once cooked, I transferred this to a small casserole, let it cool and then covered and refrigerated it until dinner.  I topped the cabbage with some buttered panko and baked it uncovered at 350 for about 20-25 minutes.

This was very good, and I got a lot of compliments on it. Everyone really liked it. It's not "health food" though. While it's good, it's also very, very rich. One reviewer commented that s/he halved the cabbage, which I can't imagine. I actually doubled the cabbage. So, it's very, very tasty. Make and enjoy as long as you're not too concerned about your waistline.

i liked this cabbage but i think it needed more salt of course and i added onion powder, garlic powder, a lil accent and pepper. I used seasoned salt instead of regular salt and i love it. Without the extra salt and other seasonings that i put i dont think it would of tasted the same. Oh and last i cut up a white onion very thin and cooked with cabbage.

Never had creamed cabbage.  Was looking for a recipe as I did not want to throw away my fresh head of cabbage.  Recipe was easy and delish.  I added a few tablespoons on cream cheese to add more richness to the recipe as well as salt to taste.  Very comforting, filling side dish.

This was wonderful, even if it's not St. Pat's day.  Very easy as well.  I would skip making the roux, as it does not add much to the finished product. Used homemade smoked pork belly from our good friend in place of the bacon.

Will definitely make this again.  I used gluten free flour with no problem.  For personal preference, I sauteed onion with the cabbage and pepper with the flour and salt, and I wouldn't change a thing.  So easy, quick, and yummy!

easy enough to make with processor. Jazzed it up with an onion, some sausage and rather than sour cream, chipotle ranch dressing. yum!

OMG! I want this everyday! It is so good. I did like some said and only used half a head of cabbage so I could have more sauce. Amazing! Will be making this a staple in my dinner rotation.

I made this last night and my husband and I both really liked it. I only gave 4 stars because I did not totally follow directions... I used 1/2 a head of cabbage and made all the sauce. I added the sour cream off heat after a short rest as suggested by another reviewer. I also used 6 pieces of bacon because I'm a rebel :)

Absolutely delicious. My husband is avoiding carbs so I left out the flour and used heavy cream instead. The sour cream really makes the dish.

KETO VERSION: omit the flour. I used leftover bacon fat because I was out of bacon so I fried up some chopped salami, after I had halfway sautéed cabbage... at the end I stirred in about quarter cup or so of sour cream and it’s pretty darn good ALSO sprinkled on some garlic salt and pepper for flavour

Delicious; substituted plain yogurt for the sour cream and used Wegmans basting oil and hormel real bacon bits instead of frying bacon and using drippings.  Added onion and garlic.

This was very easy and a hit for my potluck.  Several persons recalled their parents making this to extend the meal.  I did add cayenne to my dish to give it the zing I like but it stands alone well.  Have made it twice now this week and next time I will try baking it uncovered after par-cooking to give it a crust and different texture.

This is amazing! I did not add the flour (I don't think it adds anything), and added a bit of garlic - winning combo! This is my new favorite way to eat cabbage.

Very nice. Think it could have used just a bit of something like pepper to give it just a little kick. Certainly using a whole head of cabbage made A LOT of the dish. I will cut in half next time. My first four slices of bacon didn't produce as much grease as I think I was expecting so I browned 4 more slices but only used 1/8c margarine to help compensate for more bacon grease.

Terrific and easy variation on cabbage.  We enjoyed it chilled the next day even more than day of and warm.  I might add some red pepper next time.

Made it and enjoyed it! I was out of sour cream so I used the same amount of cream cheese instead of the sour cream. I also put a quarter cup of plain Greek yogurt. I didn't use flour because the cream cheese made it thick enough as it was. Turned out great!

Excellent flavor with minimum work.  My skillet wasn't deep enough so I didn't use all of the cabbage I'd planned.  This recipe was a bit rich for my blood.  When  I make it next, I will experiment with less butter, less salt and just a bit of the bacon drippings for flavor.  Thanks!

This is excellent as written. I've made it a couple more times adding what ever is on hand. If you have diced ham instead of bacon, don't worry, it's still great (just add some type of oil, maybe 1tbsp ). I've also shredded carrots into the mix, minced garlic, beef or chicken stock (or cubes). Good with coconut oil instead of bacon fat, try also with Sriracha, cayenne, and a dash of Tabasco for some kick. Mushrooms are good in it, diced potatoes, parsnips, turnip (may need to be steamed a few minutes). Again, don't go crazy and add all these extra ingredients, but it's a solid and versatile recipe that I'll continue to experiment with lol!
Edit: I've never added flour to it either, turns out fine.

Sooooo good!  Yummy to the  max.  Only thing I did different was to add onion powder.  Will be making it again and again.

This recipe was very good. Next time I will use only a 1/2 head of cabbage so that it all will get coated. The bacon added a delightful crunch. My husband was very pleased!

I used a package of bacon cooked this and half cup of Tasso. I then took an onion and cook the onion and the bacon fat. Didn't use all the bacon just the bacon fat. Then I followed the rest of the recipe and used a whole head of cabbage and a cup of light  sour cream. Someone else had recommended putting breadcrumbs on top and I did this but I think it's better to mix it with a little butter and toast it and then put it on top rather than put it in the oven because my bread crumbs never toasted. I ended up just mixing it in and it tasted great but if you wanted that breadcrumb topping look then make sure you mix it with some better something. It's not a healthy recipe at all but it taste great

Certainly didn't look like the picture, and after modifying with more bacon, and more sour cream, I stiff wasn't impressed. I liked another cabbage recipe with ground beef and tomato sauce.

Never used sour cream in a hot cabbage dish, was a nice difference. No bacon but found about a third of a good hard salami stick,  I made salami crisps in place of the bacon. Also added a few tablespoons of chopped red onion, a dash of garlic salt, and about 2 cups of roasted baby yellow potatoes....hard to get the rest of the family to eat cabbage.

OMG!!! This was soooooo good and very easy to make.  I had never heard of creamed cabbage before and was a little leery after reading the ingredients, but I had a small head of cabbage in the fridge and needed a different and quick recipe.  This was a gold mine find!!!  My husband couldn't get enough of this.  I didn't change a thing in the recipe, but may add a slice or two more bacon next time just because I LOVE BACON!!!!  Thanks for this recipe.

Very good, followed it as is except only used half a cabbage. 
Also! I had a little left over the next day nd didn't want to eat it by itself, so I cut some precooked potatos (previously baked potato from the day before ) and added sum green beens in it and jus through it in the microwave and it was so good!

I made it the way it was written except I added more bacon and I didn't  cook the cabbage for 15 minutes. 15 minutes would have made it mushy. I followed the advice of someone else and let it cool before adding the sour cream. It was very good!! We had a small piece of steak with it and we enjoyed it very much. We used high quality bacon and that's  the key to not having it too greasy. Will definitely make again.

Delicious. My whole family (husband, 23 year old son and 17 year old daughter)enjoyed it.  It was tasty.  I cooked it exactly as the instructions indicated. I'm not sure what the problem was for the reviewer that didn't like it and said the sauce didn't stick to the cabbage.  I didn't have that problem.  I will be making this again.

This really is a five star concoction! I had 1/2 of a sweet onion that I needed to use so I did add an ingredient but I don't think it changed the overall recipe that much... I was a little skeptical about the sour cream but, WOW! that really added to the overall taste and made it extra special.. Thanks Jessica for a great way to fix cabbage!

Delicious and definitely creamy.  Disagree with the timings - this is a 10 minute job including the prep. Had no sour cream so used double cream and lemon juice.  Plenty of butter, plenty of seasoning.  Added cream to the consistency I liked and added a handful of parmesan to finish which was delicious.

I only used half a head of cabbage and added a small apple for a touch of sweetness. The rest I left the same and it came out awesome.I will definitely make this again. The family loved it and I did as well.I added a little bit extra bacon too.

This recipe was good, not great.  Personally, I think I would have liked it better just sauteed in the butter with the bacon flavor minus the sour cream.  I know that wouldn't be creamed cabbage, but it's just hard to beat cabbage fixed that way!

Yummy and easy to make! Used reduced fat sour cream instead of regular and nobody could tell the difference. Made it for a cook-out and everybody raved about. Tasted even better the next day!

Made this for the first time last night and it was very yummy, but as a side note for next time I will probably prepare the cabbage in some olive oil rather than in the grease from the bacon.. The cabbage came out a little dark and didnt look as appetizing as I was hoping although it tasted great!  Looking forward to trying it again and perfecting the recipe to my liking! Thanks for the great start!

Made this just as the recipe suggests.  It was soooooo good!  My husband and our friend that was over for dinner loved it too.  I've already put this one in my box of keepers!
