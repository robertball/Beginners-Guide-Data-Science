These were so good!  I did make a few changes, though: I omitted the milk powder, added a cup of oatmeal and 1/4 cup of brown sugar, and used 1/4 cup margarine and 1/4 cup applesauce.  I used wheat germ instead of wheat bran.  And I used egg replacer instead of an egg.  They are excellent, quite soft, and just the right amount of sweet.  Actually, the next time I make them I think I'll leave out the brown sugar because I think they would be sweet enough without it.  I would love to try them with some dried cherries and golden raisins, too!

My son loves these. I let him eat these for breakfast. My dad loves these. (He's diabetic). My friend who loves peanut butter loves these and asked for the recipe right away! I did add 1/2 c. oatmeal for the consistency and 1 banana for the yum factor. You cannot tell they're sugar free. You can't even really tell they're health-nut cookies b/c of the strong peanut butter taste/smell.

I can't eat just one! I subbed unsweetened applesauce for half of the butter, used chunky PB, and threw in a couple dashes of ground ginger. Outstanding!

Thanks so much for this recipe.  I'm always looking for healthy cookie recipes for my 16 month old son.  I added one very ripe banana and 1/4 to 1/2 cup oatmeal.  I also substituted wheat germ for the bran.  Very yummy.  I made them for my boy, but I ended up eating them too!!

I've made these twice. Once with the milk powder and once without. These are definitely tastier when the milk powder is used.

I think these are a very good, not-too-sweet cookie.  I am trying new recipes to give to my toddler instead of the processed foods, and this was a favorite.  I did make half a batch as directed, and then added 1/2 cup of brown sugar, and that made an incredible difference.  Yum.

I loved these cookies! Per other suggestions, I used applesauce instead of butter but won't do that again since the batter was too runny & the cookies were too soft. I'll probably use 1/4 cup applesauce & 1/4 cup butter instead or just all butter. I used wheat germ instead of wheat bran & added 1 banana to the batter & THAT made all the difference! I got a sweet, soft cookie with plenty of whole grains in it & because of natural sweetness of the banana. Next time I might try adding a few mini choc chips. Thanks so much!

Like another user suggestion, I added oatmeal and substituted wheat germ for the wheat bran.  I also substituted two bananas for the butter.  These were good, but frankly, I think they could do with a little brown sugar.

These were so much better than I expected! (Isn't that terrible?!) They are soft and full of flavor. I used chunky peanut butter and I think it helped a great deal with the texture. I like them as is, of course, but I am thinking for more of a treat I will try some brown sugar next time; doesn't need a lot. I made half my batch with raisins and they are really good too! I used wheat germ instead of bran and there was a bit more egg in mine; I halved the recipe but used a whole egg because I'm lazy. Anyway, these are yummy and my son will love them! Thanks!

I really liked these, mainly for the fact that it's so good for you. I did add 1/2 oatmeal and a bananna, and used the wheat germ instead. Next time I'm gonna add just a  little sugar if I want them more sweet, but I think you could eat these for breakfast really. Great recipe

These were better than I thought they'd be!  I didn't have enough honey so I threw in the difference in sugar.  Didn't have wheat germ so I omitted.  Added 1/3 cup raisins, 1/3 cup choc chips, 1/3 milk, 2/3 cup oats.  Substituted 1/4 of the butter for applesauce.  So versatile and easy.

This was a pretty good recipe considering there is no sugar or white flour. They have a different texture than normal cookies, but I used wheat germ instead of wheat bran which may have something to do with it. I might try adding a banana and some oatmeal like some other reviewers have done next time. I also thought they taster better once they had cooled.

Thanks for this wonderful basic recipe for healthy cookies.... I made a few modification .I didnt have powdered milk, but added a banana, raisins, a little more than 1/2 cup of peanut butter, and a little unsweetened maple syrup and wheat germ. I used almost 1/3 cup unsweetened applesauce and just a little butter...next time, Ill also add dried cranberries and maybe some slivered almonds ....I also froze small bags of six each...to take along on car trips instead of the store bought bars..

Fantastic recipe!  I added half a cup of brown sugar that I creamed into the butter before I added the peanut butter and honey.  Also used whole wheat PASTRY flour which made them unbelievably fluffy.  Used wheat germ instead of bran.  These are so good and nutritious, as cookies go.  Not like I need an excuse of them being healthier to eat them, they are totally yummy!

I do less sugar (maybe about 1/3 c instead) and 1 c. oats instead of 1 c. of flour.  Sometimes I do flax seed instead of eggs (for a denser texture), but I always add flax even if I do eggs.  They're delicious!!

YUM!  These are so good even my hubby gobbles them down.  I didn't have wheat bran or germ, so I ground up some flax seed and subbed flax meal.  I did cut the amount down a little bit, because I also ground my own wheat flour, so had a little bit of wheat germ in there anyways.  I also added some chocolate chips -- I know, not as healthy, but my boys are chocoholics!  Next time I will try without though, and also try subbing some applesauce for about 1/2 the butter to see if these remain as delicious as they are now!

This is a good place to start, but definitely needs some tweaking.  I made them by the recipe and the bran is a bit overwhelming and the milk powder is too strong.  If I make them again I'll decrease the bran to 1/4 cup and increase the ww flour to 1 1/4 cup.  May cut back on the milk powder as well.  Think it needs a little more Peanut Butter and maybe some spice, like cinnamon or nutmeg.  I may add a little brown sugar as some of the other reviewers suggested.

These were absolutely scrumptious. I couldn't stay out of them. I made them with the wheat germ and added some oatmeal as other posters suggested. I did not add any brown sugar and they were the perfect amount of sweet. Very light and delicate cookies. I will be making these many times over.

We love this recipe.  Quick and easy to make with my toddler.  The only change we made is to substitute ground flax seed for the wheat bran. They came out soft and chewy with just a hint of sweetness.

I loved these but I tweaked some things (small things!!). I was looking for a Breakfast Cookie recipe that was healthy and yummy for the kids (and adults, who am I kidding??). The changes I made: added an egg, used instant organic flavored oatmeal in place of the dry milk, used wheat germ in place of the wheat bran and added some golden raisins.

For the record, the kids (and adults) do love this and I certaily don't mind them eating them!

These were pretty good but had a more cakey consistancy than a cookie one. I used germ instead of the bran and didn't have any milk powder so just left it out.. I also added a mashed banana and a few tablespoons of brown sugar. Not bad for a healthy cookie but not sure if they quite hit the spot..

A tasty little cookie.  Turns out rather cakey, but some like it that way. I put some raisins in it as well to add a hint of sweetness.  A good call due to natural peanut butter.  The housemates loved them.

Great! Ran out of honey, so used half amount as molasses. Used crunchy peanut butter. Added dairy free mini "chocolate chips" and dried cherries. Added 1/2 cup brown sugar. Added cinnamon, ginger, allspice (1/2 tsp each).Sprinkled tops of half with colored sugar. A dozen "disappeared" within 5 minutes. A dozen left to go.

I definitely like these, and although you can tell that they are somewhat different with healthier ingredients, they almost taste like less sweet peanut butter cookies.  They are very soft and bake up golden.  I concur with other reviewer's suggestions to add oats and raisins--I think the next time I make them I will add golden raisins and about 1/2 cup of oats.  Even without those things, these cookies are very nice.  I like that they aren't very sweet and I love the taste of the peanut butter.  Very nice cookie that would be lovely for breakfast.  Thanks for the recipe!

these are very good.  I altered them as other reviewers recomened by adding 1/2c rolled oats, substituting 1/2c applesauce for butter and I added 1/2 bag dark chocolate chips.  I will no longer be buying the breakfast cookies sold at the grocery store, these are better!

Delicious!  As previously suggested, I added one ripe bananna and 1/4 cup brown sugar.  I didn't have powdered milk so I omitted that.  I subbed the bran with wheat germ and added about 2 tbs flax powder.  We all loved them.

As an overall cookie in general, I'd give these 4 starts, but as a sugar-free, healthier version of a peanut butter cookie, it gets 5 STARS!  Very easy to make. I used wheat germ instead of the bran and Carnation powdered cream instead of the powdered milk.  I softened my butter in the microwave and it had started to melt a little, which would probably account for the soft consistency of the batter.  But I put them on parchment paper and they flattened out beautifully -- nice and round and thin.  Perfect.  When they first came out of the oven they were crispy around the edges but soft and chewy in the middle.  I wanted a crispy cookie so I turned off the oven and put the cookies back in for a while to crisp up.  They are really, really good.  I'll try cranberries and/or using fresh made peanut butter using honey roasted peanuts.  Brought them to my office and no one could tell they were "healthy."  Kinda has a texture/taste reminiscent of a graham cracker.

Firstly, I used chunky peanut butter and the cookies turned out fine. My friends were pleasantly surprised that there was no sugar in the cookies. The cookies turned out pretty nice. It's a great healthy alternative to other peanut butter cookies! It's nothing ground-breaking but it's a nice chewy comfort cookie for a peanut-fanatic like me.

You can't beat the texture of these cookies. They're wonderfully soft and chewy. I even kept a few in the freezer and they were still soft when I took them out! I did, however, feel that they were lacking a little bit in flavor. They were plenty sweet, but they just seemed to lack something -- can't put my finger on it. I added 1/2 c oatmeal and 1/2 c dried cranberries(both of which helped create that great texture). I used wheat germ instead of bran and omitted the dry milk. Next time I may try adding a banana, some spices, and/or some coconut.

Excellent! I substituted applseauce for the butter to make them even more guilt free. I also added about 1/2 cup of crushed flake cereal (Total)plus a little coconut. I baked half the batch this way and they were great. Then for a treat added a handful of chocolate chips to the other half. Still good, but I liked them without the chocolate. Be careful, these don't keep too well.

Excellent!  I have been on a no sugar diet...after a month of no sugar these were nice and sweet.  YUMMY!  My children even loved them.  They would be really good with some chocolate chips in them...semi-sweet...=)

Tasty and healthy. I was a bit disappointed that they were quite soft. I prefer a bit of crunch in my cookies. I used fine organic stone ground flour which may be part of the reason for their softness.

I was really impressed with this recipe.  I have been trying to stay away from any refined sugar and am a huge sweet eater.  These cookies hit the spot.  I love the consistency too - a little crunchy but also soft and moist.  I'm saving this one for sure!

These tasted like cardboard. Even fresh out of the oven, they were extremely dry and tasteless.

These came out quite tasty w/ a few alterations: I used 1/4c applebutter & 1/4c of lite butter, 2 egg whites, wheat germ in place of oat bran, and no milk powder.  Also the peanut butter I used was Simply Jif.  Excellent cookie!

Great recipe! Quick&healthy. I too like to use the germ instead of the bran. Perfect for after working out to replenish carbs and protein.

Good recipe. I like that they are healthier than the average cookie and they taste good too.  My 4 year old loved them.  I too added about 1/2 cup of oatmeal. I also added 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips. Might try adding some brown sugar next time.

Very good - I'd use a little less baking soda though.  1 T seemed a bit much!
