Made as is and very tasty - great marinade. We would like the skin a little crispier so next time may turn the oven to broil for a few minutes before pulling out to crisp up a bit. All in all great recipe and thanks for sharing!

Pretty good. Family enjoyed it. Only change was to add a bit of minced garlic to the marinate ( we love garlic).

I tried this in a crockpot on low and it was ready in under four hours. My family and guests liked it. I skinned the chicken by peeling it off while it was partially frozen (before marinating).

Wonderful recipe. I followed as written with the exception that I did not use Kikkoman branded sauces and I used half of a spatchcock chicken instead of drumsticks. After the hour in the oven I returned the chicken to skin side up and broiled on low until the skin was lightly browned. YUMMY. I then removed the chicken to a plate to rest for a few minutes. While this was resting I combined 2 Tablespoons of corn starch with 1/4 cup of chicken broth and mixed into the remaining sauce. I added in 1 teaspoon of soy sauce as well. I brought this to a slow boil while whisking until my desired thickness was reached. The sauce was a fantastic dipping sauce and was also a nice topper for my fried broccoli and fried rice. The chicken was fabulous and the sauce put it over the top. Definitely will make again. Thanks!

Didn't have Hoisin sauce so kindof threw together some stuff to try to mimic it (dark karo syrup chines 5 spice a couple of dashes of chinese hot sauce and a tiny bit of cooking sherry). No idea if it even came close but MAN was this DELICIOUS! I think it was the best chicken I've ever made! One of my 7 year old twins at THREE drumsticks (all of my kids are picky eaters and eat like little birds)!!! I was so disappointed when I came home from class to ZERO leftovers!

Delicious! Made extra sauce and thickened it with a cornstarch slurry. Served chicken over rice with green beans and drizzled sauce over everything. Add some chili garlic paste for a little spice.

This was very very good and quite easy. The skin was nicely browned but not so crispy as to be burned but it very effectively sealed in the moistue and juice of the chicken. I used the pan juices to make an excellent stir-fried rice.

Super tasty! Making it tonight for the 2nd time in two weeks. Didn't have drumsticks on hand so I'm using chicken tenderloins...other than cooking time I'm sure it will make no difference. First time went strictly per the recipe (I believe you should always do that!). This time just to see I added a pinch of red pepper flakes 1/4 tsp garlic powder and a few grinds off the pepper mill. Oh and I don't have any green onions either so I added one tsp of dried chives to get that hint of onion flavor. We'll see...will let you know!!

This was easy to make quick and simplistic. Nothing WOW 5 stars about it. I used my foodsaver marinator to marinate the chicken which made it quicker. I am not a fan of drumsticks so next time I will try it with chicken thighs

This was okay my wife and I both ate it and it was very handy to throw together in a hurry but I've had much nicer marinades. I would suggest thickening the sauce as some others have suggested and I would cook the chicken at a higher temperature for a shorter time as it was overcooked in my opinion. (425 for 30 mins). Not bad if you are in a hurry but if you had time I would go for something different.

Made this for dinner for myself and my hubby who doesn't like dark meat chicken. I skipped the green onion and opted for fresh garlic cloves in the marinade and used agave nectar in place of honey since that's what I had on hand. I cooked it with the marinade still in the pan and basted and turned it. Cooked it at 375 and then 400 for the last 10 minutes. It came out really good. The skin was mushy but that's ok we just pulled it off. The meat almost fell off the bone! Hubby ate it and actually complimented it! Will be making this again as it was so easy!

I tried this tonight. My boys have friends over so I wasn't sure how it would go. They all ate it and two went back for seconds! I modified by using boneless skinless chicken breast meat cut into large chunks (eat breast cut into 3rds). I marinated for 3 hours. Followed some other folks advise to add a some garlic and ground cayenne pepper. I dusted it with ground cayenne pepper and ground garlic and black pepper sprinkled over the top before I baked it. I couldn't wait to try it. It was delicious! We served it over white rice.

This turned out okay. I tasted the sauce after the ingredients were added and it wasn't quite sweet enough so I added honey to taste. Also (and I didn't mark down for this) this recipe wasn't very conducive to grilling. I should have followed the instructions and baked it because the glaze was a bit charred before the chicken was done. It still tasted good and I'll definitely use this marinade again with baking and then maybe broiling for the last few minutes to get a crispier skin.

This is pretty good - and my family likes it fine. I prefer it to taste less of the hoisin sauce. I grilled it for 30 minutes and the drumsticks were not quite as done as I like. Maybe another 10 minutes?

Great recipe. I'm making it for the 2nd time & doubling the recipe. I have followed the recipe almost exactly - I've left out the green onions both times because I didn't have any on hand but I don't doubt that they'd taste very good with the recipe. The ingredients in the marinade are all thick and sticky so I highly recommend putting a light coat of oil on your measuring tools - this makes it so much easier to measure the ingredients and clean up later.

I made this recipe using 5lbs leg quarters without the skin. 3/4 cup teriyaki sauce 1/3 hoisin sauce 1/3 cup honey. I oovered with foil and baked at 350 for 1hr 10min. I removed the foil the last 30 minutes. This recipe was a hit with my family.

Great tasting marinade. However I found it very thick... so I thinned it out a bit by adding 1/4 cup of oilve oil to the mixture and it poured nicely over the chicken(I used chicken breast).Marinated it for 3 hours and baked at 375F for 1 hour. Came out perfect. Nice and juicy.Will definately make again.
