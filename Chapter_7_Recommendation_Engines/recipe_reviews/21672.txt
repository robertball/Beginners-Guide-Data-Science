Great recipe, so simple and great on ice cream or alone. I took other people's suggestions and added 1 t. vanilla, only 1 t. cornstarch and nutmeg.

Simply divine! So good and so easy you'd be tempted to make this every day! Ya just gotta love it when a few ingredients that you have on hand come together to create something so delicious. I did throw in a bit of vanilla for good measure and used Granny Smith Apples that I had on hand. I opted to use this as a pancake topping, but this has so many possibilites...side dish for pork or ham, over french toast or oatmeal, over top ice cream or pound cake or just all by itself!

Yum!  These were delicious and the entire family loved them.  I used what I had on hand... half red delicious and half granny smith and added a bit more cinnamon since we love it.  I cooked them a little longer since my kids like them tender.  We served them over the Good Old Fashioned Pancakes recipe that is also on this site.  The combination made a heavenly breakfast.  We will definitely be making these on a regular basis and yes, they did remind us of the apples at Boston Market.  Thank you for sharing Jenny!

I give this one star because the butter and  sugar aren't necessary.  I use any Red apples on hand. A little water on the bottom of a pot, cut up apples, let cook til almost soft, add cinnamon: sweet & delish without butter or sugar. Can add a touch of maple syrup or honey if wanted.

I had intended on using this for our pancake topping BUT half my family ate it before the pancakes were done!! The LOVED it! I ended up making a second batch exclusively for the pancakes...also well received!! I did add 1 tsp of vanilla too but it really doesn't matter = my family loved this by itself AND as a topping! Thanks a bunch Jenny!

Don't you love when the "accurate and dependable's" tell you you're getting an inch of snow and you end up with eight? So, for our snow day yesterday, I decided that my only breakfast eater would really like this in her oatmeal. She absolutely loved this! I had Mac's and Granny's on hand, but after reading Nicole's review, decided that the Mac's would work better. They cooked up really fast. Thanks Jenny!

great on top of pancakes or over ice cream. Sometimes I will throw in raisons or dried cranberries as well as walnuts for a change.

I have made these a number of times and they have been great every time!  Everyone in my house loves them, with pancakes,crepes, pork tenderloin or even alone.  They are so good, everyone should try them!

I made this to go with pork chops instead of the usual applesauce.  My husband loved it.  I recomment using tart apples, otherwise it would be too sweet.  I would also add just a pinch of salt.  I will be making this again.

I made these apples to bring to a breakfast at work.  It received rave reviews!  I used MacIntosh apples and doubled the recipe.  I cooked the apples the night before and put them in my slow-cooker to reheat.  I couldn't find the cinnamon chips one reviewer mentioned but will continue to look for them.  All in all, this is definitely a keeper!

These turned out soooo good.  My son thought it was just like Boston Markets sauteed apples.  I scaled the recipe down to 4 and used 2 large fuji apples.  I served this with the dessert crepes recipe also from this site.  Thanks for sharing Jenny.

Best ever! Very easy, especially if you have a corer/slicer/peeler for the apples. You'll need to double this recipe (at least) because it'll be gone! I did add vanilla and nutmeg as other reviewers suggested but I think without those additions this would still be a 5-star.

This is delicious. I made this twice so far, and the first time, I followed the recipe exactly. It was delicious, worth the 5 stars, but the second time, I added a tablespoon of brown sugar and 2 tablespoons of cold water (with 1/4 teaspoon of cornstarch) for more syrup. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla. So good over lightly buttered toast!

I followed the recipe exactly and it was awesome!  I served over waffles for my dad, my brother, and myself.  I'm only ten and I pretty much did it myself, but my mom helped me with skinning the apples and a little bit with cutting them into the small pieces.  I also think that the sauce tasted really good on waffles. I even think that it tasted better than maple syrup.  It seems like this would taste good on ice cream and pancakes.  I love the recipe! I will probably make this recipe again.

Very good way to serve apples (Granny Smith are best) but, for me, it needs a dash of fresh lemon juice.   This always brings out the flavor in apples. Makes an excellent sauce for roast pork or tenderloin.

Using a recipe for cooked apples is different for me, this is one of those dishes you just throw together and it always comes out a bit differently. In an effort to achieve consistency I tried this recipe - the apples came out perfect, and the method was easy.  I will stick with this recipe from now on.

These are so much better than Cracker Barrel's fried apples. I didn't change a thing and they were amazing. I made a half recipe as a side dish for breakfast this morning and we all loved them. Thanks for the great recipe!

So good. I doubled the sauce and we served on a Dutch oven pancake cooked in a cast-iron skillet. Sooooo good! Next time I may slice the apples just a bit thicker, they broke apart a bit for us but it was WONDERFUL. Oh and we only had sweet apples so I lowered the sugar for our tastes. Really yum, thanks.

Simple and delicious!!! Due to so many reviews saying there was too much corn starch being called for, I played it safe and reduced it to 1 teaspoon. I found this to be a PERFECT amount to allow it to thicken but not be so thick like honey. I was making pork chops that were marinated in soy sauce and wanted a side dish to counteract the saltiness... these were awesome together! Thanks for a keeper. =)

I just made this recipe with golden delicious apples. The only change I made was adding 1 t. of vanilla like other readers suggested. This was delicious!! This would definately be very good on pancakes. Definately will make this again. Thanks for the simple, yummy recipe!!

I only used 1tbsp butter and brown sugar with 2 very large Mcintosh apples, instead of cornstarch and water I added some apple butter syrup and applesauce that I had small amounts of in the fridge, I cooked over high heat to thicken, used it to fill Basic Crepes really good.

This is so easy!  I am always looking for ways to make breakfast a little different.  As suggested in other reviews, I doubled the sauce, added vanilla and a little heavy cream.  It makes the sauce taste like caramel.  My three boys loved it over pancakes!  It has become a regular in our house!

I made these as a side dish for dinner. These apples were perfect, everyone in my family loved them. I do think they need to have a lid on while cooking, mine didn't get too tender after 6 min. but as far as flavor I would have to say they're delicious! I didn't change a thing except for adding a tsp of vanilla, and I think they would be just as good if I didn't add it. I would love to try them on ice cream or in a pastry of some sort. These would also be a quick way to make an apple crisp. I will make these on a regular basis from now on.

These are my favorite kinds of recipes, the ones that are so simple but so full of flavor. I absolutely loved these and so did my son. We ate them as is but definitely want to try with ice cream and over French toast. I think this would make a really decadent pie/apple crisp filling as well. The recipe is good as written and I also found a splash of rum makes it even tastier :) Two thumbs up!

5 stars as is. I add some boiled apple cider (which is a thick syrup)  if I have it, in place of some of the sugar and it kicks up the apple flavor, too. I also - as some have recommended sometimes add a little vanilla and a couple grates of nutmeg. But... 5 stars as is!!

This recipe is awesome! The apples always come out perfect and it's great with oatmeal in the morning. I would definitely recommend this to everyone.

Great, but I double the sauce and I add whipping cream if I have it. Wonderful over french toast!

I added a little more brown sugar & cinnamon then the recipe stated... kind of just eyed it.

My son hates syrup on his pancakes so I decided to try this recipe as a topping for them. We both really liked it. I only had 1/4 cup brown sugar so I added about 1/8 cup of white also. I also did not have any cornstarch so I substituted 1 1/2 TBS. white flour.

Just awesome. Made as a side dish to go with grilled pork chops and parmesan risotto. Took a little longer to cook and for apples to tenderize than the recipe stated.. but man was it delicious. Added a little vanilla extract. Will definately consider using this as an ice cream/pancake/waffle topping in the future. Loved it!!

I made these as a topping for waffles this morning and they were delicious! The ingredients, directions, cooking time were right on the money. I added a dash of nutmeg to the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture. My family said it tasted like warm apple pie. A very sweet, warm syrup that filled our tummies! These were served right out from the skillet and onto, "Classic Waffles," from this website. I may use this as a vanilla ice cream topping next or with pork chops. Thank you for sharing.

I'm really tired of candied sweet potatoes and carrot souffle and I wanted something different to go with the Easter ham so I made this. I'd say the people who came early when it was still piping hot enjoyed it best.  It did not look as appitizing once it got cold in the skillet.  Actually, that's the only reason I gave it 4 instead of five stars.  I guess I could have kept them warm in a crock pot, but I was afraid they'd get mushy under steady heat.  I added a little vanilla like other folks and some walnuts.  It was quick and good and I'd definitely make it again.

Made these for Easter to go with the Ham.  Changed it to serve 30 instead of 8.  Used Granny Smith apples.  Very Tasty.  The family went back for seconds and thirds, eating these instead of the dessert that was brought!

A great recipe.  I subsituted the cornstarch with tapioca flour.  The reason I made it the second time was not only to enjoy with dinner but to eliminate the cooked fish smell in my house!!

We loved these! I can't eat raw apples (same with many other fruits) so this is a great way to have some fruit. We had these on pancakes tonight and I'm definitely doing that again. Will also make them as a snack or breakfast. I think I'll take the brown sugar down a notch just because I prefer less sweetness.

I can't rave enough about these apples! I have been looking for a recipe that is similar to the fried apples at Cracker Barrel, and this is it.  I had large apples, so I just used 2 instead of the 4 that the recipe called for. I had to slice the apples ahead of time, so I cut them up and coated them with lemon juice and water and rinsed them off right before cooking. THESE ARE GREAT!!!

Made exactly as written. Used 4 small granny smith and 3 small red delicious just to get rid of what I had on hand. The granny smith pieces were definitely better. Will make again with green only. A+

This recipe was a big hit. I served them with pork chops for dinner. I reheated the leftovers and served them the next morning with oatmeal for my daughter and put them in cottage cheese for myself. Super tasty. I will definitely use this recipe again.

These are good.  I used 4 Greenings apples (like Granny Smith) and I only used 1/4 cup of brown sugar and about 1/4 t of nutmeg.  I think 1/2 cup of sugar would have been too sweet.  My apples partially disintegrated but they may have been too ripe.

Made exactly other than adding nutmeg as well. Used as topping for cheesecake and it was great! It wasn't sickening sweet and everyone loved it. Used Fuji apples

Nice as a desert. I added 1 tsp of vanilla as others suggested and it was perfect.

Very good. I have made them twice now, once following the directions and the second time using some reviews. Both times they turned out wonderful. We did seem to enjoy the modified one better, all I did was add tsp of vanilla and used 1 Tbsp of cornstarch.

Whenever we need something to spice up our breakfast - could be waffles pancakes toast whatever - I throw some apples on and it's instantly gourmet. You can't go wrong with this one.

Really good recipe. I made using golden washington apples. They are a bit tart so I had to use a little more sugar. Once I got all the ingrediants in the skillet I cooked the apples on low for about 15 minutes so all the flavors will come together. Husband said it reminds him of his grandmothers applesauce.

Sliced them thinner and added a little less cornstarch so I could pour it over pancakes and have the syrup really soak in. WOW.  So delicious.  Everyone raved about it and requested I make a pound cake so they could have something to eat the leftovers on!

These were great.  I made these according to the recipe except that I did cook them a little longer that stated.  They were not as tender as I wanted after the 6 or 7 minutes.  I served these at Thanksgiving Dinner and they were all eaten!  Success!

FANTASTIC recipe!  I thought this would be as good as the sauteed apples you get at the Cracker Barrel restaurants, but it is BETTER!  No changes were made or are necessary.  I was looking for a side dish to go with pork chops and this was perfect.  I will definitely be making it again.  Thank you 356 for sharing!

This recipe is a great start, but had to change a few things. As is it comes out too sweet, cut back the sugar, and I added 1 tsp nutmeg and 1 tsp of vanilla. This came out better the second time around with the changes I mentioned...........

I have had several requests for this already. I use granny smith apples and add brown sugar to the butter and cinnamon to sweeten it just the way i like it. Thanks for this recipe as it was hard to find a spiced apples side dish~

This was very good.  I pretty much followed the recipe, I just added about 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg, also 1 teaspoon of vanilla, and I upped the cinnamon to 1 teaspoon.  I think next time I may cut down the butter to 2 Tbl, I'm thinking I won't miss it!  Served with vanilla ice cream.

These were very, very good.  They do taste almost identical to the Boston Market apples.  Be sure to follow the direction that says to cook them until they're ALMOST tender as the additional cooking time will make them mushy if you don't.  Even if they do get too mushy, they still taste wonderful! Thanks for a real keeper!

These were heavenly.....HEAVENLY!!!  I used a honeycrisp apple and since I was out of ground cinnamon when I came to make this, I threw in a small handful of Hershey's cinnamon chips and let them melt into a gooey sauce that made these apples to die for.  I used these as a topper for french toast, but it would be great paired with ice cream or pie as well.  Cannot wait to make these babies again!!!!

Do you like eating the contents of an apple pie but tend to leave the crust untouched?  Then this recipe is for you.  I made this last night and we ate it over vanilla ice cream.  My mother went nuts over it.  I used flour (4 tsp) instead of cornstarch.

These apples are excellent. We've found that Granny Smith apples give us the best results. The only thing we do differently is to add a bit of Mexican vanilla to them while they're cooking, and it puts them over the top. These are great as a topping to the Creme Brulee French Toast recipe on this site. So good.

To die for...these tasted just like the ones we get in a restaurant!  I followed it to a T, except that I halved the recipe for my husband and I.  Served with grilled NY strip steaks and baked potatoes.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks :)

This is such an easy recipe! So simple, minimal ingredients; a keeper for sure. I topped them off with my favorite crumble recipe (1/2c. flour, 1/2c. oats, 3/4c. sugar, 1/2c. mayo, cinnamon) and a scoop of ice cream. Yummy!!

This is the apple recipe I have been searching for! All of the others I've attempted have been super runny, this has a delicious thick sauce and the apples cooked up perfectly. I added a bit more cinnamon, but that's just our preference for spice. This is a keeper for sure!

4 teaspoons of flour will work in place of cornstarch - I read the reviews and had high expectations for this recipe.. it is even better than I imagined. This really works with many different types of meals, even on its own!! Definitely recommend for an easy dessert or if you have a bunch of extra apples laying around!

Just ok.  I was really excited to serve this as a topping for pancakes, but nobody in my family (including my 3 kids) liked it much at all.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was nothing special.  I probably won't fix this again.

Made these as directed and they were really, really tasty.  I made them as a side dish for a potluck, but I think they'd be great with ice cream, over pancakes, or in a variety of other dishes.

I usually always go with granny smith apples when doing something like this but all I had were honeycrisps and decided to give them a try. They were perfect!! I loved them and I loved the easy and taste of this recipe.

This is a wonderful, easy recipe! To often I have left over apples that no one will eat and I just hate throwing them out, so this is what I do with the apple that are about to go to waste. My family loves this dish whether its with porkchops at dinner or with sausage for breakfast.Thank you!

So so so so GOOD!!!  This is unbelievably easy to make and so yummy.  I did add a dash of nutmeg and 1 tsp of vanilla to the mix.  and make sure you use a good baking apple.  I used cortlands and they turned out great, however while I was making this I was cutting slices from an ozark gold to feed my son (not a good baking apple) and inadvertently got a few slices in with the cortlands.  I could pick out the OG apples in the finished product bc they were really mushy.  still tasted good but had I used them on purpose in this recipe it would have been a mistake.  the only complaint I have is that I didn't go out and get some vanilla bean ice cream to serve with this as it would have been sheer heaven!!

This recipe is wonderfully easy and very tasty.  I used 4 small apples picked from a friend's tree (very tart) plus one large apple from the grocery store (less tart).  I followed the suggestion of only using 1 tsp of cornstarch and added a dash of nutmeg.  It tasted great with the oatmeal pancakes (also from this site).

Turned out really, REALLY good.  I needed to use dairy free margarine, since my son has allergies, but didn't effect the flavor.  I'm certain butter would have given it a richer flavor, but that wasn't an option for us.  I served them as a side dish with grilled pork chops and steamed broccoli-  yummy!  My son asked if he could eat the left over apples for breakfast :)  I doubled the recipe- based on other reviews and added vanilla.

AWESOME!  SOOOO EZ & SOOOO GOOD.  I made this as a side for my wife who insists on having apple sauce with grilled pork chops.  Well, I forgot to pick up the apple sauce but had plenty of apples here so I decided to try something different.  Not only was it perfect with the pork, but it even gave the carrots a sweet glaze.  And there was plenty so later on that night we heated up what was left and poured it over some vanilla ice cream.

5 stars for sure.  I forgot to peel the apple, but it was still great!  I agree that this would go best with breakfast.  I served this with a sandwich and my hubby thought it tasted too dessert like to be served as a side.

Absolutely fabulous - wonderful flavor! I also added a little more cinnamon and simmered longer at the end to have a softer apple. Yum, yum, yum! This recipe is a keeper. My family loved them, too!!!! Better than canned, Cracker Barrel, or Bob Evans!!!!

Perfect exactly as written!  
That being said, I can see how it could easily be adapted to suit individual tastes or for different applications (e.g. adding vanilla if using for a dessert or pancake topping).
Next time, I'll add an extra apple (just to lighten it up per serving.)  Also, I would say it serves 6 not 8 - It's so good, you are going to want a larger serving!

A very nice recipe for a side dish to serve with pork or by itself.  The sauce is just the right thickness and the method makes it all turn out just right.  Remove from heat just after sauce thickens nicely, though.  I left it on low for a while, and the sauce thinned and the apples kind of wilted.  Still good, but would have been better had I served it right away.

Delicious!  Just like G'ma used to make!  I have made this with & without the cornstarch.  With is more syrup-like but always good, especially on ice cream!  I added dried cranberries instead of raisins, yum!

We loved this! I scaled the recipe down to 2 servings, using 1 granny smith apple. I added 1/8 teaspoon of nutmeg and 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla before boiling. Perfect!

These apples were delicious! I was scared making them having no experience at all but it turned out great. They were a surprisingly brilliant side dish for my steak dinner.

*I only used 1 tsp cornstarch.

This just about goes without saying. These are fantastic! I don't know if I had tart apples or not? I just had a bag of kind of large red apples. I typed in 4 servings and pressed the calculate button to try it out. I was glad I did because the two apples just fit in the pan. I used whipped butter, because it is what I had on hand, it is lower in saturated fat anyway. I had to saute about 3 minutes more than suggested to slightly soften. These would be perfect with a hearty breakfast. TY!

Easy to make and great to use as a substitution for maple syrup when serving pancakes.  I doubled the ingredients (except the amount of apples) to make more sauce.

I made these one snowy day (because I had everything on hand) and served over pancakes.  I followed the recipe exactly with fantastic results.  It proved to be one of my favorite breakfasts ever.  The leftover apples were heated up the next night and served over vanilla ice cream for dessert.

I served these as part of our Sunday breakfast, and they turned out exactly as I hoped!  I used Smart Balance Light in place of the butter (dairy allergies) and arrowroot powder in place of the corn starch (corn allergies), but those were the only changes.  These were so quick and easy--and so simply delicious--that I know we will be having them again and again.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

Absolutely delicious!  Do not try to speed this up or else the inside of the apple slices will not be cooked.  They may look done on the outside, but just wait until the full 15 minutes is up, you will be glad you did!

Very good and easy to make, just a little time consuming peeling and slicing the apples, but well worth it!  I had 8 almost too ripe fuji apples and they turned out wonderfully in place of the 4 large apples.  I'll definately be making this again.

Really tasty way to use up apples! My friend who owned a restaurant and was a pastry chef used to make a stuffed croissant french toast that used a carmel sauce and apples that tasted kind of like this. If you cut open a croissant part way, spread a thin layer of cream cheese and add these apples inside before gently soaking them in a french toast custard and cooking as usual in a buttered pan, you'll have something truly amazing to serve for a fancy breakfast! I will be sure to use this recipe instead from now on!

These are really good. The first time I made them I served them over Dulce de Leche ice cream and it was awesome. The second time I made it I served it with pork chops. Way better than apple sauce.

These are great!  To vary this a little but use the same ingredients with a package of crescent rolls... put the cut up apples into crescent rolls, bake about 1/2 the time on the package, then take them out and pour the sauce from this recipe on top and finish baking.  Scrumptious!!

I liked the flavor before the cornstarch was added. After adding the cornstarch it lost some of the wonderful flavor it had, so...I added some cranberries, rasins and lemon juice. Wow! This is a keeper. Next time I will cut back on the cornstarch.

My kids went crazy for this.  I used Macintosh apples and I served it as a side dish so I chose to cut down on the brown sugar a bit and also added an extra bit of cinnamon sprinkled over the top for a really pretty presentation.  I was prepared to use the leftovers to make a crisp but there was none leftover!

Delicious as a side to my friend's pork loin pot-luck dinner, and awesome on vanilla ice cream for dessert! Don't be afraid to reduce the butter if you have a non-stick pot like me! Try it out!

Take our advice – make this recipe as written.  Change nothing! You won’t be sorry.  We skipped the waffles & went directly to topping vanilla ice cream (while the apples were still warm).  Outstanding!!!

Really really yummy! I didn't have cornstarch so I used flour and it was still really good. (When substituting cornstarch with flour remember to use double the amt.of flour as you would with cornstarch)

Wonderful recipe and so easy to make.  I found I didnt have any cornstarch and used flour instead.  I coupled these apples with french toast, powdered sugar, a drizzle of caramel, and chopped nuts.  Quite impressive!

Wonderful Side Dish
Like the fried apples from the Cracker Barrel restaurant? If so, use this recipe & modify slightly.  If u like apples a bit less sweet, reduce the sugar a bit to 1/3 cup, cook a little less time until apples are just still a bit firm to the bite, & serve as a side w/baked ham, pork roast/chops, fried/roast chicken or even w/those frozen chicken strips for the kids. Very easy/quick to make & a nice way to include fruit in a meal.

Made this yesterday morning for breakfast with pancakes. Added 1 tsp. vanilla and increased cinnamon to 1 tsp. Delicious! Reminds me of the fried apples at Cracker Barrel.

Well, it's definitely a sugar lover's paradise!  I served these with Buttermilk Pancakes II as suggested by another reviewer on that recipe, and they were good!  Also served thick cut ranch bacon fresh from the butcher.  Yummy!  I might cut back on the brown sugar next time, as they were a little too sweet for my tastes, but very good, and very easy!

Thanks to prior reviews, used a touch more cinnamon and added about 1 tsp of vanilla. Excellent over pancakes! I will try others advice about using this as a pie or cake filling! Great GREAT recipe, I wish I would have thought of this but thank you for sharing your wisdom Jenny! :]

I made these for Christmas morning breakfast and everyone loved them.  They did take a little longer than the recipe says to become tender, but were well worth it.  We will have these again and again.

I have been looking for a recipe to substitute for the seasonal appearance of the "family-sized"  Stouffer's harvest apples. This is it. The only change I made is in using a combination of apple and fresh pear slices. Followed the rest of the recipe exactly. This is delicious and I will be using it with pork chops.  So glad to find this, thank you!

So Easy!  I followed the recipe all the way EXCEPT I boiled for about 10 minutes.  My family LOVES these apples...Not too sweet.  Just right flavor.  We put the warm mixture over ice cream. Please ignore reviewers who give negative reviews and they haven't even tried the recipe!!  They make up their own recipe and tell you not to use this one. Ridiculous!

Amazing!!! So easy to make!! I made these for a family dinner as a side dish for a pork tenderloin. Everyone devoured them including the kids (ages 1, 2 & 3). I made the apples ahead of time and warmed them up just before serving dinner. The only change I made was I added 1 tsp of vanilla. A must try!

Absolute perfection! I have made this as written but recently adapted the recipe by using coconut oil in place of butter and leaving out the cornstarch. I also use a coarse organic brown sugar and it comes out just as well! Perfect over pancakes!

I make this frequently because my grandkids love it.  I use about 1 T. butter and just a t. of brown sugar....as the apples cook, they sweeten up a lot.  Usually 1 t. cornstarch is enough, since the pectin from the apples will also thicken the sauce.

I'm glad I found a base recipe for apples.  My two little girls loved me this morning when I topped their french toast with it.  As with other reviews I read, the cornstarch was a bit much and made it the consistency of honey (Good as is if you're eating the apples as a side)  Since I was using as topping I had to adjust this a bit, added another 1/2 c water and a pinch more cinnamon.  I used granny smith so it was a perfect balance of tart/sweetness.  I used the four apple and it was not enough for 4 people, next time will double the recipe.  If you are using sweeter apples then cut down on the sugar.  I peeled and then used a apple slicer and these cuts were perfect but it also took longer time for them to be cooked thoroughly maybe double the time stated.  Great recipe as an idea for starters and can be adjusted easily to taste.  Next time will be making with skin on :D

Tried this one today. I followed as what it says, turned out it was tasty. I give 4 stars because somehow it left a slightly bitter-like aftertaste. I suspect because I use not tart-apple which means 'sour type apple' as my husband said. Next time I'll try to find the right apple instead. Still was a great company for my french crepes though, that my husband said 'it's tasty, hun!' :D

Well, today is 12/21/12 - the end of the Mayan calendar and also the beginning of winter.  I wanted to try these apples to ensure a full belly for the afterlife as well as keeping a thick winter coat/waistline!!  I also wanted to test them before making them for my Christmas Eve table (serving roasted pork tenderloin).  I have to say they were really, really good!  I made the recipe exactly as written using granny smith apples.  Well I am definitely make these for my holiday meal now.

Amazing!  So fast and easy to make!  I've made this a few times and used whatever apples I had on hand (gala, macintosh, granny smith, golden delicious).  I always add a tad bit more cinnamon...approx 1 tsp.  Always good to use as waffle or pancake toppings.  Delicious!

Such a great recipe....Thanks 356!  Followed the recipe and rated it 5 Stars.  Then I added some spiced rum flavoring that I had on hand from another recipe and a splash of fresh lemon juice and that took this recipe to the next level!  I will use this recipe often using different flavorings such as vanilla, etc.  Really easy, yet so good.

Wonderful, quick and easy recipe.  Important to note that it does call for tart apples - like Granny Smith. If you use another type of apple, such as eating apple - Red Delicious, Golden or Gala - you will not need as much sugar and they are much, much softer.  If you saute the apples too long it will turn to an applesauce consistency when finished.  If the recipe is followed exactly as written, it does actually turn out just fine. And it is so easily tweaked. :)  I thought the reviewers that remarked that it tasted like apple pie filling were "sweet" - because I don't know what else a reader would expect it to taste like. With the exception of no lemon juice, this is basically an apple pie filling recipe made on the stove top without crust. :)
 
I made one rookie mistake tho' - I wasn't paying attention during the last two minutes of cooking I left them to cook longer. Oops!  The sauce turned to caramel.  Not bad, but not what I wanted. A few tablespoons of cold water mixed in solved that in - oh, and paying attention helps too.

Delicious and SO easy! The only changes I made were: 1) leaving the peels on the apples (because I'm lazy and I want keep the fiber/nutrients that are in the skin), 2) sprinkling a bit more cinnamon, and 3)adding less brown sugar (1/4 cup). As another reviewer said, I'm tempted to make this everyday. This really took me only 20 minutes, just as the recipe predicted. I highly recommend this recipe.

Perfect! Now I need more apples to make this again- I'd love to preserve these! I found I had no cinnamon, but I used 1/4 teaspoon each of cloves, nutmeg, and 1/2 teaspoon of ginger and allspice, which I like even better! I'll just add cinnamon to those when I get some! So much better than pie, great on pancakes.

Oh my goodness!  This recipe was exactly what I have been craving for about a month!  So delicious I made it two days in a row.  Yesterday we ate them as is and this morning I mixed them with oatmeal I had made with old fashioned oats cooked according to the package only using apple cider instead of milk or water to boil the oats in.  I cannot even express in words how much I loved this recipe!  Thank you for posting!!!

Followed the recipe to a T (minus the cinnamon, which I just ran out of) and the apples came out wonderful! Even my husband, who does not like apples, ate this. I saved some of the "caramel" sauce for the next morning and put it over crepes. Yum Yum! These apples were BETTER than what I buy in the store. Definitely a new family favorite :)

Great recipe! I used 6 small apples and left the skin on for color and vitamins. Also, some comments suggested using vanilla extract. I didn't have any, so I added a capful each of Bailey's and butterscotch schnappes with the cinnamon and brown sugar. This is a great summer alternative to baked apples.

I made 1/4 of the original recipe, as all I needed was enough for my boyfriend and me. We didn't have cornstarch, so I substituted with 2x the amount of flour plus the original amount of water. I actually had to double the amount flour + water mix, there wasn't much syrup when we started with the original amount. Next time I make this, with cornstarch, I'll double the amount for the cornstarch + water mix again. This was an easy recipe and really yummy over some homemade pancakes!

Turned out perfectly! Tasted just like the inside of an apple pie. I used it to top some whole wheat pancakes and it was perfect. Added some hazelnuts and yogurt and had quite a decadent breakfast!

Simple and wonderful. I made this for a quick add to steel cut oats and am wondering why I don't eat this every day. Added a 1/4 of a cup when dissolving the cornstarch and it worked perfectly. Try it with honey crisp apples!

Nice and easy. I used white sugar instead of brown, and flour instead of cornstarch, still works!

A great way to use some apples that had been on hand for awhile.  Tasted great on our waffles.  I used 1/4  cup Splenda brown sugar blend with good results.

I loved this recipe! Yum, yum.  I did add a few things.  I used a Gala Apple, which were rather small so ended up using about 10 of them and cut them into eights.  After cutting the apples up, I added the zest of one lemon and half of a naval orange.  I added the juice of half of a lemon and half of an orange.  After added the cornstarch, brown sugar and cinnamon (I used closer to a tsp if not a little more), I also added curry power (about a tsp or more).  The dish was delicious and a favorite with the five year old.  I will definitely make it again and again.

Absolutely delicious!  Made as a side dish for our New Year's Day pork and kraut dinner.  I made the recipe exactly as written, using the Gala apples I had on hand.  It was perfect and very easy.  I will be making this again soon!

This recipe is delicious and a snap to prepare!  I popped some of these apples on top of some savory bone-in pork chops - WOW!  Next I think I'll serve them with my homemade vanilla ice cream - so many options!

Yum, I made this side instead of the standard apple sauce.  Aside from being great as a side dish everyone was saying how it would be great over pound cake and or ice cream.  This will be made again

I had a problem with this one but only because of the apples I used.  It definitely needs to be a tart apple, like a granny smith, not a gala apple late in the season.

Like eating apple pie without the crust...  I topped it with whipped cream (a pinch of sugar and a bit of vanilla extract) and my family when crazy for it.  It went so fast I immediately made a second batch and my little brothers begged me to make more for their lunches.  My stepdad said "hmffyeagood" and left the room, which means hes mad that somebody bested him.  So "hah!" to him:) and thank you for the recipe!

Delicious! I omitted the cornstarch and brown sugar (to make it less starchy and more healthy) and then put it with my oatmeal, drizzling maple syrup over top.

These were delicious!  I made them to accompany pumpkin waffles and the pairing of the flavors was great.  It makes a nice sauce and the apples come out tender and delicious.  They're sweet, but not overwhelmingly so.  We have some leftovers, so I think I may try them either in a pie crust or as an apple crisp-- it seems like a great dessert filling!

I was wanting a recipe that would give me fried apples that tasted close to the ones that you can get at a Cracker Barrel. This recipe makes for way better tasting apples than I can get at the restaurant and they are so easy to make.

Absolutely delicious and easy as well. Made EXACTLY as directed. We both can't wait to make again and serve over my homemade vanilla bean ice cream. But this first time, we enjoyed it as a side with roast pork, and shaved Brussels sprouts with pancetta.....perfect accompaniment. Thanks 356!

overally not bad works great serving over waffles or pancakes... I would add another teaspoon of corn starch though... I also cut back on the sugar because i had relatively sweet apples... and I added a drop of vanilla extract.... adding raisins sounds like it might be good... maybe I will try that next time too

Absolutely delicious! We had this as a dessert one evening topped with whipped cream.  We had leftovers, so the following morning we spooned it over our oatmeal for breakfast. This is a keeper.

This came together so quickly it was wonderful.  I served it over a biscuit and with a little bit of milk, making it similar to an apple dumpling-ish dessert.

I was looking for something other than ordinary to serve with pork chops and ran across this recipe.  So glad I tried it.  They really hit the spot.  Tasted great served with the pork.  Thanks for sharing such an EASY recipe.  Will plan to make again...and may even test them as a side dish at our next family gathering soon.

This was delicious & so easy to make. Tasted just like the ones you get at Cracker Barrel. Yummy! I had a lot of sauce, probably because my apples were pretty small so I put some sauce aside to use on French Toast the next day.

This was very easy and delicious!  A little too sweet, though. Maybe I didnt put enough apples as my niece kept on eating them as I was cutting them!

This recipe confirmed what I already thought to be true- the way to a man's heart is through cinnamon and apples! :)  These were absolutely delicious as a dessert served warm over vanilla ice cream.  You can spoon a little of the extra sauce on top and it tastes delicious.  I did add about a tablespoon of butterscotch schnapps to my apples just for a little extra flavor.  This was delicious- thanks!

Wonderful breakfast side dish and/or topping.  This goes great on top of a German Pancake.  I use a little more cinnamon and a touch of ground cloves to deepen the flavor.  Leftovers are great stirred into a bowl of warm oatmeal.

These are so good you'll have a hard time getting them to the table. My dad is a diabetic so I substituted the brown sugar for Splenda and sugar free syrup. They were still just as good as they are were with the brown sugar.

Delicious!  I halved the butter and didn't miss it.  Might even try less next time.  Great as a side for "brinner" (breakfast for dinner!), planning on leftovers to top oatmeal tomorrow, if there are any leftovers!

I followed the recipe exactly as written and it was PERFECT.  It was easy to whip together.  The house smelled GREAT for hours after cooking this.  In autumn when local apples are plentiful this is a yummy warm treat.  My husband describes it as apple pie without the crust.    I would give this recipe 10 Stars if I could.

A very easy, quick & delicious side dish or topping for waffles, pancakes or ice cream.  Granny Smith apples work well but Honey Crisps held up to cooking even better.  It freezes well, too.

Fabulous fall dessert here in chilly New Hampshire. When my teenage son came home after a loooong soccer game and reported there were SNOW flurries during his game I knew he would appreciate a piping hot serving of these Sauteed Apples for dessert. Chef Junior and I spiced it up a bit with walnuts, coconut, and vanilla thrown into the mixture. I also added a bit more brown sugar to taste. Yum! Would have loved to add either vanilla ice cream or top this off with homemade whip cream. A reason to make this again! And for the record no snow accumulated YET this early in New England! But flurries ARE in the forecast for this evening. On the lookout for more hot desserts using fall fruits!

I like to make this recipe for breakfast using the apples my kids won't eat; you know the older ones with the wrinkly skin! I boost it with extra cinnamon and vanilla.  Its wonderful over pancakes with a dollop of whipped cream. Yum!

Yum! Was looking for something a little sweet after dinner one fall evening, and this was it! Had all the ingredients on hand. Cut the recipe in half to make 4 servings... the servings size is kind of small... it is so good, it was more like 2 servings :)

Suggest adding a very small pinch of salt. Brings out the sweetness in the apples.

I scaled this down to four servings for just hubby and I. I didn't change anything else. This would be great for breakfast or dinner, on ice cream or pancakes or as a dinner side dish as I did. Delicious.

We loved this recipe - I serve it with pork chops.   I have made it several times.  I just added a pinch of nutmeg, a dash of salt, 1/4 tsp vanilla.  Next time I might cut the butter in half. So easy and delicious.

This was good.  I was too lazy to peel the apples, so I just left them on.  I kind of eyeballed all the ingredients, because I was weary about all that butter (I'm on a diet), and ended up using only about a tablespoon and a half of blue menu margarine.  I also like my apples a little tart so I cut down on the sugar and added a squeeze of lemon juice.  It took longer for me to boil before they were done, but they turned out great!  Thanks, 356!

Can't tell you how many times I've made this recipe. Soft apples in cinammony sauce - excellent. I usually use about 6 apples and keep the other measurements as is. It makes a perfect side dish with pork. Or breakfast. Or on cheesecake.......

I make this all the time.  I don't use cornstarch though.  Its a great way to use up apples (use any kind) great as a side dish and better over vanilla icecream

This is a recipe I have done off the top of my head and it works.  Neat to see someone has written it down.

I use a cast iron small skillet.  I use up those apples that are going bad or getting soft-but no mealy.  The mealy ones you show give to the animals outside.

I recently had only red delicious and had been disappointed since I wanted to eat them fresh but they were not juicy.  After they sat a round for a good while, I used them up.  I had able 5 read and 1 golden.  I added vinegar to the mix right away and proceeded just as this recipe says.  I cooked them in the morning as I tidied the kitchen.

Seriously takes little effort and makes the house smell good.  Plus you cleaned up all of those rejected dry apples.

My father-in-law said they were really good.  Just add that vinegar to make them sour if you have sweet apples.  And born sugar is the only way to go!

These were really good for homemade sauteed apples.  I was hoping that these would taste like the spiced apples from chili's but I will keep looking.  Overall a good recipe, these would be awesome with ice cream.

This is truely a great reciepe. I made it for breakfast along with pancakes and eggs. I used the green granny smith apples and it made it taste a little sour but next time I think I'll use yellow or red apples. It was real easy to make and I recomend it to all!

This is really good! We added raisins in with the apples and had it on oatmeal for  breakfast. Substituting flour for the corn starch worked out without any problems. I bet it would be good with ice cream too or pretty much any breakfast food.

This is by far my favorite recipe ive gotten off this web-site!!!  I  love it, my family loves it and my friends always want me to make it for large group dinners.  The best though is when there's left over's and you throw them in yogurt the next morning, or in a crepe, or... in just about anything.  I also found that  using FLOUR in substituition of the CORN STARCH works really well.

YUM! YUM! YUM!  This was so good.  I used them on top of Baked Pancake Squares from here and we loved them.  I did use the suggestion from Chikee and threw in some Cinnamon chips.  They were fantastic!  Thanks Jenny, I know I will make these again!

Mine came out like applesauce. For more crunch, I'd skip step one with the butter entirely (it's not needed) and just saute the apples with the spices.

Excellent comfort food. I served it instead of a veggie one night and I don't have any left. I prepped it about 45 min. before I cooked, so I drizzled the Granny Smith slices with some lemon juice to prevent browning and to add a bit of extra tartness to the whole schmear. Fabulous.

AMAZING!!  This was the easiest dessert recipe I have ever made.  I didn't change a thing except add a little dollop of fresh whipped vanilla cream and a tbsp. of granolla on top of each invidiual cup that I served.  It received rave reviews from all who attended my luncheon.  This is the recipe to have when you are in a hurry but want an elegant presentation with fabulous flavors!

These were okay but they taste nothing lije the ones my mother makes. I will have to use her recipe. My son (3) did like them. I think it needs more butter, maybe.

Oh these just RULED! I used granny smith apples and added a splash of Amaretto at the very end (dark rum would have been perfect, but I was out). Served as a side dish to "Pork Chops Modenese" from this site to rave reviews from the fiancee. Thanks for the great recipe, Jenny!

I'm planning to make pancakes tomorrow morning for mother's day and wanted something other than syrup as a glaze, so I decided to try this recipe out - I made 1/4 of the recipe in a small saucepan, and it came out pretty well. They're very much like apple pie filling (which I don't like), nothing out of the ordinary. I used only 3/4 of the sugar, and I still found it a bit too sweet when eaten alone. I tested them out on pancakes, and they were much better that way! Definitely serve this as a sweet glaze.

Delicious!  I used Granny Smith apples that weren't crisp enough to eat out of hand anymore, added 1 tsp of vanilla, and increased the cinnamon to 1 tsp also, and only used 2 tablespoons of butter.  I did need to cook them a bit longer than indicated.  We really enjoyed this recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

This is yummy, and easy enough; just paring/slicing the apples can be a nuisance but I've got a gadget that does that in one fell swoop.

Anyway, great recipe, my kids love it, husband loves it.  I have served it with pancakes or waffles, as well as with roasted pork in place of applesauce.

These are so easy and good. I serve them over pancakes. I have a great Pampered Chef apple peeler that makes it a snap to prepare the apples.Apples slightly cooked this way would make a great pie filler too. I have also used left-overs a filling for coffee cake.

Delicious recipe! Very versatile and easy to play with. I made two batches for three of my new neighbors, used Granny Smith and cut the sugar in half; I felt half a cup was unneeded as they were so sweet! Doubled the cinnamon and added a bit of allspice and lemon juice during the boiling and it gave it such a nice extra flavor! Thank you for this recipe!

I made this recipe this morning as a topping for my Belgium waffles.  I only used 1 T of brown sugar because I do not like really sweet apples.  I also did not use corn starch because I wanted the the liquid with the apples for the waffles.  This was great as a topping.  I will make this recipe Alaine.

I made this and then poured them into a cake pan. Poured a yellow cake mix on top of it and packed it down tight,baked it for 45 min. It turned out very good almost cobbler.

I love this recipe and so did my mom and siblings and yes i will be making it again.
Although I did make some changes it came out great for example a split the recipe in half and after it was completely done i added a few more pinches of cinnamon , and honestly i loved it so if you want a deli sh and simple-ish recipe I totally recommend this one.

Great recipe!  Wonderful,  simple, quick and delicious.  I serve this with waffles to my vacation rental guests who always have praises.  It's better than serving  waffles with syrup.  I cook these with a mix of apples and a little less cornstarch to produce a thinner and more  fluid syrup.  I don't over cook the  apples .  Apples are soft but still firm, and not mushy.  A few added raisins raise the applause meter a notch.

I have been making this for years.  I add cinnamon, nutmeg, and apple pie spice.  there is really no need to use a thickening agent unless you really want to.  I use a combination of apples not just tart ones, but you need to use firm apples not delicious varieties.  a secret ingredient is to use a dash of salt to bring out the flavors.  make a large batch and freeze in small containers.

Very good!  I used my leftovers to make some Apple Turnovers using the directions on this site.  Went well with the Pork Shoulder I made with apple cider, also from this site.

Added a little more butter and bacon (chopped and cooked.  No extra grease) then served on breadcrumbed pork chops.  I also added a little nutmeg too.

Very good and easy to follow. I just felt like it was missing something. I've made these only once with granny smith apples and have yet to try them again. I'd also like to make apple sauce out of them. Sounds like a yummy idea!

Don't understand why there are a few negative comments, unless some just aren't big on sweet flavor.  This would not be as good with no brown sugar at all.  The original recipe is really good, and I do add a little dash of apple pie spice too :)  Great for pancakes, french toast, as a side dish or oatmeal topping too.

Amazingly easy and delicious!  I made this corn and gluten-free with a super easy fix! I substituted Quaker Old-Fashioned Oats for the cornstarch (about 1/2 cup oats  soaked in one cup of water for 5-10 minutes). Wow! I can't wait to make more and stock my freezer.

Great!  I substituted Earth Balance for butter and reduced the sugar (admittedly, I didn't measure, but it was less than 1/2 C).  Used mix of whatever apples I had.  It was delicious!  We ate it as a pancake topping.

This is PERFECT for a quick cobbler/pie filling.  Anyone can make this.  It's delicious and very forgiving!  My husband likes dried cranberries in this recipe, but anything - include rhubarb - will only enhance this already wonderful creation.

I make this dish often but I don't use the cornstarch or water. It really doesn't need it. My church has a roast pork dinner each November and I make this for 250 people.  Everyone loves it! It's a great alternative to applesauce, which can get messy when it's served on one dish with the rest of the meal (roast pork,mashed potatoes, glazed carrots, corn, homemade sauerkraut, bread dressing and gravy.)

These were really good. I was craving something to put on top of my oatmeal and this is what i came across. I used whatever apples I had in the fridge (I think they were gala or fuji) but they came out pretty good. Next time I will try using more tart apples.

Delicious.  Cut the corn starch back to 1.5tsp and added one tsp of vanilla following other suggestions. Used Braeburn apples and this turned out wonderful.  Served it as a side with a spiral sliced ham and au gratin potatoes.  Mmm mmm.

Great recipe, I added a tsp. of vanilla and added a sprinkle of salt to give it a little more depth. I also used the full 2 tsp of cornstarch, contrary to what I read in some other reviews about using less. Turned out wonderfully!

I had some apples that were getting old and I didn't want to waste them, so tried this recipe.  Can't wait for apples to go old again, this recipe was fantastic!!

I've made this recipe twice. The first time something went wrong! I doubled the recipe for a Christmas brunch and added walnuts as other reviewers did. The taste was good but the color was off! Kinda gray & a little unappetizing looking. Nevertheless, people seemed to like them. I had leftovers which I was going to put into crepes the next day.  I opened the container and the color was even worse than the day before...grayish black and ugly!  I tasted them and they were still quite edible so I put them in my crepe which was good because they were covered up! I tried making the recipe again tonight, this time adding a squish of fresh lemon juice while sauteeing the apples in butter. I also omitted the walnuts. SUCCESS! They tasted great and looked amazing too!  I will definitely make them again, WITH the lemon juice! I still would like to try adding the nuts in as I really liked the crunch they gave (plus I LOVE nuts!).  Will try adding the nuts next time with the lemon juice.  Maybe will try pecans or almonds next time, thinking the walnut skins may have contributed to the grayish color?! So glad I tried them again though because I LOVE them!!

It's always the simple recipes that are the standouts and this is no exception. These sauteed apples were fantastic hot over ice cream and somehow amazing the next day, cold, out of the fridge with yogurt. I highly recommend this!

I'm JUST learning how to cook. So naturally I followed this recipe to the "T." The ONLY suggestion I have is maybe not quite as much butter because while eating the apples, a good 40% of what I was tasting was butter. I've used several different kind of apples from Red Delicious to Granny Smith to Fiji and they've all worked just fine! Quick and easy! The left over syrup would definitely be good to save and use on pancakes or vanilla icecream like several have suggested.

I fixed these for my husband.  He thought they were quite sweet and cut a little thin.  Then we went out to eat and he ordered some and made me taste them.  Mine(or these) tasted the same if not better, but mine were just a lot thinner.  Next time, I will just cut them thicker.  Thanks for the recipe!

Loved this!!! I made this today to add on top of waffles, and the boyfriend kept telling me how yummy it was. I definitely scored breakfast points with him (I'm not the greatest when it comes to breakfast). I added a touch of vanilla as well as a 1/2 tsp more of cinnamon and it came out perfect. Thanks for sharing!

Easy delicious side dish for pierogi and sausage dinner.  From others' suggestions, I added 1 t. vanilla, only 1 t. cornstarch and a dash of salt.

I made this for my daughter as part of her breakfast today (as a treat) and she loved it. It was ready really fast (I covered the apples). Since my apples were not tart, I used less sugar. I actually only measured the cornstarch and water. Allspice and golden raisins made it even better. I will make this again.

PERFECT!  I made it just the way it was written and it was just delicious.  It's like the middle of a perfect apple pie.  The syrup it makes is just wonderful (my favorite part!)  I served it with the Make Ahead Breakfast Casserole and Morning Glory muffins from this website - thank you!  I love this website!

This recipe is delicious as written, though I'll admit I didn't measure the cinnamon - I just sprinkled it on. I made half the recipe and served it with pork chops and stuffing.  Quick, easy, delicious!

These were really good, served them with vanilla crepes and cool whip. I added some vanilla extract, as well as a pinch more cinnamon and sugar. Next time I'll try with nutmeg as well. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Perfect recipe! I used Granny Smith apples and am excited to use a slightly sweeter apple source next time. The boyfriend raved about these! :)

Good recipe.  I am used to cooking the apples on low heat for a long time.  I am happy to find a recipe that is MUCH quicker and tastes almost as good.  I made this recipe to use up apples that were about to go bad and they turned out great.

I made these with apples that were getting a bit past their prime and it was still awesome!  I'll bet it's even better with fresher apples.  The only change I made is to double the cinnamon because my family loves it.  I'll be making this again.

Delicious!  The nice thing about them is you can make them as sweet as you like.  My daughter loved them... I make them with a little whipped cream.

Excellent recipe.. Made it as the recipe called..I was making ribs and only had 30 minutes to go when company stopped by, so I needed a filler dish so we had enough food for the company... These were quick easy and done when the ribs were done.. I even had to print the recipe off for the company.. Thank you for sharing this..

Fabulous and simple sauteed apple recipe. I found my sauce to be a little thicker consistency than I would have preferred, so might cut down on cornstarch next time or add a little more liquid. I had a bunch of golden delicious apples I wanted to use up, and they worked just fine in this - though obviously were a lot softer and fell apart more than a granny smith would have! We served this over Mom's Buttermilk Pancakes and it was wonderful together!

These are fabulous with vanilla ice cream!  I used apple juice instead of water, added 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1 tsp vanilla extract, reduced cornstarch to 1 tsp, and increased the cinnamon to 3/4 tsp.  My 11-year-old son helped make this, and he was so proud of the results.

Did not change a thing. Will use this for many things.  This morning I made it to go on waffles and ham.  Tastes like the filling of an apple pie.

I'd give this recipe 100 stars if I could! Its not only delicious, its super easy! I did as others suggested by adding 1 tsp cinn., 1 tsp vanilla and just a dab of nutmeg, only because we love all those ingredients. I made the apples last night to go with Apple Stuffed Pork Chops from this site, and green beans as a vegetable. I let them cook in my electric skillet on "warm" the entire time my pork chops cooked, only to make the apples nice and soft, and the syrup nice and thick. I could definitely eat these by themselves all day long. I have the pickiest 3 yr old son that wont eat anything if he hasn't tried it before. So, I "sneak attacked" him and put some of the syrup on his lips, LOL! After tasting how delicious it was, he devoured a bowlful! I am going to make a triple (or more) batch later this week and serve them on my homemade Belgium waffles, and pancakes. I'm also going to experiment by grinding this up to spread on toast. I'll let you know how it goes! Thanks so much for this easy recipe...it was a hit! It definitely goes into my permanent cookbook.

I've been making sauteed apples my way for awhile now but I've always felt it wasn't the right consistency. Just tried this for movie night and happen to have a bag full off fuji apples and yes yes yes these were perfect! It's a little to sweet for my daughter (which by the way attacked and ate em' fast) so I think next time Im going to use light brown sugar.

I had some apples in the fridge I wanted to use before they got old.  I looked online and found this recipe, and made it just now.  The only change I made was to add the zest of a lemon.  They are fantastic!  The sauce is the perfect consistency, and the apples aren't so soft they fall apart.  I grew up in the South, and these apples would fit right into the cuisine there.  I will be making these again and again.  Thank you!

You can also add a little bit a clove and/or nutmeg.  These are great over pancakes, waffles, and french toast.  My kids like these served over (Pancakes, waffles, or french toast) then a layer of peanut butter, then the sauteed apples.  These are also great to eat plain with a little whipped cream on top.

Simple and delicious! We had them all eaten before I could use them for a topping on anything. I sliced mine pretty thin...quarter of an inch or less. Thanks for the recipe! It had been in my recipe box forever.....

These were very good.  Easy to make, and tasty as a side dish or as a topping.  I definitely prefer a tart apple like Granny Smith to balance the sugar in the recipe.

I grew up eating my Mom's southern "fried apples" using apples, butter, sugar and cinnamon.  I later made my own version using brown sugar instead of white and also adding nutmeg.  This recipe is great!  I doubled this recipe for a 3 lb. bag of apples (about 7 large apples).  I didn't double the water because I wanted to make sure the syrup was thick enough.  I also added 1 tsp. of vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg.  I used Empire apples and the flavor was outstanding!  I serve this as a side dish/dessert when we have pork.  I reserved some this time to serve with waffles I want to make this weekend.  This would be great with ice cream or even recipes calling for apple pie filling.

Very easy recipe to follow--found that it cooked a longer than 7 minutes but not a big deal. The flavor is a perfect blend of sugar & cinnamon, with a touch of richness from the butter. Yum! This recipe would be great to use for any combination of recipes (pancakes, oatmeal, ice cream, dessert-in-itself!). Can't wait to make again! I think I may even try with pears...(one that i cut into and wasn't quite ripe enough would be perfect)

These are awesome. I added 1 tsp ground ginger with the cinnamon and served as a breakfast side. I also made some granola with cranberries, crystallized ginger and pecans and sprinkled it over the top of the apples after serving. Yum!

Mmmm...I'm a fan of apple pie, but only the filling. This hit the spot! I only had Gala apples & had to sub flour for the cornstarch, but it is delish! Sure to be a 5-star recipe when I can make it as written!

This is a great recipe as is. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I am going to make some changes the next time I make this. I am going to sautee the apples for 1 minute longer to make them more tender and I am going to add 1 tsp cornstarch to thicken the sauce a bit. The sauce was a little runny following the instructions in the recipe, and we prefer it to be slightly thicker. The taste overall was really good though. I will definitely make this again.

4 as is- 5 with these changes.  Add vanilla and cloves.  I also used apple cider instead of water to up the apple flavor- yum! =)

These were really good.  The apples came out perfectly cooked and were served with "Grandmother's Pork Chop Dinner" from this site.  A great combo as the sweet balanced out the savory.

I made this as an after dinner treat to go on top of ice cream. I used our MN famous Honeycrisp apples. I crushed a granola bar & sprinkled it on the ice cream then topped it with the apples. My husband LOVED it. My son & his girlfriend had just returned from an upscale ice cream shop and I asked them to try my new dessert. They both said they wished they had tried it before they spent $10 on theirs. The only addition I might try next time is to add some pecans. Otherwise, no need for any changes.

YUM!!! The best thing about Allrecipes is that you can adapt a recipe for the number of servings.  I had bought apples to bake an apple pie and ended up with one leftover apple.  I was trying to figure out what to do with just one apple when I happened upon this recipe (I was looking for a recipe for a friend and this one came up on the first page that opened) - I'm so glad I found it.  I adapted the recipe for two servings (which used the one apple I had) and it turned out great!  I read the other reviews before making it and since I LOVE vanilla flavor, I added a splash of vanilla extract - fabulous!!!  The only bad thing I can say is that I burnt my tongue because I wasn't willing to let the apples cool enough before eating them - they're THAT good!

Best recipe I've found for fried apples. I did scale it down to 4 servings and I think even with the scaled down water I should have cut it down even more (instead of 1/4c maybe 2T) because mine still had a lot of liquid. I added a sprinkle of salt (which could have brought more juice out of the apples making mine liquidy) and pepper when I added the brown sugar. I've found a little salt brings out the sweetness a little more and black pepper just adds a little spice that goes well with fried apples. My family loved them.

We liked this over oatmeal.  Next time I'd add less water and cook the apples covered over low heat for about 10 minutes after all the ingredients are added.

I wanted something to mix into oatmeal, so I cooked these a little longer and broke them up into smaller chunks in the saucepan.  Didn't bother to peel the apples, and I followed other reviewers advice and added a dash of nutmeg and a splash of vanilla.  Made for some very tasty oatmeal.

Do not cut the apples too thin- it will get mushy and will look like an apple sauce. It's nice to see some slices intact for texture and presentation. A perfect side dish for just about anything! Marvelous idea!!!!!

I used my fresh canned pears in light syrup instead of apples, left out the sugar and followed the rest of the recipe. A Very nice side dish.

The family loved these apples!  I would recommend a tart apple to counter the sweetness of the sugar. I did only use 1/4 cup of sugar.  I added a splash of lemon juice since I didn't use tart apples.

This was great!  I did add vanilla and nutmeg and cut the cornstarch in half.  I used this as a crepe filling.  Yummy!

The apples were AWESOME over vanilla ice cream. I followed the advice of some other reviewers and added some vanilla. Can't wait to try them on pancakes!

I made this to go over pancakes, and it was GREAT!  I found out too late that I had no cinnamon, but I had pumpkin pie spice(which is mostly cinnamon I think), so I used that.  Everyone loved these apples. A keeper!

These were good. I would have liked the apples to be a little softer. With all the sugar, I suggest using Granny Smiths.

Thank you so much! I've been looking for something like this for a long time. I love going out to breakfast and having apple-topped pancakes or waffles, especially because I'm allergic to strawberries. So when I found this I was very happy. The very next morning I made this for the rest of my family on top of waffles. Very good!!

I made the recipe exactly as written. I used McIntosh apples. This is so good. I served it with a pork roast but would also be good with ice cream on top or whipped cream. I will be making these often. Great recipe. Some one just posted it would be great on waffles or pancakes, I know what I'm having for breakfast tomorrow!

Brilliant! This recipe was so good, we ate the apples by themselves, no ice cream needed! I substituted 4 teaspoons of all-purpose flour for the cornstarch, as I didn't have any to hand, and I added in the rest of the raisins I had. A really great recipe, thank you!

Really good - family loved these with the Dutch Baby I pancake recipe on this site. I might cook them a little longer next time, so they would be a little more soft.

this was a very good recipe; however, I will definitely cut back on the butter. I used 2 tbsp. of butter and I could really taste it.  I will probably only use 1 tbsp. next time.  If you use sweet apples, I would cut back on the brown sugar.  Other than that my husband and kids really liked this.  They think it would be great on some vanilla ice cream. Thanks

great recipe! I cut the servings down to 2, and used a fuji apple that was too soft too eat. I cut back on the sugar to 1 tbsp brown sugar, to compensate for a sweeter apple.

Very good, quick and easy. I used Splenda brown sugar to bring the carbohydrate count down a little. Then I served over pancakes in which I added a little cinnamon into the batter. A great breakfast.

I made this recipe exactly as it says and it was wonderful.  My family loves "cinnamon apples" and I was disappointed with a baked apple recipe from this site.  This is faster, easier and tastier.  Thanks for sharing.

This is wonderful for pancakes. I used yellow skin apples for the soft texture. This recipe has enough sauce to cover 4 pancakes. I also make two beacon strips for the side to off-set the sweetness. This recipe makes a good and hearty breakfast. Definitely a keeper!

I really enjoyed this recepie. It was not too sweet and very easy. I used this for the ladies from my church at a Saturday brunch. It was a big hit. If you like your apples real sweet had more sugar. I also put a pinch of nutneg. I will use this again.

I've tried to make fried apples for my husband who grew up loving his aunts recipe...yet my prior attempts were not so great. I tried this recipe this morning, and my picky husband loved them! Next time Im going to try them for dessert with a little whipped topping...that seems like it would be just delicious.

I used this as a side dish of a meal of baby red mashed potatoes and baked porkchops.  The apples are just perfect with porkchops.  I used golden delicious apples.  It was delicious.  Thanks for the recipe!

I've made this recipe a couple times and think it's great.  This summer we were up to a full day of water sports.  I didn't want my kids to be on a sugar high so I served  brunch enchiladas and cottage cheese with sauteed apples.   They loved it.

These were really great!  I had to do some substitutions because I was stupid and forgot to check my cupboard before cooking.  I had to use some flour instead or cornstarch and molasses+sugar instead of brown sugar.  I was really worried but they still came out fantastic!

Easy and tasty.  Perfect on top of waffles.  I like to double the brown sugar and cinnamon to make a little more syrup with the apples.

Everyone loved them. Soooooo easy!! My son read the recipe to me and he said it called for 1 1/2 of water, instead of 1/2. It still came out great, with lots of carmelly sweetness!!

Delicious! My daughter and I gobbled these up. We both had them on pancakes, but they are also good on a bagel with cream cheese. I'll be making these again. Next time I'll cut back on the sugar. Still, 5 stars.

I served this at my church.  People ask for it all the time.  I used canned apples instead and no one believes they are canned, I cook them with the main ingrediants, pour them in a metal tray and serve with a granola topping.  It is faboulus... Tanks

Made this last night for dinner with ham slices.  YUMMMYYYYY!  Added some raisins at the last minute, just to soften.  Next time I will use just a little less brown sugar as it was a little sweet.  I also used macintosh apples and they really got soft, like chunky applesauce, but really worked well over the ham slices.  This is a definite keeper.

This is a great recipe. I didn't have vanilla ice cream so I put a little whipped cream on top. It was delicious.

I was looking for a dessert to make one night with some extra apples I had sitting around, so I made this and topped with vanila ice cream.... yum!!! My husband and I loved it. I cut the butter and cornstarch in half. Delish!

This was a good apple side dish for a brunch.  I followed the instructions except adding a little bit of amaretto for a special kick.  I might add less cornstarch if I would make this again because it was a little thick for my taste. I think some other spices such as clove or nutmeg might taste good in addition to the cinnamon as well.

Very tasty. I may not use cornstarch next time as the sauce was a little thick for my taste, but these apples were great with ice cream and on pancakes the next morning!

Syrup was ok, but overall the dish just tasted like apple pie filling. but i did use white instead of brown sugar. The apple type could make or break this one.
To try:  use less butter.  use tart apples, not red delicious!

Good and yummy.  I used 2 apples, 1 TBS of butter, and apple juice concentrate mixed with a little water instead of the water/sugar.  I did use a few small spoonfuls of brown sugar for thickness (omitted the corn starch).  Ate this with a crab dinner- really good.

These were pretty good.  I don't know that I would serve them as a side dish, unless there were other vegetables also.  They're not quite a dessert either.  They warm up well later too.

YUMMMMMM... These are so wonderfully delicious! I love these fried apples. Almost like Cracker Barrel's. Great as a side dish or topping for ice cream, cake, pancakes, or on their own. I've used many different varieties of apple, usually what's on special if I can. I have always just cooked mine longer and haven't needed the corn starch as the sauce thickens as the apples continue to cook and get golden brown. Reheats well (if there is any left!)

Mmmmm!  I had this on top of maple walnut ice cream.  It was delicious.  Kinda like apple pie filling but better.  Next time I make  Apple Enchiladas I will use this instead of pie filling.  Thanks for the recipe.

Used white sugar since that is what I had, still AMAZING. Wonderful over french toast--better than syrup. I cut the apples thicker, covered them and let them simmer a while longer. VERY good.

Just yummy! I used Gala apples and so reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup as suggested. Added a pinch of nutmeg and 1/4 cup raisins. We had it with pork roast but agreed it would be wonderful over ice cream or pancakes as others suggested.

I love the drunken apples from Famous Dave's restaurant. To make this recipe more like Dave's I halfed a lemon, squeezed the juices into the apples as they simmered and even cooked the rind with the apples. Yum yum!

This was very good and I just used the apples I had on hand (gala and fuji).  Will make this with both dinner and breakfast/brunch meals.  Today I mixed some in with my oatmeal and it was very good.  Recommend this recipe!

This is great!  Just like momma used to make!  My spouse does not care for cinnamon, so I omitted it, and it was still superb.  She enjoyed it, but not as much as I did.  The apples can be cooked for a longer or shorter period of time depending on if you want them soft, or a little harder.  Great over pork chops or one can use the recipe as  a side dish.  Thanx again!

THANK YOU for a great recipe that my family loves.  I've made it a few times and it always turns out great.  I've even used different kinds of apples as I haven't always had tart ones.  It still tastes great.  I also add pecan pieces and raisins to it for variety.  It's a keeper!

Try this with brandy poured in when all is almost ready, then light it.(flambe)  Alcohol burns off. Top with whipped cream.
Yum!!

These apples are delicious.  My husband and I love them for an easy dessert or snack.  The hardest (and most time consuming part) of the recipe is the peeling, coring, and slicing of the apples (and it's only time consuming for me since I don't have a gadget that does all that for me).  The recipe is very easy to follow.  I've never tried it with tart apples, but I've had great results with gala apples and with red delicious - neither is too sweet for my tastes (though some may not prefer things as sweet).  I've made this recipe multiple times already and plan on continuing to enjoy it well into the future.  Thank you for a fantastic recipe.

Excellent!  I served it over waffles as suggested and the breakfast was wonderful!  A great break from the traditional syrup.  I have some left over and want to warm it up and serve it over ice cream!

Everyone loved it- I used 2 honeycrisp and 3 golden delicious, added 1 tsp vanilla, and served it over pancakes! I would definitely make it again- people wanted to eat it plain- which is a great compliment for this recipe!

After going to Cracker barrel and trying the fried apples, I decided that I must find a similar recipe, especially since my family went apple picking last weekend,and we have 60 pounds of fresh apples on our back porch. What a great way to use them!
One thing: I used fresh Empire apples, which are a tangier, firmer apple than, say, Golden Delicious. I combined the two for this, and the Golden's cooked up fine, but I would give the Empire some more time, maybe 7 more minutes. Great recipe, even plain!

Really good and so easy!  20 minutes from the time I started cutting the apples to the time we ate them.  I can see needing more of the syruppy part of it depending on what you're combining them with but this recipe is fantastic as is.

I did something different and served these apples with the Swedish Cured Pork Loin (also on Allrecipes) and it was FANTASTIC combination!  These apples were quick and easy to whip up and very versatile, since I served them as a compliment to a dinner, but as other reviewers did they easily can go over ice cream, pancakes, crepes, etc.  Great recipe!

These turned out beautifully and exactly as I expected - the cinnamon syrup-coated apples that I know and love from some of my favorite restaurants. But I found the cooking time to be way too short, perhaps because I used Granny Smith apples - I ended up having to cook them in the syrup for at least 10 minutes, and still they weren't quite softened all the way though. I will try this recipe again with a slightly sweeter and more tender variety.

The family loved it.  I reduced the brown sugar to a 1/4 cup since we only had sweet apples.  I would use only 1 tsp if cornstarch next time.  Everyone loved it.

I reduced the amount of cinnamon to a few hearty shakes, as 1/2 cup is a LOT to us. Be cautious, as you can always add cinnamon later if you want more cinnamon flavor.

SO good! I made this as directed. I've boiled apples plenty of times, but never sauteed. Sauteeing is much better for a topping! I added these to a German pancake and it was delicious!! 

I'd add a picture to the review, but the app keeps freezing.

Depending on what type of Apple are used, I would be careful how much sugar (if any) you use.  I made the recipe with the apple crisp variety and wish I wouldn’t have added any sugar.

Nice way of getting apple pie flavoring that has no crust. Made my husband happy; over vanilla lactose free ice cream- yum!

We just had as is and pretty good, but next time use less sugar.  Did put a little whip cream on to take away from the sweetness. Will try on yogurt, ice cream, pancakes & waffles also.

Absolutely delicious, I substituted apple juice as well for the water and served it hot over French toast  for brunch with my mother. She raved about it as well, and the leftover possibilities as sweet enchiladas, apple crisp with oats or as a glaze with pork, ham and chicken are endless.

It is delicious; family had seconds and thirds.  I added the butter in the pan with the apples and I put water in at that time to help soften the apples.  This side dish is a winner!

Great recipe guidelines for any fruit topping. I didn’t have apples this time so I used raspberries for a waffle topping. I just swapped brown sugar for white. I’d use less water next time as it was a little thin for my liking. Tasted delicious, goin to use leftovers on ice cream!

I made this for a birthday party to go with smoked chicken wings an smoked rope sausage. It went great together even though I overcooked the apples a little. It was more like chunky applesauce. I would definitely recommend.

I’m usually too busy to rate recipes, but for this one I actually created an account just to give this 5 stars. Too easy and very delicious, best carmelized apples I’ve ever had. I halved everything since I was making it for myself as a late night snack over vanilla bean ice cream. After it was finished cooking I decided to pour it into the bottom of the bowl and Scooped the ice cream on top! Apples were tender and sweet and the sauce was the perfect consistency - sweet and savory. Thank you for this recipe!

I made this dish to accompany homemade chicken pot pie. I used Granny Smith apples and tripled the cinnamon because my husband really likes cinnamon. This recipe tastes exactly like Stouffer's Escalloped Apples :-)

Followed recipe but did increase the 1/2 tsp. cinnamon to 1 tsp.  It turned out great and definitely will make it again.  Liked that I could prep it early in pm and then just reheat for our dinner.

Super easy and super tasty! I chose to use less brown sugar, both for health and because both of my daughters like tart apples. This dish made for a nice side dish to a savory main. We enjoyed the left overs warmed up and topped with some homemade granola. Mmmmm! Apple crisp for breakfast!

Made per directions 1st time and it was good but sweeter than we prefer.  2nd time reduced brown sugar to about 2 tbls, added golden raisens and 2tsp vanilla.  Great!

I made this today using up 6 Empire apples. I followed the recipe as written and was delighted with the results. My husband and I ate the entire batch in one sitting right from the frying pan. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I used twice as many apples (8) and kept the other ingredients the same and it was still too sweet. Would recommend cutting brown sugar in half. Good with pork dishes.

Made according to directions, (I peeled the apples) and cooked the apples until soft. My husband has no teeth right now and he had no trouble eating this, and wanted more. It is simple and delicious.

If you make this, be sure to add 1 teaspoon of  lemon juice. Many sweet recipes don't include this although it is actually very important for the taste. If you only put sweet, it will turn bitter. You need a little bit of bitter to make the perfect sweet.

This is so good! I followed the recipe and only a added a dash of fresh nutmeg before turning off the heat. It turns out amazing! Great to eat on its own but I’m wishing I have vanilla ice cream right now??

While this did taste good, I found that the sugar level was too high.  It could be personal taste.  I already had reduced the amount of sugar,  so I ended up steaming another apple (sliced)  in the microwave,  and added that.

Delightful!  Such a great taste.  I used frozen apple slices I had to use up from last year.  Gravenstein, I believe.    I also added a couple handfuls of raisins.  It was delicious, served in a bowl with a scoop of vanilla yogurt.  Great breakfast!

I wanted smaller pieces to top my vanilla ice cream. So I chopped one apple in small pieces and made  the sauce as directed. I like a lot of sauce and it made a perfect amount. SO GOOD on my vanilla ice cream and I will absolutely make these apples again..... because the batch I just made is gone ??

These are great! I make them exactly as it's written. I use them in crepes and the extra on ice cream later. People who complain about too much sugar or butter need to look elsewhere for a more healthy option cause these are perfect

Fantastic and so easy to make! (The hardest part is peeling and coring the apples.) I added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract and used tapioca flour instead of cornstarch because I didn't have any cornstarch. It came  out great and was a big hit with the family.

Quick and easy to make! I made to go on top of pancakes and my husband loved them. I think the only way to make them better is to add a bit of vanilla.

This recipe was easy to follow. Didn’t need a lot of ingredients and best of all...kid friendly. I used whole wheat flour instead of cornstarch because that’s all I had and it still came out fine.  Hate peeling and coring apples though but ...hey...that’s just my hang up.

So good! I loved them! A little sweet for my tastings but still good. I added a bit of vanilla to it. Still so good. I made them for breakfast and just ate them on it’s own.

Pretty good - used Jonagold apples that were a bit old and not as firm as I would have liked, if I were buying apples just for this recipe, maybe Granny Smith would be better. But the apples I had were already sweet so I cut the sugar in half, as well as the butter. The corn starch slurry brings it all together.

I doubled the apples but left the butter the same because I thought it would have too much butter... I think I should have omitted the butter! They taste good initially but leave a slightly greasy taste in your mouth.

The hubby thought it was good, but the flavor wasn't strong enough for me, even with the top-suggested alterations.

Ate with ice cream, and that was no good. I decided I'd rather not have dessert.

May have been the apples, though!

A really nice easy dish . Not to sweet or sour. I added a little lemon juice just out of habit and a handful of yellow raisons. This could  be a light desert with a little Greek yogurt hand some honey dribbled  on top. Also and a mighty nice addition to breakfast as is.

A wonderful recipe. I used sweet apples because that is what I had and found it too sweet for me. I will cut down on the brown sugar. OK I made again with the tart apples and still cut down on the brown sugar and it was just fab. The first time I made them I should have thought to cut the brown sugar down as I was using sweet apples.....dugh The second time I made them I added a little rum to them and it was wonderful over vanilla ice cream.

I used this after I messed up making fried apple rings, so my apples still had the skin and were a little thick, but it still turned out well and I love it! I also didn't have cornstarch, so I used flour and that worked fine. It brings back some really good food memories!

So I experimented with a smaller batch and I recommend cooking it for less time since it'll get soft much faster. When I tried a second time knowing that it worked out great!

This was exceptional!  I made a few changes - sugar  and flour were both reduced by half. I added vanilla and ground cloves.  Served over homemade French Toast.  Thank you for posting!

This was so simple to make. The apples came out tender and sweet. I didn't have to change the recipe at all. My family loved it!

I used this recipe with my culinary class and added crushed graham crackers for a nice crunch! They loved it! We called it our deconstructed apple pie. I'll be using this recipe again and again!

I took the suggestions of other reviewers: decreased corn starch to 1 tsp, decreased sugar to 1/4 cup, decreased butter to 2 tbsp, added 1 tsp Vanilla. This was good. Next time instead of using water to mix the cornstarch I may use apple juice. I felt as though the fruit flavors were masked behind the brown sugar and cinnamon. Tastes fine with a fresh waffle and will probably make again for a family breakfast when I have fruit to use before it spoils.

Only thing I would change is to add more cinnamon. My apples must have been watery, so I needed to cook them a bit longer (and I added a bit more butter because of how the water affected the sauce). Super easy, really delicious recipe. I make Chef John's Dutch Baby recipe, bake it in a 9x13 pan and spread the apples over the baked pancake prior to cutting. Delicious!

I've made this so many times I can't even count them. It's fast, easy and all the ingredients are things I have at home. And my granddaughter  loves peeling the apples. Perfect as a  side dish or for putting on top of pancakes or ice cream.

My kids love these! I've made them twice and it takes mine way longer to get tender than what the recipe says. I'm not sure if I'm not cutting them small enough or what. They are still amazing I just have to start them sooner.

This is a very simple recipe. I only used 1 apple, and used flour(3tbsp=1tbsp of cornstarch)instead of cornstarch! This had a lot of flavor! It mad a nice topping for my French toast!

I followed the recipe exactly as written, using Northern Spy apples for the first batch, trying other, tart pie apples after.   I think fresh-eating, sweeter apples would make it too sweet.  This recipe is a sure-fire winner with a multitude of serving possibilities. We've have enjoyed these on Belgian waffles, pancakes and French Toast; alongside pork and venison; tucked into puff pastry, turnovers and mixed in a plain bread pudding; over ice cream or just the apples with a dollop of whipped cream. This recipe has become a 'go-to' family favourite. Thanks so much for sharing!

This recipe was amazing.  My husband was in heaven. However, I used 4 huge apples in a 12 inch skillet and it took me about 20 minutes to cook the apples enough. Half way through I raised my temp to medium high. I think I will put a lid on the skillet next time, as one viewer suggested. That is my only comment, but others may have had a different experience.

I skipped the butter because I use applesauce to replace butter in recipes, so I cooked these just in applesauce. I forgot to add brown sugar but they still tasted good. My 6 yr old didn't think these were great though and she loves apples and applesauce. I guess they tasted like warm apples to her but nothing special.

I made this to put over my homemade waffles.   We loved this recipe.   The only thing I would change is that I would double the sauce because I like a lot of syrup on my waffles.   Otherwise this easy to make recipe is 100% spot on for me.

I've made this several times, and it works well with just about any variety of apple. I actually have used sweet varieties (Fuji and honeycrisp) more often than tart ones.  I've used it to top waffles/pancakes, oatmeal, as crepe filling, and as a topping for pork chops.  It's good as written, but I usually double the nutmeg. I've also added vanilla, and once used just a little coconut rum. This is a keeper, and I'll keep playing with it.

This recipe was quick and easy. I added a little nutmeg with the cinnamon  and a squeez of lemon to the apples right after cutting. Will make again using rum instead of half of the water! These are great on top of oatmeal on a cold morning!

I used geeen Granny Smith apples, which I regretted. My husband and I felt the tartness of the apple threw off the sweetness that was supposed to be there bc of the brown sugar. Won't give up! Next time, regular Red Delicious or Rome apples(I usually use Rome for apple pie).

Yes, I was out of brown sugar, so I used a substitute, regular white granulated sugar for it. It tasted SOOO good! My mother tried them, and she said, "Wow! They don't taste as good as Cracker Barrel, they taste even better!" I loved making them, and I'm sure if I submit them in a contest, they'd win Blue Ribbon, First Prize!

I thought this recipe was great.   Changed a couple of things. Started by adding the water to the apples and let them soften before adding the butter, sugar and cinnamon. I also added some vanilla as suggested by other reviewers. By the time I had added all the ingredients I didn't need the cornstarch.  Next time I will cut the sugar  I rarely have anything with sugar in it and found it to sweet for me. Plan on having it over Greek yogurt.  Thanks for the recipe.

My grandma made these delicious apples when I was growing up. I loved them then, and now I prepare them for my grandsons. We serve these with pork chops, fried chicken, pancakes, breakfast cereal, ice cream, hot bread or biscuits and even bread and butter! If you put some on oatmeal you'll never want it plain again! I highly encourage any cook from novice to experienced to fix these for their family! Yum!

I substituted Splenda Brown Sugar for the regular brown sugar.  I also added hot water because I wanted more juice in the apples.

I made this recipe as written. The apple I used was a Granny Smith. This recipe is very easy to make and quite tasty. The apples were served on top of Fluffy French Toast with a side of Homemade Turkey Breakfast Sausage. (both recipes can be found on this site)  I will definitely be making this meal again. Thanks for sharing.

This recipe was easy and delicious. I used 3/4 stick of butter vs. a full stick, and a tiny bit less brown sugar, because that is all I had on hand. The apples turned out perfect!!

As I'm typing this I am also sitting here eating it! It turned out great and is easy and quick to cook. The only thing different I added is a 1/2 cup of fresh pineapple. I like to shake things up a little and I'm not afraid to add something. Next time I make it though,  I am going to add a crisp topping. I love this kind of recipe. You can add to and make it your own!

Perfection. You can use this for fancy schmancy breakfasts (over pancakes, waffles, in crepes, etc). OR, use this for dessert over some vanilla ice cream. Very versatile, very tasty!

Super simple delicious recipe! I added a bit of nutmeg (Probably around a table spoon) And let it reduce until the liquid was very thick and syrupy, poured it into a bowl of ice cream and it was so good! Definitely going to make this again.

I've served these with roasted pork tenderloin (dice the apples), over ice cream, and on waffles. Every time, guests and my family go crazy for these apples. So easy and tasty.

Delicious!  These are such a quick and super simple way to make some delicious apples to be served on the side or with pancakes, waffles, or dutch babies.  For a little extra sauce it is great to add in a splash of apple cider.  Or for even more indulgence make a brown sugar struesel topping with an icing drizzle to go on top of the apples.  So good and I always go to this recipe for a simple apple topping that can be made in just minutes.  Thank you for the recipe!

I just made this to go with pork loin. I used  2 galas and 2 macintosh apples. I used only 1 tablespoon brown sugar, and it was sweet enough.  It was delicious and not too sweet. I could probably skip the sugar if I use sweet apples again. I will definitely make again!

These are yummy. My house smells like fresh baked apple pie. I didn't have cornstarch, so that was omitted, otherwise, I made it as written. Very good. I think next time, I'd cook them a bit longer as I like a softer texture.

I've made this recipe many times. I started by following it as written, and it was good. My plan was to add a small helping to a bowl of oatmeal for breakfast, which is a much tastier and healthier option than a package of instant apple cinnamon oatmeal.
My changes were to add between 1/8-1/4 of a teaspoon of both nutmeg and clove to the cinnamon and brown sugar mix. It adds so much more flavour.
Add more cornstarch if you want it a little thicker, less if you want more of a thin sauce.

I loved this recipe!  I followed it exactly except one thing. I knew I'd prefer Granny Smith Apples, but have sweet mellow ones instead.  I squeezed lime juice onto the apples as I sliced them, and a little extra of the just when I put them in the pan.  Just enough tartness!  Will definitely cook again!

Made this tonight and my family loved it.  I used McIntosh and Honey Crisp because that is what I had on hand and cut back the sugar a little to compensate the sweetness of the apples.  It was delicious.

MMMM! This was a great way to use a bag of apples that was slowly finding its way to the back of the fridge in the "Eh, no" area. I used about 6 small apples as I was trying to get rid of them, and used 3 teaspoons of cornstarch dissolved in 1/2 cup of water to get that thick syrupy finish. I set the final product atop a hot bowl of steel cut oatmeal for breakfast and it was AMAZING. It's a great alternative to the store bought apple products that are filled with sugar and don't have that fresh or tart taste. Thank you for the recipe!

I was looking for a recipe to make apples that could go over our breakfast pancakes...this recipe was perfect.  I made the spiced Maple Pancakes also on this site.  I made the recipe as written, didn't change a thing.  The sauce that held the apples together was just right.  I will make this again. I  can see where this recipe could star in many other ways...over ice cream, as a pie filling, over waffles, etc.

I only made one apple's worth to add to plain oatmeal. I was trying to recreate a healthier breakfast apple crisp than actually eating last night's apple crisp. I made it exactly without adding the vanilla, but it was very good, even though added to oatmeal. I think the fat of the butter really contributed to the deliciousness. Not an every day food, but a good treat.

Followed recipe exact except for adding 1 tsp vanilla extract. Definitely better than Cracker Barrel's apples. I did use 2 huge honeycrisp apples. May add chopped pecans for a real treat. Loved it! Will make again. Thanks for sharing:)

Love the recipe, but I did some changes. I omitted the butter; not needed. I sprayed the apples with some I can't believe it's not butter spray. My family loved it. Definitely will be making again.

This recipe was amazing! I had only gala apples on hand, which were getting a little mealy, but they still turned out very tasty! I didn't change a thing, it's simple and delicious as is!

Instead of cinnamon I used half ground ginger and half ground cloves and i added about 2 teaspoons of lemon juice with the butter. I
used this as a topping for french toast.

I thought this recipe needed some improvements such as the ingredients need to be less and the surving size needed to be explained because I made way to much for 1 person.

Yum! My friend made this to go on pancakes. I don't think we put the cornstarch in though. Ours also looked sort of black and gross....I think I'll try this recipe and take some of the suggestions of the other reviewers

I added a little freshly squeezed lemon juice to make the flavor pop and also used apple pie spice instead of cinnamon.  Turned out great.

My family loved these apples over waffles.  I added golden raisins while cooking and vanilla at the end.  Very sweet but delicious.  I may cut the sugar next time.

Super easy and delicious! We were having ham with cheesy broccoli & potato casserole and my husband was suppose to pick up some chunky applesauce to go along with dinner - he forgot. I had some apples so I decided to try this recipe. I didn't have any corn starch or flour on hand so I cut back a bit on the spices and sugar and used a couple of teaspoons of Pumpkin Spice instant pudding mix - it was so tasty! I only gave it 4 stars since I didn't follow the exact recipe. I'll be sure to make this again with the correct ingredients.

These were sooo yummy!  I think the sauce could have been a bit thicker and sticker for my taste, but overall, they were still delicious.

Delicious apples to top pancakes, ice cream or waffles.  The syrup created by the water/cornstarch mixture is excellent.  It can be done with any kind of apples.  Some ginger also adds a nice touch.

I made the recipe exactly as written. It was super good on pancakes! Next time I will probably cut the brown sugar somewhat, but that is a personal preference. We will definitely make this again.

I made half the recipe and added vanilla and nutmeg as others suggested.  I used the apples we picked which were green but can't say which is which since all the apples were mixed in the bag.  It was sooooooooo good.  Plus, it made the house smells great, too!

I made this for my apple-loving hubby.  I added LOTS more cinnamon (I didn't measure, just judged the amount by the color), 1/2 tsp vanilla, and 1/2 cup chopped walnuts.  He ate it on his multi-grain hot cereal for breakfast, and pronounced it "wonderful".  I just used the apples we had on hand-I don't know what variety they were.  This will be enjoyed over and over at our house!

Easy and delicious!  Made it as directed but had to use half dark brown sugar because I ran out of the light stuff.   We ate them with some ice cream.

I loooooooove this recipe!!!! I did it with the original recipe and didn't change anything. It was perfect and uncooked it as a surprise for my parents when they came home from work and they loved it too! I highly recommend this simple recipe to anyone, no matter how old. I'm only twelve and I had no problems with it at all!

I make this recipe for breakfast many mornings and put on oatmeal. I also add 1 tsp of vanilla as a tweak. I put steel cut oatmeal in the breakfast bowl, add some sauteed apple mixture and drench it with some nice cold milk. Not that 2% stuff either, that stuff reminds me of what was left after we washed out the milkers on the farm.

I make this, but never add water or cornstarch,  liquid will evaporate as you sautée. Also, I ALWAYS throw in a handful of raisins or craisins when cooking.

True, butter and sugar are not necessary to make an apple saute topping. But, when my teenagers try to eat at Family Donut for a weekend breakfast, this recipe entices them to stay home and eat breakfast from scratch. I pair this recipe with Buttermilk Oatmeal Pancakes http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Buttermilk-Oatmeal-Pancakes/

Excellent addition to breakfast and wonderful over pancakes. I cut the brown sugar by half and it was plenty sweet. I must admit I did not have tart apples on hand, so perhaps the 1/4 cup brown sugar would be right for tart apples. I added walnuts, because I love walnuts. Next time I'll try it with vanilla as recommended. Wonderful recipe. Delicious and simple.

I made these using grannys apples, and added raisins.  These are fabulous.  I made baked oatmeal, and the remainder went into a pound cake recipe I found on this site.  You can use these for many recipes.  Kudos to you.

Follow the recipe exactly!  It's perfection!  I can eat these over pie, ice cream, with pork, over pancakes or all by themselves. Simple simple simple to make!  Worth every minute spent!

We have these as a side dish every time I make fried pork chops.  Is that just a southern thing?  I noticed so many reviews by people who made this for breakfast, but try it along pork chops or ham as well so you can see how versatile it is.  Whatever you would serve applesauce with, try this for a nice change.

Thank you for sharing this recipe, Jenny. I just love it!! I scaled the recipe down to o only two servings, and made it for breakfast this morning. My husband and I loved it! I added a little more cinamon than the recipe calls for, because we love it. I also added powdered sugar since I was out of borown sugar. It turned out wonderfully, I will definitely be making this again.Allison

Perfect! This was the recipe I remembered from camp, making this over the fireplace. Since I was mysteriously out of brown, I made due with white sugar and extra cinnamon.

We used three large Granny Smith and two small Honeycrisp apples. Also, we were out of cornstarch so I used two Tbsp of tapioca soaked for 5 minutes in the 1/2 c water.  Our aunt who happens to be an excellent cook loved these apples. Excellent side for roast pork with sauerkraut on New Years Day.

I tried this for our Christmas ham.  I don't like Granny Smith apples, so I used Fuji and Red Delicious.  I thought it was going to be too sweet, but it wasn't. I actually could've stood it a little sweeter, but everyone loved it, said it was perfect.  I added a little nutmeg, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I cooked the apples a little longer to be soft, and got rave reviews.  This was the prefect complimnet dish.  Will make again for pork chops! I read the other reviews and started out using half the cornstarch, but end up using the amount the recipe called for to get the right thickness.  I also doubled the recipe for 13 people.

Very good.  I was making breakfast for dinner and wanted something different.  We made this (although I didn't really measure much except the water) to go along with ham and eggs and bread.  I put it on top of my ham, and it was very good.  I think this would be very good in/on a crepe.

I like the way it turned out, but I adapted it (like many other users). First of all, I accidentally used sweet apples--because I got confused about which ones were tart. :) Because of this, I used about half the amount of brown sugar called for. I also used a little less butter, about 50% more cinnamon than called for, and added 1 tsp. of vanilla per 1 recipe. Yum! Next time, I'll try to use tart apples and see how that turns out.

This was super easy and made the house smell so good! We ate over homemade buttermilk waffles! So yummy! Cant wait to make again and eat over vanilla ice cream!

EDIT: I've also done this in the crock pot and it turned out great!~

Love this recipe. I added 1/8 cup raisins. 1/4 cup coconut.  1/2 tsp of vanilla and 1/2 tsp of lemon extract (I added it on top of an apple bread recipe I got from Karla in this website.)

This is a great Thanksgiving side dish.  I did use cornstarch not flour since stepdaughter, son in law and wife are gluten free and cut apples a bit thicker. Doubled recipe hoping some would be left for pancakes the next day; not much!

This was okay. I thought the apples turned out good, but the rest was a bit bland I thought. I think next time I make it I will use more cinnamon and add ginger and nutmeg. My step daughter really liked it but really I was just indifferent.

Family LOVED these APPLES!  I sort of followed the recipe, however; I used a mix of Gala, Granny Smith, and Honey Crisp Apples using 6 apples in total.  I only used a 1/4 cup of water and a 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  Lastly, I added 1/8+ tsp of  Nutmeg.  

This made for a perfect dish that everyone enjoyed!  This will be a new forever recipe!  Thanks for sharing!!!

These are simple and delicious.  You can eat them as is, but they would be fabulous in a crumble with some ice cream over the top.  My husband said it tasted like apple pie filling.  He's right.  Yum!!!

Great way to doctor up some apples that were mealy and not so sweet. Like others said, the plan was to serve them with crepes, but we couldn't wait for the crepes. Yum!

Great recipe as is.  No need to put in vanilla like some other reviews state.  The only thing I changed was the amount of cornstarch... I used only one teaspoon.

I liked it but it was a bit too sweet for my taste and I love sweets...I think I will reduce the sugar and just use water with out the butter. Thank You for the Recipe!

I make a variation of this all the time, though we have always called it fried apples. I don't use as much butter, then add just enough water to create a bit of sauce, no cornstarch at all, great with pork and chicken.

Loved it - added it to the top of pancakes.  Next time I will increase amount of "liquid" of the apples and omit syrup on pancakes.

These taste like Cracker Barrels apples! My family and I loved them. I cut back the sugar to 2 TBSP because I used red apples instead of green. Wonderful recipe. I will be using again!

Pretty good.  I also added about 1 tsp of vanilla.  Next time i will try without corn starch and just get the thickness of the syrup by boiling and reducing.

Outstanding! My family loved it and the recipe is simple. As mentioned in some of the reviews I added a couple of drops of vanilla. As a side dish, a dessert or a breakfast topping this a keeper.

Flavors were good.  Next time, I will cook them for a few more minutes to make them more tender.  Served this with the Cinnamon Belgian Waffles recipe from this site (and alot of whipped cream, of course!).

WOW! This was great with a few tweeks.  I have lots of pears and my husband and I were getting tired of eating them plain.  I used 5 pears and reduced the butter to 2 TBSP and the sugar to 3 TBSP as one reviewer said the butter and sugar didn't add anything to it and I think that idea was right on.  Next time I would omit the butter and add 2TBSP of the sugar.

I reduced the water to 1/3 c because the pears were juicy. I also added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and 1/8 tsp of ginger and this really improved the spice balance.

I plan to make again using apples with spices and water amount as is, no butter and 3 TBSP of sugar.

I use this recipe as my base. 1/4 c of butter is 2 oz, which is roughly a half a stick of butter, and add into the entire mix about a half cup of dried cranberries and top it all off after it is done with some redi-whip (not cool whip, rediwhip is the real thing, cool whip is not.) It is soooooo delicious!

Just made this mornng as a topper for a simple mashed microwave banana/egg pancake. I halved the recipe for two of us; and like other suggestions I used less butter and softened the apples with water and added vanilla to the sugar mixture at the end. Will definately make again!

Very yummy.  The best sauteed apples I've ever had.  I served these with dinner.  I went ahead and added the vanilla and nutmeg as others had suggested but I think it still would have been great without.

I followed the recipe exactly (which hardly ever happens!) and it was sooooo good, I can't believe I made it!  The prep time is a lot longer than 5 minutes though if you count the preparation of the apples, but it was still fast and easy!

I doubled this recipe and brought it to a potluck.  I felt that it could have used less butter (maybe 3/8 c.).  Next time, I will divide the butter in half and used one-half non-pho margarine to cut down on the richness.  

I halved the cornstarch and added vanilla and nutmeg as others had suggested but felt like it was still missing something.  That "something" was salt.  Add just a couple dashes of salt, and it's perfect!  Everyone loved it, and I will be making this again!

Very good and simple! I made this as a french toast topping for me and my 4yr old son today for breakfast!We both loved it! The only change I made was to use a small bit of corn syrup instead of of the cornstarch, (so also no water added)because I had no cornstarch... turned out still fantastic!! :) Thanks for sharing!

Very good, but pretty sweet. I can see how it would be great over pancakes, but it's a bit much on it's own. I added raisins and walnuts- a great addition!

I added pure vanilla extract and some nutmeg as others suggested. I added in the corn starch at the very end to thicken up the syrup as needed. I didn't measure how much cornstarch I used. Overall I thought it came out wonderful! Very tasty. I made this prior to using it so I hope it will be just as good when I re-heat it.

These turned out fantastic.  Being diabetic I substituted the brown sugar with 1/4 cup artificial sweetener.  By itself it was excellent, but put on top of some low fat ice cream was amazing.

Okay, I'm posting here because of my troubles with finally getting around to this recipe.

I've made apples this way before, and they turned out good. But I usually never have the ingredients on hand at my house. So here's to all the people with the same predicament, from a freshman.....

If you dont have any spices on hand, I use a simple recipe that creates decadent, gorgeous soft apples.

You will need: Apples (cored and cut up), butter (to cover a pan), sugar, and a squeezable lemon juice.

Cut the apples. Put a round skillet over low heat. Butter it when hot. Throw the apples in and saute. Occasionally sift white sugar onto the apples evenly with a spoon, saute more, and squeeze a hint of lemon juice on them. Theyre ready when a fork doesnt push through them, but makes a dent. Delicious.

My daughter had tried sauteed apples at a relatives and didn't like them.  She loved this recipe.  I used translucent apples that we had picked from a next door neighbor.  Sweet with a little bit of tang.  We really enjoyed this recipe.

I used 4 large breaburns (cored and sliced in the food processor), as that's what I had on hand.  Because my apples weren't tart, I only used 1/3 cup brown sugar.  This was wonderful alone, and delicious on Fluffy Pancakes (from this site).  "This tastes like apple pie filling!"  was one daughter's comment.  I'll definately be making these again.

Wonderful recipe that does remind me of the Boston Market apples! My ingredient modifications included dissolving cornstarch in apple cider instead of water, increasing the amount of cinnamon, and adding a touch of allspice and nutmeg. I also threw a few peach slices in the pot and it's a delicious addition; I'm secretly hoping my husband doesn't want any (he doesn't like apples) so I can go finish the pot. The next time I make this, I will decrease the cornstarch (as I had to add water while it was cooking), not use as much cinnamon and stick to the recipe, and increase the nutmeg (because I love it). I cooked on medium-low because I only used one apple and a few peach slices---even if I make the original 8 serving recipe, I would still recommend low heat and more time. Finally, because I didn't have tart apples, I splashed some lemon juice onto the apple slices, which also preventing browning, as I was cooking other things and needed to let them sit for a little. Thanks again for a fab recipe---it's a keeper! Delicious w/my breakfast, which included scrambled eggs w/beef smoked sausage.

My husband came home with a bunch of apples from the cider mill, I was looking for something quick to do with them.  I 'm not sure what kind of apples they were, but they were a softer apple, so I only cooked them for 4 minutes, I wanted more sauce so I doubled it but still used 1/4c butter.  I will definitely makes them again, they came out great!!!!!!!

This is a great & simple recipe. I've made it with peeled apples, unpeeled, and various apple varieties, as well as with dark brown sugar. Every variation, plus the original recipe, have been perfectly delicious.

This recipe makes for some delicious and very pretty looking apples.  I used gala apples because that was what I had on hand and followed the recipe, resulting in soft and sweet apples that smelled as good as they tasted.  Thanks for the recipe!

It was delicious, but a the sauce gelled a little on me when it cooled, So I slowly stirred in a little bit of water at a time until it was the right thickness, killer with french toast, and a bit of whipped cream

SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD!!! What  more can I say? I used two Granny Smith apples, low fat margarine, BS Splenda, and doubled the water and cornstarch. Served this overtop steel cut oats and was delicious. This is a great super easy recipe. I'm curious to see what would happen if I omitted the spice and tried it with different fruit?? Thanx so much for sharing. Def going to the "kepper" box:)

These were delicious! A big hit with my family. however I would suggest adding 4-5 teaspoons of cornstarch if you don't want the sauce too runny

These apples were very tasty.  I served them as a side dish with a pork butt roast.  I added a pinch of salt as someone else suggested and was glad that I did.  I also added a little more water so that I would have more sauce. I will make this again.

I followed the recipe exactly and these came out perfectly. I served them as a side dish to pulled pork sandwiches and corn on the cob and it complimented the meal nicely.  I have no doubt that as a topping to ice cream or pancakes or crepes that they would be just as divine!

OH MY GOODNESS!!!!  These are to die for.  I served these this morning on Waffles I from this site, by Oneshyofabunch.  What a way to start the weekend.  I cannot begin to tell you how delicious these are.  Looking forward to trying these as a side dish to pork chops, any roast for that matter. This sure is a keeper.  Thank you, thank you, thank you 356!

These are great! The only change I make is to cut the butter in half to cut down on fat. I've served them over pancakes, waffles and a couple of times just by themselves as a breakfast side. Everybody always loves them.

I made this with my daughter and she didn't really care for them.  However, my mother loved them!  They were a bit rich though.  I served them over vanilla bean ice cream and added a little more cinnamon too.  Personally, I LOVED THEM.  Thanks for sharing!

I chose this recipe because I wanted more of a restaurant style cooked apples, and was not disappointed.  The reason I'm not giving this the full 5 stars is because I had to double the amount of sugar and cinnamon.  My apples did seem a little overly tart though, so the need for more sugar may have had more to do with the apples than the recipe.      Loved them!

Very good.  Used Granny Smith apples and it turned out nicely.  Next time, will use these over pancakes.

This was great!   I left the peels on the apples and it turned out really well.  Had to cook it a little longer, but the flavor of the apple was excellent.  Awesome over ice cream!

Yum!  I like apples, but don't always like eating them plain.  The sauce is great in this recipe, and I like to use different types of apples to change it up a bit sometimes - I like granny smith apples when I want it a bit tart, or golden delicious when I like it a bit sweeter.

YUM.  YUM.  :)  We loved this!  Found we didn't need much water and increased the cinnamon due to personal preference.  Will make as a regular side-dish or served over ice cream for dessert.  Thanks 356!

Perfect over waffles!  My husband loved it.  Would not change a thing about the recipe.  I did it with a mixture of honeycrisp apples and pink ladies.

This is so simple to make, and so good.  I make this for breakfast most weekend mornings, with eggs, sausage, and hashbrowns.  My kids love them.  When you make these minus the corn starch (but keep the water in), it makes a pretty good topping for ice cream - as long as you get it to the ice cream before is turns into candy in the pan.  Thanks for sharing!

This was amazing!! I cut this recipe in half to serve three peple and everyone loved it. I accidently added more cinnamon than called for, but it was still great. We had it served over vanilla ice cream and it tasted like apple pie filling except better. This is definatly a keeper cant wait to make this again. One thing though, be careful not to slice the apples too thin... I made mine thicker than 1/4 inch

These were wonderful! Definetly add vanilla and use granny smith apples.  We ate it just as is. Great if needs to be reheated, too, although we usually don't have any left to reheat!

These are fantastic and easy. Made them the night before my bbq at the last minute after reading reviews. Served with BBQ Pork for Sandwiches on slider rolls, Sweet Restaurant Slaw, Baked Beans Texas Ranger, (all from this site) as well as Mac n Cheese (not from this site but Allie's is delish if you are looking for a good one!). They were a huge hit and reheated in the microwave beautifully. Had the leftovers this morning with buckwheat pancakes. I recommend making them the night before. Also added a tsp of vanilla as I used very tart apples and felt like they needed some extra sweetness. Great all around recipe to keep in your line up.

Awesome!  I used the full amount of sugar as my apples were very tart, but could probably cut the amount with equally delicious results.  We couldn't get enough of these!

Very good - even for leftovers.  Definitely use tart, crisp apples.  I made with the "BBQ Pork for Sandwiches" and box mac'n'cheese.  Great southern meal.

This was wonderful!!!!!! I have tried several recipes trying to duplicate Cracker Barrel's recipe and been unsuccessful; this was even better than theirs!  I used Gala and Jonagold apples and they stayed just enough firm to cook to a perfect doneness.

I will be making this again and again. It was delicious. I used honeycrisp apples (my fav) and it turned out wonderfully. I forgot to add vanilla but have not missed it so far. I used 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar and also added a pinch of salt and about 1/4 tsp. of allspice, which rounded things out nicely. I'm definitely going to try these on pancakes, vanilla ice cream, and maybe even as a side dish at Thanksgiving! Thanks so much for sharing an amazing recipe.

Possibly one of the most delicious thing ever. I used pumpkin pie spice in place of the cinnamon because I love the extra flavor. While cooking it smelled like autumn in a pan! Definitely will be making this again to eat over pancakes!

This was really good -- i made it to got in my oatmeal, and i wish i'd just skipped the oatmeal and gone with the apples straight. One thing: make sure you cut the apples thin enough, mine were thicker than 1/4 inch and took a lot longer to get tender.

My grandmother used to make "fried apples" as part of her huge buffet breakfasts everytime I went to visit her in KY (such a fond memory) and they were the best thing I had ever eaten. Until now I had no idea how to offer this to my family short of opening a can of pie filling and throwing in a skillet! Thanks sooo much for putting me back in touch with some of "My old Kentucky home". Cant wait to get my family hooked on these!

***Update---decided to make these for my brothers for Thanksgiving, just wanted to note that simmering in butter is an important step, I had to make mine in two batches, and forgot to simmer the second set...took forever to get soft. Aside from that though, awesome recipe!!! PS May want to adjust cornstarch to adjust thickness depending on apples used, I used Gala cuz thats what was here...also plan on freezing these until I need them, will let you all know how well that turns out...I sure do hope they freeze nicely.

I am eating this now as we speak. I used less butter to cut down on the calories and added some ginger. I used half tart apples and half sweet honeycrisp apples. I like the sweet apples better. I agree that toasted pecans might make this amazing. Will use on oatmeal in the morning for a healthy breakfast!

This was good.  I left the peel on so I could increase my fiber intake and I could barely notice it.  I think more syrup was necessary.  I noticed that the water/cornstarch mixture evaporated from teh pan almost immediately so it was hard to stir in the cinnamon and brown sugar.

I was looking for a side dish instead of a dessert or pancakes topper, so I cut the brown sugar in half.  I used Granny Smith apples and left the skin on (by accident) and it was really good.  I only gave it 4 stars because I changed it slightly.

I thought this tasted very good. A few tips, however: 1) I don't think the cornstarch is necessary. 2) I cut the recipe down to 2 servings because I only have myself and my husband to feed and I was using it as a waffle topping because I was out of syrup. I used 1 apple (red delicious sliced thicker and not sauted as long worked wonderfully) but the sauce was pretty much non-existant. it covered the apples but there wasn't anything left so I concocted the sauce without the apples to have more syrup. worked well. 3) I tried one reviewer's idea and added nutmeg and vanilla. The vanilla was a good addition but I didn't really care for the nutmeg. It didn't ruin the recipe, but it didn't add anything to it either and it smelled funny. I think the recipe is great tasting as is but if you decrease the number of apples, you still need to keep the same amount of sauce or you just have flavored apples, no sauce. remember, if you use a softer apple, just decrease the sautee time to a minute or two instead of 6 minutes. You just have to get them warm because they're already soft. PS. Anyone who thought this recipe was disgusting must have done something wrong. I don't think I would eat it by itself, though, use as a topping for something. But it is definately NOT disgusting. My husband gave it five stars, too.

Excellent Recipe!  I made this as a pancake topping and it was perfect!  I am going to buy some vanilla ice cream to use up the remainder later today!  Next time I might try using some nutmeg or apple pie spices instead of some of the cinnamon to see if it brightens the flavors.

This was excellent and simple to make - I threw in a handful of blueberries because I had some on hand and reduced the cornstarch to 1 tsp, added extrac cinn. and a 1/2 tsp of nutmeg as others recommended. We also cut pie crust into triangles sprinkled with cinn & sugar and baked at 400 degrees. We served over vanilla ice cream and decorated with "pie crust cookies"...next time I will use less brown sugar as it was a tad too sweet when combined with the ice cream

I made this for a dessert to serve my mother and one of her friends. We also added pecans and served it with vanilla ice cream. I definitely plan to make it frequently. It's not as heavy as making something with a starchy crust. (I cut the apples (sprinkled with lemon juice) and measured the dry ingredients before I went to my mother's apartment.) Dessert was ready by the time we finished cleaning up the dinner dishes.

Love, love, love.  I do not like maple syrup on pancakes so I made these to go along with "Good Old Fashioned Pancakes" recipe and it was excellent.  Will be making again.  I added a little bit more cinnamon for my personal taste and next time I will be adding a bit more cornstarch to thicken up.

Just Yummy. I love nutmeg, I might add a dash next time, or yummy cloves. My boyfriend made this over breakfast oatmeal.

So delicious and so easy! I cut the recipe in half for two Granny Smith apples, and it came out perfectly. A delicious side dish!

These were alright.  They reminded me of an apple pie from Micky D's without the crust, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  I might mess with the recipe, and see what happens.

Yum!!  I tried it once leaving the peels on and it wasn't bad, but better without the peels.  I made these twice when we had company and they loved it.  So easy to make too.

I've made these at least 10 times and they are amazing.

I follow the recipe exactly, and put them on top of waffles, pancakes, or pack them with my lunch.

My family loves this recipe.

I followed the original recipe and served them on top of grilled pork chops for dinner (instead of apple sauce). Everyone really liked it. Next time, I use this recipe, I'll add a little more brown sugar and some vanilla and serve it with ice cream for dessert. Delicious!

These are DEVILISH! To make myself feel a bit less guilty, here's my changes:  A bit less butter.  4 McIntosh Apples.  A shot of vanilla. Skipped the water / cornstarch gig.  6 tbs brown sugar.  And, oodles of Penzey's Apple Pie spice and nutmeg.   Eight servings?  That can't be right or I'm a bigger pig than I thought!  Me & one other person took down all of them!

These were amazing!! Followed the recipe exactly and did not have to make any sort of adjustments at all. I will be making this time and time again! I served it on ice cream, but will definitely be trying it out on some things others have suggested. Thanks!!

These were so tasty and easy to make (even for me, who is kitchen-challenged).  I served them with pork chops and green beans, but I agree with the other reviews that they would be great as a breakfast topping as well.  Only addition I made was to add about 1/4 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice.

I have used this recipe a few times now.. And everyone here absolutely loves them!! They are very easy to make and they are a definite crowd pleaser!! I personally like sweeter apples so I use red delicious instead of tart and I've found that it takes a little more than 6-7 minutes to get them tender enough for us... But all in all a GREAT recipe!!

OH MY GOSH!!!  These were FANTASTIC!!!  We ate them right from the pan but they would be great on pancakes or with ice cream. I added a bit more cinnamon and cornstarch.  I put up one jar canned to see how they come out.  My 4-yr-old daughter won't stop telling me how great they were and keeps calling me the BEST mom!

Delicious!  I made individual Dutch Babies II from this site and filled them with these apples dusted with a little powdered sugar and they were awesome.  I followed others suggestions and added a little vanilla and nutmeg.  These could be used for a variety of things -apple crisp, ice cream topping, pancake topping!!!  Easy and tasty!

I'm giving this 5 stars because that's what my kids think about this.  I like it just fine, but they love it.  I cook the apples until they are soft for my 16-month-old twins. I also add a bit of nutmeg.  Good stuff.

Yummy and very easy to make.  I used them in crepes but they would be good on top of anything to do with breakfast (pancakes, waffles etc.).  I added more cinnamon (it's my favourite spice) but otherwise kept the recipe the same.

Holy cow!  These apples are awesome.  I made this for one and didn't measure anything.  I tried to only use a tiny bit of butter.  I didn't have flour or cornstarch, but it still came out great.  I'll definitely make this again because it's quick, simple, and much lower in fat and calories than apple crisp or apple pie.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.

These were fine sauteed apples, nothing outstanding and awe worthy, but very good. We added dried cranberries to the last half of the batch. That was a good addition, again, nothing "wow."

These were amazing. I served them over apple pancakes, but the sauteed apples were what kept getting all the compliments. I couldn't believe how easy they were to make either. This is one of those recipes where perfection doesn't matter all that much. If I could, I would give these 10 stars!

Absolutely yummy.  I have served it with roasted pork.  It would be delicious over ice cream. The brown sugar could be cut down slightly if you prefer it not so sweet.  It's great however.

These apples tasted even better than I thought they would, better than apple pie!  I have a lot of Jonagold apples to use up, and remembered this recipe.  I halved it but used the full amount of cinnamon.  Next time I'm going to leave out the butter.  I made fry bread (thawed Rhodes rolls rolled out very thin and then fried in a little butter) to go with  the apples and it made a great breakfast on a day when the temperature is -30.  Thanks!

The apples were even better than I expected. My apples were sweet so I only used a 1/4 cup of sugar. My family loved them. I served them with pork roast and it was a perfect meal.

This tastes delicious when cooled and served over individual slices of Chantals cheesecake, also from this site.  Chop the apples into smaller chunks rather than slices.  It just looks better on top of the cheesecake.

absolutely simple and delicious!
I made this as a simple side with some pork chops, and MAN! It was gone so fast!
I used honeycrisp apples (hard to find if they aren't in season). You can also add just a touch of cream and vanilla to this recipe to give it that extra umph! YUM!

This was a little liquidy, per other ppls suggestions and not so caramel-y as i was hoping for. Next tim I will make it to a T as the recipe calls for and hopefully it turns out more to my expectations.

What a great and easy recipe!  I was making the Skillet Pork Chops and Onions recipe (also from this website), and was looking for an apple side dish to go with them.  I'm sure glad I tried this one!  It was very easy and won rave reviews from my family!  It would definitely make a great topping for pancakes or ice cream as well.  I definitely will be making this again!

These apples were amazing!  I used the same variety of apples that I use in apple pie (Granny Smith, McIntosh, and Fuji).  I used my apple peeler/slicer to speed the prep. process.  My family tries to cut back on sugar, so I reduced the brown sugar to 1/4 cup and exchanged 1/4 cup of the water for apple cider.  It had the perfect balance of sweetness and flavor. Also added a pinch of nutmeg.  Wonderful topping for pancakes!

These apples tasted wonderful and the recipe was wonderfully easy.  I'm no chef, and these still turned out perfectly.  Delicious spooned in my breakfast oatmeal or a sweet cinnamon-y topping for pancakes...if you don't "taste" them all yourself first!  Thanks for the recipe.

Mmmmmm, mmm!  I was out of brown sugar so I used granulated sugar and a 1/4 cup of real maple syrup.  Very yummy, saved the juices to put over pancakes in the morning!

This was just okay.  I thought there was too much cornstarch (mine got thick and clumpy fast.)  So I added more water than called for to thin it out.  I served it over waffles and it really overpowered the waffles.  It's much more like a pie filling than a saucy apple preparation.

These were very yummy and very easy. I made as a side with homemade chicken nuggets and every gobbled it up. The next morning, I made pancakes and put the leftover apples on top and they were great! Didn't need syrup. The only thing, I think next time I won't add the full amount of sugar. Great fall recipe.

Thanks, Jenny, for submitting this recipe.  I have been looking for a recipe like this for so long.  My daughter loves the scalloped apples at Cracker Barrel, and these are just like them.  She had three helpings last night!

I'm sixteen and a half and just got into cooking. It was never really my thing. When I was reading up on this I really had to try it out. It was really awesome and I'm happy it's a very easy thing to make. I'll continue to make from here on out! Thanks!

Made as-is with about 1/4 cup of raisins and a combo of Macoun and Rhode Island Greenings. Perfect.

How could you not like this recipe? My hubby and I were looking for a snack tonight and this was perfect! I served these delectable apples on top of graham crackers. I even thought about adding chocolate like a smore!

wow...just served these over fluffy french toast and it was amazing! I used 4 fuji apples, only a tablespoon of brown sugar (fujis are sweet) and added in a dash of rum....oh my goodness...it was a brunch that seemed more like a healthy dessert and my two kids loved it...my husband doesn't eat sweets and he thought that this was great...

This is everything a 5-star recipe should be: easy, healthy (mostly), and delicious! I did cut back on the cornstarch, sugar, and butter to make it more healthy (I used about 2/3 of the original amount for each one). This recipe is a new staple at my house.

This recipe gets 5 stars for being simple and delicious.  I used Gala apples and Granny Smith since that is what I had on hand.  Served as a pancake topper and everyone loved it!  Thanks for sharing!

Great easy delicious recipe. Already recommending it to friends the next day. We had it over French Vanilla Ice Cream - yum but it was also delicious a few hours later cold. Will be making it real soon!

A perfect autumn side dish for any meal. I made the recipe with the ingredients as listed, and will definitely make the apples again.  I used my apple slicer/corer gadget - so my apples were in wedges instead of 1/4 inch slices.  They looked just like the picture.

This was so easy to make, and delicious! They didn't even last the night, and I made them at 7:30! Definetly a recipe to make again. I added more cinnamon than it called for.

We ate the apples with crepes.  AWESOME!!  When I added the water/cornstarch, I was sure it was too much liquid for the amount of apples, but the sauce is so good when cooked that it was just right.

Mmmmmm Mmmmmm.  These were yummy.  I added about a tbsp of cinnamon, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I served this with "Big Germans" - a pancake like recipe from this site.  A delicious breakfast, raved about by all.

Absolutely great.  The whole house smelled like an apple pie when you make this.  I changed recipe to 1 tsp. cinnamon and added 1 tsp of vanilla for more flavor and it was perfect.  You will love this one.

I added more cinnamon and a bit of nutmeg and they turned out great.  I made them to serve over pancakes and they were great.  This tastes a lot like canned apple pie filling, but you can adjust sweetness, spices, texture etc. to your own tastes.  Thanks, Jenny for sharing your recipe!

These are fantastic!  Granny Smiths are great, although in a pinch I used Fuji without too much loss in texture.  The flavor balance is great.  I added some raisins with the brown sugar.  Yum yum!

This is a good recipe! I think I'll add more water next time and cook it for longer on a lower temperature. Also I'll put in more cinnamon and some nutmeg :) Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is fantastic!  I used it last week with very ripe pears (didn't have any apples)and my family just loved it.  My son gave up his beloved cookie dough ice cream to have these apples over some vanilla Ice Cream.  My husband thinks it will be great in pie (maybe add a bit more cornstarch to make the sauce thicker for a pie filling).  Tonight I made it with apples.  YUUUUMMMMMMMMMYY!  Thank you so much for sharing

Great Recipe.  The only change I made was to add 2 Tbls white sugar because my apples were so sour.  I serve it with the Pan-Seared Chicken Breats with Shallots and the two recipes complimented it other beautifully.

Wow!  Made these tonight to go with the pancakes and eggs we had for dinner.  If I could give this recipe more than five stars, I would.  It is so simple and so incredibly delicious.  My husband and I both thought they tasted wonderful on top of the pancakes, and my 5 year old son just ate them right off the plate.  A definite keeper that will be made often in my house from now on.  So easy and yet so impressive.  You will get lots of oohs and aaaahs if you make this!

It's easy and quick to make,just make sure to buy the pre-cut apples. I need to cut down on the water next time, about 1/4 cup, so it won't be so runny. Thank you.

Very good. Start cooking as you keep peeling, so that some slices are added at the end to provide 'apples' in an applesauce.   I like a bit of vanilla (or maple syrup) in it.

So simple yet sooo good. I used the apples I had on hand which were not tart but it was still good none the less...served over ice cream. I am looking forward to using good tart apples and serving with waffles and whipped cream.

This was delicious. I am having a brunch this Sunday and will be serving these apples with homemade waffles, per the suggestion. However, I wanted to test the recipe out before hand. So, I made the apples and served them warm over vanilla bean ice cream for dessert last night. Loved them!

Wow!! I made these as a side with the "apple pork chops" from this site, but we ended up using this sauce as "dip" for the chops, so I think next time I will serve them right on top. I'd also like to have them on pancakes, waffles, ice cream, etc, etc. lol

Couldn't have been easier!  I served this with a pork roast, and it was a great hit.  I had made frozen scalloped apples in the past, but this tastes so much better with the fresh apples.  Best part is that there were leftovers.

mmmmmmmm. what a nice way to prepare fresh fruit. i used 4 big granny smith apples & doubled the cinnamon. the cornstarch works with the brown sugar to make a delicious syrup. i served my sauteed apples over the big germans from this site. thank you jenny!

Very good, but I had to cook the apples about twice as long as called for.  These would be great with vanilla icecream - just make sure the apples are very well done!

Wow.  This had a great flavor.  We poured it over waffles to get a change from regular syrup.  What a treat!  It was so easy, too!  I wouldn't change a thing.

These were pretty good - like apple pie filling.  Served with waffles for breakfast.  Might add more cinnamon next time for more flavor - maybe vanilla too.  Would be really good with vanilla ice cream.

I loved these! I didn't use the cornstarch and I used red delicious apples instead. I let them simmer while I prepared the rest of breakfast.I am not sure how long it was but they were perfect!  I served them with crepes and homemade whipped cream! The apples added just the right touch I was looking for. They were great.

Easy and delicious to prepare.  These apples taste much like apple pie filling.  I served them warm over vanilla ice cream topped with granola for a comforting autumn dessert.  I'll be making these again, possibly adding some nutmeg and/or lemon juice (but they're wonderful as is!)
