If you're reading this recipe and thinking "eh, I don't know.  Sounds kinda weird..."  Try it!  I'd never had pad see ew before, and I was a little worried about the "ew" part.  IT'S SO GOOD!  Beef & broccoli meets pad thai!  Fish sauce and oyster sauce aren't as nasty as they sound, and you can get them super cheap ($1/bottle) at an Asian grocer. I added rice vinegar and doubled the sauce (2 Tbsp rice vinegar, 6 Tbsp oyster sauce, 2 Tbsp fish sauce, 2 Tbsp sugar).  Also added 2 eggs instead of 1.  Used a whole good sized crown of broccoli.  Used "round sandwich steak" which is already cut thin.  No salt, just some black pepper.   Try it, you'll like it!

This is an Americanized version of a wonderful dish.  There are important ingredients missing here and some extra steps that are not necessary.  The water and cornstarch slurry is not needed.  If you use brown sugar in place of white and do not use to much soy and other sauces a nice sauce will emerge in the end.  Also no need to pre cook the broccoli, simply stir fry it the let it simmer in the sauce while meat cooks.  Also no need for another extra dirty pan with cooking the egg, just push all ingredient aside while still stir frying and add egg too wok and quickly scramble in same pan.  Also, where is the fresh cilantro to toss in at the end and the traditional thai chili sauce?  A lot of extra work and missing ingredients.

Pad See Ew is one of my teenage daughter's favorite dishes, so I have set out to learn how to make it. I used this recipe as a jumping off point, following it mainly for the ingredient proportions. Instead of beef I used chicken, and gai lan instead of broccoli. I also found some fresh rice noodles at an Asian market (see photo). I used the sauce ingredients as listed, but added 1 T rice vinegar. Technique-wise I stir fried the broccoli and set it aside. Then I stir fried the chicken, added the noodles, then the sauce. Once they were heated through I added the beaten egg. When the egg was cooked I folded in the broccoli. It turned out well, and my daughter approved (she ate 2 servings!).

This is a good recipe. I used chicken instead of beef, and thin slices of asparagus instead of broccoli. Like some of the other reviewers, I added a bit of sesame seed oil and rice wine vinegar. I also added a heaping teaspoon of prepared asian chili sauce to the liquid ingredients. At the end, I put in chopped scallions and a bunch of thai basil. The end result was delicious, but you do need an extremely hot pan and lots of oil...I used a combination of grapeseed oil and coconut oil...oils that can withstand a very high heat. I also have an induction range and put it at the power setting, which is hotter than most conventional settings can get. This high heat is what sears the noodles and gives the dish that distinct flavor. I would omit the cornstarch altogether next time since the high heat and starches from the noodles absorbs all the liquid. I've tried a similar recipe but w/o the high heat and adding chicken broth as a way to keep the noodles from sticking to the pan. This did not turn out. The trick here is to use a seasoned pan, extremely high heat and lots of oil.

great flavor!  1 cup of broccoli is not enough, though.  3 is about right.  I made it without the beef.

This recipe tasted authentic and straight from a restaurant. I used black pepper instead of white pepper because I couldn't find any at the store I went to. I also used New York Sirloin Steak. It also needed to be a bit sweeter so I through in about 3 tbsp of brown sugar while I mixed everything together towards the end. Overall, great recipe!

Love this reciope. Taste just like my fav resturant makes it. I use shrimp or pork instead of beef. And sub the brocooli with Gai Lan when I can find it.

I add carrots sliced on the diaganal and steamed.  Didn't have dark soy sauce, so used light soy sauce and a teaspoon of molasses.  Tossed the noodles in sesame oil before adding to the skillet to reduce their sticking together in clumps.  Increased the sauce amount by about 30 percent. This tastes just like the pad see ew I get at my favorite thai spot.  Thank you so much!!

Quick and Good!! So in the words of one of my family members, this 'tastes like fancy ramen' :-).  It was just a really good thai asian noodle dish, that was full of flavor and filling. YUM!  I did not have oyster sauce, but I did add some terayaki sauce.  I also topped it off with a dash of crushed red peppers and green onions.

I was very disappointed. There are other stir-frys on the site that are much better.  The oyster sauce was overpowering for me, definitely cut in half as another reviewer had suggested.

This was easy and delicious. I Doubled the sauce recipe which was a great suggestion, and did use two tablespoons sweetened rice wine vinegar so used only one tablespoon white sugar. I made a lot of substitutions: I did not have oyster sauce so I used hoisin sauce and did not have asian noodles so I used whole grain spaghetti - funny - but it turned out delicious anyway. I used peanut oil instead of vegetable oil. I also completely forgot to put the egg in - I'll try it again with the right ingredients and I bet it'll be even better. The message is that this is a very forgiving recipe and a good base for whatever meats/meat substitues and veggies you have on hand. Some hot chili paste on the table is a great touch. I think it would be good with some fresh toppings on the table, like chopped peanuts, cilantro, crunchy bean sprouts, etc.

This was pretty good. I gave it a 4-star because the beef gets cooked too much (I made adjustments because I knew the beef would be overdone as the directions are written). Also, the egg is done non-traditionally. Still, a good meal.

I thought this was really good and very tasty, but the sauce doesn't have the same taste as this dish at a Thai restaurant. As noted in one of the other reviews, next time I'll try adding 1 tbsp of rice wine vinegar and see if that gets the sauce closer. I also substituted chicken for beef, and used a whole broccoli crown. Definitely one to make again!

I absolutely love this recipe! it is so delicious! 

I've tried a few things with this one though.
Sometimes I marinate the meat before hand.
I've used everything from chicken to pork to beef to shrimp
and added whatever veggies i had on hand, such as carrots, cabbage, celery, broccoli, whatever we had.

Results always came out good!

This turned out great! I made some changes based on what I had on hand and to lower the WW points value. I used 16oz of tofu fettuccine shirataki noodles, 4 cups chopped broccolini, extra garlic, 2 eggs, garlic chili paste and no vegetable oil. Didn't have any thawed meat on hand, so we went meatless. Everything else stayed the same. Will definitely use some thin sliced beef and halve the sauce next time around. The few changes I made dropped the points down to 6 per serving - serves 2.

I tried this recipe last night and did not care for it at all. I found 1tbsp of fish sauce to be FAR too much.  It was just overwhelming--I couldn't taste anything but the fish sauce. If you're going to add fish sauce, by all means, throw in a teaspoon and work your way up. Once there's too much, it's too late. 

I am no stranger to fish sauce--I'm Vietnamese and it's in alot of our dishes.  

Good luck!

I have to admit, I changed the recipe a lot. Instead of rice noodles (which I didn't have), I used quinoa, so it ended up more like a stir-fry. I used shrimp and frozen veggies. For the sauce, as other reviewers suggested, I added 1 TBL rice vinegar and decreased the amount of oyster sauce to 1 1/2 TBL. Also subbed agave nectar for the sugar. Used half of the sauce and am saving the other half for next time. Cooked the shrimp, veggies and egg all up and mixed it with the quinoa. Superb! Will definitely make it again!

Wow! This is delicious for being such a simple dish. Next time I'm going to try shrimp and/or scallops instead of beef. I will also make 1-1/2x the sauce.

Pad See Ew is my favorite dish to order in a Thai restaurant.  This turned out great.  My kids (8 & 11) thought so, too.  I added sliced mushrooms to this (to use up some in my fridge). Leftovers were great the next day.

This was very tasty.  I decided to grill the steak and slice it thin, then, add to the vegetable and sauce mixture.  I used additional vegetables (pea pods, carrots and broccoli).  I had udon noodles on hand.  I will definitely make again!

I doubled the sauce as many suggested and I served w/ some peanuts, extra fish sauce and lime juice.  It was a hit and I'd make it again.  The only thing I really did differently was I used about 4 handfuls of frozen Thai vegetables rather than the broccoli.  It was what I  had and it worked out great.

Since some people were doubling the sauce, and others felt it was too much, I added 50% more sauce - and 1 tablespoon rice vinegar. I used chicken instead of beef. Wonderful! Some day I hope to get to the Asian market to by Chinese broccoli. Thanks!

I did make a couple changes but the basic was outstanding.  I have been looking for a recipe for a long time and I tried this and was super pleased.  My husband said it was the best thing I ever made and better then the local Thai restaurant.    Things I did change: Chicken instead of steak, I couldn't find wide rice noodles so I had to use narrow ones (I prefer the other ones), added more crushed garlic, more broccoli, and hot chili paste.    Two of us finished it all!

Was so excited to see a recipe for my all time favorite Thai dish! I stuck with the recipe other than doubling it and didn't change a thing other than using fried tofu instead of steak and 3 eggs instead of 2. I will use low sodium soy sauce next time as we thought the dish was a bit salty but overall flavor was great!!

This didn't turn out exactly as I planned but the beef and the broccoli were delicious. I think the issue was the noodles I bought.

This recipe was very easy to follow and turned out really good. We changed the protein used from beef to chicken and things worked out just fine. We didn’t have the right noodles to use but we substituted the wide rice noodles with another type of rice noodles and it turned out great. Though we changed the type of protein and the type of noodles the recipe originally used, the final product did look like something that could be made in a restaurant. We had to make this recipe for a baby shower and it did its job. Many people liked the recipe and were very surprised we made it. This is a recipe I would for sure recommend to any one in the mood for a very delicious Thai dish.

This was really easy to make. I was not able to find the wide rice noodles so I used the thin ones. It still turned out really good. My dad does not like Thai food and he still ate two helpings.

Soooo delicious!  Tastes like take out.  I made a vegetarian version as I didn't have any beef...used broccoli, mushrooms, bean sprouts and green onions.  Added a little sesame oil to the sauce and some hot sauce.  Tasted even better when I ate it cold for a late night snack!  Will soooo be making this again and again!  Thanks for a fantabulous recipe!!!

I was a bit unimpressed with this recipe. It was okay, but not great. I did double the batch and while cooking chickened out and only added half of the oyster sauce as the sauce was tasting very strong. I am glad I made this change and others agreed. With half the oyster sauce it is pretty good, but at full power it might have become overwhelming.

I loved this! The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 was I didn't have fish sauce so I put in garlic chili sauce in it's place. Also I didn't add the cornstarch and water to thicken up the sauce. It didn't need that step. Will definitely make again

Good base recipe, next time I’m doubling the sauce portion. Could have been a little more saucy. Added a shot of Chardonnay and a tea

I made some changes to the recipe. I didn’t have those thick noodles so I use stir fry noodles.I also added some rice vinegar as others did. To make it spicy, I added 1 tablespoon of chili garlic sauce and half a teaspoon of crushed red peppers and it was good. The sauce needs to be 1.5 of the given amounts. Delicious!

The recipe was far easier than I thought! I love being able to increase the amount of vegetables to our liking. I did what other reviewers suggested and omitted the cornstarch.  It tasted just like the restaurant recipe.

A very good recipe, quick and easy to make.  I made it with wide egg noodles that my husband picked up at Safeway (not the Asian kind, and it wasn't the best).  I also had red bell pepper and chicken breast on hand, so I used those instead of broccoli and beef  I used only half of the recommended amount of oyster sause as another reviewer recommended but made 1.5X the total amount of sauce.  I used 2 eggs but will use 4 next time.  Even though I changed a lot, I still appreciate the recipe and I like that it is versatile!  [For my sister, if you use egg noodles, you have to boil them like usual]

this was so good.. we meant to take a pic.. but couldn't wait to eat it.. had angel hair pasta on hand so that's what we used.. about 6 oz of it.. 2.5 cups of broccoli.. a 13 oz chicken breast cut up into 1 inch cubes in place of the steak.. didn't have fish sauce so omitted it all together.. didn't bother with the egg b/c we didn't feel it needed anything else at that point including any added salt or pepper.. ty so much for the recipe.. ~~~UPDATE: ugh.. i am totally sad to say that when made with the fish sauce this came out pretty fishy tasting.. and i do like to cook with fish sauce!  i ended up adding more sugar to make it more enjoyable and i am not one for sweet tasting food.. next time i'll be sure to make it the way i did the first time

This recipe has become one of my daughter's favorites.  It's a good mellow recipe, not too spicy.
