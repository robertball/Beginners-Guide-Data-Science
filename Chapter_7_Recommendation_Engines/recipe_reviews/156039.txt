I have cooked every kind of fish conceivable and this is absolutely the best stir fry salmon ever! Just the right about of spices and it would be great as an appetizer for a fish dinner.

We loved this recipe!  The only change I made was to use only a small amount of olive oil (appx 1 1/2 - 2 TBSP), which, I’m sure, may have changed it from the original intent, but it was great for us!  We have to eat Gluten Free and it’s a perfect recipe for that.  It was nice to find a new easy salmon recipe with an Indian influence (I’ve had very little experience with Indian food and this was a nice uncomplicated way to help get my feet wet.)    I highly recommend this one!  Thanks Tarma!

My son and I both liked this dish.  However it could have used more spice, especially more hot spice -- it was much blander than I thought it would be.  But I never would have thought to cut salmon into small chunks and fry, and that actually was an easy way to prepare this dish -- and fast!

Tastes great.  I did marinade the salmon in the Tikka masala over night.  I added the masala to olive oil, let that sit for an hour or so in a the fridge, and then added it to the chopped fish pieces.  We then grilled the salmon on a stove top grill.  I served it on a hot bed of basmati rice.  Started with a fresh salad.

I'm not a fish lover, especially if it's dry, grilled fish. And i was disappointed that there was no tikka masala in this recipe.....until my first bite.  This recipe has changed me into a salmon LOVER. It's so moist, very delicious, VERY spicy (the hubby loved it but it was even on the edge for him), so I will reduce the cayenne by 1/4 next time. Served it with rice and the Butter Chickpea Curry from this site but I liked it better with curried cauliflower that I found on another site.  Also, I didn't use that much oil, just enough to sear - I didn't even coat the entire bottom and that works fine.

Wow, I'm not sure who thought this needed more spice, but there is A LOT of it!!! I like the basic idea it was a nifty way to prepare salmon. If I make this again, which I probably will, I will reverse the amounts of red pepper and turmeric. to 1/2 tsp of pepper and 2 tsp of turmeric.

Added a little bit of garam masala, curry power and cumin per some suggestions.  Did not use cornstarch, and just used enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan.  Everything cooked quickly and it was delicious for being so simple.  Would definitely make again.  With the suggested amount of cayenne, it was pretty spicy.

Was great as is, but even better when I added 3 finely chopped cloves of Garlic, 1tsp hot madras Curry and a 1/2tsp Garam Masala.  It was just wow!  Even my non-fish eating son loved it!

Yummy!  We were hesitant but it was delicious!  Added a few more spices on the second batch, such as coriander and black pepper, and also only used enough oil to panfry.  Great suggestion a reviewer had to serve it with the Butter Chickpea Curry and Basmati Rice.

the trick to these is the size you cut it into.. the 1 inch cubes are perfect.. but too small it's too spicy.. too big and you lose the flavor.. didn't deep fry or use the cornstarch.. just sauteed.. these were surprisingly easy and very tasty.. ty for the recipe~~~UPDATE: you can use just about any fish.. i've also doubled the turmeric in one instance.. still super tasty

We live in Alaska and eat *a lot* of salmon.  My husband's first response when he took a bite: "This is epic."  Needless to say, it is now in the salmon rotation.  I did sub crushed red peppers for the cayenne due to allergies.

This tasted awesome, we only added a scant 1/2 tsp of cayenne because we are spice wimps and it was perfect for us, zingy but not enough to leave my mouth burning. Thank you for sharing your great recipe.

This was very good. I made it for a potluck and everyone loved it. I used 1 and 1/2 pound sockeye salmon. I did cut down the cayenne pepper to 1/2 tsp and put 2 tsp turmeric and a generous tsp salt for this amount of salmon. We are big salmon eaters (we fish Bristol Bay sockeye commercially) I would definitely make it again. Thanks for the recipe!

These salmon bites were delicious. I followed the recipe as written and wouldn’t change anything. I served them as an appetizer but they would be great as a meal with a green salad. Thank you Tarama for submitting this.

My son brought this recipe home from culinary school and I finally had the chance to make it.  I was planning to make sushi rolls with it. I made it according to recipe but I fried half and baked the other half. I must say, we love spicy and if your a big fan of spicy, BAKE IT! It reeeaaallly turns up the heat! Fried was delicious and it was the perfect compliment to the other ingredients. Baked really accentuated the cayenne and added kick to the mellow flavor of the sushi rice. My very picky son gave it a thumbs up! Try it, you won't be sorry.

I added a 1/4 cup of brown sugar to the marinade. Great taste!
