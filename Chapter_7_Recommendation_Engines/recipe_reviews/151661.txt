What a waste of a good piece of meat.  I should know better than to use an unrated recipe.  Making this for dinner last night made this clear.  There just wasn't a lot of flavor.  It was a bland unseasoned steak with canned spaghetti sauce poured over it.  (Guess I should have gotten that when I read the ingredients, but I was optimistic.  Won't make that mistake again.)  This was is NOT a keeper.

my mother used to make this all the time, but she used to really season it up with lots of Oregano and garlic.  Simmer for a long time in the sauce. Serve it as is or over pasta or bread.

A suggetion is to marinate the meat in chopped galic and olive oil overnight. I usually slice the meat into strips and simmer in a pot of tomato sauce like meatballs or sausage would. It makes the meat very tender and can be served over pasta like meatballs or sausage. I generally make a big enough pot for all three sausage, meatballs and steak.
