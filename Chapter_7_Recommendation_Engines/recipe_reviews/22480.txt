This recipe was fast and easy.  More importantly, I already had everything on hand.  My husband really liked them and I will probably make them again.  They don't store too well though, so be prepared to eat them within a day or two.

These were just ok when they came directly from the oven.  After sitting and cooling, they were very dry.  I definitely will not be making again.

Excellent, simple brownie recipe. Very easy to make and tasty. Great for kids, too. I did not have to make any adjustments.

Very good, but would suggest 5 minutes less on cooking time.  Mine turned out a little dry.

I took a coffee cup and sprayed it with cooking spray.  Then I filled it a little less than half full, and cooked it for 2:00 minutes.
