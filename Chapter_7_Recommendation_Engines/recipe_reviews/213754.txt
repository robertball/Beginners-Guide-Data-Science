This is my recipe..we make this every St Patrick's day.   As for the recipe, I shred the corned beef I do not slice it! So you have a layer of shredded cabbage salad, shredded corned beef, all sandwiched between good sourdough. (I like to buy a french baguette from Panera Bread). Yum. Also, you can make any kind of vinaigrette you like. Mine was only a suggestion. I currently use the ratio: 3 TBL olive oil, 2 TBL red wine vinegar, 1 tsp greek oregano, and sometimes a pinch of sugar for a sweeter taste.

This recipe is wonderful. I was out of spicy mustard so I used half yellow mustard and half horseradish.  Also, like other viewers I added swiss cheese and I also sliced some tomatoes for us adults. And I marinated the cabbage ahead of time so it had time to absorb. There was too much cabbage leftover, but perhaps that's because I added other things to the sandwich. Next time I will probably half the cabbage and marinade. Overall, it was Excellent, my kids loved it, my husband loved it and I loved it!  Great recipe!  I will make this again and again.

This was a great sandwich. The only thing I would change is swap the cabbage with a cole slaw mix. The cabbage did not absorb the sauce, which was delicious. So I would marinate the cabbage ahead of time. My whole family, kids and hubby ate these! Thanks!

Served this to 8 people for book group and it was a huge success. Everyone loved them. I will definitely make again and not just for St. Patty's Day. I made the recipe exactly as stated and used sourdough wheat bread. So flavorful.

We loved this. The only thing I changed is that I used Orowheat thins for the bread because this is what I had on hand and I I couldn't stand the thought of a "reuben" without cheese and so I shredded some swiss. Tasty stuff. Thanks bignosekate!

This recipe caught my eye because the cabbage wasn't cooked. I may be Irish but never did like sauerkraut. I cheated a bit, I had some very lean top loin corned beef from the deli. I made my cabbage mixture early in the day and let it sit in the fridge all day to marinate. I used cider vinegar and left out the salt and just kept throwing in shredded cabbage until it reached the right consistency. After I had my sandwich put together I decided to heat it up, so put it in my convection microwave on 350Â° until the Swiss cheese melted. Heating it was a great idea. Served with dill pickle wedges and chips. I'm not waiting until St. Patrick's day to make this great tasting sandwich again.

Recipe Group: So good! I subbed honey mustard in the vinagraitte, and for the sandwich I used yellow mustard mixed with a bit of horseradish and black pepper. I nuked my cabbage for 60 seconds before pouring on the dressing to help wilt it down a bit. Delicious, different sandwich to use up my leftover Guinness Corned Beef, thanks for sharing!

This sandwich was a good way for me to use the small amount of leftover Braised Corned Beef Brisket (mauigirl's recipe) I had made for St. Patrick's Day. For the dressing, I mixed olive oil, red wine vinegar, a pinch of sugar, and greek oregano. I poured over shredded cabbage and carrot and allowed it to marinate for four hours in the refrigerator.  I spread the spicy brown mustard on lightly toasted Amish White Bread (recipe from this site).  Unfortunately, we felt the sandwich would have been better with a different type of mustard as the spicy brown mustard was a bit overpowering for our taste. Thank you, bignosekate for sharing your recipe. This was the Buzz Recipe Group selection for March 14, 2015.

Fabulous combination of ingredients. Loved it! I used a different recipe for the corned beef ... the cabbage slaw makes this sandwich great! (recipe made for *RECIPE GROUP*). Looking forward to another and another and another. Thanks bignosekate for sharing!

Loved it!!!!  I made the sandwiches Panini style on the stovetop and added some Swiss cheese.  I will forever make my ruebens with coleslaw instead of kraut, so much better!  Used recipe "corned beef for sandwiches" off this site for the meat as it is the best I have ever tried.  Thanks for sharing!!!

Made for Recipe Group. Seems like not one of us has made the recipe the way she wrote it LOL. I used seedless rye and some swiss cheese, because it's not any kind of reuben without those. And I really missed not having Thousand Island dressing on it, but the mustard was good. I had corned beef leftovers from the day before and just pan grilled the sandwiches. Love the quick pickle slaw recipe though. We ate leftovers of that just as a side dish. Thanks for the recipe!

Recipe Group Selection:  14, March 2015 ~ A nice twist on a traditional Reuben sandwich.  I used leftover 'Stout Slow Cooker Corned Beef' from AR for the meat and two different kinds of rye breads.  We did like the spicy brown mustard for a different condiment.  I added a thin slice of Swiss cheese to the sandwich and popped them under the broiler until melted.  Where we are from a corned beef sandwich with cole slaw is called a Rachael.

Made this for Recipe Group...DELICIOUS! I did use 'Braised Corned Beef Brisket' recipe from here for the corned beef and I also used our favorite vinegar slaw. Loved the use of the toasted sourdough and the addition of the spicy brown mustard. I followed others and added some swiss...this is a keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I made this recipe a couple of months ago, and my entire family loved it and wanted more. Like another reviewer, I made it Panini style. My cabbage was cooked because I was using up leftovers. It still worked wonderfully. Thank you for this recipe. The balsamic vinegar is a must.
