This is delicious and easy to make! Perfect for students who live in dorms like myself. I did make some additions though. I added a bit of hot sauce to the enchilada sauce before . I also added a small can of diced tomatoes and green chiles, and once the food was served I squeezed a bit of lime over my serving. Overall, this is a delicious great meal that you can add different things to (corn, black beans, onion, cilantro, and on!) according to what you want/have. I will definitely be making this again!!!!

Simple and tasty.  My husband loved them!  I scrambled two eggs to put on top of his serving.  I also served it with refried beans, shredded lettuce and chopped tomatoes on the side.

I had a little left-over enchilada sauce and decided to try this out. I reduced every thing by fourths and made it into a single serving size. It makes a good little concoction. I recommend smashing the chips down a little bit. Everything seems to get a little more coverage that way. I also threw in some left-over chicken between the layers. This would work well with any kind of cheese.

Would be better with more stuff.  Like beans and/or ground beef, corn, or onions.

This was very good. Not spicy either. I used a box of Del Fuerte brand mexican tomato sauce, half the sour cream, and I was a little short of the Mexican blend cheese. Still it was a good dish and very filling. It was easier too using the chips instead of frying the strips. This was a great brunch, thanks for sharing the recipe.

This is pretty easy to make.  Just be mindful of how much of each ingredient you're using on each layer, so you still have some sauce left when you get to the upper layers.

This was so simple to make. Not exactly authentic but very tasty. I used a can of El Pato Mexican Tomato Sauce, added chorizo and didn't bother to measure anything else. I used Mexican cheese blend and topped it off with Queso Fresco. Will make again.

Chilaquiles are one of my weaknesses and this one is easy. I used hot enchilada sauce with Mexican blend cheese. This would also be good with a mild red or green sauce and your favorite cheese. Thank you Patty Pelfrey.
