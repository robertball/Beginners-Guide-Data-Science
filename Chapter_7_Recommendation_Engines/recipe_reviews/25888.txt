This was a refreshing change of pace as far as side dishes go-the recipe says to bake for 20-25 minutes; however, I had mine in at 400 degrees for 35-40 minutes because the spaghetti was still crunchy.  Still, this is a definite keeper.

Baked this again, after several years.  PERFECT.  hints**.....do not use as much margarine, do not drain the corn, cook spaghetti about half down BEFORE mixing it all together, use and extra cup of CHEESE..preferably something with a little kick, like extra sharp cheddar, and MAKE SURE you stir all the spaghetti into it every so often so none of it comes up to the top, sticks out, and turns into a spear to bite on.  It WILL stay soft if you make sure it stays submerged.  Great recipe!

Contrary to several other reviews, this was quite good and filling.  I followed the recipe except, I used butter (no margarine here).  One note that may make a HUGE difference -- It's a bit confusing (at least to me) when in the ingredients, it calls for 1/2 a box of spaghetti, but in the directions it calls for ONE CUP of broken spaghetti.  USE ONE CUP OF BROKEN SPAGHETTI.  I used Barilla Angel Hair Pasta and it came out perfectly cooked throughout.  I probably did cook it for @45 minutes but it was yummy!!!  I'm having it for lunch today, reheated, as there are only 2 of us eating.  Thank you Molly.

I used linguine noodles because I didn't have spaghetti at the time.  My husband looked at the dish and announced that he was going to hate it.  Although he'd rather die that admit when he's wrong, he still went back for seconds.  As he as a very picky eater, guess this means the recipe's a keeper.  As recommended by other reviewers, I used less margarine and covered mine, cooking it for 50 minutes.  In addition, I took it out of the oven twice while it was cooking to stir -- which I highly recommend -- that kept from having sections of undercooked, crunchy noodles.

I don't know about this one folks! I made this for my family, we ate some of it but all agreed it was way too cheesy (and we like cheese) and it was kinda of a crunchy/soggy combination. Just wasn't quite right on the old tastebuds! I don't recommend making this, it wasn't really worth the effort.

When I made this I doubled the recipe and added 1 lb ground beef.  The kids in my daycare LOVED it!!  And it was so quick and simple to make.  (I cooked the ground beef, added it in the pan with everything else then baked as directed)

Good Golly Miss Molly! We enjoyed this recipe. Per others, I reduced the butter, covered with foil, and stirring twice while it baked (50 min.) = no crunchy noodles for us. Also, I used the small seashell pasta instead of the spaghetti as I was out of it.  A great side to our grilled chicken - kinda like mac n cheese! Thanks!

My toddler and husband loved this recipe.  I only used half the butter recommended and cooked it for 55 minutes.  It is definitely different and I will certainly make it again.

This was great. I added half the liquid from the corn, more cheese than it called for, and cooked it for 45 minutes. It turned out wonderful. The whole family loved it. The noodles on the top were crunchy, which we all liked, but that along with the corn made it difficult for my daughter to eat with her braces. But the rest of us enjoyed it. Thanks Molly, for a fun, new side dish!

i cut the marg in half(used oliveoil becel).Used a 2.5Qt dish. Added shredded carrots at beginning.Used Omega3(flax) spaghettinni. Used light(part skim) OLD cheddar. cooked for about 50 min. Halfway through i added some frozen peas and about 1Tablespoon dried parsley.Thought it needed some green. Used this as a main dish not a side dish and is quite filling. Next time i will add tuna and maybe more cheese. I found it 'sweet'..because of the sugar in the cream corn and the canned corn. (green giant)maybe next time ill drain the corn and add a bit of plain water instead!  Will make again!

This recipe was okay, my four year old son liked it more then i did. I tried it twice and made changes to it the second time. I added a cup of milk and used a smaller can of creamed corn and corn. I also used spaghettini instead of spaghetti since it is a bit thinner. Listened to other members and cooked it quite a bit longer then recommended and cut the margerine by half. Thanks for your suggestions all! :-)

This was an unusual recipe which I didn't think I would like but turned out very good.  My hubby was late for dinner and it baked for an hour and was done to perfection.  I wouldn't recommend baking it any less.

I don't know how that was supposed to work. Apparently some people had better luck, but for me? First of all, corn, cheese, and plain noodles don't really go together. Second, it makes a mess that looks like it's already been eaten. Thirdly, it is a wonderful dish if you wish to turn dinner time into an improv comedy venue. :)

I thought this was a very interesting and different recipe. I added some roasted red peppers and some of the corn juice as someone else suggested. Only used 2 TBSP of margirine. It took about 45 min to cook, but it really was easy and delicious. Now I have a new side dish casserole recipe to take to all those luncheon affairs they insist on having at work. Thanks

My family questioned it when it was put on the table but after I pleaded with them they tried it.  They loved it!!  Didn't expect my husband to like it and he probably had the most.  Very good and very simple.  They'll be begging for this one again!!  Thanks!!

This was surprisingly great!  My whole family loved it.  The only thing I suggest is to be very careful to use the correct amount of spaghetti, otherwise it will not absorb properly.

I have made this dish a few times now, and it has gotten great reviews. No changes are necessary. I always add extra garlic to everything though.

Good. Nothing super-special, but it was easy and I liked it, as did my toddler. I added some garlic powder, paprika and black pepper. I also had to cook it nearly an hour, not 25 minutes. It was an easy dinner when I didn't have a lot of food in the house!

Everyone LOVED this dish, and I can't wait to make it again.

A few variations I did: cooked for 50 minutes and stirred twice throughout (like most other people), added some crushed saltine crackers, sprinkled some more crushed crackers on top and drizzled 1 tablespoon of butter on it at the 40 minute mark to create a yummy crust. Then I sprinkled some more cheese on top at the end.

I DID drain the corn, and my spaghetti noodles tasted fine. This dish was so good that we're replacing our old corn casserole dish!

This went over well with the kids, not to mention I really liked it as well!  I had no problem with hard noodles, I used Macaroni (easier for the baby).  I was leary about not draining the corn, but it was fine (it was needed to cook the noodles).  I added a layer of crushed ritz crackers over the top, YUM.  Thanks Molly!!

To quote my husband, "It's awesome!"
The only thing I would change is that I would use less fat in the dish next time. I will make this again and again

This is really good and my husband especially enjoyed it.  It's really important to remember to break the spaghetti into small pieces, though, before adding the corn.

Delicious! I baked for about 45 minutes to ensure the spaghetti was cooked and not crunchy, and i didn't add as much butter as suggested. We loved it - it was a nice change of pace for a side dish. Will definitely make again!

We liked this random recipe very much. This was food that looked funny but tasted good. I had a totally different feeling in my mouth from what my eyes were telling me. The kindergartener and the mini-toddler (10 mo.) both loved it, although they both had trouble finishing and eating it.
I added about 3/4 cup of water - this was perfect.
I also added pinch of salt/pepper/garlic & onion powder.
And I baked it for 45 minutes at 450 - too hot for this recipe, but still tasted good. I think 375-400 would have been perfect.

Molly, this was soooo good!  My 6 yr. old grandson had seconds.  I gave this recipe to a friend who has three grown sons (living with her... hem...).  Anyway, she said she made a double batch and they inhaled it.  Then asked her to make it the next day!  Now, that's an endorsement!  Thanks for the great recipe.

I was so excited to try this after all the reviews but was a little disappointed.  I was good but it tasted exactly like what it is - corn with noodles.  Nothing more, nothing less.  Don't know that I will make it again.  But not the worst thing I have ever eaten

This was soooo good!!  To 6 oz. spaghetti I decreased the butter to 1/4 c. and added 1/2 c. water/milk, 1/2 an onion, and had leftover mushrooms to use so added them.  Baked covered for 55 minutes.  My next attempt will be to try this in the crock-pot.

I was another person who was afraid to try out this recipe.  Eventually I figured it was worth a try.  Boy am I glad that I gave it a chance.  I used macaroni noodles instead of spaghetti.  I also cut the amount of butter in half.  Cooked it for about fifty minutes and stirred it twice while it cooked.  Everything cooked perfectly (no hard noodles) and the liquid from the canned corn cooks the noodles very well (so don't chicken out and drain the liquid, you need it).  I didn't try it but it looks and smells really good.  My husband ate a ton of it and definitely wants me to make it again.

This was good. I had this once when I was 12 at a pot  luck. I've been looking for the recipe for a long time, I'm 18 now, and I finally got it. It's just as good as it was then... I made mine with shredded Velveeta and 16oz of elbow macaroni, I had to cook  it a bit longer, but it came out good!!! I will make this again

Awesome job Molly!  I used half the butter, baked for an hour and my whole family loved it - even the kids!  If you want to try something really different (and very easy) give this a try.

I made this corn dish for Thanksgiving '07 and my family loved it. Only one spoonful left (and that is good for my family) we usally have tons of leftovers. I am also going to make it this year for Thanksgiving. I added a touch more spag and watched the liquids but it turned out picture perfect!!

I doubled this recipe, and I thought it might be a little bland, so I made some changes.  I added a Jalepeno, seeded and chopped, 1 Green pepper, 1 can Mushroom, chopped onion and a can of Rotel, oh I also used 16 oz. of Thin Spaghetti.  I made it the night before, then baked it covered 45 minutes, and then uncovered 10 minutes.  I'll make it again, but I think I'll make it spicier and also add Ground Beef, for a main dish.

This was a pretty good and different side dish -- I had to cook it a bit longer maybe 10 minutes for all the noodles to become tender. I added a little julianned yellow onion on top and seasoned with pepper -- made great lunch bowls!

I also used half the recommended butter, cooked it for 55 minutes, ans stired it several times during cooking (a must, to crunch down all noodles and scrape sides.)  My 3 year old and I liked it alot.  My 8 year old didn't, she thought it was too weird.  My husband liked it but thought it tasted too much like corn.  Probably will not make again, unless I am home alone with 3 year old.

The corn I used was Mexicorn, so there was no liquid in it, so I added 1/2 cup of water, and this was easy and yummy. The kids ate it up. I think I'll break the noodles smaller and add a pound of shrimp to it.

I used 6 oz spaghetti, which measured more like 1-1/2 cups, but stuck with it.  I think that turned out about right.  I used frozen corn so no liquid there.  But I used all the margarine so I didn't have any issues, and I too vaguely remember that I did stir it at least a couple of times.  I think cutting the margarine in half and using the corn liquid would take away some flavor.  I thought it tasted like a variation of creamed corn.  I was a bit leary of this combination.  It really wasn't bad, but it also just wasn't terribly exciting either.  I have no desire to make it again for me, but thought I would add it to my "different, creative stuff for when I have guests," but reading the reviews, that might be a bit chancy.

Turned out really good.  Kept it in the oven for almost an hour to thoroughly cook the noodles.

I only gave 1 * but that's because i couldn't use less. I did not like this casserole.  I am just not a fan of sweet corn or casseroles that have sweet corn in them.

I have had corn fixed several ways and I liked this one the best of all. I did the recipe just as instructed and it was wonderful. I will use this one from now on.

I really enjoyed it, but my 13 year old son - who actually loves corn- didn't seem to like it at all. He didn't like the combination of the spaghetti w/ the corn. My husband enjoyed it a little.

My daughter loves corn, my son doesn't but he loves spagetti- we now have an acceptable side dish for the two of them. I even took some leftovers in my lunch the next day!

Hmmm..I thought this was just ok.  It was good right out of the oven while it was still piping hot, but after a while it got soggy and the leftovers left alot to be desired.  I went ahead and used the spaghetti noodles and cut the butter down to 12 a stick.  I agree with a previous reviewer that this is sort of like mac and cheese, but won't make again as the kids didn't care for it at all.  Thanks anyway.

Excellent!!  My family is a lover of corn and this was a huge hit.  very simple and quick.  I followed the suggestions of others and used 1/4 cup butter and added about 1/4 cup milk.   I used pipette macaroni (like elbow pasta) baked for 1 hour stirring twice and it was perfect.  Thanks molly!

This recipe was just ok - like other reviewers I halved the margarine and baked it for a longer time.  There's a similar recipe that I have that has red and green peppers added, maybe using the corn that has these added to it already would be better.

This was very good and really easy.  I had to substitute american cheese for the cheddar, since I had not yet gone to the grocery store and it came out nicely.  This is a keeper.

We didn't use any cheese.  Cooked at 400° for 40 minutes. Absolutely scrumptious and so easy.

Maybe I read totally wrong, but there just wasn't enough information here.  What was really supposed to happen with all the spaghetti?  Alot of mine didn't really cook and was hard and crunchy still.  Was it supposed to be truly mixed or not?  Was the can of whole kernel corn supposed to be drained?  I think so, I had LOTS of juice. It was not very congealed at all even after baking about double the time.  Tasted fine, it just didn't come together very well.

Quite good, but I will definitely use less butter next time around.  It wasn't bad as it was, just a little greasy for my taste.
Thanks! :-)

I didn't like this recipe. As someone else said, it simply tasted like corn and spaghetti - nothing special. I also went by the directions and since it was a casserole I was layering the ingredients rather than mixing them. After the spaghetti wasn't cooking I decided to mix it up. It still took way longer than 25 minutes, more like 50 minutes.

Made this for the family once, they liked it alot. I made another recipe that had corn muffin mix, it was good too. Then I combined both recipes in a round about way and that was it...no leftovers last Christmas. I will make it again this Christmas ( make sure I remember all the ingredients etc) and post it after. From the ideas of many recipes comes a great one. Thanks for posting this Molly.

An interesting concoction. My husband and I both thought it was ok, but it needs lots of pepper and some salt. My son, on the other hand, thought it was awesome. If he asks for it I may make it again, otherwise, it will not likely be a repeater.
