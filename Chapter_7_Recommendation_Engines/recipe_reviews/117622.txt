I make this often to use as lunches during a week.  I normally divide it up into 5 small containers and freeze them until I need one for lunch.  It holds up well once it's reheated.  I change nothing in the original recipe so it's great as a complete dinner, as a side dish for a party, or for lunches.  ENJOY!!

As is, I give this recipe only 3 stars. I had to add more sauce...it was way too dry, and I mixed in about 3/4 c. of shredded cheddar cheese. Once I did that, it was GREAT! My kids and husband liked it. It was a nice new way to use black beans...

This was great, I cut back on the cumin (because it can really over power) and used marinara instead of tomato sauce. All in all I really liked it!

This is a good recipe that you can tweak to your liking. My dad makes this with sauted jalapenos and it does give it a nice flavor. It is very good warm.

What is it they say about great minds? ;) I thought I was making something up on the fly, and lo and behold it ended up being very similar to this one! My only change was to use canned diced tomatoes with chilis instead of the sauce and top with a dollop of sour cream.  Quick, tasty and filling! Thanks Stephanie! :)

GREAT RECIPE!  Be careful recipe calls for 8 oz of pasta so adjust accordingly.  As is you need about 4oz more of sauce & 1c more of cheddar cheese.  For less prep, I used 1/2 a bag of Birdseye frozen pepper & onions.  I will make again, and for you meat lovers, you really won't miss the unheart-friendly meat.  Thanks

I loved this! I used frozen peppers/onions for some ease. This was definitely better warmed, I didn't care for it cold right out of the fridge.

This was amazing without the tomato sauce and cheese. I added a bit of chicken broth and it was absolutely delicious, perfectly seasoned, and precisely what I was craving. Yum!

Very yummy. Very easy to make.  I did follow other's suggestions and use more tomato sauce.  The only other change was that I had to use garlic powder (no fresh garlic). Thanks for the recipe!

Quite good! I used kidney beans instead (it's what I had), upped the amount of servings, and used more red pepper... delicious! A very savory pasta.

This was surprisingly good and has lots more potential if you want to add meat (sausage, chicken, etc.).  I doubled the garlic and cheese and added an additional cup of tomato sauce.  I used the noodles I had on hand (a mixture of penne and elbow macaroni).  It's definitely easy and a good vegetarian option.

Yum!  I didn't follow the recipe exactly because I didn't have everything and I was cooking for two but yum!  I used a can of tomatoes instead of sauce and used orzo instead of the spirals.  It was more like a burrito bowl but still filling and good! Thanks for the inspiration!

I thought this was great! I had neither green pepper nor onion so I just left them out (added onion powder instead). The sauce had a great flavor and I thought there was a sufficient amount; I wonder if those lamenting a lack of sauce used a whole box of pasta instead of the prescribed 8 oz.  I added a box of frozen spinach (thawed and drained) just because I had it and was in the mood for spinach. Having added spinach I felt justified in replacing the cheddar with a sprinkling of feta. I think it would have been great exactly as written though! I'm looking forward to having it for lunch today!

I really enjoyed this pasta dish. I used some leftover chunky marinara sauce from this site in place of the tomato sauce. Very good!! Thanks.

Wow - even my pepper-hating brother loved this! I followed as written, except I used 1 T fresh oregano, powdered red pepper, and extra sauce (definitely needed). This really does taste incredible and it was SO EASY! We couldn't stop eating it.

I made this when my vegetarian brother came for dinner.  We both thought is was...bland & dry (and yes, I followed the recipe & only used 8 oz of pasta).  Couldn't figure out exactly what we'd add to it to improve it.  We didn't hate it, but I definitely won't make it again.

Thank you so much for this easy recipe.  Tastes great as is and loved finding something filling, comforting, and tasty using beans instead of meat.  Used 2-3 cups of frozen red, green peppers and onions and extra cup of tomato sauce.  Cooked it in an electric skillet.  Will try as others said and freeze for those weeknights i'm tired from work. (single gal!)

We weren't sure what to expect with this one but the family really enjoyed it. We're not vegetarians but I didn't feel like preparing meat and this hit the spot! I followed the recipe but added corn and left out the peppers and onion.

I enjoyed this meal but it wasn't the BEST thing ever.  I added more green pepper because I love it and added some chicken and it turned out pretty good.  It was a different flavor than I'm used to and it was good to reheat for lunches later.  A little dry so I added more tomato sauce too.

Definite keeper at our house!  The only changes I made were to use elbow macaroni and I didn't really measure out the vegi's.  Used about 1/2 an onion, 1 whole bell peper, a spoonful of minced garlic (jar) in a little olive oil (the spray was not cutting it in my pan) and then I used 1 whole can of the tomato sauce (I think its like 14.5 oz).  I threw in oregano, basil, red pepper and the cumin by sight.  For the cheese I used the shredded Mexican blend that is cheddar, asadero, queso and monterey jack.  I probably used a full cup for the whole recipe that I blended in until melted through.  I ate my serving with sour cream, my hubby did not.  OMG, it was sooooooo good, he had thirds (maybe fourths?..regardless, there was nothing left!!!!!!   AND SO EASY!!!!

This was a nice easy, quick meal.  I used frozen peppers and onion, which made prep time a breeze.  Is great served over pasta.  Try topping with some sour cream (yum).  I also like to serve as an apitizer with garlic bread for dipping.  A great vegetarian dish all around.

I wasn't expecting much from this recipe, but was pleasantly suprised! I didn't have red pepper flakes, so I added a dash of chili powder and an extra clove of garlic. Five stars because it was amazingly EASY! I prepared the green bell & onion ahead of time and just threw it together. My 13mo daughter and husband both enjoyed this!

Delicious!!! I added a bit more cheddar and seasoned it with salt, pepper & garlic salt to taste. I was afraid it would be dry because of other reviews, but it was perfect!

This is a great side. I had to add some chicken broth due to it getting a bit dry. I used red pepper instead of green. Totally forgot to add the cheese, but it was great without.

OK, but fairly bland.  I ended up going much heavier on the seasonings and also added salt and fresh cilantro.  Since others complained about this being dry, I used one can of tomato sauce and one can of garlic/onion diced tomatoes, which I thought worked well.  I'll likely make this again, with modifications, just because I always have this stuff in my pantry!

This was an amazing dish! My husband is a vegetarian and we are always looking for good recipes. I put 3 cloves of garlic instead of 2 and also increased the tomato sauce by 1/2 a cup. We garnished ours with the cheese and fresh cilantro. AMAZING!!!

This is a good lo-calorie, low fat, vegetarian dish, easy to prepare and have for leftovers.  Thanks for a recipe that doesn't have meat!

I thought this recipe was tasty and simple to make.  The only thing I would do different is to add a bit of salt to it.  Otherwise, a healthy, easy, and filling dish.  Thanks!

This dish was very simple to make.  It didn't require a lot of work and was delicious and healthy.  I didn't use nearly as much cheese as the recipe called for.  After preparing and serving, I just sprinkled a little on top of each serving.  I also brought the leftovers for work and it did heat up very nicely.  I didn't top with any cheese when I took it to work.

Very good! I did add green chilies and more garlic though.
