Let's see...the best darned filet mignon and lobster tail money can buy, bacon and butter.  Assuming you cook it perfectly, as hubs did, it just doesn't get any better than this! The directions are clear and accurate, and other than doubling the amount of lobster per serving and reducing the Old Bay slightly, we made this just as the submitter directed.  And she definitely had it right.  Perfect.

Very easy and elegant!  I recommend buying the best quality filet that you can afford, it will make a huge difference in the quality in the finished dish.  I added a 1/2 cup of white wine to the lobster.  To ensure the the lobster doesn't get tough, under cook it, the broiler will finish it.

This was awesome!  I made it for my husband for his birthday with roasted asparagus, twice baked potato and yeast rolls.  He thought it was the best meal ever!  I didn't have any Old Bay, so I used a combo of spices I had on hand and it came out great.  Definitely try to get the best steak you can, and I would recommend not letting the lobster brown too much as it can dry it out.  I sauteed it until done and topped the steak so that it was still moist.  Great recipe!

What an awesome Valentines day recipe.  I changed it up a little.  Doubled the lobster, BBQ'd the filet, cut the old bay in half & added 1 tsp of garlic powder instead of the old bay to the melted butter for the final topping

This was delicious!!! First time I did it in the broiler and it was awesome! My boyfriend loved it and said it was the best thing he's ever eaten in his entire life. This time I charcoal grilled it and it was even better!!!! Gotta get crafty with the lobster  though. I Skewered it and cooked it on the grill brushing it with the butter

This was sooo good! I made this for my boyfriend and I's 1 year anniversary dinner, and it was amazing! The only thing I changed was instead of sprinkling the meat with salt, pepper, and garlic powder, I used Montreal's Steak Seasoning. And instead of toothpicks, I used kitchen twine to tie the bacon around the meat. I also cut down on the Old Bay seasoning, only because my man's belly is sensitive to heavy spices. I highly recommend getting with your butcher to find the best cut of tenderloin they have. It is definitely worth the money. Thank you Tina!!!!

Oh My! This was delicious. A perfect choice for our Father's Day menu this year and will be a repeat next year. Followed the recipe except we grilled the bacon wrapped filet and then placed in the broiler to finish up with the lobster. Excellent results with rave reviews. Thanks for sharing!

Followed you recipe and feel in live with it. My one error was that I think I cut the lobster up a bit too small. I'll get it right next time. I made this for parents and they loved it too! Thank you.

Since Valentine's Day 2012 is upon us, I actually remembered the name of this recipe and printed it out again. I made this last year for Valentine's Day and it is definitely "worthy" of the occasion.  I did (and will do again) about everything the other reviewers recommended...lighten up on the Old Bay, add a splash of white wine to the lobster, don't cook lobster "til done"...cook it "till almost done" as oven finishes it off. Truly a simple and remarkable meal....and I cannot believe I forgot to review it last year!

Slit the lobster tails down the middle (front and back) and sauteed in the shell until 1/2 cooked, then removed, chopped up, and returned to pan. Adds so much flavor! Did not fully cook the lobster since it was going under the broiler and it came out perfect and tender. Yum!

This is a wonderful recipe.  So easy to do.  I wrapped a couple of pieces of bacon on my filets just to they were covered.  The steaks came out so tender and flavorful, you almost didn't need a knife to cut it.  I substitued crab meat which I added at the very end.  Just long enough under the broiler to turn it a slightly golden color.

Very easy! Great Taste! Tried it for the first time last night - yummy...In my oven 8 minutes per side on top rack in oven actually resulted in well done - but that's the way I prefer it. If you're really aiming for medium rare, may want to start checking at 6 minutes depending on thickness and position in the oven.

Amazing, amazing, amazing.  I loved the browned butter spooned over top and gave it such richness.  It was a perfect medium rare and so tender.  Hubby kept going on about how awesome the filet turned out.  Loved this so much!!

This recipe is the bomb. I made it with ground beef and those imitation crab sticks and it still got me laid. I also didn't have any Old Bay so I sprinkled shredded coconut on top. The perfect Valentine's Day dish!

This recipe was fast, easy and delicious! I made it for my DH's birthday dinner--he was impressed with the presenation and the overall meal. I used 1 slice of thick cut bacon per filet but next time I will use 2 since the cooked bacon unwrapped and wouldnt wrap around completely. Some adjustments I made to the recipe: I used Steak Seasoning for the filets and only a pinch Old Bay (after reading a few reviews). Also, I melted 1/2 cup of butter for the lobster and used the excess to top it off at the end.

This was easy an delicious!!!!! The meat was very tender and I like the meat well done. The butter was just the right touch to keep it juicy and it was excellent to rub the lobster in the butter because it also had the flavors of the beef mixed in! I made it just as the recipe said, didn't change or modify a thing. The old bay was perfect flavoring for his dish! Will definitely make again and again!Thanks!

My boyfriend made this for me for Valentine's Day. I was so impressed!  It was delicious, and not difficult for him to make at all.  It also didn't take a long time.  One of the best meals I've ever had.

Made this prior to going on vacation.....We had a hard time finding a better dish while dining in some of the best restaurants on the east coast.  To make it an all in one dish, I made spinach sautéed in garlic/mushrooms and fresh parmesan cheese to layer in between filet and lobster.  Incredibly easy and rewarding!

I used no seasoning to the lobster and just sautéed it in butter then added to the filet. No need to cover the taste of Maine lobster with seasoning. Other then that great recipe.

What can I say that has not already been said about this recipe...my first time broiling filet, I was terrified, but it turned out PERFECT!  My only change was to add a little white wine to the butter while I sauteed the lobster meat.  I had the camera out to take a picture, but I couldn't wait to dig in, I completely forgot to take it :)  ....OUTSTANDING recipe!!!

Thank you. Thank you . Thank you. I am not a steak eater. My husband and kids are so deprived because we always eat chicken and fish and sometimes pork. This year I wanted to move away from the usual turkey or ham dinner for Christmas, so I thought I would try this. I was very afraid that I was going to spend all this money and end up screwing up the recipe. Steaks always come out tough for me. I was sure I could manage to make tenderloins tough too. But it was perfect! We now have a new tradition. Now I can't wait for next Christmas to do it all again.

Yep; it was as good as they say. Simple and tasty. Make sure you mince the lobster or it'll fall off the steak. Broil another tail that has been drenched in the butter mixture and serve it beside the steak for a true surf and turf. Excellent! This is my cardiologist's favorite recipe.

When I ask my husband what he wants for dinner, I ALWAYS get the same response -- Steak and Lobster. So for Valentine's Day I thought I'd give him what he wants, and hopefully shut him up for a while. ;-) 
I can't really say anything negative about this recipe because it was so flippin' great! I am not much of a beef eater, and I always leave the steak cooking to my husband, but this gorgeous piece of meat came out so tender that it almost does not need to be chewed. Perfection. I would probably double the amount of lobster next time I make it, but that would be the only thing I'd change. Thank you for a great recipe. I am sure he will be asking me for it again in the near future.

I followed this recipe for Valentines Day filets this year, and they were outstanding. I have never cooked steak indoors (always grilled outside), and this recipe gave me perfect results. I did substitute the lobster and browned butter for shrimp in a scampi butter sauce. No changes to the filets though, thanks very much for sharing :)

OMgosh...this was fabulous.  I made this as written (minus the bacon), and it turned out fantastic.  Even the picky 11 year old gobbled it up.  Will definitely make this again.

This is my first review but I just had to write one for this awesome recipe. Like other reviewers I grilled my steaks instead of using the broiler. Keep in mind that grilling the steaks takes a little longer than in the broiler directions included in this recipe. I half cooked my steaks and then started the lobster which was the perfect amount of time. I also used 1/4 tsp of garlic with my butter and doubled the amount of lobster. Delicious!

My husband and I just love this. I usally buy more lobster  for extra and use a little less bay seasoning. Great meal to impress.
I sear the  filets in a (med-high heat) cast iron skillet for 2. 1/2 -3 minutes each side first, then transfer the skillet to the 450 degree preheated oven for 5-7 more minutes placing the lobster/butter mixture towards the last few minutes.

Oh, yum! I made this for our family's Valentine's Day dinner, and everyone loved it! I'm not a fan of Old Bay seasoning, so I omitted it, but otherwise I followed the recipe very closely. So good, can't wait to make this again.

I made this for valentines day and it was scrumptious. I substituted thinly sliced garlic cloves  for the old bay seasoning in the first step but kept it in the browned butter. Simple elegance. We both loved it.

Very elegant and simple dish to prepare.  I did make my own butter garlic sauce to top off everything at the end. The broiling times were pretty accurate, although I started checking after about six minutes. I only use time as a guide, but temperature is the key.

Made this for a romantic valentines dinner. Quick and easy to do and yet very pretty and tasty. I would have cut the lobster up a bit more than I did.

Best steak I've ever made or tasted! So tender even when cooked well done. Perfect Valentine's Day meal! I once substituted crab meat on top when I didn't have lobster.

This is the best steak I have ever had at home and at some restaurants! I made this for Valentines Day and my husband loved it! I changed nothing! Thanks so much for a great recipe! Also I must add I have no cooking skills and this was very easy for me to prepare. It tastes like it took hours to prepare but it was about 15 min including cook and prep time!

WONDERFUL! I used the search and entered steak and lobster because that's what I had in my freezer. I overcooked my steaks (my fault...new oven) but it was still great. Heck, even an over cooked steak is good with butter, Old Bay Seasoning and lobster! LOL

It was very  good  i used the butter I cooked the lobster in as my brown butter
I added a little fresh lemon it adds so much 
and I didn't put the lobster in the oven so as to not over cook, steak  was a perfect rare.
but it was a good basic recipe.

Incredibly good. Instead of filets I used Kobe sirloins, and everyone raved about how good they were. And don’t be shy with the Old Bay seasoning.

This came out great!!  I added a little garlic to the butter and didn't brown the lobster bc I have a bottom broiler in my oven and its hard to watch the food to make sure it didn't over cook but it was delicious!! My husband loved it.  I did about 7 minutes on each side of the steak for med rare and for the thicker steaks about 8-9 minutes (they were about 4 inches thick)

Made this for Valentine Dinner.  I cooked the lobster tails the way Chef John cooked his on the Lobster Newberg video.  They were fabulous.  I did add the splash of white wine as other reviewers suggested.  Served with roasted  asparagus and the Marscapone Mashed potatoes.  Delicious and special dinner.

Made this for my husbands Birthday dinner versus going out to eat.  Had 5 filets, and enough lobster to go around.  All I heard was how delicious this was. I am now adopting this as our "Special" meal for special days. Thank you for your submission.

I thought this recipe looked amazing, but my husband doesn't eat shellfish and we couldn't afford filet mignon, so I improvised. I started with a small chuck roast. I then cut it into 1  inch squares and ran through a meat grinder. I formed these into patties and put on the grill for 10-15 minutes. Served on a toasted bun with ketchup and mustard. Outstanding. Will definitely make this recipe again.

SO GOOD!!! This time I realized too late that I didn't have any Old Bay seasoning at home so I used garlic butter, olive oil, minced garlic, lemon juice, touch of Worcestershire, Italian seasoning, splash of soy sauce and teriyaki sauce, and some taco seasoning and it was crazy good!!!

I made this for Valentine's Day and it was mouthwatering!  I followed the advice from the other reviews and got top of the line filet mignon and I'm glad I did.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was really perfect.  I served it with roasted asparagus and baked potato.  A lovely dinner for a special occasion!

Great recipe!  I couldn't get good fresh lobster where we live this time of year so substituted with large shrimp and cut the butter in half... big hit with the family!  My mom has requested it for Mother's Day!

This is really superb and it calls for my first review! My husband doesn't normally eat steak and devoured it. He said it was better than the expensive fish house downtown. I placed it on a bed of homemade garlic mashed potatoes. I went a little overboard with the Old Bay and used more than the recipe called for, and more than I should have, but still very yummy!!
