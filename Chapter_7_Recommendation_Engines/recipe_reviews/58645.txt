I'm rating this a 5* because, with alterations, it is a HIT!  I took the advice of other reviewers and added minced garlic and chopped onions (about 2 cloves and 1/2 an onion) and also threw in 2 slices bacon at the beginning, as my fiance doesn't like asparagas especially and would REALLY turn his nose up if no meat products were involved.....it was AMAZING!!!!  Ooooh, he loved it so much he ate the whole pan (1 lb) of asparagus, and was slobbering for more.  I probably used 1/2 c freshly shredded parm all said and done.  Thank you!!!

This is the only way we prepare our asparagus now! VERY GOOD! Another way to prepare it is in the oven. You can spray a pan with Pam, then you line up the asparagus and shake it a bit so all sides are coated with the spray. Then sprinkle with kosher salt and pepper. Bakes at 450 for 5 minutes. Then sprinkle with paremesan when you pull the pan out of the oven. Baking and spraying with a fat-free cooking spray may make it a bit healthier

This recipe is awesome.  I alter it slightly to decrease fat.  I steam for 3 minutes, drain, then saute in 1 T oil and 1 T butter for 5 min. and then sprinkle fresh parm cheese on it. Wonderful!

Hmmm... reading reviews people said 3/4 TSP of cheese was not enough but the recipe I see calls for 3/4 CUP of parmesan, which seemed like too much! So I just sprinkled till it looked right which came out to probably around 1/3 cup. I also put 1/2 tsp of chopped garlic in the butter and oil and squirted the juice of 1/2 a lemon over the asparagus before adding the cheese.

Used the suggestion of a previous reviewer. Sprayed down a rimmed cookie sheet with some PAM, rolled the asparagus around in it then seasoned with salt, pepper and a little garlic powder. Baked in a 450 degree oven for 5-7 minutes. Then sprinkled with the parmesan cheese. Deee-licious!

I sauteed some minced onion and minced garlic in the EVOO/butter, then let it cool. After it had cooled a little, I drizzled the mixture over the asparagus. I roasted this instead of cooking it in the skillet. I also used fresh parmesan. Family didn't care for it but I LOVED IT.  NOTE: I served this with Mushroom Wild Rice Bake and Corn Bread Chicken.

I thought this was pretty good! I admit I did use a bag of frozen asparagus and I cooked it in the microwave. I cooked a 12 oz bag in a bowl covered with plastic wrap with about 1/4 cup of water, on the package directions. Then, I drained and added 1 Tblsp of whipped butter and olive oil to taste about 2 Tblsp. I covered and cooked 1 more minute. Then, I sprinkled on the cheese to taste about 1/3 of a cup or less and microwaved 1 more minute. I sprinkled on a little salt when I took them out of the microwave. I didn't mean to change the cooking method but, I did it out of ease. And, I used all of the ingredients listed, but scaled them back to cut a few calories. In the end delicous!

Made the recipe exactly as written and it was delicious.  My husband who had never put an asparagus in his mouth in 35 years - has eaten this 4 times in the last 2 weeks.

This would have been a 5-star recipe for me had it not been for the excessive amount of Parmesan called for.  In my view it should be used merely to enhance the asparagus, not to dominate it.  Once done and on the serving plate, I just added shavings of Parmigiano-Reggiano to suit our tastes.  I can't imagine topping the asparagus with this much Parmesan cheese!

Like others, I skipped the butter and just used olive oil. I also added garlic and onion powders. This was a quick and very tasty side that the whole family loved. Thanks Jen!

Delicious. Sauteed 2 cloves of garlic in the butter and EVOO first, removing garlic before adding the asparagus. The only other change I would make next time would be to use half the amount of EVOO. Thanks for the post, JenElaine.

Although I am not a big asparagus fan, I have to admit this was actually pretty good.  My husband loved it...anything with cheese.  Thanks for this new way to cook a not so tasty veggie.

Cooked this recipe as is. Tasty results, but wish we had used shredded Parmesan instead of grated Parmesan cheese (i.e., Kraft in the plastic can). The grated stuff was fine, but it would've been better with shredded. Note: the recipe calls for a LOT more cheese than necessary. We should've eyeballed it.

Also, it definitely didn't need so much butter/oil - would've cooked just as well with less.

Other than that, this was really good and it was quick and easy to prepare.

I make this about once a week. I coat the asparagus with olive oil, add a little sea salt and place in a baking dish covered with aluminum foil then when the asparagus is fork tender I add the parmesean and put on broil for a couple minutes. Soooo good! :)

As written I found this recipe a bit too bland and greasy for our tastes, however by adding 1-2 cloves of minced garlic when melting the butter, cutting the EVOO back to 2 TBSP and adding a healthy splash of lemon juice at the end I ended up with a dish my husband can't get enough of.  Thank you for a great starting point!

With adaptations I make this almost every week now.  Here are my changes...  First, I make it either in the oven or on the grill (in a slotted grill pan).  I lightly coat the asparagus with oil and lemon juice.  You don't taste the lemon but it brings out the flavor.  I sprinkle liberally with Kosher salt and freshly (coarse) ground pepper.  You can use almost any oven temperature but it takes about 10-15 minutes at around 350 degrees.  When it's almost done I sprinkle with freshly ground Parmesan cheese.

I loved this recipe although I used less oil than called for.  Taste was great and adding garlic and onion really won me over.  This will be added to regular rotation of side dishes.

I am NOT a fan of asparagus, but I liked this simple and tasty recipe for it. I have made it several times, and sometimes sub the Parm for grated Reggiano, which is actually a better complement to the asparagus. Good way to get kids to eat their veggies!

This is a nice way to cook asparagus without having to turn on the oven! I grill my fish on the grill and make this to go with it and I love being able to use the stove top. I also add some minced garlic as well as garlic salt, great result. Also remember not to put the burner up too high as it will burn the asparagus. Thanks again :)

um, wow.  I sauteed it with bacon and garlic in addition to the recipe instructions, per another reviewer.  Delish.  We had it with the tomato-topped cod, also from this site.  My husband said he it was the tastiest meal he'd had in a long time (and that's saying something, considering he always loves my cooking!).

What an excellent way to have the first asparagus of the season!  The asparagus had a perfect texture and an excellent flavor.  The kids still hated it, though.  Oh, well.

Too much oil even drained. Cheese is ok but a bit heavy for asparagus. On the upside my "garbage disposal" (hubby) loved it :) Would be good with a touch of lemon juice and/or almond slivers.

Very yummy and so easy! I loved it. I added chopped fresh garlic and I used all butter and no oil. Will definitely make this again.

Loved this easy recipe.  I always add loads more garlic (we're nuts about garlic!) and otherwise enjoy this asparagus recipe.

I'm doing low carb which consists of A LOT of vegetables so it's really hard to get variety especially when you don't like as many kinds of vegetables like me.  I also only thought asparagus was "ok" but never could make them quite good enough that I'd want to eat it a lot.  I discovered this recipe last week and WOW!  Sooo good!  I actually made it twice last week because it was so good.  I'm so happy I found this recipe!

I had never tried asparagus before. It turns out I don't like it. My mother, however, who in the past has only liked asparagus "ok" said this was really good.

I just baked it in the oven pouring the olive oil over the spears and baked for 6 minutes.  Turned them and bake a few mins more.  Added the parmesan cheese and some garlic powder and baked 4 more minutes.  The kids devoured them

It was good, but cooking 10 minutes was a little too much for us.  I just eyeballed the cheese.  Probably didn't use the full amount.

My husband actually prefers the texture of canned asparagus so I took my fresh asparagus and steamed it until done his way.   Then I moved it to the pan following the directions.  He LOVED it.  Thanks for a really simple and delicious recipe.

Loved this. I decided it would be easier to melt the butter and olive oil together, brush it onto the asparagus, and bake it, instead of frying it. I needed considerably less butter and oil this way (a large tsp of butter, and 2 tbsp oil was plenty) so it cut down on fat a little. I sprinkled on the parmesan, pepper, and a little garlic powder and baked for a couple extra minutes to melt the cheese a little. I had planned to drizzle a little lemon on at the end, but I forgot. It didn't need it. I will make it this way again.

I followed various suggestions.  I cut up and cooked a couple slices of bacon.  Then rolled the asparagus on a cookie sheet sprayed with PAM.  Then sprinkled on chopped up garlic, the bacon, some onion, salt, and pepper.  I baked it at 450 degrees for about 5 minutes.  Then added some freshly grated parmesan once it was out of the oven.  YUMMY!!!

Very easy and delicious!  I followed the recipe as written and would only make one suggestion- a little less oil.  I felt that the 1/4 cup made the asparagus a little too oily for me.

My recipe for asparagus is always starts with Fresh minced Garlic & Onion sauteed in EVOO (no butter) add halved Grape Tomatoes, all stirfried on stovetop to keep some crunch. Even though it adds salt and calories, I grated Fresh parmesan approx 1/3 cup and sprinkled it on top.  A Very nice addition to a favorite asparagus recipe.

Delicious!  Took the advice of some other reviewers and cooked up bacon in the pan first, then cooked the asparagus with some garlic in the grease/butter/olive oil mixture.  Crumbled the bacon over the parmesan sprinkled asparagus and vegetables got delicious!  Thanks!!!

I loved eating the asparagus like this. Next time I'll probably use less oil as I had a lot left on the asparagus, even after draining them. Other than that, I loved it. Will definitely make these again.

I loved this recipe the only change I made was that since I don't use salt I used Mrs. Dash garlic seasoning on it. Will make again. Oh and it was easy.

This is a great recipe - a different take on asparagus.  I bought canned or frozen asparagus before, and will never do that again since I tried this recipe with fresh.  There is no comparison!!

This makes asparagas special...Another way,with less fat..steam asparagus to desired doneness.then melt and burn a tablespoon or more of butter until it is brown, pour over drained asparagus sprinkle with parmesean and add a grating of Nutmeg.. really terrific!

I love asparagus, and this is a very good and easy way to cook it.  Sometimes I add a bit of citrus, and sometimes other spices - for example, last night I served it with a chicken dish that included rosemary, so I added a bit of rosemary and lemon juice to the asparagus as well, and it was delicious!

Outstanding recipe!  Everyone loved these asparagus.  I used 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs instead so it wasn't as dry and a 4 garlic cloves.

I too "tweaked" this recipe a bit by adding roasted garlic and fresh lemon juice/lemon zest..sea salt and cracked black pepper really makes the difference too.  Yummy!!!!  Even yummier off the grill!!

It was very good except for the fact that there was way too much oil. I will do this again but use more butter and a LOT less oil. I belive I will saute it less and put it in the oven to finish and incorporate the cheese.

Just made it. Used the garlic and onion, however, my cheese didn't melt? I was unsure how to do that part because I did not want to overcook the asparagus. This was my first time eating them, and they were delicious.

Absolutely amazing!  I haven't had asparagus in a long, long time, because last time I had it I thought it was terrible.  I've been daring recently and decided to try some new veggie recipes in an attempt to lose some college weight.  This was amazing!  The "veggie" flavor wasn't too strong for me and I ate way more than I thought I would.  My family loved it too!  We will definitely try this one again!

Great way to make asparagus. I reduced the olive oil to 2 tbsp. & that was plenty. You also may want to wait to salt it because the butter & cheese does add quite a bit of salt on it's own. Thanks for the great recipe.

This recipe was ridiculously easy, particularly because I don't like to cook! And it was delicious.  Since I had to make it for 18 people, I didn't saute it in a pan as recommended, but baked it in the oven at 420°, in a single layer on multiple pans.  It still was wonderful.  HOWEVER....!!!!  I'm not Jewish, and this dish was provided at the request of my Jewish mother-in-law.  Who knew that one is not supposed to eat dairy and meat together at the Seder meal?  Not me, and nowhere on this supposedly "Seder" site was there any kind of caution. Granted, as I learned from my MIL, if it was a vegetarian meal, there would be no problem.  Anyway, as a warning to others, you will be in trouble with your Kosher in-laws if, like me, you are a Goy and just don't know better. Anyway, bottom line, my Jewish MIL still loves me, faux pas and all.

Tastes Amazing! Looks Great too!
  Beware of cooking the asparagus too long.  8 min was just right!

Yum! I steamed the asparagus for a couple of minutes til it was almost done, then sauteed it in the butter/olive oil along with a garlic clove. I grated my parmesan in large shreds and sprinkled over the top right before I took it to the table. It was a tiny bit melted and so delicious! Oh---I used two lbs. of asparagus and increased the amount of butter a little but, but did not increae the amount of olive oil, and it was perfect. No need to double the oil, there was plenty for the 2 lbs.

Very good and easy. I followed another reviewers suggestion of sauteing 2 minced garlic cloves (1 tsp from a jar of minced garlic) in the oil and butter before adding asparagus. Asparagus cooked in about 6 minutes. One of my two children loved the dish...a great accomplishment:-)!!!

Tasty and easy way to make asparagus.  I blanched the asparagus first to bring out the bright green color and partially cook it.  Works well with broccoli and broccolini too.

This was a very good recipe. I am not a fan of asparagus and it was something that I enjoyed eating. I did use the splash of lemon juice recommended by others. I also chopped some oniona and sauteed it with the asparagus. I will use this recipe again.

This is a great recipe however, it can be made even better by topping the asparagus with fresh lemon. It gives it a real bite and the lemon and cheese combo is delicious.

Good, simple recipe. Next time I might try cooking the asparagus in the oven (as suggested by another reviewer) to cut out some of the oil.

simple but delicious though I did make one change to make them healthier: I steamed my veggies first the just tossed them with 1 TB of butter and olive oil. Tastes just as good/much less fat. PS: I also did this with green beans when I did not have asparagus and it works well with GBs too

I fallowed the recipe exactly, except didn't measure out Parmesan, just sprinkled it on. We loved it! However I think it was a bit fattening do to its oilyness.

This was quick and easy.  Very tasty too.  I put the cheese on, covered the pan and set it aside for about five minutes.  It melted and then set up a bit, making the whole seem like a loose casserole.  Recommended.

Really creamy.  I made this for Easter dinner I put the Olive Oil over the asparagus and added some Parmesan cheese.  When it was done and came out of oven I added a little more Parmesan cheese then plated to dining table.  Everyone loved it!  Husband said it tasted similar to endive.  He ate the most of it!  I will definitely make this again.

I followed the recipe except that I didn't put any butter (not as good for you as olive oil) and then at the end I added tomato sauce (just from one of those 'Classico' jars) and a little of leftover pizza sauce from the other night.  It was deLISH. Even my no-veggie hubbie ate it, and liked it! :)

I was not very impressed by this. The final product was very, very oily, and the cheese on top just tasted...odd. I picked my cheese off and then it was better. I sauteed the asparagus with maybe half the olive oil called for (seemed over the top), as well as onions and garlic. The cooking time was perfect. If I try this again, I wil skip the olive oil and cheese altogether.

I made this as written with the exception of using Sea Salt and Cracked Pepper.  I also used less Parmesan cheese and added some minced garlic.  Very tasty.

This is the ONLY way we make asparagus in our house now!  I did add a bit of minced garlic to match our personal tastes and used only 1/2 cup of parmesan.  Otherwise it is perfect! I tried making it only with olive oil once, and the flavor is just not quite a smooth as when you also use the butter too.  Thanks JenElaine for the recipe!

As it turns out, we don't like asparagus cooked in a pan on the stovetop. Live and learn. Nothing wrong with this recipe though if you like not-crisp asparagus. Thanks for the recipe :=)

I made this to go along with a chicken and rice meal I made and it was so good and easy to make. The only thing I had to change is that I used a 3 cheese blend with parmesan, romano, and asiago because I didn't have regular parmesan grated cheese.

Excellent everyone enjoyed it!  I roasted the asparagus with EVOO, salt, pepper, and garlic powder then added the parm after removing from oven.  Served it last night at a dinner party and it was a huge hit.  Thanks!

Easy and tasty recipe.  I only used 2 tbs olive oil and 1 tbs butter, it was the perfect amount.  Added minced garlic after 8 minutes of cooking.

Oops!  I forgot to mention previously that I felt 1/4 c. olive oil would be way too much, so I just used 1 T. olive oil with the 1 T. butter.  Yum!

The asparagus paired with the parm cheese is a perfect combination!  Cooking for 10 minutes was just right- the aspargus was very tender and flavorful.  I will use this recipe again and again.

I usually make this in the oven - pour about a teaspoon of olive oil in a casserole dish, throw in the asparagus and season with kosher salt and pepper.  10-12 minutes at 375° seems to be good to keep it crisp but cooked through.  Add the Parmesan at the end and let it sit for a minute to warm up...yum!

I thought this was pretty good and certainly easy and quick.  To make this again I changed it a little, used 2 tablespoons of butter, two tablespoons olive oil, slivered roasted almonds, then infused with minced garlic half way through cooking time, topping off with a four cheese blend I get from my deli.

wonderful (and easy!) side dish for a special meal.  I added crushed garlic during the last few minutes of saute time for extra flavor.

Bought asparagus on sale.  I like them but DH and DD aren't too fond of asparagus.  DH actually found this recipe and both LOVED it!  He says it's "by far the best asparagus I've ever had in my LIFE!"  We went by the recipe except for cutting down on the oil.  Used a couple tablespoons and the butter and it was plenty!  Starting some onions first so that they carmelized by the time the asparagus was finished was the clincher for us! Added a deeper taste.

This is pretty much the only way I cook asparagus. I quickly saute some chopped garlic in the butter and oil right before I add the asparagus, being careful not to let the garlic get to toasty.

10 minutes is way too long to cook the asparagus. I did them for 4 and they were overdone. Next time I will try for 3 minutes. Aside from that, this is a nice recipe, especially if using fresh grated parmesan.

YUMMY! Even those in the family who don't normally like asparagus liked this :) I think it's something we'll have only once in a while though, as the butter and cheese negate the purpose of eating veggies with dinner.. so it'll be a treat :)

We loved these! I had a zuchinni that needed to be used so I sliced it on the diagonal & added it w/ the asparagus. I also added some lemon pepper. I served these w/ Rockfish with Crab and Old Bay Cream Sauce (from this site) & croissants.

Really liked the addition of the parmesan.  Sauted a couple of cloves of minced garlic for a minute before putting in the asparagus.  Put a lid on the pan to steam for a few minutes, and then took it off to crisp.  Only had to cook for about 7 minutes.  Sorry the asparagus season is almost over!!!

A really easy recipe that tastes great. I always sauteed my asparagus in water, but the oil added alot of flavor. The parmesean topping was excellent!

I was glad to read where some put it in the oven. (I had done as recipe before).  I didn't want to mess up a cookie sheet, so I took heavy aluminum foil, sprayed with olive oil cooking spray and rolled asparagus in it, then cut up the butter and placed it through out the bunch, sprinkled with pepper and garlic salt.  Then I closed the foil around it and baked for 8-10 minutes.  When it was done, I opened the foil and sprinkled with the parmesan cheese.  Worked just as good and no cleanup.  LOVE THIS RECIPE!!

I live in Asparagus Country, and have prepared my asparagus similarly for decades!  Simpler yet, steam your asparagus to desired doneness, then garnish with butter and parmesan to taste.  Can eat that every day of the week during asparagus season, and some weeks we do!  Even the packaged, grated parm is good with this--no need to use fresh, grated parm for delicious results!

This was amazing!!! I did make a few additions... I cooked and prepared it as the recipe called for with the addition of sprinkling a little bit of Italian style bread crumbs and garlic powder on top to coat along with the Parmesan, salt & pepper. The whole family loved it! Needless to say there were no leftovers. And this is now my favorite way to make asparagus. Thank you!

Made this tonight with the modifications suggested by others. I added 1/2 an onion and 2 cloves of garlic, all minced, as well as 2 pieces of turkey bacon (we don't do pork). Used only the butter and no other oil in our cast iron skillet, and it turned out great. Topped with 1/4 cup Parmesan - and it was a hit.

This was a really great side dish to have alongside grilled chicken. This is such an easy recipe to prepare and it would taste wonderful with pretty much any kind of main dish so I can see us using this one a lot in the future. The asparagus turned out nice and tender and really flavorful. The only thing that I changed was that I added some minced garlic to the asparagus, but left everything else the same. Thank you for the recipe, JenElaine!

These turned out really well. They were quick and had a good flavor. They were too greasy so next time I will cut down the oil about half.

Absolutely loved it! I cooked the asparagus on the stove with olive oil and butter.  Drained on paper towels. Added a pinch of kosher salt (I prefer the texture) and used a microplaner to shave  the parmesean, to my taste.  The microplaner makes such a fine shaving of parmesean, it melts upon touching the asparagus.  I can't wait until I make it again.

We really love this... I did cook it a little differently though... I steam the asparagus on the stove with 1/4 cup water for 20 mins. Then I added a little olive oil, salt and pepper and the cheese. It was great!

I gave this a 4 only because the parmesan doesn't melt well. I like the idea of mozzarella and will try that next time. Very good and have made numerous times and will make again.

Very good!  I used only olive oil and sauteed garlic with the asparagus.  After it was done I squirted lemon juice over and sprinkled with Parmesan.

This recipe is definitely "quick and easy", not to mention delicious.  I used to steam my asparagus, but not after making this.  The spears retain their wonderful colour, and it is much easier to cook to your desired doneness. No more over cooked asparagus for me!! Thanks for the great recipe.

Fabulous! We made this with pork chops and mashed sweet potatoes, but the asparagus ended up being the centerpiece. Like other reviewers, I nixed the butter and just used olive oil. I wasn't sure about the amount of asparagus...if the recipe contributor meant 1 lb. before or after trimming, so I used 1 lb. after trimming.

This recipe is hit or miss. I've made it about 6 times now. The first time it was excellent, but each time it's gone downhill. I can't seem to get the right consistency for the asparagus. It's either overdone or underdone. I use thin asparagus since they are usually more tender than the thick ones.

This was so simply and very good.  I made it last night and even my 4 1/2 yr old ate it.  I only had the jared parmesan so next time, I can't wait to see how it comes out with fresh cheese :) Thanks

Really great springtime recipe... with a couple of changes. I added the appropriate amount of butter but held back a little on the olive oil. My asparagus had plenty enough oil, I can't imagine how swimming in oil would have improved the dish. 3/4 cup of Parmesan cheese is way too much. I put between 1/4-1/3 cup and was happy with the results. Also added minced garlic as advised by other reviewers. With the variations it was very tasty and will be my "asparagus" recipe.

This was excellent! The only "tweaking" I did was to cut back on the oil as others suggested, add garlic to the butter and oil to saute a little and then added the asparagus. I was out of fresh parmesan so I added grated parmesan. It was really quite delicious.

Very good!  Quick and easy - my picky husband even enjoyed!  Might cut down on the amount of oil next time.  Had quite a bit of oil left over in the pan and on the asparagus, even after draining.  Will make again.

Excellent...my husband raved about it...Great recipe.  I did, for lower fat, add 1 tablespoon light butter and 2 tablespoons of olive oil.  I stir fried this since I've not been experienced in making asparagus.  Delicious!

Wonderfully quick and fresh!  It cooked up wonderfully in the skillet, used crumbled feta instead and it was great!  My husband now likes asparagus (THANK YOU)  and I will use this often.  I imagine it'd be great with parmesan.  

One note: It only served 3 for us, because it was gobbled up!

Good asparagus dish.  I used much less oil, and this turned out great.  A good quality parm makes a difference.

This was pretty tasty, I liked the combination of the cheese and asparagus.  however I would cut the cooking time at least in half otherwise the asparagus comes out overcooked and soggy.  Kids seemed to enjoy it though so I give it four stars.  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe was pretty good.. just be sure not to cook the asparagus on to high of heat (as i did!) and next time I think I will add a few cloves of minced garlic to the recipe as i think it will give it a little bit more flavor!

This was easy and simply to make.  I did cut the amount of oil so I did not need to discard it later.  Next time, I would add a little seasoning during cooking instead of after.  Definitely a make again!

Made this with some grilled tilapa and it turned out very nice. I used some leftover romano as well when I added the cheese. It was very easy to make.

This was excellent!  I crumbled up some leftover bacon (already cooked) and added it to the skillet during the last minute or so just to heat through, and it was delicious!!  Just make sure to cut back on the salt because the bacon has plenty!  This recipe was a keeper...thanks for sharing!!

I love the taste of these two together. Balsamic is also a great flavor to try with the two. Sometimes I steam the asparagus and then pop it in the stove with cheese on top just till melted. Can't go wrong if you love asparagus

Unfortunately for me the only asparagus I had at my disposal was canned but it still came out WONDERFUL!  I can just imagine what it would taste like with fresh asparagus.  I know that when my husband gets back he's gonna love these!!

This is a great way to cook asparagus!  I normally just steam it and I was looking for something new.  This was a huge hit with my husband who is not crazy about plain, steamed asparagus.  Will make this over and over again.  Thank you for sharing.

This was so fast!  I prepared this while our steaks were resting (6 minutes!).  Asparagus was on the large side, but we like it crunchy (what's the point of getting fresh if you're going to cook it into mush?!)

I found that using 3/4 tsp (per the 5 serving recipe) was not enough Pamasean for 1 pound of asparagus. The amount I used was more like 1-2 tbl. I sprinkled the 3/4 tsp, then ended up shaking more on the veges, tossing it about, then adding a tad more to the top.

Awesome!  I added some chopped onion and garlic to it, and some grated swiss cheese with the parmesan.  This is the only way I can get the family to eat asparagus :-)

I am NOT a fan of asparagus, but my husband is.  I made this for him and we both loved it.  He raved to his Mom.  It was actually the first recipe that I've used that my Mother-In-Law asked for.

I would recommend cooking the asparagus longer than recommended in the recipe, they came out a bit underdone the first time I tried it.

I made this for my mother in law who loves asparagus.  She thought it was great.  I used canned spears instead of fresh ones.  (I think fresh spears would have turned out better)  The spears were a little too limp for my taste when using canned.  Otherwise, not bad.

Very easy to make...I cut down on the amount of oil and sprinkled it with some garlic salt as well. Great recipe and I've already made it more than once.

This was a very tasty and simple way to make Asparagus. I’ve always had a difficult time preparing it so it tastes cooked. Will definitely make this again. I did add onions, garlic and mushrooms and omitted the butter. It was delicious.

Really great taste but overcooked- my fault used teeny asparagus spears and didn't compensate. Will cook again- my husband doesn't eat nuts and loved it without.

I don’t understand why people rate something 5 stars when it is only good with modifications. This could be better with some garlic and/or onion, but milk is also a great dessert if you add sugar and vanilla and freeze it. This was awful. Way too much oil and Parmesan cheese, and it definitely needs some flavor from garlic or something. No one in my family liked it, and we all like asparagus.

Loved the cheese with the asparagus but I would suggest just eyeing the amount you use. I apparently didn’t have enough asparagus because there was too much cheese and I used a typical bunch.

We really enjoyed this asparagus recipe. I added some minced garlic and extra Parmesan cheese that I graded from a block of cheese that I had used in another recipe. Both the younger and older liked it evenly. Thanks for the recipe!

This was super quick and simple. I love butter so this is my kind of recipe. I also threw in garlic.

My guy and I made an oscar feast for two tonight! I had very thin asparagus spears and once I cut one inch off the bottoms, I did cut the remainder in half and I think j that made all the difference. I forgot the Parmesan cheese and I'm ok with that. I added lemon pepper to the oil, butter, salt, pepper, and garlic (just one clove). This is a solid recipe:)

The foil didn't stand up to the flipping and scooping, but the recipe worked way better. Not sure all the oil was necessary, as a teflon pan isn't going to require all that anyway. I'll try it with garlic and onions, and half the oil (at most) next time.

Delicious!  I used just one tsp of margarine. After reading some of the other reviews, I added both onion and garlic to the frying pan as the asparagus cooked.

I am not an asparagus fan, but I make it for my husband. I told him this is the first time I ever enjoyed asparagus! I did make a change -- I made it in the skillet as directed with 1 tsp butter and 1/2 cup of water, and the garlic and onion other cooks suggested. I covered it and it steamed nicely. Then I added the fresh parmesan and salt and pepper before serving. Easy and delicious, and less fat.

This was so simple and easy to make its hard  to believe it taste that good. As with any recipe I modified it according to my own taste. I reduce the butter, added garlic, got a little carried away with  parmesan (not). Thank you for sharing and I thank the reviewers for their suggestions.

I made this as written and it was pretty tasty that way.  I think next time I try it I'll add some garlic and onions as per other reviews for more flavor.  Can't complain, though - this got my family to eat fresh asparagus without fussing!

A great alternative to plain ol' steamed asparagus. My husband who doesn't even like asparagus even said this was a five star recipe! I only ended up using 1/2 cup Parmesan, instead of 3/4 cup. We'll be making this again! Thanks for sharing!

I thought this was just OK.  I think it would be better (and healthier) just to steam it, then top with the cheese.

I love the combination of olive oil and parmesan, so this recipe was right up my alley.  It's simple and the flavors are perfect.  I did find it a bit greasy, so next time I will use less olive oil.

Super simple recipe that's delicious. I didn't make any additions from the recipe, but I eyeballed all the ingredients used. I'd definitely go easy on the butter and olive oil and add a little bit of water to let it steam. Otherwise the parmesan gives it a wonderful flavor.

Good alternative to asparagus and mayo! I put the asparagus on a plate and then put them in the oven at 250 to melt the Parmesan cheese. Yummy.

Really good. We love asparagus and are always looking for new ways to cook it. I followed the directions exactly and really enjoyed it. In the future I would use fresh grated parm cheese though - didn't have any on hand so used the store bought kind.

I followed one reviewer's suggestion to steam the asparagus for a few minutes (I steamed them for 5 minutes) before putting them in the pan. I also added a clove of garlic. Yummy! These were a hit with everyone, even my dad who doesn't usually care for asparagus. Fresh parmesan is very important, too, not the dry, crumbly stuff!

This asparagus recipe was great!!!  And so quick and easy!  I made it for dinner tonight, and I am going to make it again tomorrow night.  I love asparagus, but no one in my house does, so its great to find an easy recipe that I can make a small amount of, just for myself.  I didn't measure anything out exactly, I just eye-balled it.  And it turned out perfect!

I made this for Easter dinner and I usually load Velveeta on the asparagus to hide the taste, but I thought I would try this instead. It was fantastic! I followed the recipe that was given - probably used a little more parmesan than called for, but I love cheese. I use fresh parmesan which I think makes a difference in any dish.

So Easy and So Fantastic..  I add about 1/2 a teaspoon of Balsamic Vinegar just before it comes out of the pan.  Let it simmer out for about 3 minutes and then drain on a papertowel and put on the fresh parm.  It has to be fresh grated parm to give it a great taste.  For a change,  add blue cheese crumbles instead of the parm,  or in addition to the parm.  Let the crumbles melt onto the top or put under broiler for a minute or two to brown the blue cheese.  This is amazing!!!  Thanks for the quick and easy recipe.  I make it weekly.

I cook mine on the grill.  I snap the ends off and marinate them in a ziplock bag with the olive oil then cook them on the grill on flat grated cooking sheet.  When they are almost ready, I sprinkle with salt, pepper and parmesan cheese.

This is a great Recipe!  Thanks!  I usually use the oven to prepare Parmesan Asparagus but I prefer this way now.  The only thing I did different was to add some minced garlic to the butter/olive oil.  Next time I make this I will probably only cook it for 8 minutes instead of 10.  I like it a little more firm then it came out.  My husband, who is usually not an asparagus fan, really like this a lot!

Very nice!  Used broccoli (because that's what we had), cut down a little on the oil and parmesan, and added some onion and garlic.  Didn't need salt or pepper.

This was a lovely side dish for our "Filet Mignon with Rich Balsamic Glaze" we had for last night's Valentine's dinner.  We used white asparagus for the first time and it was delicious.

my husband cooked this for me as a side to a wonderful dinner and this was my favorite part!  he makes fun of me for liking parmesan cheese too much, but he liked it just as much as i did.  we definitely plan on trying this with other vegetables.

Great new way for me to make asparagus.  I added 4 cloves minced garlic (I like garlic ;-) )  and sauted it in the butter/olive oil before adding the asparagus.  I also used regular Kraft grated parmesean cheese - nice!

This asparagus was very good.  As other reviewers have noted, when I make it again, I will reduce the amount olive oil and butter on this recipe.  I also found tht 3/4 cup of parmesan was too much, so I only sprinkled on a fraction of that, perhaps that's just my taste.  Otherwise excellent and very easy.

I've always liked asparagus just plainly cooked on the stove with a little butter, because that's what I grew up on, but my husband wasn't convinced, so I found this recipe. I took the advice of other reviews adding onion, garlic cloves, and bacon. It was a hit. We were all a little upset that there wasn't more of it, so next time I will double the recipe. Thanks for sharing!

This dish is hard to mess up, and it was a great, light side item for Thanksgiving.  TIP: I covered the asparagus as it cooked on the stove to speed up the cooking process.

This was a great way to enjoy asparagus, especially for a cheese lover.  I melted 1 Tbsp of butter in the pan, and then just added enough olive oil to coat the pan (didn't measure it).  Seemed to work pretty well.  I also didn't measure out the cheese, I just sprinkled it on until it looked like the amount I wanted.

This is the PERFECT way to prepare asparagus! I didn't even think that I  liked asparagus, but this was delicious. I had asparagus left over from a risotto recipe and didn't want to waste it, so I went looking for a simple and tasty way to serve it as a side dish. I found it! And, now I love asparagus!  YUMMY!!!

It was very good however I would add crushed garlic and definitely reduce the amount of butter and EVOO.  I used freshly grated Parmesan.

Love this recipe, it's my favorite way to cook asparagus.  My favorite addition is a clove of slivered garlic.

I won't be cooking asparagus any other way. We had a few friends over last night and I wanted to do the asparagus different than the usual steamed. Everyone said it was the best.

This is one of my favorate ways to have asparagus next to roasting them. I also use this exact method to make my green beans. It's the only way I'll eat them. Yum!

Love this! I also add the parmesan cheese in the pan at the end removing from the heat for just a few seconds before serving. It melts the cheese and makes it even yummier!!!

Yummy!  Never had asparagus prepared any other way than boiled and this was wonderful!  I switched the olive oil and butter amounts since I only had a little olive oil left and it turned out fine.  Not the healthiest way to eat your asparagus but certainly tastey!
