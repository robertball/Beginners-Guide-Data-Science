This is a fantastic recipe for Cheesecake lover's but you must double the recipe if not at least increase by half. If you don't you will end up with a pretty pathetic looking cheesecake.

Very good Cheesecake, my family raved about it.  Although, next time I will double the recipe to better fit my pan.  It came out a little short.

I changed mine slightly by leaving out all the stuff to make the spice crust.. All I used were the graham crackers and butter.  I also had to up the amount of cream cheese and other ingredients since my pan was bigger then 9 inches.  For the top all I put was caramel, but the items used to make the actual cheesecake part I have to say made an awesome tasting cheesecake.

I took this to a dinner party and everyone just loved it. The crust is amazing and the caramel and nuts blend with the creamy cheesecake very well. Def a keeper!

excellent! not a crumb left on the plate.
I did not put pecans in the crust but added the spices (used allspice instead of apple pie spice) and the crust was what received many compliments!  thanks for sharing your recipe.

This was an OK cheesecake. The aftertaste is a tiny bit eggy- which really isn't my thing. The texture was ok- not very creamy but also not very grainy or dry. The crust wasn't crunchy or crips but it wasn't soggy either- had really nice flavor (had used allspice instead of apple pie spice) This might be because i left out the ground pecans and used instead flour. 

DEFINATELY DOUBLE FILLING. the end result of doubling is a cheese cake thats roughly 2" thick.  Watch the baking time- check it BEFORE the time is up 

ALSO...may i suggest instead of Ice cream caramel topping..
(which often tastes and looks a bit weak or fake...)

use caramel candies, some canned condensed milk, and a little bit of butterscotch liquer- melted in a sauce pan over the stove. The flavor will be much richer, the color more vibrant, and the caramel thicker.

I gave it three stars although if I could i would give it 3.5 because it is VERY EASY TO MAKE, but the results are consequently not extraordinary.

I switched recipes in the middle of making my cheesecake for whatever reason and since I was kinda rushing I didn't read the reviews until after it was in the oven...  yeah!  you HAVE to double! it's less than a 1/2in thick!  Anyway, it was too late, luckily i didn't do this right before a dinner party or anything... I would have cried.  The only reason I didn't one star this recipe is because this crust is DELISH!  To be fair, let's rename it Caramel Crust Cake then there will be no confusion.

The cheesecake portion of this recipe would probably be the right amount to fill a ready-made graham cracker crust.  Definitely double it for a 9" springform pan.

Good Cheesecake. I used 3 packs of cream cheese and 3 eggs and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract but everything else stayed the same.  Probably next time I will cut the spices in half for the crust just because I thought it was a bit too spicy.

I wish I had read the reviews before I made this.  It definitely needs to be doubled because it was pathetically short and dry.

THE CRUST AND TOPPING WERE GREAT. HOWEVER I AM A BAKER AND THIS WAS A LUMPY TASTELESS CHEESECAKE. THE TEXTURE WAS VERY BAD AS WELL AS A VERY THIN CHEESECAKE. IF THE TOPPING AND CRUST WERE ON A CREAMY THINKER CHEESECAKE IT WOULD BE PERFECT.

I made this in a gluten free version for Thanksgiving.  I used gf graham crackers  and of course the pecans for the crust.  I followed the recipe exactly for the filling but I did double it and added 1tsp of lemon juice.  I did not add the caramel to the top when finished baking because I wasn't sure if everyone in my family would want the caramel.  As it turned out very few people wanted the caramel because the cheesecake was so delicious.  It was moist, creamy, and had a great flavor.  It was not eggy at all as one reviewer mentioned.  I will make again.

These were pretty good. For pecan lovers! Pecans on the top were a little too much  for my taste as the pecans in the crust were perfect.. My 7yr. old agrees with me but the hubby absolutely LOVED this cheesecake.
