This was a wonderful and easy recipe!!! We gobbled it all up!  I added 2 boneless, skinless cubed chicken breasts.  After heating the oil, I added the chicken and per a previous review, cooked it with minced garlic, a tsp of ginger and 1 tsp of lemon pepper.  Then I added a bag of frozen broccoli stir fry veggies (which not only has the broccoli but also carrots, red peppers, and mushrooms).  I then followed the recipe per normal.  The result was great! Tasted like we were eating out.  Thank you Trisha for sharing this EASY and tasty dish!

This recipe is a good place to start but you really need steamed rice to make a decent fried rice.  Par boiled fresh broccoli (not frozen) and some garlic also make a world of difference.  Served with Grilled Salmon II from this site.

This was a great recipe and very easy to do!  I added some ingredients such as garlic, hoisin sauce, marinated tofu, and flaked cooked chicken.  I also used normal rice that was already cooked.  But DO NOT use fresh cooked rice or else your dish will come out mushy.  Hope that helps out some people!

I didn't expect greatness from this recipe but I was pleasantly suprised!  Very simple but I really enjoyed it.  I used brown rice and added sesame oil to the cooking water to give more of an Asian taste.  Also used fresh broccoli.  Thanks for a tasty and simple recipe!

I love Chinese...I could eat it every other day!!  This was a really easy and tasty dish. Not to mention very healthy.  Since I'm eating solo tonight (hubby isn't feeling well and kids have a tummy virus) I'll be the only one evaluating.  We usually make a dish similar to this using cauliflower and omitting the soysauce.  I served this over rice rather than tossing it all together.  I didn't add the scallions because I was too lazy to chop them up, but didn't miss them.  I used a little more soy sauce than called for.  Thanks for a great recipe Trisha.

Fast easy recipe.  I will use again, it went well with my sweet and sour meatloaf.  I ended up adding more soy sauce because it didn't have enough flavor.  I used a pack of frozen stir fry vegetables I had in the freezer I also added a little garlic.  I may try adding some additional spices next time.

This is great, simple and tasty. I add about a pound of cut up chicken, sauteed with soy sauce, and it makes a great all-in-one dinner!

Went great with dinner,  loved the easiness as well as the mixture of rice and broccoli.   I added a little more soy sauce and pepper to spice it up.

This was a nice change from a sauce based stir fry.I was afraid the rice would get mushy when adding it to the broccoli but it didn't. I added pork cooked in garlic and ginger and it made for a nice main dish meal. I will try this recipe again.

Quick and simple meal. My only suggestion would be to taste the dish before adding salt. The soy sauce supplied enough saltiness for my preference.

I'm really new to cooking anything, and this recipe is the prefect starting point for anyone looking for an easy, customizable, and arguably healthy single dinner dish.  I steamed my brown rice first per others' suggestions, dumped half a bag of Asian medley veggies I had already in the freezer, and half a bag of frozen pre-cooked chicken strips broken into pieces into the pan when it calls for the broccoli.  I let that go casually while watching for the ice to melt and while I fried an egg, cut it up, and dumped it in.  This was more than enough for my husband and I, and it was delicious.  I manage to screw up almost anything the first try, but this was super easy, and I felt like a real chef throwing in whatever I had on hand.  I will turn to this one again and again.  Thanks so much!

I agree with the reviews that state that you should use fresh broccoli, and that garlic is a must!  And what tastes better is to add the uncooked scrambled eggs after adding the rice; it'll help distribute the egg better throughout the entire dish, while allowing it to stick to the rice, which will make the rice taste better.

Didn't add the salt - the soy sauce added enough.  I only added a few dashes of pepper and it was too much.  :(

This was a good, easy recipe. I added some yellow bell pepper and mushrooms because I had both on hand, but also to make the dish a little lower carb for my diabetic husband. I will make this again.

I make this very frequently.  It is easy and fast.  I have added other vegetables like peas and snap peas which went great with this recipe.  My kids won't try it so there are generally leftovers which don't last more than one day, it heats up in the microwave great.  Is excellent for lunch at work.

This recipe is easy and tastes great!  While cooking my sticky rice in the rice cooker, I was able to prepare and cook the broccoli (the only vegetable I used) and cook the scrambled egg, and then having enough time to clean up, and then mix the rice and soy sauce in.  This was very light and flavorful that was perfect for my lunch-time meal, and I added some left-over shrimp scampi I had last night on top which made the meal even better.  I didn't give this a 5 star simply because it wasn't as good as I've had before, but this was my first time preparing fried rice, and I know my ablities aren't as well as an oriental chef.  Overall, this recipe was worth making, and I do plan on preparing it again for my family.

This recipe was bland.  There was way too much rice for the other ingredients.  I would cut the rice in half if you want any flavor.

With some tinkering this could be a great recipe. As is, it doesn't have a lot of flavor. Soy sauce can only do so much. Fresh broccoli works well in this recipe. I'm going to make this again adding garlic, ginger and lemon pepper. And if you really like your food hot and spicy add some Kimchi!

This recipe is excellent! I added more garlic, doubled the eggs, and 1/4 of a 40 oz. of Steel Reserve. That gave a nice kick to it! I will definitely make this again - with or without the beer.

Easy and tastes good.  I usually add more soy sauce to taste.  I'd also recommend cooking the rice ahead of time and refrigerating for at 30 minutes or more.

Had a bunch of left over white rice in the fridge. On my way home after a long day at work; I thought "Hey what about fried rice".   This recipe was simple and I had everything on had. Such a great way to use the left over rice in a healthy and yummy way.   I added mushrooms, chopped yellow onions and 2 tablespoons oyster sauce. It was great. The kids love it.

I really liked this one.  I added some ginger and about 1/4 tsp minced garlic to the oil.  I also used teryaki sauce instead of soy.  My husband and I both enjoyed this with an Asian flavored chicken.

It was pretty good, but needed more flavor. The soy sauce wasn't enough. I threw in some garlic, but I felt like it needed even more - maybe some onion, red peppers or something to give it more of a punch. I don't think I'd make it again.. I'd just make up my own or find another recipe.

This recipe is good if you need somewhere to start off.  I cooked the rice in chicken broth, added pork which was marinated in some sherry cooking wine and soy sauce along with some ginger.
I also added snow peas.  This dish makes a lot so you can add more veggies so it can be eaten as a main dish.

I make this recipe but there are three ingredients that I must have in it besides whats listed to really relish the dish and that is one or two cloves of crushed garlic, around 1 teaspoon of minced fresh gingerroot fried with the onion(I keep a small bit of it in my freezer...keeps forever) and a couple of teaspoons of sugar.  This is great to make when my stir fries don't turn out as tasty as planned.

Very good recipe.  I used fresh broccoli and over estimated the amount I would need.  Also, I used a little more rice than the recipe called for.    I added three small teriyaki chicken breasts,cut and diced to the mix as well as a small can of water chestnuts.  As a result of the extra ingredients, I needed a lot more soy sauce than the recipe called for.  Once I got enough soy saunce mixed in, the recipe was truly delicious.  As quasi-Chinese recipes go, this isn't particularly elaborate, but tastes very good.  As others have said, you end up with a lot of food (which is fine, I'll have it for lunch tomorrow).

I'm trying to lose weight and this recipe is easy and low in fat.  This dish, however, is more like fried rice with broccoli and eggs.  Better as a side dish for the big eaters in your family.  Great for a simple, light meal.

Marvelous! This is a great dish! Versatility is very important in my kitchen simply because I have to work with what I have on hand.  I'm not stopping mid recipe because I just realized I'm out of something.  I've used this recipe many times and find that leftover cold cooked rice (white or brown)works best. Also, sometimes I put in a bit of hot sauce or hoisin sauce for kick. Not much though :) Not everyone likes "kick" :) and I've also added some Lawry oriental marinades for a bit of change. Couple of tablespoons here and there - and yum California style frozen veggies! YUMMMY! I love the ease of this and how it can become so many dishes!!! A true classic!

I was looking for something quick and simple for a package of Mann California Stir-Fry I had picked up on sale, and I had brown rice at home already and the other ingredients.    So I stir-fried the vegetables in the oil and added 2 tsp. of minced garlic, because I try to cut sodium wherever possible.  Followed the rest of the recipe, cut out the salt, added a tiny bit more pepper and reduced-sodium soy sauce.  Delicious.   Went really well with the brown rice.

You know that leftover white rice from the chinese restaurant? This is an easy and yummy use for it. Heat the veg oil then add the rice and crisp it up a bit. make room for the eggs scramble microwave the fresh broccoli add the scallions and the soysauce add a touch of sesame oil, a shake of chili oil and stir fry. wonderful side dish or add some marinated tofu or meat of chioce for a main dish. Delish!

I've made some changes of my own, and the meal has come out great! I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, then I added 1/2 cup of sliced mushrooms with chopped onion. I also boiled chicken and mixed some of it with rice before stiring it into the broccoli mixture. I also poured some chicken broth on the whole meal about 5 minutes before it was ready (let it get absorbed in it). I'm not a big fan of soy sauces so I didn't use one here. All in  all, the dish looked great and everybody liked it!

I really liked this recipe and actually added 2 zuchinni's,bean sprouts and an extra egg. It was very easy and quick to make and my kids ate it up quick. Very easy on the tastebuds.

This was very good.  I only made one change and added additional soy sauce to it once it was made for a little more flavor.  I made it for my stepdaughter's lingerie party and it was a hit!

I made a lot of changes, but I think that proves how flexible this recipe is.  I scaled to 4 servings, used frozen chopped broccoli, white onion and cut the rice to half a cup.  It's not exactly fried rice, but it's very fast and tasty.

A tasty and VERY easy recipe to make.  I didn't have any eggs and it still turned 
out fine.  It's not very flavourful but it is very nice with some red peppers and 
frozen stir fry veggies.  I also added a little chicken to give flavour.  Try adding 
some soy sauce to the veggies and chicken while they cook up. It helps the 
flavour to sink in.  The spices I added were also very useful.  A good base to 
build from for my first time ever making stir fry!  Thanks for your help!  I wish 
every university student knew about this site!

Not a bad start, but trying throwing in some of your own stuff.  I doubled up the eggs, and added some hoison sauce for extra flavor.  Also, try other veggies--I used carrots and green bell peppers.  Also tried cooking the rice in chicken broth (as recommended here), which added flavor.

To much rice. Very little flavor.
Suggestion:
     decrease rice to one cup and cook rice in chicken broth

It tasted extrememly good, although my son wasn't too interested in the broccoli.  Next time i will add a little bit more eggs.  Overall, it tasted excellent, and i recommend it to any one who loves the taste of broccoli and rice

I just loved it! I also added some germs to it- and it turned out really good. However, you could use some more soy-sauce and spices since it really makes a large dish.

Would have given it 5star if it had enough seasoning. I added few fresh veg-carrot, bell peppers, zucchini along with fresh broccoli that i  had par-boiled.Also sauted1large white onion with 2tsminced ginger&1ts garlic.For the quantity it definitely needed more salt-3ts,6tb soy sauce,2 tb chilli vinegar,3tb teriyaki sauce.Else it tasted bland.make sure to cook the veg. to desired softness(medium heat) before adding rice.Thanks.

I made this last night along with the easy garlic broiled chicken recipe from here that I make often. The rice was delicious. I omitted the onions, used brown rice & added a little more soy sauce (reduced sodium soy sauce). My husband couldn't eat enough!

I used this recipe as a base like many other reviewers. I added boneless skinless cubed chicken and cooked it in lemon pepper, oil, garlic and red pepper flakes. I love eggs so I added an extra egg to the recipe as well to make sure most of my bites had some, I was also generous with the soy sauce and didn't really measure it out by any other measuring system aside from taste tests. Once everything was mixed together I also added a generous amount of sriracha sauce (we love spicy in my family) and it made for an amazing main dish.

This recipe was a godsend!  I was looking last minute for a quick and easy side for a citrus/soy marinated grilled pork chops and I found this.  Didn't have any fresh vegetables, so against everyone's advice I subbed a frozen broccali, cauliflower and carrot mix.  It worked, but only because I thawed it in the fry pan and moved it around only until it didn't look frozen anymore. Added the green onions and put mix in covered bowl while I scrambled the eggs.  Added back in with the rice (only had a 1 1/2 c precooked on hand) and soy - used 1 TBS (because I didn't have much rice), 1 clove minced garlic and sprinkled in about a 1/2 t of ginger.  SO GOOD!  Family loved it more than the pork chops...  Will definitely make again because it was so easy, but I would love to be a little more prepared and try it again with fresh veggies.

A good basic broccoli and rice recipe! I used fresh broccoli, some chopped garlic, and steamed rice. Even my 2 year old enjoyed it. Thank you.

This was delicious and sooooo easy!! I added mushrooms for a little something extra and I thought it was kind of a lot of broccoli so I wanted something else to  balance it out. I also scrambled three eggs instead of two, next time I might even add one more, but I love eggs. I used Jasmine rice too for a different flavor, but I think brown or wild rice would be awesome too. Overall, this was a great recipe. I'll definitely make it again and there was plently left over for work the next day!

I was not expecting much from this recipe at first as it is so basic and simple. I made it for myself, my girlfriend and Mum. We all enjoyed it thoroughly and I will be making it again for sure. :)

I used brown rice and it turned out kind of mushy, it was OK, but I also used frozen broccoli, fresh would probably be better.

This tasted good but too much rice for the amount of vegetables and soy sauce. So either the vegetables have to be increased or rice has to be reduced. Soy sauce has to be definitely increased. And it becomes mushy also, so next time, if I make this, I am going to serve broccoli over rice instead of mixing.

I served it with brocolli beef which turned out to be a little too much brocolli, but it was still good.

This was really good!  I made 1/2 recipe, and used fresh broccoli that I cooked in the microwave a bit.  I also added the leftover mix from my eggrolls (after I ran out of wrappers).  The only problem I had was with the rice sticking a bit as it cooked-I had to keep adding water.  I will add 1 more egg to the recipe the next time I make it; it didn't seem to have enough for my liking.

This recipe was EASY and DELICIOUS. Even the broccoli dislikers in my family loved it. I did add slighly more soy sauce than the recipe called for, but other than that it was great. I will make this again. Thank you for the post!

Good, but I added chicken, snow peas, julienned carrots, bean sprouts, and red bell peppers to add some substance to it. It was much better the second day.

If you are looking for a side item that will compliment a main entree in the oriental realm, this is it.  Because the flavor is subdued, it will not overpower a main course.  

If you are looking for something a bit more edgy, add some of your favorite spices, broth, or even chicken.  Also, if you are not so keen on carbs, cut back on the rice-this recipe is rice heavy.

Don't cook the broccoli for too long.

I found this to be a great recipe and is easy to tailor to your family's taste buds.  We added a carrot and will cut back on the rice for next time.  This recipe will be fun to play with each time.  Thanks Trisha!

This was a very good and simple stir fry.  This was my first stir fry and my family loved it. I made it 2 weeks ago and I'm making it again today. I did alter it a little by adding 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and chicken.It was a very tasty touch.

This recipe was very bland.  I used fresh broccoli, instead of frozen and added much more soy sauce than it called for and it was still pretty bland and boring.  Maybe if you added some more spices it would be better, but I don't think i'll make this one again.

I had some leftover rice so I decided to make this recipe with it. I omitted the vegetables and used diced cooked chicken instead, adding it to the pan at the same time as the rice. My husband loved it.

Nice way to get your carbs and veggies in one side dish-
