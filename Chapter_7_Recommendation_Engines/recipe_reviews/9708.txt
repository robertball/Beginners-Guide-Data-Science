I am munching on one now...OMG..
I put a teeny bit of icing drizzle on it, threw in some toasted walnuts, white chocolate chips , a 1/4 c oatmeal and 1/2 cranberries...my kids ate 5 a piece. There is no squashy taste at all. not that it's bad-I love squash) 
All in all, this recipe ROCKS! Think I might make them in Muffin top cups. ok, enough typing, must eat another one...

These cookies were very good.  My 3 boys (including a 14th month old) loved them.  They are a much more healthy snack than other cookies.  The only changes I made was to cut back just slightly on the nutmeg and ginger.  I also frosted half of them with a cream cheese frosting. (cream cheese, powdered sugar, butter and vanilla).  They are definitely something we will make again.

I just baked these and they're great. I used butternut squash. We left out the raisins at my mother's request. They aren't really like cookies, more like little mini-muffins or cakes (all that baking powder). The taste is excellent! Will definitely make again.

Wonderful and fool-proof and different (in a good way). I'm a cook, not a baker, but these turned out perfectly all three times I've made them! I use acorn squash (they're the perfect size for one recipe) and dried cranberries instead of raisins.
If you're making these for the first time, do not put them in the oven for longer than the recipe says! They will seem under-cooked when you first take them out, but they firm up a bit when cooled.

This is a fun way to get folks to eat squash.  I thought they were very good.  Even my husband liked them, and he is not a squash guy.  I would recommend very careful portioning as you put the cookies onto the sheet.  These are very cake-like cookies, so watch your bottoms as they can burn easily.

Great recipe! I've made this with acorn squash and sugar pie pumpkin with equally great results. Also sub half the ap flour with whole wheat white flour. And sub the nuts and raisins with an equal amount of rolled oats, dried cranberries, and choc chips...

These were great.  I don't have a sweet tooth, so I cut back on the sugar a little bit, and I skipped the raisins as I wasn't in the mood.  I used walnuts as I didn't have pecans, and I halved the recipe for our two-person household.  I love the muffin like texture.  I think it could stand up to more spice, so don't skimp on it.  Worked well at 6,000+ feet.

These cookies are so good!  They are cake-like, or like muffin tops.  The spice blend is perfect.  I used only 1/4 cup of white sugar (plus the 3/4 brown sugar).  I used 1 1/2 c. flour and 1 c. whole wheat flour.  I don't bake cookies very often, but I'll definitely make these again.

I excluded nuts (due to allergies) and substituted 2 tsp of pumpkin spice for all spices. They are a wonderfully soft cookie.

I made these with butternut squash and left out the nuts. These have a nice flavor and texture, with the consistency of muffin tops as other have mentioned. The next time I make them I will likely double the spices because I found the spiciness fairly mild.

I ended up putting the batter in muffin cups because it was so thin. The recipe called for 2 tsp baking powder so they rose up and everything. Substituted walnuts for pecans and craisins for raisins- Delicious!!

I had to bake them for about 20 min but they are very good and I'm sure that they will taste great with a browned butter frosting! I also baked them without the add in's and divided the batter up baking some plain with nothing added, one with dried cherries and one with dried cherries and cranberries. there dose need to be some kind of nut in the cookie. It need the texture of the nuts

I personally like this recipe as did a good majority of the people that tried the cookies. However my boys (husband included) are picky, suspicous eaters and anything that includes healthy ingredients or  modifications (I used Baking Spenda for the sugar and mixed some molasses in with more Baking Splend for the brown sugar. Part of the white flour was replaced with whole wheat flour)  are instantly flagged. They hated these. Although I suspect had they not seen the squash going in to the bowl they'd have like them just fine. A good seasonal recipe for holiday cooking. I'll make again.

Excellent! It definitely is more cake-like than cookie so I will probably try it as a muffin next time. I ate 3 of them in one sitting they were so good!

Fantastic - they remind me of a pumpkin cookie I make around Christmas.  I did the recipe exactly as stated except I only had 1/2 cup of raisins so I used 1/2 cup raisins and 1/2 cup cranberries.  My boyfriend the squash lover will definitely enjoy these.

These cookies really hit the spot on a cold night! As others recommended, I cut down on the sugar. I used the full amount of brown sugar but half the white, and that seemed like a good compromise. I added  a few peanut butter chips because I didn't have any chocolate chips, but the flavor was masked by the cookie, so I guess it would have been better to leave those extra calories out! I also agree against skimping on the spices (in fact, I probably added a little more than stated). These would be great with some spiced cider!

I have more squash than I know what to do with and this will definitely use them up.  i may have used too much water to puree my squash and so we ended up with batter and muffins (375* @ 12 minutes). I also was short allspice and nutmeg (i know that kind of makes the muffin) but they were still amazing. The 3rd dozen are cooking and I have only 4 from the first 24 uneaten. My pre-preschool kids (4, 3, & 3) love them. We were going to frost them but there is no need to.

This was a good way to use up extra squash left over from making baby food. I did make alterations however, so my review is biased. Changes: 2 cups pureed squash, 2 cups dark chocolate chips, and decreased sugars to 1/2 cups instead, and omitted ginger, allspice, raisins, and pecans, and no baking powder...so in all my cookies are probably pretty different from the original, but they turned out delish, and are very moist, chewy, and kinda cakey...

These are pretty delicious. Though hubby says there's an off taste to the cookies because of the butternut squash. The coworkers seem to love them fine. The cookies spread like crazy but then they rise. I'd prefer pumpkin or carrot cake cookies over squash cookies.

I love this recipe. These taste the same as the cake-like pumpkin chocolate chip cookies that are sold in the stores in fall.  I left out the pecans and added chocolate chips instead of raisins.  I think I would like a stronger flavor than what I got out of my buttternut squash, so I will try pumpkin next time.

Wonderful cookies! I only had a cup of the squash so I put in 1/2 cup apple sauce. I left out the raisins and nuts as I didn't have any and added extra spice to it. Dusted them with powdered sugar once out of the oven :-)

These are very good. We left out the raisins and pecans and threw in some chocolate chips. I agree with other reviewers that they are very cake-like rather than cookie-like but there's nothing wrong with that. They last a long time and what a great way to use up butternut squash and get my kids to eat it!

These cookies were quite good.  I love butternut squash, and the spices complemented it really well.  I added chocolate chips for my husband.  Next time I think I'll add some canned pumpkin to the mix just to intensify the squash taste because it was pretty mild in the finished cookies.  The best part of making these was the smell of the batter.  I couldn't believe how good it smelled!

I had some leftover squash and wondered if it could be made into cookies like I would with pumpkin.  These are just as good if not better.  I was really surprised at how delicious they are.  I don't like nuts in baked goods so I left out the pecans but added milk chocolate chips. Oh so good.

Great recipe! We used delicata squash, thanks to a bumper crop of 'em... and they made a very pleasant cookie! Very light and cake-like; we left out the raisins and only used a few pecans, but I'm glad we did; we were going to leave them out entirely, but they add something nice to the texture. Overall, a great recipe, and thanks for sharing!

Ooh la la! Don't expect the usual crunchy cookie - these are pleasantly cake-like. I added chocolate chips instead of nuts & raisins and had great results. These are quite sweet - and are great with a glass of milk - and they're good with a little cream cheese frosting, too.

I used left over winter squash with these. The only thing I did different is plump the raisins by briefly boiling them and then cooling before adding to the batter. Mine were soft - tasted a little like a muffin. It may have been the little bit of extra moisture from the raisins. If I were to do it again I'd add 1/4 cup more flour. We have been gobbling them up.

These are super good!  I used Bob's gluten free all purpose baking flour and a butternut squash.  I reduced the white and brown sugars each to 1/2 cup.  I also substituted 1/4 cup coconut oil for half of the butter (so I used 1/4 cup each butter and coconut oil).  I didn't have all spice or nuts, so I omitted them.  Finally, I used dried cranberries instead of raisins.

I like the taste, but the texture was a little strange, probably because I used some wheat flour. The taste didn't knock my socks off, but it really tasted like autumn, if your autumn tastes like cinnamon and squash (mine does!). Next time I want to add some applesauce and reduce the amount of flour to see if I can get it a little more chewy. 

I would make these again!

Yummy Fall cookie!  I used coconut oil instead of butter, coconut sugar instead of brown sugar, and rice flour to make them gluten-free.  I also used 2 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice instead of the individual spices and canned organic pumpkin for the squash. Will be making again :)

A wonderful taste, light texture! made this with butternut squash, reminiscent of a pumpkin pie flavor.

i used some pureed baby food squash. it was most likely the water in the puree, but the batter was far too runny to make cookies. it made one delicious loaf though! yum!

Wonderful!  I'm unsure what did it, but I ended up with batter and just poured it into two cake pans to keep it thin.  Ended up with really good squash bars - cakey, spicy, delicious! 
Substitutions (or what I used because this was a "just use house stuff up" endeavor: No allspice or cloves so I put 1/8 tsp extra cinnamon and 1/8 tsp extra nutmeg.  Instead of the listed sugars, I used 1 1/2 cups of raw sugar.  No raisins or pecans - since we usually keep almonds around, I'd like to see how slicing those in would work.  Only had 2 cups all-purpose flour, so used wheat flour for the rest.  I also added in an extra 1/2 cup of flour in an attempt to thicken the very thin batter a bit - wasn't enough to affect the taste.

These cookies are AWESOME! Dropped the nuts/raisins and added 2/3C of Hershey's Milk Chocolate Chips and 2/3C Hershey's Cinnamon Chips..Son Loves them!  They are like little cakes, or the ends of a Gob...might be good idea to make into a Gob for fundraisers!

These are some of my favorite cookies! I get lots of butternut squash from my local farm share & I look forward to making these every year. I substitute craisins for the raisins, because they look so pretty against the squash color, and walnuts for pecans (walnuts are healthier nuts) & I toast the nuts first. I have trouble not over-eating with these cookies around!

This recipe was excellent! The cookies are soft and stay soft for a few days after baking. They have a great, light flavor that my husband and I love. The next time I make these I'll cut the sugar a bit, but otherwise I wouldn't change a thing.

These were fantastic.  I'm not a huge sweets fan and these were not that sweet.  I even found them delicious in the morning with coffee.  Will definitely make these again.
