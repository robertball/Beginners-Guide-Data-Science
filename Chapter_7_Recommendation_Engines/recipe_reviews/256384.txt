This was so good! Very refreshing. It's in the middle of winter here, but it's still wonderful to drink after a long day :) In Southeast Asia limeade is sooo common because of the abundance of limes (and different kinds of limes!) -- I've had it in the past with a syrup base (water/sugar syrup), so honey added an interesting and delicious taste! Thanks for the recipe!!
