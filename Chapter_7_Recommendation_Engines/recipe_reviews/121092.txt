Because I had no oat flour, I followed the editor’s instructions of making the oat flour in the blender.  Then I added the rest of the ingredients in the blender and mixed.  Fast and easy with little clean-up.  I don’t know how excited you can get over waffles, but these were good and a little healthier than our usual waffles.  I served it with Blueberry Breakfast Sauce which I highly recommend and whipped cream.

Instead of 1 cup flour and 1 cup oat flour, I used two cups whole wheat flour. They turned out just fine. My family enjoyed them. Thanks for the recipe!

Wonderful recipe!  I used whole wheat flour in place of the white flour and crushed up oatmeal for the oat flour.  
Don't worry about the batter being too thin.  It cooks up perfectly and very light!  I served it with sugar free syrup, fresh raspberries, blueberries, peaches, and a bit of whipped cream on top.  I also heated up some veggie sausage links for added protein.  A+ recipe!

This is the ONLY waffle recipe that I use anymore.  I use the oat flour - and 1/2 cp wheat 1/2 cp white flour for the remaining - my dh doesn't like it with all wheat, but its a great way to get him to eat a little healthier!  Thanks for this recipe

I love this waffle recipe, and have made it several times.  I have made it several ways.  The first time I made it with all whole wheat flour.  It was the crispiest waffle recipe I had ever tried this way, even after freezing it and reheating it in the toaster.  The next time I used half whole wheat and half oat flour.  It had great flavor that way.  Since then, I make it half whole wheat, half oat flour and add about a cup of blueberries.  With the blueberries it is not as crispy, but still not soggy.  I cook the waffles for about 4 minutes.

This is a great tasting waffle I blended the oatmeal to make 1 cup of oat flour and I beat the egg white separately and folded them into the batter.

Made just as written but using 1% milk. Not having oat flour, I took the editor's suggestion and made my own. Works great.  Delicious waffles with terrific flavor. Allow the batter 5 to 10 minutes to thicken before cooking.

These tasted like a very basic waffle to me. Fresh, good texture, subtle taste, and pretty darn healthy, which I love. My kids gobbled them up. We topped with a blueberry sauce (similar to Blueberry Breakfast Sauce on this website, but w/ much less sugar). This will be our standard before school waffle recipe. Easy to prepare dry ingredients the night before, and finish in am in less than 5 min. Thanks Karen!

These were better then any packaged waffle mixes.  We loved them.  I used ground oatmeal as the editor suggested and used spelt flour in place of the all purpose.  So delicious and nutritious. I served them with low fat cottage cheese and berries.

YUM!!!  these were easy and so delicious, they were light and crisp.  Used my food processor to grind up some quick cooking oats and also replaced 1/3 cup of egg white substitute for each egg.  Made just enough for 4 of us to devour 2 waffles each, next time I will definitely double and freeze the extra waffles.

Delicious!!  Thank you for a diabetic friendly recipe for waffles.  My children and husband are thrilled.  The only thing I did different was I beat the egg whites separately and then folded them in at the end.  They were light and fluffly and had a great flavor.  Thanks again!

A good, solid waffle recipe - no complaints! I subbed whole wheat flour, as I didn't want to mess with processing oats into a flour. Not much more to say - just appreciated a healthier recipe option when my bf requested waffles this morning.

This is a good tasting recipe.  I expected it to be a little hardier with the oatmeal, but the waffles were just like normal waffles made without oatmeal.  I suppose that's a good thing for people who just want waffles, but a healthier choice.  I also used whole oats ground up in the blender.

This is a great recipe! It sort of tastes like the Kashi waffles I love but won't buy b/c they're so expensive. I blended the whole thing in my blender since I had to use it for the oat flour & I added 1/4 c of flax meal but I add that to all of my recipes for health reasons & it doesn't take away from the integrity of the recipe. I also subbed regular coconut milk b/c I'm lactose intolerant but again, it baked up like a regular waffle. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

Great recipe. I used whole grain oats blended  to flour in blender instead of quick oats to make it healthier and 1/2 cup white flour 1/2 cup wheat flour instead of all white flour. I used 1 Tbs canola oil and 1 Tbs applesauce to cut down on the oil. I also added a dash of nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, allspice - basically pumpkin pie spices which gave it a nice flavor. My kids loved it!

I didn`t really care for this recipe.  It was easy, the flavour was OK and I liked that it didn`t have a lot of fat in it compared to the other ones I`ve tried, but the texture was very dense.  Kind of like eating a brick.  Surprisingly, though, my 19 month old daughter ate them and won`t eat the other recipes I`ve tried.  I made it with half whole wheat flour and half all-purpose, so maybe I`ll try it with the oat flour next time.

These were fantastic waffles!  I omitted the all-purpose flour and used entirely gluten free oat flour.  I have to double or triple the recipe when I make it for my family now!  They're great fresh, and also toasted - my children will even eat them cold.  This has become my standard waffle recipe.

Easy simple recipe. They came out crispy and I loved the fact that they were semi-healthy :) I ate them with maple syrup, butter and fresh strawberries. What a great breakfast! Thank you for a keeper-recipe.

Did EXACTLY what the recipe said, and got EXACTLY what I love in a waffle, plus the benefits of oat flour and lower fat.  Light, airy, crisp outside, soft inside--perfect!

Very good. I used 1 cup whole wheat PASTRY flour (that's what I had) and made the oat flour as the editor mentioned. I accidentally used 1 T vanilla, but thought it actually was a good accident. I HALVED the oil (used LIGHT OLIVE OIL--has no olive flavor) with no problem. The waffle came out nicely, but not crisp on the outside, so I put it into my toaster oven to crisp. Nice mild flavor, not sweet. To improve, next time I will try with more sugar to give a little more pizzazz. I ate it with a protein shake, so it wasn't adorned with fruit, but totally plain... and the flavor was pretty good. Definitely worth working with and tweaking to your own taste!

These were very good and smelled amazing while cooking.  I subbed whole milk for fat-free (I don't believe fat free milk is healthy) and walnut oil for canola (no GMOs in our house).  Otherwise followed the recipe exactly (with all organic ingredients), but next time I would sub white whole wheat or spelt flour for the a-p flour.  I let the batter rest about 5 min while the waffle iron heated up and the batter got really nicely puffy from the baking powder.  We served these with a little butter and real maple syrup and they were delicious.  My children devoured them and asked for seconds.  Thanks for the recipe, it's definitely a keeper!   ETA:  made a half recipe of these this morning for my son who is allergic to wheat, diary,corn,  and egg.  I subbed 1 cup bob's red mill gf flour mix, 3/4 tsp xanthan gum, 1/4 cup egg substitute made from chia gel (1 T chia seeds and 1/4 cup water), 1/2 T organic sugar and 1/4 tsp sea salt (iodized usually contains corn), almond milk, walnut oil, 1/2 tsp raw vanilla powder, and hahn's natural baking powder (made with potato starch rather than gmo cornstarch).  He loved them and thought they tasted just like the "real" kind that he remembered.  With syrup, they were quite good given all the substitutions made, this recipe is very forgiving.

I've made this recipe three times now and find them very tasty. The one and only problem I have with them is a minor one and that is that they have a somewhat dry texture. This is easily fixed through the use of a little extra syrup ;)

I use this as a base for gluten-free waffles and they are fantastic. I put 1.5 cups gluten-free flour mix (rice, tapioca and potato starch), .5 cup almond flour (this gives it a richer flavor and adds protein) and use vanilla almond milk and walnut oil to make a little more healthy. Yum!

These waffles turned out really good. I replaced white flour with whole wheat white, sugar with stevia, canola oil with olive oil, milk with unsweetened almond milk. I also threw in about 1/4 cup frozen blueberries. I got 6 waffles. I'll be making these again. Thanks!

I am more of a pancake person, but these waffles were so delicious.  I followed the recipe; except I used coconut oil instead of canola oil.  TRUST ME THIS IS A GREAT SUBSITUTION- I would highly reccomend trying this recipe with the coconut oil.  I also used the apple cinnamon syrup recipe that I found on this website too!

My husband made these this morning and I told him these were the best waffles I had ever eaten. Honest. He used steel cut oats and put them in the food processor, then followed the rest of the recipe exactly. I am so excited these don't have tons of butter or oil. Thank you so much for this recipe!

easy alternative to the pre-made mix from the store.  The only addition I made was to add cinnamon to the dry mix.  It adds just a bit more flavor and my kids seem to use less syrup. Love these!

This was a nice waffle recipe. I was lazy and didn't have any oat flour and didn't feel like pulling my food processor out to make some so I instead just put in the one and one fourth cup quick cooking oats into the batter and it worked just fine. I made half plain and half with chocolate chips. Both were crunchy and tasted great. I'll probably be using this again!

Other than halving the recipe, I made these exactly as stated.  The yield is correct.  The oat flavour doesn't stand out, they just taste like a regular waffle-- but with the goodness of extra fibre.  I will make these again, but next time I will try doubling the vanilla since I couldn't really taste any.

Good, solid, healthy recipe.  I don't think you need as much milk as listed.  I used 1.5 cups and thought the batter was borderline too thin.  Taste is good.  I did add some chopped pecans which made for a fun change, texture-wise.

These waffles were fantastic! Great taste on their own, and they smelled just like oatmeal muffins when they were cooking!  I ate them with french vanilla yogurt, for a healthy twist on whipped cream, and threw some fresh strawberries ontop.  I won't be making any other waffles anymore, and I am going to rave to all my friends about this recipe!

I halved this recipe for 2 people. Though it made me 6 waffles. I used half WW flour and half AP flour. I also blended the oats to make the oat flour. They came out great and tasted healthy.

Simply amazing!  Seriously!  And what's even better is that instead of eggs I did the egg replacement of 1 tbsp ground flax and 3 tbsp hot water per egg!  No cholesterol and extra fibre sounds great to me!!!

Great waffles, will be a staple in my home!  I didn't have oat flour, so I put old fashioned oats in my blender and voila! Topped these with Blueberry Breakfast Sauce, it was the perfect pairing.

Delish!  I ground my own oats, so there were little bits of oats in the batter, but still good.  I added a dash of cinnamon & a dash of nutmeg, so good.  Love this topped w/ strawberry syrup & whipped cream.

My husband actually thought this was a mix from the store and we all thought that they were delicious!  I did use 1/2 whole wheat flour instead of all, all-purpose flour, ground up whole oats, 1/2 tsp. less aluminum free baking soda, almond milk, little extra vanilla & fructose sweetner.  They were wonderful!  Thank-you!

These waffles turned out excellent.  I did not have any oat flour, so I ground my regular oats in my food processor.  The batter seemed really thin at first, but thickened up after about 5 minutes of sitting.  They turned out perfectly brown and the family loved them!

These were wonderful!  I ground regular oats (not the quick cooking ones) for the oat flour.  I also added in some ground flax.  Next time I will try half white half whole wheat flour.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I used 1.25 cups of instant oats to make the oat flour. I used soy milk in place of fat-free milk as I'm lactose intolerant. Everything else I kept the same. I made both plain and blueberry waffles, and both turned out pretty well.  The only problem was that I had to cook these significantly longer than 4 minutes (more like 7 minutes) to get any sort of crispiness to the waffle.  Maybe it's my waffle iron.  It is new.  I was quite pleased with the flavor, and after the longer cooking period, I was much happier with the texture.  I will definitely make these again.

Turned out wonderful. I love cooking w/ oats but never thought of making oat flour. I added 1/4 c. oats to the blender at a time and it worked beautifully! Thanks for the originality! I also cut out the eggs and replaced the milk w/ beer (trying to make it vegan and using whatever I had left) and never even noticed!

Made these this morning...I warned my bf that they were 'healthy'...but he loved them! Don't expect them to taste like the eggy-sweet waffles that we're all used to, but with that in mind...they're amazing! Mine had chewy spots because I made my own oat flour and it still had some chunks but it didn't matter. I love that these have less than half of the calories of normal waffles....yum!

This recipe did not work for me. The batter was entirely to thin and didn't raise at all in the waffle iron and I was left with a flat mess. I ended up using the remaining batter for pancakes, this gave better results, however, the pancakes were really thin. The flavor was nice, I probably won't use this again.

OMG, these are the best waffles.  First time I went by the directions, and they were great.  However, the second time I added a little cinnamon.  These waffles are so wonderful and airy especially when served with the blueberry sauce....THANKS!!!! So a wonderful treat for dinner.

I chose this recipe because the calorie intake in the waffles is excellent, but I must say that there was a lack in flavor. I added two more tablespoons of sugar, one more teaspoon of salt, and one more teaspoon of vanilla extract. I also added strawberries to my mixture and then blended everything together. In the end, my waffles came out great.

This is one of the best waffle recipes I've ever tried.  They remind me of the kind my grandma used to make- crisp on the outside and airy on the inside.  Truly delicious.  I ran out of oil & used 2 melted TBS of Smart Balance Spread.  Gave a nice buttery taste

What a yummy recipe!!! I made these for Father's Day brunch for my hubby and 4 kids. They all LOVED them! The oatmeal really gives the waffles a yummy nutty flavor. The only thing I changed in the recipe was I used regular vegetable oil instead of the canola oil (it was all I had). I turned the waffle iron on pretty high and the waffles were crunchy on the outside and moist and delicious on the inside! They were light and fluffy. I tripled the recipe and froze what we didn't finish for breakfast.  They would also be delicious for dessert with strawberries and some fresh whipped cream! This is definitely our new waffle recipe! Thanks again!

Good recipe. Tweaked it a bit and added a dash of nutmeg and some cinnamon and they have the taste of a fresh oatmeal cookie for breakfast. I made oat flour but used regular oatmeal instead of quick oats and the batter was fine and texture of waffle was tender on inside and crispy on the outside. I will be making these again to freeze for a quick breakfast from the toaster.

These were very good! I put the oats in my blender and it worked very well turning it into oat flour. I used 1 whole egg + 1 egg white to lower the cholesterol a bit and they still turned out excellent.

Very tasty, quick and easy recipe!  I substituted the ½ cup of all purpose flour for ½ cup of whole wheat flour.(I changed servings yields from 8 to 4.) I also decreased the milk by a smidge.  The end result was scrumptious!  Thank you for this great and healthy recipe.

Great. I reduced the milk by 1/4 cup because it seemed runny to me. Used 1/4 white whole wheat flour (spring wheat) and 1/4 white, along with rolled oats that I ground in the food processor. Nice crunchy and oaty flavor, a little reminiscent of cornmeal.

This is great! I used 1 c. oat flour (processed in blender from oatmeal) and 1 c. spelt flour - delicious and my family doesn't know it is healthy! Thanks for this good recipe.

These were great! I didn't have the oat flour so I used the tip at the bottom of this recipe and ground up oatmeal. 

Everybody loved these!

Our family really likes these waffles and we've added fresh blueberries to the mix for an extra "kick".  Mmmmm-mmm good!

Great recipe!  The only changes I made was using 1 tsp of baking powder instead of 4.  It still came out fluffy and yummy :-)  Easy to make and tastes great.  My 22 months old son ate these plain and loved them!

I used 2 cups fresh ground kamut instead of all purpose and oat flour, and it turned out wonderfully.  Perfect waffle in everyway.  Would be heavenly with fresh blueberries and whipped cream.  Delish!

This is my new favorite waffle.  The oats add a lightness and a bit of a crunch that's lovely.  I love them smeared with berry jam, but they're versatile.
