We have created a feeding frenzy with this recipe on ribs.  It is the best rib bbq sauce there is.  We baste our ribs after we slow cook our baby back ribs for 4 hrs on low heat (250) with a cookie sheet full of water underneath the ribs - put ribs directly on oven rack. The key to take away the sweetness is to make sure you use a good, spicy rub - rub ribs before you place them in the oven or rub them the night before.  The spicier the better for the rub as the sweetness of the BBQ sauce totally compliments it. Also - make sure the BBQ sauce has cooled before using it - it goes on thicker.

Excellent!  I am rather picky about my barbeque sauce.  Most bottled varieties do not agree with my stomach, so I usually avoid barbeque sauce altogether.  However tonight I was looking for something different to make for dinner, and found this recipe.  I made 1/2 batch of it and used it on boneless pork chops.  Amazing!  I changed a few things as per other reviewers' suggestions.  
For 1/2 batch I: cut the sugar in half, using only a scant 1/2 cup; added 1/2 teaspoon of dried onion flakes; and added 1/4 teaspoon of Frank's Red Hot Sauce, for heat.  All of the other ingredients I left the same, in the proportions as stated (for 1/2 batch).  Next time I think I will cut the sugar even more, probably use 1/3 cup.  And I will add more Frank's Hot Sauce because my husband and I like our sauce to have a bit more of a kick.  Overall, this recipe is great, and the texture from the applesauce is wonderful.  I noticed right away that it does not have that "chemically" taste that bottled sauces have.  Very fresh, tangy, and tasty--this will definitely become my standard barbeque sauce recipe!

Much to sweet for my taste.  I used about 1/2 the sugar called for and still found it to be sickening sweet like a dessert topping.

I can't believe this recipe has 5 stars!  It is WAY WAY too sweet, and I cut down on the amount of sugar used.  None of my family liked the taste.  Definitely would not recommend or make again.  Needs some major tweaking to be acceptable.

I followed the suggestions by other reviewers and halved the brown sugar and I also used cinnamon apple sauce so i didn't add the other cinnamon and the result was absolutely wonderful.  This sauce is sweet and not for those who like hot and spicy.  For my friends and myself we loved it.

I used a little more than half the sugar and I thought the sauce was delicious!  I will use it again.

This dish was a hit with my picky 7 year old son, who hates chicken on the bone. He really liked this recipe and declared he would eat it again if i made it for him! That's a 5 in my book!!

This is a good sauce if you like sweet barbeque sauce.  I recommend only using 1 1/2 cups brown sugar.

My husband and 5 yr old son LOVE this barbeque sauce!  It is the first bbq sauce I have made or bought they would eat.  It is sweet, but that is alright by us.  I did reduce the amount of brown sugar by 1/2 cup (but only because I ran out) and used all natural unsweetened applesauce because that is all I buy.  After making it, I put it in  the frig overnight then added to shredded pork in the crock pot.  The smell was wonderful, great smooth texture, and family pleasing taste.  Add easy to prepare and this is a winner for me.

I really enjoyed the flavor of this recipe. I used homemade chunky applesauce, then ran the sauce through the food processor to smooth it out. My husband thought it was too sweet, though. Next time I think I'll add a little more paprika for more kick.

I make my own applesauce so I know which type of apples I use in it. Bought applesauce can't list the exact amount of each apple in the container, just the types of apples used.  So even if the jar says unsweetened; the applesauce itself may be on the sweet side because of apples used. This recipe is sweet with 2 cups of brown sugar I agree but if made with applesauce made from just Granny Smith apples its not as sweet. So the biggest thing is taste test the applesauce and put in the amount of sugar you would use. Recipes are made to the owners taste and given to others as a basis for making  it theirs. If you like it as is that is good but otherwise go to your taste buds. Good Recipe.

Great Recipe!  I made it to go w/some leftover pork roast.  I did not have any ketchup on hand and used 4oz of tomato sauce and a few tablespoons of tomato paste.

I actually didn't make this recipe exactly because so many people had stated it was too sweet. I used unsweetened applesauce (homemade) and only 1 tablespoon ketchup because it is also sweet. I used canned diced tomatoes instead and put them in the food processor. Because we like some spice, I used the Aldi ones with green chiles. I then added the brown sugar to taste and used only about 1/4 cup. I haven't put it on my meatballs yet, but it tastes really good. I will be serving them as appetizer cocktail meatballs with this sauce on them in a crockpot.

I also cut down on the sugar, but I added diced jalapenos to give it a "little kick". The sweet/hot was fabulous. Worked real well on wings.

I made this Sunday to go on ribs. It was very tasty and the whole family loved it!! The ONLY thing is that it IS too sweet but next time I make this I'll cut back on the sugar. I also added some hot sauce to give it a little bite. I had leftovers for lunch today and am going to be canning some jars of this...excellent sauce! I cant wait to try it on chicken next.

V. good and so easy to make.  I did decrease the sugar down to my taste.  I still gave it a five star, b/c you should try this with the alteration.

This is the best barbeque sauce for any meat. I made baked chicken thighs with this sauce, and it was the most delicious chicken I've ever had. It's sweet, tangy, and juicy. Some reviewer here had said that this sauce is way too sweet. I disagree. It does taste realy sweet when you taste it right when it is cooked and hot, but when it is cooled down, the sharpness of sweet taste goes away as it thickens. Definitely recommended!

This is so delicious. I substituted bottled barbeque sauce for the ketchup. Also, I replaced the garlic powder with one clove of fresh garlic. Here's another suggestion: try this in the recipe on this site for "Brown Sugar Meatloaf" submitted by Starbuck. What a sweet delight!

I used this recipe for a Pig Roast.  It was very easy to prepare.  I used only 1 cup of brown sugar and it was plenty sweet! Very good.

To me, this tasted exactly like cinnamon applesauce with a little bit or ketchup mixed in. I'm not sure if its the amount of applesauce or what, but I didn't particularly like the flavor or the texture. However, after quite a bit of tinkering to make it taste more like barbeque sauce, it tasted ok on pork chops.

I had no paprika so I used chili powder but only 1/4 tsp instead of 1/2.  Also wanted it quicker than the stove would have called for so I used the microwave in 2 minute bouts until blended to the consistency I wanted. Very interesting flavor! Will be cooking Tilapia with it in the crockpot on low for 4 hours.

This sauce was too sweet for my taste. It tasted more like a duck/sweet & sour sauce. The texture of the sauce was a bit too "granular or gritty".  This was due to the texture of the applesauce used in it.  Changing to a smoother applesauce would remedy that.

I also halved the sugar and still it was just too sweet for us.  I even put a little bit of liquid smoke in it and just couldn't get it to taste the way we wanted.  Probably just not the recipe for us.

Sorry to rate it so low, but it was much too sweet. I took the advice of others and reduced the amount of sugar to 1 cup and I still couldn't eat it. It's more like a sweet and sour/duck sauce than the barbeque sauce I am used to.

This tastes just as good as the famous apple bbq sauce served at Montana's restaraunt, and so easy to make. I spread it over chicken and bake in the oven, brushing more on every 15 minutes or so to get a nice thick coating as it bakes on. My family loves it.

OMG, is this tooo sweet!  I mean, it really is way too sweet!!  I didn't read the other comments from reviewers saying to half the sugar, so I tried to balance it out by adding about 3 times the amount of ketchup to take away some of the sweetness.  It is still sweeter than I like, but closer to what I was looking for.  I am giving it a 4 star, only because it needs the tinkering advice of reviewers to get it to come out right.  Otherwise, a very good sauce.  I made two different bbq sauces today.  Kathy's Award Winning (from this site) and this one, and this one is definitely better than Kathy's for those looking for a less tangy bbq sauce.  Thanks and I am sure it will be perfect next time with half the sugar!!

We put this on chicken and it was very tasty.  The whole family enjoyed the sweet taste that the applesauce added.

Absolutely delicious! I have made this for pork tenderloin and drizzled it on top as well as a topping for meatloaf. Both of my kids love it!

Awsome BBQ sauce.  The only thing I did was double the receipe and added liquid smoke.  Added this to some pulled chicken.  Family loved it.  Thank you for sharing!

4 stars because it was a great starting pt.  Tried it as written, found it too sweet for my taste.  Changed it a bit the next go-around to taste more like bbq sauce: used smoked paprika and increased the amount to 1 tsp, used 2 tbsp tomato paste and 1/2c water instead of ketchup, only used 5 tbsp of lemon juice, and added 1/2 ts chili powder. Simmered until sauce clinged to spoon. Still sweet, but with a smoky flavor as well.  Loved the applesauce idea!!  Cans very nicely.

After seeing the ingredients, I was a little dubious about this, but it turned out really well.  Next time, I think that I will add a bit more paprika and garlic, but it was really yummy on chicken.

Loved it! Great flavor.... yes sweet, but what do expect with 2 cups brown sugar. I had to read carefully it said UN-PACKED brown sugar. 2nd was a little less sweet & Delious! Will be making time & time again.

This turned out quite well with a few modifications. I only used 3/4c brown sugar, and I replaced the lemon juice with rice vinegar because I ran out of lemons.  The original recipe definitely calls for way too much sugar though

Okay, so I made this for the first time well over a year ago. I just never thought to rate/review it. I use this sauce on my steaks and pork chops. I really like it alot. It keeps well in the fridge....I think it actually gets better with age (much like myself, Haha).

As called for, I could see how this recipe would be really sweet. I actually flipped the apple sauce/ketchup measurements, so I had more ketchup than applesauce...plus I cut the sugar in half.  I also added a few dashes of apple cider vinegar and chile powder. All in all it was great....I picked this recipe in particular especially because it called for applesauce, whereas most recipes call for water.  This way, youre adding essential liquid AND flavor!!

I followed the recipe as written, very easy to make. I used it with chicken and it was good. You can definitely taste the applesauce. I plan on making it again but using it in the crockpot with boneless porkchops and sliced apples, I think it will be even better with pork.

We really liked this sauce.  It is sweet, and if you like sweet barbeque sauces chances are this one will be a hit.  The only change I made was to decrease the sugar by half.  Since I used a sweetened applesauce this worked well.

I took other reviewers' advice and halved the sugar too. I thought this had a nice tangy zip to it, and it was really easy to make, but I don't think it had distinctive enough a taste for me to make it regularly. Thanks, though!

The best!!!!  The only change I made, was using chunky applesauce.  I love to put it on pork tenderloin, and chicken breasts before grilling.  I also plan on giving as gifts this Christmas to hairdresser, bus driver, and my butcher!

I had no idea what I was going to do with all the Crabapples I had, except to make applesauce out of them. I looked in this site and saw this recipe. Everyone really liked it. I made alot and froze it in containers. Will use it all year long, on Chicken or Pork Thank you so much.

this was a good base but I added 1/2 cup of apple cider vinegar, 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne, doubled the salt and used unsweetened organic applesauce. this made for a tangy, sweet, and spicy bbq sauce.  I love how quick and easy this is. I threw the mixture in the crockpot with a bottle of boylan's rootbeer and 4lbs of pork butt for pulled pork. I can't wait to taste it!

While I'm generally in the camp of "You can't have too much sugar!", reviewing the recipe purely on what is written, it was so sweet I thought I would enter a sugar coma and never return.  So, next time around, I halved the sugar and used unsweetened applesauce- still had complaints that it was too sugary, but *I* enjoyed it.  The applesauce adds a nice element to an otherwise standard sauce recipe...I add a little Hot Sauce and it was delicious.

Very good. Like other users, I only used 1 1/4 cup of brown sugar. Next time I will use only 1 cup. I also found it was runnier than I would have liked (even after putting it in the fridge). But very easy and my husband loved it.

I love this sauce!! I do not usually eat BBQ sauce, but I was looking for something to cook with Ribs and this was definitely a winner! I didn't change a thing as I like sweeter sauce vs. spicier.

I made this with homemade applesauce.  I also played with the recipe some by adding my favorite hot sauce.  I also decreased the sugar.  The mix of hot and sweet was dead on!  I used lime juice and red wine vinegar because I did not have lemon juice.  I put this on meat taken off a pork shoulder that I had roasted.  It was excellent.

i made it the first time with 1c sugar and this time with about 3/4c sugar.  better this time.  also, franks hot sauce for a little kick, next time i will try a seeded smoked chipotle pepper.  it's a yummy base.  everyone that tried it when i made it liked it!

Fantastic! I also toned the brown sugar down to about 1/3 cup. I just took a quick taste after it's been in the  fridge for several hours and it is an incredible mixture, the flavours really take turns on your taste buds. 5 stars!

OMG!! This is sooooo good!  I was nervous about some of the other reviews, so only used a little over half of the brown sugar.  It is amazing BBQ sauce! I cannot wait to make it again with another meat.  I poured it over meatballs and baked.  Thanks for this recipe!

I just tried this on chicken and it was pretty good. I did read some of the reviews and followed the advice to cut back on the sugar and use unsweetened applesauce. I was impressed enough to pass this around to some friends and I will probably use this recipe with my ribs later on.

This is an incredible sauce for pork!  I use it on ribs and it is close to perfect as is.  I tend to like my stuff a bit more on the spicy side so I add a little fresh crushed red pepper, but that is only for my taste.  Everyone in my fam love this recipe and I've been giving this as gift for the holidays.  Thanks for blessing us with this posting :)

I made this recipe for a family BBQ. I followed others advice and doubled the recipe but did not double the brown sugar.
Everyone loved it! DH's Uncle said it was the best chicken he has ever had.
Also, I baked the chicken on a low setting (275 or 300 degrees) with the sauce for an hour before grilling it. We have a hard time BBQ'ing and getting hte chicken fully cooked so this helped make sure it was done. Then we added a little more while it was BBQ'ed.

It was a hit at my house, We thought it was a little sweet, but it was still great. Next time I will only use half the brown sugar, and I think it will be perfect, Thank you for sharing your recipe.

My husband and I absolutely love this! I used a "kicked-up" ketchup rather than the ordinary kind and used Cinnamon Apple sauce so I didn't need ground cinnamon. I will always baste pork steaks with this sauce!

I pan fried chicken and simmered it with the sauce; it was nice.  I used 1 cup of brown sugar, & 3T lemon juice, and that seemed fine.  I added a little onion to counter the sweetness.   I accidently added 2T black pepper and yes that made it hot , but tolerable.  Would make it again .

I substituted Apple Butter for the Applesauce and found the taste to be excellent. sweet and tangy with a definite apple flavor. When I now sit down to some home grilled Texas BBQ, I can enjoy a taste of my Old Virginia Home.

This was a great start that you can flavor to your own taste. We used this to make slow cooker pulled chicken and wanted plenty of sauce. I had 4# of chicken, so I doubled everything except:
 no increase of salt; 
 1/2 C packed Brown Sugar;
 1/2 TBSP Mrs. Dash Southwest Chipotle seasoning for heat. It might be a little bit hot for some, but it did need some heat to calm the ketchup. We liked it when we sampled!

The smell of this cooking on the stove drove me mad because it smells so good. I added a splash of liquid smoke and used smoked paprika just to kick it up a notch. I also put in a bit of onion powder. Since we are Paleo in our house I also substituded the sugar for maple syrup.......was fantastic. A great base recipe that could be personalized in many ways...add minced onion.....tarragon......etc etc.

Great on pork roast! Only used 1/2 the brown sugar so it wouldn't be too sweet.  Marinated the roast in 1/2 the sauce for about 3 hours.  Used the rest of the sauce for basting and little bit to serve at the table.  Delicious!

I went to the grocery store after work and bought some chicken thighs.  My 1st thought was, I was going to bake them and finish on the grill with some left over bottled bbq sauce I had.  I got home and, to my dismay, there was no bbq sauce left.  I checked on allrecipes and found this recipe.  I had all the ingredients on hand.  I read some of the reviews and only used 1/2 of the brown sugar.  Other than that, I made it just the way it was written.  I baked the chicken for about 45 minutes at 350 degrees, in the oven, took it out and put it on the grill and brushed the sauce on it.  I didn't brush it real heavy, more of a glaze.  Ten to fifteen minutes later and it was done.  It was wonderful and I will certainly be using this recipe again!

This recipe saved my dinner tonight. I made the sauce yesterday and thought I would follow one reviewers instructions and bake at 175 for 2 hours and spread sauce over meat every 15 minutes. Well my oven died about 4 hours before I was going to start the meat and so I had already put in into a crock pot because I heard the Lord say to. Well, was I ever glad. After a couple of hours I took the meat and drained it and dipped it into the sauce and laid each piece back into the crock pot and turned it back on. I was really sweating not knowing how I was going to make the ribs taste good and not be sauceless. They came out perfect. I'll admit I did tweak the recipe a little. I make my own applesauce with sugar and cinnamon so I left out the cinnamon and 1/2 the sugar. I mada a second batch for dipping and didn't need it. THANK YOU for this recipe...

I was in a hurry so I cooked it in the microwave for about three minutes a batch. Then I used my immersion blender to make it smooth. 

This recipe saved my tail...and six pounds of freshly picked, peeled and sliced apples. I tried to make apple butter and left it cook overnight in the crockpot. It cooked too long or my pot was too hot and it burned. Not bad burned, but the flavour was off. I found and tried this recipe and it was wonderful. I am now canning it and have plenty to give friends as a welcome summer gift.

Hi, All!
    I just used this recipe, but I modified the ingredients.  For example, I used one cup, not two, of light brown sugar.  Also, I used cinnamon apple sauce, and not 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon.  After I mixed all my ingredients together, PRESTO!  The dish was superb!

This is a. Good sauce, only gave it 4 stars cause it would be better if it was thicker! But flavour is great!

It took some tweaking to get this to not taste like applesauce, but it worked in a pinch, and I'd use it again if I was out of regular barbeque sauce.

Used half the brown sugar per suggestions and found it sweet enough for me but not too sweet.  Didn't have all the lemon juice so substituted 4 tbsp of apple cider vinegar.  Doubled the pepper.  Tasted amazing!  Will make again.

I think this is about as good as it gets!!!  It is sweet as the brown sugar indicates but it is delishious!  I always use a southwest dry rub first, while my meat cooks and this barbeque sauce completes it.  Thanks so much for the wonderful recipe!

Gave this awesome recipe only a 4 instead of 5 because it uses way too much sugar.  The only change I made to the recipe is instead of 2 cups of sugar I used 1/2 and it was still sweet enough.  Used it over porkchops; YUMMO!

I have made this so many times and I love it. I made it for a friends pig roast about 5yrs ago and now everyone looks for it. Doesn't take long to disappear.  I also had a rib off with my Dad using this sauce (he says his ribs are the best), not so.... I won hands down.

You would never know by looking at the ingredients but this recipe is very good!  I added vinegar and it turned out amazing...just depends on if you like your sauce sweet or not.  Will use this from now on.

Wow. This sounded weird, but I had a can of applesauce that needed to be used up, so I decided to give it a try. It was fabulous on chicken. The applesauce kept the sauce from sliding off and the flavor is great. Cut the sugar to one cup - no more is needed. Spread lavishly over chicken pieces and bake on 350 for one hour covered and fifteen minutes uncovered.

On it's own the sauce is ok, but drag some slow cooker Kalua pork through it, and it takes it up to a whole new level. The applesauce was such an interesting idea and it really works.  Like others, I also decreased the sugar by more than half and put a splash of vinegar in as well as a shake of dry mustard and dried chopped onion. I'll use it again!

Good idea, but needs a little tweaking to take it from good to great.  Here's what I did:  add a couple drops of liquid smoke and half the sugar (and it was still way too sweet).  Could replace some of the brown sugar with honey to add a little depth.  After I doctored it, hubby and one of the three kids liked it.  If I add honey and do only 1/4 c. brown sugar, I think the other two will like it, too.  Thank you for the applesauce idea!

I made some tofu nuggets that I baked up like chicken- let me just say this is phenomenal!!!  I'm trying to keep away from eating it by the spoonful:)  

Like others I reduced the brown sugar by half and it's still very sweet.

Great recipe - with some changes.  I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar due to all the reviews that said it was too sweet (but I think it could handle more - but no more than 1 cup), plain unsweetened applesauce, left out the cinnamon and added about 1/4 tsp dried onion flakes.  Really good recipe!!

I loved this sauce, but of course changed it a little.  I added more garlic powder, threw in some crushed red pepper, and some dry mustard.  Had a nice sweet taste up front with some heat in the back.  Put this on some ribs I smoked.  I think Pork and Apples are a perfect match.

This recipe is so wonderful I have been searching for it  for over a year!  I made it for a bbq and gave away my printout to a friend who just had to have it, not realising I hadn't saved the recipe (I was new to allrecipes at the time).....I've been trying to make it from memory ever since.  Now I can make it for our BBQ this weekend and know I have it right!  I'm not a traditional BBQ sauce fan, so it's great to have an alternative.

I was making this for a large neighborhood party so 4x the recipe.  Everyone seemed to love it so much in the reviews that I thought it was a "no brainer" to use it.  WOW! This is VERY SWEET and VERY SPICY.  Also it had not much of a tomato taste, which I expect in a barbeque sauce.  I added 6 CANS of tomato sauce and 3/4 cup of lemon juice to try to dilute it and solve the problems.  I decided it was "useable".  I later heard from a friend that was at the party that the honey mustard sauce was good but she hadn't tried the barbeque sauce because someone told her that "It had a real kick to it".  My advice would be add less pepper and sugar.  It's easier to add ingredients later than to try to balance them out.
