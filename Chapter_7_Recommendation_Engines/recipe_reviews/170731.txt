I had a client that ate at a Lebanese restaurant and came to me with this request.  I marinated the cauliflower in garlic olive oil and then tossed on to a baking sheet = sprinkled with smoked paprika and into a 425 oven for about 25 minutes.  They loved it!

I've had this at an authentic Syrian restaurant and this tasted just like it! Place the cauliflower in the pan completely raw...I tried steaming it first, but it doesn't stay as crisp. Cook until the cauliflower browns...the darker it gets the better it tastes! I also added ground toasted sesame seeds and paprika to store-bought tahini.

I've been making a similar Syrian version for years. For those who thought the tahini is thick, you just need to add a little water to it to thin it out. Add a few drops at a time till you reach the thinness that you want.

Tried making this dish for the first time (although I ate a lot of similar things living in Jordan).  I agree that the browner the better on the cauliflower.  I fried one batch "golden" brown and one batch darker brown, and the darker definitely had a sweeter taste.  I also added a little paprika as suggested to the sauce.  One thing: I would go with a little less lemon juice next time...

my husband likes the fried cauliflower according to this recipe, but I don`t like mine this way (very greasy)so wat I do is boiling some water and add salt and cumin and cook the cauliflower pieces in it for less than 10 minutes or until it`s tender . then coat the cauliflower with eggs , water and flour mixture(it should be thick enough to coat the cauliflower )

The flavor was very good but the sauce was more like a paste so dipping was impossible.  We had to smear it on each piece with a small spreader.

Was fair tasting, but I was expecting more. It took longer to cook than suggested. I'll not fry the cauliflower next time.

I roasted the cauliflower instead of deep frying it. The tahini sauce reminded me a lot of Hollandaise sauce, very lemony. My husband didn't like it when he tasted it, but thought it was great on the cauliflower.  I'd make it again.

This review is for the sauce, since I have not made the cauliflower. But we love this sauce.  I make it to go in felafel wraps.  I do add a clove or two of extra garlic, but I add extra garlic to everything, it is just a personal preference.  It is super easy to make and super yummy.
