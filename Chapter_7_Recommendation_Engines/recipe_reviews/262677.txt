The author of this recipe had me until they suggested topping with ketchup. If it's a good omelet why would you even think of suggesting ketchup?

This is a nice breakfast that takes very little time to put together. The rice/veggie mixture is enough for a 4-egg omelet. I used red, whole grain rice, which gave it a nutty flavor that white rice can’t give. Using a spiralizer to cut the carrot and cucumber reduced cooking time. I wasn’t too fond of the taste of cucumber with this and will use zucchini next time instead. I also added fresh cayenne peppers to spice it up. Thank you for the recipe.
