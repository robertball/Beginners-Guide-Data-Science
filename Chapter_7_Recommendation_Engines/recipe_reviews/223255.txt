This turned out amazing. I tweaked it slightly by stirring the sugar into the blackberries instead of sprinkling on top. I had no blackberry juice (who ever would?) so I just put milk in the blackberries to add the right amount of liquid. It’s the best cobbler I’ve ever had! Next time I’m adding cinnamon!

Excellent non-traditional cobbler! Dough had a fluffy light consistency as opposed to the more traditional biscuit dough. However was still substantial enough to hold all the berries. Really good recipe, very simple and scalable (made 1 1/2 recipe). I used fresh blueberries and blackberries, and apple juice for the top liquid. Wonderful.

Very tasty! I added 1 tsp. of cinnamon as others suggested. Will definitely make again. Need to look at the amount of sugar used to top it off as I think I used a bit too much.

it was a great recipe and very easy to make but isn't much if a cobbler. it tastes more like a cake with berries on it, but all in all it was very tasty!

Sooo yummy! My family raved about it and ate it all in one sitting! I had to make more! My blackberries were picked two days ago and had been sitting in the fridge, so they were PLENTY juicy, I didn’t add any extra liquid. I also forgot to add the 1/2 cup of sugar on top, and when I tried the finished cobbler, I was so glad I did. It was PERFECT without the extra sugar. I love that there are like two steps and few ingredients. My new favorite blackberry recipe for sure.

Did not have a 9x9 pan so I used a deep pie dish. Easy and quick. We loved the flavor and the texture of the crust/biscuit. Can’t wait to try this with other fresh fruit like peaches!!

I've made a lot of cobblers over a lifetime and am always up for a new variations.  My husband has been waiting for me to find one that was reminiscent of the cobblers his Grandma brought out to the fields with lunch during haying.  This one finally hit it!  He took one bite and said, that's the one...don't make any other recipes....keep this one.  He did agree a bit of cinnamon would make the difference but even as is it's wonderful.  Thank you for sharing!

I doubled the recipe, but used slightly less sugar listed in the last step.
