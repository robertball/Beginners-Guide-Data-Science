This was delicious! I cut the recipe in half,  added a small can of mushrooms, and used 1 lb. ground beef and 1 lb. sausage. I was worried that there was SO much sauce for the amount of noodles, but it came out perfect! The noodles really did absorb the liquid.  Great dish for leftovers, too!

This was EXCELLENT!! I made this as directed minus the green peppers (was unfortunately out of them) plus threw in some minced garlic and mozzerella cheese and I was extremely happy with my dinner. The sauce was very differant than normal spaghetti sauce because it didn't have that strong tomatoe flavor - absolutely wonderful and a keeper!

My family loves this recipe!  I usually make only half the amount. The soups add a little richness and creaminess to the dish.

I'm rating this a 5, so that I don't upset the average. However, I haven't made this yet. I plan on doing so (half the recipe, though) for a New Year's potluck dinner with some close friends. However, I am a vegetarian and do not eat/cook meat, but this recipe is so unique, I want to try it. I saw another baked spaghetti recipe in which a reviewer simply omitted the meat and said it was fine. I plan on omitting the meat and adding a couple cans of mushrooms I have in the house along with garlic and mozzarella, maybe some fresh basil, too. What do you guys think? Will that probably make up for it, or will I have to adjust other aspects of the recipe? Thank you!

We love this recipe!  I've made it several times now.  Each time I made it, I changed it a little more to our tastes.  I only make one pan's worth and use 2 1/2 cups Ragu pizza sauce instead of tomato soup, use 1/2 pound pepperoni, 1/2 pound sauteed mushrooms (or can use a can), a can of sliced olives, and a cup of pre-cooked frozen baby shrimp instead of the hamburger and veggies written in the recipe.  Also leave out the cheese and sprinkle it on top for the last few minutes of cooking.  This has become one of our most beloved recipes.  While my version is slightly different (we used our favorite pizza toppings, yes my boyfriend LOVES shrimp on pizza), either way you make it you'll end up with a wonderful dish that's much more than plain old baked spaghetti.  The noodles suck up all the extra liquid, but the resulting tomato sauce is deliciously creamy.  Thank you!

Taste was pretty bland.  If we do this recipe again we will use something other than Tamato Soup.

Halved it but used one whole pepper.  Used the technique I saw on Rachael Ray to separate the ground beef, potato masher, works great.  Added a couple of cloves of minced garlic along with the onion, a handful each of frozen peas and corn plus some fresh mushrooms I had cooked and drained in the microwave.

This recipe is really tasty.  I used marinara spaghetti sauce instead of tomato soup, and instead of cream of mushroom i used fresh mushrooms, and sauteed them with green and serrano peppers, onions, and minced garlic.  It was very tasty, and had a nice kick to it.

This was really good. It was like a cross between spaghetti and Mexican casserole. I'm tired of spaghetti with meat sauce so this was a nice change of flavor. I changed it some. First I cut the recipe in half and so that I didn't dirty up so many pots and pans, I first cooked the meat with the onion and green pepper in a large pot until meat was browned and dumped it into a colander to drain. Then I filled up the same pot with water and boiled the pasta until al dente. Followed the recipe by putting the pasta in a 9 in. x 13 in. baking dish. I sprinkled the pasta with seasoning salt, chopped garlic, and Parmesan cheese then followed the recipe except I only had one can of tomato soup so I added some pizza sauce that I had frozen. Everyone really enjoyed it except my very picky 15 year old DS. He wouldn't even try it. Thanks for the recipe! This was a good way to get rid of some things in the pantry. I will be making this again.

This is a very good recipe for just regular ol' comfort food.  It's good for leftovers and the kids like it.  I used evaporated milk instead of regular and added a little salt, pepper, garlic powder, and minced garlic to the meat during browning.  I also think next time I'll use more noodles than the recipe calls for, but that's just personal preference for noodle to meat ratio.  I've made this a few times now and will again in the future I'm sure.  Thank you!!

LOVE!  I make multiple batches of this.  It freezes well and makes a great gift to a new mom or someone sick in need of some special attention.

I've made this quite a few times, and it has come out awesome. My husband has a GIANT appetite, so I don't scale down the recipe. I just freeze the extra. The only thing I do differently is to add some minced garlic to the ground beef, and I usually leave out the green peppers. Awesome recipe!

Cut this in half, use or leave out the green pepper, I leave it out, use 21 1/2 ounces spaghetti sauce instead of tomato soup, and cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom, if desired, and this is WONDERFUL!!! I have made it for friends, and my picky teenage Daughter even loves this. It was a huge hit with EVERYONE!!! Very little of the time can you make something, for two separate households, and everyone love it. Elderly, teenage, middle age, and all. I like to check out the others reviews and tweak, and this is what I came up with. I know it's not exactly the way it's written, but I don't care for green peppers or mushrooms, and wouldn't have eaten it the other way. Everyone loved the way I made it. Now for my friends family, she may add the peppers and use the mushroom soup next time, and even add other things. I am sure they will like it, but it won't taste exactly like mine. It's really good, and different than an Italian spaghetti bake. It's a change of pace!

Great recipe!  Very kid friendly. Even my husband liked it and he isn't much for casseroles/baked dishes  Easy to add your on touches or great just as the recipe states.

I made 1/4 of the recipe as it is only my husband & I.  Everything turned out well.  It was pretty easy to make and had a good taste to it.  The spaghetti did soak up all of the sauce.

Yum! I made with tri-color rotini instead of spaghetti.  I also didn't have an onion, so I used the green pepper and added fresh mushrooms.  Hubby and I both loved it!  Definitely will make again - would be great as a potluck.

This was very good.  I decided to use macaroni instead of the spaghetti, because that's what I had on hand.  It was certainly easy to make, and very tasty.  The only complaint I had was that it did boil over slightly in my oven when I baked it.  Aside from that, it's a winner!
