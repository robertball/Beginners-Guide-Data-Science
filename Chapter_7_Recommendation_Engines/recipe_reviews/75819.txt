I found a great improvement in the taste by using the kalamata olives in place of the black olives (Mezzetta brand has a pitted version so you don't have to deal with pitting them; I'm sure there are others). I also used marinated veggies (bottled giardiniera) in place of artichoke hearts, personal preference.  I had to look up a muffaletta sandwich online to complete this sandwich.  The basic version contains lettuce and tomato, ham and salami, provolone and of course this olive salad.  It's fabulous!

Thank you for submitting this recipe!  I've been a lover of olive salad for years and never thought i could make it taste right at home, but it's just like at the restaurant!  I halved the oil and vinegar and its perfect for me.  Thanks again!

Excellent salad, especially for one of my favorite sandwiches!  I used half kalamata and half black olives in addition to the green olives.  I also added some chopped roasted sweet red pepper for color and flavor, and fresh pressed garlic instead of the dried.  I've been looking for something like this ever since my friend brought home a jarred olive salad she bought in New Orleans, and this is even better!  Thanks!

Fantastic! I've been looking for a good olive salad recipe ever since we discovered muffalettas in N'Awlins four years ago ~ this is the closest I've tasted. It's great in almost any meat or meat and cheese sandwich ~ thanks!

Delicious!  I didn't end up using as much vinegar and olve oil, but we loved it.  I also baked 1 cup of it into the Mediterranean Black Olive bread recipe from this site, and it was heavenly.

This is more delicious if you let it sit overnight in the fridge, so the flavors can blend. Don't cut the oil in half!, per other reviewers, unless you're using this as a dip for crackers...the flavored oil soaks into the bread and helps to flavor the whole sandwich. Really good with mortadella ham, dry salami, and even turkey, and provolone cheese. I used emeril's muffaletta recipe for the meats, and I like to serve this at DH's poker games; never any leftovers!

YUM!  The original cookbook recipe I had called for an olive salad (black&green olives and celery... heavy on the vinegar) in the sandwich.  This was a FAR better addition!  Even though I didn't have artichokes on hand, it was wonderful; though I can't wait to try this the "right" way.  Also, I used white wine vinegar instead, and it was good.  A splendid salad fixing!  Thanks!

We really liked this salad on our muffalettas. I added fresh parsley, and roasted red peppers. I chopped it by hand to have a chunky salad.

So I JUST made a Muffaletta tonight just so I could make this olive salad. I've always been a fan of muffalettas, but when my parents have made them, they've always been a little plain, so that's why we dip ours in italian dressing. I wanted to make the sandwich better and less boring, so I made this salad. I have to admit, I was very nervous about it. While the pictures looked really good, I feared that the vinegar and the red onion would over power the flavor. But I took a risk, and kind of a big one and I made the salad, and I put a large amount on my sandwich, baked the sandwich. Took my first bite and WOW. So amazing. Definitely reminds me of my mom taking me to Jason's Deli. This was easy, and quick. I had to make mine in my blender, so mine's a little more liquidy than it probably would've been w/ a food processor, but that's okay, it's still delicious. I've already recommended it to my mom.

Served this at a party as a dip for crackers--was a big hit!  The onion was really strong though, will use less next time or a sweeter onion variety.

I loved this just on sliced baguettes- hubby not too sure.  Made a huge layered sandwich and this was only condiment I used.  Hubby said he'd rather have mayo and mustard, but I thought it was great.  Would make a lovely dip as a tapenade, or layered with cream cheese and pesto for a spread for the holidays.  I did use a couple more cloves of garlic.

OMGosh this is SO good! This recipe is going into my special "keepers" file! It is easy to prepare and simply delicious on broiled sandwiches. I have had olive salad in New Orleans and this is far superior to ANY I had there.

Loved this! Very tangy and flavorful.....my only change was to decrease the olive oil to 1/4c. Other than that I used red onion and kept all other ingredients the same. Made 24 hours in advance and used the next day on a muffuletta sandwich. Excellent!

Delicious! I made this as written, but used fresh minced garlic instead (about 2 cloves worth) and omitted the celery seed because I didn't have any.

Fantastic!  I think I could have used a bit more red wine vinegar, but I'll try it next time. Either way, it was wonderful by itself and on a sourdough hot ham and cheese sandwich. Thanks for the recipe!

I guess I'm going against the flow here but something was just too overpowering in this. I think maybe it was the oregano, so I'll try it again with less. On a positive note, I took this to our Thanksgiving dinner and my sister thought it was really good.

Very authentic NOLA flavor! Just a little too much of an onion aftertaste for me when eating it straight.  Hopefully when I put it on the Muffaletta sammich with the ham, salami and provolone it won't be as noticeable. I think next time I'll use 1/2 a small red onion or just rinse the onion with water before mixing it in to take the edge off.

After paying $15.00 for a jar of muffaletta I set out to find a recipe to make. This recipe is great!  It was so easy to make and I will use it for the holidays on cheese and cracker boards (it keeps in the fridge for quite some time).  I added 3-4 T of rinsed capers and some lemon juice to get the flavor that I was looking for.

this is not the recipe from the Central Grocery in the French Quarter that created the original Muffalatta sandwich. I have eaten there many times and this one lacks many of the original ingredients.

So very good and so very easy.  We love it and I will make it often.  I initially made it for muffalettas and they were perfect.  I can think of a lot of other things that this recipe will be perfect for.  We've already eaten it as a dip for crackers and straight out of the bowl!

I just made this for a birthday party.  I didn't want the onion to be real strong so instead of a whole onion I just used a thick slice from a large red onion. I also halved the olive oil, 1/4 cup was plenty IMO.  It makes a lot and it is delicious, tastes very authentic! I am going to toast some baguette to eat with it tomorrow. Very good!!

This stuff is fantastic!  I used store brand olives and artichoke hearts, and it still turned out great.

This is my mother's recipe. Only the best! This salad is very filling, but you never feel that weighted down, bloated feeling.

Very authentic if you are missing those New Orleans flavors! I also cut the red vinegar in 1/2 which worked, however, if you are going to keep it more than a couple days keep full amount so it doesn't dry out. Also great to just serve on french bread as snack. I think it may also mix well with cold pasta, haven't tried it though.

This recipe is great, both as a sandwich spread with turkey but also as a Tapanade (served with crackers).

Delicious! My husband and I attended a wedding and they served olive tapenada with sliced bagettes as an appetizer. He loved it and asked me to try and make it at home. I'm glad I found this recipe. Thanks for sharing it.

I made this pretty much as instructed except that I added a small jar of capers.  I chopped instead of blending so that it would be a little bit chunkier.  I am Keto, so I didn't make a Muffaletta Sandwich, but instead made a "Muffaletta-ish" Salad.  I used the olive salad and the olive oil for the dressing and as an ingredient over a bed of lettuce, ham, hard salami and jack cheese and the squeeze of a lemon wedge.  M-m-m-m-m!!!  Even my husband who is not Keto loved it!!!  The Olive Salad is way better after a day or two in the fridge so that the flavors blend.

This is fabulous. I did substitute one cup of giardiniera (Italian pickled vegetables) for the artichoke hearts. Otherwise it is perfect. We had it as an appetizer with slices of ciabatta bread and four of us ate the entire batch.

I used this after a holiday to get rid of all the leftover olives from a relish tray.  I felt there was enough oil from the artichokes hearts i only added about a Tbsp.  I also used balsamic vinegar because it was all I had. We served this on grilled cheeseburgers and was such a refreshing change from mustard or mayo or relish!

i followed the directions to this recipe exactly and i really did not care for it. it had to much liquid and with the amount of ingredients it made to much.
