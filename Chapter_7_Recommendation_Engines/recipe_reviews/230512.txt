Oh my gosh, this was so good! I could just eat it with a spoon and nothing else! I ended up only using 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes because I wasn't sure how spicy it would be, though next time I think I'll use a a whole tsp, as it wasn't particularly spicy. Once the wine reduced and thickened, I ran everything through my mini food processor, just to make it more spreadable. I served it on table water crackers with mini slices of Dubliner cheese. It was an absolute hit! Everyone raved about it. I can't wait to make it again! Thanks for the recipe!
