My recipe for Burnt sugar Icing is very similar as this one.  For those who want to try this in the future, and read the latter reviews, the seizing up of the caramel is normal.  You have to bring it back to a boil and redissolve the caranel, then continue with the recipe.  Also add a tablespoon of light corn syrup with the milk and sugar to help with early crystalization, which leads to graininess.  I like this recipe better than what most people consider caramel icing, which is really penuche. (nothing against penuche, that is yummy also)  This technique has a true caramel flavor.  Hope this helps everyone. ;-)

This was a disaster.  I followed the directions EXACTLY and when I added the 1/4 cup boiling water, the sugar immediately clumped together, became rock hard and stuck to the pan.  Don't know the trick to this but I wouldn't try it again.

part of the secret to this recipe is to use a cast iron skillet! It regulates heat better than regular pans.

I didn't realize how much work frosting is before engaging in this recipe. It took me more than 15 minutes to make, and I ended up with a rather thick mixture. Don't know what I did wrong, but probably didn't know when to stop boiling. We all really enjoyed the result, though, and I am calling it one of my favorites. Four stars because it took more than 15 minutes to make--cutting into my nap time! :)

This is a time consuming recipe, but the instructions were simple to understand.  The icing was FABULOUS!  It did set up when I added the boiling water, but after about 15 minutes it was liquid again.  After cooling I popped it back in the mixer for a few minutes and it looked just like my grandmother's caramel icing.  Tastes like it too.  The only bad thing is that my toddler picked that moment to get hurt so I walked away from the icing.  Upon my return it was already set up in the bowl.  After a minute in the microwave it was able to spread it on the cake and it set right back up.  Excellent recipe!  I doubled it with no problems whatsoever and the only change I made was a little extra salt because it tasted really sweet... possibly from doubling the recipe though. Thumbs up!  I'll try this one again!

It sounded interesting, but this was awful - like a previous reviewer, my sugar seized up as soon as I added the boiling water.  I thought adding the other ingredients (ie more liquid) would alleviate the problem, but the whole thing become one huge hard rock!  I now have brittle instead of icing.  

I think the trick is not to over-caramelize the sugar - add the water BEFORE the sugar melts and recrystalizes.  Once the crystals form, you're in trouble.

it was probably my fault but this turned out rock hard, i think the problem was that i thought the soft ball stage meant it turned into a soft ball but really it must just mean you have to use a candy thermometer to see when it reaches the soft ball temperature.  however i just added some milk and microwaved it to remelt and it tasted great, however doing it this way it made a sauce which i did put on my cupcakes and it tasted amazing especially while still warm...will try again but using the candy thermometer and hope for better results

Yummy stuff! I had never heard of this when my dad requested it for his bday...having never made any type of cooked candy before, I had some problems, but found some solutions  online: the first attempt, I melted the sugar over low in a cast iron skillet per another suggestion and it still crystalized (and turned a yucky grey). I made it in a large, heavy saucepan. Instead of stirring the sugar alone, I added the water, stirring til dissolved, then left it alone over low heat. This way, the sugar caramelized on its own, and I just tilted the pan periodically. Once it was a nice amber color, I slowly stirred in the remaining ingredients (I, too, added a tablespoon of corn syrup). I thought all was lost--the "burnt" sugar was all stuck at the bottom of the pan. But I stuck it out, stirring constantly with a whisk, and it eventually melted again and incorporated into a nice confection. I followed the rest of the instructions as printed. The consistency is nice--it pretty much spread itself. It also holds up nicely, even in our humid environment. My kids wanted to eat it with a spoon! We decided it would be yummy with cut apples, bananas, etc., too!

My mother made this in the 50's. I can rxplain "soft ball stage". First if you have a candy thermometer, that will have a marking for it. If not, this is what it means. You take a tiny dribble of the hot mixture (just a couple of drops) and pour it into a glass or measuring cup of cold water. It should form a small glob. Squeeze it gently. It should not be rock hard...it should be soft pliable. If it does not form a  glob you need to cook it a bit longer. If it's like rock candy, you overcooked it. My mother taught me that when I was a child...I always got to eat the tiny glob. lol I do think my mother stuck it under a broiler for just a minute after the cake was ices to "finish" the look.

I just loved it! I put it on a caramel cake and it was good. It also makes good caramel candy too. I will make this again. My kids liked to eat it out of the bowl for candy.

Made this recipe as written. For starters this inst a very spreadable icing..its more of a pourable glaze..so it doesn't do well on cupcakes . I can however see this on top of a nice loaf or a sheet of brownies. Make sure to brown your sugar really well..because that's where all the flavor is in this icing. Once you pour the water in, be prepared for it to bubble up , but keep stirring. Yes you will notice clumping of the sugar..keep it simmering on low and the sugar will dissolve, don't give up at this stage (although it seems like its a horrible mess) Mine took 5 minutes and all the sugar was dissolved, into the hot water. i used a thermometer to keep track of the temperature after adding the rest of the ingredients..and removed from heat once it hit a steady 115 degree Celcius. I allowed to cool at room temp and then moved to fridge for a couple hours. I was really hoping this was gonna fluff up nicely. This in no way "Spreads" like the recipe states..so i was  a bit disappointed .  I ended up drizzling it on some cupcakes. The flavor was really good ...very very Sweet. so perhaps the drizzling was a good thing because i dont think i could handle too much of it. Overall it was OK. i would suggest serving it with something not too sweet so the flavors balance out.

This recipe is from the early colonial days.  Keep in mind the sugar must be processed in a black iron skillet to do it correctly.  Aluminum pots will not give it the same flavor.

Also, this is a fudge like process.  If you have never made fudge you will not be willing to take the time to make it.

Having said all this, the flavor is something you cannot buy from the store.  If you make too much of the syrup it will keep for a very long time in covered container.  It can also be added to the cake mix after it is wet to add the amazing flavor there as well.

I am really upset with this recipe.  I do not consider myself a pro but neither am I a beginner.  15 minutes?!?! It took me 20 minutes “over a low heat” just to get the sugar to start browning!!! I spent nearly an hour on this icing and have nothing to show for it.  I used a candy thermometer and my dutch oven (as I have used in other caramel recipes) and it turned out horribly.  I understand I probably cooked to long but I was following the directions given.  My thermometer never even reached the soft ball stage before it was too late.  
Laurie, can you please give more detail?  With more detail I would love to try this again and change my review.
