Wonderful and quite low in fat!!!  We made it just the way it said(I used pork tenderloin because it was on sale and virtually fat free).  I figure, if it is good like it is and that easy (I have 3 children under 5) then it is a winner in my house.  I threw it all in the Crockpot within minutes and 7 hours later we were enjoying our dinner.  I put 2% cheese, low fat sour cream and green onions on top.  The whole family loved it.

Only a few minor changes.  I doubled the chili powder and cumin.  Used one can of black and one of red kidney beans.  Also used a hot salsa and added about 1/2 cup chopped celery.  Very nice change from the regular chili.  I'd say enough for 3 but pushing it for 4 if anyone wanted seconds.

OMG this is so good!  I sauteed the onion and garlic before putting it in the slow cooker.  I also used Andouille sausage instead of pork because that is what I had.  I used Rotel instead of salsa and slow cooked on high for 5 hours.  Perfect amount of spice.  I wish I would have doubled the recipe for leftovers.

I omitted the pork to make this vegetarian and it was still tasty and spicy, so I didn't feel I was giving my vegetarian less than a full meal.  I served it with brown rice and she was full.  Thanks

This is a delicious change from your everyday chili. Try using the Bill Echols taco seasoning from this site.

It was alright. Just was missing something. Not sure what. My husband and I were thinking that perhaps some additional tomato would help or the addition of some kidney beans.

Excellent and quite healthy.  Added some flour at the end to thicken a little & more spice to suit our tastes.   Served with tortilla chips as recommended.  Definitely a keeper!  Thanks!

Was pretty good if I make it again I would use only 1 can of black beans and add an extra can of diced tomatoes.  Also it says it makes 4 servings but it easily makes 6 servings. Not very spicy.

Got nothing but compliments with this! I doubled the recipe, as I needed more than 4 servings, but I can tell you, this recipe (with out doubling) will feed 6 easily and we are big eaters! Doubling it filled my crock pot to the brim! The only change I mad was to add a can of corn. I also used a can of pork, and made up the rest with cubed pork steaks. Thanks for the recipe! I WILL make it again!

Loved it! Very easy and lots of flavor. I used a 1lb package of Boneless Pork Tenerloin that was pre-marinated in Black Peppercorn available at grocery store.  I down sized recipe for 2 people and enough for 3-4 servings. Served with a nice tossed salad.

I didn't follow this to a tea but it served as a great base.I omitted the yellow bell pepper and the pork. It works well as a freezer meal.

I cannot say enough about is recipe! I'd been using the same tried and true recipe for over 12 years and was getting bored with it. I found this one and tried it...OMG!!!! it is by far the BEST chili i have ever had. the only adjustments i made was to add pickled jalepino peppers and i cooked it on the stove, simmering it for 1 1/2 hours. the pork melts in your mouth...yummy...i will use this always!!!

This is a great recipe, really simple to make. I think it has just enough kick, but is not too spicy. I doubled the recipe, used a 3 lb. pork loin, cut into 1/2 inch pieces. Also, instead of 4 cans of black beans, I used 3 cans and 1 can of low-sodium corn. At the very end, I added about a cup of rice to thicken it. Everyone loved it!

If I could have given this one six stars I would have!!  My family loved it.  I followed the directions and would not change a thing. I put everything in the slow cooker before I went to bed and had my dinner ready when I got up in the morning. Just cooled and refrigerated it before I left for work and warmed it up at mealtime.
This one will definately go in the recipe rotation.

Who knew chili would be better with black beans. I substituted the pork with ground turkey, added corn, and did 1/2 tsp of chili powder and 1/2 tsp of cayenne. I also added in a bit of oregano. It came out wonderful.

We loved this.   I saut√©ed the onion, pepper and garlic in 1tbs canola oil.  We used lean pork steaks and cubed them and topped the chili with fresh lime juice, fresh cilantro, shredded cheese and low fat sour cream.  It was fantastic!  We used a mild salsa, so the crushed red pepper did not make this dish too spicy.  It added just enough oomph to the dish and my 10 yr old still loved it.  For people who felt it was too spicy, I suspect they used a medium or hot salsa.  This is going to be a regular dish in our dinner rotation.  I really think the toppings you add are what make this dish pop.

Eliminate the garlic & use Chipotle Chili Powder - so much better.  Haven't tried it but a can of corn added to this will go into the next batch.  

I don't put raw meat into a soup in the crockpot since I don't trust it getting to temp to be 'safe' so I cube the loin and brown/cook it in bacon fat before adding to the rest.  Started the vegetables the night before on low & added the meat in the morning for a noon meal.  The house smelled divine in the morning & the flavors were well blended by noon.  Served with corn muffins & honey butter - a very satisfying meal on a cold March day.

My fiance loves this chili.  I've made it for him several times.  I love black beans and I enjoy having pork instead of the typical beef or chicken chilis I usually make.
