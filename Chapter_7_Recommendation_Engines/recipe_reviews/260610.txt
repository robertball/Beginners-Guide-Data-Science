Make sure you grate the cauliflower before you nuke it, and make sure you use parchment paper or nonstick cooking spray. Great idea, I will try and make again after my fist batch stuck to the paper. Really want this to work...

Added shredded parmesan and spicy seasoning, will use for both taco and pizza toppings. I cooked the chopped cauliflower in microwave before I pulsed it, much easier. Pressed out moisture next. Then added the seasoning and egg.  They stayed together amazingly well in baking. Yummy.
