My 6 year old son made this for his dad! It turned out amazing! Very creamy with a rich peanut butter taste. We topped with whipped cream and chocolate sauce. Will definately make again!! :)

Very creamy and very tasty! I made minor changes just to improve the health quality of the recipe, regardless, my rating is the same for each version! For the crust, I used half low-fat graham crackers and half reduced-fat Oreo cookies mixed together while omitting the sugar completely (it's just not necessary). I used reduced-fat peanut butter, light cream cheese and halved the confectioner's sugar. If you prefer a more pronounced peanut butter flavor then I would increase to 2 cups or reduce the cream cheese to 8 oz. The filling was delicious, although definitely had a noticeable cream cheese flavor. I topped with the remaining graham cracker and Orea mixture. Mini chocolate chips would make a great addition to the pie filling. If you prefer the whipped topping, I recommend adding a dash of vanilla extract and 2 tbsp of confectioner's sugar to the final cup of heavy cream; without it the taste is blah. Next time I will make this in an actual pie pan. When I attempted to remove the springform pan, the pie nearly caved out the sides. Hope these suggestions help everyone!

This was good! I was lazy and bought a oreo crust and ended up having leftover filling. Next time I make it I will buy 2 crusts and just double the topping.

I was not a big fan of this recipe.  The peanut butter part seemed bitter, and there was too much cream cheese flavor.  I did sweeten the whipped cream on top as another reviewer suggested, and I'm glad I did.  I used a store-bought chocolate graham crust.  The filling was piled high in the crust, but it did work.  I will not be making this again.

I used a store bought graham cracher crust and heaped the filling in!  I think the confectioners' sugar is to add more sweet to the whipped heavy cream.  But again, I used store bought whipped cream and split the container.  Regardless, AMAZING!

This is very creamy due to the heavy cream instead of the whipped topping.  I really like that,however, there wasn't enough sugar in it for me. I had to add another half cup of confectioner's sugar and then I added 1/4 cup to the whipped cream.

Add melted chocolate before adding whipped cream topping.
