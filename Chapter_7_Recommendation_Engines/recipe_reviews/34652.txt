Not a fan... I made it as directed and it turned out the way it should have, but the taste just wasn't for me... first time ever having tarragon for me and I think that was the issue. Just a little too bitter. I may replace it with Italian seasoning and minced garlic instead of the mustard in the future. It has a lot of potential, just not necessarily my style. I do have to admit though that I had fun cooking it!

Smelled so good while it was baking,  tasted absolutely wonderful and was so easy it came out perfect on the first try.  Although I must admit I added an extra egg white so the meringue would spread evenly over 8 small fillets.

Good flavor but I think I must have done something wrong with the meringue because it turned out kind of hard.  Probably because I had to cook it a little longer.

Delicious and fun new way to cook fish. I broiled the top for a few minutes at the end because the top wasn't turning brown and I was worried about over cooking the fish.

I would suggest using Panko crumbs; much lighter than bread crumbs.  A little dried dill wouldn't hurt either.

I tried this technique with Fresh Wild Alaskan Sockeye salmon.  Used dill instead of parsley.  I would suggest putting a very thin smear of mustard on the fish in addition to salt and pepper.  And add mustard to the meringue.  I used panko and it gave a nice texture.  I think you need to use a fish that gives a flavor contrast to the egg which is more of an edible garnish. This does serve to keep the salmon moist as it finishes cooking, so it's important to watch your timing on the first round of cooking.  Beautiful presentation if done correctly.  Next time I will try cooking on alder plank.

I made this with the expectation that the whipped egg whites and herbs would combine to create a unique taste. I cooked the recipe according to directions, only adding a sprinkle of dill. The end result tasted like snapper with fried egg on it. The recipe also did not say how much Dijon mustard to add, so I only added 1 teaspoon.

I'm not a very good cook, and I think I didn't whip the egg yolks until they peaked properly, but I still thought this was really good.
