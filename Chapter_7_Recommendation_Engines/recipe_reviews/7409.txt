Very easy to make, yet elegant.  A friend of mine had already made it and made a couple of suggestions.  She first added 1/2 teaspoon almond extract to the cream cheese mixture. Then the order used was lady fingers on bottom and sides, half the cream cheese mixture, another lady finger layer, all of the strained strawberries, the strawberry juice/cornstarch mixture (with 1/2 to 3/4 cup reserved), the rest of the cream cheese mixture, then in a spoke pattern add the reserved juice mixture.  With a skewer, swirl the spokes until a pretty pattern emerges.  Pile fresh strawberries in center.  Garnish with mint sprigs and white chocolate curls.  It won her first prize in the local Strawberry Festival.

This recipe is fabulous. I changed it slightly. I put the frozen strawberries in a pan with the cornstarch. Cooked down the strawberries and then took the cooked mixture and pureed it with 1/2 cup of sugar and once cooled poured it over the top of the torte. I think it complemented the torte more than just a little strawberry sauce. It looked great,everyone at my work raved about it, and none was left. Will make again!

The first time I made this I found the 11 oz cream cheese overpowering, so I've always used 8 oz after that.  Even then I think I could use with a bit less cream cheese, but that's totally up to personal taste. Then, because of the other reviews, I layer instead of putting the ladyfingers on the sides -- this allows the ladyfingers to soak in moisture and better complement the texture of the cream.  I just use a nice, transparent flat-bottomed rectangular glass bowl and it still looks good enough to serve at a party.  And the most important tip -- since I use fresh strawberries, I mash them and instead of putting aside the strained strawberries, I fold them into the whipped cream/cream cheese mixture.  This transforms it into a really strawberry dessert instead of just a strawberry-and-cream concoction.  Although shaved chocolate looks good as a topping, I think it deflects the taste of strawberries, so I don't recommend it.  This is a really good strawberry refrigerator cake.

I made this for my company Christmas party this year, and it was finished off completely! I followed some other's advice and cooked down a bag of frozen strawberries with 3/4 cup of sugar and 2 tbs. cornstarch (making sure to mix the cornstarch with some of the strawberry juice first). Then I pureed the mixture in a blender and let it cool. I did cut down some of the ladyfingers because they were too tall when I was assembling the sides. After I put the cake together, I poured the cooled strawberry mixture on top of the entire cake. I chilled the cake for 24 hours, and then used the leftover cream mixture to pipe rosettes around the top border and in the very center of the cake, and used fresh strawberries to border the bottom of the cake (and one on the top for good measure). I will definately make this again, and next time, I'd like to put sliced fresh strawberries in the cream filling too. Thanks so much for such an elegant recipe!

Great Desert. Good for any occasion. I had a hard time getting the Lady finger cookies to stand up though. So what I ended up doing first was laying down the lady fingers on the bottom on the pan and pouring 1/2 of the cream cheese/whipping cream mixture on top of those. Then I insert the lady fingers around the edge of the pan. It helped them stand up straight and hold them in place. Once I had inserted all the cookies around the edge I poured the rest of the mixture on top and added the strawberry topping. The strawberry topping was a little bitter, so I would suggest sifting a little powdered sugar on top of that. Tasted wonderful. Very simple recipe - Will definitely make it again!!!!

This cake was incredible. I made it for some very picky eaters and every one of them LOVED it. They even said it was better than a similar cake from a famous New York bakery! I did simplify the recipe a little by using frozen whipped topping instead of fresh cream. I also used a 24 oz package of frozen sweetened strawberries and layered the strained strawberries and a little of the glaze over the lady finger in the center layer of the cake. I used the rest of the glaze on the top of the cake, as directed, and decorated with fresh, whole strawberries. I refrigerated over night and WOW! It not only looked like a store bought cake, but tasted like it came from a bakery.

Excellent!  I've already made this a couple of times with fabulous results.  Everybody who tasted it raved.  One of my husband's co-workers declared it his favorite dessert; another one told him to give me a kiss for making it!  I followed the directions, except mashed some extra strawberries in the filling and another layer of strawberry glaze in the middle as other reviewers suggested.  Yay!  I made it with store bought ladyfingers once and homemade ladyfingers the other time (recipe from this site) and I definitely thought the homemade version had better flavor, even though they didn't have as much volume.  Thank you for the definite keeper!

WOW! This was amazing! What a beautiful presentation! I made for a family get together and within 20 minutes it was GONE! I had a 10in springform pan so I used 16oz cream cheese, 8oz cool whip vs. heavy cream (only to save time), and doubled everything else, which was perfect! It filled all the way up to the top without overflowing. For the vanilla I sub'd half for almond and was happy with the result. I followed another reviewers suggestion on layering: ladyfingers, 1/2 filling, drained strawberries, 2/3 thickened strawberry sauce, other 1/2 of filling and then remaining 1/3 of sauce. Swirl sauce with filling and top with shaved chocolate, mint sprigs & a few sliced strawberries! Simply beautiful. Chilled for about 8 hours and when I removed the pan sides it held together! Thank you for the post!  PS: I used frozen sliced strawberries.

One of the best recipes I've ever tried from this website! I took this into work, and it was gone in no time. I had several requests for the recipe as well.

I only made one small change. The local grocery was out of ladyfingers, so I bought an angelfood cake and broke it into bite sized pieces. The finished cake felt heavy, and I was a little worried that it might be too thick--but it melted in my mouth!!! I usually am very critical of my own cooking, but even I couldn't find one bad thing to say about this one. Thank you Star!!!!!

Easy, tastes light and fresh, and makes a beautiful presentation.  The recipe doesn't specify that the frozen strawberries should be sweetened.  I tasted the sauce and realized that I had to add sugar to the unsweetened ones I used.

This is a spectacular dessert if made properly. Some of the bad reviews people have written are not the fault of the recipe,but the person trying to make it. Ladyfingers are soft,sponge cake like cookies,and that is what this recipe calls for. It does not call for any kind of hard cookie whatsoever. Also,the strawberry topping turns out fine if you use whole frozen strawberries with a little sugar added with a touch of water. Bring this to a boil,and then mash them with a potato masher. After that,make a cornstarch slurry to thicken it up,and add a little red food color if you like to make it bright red. This recipe is easy,and delicious,and has become a staple in my family for springtime and summer holidays/get-togethers. Thanks for posting it.   A couple more things,I cut the vanilla in half,and add about a teaspoon of almond extract to the cream cheese mixture. Also,make sure to whip the cream cheese mixture well(definitely use a stand mixer if you have one),and then gently fold in the whipped cream. Your dessert will be lighter and fluffier that way,and will definitely make enough to fit into a 9 inch pan(I use a 10 inch pan for this dessert and it is filled to the top).

This was oh so good. I got rave reviews. However, I only made minor changes to the recipe.  1st change is that I only used 1/2 cup of sugar.  2nd change is that I didn't get a lot of strawberry juice so I followed another user's review and cooked down the frozen strawberries and pureed them with sugar. When doing this, I learned that 1 tablespoon of cornstarch is not enough. My strawberry topping was very runny and ran all over the cake. I also couldn't get a very thick layer since that was the case. Next time I make this, I will either use more cornstarch, or perhaps some pectin, or even gelatin to make it nice and thick.   I found getting the ladyfingers to stay upright very difficult so I laid the bottom with ladyfingers, and put a dab of the cream cheese mixture in a small bowl and dipped the bottoms of the ladyfingers in the mixture to act like an adhesive. That worked extremely well.

I really enjoyed this a lot and as many have, I have modified it after my first try.  I have made this several times since as everyone requests it!  My changes: I get 2 lbs of fresh strawberries and pull out the prettiest ones to put all across the top. The rest I slice and add with the frozen berries and juice to make into the sauce, doubling the cornstarch. This gives me considerably more sauce to spread in the layers and that gives it all that much more strawberry flavor! It is so beautiful and to make it even easier to make I layer the entire thing into a trifle dish.  Love it, thanks so much.

Very easy and very tasty! I made a few changes, I used the Ladyfingers recipe from this site and made my own lady fingers the day before, I also piped out 2 big 7inch circles using the ladyfingers recipe, I like to do that instead of laying ladyfingers on the bottom and middle. I also put the strawberries in a pot with 3/4c of sugar, once the sugar was dissolved I added a couple of tablespoons of the sauce into the cornstarch and than mixed the cornstrach back into the sauce. That makes the sauce thicken without getting any cornstarch lumps. Than I blended the sauce and cooled off in the freezer for about 15 minutes. I also used 1/2c of sugar in with the cream cheese, I changed that since I had added sugar to the strawberries. After pouring 1/2 the filling into the pan on top of one of the ladyfinger circles I poured about 3/4c of sauce than placed the other circle on top of that. Than the other 1/2 of the filling and topped with some big drops of the strawberry sauce that I swirled into the cheese mixture. I fanned out some strwberries and dipped them into a simple syrup to make them shiny and placed them on top of the cake. I had left over filling and sauce, I used a 8inch springform pan. Everyone loved it, it wasn't overly sweet, I will make it again!

Made this and won top prize in our local Incredible Edibles contest in the Sweet Treats category. This pretty dessert tastes as good as it looks! I found it needs 2 tablespoons of cornstarch to prevent the topping from being too runny. Otherwise, don't change a thing! It's a winner! (I won a $300 watch with this recipe!)

I have to give this 5 stars because I made this for my husband's birthday party, and everyone said wow when they saw it, simply because it's a beautiful cake, but it became double wow when they ate it. I cut the sugar to half a cup but added a little homemade strawberry jam mid layer to enhance the strawberriness. I also made the topping with fresh strawberries and it was absolutely delicious.

I honestly can say this is the best strawberry torte/dessert I have ever had/made, It's soooooo good that my mom wants me to make it again next week for her birthday party. I can't give this 5* because of the many changes I've made, but the recipe as is, is a great start. All that reviews inspired me, thank you! Made my own "Ladyfingers" from scratch(recipe on this site), actually spread the batter over a sheet cake pan, baked  and then cut in half to make the layers. Used 1 pound of fresh strawberries: saved 4-5 sliced strawberries for decoration, and mashed/strained another 4 which I mixed with the cream cheese and whipping cream. Placed the remaining strawberries in a saucepan, added around 2TB sugar, 1/2 glass of water and simmer until the strawberries were soft. Reserved part of the liquids to soak the cake later. Added 1TB of cornstarch to the strawberries mix, stirred and removed from heat (let cool and blended the mixture). Then just layered, covering the top with the strawberries mixture. Delicious!! that's saying a lot considering I've always *hated* all those desserts that involved strawberries and whipping cream. I can't thank you enough!

I LOVE THIS RECIPE! I did make some changes as per previous reviews.  I cooked down the frozen strawberries with the cornstarch for a few minutes until heated, then stirred in 1/4 cup of the total sugar measurement.  I let that cool to room temp then pureed and strained the juice out, reserving the pulp.  In the cream cheese mixture I added 1/2 tsp almond extract.  I layered as follows:  Lady Fingers (my packages were 3 oz each, I used 2 1/2 packages), cream cheese mixture, strawberry pulp, ladyfingers, cream cheese mix, strawberry sauce.  Topped with leftover cream cheese mix piped onto the top.  I did have strawberry sauce and cream cheese mixture leftover.

I made this according to the recipe, and was a little disappointed by the taste.  It looked beautiful, but if I were to make it again, I would definitely put strawberry in both of the layers and not just on top.

This is, without a doubt, one of my favorite dessert dishes! Absolutely wonderful!  Its tastes like a strawberry shortcake crossed with a strawberry cheesecakes. Its absolutley phenomenal! I did modify mine slightly. To make it a little bit easier, instead of the spring form pan, I used just a standard 8 inch square pan. I layered the lady fingers on the bottom, pourd half the filling, layered lady fingers again, poured rest of the filling then topped it with the strawberry sauce and strawberries.  When I tried it this way, without the lady fingers around the sides, the lady fingers weren't overpowering. Will make many, many, many times down the road!  I highly recommend this dish!!!!

Very yummy recipe!  Couple of comments to improve the recipe...I followed a lot of the suggestions from the reviews.  I used thawed frozen sliced strawberries in sugar, trimmed the ladyfingers by 3/4" so they could stand on the flat edge, used the frozen strawberries in a layer on top of the ladyfingers, and topped it w/fresh halved strawberries.  Using a 9-in. springform, I ended up w/half cup too much filling.  I suggest making this dessert at least the night before so that the ladyfingers have time to soften so cutting it would be easier.

Absolutely AMAZING!!! So easy to make and looks so elegant. I brought this to Easter Brunch and everyone thought I bought it at a bakery. People were standing in line to get a slice. This cake is so light and fluffy. The key is mixing the heavy whipping cream to stiff peaks then folding it into the cream cheese. Instead of 2 tsp vanilla I use 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp almond extract. If you plan to add strawberries to the top you must use fresh strawberries NOT the frozen ones. The frozen strawberries are too soggy. They work but they do not look as good and the mushy texture is weird. Trust me, you will thank me later. I used a 10" spring form pan and added 1/2 the cooked down starwberries between the 2 layers and other 1/2 on top. Looks appealing when you slice the cake and adds extra flavor. This is a keeper.

Have made this a number of times. It definately has a WOW factor! Everyone loves it and it is so impressive. Made for Easter as the only dessert and it did not disappoint. The only change I made was to add some lemon zest to the filling and some fresh sliced berries in the middle, on top of the ladyfinger layer. I also used 2 1/2 packages of 3 oz. ladyfingers.Thanks for a great recipe!

I also cheated and folded in store bought whipped cream. Instead of making the sauce, I melted down seedless strawberry preserves and drizzled it on the berries which were fresh, not frozen. I tweaked this a bit, by using my cheats, but OMG is this thing delicious! It's like strawberry shortcake collides with strawberry cheescake...decadent!

Amazing! My only suggestion is for the topping. Use 2 pounds of fresh/frozen strawberry's, mush down in pan with potato masher and add 1 cup of sugar. In a separate bowl add 1 cup of water and 3 tablespoons of corn starch (MIX WELL) gradually add to strawberry mixture and thicken. Once thick enough let cool. Add to top of torte and believe me it makes the dish!

Fabulous - I served this for Christmas and everyone loved it! I thawed whole strawberries and then cooked them down with 1/4 cup sugar.  I pureed them then strained the puree to remove the seeds, folded about half of it into the cream cheese mixture. Spread the remaining puree on top of the torte, added a few chocolate shavings on top and voila - a beautiful dessert. I bought soft ladyfingers that are not separated, come four groups of six to a package and lined the sides of the pan. Since they are not separated, they stay in place easily. I used 1 package for the sides and made the ladyfinger recipe from this site for the base and middle layer. I spread the batter out on the baking sheet and cut two circles when it was done. This keeps the torte pieces neat looking when cut. Maybe I'll dip the top of the ladyfingers in melted chocolate next time. No matter what, I'll make this one often!

Ohhhh....Yummmm!!!  I didn't realize just how hard it is to find ladyfingers...impossible, actually.  I had to make my own following the recipe from this site.  I dipped teh bottom of the ladyfingers in chocolate before adding to the pan (if you do this, spray the pan with non-stick spray before adding).  I found this recipe wonderful.  I only added about 3/4 of the whipped cream to the cream cheese mixture.  I piped the rest onto the top of the torte.  I then added chocolate dipped strawberries.  Very Good Recipe!

Yummy with an intriguing texture.  Cake did fall in middle, think I overmixed which I've heard will cause this problem. Due to this.. I sliced the top of the cake to make it level.  Then spread some of the extra pureed strawberries on it and frosted.  Best mistake ever!! The extra thin layer of puree added a nice tarty kick to the cake.  Did have a little trouble with frosting, really recommend doing frosting at least a day ahead or first. The extra time is totally worth it.. the frosting was totally delish and went superbly with the cake.. not to mention the finger swipes that I kept doing! ;-)

I am a big food critic.....but both recipes I have tried on this site have been 5 star!!!!  I am sticking around here :)  This recipe is has abit more "oomph" than strawberry shortcake but not nearly as rich and dense as a cheesecake.  Exactly what a dessert should be...something sweet but not going to have you walkng away from the table ready to explode.

Everyone LOVED this. Make sure you use the small, wide & soft lady fingers for the best effect. I used a 9" springform and could only find the large thin lady fingers, so I cut them to the height of the sides of the pan. I used the shorter & softer ones the second time I made this and it came out much better.

Absolutely fantastic.  Couldn't find ladyfingers and didn't want to make them so I replaced them with lightly toasted angel food cake.  Delicious.

Makes for nice presentation.  You can use cookies similar to lady fingers as well.  Fairly basic, and while the photo has the ribbon around it, I found it unnecessary for the final product to remain intact.

This was very easy to make and as a great presentation. Just FYI, two 3 oz package are enough lady fingers for this. I ended up with a ton of extra lady fingers. Instead of using just the juice of the frozen strawberries, I mashed the frozen strawberries and used them as well as the juice. Fresh fruit worked best for the top to give it it's finishing touches. I highly recommend this!

I made this cake last night as a test run.  Well, it looked awful, but I hear it tasted good.  I'm glad I did the test run because I was going to bring this to Mother's Day gathering.

Quite possibly the best dessert I have ever made (and I have made thousands). Creamy, fresh, light, and just the right amount of sweetness. I subbed low fat coolwhip for the whipped cream and used 8 oz of regular cream cheese and 3 oz of the reduced fat. This was in an attempt to keep the fat content down.  The flavor wasn't compromised at all! Per others suggestions I cooked down the strawberries with 1/3 cup of sugar and cornstarch and then partially pureed in the blender.  The result was a strawberry sauce that was awesome.  I actually made a double batch of this to freeze and serve later with strawberry shortcake. I layered the lady fingers, then cc mix, then strawberry sauce, and repeated.  I topped with some sliced fresh strawberries for presentation.  Perfection!

I just made this a couple of weeks ago and it was immediately gone within a matter of days, what i love about this recipe is that it doesn't leave you this sickly feeling of eating too much?because it is light but you still get the cheesy taste, unfortunately for me, i didn't have strawberries at the moment so i improvised blueberries instead,it turned out to be a new kind of blueberry cheesecake in my opinion GREAT nonetheless!:) you get to really let creativity shine in this recipe!:)

What a disappointment!!  After reading all the 5-star reviews, I was quite eager to try this recipe.  It definitely did not live up to the ratings.  There is not enough moisture in the cream cheese mixture to soften the cookie layer in the middle, so it can't be sliced.  The filling is bland and is only sufficient to reach about 2/3 of the way up the surrounding biscuits (even with an 8" pan), so it looks like a souffle that flopped.  The lack of flavour is certainly not offset by the mushy berries on the top.  The glaze can't possibly become shiny without the addition of sugar and becomes a sticky waxy-looking mess that covers the top.  I went on faith by the instructions, suspecting that it wouldn't result in the delicious-looking dessert in the pictures (and how could it without any fresh strawberries required in the recipe??)  I made this to bring to a friend's house but was too embarassed to take it along.  Next time I'll be more careful to read between the lines in the reviews - when so many of them say "I changed the recipe by...", this should be interpreted as "This recipe cannot be used successfully as it is written."  The five-star ratings are, in truth, evaluations of other recipes altogether.

I'm only giving it 4 stars because I modified the recipe.  Modifications: -I used 2 packages of cream cheese, with the sugar, vanilla extract and 1 container (1 L) of cool whip (thawed).  -I did not make the strawberry sauce. Instead, I used my homemade strawberry freezer jam and fresh sliced strawberries.  It turned out delicous!!! Can someone please explain how the ladyfingers stand around the pan? I always have a hard time making them hold before pouring in the mixture!!

Amazingly good! I made two tortes: one with Italian ladyfingers, which extended well over the rim of the pan - good and pretty but the best results were with the small ladyfinger I found in a 3oz package. As someone else mentioned, these are very easy to layer because they are soft, and come attached in 5 cookies which can easily mold around the pan (I used 3 of these packages). I use 1 lb of fresh strawberries, leaving 5 for decoration, and cooking the rest with 4T of sugar until soft.I took 4T of the liquid and mix with 2T of Grand Marnier, and added the juice to the middle layer of ladyfingers.I took the strawberry sauce from the heat and added 1T of cornstarch dissolved in 2T of water (very important) and let cool and thickened. I continued with the torte by adding a thin layer of straberry sauce to the middle layer of ladyfingers annd continue with the cream cheese mixture, then topped with the rest of the strawberry sauce. I slices the fresh strawberries and place them on top of the sauc with the points (top of the slices) facing the middle, and it looked very professional and pretty.  Absolutely wonderful, and I got many requests for the recipe - all gone in 60 seconds!! The one with the Italian ladyfingers was not as good on the outside and I had to do what another reviewer suggested- place some cream to the bottom in order to stand the cookies since these ones refused to stay put! My daughter ate it all in one day anyway, and since she had not tried the other one, sh

Of the many desserts I've tried on this site, I think this is quite possibly my favorite. I made this for the first time yesterday and served it today for Christmas. I still can't believe how easy and fool-proof it was and it truly did look and taste like something you would buy from a bakery. I had no problems finding the ladyfingers in the bakery section of my local supermarket. I took other reviewers' suggestions and added a layer of strawberry sauce as well as some of the thawed berries on top of the first layer. Obviously I've never had it without that extra layer of sauce and berries but I'm glad I added it. I also made sure to freeze my bowl and beaters for a good ten minutes before whipping the cream into stiff peaks. I was worried about making this the day before but it set up beautifully and was in no way mushy or runny. It stayed together nicely even after slicing. My six-year old devoured his slice. He hummed while he ate it and never looked up until his plate was licked clean...the last time he did that was back when I made the Monkey Bread. I know I will be making this many, many more times. Thanks so much for posting this!

WOW!! I've made this several times and always receive rave reviews on it.  I do change slightly based on feedback from other reviewers..it's a very "forgiving" recipe though.  I mash the frozen berries with a masher and cook them w/ the cornstarch.  I also tore up the ladyfingers in small pieces to cover the bottom of the pan. I was afraid the filling would seep through otherwise.

Served and enjoyed by all.  Changes--mash strawberries to get juice!!!  Use  8 oz. Cool Whip and 16 oz. cream cheese. Top with fresh strawberries and grated chocolate.  This is a winner.

Amazingly light and cool.  I mixed 3/4 cup of thawed strawberries and 1/4 cup raspberries into the cream mix and topped it with decorated chocolate dipped fresh strawberries.  highly recommended

Made just as recipe was written for five guests. No one made a comment about it, which said it all. I did not like it.  This was very bland, was not sweet enough, and the ladyfingers added no flavor.

I made this for a dinner party and it was beautiful.  Because I'm on a special diet, I used fat free cream cheese, fat free Cool Whip, and Splenda instead of sugar.  It was delicious and came together perfectly.  A big hit!  Thanks for a easy, tasty, and visually stunning recipe.

I made this recipe twice and both times it was delicious!  The first time, I used the soft ladyfingers and split them and that works out better when trying to fit them in the bottom of the pan.  The second time, I used the hard ladyfingers and didn't like how they turned out on the edges (remained too hard).  I did use the frozen whipped topping and fresh strawberries and they both worked out well.  I would definitely make it again!  Everyone raved about it!

Awesome, awesome!!  This was a big hit in our house.  The whipping cream made the cream cheese not so rich, I generally don't like no bake cheesecake and was worried this was going to taste like it, but it didn't!  Everyone was amazed that I made it and didn't buy it from a store :)  Only part I didn't care for were the soggy ladyfingers on the second day.  I suppose that would be an excuse to eat it all in one day though.  I'm making this tomorrow for a family BBQ and I plan to use a graham cracker crust instead.  We'll cross our fingers!!

I had to change this slightly, but only by using a sauce of fresh berries, and home made ladyfingers. This is really delicious, and I do recommend letting this set for 24 hours before you serve - for consistency and flavor.

Ok. We (my sis and I) made this recipe with a little variation and it came out great. We put all the frozen strawberries, corn starch and a little powdered sugar in the sauce pan and heated it through and then put the sauce in the fridge to cool a bit. We arranged the ladyfingers on the sides and the bottom of the pan and poured a mixture of the cream, followed by a layer of strawberry sauce, another layer of ladyfingers, cream and strawberry sauce. We arranged some fresh whole strawberries on top and piped some of the reserved cream mixture in the center. It came out so pretty and we were so proud that we took a pic and uploaded it here. =)
Thanks for sharing!

A huge hit!   **Note: A pkg of ladyfingers is only 3oz...I think the recipe means 2 pkgs of 12 ladyfingers (not 12 oz).

Incredible! This cake will definately impress with not only it's beautiful presentation but also with the taste, scrumptious! Used the shorter cake-like ladyfingers in the 3 oz package which I found (finally!) in the bakery dept. of grocery store. Used 2 (3 oz) packages. I did follow some advice given in the reviews and did not strain the strawberries but added whole package of frozen berries to saucepan with 1 cup sugar and then pureed in blender, returned to pan and added cornstarch mixed with water. Allowed to cool for a couple hours and it did thicken. I did add some of this to the middle layer. I allowed the cake to chill for 24  hours before removing the springform pan, and it cut and served beautifully! Will definately be making this again, Thank you!

I made this along with some other desserts for Easter. I'm not a cheesecake fan so I didn't have any. It did get rave reviews, and there wasn't much left.

Lovely and easy.  I will use the beauty of this recipe to inspire more desserts.  I used Pepperidge Farms Milano cookies and trimmmed the bottom of the cookie to get it to stand in the springfoam pan.  I will use half of the frozen cooked strawberries next time.  I also used the ribbon to wrap the torte to keep everything in its place.  Very beautiful and "summer-ish."

This was fabulous! I made just a few changes though, I used 1/2 cup of sugar in the cream mixture and used fresh strawberries.  It looks and tastes great - I will definately make this again.

Easy to make and delicious. I used fresh berries, for slices in the middle layer, and for the puree on top.  I didn't need cornstarch to thicken up the puree but did add a little sugar when I heated it.  Excellent recipe and everyone loved it!

A.M.A.Z.I.N.G. I made it for my mother-in-law's birthday, 12 adults and 3 kids in attendance. Every single person LOVED this. The only problem was there was only enough for everyone to have one piece!! I made a graham crumb bottom because I didn't have enough ladyfingers to do the whole bottom and sides. It turned out great.

Easy and quick to make, beautiful when finished, and tastes fantastic! This is the perfect party pleaser. I love fast recipes and I have this one down to ten minutes flat, start to finish. I don't do the cornstarch because it takes more time -- I just cut up strawberries and spiral them on the top to make a lovely design. It tastes just as good!

This is really good. I usually use the soft ladyfingers if I can find them instead of the hard ones. I also usually just use a can of strawberry pie filling for the topping instead of using the frozen kind. Also great with blueberry or peach pie filling

This is a great quick and easy recipe that looks and tastes like it came from a gormet shop.  It's not overly sweet and it's light and airy which is perfect for summer or after dinner.  I will definitely be making this one again and again!!

I made this for mother's day (for my in-law and my mom) and it was a huge hit. It was light enough to eat after a heavy meal, too. One thing I did different, the strawberries I bought were not in juice, so I chopped them in my mini-chopper, put them in a pot with a little bit of water and a sprinkle of sugar, and brought to a boil. I pureed the mix in a blender and stuck it in the fridge to cool. When i put the filling on top of the ladyfingers I also added a thin layer of this mixture, then more ladyfingers (they soaked up the juice and were exquisite). I sliced strawberries and filled the gap (my ladyfingers were too tall) on the top of the torte. Thanks for an awesome recipe! I will submit a photo. It really was a big hit, and I would make it again. It reminds me of strawberry shortcake!

I took this to a church potluck yesterday and came home with an empty container.  I had fresh strawberries, so I pureed with a little sugar & water for about 2 cups. Put my springform ring directly on cake carrier and assembled onto the carrier, since you obviously could not move this off of the bottom of the springform!  Used a layer of ladyfingers on the bottom, then cream layer, then strawberry puree layer, then repeated.  It was so beautiful nobody could believe I made it, but it was the first dessert cut and the first one gone!

My guest and my family love this recipe.  I make one change though, I don't use lady fingers but use crushed oreo cookies on the bottom and I placed sliced strawberries around the outside.  This looks and tastes great!

I followed the recipe exactly, but still found some problems.  The cream mixture didn't settle (even after waiting 24 hrs) and it fell apart as soon as I took it out of the pan.  However, it was full of flavor and tasted  delicious.

I made a few adjustments to the recipe due to the cost of ladyfingers.  (I made two tortes.) I instead made boxed white cake in a bundt pan.  When it was cooled I cut it into slices and layered a springform pan.  I used a 9 in and an 8 in and both worked fine.  I read that some cooks had difficulty with the strawberry sauce clumping, so before I added the cornstarch I mixed it with some of the juice from the strawberries.  This also worked well and I had no lumps.  Like other cooks, I cooked the strawberries and sauce together and layered it throughout the cake.  Needless to say with all of these variations, the cake was fabulous.  Great presentation too.  Thanks for the recipe.

I have made the recipe several times and I am making it for a 4th of July get together. It is always a hit. I use fresh strawberries and don't bother with making the strawberry sauce. It makes a beautiful presentation when I pile whole fresh strawberries on top and a mound of fresh whipped cream.

This is very similar to a recipe my mother has made all my life and I still love it.  A few of the differences that you may want to try: 1 teaspoon on instant banana cream pudding mixture in place of the vanilla, soft ladyfingers (you can usually get them in the bakery dept of any supermarket) instead of the regular lady fingers.

Okay, what are lady finger cookies and where do you find them??  I looked at 3 different grocery stores in town with no luck so I used graham cracker sticks instead.  Instead of putting a layer of them in the middle, I put the majority of the strawberries and then put the rest on top and swirled it.  Next time I will use a bit more cornstarch to thicken it up a bit more, mine was a bit thin.  I was a bit impatient and didn't let it sit in the fridge for more than 15 minutes or so, and when I took off the side of my pan and cut it, it kinda fell, but the next day when I cut it, it was great.  The flavor and texture were awsome!

This recipe is easy and looks professional.  I had to break the lady fingers in half because they were too tall.  I decorated the top with strawberries as well. Yum...

This is a great recipe. My mom used this recipe to make her cake and now I make it for our family. Some changes we made were: 
- Using Mascarpone instead of cream cheese
- Added sliced 16 oz fresh strawberries, mixed in syrup (taste for sweetness). We also used frozen strawberries for the syrup and extra strawberries
- Only found Bellino Savoiardi Lady Fingers which are hard an tall. To make a 10" torte, 1 quart heavy cream was needed. These ladyfingers needed to be soaked well in syrup - they tasted great!
 
It's a great dessert for any season! It's one of our family's favorite :-)

This is an excellent recipe.  It is light and tastes really good.  I used low-fat cool whip instead of the whipped cream and low-fat cream cheese.  I also used 2 and 1/2 packages of the soft lady fingers.  I added two layers of fresh, sliced strawberries.  I will be making this again.

I didn't have a spring form pan so I made it in a 9x13 glass cake pan. Used 2 pkgs of lady fingers but 2.5 would have been better. I bought a 16oz pkg of frozen strawberries and thawed them but didn't have any juice to make the sauce so I added 1/2 cup sugar and let them stand til I had juice. I made the corn starch and juice sauce and then took the rest of the frozen strawberries and put the. In my magic bullet and puréed it until it was a thick sauce made white whole fruit. I put some on top of the dessert and put fresh fruit on the top also. then when I serve each serving I used the remainder of the purée to decorate the plate and add more to each serving. Taste wonderful and even looked nice served!

This was so easy and so good!  Followed as directed but added 1/2 tsp of almond extract to the cream mixture.  Also cut up two fresh strawberries to mix in the cream.  So YUMMY!!  (I needed 3 packages of Ladyfingers.  The only packages I could find were 3oz, so I bought a ton.  But ended up only needing 3.)  I think this recipe would be amazing with cherry as well!

I laugh when I read how people give negative reviews to a recipe that they completely changed. I made this just as the recipe said and it was not only beautiful it was perfectly perfect tasting.  Just follow the recipe, you will be so happy you did.  And it is EASY!!!!

Great recipe! I made this for Easter and everyone wanted the recipe.  
A couple of notes...lady finger are really light. I bought 2 (3oz) packages of them. I can't imagine how big a 12 oz package would be! That was plenty for the crust and sides. I skipped the ladyfingers in the middle and instead added some of the strawberry sauce to the middle.
I added a little sugar to my strawberry sauce and 2 tbl cornstarch but otherwise followed the recipe.

What a fabulous recipe! I've been waiting to try it because it looked really hard but it wasn't at all. I finally decided to do it for easter this year.

I made two of these. Used chocolate ladyfingers on one and regular on the other. I added about 4 Tbsp kahlua with the vanilla for the chocolate one and I added about 4 Tbsp of Chambord liqueur to the other one. I don't think I would use Kahlua again because it was too strong but the Chambord tasted amazing! Maybe I'd try Bailey's next time? I topped them with whole strawberries and drizzled melted chocolate over the chocolate one. Everyone raved about the presentation and the taste!

The only hard part is getting the ladyfingers to stand up in the pan.  It's tricky but worth it for presentation! I followed some of the other reviewers suggestions regarding the strawberry layer... put it above the second ladyfinger layer and put the strawberries in the pan with the juice & cornstarch. Next time I think I'd try a layer of sliced fresh strawberries in the middle.

I bought  4 packages of ladyfingers with 3oz. each 12 oz. altogether and it was enough for the pan. Which is good because they are not cheap, 1.79 a package. Thought it was an expensive dessert to make and was only "good" at best. Directions could be a little more detailed as I didn't know if I was supposed to seperate the ladyfingers or not. Judging from the fact that they seperated around the outside I guess I should have. I think the review from the person who added strawberry to the center is right on, it needs it and the 16oz package is not enough, although the Ladyfingers and the filling according to the recipe are too much for a springform pan. Don't think I'll spend the money on this again.

I have made this several times and it is always quite a hit!  I do add a layer of strawberry sauce and lady fingers in the center to add a little more texture to the finished cake.  I just swirl strawberry sauce (made from fresh strawberries, cooked with sugar and cornstarch) on the top, add some fresh strawberries for garnish.....viola, beautifl tied up with a pretty ribbon as pictured.

I just took this to an Easter dinner, and it was a success! Just the right consistency and mixture of flavors.  Not too tangy, not too sweet, really delightful! Since the grocery store informed me they did not carry the ladyfingers, I made them myself the night before using a recipe from this site.  It wasn't hard, and they turned out great. I loved this torte, and would make it again in a flash!

This was so elegant and easy to follow. I put my strawberries in the center with fresh mint leaves as accent.  I made mine a day in advance. It tasted wonderful!

I have never posted on here just had to with this dessert I made it for Fathers Day and it lasted 5 seconds my daughter LOVED it.  Thank you for such a great dessert.  I followed the filling exactly and made a brownie shell for it and crumbled brownie pieces with fresh strawberries in the center.  YUMMY.

AMAZING!!  The one thing I did was to cut the ladyfingers in half to make the outside of the tort - i loved the way the ladyfingers tasted after they had soaked in the cream mixture, and I thought the crunchy parts that were too tall to get soaked didn't go well with this soft torte (and also tend to make it look like a fortress...).  I've also used light cream instead of heavy, and the presentation isn't as good (because it doesn't get quite as stiff) but I actually thought it tasted lighter and better.

This dessert was so light and delicious. It did not last long in my house. Every time my husband would take a slice he would tell me that he could eat the whole thing himself every day for the rest of his life! Although for a STRAWBERRY torte, I felt as if there wasn't enough strawberry, so i added a layer of strawberry preserves on top of the bottom cream layer! Definitely made a difference!

Fantastic. I cut this recipe in 1/2 and it was perfect for a family of 4. I made it two days ahead of time for Easter and thought the bottom would be too soggy, but that ended up being the best part! The thickened sauce made for a great filling. I also used another users suggestion of adding almond extract and saving some of the sauce to create a pretty swirl pattern on top! Very professional looking!

So good!! I made this for my mom and took it to Pappasitos for her birthday dinner. My mom, dad and I each got a slice and the restaurant workers took the rest!! I put fresh strawberries on top and drizzled melted white chocolate over them.

Very good, but I thought it needed a greater proportion of lady fingers to cream filling to be balanced. I lined my pan with ladyfingers and put a middle layer of strawberries and ladyfingers as other posters suggested, but it still felt like too much "creamy" in every bite. Next time I make this I will make this a four layer dessert, with ladyfingers on the bottom and another three layers of cream and ladyfingers. Be sure to serve very cold; this dessert "melts" quickly. Good flavor and presentation.

Holy smokes this was good!!!  Not to mention incredibly easy.  The submitter must use a different kind of lady fingers because the ones they sell at my local Safeway came in 3oz packages and I ended up only using 2 1/2 packs.  Also, I took other reviewers advice and cooked down whole unsweetened strawberries with sugar and cornstarch and also added real strawberries into the cake layers. Awesome recipe!

This dessert is easy, looks amazing and tastes great.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I cannot stand using frozen strawberries for garnish!!!  PLEASE, do yourself a favor and garnish this with fresh strawberries.  So you don't waste the frozen strawberries, cook them with the glaze and increase the cornstarch to 1 1/2 Tbs.  Another reviewer mashed the strawberries before cooking, but that is not necessary.  The strawberries will break apart during cooking.  The result is a glaze with strawberry pieces throughout giving it texture (if you are looking for a smooth glaze, this is not for you).  If you use unsweetened frozen strawberries, I suggest you add sugar to the glaze during cooking.  With these modifications, this is definately a 5 star dessert!!

I don't eat cream cheese, but I was eager to try this recipe anyway for my friends and husband, so the rating is on their behalf.  They LOVED it.  Not too sweet, very impressive presentation, so light.  I piped whipped cream between the strawberries on the top of the cake to give it an extra something.  Also, next time I will make the cake directly on the serving plate, and not use the bottom of the springform pan, because there is no way I could get the cake off the bottom of the pan without having it fall apart.

I have a similar recipe using a baked pie crust instead of the lady fingers.  It also call for melting choc chips with one T shortening then drizzling over the top.  That adds a very nice taste to it.

Delicious! The flavor was absolutley perfect. However, I found that once it was cut it collapsed and didn't look as pretty. No one complained about the looks though because their mouths were full! I might use a little less of the cream filling next time to see if it stands up longer. Thanks.

Beautiful presentation, and professional results. I served this Torte for Easter and 14 guests couldn't get enough of it! Several guests really thought the torte was from a bakery. I made this in a 10 inch springform pan and had plenty of filling, but used almoast 3 packages of ladyfingers. Per other reviews I added 1/2 vanilla and 1/2 almond extract. Also I made my glaze from fresh strawberries and put two layers of it in the torte. Very impressive and easy - one of the best recipes on this site. Will make this many times in the future! Thank you.

Delicious,refreshing cake that's even better than strawberry shortcake! I used only fresh strawberries and omitted the sauce-I added a layer of sliced strawberries on the first layer of filling, and garnished with halved berries around the edge, and a few whole berries in the middle-Beautiful and an impressive presentation,too. This recipe works with other fruits,too!

this was DELICIOUS and soooo very easy to make. I dipped my lady fingers in dark chocolate, this helped them to stand up around the edge as well, as the chocolate was slightly tacky still. After I dipped them in the dark chocolate, I sprinkled each with a pinch of powdered sugar for color contrast. I cooked down strawberries for my sauce, and added a bit of sugar as well. I will definitely make this again, a great summery dessert!

I give this 5 stars plus.  I followed the directions exactly and everyone at the party LOVED it.  I did need to use 3 packages of ladyfingers to make sure the bottom and middle layer was completely covered.  I had several requests for this recipe!  Will make it again!!

This was fantastic.  Well worth the work.  I used fresh strawberries and mashed them (for the topping).  Also used another person's suggestion of adding some mashed strawberries into the whipped cream filling.  I also layered the lady fingers.  It really tastes like something you would buy at a bakery.

Made this cake over the weekend for a bbq - what a hit! Easy to make, beautiful in presentation and really delicious- this got rave reviews and several requests for seconds. I added sliced, fresh stawberries in the layers and used a previous cook's suggestion about cooking the frozen strawberries without draining and puree for the sauce - layered the sauce inside and on top.

Heavenly!  I agree with the other reviewers with this being like a cross between strawberry shortcake & cheesecake.  The grocery store didn't carry ladyfingers though, so I used angel food cake which worked great!  I made it in a square 8" pan & layered angel food cake with the mix.  The strawberry juice & cornstarch mixture clumped up in the saucepan though so I didn't use it.  It was fabulous without it!  YUM!!

Boy was this HARD to make!! I am a stickler for following directions and I did everything the recipe commanded and ended up with VERY LITTLE syrup for the strawberries.  I also had way too much cream mixture left. THe taste was great but the amounts seem off to me.

Absolutely DELICIOUS!!!! Very easy to make and turned out quite pretty too. The only problem was that I didn't have enough of the cream filling to fill it up to the top, but I think my pan might have been to big. My family loved it and it was gone in no time at all. Great recipe. A sure keeper!!!

I took this to a picnic & everyone raved abo
sbout it. Since I don't like straw-
berries, I pureed the whole package & 
thickened it with the cornstarch. Next
time I would use a 9" pan since the 8"
was too full, but I definitely will make
it again.

I cooked the full bag of strawberries down as others suggested and layered it in the middle of the cake.  Used the firm ladyfingers to make a prettier presentation.

Family loved it!  I put fresh strawberries in food processor with juice & sugar (saving the best whole berries for top) & put in pan with corn starch. Added half of berry mixture in middle layer too. My brother thought I got torte at bakery! So yummy!

I had to use vanilla wafers and I used a pie plate with wax paper. It was so good.  Not too sweet. Next time I may use fresh strawberries. Will make again and again.

I used a strawberry glaze instead of cooking down the strawberries which I'm sure was a lot easier.

Made this recipe years ago, in the middle of moving and can't find my recipe. Thank you! Just got done making this for my daughter-in-law's birthday cake to serve tomorrow. While I like it the way it is, my kids always asked me to double the strawberry sauce. Done!

Made this for my wife and daughter (also a Mom) for Mothers Day, got great reviews from both!
Next time I will slice fresh strawberries and layer them in with the ladyfingers in the middle for more texture.
I sprinkled powdered sugar on the top for more eye appeal.
This will be a family favorite!

replaced: Ladyfingers with strawberry fig newtons (couldn't find ladyfingers at the store)

Absolutely killed with the family.  I haven't even been able to get a piece yet, myself (watching my food, have to get some calories squared away to 'spend')
I think we're all under the same agreement here, though.  Ladyfingers would have been an additional 'soft, vanilla' flavor that's already pretty overwhelming in the cream portion.  The use of soft, strawberry cookies, instead, was a good choice.

I made this recipe as-is and got great reviews, but I wasn't entirely convinced it was a "make again." However, I don't think it was the recipe's fault! I bought the only ladyfingers my grocery store carried and they didn't look like the same as all the pictures. If I could find the right kind of ladyfingers I would definitely try again!

OUTSTANDING! I followed the recipe as is - the only issue I had was that it did not fill to the top of the  lady fingers.  Next time I make this I will double the recipe (filling only) so that it is filled to the top of the lady fingers.  It is excellent and delicious! A KEEPER! THANK YOU for this recipe!!!

The torte filling was amazing! Layered with fresh strawberries in the middle. Also added a little sugar to the frozen strawberries when I reduced them for the top.

I could not find lady fingers!  I used Vienna Fingers instead, which was tricky, but I made it work.  This is an easy recipe and it tastes great.  Like cheesecake without all the work to bake it.

This recipe was so delicious! I made this cake for my brothers birthday in the summer and everyone LOVED it! Instead of using ladyfingers i used vienna fingers because i couldn't find ladyfingers anywhere near me. My strawberry sauce came out not as good as i wanted but it was my first time trying, so it was good. I used the strained strawberries and put it between the layers as filling, my brother loved that idea. On top i arranged new strawberries(halves). Overall, everyone enjoyed this cake. I will make this again, definitely!

I tried to make this as a dessert for a BBQ and it turned out bad. I mean it tasted good, but the presentation was horrible. it slid all over the place and started ozzing the minute I took off the springform pan. Alas, practice will make perfect but I will definitely be doing it another way next time.

Definetly a 5*! Made it exactally how it said.  I put just a little whip (from a can) around my strawberries on top..dont do it because it melts & screws up the prettiness.  I impressed everyone at a family gathering with this. It tastes sooo good also. thank you for this recipe.

Delicious! I used Alessi Ladyfingers Biscotti for a different texture. Instead of laying ladyfingers in the middle, I chopped up lemon cupcakes I had and used that instead. What a fantastic strawberry dessert!

i made this about seven hours before it was served. everybody loved it. i think that it could have a little bit less cream cheese. I followed a review and cooked the strawberries and cornstarch then pureed it with sugar for the sauce and used fresh strawberries to decorate. the sauce was very liquidy and therefor covered the sides of the cake when we cut it, but it tasted great. next time i will add some gelatin to the sauce.

Thank you, cookiemonstar.  I saw your beautiful photo of how you decorated your torte, and I made mine the same and won first place in the the strawberry festival.  The cake sold at auction for $150.00.  This is a wonderful recipe, Star.  Thanks for sharing it with us.  It makes an absolutely striking presentation.

This got rave reviews from everyone I served it to!  People couldn't believe I made it myself and someone even told me that I should open a bakery!  I made the ladyfingers from scratch (though I probably won't do that again), left the strawberries in the sauce, and added a layer of fresh strawberries both within the torte and on top.  Based on other reviews, I also added a layer of ladyfingers in the middle of the torte.

This is a wonderful recipe and a great do ahead dessert.   Originally I gave this 4 stars because I had to deviate and use Angel Food cake.  I made this again- as a substitute for traditional birthday cake- using Lady Fingers from a recipe on this site. Now... an  Amazing 5 Star!  Looked beautiful! My whole family loved it (none left) and said it looked like a picture from "Betty Crocker".  Free up your dinner preparation time by making this dessert the day before - you will love the enhanced flavor!

Excellent flavor, super easy, and beautiful...cannot beat that!!  I didn't have any problems with the lady fingers standing up.  The cookies I bought were stuck together (about 5 cookies side by side)so I kept about 2 to 3 cookies stuck together and they stood up well along the side.

Very tasty.  I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and cooked down a pack. of frozen straberries with cornstartch and sugar.  The only issue is it was sort of cloudy, I can see why just the juice would be a prettier red.  I covered the entire top with whole strawberries and glazed with melted marmalade for a shiny finish and piped whipped cream around.  Super good.  It would also be good in a triffle dish, just layered.  Oh, also added fresh sliced strawberries in the layers.

This was delicious and very easy! Our friends recommended we make it again and asked for the recipe. The only problem I had was getting the lady's fingers to stand up around the side of the pan; they kept falling over like dominoes. When I lined the bottom first, it did help a bit. I think if I had purchased the shorter cookies, it would have been easier. I'll try that next time. Thanks for the recipe!

This is super simple and very tasty. Took it to a work "pig-out" and everyone loved it. I did add a 1/2 tpc of almond extract. Also couln't find 12 oz packages of lady fingers so had to substitute 3 oz ones and used 3 pkgs. worked out perfectly. Also used fresh berries for the top and used the frozen as the sauce. Layered some sauce in the middle and on top then covered w/fresh berries. Well worth the little time it takes to make.

This was so good! I only refrigerated for 2 hours because I didn't read all the other reviews that typically chilled overnight - but it was still great! I will definitely make again - it looks so professional too.

I have used this very recipe for years now, and it NEVER fails to wow whatever crowd you serve it to!  It looks and tastes like something you would find at a fine restaurant, but is one of the easiest desserts I have ever made.  The only variation I have ever employed is using gingersnap-like gourmet cookies instead of ladyfingers.  In my opinion, it is better that way, and that's how I'll always make it.  Definitely don't pass this one up though...it's a keeper!

I made this for our family Christmas, and it was a hit! Very easy to make and it does look impressive. Not to mention, it tasted wonderful; light and refreshing.  Just a note about the lady fingers - the recipe calls for so many ounces of lady fingers, if I recall. The lady fingers I bought were much lighter in weight! I used 3 packages... if I had followed the recipe, I would have had to buy 7 packages!!! So that was a little confusing.

Oh my goodness!  This was the "non-chocolate" dessert that I made for Christmas dinner.  It was heavenly!  My hubby (the choco-holic) actually ate more of this than the chocolate dessert!  I am definitely adding this to my dessert file!  Thanks!

By far one of the easiest and most delicious cakes i make. Not too heavy not too sweet but very yummy! However through all the times i have made this i have added some of the thawed berries on top of the first layer. I have tried raspberries and 3 mixed berries and both have turned out phenominal as well for a change.

I have now made this wonderful, artful, gourmet dessert more times than I can mention. It is always highly received by cheers and oohs and aaahs. The women in my bakery dept. of my grocery store see me coming and check to see if lady fingers are there. hehe. You must make this if you wish to impress someone or everyone. Cheers!

I bought 8-3oz pkgs of lady fingers and only used 2. I think they would have been better soaked in orange juice or grand marnier? The filling was fabulous and everyone thought it came from a bakery, it looked so good!

What a wonderful presentation!! I impressed many when I brought this out of the kitchen.  I live in Sweden, so I had a hard time finding the fingers.  Lucky for me, I found some italian fingers.  The taste was incredible, and i used fresh strawberrys in the middle filling.  I am thinking that I should maybe use a thicker layer in the middle next time.  Great recipe!

Yowsers!  I made 3 desserts for Easter.  This was by far the favorite.  Everyone's watching their weight, but they were all willing to splurge on calories for this one.  When the end of the night came, they all wanted to take some of this one home, but none of the other desserts.  Even my sister, who hates anything rich or sugary, loved this one!  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

This is very good and light, which is a good thing, because I didn't think about the fact that it would just be the two of us eating it!  Oops!  I couldn't find ladyfingers, so I ended up using Stella D'Oro Margherite Combination cookies.  It made for a cool presentation because I was able to alternate chocolate and vanilla cookies (well, until the end!).  However, I think it would be better with ladyfingers.  Maybe I'll make my own next time.  I did as a lot of other reviewers did and just heated the frozen strawberries together with the liquid.  I really didn't have much liquid from my strawberries, so I kind of had to.  I thought about pureeing the final product, but I prefer chunks of strawberries so I just left it that way, and it turned out well.  Topped with fresh strawberries.  Delicious!  I agree it might be good with another strawberry layer, but it was good as is too.  Bf was happy because there was cream cheese.  Success!  Now to eat all of it!  :o)

Pretty good, not great.  Seemed a bit ordinary to me.  It was also a pain trying to find ladyfingers.  Had to go to three grocery stores.

UPDATE: This is an interesting idea, but next time I would put berries in both of the layers and not just on top.The presentation is great, but it`s difficult to cut a perfect slice, because ladyfingers don`t hold the  shape of the slice. I am not sure I will try this recipe again.

I made this recipe for Easter, and it was a big hit. Everyone commented on how light and refreshing it was. The only change I made was that I layered the strawberry sauce in the middle of the cake and then put sliced fresh sugared strawberries on the top. I think it definitely needs two layers of berries. We will make this one again and again. 

I didn't come close to using 24 ounces of ladyfingers; we used three 3 oz. packages, so a total of 9 ounces, and that was enough for two layers and to also run along the entire edge of the pan. We used the soft ladyfingers available in the bakery section of the grocery store, and they had a great flavor and absorbed the flavor of the strawberry juice. Delicious.

I'm updating my review because I made this again for Christmas; this time I added a bit of almond extract, and that made it even better. The almond flavor goes really nicely with the strawberries and cream.

This was ok. I am a huge dessert fan and love to try new recipes. I found that the cream cheese/whipping cream mixture was lumpy and tasted like sour cream once mixed together. It was good but was too much like and angel food cake with whip cream and strawberries, which is easier to make. I think I will keep looking!

Not as good as I expected. Took a long time to put together. Too much white stuff--too rich.

Very good!!!  But I thought the ladyfingers around the edge looked a little silly, I think I will try something different on the edge next time.  But mmmmmm....the taste!!  Everyone wanted more.
