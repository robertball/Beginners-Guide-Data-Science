I approached this recipe with cautious optomism because it sounded a little odd.  It was actually very good!  I did not have red pepper flakes so I left those out and didn't miss them.  This may be obvious, but you need to grill these on lightly greased foil or the apples and onions will fall through the grill.  You don't want to miss any of them because they are a perfect compliment to the pork chops!  Really delicious!

Excellent!  I used extra thick-cut chops, browning the meat for 5 min. on each side in a non-stick pan.  Then, I simmered the chops in 2/3 c. dry sherry until done.  To finish, I put the apple mixture and cheese on the chops under the broiler until the cheese melted.  The pork was sooo tender.  The only thing I will change the next time I make this-and there will definitely be a next time-is to double the apple mixture.  This recipe is a winner!

We made this in a pan, adding a little chili pepper to the chops to spice it up.  Then we cooked the apples and cheese in the drippings after removing the chops. My husband loved it! Especially with the wonderful autumn apples.

YUM!!! I left out the pepper flakes(maybe next time). After I grilled the chops, I brought them inside on a cookie sheet and put the apple mixture/cheese on the chops. I popped them in the oven for a few minutes to melt the cheese. Less mess than trying to top them on the grill.

very easy to make and a nice blend of flavors.  Leftover didn't taste too good the second day though, so shouldn't make more than you can finish.

This recipe is perfect. Instead of red pepper I used creole seasoning and added some minced garlic. My friends say it's like an apple pie entree.

I found it very greasy. 
If I make it again, I would reduce the butter. 
I would recommend making irish cabbage.

This was very good.  I was unsure if this recipe would suit us or not because it is out of our normal "comfort zone".  I don't normally mix fruit and meat and have never had cheese and apples together.  However, this turned out to be delicious and I will be making it again in the future.  The only thing I did differently is I omitted the onions because neither of us like them.  I did substitute a small amount of onion powder instead to try to keep with the actual recipe flavor.

We all really liked this.  I thought the flavor combinations were really exciting.  The apples and cheese are a nice balance.  Next time, more onion.  I did adjust the recipe to cook on the stove due to the weather.  Here's what I did:  Cooked the onions first, then added then added the apples and cooked uncovered for about 5 minutes.  Removed the onions/apples from the pan and added the pork chops.  Browned well on each side, then covered and simmered for about 10 minutes in some white wine vinegar and more balsamic vinegar.  Once the pork chops were almost done, I added the apple mixture back into the pan, topped with the cheese, and covered again until the cheese melted.  Served with sweet potato fries and green beans.  A really nice meal.

We made this indoors using a skillet and oven. Made apple/onion mixture as directed; would add a little fresh garlic. Removed and set aside. We seasoned the chops with S&P (I'm going to try adding a touch of cinnamon next time) and cooked a few minutes on each side in the same skillet. Moved the chops to a baking sheet then topped with the apple/onion mixture and marble cheddar (I recommend a sharp/old/strong cheese though) then baked it in a preheated 350F oven until the cheese melted. We probably used a little extra cheese. Also, we thought the topping was just enough not make the dish overpowering. Served with "Beth's Scalloped Cabbage" from AR.

This was really tasty.  I think it could have used a little bit of garlic (I put garlic in everything!), so will try it with that next time.  Think that is just about all it needs.  I cooked the chops on the grill and then did the last step with the toppings in the oven.  Will definitely make it again!

My favorite way to eat pork chops.  I love the apple, onion, and cheddar combination.  When I made them the first time, I had way more apple/onion mixture that I prefer.  Maybe my apple and onion were too big?  I'd cut down on the toppings or throw in an extra chop.  Oh, and the red pepper flakes are vital!

My husband and I both enjoyed these pork chops. A year ago he swore off pork, so because of this recipe, I can enjoy pork again. Thanks for sharing it!

YUm.  My husband was in charge of dinner.  He typed in 5 ingredients we had on hand  and this was the recipe that caught his tastebuds.  Instead of porkchops , he sliced up a pork tendlerloin we had in the freezer. Cooked in our grillpan and put everything in a piece of stoneware to melt the cheese on top.  Definitely will make this again.

I think this would've been better as a skillet meal, cutting the pork and adding it to the vinegar sauce.  I thought the pork was bland, but the apples were great.  Next time I'll try it the skillet way, adding shredded cheddar at the the end and serving over rice.

This was pretty good. The apples were delish. I put meat tenderizer, pepper, thyme on my chops earlier in the day. I panfried them and assembled them in a casserole and put in the oven to melt the cheese. Followed the ingredents to a tee.Very nice. Will make again.

This was so tasty!  I don't even like cooked apples and I really enjoyed this meal.  My 10-year old didn't care for it however.  The only difference was I used shredded cheddar cheese and I cooked these in the oven.

these were to die for.  i cooked them on the stove top and omitted the vinegar. i used stew meat instead of the chops, b/c it's what i had on hand.  i added LOTS of crushed red pepper to the apples, cause we like it spicy.  also used shredded cheese instead of the slices.

I made these for my wife for Valentine's Day, and she demanded that this recipe get added to the rotation.  The pork chops were unbelievably tender and the flavors worked together perfectly (we used Granny Smith apples and sweet onions)...thanks for a great recipe!

Wow, these were really great!  We grilled the pork chops in our cast iron grill pan and used an extra sweet Vidalia onion and extra sharp white cheddar. The end result was just delicious!  I'd like to thank Drandyp for submitting such a great and flavorful recipe.  I can't wait to make these again!

Pretty good pork chops!  I used blue cheese brie and added diced granny smith apple, shallots, and dried sage to the brie.  Then I cut a pocket in the pork chop and stuffed in the cheese mixture.  The combination of apple, cheese, and pork was delicious!

This is wonderful!  I didn't use the red pepper flakes since I'm not a big fan of spicy food and I don't think it detracted from the dish at all.  I love the blend of sweet and savory flavors and in my book anything topped with cheese is great!  I will be making this again.

This was very good but I changed up a few things. First of all I didn't have time or weather to fire up the grill and wanted a easy clean up dish so I added all the ingredients (minus the cheese) to a pan on stovetop. Browned the chops and then baked in the oven and it came out great! Next time will try grill though... maybe that will push me to a five star dish!

This was soooo good and so easy.  Followed the recipe exactly except I cooked 3 chops instead of 4 and the toppings on the three chops were great.  If I were cooking 4 chops I might make a bit extra of the onions, apples and cheese.  Thanks submitter.

I've always been a fan of pork with apples, so I loved the sound of this recipe! I made this in a fry pan and then put it under the broiler to melt the cheese.  Very yummy and quick!

These were awesome! I sprinkled the chops with some Memphis Dry Rub,(from this site) minus the MSG, but followed the rest of the instructions. I also added some shredded cabbage to onions and apples. What a wonderful change from my basic pork chops and rice with gravy.

Made this last night and the whole family loved it. I used olive oil instead of butter and added a little more red pepper flakes. The apples went great with the pork chops and cheese. Very tasty, thank you.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I marinated the chops in some balsamic vinegar and garlic for about 30 mins. Other than that and NOT topping them with cheese, I followed the recipe exactly. The apple was a perfect compliment.

I have never had apples cooked with anything. I decided to try this out and man I will cook with apples on any recipe. I really enjoyed I cooked on the foreman grill and then threw under broiler for the melting of cheese and wow it was delicious.

My fiance and I were trying to find something different to eat, and we were very nervous about this one... but it had such great reviews! I halfed it, since it was just for the two of us, and made it with applesauce and salad.  We were so full!

Wow! I loved this recipe.  A few quick changes that I picked up from others' advice.  I added garlic powder to the chops before grilling, and used 4 med apples to one largeish onion.  Used cubed munster cheese under the broiler instead of the grill. Served ontop of orzo with scallions in it, and asparagus on top of the chops...
My friend tried it last night too, and she just baked the chops for 25 mins at 400, and said they came out great!

These were the best pork chops we ever had. Just used apple cider vinegar instead of balsamic vinegar. Instead of the pepper flakes my husband added, for the kids, garlic salt and pepper on the pork chops. Mrs.Dash Southwest Chipotle is an excellent substitute for the pepper flakes. We used that for ourselves. We would have never known the mix of apples, vinegar, onions, and cheese could be so delicious. Our youngest, who is very picky, even loved it. Thank-you for the excellent recipe.

We liked this recipe; it was easy, fast, and special! We cooked 2 Hormel loin chops which were almost 1 1/2" think, and grilled them about 12-14 minutes. 
I did substiture Sweeta for the sugar to lower carbs.

This was a nice change of pace for pork chops.  I didn't have any balsamic vinegar, so I used our "balsamic vinegarette" salad dressing instead and it worked quite well.  This would be a nice and fairly simple dish for company.

This dish was awsome. I didn't use the red pepper though we are not big fans of spicy things. I was very impressed with the way the pork chops stayed so moist. Our 10 year old who we have a very hard time getting to eat meat loved them. Thank you!

I had run out of charcoal so I seared them in the same saute pan that I was going to use for the onions. I seared them first and removed from the pan and cooked the onions and apples as per the recipe in the pan drippings and slightly less amount of butter. I was only making one pork chop because I live alone, so I adjusted the amounts a little but I knew I'd want more of the onion/apple stuff so I used half an apple and a whole small onion. Otherwise I did it exactly, except I only had shredded cheddar so I used that and covered it to make it melt. IT was absolutely delicious.

Very good recipe.  I pan-fried the chops.  I made the apple mixture first, then fried the chops.  Next time I will start the chops in one pan while cooking the apple mixture in another pan, so both are done at the same time.

Other than increasing the recipe 150% (I had 6 pork chops), I made the recipe as written.  Even my wife, who normally says that she will not like anything that has vinegar in it, enthusiastically said it was great!  The apple/ onion mixture, combined with the sharp cheddar, added a depth to the flavor, and contributed to keeping the chops moist and juicy.  This meal was a big hit at our house!

I cooked these chops in a cast iron skillet.  I browned the onions and apples with the balsamic vinegar (no sugar), then browned the chops in the same skillet.  Put the onions/apples on top of the chops with a slice of pepper jack cheese and covered the skillet (without the heat) for about five minutes.

Wow!!  What a tasty combination!  A spinach salad with strawberries and blueberries topped off the meal.  For a single guy, it was a terrific meal that needs to be shared with the special lady!!

This was delicious!
The only thing I did differently was...My husband is not an onion lover so I diced them instead and cooked them down until caramelized, which I think made it even better!

No changes made.  It was okay. We are not likely to make this one again, but if I did I would not used more than a half an Apple.  One slice per pork chop would be plenty. I would likely use more cheese than called for.  The onions with the balsamic vinegar and red chilli pepper flakes was brilliant (we used Xylitol instead of sugar).

I didn’t grill this recipe. I did it in a pan on the stove. It was amazing! I didn’t have any balsamic vinegar on hand, so I substituted with white cooking wine. This will be a favorite recipe from now on!

A quick and easy meal, that was simple, yet tasty.  Made with boneless chops on the stove (weather was supposed to be nice but turned cold again sooner than expected.) Didn't use the sharpest cheese, and will try that the next time.  Kids liked it quite well.

This was excellent! I did not use the grill, I cooked onion and chops together in pan, removed chops and added other ingredients. As per other reviews, I added garlic and a few shakes of cinnamon. I didn't have block cheddar, only velvetta, that was ok, but it really does need a good sharp cheddar.  Next time I may omit the cheese all together, It was so easy and ridiculously good.

This turned out very well, even though I did it all in a skillet. Next time I may try adding a tsp of brandy while cooking the onions and apples.

I use a more exciting cheese, but this dish is so easy and so delicious. 

(Especially when you don't overcook the pork chops like I did the first time I made it.)

This was excellent!  I used 2 apples and doubled the sugar & balsamic vinegar.  Next time, I may use a different cheese.  As much as I love sharp cheddar, I felt like the flavor overpowered the other ingredients.

I loved this recipe! My husband thought the vinegar was too strong but he likes things bland anyway, and I also marinated the pork in some balsamic vinegar for about 30 minutes before cooking too. Tossed on the grill, these chops were easy and delicious! And really nice looking too, I'd use it for guests even.

Delicious!  The flavor was very good, and deserves 4 stars.   I overcooked the apples and the pork chop was a bit tough, but I'll blame that on myself, not the recipe.  I used a granny smith apple, white onion, and I cut the recipe down to 1 chop

Pretty good. I used a granny smith, red onion and a really sharp white cheddar that had been soaked in currant vodka... actually not that bad to prepare, time-wise. Went well with roasted potatoes and asparagus. I probably used more butter than was suggested :)
