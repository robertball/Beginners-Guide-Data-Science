Excellent chili.  I made only a few modifications to the recipe.  I used ground turkey instead of the ground chicken, and turkey sausage.  I used regular diced tomatoes instead of stewed.  I added an extra can of seasoned chili beans and a bit of extra hot sauce.  I served over rice with shredded cheese on top.  It went over very well and I will definitely make this recipe again.

Oh my goodness, if I could give more stars I would! This was spectacular!! I followed the recipe closely. I did omit the beans, my husband refuses to eat them. I used 2 sweet italian sausages and 2 hot italian sausages, I often mix them in recipes. Also I used 2 chicken breasts partially cooked then cut tiny. I had everything else in the slow cooker on high until I put the meat in. Then I put everything in at the same time and let it slow cook for 5hr - my whole place smelled so good all day and everyone was eager for supper that night!! This didn't disappoint anyone - we served over white rice cooked with beef broth. Loved it!!

This was excellent! I actually forgot that it was a slow-cooker recipe, so by the time I realized that it was and I needed to make it that day, I didn't have much time. So, I did it on the stove and simmered everything for about an hour and a half. The flavors are delicious! I think it is my favorite chili recipe I've tried. I will definitely make again (and try the slow cooker!) Thanks for sharing!

Let me start with the fact that this chili recipe won me the chili cookoff at work...so its pretty great, but the only few things I changed were; I boiled chicken breasts and then shredded them before adding to the chili (instead of using ground chicken, much better IMO), I used an additional teaspoon of hot sauce and 1/2 teaspoon of chili powder as it wasn't hot enough for my taste, and I also added some fresh parsley and cumin. Definitely a great chicken variation of chili that many people have never tried.

This was great. The only changes I made was I used whole chicken breasts and then cut them up very fine.  I also cooked it for five hours on high, straight through, rather than changing the temp at certain times. I just don't have time for all that.  I also put everything in the slow cooker at the same time, rather than spaced out.  With these changes, and served on rice, it was splendid!

Used extra lean ground chix breast and hot turkey sausage...I browned both of these with onions and garlic and the chili spices... I did assemble this chili the night before and cooked on low the day of. I also added a diced sweet red pepper and a diced zuchinni to amp up the veggies... this was a very tasty chili and we loved it. I love to use leaner meats and try to use them instead of beef and pork. You do not miss out on any flavor here with the leaner chicken and turkey meats. Leftovers in the freezer...will most def. make again. Thanks!

I made this chili exactly as the recipe stated. My husband, two teenagers, and I agreed that this recipe had way too much of a tomato taste.  With 3 cans of stewed tomatoes and 2 cans of tomato paste, it's no wonder.

This was so delicious! I found it to be a little watery so next time I will drain the tomatoes. My boyfriend wasn't a fan of the chunky tomatoes so I'm going to use diced tomatoes instead of stewed next time. I will also add another can of kidney beans. The flavor was amazing and it tasted even better warmed up the next day. Can't wait to make this again!

Not a good chili at all.   It was so sweet and just plain weird.   Why would you use stewed tomatoes if you are slow cooking anyway?

Too sweet and tomato-ey. Not enough "chili" flavors. You could end up with a similar result by adding chicken to Campbell's soup out of the can. My family did not enjoy.

Absolutely phenomenal!  I tweeked it some, as I do with every recipe.  Instead of tomato paste, I use tomato sauce, and added an additional can, alonf with a can of black beans, and a can of sweet corn.  On all the spices, I doubled it!  (LOVE ME SOME SPICES!)  Also, my husband hates beer in his food, so I used beef broth instead and used a little extra.  The meat I use if ground turkey and mild sausage.  VERY filling meal, and my hubby actually likes it!  ;)

This is my FAVORITE chili!  I use Chipotle Tabasco sauce, skip the cayenne and use hot Italian sausage.  Serve with cheddar cheese, sour cream, green onions, cilantro, and, sometimes rice.  SO GOOD!

It wasn't horrible just way too sweet. My family all agreed it would be a great chicken sandwich filling if you added a tangy barbecue sauce. Its just not chili. Just for info I added one less tomato paste (people complained about it being too tomatoey) and my paprika was smoked paprika (all I had) instead. Everything else was followed exactly.

This was great, the only change I made was I added another can of beans, pinto beans. My husband cannot stop raving about it. Next time I make this i will add some sweet onions and minced garlic. I served it with Sour Cream Cornbread from this site, I made it gluten free and it too was a hit. Thank you

Good base recipe. Most people tailor it to their own family.
I used diced tomatoes with mild green chiles added. Used tomato sauce as I had to omitt the beer or my wife wouldn't have touched it.
Used 1 lb of chicken breast cubed. Didn't add the hot sauce as I had added green chiles. The Italian sausage had 3 kinds of cheese added, a nice touch. Browned all meats separately with onions added. Used Black, chili, and kidney beans. Drained everything, including tomatoes. Doubled seasonings other than hot sauce . . .turned out great !

Excellent and very easy to do.  Used ground turkey in place of chicken, and used 1-1/4 lbs of susage. Also added one small can of chopped chiles.  Next time, and there will be a next time, I will increase chili powder to one teaspoon maybe more and decrease brown sugar to 3/4 tsp.

This Chili was good, but had a bit of a sweet taste that I wasn't expecting. My 15 yo daughter absolutely loved it.

I say 4, but my husband says 3.  He did not like that it had such a strong tomato taste.  It was not the 'typical' chili.  I liked that it was different from usual.  It was not spicy at all.   I made it exactly as written.  I tried it plain and with sour cream and shredded cheddar cheese.  Both were good.  Next time I may try adding some garlic and green pepper.

This turned out awesome! The sausage gave it just the right kick and a nice meaty texture. I added some poblano peppers for a little smokiness. Would definitely recommend!

i gave it 3 stars not only because of the large amount of tomato paste but mostly because it's not a crock pot recipe.    just use one large heavy pot and finish it on the stove top. Simmer for 30 minutes.

Tried this recipe today.  Of course I cannot follow a recipe so here are the changes I made.  Omit the brown sugar, used homemade beef broth (beef cubes are nothing but salt), used hot paprika, cumin, 2/3 can of rotell tomato with peppers, about 4 oz of tomato paste, 1 plus cup of pressure cooked black and pinto beans,1 one pound can of petite diced tomatoes, sliced thin chicken breast (uncooked), used link Italian sausage (it is what I had on hand), 1 cup of black and tan beer and fresh cilantro to garnish. I also used a large white onion.  Other than that I didn't change the ingredients.  But everything in the crock pot on low for 8 hours. I added more beef broth at the end because I decided I wanted it to be a soup.

I have to say I love my slow cooker and if I can make something in it I'm going to. This is amazing. I did change a bit. I used everything called for, however before putting the stewed tomatoes in I cut them up not a fan of huge chunks of maters. I doubled the chili powder and threw in some cumin 1/2tsp and didn't let simmer as long. Hour before adding meats, 2 on high, 2 on low bowled it over some white rice and BOOM!

I didn't have any turkey or ground chicken so I used regular ground beef and pork sausage and it was amazing! Instead of red onions I just cooked onion powder in with the meat and it was so yummy and just really good. I'll for sure be making this again.

I've made it a few times, but today I used a Instant Pot. I used the pot for everything, one pot cooking.  First I cooked the chicken, I use 1 to 2 breasts diced I prefer them over ground chicken set the saute to "Normal". Then I cook the sausage. I use ½ mild and ½ medium or hot. When done I just put in a container till I am ready to combine. Then combine the tomatoes and spices. Set to slow cook on "High" for an hour.

We loved this chili, it was full of flavor and very easy to make. After reading the reviews when all done with the meat and beans, I taste tested it again and it was perfect the way it was, so I opted to NOT put in the tomato paste.  One review mentioned that it was too "tomatoie".  I didn't want to ruin a good thing so I did not put it in.  Another change was necessity, as I didn't have any kidney beans on hand, but added a can of Great Northern beans instead. It is a forgiving recipe and one I will definitely made again.  Note:  I used diced tomatoes and 2 of my cans were "fire roasted" tomatoes.  Don't know how much difference that made, but we loved it.  Forgot to mention that I did this on the stove earlier in the day and left it on low on back burner covered.  It was awesome.

In all fairness I didn't want to give it "any" star rating when I didn't follow the recipe as written, but I gave it 5 stars because I am always on the lookout for chili or stew recipes with an interesting twist, and this definitely fits the bill.  You're only limited by your ingredients on hand and personal preferences.  My changes:  omitted beer, paprika and hot sauce  (none on hand), approximately doubled the  other spices, plus added a good amount of cumin (eyeballed), Used 1 can of diced chipotle tomatoes, 1 can of tomoato paste, 1 can of Bush's white chili beans in chile sauce and 1 can of plain red kidney beans (undrained),  also added  a can of corn (drained). used 1 beef boulion cube, but only because I forgot about the 2nd one. It was a thicker chili, not saucey... served with corn muffins.   Next time, I think I'll  play around with adding all or  some of the following: diced celery, chiopped mushrooms ,red wine, and switch the while chili beans for bush's black beans in chili sauce. Maybe omit the boullion cube and thow some coco powder in there..   I think this base recipe will be a new favorite, as we are so tired of the standard ground beef chilis.

Wonderful delicious chili. Not too watery. I added cumin and 1 tablespoon of cocoa powder. Also added celery. And a can of corn. Best chili I've ever made. Used crushed tomatoes as I did not have any stewed tomatoes. Served with sour cream pepper jack cheese and crispy corn muffins.

This is a good and awesome base recipe.  At 2 hours, it still smelled too tomato-ey, so I added some cumin and paprika.  That gave it a bit of a more earthy taste as I was going to add this to baked potatoes.  At 3 hours, I decided to add some diced sausage and that seemed to top off the flavor just right.  I also garnished the baked potatoes with chopped green onions, sour cream, shredded cheddar cheese mix and salsa.  I might add fresh bacon bits next time and make hot dogs...YUM!!!

I made this chili as instructed and enjoyed it!  (Actually, I used chicken instead of beef bouillon cubes because that's what I had--not a major change, though.)  The few things that I'd change next time are to drain the tomatoes (as it was a bit too soupy for my preference), use diced tomatoes instead of the chunky stewed tomatoes, reduce the amount of tomatoes added (as the tomato taste was a tad overwhelming), and add cumin and red and green peppers for added spice.  Although I plan to make these changes for my taste, the recipe still tasted good!  (I served it over white rice.)

It is a good chili & different from the same old. However, this chili, in my opinion, was really lacking flavor. It tasted to me like thick tomato soup with meat. I added more seasoning. Still a great recipe!

Very good Chili. Took a little longer than expected to get everything prepared. I think next time I would add some more hot sauce and some jalapeno's for a kick.

My husband says it needs more of something; it's too saucy. Pasta, he said.  I used beef base instead of beef cubes, turkey Italian sausage and cooked it on the stove top for 1-1/2 hours. Had to add chicken broth. It's passable - hubby said he doesn't want to see it again in the near future, like 6-8 years.

This was the best chili I ever made. A keeper.

This was ok.  My husband liked it better than I did.  It has a very distinct tomato taste. There's 3 cans of tomatoes and 2 cans of tomato paste which overpower the chili.  It also was bland with just the spices listed.  I added an additional tbl. of chili powder to enhance the flavor.

Good recipe, but has too much tomato in it. Next time, I would eliminate one can of stewed tomatoes, and probably one can of tomato past as well. Tasted more like a meat sauce than a chili.
