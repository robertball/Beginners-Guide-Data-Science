This was ok. For my personal preference not enough spice and could use more sugar.  You mainly taste the sweet potato. * I reduced the recipe size to 2 servings*

Needed to add quite a bit more sugar. But I like them sweet :)

After that, it's great!

I used 1/2 c brown sugar and did 2x the amounts for the seasonings and it turned out really well- perfect sweetness.

Simple and simply delicious! I use canned Yams and whip all the ingredients (except marshmallows) with an electric mixer. This is always a crowd pleaser! And yes, this is understated in its sweetness (which is more than made up for in the very sweet marshmallow topping) and its spices, but it allows the fantastic flavor of the sweet potatoes to really shine. You cannot go wrong with this recipe - it is simply delicious!!

I baked the potatoes in the oven for 1 1/2 hours till done. Afterwards I let them cool and then cut them in half the long way. I scooped out the potatoes added the spices and placed the mixture back into the potato skins. Placed some marshmallows on top. A lot of compliments on the presentation.

The two-step cooking process made for an easy mash. I also added about 1/3 tsp of nutmeg, upped the sugar, and added about 1 T of butter and about 1/4 C of heavy cream to sweeten the dish.

My first time to make this! Y friend came for dinner and said "looks and tastes better than Boston Market! "  I guess that's a yes!
One thing I changed out of necessity was I had no brown sugar  so I had to use light brown sugar instead...

It was delicious.   I do admit to one substitution(Brown sugar splenda instead of brown sugar) but it turned out great.  Everyone seemed to love it as I had barely 2 helpings left over.

I attempted this recipe for Thanksgiving... I am a sweet potato lover and will eat most sweet potatoes even if they arent the greatest. This recipe would have likely been amazing with the sugar bumped up and everything else the same but of course once I started to actually make it everything went wrong for me. 

Half of the sweet potatoes I had had to be thrown away because they rotted extremely fast... 
I ended up having to use canned and didn't have much time to dry them out before adding marshmallows.
I forgot the allspice and didn't know of a similar alternative.
I couldn't find the potato masher I just had in my cabinet a few days prior so I had to use a fork and a lot of elbow grease. 

Am I the only one that has HORRIBLE luck with recipes... sometimes when it counts the most? None of my family would eat it including me. It got thrown out. I would have given it one star but it wasnt because of this specific recipe so I didn't.

It was really good! :) I used heaping amounts of the spices and sugar! We only had big marshmallows so I cut them in half. The end result was great. Happy Thanksgiving!

I love this resipe, however I did make with 1/4 cup brown sugar added 1/4 tablespoon of nutmeg and I sprinkled brown sugar and cinnamon on the top of the marshmallows.  I also made it last year and it was a hit then too.
