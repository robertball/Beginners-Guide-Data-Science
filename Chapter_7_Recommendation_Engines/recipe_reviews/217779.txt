I smoked this on my green egg with apple chips.   I did brush off some of the red pepper flakes before putting the fish on the grill.   I think it might have even tasted better cold the next day.    The slight heat worked well with cool cream cheese.

Made exactly as directed,  and it was so good, our guests were picking at the skin to get the last bits!
I served with a side of cream cheese, rice crackers and pita chips.

I have made this several times and it always gets rave reviews.  The only changes I made were to substitute bourbon for the brandy (I was out of brandy and brown sugar and bourbon are always a good mix, right?) and to smoke it for several hours (My little electric smoker did not get it near smoky enough after just 45 minutes).

My wife now says I have spoiled her for any other smoked salmon...

Made as written except that I used a smoker instead of a grill. 5 stars all the way! I don't typically care for mint but it was outstanding in this recipe. The finished result is like something you would get in a fancy restaurant (both in  look and taste). I will most definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing!
