Recipe name should be changed to Paul's Lamb and Lentil Soup and SKIP the apples. When I read the recipe I knew I would not be putting apples in it, and that was confirmed by the one review prior to mind. I put a few stalks celery and halved onions in the pot when cooking and removed when I removed the bones.

This was delicious. My family loved it and it will be one I will make over and over, especially after having a lamb dinner.

Did not enjoy this soup. The flavours of the apple and wine did not blend well with the lamb.
