I actually didn't try this particular recipe, but I make something similar very often. I cut up the cucumber, tomatoes and red onion, then add red wine vinegar dressing..I believe it's wishbone, then add salt and pepper...delicious every time! ALWAYS add salt...it makes the cucumbers absorb the dressing...makes a hug difference!

I love this salad and make it all summer long. I, too, use about half the oil, and I add a little sugar (maybe a teaspoon or two for this amount of veggies) and some chopped fresh oregano and parsley (a tablespoon or so of each--they add eye appeal, too). And I usually do a quick seeding of the tomatoes & cukes with my thumb just to help cut down on the liquid. Goes great with grilled anything!

Love the colors and taste of summer in this dish. Made this for a party so 4 tomatoes, 4 cukes, 3/4 red onion. Definitely need to deseed the veggies (loved the comment about using your fingers for the tomatoes #greatTip. Reduced to 1/4 c olive oil and red wine vinegar and added 1tsp of sugar. Also used black instead of white pepper because I was out.

This was really good but I wish I had used white vinegar instead of red wine. That's just a personal preference based on how my mom used to make it.

I made this as directed and added 1/2 teas. of sugar and it was absolutely delicious.  Love all the beautiful colors, you could add fresh basil if you have it, I am sure it would increase the taste.

Perfect!  I didn't measure anything...used less olive oil than recipe called for, but then again I think I used less veggies...so that's to taste really.  Wish I had home grown tomatoes, would've been even better, but I really loved this and it's super easy and uses ingredients I normally have.  Oh and to SpikeRox...I did use white balsamic vinegar because that's what I had (and I love on everything) and it was great.  Thank you for recipe!

I made it for a crowd on Christmas and everyone loved it. Colorful and easier than having a conventional salad on the plate with other sides.   I didn't read the reviews first and had way too much oil.  Half is the answer.

I am giving this 4 stars because it was soooo good, but I did make some changes after making a small test batch and tasting the dressing. Used half the amount of EVOO and less than half the vinegar (because it was a bit acidic), so basically halved the amount of liquid in the dressing and it was still plenty. Also halved the amount of red onion and reduced the amount of salt a bit. Added a generous heap of parsley flakes for color and flavor. Served it alongside barbecue at a big party I was hosting and it was a hit!

My husband has tummy issues so when I came across this salad I was excited.  I used an english cucumber, zucchini, green onion, a little fresh basil and like others, I added a little sugar.  Really good on those hot summer days.

Excellent! Definitely use half the amount of liquid. My veggies were floating! I let the veggies marinate in the fridge for 15 minutes then I spooned out the excess liquid. I'll be making this again and again this summer!

I loved the flavors.  The issue I had was WAY too much dressing.  I tried it with 1/4 c vinegar and 1/4 c oil and it still was too much.  The salt and pepper I left the same.  I will still make it because it was really good, but I will add much more veggies and a dash of honey.

This reminds me of the summer salads my mom made when I was a kid. I love her dearly, but she isn't the greatest cook. They say it skips a generation. ANYWAY... Instead of chopping, I sliced the onions and cukes paper thin. I sliced the onion about an eighth of an inch thick. Like the other folks, I reduced the oil by half and added some sugar. Also, I mixed the dressing, onions and cukes together first and then added the tomatoes, so they wouldn't get all beat up. Delicious!

Simple and pretty little salad that really will complement just about anything.  I cut the oil in half to reduce the fat grams with no sacrifice to flavor IMO.  There was a lot of juice in the bowl as a result of the cukes and the tomatoes releasing liquid, so I did need a slotted spoon to serve.  Next time, I might try squeezing the tomatoes a little to get some of the juice and seeds out and maybe even cut the vinegar back a little.  Nothing fancy here, just a nice little salad that is sure to please everybody.

This was amazing! I'm giving it 4 stars because I added some minor things.. A splash of balsamic rice wine vinegar, and also about a tablespoon of fresh cilantro. This is my new favorite (and healthy!) side dish/salad! *EDIT*: Be careful if you make this in advance and let it sit in the fridge overnight, the oil clumps up and goes to the top of the salad (which any kind of fat does).. Take it out of the fridge an hour or so before  serving so the oil reincorporates itself with the rest of the salad.

The recipe was very tasty.  I followed the instructions, and found that the amount of dressing produced was about twice as much as needed.   Will make it again, but halve the ingredients for the dressing.

A neighbor gave me several cucumbers, another several tomatoes, and we had several Walla Walla Sweet onions so I needed a recipe... I was almost out of Red Wine Vinegar so I used Golden Balsamic. A little Olive Oil, per recipe, and I sprinkled a little Oregano, Dill, and fresh ground Pepper on it (no salt) OMG!!  Best Cucumber salad ever!!!

Too much vinegar. Also could use something starchy, tofu or beans maybe?

7 18 17 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/223397/tomato-cucumber-onion-salad/ ... Good & definitely easy!  As SuzyQ said when recommending it, lessss dressssing - or a bigger salad.  I wonder how wild it would be to have a spring mix in a bowl, cheese & top with this & some pumpernickel croutons.  'Sounds good to me!  That extra dressing will marinate & be a dressing!  I liked it.  Thanks for posting!

I have a basil plant on my porch that is growing like crazy in the summer heat, so I added approx. 12 leaves, rinsed and chopped, to this recipe.  Refrigerated longer, approx an hour  and stirred a few times while in the fridge to blend the flavors.  It is not necessary to refrigerate that long, I happen to like cold, crisp salads in the summer time.  Delicious!

This is delish! I used English cucumber and grape tomoatoes because they are firmer, I cut back on the oil, and added fresh basil. I will make again soon!

I love cucumber salad. This was easy to make with simple ingredients. I used Vidalia onions and fresh cucumbers from the farm.  I did add some parsley flakes and garlic salt to the salad.

This is a great dish. I keep the tomatoes in wedges, the zucchini  in round quarter inch slices, and onion in strips. Don't skimp on the sugar. Balance the vinegar and oil to the sugar. Omit pepper. Add a bunch of FRESH CHOPPED BASIL.

Simple and absolutely yummy. I used hothouse cucumbers which already taste good by themselves, I planned on just dressing them with nothing else.  it was yummy right away...but then I said to myself, you know what I'll add tomatoes that sounds so good. Then I said, you know what, let me add a white onion (didn't have red) that sounds so good. So I accidentally made the whole recipe and it was good each step of the way. Its tangy and balanced. I don't really enjoy raw tomatoes but I found myself fixing the perfect bite, 2 slices of cuke, one slice tomato and a slice of onion. After letting it sit for 15 minutes it was even better. I even offered some to my teenager that I don't even like talking to because it was so good I had to share. Thank you for this recipe!

I expected this to be better.  I had orange tomatoes from a friend which were not ideal too mushy.  Next time I'll try Roma.  And it doesn't last.   But I like the dressing.  So I will try again.  By the way, I used the amounts I needed for the dressing, quarter cups instead of half.  Still needs something to pep it up.

Made it for supper this evening. Doubled everything, but could have just done half the dressing. Super saucy! But tasty! Next time I  make less dressing for sure.

Delicious. I don’t use exact measurements. Just throw in to taste. This is a great recipe that doesn’t need modifications, but works well with variations as well.  Works with white vinegar too. I put a little minced garlic and basil if have on hand, and a little Italian seasoning.

Great salad. I like it with more zest. I added jicama and a little Tajín seasoning. Used less dressing. Sharing with my family for Easter brunch. I’m sure they will love it.

My two year old couldnt get enough much to my surprise. I did add about 3tsp of honey as a binder for the vinaigrette and only made half the vinaigrette mentioned in recipe. Everything was still swimming in it but it was vibrant and crisp and went well with a mexican dinner.

Great Flavor!  I didn't have white pepper, so I made it with regular black pepper and that was okay.  It doesn't keep too long - I had to eat the leftovers within 2 days, so keep that in mind.  I will definitely make that again.

Very tasty - I added a bit of Balsamic vinegar at the end because the olive oil was a touch much. Always better after you let it sit in the fridge for a couple of hours. I plan to make this again.

This was excellent!  Read the reviews, used 1/4c light olive oil and 3/4 c vinegar, 2 T sugar, salt, pepper and some Tuscan garlic spice.  I made only one batch of dressing for 4 amounts of veggies.  When the cookout was over I just added more veggies to the juice!

Nice salad.  We revamped the recipe after the first time making less dressing, used black pepper and added chopped bell pepper.  We rate the revamped recipe 5 stars.  Great for now with loads of tomatoes and cucumbers from the garden.

8.24.2016-Quick and easy to make, but felt there was too much dressing. I would either reduce the olive oil and vinegar to 1/4 cup each or add an additional cucumber and tomato. Also, I thought the dressing could use some herbs in it, such as a little basil/oregano. Overall, the taste was good and I would make it again with some alterations. 10.9.2017-Made this again w/alterations in my original review and it was perfect for us! Steal Bookie's idea to toss it with some salad greens, which I'll be doing with the leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

I love this recipe.  I make it every week during the summer.   I halved the oil like suggested.  I also wilted the ingredients in a colander with salt for 30 minutes.   I then rinsed the salad and added the dressing.  Delish!!

This was exactly what I was looking for!!  My only modification was to sub black pepper for white pepper since I don't keep it in my pantry. Will make this again and again!

I added fresh basil, oregano, parsley and stevia leaves (instead of sugar) chopped fine in a food processor , am thinking about using the brine for fruit - blueberries, watermelon, peaches, serve it with a slotted spoon to leave behind the brine.

We really liked this simple recipe.  Made exactly as written except used black pepper.  Best when made fresh, gets a little tart after a day or two.

After reading the reviews, I altered the recipe for more flavor and less liquid.  It seemed just right to our taste.  
2 C tomatoes
2 C cucumber
1/2  C red onion
2 tsp white pepper - a bit less if you don't care for pepper
1 tsp salt
1/2 C red wine vinegar
1/4 EV Olive Oil

What a tasty and healthy salad that is easy to make. I divided it into two and cut the onion in half, just put it in mine. We started with cherries and ate the salad with BLATs! Great on the deck with ice tea or a glass of wine!

Very good, easy salad.  My rating is based on tasting it before making changes. Afterwards, I added a bit of parsley just to enhance the presentation.  This would also be a nice base recipe to build upon. Kudos to the original poster, and thanks for sharing it with us!

Yummy taste.  I doubled the amount of cucumbers and tomatoes, and ended up with leftovers.   Upon refrigeration, the olive oil congealed.   I will make with canola oil instead.  The seasoning is perfect and the red wine vinegar adds just enough sweetness I think- no sugar necessary!
