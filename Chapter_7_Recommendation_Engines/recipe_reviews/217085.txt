Thank you Grandma O'Grady for such a wonderful recipe (Grandma's are just the best cooks!!!), and appreciate you sharing it Maryann.  This cake is just so rich and moist (although I guess any recipe that uses 6 large eggs and a cup of butter is going to be luxurious!!!).  I actually choose this recipe as I needed to use up some cream cheese and loved the fact it was an newly published one.  The only thing I will say is to watch the bake time, my oven needed less than the hour.  Now that I have this wonderful recipe I plan to play around with all combinations of flavors...

This recipe has such potential!  After following the recipe exactly, I found this cake to be on the "dry" side.  Also, upon tasting, I couldn't detect the whiskey at all ~ I was so hoping for a more prominent flavor trace of it.  I will definitely make this again, however, next time I'll add maybe a bit more whiskey just to bring the flavor up a notch.  Also, I may add 1/2 cup of heavy cream and see where that takes us.

This is a great recipe! We substituted Nutmeg for the Mace and it still turned out wonderfully.

I give this 5 stars for taste! I wouldn't call this a pound cake though. It's too light. I made this in a sheet pan so I could cut it into bite size pieces for a chocolate fountain so maybe that's why it was too light. Thanks for sharing.

Oh my, sooooo good!  I made a glaze with confectioners sugar, vanilla extract- and more Irish whiskey!   Err, don't make the mistake I did and put it in a bundt pan.  It almost overflowed!

LOVED it!  To be fair, I did not have Irish Whiskey - so I used Jim Beam Bourbon Whiskey.  Delish!  After reading other reviews, I did cut my baking time by 5 minutes and I used nutmeg in place of mace.  Moist, not too sweet with just the right taste of whiskey.  Served it with Apple Berry Salsa.  Yum!

This cake was easy and delicious!  I served it for dessert on St. Patrick's day, so I added green food coloring paste for a delightful color.  Also, a topping of pistachios, butter, and sugar went into the bundt pan first and was a great addition to an already fantastic cake.  I had no trouble with the batter overflowing as did a previous reviewer.  Perhaps the bundt pans were different sizes?  I will most definitely be making this cake again!

very flavorful and cooks up perfectly.  The whisky flavor is not too powerful.  The only adjustment I made was reducing the mace to a scant pinch.

I am kind of let down by this recipe being as it is 5 stars and the great reviews. I followed the recipe exactly with the only change being that I halved it and put it into a mini bundt cake pan. I was trying out a couple of recipes for St. Patricks Day. Anyway, the problem I had was with the taste and texture of the cake. It was super sweet, spongy like, and closer to a yellowish colored angel food cake in taste and texture. The cake was almost reminiscent of a twinkie without the filling. I was so expecting a dense and not overly sweet cake from the picture, which is what I really wanted. I also lost about 1/4 of the mini bundt cakes, due to tearing on the top. Although, that was my choice to make mini ones. The cake will rise about 1/2" above where the battered is poured so plan that when choosing a bundt cake pan size.

So easy, so smooth...I may add a little more Jamison (I love Jamison's and the hint of it made me want a little more to that richness) and perhaps a wee bit more mace but wouldn't make any big changes to is as it is a wonderful finish to a St. Patty's meal (make sure to make room for it) with a cup of coffee.  It is however mouth-watering without changes and of all pound cakes I've ever made, it came out of the pan easily with a beautiful top.

This was sooo good.  Moist and not a strong alcohol flavor but the added creaminess from the cream cheese was the main taste.  Loved it!  Thanks!

I had to make due with what I had on-hand but I believe it is the method that makes this recipe superior to other pound cakes I have made.  Can't wait to try it as written.

GONE. GONE. GONE.  This was delicious.  I made it for a work St. Pat's Day party.  Everyone complimented on it. I used nutmeg instead of mace.  I used softened butter.  I bought a little 2 oz bottle of Jameson Whiskey at Binny's. (Perfect for this receipe) One thing that should be in the receipe: Butter the heck out of the pan.  I don't normally bake, so I didn't use enough butter in bottom & sides of the bundt pan and it stuck a bit. This was easy, moist and had great texture and I will bake this again. :)

Big hit at my house with the young & old.  Will definitely make again.  Great by itself, but I really liked adding a light layer of cream cheese icing.  Also, I used 1/16 tsp of cinnamon & 1/16 tsp of nutmeg, instead of 1/8 tsp mace.

This recipe was wonderful!! I made it for a Saint Patrick's Day party and everyone complimented me and loved it! I did however change the jigger of Irish whiskey to a jigger of Amaretto to the cake batter and I served it with a powdered sugar and milk glaze that I added almond extract to.  Very yummy!!! :-)

I haven't tried the actual cake yet, but the batter was AMAZING! I tasted and adjusted the amount of whiskey I used. I know I used more than the recipe called for, but I wanted more of the flavor. It is going to be so good!

This was the "bomb".   I made it with Jamison's, followed instructions, and, OF COURSE made a few additions, since it was made for St. Paddy's day.  I added two toothpick swipes of Wilton's "Fern Green" gel food coloring (which gave it that "just right" color green) and added 1/2 cup of roughly chopped pistachio nuts.  Before putting the batter into the prepared Bundt pan, I put in 1/4 cup of finely chopped pistachio nuts, added the batter, smoothed it out, did a tap, tap on the counter and baked as per instructions (although you do have to take a peek through the glass door of your oven to see that it is not too dark (ovens vary).  I let it cool 10 minutes in the pan and inverted it onto a serving platter.  Topped with non-melting powdered sugar and a green rose.  Simple and got rave reviews.

Lemon added  really made it perfect!  I added Zest from two lemons and juice from one and doubled the amount of whiskey.  I also didn’t have self rising flour so I used regular flour and added 2 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt.  Finally I made a syrup of lemon juice, zest, whiskey, vanilla and powdered sugar which I poured on hot cake still in pan (I poked holes), let it sit for ten min before turning  cake out then added more syrup to Lightly glaze the outside. YUM
