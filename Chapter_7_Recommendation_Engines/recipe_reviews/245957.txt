The first to review, how fun! I did not change anything, it's very tasty.  And pretty. However... the preparation for this does not work well.
If I made this again, I would:
1. cook the chicken, set aside
2. cook the rice by itself, according to package directions
3. cook the garlic and kale, then just toss it all together.
