Oh my goodness!  This has got to be one of the best recipes out there, by far!  It's a wonderful change for this dish and is incredibly easy to follow.  The only modifications I made were: Since I'm not a huge fan of bell peppers (unless roasted) so I added just a smidgen of roasted bells peppers and added lots of mushrooms--and instead of adding the carrots, salt and paprika toward the end I added them along with the wine and broth section.  Also, chicken broth works just fine if you don't (or want to use) have beef broth.  DON'T LET THE CHOCOLATE SCARE YOU!  I made it for my husband as a Father's Day dinner surprise (he loves my traditional southern oxtail recipe), but I wanted to switch things up a bit and celebrate his Puerto Rican heritage.  This did the trick!  It's a fantabulous recipe that will enliven your taste buds.  Kudos jetman!

Very good!  Our family really enjoyed it.  Changes I made were:  didnt have any chocolate on hand so I left it out, and I baked it covered in the oven at 325 for three hours. I thickened up the liquid at the end with a bit of corn starch.  Turned out perfectly tender.  Only problem I had was the price of the meat.  It was 5 dollars a pound- for goodness sake it is only a cows tail! I will definately make this again but cut down on the meat to afford it.  Thank you for this great recepie.

Incredibly rich. I oxtail and have been trying to find a good recipe for a while. I loved this one. I made a few changes. I used half oxtail and half stew meat (total of about 1.5 lbs of both, with no changes to other amounts), since I was cooking for several, and wasn't sure how everyone felt about oxtail. I also added in potato with the carrot. I'll probably use less meat the next time I do this, since the broth ended up reducing a little more than I expected it to. Planning on adding water to the leftovers and restewing. Thanks again for the great receipe!

This city slicker turned country girl, I have never had oxtails. This recipe is very simple to make and folllow. I made a few changes.I didn't sautee all the veggies after the meat I just simply and everything to my crock pot. I also did not have chocolate so I used unsweeted cocoa powder, 3 Tbls to be exact. I left out the peppers(I didn't have any) and added mushrooms.This dish is so delis and unique.I served mine with whipped potates on top!!

Fantastic.  Used white zinfandel (2 buck chuck variety) and smoked paprika.  Cooked on stovetop in French oven and transferred to 325 deg oven for 3 hours.  Magnifique.  Will do again and again

This is a fantastic beef stew.  I like meat, and frequently find that oxtail doesn't provide enough meat for me...so I substitute with 1kg of osso bucco, which was absolutely awesome. During the last hour, I added 1 cup of barley, and a large sweet potato instead of the the two carrots.  I also added a couple of tablespoons of corn flour to thicken up the broth.  The results were stunning, it's the best stew of this type I've ever had I think.  Will make again and again, and ensure I have cheaper white wine on hand next time (takes a whole bottle!).  Was fantastic!

Wow! Seriously rich! Wonderful, but a bit too rich even for me. To curb the rich taste I threw in chopped celery with the carrots and some chopped cilantro/coriander, bashed up coriander seeds and squeezed half a lemon's worth of juice on top of watering it way down. It didn't change the flavour but lightened it up a bit. Very easy and delicious!

Wow! Didn't expect this super result from such a simple recipe.  The only changes I made were: to put garlic in the olive oil to brown the oxtail, and more garlic for the onions afterwards.  I also added the paprika at the time I put the wine and beef broth in to start the simmering process.  I threw in a bit of saffron too.  And I added lots of mushrooms during the last 20 minutes of simmering, after the carrots were almost done.  The flavor of this dish is suprisingly interesting and exotic.  Thanks for finding and sharing it.

Excellent. I had never tried oxtail before and was amazed how rich and beefy this is. I subbed Vermouth for the wine, smoked paprika for the regular and also added extra stew meat. Next time I will either omit the olive oil or make it the day before and chill it so I can get all the grease. This is an outstanding recipe, thank you so much for sharing!

This is my go-to for oxtail. I have made it as written a number of of times, but recently started using mole paste (2-4 tsp to taste) instead of the chocolate. This makes for an extra decadent stew. Last time my toddler was asking for "brown soup" for weeks after it was gone.

This savory stew is out of this world! Thank you for sharing. It's rich in flavor; we love it with white rice.  A crowd favorite and a mainstay in our family. Marinated the oxtail with liquid smoke and we love the smoky flavor it infused into the meat. Replaced peppers with potatoes cause I didn't have any at the time. Took Shawna8573's advice and slow cooked it in the oven at 325 for 3 hours and left it in the oven while the residual heat continues to cook it (made this overnight). Reheated it for dinner and now the whole family is raving about it. Thanks again.

This is a very good recipe! The chocolate added a subtle richness. I didn't have green pepper, so I used mushrooms instead. Will definitely make again!

Expected a ton of flavor but not so much. Was attempting to expand my oxtail recipe but let me down.   Very tender but lacking in flavor compared to my go to Chinese braised oxtails.

Okay . . . I really, REALLY wanted love it!  I followed the recipe exactly.  The flavor is pretty good, but I really felt like it needed a lot of salt.  (Obviously that's easy to add).  But the biggest problem for me is how greasy it is.  The fat on the oxtail became a thick oily layer on top of the stew and I really had a hard time with that.  Maybe if I refrigerate it and scrape of the solidified fat it will be better?  Disappointed.

Excellent as written; I've made this before but this time I used Junmai Saki (on the dry side) and added a can of Italian stewed tomatoes.  Talk about fusion food!  Turned out great.

This was my first time ever making oxtails. I did manage to skip the "browning" part. It turned out great!!!

This was awful. I served boxed Mac and cheese to the kids while my husband did his duty. A disappointing waste of expensive meat. I did everything exactly per the directions. Move along and find another recipe for your oxtails.... Any other one.

this recipe serves as an excellent base with wonderful complex flavor.  I added some cremini mushrooms, fingerling potatoes, carrots, shallots and leek to the recipe, along with some mediterranean spice.  great recipe to play with to suite one's own taste but the chocolate, spanish paprika, and the white wine really give a wonderful complexity.  I like to use medium to smaller size oxtails to save a little time; they can't be rushed or will be tough.  have made this twice for male friends(one who is a marvelous cook) and they both raved.  thanks for the nice recipe.
