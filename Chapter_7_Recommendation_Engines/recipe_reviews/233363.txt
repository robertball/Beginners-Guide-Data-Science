How much food sin can one make with this recipe???? OMG!! Was awesome. There was only one negative thing about this recipe and it was the amount of batter to 2 candy bars. Either the batter amount was over kill...or there was a type-O with the amount of candy bars needed. I did mention to AR through instragram to show the batter verses candy bars. However, it took 18 regular full-size Snickers to use the batter up. And that's the only negative about this recipe I have. The rest was totally rocking the positive. My batter was extremely thick, which in this case was totally needed to hold in all that gooey candy bar goodness. They fried up just beautifully and I was totally impressed. I did try and fry one candy bar in leftover pancake batter, to see what the difference was before proceeding with this recipe and once I made the recipe I quickly knew, what the difference was. 1. Pancake batter in this case is to greasy, sweet and soggy within minutes and the bar quickly returns the candy bar back to almost the original state. 2. The batter in this recipe, is thicker, sturdier, not sweet, not as greasy as pancake batter and holds the heat in longer for the candy bar to be enjoyed when slightly cooled to the touch to handle. This was amazing!! Now, some milk for my sweet tooth coma of happiness. We already have plans to use other specialty candy bars for the next go around using this exact batter! TY sooo very much. My whole family thanks you.

I believe this recipe is perfect as is. Note to add the milk slowbut make 1/2 a recipe unless you are making many, many deep fried chocolate bars.
