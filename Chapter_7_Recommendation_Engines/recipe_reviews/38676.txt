Excellent!!! I made it even easier by using puff pastry shells instead of sheets, then topped with whipped cream and a strawberry.  My guests loved it!

I enjoyed this recipe lots and have to admit it took just a bit more work than I anticipated. The filling was scrumptious but only 4 stars because I never had marjolaine before so not sure if it supposed to be like this. After refrigerating for 3 hours part of the puff pastry was getting a bit soft (which was something I thought may happen but was hoping for it to remain crisp) and I wasn't too pleased with that. Overall this was very delicious, yummy. Thanks for sharing.
