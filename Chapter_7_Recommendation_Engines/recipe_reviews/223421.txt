Didn't have any orange-yellow cheddar, so I used extra-sharp white (what was in the fridge).  I added just a little bit of chopped red bell pepper to give it a pop of color.  The extra-sharp cheddar had a nice contrast to the briny sliced olives.  This may not sound good to some, but we thought it was pretty tasty for lunch today.  I would make again.
