I made these for a work bake off last week and won first place! Everyone loved the fruit topping - it made a big difference among all the other chocolate desserts. Very easy to make and delicious. I recommend warming the preserves a bit before spreading them to make it easier to spread -- and definitely letting the cheesecake cool enough before doing that.

Wish I would have read the reviews before I baked it.  I STRONGLY recommend warming up the preserves..  Mine looked clumpy and ugly on top of the cheesecake straight out of the jar at room temperature.  The taste however was amazing, the presentation just didn't look so pretty!  Had been craving cheesecake and this was so easy!

I followed the instructions and came up with a yummy mess. I then modified the recipe by making mini cupcakes of this recipe. I also plopped a mini white chocolate chip on top rather than attempting to drizzle.

I love this recipe. the more you beat the cream cheese the lighter it is. I like cheesecake a little more on the dense side. don't beat it as much if you like it more dense. the raspberry preserves really make it!!!!

Used this recipe for my first attempt at cheesecake and this came out better than expected.  Everyone that tasted it loved it and I even got some requests to make this again for others as well. Recipe is very easy to follow. I did make one change. I used strawberry preserves instead of raspberry and used more than called for to ensure that it covered the entire pan.  I also heated the preserves a bit to make for easier spreading as someone else suggested.

This was a big hit! I've made cheesecake before but this was simple. I did read the other reviews before starting and warming the preserves was a great idea. I also melted my white chocolate for drizzling in a disposable piping bag, started with 30sec increments until it was melted. Then I mix it around in the bag and cut a very small tip off to drizzle. The only thing I did different was changing the servings to 18 and using a 13x9 glass dish.

I would recommend adding the top white chocolate layer after cutting the cheesecake bars otherwise it cracks and doesn't look as nice as it could... But it sure is yummy!

This was a huge hit at my family Thanksgiving dinner! I just made it again for my in-laws last night, only this time I omitted the white chocolate in the cheesecake itself & just drizzled it on top. I liked it better but I'm not a huge fan of white chocolate. I say either way, its a must have recipe because its so simple to make & delicious to eat!

I haven't tasted it yet, but I just had to add a review - you should really cool the cheesecake longer than 5 minutes before adding the jam. I heated the jam a bit so it was runny but not hot, put it on the cheesecake and it sunk huge holes in it. I hope it will look prettier once it cools, i add more jam and do the chocolate - it's for teacher appreciation day!

It tastes good as hell and really simple to make. The only thing is that mine sunk in and was way too wet.

Warm the preserves....makes it SO easy to pour over!  I thought 1/4 c was too skimpy...next time I'll use 1/2 c.  I used vanilla candy melts for drizzling and a knife dipped in hot water(between each cut).  These are delicious :)

Unfortunately, I made this! Apparently it was so good that I never got any, so I couldn't tell you how it tasted! I agree with the previous reviews... found "spreading" the preserves challenging. Whipping them up with a fork to smooth them out helped, but am considering trying seedless raspberry jam next time. There will DEFINITELY be a next time!

These are superb and I've made them several times now (even my brother-in-law who doesn't like cream cheese eats these.) A few tips I've learned through trial and error I would like to add is that I always end up baking the filling quite a bit longer than recommended--usually at LEAST 10 more minutes. As per other reviews, I warmed the preserves before spreading them on which doesn't mess up/smear the filling. I also recommend drizzling the white chocolate on AFTER you pre-cut these into bars because the drizzle hardens really fast and shifts and breaks during cutting, which makes the end result less visually appealing. Lastly as a garnish, I put a frozen raspberry on top of each bar (I feel the fresh ones take away too much from the flavor of the bar itself.) Going to be making these again in a couple days for Christmas. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I made these for a surprise engagement party. Simple to make, yet look slightly elegant. I doubled the recipe according to the footnotes. Followed review suggestions to let cool or chill before adding preserves and drizzle. I Garnished with leftover Oreos. So good the newly betrothed didn't want to share!

Made this twice in a week. This an absolute great dessert. Easy to make too. I used a hand whisk rather than the mixer, baked it for 23 minutes only. I warmed up the raspberry jam to make it spread smoothly.

Turned out delicious! I made sure to cool it before I put the melted preserves and white chocolate on. Then popped it into the fridge overnight. Teen boys couldn't keep away!

I had a ready-made Keebler shortbread pie crust and made this as a pie! That, and heating the preserves for easy spreading, were the only changes I made to the recipe! The cheesecake pie was a hit!!

These bars were loved by all, no changes necessary.  Will definitely make again.
