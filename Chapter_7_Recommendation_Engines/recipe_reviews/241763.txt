I made half the recipe and only got 9, and i wish i made more..they were VERY tasty, and did remind me of summer! Instead of using lemon extract i used the juice from 1/2 lemon (6 teaspoons), and the zest from the entire lemon. I added the juice to the milk, to make butter milk, while i got out my ingredients. Also I didn't bother sprinkling sugar over the strawberries, but did decide to toss them with a teaspoon of flour(to prevent them from sinking)I used a darker pan, so cooked mine at 350 , and they were perfect at the 20 minute mark! Next time i will substitute unsweetened applesauce for the oil.

I didn't have extract so I used the zest of a lemon and 4 tablespoons of lemon juice. I also used baking powder instead of soda because I like how the powder makes a nice crown on muffins. Thanks for sharing this yummy muffin!

We really enjoyed these muffins! The only difference was I chose to use the zest of one lemon and 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice added to 1/2 cup milk. They turned out awesome! I definitely would make these again. My yield was 17 muffins. Thanks for sharing!

Loved it! They didnt turn out good after they baked because they were like tiny mountains! So i decided to cut the middles out and make a filling and it tasted amazing! I added 1 tsp of cinnamon to make it taste better I also used 3 tsp of lemon juice instead of lemon extract.. My family and guests loved it.

Sadly the baking time that is given is too long (at least for my oven) and I should have checking during the baking process because they are over cooked. You may want to time it for 15 minutes and then continue baking if theyâ€™re not ready yet. We also subbed some applesauce for the oil (using just a little oil) to get the fat content down a bit.

Ok so I made these and they turned out pretty good. Not like TO DIE FOR but good. The muffin itself was a little dry but other that that I liked them. I used less baking soda because that looked like a whole lot! I don't understand the one star reviews it definitely deserves more. It's not always the recipes fault! Anyway I enjoyed these! Thanks for the recipe! : )

I made this a few days ago and it was delicious!!  I didn't have lemon extract, though, and took advice from other readers and used lemon juice (almost 1/4 cup).  It was great and will make again, but I did purchase lemon extract.

I messed up. I should have used the lemon extract but instead used fresh lemon juice by it self. Had I added grated lemon peel to the juice it would have been perfect. Instead I ended up with strawberry muffins. No lemony taste. Stick to the recipe!

Not a great recipe. I would not make this with brown sugar and I would absolutely change the amount of baking soda. They turned out pretty but that's the only positive thing I can say for them.
