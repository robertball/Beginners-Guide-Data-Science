I was given many years ago the recipe for 'the perfect Manhattan' as follows: 2 oz. 100 proof bourbon (like Jeremiah Weed), 1 oz. extra dry Vermouth, 5 drops bitters, 1-2 Maraschino cherries plus 1 teaspoon cherry juice.  Serve over ice or not.  You won't order it 'out' as others will not be as good.

My favorite drink. I do not care for it with Bourbon though. I usually use a Canadian whiskey. It's strong, so I avoid serving it to novice drinkers or those who like sweet drinks.

Classic indeed! I prefer to use bourbon.  While I don't typically enjoy sweet cocktails, this one straddles the fence between sweet and smoky....

You have to have a basic understanding of vermouth before diving into this recipe. This recipe is fabulous (5 Star) using a good sweet vermouth. Those preferring drinks on the sweeter side can even bump that up towards a fullThe alternate recipe from Martha is also fabulous, but using dry vermouth makes it something other than a true Manhattan. There are also other high quality red vermouth on the market now

A classic recipe! I like to use Rittenhouse or Bulleit Rye. Dolin sweet vermouth is very good.
