easy recipe for bread, i made it.  i substituted a whole cup of sugar for the 3/4 cups, a stick of butter for the shortning, and poured in a little bit of corn oil.  i used two packs of dry yeast in water with a teaspoon of sugar to get it all started.  i liked the use of 4 cups of water, it made it very easy to stir in the flour a cup at a time, i blended everything until the blender wouldn't work it (about 6 or 8 cups of flour) and then started doing it by hand, made for very smooth dough.  added a second stick of butter when baking to coat the tops of the rolls so they'd brown real nice.  great recipe, thanks for sharing.

it is the best tasting bread ever. i can't make it fast enough. even though it is for a large amount already it still isn't enough! i substitute the shortening with a 1/3 cup of canola oil. it just makes the whole process a little faster. it doesn't change the flavor or texture.

This is a GREAT recipe!! I used two pkg of active dry yeast and started in one cup warm water with a tsp of sugar. I also added 1/4 c. honey, and 1/2 c. safflower oil instead of the shortening. I whisked in 7 cups, then stirred and stirred.  I made three large loaves and 6 mini loaves, for those times when a tiny sandwich is just right :). Thanks!!

Great recipe! followed exactly except for the flour, used only about 10 to 11 cups (all-purpose) and the loaves turned out beautiful and delicious. Thanks for the awesome recipe :)

I made this recipe. I halved the amount. Used half sugar and half natural Texas honey for the yeast cake. I used real yeast and let this develop with warm water. I used butter that Iâ€™d melted as the shortening. I also used butter to brown the crust. This turned out so well.

Made exactly like recepie in bread machine. When dough was done thought a little too moist rolled it out and added 1/4 to 1/2 cup of flour kneaded in until I felt it was good. Non sticky. Baked for 27 min.  Looks great. Had to tie wife to chair to keep her from cutting it before it cools.  Plan on serving with split green pea soup tonight if any bread left.

Wow!  Making bread is pretty hit or miss for me so I can't tell you how happy I am to have found this recipe.  It is perfection and works every single time.  I'm currently living in Europe and have tried other recipes with fresh yeast, with grossly disappointing results.  This dough is so versatile, working great for rolls, loaves, challah or cinnamon rolls.  Love love love it, exactly as written.
