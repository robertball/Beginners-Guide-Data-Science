I made this recipe as written and did not like it.  After adding Lawry's Seasoned Salt, fresh cracked pepper and garlic powder, I found that it still needed something else to improve the taste. I then added a can of diced tomatoes, a sprinkle of sugar to reduce the acidity of the tomatoes and 1/2 cup of mozzarella cheese. The addition of all these other ingredients made it edible but not something I would make again.

I love this dish, only changes made....I used half mild sausage and half hot.  Definitely gives it that kick!   Instead of serving with salad, we always serve with collard greens.  YUM :)
