I made this recipe twice, the first time as written and I could barley taste the coconut.  So the next time I made it I used 2 1/2 tsp. coconut extract & 1/2 tsp. of vanilla and it was much better - the coconut taste is perfect.  I made it for a party of 20 and everyone said it was PERFECT.  It takes 1 hr. & 20 minutes to cook if you use 1 large dish.  Easy to make and definately a keeper!

This flan turned out very well.  I followed the recipe exactly except I add 1/4 teaspoon of almond extract. I think the almond extract enhanced the coconut taste and made it delicious.

I thought this was very good, especially the next day.  I added 1 tsp coconut extract for a more coconut flavor, but next time I will add at least 2 like an earlier reviewer stated.  I also only used 4 eggs, because that's what I had on hand.  It still was yummy.

I loved it!  I did, however, take the recommendations and substitute Creme de Coconut for the coconut milk.  I also added a teaspoon of coconut excract.  The coconut flavor was perfect and it was a very sweet flan.  Excellent!

I used 2 egg yolks and 4 egg whites, as one reviewer suggested, and used 2 tbsp of coconut extract. The alcohol taste from the coconut extract was a bit strong, but it was still very good. I'm thinking of boiling the extract in the milk next time to get rid of the alcohol.

I made this recipe over the weekend at the request of my mother who is a flan lover. I did not have coconut milk so I substituted with equal amount of grated coconut. I think it gave it a nice texture. I had to adjust cooking time to 2 hours because at the end of the first hour it was still very liquid in the middle. I used a 3 qt glass (pyrex) baking dish as indicated. Overall great tasting dessert. Will make it again really soon.

This is a bad recipe. The flan had no taste - not enough coconut or vanilla. There was not egough egg to set the large amount of liquid in the baking time specified.

Absolutely great recipe! Just add the same amount of coconut extract flavoring and you'll love the more pronounced coconut flavor.  I also substituted the coconut milk for coconut cream.  Turned out delightful!!!

oh. em. gee. The first two times I made this, I thought it was sooo good. But both those times I accidentally forgot to add the whole milk, and the resulting texture was delicious, but firmer and tasted eggier than as the recipe calls for. If made to the recipe's specifications, this is so fluffy and delicious it will MELT in your mouth! And none of that yucky eggy taste. I'm sitting here taking it all away from my guests to gobble it up in the privacy of my room because it is THAT good. I added a generous helping of vanilla [2 tspn?], a little coconut extract and a teeny bit of almond extract. In Canada, sweetened condensed milk isn't sold in 14oz cans [as far as I could see] so I had a little less, but I think not being overly sweet adds to the charm of this dessert, and it is still sweet and custardy. It is also important not to let your sugar burn/brown to much, as the flavor WILL show through. I gave up and put it in the pan still slightly lumpy this time around because I can't seem to avoid slightly burning it, and it turned out just fine. I've also made it with a sprinkling of cardamom and it turns out HEAVENLY, tastes like a chai flan or something. This recipe is enough to make two pans - WHICH YOU WILL NEED. One for you, one for everyone else :D Some notes: it will deflate slightly when cooled and lose some of its volume, so you can think about cooking in a deeper pan. Also, DO NOT FORGET THE WHOLE MILK. num num num. thank you so much for the recipe!

This dish is phenomenal! I took it for a Mexican potluck at work and everyone said it was by far their favorite dish.  The coconut flavor is mild, not at all overpowering.  Absolutely delicious!!
I could make this every week!  It's Mexico's answer to Creme Brulee!

I made this flan and I hoped that it would taste like coconut but sadly no coconut flavor.  I added a tsp. of vanilla & almond extract and it added a nice almond flavor.  I also used lowfat milk.  Next time I will try the recipe with cream of coconut.  I also only cooked it for 1hr.

Another tip is to make the caramel in a non-stick pan.

This was great! I loved it and so did my whole family. The only thing I suggest is to add extract of coconut to the mixture, with just the coconut milk alone you really don't get that coconut taste. Other than that....it was great!!! Thank you!

I wasn't impressed with this recipe at all.  It was really watery and you could not taste the coconut. I think the whole milk killed it.

This turned out perfect, even though I left out the regular milk (oops - was too excited!).  I added two teaspoons of coconut extract.  I think one would have been enough for my personal taste.  This was good, but I still like "original" flan better.

The recipe works just fine as it's listed, and the texture was absolutely perfect.  The carmelized sugar was awesome.  The only problem was that the flan itself was almost bitter, no sweet flavor as you would expect from the ingredients.  The sugar helped, though.

I made this recipe, dividing it in two parts.
In one I added 1/2 small can of pumpkin, 1t cinnamon, 1/2t ginger, 1/4t ground cloves. 
In the other, I added about 1/3 package of creamed coconut.
They were both so delicious, and the recipe is so simple! It's almost cheating to make this.

Very Dissapointed with the lack of coconut flavor, also an hour is way to long to cook a flan. I should have pulled them out around 40-45 min, they were over cooked. Will not make again :-(

This was a very tasty flan -- however, I was  disappointed at the subtleness of the coconut flavor. I might try some subsitutions - maybe cream of coconut instead of the condensed milk, to make the coconut flavor stand out.  Also -- I ended up stirring the sugar to prevent burning and the caramel came out great. Also, I used 2% milk instead of whole milk and the consistency was still perfect. A very easy recipe!

Mixed results.  Overall flavor was good, texture was not.  The directions didn't impress me.  I don't know how to cook/bake (etc) and am slowly teaching myself with the help of recipes found online.  It's surprising how poor directions frequently are, when one isn't sure of what they are doing.  The end result was not nearly as good as it could have been, and that's disappointing.

The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly, but after tasting it the coconut flavor lacked considerably so the next time I made it I added roughly 2 TBS of coconut extract and it turned out perfectly. I've used this recipe for several years and it is one of my most requested desserts. It probably helps that I am from the beautiful Isles of Hawai'i and as cliché as it might be, we love coconut!

Thanks for sharing a little bit of your family with the world!

Just like in a restaurant! My fiancée loved it. I served it with a sprinkling of dried coconut flakes and blueberries. I made it for 6 servings, which filled a 8 x 10 inch pan.

I followed the recipe exactly and it it delicious! I did use brown sugar for the caramel but that doesn't make a difference as far as I'm concerned.

I've made this recipe several times and everyone loves it.  It's the perfect flan recipe.  My son wants it for his birthday party instead of a cake.  It's creamy and rich tasting, but not cloying.  The next time I make it I may add some flaked coconut, but I'm not sure if I should change a perfect recipe

Thanks for the recipe. In my experience, I added 1/2 cup of coconut flakes. I forgot to add the 1-1/2 cups of milk and was worried about stiffness but instead, it still took 1.5 hrs to bake/set--with the oven turned down to 300F. The coconut flakes rose to the top and started to brown so I covered it in the last .5 hr. When is the right time to add the flakes--does anyone know? Finally, I didn't have vanilla so I added 1/4 cup vanilla syrup but it still wasn't sweet enough.
