A great recipe to use as a base and incorporate ingredients I had on hand...  I added a little honey to the olive oil/lemon juice dressing.  Used a combo of napa cabbage and red leaf lettuce.  Added shredded carrots and some fresh cilantro in addition to the parsley; peanuts instead of pistachios.  I made this as a main dish salad, but I agree that it would make a good side, too.

This was lovely!  I'll admit that I doubled the dressing recipe and used peanut oil as I had no pistachio oil. But it was delicious and tasted great the next day.

This was okay--not bad at all, just not great. There just wasn't much to it. Like the previous reviewer, I doubled the dressing. The lemon was too much for me--I usually don't add sweetener to vinaigrette even when the recipe calls for it, but I added agave nectar to this (maybe the pistachio oil would have sweetened it up a bit--I couldn't find it, so I used almond oil). I think it could have used more basil, as well. Pistachio and lemon is a good combination, though, so I think I'll keep this as a base and just tweak it to suit my tastes.

This is now a family favorite. AT family gatherings we can number into the 30 and this salad is required for all gatherings.   I've used rice vinegar instead of lemon juice, added cranberries and/or honey to add a bit of sweetness. It really is a wonderful light and tasty salad, I have found it to stay good in the freg for several days, fyi.

I had just bought a beautiful Napa cabbage at our farmer's market and this recipe looked like a perfect fit for it.  I didn't have several ingredients on hand, so I did as a reviewer suggested and used this as a "base" - I actually used sunflower seed oil, apple cider vinegar, and sunflower seeds in this.  Used Lemon Pepper for salt & pepper.  Doubled the oil/vinegar mix as others had suggested.  Still kind of bland, but it may be because I didn't make it far enough in advance for the flavors to really meld.  Will try it again sometime.

Very light and refreshing.  I ate part of it as recipe states, then added some spicy shredded chicken, avocado,  and dried cranberries.  Excellent main dish salad!

Used avocado oil.  Pistachios are a great touch and really make the salad.

I added some diced celery, but kept everything else the same.  I was delicious!!  The lemony dressing was perfect, tangy.  It was even great the next day.

Not sure where you can find the pistachio oil that this recipe calls for, so I used avocado oil instead. Still a very refreshing, light salad.

This was an ok salad for us.  The flavors were nice, but kind of on the bland side for us.  We did like the taste of the pistachio in the salad.
