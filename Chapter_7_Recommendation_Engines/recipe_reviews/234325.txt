These were super easy to make and tasted great, very sweet though. Will have to say, there was a lot more batter then 2 bananas could utilize. It took over 4 really long bananas to use up most of the batter. I also think I didn't cut these at 1/2 inch either. They were more like an inch thick. And to me, that was perfect size. And I used my deep fryer, which was simpler. Otherwise, these were so tasty and the bananas were extremely soft from the frying that I was popping them left and right into my mouth. I'm not one for baked or fried bananas unless it's in bread but these were amazing. I didn't play nice and had a hard time sharing ;-) TY will make again.

I have a little one and wanted and easy breakfast finger food. I left out coating them, because I thought they would be sweet enough on there own. These are great and my little one loved them. We will be making these again.

It was a great recipe that my 7 y.o could help with. I think I will add some vanilla extract to the pancake batter next time. Thanks!

Fun and easy made them with the help of my 3 year old. I used Kodiak brand pancake batter which is a little different consistency (may explain why they fell open) but made them high protein bites. Yummy.

Ooooh wow! These were easy & fun - the kids enjoyed shaking them in a bag of cinnamon sugar. Served with apple slices & "peanut butter apple dip" also on this site. Will absolutely make again. Great idea, thank you!!

I had pancake mix that I was never going to use so I made these. Such a great idea, and turned out perfect following the exact recipe. After using bananas there was leftover batter, so I experimented with frying other treats, like El Fudge cookies. By far the easiest way to make batter and delicious fried deserts or breakfast.

Fun to make with kids. Too sweet, though-a light dusting with powdered sugar is All these need!
