Good recipe.  I've made a turkey chili similar to this for a few years.  I find the proportions here are substantially similar.  Some of the time, I have to omit the bay leaf (personal taste) and tone down the red pepper flakes and add a bit of garlic.  But all in all, this recipe is fine.  Thank you for sharing.

This is almost just like I make. The only difference is I sautee a chopped green bell pepper in with the onions. I also use a jar of black bean salsa (or whatever salsa I have on hand) instead of the can of tomato sauce & add a pinch of brown sugar. My daughter likes corn in chili, so I add that too! :) My latest addition is chilies in Adobo sauce. Adds a nice smokey authentic taste! Add to your taste though, they can get hot if too many.

I guess you like your chili spicy because we used 2 tablespoons of chili powder and we couldn't eat it because it was so spicy. Did you use a specific type of chili powder?

Amazingly delicious! I followed recipe exactly and the flavor is delicious!!! Never had chili with red wine in it. A fun variation to my regular chili. Will definitely make again!

We are on a low cal. diet and this was the best recipe for turkey chili.  It has a lot of favor.  I can eat only one cup and it satisfies.

I cooked this recipe Sunday and it was great. My family loved it.  I forgot to add the red wine.  It was a simple and quick recipe.  I will try it with the red wine next time.  It was not as spicy as I thought it would be.  I love garlic and I added lotsa garlic to the recipe.  I added a whole thing of garlic!

I make this about the same, but I like to add whole canned mushrooms and pork and beans with molassas.I add a couple packages of already made chili spice you can buy at any store instead of the cumin, parsley and oregano.  The combination is perfect.  All in all an awesome recipe. Thank you for sharing.

I use this recipe now and again because I always have all of the ingredients in the pantry.  That being said, it always turns out pretty bland and I end up having to almost double the seasoning.  It's good, just needs some help!

This recipe is superb! ground turkey is an excellent alternative to ground beef. Ground turkey is even leaner than extra lean ground beef (which is very dry I might add). I personally don't like kidney beans, so I replaced that with a can of corn. If you're going to take out any of the beans, make sure you replace it with something similar or your chili might turn out a bit saucy. Other than that, I put one bay leaf in because I found it a bit overpowering with 2 (but still enjoyable). 
The other thing I need to add is that there are different kinds of chili powder. There are spicy chili powders and more mild versions. I make mine with Mexene brand chili powder. I find it a perfect balance. It can be hard to find, but it's worth every minute you spent searching.
Happy chili!

Great chili, I didn't add the corn, I'm not really big on corn and made it a bit more spicy. Great stuff. Would totally recommend it.

Followed all directions, except I had no red wine to add. Prior to serving, I added green onions, a dollop of sour cream, and a little cheddar cheese. We found the consistency and spices excellent--truly a good balance.

I never made chili before this but man oh man is it ever good! I made it with turkey the first time, beef the second. The third time I made it with both chunks of beef and ground beef. So delicious! Tastes awesome with a little cheddar cheese on top and some garlic toast on the side.

This was the first time I have made chili using ground turkey and it was very yummy!   It was simple to put together and made the entire house smell wonderful as it simmered on the stovetop.   The only thing I did differently was to use a full tsp. of red pepper flakes and half a diced fresh jalapeno because we really like it spicy!  I would definitely make again.  Thanks for the recipe!  1/1/13  Just changed my rating from a 4 to a 5.   After sitting a day this chili was so, so much better!  The flavors really had a chance to meld together and just made it even more flavorful!

Ok my taste buds must suck and my families, cuz this was really REALLY bland! Everyone that had some said so as well. I give it a two star cuz you can un make it bland which brought the flavor out, but I had to add quite a bit of garlic salt and onion powder. I followed ther recipe to the T too. I couldn't even taste the wine, maybe the seasoning and wine needs to be doubled? Just mind boggles me people are saying 2 T. of chili powder made it too spicey to eat... I can't handle spice and this was about as spicey as baked beans.

Another 4.5-star rating, I would say. Made pretty much as written, except for a bit of salt while the meat was browning and subbed minced (dried) onion, as that was all I had on hand. Also only had a small can of tomato sauce, so I added just a bit of "jar" marinara and a can of Rotel tomatoes, as I prefer my chili a bit "chunkier" than the crushed tomatoes made things. Also added about a tsp. of coriander (and skipped the parsley, as I don't really see the "point" of that herb, especially in chili). Then added quite a bit of chicken stock to loosen things up a bit. Added just a sprinkle of red pepper flake, given the pepper in the Rotels.  With the understanding that chili tends to be better the second day when the flavors have the chance to "marry up", I'm quite looking forward to tomorrow! Thanks for this recipe.

I've made alot of different chili recipes over the years and this one is perfect.  I did add corn and a tablespoon of spenda because I like the sweetness with the spiciness of chili.  This will be my go to chili from now on.  Thanks

I made this recipe for a holiday gathering. I have my own chili “recipe” I normally use but I wanted to try something new, and I liked the red wine in the chili. It was a big success!! Even a couple of my guests aren’t big fans of chili liked it!! The spices ratio was spot on - delicious without being too in your face (or mouth) chili powder. This will become my new normal recipe!!

Made this chili for my hubby and I and we loved it!! I used reduced sodium beans and tomatoes and it's great for those with dietary restrictions (watching their salt intake). Does not need any added salt and the amount of zesty flavor is just right, even for Bunco or potlucks ??. Fast and easy. Simple ingredients that I always have on hand too. ?? Highly recommend!

Great recipe!! Used a tablespoon and 1/2 of worcestershire sauce instead of red wine and topped with pickled jalapeno, colby jack, and sour cream ( as in picture). Will make this again and again!!

My husband and I loved this chili recipe! I made it today and used chopped up oven roasted turkey breast. I put everything in the crockpot on low and let it cook for about 4 hours. I made corn muffins to serve with this healthy recipe. The chili turned out great!! Thank you, Valarie!!!

We found this chili flat on taste sorry. 
Certainly not the best we’ve ever had.
We added more seasonings which is somewhat of an improvement.

The recipe was simple to make. The only change I made was to add a quarter of  a jalapeño  pepper finely chopped to add a little more spiciness. The chili was delicious and I would make it again!

I left the wine out because I was making it for a scouting event. It also needed a lot more heat. That may have made the difference between good and great. Next time ... the wine.

Absolutely delicious!  This will be my go-to recipe for chili - that’s for sure.  (One change I accidentally made was that I added half a cup of wine, instead of 1/4C, but it tasted great.)

This is a great recipe. Followed it exactly, except for adding the red pepper flakes, and it tastes amazing. Very easy to follow and execute!

I absolutely loved this! I only used black bean because my family does not like beans & omitted the other 2 beans and followed the recipe as written. I topped each bowls with cheese, avocado, sour cream and chives. Loved it! Was even better the next day.

The most rich turkey chili I have ever made!   I added a bit of Ancho Chili powder for a bit of kick and it added a great smokie flavor!  Wine makes it extra rich.

I am a Texas native, but full transparency: I am not a chili purist so I'm not afraid of beans in my chili. We loved this recipe! It just tastes great! I did use the full 1/4 teaspoon of red chili flakes and it was the right amount of heat. I served it with some Jiffy cornbread. I had added some fresh off the cob corn to the cornbread, and put what was left over in the chili. (Don't tell anyone, I might get kicked out of the state). Made taco salad with it for lunch the next day. Will make this again  when we actually have some cooler fall football weather.

The Best Turkey Chili Haiku: "Bold, to say 'the best', but hey, it was very good!I would make again." Halved the recipe for 3 of us, dropping the pinto beans, but keeping black and kidney; kept all of the other scaled-back ingredients the same, put it in the crockpot late morning and it was chirping and smelling great come dinnertime. It needed a heavy squirt of Sriracha, sprinkle of cheese, and tortilla chips for crumbling and dipping, but my 7 year old daughter loved it, so that's enough to convince me to make again, only maybe increasing the spices a bit.

This was a good base recipe for me.
I added garlic salt to taste and an additional clove of garlic ~1 teasp
I used 1 full teaspoon of pepper flakes
1/2 cup of red wine (sweet - not dry - was on hand)
pulled back on the cumin
better cooked in the crock pot
added corn (3/4 cup)
served with cheddar; nacho chips.  Enjoyed by the entire family

This recipe turned out great.  I made it with all the listed ingredients in organic form.  The only substitution I made was to use Organic Diced Tomatoes rather than the Crushed tomatoes.  My husband and I enjoyed it that way.

Great recipe! I will definitely be making this again! No changes needed to the recipe but I did add two more cans of beans to make a bigger batch. All of the spices added lots of flavor.  Hubby loved it too.

I am a seasoned cook and this was my first time  ”evah” (a little Boston accent there) making chili. My hubby is king of chili as he has been making it for years and his is always in demand. This recipe turned out awesome. Enough heat as written but I did add 1/4 jalapeño pepper at the end to spike the heat just a bit. Hubs loved it and that says a lot.  Made it for Super Bowl. Go Pats!

This was delicious. I added spinach that I had in the frig. I doubled the batch and we are still heating it up and eating it. We serve it over spaghetti, eat it alone, mix it with rice, etc.. I will make this again and again.

Great recipe.  I did a few tweaks, my normal by adding a half finely dice Serrano for some add'l heat.  I roasted a couple tomatillos and added for some different flavor.  Overall, I'd say this is good to go as is and definitely a base to work upon if you like to go the custom route.

Very good!! I didn't add the can of pinto beans, and only 1 cup of black beans. Also, I cut back on the ground turkey, but that is only my preference. I cooked the onions and garlic separate in a bit of olive oil.  There's only my husband and I to feed so this makes for 2-3 meals, or I suppose I can freeze a portion of it. But I like not having to cook for a few days, so leftovers are a bonus! Oh... and I only added a tsp of chili powder as the chili powder I have is super hot! I love these types of meals because you can leave ingredients out and add ingredients to your liking. Thanks for the recipe!

Fabulous! Only thing I did different was add corn and cilantro, and I left out the red pepper because my family are all a bunch of snowflakes (so I put it in my own bowl). Thumbs up from everyone! I finally have a "go to" chili recipe - thanks!

Delicious recipe...I added green peppers just because I love them in chili and minced a red hot pepper in place of the red pepper flakes.

Loved this chili!  The only changes I made were to add a 15.5 oz can of yellow corn, drained.  I also omitted the red pepper flakes as my husband doesn’t like that much spice.  Printed this recipe and will definitely make it again.

I made it almost exactly like the directions except I substituted white northern beans for the pinto beans (not really much difference).  Plus I used 1/2 turkey & 1/2 beef.  It was good, but I usually make pretty good chili.  I put the chili over a small amount of quinoa.  

I will make this chili again as it was tasty and I have a bottle of wine to use up.  It was worth trying.

I bought a six pack of pumpkin at Costco.  There was a recipe  for turkey chili on the can.  Same basic recipe but add a can of pumpkin.  You can't really taste it but it add fiber, texture and some vitamins.

I make something very much like this. But yours has more liquids and I am going to try it your way. I add some chorizo sausage, and season until to taste. It freezes very well, always on hand in 2-portion size.

This chili was delicious and easy to make.  I did not have any red wine but it was fine without it.  I did use some red pepper flakes and my husband added some jarred halepeno slices to kick it up some more.  I will definitely make this again!

This is an excellent chili recipe.  I used 2 cans of mixed beans (black, chili and pinto) and 1 can of chili beans.  I also pureed 1 can of whole tomatoes (better than store bought sauce) and used 2 cans of diced tomatoes.  I could have probably used another small can of whole tomatoes - pureed.  Delicious!

I just substituted for the wine (I'm an alcoholic) - grape juice and a capful red wine vinegar, and cut back just a hair on the beans leaving a 1/3 of each bean in the can, added 1/2 jalapeno, cleaned and diced,  and  served it with chopped green onions and shredded Mexican cheese as help youself toppings.  Everyone loved it, came back for seconds.  This will be my SuperBowl dinner chili.

This is very similar to what I do  except this has wine, which we liked and much less onion,garlic and chili than I normally use.  We liked it.

I make this for my wife and I at least 4 x a month and we really like it. I add a can of vegetarian Bush's baked beans which makes it go further and tastes great also. I fry up the onions & garlic in a little olive oil & add them to the cooked turkey followed by all the other ingredients. We enjoy eating healthy and this is a great dish with low if not no fat. Make it because it is an absolutely awesome meal..

It was okay--certainly edible--but not "the best" in my opinion. My preference would be for more beans and less meat. I also like having other vegetables in there to increase the volume and add some texture and flavor variety. Typically, I'd expect bell pepper and maybe corn to be in there. I've made chilis with carrots and even sweet potatoes (Chef John has a fantastic recipe on this site).  I did like the flavor the red wine added. This chili was certainly easy to make, but the flavors were mainly tomato (a LOT of tomato!), turkey, and beans. Toppings might have helped, but I want chili to be great by itself.

Great recipe and easy peasy. I added a small can of green chiles and I didn't have any pinto beans so subbed cannellini which were great . I would have never thought of adding red wine. We'll definitely make this again!

Very good,quick  and easy.I used onion powder and kicking chicken spice as extra with no diced tomatoes or red wine. I also threw in a can of baked beans cause it needed more beans. Any beans work with chili  I love them but unfortunately my family does not.Compliments to the chef.

Great recipe! I didn't have the wine on hand and used canned diced tomatoes with green chilies (because that's all I had in the cupboard), so it turned out spicier because of the chilies. Threw in a bit of corn as well. Green chilies and corn added a bit of color. Served with tortillas  and might top with diced onions next time.

This was my first time making chili, I found this by searching online for a recipe that would help use up all the dried beans I've got in my pantry. I only changed two things: substituting dried beans for canned (I soaked & cooked them the day before) and cooking the onion and garlic in the pot for a few minutes before adding the turkey. Turned out very good, I'm excited to make this again!

My family LOVED this recipe! I used diced tomatos instead of crushed (thats what we had in the pantry), two cans of kidney beans and chicken broth instead of water. I thought we were going to have enough for leftovers but boy, was I wrong!

Great recipe! I made it just like the recipe but added fire roasted green chilies to spice it up a bit. So delicious!

I used a mixture of beef and turkey and it turned out great. We like our chili spicy so I added fresh diced Jalapenos to a a little more heat. Served this to a group of friends and they couldn't get enough of it!
