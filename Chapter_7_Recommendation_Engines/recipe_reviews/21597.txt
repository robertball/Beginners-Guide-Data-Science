I used whole wheat tortillas, and the end result was nice and chewy (not tough, as other reviewers have said).  The sweetness of the apples and sauce was well-balanced by the nutty flavor of the wheat torillas. Also, I made my own apple pie filling, using about 4 cups of thinly sliced apples, about 2/3c. white sugar, 2Tbsp. flour, a little water, and cinnamon and nutmeg to taste.  Bring to a boil, then lower heat and simmer until apples soften (about 5 minutes)

This is the best desert I've ever made. Instead of canned pie filling I used fresh diced apples, sprinkled with cinnamon and a couple tablespoons of apple butter, and then softened in the microwave for a few minutes.

I loved them so much I made them with bananas and chocolate chips also!

Yuk! I tried this recipe just the way it is written and the tortillas were really tough.  Next, I tried it with uncooked tortillas and, although they weren't tough, it just didn't taste very good.  I give up.  I won't try it again.

Wonderful Recipe....easily 5 stars!!  Whole family loved it more than most apple pie.  Hubby said tortillas were better than pie crust, which he has never been fond.  I did spread tortillas with 8oz softened cream cheese and added 1 tsp vanilla to the sauce....divine!!  It's in our permanent collection!  Thanks Brenda.

You can't miss with this easy and delicious recipe.  Even my meat-and-potatoes-only teenage son, "the no-dessert-thanks-Mom" guy loved these.  And I appreciated how quick and easy they were to make!  I made a huge batch for a family gathering and they were really a hit.  Next time I think I'll take a suggestion from my sister-in-law and toss in some walnuts and golden raisins.  And I'm sure there will be many more next times to try different variations!

These were so delicious.  I took them to a fellowship dinner and the entire plate (doubled) was gone!  And I was asked for the recipe several times.  They remind me exactly of apple dumplings and so much easier to make then the recipe I have used for years!  Tastes great with cream as well as ice cream.  :) (I used 6 in. tortillas) Yum!  I cant believe how easy, inexpensive, fast, and delicious this is!

My husband and I love this recipe! It couldn't be any simpler or quick.  Bring your favorite side of ice cream to the table with this recipe and you won't be disappointed!  Get's better after a few days even... we eat it up in about 3 days.

I absolutely love this dessert!  It is fabulous and so easy to make.  I put in 1/3 cup of margarine instead of 1/2 cup butter, but otherwise no changes.  EXCELLENT DISH!

The kind of tortilla, as well as cooking time, makes all the difference! I have now made these several times to rave reviews. there are different thicknesses of tortillas depending on brand. Textures vary also: some brands are tough and gummy due to all the dough conditioners and additives (read the label!). This, as well as the brand of pie filling, may account for the varied results (don't skimp--make or buy a quality filling that says "more fruit" if you can). I have been using thicker tortillas, but am curious how thinner ones would work. I like these best with ALL (light) brown sugar. Don't overcrowd in pan--a 9 x 13 GREASED or lined pan is great--the more exposed surface area, the crunchier it gets. I also cooked about FORTY minutes, until it looked browned.   Note *** When making in advance, it is best to keep the sauce separate from the filled enchiladas until 30 minutes before baking. I let one batch sit way too long and the cooked tortillas were tough.  9/20/10

I've made this a few times.  I find it needs to be cooked for about 40 mins to become golden.  Everyone loves this whether it is hot or cold, fresh or day old.  Looks like you spent hours in the kitchen (I let them think I did!!!)

Very delish! I used fresh apple slices instead of pie filling, and next time I will reduce the amount of water because the sauce was thin.

This is a wonderful and versatile recipe. I've now made it a couple times with great results. I substituted Stouffers frozen escalloped apples(thawed)for the pie filling.  This was easier than making my own filling and tasted better than the canned filling. I also spread each of the tortillas with about 1 tablespoon of cream cheese before adding the filling.  Sprinkling about 1 cup of chopped pecans over the rolled tortillas gave them a very pretty appearance and added to the taste. The last time I made it I used cherry filling and everyone loved it!  It's great for dessert or for a breakfast brunch.

My husband says this is the best dessert I have ever made (and I have made a lot of desserts!).  I changed the recipe per suggestions of other reviewers and made an apple pie filling rather than using the canned filling.  I used 4 Granny Smith apples and 3 Fujis.  I microwaved them for 8 minutes to soften and then added 1 c. white sugar, 1 tsp. cinnamon, and 1 T. flour. Then I filled the tortillas with this mixture.  I added the syrup on top (except I forgot about the butter and added it on the top all at the end).  Baking time was about 30 minutes to get the golden brown appearance!  YUMMY with vanilla ice cream!

This was a great recipe.  Mine did get a little soupy also, but I think the solution is to make less sauce next time and to use a different pan.  I used a pretty small pan and the sauce covered the enchiladas.  So even though next time I'm going to modify it I still give it 5 stars!  Oh and I added carmel topping when it was all done over the enchiladas and ice cream YUMMY.

This recipe was very good and oh so easy.  I am a catering manager and was looking for something a little different, We use canned apple slices, drained the jucie off the apples in to sauce pan and used in place of the water and added a touch of cinnamon.  Not to sweet, just right. I will be using this one again.

OH MY!  The 1st bite reminded me of those wonderful carnival elephant ears!  The flavor of the butter was just enough to send me to heaven!  I served them with vanilla ice cream and I sprinkled a little cinnamon sugar on top all of it.  I will add a little less water next time to thicken the sauce a bit.  We had "regular" enchiladas for dinner and one of my daughters (6yo) asked me if we were having dessert.  I told her, "Yes.  Enchiladas."  She was soooo bummed until she laid her eyes and taste buds on this!  This is a keeper!  Thanks for sharing Brenda!

If you need a quick dessert and have the ingredients on hand this works.  It is very sweet.  I used wheat tortillas and a can of fried apple slices in cinnamon.  I drained the apples and cut them into bite size pieces.  Make sure you cover the ENTIRE enchilada with the sauce if you want a softer enchilada.  The ends of the roll can get tough and chewy.  Too avoid this you can use brush to sauce or just cover with foil the first 10 minutes of baking.  When I made the sauce I used half of the apple juice from the can with half the amount of water to give more flavor. I did not add the cinnamon because it came in the apple filling.  Served warm with vanilla ice cream.  Not nearly as good cold or the next day.

These were insanely good.  I needed a quick dessert for a Mexican-themed dinner after my flan failed.  They were so easy to make, and everyone loved them.  I did keep them in a few extra minutes to get a little crisp -- that worked well.

I thought this recipe was good...the tortilla shells came out a bit tough, but it was still good.  I did add a bit of vanilla to the sauce to suit our tastes.  This is an easy dessert recipe that I know i will be trying again.  Thanks for posting.

I used only 6 tortillas and spread them with a mixture of 1 package cream cheese and about 3/4 cup powdered sugar.  I also made 1 1/2 times the sauce and poured it over the dessert with ice cream.  It was really easy and good.

Good recipe, but I would use smaller tortillas and not so much filling next time I make it.  This recipe made pretty large tortillas.  

I spread cream cheese inside, which was an excellent suggestion!  

The sauce on top is amazing!!  Will make again, but will make smaller enchiladas, more like taquitos.  
Thanks!

These were very easy to make and very good.  You use only a few ingredients that could be kept on hand in case you needed a tasty desert in a hurry.  Tasted like apple pie, served with ice cream...yum

Very tasty!  I had the caramel apple pie filling and used that.  Rich and delicious with vanilla ice cream.  Our personal opinion was no vanilla is needed in recipe.  Thanks for sharing a keeper!!

If you follow the recipe as written, 4 stars. If you add cream cheese to the tortillas before adding the rest of the ingredients, 5+++ stars! I made mine with leftover cream cheese frosting and it tasted divine! I also made 2 without the frosting to test the difference, and they were just OK compared to the ones with frosting.

An easy and delicious recipe. Maybe better than apple pie! I sprinkled a little brown sugar on top of them before baking to add a sweet touch.

Looks fabulous and tastes great.  Like others, I added the cream cheese to softened (microwaved) 6inch flour tortillas.  I think the smaller size tortilla is sufficient. For efficiency, mix the cinnamon in the apples.  Only used canned cause I didn't have time to make home made.  I can't how great it is with just canned apples.  Presentation was great--yum warm with ice cream

I made this with cream cheese as others had suggested.  It is fun and different and was well liked.  I think the tortillas make it a little tough, though.

Fantastic apple pie flavour, easy/quick to make...I did add about a tablespoon of corn starch in with the sugar, just to thicken up the sauce...it is awesome...I  will definitely be adding this recipe to my favourite collection.

This dessert is AMAZING! I am studying abroad right now and didn't have access to apple pie filling, so I chopped up 5 apples and simmered them with water, cinnamon and some sugar. I followed the rest of the recipe as listed. They were so rich that we could only have half each-with ice cream of course! People throughout the hall were coming in and wondering what smelled so delicious. Huge hit- I'm now a floor favorite :)

This was terrific. The sauce is a bit thin so next time I will thicken it up with a bit of cornstarch. I made using the apple pie filling from this site. I will make again.

My family absolutely loved these enchiladas so much that my husband had two! I followed the recipe exactly. The tortillas make an easy wrap for the apple pie filling and the sauce is heavenly and sweet. This is recipe I will be wowing people with for a long time.

These are awesome! They did not come out chewy, as others have mentioned theirs did, I believe the key is to soak them for 30 min. as stated. I smeared cream cheese on each tortilla before adding apples. Next time I will also sprinkle on some pecans. They are delicious and very sweet. I could only eat 1/2 an enchilada. Would be great with ice cream. Thanks for this great recipe!

I made this for church and everyone raved. I did cover it for the first 15 min of baking and spread a layer of cream cheese mixed with cinnamon on the tortilla before I put the apple filling on it.  Will be making this again--will be terrific with ice cream or whipped cream.

This turned out heavenly. I'm not sure why others said their sauce turned out watery with 1/2 cup of water. I think those people must have skipped the step where you let your sauce sit for 30 minutes on the enchiladas. Next time I'm going to double the sauce (1 cup sugar, 1 cup b. sugar, 1 cup water) because we loved it and there wasn't enough to go around! Also, we baked it for 35 minutes to get the outside good and golden brown. Turned out great!

soooo easy, and sooo good.  The girls at work LOOOVE it when I bring this in.  I work weekends, sixteen hours then a small break and sixteen more, at a Radiology department.  I can have this thing in the oven in fifteen minutes, ready to go for our potluck Saturdays by the time I'm curlin' my hair.  Adding cream cheese to the fajitas before putting in the apples is a great idea, and I've even used the "brown sugar and cinnamon whipped" cream cheese tub.  Two tubs is heavenly.  The homemade caramel sauce in this recipe is soooo goood.  Thanks so much for this keeper.

My family asks for this recipe every year now! I make the apple filling from scratch and I also spread a layer of sweetened cream cheese (2 Tbs. of sugar and 1 tsp of vanilla) on each tortilla first.  Then I add a 1/2 tsp. of rum extract into the sauce. Absolutely delicious! I live in Arizona and one year I used homemade tortillas that I got in a recent trip to Mexico and it was the best!

Good, but exceedingly sweet and I like sweets as much as anyone. Also probably would've been better with an apple filling made from scratch, rather than the canned apples.

This was a nice easy recipe to make for a mexican themed party we had. My only mistake was buying the store brand apple pie filling. Next time I will splurge for the name brand.

Really yummy and so quick - it got RAVE reviews.  We topped it with some vanilla ice cream and it was just like apple pie!  Hint:  I baked it a bit longer until it the enchiladas were a golden brown - it gave it an extra crunch...!!!

Just came from a mexican themed dinner and I took this for dessert.  We all loved it...kind of tastes like apple dumplings, but less work.  I even used lite apple pie filling and sugar free ice cream. Will make it again for sure.

I made this for a Mexican Fiesta luncheon at work, and received rave reviews.  I did add a thin layer of cream cheese to the tortillas before rolling them up.  I have handed out about 15 copies of the recipe to my coworkers.  Thanks for the recipe.  I bet they would taste great with other fruit fillings too.

This was something I made to use up some tortillas.  We like this recipe but I think it was a little greasy for me and next time I'll cut the butter down to a 1/4 cup.

Didn't like these really.  The enchilada was too doughy...was hoping for something crispier.  Fresh apples would help instead of canned. The best part of it was the butter sauce.  Thanks for the recipe...glad I tried it, but won't make again.

My family liked this dessert.  I don't like canned apple pie filling so I made my own on the stove with fresh grated nutmeg added in.  The tops of the tortillas seemed a bit tough mid way thru baking, so I flipped them over in the sauce and they were tender all the way through.  I splashed a bit of cream over mine and it was fantastic.

These are delicious!  My husband says they are too sweet, and they are VERY sweet. If you are not much into sweets, this isn't the thing for you, but if you are anything like my family and me, you will LOVE these.  Terrible for a diet, but God they are great!  I follow the recipe precisely, and it is super easy to make.  I have made these several times and plan on doing so again. Soon.

I only made 2 changes - 1) used cinnamon sugar instead of cinnamon because that's what I had on hand. Didn't really make it taste much different. 2) Added a tbs vanilla to the sauce because I love vanilla.   My husband loved this recipe. Mine didn't get as golden brown as they probably should have despite cooking for 30 minutes and were "gooey" but that's how the husband likes it. So, it was all good.  Very good way to use extra taco shells!

These are sooo good! If you want a easy desert full of flavor, try this recipe.  You won't regrete it.  I can't wait to try different pie fillings.   I actually made another batch but they were sugarfree enchiladas with apple sauce filling, instead of pie filling, for my diabetic husband.  The sauce I made with splenda.  He thought I should make these again, and again.  Thanks Brenda for the great reci[pe!  "Simply" wonderful!

I really needed something fast and easy to use up my can of apple pie filling. This was perfect. Tastes pretty good too. Not the ultimate dessert, but the sauce tastes awesome. thanks for the recipe!

I have made this recipe over and over for at least 2 years.  I did change it a bit by adding cream cheese to the tortilla's prior to placing apple pie filling. After baking the enchiladas in the sauce; I place the enchiladas on a plate, and for the grown-ups, add a bit of rum to the left over sauce prior to drizzling it over the cooked enchiladas.  It's even a bigger hit.

These were alright. I was expecting something a little more though.  Probably won't make again unless i have extra tortillas, but thats a long shot.

This is a nice ending for a mexican themed meal! I prepared this before we sat down to eat, popped it in the oven, when dinner was finished, dessert was warm and waiting! Went well with a little ice cream.

This was awesome although I would line the pan with parchment paper because they do stick.  I made apple (using my own homemade filling) and cherry ones. I baked them longer for about 40 minutes like another suggested and they were crispy and yummy.  I can't wait to make them again and again!!!

This was a very creative recipe, but it turned out to be very soupy and almost too sweet. Next time I will try and bake it longer and maybe cut down on the sugar.

Very good! Tastes like you slaved in a kitchen all day! Easy and inexpensive to make. Took to work and got rave reviews, which made me feel great especially since I usually make everything homemade. No one knew I made if from scratch. Made the night before, cooked half-way. Let it sit on counter covered overnight, then finished cooking in the morning before work. A prize recipe!

Excellent.  Be sure to use thin flour tortillas, I made the mistake once of using what I had on hand,a thicker tortilla, chalupa-style, and it was too thick and the tortilla led the dish instead of the apple taking center stage.

This is dangerously easy! Great with vanilla ice cream. I think I'll try some lightly sweetened cream cheese inside with the apples next time.

yummy!!! This was a very simple dish to make and was very tasty.  The only thing I will do different next time, is to not add as much water the sauce was thin. I served it with vanilla ice cream.

WOW! I made this as dessert for a Mexican themed meal we did for some guests, and was this ever well received! My husband actually emailed me the next day to say that he couldn't stop thinking about this dessert! After cooking, I turned on the broiler until they were brown, and served with ice cream. YUMMY!

I was asked to bring a dish to the neighborhood Cinco De Mayo party.  I made this and it so easy using peaches instead.  While the other desserts may have been prettier in presentation, this was delicious.  I made quite a bit and gave some leftovers to our babysitter.  She and her family ate them cold for breakfast the next day and just raved about the taste.  I'll make this again.

Heavenly dessert! New twist to all you apple pie fans!! I would reduce the water next time to maybe 1/3 cup to make it more syrupy and I might take the cream cheese addition into consideration for the future. When hot, serve ala mode style with vanilla ice cream. HMMMMMMMM good! Will make these again!! Thanks Brenda!

This was FANTASTIC!!! 
i let it bake in the oven for a bit longer though so that the tortillas got crispy on the top.  they are even great reheated, my husband tried telling me that we have to eat all of them because they arent going to be good reheated. LOL  he just wanted to eat more :)

I'm a novice baker and found this recipe easy to follow with excellent results.  I had to make it within the prescribed hour and whisk it out the door for book club. It was a crowd pleaser and I will certainly make it again.  To avoid the tough ends I brushed the sauce during the baking process several times. I added vanilla extract and nutmeg for extra flavor.

This is absolutely fabulous - so easy!  Took to a brunch yesterday and everyone thought that I had peeled and diced the apples myself - This one thing I did different - after I scraped the apple filling from the can, I took a sharp knife and sliced thru the apple slices until they were small chunks and then did the rest of the recipe as was written.  However, I was able to do 8 Enchiladas instead of one - Thanks for making me a hit at our brunch.

I loved it and so did my family! It's quick & easy. I used a little less water & more brown sugar for a thicker sauce. I saved some sauce to drizzle over the vanilla ice cream I topped it with--yum!

Nice recipe- but here's what I did...I stuffed and rolled the tortillas as directed, and made the sauce as directed. Then I spooned a small amount onto each roll, just enough to wet the tops. While baking for ten minutes to get a crispy caramelized roll I added a small amount of condensed milk to the remaining sauce and simmered while the rolls were baking. After baking for ten minutes I covered with the remaining sauce. I let this set long enough to cool to a creamy consistency and topped with crushed walnuts.

These not for those without a sweet tooth, but they're oh so tasty! I made about 50% more sauce than the recipe called for because I was afraid there wouldn't be enough. But next time I'll make the standard amount and will spoon it on top of the enchiladas every few minutes to help it soak in before going in the oven. I'd recommend using more apple pie filling - they seemed a little too flat once they cooked and could use a little more apple taste. But overall a fun recipe! Looking forward to making them for my husband's "fiesta" themed birthday!

I made this for a potluck at work. Turned out great! Everyone LOVED them. I doubled the recipe but didn't need to double the sauce. By the time I went for dessert I almost didn't get one. I made them the next night (and put vanilla ice cream on top) for a family dinner and they were a big hit. I will definitely make them again.

I grew up baking everything from scratch with my grandmother. I take such pride in my baking skills...  I have to say that I was totally blown away by this ultra simple yet SCRUMPTIOUS recipe.  It is wonderful hot with a scoop of vanilla ice cream but almost better from the fridge the next day!  A+++++ in my book!

OHHHH this is my favorite dessert recipe I've tried from this site!!!  I used it instead of the other because it calls for real butter not margarine and I also didn't use canned pie filling I made apple pie filling (also from this site) which is awesome!!  I did bake it for 30 min not 20 and used a little cinnamon cream cheese in a couple of them which was also tasty.  Definetly a great tasting dessert!!

Delicious, easy and cheap to make.  I used thinly sliced granny apples instead of the pie filling and did not need to precook them.  Don't forget the vanilla bean ice cream!

This was unbelievable! I made this with my fruit salsa recipe which includes apples, kiwi, bananas and strawberries and it was one of the best deserts I have ever made or eaten! Just delicious!  I made the sauce with 1/2 c. butter, 1/4 c. white sugar, 1/2 c. brown sugar and 1/4 c. water and it came out perfect! I'd love to try this with different fillings as well. 
Thank you so much for a new family favorite!

Oh my gosh - these were amazing!!!  I did use a little less sugar as others suggested and thought they were great.  The only tortillas I had in the house were whole wheat and I think they would have been better with the regular flour, but they were still amazing!

One of my favorite desserts!  We top it with cool whip or ice cream. I have also made this with cherry pie filling and LOVE it, maybe even more than the apple, but both are good.  Thanks for this unique and tasty idea!

SOOO yummy! It tastes like it is so much more complicated to make than it actually is. Everyone was very impressed and loved it! I chose this recipe over the other one on this website because it uses real butter (not margerine) which makes it soooo good and ymmmmy!

I have tried a LOT of recipes on this site and this one is just o.k. It was really good but there are so many other things to make besides this. My husband didnt really like them either. They were better as they sat longer, let me say. So let them sit, they are good to try something different, and DO serve with vanilla ice cream, i like things VERY sweet though. Seems like the tortillas almost need to be fried or something.

This recipe is very easy to make for any skill level in the kitchen.  Its fun and delicous!  And I did not serve it with icecream or whip cream but it would be very good with both!  I plan to serve this at my daughters 13th Birthday we are having a mexican fiesta!  (Very appropriate!)

Excellent!  They turned out great, everyone loved them.  I made 1/2 extra of the sauce which I definitely needed.  I also used 1/2 the amount of water and next time will use no water for a thicker sauce.

I made this for a church dinner and everyone was asking for seconds.  I made it with homemade pie filling and added cream cheese to it, and it turned out wonderful.  Everyone wanted the recipe. Also, after baking it, I broiled it until it was a golden crisp.  It was wonderful and I will absolutely make it again.

This was a very simple and quick dessert, we really enjoyed it with vanilla ice cream! My 13 year old daughter made it. I will make it again for sure, it was just like eating apple pie! Be sure to drizzle some of the sauce on the ice cream. A dollop of whipped cream would be good too!

I have used this recipe over and over in different quantities from 4 - 75 and it's been a hit every time.  I am on a cooking team at church and it is requested and raved over every time!  I have to plan for at least 1 1/2 - 3 for each person.  I sprinkle powdered sugar on top and serve it with ice cream and the sauce that's left over.  I warm the sauce so that it just barely melts the ice cream.  GREAT!!!!!

I made this for a New Year's Eve party and everyone thought this dessert was delicious.  I topped the tortillas with chopped pecans before pouring the syrup on them.  I baked it for 35 minutes until it was crispy.

A total winner!  I added a little cream cheese and sprinkled a little cinnamon and sugar in the filling.  Very simple and everyone loved it.  Only problem was no leftovers.

I made this two nights in a row, one for the Park Board appreciation night and then for our church group.  They were absolutly a hit!  Everyone loved them, the only thing I can say is to let them soak in the sauce at least an hour after they have cooked, before you serve them.  Either with or without ice cream, they are wonderful.  They are even better with the tortilla soaked in the sauce.  I have to print up several of the receipes for everyone.  Thanks so much for sharing.

Oh sooo goood....My husband ate two of these for dessert and I could not resist having one as well, even though I'm on a diet with a scoop of vanilla ice cream (sent the rest over to my sister in laws house..loved them). It made six like the recipe noted and I added 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract and 1/4 tsp. cinnamon to the sauce as well. Also made it ahead of time and added 15 more minutes cooking time to make more crisp on the outside as the first reviewer noted. Thank you Brenda for such an easy and scrumptious recipe! Definitely a keeper!!

An easy tasty dessert.  I think next time I would double the sauce and pour some over the dessert once it is out of the oven.

We love these. They are like having apple dumplings with all the work. So easy to make. My husband is a route driver and he told the ladies on his route about them. They asked him to bring them the recipe because he praised them so highly.

Needed a dessert recipe to make for 125, and this was perfect! It didn't really take long and it was delicious! Everyone loved it, especially served with vanillas ice cream.  Would like to try other varieties next time.

I made this as written & it's wonderful! Top w/vanilla or cinnamon ice cream-yum!! Whether using canned or fresh apples, I would cube them next time-it's easier to roll up in the tortilla when the pieces are smaller.

Excellent dessert and a HUGE hit at our house warming party. Everyone wanted seconds and thirds and the recipe! Instead of ready-made apple pie filling, I used a recipe from another cookbook to make my own apple pie filling (apples, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, butter) and microwaved this mixture for a couple mins to slightly soften. Definitely will make again--thanks!

We enjoyed the apple enchiladas almost as much as the banana and chocolate chip enchiladas.  I sliced 2 bananas and added chococlate chips before I rolled the enchiladas.  Serve with ice cream for an extra special treat!

This was gross. I was embarrassed that I made it in the first place. The tortillas turned doughy and the apple pie filling was mushy!! I know it got rave reviews, I just didn't care for it - if the flavor was wonderful I might be a little more forgiving - but it wasn't - AND it was ugly! :-(

Today my kindergartener's class was celebrating Johnny Appleseed's birthday, and I was supposed to send something "apple" in to the class.  The ONLY apple anything I had was a can of apple pie filling.  I needed something quick, easy, and kid-friendly to make with ingredients I had on hand.  Voila!  In comes apple enchiladas.  The class was happy, my son was happy with me, and I am happy with allrecipes.com, who saved me again!  Thanks for a yummy, easy, apply, kid-friendly dessert.  I didn't have any whipped cream or ice cream on hand, but these were great just the same.

I've made this a few times. Be careful not to cook the syrup too long, it gets very gooey. It is also good with cherry pie filling.

I did the quick cook method of the apples in the microwave as suggested. These were good. Not as good as the Mt.Dew ,crescents, but I often have left over tortillas, and usually apples on hand so I now have a new way to use them up!

Very good and so simple..  Would be great for a dinner party as it is easy and most can be prepared ahead of time.  One star off as it was a bit too sweet..I'd reduce the sugar a tad next time.

Awesome!  I sprinkled cinnamon both on the inside and outside and actually chilled it after baking as a personal family preference.  Thanks for the recipe!

Really fun recipe. Pretty tasty. I topped it with a little aged cheddar which I would deffinetly reccomend. There's something about the sweet apples and tangy cheddar :)

Phenomenal recipe.  Will definately make again - perfect as a dessert AND late night snack. 

Definately need to bake a bit longer in order to crisp up and appear golden.  

Even without being crisp it was still an INCREDIBLE dessert!

I, too, took this to a Mexican-themed party, and it was a raging hit!  I was asked many times over for the recipe, and it has become an oft-requested dessert!  Make sure it is served with vanilla ice cream, or you'll be missing out.

This went over really well. i used my own apple filling, and topped with vanilla ice cream as suggested by other reviews. i also used Splenda rather then sugar. Will make again when in a hurry.

This was pretty good, overall. I served this to friends and my husband with vanilla ice cream and homemade caramel sauce after a Mexican themed dinner, and everyone seemed to enjoy it. My husband said he'd eat it again. I agree with some of the others that the sauce was too runny. Next time I'll cut back on the water, or leave it out altogether. I was hoping for something more syrupy. I think I'll also not pour it on top of the enchiladas, just around them, so the tortillas will get a little crispy on top.

These were allright. I think I accidentally got the bigger tortillas than the smaller ones, but it turned out okay. Just a lot of leftovers. I'll be making this recipe for a big group, not just for 2 or 4 people.

Hubby liked it, but it was way to sweet for my tastes. I used homemade apple pie filling, and 4 large tortillas instead of 6 regular ones. The topping was definitely too sweet. I probably won't make this again.

I am only giving this 3 stars because it was way too sweet for me...However, my husband (who loves anything super sweet) gave this a  big thumbs-up! It WAS very easy to prepare.  I made my own apple filling, and thereby used up some apples that were getting a little old.  Thanks, Brenda, for posting this.

I usually do not like to use canned pie filling but it works VERY well in this recipe.  This is an EXCELLENT dessert and very easy.  I made this for a Mexican theme birthday party and everyone loved it.  Highly recommended!

Mine were made with cherry filling. I halved the sauce ingredients, added the cinnamon into the pot & simmered it til it was thickened. I also used the smaller, 6 inch tortillas. Overall this recipe was very tasty. Presentation rates about a 2 though. But that is probably due to my lack of skill in rolling the tortillas. Alot of the filling seeped out, but that was okay, I just spooned some of it over the plated tortillas. Half of the tortillas got smeared with cream cheese. They were equally good with & without the added cream cheese. Mine did not come out tough at all. It's a keeper.

Maybe I did something wrong ... to me it was too 'greasy' .    It tasted very good but the greasiness was a bit much for me.  I'd have given it 5 stars if it weren't for that.

This recipe was delicious AND easy! What more could you want? A future change I will make is the tortillas....mine were tough even though I cooked them until they were crispy on
the outside. I wonder if phyllo dough would work?
I'll probably double the sauce next time because the sauce is what makes the dessert so yummy. Thanks for sharing this recipe Brenda!

Overall wonderful dessert....had to bake 30 mins to get a little more crispy and also had to use a knife to cut them up.  I also put shredded sharp chedder cheese inside to give it a little something more.  Everybody can't wait until I make them again.

SUPER fast and easy too!  I served it to guests, and almost everyone had seconds.  My very picky 2 year old even ate more than one bite.  My only suggestion is be sure to use the thinner tortillas.

Very delicious and very EASY.  My 13 year old son says I should make these "over and over", and he NEVER says that.  I will add a few raisins to the inside and sprinkle chopped pecans on top the next time, as other viewers have suggested.

My New Year's Eve Party mexican theme was complimented by this quick and delicious dessert. Definitely one to use again.  Could be modified with more ingredients like chopped nuts.

Very fast, easy, and wonderful! I forgot to sprinkle the cinnamon inside with the filling, so I put it in the sauce.  This worked out great, because we spooned the sauce over the ice cream that was served with the apple enchiladas.  All my husband would say was "WOW!"

Absolutely delicious!  I may never make regular apple dumplings again.  These are so simple and taste like real apple dumplings without all the work!  The only thing I changes was to cook the syrup a little longer to make it thicker.

I used a no sugar added apple pie filling in one batch.  I forgot to add the cinnamon to the filling, so I added pumpkin pie spice to the sauce instead.
I did a second batch using mixed berry pie filling.  This kind has less fruit and more "filling" in the can, so I supplemented by adding a large handful of fresh blueberries before rolling up.  For the sauce, I omitted the cinnamon and added vanilla instead.
Definitely needed at least 40 minutes of cooking time (and even that didn't leave them crispy, but that might be my oven's fault).
I didn't get to try it myself, but I have heard that they were a big hit at the pot luck!!

I made this for a Christmas book club dinner and chose it because it was dairy free. It was delicious & a huge hit with everyone! Lots of changes were made. I sliced up an apple & cooked with 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/4 cup apple juice & 2 Tbsp. Brown sugar, until tender & mixed in the canned Apple filling. For the glaze, 1/2 cup Apple juice. 1/3 cup coconut oil, 1Tbsp. Cornstarch & 1 Tbsp. Brown sugar, & 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon until thicken. This makes enough to cover all the enchiladas, no tough enchiladas here. This is very easy & delicious!!

We had a pot-luck at work and I was to bring a Mexican dessert.  I wanted something different then flan and found this recipe.  It was a huge hit and everyone wanted the recipe.  Super easy and very tasty without being heavy.  This is a keeper!

Being a southern boy, I'm not going to tell you that this is BETTER than good ol' flaky crust apple pie, but it is good. As written, it's real good.  However, if you want "OMG!, I can't stop sneaking in for another bite", try this: smear 1/6 of a brick of plain, softened cream cheese on the tortilla before the apple.  Chop up the pie filling a little, and mix the cinnamon right in.  Use "No Sugar Added" apple pie filling.  An 8X12 dish spread it out better.  Reduce water to about 1/3 or 1/4c.  Bake for at least 40 minutes to get a crispy top.  Topping it off with anything less than Blue Bell Homemade Vanilla Ice cream while it's still scalding hot is simply a compromise.  To reiterate: as written if very good, but with these changes, you might want a smoke.

I tried this recipe tonight and it was very delicious paired with vanilla ice cream. I used everything the recipe called for but had to cut the 30 minute sitting time to 15 and then put it in the oven for the 20 minutes. It sat out on the stove for another 30 minutes till after dinner. Very delicious, I even drizzled some caramel sauce over the ice cream and the enchiladas. I'll definitely make this again.

We had leftover cherry pie filling, and I think I preferred it with the cherries.  The apple stuffed shells were super sweet.  I will give it 5 stars for easy, but I don't think I would make this again.  It was a good way to use up leftover (almost stale) taco shells.

My sister made these and I was very surprised that such a simple recipe using flour tortillas and canned pie filling could be so delicious! The tortillas were not at all tough as some other reviewers experienced.  I've never been fond of canned pie filling but I plan on making these frequently!

I just made these for dessert and we loved them!  I did use peaches (I was out of apples) but the rest I kept the same.  It was like peach cobbler!  Will do again with other fruits.

The flavor was really good. My husband didn't like how they weren't crunchy and were hard to cut.

Definitely has potential, but a tad too sweet for me. I made my own pie filling using 4 cups sliced Granny Smith apples, 1/2 cup sugar, 2 Tbs flour, cinnamon, and nutmeg (similar to reviewer Donna), but followed the amounts called for in the recipe, otherwise. Next time, I will reduce the amount of sauce I use - cut it down to 1/3 cup white sugar, slightly over 1/3 cup brown sugar, 1/3 cup butter, and 1/3 cup water - and see if that helps. If you have a strong sweet tooth, however, this is a great recipe for you.

I was very pleasantly surprised at how good this came out! I did make a few changes though. Since I have about 50lbs of apples sitting on my table, I used fresh apples and mixed them with cinnamon and a bit of Mace (Allspice would also work). I then added about 1/2 cup of diced cold Brie to the apple mixture and 1 cup of dried cranberries soaked in water. Since I used rice tortillas, they were not as flexible as wheat so I made mine more like a lazagna-style instead of wrapping. Also, for the sauce, I didnt have enough brown sugar so I used a small amount of molasses. If you do this, it makes it REALLY rich so go light and save the extra to add when you serve it. I also added a mixture of cheddar and dublinger cheese on the top layer with the sauce. Bake covered as normal, and enjoy! 
I have extra sauce that I am going to try mixing with a Mexican mole sauce to see if I can make this more of a meal instead of a dessert. Either way, It came out REALLY good!

Made them as the recipe stated except didn't wait the 1/2 hour before baking.  It was about 15 minutes.  Still tasted great!

I needed something to bring to a mexican food themed party and had a big bag of cinnamon apples a friend made that I wanted to use, so when I came across this recipe, I thought "PERFECT!" It was simple and absolutely delicious! Just like apple dumplings without all the work, mess and time. Could have used a little less butter & would have been just as good. MMM MMM MMM! Everyone loved them!

I thought this dish was just ok. I found it very sweet. If I were to make it again, I would not dish the sauce over the enchilada when serving.

This recipe makes me a hero every time I make it.  I found it on here about three years ago, and can't live without it.  For a quick, amazing dessert, it's unbeatable.  I've found that I can stretch the pie filling to make 16 enchiladas, and then I double the syrup so that there's plenty to soak the tortillas really well.  Serve them with vanilla ice cream and then drizzle the extra syrup over top...yum.

Wow, what a fast any easy dessert that turned out great. If your in a pinch and have ingredients on hand this is well worth it. I didn't have vanilla ice cream in the freezer but I will tomorrow and I can't wait.

I really thought that from all of the rave reviews that this would be sensational. I was hoping for more of a crunch than a chewy sensation. Also, I couldn't get them to turn the golden brown as in the photo. Next time I get a sweet tooth for some apples and pastry, I'll stick with pies or maybe try a dumpling recipe, instead.

Quick and easy dessert.  Good use for those leftover tortilla wraps you might have.  I would like to try this with fresh apples instead of the canned pie filling though.

Yummy, yummy, yummy!  They look quite elegant and taste like you spent a lot of time, although they're VERY quick and easy.  I'll be making these again and again.  I forgot to add the cinnamon to the actual tortilla, so I just put it in the syrup and it was great.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

These are super easy and they turned out good, but I would also sprinkle cinnamon on top after adding the sauce.  I also had to cook them for about 30-35 minutes, instead of the instructed 20.

I used fresh Golden Delicous and Rome apples in the enchilattas (about 1/2 chopped apple each) and put the cinnamon in the syrup.  Excellent with whipped cream.

I found that this recipe was real, real rich. I could not eat it. I added cornstarch to thicken it, but I believe I may try it one more time with a lot less sugars. It is  very, very easy to make.

So easy and so delicious!  All my guests asked for seconds. I highly recommend having some vanilla ice cream on hand though - it's pretty sweet and the coldness helps cut it.

I like the concept, however I felt like this was not easy to eat.  I was hoping for this to be crunchier.  I will alter the directions a little and not put the syrup on top.  Maybe a little butter with cinnamon and sugar sprinkled on top.

5 stars for the concept! but who wants to wait an hour? (And use your own fresh cooked apple filling, canned filling really takes away from this great recipe.) I used the smallest flour tortillas, spread one side lightly with butter, the other side lightly with cream cheese and some apple filling on half. Fold in half and toothpick top edge. Fry on low heat until tortilla is crisp and light golden brown on both sides. Just before serving toss in a tablespoon of Mrs. Richardson's Butterscotch Caramel for each tortilla and let it melt and coat each tortilla. Now you can serve your apple "quesadillas"  with vanilla ice cream!

I really like this recipe...but I do think it is better the first night when it is crispy and first comes out of the oven..especially served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream..I will make it again when I have enough people to eat it all at once.. I followed the advice of some reviewers and used some cream cheese in the tortillas and it was very very good.. Kiki (Brampton,Ontario,Canada)

This was good.  Everyone seemed to enjoy it.  It seemed to be missing something; I think that maybe I will cook it until it's crispy next time.  Overall, very good dessert; I will be making some changes, but it's delicious.

I tested this recipe because I am hosting a Cinco de Mayo bunco party and needed a dessert.  My husband and I loved it and so did the kids.  The best way to serve it is warm with vanilla ice cream.  Yummy!!!!

One of the most beautiful, simple apple desserts I've ever tasted.  I served it up to 12 people and received 100% fantastic ravings about how good it was!!!

This is a great dish. My husband has told everyone he knows about this dessert. He had me make copies of the recipe and gave them to all his golfing buddies and to our two daughters.
Try it; you'll like it.

This recipe is so easy and good.  It gets a wonderful chewy texture by baking it a little longer.  Thanks for sharing!!

this recipe is just ok, the tortillas were tough, so you needed to use a knife as well as a fork to serve.  Will not be making again.

These were absolutely delicious!! I had enough filling to do nine tortillas, maybe mine were smaller than 8 in., but they were simply wonderful even with no ice cream, just hot out of the oven. They reminded me of apple dumplings. I will use this recipe a lot, they are so fast and simple to do. Many thanks to Brenda!!

Make sure you keep it in the oven long enough so the tortillas get nice and crisp!  Delicious!!
