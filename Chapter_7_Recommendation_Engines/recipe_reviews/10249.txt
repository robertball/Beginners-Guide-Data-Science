These were the first cookies that I've made that turned out tasting like cookies.  I will say that next time I am going to chill it for a half an hour to make it less drippy batter.

As we eagerly ran to the oven to see what Valentine treat awaited us, we soon were overcome with great disappointment.  Behold, the cookies were flat, greasy pancakes.  Not even good pancakes.  We followed the recipe to a tee.  What happened?  We don't understand how these could have a good rating.  They taste, look and sound terrible!!!

Sprinkle cinnamon on them before you stick them in the oven to give them a bit of extra flavor.  I've shown this recipe to several friends and coworkers and they have ALL loved it!

I made up the Basic Cookie Mix ahead of time, and this was the easiest way I have found to make ANY cookie. Thank you!

Okay, so I'm not an amazing cook, but I followed this recipe exactly. I even let the mixture sit in the fridge for 20 minutes to harden. but when I put the cookies in the oven, they spread over the entire area of the pan and burned before they cooked properly. Okay, so maybe my pan wasn't the best. So, I tried it another two times. The same results. The only time it worked remotely was when I cooked it in a small cake dish and just cut them. Even with that, the taste was mediocre at best. Maybe I did something wrong, but from my experience, I would not recommend this recipe.

Well, I was really hoping that these would have turned out but when i was making them after I followed the recipe exactally, it ended up looking like cake batter, not cookie dough. So, I added an extra 2 cups of the mix and it finally turned out looking close to a cookie dough so I baked them. The end result not good. They looked great but really did not taste right. It tasted like a plain cookie, not a sugar cookie. Maybe it is just me but this recipe didn't work for me.

These cookies are very basic so since I wasn't going to frost them, I made a couple of changes to the recipe.  After placing them on the baking sheet, I flattened them with a glass and then sprinkled with sugar.  The added sugar gave them just enough sweetness and flattening them made mine look more like cookies (they didn't spread very much on their own).

I have made cookies in many shapes, recipes,etc over the past several years as I love to bake.  With four kids I rarely have time for long prep cookies.  I found the mixing was quite simple, one thing I did was after it was mixed I placed it in my sifter and sifted it a few times, this mixed quite well better than by hand.  I also chose to use stick margrine melted for about 30 secs in the microwave.  My batter mixes nicely. It looks and tastes like cookie dough.  I never follow directions on cooking times as every oven is different. I just wait till centers look done and outside is golden. These are a win win for my family as my husband can't stand crunchy cookies(unless it is oreo) and I love crunchy cookies.  The outside has a slight crunch while the inside is soft.  Yes the do flatten and spread honestly with all the recipes I have used very few where actually thick cookies.  The neat thing about the mix is I can use it for many types of cookies and spend minimal time in the kitchen.  I would reccomend this to anyone who needs a simple way to make cookies without spending to much time in the kitchen.  2 cup mix yeilds approximately 2 dozen cookies when dropped with a teaspoon.
