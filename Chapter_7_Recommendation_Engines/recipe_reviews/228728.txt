Followed the recipe exactly and it was pretty good. Not great, but good. Will probably make it again, but will definitely add more balsamic vinegar and maybe try a different cheese other than parmesan. Or it might even be good with another cheese added to the parmesan.

Loved it! It tastes creamy without having to add loads of cream or anything too fattening. This will be made again :)

I normally make a meat sauce but when I saw this quick and easy recipe I figured I would give it a shot and I'm so glad I did.  I was surprised at the amount of flavor the sauce had and how nice and thick it turned out.   It's a great way to use up some of those ingredients I always seem to have on hand!

This recipe is really yummy and all of the ingredients are things I regularly have on hand.  I served it over spinach linguine and it was divine.  I did use red pepper flakes instead of hot sauce and added a package of precooked sausage.  Next time I think I'll use 1 T olive oil instead of the butter and cut the entire recipe in half since it's just my husband and I.
