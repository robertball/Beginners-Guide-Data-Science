This is pretty tasty stuff, but I admit, I had to change it. I don't like to review when I make a change, but this one's special... Tanya, please, if you get the chance, include the crock pot volume in the recipe. I am an amateur at slow-cookers, but I do have one... I think it holds maybe 3-4 quarts. Weeell that was NOT big enough, so the change I made was obvious: I had to dump it all into a big pot and cook it on the stove. I did the usual, bring it to a boil, put on a lid and turn down the heat to low. It took about 2-3 hours roughly because I wasn't in any hurry and I wanted the flavors to blend well. I still just used one ham hock though I added 2 teaspoons of bouillon. Oh, and I used one bag of fresh cut collards to save effort. Nothing real drastic... except that I used brown rice. Since I was taking my time cooking it, the extra cook time for brown was insignificant and might help with that mushy rice problem (seriously? She threw away the whole thing because of the mushy rice?). But it's essentially the same dish, cooked on the stove because I am bad at volume. It beats a review by some culinary troll who never made a recipe but slaps 3 stars on it to tell the internet (at the expense of others) the shocking revelation that it's faster to open cans. Why were you even looking at slow cooker recipes? Next time, put your own recipe up legit and quit being a parasite.

Vegetarian version: Used a couple drops of Liquid Smoke to replace the meat flavor. Used kale because that's what I had. Delicious!

This recipe was very good. My husband who is not a fan of beans of any kind really liked it. Very flavorful. My changes were soaking the black eyed peas for 24 hours before. Threw it all in a a 3-4 qt crockpot the greens cook down, plenty of room, you just stuff it all in there) I would have used 2 ham hock instead of one for more meat. I put in some diced ham leftover from Christmas. I forgot to add the rice so I didn't have the mushy issue. I would just make it on the side to be safe. 1 tablespoon of red pepper flakes is way too much. I only did a half teaspoon and that's plenty. I used chicken broth which gives more flavor than vegetable. It was easy fix it and forget it. Tasted even better the next day. Will make again. I used a sweet cornbread recipe as it contrasted nicely with the spiciness of the dish.

This is a good basic Hoppin'John Recipe, and isn't hard to make, and if it is anything like others I have tried, will be even better tomorrow than today!  Serve with good Southern cornbread (no sugar in it please) to sop up the juices! Thanks Tanya E!

Yes, I made this for New Years 2013 and it's the very best Black Eyed Peas recipe that I've ever tried.  I didn't even know what collard greens were!  This is such a satisfying dish; gives life to the previous recipes that I've tried.  My husband loves it and agrees:  this is the best recipe ever for black eyed peas.

I added 1 C chopped leftover ham...  The rice turned to mush and the beans weren't quite done.  I would definitely add the rice about halfway thru or cook separately and add at the end.  I added bay leaf, 1/2 large onion chopped, garlic powder and red pepper flakes but it needed a bit more seasoning at the end for me...

Haven't got the time. Opened a little can of chunk ham, a can of black-eyed peas, a can of collard greens and a cup of instant rice. dumped it all in a bowl. Added a tablespoon of butter, a little dried onion, garlic, salt and pepper. Zapped it in the microwave 5 minutes. Slopped it into my little crockpot and ran out the door to the potluck. Time we ate, it was just right. I didn't reveal my secret!

There is nothing actually wrong with it I just think maybe I am not a fan of collard greens. I couldn’t stuff all of the greens into my slow cooker so I didn’t add the second ham hock as others suggested. I agree that more meat could have helped. I added quinoa instead of rice (just a preference) but not my thing. Collards taste of dirt to me, preparation likely isn’t going to change it.

My wife and I loved it.  Perhaps a little zip to it and that is why the kids did not rave as much as we did.  I think I saw that someone else had added some left over ham and I did the same.  I don't see that changing the recipe or outcome much.  We will definitely make this again!

Boy howdy, was this spicy! And I say that after swapping cayenne for red pepper flakes and reducing to just under a teaspoon. I made the rice separately because it would have overflowed my crockpot. Used pork chops instead of ham hock because that's what I had. Everything else was by the recipe, but it did seem to take  longer to cook. Oh, and frozen greens instead of fresh.

Great recipe, super easy.  I think smoked turkey would work well, in lieu of the ham hocks, for those who don't eat pork.

I'd rate my first attempt at this as a 4 1/2 stars. I made two changes. 1. I used Kale as opposed to Collard Greens and 2. I used Kielbasa AND ham hocks.  Broke my golden rule-Cooked something first time for other people.  20 adults on a Scout camp out. Two suggestions 1. Use spicy Kielbasa and make sure it stews for at LEAST one hour preferably 2 for the ham hocks. Might want to tweak the spices too. It lack some depth of flavor which I think the spicy kielbasa and additional  stewing would help greatly.
