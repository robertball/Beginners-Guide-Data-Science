I really liked this sandwich. I used it for a Luau Party and they were gone by the end of the night. I used the already made pineapple cream cheese to save time and I also put some honey on top of the bananas.

A perfect little sandwich for a tea party. I served mine open faced. The bananas would need to be spritzed with pineapple juice to keep them from turning dark especially if made very far in advance.

I skipped the banana and added ham for more of a substantial meal.

These are excellent. I used regular cream cheese and added a cup of chopped almonds. Very tasty I must say!! I made the filling the night before and refrigerated the cheese mixture therefore it was difficult to spread the next morning. Next time I'll spread the filling on the bread then refrigerate. Also I used the Orowheat SandwichThins rolls instead of regular bread. I will make these again.

Perfect snack for someone like me who loves to eat healthy and has a sweet tooth! I added half a tsp of pineapple juice and used marscapone cheese.
