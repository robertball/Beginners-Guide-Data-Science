I used vanilla vodka & to make it taste more authentic, I added 1/2 an ounce of milk. Shook it all w/ ice & strained it into a martini glass. Loved it!

my hubby and I doubled everything, added a hefty scoop of vanilla ice cream, and whirled it around in the blender for a minute. I wanted to crawl into my glass and stay there forever.

This tastes like a Dream-sicle.  You know, vanilla ice cream covered in orange sherbert.  I served before a southern spicy dinner. Very refreshing.  This may become a regular cocktail served before dinner. My guests loved it and it is extremely easy and so tasty.  I served over ice.  Try it, you'll be glad you did.  Thanks Jen.

I made one of these this afternoon using vanilla vodka in place of the vanilla schnapps and I added just a touch of vanilla flavoring.

It's good, but not overwhelmingly so.
