I found this recipe for my Mother's Birthday. She loves raspberries. When I make this, the family and friends are fighting over a seat at the table to have a slice. I reccomend it to anyone. It's delicious.

Very easy and good cheesecake! Looks pretty too. Made this for a crowd of 10 and many went back for more. 

I did make a few changes: I made an oreo crust in a 9-inch springform, then put all of the cheesecake mixture into the pan (so only one cake, not two). I also added about 1 Tbsp sugar and about 2 tsp vanilla to the cream cheese mixture. Baked for about 40 min. I used the "water bath" method found on this site; it was easy and worked like a charm! No cracks at all!  I'll make this again for sure.
