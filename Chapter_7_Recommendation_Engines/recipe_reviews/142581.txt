family liked this, I used left over cooked pork and mixed it in a pan and heated. Easy/fast recipe, next time I will use 1/4 cup marmalade as we found it a little sweet. Gave everyone a wedge of lemon to squirt on their meat and they were happy. Great with potato pancakes.

If you are looking for a sweet tasting bbq sauce, this is it.  10 stars for easiness.  I substituted the horseradish for grated ginger and grilled my pork tenderloin whole.
