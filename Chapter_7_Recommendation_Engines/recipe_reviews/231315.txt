I made this for lunch today & evidently didn't notice it called for the Zatarain's® Jambalaya Rice Mix when I made out my grocery list, so I had to improvise & make my own. I used 2 cups Minute rice & 2 cups of water & about 1 tsp. Cajun Seasoning instead. It was perfect. I used 13 med size shrimp instead of 1/2 cup. I also used the diced tomatoes with green chili's, so didn't need to add extra Creole Seasoning.
It also never said to add the 2 mixtures together at the end, but I did. I would make this over again. Thanks Johnsonville®.

I had high hopes for this recipe because it looked and smelled wonderful.  Unfortunately, my family thought it was just ok.   The recipe called for shrimp, but, in the recipe directions it said shrimp or chicken,so, I used chicken since I already had it in my freezer.  I think our issue was the flavor of the rice with the diced tomatoes.  It had too strong of a tomato flavor for us.  I think if I had used the spicy tomatoes with chilies like another reviewer we might have liked it better.  That being said - we thought the Johnsonville sausage had a really good flavor and I will definitely buy that again to use in a different recipe.

I'm not a rice girl, but my family is; I AM a Creole-Cajun-Anything-Blackened girl.  I enjoyed this meal right along with them!  Our grocery didn't carry the Johnsonville Andouille so we subbed in Italian and it worked just fine!  We're a family of 7; we doubled the recipe and will have plenty of leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

Wow! I really enjoyed this, and it was super easy. I used a 14-oz package of Johnsonville's New Orleans-style andouille sausage and a 10-oz can of chicken. I did add a sauteed onion and green pepper because I like them in my jambalaya. Great recipe!

Too much hot sauce!  My husband loves spicy foods, but even he said the heat on this detracted from the flavors.  And I'm not sure that the rice mix is necessary.  The seasonings add enough flavor that I'd rather use plain white rice next time and skip the additives from a boxed rice.  That would help with the sodium content too.  A few tweaks, and I think this would be pretty tasty.

I liked this as the recipe stands, but I loved it when I substituted rotel for the diced tomatoes.

whole family loved it!  I used the "mild" Zatarains Jambalaya Rice mix.  Also used turkey sausage 1/2 sweet and 1/2 spicy and the last of the tomatoes from the garden, pureed (my kids hate pieces of tomato).  nice flavor with some spice, but not too much. 

as for the 1 star review that noted sodium....if you look at the nutrition info, it's ALL out of whack!  just an error somewhere.  it's not overly salty

I too used a can of Rotel and still found it to be a bit bland. I then sauteed onions and green bell peppers, seasoned with Emirl's Essence and added it to the rice mixture. Much better.
I must say though that all the Johnsonville sausages I have tried are the best I have ever had.

Excellent Cajun dish.  Better than Jambalaya I had at a restaurant in New Orleans.

I thought this recipe was too hot to enjoy.  I like spicy food and didn't even use the hot sauce because I used the rotel tomatoes and it was still too much for me and my family.  I tried to cool it down the next day adding white rice and a can of soup and a can of water and though it was less spicy was not good enough to rave about.  I used a pound of shrimp and no sausage as I wanted a meatless meal. If I should try this again, I wouldn't use the Zatarans Jumbalaya rice but plain white rice.  I probably won't bother though unless someone can tell me what I did wrong.

oh man! This dish was amazing! I swear I wouldn't change a thing about it. My husband and son said it was a little spicy though. They were sweating. To me it was just right, but then again, I LOVE spicy foods! I might have added more shrimp though. That's the only thing I would've done differently!

To kick it up a notch, use a true Cajun andouille sausage such as Savoie's or Bernard's and add (to taste) minced jalapeno pepper.

Turned out well.  I crockpotted 3 chicken breasts seasoned with Tony Cachere’s creole seasoning and Aidel’s cajun style andouille sausage and 2 boxes of Zatarain’s jambalaya mix.  It made 15 one cup servings.  I added an extra cup of chicken broth from the slow cooker with the chicken to keep it moist.  Very good.

I'd say as written, this is about a 3-3.5.  It was a little too spicy for me, so I may cut back on the Cajun Seasoning and pepper sauce next time. 

I added a whole back (12oz) of frozen/thawed shrimp and a whole chicken breast (diced) instead of choosing one or the other.  That was definitely an improvement.  I didn't change any of the spice proportions, and it was still on the spicy side for me, so I will definitely cut back next time.

It's okay, easy if you're short on time or you have ingredients on hand. Kinda bland, nothing special.

Fantastic Johnsonville!  There is not a thing that I would change in this recipe going forward, but out of necessity I did have to sub out the Johnsonville Andouille sausage for Johnsonville Smoked Brats.   This is one of those meals that I need no sides for.   Just give me a couple heaping bowls of this and I'm set!

I made this last night for supper, of course I forgot to thaw my chicken out so I did not add any, just doubled the sausage.  I also added 1 chopped onion. It turned out fabulous!!!! My family loved it and we will definitely be making it again!!!

I made this last night and it was a success. It was very easy and flavorful. I mixed in a bell pepper and onion while I was cooking the sausage and I used canned chicken (gross, I know!) but nobody even noticed it was from can because the recipe had such a good flavor. I didn't have any shrimp so we did without. I added creole seasoning and used Ro-tel instead of diced tomatoes so some will say I can't rate it since I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I cooked the white rice in chicken broth since I didn't have Zataran's and used 2 cups of rice. After cooking rice I mixed all the ingredients together.  My husband asked that I add this to the regular meal rotation.

I used regular turkey sausage instead of andouille because I couldn't find any. I also used chicken. I left out the tomatoes became hubby doesn't like them. I also left out the hot sauce so it wouldn't be too spicy for a toddler. I also left out the parsley because I didn't have any.

I love making semi-homemade meals on busy weeknights, using the Jambalaya mix is a great way to start this recipe.  I always love any of the Johnsonville products so you can't go wrong there either.   I like to start off by sweating off a diced bell pepper and a diced onion.  I like the added flavor and texture of them in the rice.   I don't believe the added Creole seasoning is necessary either.  I do, however use sausage, shrimp AND chicken, but I choose boneless thighs which I cut up and cook right along with the rice mix, I toss the shrimp in when the rice is almost cooked, that way the chicken and shrimp flavors really penetrate the rice.   Good easy recipe!

Hi everyone , this is my very first review and my first meal that I made using this site. I made this dish and added few items such as okra and used 3 1/2 cups water , garlic powder and little extra Cajun seasoning . Meal was delicious

This recipe is a super quick meal with ingredients I keep on hand.  We added a little more seasoning for our taste and made it with chicken.

So easy, soooo good.  I'm not a good cook and this is the first thing I've made in a long time that I was like "YUUUUUUUM!"
