For nutrition, this recipe deserves 5 stars. Amount Per Serving: Calories: 210;Total Fat: 1.9g; Cholesterol: 58mg; Sodium: 27mg; Total Carbs: 44.2g; Dietary Fiber: 3.3g; Protein: 6.4g.  This "cake" was indeed crisp on the outside, but I would like a moister interior.  Maybe, using 1 1/2 cups water would help.
