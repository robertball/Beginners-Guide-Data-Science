For as simple as this recipe was, it was pretty tasty. Don't fear the mayo - you cannot taste it! The only change I made was to slightly pulse the onion soup mix in my food processor to get a more even texture.  No additional salt/pepper was needed upon serving.  The one issue I had was the mayo in the microwave. I heated it for 20 seconds and it curlded - not very appetizing, but I was able to brush it on the chicken regardless.  I would leave the step out next time. Just whisk the mayo and garlic paste together, and it'll be a good consistency to brush on the chicken, no heating needed.  Depending on the size of your chicken breasts, you may need to bake them a little longer, but I found 20 minutes to be perfect for the 6-8oz breasts I was using.

My husband absolutely loved this moist, tender chicken...so much he ate 2. I omitted the mayo (NOT A FAN) I substituted with 2 eggs mixed with 2 teaspoons of minced garlic. I will absolutely make this again.

Very good recipe.  I did not have garlic paste but wanted to substitute something else to boost flavor a bit more, so I mixed a little Dijon mustard with the mayo.  Delicious!

I haven’t made it yet, but I look forward to doing so because for many years I’ve used mayonnaise as a base layer for breading with mixtures of breadcrumbs, sesame seeds, minced dried onions, nuts, etc. Mayo works great with chicken, but also fish and veal.  Everything oven “fries”! and comes out super moist and flavorful.

If I were to make this again, I would cut the onion soup mix by half, and pulverize it in a blender or food processor, as another person suggested, before proceeding. My family commented that while the chicken was moist and flavorful, the onion soup mix was way too obvious. (I didn't tell them what the ingredients were.) Hubby complained he was, "choking on onion soup dust." Ooops.

I made a couple of changes- I had bone-in breasts so that’s what I used. Timing was longer then recipe says as a result. 
I mixed olive oil mayo with Thai chili garlic paste. 
It came out great. I think it would be better with boneless as it got a little dried out when I cooked it a little too long but it was still good! I used to make a similar recipe except with Russian dressing instead of the mayo. Also good!

I used boneless chicken thighs (I prefer them over breast meat) and they turned out great.  Nice and juicy.

I was out of onion soup mix so I substituted with half a cup crushed dried fried onions, 1 Tbsp onion powder and 1 tsp salt. I pressed 4 garlic cloves instead of the garlic paste.  I did not microwave the mayo as the consistency was already perfect to brush on. It came out tender and delicious. The only change I’d make next time is to spray the chicken with cooking spray before baking for a more fried look and crunchier texture.

Decent, but I won't make it again  -  unless Lipton comes out with an (optional) 'lower sodium' soup mix.  Waaay too salty, but granted.... you could use less, however, you'd sacrifice some of the flavor.  My family & I watch our sodium intake very carefully, since it's unhealthy, & I DONT want to get my kiddoes used to a lot of sodium (as a flavor enhancer) for life.  We grow & use a lot of fresh herbs, instead.  Not only are they healthier, but also tastier.

Very tasty and easy. I didn't have garlic paste so I used minced garlic instead, still yummy. I also baked mine with a cooling rack on top of the baking sheet to help keep the breading crisp. It worked mostly I think I used too much mayo or not enough breading because it wasn't as crisp as I would like it. Overall, really good. My husband doesn't like chicken very much and he was happy with this dinner.

AMAZING! I didn’t have any chicken on hand so I substituted it with boneless pork chops cooked at 400 for 20 minutes. I brined in salt water for 3 hours. They were super moist and delicious!

This turned out really good, moist on the inside and brown and crunchy on the outside. I used skin on/bone in chicken breasts and cooked it for 40 minutes instead. If I make this again, I will use a shallow bowl or pan for the both the wet and dry topping, so that the toppings go on all sides and not just the top. Instead of garlic paste I used minced garlic in oil, worked great.

Fabulous!  Great flavor - stayed moist- looked so appetizing.  Grandson does not like chicken breast because it is too dry. 
Not this time.  He loved it.  I sliced the breast in half to make the thinner and it didn't make a difference.

Was a first time make and taste. It was delish!  The recipe was very easy to make. I did cover mine during the bake time and still got the crispy coating. Bake time can vary depending on your oven and chicken size/thickness so mine baked for 40 minutes. Will definitely make again.

Substituted blue cheese dressing for the mayo(it’s mostly Mayo anyway). Also used optional garlic paste. May cut it down to 1/2 next time.  Turned out great. Do wish there was a way to cut down on the salt.

I made it with less chicken and cut the bread crumbs, but not the soup. I should have used less soup as it was much too salty. It was moist, and my husband liked it, and for that reason I will probably give it another try when I have more people to serve.
