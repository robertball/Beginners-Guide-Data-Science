This is a very good and easy recipe. I used fresh organic spinach and while mixing the ingredients felt that it could use more cheese, crackers and one additional egg than the recipe called for. It was a hit!!

This easy recipe is great for one or two people.  I added fresh mushrooms and used Cheddar, Mozzarella, & Parmessan/Asiago cheeses.

everyone in my household absolutely loved this. I only made 4 servings because I was sure it was to be avoided by the picky eaters; boy was I wrong I was being asked to whip some more up in a flash so they could have seconds. I think it would be a perfect dish for a brunch. Will be making weekly.

I really liked this easy dish.  I had a 16 oz. bag of spinach so I just doubled all the other ingredients.  I didn't have any crackers so I toasted some wheat bread and crumbled that coarsely as a substitute.

I rarely every review things on this website - but this dish was awesome, and it was SO quick and easy!  My husband and I loved it.  I used fresh spinach, but followed the same directions.  I bet you could make the same recipe with frozen broccoli.  Definitely adding this to the weekday repertoire.

This was a really good dish.. I actually used it as more of a dip.. and served it with tortilla chips.  Everyone loved it!  It did take me 2 tries to get it right... the 1st time I tripled the recipe to make for Christmas Eve.. and it was way too spinachy and kind of watery.  I would say if you double or triple it, then to still only use 1-1 1/2 packages of spinach, and add more cheese.  Also, the 2nd time I made this, I drained the access juices from the spinach ( even though the recipe says not to) and it was much better.  Very good recipe though.. with just a few tweaks it was perfect!!  I am making this tomorrow night for a girls night :)

This is an easy and delicious side dish!  It is a great way to prepare spinach.  I made it as directed this time, but I personally would like this even more if it were garlic powder used instead of onion powder, so next time I make this I will use that substitution.

This was pretty good.  I used chopped onion instead of onion powder.  And added some extra cheese.  Seems like it still needed something, I might add something new next time.

This was so good that we are having it again tonight. Only thing we changed was we used fresh spinach. Great recipe and easy to do.

Excellent Recipe! I used fresh spinach. You could even add chicken and make it a meal instead of a side! Thank you!

Used fresh spinach as well, but was way off on the amount I used....hubby said it was cheese with a little bit of spinach instead of the other way around.  But still incredible!  I am making it again tonight, with 3x the spinach, we'll see how I did measuring wise this time!!

We liked this even though I over cooked it. I added chopped water chestnuts for crunch. I would make it again.

This was good.  I was going to give three stars but I'm not a big spinach fan so didn't want to hold that against the recipe.  I've been trying to add a variety of healthier vegetables to my diet and this one looked good.  It does taste good as well.

Made this last night and it shows great potential.  We enjoyed it, but found it a little bland. However, I will make it again and add a dash of worchestire and tabasco as well.  Was very good reheated this morning with scrambled eggs for breakfast.  All in all, a good foundation recipe that you can add to.

Due to other viewers comments, I decided to jazz this recipe up a little right from the beginning.  I added garlic powder, a bit of Lea&Perrins, freshly cracked black pepper, and a hint of red pepper flakes.  Also, I crumbled up about 3/4 a cup of French's French Fried onions, and sprinkled them over the top of the casserole 15 minutes before the cooking time was over.  Delicious!  Even my husband liked it (and, my daughter actually asked for seconds.)  Just imagine that!!  :-D
