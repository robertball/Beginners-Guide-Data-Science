In all fairness, I am the writer of this recipe. It's been quite a few years since I originally wrote this recipe and have made some changes I thought I'd share. I agree with Naples review about using the frozen peas and corn and adding them at the end. This adds a nice additional texture to the dish. The reason I wrote the saffron as optional is because it is pricey and not a typical household staple. I do agree that it is worth using if you can, it does add a rich warmth and beautiful color to the dish. It's best to steep it first in warm broth. This recipe really lends itself well to adaptation because of the simplicity of its ingredients. Adding turmeric, chili powder, curry, ginger, jalapeno etc. Could transform this to your perfect side. Have fun with it! The leftovers are a wonderful lunch the next day!

Yes, this WAS awesome!  Hubs and I both loved it!  It's colorful, flavorful, and interestingly different from most rice side dishes.  I did add the optional saffron and really would recommend not omitting it. It adds a unique and appealing flavor as well as a rich and beautiful color. I used both frozen corn and frozen peas, adding both, straight from the freezer, at the end - no need to cook them with the rice! This, along with Swiss Chard Sautéed with Lime, was an ideal side dish for Spanish Style Albondigas in a Sunny Mediterranean Sauce, both recipes from this site.

I made this with a couple of omissions; I didn't have the red pepper on hand and not sure it needed it. I also left out the corn and celery since I was looking for a traditional, simple recipe. It turned out great and we absolutely loved it. No more rice pilaf from a box for us!

I make this once a month just to change up the rice. It turns out perfect everytime, and the flavour is awesome!. I use basmatti rice, because that is usually what i have at home, and just use carrots and peas, or whatever veggie i have hanging around. the kids eat it up everytime.

Smelled fantastic and was just as good tasting. I substituted cumin, curry and turmeric for the saffron, thyme and parsley. Also combined half royal rice mixture and half white rice for higher fiber content. Used home processed frozen corn and Osem brand consume' instead of suggested chicken broth to keep it Kosher. Will definitely make again.

This was very nice.  I did not have any corn so had to leave it out.  Served it with Tonkatsu and Tonkatsu sauce both from AR.  Good dinner.  I think that next time that I make this I will add some chiles or jalapenos.  I think that this would notch up the flavor a little.  Thanks so much for posting the recipe

This was a very nice dish. Didn't have any saffron but it was lovely anyway.  I served this with Korean Beef Bowl. The two dishes went so well together. Thanks for the recipe.

Really good. I was going to make fried rice but decided on this to accompany a baked lemon chicken dish instead. Followed the recipe but I had to omit the corn because one of my family doesn't eat it. I'm sure corn would be a good add. I was cooking for seven and there still was lots left over. Will make again.

above average, better than some restaurants. Young adult commented on good flavor also and suggested adding eggs. will make again and follow recipe more closely, surely it will be even better. Liked the jalapeno addition at the end, as a side to mix in per serving plate. Tried a plate with Ginger, and another with Turmeric. would prefer to use Saffron next time. this first time, used what was on hand, a couple baby carrots, a can of mixed peas and carrots, frozen red pepper, was out of thyme, saffron and soy sauce, used 50% extra Worcestershire sauce, substituted celery seed for celery, forgot the onion, used all other ingredients, lemon pepper and chicken broth, omitted additional salt and pepper. Giving it a 5 instead of a 4, as my adjustments due to what was on hand when I had a craving for good rice has changed the flavor a little. Prep time was 0, just started cooking and adding.

I will make this again. It was delicious.  I used frozen corn, peas and green beans. As a note I added the minced garlic after softening the carrots, onions and celery. When the Garlic released its aroma (approx. 1 minute) I then added the remaining ingredients.

I was a bit disappointed.... It smelled and looked great, but the taste was just so-so.  Also a bit too mushy.  I think if I made it again, I'd eliminate the canned peas.  But all in all, it was okay.

It's okay. I did not use canned peas as I didn't have any but if i were to use peas I would have used frozen as well as frozen corn. The saffron although expensive is a necessity for this recipe. I usually hate rice but this was delicious and made a lot. I eliminated the lemon pepper because of my husband but would be curious to try next time.

I did not love this recipe, added the saffron which I think is what I most disliked.  Used frozen peas and also added brocollini,  makes a lot! It was ok but needed more flavor

Wow, this went perfect with grilled pork chops!!  I used frozen peas and corn and threw them in the pan at the end of sauteing all of the other veggies.  Was skeptical of the celery and also the lea and perrins, but everything ended up tasting perfect together :)

At least one of the ingredients gave this a peculiar smell and taste - perhaps the Worsestershire sauce or the soy sauce. I did not have any saffron. I added frozen peas and corn after it came off the stove and let them heat up while the rice sat for 15 minutes. 
I wish that allrecipes would give authors the opportunity to withdraw recipes to make improvements. Not everyone reads the reviews before making the recipes.

I made it with everything except the bell pepper, because I didn't have it. Yum! Lots of great flavor. I paired it with Ahi Steaks.

There was just way too much going on with this pilaf.  I was looking for something a little more substantial that plain white rice, but this had too much.  It was like someone just started throwing everything they had in the pantry into this recipe without regards with how it would taste together.  I think what really killed it was the Worcestershire sauce.  Won't be making this again.

I made this dish for a potluck dinner.  I used a blend of brown rice with a variety of wild rices, and I added chicken, which I sautéed beforehand. I also substituted gourmet frozen sweet peas, which weren't mushy at all. As a result, it turned out to be a very colourful  dish, and it was a big hit with my friends! I had increased the quantity to allow for leftovers at home, and my husband is in love with this recipe. I will definitely be making it again.

We liked the recipe...I made it with a few changes:  I sautéed just for a couple minutes the onion and celery in lemon pepper olive oil then added everything else and cooked it until the rice was done.  I didn't have lemon pepper on hand, so used lemon pepper oil instead.  Also I used a wild rice medley instead of just white rice.  The cook time for the rice took a bit longer, but it worked out as I did it.  I also used canned corn but frozen carrots and peas, and fresh red pepper.  It was a tastie side dish with our grilled salmon.

I liked this and it was a side dish to Shoyu chicken from this site. Didn't have peas but subbed with haricot verts.  Used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth to keep it vegetarian.

Yes this is absolutely awesome!!!  My husband even ate this AND LIKED IT ALOT!!  I didn't have the peas, but it seemed to be great without them.  I used EV olive oil instead of butter to make it even healthier.  I highly recommend it!

Ehhh...this was okay, nothing great.   Subbed brown rice, cut lemon pepper In half & forgot peas...very forgettable & won' be making again.  This is one of those side dishes you have to remake into something else, as it is not interesting enough to eat again.
