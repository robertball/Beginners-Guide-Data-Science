Okay Y'all! This was super yummy! I made a few slight changes but nothing major. Instead of the entire bottle of dressing, I used about 3/4 of the bottle. I didn't marinate overnight. I only marinated for 3 hours. This was *perfect*. When it came time for the mayo, I used 1/2 a cup rather than the whole cup. So glad I did this. I think the full cup of mayo would have been enough to overpower the dressing. Once I added the last ingredients in, I put it back in the fridge for another hour or so. We all really enjoyed this. I'll be making it again, for certain!

Wow....this is seriously yummy! This recipe is a keeper! I added chopped red onions, salt/pepper and garlic powder to the mayo. Then before serving, topped with fresh chopped chives and parsley from my garden. Also, I used real bacon bits and used freshly grated parmesan! I made a second batch and used shredded yellow extra sharp cheese, and used white sweet onion instead of the red....sensational!! I am amazed and shocked that cauliflower can taste so good prepared this way! Note: Save drained dressing for another use. Also, very important.....reserve a few TBS. of the dressing to add to mayo! It adds a special zesty kick!! Adding minced garlic from a jar makes this extra super delicious for you garlic lovers!! And you can marinate this for as long as you like! Two-Three days is perfect! The base for this cauliflower would make a perfect pasta salad!

This is WONDERFUL!!!  I dislike raw cauliflower, but this looked interesting so we decided to try it.  Now I look forward to getting cauliflower just to have this salad!!!  Very very yummy and something different to add to the table!  Try it!  You'll be pleasantly surprised!

I didn't want over-marinated cauliflower so I cut the amounts of the italian dressing and mayonnaise in half. I used a homemade italian dressing. Three out of four of us thought this was really good--I actually ate the rest as a snack last night. Next time, I might try to make this lighter using part nonfat greek yogurt in place of some of the mayonnaise. NOTE: The longer it sits, the better it tastes--if you have time, try to make this as early as you can before you have to serve it.

I was looking for a quick way to use up a head of cauliflower so I used this recipe. It was ok. I didn't want to give it a bad rating, since I am the first to review. Suggestion: I'd go easy with the dressing and use real bacon. It was pretty good and very easy. I think some may like it more than I did. Thanks for the recipe.

Fresh vegetables and I are not best of friends!!  However, I couldn't get enough cauliflower when I fixed this dish.  It is outstanding.  (and easy to make.)

I love cauliflower and this is quite inspiring. Instead of mayo I used a coleslaw type dressing (3/4 cup) and it was delicious. No leftovers!! Two of 3 gr.kids went back for seconds, the other just had a huge serving. Thank you for sharing. Will definitely do it again.

I love this salad! I use a homemade Italian dressing made with walnut oil & white wine vinegar.  Otherwise, I am true to the recipe! Flavorful & crisp!

I am not a cauliflower eater, but this was pretty good. I used sun-dried tomato dressing (all I had) and half the mayo.

So easy and delicious. I did get a little too busy and left it marinating a few days. I used bacon cooked crisp and then crumbled in the cauliflower.

I did not care for this recipe.  I will try it again but I am going to try blanching the cauliflower before marinating.  I think that will give the dish more flavor.  I found it very bland.

wow! with cauliflower, i am 50-50. well, this recipe has made me a cauliflower lover!  as mentioned by another cook, i only marinated for 3 hours and it was plenty strong...1/2 c. of the mayo. i think i could have eaten the whole container,if i weren't so worried about the 'after effects'! :) the presentation is very bland looking -- i would suggest serving on a small bed of lettuce. this is a keeper!

We absolutely loved this! I used Greek yogurt so that added protein and significantly reduced the fat/calories. Win, win! I didn't drain all of the Italian dressing and also added fresh ground black pepper and minced garlic per other reviews. I will make this often. Thanks!

It was ok. . . A nice idea, but way too much mayo. I used only 1/2 cup and still felt like I was drowning in it.

Easy and great dish. I made bacon bites, by frying them, draining and cut in bites. I should have cut the mayo in half. Thanks

Easy and Delicious!!  Loved it!  Simple to make.  I used 3/4 qtr head, and marinated it in just about 6 oz.  I added 1/2 cup of mayo and did not drain the dressing, as there was not much and it helped thin out the mayo.  I added the bacon bits, but not the cheese (I am dairy free).  Excellent!

I absolutely loved this recipe. Like so many others, I'm shocked that cauliflower can taste THIS good.  I used fat free italian dressing, only about a half a cup and marinated for 5 hours.  Half a cup of mayo and turkey bacon.  Delicious!

My boyfriend loves this recipe, he says I can make it any time.  I like it too, but not quite as much as him, through no fault of the recipe, I think its just my resistance to cauliflower.  It is pretty versatile too because you can use any kind of italian dressing or other kind of dressing, so that can really change it up.  Its a great way to get your veggies in.

Unbelievable, everyone that has tried this loves it.  Two changes, halved the mayo and used fresh bacon. If you want to make it healthy, use homemade salad dressing and mayo with canola oil.

I cooked the cauliflower in a large skillet with grass fed butter, onions, and garlic cloves to soften the florets. Then put it in a bowl added all the Ingredients. I chilled it and my wife and I loved it. Great as a main or side dish.

Printed this recipe off quite some time ago, made it, wrote notes on the printout but never rated it.  It was easy and good.  Not necessary to drain the Italian dressing off; add bacos just before serving otherwise they become soggy.

This was all right.  I wanted to do something different with cauliflower I had on hand but the family didn't love it and leftovers sat until I threw them away.  Doesn't happen often in this house.

What a vegetable this is. I love how versatile cauliflower is. Marinating it is now my most favorite method of preparing it. I love your recipe and am looking forward trying it later this week (I have 3 heads of cauliflower waiting for me at home.)

I used Tuscan Italian Dressing.  I'm not a big fan of cauliflower but this was great.
