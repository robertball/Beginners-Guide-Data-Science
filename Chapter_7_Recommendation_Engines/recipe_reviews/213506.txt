I thought this was a wonderful addition to filet mignon. I did not cut up the shrimp but left them whole and served them on the side in the cream sauce. I left the option open to drizzle the cream sauce over the filet. My husband did not add the sauce at first, but after tasting it he was won over. I thought it was a delicate sauce and not overpowering. I will definately make this again for a special occasion.

I think a sorghum molasses reduction would have complimented the meat more appropriately.  Keep shellfish on the side.

This was awesome. My family loved it and it will definitely make repeat appearances. I followed the recipe exactly except I added a handful of shredded parmesan cheese. the sauce was not heavy and overpowering as some have said. It complimented the meat perfectly.

Very Tasty!  The only change I made was seasoning the beef and letting it sit at room temperature an hour before cooking.  My husband was a bit concerned that he had forgotten some sort of special occasion (he hadn't) because it is that type of meal.  The one and three year old loved it.  I wish that I had steamed cauliflower to serve with it.  It would have been delicious in the sauce.

While the sauce is delicious, it is too much for filet Mignon.  It would be wonderful over fresh pasta.  But filet mignon deserves not to be overpowered with such a powerful and heavy sauce.  Don't get me wrong the beef was great.  The garlic shrimp cream sauce was great.  They just don't belong together.

My husband, who normally does not like filet mignon b/c it's a leaner cut, loved this.  The steak cooked to tender perfection.  I will cook filets this way again and again (method) even with other recipes.  This recipe is delicious.  The sauce is great. I did add a handful of  parmesan cheese to it.

An interesting twist on surf and turf. Not as savory as I had expected, however this allowed the flavor of the steak and shrimp to really shine through rather than being overwhelmed by seasoning. Actually a fairly simple recipe in execution, but looks so fancy on the plate (and is so rich in composition) that it makes you look like a gourmet genius. I paired with some fancy roasted baby potatoes and prosciutto wrapped asparagus for an intimate Christmas dinner for two. (It was a hit.)

Update--we had half of each of our fillets left over the next evening, but no more sauce. I had no shrimp left but some mushrooms and two slices of prosciutto. I added three minced mushrooms and two minced slices of prosciutto to the garlic and shallots in a new batch of sauce, and a dash of salt and it was nearly as tasty as the original shrimp sauce!

I followed the recipe exactly and I found it to be a great recipe....but not my favorite. I have a preference to Roquefort over this. This is a wonderful recipe....just not my favorite.

This was a great dish. I followed the instructions to the T. Although I did garnish the dish with fresh parsley & fresh Parmesan. Really tied it together. I was told it was a homerun! Will definitely be making it again.

Divine! I made this for my anniversary. My husband and I talked about how delicious this meal was for days. The only change I made was using pinot grigio instead of Chardonnay; it was what I had on hand. One of the best meals I've ever made! Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Loved this recipe! My best friend and I decided to stay in and have a girls night at home. I came across this recipe by random and can i just say i am in love! We used a Rib eye steak instead which turned out better for us because we had left overs ;). If your on a time crunch and cooking for you and someone else  i recommend getting a pound of pre peeled shrimp. Having the shrimp makes it super easy just to throw in the pan with all of the flavorful goodness... The most important ingredient is the wine.  Use something that you know and something that you would have a glass of. My favorite is Kendall Jackson's Chardonnay..

This recipe was simple yet delicious, I loved it! It is definitely 5 star worthy. I did add 1/2 cup of shredded Parmesan cheese to the shrimp cream sauce, and I strongly recommend it! I will definitely be making this again. The shrimp cream sauce would be delicious on pasta...or just by the spoon full it's that devine.

The taste is very good so I definitely will make this again. But it's very oily due to the butter and olive oil. Which also kind of curdles the heavy cream. As we got close to being done eating  the amount of oil was very gross. Next time I will reduce the two tbsp each butter and olive oil to one tbsp each and completely omit the extra tbsp butter added later. We'll see how it goes then!

One of the best ways to have filet mignon and seafood.  I did this recipe for my girlfreind, she was ecstatic!  

I buy fresh green tiger shrimp (huge)- 4 of them.  Don't cut them up.  Serve the sauce on half the steak, along with the shrimp pouring over into some kind of starch goodness(potatoes/rice).  Wonderful recipe!  
Oh, I cook the shrimp on it's own in a high heat pan to get get it glazed properly.  Best way to cook tenderloin, medium rare every time.....thankyou for the recipe!!
The only person that didn't like this recipe, doesn't like pairing seafood with red meat.....imagine that?

I was looking for a garlic cream sauce recipe to make with my filet mignon and shrimp meal for Valentines Day and low and behold this recipe pops up! What a great find and so easy to make. Served the cream sauce on the side and we both enjoyed dipping our shrimp and steak into the sauce. Will definitely make this again!

Amazing recipe! Served it up for New Year’s Eve. Left the shrimp whole and served it over rice along side the steak.

I made it with a venison back strap which tasted like a filet mignon. I added some broccoli.  It was very rich. I doubled the cream sauce and my hubs put it over pasta.

on looks alone I would never do such a disservice to either the beef nor the shrimp. It looks like somone drained the fryolator and poured the "drippings" over what could have been a fabulous meal.

I've always thought that writing a review when you haven't made the recipe was not a good idea...... but I just have an opinion I thought I'd share on this recipe.
I read a lot of the reviews and I think when I make this recipe, I will make the sauce and put over some spaghetti squash as a side dish.  I do not believe I would like to cover that beautiful expensive steak with a heavy sauce.   Just saying!     Just giving 4 stars because I had to give a star rating to be able to write a review.

SO GOOD! It's was delicious and super easy!  I made 4 servings and kept the shrimp whole.  Still served them on top of the steak with the sauce.  It was a big hit!

I made this last night and it was delish! Made as posted but used a hand blender to mince the shrimp and served over steamed cauliflower on top of the filet. Very easy and quick to make and was thoroughly enjoyed by all.....appreciate the recipe!

Prepared this for my family last nite and did I score...Only thing I had to do was add a little corn strach to thicken the sauce.
