I surely do not want to offend any person who has ever enjoyed this recipe, however my experience was a very negative one.  The cake/ cookie part gave a way too much flower taste.  The filling tasted like shortening (Crisco)  the sugar in it was very crunchy even if we had used powered sugar the grease taste would still be there.  To say the least I was totally disappointed.  If I took this to my Church Social, I would be the first Presbyterian stoned to death in West Virginia.

I don't mean to be harsh, but don't think the five star ratings I have read are accurate since the people posting used a different filling.  The filling is really bad, very grainy and no flavor.  I think using butter instead of shortening and powdered sugar would have made it ten times better.  

The cookie part was ok, but I have had better pumpkin cookies to.  You are better off making a great pumpkin cookie recipe and filling it with a sweet cream cheese filling.

The cookies were wondeful.  The filling, however, was awful.  The sugar never dissolved into the shortening (even after beating for 10 minutes) so it had a grainy texture and not a lot of flavor.  Perhaps powdered sugar might work better.  I ended up using a cream cheese icing to fill these and they were delicious!

I have been searching for a good pumpkin whoopie pie recipe for awhile and this is the one!! Not overly sweet or spicy but so moist. Great color and texture,  I love it! Good thing I doubled the recipe, these won't be lasting long!! I did, however, use a cream cheese frosting/filling instead of the one shown. This one will be hard to beat!

These are awesome, filled or not. I even made them healthier by subbing 3/4 cup of whole wheat flour for 3/4 cup of the a.p. flour. Great result. Used this filling recipe : 1/2 cup soft butter, 1 cup icing sugar, 1 cup marshmallow fluff (about half a jar), 1 tsp. vanilla. Beat with a mixer until light and fluffy.

These come out like a cross between a cookie and a cake. Not supper sweet, but when you add your icing/filling (I used the Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting from this site as other suggested, it was PERFECT!) they are just YUMMY!!! I didn't like making sandwiches out of them because after the first bite, the filling is squeezing out all over your hands... So, I just frosted the tops! It worked much better for me! Great for Halloween or Thanksgiving. It's a keeper!

These are good, but really rely on the frosting to pull them off as the cookie is pretty plain.  If you want extrodinary "woopie pie" use the Iced Pumpkin Cookies recipe also from this site.

Ok! These were great!  I made these for a youth lock-in at church on Fri. the 13th.  Only one youth kid got any because when he tried them he took the whole plate of them and locked them in his truck.  He shared one with our pastor's wife and daughter and they both said that they would buy them from me.  I have to confess, I used the Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting for the filling (also from this site).  My husband requested that I make them again so that he can try them.

This is a good recipe for the cake part of it, but not the filling! I made the filling in the recipe, questioning it. When I had it all mixed together and tried it, it was not good! I ended up using a cream cheese filling and it tasted great. Not too sweet, but just right.

I've made these using a different recipe and this is one matches it. The cookies are perfect but, here is a different recipe for the filling...  1 box 3oz instant vanilla pudding 1 cup milk 1 cup white sugar 1 cup shortening 1 tsp. vanilla Blend together until thick.  *Note* I use sugar free instant vanilla pudding because the cookies are already sweet, plus the shortening and sugar, it tones it down.

This should ONLY get a 5 star if you use cream cheese frosting for the middle.  The original frosting written for this recipe is not good at all and I can see why this wouldn't get a good rating.  The cookie part is EXCELLENT!  I've been making this recipe (w/ cream cheese frosting in the middle) for quite some time now and everybody loves them and it's always the first dessert gobbled up when I bring these.

The cookies are very good!  I used a cream cheese/vanilla pudding cream as the filling.  SO good - a fun recipe!

We love pumpkin & are always looking for new recipes. These TASTE GREAT....I gave it 4/5 stars because they were sticky to handle & difficult to store. we ate them like cake with a fork. I used the Whipped Cream Cheese frosting as did others & it's my new frosting of choice. Can anyone suggest a way to keep these from being sticky? I wonder if they were baked on a greased sheet rather than parchment paper?

These were really great!  Moist and SUPER filling.  I doubled the recipe and had way too many "gobs".  I used ready made cream cheese frosting and double chocolate frosting (the kids liked that better).  Really good.  will make again with home made frosting next time.

These pumpkin whoopie pies were delicious and easy to make! Since I read the reviews before I made them I saw that the filling recipe for these is much healthier than cream cheese frosting so to make it less grainy I used confectioners sugar and margarine instead of white sugar and shortening. I also used a little more pudding than half a cup and it turned out great!

I made these with the "whipped cream cream cheese frosting" suggested by other reviewers, and everyone *loved* them! At a Christmas dinner, my in-laws demolished the entire batch (I had even doubled the recipe!) before the meal was even served. People beg me to make these all the time. Great, unique recipe!

I thought that the pumkin part was good but the filling should not be made with shortening. Shortening should not be use in anything that is not Pie Crust or cookies.

These turned out nicely.  I wasn't sure about the filling since it seems that few reviewers actually used it.  I decided to make it and if I hated it, I'd make cream cheese frosting instead!  Previous reviewers are right - the sugar does not disolve so it's a little grainy.  But I really didn't mind that.  It's light and fluffy and tastes great with the cake-like cookies.  My guests didn't seem to mind either!  We did have to beat the filling for about 22 minutes before we finally gave up on the sugar disolving.  For the cookie part, I added 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice and I thought the flavor was perfect.  I enjoyed that these weren't overly sweet, even with the sugary filling!
Update: I made these again with the Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting from this site and I did like it better that way.  That's some darn good frosting!

These were AMAZING! I did substitute the vanilla pudding filling for a cream cheese filling as suggested, and they were just so good I could barely keep my hands off of them! I plan on making these again very soon!

These are delicious! Moist, chewy, and they disappear quick! Make LOTS!  We filled ours with storebought white frosting to save time, but they were yummy just the same!

Was good but not great. Mine were kinda sticky, probably because I added too much pumpkin puree. I also added some pumpkin pie spice & used already prepared whipped cream cheese cake icing.

We loved these!! The pumpkin cake part is so moist and delicious...I added a pinch of allspice, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I used the whipped cream cream cheese frosting from this site!! The only reason I did not give these 5 stars is because they are a bit messy to eat, so I think next time I will double the recipe and make these into cupcakes or maybe just put forsting on top...I will definatly be making these again!!

I am a bit torn as to how to rate this recipe.  The cookie part is quite good... the filling is rather atrocious.  I had a feeling it would be, but wanted to try the recipe as written. I don't prefer my gobs to be crunchy, and that is exactly what happened here.  I would make the cookie part again, add more spices to it (pumpkin pie spice, nutmeg- something to boost the flavor just a tad), and make an entirely different filling.  I'm not trying to be harsh...it is just that this filling does not work on any level.  On the plus side, my house smelled deliciously like Fall and, after scraping the filling off, we still enjoyed the cookies  :)

My husband loves these! He doesn't even need the icing...and he loves icing. I have to agree these are really tasty.  I made one change and that was to use two teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice and leave out the teaspoon of cinnamon.  I have been making these for the past 3 years for the fall holidays and there are never any left to share with neighbors.

This isn't quite a cookie. It's a small cake drop, which is great to dip in frosting or apple butter. Just by looking at the recipe as written, I knew to not even bother with that awful sounding frosting mixture, to substitute shortening for the butter in the batter and to ABSOLUTELY increase the spices. I put in 1/2 tbsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp ginger, 1/4 tsp cloves and 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice. They turned out awesome that way, but they still aren't cookies.

I loved almost every part of this recipe! The cake part of the recipe is awesome! They were delicious. However, after mixing up the filling this recipe called for...I tasted it and was immediately turned off. A filling made almost entirely from Crisco cannot be good! So, I made my own cream cheese filling and added powdered sugar to it to thicken the consistency. I individually wrapped them with cling wrap and placed them in the refrigerator due to the cream cheese, and they were a huge hit! :)

Delicious gobs!  My pennsylvania dutch husband loves them!  I did skip the filling and replaced it with a cream cheese frosting.  Makes moist, tender, fluffy gobs, that really could just be frosted cookies.

As is, this recipe really is only so-so.  The pumpkin cake/cookie part is very yummy, nice and soft and cakey.  The filling, however, is pretty icky.  The sugar and shortening never really blend, so it is grainy and crunchy, without much flavor.  You are probably better off using a cream cheese frosting or something like that.  So I'd say 4.5 stars for the cake part, 1 star for the filling.

These are pretty good, but I wasn't blown away. I didn't use the filling as it didn't seem like the traditional filling I'm used to.

These were good and everyone seemed to enjoy them.  I followed recipe exactly.  Pumpkin part was a little sticky and the filling was kind of strange.  But all in all, yummy.

Fantastic!  But you've got to try the original filling.  I know it sounds weird, but it actually comes out similar to the filling of a twinkie!  I'm sure the cream cheese filling is good too, but try the original, it's great!

The cookies are great. Filling grainy and unenviable. I thought sugar was wrong and I should use powdered sugar but second guessed myself. Really wish I hadn't done that.

Flavor was good but the filing was too grainy with the white sugar. If I make them again I'll use a cream cheese frosting. Hard to eat when it feels like sand in your mouth.

This recipe is AMAZING! The cookies are incredibly most and the flavor is perfect! I made them for the first time tonight and I'm extremely pleased with the turn out. I read the reviews before making them, so instead of the filling that the recipe called for I used my vanilla butter cream recipe instead. I was also out of baking soda so I doubled the baking powder and used pumpkin spice instead of the cinnamon. I will definitely be making these again.

The pumpkin gobs are very moist and tasty however, the icing was horrible!  The sugar never dissolves.  I beat the icing for 40 minutes and it still never creamed into the mixture.  I had to use another icing recipe.

I am working on this recipe as i type this and so far i am happy with the results i am getting. I however did not go with the icing recipe that is posted. I used my own which i sware is amazing. 1/2 C crisco 4 C powdered sugar 1 egg white 1tsp vanilla and adding a little bit of milk at a time till it's a nice creamy mixture. This icing taste amazing and by adding the milk it not only makes it smooth but takes away from some of the overwhelming sweetness of the powdered sugar.

The cookies and the cream filling both weren't that sweet, so if you want a cookie with not that much sweetness,  you would like this. I'm not saying they weren't good, just not sweet. 

I tried it a second time, adding maybe a teaspoon of nutmeg and almost a bag of white chocolate chips and they were better. I know the additions arent approximate, just use your better judgement. Also, I didn't bother with the cream filling.

While the filling is a bit gritty, in smaller quantities you don't really notice.  I like the idea of these cookies and will most likely make them again but I will be searching for and trying alternative recipes.  Definately don't make my mistake and make the cookies too large; they end being a meal!

I have now made these twice for holiday events with friends/family, and they disappeared (with accolades!) both times.  I didn't even bother making the filling, based on the other reviews...  You can never go wrong with cream cheese frosting!   Tasty and simple - A great substitute for a pumpkin roll without all the work.

The gob part was easy to prepare. I tried making the filling and it tastes horrible. I also substituted the vanilla pudding by using vanilla pudding cups.  What I did with the filling after making it according to the recipe was to add 2 more teaspoons of vanilla extract and 1 can of vanilla frosting. I blended well and that took off some of the taste from the shortening. I froze the leftover filling to use on a later date.

The cookie part of this recipe is really good but like many other users I agree that the filling is a bust.  I'm making them again using either a cream cheese or marshmellow fluff type filling recipe.  The granulated sugar never blends in the original recipe.

Upon making these for the first time and not really reading the recipe thru i realized that there is a total of 5 cups of sugar, well i tried to figure out where it was all supposed to go, i didn't make the filling. I only used 2 cups of sugar in the cookie mixture, and the filling takes 1 1/2 cups so where is the other 1 1/2 cups suppose to go does any one know? On a brighter note these cookies were soo moist and delicious i will definatly make them again and i probably will add some extra spice like pumpkin pie spice for more flavor, i also made a glaze using powdered sugar and add the pumpkin pie spice to it  and drizzled it over the cookies.
