Sounds like Brenda  is full of herself. Excellent recipe. It's five by itself. I'm sure Brenda brought it down to three stars.

I did tweak this recipe and then it made it 5 stars!  I used more onion and more carrots.  I took some chicken stock and mixed it in with cream cheese to make it thick and creamy in place of using half and half.  I used seriously sharp cheddar cheese and super sharp cheddar cheese and when the soup was done I pureed part of it to make a thick and creamy soup.  This was an excellent soup with my changes!

Made this recipe a few days ago, everyone in the family loved it so much. First time I made it I used frozen broccoli, which was great, but the second time tried it with fresh, steamed broccoli and it was even better. Can't recommend enough for a simple delicious meal. Thanks for sharing this recipe with our family!

I really enjoyed this recipe as did my husband.  The only change I made was to add some garlic with the onion.  The soup is really flavorful and is surprisingly filling.  I like that it can be made quickly with ingredients that are readily available all year long.

I thought this was delicious even before I put the cheese in. I should have read the cook's notes and made a lot more though. As written, we had two not quite full bowls and would be good for a side. But I WILL be making more because it was so good and easy. The only change I made was using veggie stock since we're vegetarians.

The only change I made was to purée the soup with the onion, celery, carrot & half the broccoli in it so my kids didn't see the other veggies! They only like broccoli - I added the other half of the chopped broccoli after that so there was still some texture to it. Absolutely AMAZING soup!!!!!

Easy to make and tastes so delicious. I really appreciate that all of the ingredients are fresh. So many other recipes I read used canned soups (such as cream of chicken) or processed cheese. I read others reviews and, as one suggested, added a bit of garlic to the mix and I omitted the carrots and celery (because I don't like them in rich soups). I then doubled the recipe as the author mentioned. We loved it and are thrilled to have leftovers. This one is going to get used again and again.

I loved this! I followed the recipe except the simmering time between adding the broth and the vegetables because it smelled so good and I was getting hungry! After simmering for 12 minutes, the vegetables were just right without being mushy. I also used 1% milk in place of half and half, added an additional 1/3 cup water and reduced the cheese to about one cup. Very delicious, but next time I will at least double it to make sure we have enough for it as our main course for dinner and leftovers for my husband and I.

Update 1/14/19 I needed to use up some fresh cauliflower so I used half cauliflower and half broccoli. It tasted great as well. I love this soup.

Delicious lunch paired with warm from the oven muffins. Doubled the recipe using slightly less flour. A touch of garlic was a nice enhancement. Also preferred sharp cheddar instead of mild for richer flavor. A great find!

Used heavy whipping cream because I didn't have half and half and a little less onion.  Great recipe and my kids thought it tasted just like Panera.  I'll be making more and freezing in individual portions.

I sautéed the onion, celery, carrots together and added a half cup of Jack cheese because I ran out of cheddar.  Very nice soup and it turned out great.  Doubled the recipe and it made just shy of 3 quarts.

I needed a quick easy soup for an afternoon event at church. I  doubled the recipe and was able to make this delicious soup in under an hour. This might be the first time I didn't have leftovers from a potluck! It was a hit. I was told that it was delicious and that the vegetables were cooked just right - not too hard or too mushy. I loved the look of the bright orange carrots in contrast with the creamy soup and bright green broccoli.

This is the BOMB!! Don't change a thing! The fresh broccoli at Aldi's looked beautiful yesterday so I bought 3 packages. This morning I opened my refrigerator and thought what am I going to do with all this broccoli. My 12 year old daughter thinks it taste BETTER then Panera's. Good because that place is too expensive for what it is! MAKE THIS!! You won't be disappointed.

My husband's comment was,"BAM! This knocks it out of the park!" This was absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and I agree with others-the only thing we would change is doubling or tripling  the recipe! Excellent! Thank you! We will definitely make this again soon.

I tripled this recipe to serve 6 people and had 2-3 servings leftover.  This was easy and delicious!  Will definitely be a repeat for us!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!  Side Note:  We used the leftovers on baked potatoes the next night and it made for a delicious meal, as well!!

Simple and delicious.  I'll definitely be making this one again.  The quantities listed make enough for 2 hungry people, so definitely double this recipe if you're feeding a family.  No complaints from my kids about broccoli for dinner tonight!

On my stove, things cooked a little faster than listed, so check for thickness of sauce and tenderness of veggies as you go.  She's right that you definitely want the veggies al dente.  That's just good cooking, but it was the only trick to this recipe, so it's worth mentioning.

Excellent soup and easy prep!  For a low carb, keto friendly version substitute almond flour for white flour.

Second time I have made this recipe.It is great.  I double it so I use the whole container of half and half.  Prep work takes awhile, but I just put a movie on and get to work.  Definitely a keeper!

This was excellent - the family loved it! I had some leftover broccoli in the refrigerator, so I waited to add it until the carrots and celery were done. So easy and delicious!

5 stars isn’t enough. It is the best broccoli and cheese soup I’ve ever had and better than Panera bread. Nothing needs changing. It is excellent

Very tasty!  I made a few tweaks like adding milk for a portion of the half and half (I didn't have enough), I blended the majority of the veggies to make it smoother, and finally substituted cauliflower for 1/3 of the broccoli. The whole family really love it.

Quick and easy recipe for a week day evening meal. I had about half of a can of cream of celery soup left over that I added when I stirred in the chicken broth. Made just enough for lunch tomorrow. Will definitely keep this as a "go-to" easy dinner.

This, with a few minor tweaks per personal taste, was delicious!  I doubled the recipe so I could have leftovers.  When I added the onions to the butter, I added a teaspoon of minced garlic, as well.  I skipped the celery because I hate it and added a healthy tsp + of salt and about 1/2-3/4 tsp white ground pepper.  I used a mix of pre shredded bagged Kraft (R) cheddar and some fresh grated extra sharp Drucks (R) white cheddar (and probably used a bit more than called for because, well, because it's cheese!).  I found it a touch bland at tasting, so I added a dusting of seasoned salt and a dusting of Adobo seasoning.  Perfect.  Try it as is, and then alter w/salt/pepper to your personal tastes.  THANKS for the recipe!

This recipe is awesome. So simple, yet so tasty. I followed the directions exactly, only adding extra chopped onion and two cloves of minced garlic. At the end, I added additional seasoning salt, adobo and garlic powder. I also used sharp cheddar cheese for a bit more flavor. I won’t be buying this at Panera any more.

Delicious. To get this on the table faster and avoid the risk of getting the milk mixture too hot and damaging the texture, I steamed the veggies in another pot.

I really enjoyed this soup, however I wish I saw the "cook's note" before I made it.  I was assuming it was for a full batch of soup for leftovers; not a half batch.  Nonetheless, that was my mistake for not checking reviews partly and my rating isn't reflected by that.

This soup was super easy to make and gained the stamp of approval from my boyfriend, a fairly picky "I'm not picky!" eater.  The only edit I might do next time is to puree some of the soup and reincorporate it... I like chunky soup, but it was a bit too chunky for me.

Followed the recipie exactly as written.  It was absolutely  delicious  and I'm not a fan of broccoli .  I would recommend doubling  the recipie.  As written,  it served only two persons.

Excellent. I used half an onion, other than that it was phenomenal. 5 stars all around, I will make it again and again. A note to other cooks- make sure you truly simmer this and watch it closely. The first time I attempted it, the soup boiled for 10 seconds when I wasn't watching and I had some curdling. This time it came out amazing!

Everything turned out perfectly!  I was skeptical because I've never made broccoli soup and I was doubtful cheese soup could be tasty.  This was a hit! Easy to make too.
Definitely will make this again and perhaps add some potatoes to it.

I will give this five stars because I like the fresh ingredients, but honestly haven't made this yet.  I have Monday soup night every week at my home for the neighbors, so I like to make soups on Sunday because most soups taste better the next day IMHO.  Can anyone make a suggestion on how to reheat this successfully?  Thanks!

Delicious! This recipe is a keeper! I doubled the recipe and used a 900ml container of chicken stock, reducing the amount of cream to about 1.5 cups to compensate for the extra stock. I reserved about 1/5th of the cheese for garnish. Visually the soup is beautiful (I don’t care much about this aspect of any recipe, but it’s a bonus here!) Will definitely make this again soon.

This was a really good 1 pot recipe. It was very simple to make and tasted amazing! You can also add some chicken to it for a heartier type meal, and if you use precooked chicken such as John Soules chicken fajita strips that will cut down on your cooking time, or you can just get chicken breasts and cut them into strips or 1in chuncks.  The only thing that I would do differently is not adding other vegetables. It tastes so good with the broccoli it really doesn't need carrots and celery or anything else, but that is my personal opinion. I also believed that it needed more cheese than the recipe called for and we ended up having to go to the store to purchase more cheese in the middle of cooking but I believe that it was way too weak and runny and needed the extra cheese to thicken it up and taste right  but again, maybe that was me. But all in all the dish was very good.

I thought the indredient list well balanced. Having tried failed with other Broccoli Cheddar Soups with the cheese becoming gluggy I was glad to see this one started off with a roux as I have successfully melted various types of cheeses into roux mixtures. I did take the pot off of the heat completely and added the cheese at just under 130 degrees just to be sure. I did have to add the water as it does reduce and then thought to cover the pot which helped to cook up the veggies in about 15 minutes.  Felt I didn't chop the broccoli fine enough and used the immersion blender through it before adding the cheese. Creamy and delicious, will make this again!

Really love this. Added garlic as other reviewers advised and it’s a nice touch. We are a family of 4, (and two are young and don’t eat as much); I doubled it but I wish I would have tripled it.

This recipe was pretty good but lacked a bit of flavor. I added smoked paprika and mustard powder to give a bit more depth like my favorite version of this soup I’ve found on Averie Cooks website. Nice starter recipe though.

super simple to make. i used a whole shallot instead of a quarter of an onion. One broccoli crown was probably 3 cups so i ended using 3 1/2 cups total of  broth and cream. 1/4 tsp white pepper and 1/4 tsp salt. the salt could have been omitted entirely. it will be on the menu more at my house

This is really easy and very delicious!  To begin with I did double the recipe-every ingredient. I used whole milk rather than 1/2 & 1/2 (what I had) and to the doubled amount of cheddar I added an additional 1 cup of shredded Velveeta. If you're searching for a broccoli/cheese soup recipe like I was, pick this one, I think you'll enjoy it.

I made as shared with perhaps a little more or less of the 1/2 & 1/2 and broth as called for.  It was just great and would definitely do it again!

One of the best soups ever. So good, full of delicious vegetables like carrots and onions, and of course the broccoli. It's a little bit of work to make, but so worth it. I like to leave some of the vegetables chunky as opposed to pureeing but either way is awesome. Great with a bread bowl!

I’m glad that I doubled the recipe because I had 2 cups but my hubby probably had about 4 servings/cups and the pot was empty. I was hoping that I didn’t have to cook tomorrow, but um... well, I guess I should be happy that he liked it that much. II was looking for a quick and easy recipe. It took more than 40 min maybe because I used a Dutch oven and doubled the recipe? But it sure was easy to make. I’m lactose intolerant so I used lactose-free half & half. I cooked onion with 1 tbl ghee(no lactose!) and 2 tbl canola oil then added 3 tbl of Earth Balance Buttery Spread before adding the flour. Although I’m intolerant, I love dairy and I haven’t found a non-dairy cheese substitute that won’t compromise the taste so I had to use real cheddar. Because of that, I still had to take my Lactaid pills but the result was a delicious soup that I could eat and made my hubby very happy. Thank you for sharing!

We liked it, but it was a bit salty for our taste. I will make it again, but will use low sodium broth. It's easier to put more salt in than to take salt out.

Liked this a lot, mostly followed except didn't have half and half so used half milk and half heavy cream.  I like the addition of celery and carrots.

I made this soup and it was wonderful! The only thing and I mean the ONLY thing I would change next time is to sauté all the vegetables together and steam the broccoli first - I had to let mine simmer for well over an hour. All in all it was delicious.  PS I also doubled the recipe as noted by some of the other cooks  no leftovers.

Delicious, and satisfying. I followed the recipe as written with one exception, and that was to add minced garlic with the onion.

Delicious!! Followed the recipe and amounts for the most part. Used fat free half and half cuz I’m fat. Added some cauliflower and garlic. Used white cooking wine instead of salt and white pepper instead of black pepper. A note however, doubled the recipe and still only filled my Dutch oven about half way.

This recipe was just, eh.  Not a lot of flavor or richness.  Extra salt and cheese added afterwards helped, but those help everything.  Maybe use this as a base and then add in extra flavor agents like Worcestershire or bell peppers and other veggies.  I think there are better recipes it there, but this was easy and not bad.

Loved this soup!!!  I didn't have half-and-half so I used whole milk; I used two skinny stalks of celery instead of one; I added a little nutmeg and just a tad chili powder toward the end of cooking.  Other than those minor changes (ha ha) I followed exactly.  Oh my, how delicious.

Wow, don't change  thing. The recipe is amazing as is.

Most simple yet sophisticated recipe I've ever made.

I always thought soups required a dash of this spice and a dash of that spice.

Just a handful of ingredients cooked in one pot and you'll be impressing a lot of people.

Very good! We liked the "Costco" Cheddar cheese soup, but decided to make my own (without the chemicals) It is even much better than the store bought! The only thing I would consider is to add a little more chicken broth as it tends to thicken as it sets. But very good, the vegetables remain a little "al dente" so it's good to be able to bite down on something!

So I changed almost everything bc I was trying to use up stuff in the fridge before going out of town. Used closer to 6 TBsp butter, 6 TBsp flour in the roux, same onion, 4 c frozen broccoli, 4 c water (didn't have any chix broth), and maybe 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes, 1/2 tsp garlic powder.  Taste and consistency were awesome. Took a bit longer to get broccoli soft, but just added bits of water until it turned into what I liked. Served w a chunk of fresh baguette. Thanks, was awesome.

I only made one change, because I didn’t have any mild cheddar.  I used Colby/Monterey Jack.  This is a tasty soup.  I’m certainly going to put it in my Favorites.

This recipe is terrific!  My husband and I loved it. My only suggestion is to allow a bit more time to put everything together. The prep time given is probably true for those who regularly make the soup, but allow more time for first timers. They are correct...better Han Panera!

I made no changes to the ingredients of this delicious version of Broccoli Cheddar Soup.  The only change I made was to take  3/4 of the vegetable pieces and whirl them in a blender to make the soup thicker and even more rich in vegetable taste.  I LOVE THIS SOUP.

I loved it!  I didn't have any broccoli so I put in a ton of potatoes!  Best potato (and broccoli) soup ever.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was  very good. I followed the recipe almost exactly except I added a 1/2 c. more broth than called for because I thought it needed more. I give it 4 stars because the texture was grainy for some reason.

Really very good!  I doubled the quantities, but when I added the vegetables, I felt as though I wanted more broth.  While the vegetables were simmering, I made some additional stock in a saucepan off to the side, about another 2.5 cups worth.  With about 3 min left in the simmering time for the veggies, and before I added the cheese, I stirred in my extra stock.  Served in a bread bowl toasted in the oven.  Would recommend and will definitely make again.

This soup is amazing!!!  Creamy, cheesy with just the right amount of crisp/tender veggies.  I loved it! This will definitely become part of my normal repertoire.  Next time I will double the recipe as this only yielded 2 servings if using as your main meal.  The recipe notes do say that the author halved it.  That said, if you are looking for 4 small cups to serve as a soup before the main meal, then this amount is fine.  Thank you very much for the recipe.

This was a super easy recipe. I would definitely double the recipe, unless you’re making it for one person.  It yielded about three servings. I’m a big cheese fan, but this was a tad too cheesy for me. I would double the recipe, but maybe not double the cheese.

This is nice and thick, rich and loaded with ingredients. Very nice and I will make it again. Maybe I will use less cheddar next time to make it more diet friendly.

Tried it for the first time last night.  Turned out great!  Followed it as is except for using a shredded cheese mix of Colby & Monterey Jack we already had in the fridge. Will definitely double it next time should we have some left to freeze and try adding some garlic others have mentioned.

My husband loves the Panera version of this soup so I was super excited to try this in Kim’s Kitchen! I followed the recipe as written and it came out perfectly! I added an extra 1/4 cup of chicken broth because I didn’t want to waste what was left in the can. My husband gives it 5 stars! We ate it with a loaf of French bread but I think a softer loaf of pumpernickel would pair better. This one is a keeper! Thanks for sharing

made this with veggie broth instead of chicken,  and using pepper jack cheese in place of cheddar,  since these were on hand already.  It turned out really good, and warmed up from head to toe.

Love this recipe. We had heavy cream instead of half and half which made it extra creamy. We used slightly less  cheese, so it was more cream of broccoli and it was so good.

YUMMY! I made this in my crockpot express and it took about 20 minutes (minus chopping the vegetables). I added carrot, celery, broccoli and zucchini. The celery was a bit of an odd texture but great flavor, so next time I would diced the celery smaller. Again, yummy!

This was excellent. Double the recipe. I missed the authors note about doubling the recipe and it made two bowls. I left out the carrots and I used fresh broccoli. It was so easy to throw together. I skipped adding the flour to the butter and added a tsp cornstarch after I added all the liquids (fyi for anybody watching their carbs) and it still turned out a perfect soup consistency, not too thin.

Great base for additions. I made it last night and added garlic in with the sauteed onions. I also added some turkey kielbasa to make this a whole meal in a bowl. Would also be good with mushrooms, corn, potato, or some diced chicken breast/leftover rotisserie chicken.

Just go ahead and double this!  The only change I made was using some 2% milk, some half & half.  I will make it again but probably add garlic and red pepper flakes.

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly. My only problem is it wasn't a big enough batch, because we like leftovers. Thankfully it was only my husband and I. I will definitely make this again. It could easily be modified if desired.

I love making soup for Saturday night and this one will be in my rotation! Other than adding some minced garlic, I followed the directions to the letter, and it was delicious. After just one bite, my husband said it was very good and ate every spoonful.  I made it with frozen broccoli, because it was what I had on hand. The next time I will use fresh. From start to finish 40 minutes. Definitely a five star winner!

Very good, and simple at the same time.
Wish I read that this is just for half the recipe before I made it. Next time I'll be doubling or tripling it!

Made this the other day and just wish I had doubled it as there wasn’t any left over. Added it to my favorites. I wish I had cooked the veggies (broccoli, carrot and celery) a while longer before finishing. They could have been a little more tender for my taste. Very good and will make again. I used fresh broccoli and 8 oz bag of sharp cheddar pre shedded. Thanks for the recipe!

So yummy and easy to make 
The only thing I changed was using lactose free half and half (were lactose intolerant) and a little minced garlic with the onion 
This is so good thank you so much for the recipe my family loved it;)

This was great! I would recommend finely chopping the broccoli. I left mine a bit chunky and while it tasted good, I think I prefer a broccoli cheddar soup with smaller pieces. I will definitely make this again!

My husband gives very little praise and what's good to me gets only an OK from him.  So for him to praise this soup request it again was news-worthy.  Like many, I doubled the recipe.  The only change I made was to use 1 can of evaporated milk instead of milk to give the soup a richer body

Followed the recipe as written and it was 5 stars! I've made this soup at least 20 times in the last year or so and I thought I'd give it a review. The only change I make is to add a little garlic based on other reviews but it's still 5 stars without it. I do triple the recipe though I like leftovers!

I enjoyed this recipe very much, however I would add 2 cloves of crushed garlic for a little more flavor.  Also. It should be noted at the beginning that this is a VERY small batch.  Only turned out to be 3 bowls for my husband and me.  For all the prep involved be sure to double it.

I served this last night to my house guests from Wisconsin.  I made a double batch thinking we would have leftovers for today's lite lunch before the Super Bowl Party.  Think again!  They hate every last cup and fought over the last few spoonfuls!  I served it in individual bread bowls and we all agreed it was the best broccoli cheddar we've EVER had.

Delicious!  I used milk instead of half & half.  I doubled the recipe, except for the veggies & got Four 12-oz. bowls.  There was still plenty of veggies for the creamy soup.  Already planning on presenting this at our next gathering :)

This was fantastic. I used 2 shallots instead of the regular onions because I needed to use them up. Kept everything else the same. My mom, who insists she doesn't like soup, went back for seconds. This is a keeper!

This soup was great! I think I put too much broccoli because the texture was a bit off but the taste was excellent. Boyfriend loved it as well. Good thing I doubled the batch though; fed us both and had a portion left over for lunch the next day.

My hubby and I loved it and we graded it an A. No changes needed and it was awesome. We added this recipe to our list of favorites to make again.

It tasted alright. It was so time consuming, and I’m not even upset about that. It made justttt enough for two people and was sooo thick. I should of went with a different recipe.

This recipe is delicious and very easy to make. Double it, at least, because you will want leftovers!  
My only changes:
*Really browned the onions for extra flavor
*Used half milk and half heavy whipping cream (didn’t have half & half)
*chopped my veggies fine for kids sake. 
*Served with homemade garlic Parmesan focasia bread. 
Definitely adding this one to my regular rotation!

Delicious! I modified using vegetable boullion and half the flour, and a tad more celery. A filling and delightful soup on a cold day.

Made this for my coworkers and they loved it! It was my first time making this soup, and I will definitely use this recipe again. 
I didn't use the exact measurements listed in the recipe, but kept the method the same. I used some milk instead of half in half to reduce the fat, and it still came out great. The other thing I changed was using mostly really sharp cheddar and some store brand "sharp" cheddar, and the taste was nice and cheesy but not overpowering.

My boyfriend and I like to try Gordon Ramsey recipes, but while his was a simple one for broccoli soup, it was seriously lacking!! We had so much broccoli left (after making a small sample batch of Gordon's recipe) I got on allrecipes.com and found this. We had 5 times the broccoli it called for so made 5 times as much and gave some to friends and neighbors. Everyone LOVED it!!

I loved it! I doubled the batch from this recipe and had to add a little cornstarch to thicken it to my liking.  I'll make it again. This was my first cream-based soup I have made. Happy it turned out just how I wanted.

Amazing! The only thing I changed was the cheese to sharp cheddar, but that’s just a personal preference. Everyone in the family loved the soup and already is waiting for me to make it again. I definitely appreciated the note about doubling the recipe (I’ll probably triple it next time since I was feeding 5 adults). The instructions were clear and easy to follow, and the end result was wonderful! This is definitely being added to our recipe book :)

I had never made broccoli and cheddar soup before. I followed the recipe except for two things. I did not add celery, one, because I didn't have any and the reason I didn't have any was because I do not like celery and never buy it. Second, at the very end I added a half teaspoon of dry sherry. I had read it in another review, and I use it in two other soups I make from recipes I got from here. We thought it was delicious and easy to make. I served it with warm buttered rolls.

I followed the directions as written with few exceptions. I did not have cheddar so used a Mexican blend that I had on hand.  I cooked the celery and carrots during the initial 10 minutes cooking time, and added the broccoli for only 10 minutes. This was purely a personal taste.  I like the carrots and celery very soft and the broccoli and a bit less so,only cook the broccoli for about 10 minutes. An excellent soup

I'd make this again.  Better than Panera.  I doubled it the recipe, plus added another half a cup each of chicken broth and half and half.  Waited to add additional salt until after the cheese was added because I was worried it would be too salty.   It made enough to serve 5 using my big soup bowls/crocks. Served w/fresh crusty bread.  Delicious.

I left out the carrots and used 1% milk instead of cream. I used three kinds of cheese and doubled the recipe. It's very close to how I'd have made it if I was inclined to wing it tonight.

YES!! This is what broccoli soup should taste like. We had to improvise a little because we didn't have exact ingredients.  instead of half and half, we used half a cup of heavy cream and 1 c whole milk and used 1/2 cup of chicken stock.  So in the end liquid measurements were the same, just dairy to stock ratio was different.  Still turned out amazing.  Will make this again 100%.  FYI if using frozen broccoli, let the carrots and celery cook 10 minutes before adding it in.  Thank you for sharing!!

Yum!  Very simple recipe and absolutely delicious.  I tweaked it a little bit, added potatoes and doubled the batch, plus I added garlic and sautéed carrots with the onions as well for more flavor and added more spices, but other than that, really good base recipe!

The ONLY change I made was to add a tsp on nutmeg and thyme because I've seen it in other recipes.  This was a simple,  low carb (only 2 TBS flour for the whole pot) recipe and it's my new fave!

I made the double batch “as is”.  Came out great!  Tastes like Panera...but better.

I used fresh goat milk from a friend who is a farmer instead of 
Half and half and added more carrots.  It was yummy.  Will make it again.

Excellent as is. My husband and I enjoyed this filling soup. I'm never sure about "salt and pepper to taste" so I could have added more but we enjoyed it very much. Very close to Panera.

This recipe was delicious! I only had skim milk in the fridge so I substituted that.  I also added more broccoli florets.  Big hit with everyone.  I pulled my portion before I added cheese.  It was awesome.  I would double the recipe as it isn't enough for leftovers if you eat more than a portion size.  Thanks for sharing Sandy.

My family loved it. I’d recommend doubling all the ingredients to get more then one meal out of it. Other then that the only change I did was to substitute chicken broth with chicken bone broth.

Very tasty! I doubled the recipe for leftovers and added a few extra spices, but overall followed the recipe as written. Mine did not come out as thick, I might have been a little impatient with the thickening process... my bad.

Gosh folks, I had to try this broccoli soup after seeing all the positive reviews. Unfortunately, I didn’t enjoy it at all. This did not taste like Panera’s to me, it was missing something but can’t figure out what it was; only that it was cheap to make as I had all the ingredients on hand.

Very good recipe!!  We used 1% milk instead of half and half to make it a *little* bit healthier.  I used an immersion blender to blend the broccoli and carrots before adding the cheese so it was a smoother soup.  Great recipe, thanks!

It was awesome and easy to make. The only thing I would change is by reducing the cheese. My family thought it was too cheesy. Otherwise awesome.

This is an excellent recipe, and you can adjust just about everything to make it to your liking.  I didn't happen to have any half and half or cream, so I used non-fat milk and it turned out great.  Really, really good flavor.

I made this today. I must say it was wonderful, I double the recipe and next time I will double that. It will freeze well, and if you go to that mush work to make it .You should have some left to  freeze for another day. Next time I will up the flour, I would like it be a little thicker. I used sharp and Colby jack cheese. When I taste it after I finished cooking it,I thought it needed just little something so I added just sprinkle on Lawerys seasoning salt. It was perfect after I added it. I will definitely make this again. I. It is my favorite soup. I used to like Panera but then they changed their recipe about two years ago. It's just not the same as it was before. Thanks for the great recipe!!!! CFC

it's finally soup season and we're all loving it in my household. I made this for the girls the other night and they told me their dad has to resign as the cheddar broccoli soup maker lol because this was the best they had ever tasted!!! I used 8oz of Velveeta instead because it's what I had on hand, but that was the only difference.

This recipe was really good and both my husband and son enjoyed it very much. It wasn't a difficult recipe but it did take time to make. I doubled the recipe and used a little milk mixed with the half and half to decrease the fat content a bit. I also used about half the amount of butter but added some olive oil again to reduce the fat.  I also added a garlic clove because I was a little short on onion. Great recipe served with crusty italian bread.

This was amazing and very easy! As many have mentioned, the serving size is off, so I doubled the recipe and it was enough for 4 normal size bowls.

This soup was awesome. I doubled it and between my 2 big boys and myself,  we ate almost all of it! Served it with some Italian bread with butter. They loved it! The only thing I didn't add were the carrots because I didn't have any on hand! So good. I'll make it a lot this fall/winter!

After reading some of the reviews, I made only a few additions.  I  doubled it because I knew one batch wouldn't be enough and I had just purchased a big bag of broccoli from Costco that was begging to be used.  I added an extra cup of chicken broth and two cups of shredded, cooked chicken.  This was a very easy and fairly quick recipe.  We have made it twice and will once again.  It is very good and filling.  You won't be disappointed!

This soup tastes great! While I make it I did notice that sometimes it did not thicken that much so if that happens then you just need to melt some butter and add flour till thick and golden brown and then whisk it into your already made soup and let it sit for a minute and thicken fully. The first time I made it I did find it salty in the end, but anytime after that I just don't add salt, only pepper and it is wonderful!

I've made this 5 times and it IS worth 5 stars.  We don't eat butter or cream so I use olive oil, double the flour and use skim milk instead if half and half.  Also use 1/2-2/3 of the cheese but use a Mexican shredded mix and lots of black pepper for added flavor. Love it!!

Really good, I did tweak a thing or two. I did not use the carrots or celery. Not a fan of either. I added two to three more spoons of flour. I could tell with a cup and half of chicken broth it would not be thick enough to my liking. I also added one chicken bouillon cube for more flavor. Turned out yummy!

You must use EXTRA SHARP cheddar. It’s so much better. Great recipe. I switched the instructions and added the chicken stock first and then the milk. It was delicious.

Didn't have celery, so used red pepper.  Sautéed the carrots & pepper with the onion.  Used 1/2 whole milk & heavy cream. It was a bit thicker than I like, so added a little light beer to thin it. Will definitely make again.

I love broccoli and cheddar soup but never tried to make it myself.....until the other day. I wanted this so bad I decided to give it a shot. The only thing I did to it was add more cheese.  Gave some to my mother in law and asked her if she thought I should add any thing. She said yes, another bowl so she could have more.  We both love it and will be made again.

Absolutely wonderful recipe— perfect as written.  The texture and flavor of the base is delicious. I think a key to success is almost constant stirring, stirring it back down the instant bubbles form in the center— so not one to make when I have three other things on the stove!  I then made a few additions:  used a rich stock instead of broth, added a little garlic and a little dried basil (trick I got from Stuart Anderson’s potato soup recipe), puréed about 1/4 of the soup, and used a mix of sharp and medium cheddars which I grated myself.  Nice twists, but not necessary. I will use the base here to make other creamed soups.

This is excellent.  I used whole milk because I would never eat half and half, although if I made it for guests I am sure I would because it would be better.  Bad me!  :)  I used corn starch instead of flower because I have a genuine (via endoscopy) diagnosis of celiac, so I try to eliminate gluten.  Otherwise I did everything else the same.  Loved it.  Making a double batch makes total sense!  Thank you Sandy!

Delicious! Didn’t even have time to snap a pic before my entire family, including the 4 and 2 year-old devoured the entire pot.

This was delicious and easy to make. The only change I made was sautéing 2 cloves of garlic with the onion. I doubled the recipe so we would have leftovers. Next time I might triple :)

Excellent recipe. I doubled the recipe so I would have some leftovers I followed the recipe as written except I was out of celery. I steamed the broccoli and carrots and added them in at the end. Will definitely make again!

I made this soup almost to the letter. I added a little more chicken broth because I was afraid it would be too thick. It was delicious. I had never made broccoli cheese soup before. I'm sure I'll be making it again.

The soup was delicious and I would and did not change a thing.  And you are correct it is close to Paneras Broccoli cheese soup but I liked what I made better for it had a nice light creamy base and not so thick!  I will make it over and over again!!!

This was really good and quick and easy. The only addition I made was to add a couple of large cloves of garlic when sauteing the onions, otherwise I followed the directions to the 'T'. It was a great recipe, thank you so much!!!

I doubled the recipe, as to have more leftover. The only thing I did differently, was I added an extra cup of chicken broth and a couple of cups of water to make it more liquid like. I’m sure it would have been just as good either way you make it. Very filling! Thanks for the recipe. I will be making this again.

Good base recipe that I doctored up by choice given what veggies and cheeses I had on hand... more broccoli than called for, and added mushrooms and some chopped green pepper, mix of cheddar and pepper jack cheese, etc.   Resulted in a version with some good flavor depth!

Delicious.  I had shredded carrots I needed to use up so I used that instead of chopped carrots.  I added extra half and half, Broth and some sharp cheddar because I wanted to use up the little bit I had left in the fridge.  My fiancé loved it and almost ate the whole pot himself.

Made it just like the recipe, except that I had heavy cream in the fridge so I mixed half heavy cream and half milk. (Is this why they call it half and half?) It was delicious and  I agree it is as good as Panera's. We aren't huge salt people, but this recipe seemed to improve greatly with more salt than we usually use. Do yourself a favor, if you don't already, start using pink or grey salt. :)

This is, without a doubt, the best Broccoli Cheese Soup I have ever tasted.  Doubled the recipe and made it as written, with only the addition of a heaping 1/4 tsp. Cayenne Pepper right before serving.  A real hit!  Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Modified slightly, evaporated milk in lieu of half and half, and didn't add celery or carrots (didn't have on hand) - turned out great! Making again soon!

This recipe is AMAZING and the best broccoli & cheese soup I’ve made!  I tried another popular one from this site that included cornstarch which went ok one time and horribly wrong the second.  This one is soooooo much easier and taste better too.  Easy peasy!!!!  I did as suggested and double the recipe for a larger batch.  I’ve found my staple soup!  Thanks!

Very happy with this recipe. I doubled the batch but decreased the half and half and increased the (subbed in low sodium vegetable) stock. I used a bag of frozen mixed broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots. I added marjoram, ground nutmeg and a mustard to increase the flavor depth. I also added fresh shredded Parmesan to the cheddar. Very yummy. Great with crusty bread.

I made this for a family Christmas.  I didn't add any salt, only black pepper to taste, and I 4X the recipe.  It still worked well, and filled a 6 quart crock pot (for holding).  It was a hit and will definitely become a Christmas tradition!

I’ve made it with chicken broth and it was delicious! However, the second time I made it, I only had cream of chicken soup. I used that and it turned out super creamy. Both work well! I also used coconut flour instead of regular flour and you could not taste the difference.

So quick n easy. Will make many times over. Didn't have half n half so 1 cup 2% milk and 1/2 heavy cream. Added garlic like others have mentioned. Changed this for 6 servings and ended up 4 small but full bowls. Will make a much bigger batch n freeze some.

The only change that I made, and it was by her suggestion, was to double the recipe.  She mentioned at the bottom that it only served a few servings, and even doubling it, it is not a lot, but it was very good.  I use my neighbor as a guinea pig, and she said that of all my soup recipes I have tried on her, this one was her favorite, so that is saying something.  The best part is, is that it does only take an hour to make.  Delicious!

Great recipe on its own. I tweaked slightly by adding about 1/2 cup each of the stock and cream just to boost the amount. Adjusted thickness with some stock and cornstarch because of the added liquid. Had some bacon laying around so added that as a garnish :)

Holy guacamole, this soup is amazing! We didn't add the celery because no one is a fan around here and I was about 1/4 cup short on cheese so I topped it off shreaded parm, but other than that my six year old and I followed this recipe and ended up making one of the best family dinners we have cooked together. We will definitely be making this again!

This is an excellent recipe.  Easy and delicious.  I also doubled the recipe and used vegetable broth to make it vegetarian, and used skim milk instead of cream.  Still came together great.  My family really enjoyed. Thanks for sharing

I tripled the recipe because we are a larger family.  The only thing I added was garlic!  It was a huge hit.  I also transferred it to my crock pot so it would be ready for dinner time.  Great recipe!

A-ma-zing!!! In my opinion it does taste just like the popular restaurant. Yay!! The only thing I did different was use sharp cheddar cheese because that's what my family buys, and I used slightly less than 1 C of it since it wasn't mild. This kind of soup was my favorite when I was basically just a toddler, and this recipe did not disappoint!

This was the best soup I ever made. I did use heavy cream 3 cups and doubled the recipe on all the other ingredients. Since I used low sodium chicken broth, I did not add extra salt and it was perfect. I did use 4 cups of cheddar cheese instead of 3. Perfect consistency. Definitely will keep this recipe as a family favorite.

Oh, yes, make this soup.  Just as written is fantabulous.  My group of teens ate it up - I will say that I doubled the recipe and that only fed 4 people - and only 2 had seconds.  But they all loved it.  I had some diced ham in the freezer which I added  - about one cup. **Note: after making it several times I realize that increasing the servings to '12' barely feeds my 5.  Increase servings so you have enough!**

I loved this recipe and made minor changes. I threw in a bit of fresh cauliflower since I had some left over, used whole milk instead of half-and-half since it's what I had, added 3 good pinches of red pepper flakes and seasoned it with parsley flakes, marjoram and basil. It was absolutely delicious. The seasoning changes were only due to our taste preferences since the base soup was wonderful as is.

I halved this recipe for a trial run.  I've had bad luck with trying a recipe full out and have it be a flop.  So, after that, this recipe is superb! I followed exactly.  To my liking, I would cut back a bit on the broccoli and a bit on the cheese. But this recipe is excellent!

This is by far the best cheddar broccoli soup I have made! It is so good there wasn't any left overs. Only switches I made was veggie stock instead of chicken stock.  My husband isn't a big celery fan but loves carrots so he said it was great just no celery and twice the carrots.

I didn't have half and half, so used whole milk, otherwise followed recipe.  Very simple and easy to make and tasted delicious!  Went thru several recipes to find one without processed cheese - ick.  

Will  definitely make again and again!

I doubled the recipe to feed 2 hungry adults and 1 hungry child, and only 1 lonely serving remained. This soup was wonderful! I adhered to the foundation of the recipe, but tweaked slightly to suit family's taste. While sautéing the onions, I liberally seasoned them with pepper, garlic powder, and marjoram (love it in soups!) Subbed 1 cup heavy cream since I had it on hand and used chicken base instead of broth, thus eliminating the need for salt. I used an extra stalk of celery and cut my carrots into matchsticks. I would've added more broccoli, but didn't have it (next time though!) I seasoned the simmering soup with a dash of nutmeg (a must for milk or cream-based soups IMO) as well as jarred roasted garlic, onion powder and a bit more pepper and dried parsley. Before adding the sharp cheddar, I gave the soup a few pulses with the immersion blender right in the pot, as I wanted a few chunky pieces of broccoli too. The veggies were perfect after simmering the allotted time.  Served with a loaf of crusty bread and a nice red blend from a lovely Napa winery, this dinner was a winner for our recent Meatless Monday meal. Bravo, Sandy!

Delicious!  I doubled it for my family, as the cook noted.  I didn't have half-and-half, so I used more flour and milk.  Seemed just as good.

Just made this yesterday for my family! We all loved it. I doubled the recipe to have enough for the four of us and did half broccoli and half cauliflower because I had some to use up. 
I also used sharp cheddar because we like a strong cheese flavor. It was delicious.

Tripled the recipe for a hungry family of four, and had enough for left overs.  I added slightly more onions, broth and cheese and went heavy on the pepper because it was a bit bland for our taste.  I suggest blanching or steaming the broccoli before adding to the soup.  Otherwise,  very tasty and  hearty.   Seemed like restaurant quality.  I will make this again.  Thank you.

Super delicious soup!! Pretty much followed the recipe as is, but eyeballed the ingredients and used Beef stock, since I was out of Chicken stock. It was a winner, even the picky 2 and 3 yr olds loved it.

Delicious as written! I doubted it would make 4 servings and so I doubled it, which was perfect for a family of four plus a little leftovers. I made it with all the same ingredients but added the cream and cheese very last, after all the veggies simmered in the broth until they were soft.

This tasted just like Panera. I followed the recipe to a t. Doubled it though. At the end I found the soup to be a bit pasty so I thinned it with some more broth. So freaking good!!!

This was good.  I used frozen broccoli, but wish I had used fresh - it would have been better.  It needed a decent amount of salt and pepper.  I blended most of the contents, before added the final handful of broccoli.

Absolutely deslish!! Only changes I made were I used a bit more onion and lots of cheese, both which were just personal preferences. Even my husband who normally isn't a huge broccoli fan was going back for more and asking if there was enough to take in his lunch the next day. Definitely will be making this recipe again :)

Tasted delicious and my picky family ate it up!  Only change I made was adding one cup equal parts of chicken broth and water to make the soup a little thinner and increase the servings without comprising the taste.

This was really yummy and easy to make. I did use milk instead of half and half because I didn't have any. I also added just a little more chicken broth so the recipe would go farther. it still turned out thick and cheesy. 10/10 will make again.

Delicious! Unfortunately I forgot to purchase half & half so I had to substitute with 3/4 c almond milk (plus 1/4c veggie oil to help thicken). Also, added additional 1 tbs of flour to help thicken. I did half sharp cheddar, half mild because I like cheese!! Oh, and I added some cooked ham :)

I didn't have any half and half (or celery). Instead,  I used a block of cream cheese and an extra can of chicken broth. I blended half of it in the blender for a smoother consistency.

I made the roux as written except I doubled it.  I didn't add the celery or carrots because I didn't have them.  I also steamed the broccoli in the microwave prior to adding to the mixture. I doubled the rest of the recipe as well.  I liked how thick it was but added extra broth to thin it out so I'd have more portions.  I also used my immersion blender to break up the larger pieces of broccoli. I would make this again.

Absolutely delicious.  I did take some advice from other reviewers and about doubled the carrots, onion, and celery.  I added a couple cloves of chopped garlic and some cayenne and black pepper, as well, for a little heat to offset the richness.  I used sharp cheddar instead of mild, as a matter of personal preference.  I am craving this soup daily and will make it again soon.

This was the best broccoli cheddar soup recipe I've ever made! I've made it three times already, once using vegetable broth in place of chicken broth so it was vegetarian.  Follow as written and you won't be disappointed!  So easy!

I didn't have any half and half, so I did the cream cheese trick.  l added celery seed because I didn't have any celery.  I also added some garlic salt in place of regular salt.  I steamed the carrots and broccoli and then put them in the blender with the liquid.(My kids don't like "chunks"). It is amazing!!  Creamy rich and wonderful.

I thought this was delicious! I did add garlic but that was the only addition I made. I did find that the carrots overpowered the flavour but it could be just me. Am totally going to be making this again!

I quintupled this for our weekly family dinner. Everyone except the two-year-old loved it, and there is no pleasing her tastebuds right now! I used fresh broccoli, and used vegetable broth.  The vegetable broth was unsalted; I used 2 t salt, which suited our taste. I used probably twice the onion that was called for, and a little less butter (I cut the 15 T called for down to 12). I used sharp cheddar because I prefer it. It was really, really good.  I will definitely make it again. Next time the only change I'll make will be to purée half of it with my immersion blender.

1st time I made this soup I thought it was too rich for me and  I was going to stick to my usual recipe for broccoli soup from America's test kitchen. But for a change, I came back to it and tried to reduce that 27 g of fat per serving ! So I used some half and half and some 2 % milk and low fat cheddar cheese and only half the amount. The soup was still creamy and delicious. I might use just 2 % milk next time.

This was AWESOME! I doubled the recipe for my family of 5, but it looks like I should have tripled it. The only difference I made was added an extra cup of broth, used a mixture of heavy cream and milk (didn't have half-n-half) and I used a blend of Mexican cheeses. So so good!

I didn't have half & half so I used sour cream that I tempered first so it didn't curdle. It was excellent! I loved it. To temper the sour cream (or any creamy thing)....I added tiny amounts to the hot soup little by little all the while stirring like crazy.  You can do it the other way around also....put your sour cream in a bowl and add little bits of the hot liquid and stir like crazy, then add that mixture to the main pot. Does not freeze well.

Very good doubling recipe; adding 2 chopped carrots & 2 celery & replacing  heavy cream & flour with full fat cream cheese, using 2 bunches  of fresh broccoli florets nuked for 5 minutes !! Added 1/2 c. water to get better consistency. .

An Atkins recipe keeper !!!

I've made this twice already and it is absolutely delicious! I did add 2 cloves of garlic but I'm sure it would have been just as good without it but I love garlic so I just add it to everything.  The second time I just added a little extra carrots and brocolli since I would rather have a chunkier soup but that is just my preference. We all loved it and this will surely be a recipe I will use again and again.

This is yummy!!! We add extra carrots and celery, and today I added some chopped potato too.  Rather than salt, I add one cube of chicken bouillon.   If you like pepper, try a shake of cayenne in addition to fresh ground black. Be sure to use a good quality sharp cheddar.  mash vegetables just before serving to give desired texture.

Yum.  This soup was easy and delicious!  I used sharp cheddar instead of mild only because I forgot what the recipe said when I was shopping.  I'm sure it would be amazing with any cheddar.  I wanted to have leftovers so I doubled the recipe as discussed in the cook's note.  I'm so glad I did because it reheated well and still tasted great. Thanks for the fabulous recipe, Sandy!

I'm not usually a big fan of creamy soups, but decided to give this a try anyway.  So glad I did!  It was delicious.  Husband and two year old both loved it as well.   I followed the exact recipe, though I did double it as suggested.

The soup had stood flavor with the sautéed onions-- it added a different but good taste to a regular broccoli cheddar soup. The recipe was very easy to follow, and as a novice cook, recipes are often hard for me! I skipped the celery because my husband and I don't like it. I also used Monterey Jack because that's all I had, and I think it turned out well! I would cook this again.

This is so good! Absolutely delicious and tastes better than the Panera's soup.  I made it exactly as the recipe called only adding a little more liquid in the end because we like our soup thinner than how it came out.

Made this soup. Very good. But the serving size says it feeds four... That would probably be a not very hungry group of 4. Next time I would double if not triple the recipe.

Wow, this is really good!  I used frozen, chopped broccoli and sharp cheese.  I also used 3/4 cup half and half and then 1/4 cup 1% milk because that's what i had on hand.  I did add some extra cheese as i wanted my soup a touch more cheesy.  Delicious!  thanks for sharing!

Delicious!  Great base recipe and easy to tweak (or substitute ingredients) based on personal preferences.  I doubled it but used two heads of broccoli so I had to add more broth.  I added garlic.  I cooked it longer because I personally love my broccoli to fall apart!  Others have suggested pureeing veggies... As much as I love chunky soup, I bet pureeing half of them would make every spoonful more flavorful.   Five stars as is!  It's also a great soup to change for personal preferences!  The possibilities are endless... Kate, peas, etc...

I also added garlic, and had to improvise on the half and half because I didn't have any. Mixed 1% milk with about 2 tbs. cream cheese. added a pinch of garlic salt, cayenne, and 1/4-1/2 cup beer. I also pureed some of the veggies at the end of cooking, prior to adding cheese. With the my extra touches, I felt the amount of cheese suggested, wasn't needed, so ended up adding only about 1 cup. The end result was 5 stars, but I realize I made many changes from the original recipe. Delish!

Made it just  like the recipe states and it tastes great.  In the future I will make changes for my own tastes to include crispy bacon and chives as a topping.  It is a bit  thick so may increase broth to 2 cups, again personal preference.  Pair this with a piece of fresh bread and you have a meal.  Thanks!

I used more carrots and celery stalks (2 each) - and Tillamook medium cheddar - and no salt of course.    Even more delicious the 2nd day when I served it on a brown/wild rice mix.    Could be topped with toasted almond slices for a really yummy healthy meal.   I WILL make it again.

Um, this is AH-mazing. I make lots of recipes I find online, and most of the time even if I like them I don't feel compelled enough to review! But this was SO amazingly yummy. I made it exactly as is (only thing is I used frozen broccoli). My husband, 2-year-old daughter, our guest and I gobbled it all up - and I even doubled the recipe! Will make this time and time again.

This is REALLY good. I made no changes to the ingredients, but I did change the execution a bit because I was looking for a cheese soup vs. a broccoli cheese soup. (Hide those veggies from the rest of the fam!) After the vegetables softened, I put the mixture in the blender on the highest setting for about 1-2 minutes. Then, I added the mixture back to the pot, added the cheese and cooked the 5 minutes. Then, I blended it again. Great recipe. I will try it again without the broccoli to see how that adjusts the taste as well.

Funny story is that no one in my family really likes broccoli cheddar soup.  In fact, we usually will choose something else if this is on the menu but I was making it for a friend recovering from surgery, and I thought that most people do seem to like it so it was a good choice.  Turned out, it was a GREAT choice.  All of us who tasted it loved it.  I actually made it gluten free because we have one person who can't have wheat, using rice flour instead of wheat flour.  I also made it vegetarian by using veggie broth instead of chicken.  That is it.  Only changes I made, and my family has now decided that we should have this again, just for us.

Love this.  I did make a couple of additions.  I sauted minced garlic with the onion.  I used cream cheese along with th half and half and beefed up on the broccoli.  Also used truffle salt.  Will make again!

So good!  I followed the recipe (maybe less celery since the hubby is not a fan) and it is delicious.  Because my broccoli amount ended up being more then called for, I ended up adding more half and half and broth so it wasn't so thick.  Absolutely love the flavor and freshness, and most of all that it has no packets of this or canned cream of that, all natural and simple.  Awesome.  Definite keeper!

Whole family loved this. I didn't add celery as I don't like it, but added about a tablespoon of garlic instead. It did taste similar to the Panera soup but didn't taste quite as greasy. Thank you for posting this!

Absolutely LOVED this! I doubled the recipe & used 2 bags of frozen broccoli plus a total of 4 carrots. I put the carrots, onions, & celery thru the food processor. Followed the directions to a "t" except I turned off the heat when I stirred in the cheese. The soup was plenty hot enough for the cheese to melt without the extra 5 min. Easy peasy & absolutely delicious!!

Delicious!  I added garlic to the onion and used half white half yellow sharp cheddar.  Also used half heavy cream half whole milk because it's what I had.  Finished it off with chicken broth to thin it out. Just like Panera... Filled bread bowls. Yum

We loved it.  I made a couple of changes.  Sauteed the vegs separately first, then followed the rest of the recipe except I used white aged cheddar.  We don't like the yellow because of the dye.  Also aged has more flavor.  Overall it's the best.

I used part Velveeta and part cheddar.   Very good recipe!
