This was sooooo good, and a bright change in flavors from the old mayonnaise-based potato salads.  I did add 1 tsp. of sugar to the vinaigrette to cut down on the sourness, and garnished the finished product with a sprinkling of feta cheese.  This would also be delicious with chopped black olives.  YUM!!!  Everyone I've served it to loves it!

absolutely excellent!  nice change of pace from the mayo-based salad.  Made changes based on necessity and preference.  halved the recipe but kept garlic amount the same.  Used red balsamic, dried basil, red onion, fresh chopped parsley, and roma tomatoes squeezed out and seeded.  added a bit of lemon zest and 1/2 tbsp. lemon juice to the dressing and this brought on an incredible level of flavor without being overwhelming.  Only had honey dijon mustard.  The colors are beautiful.  Followed the recipe proportions exactly even weighing potatoes, and using measuring cup.  I've never had a recipe where the dressing amount was so well-proportioned to the dry ingredients.  Just the perfect amount.  Excellent flavor and such an eye-appealing dish. **this would be a perfect potato salad to take on a picnic...no mayo to worry about heating up in the sun.

OMG so good! This will be my go-to potato salad from now on. So much healthier than mayo based potato salads! This was absolutely delicious. I didn't have tomatoes so those were omitted. I also used regular balsamic vinegar instead of white balsamic vinegar. I really can't say enough about this salad! One tip: I always overcook my potatoes when I boil them, so I cubed them and roasted them in some olive oil at 450 degrees for about 20 minutes and they were perfect. Because I used olive oil to roast, I cut the oil in the dressing by a tablespoon. I will probably use even less next time. There will definitely be many next times!!!

I tried this for my husband yesterday and we both loved it.  Couldn't stay away from it.  He grows fresh basil, so that is what I used.  Excellent!  I will be making this again often!

Wouldn't change a thing; we absolutely loved this potato salad.  For anybody doing Weight Watchers Plus, this calculates to 4 points (WOW!).  This is going into my Favorites folder.

I was looking for a copycat recipe for a local restaurant's potato salad, and this came pretty close.  Since the potato salad I was trying to replicate only had red potatoes and green onions, I just used that with the dressing.  Fantastic!  I can't wait to try it "as-is" because even my husband, a non-potato-salad fan, loved it.  Feta cheese would probably put it over the top for me (in a very good way!)  I'll be using this again.  Light and easy - two words I love to associate with any recipe in my house.

This is wonderful!  My kids thought it was too strong but my husband and I loved it.  Lots of flavors.  Would make a great potluck recipe.  I used a mixed bag of potatoes from Trader Joes that had a combo of purple, red and white potatoes.  It looked lovely with all the colors of the  tomatoes, potatoes and herbs.

What a hit! I don't care for mayo in potato salad, so this recipe was perfect. I didn't have fresh basil so I used dried and added fresh cilantro for a green effect. Thank you for sharing, a definite keeper.

Wow, don't leave out the basil!  I made this with what I had on hand...no basil or tomatoes.  Just added tomato and basil from my parent's garden to the leftovers...and it's amazing!!  What a great blend of flavors.  Love the dressing!

Great alternative to mayo based potato salad.  Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.  I omitted the tomatoes.  Will definately make this again and again.

This has become my "go to" potato salad! At times I have added soft garlic-goats cheese and left out the basil! YUmmY! Tastes even better the 2nd or 3rd day!

This was awesome.  The herbs combined with the dressing gave it great fresh flavor.  All raved.  I roasted my potatoes first in small chunks and that made it extra yummy.

This salad was good, I followed the recipe closely, the only changes I made was cut the oil to 4 tablespoons, and use rice wine vinegar because I didn't have any white balsamic. As I said, the salad was good, but nothing extrordinary, also it reminded me A LOT of a salad I used to make from a Betty Crocker cookbook. I will likely make this again IF I'll be making potato salad again, but this didn't wow me enough to want to make it again soon (I am not a potato salad lover though).

Delicious and perfect for hot weather, without mayonnaise. Next time I'd cut down to one clove of garlic -- it was a little overpowering for me.

Really good. Was out of white balsamic vinegar so used rice vinegar instead. Next time will have the correct vinegar as mine was a little too bland. Added a little green pepper and a pinch of sugar. A keeper for sure. Thanks Jean.

This was great,made it for a party and received many compliments.  Used the Absolutely Fabulous Greek Salad Dressing, red potatoes, 1/2 the feta, canned sliced olives, yellow and green peppers.  Our family loved this, we don't like mayo so this is our new potato salad.

This was an easy recipe with nice favors. My store had no fresh basil so I had to use dry. I know it would be much better with fresh basil. I added salt and only half the green onion (husband's ongoing request with any recipe). I will fix this again.

Loved this! I followed this recipe and wouldn't change a thing. However, I would add feta and perhaps a few sliced kalamata olives if I have them on hand next time. Thanks, it is a nice alternative to mayo based potato salads.

This is a great potato salad to make for entertaining. The dressing is very tasty.  I only used 1 tsp Dijon mustard in mine though. If you don't have red potatoes russet potatoes work just as well.  I've made this recipe a few times and the last time I added a cup of blanched edamame.  Keeps well in the fridge for a few days.  Give this recipe a try if you're tired of the standard mayonnaise potato salads.

The dijon made it quite strong! I would actually suggest a little less and maybe a little more basil? Not sure.

What to make when all I have in the house is potatoes & tomatoes? Yum! I also added a red pepper & a can of black olives, & I omitted the celery as we're not huge celery fans. Delicious!

I didn't have any white balsamic, so I used the regular kind. It made it all a bit more dark, but the vegetables still stood out.  Tastes great!

Excellent as written.  And a nice change from heavy mayo-potato salads.  But what made this even better was fresh lemon zest.  Lots of it.  Wonderful for warm summer days!

Thank you! I was looking for a Vegan recipe for potato salad, and I have found one to keep the Vegans in the family happy, as well as the finicky have to have it like grandma's happy too. Thank you!

This was perfect, and nice not having to worry about mayo.  Didn't have red potatoes, so I just used Idaho.  Also used white wine vinegar.  We also didn't have any tomatoes, but it was fine without them.
