I have been making this for years as my mother made it before me. I add garlic powder and I make sure to refrigerate overnight to allow the flavors to meld. I just have served with regular butter crackers and it has always been a hit. Thank you for posting it here for other cooks.

This is a greawt base spread. I've been making it for years and oftentimes add capers, a bit of horseradish, garlic powder or pimiento for variations. For an appetizer version I add a couple tablespoons of reduced fat mayo into the mix, then bake in mini phyllo shells for 12mins at 375 degrees. They are yummy and look really nice on an appetizer buffet.

I have brought this to 2 parties (it is so simple to make, even I can make it!) and have had 4 requests for the recipe!
It is delicious.  I spread it melba toast and on the miniature horsdevours bread loaves found in the deli.  Don't spread it on too early or the toast will get soggy.

I used a package of light "whipped" cream cheese for this recipe and I added a teaspoon of garlic powder. The kids and I ate this with homemade pita chips and rippled carrot "chips"--we really liked it. I would make this again but add more spices.

We love this, so easy to make and once it sits overnight or even just a few hours, the flavors come together well.  I make it into a 'cheese ball' by chopping up pecans and shape the cheese into a ball then roll in nuts until covered.  Great for parties and game day.

We've used these ingredients to make ham rolls. We spread the cream cheese on a rectangle slice of luncheon ham then lay a green onion on one short end. We then roll the ham, and cut into small bitesized pieces. It makes a great appetizer. We also sometimes spread the cheese on a soft tortilla/burrito, then place the ham and onion on top and roll. They work best if refridgerated in a ziploc baggie before cutting.

My Ash-b-gash is not a deli meat kid, but could eat a bagel with cream cheese for every day for lunch. Even though the recipe called for ham, I figured I'd give it a shot. Fortunately, she loved it and so did Ty. Thanks Friend!

This is wonderful served on bagel chips or with pumpernickel sticks for dipping. I add just a dash of garlic powder for added zip.

A nice place to start. A HUGE hit when  I made the following adjustments.  I was looking for something to help use up leftover holiday cream cheese and the bits of Christmas ham.  Had to make something to take to a party and this came upmin search.  I trippled it for New Years, but it definately needed some zing.  I added half of a finely chopped sweet onion, an small handfull of dried shallots and, to the trippled batch, about 3T of Penzey's Sunny Paris seasoning--if you don't have that use "fine herbs".  Whipped all in my mixer on a medium setting with about 1/4 C of skim milk-I wanted folks to be able to scoop it on their cracker without needing a utensil.  Took it to a party of about 50 New Years revelers and it was GONE.  The only thing, in fact, that was totally eaten.  Definately a winner.

This is a great base recipe! I did add a few things: 1/2 tsp of garlic powder, and a big tbs of dry onion dip mix. mixed all the ingredients together and shaped the mixture into a log form. I spread about 3/4 cup or crushed walnut bits on some wax paper and rolled the cheese log on top of the nuts so that the log is fully covered with walnuts. then put it in the refrigerator for about 4 hours. It turned out really good! Definitely making this again! Will add another tbs of dip mix to it next time to add a bit more zing to it :)

While the flavor was good, it was way too salty. I'd suggest adding some veggies such as celery or chopped onion. Otherwise just the cream cheese, ham and green onions were extremely high in sodium.

This was soo good. My son doesn't like onions, but I told him to try it anyway. His opinion was "Excellent" and put away nearly half of the batch by himself. This momma was totally proud. All my kids loved it. I didn't have plain ham, so I used 3 oz Canadian Bacon and 3 green onions and I even went so far as to use 1 cup of chopped pecans and rolled it into a log and refrigeratored for a few hours. It was soo good. Thanks!!

Thanks- I needed something simple-I added just a touch of Lawrys seasoning salt-I preferred it that way since I was eating it with some bland wheat crackers. I didnt make a ball just ate it out of the bowl

People were scraping the bottom of the bowl to get every bit of this delicious stuff.  Let the flavors meld overnight, but be sure to take it out of the fridge at least an hour before you plan to serve.

We add a few dashes of garlic powder and a splash or two of worcestershire sauce. Great to make at the beginning of the week and to snack on while waiting on dinner. We love to use pretzels for dipping.

It was good, I added some ground up sweet peppers to it.  I used it as a salad topper.  I tried it on some crackers and it was good that way too.  On top of a good garden salad it was even better!

This is the recipe I use for a cheeseball. I always double it and add 1/2 cup chopped pecans to the mix. Then I roll it all up into a ball and cover with another 1/2 cup chopped pecans. It seems so simple, but it's delicious.

I use this basic recipe but then just throw all of the ingredients in a food processor along with some dill pickles, some of the pickle juice, and a little dry mustard.  This sourness balances out some of the richness and it can be used as a ham salad for sandwiches on toasted bread.  Delicious!

Followed Exactly except for I used doubls smoked ham and Neufchatel Cheese instead of cream cheese. You will find it right next to the cream cheese in your grocery store. It has 1/3 the fat and the exact taste and consistency as cream cheese. I did not add any extra spices because the flavor of the ham mixed with the cream cheese and green onins is perfect on its own. mmmmm mmmm

Super easy! Very tasty for just 3 ingredients. Definately better if made ahead of time & stored overnight in fridge.

I liked this but it was a bit bland.  I put my ham through my meat grinder and mixed it with the other ingredients.  Later I added some dipping mustard which put it over the top.

Very tasty and mild.  I did use fat-free cream cheese and it gets kindy sticky.  I know it would be better with real cream cheese but .. when trying to eat healthy, you get what you get :)

I changed the recipe just by one ingredient, only because I was in a hurry. Instead of using regular ham - I used a can of Hormel Deviled Ham Spread.  Great on crackers. My kids love it.

Very good...yummy on celery as well as triscuits. Kind of rich though...too rich to make a ham salad sandwich with.

This was SO good!! I added a small handful of finely shredded cheese into the mix, but it would have been good without it too. I just love cheese! Next time I might add some chopped black and green olives. This was good as a spread for crackers and it was also good spread on flour tortillas and rolled up. It's amazing what two simple green onions can do. Very flavorful. Thanks for the recipe!

Not only is this spread easy, it's really good too! It was one of the appetizers I served at my daughters tea party. Kids and adults both loved it! We had it on crackers with and without cheese. Excellent both ways. It's hard to imagine something this simple could be this good! I will make this again.

Love this! My friend calls it "Polish Rose" in a bowl -- apparently that's what they call those appetizers - ham and cream cheese rolled around a green onion - this is the dip version and we can't get enough!Everyone wants the recipe.

husband loved it! needed something to help use up leftover Christmas ham and this will be one of our go-to's every year. made it as directed and shaped it into a log and wrapped up in Saran wrap before chilling in the fridge. it doesn't look terribly appetizing, but the taste it's delicious and it disappeared quick.

This is a good recipe, my daughter in law introduced us to it.  I have noticed the ham makes a big difference, if the ham is salty the dip will be salty, if you use a sweet ham, it will be sweet.  So pick your ingredients accordingly, and your crackers too, if the ham is salty choose a cracker with little or no salt.  The rich buttery ritz goes well when a sweet ham is used.

This recipe is amazing -- super easy to throw together with fantastic results.  My husband and sons loved it.  I added garlic powder to it and with the added garlic powder, I rate it 5 stars.

Simply delicious! I added garlic powder as I felt it lacked a little something.  I also used turkey ham and no one knew any different! My mother-in-law even asked me for the recipe ;)
