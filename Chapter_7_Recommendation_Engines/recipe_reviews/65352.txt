These bars were really really good. I added chopped Reese's PB cups to the baked cookie layer before adding the marshmallows. This was a GREAT addition and provided another peanut butter flavor dimension with just a hint of chocolate. Perfect! I did not top with syrup, it seemed like overkill. 
My only complaint with these bars is that they are very difficult to cut and serve. The marshmallows stuck to the knife and upon taking a bit the marshmallow topping seperated from the bar. These were wonderful when eaten with a spoon along side some icecream!

Though I liked the way everything tasted together, the marshmallows were terribly difficult to cut through and ended up coming off the top layer of the bars.  If something else was used for a topping instead of marshmallows these could really be terrific.  I also added Rees's Pieces for some extra flavor after the base layer in the pan.

These bars are really yummy.  They are kind of messy to cut into squares because the marshmallows are so gooey, but that's nothing to complain about.  Yum!

These were ok. I added chocolate chips, cuz i'm a chocoholic.  You could cut down on the butter a bit. They just didn't have enough flavor.  However i also might not have cooked them for long enough.

These were pretty good. I added peanuts to the top layer, and baked the cookie portion for only 15 minutes instead of 20. not spectacular but still pretty good.
