This is delicious! Don't let all the fresh ingrediants discourage you from trying it. I have made this seveal times now, but I use canned corn and tomatoes and it tastes great! I use one can if diced tomatoes, and one can of Mexican tomatoes and chilis (instead of the jalapeno). I serve it with cheese quesadillas. Yum! It's kinda like the Tex-Mex version of tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwiches. I garnish with sour cream and chopped red onion. The first time I made this I thought the step where you puree half of it was strange, but it really adds to the texture. Don't skip this step if you can! I have actually done that to some other dishes since then, it's a good trick. Really beefs it up. This is a wholesome, hearty meal, a good change from the tradional chili.

I sauteed a little garlic with the vegetables in the beginning.  I also used 1 red bell pepper, eliminated the jalapeno pepper, chopped the mushrooms into small chunks because they were large, used frozen corn niblets, and only used 1/2 tsp. of cumin.  I didn't bother pureeing some of the chili either.  It was tasty as chili, especially with some shredded cheddar as a topping.  Another time though when I reheated it, I added an extra cup of chicken broth to the leftovers as well as some cooked brown rice.  I think I actually preferred it this way as a yummy black bean soup. Of course, when adding more liquid, you can adjust the seasoning to your taste.

As a US student studying in Norway for a year, I promised my scandinavian friends some good american chili. I chose to make it without meat because of its high cost here. Of course, because I had never made chili before, I turned to this site. We all agreed that it turned out quite well. I changed but a few things based on availability and cost differences here (no jalapeno or broth, used canned tomatoes and corn, substituted one can black beans with red salad beans, added zucchini, garlic and carrots), and it turned out great. It was perhaps a bit too spicy for the average person, but I liked it just fine, and my international friends were impressed. I think it is not quite 8 servings though. I fed 5 other people and had just a small bowl leftover.

Good, tasty recipe for no meat chili.  Did not add the corn and added double mushrooms and tomatoes (personal preference).  Will definitely make again and try different chili peppers to kick up the heat.

My husband -- NOT a lover of meatless dinners -- raved about this chili! I served it with pico de gallo and sour cream as a garnish. Yum! It's a great alternative to our typical beef chili.

This deserves 4.5 stars in my opinion! LOVED this! I made it from my cabinets, without shopping extra. SO, had to make a few changes, either for personal taste (no mushrooms, I know, but no! And yellow & red peppers, no jalapeno (didn't have)! It was GREAT! LOVED the corn, don't usually add corn to chili, where've I been? lol. 
Didn't add the chicken broth as I like my chili a little chunkier rather than soupy like, and it was cooking up great without the extra liquid. The spices were just right! Thanks JANED!

Absolutely wonderful flavor.  I served it over couscous with a little grated cheese and we couldn't get enough of it.

This is a great recipe.  I did add some lentils to this as well.  However, I added on secret ingredient that put this over the top--a packet of hot chocolate mix.  Sounds wierd, but the chocolate and the little bit of sweet really set off the other ingredients.  I served this topped with cashews (also wierd, but once you try it you will be hooked!!), shredded cheese and sour cream and have even served it over rice.  This is staple party food at my house because it can feed a crowd and is SO tasty!!!

Very good recipe--a keeper.  Very flavorful.  Used canned, diced tomatoes, canned corn, and less cumin than it called for, and it was great.

Loved it, however, 1 TBSP of chili powder is not even close to enough. I think I put about 6 in.. I like spicy chili flavored chili! Yummy though... thanks!

I left out the chicken broth and used frozen corn and I didn't have a jalapeno pepper, so I added some ground cayene.  Also added some garlic. This was so good, I probably won't ever go back to chili with meat!  I served it with corn bread on the side. Even my husband, the meat eater, loved it!

I had only given this 4 stars before, but after making it a second time, I had to change my rating to 5 stars.  This time around, I started the onions before the other ingredients, so they were thoroughly cooked.  Then, while the onions were cooking, I chopped and added the remaining veggies in order.  After adding the corn, I let it simmer for 10 minutes.  Everything cooked perfectly.  I also added more tomato.  Unless you can find big plum tomatoes, I recommend using more than 6.  Delicious!

I made some changes and really loved the recipe. I omitted mushrooms, added one fresh jalapeno and one fresh cayenne pepper diced, doubled the chili powder and cumin, added cayenne powder and subbed veggie for chicken broth. When it was done cooking I took out 2 Cups of the chili and pureed it and added it back in with the rest to thicken it....YUM!!!

This was very good. I used mixed beans and all fresh veggies - the colors are so vibrant! I used an immersion blender instead of a food processor/blender which made pureeing much easier. It wasn't the best chili I've ever had, and I would be hard-pressed to say that it was better than the meat version, but it's worthy competition.

Eh. It was ok. People ate it. It was a LOT of veggie chopping for a pretty mushroomy chili in my opinion. I did use veggie broth instead of chicken, so that might have taken a little away from the taste.

I liked this soup - used all fresh veggies, but I didn't have corn so I added a can of red beans.  I don't like hot so skipped the jal pepper. I added a tbs of taco seasoning as it seemed like it was missing something...next time I'd skip the chili powder all together and use more taco seasoning (only because I don't need the heat). Don't skip pureeing - that is the best part!

This takes 40 min? I can never tell. I have so much fun making this, and usually, honestly, only do the 10 min part in the middle but then just add the other ingredients bring it to a boil, puree and ... Done! Love this! Cheese and crushed blue chips on the top. Easy, quick, delicious!

This is ridiculously delish despite being so easy you could probably prepare it with items you have on hand, blindfolded and wearing oven mitts. Make this. You won't regret it.

Super yummy! I made this several times and many of these times I didn't have all the ingredients ready: one time I skipped the corn, other times I put double qty of mushrooms because I had to use them, another time I used tomato paste instead of fresh tomatoes... Sometimes fresh, other times all frozen ingredients, it came out great every single time. It became a regular in our home. Thanks for sharing such a great recipe.

This is a good spicy recipe that has a lot of flavor.  I saute some ground turkey and then add all of the ingredients.  It makes it a meal with a little more protein.  Delicious and easy to prepare.

i made this today but it was a little too spicy for me. i omited the jalapeno pepper from the start, but did add(and i did teaspoon, not tablespoon) of red cayane pepper rather then the chili powder. that's all i had so maybe that was my fault to think i could replace it. anyway, i had to add more beans, another tomato and about another 3/4cup of chicken broth to make it bearable for my tastebuds. overall though i really liked it and would definetly make again, without the spice. one of my faves, and it's the first time i made chili.

Great even without garlic. I increased the veggie broth (instead of chicken broth).

Very so-so as far as chili's go.  My husband was very disappointed there was no meat in this recipe.  It was very bland and he added a lot of tabasco to spice it up.  I didn't touch the leftovers.

I loved this recipe!! I am a vegetarian so I changed the chicken broth to veggie broth and I thought it would be good to add in some veggie ground round which it was, it tasted just like real meat chili. I also changed the chili powder to cayenne pepper which made it much spicier ( if you want to do this I suggest 1/2 Tablespoon because a full tablespoon made it extremly hot).

I absolutely love this stuff but I really like Mexican food so if you're not one for mexican dishes I would not recommend this one.
I did not use the jalapeno in the dish either times because I found it to be spicey enough without it.  I used it over rice with cheddar cheese on top and tortilla chips for an added crunch and it was so good!  My husband liked it but he did not love it.

I think I added way too much chili powder to compensate for no cumin.warning if you're thinking of doing the same! It was great though not a total burst of flavors.

It was absolutely delicous!  I omitted the mushrooms.  I forgot to put the diced tomaotes in but it was still awesome!  I used dry beans (12 ounces) and put them in the pressure cooker with water to soften them up. Stabalized the pressure and cooked for 20 minutes.  Let it sit for 10 minutes and then removed beans from the pressure cooker. They grow to 32 oz of beans after the soak.    After that I just followed the instructions as listed.  Depending on how much stuff you put in there, you just adjust the amount of chicken broth.  I used 1 3/4 cups.  And I omitted the jalapeno pepper, its spicy enough as is.  Also added a little garlic powder and a bay leaf.  The puree step is definateley worth it, gives a very nice appearance.  (I just used my blender).

Great base. I used canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh, 1 can garbanzos and 1 can black beans, omitted the mushrooms, added frozen corn and fresh coined carrots, and once at the end I added browned ground turkey. It would be delicious with anything you add to it! The mushrooms just don't add much to it, they're not needed. And I love a lot of veggies.

This was a hit at a Halloween party last night! Based on fellow reviewers' recommendations, I made it two days in advance, which gave the flavors a chance to meld well. I used a 32 oz can of tomatoes, 1 can of corn, no mushrooms, and vegetable broth instead of chicken broth (I'm vegetarian). I left out the jalapeno pepper in lieu of 1 teaspoon of chili powder, which in and of itself gave it heat!! I can't imagine adding 1 TABLESPOON of chili powder to this dish (as the recipe says) without being near a fire station to extinguish the flames! :) Definitely be careful with the chili powder. Luckily, I had bread, sour cream, cheese, and green onions on hand to temper the heat. Delicious, and SO easy to make!

This chili recipe is fantastic. My only problem with this recipe is that we didn't make a double batch (it did not make 8 servings for us). You will not miss the meat at all if you make this chili. Thank you for a 'keeper' recipe.

This is so delicious! I made a batch and brought it to work for lunch and everyone was asking about it. They all wanted the recipe! It is a little on the spicy side but you can adjust the chili powder to suit your taste.

This is an awesome recipe.  I will admit that if you do not care for spicy hot, this recipe may be better if you leave out the hot peppers.

This recipe was really simple, and I thought it tasted good.  It made a great camping meal over the campfire.  Next time I would make sure that the portion I puree doesn't have any mushrooms in it, because the little flecks of pureed mushroom looked a little strange.

I made this recipe for a work-related fundraiser (30 servings), and it was a BIG HIT for the vegetarians, non-vegetarians, those counting calories, and those who liked a good-tasting alternative to meat chili. (I passed on the recipe and this website to many!) My family liked it the night we made it but it tasted better after it sat overnight.

This is my first time reviewing because I just HAD to write how good this was. This is really great as a vegetarian option with Vegetable broth! It was DELICIOUS! It was a bit spicy for my "Salt-is-spicy" tastebuds...but that's an easy change in spices!

I invited my carnivorous family over when I made this and got rave reviews!  This really is an excellent chili.  I made a few minor adjustments: I added 3 cloves of garlic, used frozen corn as fresh wasn't available and to save a couple bucks I used a large can of diced romas, drained and gave them a rough chop.  Also, as some of the reviews here have said the cumin is a little strong, but using a good pinch more of the chili powder really balanced it out.  The only thing I would do differently next time is add more mushrooms!

Very good chili.  I did use shredded chicken in place of the mushrooms and it went very well with this chili.  I did use canned corn and canned tomatoes (chili style)to make it easier.  I'll probably cook the peppers longer next time because they were a little to crunchy for my liking, but my family liked this chili.  I also added fresh cilantro...always a good addition!

Fantastic! I only have one minor suggestion: as you serve, garnish each bowl with a healthy dollop of sour cream and some freshly-chopped cilantro. It makes any chili! The cilantro has to be super-fresh, though. It starts to lose flavor as soon as you chop it, while the dried stuff is pretty much worthless.

This is absolutely a great recipe.  There is a lot of chopping to do, but well worth it.  I added a few garlic cloves, and then browned some hamburger and added it. Brought it to a boil, then transferred it to my slow cooker.  My husband loved it couldn't get enough.

We love this recipe because it has a chicken broth base versus tomato base.  I leave out the mushrooms and on occassion will add left over chicken meat.  Everyone asks for the recipe and it is always a hit!  I usually double the ingredients as it disappears all too quickly!

We liked it, but had to add more cumin, chili powder and jalapenos to get it as spicy as we normally like our chili. We also added some ground hamburger to make it into a meal, so we decided not to puree half of it.  I will definitely make it again as the weather gets colder. It's great comfort food - very filling!

We liked this chili very much - even my five year old ate it (I didn't cut back on the jalepeno or chili powder - we didn't find it too spicy at all).  I served it with cornbread on the side.  I think if I were to make this again, I'd use canned ingredients because it was VERY time consuming to use all fresh.  It did taste good though!

This was a good recipe.  Prepare to do a lot of chopping if you go with all fresh vegetables like I did.  I used half of the jalopeno pepper, but will probably use more next time.  I will probably use less chicken broth next time as well.  I tend to like it a bit thicker.

This was outstanding!  I even had to change it around a little, and it was so good.  I used canned tomatoes instead of fresh (2 14 oz cans) and omitted the mushrooms and jalepeno.  I added some chopped carrots and a dash of cayenne pepper.  I used frozen super sweet white corn, which gave it a delicious sweetness.  I didn't add any salt because of the canned tomatoes.  Served with a little bit of sour cream, some tortilla chips, and whole-wheat quesadillas.

I made this last night and we loved it.  I used diced tomatoes and canned corn like in previous reviews.  I didn't have a jalapeno pepper, so used 2 serranos instead.  I didn't think this was very spicy, so if you like it spicy, I would add some extry spices.  This will be made again in my house!

This recipe has potential to be a 5-star.  I feel it just needs a little tweeking.  I used canned mushrooms instead of fresh,  a can of tomatoes with green chilis instead of fresh romas, and a can of sweet crunch corn.  These are items that I keep stocked all the time.  I put the chili over corn bread instead of rice, as I didn't like the idea of rice and chili.  This recipe was loved by my whole family (including my 'meat and potatoes' father.)

I made it as a black Bean veggie turkey burrito. Eliminated the chicken stock and mushrooms. I took the suggestion to  add frozen corn and canned diced tomatoes/also diced my cooked slices of turkey breast which was in my freezer. Served it on a heated tortilla shell(microwave 30 seconds individually)shredded cheese on top.  I was feeding teenagers and so I didn't spice it up. They loved it. Healthy and good.

Good and good for you.  If you want it less soupy reduce the chicken broth by about 1/2 cup.  I used a can of corn.  Served this over mashed potatoes.  The prep time is longer than listed. Lots of chopping

Yum.  I served with cheese, sour cream, and rice in tortillas for a vegetarian burrito.  I'm looking forward to trying the leftovers simply as the chili.  Thanks for the recipe.  (Oh, and I used canned corn, and one can of diced tomatoes and one can of Rotel.  I also left out the mushrooms.  Was quite pleased with the results.)

How lucky to get this in my Allrecipes email of the day.  It is terrific! I followed another reviewer's advice and used 1 can diced tomatoes and 1 can diced tomatoes with green chilies, instead of fresh tomatoes. Didn't change anything else.  Can't wait to have it for leftovers.  I think it will taste even better.  Thanks!

This was quick and easy, both my husband and I loved it! To make it fit more closely into the "Vegetarian" category I used Vegetable Stock instead of Chicken Stock. Also, to kick it up a notch I added more chili powder. This is going to be a regular dish at our table.

This chili is a keeper!  I added some cooked chicken to the chili. This recipe is very versitile, it's a nice addition to eggs for breakfast and tasty filling for tortillas for lunch or dinner. If you have a craving for spicy lowfat mexican food - this one will fit the bill.

This is delicious...I made a few changes. I had 2 stuffed red peppers (recipe on this site) as well as 2 cups of extra stuffing so I used them. They had rice in them, as did the extra stuffing. I added the first 7 ingredients (minus the mushrooms as my daughter dislikes them) and sautéed them for 10 minutes. I then added the two stuffed peppers (chopped the peppers) as well as the extra stuffing and the vegetable broth and spices ad a can of tomato soup. Cooked for 10 minutes, pureed 2 cups and added back to the chile...FANTASTIC!

It was ok.  I didn't have bell peppers, jalapeno peppers, or mushrooms (it seemed weird to me to add mushroom in a chili anyway).  Despite using half a cup of garlic flavor chicken broth along with the regular chicken broth and adding minced garlic, it was kind of bland.  I ended up adding maybe a little too much salt to the final product.  Will make again with adjustments.

This is my favorite veggie chili recipe I have made so far. I admit, I was skeptical of mushrooms in a chili recipe but I really dug them, they kind of took the place of meat. Tasty and healthy, my kind of recipe! Thanks for sharing!

I'm a beginner when it comes to cooking, but I've made this recipe 3 times. I use frozen corn and canned beans as allowed in the recipe description. It turns out amazing and will always be one of my favorite dishes! I have yet to put mushrooms in the chili because I haven't had them on hand, but I look forward to adding them in the future. I love the beans' savoriness.

This was so delicious. The only thing I did differently was use vegetable stock and a tsp of garlic powder. It was then spooned on top of quinoa and garnished with sharp shredded cheddar, cilantro, and tortilla chips. It was flavorful and resembled a taco flavored chili. Very good!

I've made this so many times now I almost don't have to look at the recipe. This is THE BEST soup I have ever made. Its healthy and low calorie and DELICIOUS! I change some things to our taste like adding more jalapenos and using 1 red and 1 green bell pepper...we also usually use vegetable broth to make it vegetarian just to surprise people! People always say OH MY GOSH whats IN this?! Cook it. You'll love it. And you wont get fat. :) And btw its fine without the salt!

It's not a Texas chili as in greasy and beef - it's better. I'm picky so I left out the peppers and mushroom and added celery. I threw the vegetables in a food processor before cooking. Also, instead of chili powder - I used adobe chipotle peppers - great! Adds so much flavor and just the right amount of spice without overwhelming the rest. I also added 1 lb ground beef to stretch it further.

Very good chili recipe.  I followed the directions almost exactly except that I used baby portabello mushrooms (a good idea), and yellow pepper (no jalepeno).  Did not puree.  Served over brown rice.

This was delicious! My very carnivorous husband made it all the way through a bowl before looking at me, quite puzzled, and exclaiming that there was no meat! He then helped himself to another bowl. :) I made just a few changes: Substituted a can of green chiles for the jalapeno and used 2 cans of mexican spiced diced tomatoes instead of fresh. Yum!

I tweaked this recipe a bit and loved it! I replaced the mushrooms with a zucchini, and used a can of white kidney (cannelloni) beans and one of black. I also used one red bell pepper and one poblano. Finally, I simmered it for at least an extra 20 mins to thicken it and it turned out great. Even my 6 yrcold daughter loved it. I'll definitely make this again.

This recipe was sooo delicious. Best bean chili I ever ate! I spiced it up a bit more with some paprika, and I added some fresh cilantro near the end. The cilantro gave it a wonderful flavour. I also included celery and a can of red kidney beans with the other ingredients. I too was skeptical of the puree'ing part at first, but I found it really enhanced the texture. I pureed a bit more than what the recipe indicated. Thanks for the great recipe!

I have made this with fresh ingredients, as well as frozen and canned.  No  matter what, it is always amazing!  Hearty, healthy, and very filling. I've used a can of Rotel to take the place of the jalapeno if I don't have one. I can't say enough good things about this recipe!! I'd give it 10 stars if I could :)

This is, bar none, our favorite chili to make because it is so easy and colorful and delicious. I have made the following changes: an entire package of mushrooms, vegetable broth instead of chicken, skip the puree step (seems unnecessary), and use orange and yellow peppers instead of red. Sometimes I use green or red onions. That's the beauty of this recipe: you can really put your own twist on it!

Hip hip horray for healthy food.  The biggest change I made was to substitute an Anaheim pepper for the Jalapeno.  My daughter doesn't care for spicy food.  I used a lot more cumin and chili powder than called for and added a dash of Worcestershire sauce for more depth.  Because I was trying to hide the mushrooms (and the small zucchini I added) from my family, I sauteed them in a separate pan and used my immersion blender to turn them to paste.  I also blended one of the cans of beans and most of the tomato.  It was excellent.  I served it with a scoop of Corn Casserole (from this website) and a mixed greens salad. Thank-you Janed.

This was a wonderful recipe.  My 9 year old is such a picky eater and he loved it.  I made homemade cornbread to eat with it and what a great dinner.  I will definitly be making this again.

This was the best chili ever. It has just replaced my tradional chili recipe. I did add one can of Tomato soup, 1/2 pound of hamburger, (South Dakota is a beef producing state!), and replaced the jalopenos with canned green chili peppers. mushrooms, Good-bye kidney beans! We have always loved corn in a chili. I think I will enter this in next year's football Chili cookoff. I appreciated one readers addition of the Weight Watcher's point value.

Well with the mixed reviews on spicyness this I was surprised.  I had to add more jalepeno to increase it becuase I thought it needed more ummph!  Also I added some steak because I am a mom of 4 boys who crave it.  However for the vegetarians out there, use veggie broth and to thicken it instead of pureeing it You could add half a cup of wheat germ!

This is a great (and quick) recipe! I skipped the mushrooms and used extra hot Rotel instead of fresh tomatoes. It's so good over rice with a little sour cream.

I made this for my meat-eating family and they loved it! I used all fresh vegetables though, except I did cheat and use frozen corn. I added in 1 fresh diced green bell pepper (for color) and a generous amount of Frank's Red Hot Sauce. I would totally make this again.

Don't skip the last step! I only have a blender (no food processor) but trust me, pureeing half the soup makes all the difference!

I read the reviews before I made this recipe, and was looking forward to a nice pot of vegetable chili. Maybe I goofed along the way (no jalapeno, but subbed a shake of red pepper flakes). Used all fresh vegs including some corn on the cob left over from Fourth of July. That said, I don't get those reviews that said this was too bland. Mine was HOT!!! I like the combination of fresh vegs (I did use two red bell peppers and a big Creole tomato instead of Romas) but that last addition of black pepper pushed it over the edge for me. I'll ease back on the pepper and try it over rice next time. Thanks.

This was o.k. I would have liked more flavor.  I also thought all those peppers were a little too much.  If I make it again I will only use one bell pepper.  But my husband really liked it served over rice with a little shredded cheddar cheese on top.

As a new cook, this recipe was very easy to follow and turned out wonderfully.  My husbund absolutely loved this - and he typically does not eat vegetarian.  This is a great recipe to have for those days when your fridge looks a bit too empty - I made this recipe using all canned ingredients, with the exception of the peppers.  I will definitely make this one again.

Excellent!  I made it slightly less spicy by eliminating the jalapenos and decreased the cayenne so the kids would eat it.  They enjoyed it with bread and butter.

I thought this recipe was very good, but it definately needed some more spice.  I added a lot more chili powder and some cocoa powder.  I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes (next time I will use tomato sauce instead because my husband did not like the chunks), frozen corn, and used only one can of beans.  I also added hamburger.  I topped it off with some sour cream and cheddar cheese.  I served it with jalapeno bread with melted cheese on top.  Very good!!

Halved the recipe as was only cooking for 2 but wished I hadn't!  Can't cook without garlic so added 2 minced cloves.  Also mixed in some fresh cilantro just before serving which gave it that extra special something.

Very good and very easy.  A little too spicy for me though.  I think next time I'll cut back on the chili pepper.  I served it over cornbread and it was delicious.

This was my first attempt at making chili and it turned out great.  Loved everything about it.  Quick, Easy and very yummy.  My husband really enjoyed it too.  We topped it with some shredded chedder.  I will make this again!

Far too much cumin for my taste...just didn't like the flavor at all.  Will not be making it again...even lessening the cumin probably would not do it for me.

This chili recipe is AWESOME and SO EASY. I add a bit more salt and some sugar but the essentials are in the recipe. Fresh veggies make it taste great.

Used 15 oz can chopped diced tomatoes, with the juice, and it was a family hit. The spices worked for both non-heat and heat lovers. So it will go into our vegan dinner rotation. Served with vegan sour cream and scallions, once on rice and once on top of microwaved yams. Thank you!

This is excellent, have made it several times. Substituted 1.5 cups dried beans instead of canned. Doubled the cumin, chili powder, and salt.  Sometimes I add a pound of ground turkey which is delicious! I also reduced the broth and thickened with flour, starch or something else to save a little cleanup vs. pureeing some of the finished product and pouring it back in.

I've made this twice. Very flavourful. Easy to make. Substitutes ingredients easily i.e. frozen or canned corn, canned tomatoes can be used. Leftovers keep well. You can have it as spicy as you choose. I serve it over rice. A good way to use up not-too-past-their-prime fresh tomatoes and red peppers.

Good and thanks for sharing your recipe. I made a smaller amount, so opted instead of canned, use C&W Southwest Blend (black beans, corn, peppers, etc.) which worked out well. Next time, I'll swap ground turkey OR yellow and green zucchini for the mushrooms. We adore mushrooms, but found it a bit "odd" here.

This is the first recipe I tried on this website and it was great. Although I went off the rails a bit. All of the ingredients were there, but in different proportions. Instead of 2 bell peppers I used 4 and instead of 10 mushrooms I used 7. Still I really loved how simple this was!

i needed something that I could make without going to the store so tried this. We loved it. I didn't have anything fresh but cilantro, but the chili tasted delicious anyway. Canned beans and corn, frozen onions and bell peppers, canned tomatoes ... The most time-consuming part was opening the cans with my husband's Vietnam era John Wayne can opener! I plan to use the leftovers in tomorrow's breakfast, with a fried egg over top, or for lunch over a baked potato. This one is a definite keeper!

I made this recipe twice.  The first time it was so good I decided to double it the next time. My wife does not like mushrooms in  her chili, so I left them out and it was just as good. I used canned black beans and tomatoes (28oz can of chopped tomatoes) from Trader Joes along with fresh bell pepper and onion.  A surprisingly tasty and hearty dish considering the few ingredients and ease of preparation. Do not skip food processing  part of the soup.  It really adds something to the end result.

This was extremely simple.  I actually used 4 thinly cut  boneless skinless chicken breast since I had them on hand and they needed cooking. Next time I will double everything else or stick to the suggested two breasts. We found it very tasty but a bit too think with so much chicken. I recommend this recipe to everyone.

I successfully tried and used dried black beans that I soaked overnight, drained of the soaking water, rinsed and cooked according to "traditional" directions, using vegetable broth and water to generously cover the beans along with several dried bay leaves, a small chopped onion and 2 or 3 chopped garlic cloves for 1-2 hours or until the beans are tender.  The small container of Italian basil tomatoes was a perfect find in my cabinet as an addition to the chili mix and I used everything else listed here successfully; it was great! The chili was done in about an hour after combining the black beans, which I had first drained again,  with the sauteed onion, garlic and red pepper along with the remainder of the ingredients including equal amounts of vegetable broth and water to create a delicious chili.  Try adding a teaspoon or to taste of dried red pepper flakes for an extra-spicy taste that my family loves when assembling the chili additions.  Serve with hearty healthy brown rice and low-fat sour cream alongside grated sharp cheddar cheese.

Pretty good, but I thought something was lacking.  I added cilantro and it gave it more flavor.  Next time I think I will need to add some garlic.

Good recipe. A little bland, it needed salt. We added yellow bell peppers and pablanos in addition to the peppers called for and doubled the cumin. Served over rice and topped with vegan cheddar shreds.

absolutely delicious! i did not use a jalapeno, i just eliminated it -   i used 1 large can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh and 3 13oz cans of black beans, i bought the mushroom already sliced at the grocery store and just chopped them up a bit, i used vegetable broth and added an extra 1/2 tsp of salt - i put 2 cups to be pureed for thickening - it was fantastic on its own - my husband wouldnt wait for the rice to be ready or for me to grate cheese lol

I made a huge batch of this for an all-girl (plus one husband) D&D game and it was a hit! There wasn't a single bean left. I did add soyrizo, but I stuck to the recipe as-written otherwise. Since it's winter, I opted to use frozen vegetables and got the fire-roasted peppers and onions and the fire-roasted corn from Trader Joe's. It made the whole thing have an underlying hint of fire smoke. Thanks for the recipe!

Not a bad concept. It's certainly full of potential. For me, this recipe was bland. I left out the corn (which is nutritionally worthless) and used vegetable broth. 

Next time I'm adding more onion, doubling the spices, adding sweet paprika, cinnamon & mace. I'll definitely cut down the number of tomatoes too. I'm not necessarily looking for heat. Just depth of flavor.

UPDATE: I'm on to something. I made this again and did what I described above. It's much better. I'm almost there. Perhaps more salt . . .

This turned out so delicious! I added a clove of garlic and a quarter of a Pasilla chile pepper along with the other veggies. I also browned 1 pound of lean ground beef, drained, and stirred it into the chili. Everyone loved it!!! There were no leftovers.

Baby portobello mushrooms gives it a great umami and heartiness. Love it with fresh tomatoes and corn - and I've used canned in a pinch and it's still great.

This soup was excellent. Easy and best part is that you can make it out with canned ingredients. My personal touch was to add fresh cilantro when it was cooking. It boosted the flavor of the spices. I did not use the jalapeños because can't eat them. Will absolutely make it again!

I have a medical condition (IC) which makes many foods problematic . Any spice pepper --- white , red or black puts me in severe pain . We also had to leave out the chili powder . But even without those ingredients this" chili " was incredible .Our changes were to add in an orange bell pepper with the red and using a third of a medium green bell pepper in " place of " the jalapeño .  We cooked it for hours to let the flavors meld . I was so tempted to add barley and may do so next time . FYI for Novice Cooks ---- If you use dried black beans cook them till soft first .

This is an easy delicious dish, but a little too hot for my tastes, so I added a generous dollop of sour cream to the chili before serving.  Wonderful!  Next time I will cut back on the hot peppers, but otherwise, a great meal.

I used yellow peppers because that's what was available to me, added kidney beans, more jalapenos, removed mushrooms, and added crushed red peppers.  It turned out so well and spicy! This is a great recipe.

We (5 kids and I—hope there is enough left for DH) loved it.... It was easy to make, and it worked for soup, tortilla filling, or a salad topper.  The only change I made is that I omitted the peppers.

Turned out pretty good!  I added a can of chili with beans to it and it was quite a nice large serving for baked potatoes                  Two thumbs up!!

Kind of bland on flavor. Boiling the red bell pepper for so long made it mushy instead of giving this a little crunch. I’ll try tweaking it my own way next time.

This is delicious! I needed a vegan dish for a potluck, so thought I would try this one, and I absolutely loved it! The prep time took me nearly an hour as I wanted to use all fresh vegetables. I doubled the chili powder, per other reviews, and I thought the flavor was nice. It wasn't that spicy, but it was perfect for the potluck. Next time, I will add some cayenne to spice it up a bit. I used red, orange and green bell peppers, which made it very colorful. I also added more jalapenos. I omitted the mushrooms as I don't like them, but I really can't imagine using mushrooms in any chili dish. I provided some toppings of sour cream, grated cheese, cilantro, red onions and blue corn tortilla chips.

I'm so glad I tried this recipe! It's loaded with delicious veggies and flavor. I did use canned green chilies instead of the jalapeno (to reduce the heat a bit) and used only six sliced mushrooms (instead of quartered). Also, I used canned, peeled tomatoes (because it's winter). Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and it was outstanding!

Sorry but a little bland . Founds 2 ideas on line to and flavor to chili that was lacking. I would have never thought of it but it really worked to add richness, balsamic vinegar and 2 cans of anchovies, loved it!

This is a great chili!  I added 2 pounds of ground turkey and a small can of tomato paste. It was fantastic! I am diabetic, and when I read this recipe I was delighted to find I could eat everything in it. I will make this often!   Dave

This is my recipe, submitted years ago. Have found since that veggie broth makes the difference and add some chopped spinach at the end...yum. A house favorite for years and my go to recipe for church socials, too.

I made this recipe on a whim when I didn't have what I needed for something else.  I had almost everything I needed already, except the jalapeno, and I didn't use mushrooms because no one in the family likes them except me!  This was super simple and flavorful.  I will be making it again!

I loved this dish!! I didn't add the corn or the salt but otherwise followed the recipe and then adjusted the seasonings to my taste. I accidentally puréed more of the soup than I meant to but it still tasted amazing. I put it over rice and had it with some tortilla chips. Can't wait to have the leftovers tomorrow and look forward to making it again. It's simple to make, the most time consuming is chopping everything, but it was worth the prep.

Delicious as it was written. The only changes I made were using one green and one red pepper and canned mushrooms since that was what I had. It smelled great cooking and it was good to eat as well. I will make this again.

Made this chili as a heart healthy dish but left out the cumin and jalapeno pepper and added lean ground turkey because I made it for a friend newly recovering from heart surgery.  I used canned vegetables.  She served it over quinoa.  We both loved the recipe as did her husband who was afraid he was not going to be getting any good food after her surgery!  THis was a very filling, healthy and delicious chili and I will be making it again along with cornbread for myself.

I didn't have many tomatoes so I used three Roma tomatoes and 1 can of tomato sauce. I used pickled jalapeño and added 1 tabl of red crushed chili pepper. I used a slow cooker for 10 hours and we had a delicious dinner when we got home from work.

I've made this recipe once, then doubled it again and it is part of I make in bulk to eat every now and then. It doesn't require alot of ingredients or appliances or time and the taste is phenomenal and it is healthy. You can't go wrong. I didn't make any major modifications but threw in the whole can of corn instead. Also for the tomatoes I threw the canned organic diced tomatoes vs fresh, result is still amazing. yumm

This was a quick meal for my vegetarian daughter.  I was actually in the middle of frying onions for pirogi when stole some and started throwing this together because I didn't think the pirogis would be enough variety.  I had all the fixings (except mushrooms) already and I added Boca veggie protein ground crumbles (a terrific substitute for ground beef) and a can of Goya "red kidney beans in sauce prepared with olive oil, bell peppers and tomato" (that gives it a slight smoke flavor) as well as a can of black beans.   I used a large can of crushed tomatoes and "better than bouillon" vegetable bouillon paste/water (in place of salt and vegetable broth).   We had a huge, healthy pot of chili in no time.

I skipped the oil and salt, and used tomato stock instead of vegetable broth.  It was fantastic.  Making again today to bring to a friends.

Made it according to recipe except for the jalapeno pepper. Still, it was spicy enough for me. I think it lacked salt tho. Was not impressed and won't be making again.

This was my choice to make for the labor day picnic.  I just used my crockpot on low to heat all the ingredients together for about an hour.  I didn't have chili powder so I used chipotle seasoning.  I like spicy, but many do not, so I did not add the jalapeno.  Still delish with the chipotle spices!

I recently made the decision to stop eating meat and made this chili in my attempt to sway my meat-loving husband and teenagers to my way of thinking.  Well, it worked! They LOVED it. They ate seconds and thirds. I only made slight modifications to the recipe because of the limited ingredients on hand; I used canned tomatoes, eliminated the mushrooms and used 1 green pepper in lieu of 1 red pepper. We topped it with some guacamole and a little shredded cheese. DELICIOUS! I can't wait to have leftovers.

Instead of Roma tomatoes, used 2 cans diced tomatoes with or without  some chili powder  (OR for spicier: substitute one can with a can of  diced tomatoes with chilies). Left out mushrooms & jalapenos.  Served over rice that had been cooked in broth.  Loved it.  Very  healthy.

I thought this was far too simple for a flavourful dish;  I was wrong. I didn't include mushrooms and I did bump up the spices, adding a little dried cilantro, powdered cumin, bit of curry and coriander, and some Aleppo flakes. You can play around w the spice combo to suit;  the key is the combo of textures and flavour and I'd really recommend the purée of that cup and a half of soup then  returning it to the pot...nicer, denser texture. Def a redo. Everyone enjoyed it

It's delicious. I am super duper allergic to mushrooms so i swapped it out for lean ground turkey. i suppose chickpeas would have worked just as well! I made some seasoning adjustments - i added salsa about two tablespoons for the extra kick, some chili pepper flakes and paprika. about a tablespoon of minced garlic. I topped it with guacamole and sour cream and colby jack.

Never thought veggie chili could be so good! Made a double batch for a large group at a ski house. Using some of the other reviewer's suggestions, I added more jalapeno and chili powder, used diced canned tomato instead of fresh, and added the juice from 2 limes. Man, this had a nice kick and was so tasty!

This is one of my favorite veggie chilies. My changes are based on ingredients on hand. I only had a green pepper on hand, so used one. I used more mushrooms as I try to include a lot of mushrooms in my diet. I did not have fresh tomatoes so used 2 cans of diced.  Only change I will make next time is to use LESS chili powder. The kick was a bit too intense for me.  I like to serve it with grated cheddar and/or sour cream. Crushed Tortilla chips are a nice touch as well. I will try the suggested rice another time. I am sure I will like it that way as well. A quick to make meal that is yummy and healthy.

Yummy! Used 2 orange peppers instead of red, 9 tomatoes, 1/2 t pepper, 1 1/2 T chili powder. Next time I think try without the broth or with much less... it was very thin.  But still delish! Kids ate it plain but I put it over quinoa.

Excellent chili for a vegetarian. Easy to make and honestly tastes just like real chili! My daughter doesn't like corn, so I substituted the corn for chick peas.

SOOO good!! I am a college student and I made like 18 servings so I can eat this for the next week or so, and I used all canned vegetables, and the leftover veggies from my fridge. I omitted the mushrooms and used chili peppers (2 tsp) instead of chili powder which was the perfect amount of spice for me (1 tbsp = 8 servings sounds like  a lot of chili powder...). Hearty and delicious, super easy chili recipe too if you don't have a crock pot

My family loves this chili. I do add ground turkey to give it more protine. I also add a couple tbs of Chia seed, it gives it a thicker sauce and added health benefits.

Not bad! Prep was tedious but the rest was super easy. It was tasty but missing "something". I served it over rice with cheddar. The worchestire sauce may have been a good idea.

Loved it.  The only thing I did different was I left the corn out because I don't particularly like it in chili and I added vegetarian crumbles (like ground beef) and substituted green chilies for the jalapeno pepper because I didn't have any in stock right now. I topped it with shredded Monteray Jack cheese, chopped onion and sour cream and served it with fresh baked French Bread and it was great. Thanks for the recipe!

Hmm.  I thought this was just okay.  I'm beginning to think that I don't really like black bean soups.  Hubs thought it was decent, but a little too spicy.  I think with less spices, he'd be fine with it.  For some reason, me not so much.  I did cut down the mushrooms and put in some sliced, canned ones for hubs (I don't like mushrooms).  I didn't have corn and although I'd planned on getting some on my way home, I didn't end up stopping bc I was running late.  Maybe I'll try again and experiment with the ingredients.  Thanks for the recipe!

No corn this time, but big chunky bites of all the other vegetables. After browning the meat I put everything in a slow cooker and three hours later it was still a little soupy but DELICIOUS, so I thought maybe I shouldn't have added the extra can of tomato sauce!! HOWEVER the next morning the chili had thickened perfectly. Now the family has dinner and lunch for a couple days! Great cold weather recipe!

Very good vegetarian meal.  Didn't miss not having meat.  Sub vegetable broth if chicken broth is an issue.  I served this over wild rice.  What a tasty, healthy meal.  I will make this again! Thanks for posting!

Just perfect!!!  Only changes I made were to add a couple more cans of black beans and used one whole small (14 oz.) can of chicken broth.  I just simmered it down for a couple hours or however long until it got to the consistency I like.  I didn’t bother pureeing any of it.

Great!  I made some changes.  I didn't sautee the veggies because I used the crockpot.  I just dumped everything in the crock pot.  I used canned corn.  I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes instead of fresh.  As directed, I pureed 1.5 cups, but later I ended up pureeing another 2 cups.  Without pureeing this is a soup recipe.  When you puree, the dish thickens up and becomes chili.  Next time I would probably puree at least 4 cups.  I cooked it on high for 4.5 hours.  This turned out great!

This was not bad.  I like the addition of the mushrooms to add a meaty texture.  There were a couple of changes I made due to not having all the ingredients.  I used less tomatoes, added red pepper flakes instead of the jalapeno, and added water with a tablespoon of tomato pasta for the broth.  If I make this again I will used veggie broth to make it vegan.  Not a bad recipe.  It will be better tomorrow as it sits and the flavors meld together.

This may be my favorite dish so far! My 9 yr old loves it. We're vegetarians, so I had to make a substitution for the ckn broth. We used ckn style vegetable bullion and it's so delish!! We also use canned corn to make it easier. Otherwise, I follow the recipe exactly and it's fabulous. Thank you so much

Yum Yum... THis is a great recipe. I am a mother of two and watch two other children during the day... I was able to whip  this up in 15 minutes w minimal clean up. I omitted the mushrooms and jalapeno. I suggest taking the time to blend some of the mixture, it makes a HUGE difference in flavor. Otherwise it is kinda a sloppy salsa consistency and lacks the blended flavor a simple dish like this needs. I think it is best fresh because the veggies are still slightly crunchy. THIs is a keeper!!

This was delicious and we liked it chunky. Did not have any cumin so added other spices. I added green bell peppers too. Only added chopped jalapenos on side for those that like them but it really made the chili. Served it over rice. My husband asked for seconds.

It was delicious and very healthy. I didn't change the recipe except that I soaked and cooked black beans. Next time I will have to puree a cup of the chili. Otherwise, it is not creamy enough. I had the chili with a tortilla, and it was really good.

This is a healthy and delicious meal, but it is time consuming due to all the chopping. I used less chicken broth and added more garlic powder. I also added a small can of tomato sauce to thicken the chili. Definitely puree the 1 1/2 cups of soup. It makes a huge difference.

I liked this chili.  I used less than a can of chicken broth and added about 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder.  Don't forget to drain black beans, and definitely do the puree thing.

I'm not sure if I did something wrong or not, but I found the spices in this recipe to be overpowering. My boyfriend and I both had watery eyes by the time we were through with a bowl of it! I made the following adjustment, per the suggestion of another user: used one can diced tomatoes in place of fresh roma, and one can Rotel in place of the jalapeno (to add more tomato and add just a little more kick). I think I will make this again, but next time I will drastically reduce the amount of pepper and chili powder I add to it. Overall, I think this is a delicious recipe and I will definitely make it again. Next time I am going to add another can of black beans (because we love them so much), and a shredded rotisserie chicken. Also, definitely try to puree some of it if you can - this really adds to the texture!

Good, hearty chili that is a hit every time!  I have made this several times and like to serve it over rice or couscous - both are good - and sprinkle a little cheese over the top.

I liked feeding this to my family because it is so healthy.  However, I found it needed a little more zip.  So I added a few spices of my own.  And YUM!

I thought this chili was very good, and my husband said it was one of the best vegetarian chilis he has ever eaten. It is more soupy than a regular meat chili, so if you want it to be thicker, use only half the chicken/veggie broth. Also, I only used half of one bell pepper, as I do not like too much bell pepper. All the other spices and amounts were fine - a nice burst of flavor in each bite! We will definitely be making this again.

Great stuff!  I took the advice of others and used two cans of Del Monte mexican spiced tomatoes.  And since the people I'm cooking this for aren't big mushroom fans, I took them out to put on the side after it was done cooking.  Excellent recipe.  I'll definitely make this one again!

This was soooo good!  Not only does it look pretty, but it tastes fantastic! Fresh and spicy as my husband and I both like it. Of course if you want it mild you just omit the hot peppers. I followed the recipe as directed and used only fresh ingredients and wouldn't change a thing!  I was so hooked on the taste that I ate it all day long and was wanting more when it was gone.
