This sauce is wonderful! I did make a few changes - less butter, some olive oil, and I added some fresh dill. However, instead of frying the fish and using the sauce on top, I placed the raw fish fillets in the sauce in a baking dish, and baked it for about 25 minutes at 350 degrees. It was sooo good!

The sauce for this dish is excellent. I did not use breadcrumbs for the fish. I assumed that breadcrumbs would become soggy with the sauce, so I pan fried the fish until crispy. You could probably grill or broil the fish also. I cut the butter in half (1/2 cup), tripled the garlic, cut the broth in half, kept the wine, lemon, and everything else the same. Corn starch thickened it up nicely and lots of capers made this dish wonderful. Thanks.

The basic flavors in this recipe are really good, but the proportions seem to be a little off. I did not bread the sole before frying it because I thought the addition of the sauce would make it soggy. The sauce itself is good, but I took others' suggestions and halved the butter (I actually quartered it, using 1/4 cup butter and then used 1/4 olive oil), and used 1/2 cup white wine as well. I also doubled the amount of lemon, added a 1/4 cup of parsley, then added some drained capers before thickening the sauce with some cornstarch. After all the modifications, the result was VERY yummy (and I'll make it again), but since so many modifications were needed, I'm only giving it 3 stars. I agree with other reviewers that after modifications, it would be really good on other fish and seafood (I'm thinking shrimp).

This was yummy!  I lightly breaded the sole filets and pan fried them rather than deep frying (I never deep fry!).  I used 1/2 cup of butter, omitted the broth, and used the other ingredients as written.  After boiling it for several minutes the sauce had thickened enough for my tastes.  I like thin, lemony butter sauces, rather than something heavy and thick so this recipe (with a few tweaks) suited me well.

Nice presentation!  I have to reduce the amount of sauce (way too much) and thicken it with corn starch or flour.  I also add more garlic, and reduce the amount of butter used.  I like to flavour the bread crumbs with grated parmesan and paprika.  Tastes wonderful.

This was pretty good. The sauce should certainly be halved, and the butter further halved. The fish can also be pan fried.

The sauce in this recipe was great, I did do as mentioned and added extra garlic (2 extra cloves) and 2T corn starch. Also I baked the sole rather than frying with no breading either. Next time will use a hardier fish. I used the left over sauce (we had a lot) to make a whole other dish. We took a pkg of linguini and a pkg of 90 count shrimp, and tossed the shrimp and pasta with the sauce, and topped with diced sun dried tomatoes. That was excellent.

This was a super suace and like others have said is great with differant kinds of fish - I used it on halibut tonight - I also halved the butter, increased the wine and garlic and added 1T cornstarch mixed in w/ c. broth at the end to thicken it up to a hollandise-like consistency. 
I would reccomend tho, cut the entire sauce recipe in half - its way too much for 4 fillets of fish.
But again super super yummy recipe - thanks!

This sauce is AMAZING!!  It tastes like something you'd get in an expensive restaurant!  We make it with all kinds of fish and pour it over the fish, rice and veggies.  I only wish I could give it six stars!

Very good and aromatic!  My kids couldn't get enough of it.  Will definitely make it again.  Although I would add 1-1/2 T. cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  Great recipe!!!

This sauce was restaurant quality! I kept the ratios as written, but cut the recipe in 1/4 and it made plenty of sauce for the two of us. Incredibly easy to make, with terrific flavor. I used 1/4 c butter, 1/4 c chicken broth, tbls lemon juice, tbls white wine, and a clove of minced garlic. No salt or pepper needed for us. Served over pan seared tilapia and pollock with brown rice for a side. I would serve this to guests I wanted to impress!

The sauce was really good. I did the same as the reviewer before me and baked the unbreaded  fish in the sauce in the oven. The only thing I would do differently next time is add some cornstarch because I prefer a thicker sauce, but it tasted great and both my husband and I loved it. I will definately make this again.

A little too garlicky and tart for me.  Next time I will cut back on the garlic and lemon.  Otherwise, very yummy and worth making again!

This review is for the sauce only and I think it's pretty good. Since it makes so much I, too, cut the amounts in half and cut back even more on the butter. Some Old Bay instead of salt and pepper and, because of personal preference for a thicker sauce, cornstarch makes this just what we were looking for. Thanks for posting it.

I used the sauce part of this recipe and it was perfect.  We had some cod left in the freezer that we caught this summer and I used 4 filets.  I didn't dip them in egg or breadcrumbs but poured the sauce over them in a baking pan.  I reduced the butter to a little less than half and poured a small amount of olive oil in.  Everything else I kept the same.  I baked at 350 for 25 minutes and poured some of the sauce over brown rice.  YUM!

Yummy! Fried the sole in butter (2T) instead of oil, then made the sauce in the pan, using another 2 T of butter with the wine, lemon juice and 1/4 c chicken broth. Mmmm....

With the modifications that other reviewers suggested this was terrific.  Cutting the butter in half also makes it healthier...an added bonus.  I used frozen fillets from Costco and this sauce made them taste like a gourmet dish.

The sauce is excellet!  I only made half and it was plenty.  Also took others suggestions and added cornstarch which I think definitely improved it, but it would taste great without too.  I didn't fry the fish, just baked at 350 for 10-15 minutes with sprinkled breadcrumbs.  Thanks for the recipe!

I agree with others, sauce was very good. I pan fried my fish and to the residual oil, I added a stick of butter and finished the sauce as written. I did add some cornstarch to thicken it. Served with broccoli and the sauce was good with that as well. Added to recipe box for the sauce....

I have no idea what I did wrong (maybe my taste buds are on the fritz due to the fact I'm preg) but I didn't like the butter sauce at all. No matter how much I played around with it, it was horribly salty, acidic and sour. I ended up using a slotted spoon to scoop up the minced garlic, and topped the fish with that. Oh well, thanks anyway!

This recipe was yummy. The only reason I gave it a four out of five is because the recipe made too much sauce. I halved the recipe because I was cooking for two and I halved the sauce and it was still too much. None the less though it was delicious and very light.

OK, right up front I have to confess that I only used the butter sauce from  this recipe, and I combined it with another seafood dish.  So my rating is for the sauce only.  This butter sauce is BEAUTIFUL!  It is just garlicky enough, and the lemon and chicken broth proportions are perfect, IMHO.  I did make one change:  I used half butter, half olive oil, to reduce the sat. fat.  It was incredible. This would be the perfect base for shrimp or scallop scampi.  In fact, I'm going to try that!  HIGHLY recommend.

Wonderful! The sauce is also nice on top of mashed potatoes which you can use as a side dish for the fish. Perfect! Thanks for sharing.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was wonderful. Next time I will add more garlic and cut the sauce recipe in half as it made lots. I also thickened the sauce with cornstarch. I didn't use that much oil, just some in the bottom of a big pan and it worked fine.

The "creamy" sauce was much too thin to be called creamy.  Maybe add real cream next time?

I used peanut oil to fry the fish and cooking sherry because I had no white wine. It was delicious! I let everyone put what sauce on it as they wanted.

Turned out great!  I didn't deep fry though, just a bit of olive oil and pan fried.

We really enjoyed this. I didn't have lemon juice, but I did have garlic lemon pepper and used is liberally. I added it to butter and the bread crumbs, along with a bit of Spanish paprika. Oh, and I followed other suggestions to thicken the butter sauce with 1 tsp of corn starch and 1 Tb water. Keeping this one for whatever fish I have on hand.

This was great! I gave it 4 stars because I tweaked it a little. I added salt and pepper to the egg for more flavor on the fish itself. I only used 7 tbsp of butter, minced garlic instead of cloves, only a splash of white wine, 1/2 cup of broth, and real lemon lemon juice instead of an actual lemon.I also thickened the sauce with cornstarch. I still had way more sauce than I needed but it was so good and quick!

Too much butter! We cooked the sole in the butter per the recipe, but there was way too much left to pour even more over the top. Otherwise a tasty dish, very good with mashed potatoes as someone suggested.

The sauce made the breadcrumbs mushy and over all not a great sauce, actually, not like a sauce at all, sauces have a thicker consistency than water.

My husband loves to buy these bags of frozen pollock.  He boils the fish and dips it in melted butter - very bland.I'm always looking for new things to do with this fish.  Well, this recipe was great ;)  I followed the advice of some of the other reviews and added 2 tbsp flour (and extra garlic).  This was the BEST the pollock ever tasted!

Well go figure!!  I thought this recipe was terrific.  I did alter a few things...not as much oil & I did add a teaspoon or two of flour to the sauce to thicken it just slightly.  My "picky" husband even loved it and we've already had it for dinner twice now!

I have passed this recipe on to my daughter and a co-worker & they too thought it was very tasty.

Thanks Karolin for the recipe!!

Sorry, but I thought this was terrible. Sole is too delicate to stand up to fried bread crumbs. Maybe a thicker fish like tilapia would work. The "sauce" was thin, greasy and bland. Even with corn starch to thicken it up it was a bomb. One day later and I still have a stomach ache.
