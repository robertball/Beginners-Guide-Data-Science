Excellent recipe.  I agree that there are too many raisins.  I modify the recipe a bit by adding less raisins, more apple (chop it really small so it holds together better) and oatmeal and add a touch of cinnamon for flavor.

It was a great health cookie.  I changed a few things.  I only put in 1 cup of raisins.  I added 1 medium apple, peanut butter instead of butter, added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/4-1/2 C of chocolate chips.  I baked 1/2 of the batch right away and then waited 8 hours for the rest.  I recommend cooking them right away.  Otherwise they tasted dry and blah.  Also I flattened them into patties before baking.  Even with adding the chocolate chips it was less sugar over all than your typical cookie.  I loved it.

We really enjoyed these cookies. Since there's no added sugar, I feel good giving them to my toddler as a snack and she just gobbles them up. I also did 1 C. raisins and that was more than enough. I added 1 t. cinnamon and 1/2 t. nutmeg, which added some extra flavor.   I'll do a touch more cinnamon next time. I didn't chill the dough for eight hours, either.  I put the bowl of dough in the freezer for about 10 minutes while the oven preheated, and then put it back in the freezer while each batch baked.  They took exactly 12 minutes per batch and were nice and soft.  I think I'll also try grating the apples with a box grater next time to save the chopping time.

These cookies are good. I followed the previous suggestions and added less raisins. When cooking make sure you spread out the raisins in the cookies. If you try to make sure you have a raisin in each bite, they taste better. The texture is different than "regular" cookies but they are good. My husband and next door neighbor even liked them and they typically hate low sugar/no sugar products.

This recipe would be more enjoyable if it had less raisins.  There is very little to hold it together.

These are great!  I only used 1 cup of raisens & the whole apple chopped, which was probably closer to 1 cup than 1/2.  Used 1/4 cup Smart Balance & 1/4 cup Canola Oil.  Used Whole Wheat flour instead & added 1 tsp Cinnamon, 1/2 tsp Nutmeg & 1/2 tsp NOW liquid Stevia (good brand).  Put in a full cup of chopped walnuts.  Made it a delicious & healthy cookie for my 2 & 3 yr olds....they loved 'em!  (hubby, too!).

I skipped the chilling and poured hot apple-raisinmixture over dry ingredients. I had to bake cookies over half an hour,  but that taste... Yum. Nutty and enough raisins, and i used about a cup of apples (harvesting going on). Next time I could try to add cardamon or cinnamon, and probably use more oat flakes (and a little it less flours). I've already frozen chopped apple to be used in these cookies and muffins.

My father isn't anyhow fond of low-sugar cookies, but I didn't mention anything about the sugar in these and he really praised . :)

These were okay, but I definitely think cinnamon, nutmeg and/or cloves are needed, as others mentioned, in order to improve the taste. I also used less raisins based on the other reviews. I'll make them again but with the added spices.

these cookies are great (well I added cinnamon and nutmeg)... plenty of raisins, which is good since they are called "Raisin Cookies" Definitely a keeper. Tastes like eating a bowl of oatmeal!

These were really good for having no sugar in them. My kids loved them! I only rated in 3 stars however because there are some changes i made, and some additional changes I would make. I reduced the raisins to 1c, and added a whole cup of finely chopped apples. I also added about 2tsp of cinnamon. Next time I make these, and it will be soon, I am adding dried cranberries along with the raisins and also replacing the water with unsweetened apple juice.

I am pregnant and really watching my sugar intake. These were wonderful and a surprise. I expected them to be bland, but instead they were yummy and tasted like raisin oatmeal. My teenagers gobbled them, my husband loved them and my toddler also thought they were yummy. Great recipe, thank you.

I ended up making these with all apples instead of raisins and a generous amount of cinnamon by the suggestion of other reviewers. These are AMAZING and I'm not usually one to like no-sugar sweets. I think maybe next time I'll add all-natural apple juice instead of water and a bit more cinnamon, nutmeg, and ground cloves.

Did not like these cookies at all - they reminded me of fruitcake.

Really good granulated-sugar-free cookies. They turned out really well with only one cup of raisins. Next time I might try running the raisin-apple mixture through a food processor before adding to the dough, because I thought the little sweetness as it is was very unevenly distributed by using the raisins whole. But I'll definitely try it again.

Very yummy, especially 1 day later!  I would recommend calling these something other than "cookies" because they do not taste like cookies - they are more like muffins or just a hearty snack.  I changed the recipe by using peanut butter (freshly ground so no sugar) instead of butter, using 2 small apples, 1 fresh banana, and extra spices, and more vanilla.  I cook them in muffin pans which creates a good shape.  Also, I did not refrigerate the dough before baking.  These taste great and are very satisfying!

I always find regular cookies way too sweet.  My husband is diabetic so I thought I would give this recipe a try.  I did not wait 24 hrs to make these.  I think maybe the flavours would blend better if I had.  I cut the raisins down to 1 c as suggested.  I also added about 1/2 c unsweetened coconut and a sprinkle of salt to pull out any natural sweetness.  They were okay.  A bit floury tasting.  I am hoping of they sit a bit they will be better.  I might try again with apple juice rather than water as another suggested.

Awesome! I followed other reviewers suggestions and used 1 cup raisens, 1 whole apple, chopped small, and 1/4 t. Cinnamon. I also boiled raisen/apples a few minutes longer. Baked about 15 minutes. Made 3 dozen. I will definately make again.
