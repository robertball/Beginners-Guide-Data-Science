I have so much fun with this recipe we have renamed it "Surprise Cookies".  The possiblilities are as limited as your pudding, chips, and imagination. Variations I have tried are choc. pudding + choc chips, choc pudding + peanut butter chips, lemon pudding + chocolate chips, vanilla pudding + raspberry chips, butterscotch pudding + butterscotch chips (our favorite).  Just try whatever crosses your mind!  As far as spreading out, I increased the flour to just a little more than 2 1/2 cups.  Also, use stick margarine and NOT the soft spread type as they have way too much oil and water.

I made 10 dozen for an event at my 14 year old daughter's school.  She said the boys declared they were the best cookie they'd ever had (you know it's important what the boys think).  I used vanilla pudding and excluded the nuts.   A definite winner.

Incredible!  I must say, I was wondering what all the fuss was about, but after trying them, I quickly found out!  I made 3 batches:  lemon pudding with white chocolate chips, vanilla pudding with butterscotch chips, and butterscotch pudding with milk chocolate chips.  Both were exceptional!  I omitted the nuts in both recipes, and increased the baking time to 11 1/2 minutes (because they were so "cake like" that they fell apart).  Perfect adjustment!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Everyone loves these cookies. I've tried so many different variations: 
Cheesecake with cinnamon chips 
Butterscotch with butterscotch chips
Pistachio, Lemon, Vanilla, Coconut Creme, Chocolate, Banana creme, Chocolate-Butterscotch combination, Banana creme-Coconut creme combination.
My favorite so far is the banana creme -replacing the vanilla flavoring with maple and adding a teaspoon of cinnamon.

I used vanilla pudding with a 12-oz. pkg. of semi-sweet morsels and a 10-oz. pkg. of Skor toffee bits; I did not use nuts because my kids aren't thrilled about them in their cookies.  They turned out delicious, but they spread a lot and I'm not sure why.  I ended up with exactly 36 cookies, so I don't think I made them too big.  I did roll them into balls instead of dropping them, but I don't think that matters.  Maybe it's my cookie sheets.  Anyway, they sure are yummy.  Thanks Sue!

These cookies are wonderful!   The crispy outside and chewy inside are just what I love. {I do not recommend saving any dough for later baking.  The cookies will not rise and look as pretty.}  As for leftover cookies....they will be just as good the second day....crispy and chewy.  Can make these cookies with full confidence.

These cookies are the favorite of my family and my in-laws.  I use a 1 cup shortening instead of butter and omit the nuts.  I also use only a half a bag of chips.  I've only had them turn out wrong once and that was the second time baking them.  Its take a little getting use to the dough, but they cookies are always wonderful.

Fantastic!  I've used different puddings and chips and these always come out well.  Chocolate pudding and PB chips are always popular, as is lemon pudding and white chips.

I have made these cookies about 4 or 5 times now. I use chocolate pudding instead of butterscotch. Let me tell you, these are scrumptious. My mom and my husband keep asking me to make them again. I think these are the "cookie" if you catch my drift. =)

If you think cake made from a mix with canned frosting on it tastes really good you'll probably like these cookies. They're very soft and cake-like and have an artificial taste due to the instant pudding. They don't have the texture I think chocolate chip cookies should have, but some people obviously like them. For incredibly thick, chewy, big chocolate chip cookies that knock these out of the water, check out the "Best Big, Fat, Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookie" recipe. Those have all natural ingredients and are the pinnacle of chocolate chip cookie perfection!

I had high hopes for these but I didn't like how fake and cakey they were, just tasted like bad cookies - my roommate said "do these even have butter in them?"  Not a good sign for a cookie with 2 sticks of butter to not taste buttery and delicious. I may try again with a different pudding but they just lacked flavor...maybe cinnamon/more vanilla would help?

These cookies were delicious!! I substiuted m&m candies instead of the chocolate chips and I used vanilla pudding. I rolled the dough into 1 inch balls and the recipe made 41 cookies. I will make this recipe again changing up the chips and pudding. Thanks for the great recipe :-)

This is the same recipe I have always made; actually it is the same recipe that is printed on the back of the JELL-O pudding box...

Cookies turn out best when dough is chilled in the refrigerator for about an hour. Separate layers with parchment paper or they will stick together. These cookies are addicting!

Love these cookies! I did change it to 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  Do not let these overbake, even if they look like they are not done yet.

Very good recipe. I didn't add any sugar, there's enough in the chocolate and the pudding, and baked for 13 min.

Best chocolate chip cookies I have ever tasted...I use vanilla pudding instead of butterscotch...but I think just about any combo of pudding/chips would be good. I want to try chocolate pudding with peanut butter chips. I also don't cook them for as long so they are super soft

I made these cookies today, and froze the for Christmas, leaving a few out for my husband's opinion. WE both loved these cookies, and i plan on making them again. They will be one of the cookies that are on my christmas baking list everyyear. I used vanilla instant pudding, and chocolate chips to make these cookies. I may experiment with another flavor of pudding next time.

Easy, moist and chewy. Good cookie, but I think I'd add 1/2 t salt next time. I made them with vanilla and M&M's in half the batter and Reese's PB cups in the other half. Both were good!

I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I hope someone can help me. I've been baking for a while and know I measured everything right and had the oven where it needed to be. I had to have missed something because these came out so thin that there were holes in them. They taste fabulous though. I just wish they were puffy like a real cookie!

These are absolutely fantastic!!!  I took them to a family BBQ and all cookies were gone quickly!  I live at high altitude and added 2 and 1/3 cups of flour.  I also baked at 350 for 7 minutes and they came out perfectly!

Great cookies, followed recipe to a t and they were great. Maybe a little TOO moist, absolutely not crunch to them... but really good. Seems like a lot of choc chips and nuts, but trust me, they're perfect.

These were great, I used Pistachio pudding mix, and added dried cherries in place of the walnuts to make a "spumoni" cookie. Loved them!

I tried these with vanilla pudding and everyone liked them but they were crispy and not cake-like like the recipe said. I had to bake them at 400F for about 15 minutes because my oven always takes ages to cook/bake. I also added a little less butter (little more than 1/2 cup) and it turned out great. But pretty crispy. Does anyone know how I can make them softer?

Wow!  I made this recipe with my students to teach measuring and sequence.  Everyone was beyond impressed with my first batch (banana cream and chocolate chip, no nuts).  The second batch was mediocre (vanilla pudding and choco chips).  Everyone was so blown away by the first batch though that I plan to make these next week for our class party and again for christmas and try different flavors!

I followed someones suggestions to use 2 1/2 cups flour instead and i think that helped.

Really awesome cookies.  I used less butter, as some suggested, and vanilla pudding.

These are definitely the best cookies I have ever had.  I made them for Christmas, used one bag of chocolate chips and one bag of green & red M&M's with vanilla pudding.  SO GOOD.. thank you!

I grew up with this recipe.  It's absolutely my favorite cookie recipe.  So easy and versatile.  My favorite flavor is the pumpkin pudding you can get at Christmas and chocolate chips.  I have also used cheesecake pudding and chopped dried cherries.

I have a recipe similar to this one (mine doesn't use regular sugar, just brown sugar, and no vanilla) but every time I make them with chocolate pudding - they are a crowd pleaser! My husband was raving about them at work so I've decided to buy all sorts of pudding flavors and different chips to mix and match. Should be good fun! :)

Turned out great! Only word of caution, I did find they spread a lot while baking. Not a big deal, but worth knowing :)

Superb in taste!  They tasted fabulous and we are going to use them for a bakesale.  The reason I am only giving this 4 stars, though, is because they were MUCH to greasy!!!  My hands were shining and I had to add about 1/3 cup more flour and they were STILL greasy!  I would reccomend half of the butter, if that, because I found that I had to bake them a bit longer.  Good recipe, though.  Only problem was the butter.

Unless you really like the taste of instant pudding don't bother!  I thought the pudding ruined the taste.....I'll stick with the original chocolate chip cookies recipe!

I have been making this recipe for years using either vanilla pudding or chocolate pudding.  Everyone requests that I make these cookies any time I bring a dessert.  I do double the chocolate chips but may try the toffee bits that one user mentioned.

When baked in a dessert/bar pan, these make for fabulous blondies. (Which was exciting for me because I've been on a hunt for the perfect blondie recipe.) I followed the recipe exactly, except I used half brown sugar and half white sugar. To me, they did not taste like butterscotch, but the butterscotch pudding did give him a delicious kick. Definitely planning on making this my default chocolate chip cookie recipe from now on.

Good cookies I used vanilla pudding and added coconut, but they pretty much just tasted like any other cookie I've made without the pudding mix, I couldn't really taste the vanilla pudding flavor. I also needed to add about a cup more flour to get the batter the right consistency, they came out soft not cakey at all.

Delicious!  These cookies were a huge hit at work. The whole batch was gone in minutes! I recommend increasing the vanilla extract to at least 1 tablespoon for more flavor and refridgerating the dough in between batches makes the dough easier to work with. Definitely try it with other flavors of pudding for something new!

I like to bake cookies because I am not a fan, hence, I don't eat them.  But, this recipe intrigued me.  I made it, I tasted, and I ate 4 cookies in about 4 minutes!  These are awesome.  They are soft and chewy and really good.  I used vanilla pudding and made the recipe as is - with no nuts.  Wow.  I am keeping this one!

This recipe is great!  Every time I make it, I get requests for the recipe.  The only thing I do different is add 2 Tablespoons of extra flour.  It doesn't sound like much, but it makes a difference in the consistency. Vanilla pudding with M&M mini chips are a hit with my daughter.

This recipe went over great in my household. I baked them both with butterscotch pudding and chocolate pudding mix and both turned out well although I did prefer the chocolate pudding over the butterscotch. They are like little cakes as the author had suggested!

Because of the options that come with this recipe (i.e. pudding flavors and chip varieties), this is one of our favorite recipes for cookies. Because we're kind of health nuts, we swap out some of the bleached flour for whole wheat and use olive oil in place of the butter. They turn out superb every time!

These are amazing!  The double butterscotch is definitely the favorite in my house!  I made the mistake of trying the cheesecake pudding with chocolate chips.  This did not turn out too well.  Not terrible cookies, but definitely had no cheesecake flavor! Fun recipe.

I made these following the recipe exactly. I got mixed reviews. Me, I didn't like them at all! My husband liking them the most.

My guy thought these were "pretty good"~ he would have thought these came from the pre-mixed dough we sometimes buy at the supermarket, so that might tell you something right there, lol!
My 11 year old thought they were "spongy" and didn't like the aftertaste.
I will not be making them again.

This recipe was almost identical to Amy's Chocolate Chip Cookies, only using all butter and a different pudding flavor. I didn't use all butter only because I was afraid of it spreading, so I used half butter/half margerine. I also used pecans instead of walnuts and I used extra dark chocolate chips. I did chill the dough for about an hour, again because I was afraid of them spreading. Pudding cookies FTW!

These cookies are delicious!!!  I had never used pudding in any baking recipe, and I am so glad I tried it.  I made two batches using different combinations---one with chocolate pudding with peanut butter chips and one with vanilla pudding and chocolate chips.  They were so much better than I expected!  I followed the recipe exactly, and I must note---people who have reviewed saying the texture is weird---I think it is the pudding, but in my opinion (and my husband's!) it is a great unexpected texture that only makes it better!  Love this recipe and will continue to use it for years to come!

Interesting texture but great taste. These cookies are very quick and easy to make.They don't rise or fill out they just sort of sit the way you plop them. Very delicious though!!

I used butterscotch pudding and white chocolate chips - and the result was really good!  They were actually better on the second day.  These will definitely be made again in our house - and we will continue to experiment with flavors.  Great recipe!

These cookies are amazing. Rumors are spread about how great they are. Lines formed outside my office when people found out how great these cookies were. I made them using fudge pudding and peanut butter chips, and tonight I will make another batch of chocolate pudding and chocolate chips. YUM.

Liked these quite a bit.  only had milk chocolate chips on hand, so used those- but I think the semi sweet would have been better.  The cookie is moist.  I like that it stayed in form well when cooked and cook time was accurate (mine took 9 minutes).  Will make again.

I made this with chocolate pudding.  My husband accidentally bought the cook & serve type.  They were awesome with semisweet choco chips!  Just don't over-bake them.

I made mine with chocolate pudding and mini chocolate chips and toffee bits.  They were SO GOOD.  I can't wait to make these with other flavors.  I got almost 5 dozen from this batch.

This another one those OMG recipes, because that's exactly what people are saying when they have one of these cookies.  They really are that good.  I use french vanilla pudding mix in place of butterscotch and omit the nuts as many people I know do not like them (I love them but am usually not baking for just myself).  The trick to keeping these cookies 'melt-in-your-mouth' soft is to pull them out at exactly 8 minutes.  I found that even one minute over cooks them too much as they are going to continue to cook once they come out of the oven.  They will look undercooked but they're not.  Make sure you get an oven thermometer and test your oven's temperature to make sure it's actuate.  I discovered over a year ago that mine is running 50 degrees higher than it reads.  It was a big reason many of my baked dishes were coming out dry or under-baked in the middle.  I tried this once with 'baking' margarine sticks instead of butter...bad idea.  The cookies came out very cake-like and 'puffy,' not the look I was going for.  Most and chewy is what we want around here!

I made these using chocolate pudding and 3/4 cup butter since I like plumper less spread out cookies...needless to say they came out perfect! I added 1/4 cup of chopped pecans instead of the nuts - just enough to give a hint of nutty flavor. I will definitely be using this recipe again since the variations are endless!

I was a little unsure at first about these cookies at first until I read the reviews and decided I should give them a try.  Everyone who ate them...LOVED them.  This is the only way I plan to make my chocolate chip cookies in the future.  I tried vanilla pudding with butterscotch chips, chocolate pudding with chocolate chips.  My favorite so far is chocolate pudding cookies with no chips...I had to force myself to stop eating them!  I'm planning on trying cookies n cream pudding today...crossing my fingers!

I have made dozens and dozens of different cookie recipes and this is by far one of the top 5!! I did it just as instructed other than adding an extra teaspoon and half of vanilla and I used reeses bites and m&m's which were sooo good with the butterscotch pudding flavor!! I have 4 little boys and then my hubby and they all went nuts and my hubby does not like many cookies!! Thanks so much I am making them again next week for a family reunion. Oh yeah I also baked them for 8 and 1/2 minutes and took them out and they look rather cake like at this point put within a few minutes they spread out to look like the perfect chocolate chip cookies and are super soft and moist!! They will not last long!!

This was a really yummy cookie, and very versatile. I used Cheesecake pudding mix with chocolate chips and chopped Milky Way. The crumbly consistency was very unexpected and not like a typical cookie; i Still have mixed feelings about it.

Out of the 20ish recipies I've tried this one gets TOP marks.

Vanilla pudding is all I had... so I tried it & they are GREAT. The pudding added a very mild flavor. The cookie dough was yummy too! I added 1/4 c. flour & baked 10 minutes and they were slightly cruchy, not cake-like at all. Lightly sweet, Not too sweet... 
(REAL butter in recipie & pam on a regular shiny aluminum cookie sheet)

PRETTIEST choc chip cookies I've ever baked. I even whipped out the camera and took a picture! Perfect rise, perfect spread, and perfect bottoms!

Overall, this will probably be my MAIN cookie recipie from now on.

This should tell how good they are, I'm taking some to my In-laws tomorrow!
:)

Pretty good cookie,  moist, chewy and cake like. I used choc pudding instead of butterscotch, and peanut butter/choc swirl chips.  The taste was great but the color was a little odd, almost a reddish tinge to the cookie itself and the chips burned a little where they touched the bottom of the cookie sheet (although the cookies were not burnt at all).  I will make again and play around with the pudding and chips, thanks for the recipe!

This was a great recipe! I used coconut cream pudding, pecans and cinnamon chips. What a wonderful combo - I took a plate to work, and the office staff said they were the best cookies they had ever eaten and requested the recipe. Thanks.

I was nervous trying these cookies because it said it had a cake like texture, but I am always one to try to create a better mousetrap, so threw caution to the wind and mixed some up. Am I ever glad I did! These cookies are wonderful! I used vanilla pudding mix and these cookies have the same wonderful flavor just like traditional chocolate cookies. They are also a beautiful texture. I wouldn't exactly call it cake-like because it was definitely cookie-like in texture, but these cookies are soft and melt in the mouth. A wonderful cookie that everyone must try! I will be keeping this recipe and using it again!

These cookies are excellent...and the texture the day after is perfect & soft!  I used 1/2 chocolate & 1/2 white chocolate chips & I even added a tablespoon of instant vanilla-flavored coffee, which gives just a hint of coffee flavor!  I think you can really play around with the flavors you use with the pudding!  Also, cook them until they are just about done, but not quite...they will stay so soft the day after!!  THANKS!!!

A good, solid recipe for a cookie whose 'next day texture' is truly impressive.
Same recipe as "Award Winning Soft Chocolate Chip Cookies" on this site. I ground the nuts super fine & my friend who 'hates nuts in cookies' loved these. Thanks for the recipe! It's a keeper.

I used chocolate pudding--very, very tasty.  One thing I did was substitute one cup of unsweetened apple sauce for the one cup of butter; I was worried how they would turn out, but they puffed up and were so moist and soft--just like little cakes. They are a little sticky feeling, but that is probably because of my substitution, and it doesn't affect the taste (the most important part) at all.

These are excellent chocolate chip cookies!  They are very similar to award winning choc. chip cookies (also from this site).  I didn't have butterscotch pudding, so I just used vanilla pudding.  The pudding makes them so soft!  Next time I'm going to experiment with the different kinds of pudding.  I highly recommend these cookies!

I've used this recipe for years, and everytime they have been a huge hit.  When I was in college, they were known around campus as the best choc chip cookies around.  It was also well known there was a "Secret Ingredient" (AKA, the Pudding).  I never told anyone it was pudding, and to this day no one has guessed it as the secret ingredient.  But it has been a blast watching everyone savor every bite trying to figure it out!

I used chocolate pudding and chocolate chunks instead of chips.  The cookies were chewy, but not exactly cake-like (perhaps because of the chunk substitution).  My family went absolutely nuts over them.  "The best cookies you've ever made."

Cookies looked attractive and received compliments from friends and family but not one of my favorite chocolate chip recipes.  Texture was too soft, "cake like"; prefer crunchy exterior and soft interior.  Too sweet for my tastes, and I feel that the pudding mix  added only extra calories and artificial ingredients and did not enhance the flavor or texture of the cookie.

I love these. I've used the following combinations so far: French Vanilla pudding with dark chocolate and mint chips, pistachio pudding with choc chips and chopped dried cherries for spumoni cookies, and lemon pudding with choc chips (I would like to try those with cherries, too!) Every time, they come out delicious. I also add about 1/4 tsp of salt to bring out the flavors.

This recipe is super easy and provides countless options simply by switching the flavour of pudding and chips. The bake time did take about 12 mins, but the end result is a nice puffy cookie.

Very versatile recipe.  Flavor of pudding used can make either a subtle or a huge difference.  My personal favorite is butterscotch pudding with white chocolate chips.

This is the best cookie recipe I've ever made. It's my go-to recipe when I need to thank someone, comfort someone, apologize, etc.. The pudding gives them a very unique taste, and the chips/pudding combo can be modified to whatever you want. I agree with Barb Maxwell that the flour should be increased to 2 1/2 cups. In all, these cookies have a cakey texture and stay very very soft.

I have made these for a long time now, but I use "Vanilla Instant Pudding & Pie Filling", and only 6 ounces of chocolate chips. Everyone really loves them because they are so tasty & soft!!

Excellent recipe. These were great. I used everything per the recipe except the chips. I used half semi-sweet chocolate chips and half butterscotch. Turned out just awesome. I will definitely make again and play around with the pudding and chips.

These are the best cookies I have ever made.  My old chocolate chip cookie recipe made soft cookies but they were very flat.  The cookies from this recipe keep their shape very well, thanks to the pudding.  Very moist and flavorful.  The first batch I used vanilla pudding.  The next batch I'm going to use chocolate pudding.  Can't wait to make these again.  The whole family loved them.

Glad I tried this. I used chocolate and vanilla pudding because that is what I had on hand. Love the chocolate dough. Very heavy dough I would say and it was difficult to incorporate all the chips. I would say it could use less chips. I did slightly pat down the 1 1/2 " scoops I place on cookie sheet and they did cook at the 8 minute mark. So with hot cocoa the snowed in teens in this house are happy.

These were great! I used white chocolate chips and m&m's with vanilla pudding mix. I also added a teaspoon of cinnamon. I rolled them in teaspoon balls and they came out perfectly moist and chewy. They didn't spread out or have a cake-like consistency like others have said. I cooked them for about 8 minutes.

I have never made a cookie with cake mix or ppudding but thought I'd give these a try and my family LOVED them!!! My husband said they are by far his favorite all time cookie. And such a simple recipe! I love that you can change up the flavor so easily and still end up with a perfectly soft and delicious cookie. You will not be disappointed!

Mmmm these cookies were so amazing, all my friends were trying hard not to eat too many but they kept coming back for more! I made them for our Game Night. I loved the cakey consistency because no one wants dry, crunchy cookies. I have another party tonight and I think I'll try one of the tastey-sounding variations mentioned by the other reviewers!

I wanted to try banana creme pudding as someone had suggested but I did not have the required 3.4oz size on hand, so I ended up mixing 1.5oz banana creme pudding and 1.5oz vanilla pudding.  I also added Reese peanut butter chips.  These were excellent!  There was just enough banana flavor to where you could definitely taste it but it was not overpowering at all.  I am not a big fan of the "fake" banana taste so these were perfect.

Good, cake-like textured cookie with many different possibilities for variation. I used Pumpkin Spice pudding mix and added caramel bits & raisins. Perfect for Autumn. Tasted like little mini pumpkin cakes. Could have used a bit more spice though. Can always add some next time.Using a small cookie scoop, the recipe made approx. 6 1/2 dozen cookies. They're thicker than I expected - especially with using a full 1-cup butter. That's a lot of butter. It should have been a flatter cookie with that much butter. I think it may have something to do with the high temperature. Would like to try again, decreasing the oven temp to 350. A good cookie for folks who like their cookies soft.

I don't know how anyone couldn't love these cookies.  I make them all the time, well when I make cookies.  My whole family loves them.  They are the most moist soft cookie I have ever had.  I usually use chocolate pudding with chocolate chips or white chips.  We like chocolate.  Anyway great recipe!!

Tops any other CCC I've made.  These are soft cookies and bake up very nicely.  The flavors can be easily mixed up.  The first batch I made with vanilla pudding mix and a combination of chocolate chips and peanut butter chips.  Will make these again for sure.  Thanks!

Absolutely LOVED these cookies! They were to die for! I used choclate pudding with milk chocolate chips and instead of nuts I used the Reeses Peanut Butter chips... yummm.. is all I have to say. They were soo moist and fluffy.. almost light tasting. Definately making this again!

Great recipe! I added an extra 1/4 cup of flour as one user suggested, and the cookies turned out beautifully. I made one mistake - I accidentally bought a 1 oz. box of pudding mix instead of the 3.4 oz. Since the cookies were so good, I can't imagine how wonderful they would be had I done things as directed. Next time I'll get the right amount of pudding mix, and I can't wait to try other flavors.

Loved them!! Great that you can use different flavors of pudding. I only had 4-serving size boxes (1 oz each) so I used two and the cookies turned out well.

Great cookies! I've made these with several pudding variations and I have to say everyone's favorite is french vanilla pudding with semi sweet and milk chocolate chips. The cookies stay soft for days. I always make them on a stone so the bottoms don't burn. Thanks for the recipe. My family, friends, and co-workers thank you too.

I tried these cookies with vanilla pudding mix instead of chocolate and it didn't go well. For the first batch, I followed the directions and baked for 10 minutes at 375.  The cookies weren't done at all, I put them back in the oven and ended up burning them.  The second batch was put in the freezer for about 30 minutes and then I sliced them and baked them at 350 for about 15 minutes and they came out perfect.  Great dipped in milk!  Good recipe, but next time, I cook lower and slower.

These were delicious!  It tastes like a chocolate chip cookie, but there's something yummy about it that you just can't put your finger on! (Unless of course you made them and know that it's a box of butterscotch pudding :)

I've always used this recipe, got it from a Jello pudding box years ago.  I double it, use one box coconut cream and one box cheesecake pudding. I also add coconut and almond extract, and at times dried cranberries.  This recipe is also great with oatmeal!

These are the best cookies!  I used vanilla pudding and mini chocolate chips.  Also added 1/4 cup more flour.  They turned out nice and thick; a little crispy on the outside and warm & soft on the inside.  My husband is not much of a "sweet" eater and loved them as much as our boys.

I just made these and thought they turned out really well. I took the advice of other reviewers and increased the cooking time to about 12 min. I only added a 1/2 cup of brown sugar and left out the white sugar entirely, I think the full amount of sugar would have been much too sweet.

These are really good if you like a gooey cookie, as opposed to crunchy. Do NOT overcook these trying to get a crunchier cookie because you will lose the flavor of the pudding. Follow the reccommended cook time.

These are a hit in my house!

I was worried that these cookies would be too cake-like, but I was wrong.  Fresh out of the oven, they had this amazing texture- somewhere between cotton candy and a meringue.  Once cool, they were as soft as a cookie could be without coming apart.  I used pistachio pudding and white chocolate chips, no nuts, and 11 mins. in the oven.  I'd probably use a different pudding next time as the pistachio flavor was almost undetectable, making the greenish color of the cookies an unappetizing mystery.  But it was still obvious that this was an awesome cookie.  Can't wait to try another flavor!

I liked the texture of this cookie, very soft. I am not a fan of crunch cookies. However I couldn't taste the butterscotch so it really just taste more like a normal chocolate chip cookie, and it was good but I have tasted better. I would add some butterscotch chips or something if you are wanting a butterscotch flavor. Me and my husband just couldn't taste it. But it's not a bad cookie the texture is great.

This recipes is fantastic!  I reduced the baking soda by 1/2, used vanilla pudding, 1/2 milk chocolate  chips and 1/2 semi-sweet chips (which is what I typically do for chocolate chip cookies) and they came out perfect after 13 minutes.  Definitely a new favorite in our house!

These were easy to make, and yummy that day, a slight cruch with very soft insides.  I take stars off because I felt there were a few too many choc chips for the dough, and the next day they were rock hard, despite being in an airtight container!!

We used vanilla pudding.  These are very good, moist on the inside, little crispy on the outside. A keeper!

I made these for the second time and this time I tried something different. I chilled the dough overnight and rolled it out to make cut-out cookies! It worked out great. If you want to try this, make sure you refrigerate the dough first and try using powdered sugar to "flour" your countertops instead of flour.

These are the best chocolate chip cookies I have made so far. I have been trying to make a good cookie, but never had much success until this recipe.
Warning though to people on diets, it's hard not to eat too many at one time.

Very good!  I am a huge cookies baker, having made 50 dozen cookies for one customer once! Made these for the first time today, and will be adding this recipe to my file.  Followed recipe exactly except ommited the nuts. Can't wait to try different combinations.

This cookie is simply the best. I have made them several times. I have used vanilla pudding with chocolate chips. I also used lemon pudding with white chocolate chips. You can have fun changing them. They always come out perfect!

This is by far my favorite cookie recipe ever! I make them just about every week. They are my husband's favorite and never last more than a day. They are the best the day after making them. Thanks for such a great cookie recipe!

This is exactly the same as Award Winning Soft Chocolate Chip cookies from this site, except this recipe is half of that one and that one bakes at 350 for 10-12 min. This is an awesome recipe and a great idea. I just made these and will be making them again with different flavors of pudding and chips.

These cookies are awesome!!   I made a mistake and only put one egg in instead of two.  The dough was a bit dry but I form the dough into large balls and flattened them a bit with a fork dipped in sugar and when they baked they turned out something like ginger snaps in appearance.  They turned out perfect.  Next time I make them I will only put one egg in again.  Thanks for the great recipe.  I used chocolate pudding power.

If these cookies taste anyyyything like they smell...they are going to be so yummy!  they are in the oven now and we simply can NOT wait to eat them!  So easy to assemble...we used the chocolate pudding with chocolate chips...and took the advice of others and increased the flour to 2 1/2 cups!  Oh, there's the oven timer now!  I'll let you know how there are...MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!  Wow!  Dust these with powdered sugar and you will die!!!  Thanks for the recipe!

If you're used to buying storebought (as in grocery, not bakery) these will be good to you. But If you bake often and like quality tasting stuff, skip. I thought the pudding would be a wonderful idea for texture, but the taste is just overwhelming and fake. They look really good (some pictures) but the taste is just cheap and not satisfying. Sweet fluffy cardboard. The raw batter though? I LOVED IT. I should've kept it all raw lol.

I love baking and this was the very first time I had ever baked cookies. I made them for my families Christmas dinner and to say they were a success would be an understatement. I used vanilla pudding for the base dough and I split it up into three different batches. One batch was chocolate chip and hazelnuts, one was snickerdoodle, and the crowd pleasers was lemon and white chocolate. My dad is a cookie lover and he had cookies from some very well known bakeries in our area and he said mine were so much better! He’s actually requesting me to make him a huge batch of the lemon and white chocolate (for the lemon I just added lemon extract but next time I’m going to use zest and extract). I’m making another batch today and these are a rift on my moms everything cookies.

Made exactly as written except chocolate pudding and sea salt caramel chips. (Bet it would work with any combination of pudding and chips). My son (3) loved making these. Sent a bunch to work with my husband for the holidays and they devoured them.

Amazing! Husband asked me for pistachio pudding flavored cookies. This worked perfectly!!!!
I used pistachio pudding, pistachios, white chips, and almond extract. Only used brown sugar, and half butter and half shortening  as well. It might be even better to use half vanilla and half almond extract, but he was thoroughly satisfied anyhow. And he is a bit of a picky cookie snob!
I would definitely recommend this recipe!

These were good cookies, soft and tasty. I made them just the way it was written in the recipe. My only criticism is that they baked very quickly and had a tendency to brown. After I noticed this on the first batch, I removed them after 7 minutes.

I followed this recipe exactly as written except are used Vanilla pudding. I don't ordinarily give things five stars but these are amazing! They're like store-bought crunchy on the outside kind of soft in the middle perfect with the flavor of homemade cookies. I will definitely recommend this recipe!

I don't follow this exact recipe, but it's the framework for my perfect cookie. I use Godiva white chocolate vanilla bean pudding mix. I also only do max, 2 cups of flour. This helps the cookies rise, but keeps them chewy and skips the cake texture. :) Bake these until the crusts around the outside are JUST golden. I pull them and let them rest, and they are perfectoooo. enjoy!

This is the recipe that my mom used for years. It is great with chocolate pudding or vanilla pudding. Also, if you leave out the chips and roll the scoops of dough in cinnamon sugar you have tasty snickerdoodles. I love this recipe because the cookies stay soft.

Pretty good! I made them with vanilla pudding and semi sweet chocolate chips(since that’s all I had at the moment) they taste like chewy chips ahoy.

I use this recipe all the time. Today I didn't have the size pudding mix they called for (mine was 5 ounces) so I had to guess, but it still came out great 
very tasty soft baked cookie! I always use vanilla pudding mix and add in butterscotch chips.

I gave this out to all my friends and family who said that it was the "best thing you have ever baked!" I love them so much and they taste like really soft, Nabisco Vanilla Wafers. I recommend them to anyone looking for a delicious and easy treat. When making them I had no chocolate chips or nuts and they were still yummy. I can't wait to make them again and I will probably try many other pudding flavors. ??????

I made this recipe exactly with the exception of changing the chips and the pudding according to the flavors I want (chocolate pudding mix and tollhouse mint chocolate chips are a pure delight!). I cooked them for 12 minutes bc I use a baking stone but this recipe is perfect just the way it is.  A huge hit!  I think I'll always make my cookies following this recipe.

This recipe always turns out great. I like Nestle triple chip and cheesecake pudding mix the best. I always back for less time and adjust to get the perfect texture in the oven.

Very easy. Not too sweet (I used Vanilla pudding). They were a big hit with my Granddaughter! I bagged some up for her on Sunday and heard she was sorry she didn't have more for her rest-of-the-week school lunches.

I  love this recipe and plan to keep it for special occasions. Since I don't like butterscotch,  I used "birthday cake" pudding mix instead. Great taste! In the future, I plan to play around with other pudding flavors to see what other combinations I like for this cookie mix. Thanks!

this is my number one recipe. everyone loves my cookies and I tell them they have a secret ingredient (pudding)! I mix these cookies by hand. never in the mixer. I find they don't come out as soft when you over mix. I use milk chocolate chips and scor bits with vanilla pudding! amazing! have tried with banana pudding but not the same as the banana pudding gives it a fake banana flavour.

The first time I made the recipe, I used white chocolate instant pudding mix and milk chocolate mini chips.  The flavor is great, but with the added ingredient of pudding mix,  the cookies are extremely sweet, so a glass of cold milk is a must when eating them.  I would have given the recipe a 5-star rating if the cookies hadn't been overly sweet.  The second time I made them, I used chocolate pudding mix and peanut butter chips.  My husband accidently picked up sugar-free pudding, which definitely changed the texture to be even more cake-like.  The cookies didn't flatten when baked, so they turned out to be like little round cakes with baking chips.  They tasted good, but I think I prefer regular pudding mix for this recipe.

Oh, I just LOVE this recipe! I followed everything except for one thing. I only had 2 cups of flour left. So for the 1/4cup that was left over, I substituted Quaker Rolled Oats. I added Reese's chips along with the chocolate chips because I had about half a cup of each left. These are a must try! Easily one of my favorites! They are SOO moist and stay soft for a while!

I just finished making these cookies and oh my god are they delicious.  I switched the butterscotch pudding with vanilla, and changed the amount of flour to 2 1/2 cups to keep the cookies from spreading out to much.  I know some people are criticizing the recipe because it taste to "chemically" but  I have to say that I don't quite understand what they mean, and this is coming from someone who has been eating mainly organic, minimally processed food their entire life.  However, I would say that if you prefer crisp cookies to look for a different recipe because this recipe makes cookies that are anything but crisp.

This is my second time making these, they are amazing! My husband and I were at the grocery store this morning and as we passed the pudding he looked at me and asked if I would make those delicious pudding cookies again! I do sub the butterscotch pudding for chocolate and use regular chocolate chips for a double chocolate chip cookie. Very moist and chewy. Super easy to make. Has quickly become my go to cookie. Thanks for the recipe!

Amazing! I used French vanilla pudding and a combo of chocolate and butterscotch chips, but what was really fantastic was how deliciously soft and chewy these are the day after I baked them!! Yummy!!!

These were amazing! I only baked them for 8 minutes. I also made them only the size of a tablespoon. The batter seemed very strange, but they do turn out great. I used Hershey's dark chocolate pudding and reese's M&M's.

How Disappointing!  I tried another chocolate chip cookie recipe from this site a couple of weeks ago with triple the vanilla and sea salt and it was to die for.  Thought I would take the chance for another cookie variety, and these are just bad.  Like one of the other recipes said, it tastes so dry with a weird after taste.  I only could bake them 6 minutes in my convection oven because I started with 8 minutes and burnt a batch.  Not a great loss since these are just dry and bland.  Back to original findings....

Soft, fluffy and flavorful.  Delicious right out of the oven.  Since I live in high elevation, I added an extra 1/2 cup of flour.

Excellent. Moist and plump. Very good flavor. I used vanilla pudding and semi-sweet chips, and doubled the recipe. I did not include the nuts. The following week I experimented with chocolate pudding and white chips. They were not as good as the first batch.

Love these.  I used vanilla pudding and used butterscotch and chocolate chips.  But the best thing of all I learned something new from a review I read.  My cookies for years have always gone flat. I would make sure the butter was not too soft, I would mix by hand so the dough was not over worked you name it and I tried it. So I saw this recipe and thought I am going to try that and as I looked at the reviews someone said to not put the cookie dough on a hot baking sheet because that will cause the cookies to flatten and if you only have one cookie sheet then run it under cool water to cool it down.  I am so excited to start making cookies again.

I followed exactly, using chocolate pudding with peanut butter chips. It was OK, but rather bland and not worth the calories.

I grew up on these cookies; they were the only kind of chocolate chip cookie that my mother made (always using vanilla pudding/ chocolate chips). I didn't realize the variety that I could make them in until reading the reviews! Excited to try new things!

Also, on the most recent batch, I got started before realizing that I only had one stick of butter, so I substituted 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce (which always works as a substitute "oil"). IT WORKED! Great consistency, plus a little more healthy!

This recipe was a big hit at my father's work. Everyone loved them. I omitted the nuts and added around 2 tsp of vanilla. I am going to try different flavors of pudding as well. I highly recommend this recipe. Highly addicting! You can't have just one! The best cookie I have ever had!

I made two batches- one with vanilla pudding and chocolate chips and one with chocolate pudding and butterscotch chips. We thought these were just OK, I thought that the instant pudding gave the cookies a somewhat artificial taste.  I think I will stick to more traditional chocolate chip cookie recipes from now on.

simple to mix up, great taste AND the cookies tasted good for over a WEEK.  Just by mistake, I did not have enough brown sugar, so I only used a scant 1/2 cup =I thought they were great.

I love this recipe.  Makes an otis spunkmeyer like cookie.  I did make a couple of changes.  I added a tsp of salt and used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar.  Oh and I cooked them for 11 minutes at 350 degrees.  Super delicious.  Highly recommended.  I think they store best in a tupperware container with a single slice of bread.  The bread gets stale as the cookies remain fresh and soft.  Yum!

These cookies are by far the best I have ever made. I always receive lots of compliments whenever I bake these, and they don't last long in our household. Thank you for such a fantastic recipe!

OMG! I'm so excited...my family used to make these allllll the time while I was growning up & we had lost the recipe. Our normal variations were Vanilla pudding with chocolate chips and Chocolate pudding with White chocolate chips. I remember once making dozens & dozens with my aunt to send to my uncle that was away in the Navy. He said once his fellow submariners got a hold of them they were gone in a matter of an hour or two.

I remember this recipe when it came out in pudding boxes when I was a kid.  It was the only chocolate chip cookie I would beg my mom to make!  I've tried lots of pudding combinations, but my favorite is  white chocolate pudding with regular chocolate chips... no nuts though.  NO CRUNCH ALLOWED!
So yummy even 25 years later!

Made with Banana Cream pudding & peanut butter/chocolate chips, you can never go wrong! You'll be lucky if a batch lasts 2 days, so better make it a double!

There's potential, but it needs salt... the flavor was not as rich as I was looking for based on the other reviews.

These cookies are AMAZING!  I used banana creme pie pudding and white chocolate chips.  I can't wait to try a different combination.  Their cake-like texture is perfect.  It is the best cookie I have ever made.  Great recipe!  Thanks again!

I make these all the time, especially at Christmas.  I have tried dozens of combinations and all are fun to try.  Our faves have been with chocolate pudding, cherry baking chips and pecans; chocolate fudge pudding and milk chocolate chips (no nuts in this one and it is still yummy); pumpkin spice pudding (can't always find this flavor) with chocolate or butterscotch chips and pecans. Tomorrow I'm baking a new combo with chocolate fudge pudding, 'white chocolate chips' and macadamia nuts.  These are so easy and fun to make.  My children love to see what mixture I'm trying next.

These cookies are so good! They come out real soft, just like I like them. Everyone at my job keeps asking me to make more. I use the sugar free cheesecake pudding mix instead of the butterscotch. The cheesecake flavor is not overwhelming, just a slight taste of it. I also use less than the recommended 12 ounces of chocolate chips (about 7 or 8 ounces instead). I also omitted the nuts.

I was looking for a new kind of cookie, and I remembered one that I LOVED using chocolate pudding mix. I thought the recipe was simple and easy. I used choc. puddng mix instead of the butterscotch, and used a combination of butterscotch and semi-sweet chocolate chips with just a few pecans in place of the walnuts. Overall, they are very good. They're a little too sweet for me (I think it's the butterscotch chips-I might use peanut butter next time), and cutting the nuts back and adding more choc. chips probably added to the sweetness. I baked them for 9 minutes, let them cool, and they are delicious and "cakey" and moist. Hopefully they will remain moist for a few more days-I hate stale cookies. If all goes well, I would definitely make these again, and I love the option of using different flavors to mix it up a bit.

Great recipe. It was very easy to make and turned out delicious. The cookies were nice and chewy. However, I suggest you don't use as much sugar as suggested, because even after reducing brown sugar to 150g and eliminating the white sugar, it was too sweet.

This cookie is good but I was disappointed. At the end of the day, it's just a chocolate chip cookie. A good one, but still just a chocolate chip cookie.

I made these cookies a bit different.. I do not like to use a whole lot of sugar when baking so I used Splenda instead of white sugar and a fat free, sugar free pudding mix.  These turned out great!  Usually when you bake with Splenda, the cookies are very 'cakey'.  While this was cakey as well.. it was pleseantly offset by the pudding.  This made for a very thick, chewy, moist cookie.  They were loved at my home.

These cookies were fantastic!  They were so soft and chewy and very addictive.  They were gone before I knew it.  The second batch I made, I used half chocolate chips and half white chocolate chips and one cup of toasted peacans.
I rolled them into balls the size of large walnuts and this worked best.

Great cookies! This is actually the first time I made cookies from scratch on my own. They are soft and oh so delicious. I made this batch with Vanilla Pudding and Chocolate Chips. I'm looking forward to trying other combinations.

My family has never met a chocolate chip cookie they didn't like and these were no exception.  I couldn't taste a distinct pudding flavor (I used chocolate) and the texture is good.  I only used 2 cups of flour as I thought the dough was becoming a bit dry as I mixed them.  Next time I will reduce the sugar slightly as I found the pudding added a lot of sweetness.

These were quite a hit in my house! They were kind of a funny orange color from the butterscotch pudding. Didn't matter for at home, but I would be unlikely to use them for bake sale baking for this reason.

I will never make any other kind of chocolate chip cookie ever again now that I have tasted these!  So chewy - they stay soft forever!  You can't go wrong with instant pudding in the mix!

Very easy to make, I had everything on hand & my kids loved them.  I did use chocolate pudding just because I'm not sure my children would like the butterscotch. A great cookie when you feel like putting a twist on your standard choc chip cookie recipe!
