Yep, an oldie but a goodie. I have made this for years. I also have, on occasion, left out the sausage. Also, instead of using salsa I sometimes just put a can of Rotel (diced tomatoes with chilies) in. What I do is put all ingredients into a small crock pot, turn on low and allow folks to dip at their leisure. Just a stir or two every so often keeps this in good shape.

Classic queso that we have enjoyed for years and years.  We have always called it Jose Dip, after a Houston chef.  We usually double the recipe in a crock pot on warm or low and the dip disappears at every party we have.  Try hot breakfast sausage for more of a kick.  You can also do 1/2 sausage and 1/2 ground beef.  We have always used Rotel, one can of regular and one can of Extra Hot to 2 pounds of Velveeta.  Hot and spicy...but we're Texans, what can I say...that's the way we like it!  Yummy, yummy, yummy.  Best with margaritas and homemade flour tortilla chips.  ;)

This was sooooooo good! I cooked the sausage and placed that in a small crockpot. Then, I added the cubed cheese and about 3/4 of a jar of medium chunky salsa. I stirred it together and let it cook, stirring occasionally, until completely melted, (it took about 1-1 1/2 hours). We really loved the taste of this dip and it was so simple too! Thanks for posting. :)

Delicious!  I used two cans of Rotel tomatoes and green chiles, both drained.  After I combined all of the ingredients, I also threw  in a handful of chopped green onions and fresh cilantro and it was amazing!

Pretty tasty! My only complaint is that it was a little runny, next time I would drain at least half the juice out of the can of Rotel. I only had 8oz of Velveeta, so I used cream cheese to replace the rest. That tasted great and cut the spiciness of the sausage, which I appreciated. Thanks!

I'm making this today, right now, and it looks (and smells) dee-lish!  I wanted a bit more Mexican flava, so I used chorizo.  I also whipped up some salsa - Ro-tel plus fresh onion, garlic, sweet pepper, cilantro, and lime juice - to use instead of plain Ro-tel or store-bought salsa.  I only had half a 16-oz brick of Velveeta left, so I split the rest between Philly Cream Cheese and some local aged Cheddar.  Cooked up the chorizo, then threw everything else in the Crock Pot.  Voila'!  Super-easy.  Super-tasty.  Super-bad-nutrition, but that's what the gym is for!  Eh, at least it's got tomatoes (and onion & garlic) in it.  :D

Maybe this would be a good recipe if I liked Velveeta.  Never tried using the stuff before this recipe, and now I know that I don't like it.  It's maybe too salty or something, but tastes overprocessed.

This is a great recipe for parties. I use the hot sausage and you can add tabasco or a can of green chilis for an extra kick. Make sure you have plenty of corn chips!

I prefer salsa to the Rotel.  Usually a salsa with corn and black beans.  I also use sweet Italian sausage instead of the breakfast sausage.  I brown the sausage in the bottom of my small rice cooker, then throw in the salsa and cheese and it switches to warm as soon as it is all melted and gooey.

Really good.  I browned my sausage, then dumped everything into a Crockpot.  I put it on low & left it overnight.  I don't recommend this because it burned in some places and didn't fully melt in others---totally my fault though.  My friend had made it for an event & I so I decided to steal the recipe from her.  Super simple.  Tastey.

As written, a little bland.  Much better with spicy sausage and add some green onions (and jalepenos if you like those).

I've made this many, many times. I always use rotel, but usually I leave out the sausage. Sometimes instead of sausage, I'll add a can of chili (with no beans). It's a perfect snack while watching the Titans play football :)

Fantastic and incredibly easy! We don't like a lot of hot and spicy, so just used the regular sausage. I also used the white Velveeta. Yum, yum, yum!!! Husband absolutely loved it, will be a favorite go to recipe for sure.

Incredibly delicious! Obviously REALLY bad for you, but what do you expect from cheese and sausage?

I always use a char of salsa rather than a can of tomatoes. Another tip: when browning the sausage try to get the sausage as fine as you can. Big chunks of sausage break chips.

For taste alone, I would have given this a 5 star, but it was too runny.  I doubled the recipe and used two cans of Rotel.  I drained one of them even though the recipe says "undrained."  Next time I will drain them both.  I used hot sausage, and one of the cans of Rotel was hot and one was regular.  The dip turned out plenty hot enough for us.

This is an old family favorite and Super Bowl Sunday MUST!  It's also great if you substitute 2 cans Campbell's Nacho Cheese soup and 1 can Campbell's Cheddar Cheese soup for the Velveeta.    Either way it's a yummy crock pot snack!

I did as another lady posted and put half an 8oz pkg of crm cheese in with it. I also chopped up green onions and put into a bowl to serve on the side with it. DELICIOUS!!! Everyone loved it. I served this as a finger food on Christmas Eve.

Good and easy. I made in crockpot. Doubled the recipe using still only 1 lb of sausage, which was plenty. Little on the runnt side. Might of used to much salsa and would go w/ chunkier salsa next time!

This was so good!! Very creamy. I melted my velveeta with my cooked sausage on the stove and then transferred to crock pot because I was in a hurry

Let's just say this, I made Hamburger Helper for my husband (which is his all-time fav. thing to eat, gross out) and he ate a big bowl of this dip before he touched the H.H. THAT'S a good dip. I used salsa and it was so yummy!

This was awesome!  I used Jimmy Dean sausage and it was wonderful! I also added a fresh diced and seeded jalapeno pepper for a little added spice! YUM!

I thought this was a little too thick.  I added 1 cup of whipping cream and a small jar of pimentos and the green chilies.  This is definitely better the next day as the flavours blend the longer it sits in the refrigerator

Great queso dip. I made this for my sisters baby shower to make this ahead I browned the sausage with some onion and when it was browned I threw in a fresh chopped jalapeno. I placed the brown sausage in my slow cooker. Ontop of the sausage I placed the cubed velveeta, can of diced tomatoes with jalapenos, and a can of diced green chilies. The next day I put the dish inside the warmer part of the slow cooker and turned on low. The guest said it was kind if spicy but it was perfect for me.

I think it has way too much sausage so next time I'll use half the sausage and also drain the Rotel because the cheese was too runny.  I may even use canned chili instead of sausage for a chili con queso dip like Chili's restaraunt.

Flavor was great, but it sure got cold fast, no one would eat it that way. I have a crockpot, but it wouldn't have worked on the coffee table (we had guests over for a movie). I need to invest in one of those heated chip and dip trays I guess. Anyway, everyone did like it a lot; I just had to make an awful lot of trips to the microwave...lol.

Very good.  I have made a recipe like this for years...however, the recipe I used called for bacon and onions...fry them, drain, add rotel and velveeta and a little milk to thin a bit.  Then I served with toasted french bread that I cubed and toast in the oven.  Yum!!!

I really enjoyed this although (eep) I use ground beef instead because it's generally what I have on hand.  Also I like adding diced jalepenos.

I give this recipe 5 stars because it is so simply and fast to make.  Plus it tastes great.  I made it for a social night and everyone loved it and wanted the recipe.  I'm not a big fan of tomatoes so I only added half of what the recipe calls for.

It's edible and met my craving for something cheesy and meaty however I don't have the desire to make it in the exact instructions again. Of course I used the optional jarred salsa instead of the diced tomatoes. Most of the reviews that really like it seem to use the Rotel diced tomatoes/chilies- so might try it one more time with that or might try it again and use actual tomatoes, green peppers and onions instead of canned or jarred sauce. Would suggest making only half a batch until you figure out if you like it....

I have made this dip several, several times and it is ALWAYS a big hit at parties.  My only variation - adding a small can of diced jalepanos, juice and all.  It gives it a huge kick, but everyone seems to love it because it's always gone!

This stuff can't get any better! I don't use the hot sausage but the original sausage and not even 8 oz of Velveeta.

This was a big hit.  I used a can of "hot" Rotel tomatoes.  At first it did seem like there was to much liquid but I kept it in a small crock pot and as the night went on it thickened up.  This was a breeze to make and yummy!

Awesome recipe! needs two lbs brick of Velveeta though, one lbs is way to thick. I used J.C. Potters breakfast sausage my family wolfed this one down

This is delicious!  It separated a little in my Crock Pot, but everyone at my cookie exchange loved it!

Fabulous recipe...but if you want to kick it up a notch....use chorizo instead of regular sausage!  Great with a spicy salsa!

I love this growing up but could not remember the ingredients. The only thing I did to improve was after the sausage was cooked I ground it in the food processor.  It gave the dip a great consistancy. THANKS

Great recipe! And my kids can do this whether I'm home or not.  We always use Ro-tel tomatoes. I add some cilantro for seasoning, though. It's a great party dip.

Made this dip for a football party (the night before) and put it out in a crock pot as someone else suggested and it was a big hit!  Nothing was left by half time.  Made it again and it was the first time I ever had guys asking for a recipe!

So easy and fantastic! I can't believe three ingredients can make up such a yummy dip. I made it the night before as some reviewer suggested. I used hot sausage and hot rotel w/ chilies. Everyone loved it and I will absolutely make it again.
