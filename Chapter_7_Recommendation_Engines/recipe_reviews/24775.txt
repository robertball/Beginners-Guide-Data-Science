These were fabulous...with my modifications.  Based on the other reviews, I used more garlic than the recipe called for.

I was only making this for 2 people, so I used one head of garlic and one pound of russet potatoes. 

I used seasoned salt and sea salt, then mashed the potatoes with the garlic, milk to desired consistency, and butter to taste (2-3 tbl).  Something was still missing.

I added 4 tbl of sour cream.  They tasted just like the garlic mashed potatoes that I have had in 5 star restaurants.

I served this with the Blue Cheese Crusted Filet Mignon w/Port Wine Sauce from this site (submitted by HebeGebe), a caeser salad, and a bottle of Stag's Leap 2003 Cabernet Sauvignon.

Amazing!

These are so yummy!  I roasted my head of garlic early in the day because my oven was going to be busy all afternoon.  I just squeezed it out into an air-tight containter and kept it covered, on the countertop for a few hours.  I used a mix of Yukon Gold and Red potatoes.  (I just don't like russet).  I also didn't measure the milk; just did it until it seemed right.  The garlic flavor really mellows out when it's roasted, so next time, I might even add more garlic.  Crazy, I know!  I might incorporate the roasted garlic part of this recipe into my fave taters from this site, Slow Cooker Mashed Potatoes.  Served with Roast Sticky Chicken from this site.  Sooo good!

These were SOOOOOO delicious.  Everyone raved about the wonderful flavor.  I used a small can of evaporated skim milk instead of regular milk to cut the fat but keep them creamy.  I will definitely make these again and again!

This recipe was reinforcement and a reminder that there is just no comparison between garlic mashed potatoes made with roasted garlic and those made simply by throwing some garlic cloves in with the potatoes and cooking water. Not EVEN comparing apples and apples. The garlic flavor is pronounced but mellowed out by roasting, mild and pleasantly nutty. There is a big reward for taking this extra step.  The biggest problem or effort is simply that of planning ahead.  I roasted my garlic early on in the day, then just left it in the aluminum foil until I was ready for it.  I stuck strictly with butter, no olive oil,  and probably double the amount of garlic, but this recipe's submitter has Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes down pat. This is the stuff you'd expect to find in the finest steakhouses.

This recipe is it!!  As per reviews, we roasted the garlic 30 minutes in the oven, and added the oil w/ the garlic.  We substituted light sour cream for the milk, and it was perfect!!!  Everyone had seconds or thirds at a large family dinner, with lots of other good food they could have had instead!  We wondered if we needed to do 2 cloves instead, but this was just right unless you wanted to have garlic with a little potatoes :-)  Thank you so much!!

These potatoes taste almost exactly like the ones my husband and I had on our honeymoon in Vegas...and let me tell you they cost a pretty penny.  Absolutely wonderful.  I will admit that if you are not a garlic lover, you may want to cut down on the amount...it is a bit strong, but it is just the way we like it.  I also took another reviewer's advice and added some parmesan cheese to it...wonderful idea.  Thanks for a great new side dish.

Delicious!!!!  Better than what I had in a restaurant this weekend.  The only thing I did different was to use red potatoes with their skins and canned milk instead of regular milk. Served with Garlic Lime Chicken and my company really liked them too.

This is an amazing recipe.  Keep an eye on your roasting garlic as half an hour works for me.  I have this when having Amy's Osso Buco.  Perfect match.

I'm never making regular mashed potatoes again! My family loved these at Thanksgiving dinner. I added another bulb of roasted garlic because we are true garlic-lovers. It was also a hit at the Christmas potluck (regular amount of garlic for that one). Be sure to keep an eye on the garlic because it doesn't look nice in the potatoes if it gets too browned.

I made these for 50 people. They all loved the potatoes. I roasted the garlic earlier in the day and then used a blender to add the garlic to the butter. That way I had garlic butter ready to add to the potatoes at mealtime and I did not have to worry about any of the garlic not getting mashed in thoroughly.This is a keeper.

I used red potatoes because I was out of russet, added a heap of sour cream like other posters suggested, and also stirred in some shredded parmesan, asiago, and romano cheese. They were amazing!

The star of our dinner. This was absolutely wonderful. I don't know why I don't make my mashed potatoes like this all the time. (Probably because I'd be as big as a house.) We loved these! I served these with Prairie Meatloaf and seasoned green beans.

I use red skinned potatoes and leave the skin on, no peeling is a huge plus. I also chop my garlic and cook it to just under a boil in cream with chives or chopped leeks to infuse the flovors. After mashing the potatoes I just add the cream with garlic and chives to the potatoes until they are the consistency I prefer and then season with salt and pepper.

All I can say is wow.  I've been depriving myself of mashed potatoes since I started my diet and these have few enough calories that I was able to squeeze them in.  I followed another reviewer's advice and used not one but 2 bulbs of garlic... so good.  Also as per others' advice, I used evaporated skim milk instead of regular.  Creamy and fat free.  These came out phenomenal.  Love it!

I had never roasted garlic before this recipe.  Who knew it would be so simple? I love garlic potatoes in restaurants and I never knew exactly how they got such wonderful garlic flavor in there.  This is it--simple, easy, and delicious!!

YUMMY!  I was using the oven for a chicken dinner tonight, so I thought it would be a good time to try this recipe and roast the garlic.  I cut off the tip of the garlic bulb before sprinkling it with olive oil.  My chicken got baked at 300 degrees and the garlic roasted nicely leaving it in an extra 15 minutes.  The smell of it roasting was mouth watering and the finished dish did not disappoint.  There were no leftovers!  In the future I plan to make it with red skin potatoes and leave the skins on.  Thank you Kathleen Burton for sharing such a YUMMY recipe!!

I made these potatoes for Thanksgiving and they were great! The only thing I did different was to cook the garlic earlier in the day and kept in the foil until I was ready for it. I will be making these again and again. Thank you for the fantastic recipe.

The roasted garlic paste makes all the difference. I add chives and truffle oil. Definitively sour cream instead of milk but don't forget the butter. This is perfect. Look no further for other mashed potatoes recipes.

Great recipe!  Well worth the minimal effort to roast the garlic.  I just threw mine in the oven in the morning for about 75 minutes, then kept it in the tin foil until I was ready to mash the potatoes.  We served these with grilled salmon and crisp tender asparagus.  Restaurant quality at home!

These were excellent!  Next time I will use more roasted garlic, though because the roasting did diminish the garlic flavor, but DON'T skip the roasting step.  The flavor of the roasted garlic was awesome.  At the last minute I realized the milk I had had soured so all I had was a small container of fat free half and half so I used that and it worked fine.

We were unhappy with the results. These were somewhat dry, necessitating more milk and butter. Also, despite having used to heads of roasted garlic and liberally seasoning, these were bland. How unfortunate- they were eaten however, as I had a gravy to serve with it. Will keep looking for a "true" garlic mashed potato recipe. Served with "Mushroom Slow Cooker Roast Beef" (made gravy from dripping/liquids) from AR.

Very simple and great flavor. I would recommend only to those who absolutely love roasted garlic. I added an additional head of garlic to my batch, it was well received by those who loved garlic. Next time I might replace the milk with buttermilk or sour cream for a different flavor.

Since I was just eating by myself, I thirded the recipe.  I cut down the baking time to 45 minutes for the garlic and added 1/3 cup of milk because I had no butter.  I also thought that there wasn't enough garlic flavor, which I think had to do with the fact that I just put the garlic in the potatoes without the oil, which probably had all the flavor. I would probably pour in all the oil with the garlic next time.

The family loved this recipe.  I made 5 lbs of mashed potatoes for 4 people and there was only enough leftover for two small helpings the next day.  I, too, added sour cream to mine as I always use sour cream in my mashed potatoes.

This was great.  The only change I made was to add a little more milk because I wanted the potatoes creamier.  I served this with "Stuffed Kielbasa" (also from this site) and it was fabulous!

A nice change from regular mashed potatoes.  Roasting the garlic gives it a milder taste that doesn't overpower these potatoes.  Definitely will make these again.

These were a hit with the boyfriend, and I enjoyed them as well. There was no milk in the house...or a potato masher...so I did the best I could. I'd say a great job actually for mashing 4 large russet potatoes with a fork!

I substituted a generous 1/4 cup sour cream instead of milk and added some weird fake butter stuff my boyfriend had in the fridge. The garlic head was small, but the flavor was good as I added some seasoned salt too. 

Overall, easy and yummy...a winner!

This was the first time we have tried roasted garlic mashed potatoes, and we really enjoyed them.  They are easy to make and had just the right amount of roasted garlic.

We love potatoes prepared this way and I found if I smash the garlic into a paste I achieve a lot more garlic taste throughout the potatoes.  I also like to use a potato masher because I love the small chunks of potato especially when using red potatoes.

These mashed potatoes were the best.  I used 2% milk and "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter" butter, to lower the calories.  They were so creamy and rich-tasting!  I'll definitely make them over and over again!!

The whole family loved these. I will not be making mashed potatoes any other way. I did use sourcream instead of milk and added some parmesan cheese but this would be delicious without these changes. Thanks for a great recipe that turns plain mashed potatoes into a heavenly side dish!

Surprisingly, I found these a little bland, maybe I needed more S&P.  And folks weren't thrilled with skins in the mashed potatoes.  I was asked to please stick to my plain old recipe from now on.

I'm the kind of person that if my job is to bring mashed potatoes it's not gonna be boring boxed mashed potatoes.  I have a terra cotta garlic baker in my cupboard I've never used...  I didn't know that baking garlic made such a difference BUT IT DOES! Oh my goodness.  This is gonna be my "go to" mashed potatoe recipe. No need for sour cream, sour cream, etc like so many recipes use. I love garlic and thought one clove head for about 6 russett potatoes was just fine.

For this year's Thanksgiving dinner, one of my relatives hinted that we should make garlic mashed potatoes as opposed to the plain version.  So, low and behold, I found this recipe.  The ingredients were simple, but perfect.  

I completely forgot to drizzle the garlic with the olive oil, but it's okay.  Another thing I did differently was that I microwaved the potatoes using the baked potatoes option on the machine (some microwave ovens have that option), which helps when one of your family members is an 11-month-old baby that requires a lot of supervision.

Now, one of the biggest mistakes that many people make when preparing mashed potatoes is that there's not enough salt and pepper.  It's very important to make sure your potatoes are seasoned properly so that they don't taste bland.  Notice that the recipe reads, "salt and pepper to taste".  With that said, taste your potatoes before you place them out on the table to serve.  If they taste dry, add a little more milk and butter to your recipe.  Otherwise, this recipe is absolutely superb.  My family (including myself) loved these mashed potatoes, and it's definitely one that's being entered into my recipe book. :)

Loved it and so did everyone else!  I don't think I will ever make regualer mashed potatoes again!  I was worried the garlic would be too strong, but it was PERFECT!  This was my first time making roasted garlic and I am HOOKED!  GREAT RECIPE!!

These potatoes were awesome... i did add a little Parmesan cheese after reading some of the other reviews and it was definitely a nice touch. These are the kind of mashed potatoes that are better without gravy! They are simple and delicious! although waiting for the garlic can be a pain!

We loved these potatoes!! So much that we didn't have any leftovers! The garlic wasn't overpowering at all. And like I've done with all of my mashed potatoes, I add a scoop of sour cream for the creamy-ness! DELICIOUS!

Awesome.  I used more garlic because we just love garlic.  Roasted garlic is my favorite.  I roasted a few more heads of garlic and spread them on French bread.

Oh so good!!! I didn't change a thing and the potatoes turned out to be the best my hubby and I have ever eaten. You wouldn't think just the addition of roasted garlic to potatoes would make such a big difference but, boy, does it!!!! I served them with a tossed salad and Marinated Grilled Shrimp which is also on this site. Hubby was in heaven and I was thrilled. Thank you so much for the recipe. I won't ever make "just plain" mashed potatoes again! Oops, I did do one thing differently. I never cook my potatoes in salted water. When you cook veggies with salt, it can  cause them to cook unevenly, causing you to end up with lumpy mashed potatoes. Besides, it's much easier to control the amount of salt if you add it after cooking, which is very important to many people. It doesn't have any effect on the taste of the potatoes either.

Had my brother over for dinner last night & he requested roasted garlic mashed potatoes like my mom used to make, since I didn't have Momma's recipe-I chose this one...boy it hit the spot! The only thing I did different was topped the finished potatoes with cheddar/mozz. cheese mix & browned it before serving. Perfect, just like momma used to make it!

Excellent recipe!  I only roasted the garlic for half an hour and that was enough time.  I used new potatoes so I didn't have to peel them.  I used probably half the butter and also added about 2 oz. of cream cheese for a little extra richness.  I didn't measure the milk, but 1/2 cup sounds about right.  These were fantastic!  We had them with sausage & peppers.  Delicious!  Thanks for the recipe.

Add cream cheese for extra creaminess. It's the best secret ingredient you'll ever use for mashed potatoes!

This imparted such a nice mild garlic flavor to everyday mashed potatoes.  I may add more garlic next time, but this made a great side with grilled swordfish. I added a touch of cream in addition to the milk to make them extra creamy. Thank you for posting this recipe!

I double this recipe and throw in a brick of cream cheese, and I do not peel the potatoes for a nice rustic mashed potato. My family loves them.

Delicious!  The roasted garlic really makes this recipe!  I "smashed" the potatoes, using red potatoes and leaving the skins on, instead of blending them until creamy. But this is just a personal preference.

Very nice just as it is. 
I was feeling creative so I added a teaspoon of crushed dried rosemary, some white pepper and a quarter cup of Parmesan. I also made them with red skinned potatoes and left the skin on.
Very good!!

eta to make it easier to get the garlic cloves out, slice off about 1 to 1.5 inch off the top of the head of garlic. after cooking, you can squeeze the bulbs out by the bottom.

This recipe is the closest thing I've found to match the mash potatoes made at Texas Land and Cattle Company Steak House.  I'll never eat plain mash potatoes again!

really good, I added a third cup of parmesan cheese to the mix then sprinkled the top with some more for extra depth then added more milk for desired creaminess and skipped the electric mixer because we like ours a little lumpy. so yummy!!

This recipe is good, however, the garlic did not mix into the potatoes.  Next time I will mash the garlic up before I add to the potatoes.  Then, I will mash it all together.

Good recipe but bland, needed some tweaking...definitely need to add a lot of salt/pepper for flavor and a SECOND full head of garlic, the flavor is not overwhelming at all. I added one at a time just to make sure it wasn't going to be a disaster! Also looked up a few other mashed potatoes recipe and the ingredients included 4oz of either sour cream of cream cheese for a creamier texture...so I ended up adding that, DEFINETLY helped a lot! You can make this healthy by using "I cant believe its not butter" butter...and fat free cream cheese like I did, my picky boyfriend ate it!...this recipe is a keeper with the minor tweakings! ENJOY :)

used 2 heads of roasted garlic, roasted garlic at 400 degrees for 35-45mins. // I prefer smashed potatoes so I blended the roasted garlic with a little bit of the cooked potatoes with a small food processor then added the mix into the rest of the smashed potatoes.  // Added 2-3 TB sour cream, as well.

Oh, so yummy!  This recipe is definitely a keeper.  My husband and I ate most of the potatoes because my kids don't like mashed potatoes...silly rabbits!  I did not measure anything and it was great.  I used red potatoes because they are my fav and it was still so good.  I think there is room for variation with this recipe and they should still be fabulous!

Made this with bacon wrapped pork medallion recipe from this site and asparagus.  I did tweek the recipe a little by combining it with the garlic mashed potato secret recipe by austad from this site.  Prepared the potatoes, roasted the garlic bulb in the oven and added to potatoes by mashing together.  Added the 1/2-3/4 cup sour cream and 1 tbsp of butter and some oregano.  Also added some shredded romano cheese (from the Austad's recipe).  Salt and Pepper.  I did not add the milk or process in a blender.  Fiance really liked this recipe!

Oh, so delicious! I used more garlic than called for and will use even more next time. Keep in mind that I am not a garlic fanatic and don't usually use more than is called for in a recipe, so this addition really was necessary. Otherwise, it was wonderful! They reminded me of potatoes I would get in a steakhouse. : )  I will definitely make these again.

I followed the recipe and my potatoes turned out great! Roasting the garlic this way was easy and clean-up was a breeze. I did make this for 4 people, so next time I would use 2 heads of garlic instead since I love the taste of garlic. For 2 people 1 head of garlic would be enough. I also had to cook my garlic at 300F because I already had something in the oven, but only cooked it for 45 minutes. So its important to watch the cooking time.

I made these originally in 2009 and gave it 3 stars.  I actually forgot I made these, so I looked at this with a new set of eyes, and also used 45 minutes cooking time for 2 bulbs of garlic.  This time I will simply say...amazing.  I don't eat mashed potatoes, however my children and husband loved it.  Thanks again for posting this recipe.

This is my "go-to" mashed potato recipe.  The roasted garlic is a nice surprise when guests are only expecting potatoes.  I've also added a cup of fresh grated romano cheese before blending the hot potatoes so it melts into the recipe - OH, it's so good!

These turned out great. I topped my garlic with the olive oil, but I also added some salt, pepper, and rosemary.  It gave the potatoes a little extra flavor. I also used buttermilk instead of regular milk. I'll definitley be making these again!

These was soo good!!

Based on other reviews, I also added a tablespoon of sour cream, and some chives on top.

Amazing!  I even used the leftovers to make a shepherd's pie the next day.

This was exactly what I was looking for. I used chicken stock to flavor/salt it up a bit... added the sour cream that another reviewer noted to make it creamier/milkier with a little tang. Delicious! Made it with salisbury steak and broccoli! Yum!!!

These were very good mashed potatoes!  The only thing I changed was to leave the skin on the potatoes, since we like it that way.  Next time I make these the only thing I would do differently is to double the amount of roasted garlic.

These were FABULOUS.  I, too, added some sour cream and they were perfect, just like I've had in restaurants.  There was a fair bit left over which I'm looking forward to make into potatoe pancakes.  Will definitely use this recipe again.

As long as the oven is going for just a little bit of garlic, pop the meat in the oven at the same time, of course.  Meatloaf, chicken, chops, anything.  Or bake a pie at the same time.  These potatoes are good, but even better with a little parmesan cheese thrown in, or even french onion dip.  Go ahead and experiment!

I'll make it again for sure.  I only used 3 med/sm potatoes, and half the garlic.  Next time, I'll use all the garlic for this much, but I love garlic.  Then I put the mashed potatoes in ramekins with corn flake crumbs on top.  Topped each with a Tbs of butter, and then into the oven until browned on top.  Really turned out good.

Yummy! I took one reviewer's suggestion and used sour cream instead of milk. They turned out really great. Next time I'll double the roasted garlic though because one head of garlic only gave them a slight garlic flavor. Thanks!

Perfect; have to say when making mashed potatoes I don't measure my butter or milk, I just add until I get the consistency and flavour I'm looking for. I probably put in 1/4 c butter and closer to 3/4 c milk for this quantity potatoes. Paired them with NY strips and sauteed mushrooms.....delish!

Simply delicious! I made a 10 lb batch for Christmas dinner. Followed recipe except there's no need to measure milk of course. May add more garlic next time around. The secret to this recipe is the roasted garlic! I will never skip this step! So good. This side dish was wiped out :)

Absolutely Perfect! Only variation I suggest is cut potatoes before boiling, to make the softening of the potatoes quicker.

Very tasty! I did not measure out my potatoes so mine were not as garlic-y as I would have liked, but if I had followed the recipe exactly i'm sure I would have liked them better. I used about 5.5 pounds of potatoes and doubled the amount of garlic and used heavy whipping cream instead of milk, just because I like my potatoes really thick and creamy. overall, superb recipe. My family really liked them.

AMAZING! I love it! The flavor of the roasted garlic is so addictive!!! I use 2 heads of garlic, just because I'm a serious garlic lover. I was a little worried about how to squeeze out my garlic cloves into the potatoes, but you can't mess it up even if you tried! If you'd like to add some sour cream, that's more fat but more deliciousness. :) If you're a garlic lover, you've GOT to have this recipe!

This is sooo good with the roasted garlic. Used redskin potatoes and they were nice and creamy. I made them a few hours prior to dinner and put in the fridge in a Corning crock. Took them out and roasted them with the meat, stirred and served; nice and easy! I roasted the garlic the day before, made into a paste and stored it in a small cup in the fridge until ready to use.

A great recipe to liven up the mashed potatoes. I cut back a bit on the butter and added some sour cream. The roasted garlic made this recipe happen for my family.

I used an entire head of garlic for four servings and also added a little sour cream.  Very good!  However, just like another reviewer said, the garlic taste does diminish once it’s roasted, so next time I will likely add more garlic and a bit more sour cream.

These were excellent!! I cut the pointy end off of the head of garlic so that you could just barely see the unpeeled garlic underneath and roasted with olive oil as the recipe said. The only change that I made was using more garlic (almost too much garlic! lol) and using 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk. I also added parmesan cheese, and I added some dried parsley. Excellent!! These are being put in the Sunday dinner rotation.

This was very good. I roasted the garlic earlier. The cloves were soft and mushy, just mixed right in with the potatoes. I used sour cream instead of milk. It made the potatoes very creamy.

WOW! These were to die for. Followed the recipe but I used red potatoes b/c that's what I had on hand and they turned out wonderfully. Definitely a keeper! Thanks for sharing!

These were great! I made them for a graduation dinner and there were none left. I was in a hurry and did not measure properly so I cannot comment on proper seasoning in the recipe...but all the ingredients together made a great tater! My 1 year old DEVOURED them and screamed for more!

These were very good - though I used more potatoes (about 3 pounds instead of 2) for my head of garlic and used cream instead of milk. Still, very tasty!

This is really wonderful. I made the recipe as is. Good to know you can add little touches to kick it up a notch . But this is a fool proof recipe. I will be doing this again and again.

This was great.  The only change I made was mixing in parmesan cheese because I felt there was an element missing from the dish.

These are awesome! I have made them many times and always get comments on them. I have tried various additions, but the one thing I consistently add is shredded cheese. I always stir some in and then sprinkle some extra on the top. You can make these ahead and microwave them before serving, and they're still great.

Delicious! I add the olive oil from the roasted garlic packet to the potatoes to increase the garlic flavor. Great combined with chicken marsala.

This came out suprisingly good to be so easy. I cooked this up as a last minute side dish for a Saturday. It's been a while since roasting my own garlic but the house smelled just fantastic. This is a keeper. Would give an extra 5 stars just for the ease of preparation. Used Silk Milk for allergy reasons here and things came out just fine.

This was my first time making homemade mashed potatoes, and boy did they turn out great!  I followed the recipe exactly.  Next time, though, I'm going to use Yukon golds or red potatoes, as I'm not a big fan of russet.

These were fantastic and very easy! I roasted the garlic for about 35 min and added a little mayo in addition to the other ingredients.  Even my picky husband liked them and he does not like homemade mashed potatoes.

I made these for Thanksgiving,  using a whole roasted head of garlic that I'd roasted the day before.  Also, I had 3 lbs. of Yukon Gold peeled potatoes, 1 whole cube of butter and half and half, rather than milk.  Delicious!  I put the finished potatoes in a slow cooker for transportation and serving. That worked well,  ( I did have to use my electric mixer for mashing, because my ricer broke, but I now have a new ricer, my preferred smooth masher tool.)

Pretty much to the recipe. Came out awesome. The Mrs. kept inquiring about roasting the garlic first and, although it was messy, had a flavor so much different than how I usually do it.

I made this today,  4/12/19. I went exactly by the recipe. It was good. I believe it could use a little more garlic flavor,  just my preference. I will make this again but will roast another whole bulb of garlic. Thank you for sharing your recipe.

Wow! These are good! I felt like I was at a restaurant rather than my own kitchen.  Make sure to let the garlic get a good hour of cooking.

Loved these. I cooked the garlic on the stove top for a few minutes with oil instead of using the oven. Who knew I didn't have aluminum foil. Still tasted amazing!

This recipe is wonderful. I used a potato ricer rather than a blender and it made it fluffy. I double the garlic and added 4 TBS as other suggested.  The roasted garlic is a great touch and is not heavy at all.

Made it exactly what the recipe stated. It turned out bland and the olive oil didn't help any. As for a few other reviews, I'm finding another recipe.

I made this dish for my husband's birthday dinner this year. It was my very first attempt at homemade mashed potatoes (the store bought are just so quick and easy). I did the recipe as stated (except maybe added a little extra garlic). When I roasted the garlic, it was already separated into cloves. I used 2% milk because I had some already for another recipe. It turned out great. We still had to add extra salt and pepper individually. So, I can be a little more aggressive with my seasoning in the future. Will definitely make this one again.

I tried this recipe twice. The first time I followed the recipe exactly and couldn't taste any garlic at all. I added extra garlic the second time I made the recipe and it still wasn't that great. I'll be looking for a different recipe.

I'm not sure what I was thinking listening to the directions to use an electric mixer. The taste is nice but they came out like glue. Bad idea, should've just put in the extra work and mashed them. Trust me, using a mixer may have been faster but they were still full of lumps so I had to reheat it and add more milk to get them out.

I decided to use this recipe instead of the other garlic mashed potatoes recipe that has over 1k reviews simply because there are more instructions here and that SHOULD be part of the recipe! Anyways. This was delicious. I used 4lbs of russet potatoes -- no need to peel them as the skin comes right off in the boiling water. I used 2 medium heads of roasted garlic and I thought it had the perfect undertones of garlic. I know some other reviewers said it wasn't enough garlic for them but who really wants garlic breath when in a group of people? haha anyways, I liked it. Will use this recipe again.

this was pretty dry and lacking something.. i cut the recipe in half.. and doubled the milk (almond) and added an extra tablespoon of margarine (instead of butter).. i used a whole head of garlic.. salt and pepper-ed the hell out of this and added some italian seasoning.. i used russets but i think yukon gold would have been better..

These potatoes were very good! I made them early and then zapped them at the last minute! I think the garlic used the extra time to really add flavor to the dish!
I did not want to get stuck in the kitchen at the last minute mashing potatoes! Worked fine!

These were amazing!! I did add more garlic and I chopped the potatoes before boiling them to save on time. Super easy, super yummy!! This recipe even became a favorite with my 8 year old.

At the wifes request I used sour cream instead of milk.  It was my first time making mashed potatoes (or roasting garlic for that matter).  It was easy and delicious.

I made these for Thanksgiving this year and they were a big hit. I also made a vegan version with vegan butter and soy milk- which were also surprisingly delicious.

Delicious, but I made a few changes. As we keep kosher I made it non-dairy using Margarine instead of Butter and Vanilla Almond Milk in place of Milk. It is soooooo good!! I also added some garlic powder as the roasted garlic wasn't enough. For those who want to do non-dairy, enjoy!!!

Needs more than 1 bulb of garlic, I would roast about 3 bulbs  of garlic, too bland, but otherwise great.

My family and guests loved it.  I took the tips from another reviewer and added sour cream.  I only rough mashed the potatoes with a hand masher.  Will do again.

These were good and easy to do.  I should have used more garlic but will definitely do these again.  Nothing like whipped potatoes.  Reminds me of Grandma.

These were FANTASTIC Kathleen!  Everyone raved about them and wanted more! (We ran out) I only made a couple of small changes.  As I was cooking the potatoes in the boiling water, I added a big sprig of rosemary from my garden.  Then I slid off some of the rosmary leaves as I was mashing the potatoes.  I used the amount of garlic called for.  It was perfect!  Also I used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of milk.

One more note:  I doubled the recipe as we has 10 people.  It should have made 16 serving according to the recipe.  All 10 of us quickly polished off the bowl and wished for more, despite all the other good food!  I think the orriginal recipe might serve 5-6 if you're lucky.

These were really good!  I guess I cooked the garlic too long though?  There wasn't anything to "squeeze" out of them - they were just mush!  So I just mashed them up along with the potatoes which gave them such a great garlic flavor.  We loved it!

Wonderful potatoes!  This was exactly what I was looking for and the recipe has the quantities down perfectly.  I cheated a bit and left the skins on my potatoes and just mashed them right up in to the mixture.  It adds texture and fibre, hehe!

Excellent. I also added some Parmesean cheese and some garlic salt. The roasted garlic is the key as it adds a delicious garlic flavor without overwhelming. I used margarine and non-fat half and half.

Yum! I used only one head of garlic for 5 lbs of potatoes and my twelve year old said they needed more garlic! But I thought they were fine. I'll be making this again.

Yummy. I roasted the garlic in the morning as the oven was busy later. Make sure its warm when served(:

Very good, but I doubled the amount of garlic and it was just right.

Delicious! Though I opted to chop the top off my head of garlic and roast it for 30 mins uncovered. Definitely gives everything that wonderful garlic smell. My husband thought there was a little too much garlic, but I suppose that will always be something we disagree about!

Made this recipe but used 2 med heads of garlic and light cream. It was good but could have used more garlic.

So yummy and extraordinarily easy.  I am looking forward to having some of the leftovers as a midnight snack. :)  I made them as called for, but I didn't measure the milk, butter, or olive oil.

Kathleen, this was excellent! Took others suggestions and used more garlic and a bit more butter. Went well with our roasted chicken last night. Thanks!

These were really good, however, I prefer a little more butter and the addition of oregano would have been nice. Thanks.

I thought these potatoes were really good.  My husband liked the ones without the garlic better though he usually loves garlic.  A little girl said that they needed even more garlic.  I am on her side I will try to use more garlic next time.  Thanks for the recipe.

I normally get my 12 year old daughter to make the taters while I cook the other stuff. Gives us some bonding time and she is interested in cooking.She is "famous" around the house for her mashed potato's. I made these tonight and she decided I should make the potato's from now on. These were very good but I think I'll teach her to make them and let her keep the job :)

I've been making potatoes this way for years.  I use a potato ricer for both the potatoes and the garlic, and it always turns out great.

Oh my gosh, delicious! I used the insides of baked potatoes that I needed the skins for to make potato skins. Then I used this recipe to make the stuffed kielbasa recipe from this site. All three recipes are keepers!!

I definitely loved this recipe, but next time I will add more salt or garlic salt and I won't peel the potatoes since it is more nutritious with the skin.  Thank you!

Excellent potatoes!! I used half and half instead of milk because I think it makes the potaoes more creamier, but everything else was exact.

I was really disappointed with this recipe.  I guess I just prefer regular mashed potatoes.  The garlic was a little too overpowering (and I love garlic).
