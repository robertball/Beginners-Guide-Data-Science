I just started baking. I'm seventeen and I'm just trying to find recipes that will be good for my family when I get responsible enough to have one..=D..so I cooked my mom dinner saturday night and made these as dessert and they are FABULOUS right out of the oven when they are still a little warm yet. I went light on the oats because I added raisins to half of the batch-MISTAKE. The ones ROLLED IN the powdered sugar didn't even taste like oatmeal cookies when cooled but the ones i didn't roll in the confectioners' sugar tasted like oatmeal. MY ADVICE: add all the oats add raisins if you want don't use the confectioners' sugar. these are amazing and the best oatmeal cookies my mom said she'd ever had and oatmeal are her favorite. 3 These made me thirty (30) cookies I don't ever think the serving amount is correct. I pulled them out a bit earlier and still days later they are super moist. Delish. Will definately make again--THANKS.!

I hate to give a negative review but I thought I had a very sweet tooth. I love sugar but these were like taking a teaspoonful of sugar and putting it in your mouth. Definietly not disgusting cookies goodness knows my kids LOVED them but it's the first time anything has been to sugary for me.

These are the best oatmeal cookies I have ever made or tasted. I chilled the dough for 3 hours and I rolled it lightly in 10x sugar-the self made glaze is terrific. They are chewy not cake like. I highly recommend this recipe.

This is a great recipe.... the cookies covered with the confectioners sugar take on a delicate texture. My kids really liked them..... and they are picky about oatmeal cookies.... I added golden raisins coconut and white choc chips.... yum!

Wonderful cookies. Be careful to not overbake. I learned from my first batch that they should only be baked for about 8 minutes just until they are set. Watch closely.

Not convinced these cookies make their own frosting. The only thing on top of the cookies is some remnants of the powdered sugar. That aside though these are pretty good cookies. I didn't think they were too sweet and I like the fact that you can use oil bc if I ever run out of shortening or margarine these will be my go to oatmeal cookies. I don't think they are too greasy. Thanks for the recipe!

These did "frost" themselves. They were okay. Came out dry and crunchy. They did not spread while baking. Good flavor but not a chewy tender cookie. Probably won't make these again.

The cookies turned out great. The one problem I encountered (and easily corrected) was putting too much powdered sugar on the cookies. If you put too much on it won't melt into the cookies and you're left with big white patches not icing. Just make sure to pat off all the loose powdered sugar and you'll be fine! Everyone loved these cookies. They're chewy with the perfect amount of crisp. The texture is very good and the taste is perfect.

I made these about 2 hours ago and they were terrible when they came out of the oven. 1 hour later they were still sub-par. 2 hours later they were very good. Don't give into the normal tempatation to eat them directly out of the oven because they don't taste good. Give 'em time....

I agree that the flavor is nice - esp. with butterscotch chips added - but I guess I'm the only one who thought they were a bit greasy. I've never made cookies with oil before... not sure I'll want to again.

Um... They were cookies. I tried these cookies because I am out of butter and my margarine wasn't softened. I can hold my own when it comes to sugar and I felt these were too sweet. Also I concur with the 'greasy' feeling. The oil while interesting made well oily cookies. I wonder how they'd do substituting applesauce for half to all of the oil... We dished them with a cookie scoop and rolled them into 'walnut-sized' balls; they did not bake in 8-10 minutes - they probably took 13. They receive a 3-star rating because my husband liked them but I assure you I won't waste ingredients on this recipe again (unless it's a half batch to test the applesauce theory).

These cookies were very good! I did not use the extra sugar to coat the cookies. The cookies were sweet enough without it. Also I did as another reader advised and added butterscotch chips. Next time I will try it without the extra chips. The recipe did not not make as much as indicated...chef's fault...as I ate more of the dough (better than chocolate chip cookie dough!)

These are good cookies but very sweet. I even tried not putting the powdered sugar on them and it didn't make much difference. If you like really sweet cookies these are good and easy to make.They would make a good Holiday cookie.

I just made these cookies. Can someone tell me if I did something wrong? First of all it was very hard to stir in the oatmeal. then they did not bake in 10 minutes it was more like 15-20. I followed the recipe to the t. They were very good though. I want to make them again.

These are SWEET and I even cut the white sugar down to 1/4 c based on other reviews saying these were too sweet. My husband liked them and said they reminded him of eating oatmeal as a kid so I averaged his 5 stars with my 1 star to rate these at 3. They did take longer to cook and the powdered sugar kind of glazed in some areas and in others it didn't. They did get a nice "crackled" appearance kind of like Snickerdoodles and are a thick "puffy" cookie.

I REALLY DIDN'T CARE FOR THESE COOKIES. THEY ARE TOO SWEET AND GREASY. I WOULD RATHER HAVE OLD-FASHION OATMEAL COOKIES. THE POWDERED SUGAR DIDN'T TURN TO FROSTING JUST EXTRA SUGAR. NOT GOOD.

these cookies were AWESOME. They dissapeared in 2 hours from the cookie jar. But one thing is my parents thought they were too sweet so next time I'm not going to roll them in confectioners sugar. These cookies are good with nuts or chocolate chips too

Too sweet for my liking! They tasted like Frosted Flakes Cereal without milk. The dough was sticky if I rolled it into balls and let it sit for a moment before I dusted the tops with the confectioners' sugar. I added 1/8 tsp. of cinnamon - but these were very sugary - I was only able to give 2 stars.

I liked these cookies a lot but I changed the recipe a bit. I only had about a 1/4c of brown sugar so I added cinnamon nutmeg ground cloves and raisins to add some sweetness and spice. I only used about 2/3 cup oil and replaced 1/2 cup of the flour with whole wheat flour. The cookies stayed in their little ball form which meant I had to cook them for about 13 mins. but they were worth the extra little wait. I wouldn't say they self frost though however I did like the sugar coating on them so I'm pleased.

WOW! These cookies are delicious!!! I read all of the suggestions & I did add golden raisins & white chocolate chips. I wanted to add coconut but didn't have any so I added pineapple instead & these cookies melt in your mouth! I followed the rest of the recipe to a T. They need to be cold or they spread when you are cooking them. I made the balls & kept them in the freezer until i was ready for them. Tried some without the powdered sugar too & they were great both ways! Will definitely be making these over & over again!

These are wonderful cookies. Easy to make (I'm not much of a cook) and everyone loves them! I had the same problem with the powdered sugar not turning into icing but obviously I used to much. I'll get it right next time. But either with powedered sugar topping or icing topping they are wonderful.

This is the oatmeal cookie recipe for people who do not like oatmeal cookies! I was VERY skeptical when I saw this recipe but I am surrounded by folks who love oatmeal cookies. When I read through it it didn't make sense to me (I tend to over think things) but the end results really good. The kids liked it as much as the adults --they loved it because it reminded them of their childhood. I took them out a little before they were done because everyone wanted a really soft cookie.

Quick and easy recipe resulting in a delicious cookie. Definitely not a healthy one but seemingly a reliable recipe. Followed exact recipe with the exception of the 2 hour refrigeration. Popped the bowl in the freezer for 30 minutes and it seemed to work well in reducing spreading during baking. I baked 2 sheets at once and added 6 minutes to the recommended 12 resulting in a slightly browned edge on both upper and lower cookie sheets. The single sheet I baked next took the recommended time.

I LOVE these cookies. I see someone mentioned they were too sweet well you just need to skip rolling them in powdered sugar but to me they are great just as is. All I did differently was added dried cranberries and followed the recipe exactly. I think I will make them with margarine next time. I calculated it out and they are about 120 calories each. These are a keeper and I will make frequently.

I was hoping for a quick and easy cookie recipe. I skipped the sugar rolling after reading how they were too sweet but they were still overly-sweet anyways. They didn't spread out at all while baking they're just oatmeal cookie lumps. Will never bake again. Very disappointed.

We will always love our traditional oatmeal cookies but these made for a delicious and interesting change! I made them with corn oil instead of vegetable for a friend who is temporarily on a no dairy or soy diet. I tested out the recipe on my husband who promptly ate so many of the batch I had to make another for my friend! These are a great alternative when you're looking for something a little different. The powdered sugar "icing" is not only tasty it makes for a gorgeous cookie with a crackled top.
