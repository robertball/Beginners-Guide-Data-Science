This is delicious!  I did use a big can (28 oz) of petite diced tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes, and angel hair instead of vermicelli.  Also, since I was using canned tomatoes, I only sprinkled a little salt, instead of the 1 Tablespoon called for.  I topped with sliced blackened chicken (recipe from this site), and my husband and son loved it...couldn't believe it was all low fat.  The only change I would make in the future is to put in less pasta, and to use whole wheat pasta.  I used 16 oz pasta.....would probably use 8-10 oz. instead next time.  Delicious!  Will definitely make again.  By the way, the cajun seasoning I used was "Slap Ya Mama" from Ville Platte, Louisiana.  I have found it here in the Gulf Coast of Texas, and saw it on vacation once in Destin, Florida (slapyamama.com).  I like it because it's not as salty as some other popular brands of cajun seasoning.

This was a fantastically fresh alternative to ordinary pasta sauce.  I added some extra veggies (zucchini, spinach and mushrooms) and it made a tasty primavera.  Bravo!

This is really great. I have made this recipe many many times! I am just finally getting around to reviewing it. My husband asks for this often. The fresh taste of tomatoes accented by the Cajun seasoning. Yum Yum. I always use Penne pasta. It just seems to go nicely with the sauce. (I actually donâ€™t care too much for vermicelli pasta; I like to really taste and feel the texture of my noodles -and vermicelli lacks that for me.)

I did use several cloves of minced garlic instead of measuring out teaspoons. I also used a homemade Cajun seasoning blend and omitted the additional salt. Oh, man. This is to DIE FOR. My family loved this pasta dish--we fought over the leftovers.

I added some fresh basil to this recipe, along with chicken and shrimp, and it was quite good. I think more tomatoes than recommended would be better next time.

This is a very easy to make recipe that is great when you are short on time.  The cajun spice mix you use is everything to the recipe, so choose wisely.

I had to restrain myself from eating too much of this tonight. Yeah, it was that good.  I sauteed some sweet mini peppers before adding the garlic and tomatoes just for a little more interest and complexity. The Cajun seasoning I used was Coleen Deon's "Cajun Spice Mix," also from this site, and I was very pleased with it.  In addition to the olive oil I added butter as well, which made this silky and rich.  Loved the addition of the two cheeses, but don't be tempted to add too much mozzarella or you'll risk making this stringy.

Very good! I reduced the salt to 2 tsp, used 2 tsp of dried parsley and subbed monteray jack for the mozzarella cos that is what I had. Turns out really well, especially since I cooked it in my large electric skillet, there was plenty of room to toss everything together. This recipe doesn't suffer from the "not quite enough tomatoes" problem that some do.

Mmm this is amazing!  I one-and-a-halfed this (not quite doubled it if that makes any sense), so I chopped 3 tomatoes to go along with one 28oz can of diced tomatoes.  I added more minced garlic than the revised proportions called for, and replaced the salt with freshly ground pepper.  My only qualm was too much mozzarella cheese, due to personal preference, so next time I'll decrease.  But wow- amazing dish, a keeper! Thanks :D

Delicious!  One of the best things I've made in a while.  I used regular tomatoes because I wanted to make sure there was enough juice.  In a pinch, you could easily use canned diced tomatoes.  It's a definite make-again.

this is so good!  probably the best dish i've tried on this website.  i used canned diced tomatoes and it was still amazing.  i also simmered the tomato mixture for about 20 minutes to get rid of the watery consistency that comes from any diced tomatoes, simply because i dont like watery/liquidy pasta dishes.  delicious!

This recipe was great, my only complaint was that the tomato sauce was a little too salty, but that may vary depending on the Cajun seasoning used...I used Emeril's.  Other than that, this was great!  I served it with Cajun chicken on top.  I will definitely make this again, with maybe a tad less salt.

Nice light pasta dish and very quick to put together which is a definite plus. I enjoyed it, but for some reason it didn't really "wow" my taste buds. I will make again when I am in the mood for a light pasta dish though. I also tossed in some grilled Cajun Chicken (recipe also on this site) as LTH suggested. Made a good lunch. Thanks for sharing.

I thought this dish was.. ok.  I was really excited to make it because of the other reviews, but it just wasn't that good to us..  My husband only ate half of his because he thought it had no flavor.  I ate it all, but would've preferred just regular spaghetti sauce, it just didn't have anything special to it.  I'm not sure why though, maybe it was cause I used whole wheat noodles, but the mozz and parmesan all kind of stuck together in clumps, so it was hard for the cheese flavor to get distributed throughout..  I really wanted to like this, so I was sad it didn't get such rave reviews from our family.

Even though I made a few mods and mine should be called "Cajun Pasta CANNA", I'm still reviewing this cause it shows how versatile it is.  I had a box of whole wheat penne I wanted to use, so I used that in place of vermicelli.  I did not have any fresh tomatoes, so I subbed 2 14.5 oz cans of diced.  I added a couple of slices of onion, diced to the EVOO/garlic.  I also added some pre-grilled/shredded chicken that had been marinated in Cajun Chicken marinade (from here on AR).  I actually measured the cheeses (and used slightly less) to keep the calorie count down and this was a great weeknight meal.  It's nothing I'd serve company, but we WILL eat this again. Next time, I think I'll add some spinach to get some veggies.

This is good and healthy - will make again.  I added mushrooms, zucchini squash, and shredded carrots.  I left out the mozzarella and used shaved parmesan.  My hubby who is a meat eater enjoyed it.  Definitely add the cajun seasoning - it gives it a nice kick!

I liked this dish even more than I expected to!  I have tried similar recipes, as they look good and healthy to me.  Often though, we don't like them as much as we expected to.  This recipe was different.  Most of all, I liked the way that the cheese coated the pasta.  Other times I seem to end up with clumps of cheese and other parts of the dish with no cheese.  This was wonderfully creamy. I also really liked the kick from the creole seasining.  I made my own and it was perfect!  The only change I made was to cut the salt added to the tomatoes to about 1 teaspoon.  We didn't miss the extra salt at all with all the flavor from the tomatoes and creole seasoning.  Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe!

I used spaghetti pasta, Italian-style canned tomatoes, and added more seasoning.  I also let the tomatoes cook for about 15 minutes.

This was very good and healthy. I did make a couple of changes just because of what I had available. I didn't have roma tomatoes so I diced up fresh tomatoes and used V8 juice in place of liquid from the canned tomatoes. I also added a sweet red bell pepper & onion and sauteed those with the garlic. I didn't have mozzarella cheese so just sprinkled Parmesan cheese on individuals plates.   I cooked blackened chicken (like another review suggested) along with this.   My husband really liked this and it is hard to cook something that he really likes and asks me to make again.

GREAT recipe!  The only change I made was to add some chicken.  I cooked the chicken in the olive oil with some of the seasoning, then removed it from the pan and followed the recipe as directed, adding the chicken back in the last minute the tomatoes were cooking.  I also couldn't find whole wheat vermicelli, so I used whole wheat thin spaghetti.  I used Mrs. Dash Extra Spicy seasoning to cut back on some of the salt.  I will definitely make this again!  I might try it this winter with canned petite diced tomatoes...  Easy, yummy and healthy!

Excelent and versatile! I use whole wheat pasta and do not use the Mozzerella to make it a bit lighter.  This one makes my family's favorites rotation!

This is 4 stars as written for me, but it could be 5 stars with just a few tweeks - adding some veggies and chicken perhaps?  Very tasty as is.  It was more of a side dish without anything extra added.

I made this the other night for my partner, who loves Italian food. It was simple to follow. I did add some marinara sauce to the 14 Roma Tomatoes to give me a little more sauce, all in all it was a GREAT night. I used cayenne pepper because I forgot the Cajun spice while I was at the market, I also added HOT Italian sausages. It was fantastic.

Very tasty. I made my own cajun seasoning. Next time, I'll cut down on the salt (it's quite a bit when you add the seasoning, added salt, plus cheese).

I just made this for dinner. I used whole wheat pasta and added shrimp, which I tossed in a teaspoon of my homemade cajun seasoning. I didn't have mozzarella, so I used parmesan and harvati. I cut waaay back on the amount of olive oil, the tomato juices were enough to do the trick. Also added chopped cilantro. This is definitely a fresh, healthy, easy, and delicious dinner.

When I first looked at this recipe I thought it looked amazing. As I was preparing this I got nervous that it would be too salty, blandish, with cheese covering up the taste. Not so. I love this recipe it is a new spaghetti alternative. I didn't use 16oz noodles I thought that was too much. I did around 10-12oz and it seems perfect. I also used less cheese because I really like my foods with a spicy kick and this allowed that. Overall, thanks for the recipe it is something I will definitely make in the future!

This turned out good.  I added blackened chicken from this website and used the cajun seasoning also found on this website.

Everyone enjoyed this very much!  I used regular tomatoes because that's what I had, and 1.5x the spice.  The cheese was hard to stir in and got a little clumpy, so I added just a sprinkle of extra cheese on the top of everyone's bowl.  Delicious and will make again!  Served with fresh homemade focaccia bread.

carmelized onions made a nice addition to this recipe. I also used fresh mozzarella as well. Be sure to freeze mozzarella for 10 mins before adding to hot pasta. It prevents it from getting "gummy"

Made this according to the directions except substituted dry parsley for the fresh. I think fresh would have given it more brightness and I look forward to making it that way.
Even with the substitution my son was asking me to make it again before we were even done.

**update** I Did make this recipe with fresh parsley and it was worthy of 5 stars. However I'm personally not a big fan of parsely so tonight I made it with cilantro and it was off the charts FANTASTIC! Using the cillantro is a personal preference and the recipe is wonderful as written. I will make this again and again!!!

This is soooo good. I used 1 28oz. can of diced tomato and one large fresh garden tomato, 1/4 cup of fresh parsley and only 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese because I didn't have mozzarella on hand. It was great. I will be making this one often.

This is a delicious and light dish. I used a couple cloves of fresh garlic, added a head of spinach (I cooked it with the tomatoes and garlic) and used basil instead of parsley (I only had canned basil on hand but it still tasted delicious!). I thought the dish was too salty, so use  very sparingly when you sprinkle the tomatoes.

such a delicious pasta dish!  I did add some diced onions and green peppers b/c I needed to use them up, and it only added to the wonderful flavors in the dish.  Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper!

I liked that it was healthful, but even with extra garlic and spices, it was a bit bland. Also, the mashed tomatoes made it a bit watery - I'd recommend draining the mixture a bit before mixing it with the pasta.

This was pretty good. I added some shrimp and lemon juice and left out the mozzarella cheese. I served this with steamed artichokes for a nice fresh tasting dinner. I would make this again since the ingredients are very common to have on hand (especially if you have a garden).

Liked it very much. However, it calls for too much salt. I sauteed mushrooms and zuchinni to add color, flavor and nutrition. Very fast, very easy and delicious!

This recipe was wonderful! Only thing I changed was to use spaghetti noodles and a 28 oz. can of diced tomatoes instead of the fresh. My family couldn't get enough, and even my 2 year old son ate 3 helpings.

I love this recipe.  The only thing i do different sometimes is to use a can of diced tomatoes depending on how the fresh ones look at my grocery store that day.  I also use whatever thin pasta i have on hand.  Great!

Great Recipe! It's really very simple to make and even if you stick with it as is, you will have an amazing meal!! I've also added sauteed onions and chicken when I have it, but without those things I would still make this. It's awesome!

I made this for dinner tonight and Wow, this was amazing! I barely left any for my roommate!  I made two changes.  Since I did not have vermicelli pasta, I used linguini fini.  Also I sauteed the tomatoes in bacon grease and a little bit of olive oil, because I didn't want to waste it.  It added a nice smokiness to the pasta.

This turned out pretty well. To modify into a main course add precooked shrimp before tossing and plating.

Good base recipe. My attempt turned out pretty watery - don't know why - next time I may add a tbsp of flour.
After tasting the recipe as written, I added another tbsp of Cajun seasoning -- that improved the taste considerably.

Different side dish. I didn't have any fresh parsley so used dried & maybe that is why I couldn't rate it higher.  Will have to make sure next time I have fresh parsley. Will keep this recipe, but it needs something still for more flavor.

Very good, but the ratio of pasta to sauce was off.   I will make again, halving the pasta and doubling the seasoning.

I just made this for the first time-It is really great and tastey. I would probabaly use less salt next time I make it-if you are looking for something light this is it (with a little less salt). Lots of flavor and incredibly easy-will be making this often!

My husband liked this more than I did.  As a vegetarian I found it unsatisfying.  I definitely need more veggies and less pasta, personally!  My husband added some shrimp to his and enjoyed it quite a bit.

Good, solid recipe. I took advice of another poster and used a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes with Italian herbs instead of the fresh tomatoes to simplify things.  No other changes made.  My 2-year-old and husband (and me!) gobbled it down.  It makes a lot!

This was yummy! I was a little nervous my husband wouldn't like the tomato pieces...(he didn't!) but we ate the whole thing!
For a quick fix, I used a can of whole tomatoes and chopped it up a little. I added a bit more cajun spice salt and parsley than called for. It was very flavorful.
I will definitely make this again.

perfect pasta for a quick meal after getting home from work at night and tastes excellent if you cut up chicken and put it in with the garlic and the tomatoes.

It was good enough and easy to make, but I thought it was a little lacking in flavor, and the cheese didn't melt and blend in, it just made a goopy mess.

My, my, my - this was heaven.  I used two cans of seasoned tomatoes and pretty much eyeballed everything else.  It was so fresh and tasty and pulled together in just a few minutes.  I added some cooked chicken that I had and it made it a wonderful meal.

So good!   And so easy to make!  I used two 14 oz. cans of diced tomatoes in lieu of fresh tomatoes, since that's what I had on hand.  This is soooo good.  Will definitely make this again.

It's got potential to be really good, but I think that vermicelli might not be the best pasta for this dish - it's too hard to mix up.  Maybe penne or something similar?

I really enjoyed this dish.  I didn't add anything else to it and my boyfriend said it needed more veggies or meat.  Maybe next time I'll add some blackened chicken or something for him.  I thought the amount of pasta was too much and only ended up using about 2/3 of the box.

WOW!!!!! SOOOOOO GOOD!!! Made half the suggested serving size (i.e. 4 serving's worth) for my fiance and I Thursday night. I pretty much followed Nicole's directions to the letter, with the exception of the following: a) I added about 1/8 c. more mozzarella/Parm cheese than called for, b) used a full t garlic, c) used up all 8 roma tomatoes I had on hand instead of 6 1/2 as suggested (I feared a dry end product otherwise) and d) used a full T of Creole seasoning for more flavor (I  scaled the salt to half though). My pasta of choice was spaghettini. My local Italian market did not have vermicelli (go figure!). Perhaps the two are the same??? Oh, and I added some pre-cooked tail-on shrimp (added during last 5 minutes of cooking), but my fiance and I both agree that protein is not necessary (and we didn't care for the taste of the shrimp in this at all). I think blackened chicken would be a better choice (IMHO). Served with garlic bread and wine, this was a lovely meal. What a great way to use summer's bounty of fresh tomatoes!!! Thanks so much for sharing, Nicole :) This one's a keeper!

This is a 10 star recipe! This has so much flavor and everything works together very nicely. I was a little short on time so I used canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh, but they worked well. The only other change I made was to use whole grain thin spaghetti instead of the vermicelli. The mozzarella and fresh parsley really make this a fabulous pasta dish. Yum! Thank you! :)

This was a good light meal, I liked it. It was easy and quick with few ingredients. I think I'll try it with shrimp next time to make it a bit more substantial. Oh I used canned diced tomatoes chopped up smaller, but if you do this, dont add all the liquid, I ended up having to take some out.

This recipe was okay.  I followed it exactly.  Like other reviewers I agree there is not enough sauce for the amount of pasta.  I used McCormick Cajun seasoning and did not think it was exciting or different at all.  If I were to do it again I would probably double the parsley and the Cajun seasoning.

This recipe was great tasting and super easy. It doesnt look or sound like that great of a dish, but it was really good! I halved the recipe and used one can of diced tomatoes. I served with the Tomato Chicken Parmesan from this site.Will certainly be one of my staples for pasta.

This was a terrific alternative to regular spaghetti and sauce! A light flavor of seasonings, my five year old daughter loved it and so did we! Thanks!

I did used a can (28 oz) of petite diced tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes, I simmered the tomato mixture (uncovered) for about 20 minutes to get rid of the watery consistency that comes from any diced tomatoes, I have used both angel hair & penne pasta, instead of vermicelli.  Also, 4 large cloves of garlic minced. I topped with sliced blackened chicken (recipe from Allrecipes  site). Use less pasta... I used  8-10 oz. instead. The cajun seasoning I use is "Slap Ya Mama."  I buy online at (slapyamama.com). It's not as salty as other popular brands of cajun seasoning.

My wife and I loved this recipe! It was a little intimidating at first, but once I got into cooking it I felt like it was actually pretty easy. We used Angel Hair pasta, Creole seasoning, and I added a little crushed red pepper for an added kick. She has not stopped asking me to make this again, and tonight I think I'll oblige her :)

I thought this was delicious, I think it would have been better if the sauce was thicker. It just happened to sink to the bottom of my noodles. I added mushrooms, because I love them. But I would make it again.

My husband and I really liked this recipe. I used my food processor on the tomatoes to save time. One thing I would say is be consious of the amount of salt (ie salting pasta, salting the sauce and the salt in the cajun seasoning) if you are salt sensitive.

I really liked this dish.  I never knew there was such a difference in Vermicelli pasta to spaghetti.  This was a great tasting pasta.  I am not a fan of tomatoes and I did not have Roma tomatoes I just used regular tomatoes, but this really tasted fresh and light and very good!

This makes for a great weeknight recipe.  I didn't use all the salt the recipe called for (I never do with recipes), but in this case, I think I should have.  It was missing a little something, but I have no doubt that will be easy enough to fix the next time I prepare this dish.

Made this exactly as directed over spaghettini.  It was okay but next time I make it I'll use penne or some other short pasta.  I wasn't thrilled with the long pasta as the sauce did not stick to it very well.  The sauce was pretty good, hubby thought it had a great taste so will try again for meatless mondays but change out the pasta.

Very good!  Everyone went back for seconds.   Chopped up 4c fresh tomatoes, subbed about 1/4c fresh basil for the parsley and only 1/2 lb. thin spaghetti.

Oh this is super good! I added grilled chicken for a meal and I too thought there wouldn't be enough flavor since there really isn't a "sauce". The cheeses and cajun take care of all the flavor as does the fresh parsley. Very yummy!

This recipe is excellent. While I was sauteing the slightly salted tomatoes and garlic, I wondered if the dish would have enough flavor...it did! The parsley, creole seasoning and cheeses gave it excellent flavor. So simple, so tasty, so...bring on more recipes this easy please!!! My husband loved it and he's not even a fan of tomatoes!!

The recipe is fantastic! The only changes I made was using linguine (couldn't find vermicelli in the store), creole seasoning, and dried parsley. My pasta was a little too runny than I like it so next time I won't add all the tomato juice. Also, the creole seasoning made the pasta a little spicy. I gave it five stars because I believe that my pasta not turning out as good as the recipe sounded is strictly due to my lack of cooking skills!

This was delicious! I was looking for a light pasta for dinner for my boyfriend and I, and this was really fantastic! I admittedly strayed from the original recipe to add some mushrooms...because I bought them while they were on sale and didn't want them to go bad. I usually don't like to cook with whole tomatoes, so I was surprised that I liked this as much as I did. This was great, thanks so much!

Served this recipe with Blackened Chicken on this site and loved the two together.  This pasta tastes really fresh and goes perfectly with a simple chicken sliced thin on top.  It's so salty!!!!  I thought that when pouring it on but wanted to try the recipe exactly, and next time will try putting in half then the rest to taste.  Bought 16 tomatoes and will probably buy 20 next time.

This was just alright.  I had tasted it before I added the cheeses and Cajun and saved a little bit because it tasted AMAZING! I wish I would have stopped there. 
I didn't like the Parmesan, the Cajun seasoning was overpowering (and I didn't add the whole Tablespoon) and the mozzarella sort of hardened up around my fork and on the bottom of the bowl, that weirded me out.  
I also used half the amount of pasta and it was still quite a bit!

I really enjoyed this dish! I used 3 cans of tomatoes, partially drained, instead of fresh. Also added a bit more garlic out of personal preference. I didn't have any fresh parsley so I used 1 tsp dried. It had a lot of flavor and a nice kick to it without being too spicy. The mozz is a nice touch, it melts in and makes it kind of gooey. Will definitely make this again...yum!

I absolutely love this dish! I did add shrimp to it, to add a little more 'bulk' to the recipe, but I've made it without the shrimp too and it's great either way!! :) Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This recipe took a little longer than I expected but it was well worth it! My wife was upset when she looked for the left overs and they were already gone thanks to our teen. . . I made the mistake of blending the tomato vs. smushing per the recipe- stick to the recipe and you will be much happier!

So I really wanted to try this recipe mainly because of the picture, and boy am I glad I did! Because it tastes just as good as it looks in the picture. Yum!

I get at least 2 or 3 recipes every week off of allrecipes and this it the first I've tried that is REALLY 5 stars with no personal alterations. It's great with or without the cajun seasoning (served some without for kiddos before adding it) and I love the few ingredients. So simple, but fantastic. 

I may try it some other time with canned tomatoes just to save time, but I have a hard time believing it will be quite as tasty.

Very delicious.  I added ground beef since my boyfriend cannot have a meal without meat and everything went so well together.  The pasta tasted fresh and light.

Very tasty, thank you! I used a 28-ounce can of Muir Glen diced tomatoes, added 1lb. of shrimp (which I sauteed in the oil and garlic prior to adding tomatoes) and The Spice Hunter cajun seasoning. I ended up adding more cajun seasoning due to personal tastes. Even my son who normally doesn't like anything with "hot" spices loved it.

Incredible! Make sure you cook the pasta Italian style (slightly undercooked so it's firmer than Americans are used to)  I made the recipe as is, but it would definitely taste good with some extra vegetables thrown in. Making it again for sure.

This was okay.  I felt there was far too much pasta with a full pound and it was still quite salty even though I only added 1/2 of what the recipe called for.  If I make it again, I will cut down on both.

This is an ok dish. i made exactly as written, fresh tomatoes and all. as is i would not make again but if i did decide to make again the main thing i would leave out is the mozzarella. it seemed odd in this dish. i think it may have been added into the recipe as a thickener, but it really messes up the consistency of this simple pasta dish.

This is a very light and flavorful pasta dish.  We loved it!!  I made this exactly as written, and I can't wait to change it up here and there with shrimp or chicken.  Thanks so much for posting this recipe; it will be a "regular" at our dinner table.

This was delicious!  I added the Cajun seasoning to taste and didn't use salt, used more garlic and added 2 chopped chicken breasts that I had in the freezer, they had been marinated in the Smokey Tequila Marinade recipe then grilled.  I didn't use the mozzarella.  Next time I'm going to sprinkle the cheese on top because it kind of disappeared into the sauce.  The fresh tomatoes were so much better than canned.  Also, I think it's important to add something- chicken, broccoli, spinach, mushrooms, even tofu- to make the dish a bit more substantial.  All in all, we really enjoyed this and will make it again!

I made this recipe without modifications, and I just did not like it very much. I usually love pasta, but this recipe completely lacked flavor in my opinion. For those of you looking who are looking for a really delicious, simple pasta recipe, look for the zucchini pasta recipe on this site. That one has been a winner for my family. This one, however, was a huge letdown. I won't be making it again.

It was ok, I didn't drain the noodles enough so it was really watery... the cajun had a hard time making a statement. i might add more veggies to make it a little more hearty. Good concept though.

Very tasty dish, but FAR too much salt. Next time I will be cutting the salt by at least half. I was pleased with the great flavor of the cajun seasoning and the amount of tomatoes. I will make sure I have mozarella for the next time I make this as well!

I made this topped with Blackened Chicken (also on the site), and it was truly restaurant quality.  I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes and the Cajun Seasoning Mix recipe from this site.  Who needs a Neverending Pasta Bowl when you can make this at home??

This is awesome. I love it because it is simple to make, quick to make and most importantly delicious. I love it!!

The only thing I did different was the cajun, I love spice but not everyone in my family does so I added per serving per personal taste. 
Also I used whole wheat pasta, thin spag.

This is such a great recipe!  I followed others advice and used penne instead of vermicelli...  I upped the garlic to 2TB cause I loooove garlic and bbq'd some chicken breasts seasoned with the cajun spices...   chopped it up and threw in with the pasta at the end..  Yummmmeee.

We were so pleased with this recipe.  I halved the recipe to serve 4 but kept the creole seasoning at 1T since some of the reviewers commented that it needed more zip.  A great sidedish to Cajun Barbecued Chicken.  Easy to add extra veggies to also.  I used linguine.

Very good dish, easy & delicious.  Next time I would use a dash more cajun seasoning.  Also added zucchini & mushrooms.  I purchased Asiago Parmesan & grated fresh.  Delicious.

thanks for sharing this.

This was a tasty one... but a bit spicy for me.  I'll probably use 1/2 the cajun spice next time, and more tomatoes (or less pasta).  The ratio of pasta to sauce seemed a bit high to me.

I have one word...WOW!! A very fresh taste and a nice change from your typical sauce. Thanks for the recipe--my husband, son and I enjoyed it! I think I may try this one out on my Italian mother in law next weekend. I think she'll be inmpressed.

This recipe was incredible!  It was so easy to make and tasted great. I might add some more spicyness to it...Tony Chach..something has a great spice that would add to it!  Great recipe though!

This was a delicious and easy recipe! I used penne pasta and added some zucchini, squash, and a pinch of dried basil. I might bump up the Cajun seasoning next time or add some red pepper flakes since I like heat, but I wouldn't change anything else. I'm sure this dish would go great with whatever veggies you happen to have in your fridge!

Previous reviewers were right - it is all about the creole seasoning you choose. 
I was limited to options available at my local supermarket so I went with Zatarain's. I made this for a potluck and needed to double it. After reviewing most of the reviews, I used four cans of petite diced tomatoes with no salt, fresh ground salt and pepper, basil instead of parsley, half an onion and a small jalapeÃ±o. I sautÃ©ed the onion, pepper and garlic then added the tomatoes. I seasoned that mixture with creole seasknjng before mixing one pound of bow tie pasta (agreed with the reviews that said they would decrease pasta amount) . I only used Parmesan cheese but plan to offer mozzarella cheese at the potluck.

Made it with fresh tomatoes from our garden -- a variety of types -- so I simmered it quite a while to thicken the juices a bit. Added some fresh veggies from the garden as well. A new favorite.

Yeah. It was aight.

I enjoyed the pasta and the 'maters were dope.

My biggest gripe is that the cajun seasoning that I made (I didn't have a jar of it on hand.) added too much heat, so I sweat myself into a puddle.

It was disgusting.  Snot was everywhere.

Other than that, this is a delicious dinner. Would recommend.

I didn't use as many tomatoes.  I cut back about 5 I think.  I used a little more garlic and less of the creole seasoning.  My sons are from Haiti and love their haitian spaghetti.  This is the first spaghetti they have LOVED besides their own. It was a hit.

Made it as instructed, though the Cajun quantity really ruined it, a tablespoon is way too much for the Cajun. if it were a teaspoon or maybe even less, i think it would be wonderful :)

Wow!  Delicious!  My husband usually has to have a meat with pastas but this was so flavorful that even he agreed it was fine as it was.  I left off the mozz cheese since I have a little trouble with dairy products but it was still very tasty!

Wow. This was so, so good, and lightning fast. The fresh tomato flavor just makes this. I might even try making it again without the cheese, because the tomatoes are the rock stars here. Plus, any dish where the pasta takes more time than the rest of the cooking is a weeknight winner in my book!

Super delicious! I used canned diced tomatoes in their juice and added shrimp. The canned tomatoes and shrimp were both good ideas. Using canned instead of fresh cut down on prep time and the shrimp added texture and protein. I will definitely make this again.

It would be absolutely delicious if it wasn't way too salty. I added 2/3 of the salt to the sauce, assuming the total amount is combined for boiling the pasta and adding to the sauce. Next time I'll reverse the proportion and add only 1/3 tbsp salt (or less) to the sauce.

I only had 5 romas on hand so I supplemented with some canned diced tomatoes and it was still great. I made my own cajun seasoning using a recipe on this site and made the shaker available for those who like more spice. I am a wuss when it comes to spiciness but it was tame enough for me to enjoy  with the measured amount of seasoning. I used less salt and whole wheat pasta for health reasons, still yummy!

This recipe is amazing! The only thing I changed was to use half parsley and half fresh basil and add in a handful of chopped spinach. I used fresh tomatoes and the full TBLS of salt. If I used canned tomatoes, this might have been too much salt. However, with fresh tomatoes, it was perfect. I must agree with some other reviewers who said the Cajun spice you use is crucial. I used a very good Cajun spice mix. I also served this with the blackened chicken found here. I used my own Cajun seasoning on it, as well. Wonderful meal! This is one of the best recipes I have ever made from this site, and I make LOTS of recipes from here! Thanks so much for this delicious, simple recipe!

I used two (15 oz) cans of petit diced tomatoes with sweet onions, thin spaghetti, dried parsley, and shrimp in place of some ingredients. It turned out wonderful! Flavor was amazing and the heat was just right. I also used Luzianne Cajun seasoning. I cooked a whole box of noodles and we had a bunch left over. Maybe we were using too much sauce, but it's so good we couldn't help it! I mixed the Parmesan into the sauce and then sprinkled mozzarella on the top to serve.

Made this exactly like the recipe calls for except I added some andouille sausage. Great flavor and refreshingly different than traditional pasta and sauce.

Who wants to go out to dinner when you can make something this delicious at home? I sauteed some mixed, colored peppers first, which really compliment the dish. Then I added the garlic and tomatoes, letting them cook a short while. Added fresh basil, dried parsley and some butter. The Cajun seasoning here really works, adding a nice, zippy flavor. Thanks for the great recipe, Nicole.

I was nervous about the cajun seasoning, usually used in southern dishes and this being a somewhat Italian dish but the taste of the seasoning is so subtle it just adds a little extra oomph.

This is one of my twelve year old daughter's favorite meals!!!  We like to use wagon wheel noodles. :)  However, we did cut the amount of cajun seasoning in half or it would be too spicy for the kids.

Awesome recipe. So far I've made this twice: once with shrimp and once with andouille sausage. The sausage added so much flavor was far better than the shrimp. I doubled the cajun seasoning both times, because it seemed a little bland. I am going to use the sauce as a base to try a quick basil Italian type of dish next. Great recipe!

Quick and tasty. Used whole grain spaghetti, since that's what we had, as well as canned, Italian diced tomatoes. Sauteed onion, bell pepper and diced zucchini in a pan and added it, as well as a dash of cayenne pepper for some extra kick. If you wanted to add a protein, I think shrimp would be really good in here.
Will definitely make it again.

Delicious and easy recipe! Even my kids who don't like tomatoes ate this, kind of just picking the tomatoes out. I thought it tasted fresh and it had the perfect amount of mozzerella, not too much, not too little. This is a great meatless recipe, I will be making this one again.

I love this recipe so much, and so does everyone else in my family!  I've made it three times now, and every time it comes out beautifully.  Not to mention to is a very simple recipe and easily made.  I tend to put more cajun seasoning every time I cook it.  I'm not a fan of spicy food, but the added kick and flavor are to die for! (:

I plan to make this many more times in the future!

We made this tonight, and it was out of this world!  Minor changes, after reading other reviews:  when sauteeing the garlic, added shrimp, which cooked up very well; did not add salt--for the cajun seasoning used Tony Cachiere's, which is full of sodium, and added the cajun seasoning when cooking the sauce (gives it a little more kick).  Per others, used a 28 oz can of petite diced tomatoes.  What an easy recipe, with divine results!  Thank you for sharing!

Very, very good. I added more minced garlic for flavor and omitted additional salt to the tomatoes as both cheeses have enough salt in them already. Excellent dish that I would definitely make again.

I did not care for this recipe. but that may be due to the fact that i cooked the tomatoes with chicken sausages. I really disliked the flavor.

Made a few slight modifications/substitutions: Whole wheat rottini pasta, dried parsley, and Old Bay seasoning.  Also added shrimp and sliced zucchini in to cook with the pasta for the last 2-3 minutes. It was delicious!

This was delicious, healthy, quick, and easy. I used Barilla Plus Angel Hair pasta and reduced fat cheeses and I omitted the salt. My cajun seasoning was salty enough. IMO there was too much pasta for the sauce only because I love tomatoes and would've liked to get more tomatoes into my portion. I added turkey sausage which I highly suggest, it was so good. My husband said " I couldn't imagine this without the sausage", but he doesn't like vegetarian meals. I also used 2 minced garlic cloves (for 1/2 recipe).

My family (including a 3 year old) loved this. I didnt use very much cajun seasoning. I love the flavor with just pasta, garlic, and tomatoes. SO good!!! Will make many times.

This has been a weekly standby since 2006. It is a simple and tasty recipe. The only change I make is omitting the parsley (not a huge fan). I typically serve this with a side of fresh vegetables. This recipe is always a huge hit! If you are looking to make it lighter, I have cut the cheese in half and have been just as happy with the results. I also use whole wheat pasta. Overall great recipe!

Wow!  I can't believe how good this simple recipe is.  It is definitely a new favorite!  I used whole wheat penne because that's our favorite.  I also cooked some chicken breast on the side with some of the cajun seasoning and tossed that in too.  Fantastic!

I did not really like this recipe...I thought the cajun seasoning was overpowering. I'm giving it two stars because my boyfriend really enjoyed it.

This meal was excellent!  It really tasted like something a restaurant would make.  Both my husband and I loved it!  I will definitely make this again.

This was really good - mild flavor, but not bland. I had no fresh parsley so I used dry. I also added about a tablespoon of fresh chopped basil.

I thought this was very good. I would maybe add a few more tomatoes. I did add some baby shrimp which was really good. Tasted a little too salty, I might decrease that next time.

This was fine - not something I will probably make again.  It just wasn't different enough.  I did like the little kick the cajun seasoning gave to it, but otherwise it was plain.

This was very easy to make. It was a little plain though so I only made it as a side dish and not a main course.

Be verrrrry careful how much cajun spice you use.  (I halved the recipe, but still used a tablespoon of spice, and it was way too much...)

It was okay. I like the method of sauteeing down the tomatoes, I'll probably use that again.
