I give this a five star; however, I must admit, I changed the recipe a bit: for the topping I mixed 3 tbsp. white sugar, 1 tbsp. brown sugar, and 3/4 tsp. cinnamon (no butter).  For the batter I used 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar.  Also, I added in 3/4 tsp. cinnamon and 1 tsp. vanilla.  I baked it at 325 for 22 minutes and it turned out perfect!  It was so moist and flavorful and it was gone within 12 hours!  Easy and I love how it uses things just sitting around in the pantry.

I tried this recipe this morning and it came out wonderful, especially the topping. I doubled the topping and added some cinnamon to the batter. The next time i make it i will add more sugar and triple the topping so i can swirl some through out the batter.

This recipe is nice and moist and has a great topping.  I found it rather bland 
though but that could easily be fixed with adding some cinnamon or your favorite
spice to the cake itself and perhaps using brown sugar for the topping.  It just 
needs a little kick.

I made this cake for my boyfriend and he told me this was the best desert I've ever made. That's a pretty good compliment considering I bake something just about every day. The only changes I made were substituting shortening for butter (only because I didn't have butter....next time I will use butter) I tripled the topping and put half batter in the pan, layered in half the topping, then poured the rest of the batter in and topped with remaining topping. Excellent!

I doubled this recipe to fill a 9x13 pan and needed to bake it about 10 minutes more than the listed baking time. As far as coffee cakes go, this is pretty good. It's definitely better than some of the others I've made off this site. I added cinnamon and vanilla to the batter. Though there isn't much that makes this taste like a snickerdoodle, I think this is perfect for breakfast or a tea. The batter would also be a great base for banana cake or apple cake. Thanks for the recipe!

Wanted a quick and tasty coffee cake, this fit the bill. Added 1/4 teaspoon each cinnamon and nutmeg to batter, also swirled topping through batter before baking.

This recipe is amazing. The texture of the batter before baking came out a little odd, but the result was fantastic. I didn't have shortening, so I added some butter and it really helped. My family loves the cake.

Very good!  Family LOVED it!   Only made a few changes.  Replaced half the flour with wheat flour, added 2 tbs of cinnamon to the batter and used low fat butter and skim milk instead of shortening and whole milk.   Doubled the ingredients to make a double batch, but still used same size square glass pan, but baked it an extra 10 minutes.  Made the perimeter a little crunchy and the center chewy.  (My wife and I like chewy snickerdoodles, the kids like crunchy ones, so everyone was happy).  Will be making this again (just not very often, not exactly on our healthy lifestyle list, but I LOVE snickerdoodles and this cake!) :)

I subbed 1/2 the sugar with brown and doubled the crumb mixture. We have dairy allergies so I used coconut creamer for the milk and coconut oil based margarine for the crumble. I’m still trying to figure out how to make a good crumble without real butter so it melted a little but overall tasted great. The cake is very mild tasting and highlights the crumble. It would be a great base for adding other things on top or in the middle like apples. I really like this recipe and will try it again. I may try “sour” milk or adding apples but I also like it just as written.

I made this with four young people.
All four batches took much more than 20-25 minutes.
Disappointing.

The best part about this cake is that it tastes like you put way more time, effort, and ingredients into it than you actually do! All of the ingredients are always kept on hand, and it is very easy to make. The cake turned out absolutely delicious! I, like the other users, put some cinnamon into the batter. I also poured half the batter in the pan, then sprinkled more cinnamon and sugar over that before putting in the rest. I also doubled the topping using half white and half brown sugar. Next time I'd put half of the topping in the middle. Highly recommended!

I would have rated this a 5, but I read reviews beforehand and mixed 1/4 cup of sugar with cinnamon and added it to flour mixture before adding the egg mixture.  I doubled the crumb topping.  I think next time I might try to make this with an extra egg to make it even moister.  It is definitely a 5 with tweaks!!!

I love coffee and anything that goes with it! This cake has a great balance between moisture and crumble.  I only had rice milk on hand at the time, but it still came out great. Super easy as well!

This was a very simple cake to make, and instead of using the exact recipie, I used the variations that Chelsea Rose used in her review here, adding the cinnamon and vanilla to the batter, and omitting the butter from the topping and using brown sugar instead. I cooked it at 325 for 22 mins. in a dark coated pan.  It tasted very good, though the batter still seemed to lack something.. but cant seem to place my finger on it. maybe im just used to the cinnamon bundt cakes that have a the cinnamon swirled through them.. I think the next time I make this, I will try to layer cinnamon and brown sugar in between by spreading the batter 1/2 at a time. Does that make sense? lol Over all though, it turned out yummy. Great cake to make in a hurry.

This was AMAZING.  Soft, moist, and the topping was pretty sweet. I added nutmeg,and brown sugar in the topping. I didn't have enough flour so i used bisquick, yet it came out so delicious. Really quick and easy.  I will definately make this again.

UPDATE: **
Below is my original review, but I wanted to lower my rating to 2 stars.  I just made this cake again.  This time I was short on butter, but I had some shortening, so I used it in the batter, but still used butter for the topping.  I was extremely disappointed with the results.  The cake was very dense, and the flavor was off.  For those of you who have tried and were disappointed, or who are thinking of trying it, just skip the shortening and use butter.  The cake will be richer, fluffier, and have more flavor.  Last time, I just used butter exactly in the amount called for shortening, and cut it in as the recipe says, and it was much nicer.  Also, try adding vanilla to the batter, and making extra topping to put in the middle of the cake.  Hope this helps!!

ORIGINAL REVIEW: ****
This cake had a nice flavor.  I don't think it tasted exactly like a snickerdoodle though; it actually reminded me of a box mix that used to be available for a coffee cake that came with its own disposable pan in the box.  Anyway, I doubled the crumb topping because it didn't seem like enough.  Next time, I think it would be a lot nicer if I put half of that into the cake itself, and make it into more of a coffee cake.  Also, I used real butter instead of shortening, substituted one-for-one, to avoid the use of chemical by-products, and I added a teaspoon of vanilla.  These changes worked well.  In short, it's an easy and nice recipe, if you want coffee cake, but no substitute for snicke

I was not impressed with this recipe.  I did as some of the other reviewers suggested and added vanilla and cinnamon to the batter. The cake was very flat and dense, not at all light and fluffy like I expect coffee cake to be.  Husband and I were very disappointed.
