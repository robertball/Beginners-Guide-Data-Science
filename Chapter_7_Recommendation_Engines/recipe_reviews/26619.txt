My husband loved this!  Best meatloaf that I have made by far.  I substituted 1/2 c of oatmeal instead of bread crumbs and it turned out great.

This is the best meatloaf ever! My children love it. It stays together so well that I put it in a large roasting pan and cook quartered potatos around it.The potatos cook in the sauces that run from the meatloaf. DELICIOUS!! 
Thanks Mary!

This is the best meatloaf recipe I have tried to date.  My husband even loves it and he used to hate meatloaf.  Like another reviewer I used ground pork and veal in addition to the ground beef. I increased the onions to two and sauteed them in olive oil first. I also used potato bread instead of white, added a tbsp of dried parsley, and used only 2 tbsp of brown sugar for the topping and found it was plenty sweet.  This is my only meatloaf recipe from now on. Thanks Mary!

This was EXCELLENT. I don't even like meatloaf and I loved this.  My huband ate it up....2 big helpings.  I didn't cook it for 2 hours, I have a VERY hot oven, so I only cooked it for a little over an hour.  If I had gone 2 hours, it would have been dry.  I also waited 30 minutes, then put the glaze on, to reduce burning. I used Splenda brown sugar blend to reduce calories, and it was great.  Highly recommend this one.

Sooo good!  I used the store packaged meatloaf mixture (equal parts ground beef, veal, and pork) instead of all ground beef.  For everything else I followed the recipe exactly.  The 2 hour baking time threw me at first (since every other recipe I've ever used has been 1 hour) but it was perfect.  It came out moist and delish instead of the charred meatbrick I'd been imagining.  It does have a slightly orange-ish color (from the mustard/ketchup), which I suppose could be somewhat disconcerting for people.

Excellent meatloaf Mary! This is delicious and moist with a nice tangy brown sugar glaze. I used about 1/4 cup of chopped onion and Italian-style bread crumbs instead of white bread. I also used dijon mustard instead of yellow. I garnished the top with with a bit of dried parsely and put it in the oven at 400 for about 50-55 minutes.

This will be my new meatloaf recipe.  Meatloaf was very good, moist, and easy.  I used about 1-1/2 t. of Lawry's seasoning salt instead of plain salt.

Instead of using a regular loaf pan I used two mini loaf pan so I could freeze one for later. I did cut back on the cooking time as to not overcook. I added some italian seasonings (parsley, basil, oregano) and used 1/2 lb. fresh sage sausage in place of the 1/2 lb. of beef to give more flavor.  Another good meatloaf recipe from this site.

Fabulous Meatloaf.  I added a green bell pepper.   I formed the meatloaf and then I added quartered potatoes, baby carrots, celery and a whole head of garlic cloves diced around the meatloaf in a 11x14 casserole dish. YUM!!!

One of the BEST meatloaf recipe I ever made!! I am searching no more. I used panko breadcrumbs in place of the white bread! I doubled the recipe and divided the meatloafs into 2 small loaf pans. Cooked faster that way..Absolutely a keeper! Try it you will use this recipe over and over again... Thanks Mary for sharing! :)

Meatloaf had no real texture, too much moisture.  Prefer it with crackers rather than bread.

My family loved this meatloaf! I put potatoes and carrots around it while it cooked; the carrots shriveled up but the potatoes were good. Also I used real garlic cloves instead of the powder.

This is by far the best meatloaf I have ever had in my life. I have been trying to "tweek" my meatloaf recipe for years but have never been satisfied.  I followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of adding a small portion of sauteed green peppers.  Everybody that ate this said it was the best meatloaf I ever made.  I will never make meatloaf any other way!!!!  Thanks for sharing this with us!!!!

Enjoyed by my whole family, even the picky one!  I didn't have the garlic salt, but it was still good.  I know it will be even better with it, and I will definitely be making it again.

Very Good! I didn't add onions because my husband doesn't like them. I also only cooked at 400 for 55 minutes and that seemed to be the perfect amount of time (I had less than a pound and a half of meat) I baked in a large pan with potatoes and carrots on the sides so they cooked in the juices from the meatloaf.

I followed the recipe to the T.. You really rate this recipe 5 stars? It was so bland and unpalatable I threw the meatloaf in the garbage. Yuukk. I will stick with my own which has flavor and makes a great sandwich the next day.. VERY unhappy with this meatloaf...

I have made this twice now. Both times it was fabulous. The second time I made it for company and they LOVED it as well...it came back around that they raved about it to other friends of ours ..when they served meatloaf that was not as good...oops!  haha.
I followed almost exact...except I made some minor changes. Instead of bread I used Panko bread crumbs,I used fresh garlic that I crushed and I used grainy mustard in the meat mixture..but I stuck with yellow mustard in the sauce. I cooked it for less time than stated..about an hour instead of 2.
This is now my go to meatloaf. If is VERY VERY moist and has excellent flavour. I cooked it both times with roasted potatoes surrounding it. For the potatoes I peeled and chopped then tossed them in a bowl with a bit of oil and seasoning. Our guests LOVED the flavour of the potatoes cooked in with the meatloaf...it made a sort of sauce for them. Finish the meal with a salad or some corn. Good old fashioned comfort food!  (My picture is currently the one showing up for this recipe..it is in a red dish with potatoes on a stove with a red teapot in the back ground if you want to see how it turned outI can't find it to post it with my review)

This came out great - made it with ground turkey, and used 2 eggs and flavored Italian breadcrumbs (what I had on hand). I also cut up sweet potatoes, sprinkled a little brown sugar on them and put all in the same pan.  Cooked at 375* in 1 hour it was perfect.  I like to cover the bottom of the pan with water to help steam so it does not dry out.  Mary - your recipe is a winner!

Flavor was good. But who cooks a meatloaf for 2 hours?? One hour is plenty of cooking time for this recipe, unless you like your meatloaf bone dry.

Great recipe! I followed some of the other suggestions and substituted 1/2 cup of oatmeal for the bread. I also cooked it in a larger dish and put potatoes around the loaf to soak up the juices. I cooked it for the full 2 hours and it came out nice and moist. We'll definitely have this recipe again.

Great meatloaf recipe.  I made it into mini-loaves as we like more "crust".  My 8 year old said it was delicious.  I doubled the recipe and froze half uncooked.  I have found that cooked meatloaf becomes mushy after being frozen and thawed.  I was a bit afraid of the mustard as I really don't like mustard w/ hamburger, but went with it based on comments and it was not really noticeable in the sauce.

This was a really great recipe.  I made two changes, one by accident.  My first change, the accidental one, was a reduction of the mustard by 1 tbsp in the meat mixture (misread ingredients, in a hurry).  The second change was a reduction of the onion to 1/2.  Still very good and flavorful.

This was delicious. I used 2 sleeves of crushed Ritz crackers instead of bread, added 1 T of Worcestershire and 1/2 t Pickapeppa sauce. I also used 1 lb ground beef and 1 lb ground pork. For the sauce I used 1/4 c ketchup, 2 T mustard, and 4 T brown sugar. I don't think the meatloaf could stand on it's own without the sauce. It definitely makes the dish.

I made this meatloaf and it was great. I took the advice of another reviewer and cooked the onions  first. Instead of garlic powder I cooked the onions with minced garlic. I agree that you should cut down the brown sugar to 2 tbsp it was very sweet. I will make this meatloaf again it was great.

I haven't made meatloaf in many years but chose this recipe because it was simple and used ingredients I had. It turned out fantastic, and it didn't need 2 hours of cooking time. I made one pan that was about half a batch and baked one hour, and the 1.5 pound loaf I baked 1.5 hours. I used half ground beef and half ground pork and it was delicious!

My husband LOVED this! He really wanted a cream of mushroom meatloaf though (never had it) so I just replaced any of the ketchup and mustard w/cream of mushroom and it was a great success!! We also used Italian Style bread crumbs because I had to get rid of it. But I am so positive I will love your original recipe and everyone else would as well!

I made this recipie since I was craving some meatloaf and I did not have the ingredients for the meatloaf that I usually make. Mine did not turn out as pretty as the picture. It was over done, so you may need to watch the cooking time on yours. I do not use bread in my usual meatloaf, instead I use bread crumbs or crackers, and I was not big on the texture that the cubes of bread gave the meatloaf. It is a simple recipie and it does have some good flavors. I am only giving it 3 stars because my husband and my children were not sold on it.

I love this! I have tried all different types of meatloaf recipes (made quite a few up myself) but this one is by far the best.  The meatloaf is so moist and you can't overcook it, I have tried.  I had it in for over 4 hours while I was making a run and lost track of time and it was even better.

This was a very good meatloaf, but a little too sweet for me and my son.  My husband loved it and said it was the best.  I will definitely make this again, but will probably cut down the sugar and mustard.

Good recipe. I tried cooking potatoes in pan as someone else had suggested and I didn't notice any better flavor to them. I will definetly make this meatloaf again but increase the amount of glaze. It just barely covers the meatloaf and is really yummy. Reminds me of a good cocktail meatball.

This had so many good reviews, I wanted to try this. Sorry, but this just did not do it for my family.  It was moist.  That's the best thing I can say for it. Not much taste, and the glaze on top was way too sweet.  I thought my boys would like it, but even they said to loose the recipe.  This is the first time I'm posting a negative review. I'll be going back to the Quaker Oats recipe.  At least the family likes that one.

This was easy and made a nice meal but was way too oniony for my personal tastes. My husband liked it. I will cut the onion by half (or more) the next time I fix this. This did come out very moist. I scaled this down to use 1 lb. of ground beef and only baked it an hour and 25 minutes then I let it stand for about 8 minutes before serving it. This is going to make some nice leftovers for tomorrow's lunch. Thanks for sharing Mary's meatloaf.

Loved it!  I only had 1lb of ground beef, so I scaled down the rest of the ingredients accordingly, and baked at 375 for 1 hour and 15 minutes.  Turned out great.

My family really liked this! It was moist & juicy and flavorful. I did mix in ground pork with the beef. Only had to cook for an hour until done. I would definitely make this again. Say good-bye to dry meatloaf!

I loved the brown sugar in the topping mixture. What a delicious meatloaf. I always used bread crumbs but I love cubing the bread slices instead. Luckily I had just enough ketchup to make this recipe. Meatloaf is a personal favorite and "Mary's Meatloaf" has replaced my own recipe from this day forward.

Great recipe.  I have finally found a meatloaf recipe to keep!  I served it with mashed potatoes, a cream gravy (the packet gravy from IKEA!) and Apricot Glazed Carrots.  Merlot to drink.  Yum!

This was only a so-so recipe.  It came out very wet and crumbly and did not stay together well.   I did enjoy the mustard/sugar sauce on top, that was a nice touch, but otherwise there are better standby meatloaf recipes.

I have always hated meatloaf, but wanted something different for dinner. I saw this recipe and decided we would give it a try. It was amazing. My kids both ate 2nd helpings. That never happens. It was just so good. Sweet but not to sweet and didnt have the same meatloaf taste that most meatloaves have. The only thing I did different was i used ritz crackers instead of bread and only cooked for about 1.5 instead of the full 2 hours.

This recipe is PERFECT!  No need to adjust anything!  Make sure you make extra sauce, you'll want it smothered in it.  Thanks for sharing.  My new meatloaf recipe bar none.

My "vegan" daughter loved this meatloaf. Had a pound of hamburger ground beef 80/20 left over, so I was worried it would be too fatty. Came out perfect! I didn't have any bread so I used panko & italian breadcrumbs instead. I used Heinze hot and spicy ketchup to kick it up a notch and it was SUPERB! Definitely going to start making meatloaf more often. Might even be able to sneak in some finely chopped veggies next time. My daughter even asked if I could make more of the sauce on top next time so she can dip her meatloaf in it. Definitely going to try that.

This was the best meatloaf recipe I have tried!! It was so moist! I didn't cook it the full 2 hours, just around 1 hr 45 min. I forgot the onion, but it still had a good flavor. So good!

The best meatloaf recipe ever! After reading some of the other reviews, I made some minor changes. I added half a green pepper, finely chopped and along with the onion sauteed them adding 1 teaspoon of chopped garlic just before removing from the heat. I reduced the mustard to 1 teaspoon and replaced the bread with half a cup of oats. I don't like sweet glaze for my meatloaf so I just used ketchup and it turn out wonderful. The meatloaf was so moist and flavorful. Love it!

I made and served this meatloaf to the family and everyone raved about how delicious and tasty it was.  One of the best meatloaves I've made.  I usually make larger quantities and freeze 1/2 of the meals (where freezable)and found that there was too much bread called for and used only 3/4 of the bread when 'doubling' the recipe.  Otherwise and easy and tasty hit.

This was such a good meatloaf my family loved it. We will definently eat this again. Its going down as one of my favorites.I used red onion which really gave it a sweet taste. I used a table spoon of garlic powder. Cut the brown sugar to just one tablespoon.And made two loaves instead of one to cut the cooking time. Put in in for 20 mins uncovered and 20 mins covered. I didn't like the bread cubed I would suggest if you like soft meatloaf to use bread crumbs. Or ritz crackers.

I LOVE YOU for sharing this recipe!!!!!  This was hands down the very best meatloaf I have ever had. You seriously dont even need ketchup.  I did double the sauce as some other reviewers had suggested and I think that was a good idea, that glaze is fantastic.  I also used only half an onion but only because my kids were eating this and would have refused if they saw too much onion.  That being said everyone had clean plates after this meal and it warmed up great the next day for leftovers night.  SO GOOD and flavorful, everyone should tuck this away for a "Staple" recipe. it's a keeper!!

This was soooo tasty. I really liked the glaze on top. I would reduce a bit of the onions to make the meatloaf more kid friendly. A definite addition to my recipe box.

I absolutely love this meatloaf.  It is by far the best I have ever had.  I don't think the glaze needs to be doubled it was just enough for me and I LOVE it and so did everyone else.

If you think this recipe is great, try substituting crushed corn flakes for the bread.  I used a little less than a cup of crushed corn flakes.  Served this to company and they just about fell out of their chairs!  Raved about it the entire time they were here visiting.  It was awesome.

I have NEVER been able to make a good meatloaf, although my family good-naturedly eats whatever I put out.  My mom, on the other hand, made the quintessential meatloaf, and this tasted like Mom's!  I think using the bread instead of oatmeal as filler did the trick.  Here's a great meatloaf hint:  Make little meatloaves in muffin tins.  Takes much less time to bake and if you put a little ketchup on for "icing", they look nice on the plate, too.

This is delicious! I accidentally went overboard with the amount of meat (about 1.5 of beef and 1 of pork) so I had to make 2 meatloaves. After adding the 1 large onion I realized this, so I added 2 eggs and a bit more garlic powder/pepper/salt. Though, I did not have to add more than about 1/2C of milk, or more than 5 slices of wheat bread. I put the result in two evenly divided 9x5 pans and made the amount of glaze called for, for each, only I used 1 heaping TBS of brown sugar per loaf and it was still sooo tasty. (I do use the all natural Heinz ketchup.) Ultimately, I think adding a little more bread would have been fine but not necessary either. The loaves produced a copious amount of grease (as you would expect) so maybe a bit more bread would have been good, but it held together nicely so I was able to lift it out of the pans and put it on a plate, thereby avoiding the extra grease. DELICIOUS without having to cook the onion extra so long as you like a slightly-crunchy onion, which we do, onion freaks that we are. :)

Very tasty... I used 2 pounds ground beef, and 1 cup cooked white rice that I had on hand and 1/4 cup oatmeal, also used 2 cloves garlic crushed instead of the garlic powder. Other than that, followed the recipe exactly, used dijon mustard.  I increased the sauce a little and made 2 smaller loaves. Hubby loved it, will be saving.

Easy to make, delicious, was a big hit with my family.  I used oats instead of bread as other reviewers suggested.  This was one of the best, if not the best meatloaf I've ever made.

I have to say that this is the best meatloaf recipe I've ever had.  I was out of my "usual" meatloaf ingredients so I tried this one.  It was super-moist, flavorful, and easy.  I only made a few small changes.  I used venison instead of ground beef, 1/2 cup of oatmeal instead of bread cubes, and I reduced the cook time by 1 hour and increased the temp to 375.  Simply delicious!  Thanks Mary!

My whole family loved it- even my 1yr old and 3yr old! I took the suggestions of others and used 1/2 cup of oatmeal instead of the bread cubes. I also used a little onion powder instead of chopped onions- because my family isn't a big fan of finding pieces of onion. Will be making it again.

I just made this for supper and it was so gooood!  I used venison instead of the ground beef.  I didn't have any bread so I used oats like another reviewer.  I shaped my loaf in the middle of a 9x12 pan and put some quartered potatoes alongside.  I covered it with foil and baked it about 90 minutes.  I used a meat thermometer to be sure it was done.  I will make this regularly.  So easy and so good!

Very tasty but I read other reviews and followed their advice of adding 1/2 oatmeal in place of the bread.  Next time, I'll either use the bread or add more oatmeal because the meatloaf was a little loose.  The topping is very good and meatloaf extremely moist.  This one is a keeper!

I used garlic flavored croutons instead of bread, and didn't really see a need for the milk....so, I left that out.

I'm new to cooking and I tried out this recipe and it turned out great! It tasted just the way I like my meatloaf except for one part: After the 2 hours of baking, the sauce came out burnt. Is 2 hours too long for baking the sauce, and should I add it in a little later?

Best meatloaf I have ever made!!! And I have made a few meatloaves in my day!  Thanks for sharing.  My husband loves everything made with rotel (hot) or tabasco sauce...and he even loved it.  He said it tastes great with the tabasco on it.  I just don't know what I am going to do with him!!  I am making it again tonight, just to freeze to have on hand.

I made this last week, my first time makeing meat loaf. My boyfriend generally doesn't like meat loaf and loved this. I also made red skined mashed potatoes with this and for left overs was mixing the two together - it was fanominal. Almost like shepherds pie or something. I will be making this again.

This was absolutely fabulous.  I do not like meatloaf, but my husband loves it.  I loved this meatloaf.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe.  I added half a pack of saltines because I had more ground beef than called for and I didnt have extra bread.  It was still fabulous!

I must of did something wrong, but I don't know what. I followed the recipe exactly, and the top of the meatloaf came out burned. The meatloaf itself was not firm and fell apart. I double checked the recipe, and I followed it correctly. But it didn't come out as other reviewers stated.

I used to hate meatloaf, especially my mother's lovingly earnest attempts which invariably ended up as dry and heavy as doorstops.  This recipe changed my mind.  I added chopped green pepper, and used minced garlic.  For the sauce, I limited the brown sugar to two Tbsp. and added a splash of Worcestershire. Like another reviewer suggested, I did not top off the meatloaf until 30 minutes into the cooking time.  Thanks "Mary" for making me love meatloaf!

My family really liked this, even my husband who doesn't really like meatloaf.  I used 1/2 cup oatmeal instead of breadcrumbs and truvia instead of brown sugar and 1/2 ground turkey and 1/2 grassfed beef.  I baked it in the crockpot on low all day.

This was GOOOOD! This was a great base for me to make my first meatloaf but I used bread crumbs instead and used other spices for more flavour. added fresh garlic and added the sauce for the last 15min. i substituted the reg mustard for dijon and added a bit of apple cider vinegar.

Absolutely fantastic. Made this for my fiance and her grandparents tonight, and got totally rave reviews. The brown sugar topping is the major clincher I think - very good addition. I wouldn't change a thing.

I make meatloaf once a month for our Sunday dinner. That said, I am always on the lookout for a better meatloaf recipe. This just might be it!  I added minced garlic to it, but I add minced garlic to everything.  Other than that, I made the recipe as is.  Tremendous flavor that had the whole family coming back for seconds.  Me and my husband even fought over who could take the leftovers to work today.  Excellent!

I used some ground chicken in my meatloaf, combined with very lean ground sirloin. I made it all up doubling the recipe, divided in thirds, stored two in the freezer for an easy dinner down the road, and cooked one up. Family really raved about it. Baked potatoes right along side. Served with some fruit, too. Will make this again and again, since it's a no-brainer. Delicious topping!

I do put more "glaze" on top - perhaps double the amount.

This meatloaf is so tasty.  It is quick and easy to prepare, and although it takes tow hours to bake, it is worth the wait, it comes out moist and delicious.  The sweet sauce on the top is a wonderful touch.  It smells so heavenly while baking its sure to conjure up your appetite.

This is my favorite meatloaf recipe. The sauce is what makes it great. It's tangy and sweet in good proportion. It is also forgiving. I have made it with bread, and at other times with oatmeal and both were good. I have forgotten to put ketchup and mustard into the meat mixture, and it was still good. I usually make it with 1 lb of ground beef because there are just two of us, and adjusted the quantities down. However, I make the amount of sauce called for in the recipe because I like to have lots of sauce. I also usually wait and pour it on toward the end of the cook time. With a pound of ground beef it really doesn't need two hours, but wouldn't hurt it probably. Just check it to make sure it isn't burning.

This is the best and by far easiest meatloaf to make.  You can adjust
it but stick to the recipe ingredients.  I added a Tablespoon Worcestershire sauce yesterday to my 2 pounds of 92% lean ground beef
and it gave it a nice little kick.  Also I wanted to get everything 
together rather quickly as my dexterity with chopping has diminished over the years so I used my food processor for the bread cubes as well
as the onion chopping.  Just pulse till it is the way you like it.  I
even added the mild and egg and garlic to the processor plus I cannot
make anything with garlic without adding a little handful dried parsley.  Just be sure to check the temperature for doneness.  It
keeps together so well and makes great sandwiches IF there is any leftover.

This was a truly delicious meatloaf! I've always made the recipe on the back of Lipton's Onion Soup mix with a few alterations (that's how my mom always made it), but I was in the mood for something new. This recipe is officially my new go-to. I didn't have any bread on hand, so I did as another reviewer suggested and used oats instead. I also only had 1 lb of meat, so I reduced all the ingredients by about 1/3, still used 1 whole egg, and used 1/2 cup of oats in lieu of bread. I also added about 2/3 of a small green bell pepper along with the onion, which I ran through the food processer (I was too lazy to chop), and the results were fantastic! Since my meatloaf was smaller, I only cooked it for about 1.5 hours, adding the glaze when there was 1 hour cooking time left. I served it with Chef John's Perfect Mashed Potatoes (recipe from this site) and green beans. Overall, this was a very easy, tasty dish, and I recommend it wholeheartedly!

Instead of the bread, I add 1 to 2 cups of frosted flakes and a dash of Worcestershire to the mixture.  Adds to the taste.

Absolutely phenominal. I cook this for my family about once a month because we really enjoy it, also I run a daycare and all of the kids LOVE it, so that is definitely a bonus, as kids can be picky sometimes. :)

This is a great recipe, quick and easy. 4 stars only because of the "white" bread suggested by the author. Use bread that has as much whole grains, flax, sunflower seeds, etc., to help your family get good quality carbs and fiber in their diets! Also, if you are in a hurry, this mixture can be spread out in a casserole dish or even in muffin pans to decrease baking time! :)

I made some mild changes, such as using bread crumbs instead of using cubed bread. I also cut up green pepper and sauteed it with the onion, fresh garlic and a pinch of dried rosemary. My kids asked for seconds, and they're not really big beef eaters. I second whoever put the sauce on with about an hour left to cook. It didn't burn that way.

This is, by far, the best meat loaf that I've ever had. I only made two changes to the original recipe--the first being that I didn't have garlic powder, so I used a teaspoon of minced garlic instead and the second being that I used oyster crackers rather than bread--and it turned out wonderfully. Everyone who ate it liked it and we'll definitely cook it again.

This was good! Next time I will add a bit more salt, pepper and garlic powder. I cooked it in my 5 Qt slow cooker for 4 hours on high. It came out perfect. One thing I did different for mixing it all up was to mix everything but the meat together first. This got the bread nice and mushy and all the flavors evenly distributed before I added the ground beef.

Saw this recipe & made it about a month ago.  My husband and my boys all agreed that it was the best meatloaf I'd ever made!  We're in the process of making it again now & I told my husband, "I have to go online & rate this so others will know!"  If it weren't for my boys I'd probably add green peppers but other than that this meatloaf is AWESOME!

Fantastic, easy meatloaf recipe!  I didn't have tomato juice on hand, so I substituted a half can of tomato soup instead, it still turned out fabulous.  For those who said that it was too moist or fell apart, I would suggest using ground sirloin (a 90/10 mix) instead of regular ground beef.  It is leaner, healthier and the meatloaf held together better, but was still plenty moist and had great flavor.  Will definitely make again, the only thing I may do different next time is increased the sauce to go on top, it was very tasty.

Wow, this was delicious. Didn't need quite two hours to cook, and let it sit and finish on the counter while I prepared the rest of the meal. The topping was especially flavorful and a hit with the family.

My husband loved this recipe! The only change I made was I had to use clubhouse crackers instead of bread because I didn't have any bread to use. But, the next time I will use a small onion and saute it before mixing it in. There was just too much and some of the onion didn't soften/cook through.

It was just ok, the meatloaf I usually make has much more flavor than this did.  The sauce was too sweet for me but my husband liked it.  I also wanted to add that I am a novice when it comes to cooking and I added the potatoes in with the meatloaf in a roasting pan as one reviewer suggested. Well, they didn't even cook because my 93% lean ground beef didn't have any run off juice to cook them in, so keep that in mind if you decide to try this recipe.

Overall a quick and good recipe. Quite tasty with the right tangy blend of yellow mustard and ketchup. The brown sugar nicely offset any big bite due to the mustard. The meat loaf pretty much kept to the size of the pan and didn't shrink to a tiny loaf :). I did find the meat loaf a bit dry as I used extra lean ground beef and unsalted crackers instead of bread.

Pretty good, but may have been better if I didn't have to tweak ingredients to match the 2 lbs. of hamburger used. Also, didn't properly 'divide' the mustard & ketchup, which indirectly caused me to make the topping more sweet than ideal.

Absolutely loved this recipe! I just got married and am trying to figure out what we both like and this hit the spot! I did use only 1 lb of meat and 4 slices of bread since we were low on just about everything in the house, but it turned out wonderfully!

I was glad to find this recipe because its definatly a great place to start and from there you can go creative with items that might be in your kitchen.
for example, I added 1 diced green pepper. a homemade sweet chili sauce to fill a dip I carved into the loaf & Instead of the 6 peices of white bread I used 2 cold fresh english muffins  (I used 1lb beef vs 1.5 the recipe calls for, and also cutting the cooking time to 1.5 hours instead of 2)
I added some chili pepper and oregano, left out the pepper (rare thing, but were out)

it was gorgeous, simply hits that meatloaf crave off.
home run

This was alright but nothing spectacular.  I don't like the 2 hour cooking time on this though.  Not sure whether I'll use this one again or not.

WOW WOW WOW! This was sooo amazing and moist...I used Italian bread crumbs instead, and I minced some garlic and threw it in there...we had it for leftovers the next day too (Its only my boyfriend and I), he loved this he said it was the most amazing meatloaf he ever had. Haha I recommend this recipe to everyone! Make it! You wont be disappointed!

Wonderful! Moist, good flavor, great topping. I cooked it on a rack instead of in a loaf pan, and used whole grain bread. I'm glad I have leftovers for sandwiches :)

If you like a little extra sweetness, use a combination of ground beef and ground maple sausage and honey mustard instead of just yellow mustard. Like some other reviewers, I didn't need to leave it in the oven for two hours.

This was great meatloaf and will make great leftover sandwhiches.  Next time I'll cut back on the brown sugar for the top and chop up the bread a little bit more fine, but other than that it was GREAT!

I am making this for dinner tonight! I used all ingredients except for the milk and I also added some green pepper, garlic and parmesan cheese.  I fried a bit in a skillet to try it (this is way different than my recipe) and it was fantastic! (even without the topping) I will update after dinner!

For a change of pace, I tried this meatloaf.  I loved it, my husband on the other hand did not.  I believe it was the cubed bread that turned him off, usually I use bread crumbs.  i did add cheese to the meat mixture prior to baking and added cheese on top of the loaf the last 15 minutes of baking.  i will use this recipe again, minus the cubes to see if he notices a difference. Thank You for sharing

This was not nearly as good as I expected it to be after all the good reviews.  It came out a little dry and somewhat bland.  The cubes of bread just did not work, bread crumbs are much better.  And the cooking time is way too long.  I cooked mine for 70 minutes and it was almost overdone.  Will not make agian.

THIS WAS THE BEST MEATLOAF RECIPE EVER!!!!!  
Please make this for your family and friends! I'm serious my husband Loves it and I am happy. It took me maybe 10-15 minutes to prepare. I put potatoes along the sides and make sure you add the mixture of mustard, ketchup and brown sugar (I used honey instead) when its almost done, and pour some of that extra juice out too!!!!ENJOY

Thanks! Wonderful recipee!!

Yum!  A hit!  The only changes I made were splitting the ketchup/sugar mixture in half to put on top and bottom (as suggested) AND I used oatmeal instead of saltines.  Will make again!

The only thing I dislike was that the glaze on the top was burning and I had to take it out 30 mins early and next time I should cut the bread into smaller cubes. But other then that it was really good just need to fix some small things but this recipe I will try again.

Unsure of why anyone disliked this recipe? I noticed some said that it was dry, with no taste. I can only surmise that it's "chef error?"
We all prepare dishes differently; some using more/less spices to taste; therefore, my suggestion is, don't be afraid to add your own amount to season this dish and certainly don't have to follow the recipe! Give it another chance and this time, be bold!

I think this was the 2nd or 3rd time making this. I used 1 lb beef and 1 lb pork and adjusted the recipe amts. the only thing I would change is to specify mincing the onion instead of chopping it. But otherwise we loved this easy recipe. Thanks Mary!

This is a wonderful recipe! I came across this about 2 years ago, and have only used it since. I usually use fresh garlic if I have on hand, with about 1/2 of a red onion. We leave out the salt. Bread/crackers/breadcrumbs all work great. I think the brown sugar glaze makes this recipe! Makes great leftovers!

Extremely easy to make!  Kids couldn't get enough of it; they asked for thirds and fourths!!  I normally used the hunts meatloaf canned version... Well NEVER again!!!  Even the sauce in this recipe is amazing!  My son, who hates ketshup, loved it!  Called it the best meatloaf I've made to date!  Thank you for the great easy recipe!

I made this receipe today!  It was for a community potluck and they ate every bite. I did change it, I didn't do the bread, I did bread crumbs. I wanted the meatloaf a little more dense, but I will do it next time with the bread because it was a little too dense. I loved the topping. I've never done that before, so if you try this receipe, don't skip the  topping. It really adds to the flavor. Great receipe. I added it to my receipe box...

My significant other loves this dish and I really like it. I use 2/3 ground lamb and 1/3 beef for it since lamb has more Omega oils in it. I also make it gluten free with corn bread instead.

This meatloaf stayed together well and the topping was great, but the meatloaf itself lacked flavor.  Maybe some Worcestershire to spice it up a bit.  It needed something.

This meatloaf is really good. I used half ground beef and half ground pork but otherwise I made it exactly like the recipe and i loved it and so did my whole family of picky eaters. This is the only meatloaf my husband will eat. It is sooo moist and delicious. Definitely the best meatloaf I've ever made, or for that matter ever eaten.

made this exactly as written, but from now on will use dry bread crumbs or panko...the fresh bread cubes made the meatloaf fall apart in places when sliced..over all an easy meatloaf to make, with lots of flavor! will make again with the adjustment

This meatloaf is really excellent! My husband loves meatloaf and he thought this was the best. I never cared for meatloaf, myself, even I loved it. I had used a large onion. Next time, a medium will be plenty.

I had been a loyal Campbell's tomato soup meatloaf maker until I found this recipe.  After making this recipe several times and coming out perfect each time no matter how I adjusted it for lack of ingredients it was superb! I gave it for stars for personal taste.  The brown sugar made it a little too sweet so I just use ketchup on top.  Texture has always been perfect and overall a hit at my house.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

I didnt have but a pound of lean ground beef so I used that and I forgot to add the milk.Also used one pkg of stove top instead of bread crumbs. Cooked it for 1hr on 350 and it turned out wonderful I used 4tlb of brown sugar it made it taste like sticky candy on top and one cup of the ketchup perfect amount for the top of the loaf this is very yummie and very sweet so maybe I will use three Tlb of the brown sugar next time thank you

Delicious and easy. I did all of my prep while the baby slept; kept it in the fridge; slathered the topping on and threw it in the oven on the way out the door to dance class (my husband stayed at home with the loaf); then walked in the house to the best smelling meal! And with two minutes to spare on the timer. The meatloaf wasn't dry at all, even though two hours seemed like a crazy amount of time. And the topping wasn't burnt to a crisp like I worried it would be (I guess because the 350 temp wasn't too high). I used four big potatoes cut into 8ths along the edges of the 9x13 glass dish, and thought they looked dry when I pulled out everything from the oven. I quickly drizzled EVOO on them and sprinkled them with salt, but actually, they really weren't dry. The bottoms of them soaked in the juices (I used a 90/10 ground beef so there were still some juices) and they were cooked perfectly. The whole family (husband, teenager, and baby) ate it up and my husband (not a food lover at all) proclaimed it was "not just okay, not just good, but actually delicious."

I truly have to name this "miracle meatloaf" because my husband really liked it!  He has hated every meatloaf recipe I have ever made in 40 yrs of marriage !!  I'm so excited!  It was really good!  I can't wait to have meatloaf sandwiches!  I did change a few things but only because of what I had  on hand.  I used 1 pound of ground beef and 1 pound of ground pork.  I didn't have any white bread so I used 3 bakery hamburger buns.  I sauted the onion till translucent and added 1tsp of fresh minced garlic.  I was out of milk so I used 1/2 cup of chicken broth.  I used Lawrys season salt in place of regular salt..  I sprinkled dry parsley on top.  Other than that I followed the recipe as printed.  I put it in a 9x13 glass dish in a loaf shape with one baking potato cut in 8 pieces around the meatloaf.  Baked at 350 for 1 hour and 20 minutes.  The meatloaf and potatoes were great!
Thank you for this recipe!  I have never written a review before but had to for this one!  A really  good favorite!

We liked it. Good flavor but will adjust the glaze, too sweet for our tastes. It was not as firm as we like, but because not all white breads are made equal, I will be trying it again with different bread.

I found this meatloaf to taste very bland.  I added a tsp. of Worcestershire sauce but next time will double that.  I added 1 1/2 tbsp seasoning salt, but will increase to 2 next time as it still tasted like it needed salt.  I baked the full 2 hours and it was way too done and dried out so I will cut back to 1 and 1/2 hrs. next time and maybe double up on catsup to make it a little more moist.   Also, I took the advice of some and only added 2 tbsp. of brown sugar for the topping, but it was not sweet enough, so I'll definitely use the 3 tbsp. recommended next time if not 4.

This was awesome. First time I was making meatloaf and my family loved it. I added pork sausage and chopped bell pepper - was to die for. Glaze was good but will go easy on the brown sugar and half it next time.

I generally follow the receipe to the letter. However, this time I made a slight change. I substituted half of the ketchup with Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce. It was fantastic!

Great recipe....the topping really makes it.  I spiced it up a bit with some cayenne pepper, cilantro, cinnamon, scallions and fresh garlic.  It gave it a sweet and spicy flavor.  Even the kids ate it!

I was looking for a great meatloaf recipe and this wasn't it. Too much onion and the hot ketchup/mustard mixture on top was a turn-off for my kids. We picked at it. Sorry :(

During my journey to cut down on my family's fast fod intake I decided tolook up recipes so I could start cooking at home more often. My boyfriend and I simply just do not have the same type of taste. I'm Plain Jane, he's "extra flavor this, extra flavor that"! This recipe was the PERFECT medium! He was skeptical about the bread because his momma always used crackers lol, but he LOVED it. One thing I accidently did was put all 3 tablespoons of mustard in the meatloaf, but then the topping I didn't add any..It turned out VERY good...held together well too, even the next day!

I made two meatloafs. I used onions in the one and then substituted onions with onion powder in the other one since I have some picky eaters in the family. Both were good.

We made this with ground deer last night.  Added in Lipton onion soup.  Meatloaf was excellent.  Next time we will use more ketchup over brown sugar.  Put topping on hour in or it will burn!  Will use the recipe again!

I'm not a very good judge of my own cooking (I tend to be overly critical!), but my husband loved it! It was juicy and, once it cooled down a bit, came out of the pan perfectly. :) Definitely something I'll be making again.

Great recipe.  I love meatloaf but my wife not so much.  She raved about this one and had seconds.  I added another half an onion and 2 tsp worcestershire.  Perfect

A good recipe. Next time, I would use less brown sugar. It was a little sweet for us. But the meatloaf was moist and tasty. I did use panko bread crumbs, instead of white bread cubes. And that worked fine. Also, 2 hrs seemed like a long time. I took it out after 1 1/2 hrs.

We enjoyed this.  It has a lot of flavor.  I geared mine to using 4 lbs of meat for guests.  I did add about 1/2 lb of hot sausage and a little worcestershire.  These rest was as written.  We will be having this again.  Thanks for sharing.

My family loved this dish.  I did use a combination of ground pork and ground beef along with a combination of chopped sweet onion and scallion (green onion) which I believe really enhanced the flavor of the overall dish.  I will use this recipe again and again.

Whatever you do, do not cook this for 2 hours. It's way too long and will come out dry and crispy. I also decreased the brown sugar in the topping to 1 Tbsp. Otherwise a great recipe!

Easy and delicious meatloaf recipe.  My husband is not a big ketchup fan, so this was perfect.  I might use a little less brown sugar for the topping next time because we thought it was a bit sweet. Definately a keeper!

My first time making meat loaf.  The only change I made was omitting 2 tbsp sugar.  It was full of flavour, very tasty. Next time I won't use the cubes of white bread because they end up as soggy lumps.  I would also take another reviewer's suggestion to put two slices of bread on the bottom of the pan to soak up the beef fat.  I ended up draining mine on paper towels.

Yummy! I don't usually care for meatloaf but this version was very good.

I used 1/2 lb ground pork and 1 lb ground beef instead of all ground beef.

I also checked to see if it was done using a meat thermometer at 1 1/2 hours (it was nearly done by then).

I was so excited to try this recipe.  It was something different than my grandmother's recipe that the family has been using for 50 years.  Sadly, I was very disappointed.  I increased the ingredients to serve 8.  I cut back on the onion, just slightly and didn't dare to put in the garlic powder.  The meatloaf was extremely oniony to the point it wasn't even good.  I let it sit after removing it from the oven but it still fell apart when sliced.  I guess I'll be going back to Gram's meatloaf which is true comfort food.

I gave this two stars because my boys love meatloaf but hated this one. I followed the recipe without the suggestions. The main thing they hated was all the onion. Maybe this is a more grown up kind of meatloaf. Just not one I would make again.

Thanks Mary!  This meatloaf was awesome.  I substituted the bread for oats and maybe next time just use 1 tbsp. of mustard in the loaf not two.  To make it kid friendly for my house, might leave out the onions next time.  Overall, very tasty!

This will be the meatloaf recipe I use from now on.  It was easy and very delicious.  I took the advice of some other reviewers and used oatmeal instead of bread (it just sounded better to me) and I put it in a bigger pyrex dish and put quartered potatoes around the perimeter of the loaf.  Very tasty!

Magnificent!  I did not have brown sugar so I substituted turbinado sugar and molasses.  Over all it was just fantastic.

excellent! 
Ok, I'm not a major meatloaf person, but this was so good! My husband asked me what I had on top of the meatloaf and he said that made it. I didn't have regular mustard, just a dijorn, but I think it came out pretty good. Guess next time I'll have to try it with the regular mustard to see if there is a difference.

Best meatloaf ever!  We loved it!  I made a bit extra of the glaze because I did what a previous reviewer suggested and placed potatoes around it.  Everything came out delicious!  I highly recommend!

I have made this several times with complete success.  I follow the recipe with one exception...I use 1/2 c. oatmeal instead of the bread (I have a slight wheat allergy).  I divide mine up into smaller loaf pans so that I may freeze them and thaw them out as I need because there are only two of us.  I also put the topping on 30 minutes before they are done to keep the sugars from burning.

Very good!  It is basic.   I made it according to the recipe.  My husband loved it.   I waited until the end to add glaze so it wouldn't burn.  15 minutes was perfect.

Absolutely delicious every time. This meatloaf gets rave reviews whenever i serve it ,especially from guys. I also questioned the 2 hour cooking time and reduced it to 1hr and 20 minutes. Since i don't like  bread in meatloaf i reduced it to 2 slices and 1/2 cup of Italian bread crumbs. The second time I omitted the bread entirely using only bread crumbs. This also eliminated need for milk.  I added one red pepper since green peppers taste too strong to me. Next time, tomorrow, i will follow other's advice and cook onion and garlic in oil prior to adding it to the loaf. I love this dish with mashed potatoes but will use a larger bake pan and add cut up potatoes around the sides of the meatloaf. Thank you Mary for the best meatloaf recipe i have ever had and I am 2 weeks shy of 77 years old."mmmgood"

Made as stated except that I sautéed the onions first. It was just ok. Not super great but not terrible either. It wasn’t firm and only took an hour to cook, not two.

We come back to this meatloaf recipe over and over again. It’s great as is, but we’ve made a few changes along the way. My husband love the topping, so I make extras for dipping. I’ve also made it with Italian seasoned bread crumbs instead of cubed bread. It’s a great base recipe.

I hate meatloaf! I’m Hispanic and my mother cooked 10 days a week for her family of 11, Mexican food. When she made us TV dinners or fried chicken  we were excited for the “treat”. When I married my husband he wanted authentic tortillas (yeah right) Mexican food  but I had to learn American Good House keeping style recipes also. His mom was into casseroles,spaghetti, etc she bought me a Betty Crocker Cookbook 26 years ago. But the main recipe he liked was Meatloaf. I made a good recipe and I always got  compliments. But I would not eat it, I wouldn’t eat anyone’s! BUT I tried this recipe and It is fantastic! Simple ingredients, moist, makes great grilled Parmesan sourdough meatloaf sandwiches. I think the secret is you don’t have to put everything but the kitchen sink into this recipe like, pork, turkey, blah blah blah!I don’t know about you but I don’t a little butcher shop in my freezer and I won’t. I LOVE MARYS MEATLOAF! PS I can’t leave a pic we ate it all. The End

This is a very forgiving recipe — don’t have white bread bc you forgot it at the store? No prob! Cube up the frozen Kings Hawaiian rolls you shoved in the freezer after Christmas! Don’t have all ground beef on hand (or don’t prefer it?) — cool; just use whatever mix of meet you want for that 1.5 lbs (I use beef + prom usually). What I’m saying is that this recipe is awesome, and you can make tweaks as you need to. Like I said, i typically do 1 lb beef and 1/2 lb pork for this. I also have used regular brown sugar and substituted it for golden monkfruit sweetener on occasion. Depending on how much time I have, I do like to add a layer of flavor by browning the onions before adding; often I don’t though and just chock them in raw. Both ways are delish. Otherwise, I make it to a T, because it’s great as written.

Delicious! My husband loved it and he doesn't like much.  Only changes I made were to pre cook the onions in olive oil and I used oatnut bread instead of white.

This meatloaf is absolutely amazing!  I dont ever think I had meatloaf as a kid, but I here a lot of negative funny stories about  having meatloaf for dinner but when I tell MY kids I'm making meatloaf,  we Alllll get excited,  haha. 
However, I DEFINITELY make maybe 3 times as much sauce as the recipe recommends.

I added pork and veal to the meat mix. Added mushrooms. A bit of worchesire sauce and a sprinkle of hot sauce. A big more mustard and ketchup than called for. Came out great. All-in-all i used a completely different recipe than what is shown. So I have no idea how yours will come out.

I used one pound of ground beef and one pound of sage breakfast sausage. I used hot dog buns for the bread and kept the rest of the recipe the same. It was a huge hit at our house.

Great meatloaf! Since I cooked it in two smaller pans, I made extra topping mix to cover both. I accidentally used spicy mustard, so it was a little startling, but still excellent. Next time I may use half spicy, half regular mustard. There's nothing else I would change. Thank you, Mary!

It was good, really easy.  However I found it to moist and crumbly.  My favorite part was the glaze on top I will definitely use that part of the recipe again.

I will definitely make this again. Changes I made:
2/3 cup of ketchup in the meat.
2 Slices of white bread wet and squeezed and torn in pieces.
Added 1 cup of dry Italian seasoned bread crumbs.
Made the glaze, poured off the fat, then poured it over the loaf for the last 25 minutes. 
Used 2 eggs. Mine was done in 1 1/2 hours at 350 degrees. Best I have ever eaten. Thank you Mary.

This was the mostt moist meatloaf ever. I cut out the brown sugar topping as the ketchup is sweet already. Also cooked it for only 1 hour at 375 F. .

Favorite of mine and my husband's.  Only adjustments I made to recipe are (1) use Heinz Balsamic Vinegar Ketchup in place of regular ketchup - delicious, less sweet, (2) use five slices of bread, (3) bake for 1 hour and 20 mins, not 2 hours.

Loved it with a couple of tweaks.  I used red onion, and for the glaze on top, I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce, since I was trying to use up a huge bottle of it.  Have made it this way several times now and it is always a big hit.

I have tried several meatloaf recipes on this website and so far this the best.  The only thing change  made is I used seasoned salt instead of regular.  Very good!

This is my GO TO for meatloaf. I've make it at least once a month. And I've made it so many times I don't even need to look at the recipe anymore. The only thing I do different is I used Italian breadcrumbs instead of bread

I like this recipe and I like how it turned out. I withheld some of the bread cubes as I thought it would be too much, and I'm glad I did because it would've been. Next time I will also cut in half the amount of mustard in the topping. I like it a lot though it has very good flavor.

Thank you Mary!  This is the best meatloaf I've ever eaten!  For 41 years I would never touch this dish, but then on a whim I tried this recipe and followed it exactly. Now I LOVE meatloaf!

Loved this recipe but I substituted packaged seasoned stuffing for the bread. Cooked as a loaf on a cookie sheet instead of in meatloaf dish.

My family loves this meatloaf. The topping gives it a sweet, savory, even a bit of tangy taste to this moist meatloaf. I don't make it in a loaf pan, I make a "mound of meat" in a large glass pie pan and put it in the oven. It's never turned out dry and is always full of flavor.

This was delicious and very moist.  I omitted the chopped onion and added 1 tsp onion powder.  Didn't have any regular yellow mustard so I used 1 tsp dry mustard in meatloaf mix and 1 tsp dry mustard in glaze.  I found that an hour and a half cooking time was plenty.

I liked this recipe. I used meatloaf mix instead of ground beef. It came out great. The glaze was a little too sweet for me but I put it on after 45 minutes to prevent burning. That could have been why.  Next time I'll use less brown sugar. Overall a good recipe.

I've tried to serve meatloaf to my youngest son periodically throughout his life, and he's never liked it...until this one.  Of course, he's 22 years old now so it took a while to find one he would eat.  He and his girlfriend loved it!  He's even asked me to make it again - which is a pretty big deal for a dedicated "picky eater".  I made it almost exactly according to the recipe, although  I cut back a bit on the brown sugar after reading the reviews, and I thought a 2 hour cooking time was a bit excessive so that was reduced to ensure thorough cooking without drying it out. It's a hit in our house!

Followed the  recipe ingredients as it, but added 8oz of sliced baby bella mushrooms that had been sauted in olive oil. I also crumbled the chopped white bread in the  chopper before adding to meatloaf.  Placed 1/2 of mixture at the bottom of the dish, made a shallow trench and placed mushrooms in that, then covered with remaining mixture. Cooked at 350 for 1 hour, then 15 mins at  400.  Really good meatloaf, came out very moist.

Very tasty.  Smelled wonderful as it was cooking.  I added basil to the meatloaf as it's a favorite spice in our house.  And I used bread crumbs instead of bread. Also, I cooked them in a muffin pan at 350 for 20 minutes.  So much quicker and if you have leftovers they freeze so nicely.

Very nice. The addition of ketchup and mustard to the meat before cooking was the clincher. Very flavorful even without the also very nice topping. But use a digital instant read thermometer because 2 hour cooking time was a bit too long. Test at 1 hour 30 minutes.

This is my mom's meatloaf almost exactly, and it is awesome. Be aware that the cubed white bread is one of the "keys" and that  using bread crumbs, cracker crumbs, oatmeal, or whatever else you use in YOUR meatloaf is not going to recreate this delicious, moist, and surprisingly unusual meatloaf. 
The only differences in my mom's and this - and they are, to my less-than-impartial eye, important ones, are these:

1) we always mix the seasoning, egg, etc. up separately then add the bread cubes (plain old white bread like Sunbeam - not dried either, fresh) in first to moisten them gently, then fold in the ground beef. You are not looking to blend them in, they should maintain their integrity - kind of like blueberries in pancakes, lol. 
2) we add a little Worcestershire to that part plus a dash of Kitchen Bouquet. 
3) after meatloaf is formed and placed in the loaf pan (absolutely works best in a loaf pan) rub the outside of it with a splash or two of Kitchen Bouquet, then the take two fingers and make 4 sets of "holes" or indentations (second knuckle or so deep) for a total of eight - rather like a domino. We then put the ketchup over this without any additions. When it Brown's and caramelized? Mmmm -  it will be plenty sweet!
4) I have never used lean ground beef, though I am about to try it that way to save myself from the other crucial step if you don't - drain the pan about halfway through the cooking process. Otherwise - and it's certainly edible if you don't - there will

Everyone in my house loved it. I added 1tsp of ground cayenne pepper and some orange zest to the sauce. It really complimented and brought down the sweetness and brought out the flavor of the meat. I also added chopped parsley and 1tsp of ground cayenne pepper to the meat. Absolutely delicious dish.

This meat loaf is amazing.  My family lives it and become excited when they learn I will make it for dinner.  My three small children do not like chunks of onions in thier food so I puree it instead of cutting them in squares,  I substitute the white bread with Italian breadcrumbs. Since I am Latina, I use a little bit of my Spanish seasonings such as adobo, sazón, orégano and of course the ground black pepper to season the meat.  I also use peeled garlic and puree it with the onion instead of using the garlic powder.  Honey mustard in substitute for the yellow mustard  is great to give it that extra sweet kick with the brown sugar.  Delicious, Delicious, Delicious!

My family loves any meatloaf, but me, not so much. However, this one, I love! Maybe it's the simplicity of the recipe, I don't know. But this is now our all-time favorite meatloaf recipe. Didn't change a thing when I made it. Best recipe for meatloaf ever in our opinion.

Very good! I just used about 2/3 cup of bread crumbs instead of cut up bread and added worcestershire sauce. I also took out the onion. I cooked it the two hours exactly and it turned out perfect!

I made this, but as usual when I cook, I made a lot of changes.  For instance, I used ground venison, rather than beef.  I added olive oil, beef base and worcestershire sauce to flavor the venison.  I plan to make it again, but next time I will substitute oatmeal for the bread.  I am hoping this will give it a better consistency.  My hubby liked it too but thought it was a little sweet, so next time I'll reduce the brown sugar.

I've made it many times... Sometimes I don't put that much brown sugar if any at all... And sometimes I use tomato paste for the top with sprinkled brown sugar. But yeah this is my go to recipe. I even have a pic of one that was attacked before I could even take a picture haha.

Although simple to put together, I made a few changes to this recipe.  Instead of using milk, I used butter milk.  I added a cup of grated parmesan cheese, panchetta and one cup of chopped onion.    I then added low sodium marinara sauce, instead of catsup.  Before setting up in the pan, I placed butt ends of bread to the bottom of the pan.  Once, patted into the pan, I topped with more marinara sauce and crushed Funyuns.  This meatloaf was the bomb!  Definitely will be making again!

Pretty good, not the best, though. I made it exactly as written, using 85% ground beef. I'm not a big fan of mustard, but that's not very prominent here. It held together pretty well.

OMG! So delicious! I could never master my mom's recipe. But this one is better than hers! Lol. My family LOVED it! I used the recipe for 10 servings. I used 6 slices of bread instead of 10 & I  didn't  use garlic powder. I'm no longer searching for a good meatloaf recipe!

This is the base for my go to meatloaf recipe! My family likes a little more spice to things, so I trade out old fashioned oats for the bread cubes, do half burger and half sausage, and add pepperjack cheese.

Absolutely delicious.  Way better than the meat loaf I usually made.  I have cooked it a few times now and will definitely keep this recipe in the books.  On the sweeter side, so if it's too sweet back off on the ketchup and brown sugar.

Only change I made was only using 5 slices of bread. But we tear it apart in pretty small pieces and since my son was helping I let him quit at 5. It was just fine after just 1-1.5 hrs in the oven, very moist. Everyone loved it except one kid who has decided he doesn't want to bite into onion pieces. I guess next time I'll just puree them instead. ;)

Great recipe! Only meatloaf I make now. Have been using this basic recipe for about four years now. Can change it up many ways. 
Only standard difference for me is that I use homemade bread or rolls.

Very good, I used 1/2 cup oatmeal instead of bread, I added Italian seasoning and coriander(cilantro).Also instead of ketchup  I used Italian sauce and less brown sugar and the mustard.
At 350F for 1 1/2hour in preheated oven.
We enjoy it, and you'll too.

This was great! My hard to please dinner guests said it was the best ever. The only change that I made is that I added a few glurcks of Worcestershire sauce. I'm not sure how much a few "glurcks" are exactly, I'm guessing a 1-2 tablespoons. It was really quite good. Thanks so much.

Very good. Even my two year old who doesn't eat much meat gobbled it up! I didn't put the sauce over the top, just didn't know how it would go over. Cooked it for a little over an hour, but I scaled it down to 4 servings. I used a meat thermometer to check that it was done. :)

Wow...thought my meatloaf recipe was good. But this was quite a bit better. Made this a little bit differently. But followed the recipe for the most part. Used 2 pounds of ground beef and added red potatoes with onions...had to stir the potatoes around a bit so they wouldn't dry out. Added some garlic pepper (It's the Italian in me). Tasted stupendously. Thanks.

Mine came out dry; next time I will double or triple the amount of ketchup mixed into the loaf & also double the amount of sauce for the top! Good otherwise.

Loved this recipe, was very worried at first but it turned out awesome! I'm Celiac (Gluten Free) so I altered it a bit. I added 2 pieces of Dempster's Gluten Free Whole Grain bread, with 1/4 cup of Gluten Free Bread crumbs and some milled flaxseed to keep it healthy. I love onion so I cut up a whole onion then added 1/2 tsp of onion powder. For the coating I only added 1/2 tsp of brown sugar because I saw other people comment that topping was too sweet and added 1/2 tsp of chicken and rib bbq sauce. I also added 1/3 tsp of honey mustard to the beef mixture, and 1/2 tsp of Worcestershire sauce. Everyone loved it and couldn't even tell it was Gluten Free :) highly recommend this recipe!!!

We loved this meatloaf. I made the following changes: 1/2 large onion, 3 slices whole wheat bread sliced into small cubes and dampened with water. No milk and added about 1 tablespoon of brown sugar to the mix. I have tried this recipe before and my family did not like the mustard/ketchup/sugar mixture for the top of the meatloaf so I just used ketchup. I used a 9X12 pan and put the loaf in the middle and the quartered potatoes around. I basted the potatoes after about 45 minutes. Cooked for 1 1/2 hours only. Nice and moist. Next time I will line the pan with heavy foil and oil it. Very tasty and an easy recipe. Thank you!

This is a really moist and tasty meatloaf. Like many others I made a few changes. I only had 1lb of beef, so  of course that's what I used. Instead of the bread crumbs, I took another reviewer's advice and used oats. I was low on ketchup, so I used mild salsa instead. I sauteed onions (plus garlic) in olive oil before adding them to the loaf. And because I sometimes suck at following directions, I added my brown sugar in the loaf. ;/(I got some of it out though) .... Again like another reviewer, because I only had 1lb of beef, I cooked my loaf for 1.5 hrs. It was delicious. My boyfriend went back for seconds. ;)

YUM!  I doubled the recipe, added ground pork and some Worcestershire sauce, cut back the brown sugar a bit for the glaze, used seasoned bread crumbs & cooked for about an hour and a half.  So moist. We loved it!

Meatloaf is one of my husband's favorite dishes and he absolutely loves this recipe. Like another reviewer, I used 1/2 cup gluten free whole oats rather than bread and it was amazing-- both the flavor and texture. I've also started using coconut palm sugar or maple syrup instead of brown sugar. This is the ONLY recipe I've been using now for over two years.

This was yummy! I substituted 1/2 cup seasoned bread crumbs in place of the bread. I cut the salt in half because of my substitution and it was wonderful. Everyone was disappointed that it went so fast and no leftovers!

I made this without the glaze (husband doesn't like the sweet stuff), but I did put a very thin layer of bbq sauce on the top before baking. I also used a veal/pork/beef ground combo, and only a pound of it. I baked it in a 6 cup muffin tin for about 45 minutes on 375 degree. Soooo good - moist and not too crumbly. This will be my new go-to meatloaf recipe.

Was really good. Hubby really liked the glaze. Did not take full 2 hours to bake. Next time I will grind up bread crumbs, as cubing them made for some larger slimy pieces. Otherwise followed recipe and will make again!

I usually don't like left over meat loaf, but this was really good just heated up a slice at a time along with a piece of buttered bread for lunch. Since I'm not a picky eater I had enough left over after cutting the recipe in half for 4 lunches. Thank you Mary it is excellent. I give it 5 stars.

I follow the recipe just at it is. I don't know what i did wrong because it is too soft, it didn't stay together and had too much juice. The onion can be cut to half because is too much!!! . The taste is ok, edible but i don't think my kids will like it. I was expecting something different, it's the first time i made meatloaf and i'm very disappointed.

We love it! We aren't into mustard so we didn't use it. We added a tbsp of parsley ... brush the top with BBQ sauce instead of ketsup... and then sprinkled with krispy onion toping (the kind u use on green bean casserole) AMAZING

Nice sweet and sour flavour to the meatloaf.  Laughed a lot during the meal as the sauce on top tended to stick to the back of our teeth.  Kids thought that was very funny.  i believe that was simply a case of "rushed cooking" and not mixing ingredients well enough before pouring on top.  
Have made many different versions of meatloaf, but do think this is my favorite.

I'm surprised so many people liked this.  It was so not good. 350 degrees for 1 hr is all you need and ritz crackers (10 or so) instead of the bread is MUCH better. Meatloaf is such a simple meal and this recipe did not cut it for me or my family.

I was eagerly waiting for a spectacular meatloaf. 
I stuck to the recipe as I always do with a new recipe.
 We all were very disappointed with the results. 
I will not make this recipe again.

Oh my goodness... OUTSTANDING!! I only had 1 pound of lean ground beef, so I added a 1/2 pound of ground sausage. (And I am NOT a fan of sausage, so I thought I wouldn't like it very much.) I sauteed the onion and garlic before mixing with the meat mixture, and used deli mustard instead of yellow. This was truly the best meatloaf ever!!

Been making this recipe for years.. only difference is we use oats instead of bread and leave out the garlic. Sometimes we throw in a tablespoon or 2 of brown sugar to the meat mixture. Best meatloaf recipe ever...

I like to add a tablespoon or two of horseradish to the mustard ketchup mixture.

Super tasty.  I loved the topping.  I used 2 lbs ground beef so I added a bit more ketchup and mustard to the loaf ingredients.  But it was excellent!

I have been using this recipe for years and have never had any one dislike it.  It has become one of the meals my family loves for me to cook. I sometimes add green bell pepper to it and a bit of sage it is delicious!

Great meatloaf recipe!  I was skeptical about the 2 hour cooking time so I took it out at 1 1/2 hours.  It was crumbly but completely cooked.  I don't want to wait that long now so I use the same recipe and divide it up in muffin tins to cut the cooking time down to 30-40 minutes.  The best part is that I can scoop out the little mini-loaves and the beef fat stays at the bottom.  Seems healthier to me!

Not sure how this has such high ratings. Followed recipe as is. Did not like the bread in it at all, and the glaze was too sweet. Could not eat more than a few bites of this, even though I was still hungry. I was looking for a different meatloaf recipe but, I think I will just stick to the usual way I make it. This just didn't cut it.

This was the first meatloaf I have ever prepared for my family.  It was a hit!  I combined it with baked yellow skin potatoes washed and rubbed with olive oil and salt.  It made using the oven more efficient.  I actaully got to sit down 1/2 hour before dinner as the prep time was used up long before.  This is definitely a way to use up ground beef that may not be the best quality.  Approx 1/2 way through, I used a bread end to absorb extra fat that was bubbly up the sides of the loaf pan.  It seemed to work!  I added peas to complete the meal.  Miss Mary will definitely stay a staple in my "family approved" recipes.  Love this website.  I now have many great ideas for a Christmas Eve Potuck Party!

I've never like meatloaf before until I made this recipe-my whole family loves it. The only change that I made was to add a little bit of chopped green peppers to it & make a little bit extra sauce for the top...it is the most moist meatloaf I have ever had!

I used ground turkey, therefor I used two eggs and used a cup of bread crumbs instead of bread slices. It tasted good. I have had better meatloaf but this was still very good. Next time I wont use as much brown sugar on the topping I found it made the flavor too sweet. There's sugar in ketchup.

I made this for my family, and they loved it! Even the picky two year old :)
I didn't have any onions so I used onion powder instead, and it turned out yummy. I cooked it a little over an hour :)

Moist and yummy.  The only changes I made were to use a meatloaf meat mix (beef, pork, veal) and to bake it in a 11 x 7 pan after forming it into an approximately 9 x 5 loaf to allow some of the fat to drain off

A nice, simple to make meatloaf!  I customized it, since I only used 1/2 lb of meat, and a few other things, so it is a highly adaptable recipe.  Instead of dry mustard, I used a really nice parmesan/oregano spice.  This recipe is similar to one my grandfather made when I was a child, and just a delicious!

I made a few changes. I added carrots, worcestershire sauce, minced garlic, sharp shredded cheese and then provolone cheese on top. I didn't have plain mustard so I used honey mustard instead. This was the best meatloaf ever!!!! I also cooked cut up potatoes in the same pot. I can't tell you enough how good this was!!
