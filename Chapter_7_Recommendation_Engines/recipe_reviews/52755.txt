This recipe had incredible flavor, was such a change from the normal boring chicken recipe.  I did take the advice of others and tweak it a bit....I marinated the chicken all day in 2 tsp curry powder, 1/2 tsp. ground ginger, black pepper and salt, then sauteed until just done and golden brown in skillet, removing chicken then  adding 2 cloves of minced garlic, 1/4 cup of vidalia onion and a dash of olive oil.  When the onion was just translucent I added the chicken broth (which I increased to 1 1/2 cups per someone else's recommendation, we don't like crisp rice) and all other ingredients.  Near the end I added the chicken, cubed, back in along with an additional 1 tsp of curry, red pepper flakes, a dash of cayenne for some heat (using Madras curry powder, not enough heat for us!) and the result was an absolute fantastic dish that my husband is still raving about.  The mangoes added a wonderful sweet tartness that went so well with the curry and slight pop from the cayenne.  I also added grated carrot and thawed frozen peas in the last 10 minutes or so which gave us a great, healthy meal in less than an hour, and only one dish to wash!!!  Please try this recipe, and Thank You! Linda!

My husband and I loved this recipe!  I browned the chicken first then added the rice and other ingredients.  I also added light coconut milk and pepper in the last 5 minutes of cooking.  I decided to add the mango at the end so it wouldn't get mushy.  My husband said to be sure to put this recipe on the "rotation".

I made this the other night for my boyfriend (who loves mangoes) and I have never seen a bigger smile on his face. I ended up adding about a 1/2 cup of coconut milk at the last 5 minutes and it was absolutely perfect.

I loved this recipe but I changed it up a bit.

First, I browned the chicken in olive oil for a couple minutes per side.  I took the chicken out of the pan and added garlic and onions and cooked until carmelized (about four minutes).

Then I added the rest of the ingredients.  I did not have any wine on hand, so I used ALIZE instead - a blend of natural passion fruit juices and cognac liquor.  It really brought out the flavour of the mango.

A very nice and easy dish to make.

Very Nice.  Well received dinner at my table.   I too saute'd onions and garlic ( left out the ginger because my curry already had sufficient heat ) and 
browned the chicken.  This was excellent
with a vegie melange side dish that included green peas and some apples for sweetness to offset the heat of my balti 
curry powder.   The mango was a great addition to the rice.   We will have this again .. and it makes a great lunch the next day.

This was sooo good. I had several fresh mangoes on hand and needed a recipe. So where do all the best cooks go? Here of course. I didn't have any parsley or wine on hand. I know, I couldn't believe it either. I doubled up on the broth to make up the difference. The only things I would change is to add more rice. It was wonderful. I cubed my chicken as others suggested and also did the onion\garlic\ginger combo before hand. I also added more curry. Can't tell you how much because I don't measure, but I would guess I doubled the amount called for. Oh I was about to forget the most amazing thing about this recipe. My five year old ate it and LIKED it. Try this recipe.

I liked this recipe a lot since I never cooked with curry before and liked it, and the fact that it was soooo easy to make since it was cooked in one pan.  Seeing other reviews, I tried adding a little more flavor to it by sauteing some garlic and shallots in a little oil beforehand.  I also covered the chicken in curry and seasonings.  I thought the chicken turned out a little tough and next time I will cook it a few minutes shorter than the 20-25 minutes.  (I also believe that if the chicken was marinated first and a little more seasonings were added to the rice for a little kick, it would be a little tastier).  All in all, it's an easy meal that looks and tastes like you've spent more time on it.  Thanks.

Very good. I also tweaked this after reading some other reviews. I chunked the chicken and marinated it with curry, fresh ginger and S&P for an hour. In a skillet I cooked the chicken with some olive oil, removed it and then added 2 cloves of chopped garlic and the rest of the ingredients. I substituted jasmine rice which needs more liquid, so I increased the broth to one 14 ounce can and added equal amounts of water and wine, as needed, re-seasoning with curry, S&P, to taste to the additional liquid. I added the chicken and mango at the last minute to the pan, just stirring to heat the chicken back up. I will definitely make this again.

I tried this on my family first. I cook for a house for troubled young men so I wanted something different to try. I'll add more curry powder on chicken next time. Rice is excellent and the whole thing took very little time.

I added garlic to the curry, and onions to the rice. I used less chicken broth (powder) than supposed to and it turned out just perfect! Everyone seemed to enjoy this wonderful meal! ^^b

I made this just as the recipe said, and the chicken tasted good, but the rice was not cooked enough even though I cooked it for an extra 10 minutes. Also, I usually enjoy mangoes but the broth gave them a salty-sweet taste which I didn't care for. Perhaps it would be better to cook the rice separate?

Wow, this was delicious--I know I'll make this over and over again! For such a fast, easy dish, I didn't expect it to have such perfect flavor. The mango and curry combination is divine. As others suggested, I cubed the chicken and added more curry powder. I didn't have wine, so I used all chicken stock in place of water and wine. Next time, I might try adding crushed red pepper to give it a tropical heat.

Great Recipe! I tried it on Lamb with a dash of cayenne and some garlic power. Served with a side of yogurt sauce. It was delicious!

Overall great, although brown rice took waaaay longer to cook than 20-25 mins in the recipe. I added more curry and didn't use wine at all. Definitely will make it again!

My family loves rice so I doubled the amount of rice, broth, water and wine. I also used Rice Wine in place of white wine and chopped and seared the chicken along with cubed chuck roast. And I also used fresh parsley because it's growing in the yard :) OH and I couldn't find the curry for the life of me so I used one of the Golden Curry rectangles and chopped it up and rubbed it on with turmeric and cumin.

I'd make this again, only next time I'd use more curry powder.  I took the advice of an earlier reviewer and marinated the chicken in a mix of 1 tablespoon oil, 2 tablespoons vinegar, 1 tsp curry powder, and 1/2 tsp ground ginger.  I used another tsp of curry powder like the recipe called for but if I make this again, I'll add an additional tsp.  My boyfriend was sketchy about the mango and chicken together but when he tried it, he thought it was great.

Loved the mango rice portion of the dish.  I used jasmine rice, as someone recommended, and it was delish.

The chicken wasn't very curried, however.  Next time I'll try more curry and add in some garlic to the rub, as suggested.

This recipe was very good.   My husband who is a picky eater really enjoyed the sweetness of the rice and the curry in the chicken. I changed it a bit because I always try to cater to likes and dislikes.   I doubled the amount of curry, added about 1/4 of peanut oil, 1/2 of water,some fresh garlic and ginger and mixed this all together in a ziploc and marinated the chicken in it for about 2 hours.   Instead of white wine I only had rice wine and it was yummy.  I also followed the advice of browning the breasts.  I kept them seperate and seved them on the side.  I added a bit of green onion at the end.   Very good recipe, we will definately have this again soon and with company!

This was soooo easy and amazingly delicious!  I didn't have any white wine on hand, so I used vermouth.  I also substituted chicken boullion and water for the chicken broth.  The rice was amazing and complemented the chicken perfectly.  And the best part?  This all happened in one pan!

This recipe is amazingly flavorful and super easy! I love that it can all cook in one pan. That being said, browning the chicken first is a good idea; it may not get done all the way through at the low temp for the rice. I also took the recommendation to saute some garlic and onion in the pan before starting the rice, and the flavors really complemented the sweetness of the mango. I recommend using jasmine rice. Just add an extra 1/2 cup of liquid (preferably water or broth). For a more intense curry flavor, marinating the chicken 4-8 hours lets the spice seep into the meat. Delicious! A different flavor from the usual without being overpowering or objectionable--even my two-year-old ate some!

I can't give this 5 stars because I changed it.  I followed the first step of the recipe and put the chicken in the oven to bake.  I only used chicken broth (no wine) with the rice and cooked it stovetop with the brown sugar and parsley.  When the chicken was almost done, I added ginger, a dash of garlic powder, mango and sliced peaches to the chicken.  Then I let the fruit warm slightly to blend the flavors.  Served it over the rice with a dash of red pepper flake.  Very tasty!

Great recipe, and easy weeknight dish. I used low fat coconut milk and skipped the broth; you may need to add a little water (depending on how long you simmer it.) It is one of the best chicken recipes I've found on allrecipes!

A little bland. I would add more curry powder to the rice itself and some cayenne.

Fantastic - I added another 1/2 cup of wine to rice and will brown chicken first next time, since I lost some of the flavor when boiled with the rice.  Everyone loved it!!!

This was ok.  It was my 1st recipe using Curry.  Both my hubby & kids said I didn't need to make it again.  It was very bland, even though I took other's comments and added more curry.  I thought the rice was good, even though a little on the sweet side.  Being that I live in Honduras I'm always willing to try new recipes with Mango as it is my favorite fruit and bountiful during mango season.  Thanks for submitting.

Good simple weeknight meal.  I used brown rice (all I had) so my cook time was longer.  Also added half a red onion to the rice and some grated ginger.  I marinated some shrimp in sirracha and white wine and sautéed separately since they would be overcooked if cooked with the rice.  Will try again with chicken.  Definiately marinate the protein otherwise it could be a bit bland.

I marinate the chicken in 3 tbs curry, 1 tbs ginger and some fresh ground pepper. Then put them in the oven while the rice cooks. I also use coconut milk in the rice instead of water and wine. It's really good, like easy, healthy, comfort food. Thank you!

Both my husband and I really enjoyed this dish.  The flavors of curry and mango compliment each other well. I did add about 1/2 tsp more curry powder like some of the reviewers suggested.

Guests felt it could have used more curry. I would have liked more sweetness. But overall it was well received and will make again.

This recipe didn't do anything for us.  The rice ended up very starchy and the taste was overwhelmed by the chicken broth.  I won't be making this again.

I loved this recipe.  Especially the rice, I couldn't get enough.  I did take the advice to brown the chicken first as well as the onion garlic ginger mixture....I also used a full cup of white wine. I don't think the recipe would could have done without the ginger. Wonderful!!  The smell is fantastic and it is so simple.  My eight year old loved it too. Next time I think I will cube the chicken or Marinade before hand for a more flavor.

The chicken came out perfectly and very tasty.  The only change I would make is to add curry to the rice as well, but this is personal preference since we love curry!  Thanks for sharing!

EASY!!!!!! This is a simple recipe that tastes like you worked a long time to prepare.  My husband & I both thought this was a keeper.  Since I didn't have chicken broth, I used chicken bouillon with water to make the broth. I also used instant rice.  I had never used mango before & I really liked it.

This was a relatively easy dish that everyone enjoyed (even my 14 year old). I added a bit more diced mango than the recipe called for and a half cup of coconut milk about 5 minutes before serving. I served it with creamed spinach and naan bread. Next time I may add some peas.

I followed the recipe except left out the water and instead of cooking on top of the stove, baked it in a 350 degree oven for about an hour.   When done it seemed bland to us so I sprinkled more curry and red pepper over the top.

The mango didn't really stand out enough, but I give this 4 stars for how easy it was to put together.  I had everything on hand except wine, so I used all chicken broth. I cubed the chicken and used an extra tsp of curry, as well as some ground coriander and cayenne pepper. Then I browned the chicken in olive oil, butter, garlic and chopped ginger. It was still rather bland, so maybe next time I will take the advice of other reviewers and marinate the chicken for a while first. I would also like to try adding coconut milk. It does seem like it's missing something. Also, the rice was too mushy for my liking, so I would adjust all the liquids. But it's good enough to keep trying!

This is one of my favorites! Mango is my favorite fruit and it pairs nicely with the curry and other flavors. The only changes I made to this recipe were to cube the chicken before coating it w/the curry powder mixture and to add more curry powder. This gave it a stronger flavor and reduced cooking time. I also used jasmine rice.

This is really good if the mangos are in season.  If your mango is not very good, it does not flavor the chicken properly.  However, the recipe is simple and the result very good for a quick evening meal.

Just okay.  Not a very exciting dish...needs something else.

My family enjoys this recipe.  We use jasmine rice instead of white rice though.  It goes really well with the mango flavor.

We enjoyed this meal last night but it wasn't the best chicken dish I've ever had.  I took everyone's advice and cubed the chicken but I think I should have waited to put it in with the rice for a little while because it was somewhat dried out.

I cubed the chicken, but otherwise made this recipe as directed.  It was ... okay (*shrug*).  Edible, but nothing spectacular.

I was surprised that these ingredients -and I did make the changes that other reviewers suggested- combined to make such a boring meal.  Not bad, just not good...

I thought this recipe was very bland and dry. The chicken turned out tough. I was using a homemade curry powder from an Indian friend and I have made other curry dishes that turned out great, so it wasn't the curry powder. I ended up making a quick coconut curry sauce to pair with this meal so it would have some flavor.

I actually made this recipe as-is, save for cubing the chicken before tossing it in the pot. It was pretty good. I'll probably take the advice of the other reviewers regarding a little onion and garlic next time because the original recipe was missing something, but it wasn't obvious as to what. Definately a recipe that I'll toy around with, but close to perfect already.

Not impressed with the recipe as it stands, but if I had taken the time to read other reviews I would have added more ingredients and browned the chicken. My husband enjoyed the dish, but I felt it needed more flavor. Also, about 1/2 of our rice was crunchy - needed more water and occasional stirring, but this could be due to our old pot lids!

Yummy! I went looking for a recipe to use up my mangos and this hit the spot. I took someone else's advice and browned the seasoned chicken first, then sauteed some chopped onion and...ginger (it said garlic, but I remembered wrong). It was yummy. I went a little heavier on the curry as we're fans and used seasoned salt instead of regular. If it weren't for the kids I'd have added some heat with cayenne. Next time I might dice the chicken up in the rice and serve that way.

I changed this slightly and softened an onion, garlic and ginger before adding the liquid and rice. I also used 1 cup of wine instead of half water half wine and added frozen peas in the last 10 mins. This makes a nice, easy, inexpensive one dish meal. It's not like what you would get at your local Indian restaurant but it hits the spot.

This dish was good.  My husband, who doesn't like curry, enjoyed it, so it must be good!  A nice way to try something different, & very easy to make to boot!

This was very easy.  Didn't have the wine, so just added the whole can of chicken broth.  Parts of the rice was crunchy, so i added more water.  I would just add 1/3 cup more water to the recipe.  it turned out really good.
