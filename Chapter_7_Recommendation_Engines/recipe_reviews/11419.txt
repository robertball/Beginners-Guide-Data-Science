I was looking to spruce up a boxed brownie mix and found this recipe.  Even though I totally changed it, I still give it 5 stars for giving me the idea!  I used a boxed brownie mix in a 13x9 pan, added the butterscotch chips and marshmallows to the prepared mix, spread in the pan and baked for about 30 minutes.  The marshmallows did "rise" to the top of the pan, but it looks so pretty and tastes wonderful!  The marshmallows got nice and soft and gooey and the chips make a great addition to the boxed mix.  Thanks for the idea!

These brownies, if prepared exactly as says, come out far too sweet when tried shortly after coming out of the oven. A couple of hours later, we enjoyed them even less. It was disappointing, that is until the next day when I woke up hungry and tried a small piece and, OH MY WORD. SO YUM!!! If you let these "brownies" (more like a cookie/candie bar) sit over night in the pan (with lid to keep them fresh) they turn out to be awesome! Thanks a lot, like Im not heavy enough as is. XD

Very good. Loved this, I only used marshmallows and butterscotch chips and I used box brownies. You just need to make sure you line your pan.

These have been my favorite brownies for 18 years now! Growing up my best friends mother made these (with 2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips though)and I've loved them ever since. I now make these for my own kids who love them too. These are very rich, moist,and flavorful with the butterscotch & marshmallow making them distinctive. I have found that I need to cook them for 28 minutes or else they are slightly undercooked. (My original 18 yr. old recipe card says 20-25 minutes.)

This is an awsome recipe! I made this recipe last minute for Thanksgiving, and it was a huge hit. The only change I made was to use semi-sweet chips instead of milk chocolate, since I find butterscotch to be sweet especially with the marshmallows. Will definately make again!

After reading a number of reviews it became clear that those who really like these brownies are those, like Hubs, who like their desserts rich, gooey and intensely sweet.  And chocolate doesn’t hurt either.  Me, not so much – because these are rich, gooey and intensely sweet.  I lined my pan with foil for ease in removing them from the pan and cutting.  Baking them at 350 degrees for 25 minutes was perfect.  I  threw these together last night in the time it took Hubs to fall asleep in front of the TV – now that’s fast!  They turned out perfectly and this morning they were all ready to cut and package.  An easy, quick solution to satisfy a huge sweet tooth.

Wow, these are sooo sweet!  I know, what do you expect when your main ingredients are butterscotch chips, chocolate chips and marshmallows, with a little sugar and flour to bind them together!  They are more like a butterscotch bar, with chocolate and marshmallows.  Very chewy, and did I mention sweet?  They are much better after sitting for several hours, or even over night.  I will end up making these again, I'm sure.

I agree with the poster who said to leave them to cool overnight.  I tried a warm one, and it was so-so.  But the next day, they were fabulous!  I made half of this recipe, and it halved very well.  Instead of baking it in a 9 x 13 pan, I used an 8 x 8 one and it was perfect.  Will definitely make these again.

Doesn't replace my husband's favorite fudge brownie recipe, but came very close!  I think the next time I make this I'll be a little heavy handed with the marshmallows because some do seem to disappear when cooked.

There wasn't much of a brownie at all.   It was mostly a gooey topping that might be good over icecream.  I expected more after the reviews.

these brownies are as ooey and gooey as they sound but the perfect indulgence as an after dinner treat. i would recommend using a mixer on medium speed before adding the marshmallows and chocolate chipss, seems to come out with smoother results.

I love sweets and these were to sweet for me.  It was just to much.   I did like the butterscotch base though.  Might try again without marshmallows and one cup of choclate chips.

I made these for the first time this weekend for friends.  They were a huge hit, and my husband said "you are definitely going to be making these again!"  Per other reviews, they are better 12-24 hours after baking.  Lots of possibilities for customizing, too....

These are a sugar coma waiting to happen, but sure are yummy!  Not a brownie at all so don't expect that texture.  More gooey than that.  I took them to work and had many people ask for the recipe.

These are really yummy!  Absolutely delicious and special.  I did have an issue with gooeyness, but only in the center.  I cut & removed (to our mouths!) the entire outer strip, then put the remaining amount back in the oven for another 15 minutes.  A little extra effort, yes, I know.  Totally worth it!!

This recipe is really good! Although it's really gooey, if you let it sit in the open overnight after you've baked it, it pretty much candies partially. Now I say partially, but that's what makes it good.

These were great. Although I didn't have butterscotch chips and wasn't going out in a snow storm to get them. I substituted chocolate chips, and they still turned out great. I took them to work and everyone loved them. They were extra chewy!!

thee recipre turned out; wasn't burt/dry/underooked; nothing like that. however, my boyfriend and i did not like it at all; probably because i typically use more natural ingredients.did not taste good and i easily could have made something much better with the time i took for these.

These were amazing!! I added a little bit more vanilla and that was it. I also froze them so my family and I would not eat them all; it worked great. I wrapped them individualy and took one out when I wanted it and it still tasted awesome

I found this recipe to be more like a candy than a brownie.  This recipe would be wonderful for a child to make, and eat.  Sharon

Delicious! These were soft, gooey, moist, sweet, and so yummy. The butterscotch flavor wasn't too overwhelming and the marshmallows added that extra sticky sweet touch. I took a shortcut by microwaving the butterscotch chips and the butter in my mixing bowl rather than on the stove. I had a hard time combining them that way, but they ended up melting and combined with the dry ingredients just fine. I would definitely make these again!

I agree that this is not a traditional "brownie" recipe, bu tit is very similar so stop complaining about the name.  As far as the recipe, it is a simple recipe (in fact, my 4-yr-old daughter actually did most of it herself).  The results though are great, if you like really sweet gooey "brownies"...like I do.

These are very rich and delicious. Following the advice here, I used less sugar (50% less to be exact) and these came out perfect. They would have been way too sweet otherwise. I had to increase baking time by about five minutes, but every oven is different. My only concern was the partial melting of the chips when it comes time to add them to the lukewarm batter. It doesn't mess anything up, really, but it melds the flavors a little more than I would have liked. Will wait a little longer before adding chocolate next time. This is an excellent recipe.

The first batch I made came out uncooked in the middle, so I recommend baking for 30-35 minutes instead of 25.  Also, I added the eggs and vanilla into the butterscotch mixture first and whipped until creamy before adding the dry ingredients. It just seemed to work a little better that way.  All in all, delicious brownies.   Enough sweet to make anyone comatose from sugar shock.  They're great with vanilla ice cream on top.

this is the best desert i have ever made, and i have made alot of desserts because i am a dessert fiend! the only thing i did differently was i didnt have chocolate chips so i added about 1/4 cup cocoa powder. also, i used probably about 3 cups marshmallows instead of 2. so i am soooo excited to try them with the chocolate chips! believe me, you want to make this recipe!

These do not have big hunks of marshmallow in them.  The batter is really more like a cookie dough, & I thought they would turn out as cookie bars, but what really happened is the marshmallows melted into the cookies, creating a wonderful and unique chewy texture that had everyone asking how I did it.  My husband took a plate of them to work, and came home asking me to print off a dozen copies of the recipe for coworkers.  What a hit!

Maybe I did something wrong, but I found these "brownies" way too sweet.  And I agree with the previous reviewer: these are more like a candy than a brownie.  Okay if you like something super sugary, but I won't be making these again.

these brownies were pretty decent.  if i make them again, i might add more chocolate chips or add some nuts for more crunch and texture.  i also might decrease the marshmallow.  wasn't my favorite, but many of the other people i made them for enjoyed them.  thanks!

These are ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS.  We cleaned out the pan in one day.  I made a few substitutions due to necessity . . I used 1/4 c white choc chips and 3/4 butterscotch chips. And instead of 2 cups milk choc chips I used 1 c. milk choc and 1 c. semi sweet.  I made them once before and like them better with these substitutions.  But, it is a WONDERFUL recipe either way you make it!

OMG, these are great!  And so easy!  The batter was really stiff by the time I was ready to fold in the marshmallows and chocolate chips, but I managed.  Wonder if I could have added a bit of milk and/or cream to soften the batter before adding the final ingredients?  Never mind!  I love this recipe!  Thanks!

This is yummy! I changed things a bit since I do not eat chocolate. I added peanut butter chips instead of butterscotch chips and substituted vanilla baking chips for the chocolate chips. It was very good and my staff raved about it and all asked for the recipe! Thank you for such an easy recipe to modify for us 'non-chocolate' eaters!

These were really good.  I only changed one thing.  I lowered the amoun tof chocolate chips by 1/2 cup becaus eI knew 2 cups would be too much for my liking.  It was STILL too much.  Nexst time, I'll lower the chocolate to 1/2 cup, or just not use any at all.  I really feel that the chocolate chips hold the recipe back.  They cover the wonderful butterscoth flavor, which for me is the whole point of the recipe.  I mean, if I want a mouth full of chocolate, I could just make normal brownies.  Of course, I'm one of thos epeople who thinks chocolate is vastly over-rated.

Other than that, I loved them.  They were dense, rich, and sweet.  I may even add extra marshmallows next time.

These are awesome! Very chewy texture, sweet, delicious! I used peanut butter chips in place of the butterscotch, 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips instead of 2. I also baked them for 35 mins. instead of 25 mins. I used a metal baking pan.

I liked this recipe a lot, however, my husband thought the brownies were a little underdone. I thought they were fine--perfectly chewy and yummy, but I'll probably bake them a few minutes longer next time. I used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of milk chocolate and it turned out just fine. Also, I only used 1 1/2 cups of the chocolate chips and will use just 1 cup next time. Thanks Jill!

This is a great recipe.  I started to skip over it but read a few of the ratings and decided to make them.  I am so glad I did.  The marshmallows melt and the brownies get really gooey and rich.  I tried a piece when they were still warm and it was out of this world.

Rich and delicious!  I love rich sweets and this "brownie" is even rich for me.  It reminds me of a 7 layer bar but with less ingredients, faster preparation and cheaper.  YUM!  Thanks!

I made this for our big family Christmas Eve dinner. I went to the store, but butterscotch chips were all sold out already! Instead, I grabbed a bag of Reese's Peanut Butter Chips to substitute. It was a HUGE hit! Everybody loved it. If you are making this, with or without peanut butter chips, I recommend avoiding marshmallows towards the sides of the pan, as it sticks, but it shouldn't be a problem if you grease the pan.

Pretty good, but it sort of had a weird taste. I think it is too molassesey, and I used golden brown sugar. Perhaps half of the brown sugar should be substituted with white. I also cut the chocolate chips down to 1 cup but I'm thinking that 1 1/2 cups would be best. One small piece of advice,if you use a frozen stick of butter, be sure to melt it before you try and melt the butterscotch chips.

I really liked this recipe and they were gone in no time. But with my oven, they came out pretty underdone in the middle after the 25 minutes. I was hoping that they would firm up as they cooled, but they didn't. So I put them back in for another 15 minutes after they were cool and that did basically nothing. So I think they need to be cooked longer initially. I will definately try this again though. Hopefully I can get the timing down with my oven. I did substitute peanut butter chips for the chocolate chips since I am allergic to chocolate. They were very rich and very yummy!

I made these to take into work and they turned out really great. My biggest complaint was that they seemed a little greasy. As the recipe stated I didn't overcook them and took them out of the oven at exactly 25 minutes, even though they looked raw still. However, they firmed up and turned out really good.

These brownies are a little too sweet for me, but nevertheless, this is a great brownie recipe.  My kids loved them.  These also make a great snack when my kids friends come over...washed down with a glass of icy cold milk.  I'm keeping this recipe.

Great recipe, we modified it by using 1 cup milk chocolate & 1 cup semi-sweet chips.   And we also added pecans.  We will definitly make it again.

One reviewer said these are more like a combo cookie/candy and I couldn't agree more. VERY sweet, but oh, so delicious. I, too, preferred them more the next day, but had no complaints from anyone in my family the day I baked them. They come together very quickly. I microwaved the butter and butterscotch chips for one minute, stirred, then another 30 seconds and they were melted perfectly. Not sure how the most helpful positive review is for additions made to a brownie mix. Although I'm sure the chips and marshmallows added something to the brownies, starting with a brownie mix is definitely not going to yield a butterscotch brownie! So if you're looking for a butterscotch brownie recipe, skip the brownie mix. This is almost as easy, I assure you.

Family loves these. I didn’t have mini marshmallow so I used 16 large marshmallows and melted them in the melted cup of butterscotch chips/stick of butter  I had already melted slowly in the microwave. Be careful to heat added marshmallows in the microwave slowly & mix frequently until marshmallows are just melted. I then mixed  the melted ingredients into the flour/egg batter, spread in glass 9x13 & baked for 32 minutes  when center was set ( the center rises until it bakes through, then collapses and doesn’t jiggle). I ran a knife through-immediately after removing from oven. Did not taste until the following night. The only problem was that it was a little difficult to remove them from the glass pan I had prepared with Crisco. I would use parchment next time. Brownies were moist, chewy and flavorful, butterscotch was not overwhelming. I Would definitely make these again. I would also try and substitute a different flavored chip instead of butterscotch....mint or peanut butter.

sweet, maybe too sweet. I expected the marshmallows to disappear/ melt into the batter as it cooked, but they did not. It may have been due to the hot humid weather that glued them together in the package, but I did pull them apart as I added them into the batter...Son loved them, his request for his B-day cake, so may make again.

These are awesome! I totally forgot the sugar, I was sure I had ruined them but they didn't need any extra sugar at all! I baked these for an extra 5 min because they seemed too gooey. Bad idea as they were overcooked. Leave them in the pan until the next day . They improve in flavor and moistness. Next time I will take them out, even though they seem gooey and leave them in the pan until the next day. I lined the pan with foil, makes it easy to get them out.

I've been making (or at least eating) Disappearing Marshmallow Brownies for over 40 years and they're one of my favorites, but last night I added a cup of chopped pecans just because the open bag was in the cupboard and they were the best I ever had! Will definitely add chopped nuts from now on!

My 12 year old son made these.  I was a bit afraid of the butterscotch morsels because I don't like butterscotch.  HOWEVER I WAS WRONG.  THESE ARE THE BEST BROWNIES I HAVE EVER HAD.  The only thing I would change is I would put less butter.  I mean come on, do I have to go to the diet dungeon when I make these brownies, : ).

ABSOLUTELY A DO OVER.

Thought they were great, and agree that with the butterscotch and marshmallow elements, that less is more on the chocolate chips.

Thinking that I will try doing the same thing but with peanut butter chips next time.  We thought it was great.

I first made these a few months ago and I've had many requests for them since!  I only use about 1 cup of chocolate chips, but other than that I follow the recipe exactly.  They are EXCELLENT.
