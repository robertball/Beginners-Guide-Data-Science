Very good!  Tastes just like the ahi that was served at a 4 star restaurant that I used to work.  I served mine over rice.

Excellent. I could not find the wasabi fumi furikake (at Whole Foods), so I used a blend they offer of sea salt, garlic and sesame seeds as a substitute. Made for a milder taste, I suspect, but, for me, the best recipe is one you can vary according to what you have :-). I served it over greens, and it was delicious.  My husband *loved* it.

I have made this several times and it never disappoints. However, as is to me it's a little bland. I add about 1 tablespoon of black sesame seeds, 1 teaspoon of sesame oil and 1 teaspoon of soy sauce along with 1 tablespoon of lime juice. I saw the comment about the wasabi fumi furikake. I found it at a local Asian market and I live in a small town. It's a very good base to make something your own.

I got some beautiful sashimi grade tuna in my sizzlefish box. I marinated in spicy sesame oil, sesame oil, wasabi powder, touch of water and liquid aminos. Put on field greens with salt and pepper. OMG! Thanks for the recipe suggestion!
