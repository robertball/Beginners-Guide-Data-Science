Yum! These are nice and spicy. I made BIG cookies: about 20 instead of 48. I baked them for 13 minutes, and they turned out good. However, I think if I do this again, I'll turn the temp down to 375 and bake for 14-15 minutes. Emtmom, my husband thanks you!

These cookies are, indeed, soft and chewy. The raisins were nice and tender. The cookies were bland, though. I added salt and pecans, which made them much better. Next time, I would use brown sugar instead of white, and possibly even incorporate molasses somehow for a richer flavor.

Stuck to all 3 types of cookie sheets I own and were "cakey".  Definately not what I was expecting.

This recipe was bland and they were so soft they all ran together on the cookiesheet even after I waited more than the five minutes and added more flour. I was really dissappointed at how they turned out. Even my 3 year old said he wouldn't eat them and he eats anything sweet.

All I can say is WOW! I really enjoyed the taste of these cookies! I loved the cloves in there and how the raisins were so plump! I did switch out half the sugar for brown sugar and in the future I will also bring down the temp to 375. Thanks for such a tasty recipe!

My family and I were very disappoiinted with these cookies. They were soft, cake like, sticky and broke apart easily. Not enough oatmeal and raisins for the amount of cookies.

IGNORE ALL THE OTHER REVIEWS!!! these are the best cookies me and my family have ever tasted!!! I was hesitant making these because of the other reviews but I decided to go for it and it was way worth it! I didn't change the recipe at all and it was fabulous. the only thing i would recomend is to put the cookies in the oven for 5 min. to start then add on by 1 minute because they burn fast. Just when they become slightly brown on top they are just right. Also, I didn't grease the pan with spray, I took soft butter on a papertowl and rubbed it on the pan! 
BEST COOKIES EVER!!!!! THANKS SO MUCH FOR THE RECIPE!!!!!!!!!!!

Easy to make with good results @ 375"F for 8.5 min! Second batch, I simmered the raisins for about 2 minutes, then I added 1/4 Tsp sea salt, and 4 Tablespoons molasses. Added 1/2 cup chopped pecans to dry ingredients. Delicious!

Eh....
I would suggest brown sugar and a little bit of salt to the dough. I put frosting on mine to compensate for a little bit of "blah". Sorry! :(

A perfect, chewy oatmeal cookie.  I substituted raisins for the butterscotch chips since I didn't have any and it was great too.   I'll make this recipie again!.

I tweaked the recipe a little bit. I used half brown sugar half white. I also used dried blueberries instead of raisins and I added chopped almonds. The cookies were very soft and delicious.

These were GREAT! I lowered the amount of raisins in the recipe and there was a good amount after that. I absolutely loved these. My sister said they were the best she's ever had!

This cookie was so-so. I agree with another reviewer that it was very bland. We liked the almost cakey texture...but it didn't really taste like anything. The search for the perfect oatmeal raisin cookie continues!!

I read all the reviews and indeed, if I hadn’t added salt, more cinnamon, some nutmeg, more oatmeal, these would have been blah. They did turn out cake-like (not what I expected for a chewy cookie. I baked convection 375, 9 min. Used parchment paper, too. Not a recipe I’d repeat. Note that ingredients say melted butter, instructions say margarine. That could be making a difference as well in the texture.

after reading some of the reviews I decided to change the recipe a little bit. to start with, I used 2 cups of raisins instead of 3/4. (that obviously depends on how much you like raisins) and I added 1 tsp. of salt to the raisins and water. if you have salted raisins you most likely will not have to do that. you honestly don't need as much butter as it calls for, I only used 1 stick and they were fine. I added about 1 Tbsp. agave nectar ( or you could use honey) and I used half a cup more flour than it calls for just to thicken it up a little more. (I still had to let it sit for five minutes) I baked them on a cookie sheet greased with a little oil and on 375. I definitely recommend that so they don't burn! I only baked them about 6 minutes. tip: they are VERY sticky so I absolutely recommend greasing the pan with oil, Crisco, spray or something! also, be sure to make your cookies smaller when placing them on the pan because as they sit they will spread out. they will basically double in size just by running.

I found these cookies to be alright.  The batter was very sticky and tough to scoop out.  I used parchment paper and the bottom of my cookies burnt while the middle and top were still undercooked.  I had to take them out because I didn't want to burn them further.  I would have added more raisins and reduced the temp while raising the cooking time

YUM! These cookies turned out great. I just finished off my third one. :) I used half vegetable shortening and half melted butter. I also used about 1/4 cup mixed dried fruit and only 1/2 c. raisins because we didn't have enough raisins. The cookies are like little cakes. Really good.
