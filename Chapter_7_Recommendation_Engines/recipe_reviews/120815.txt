Corn is not something that I prepare too often, as I usually like to have something green.  BUT -- when I make corn, I've often cut it off the cob and seasoned it with lime and chili powder (a recipe I found in a magazine years ago).  This looked similar, so I thought I'd try it.  I didn't have any refrigerated butter spray (and I didn't think PAM would be too good), so I melted butter and added the seasonings, then brushed it onto each cob.  I used real garlic instead of powder and chopped my cilantro instead of mincing it.  This looked so good that I started on it first before anything else on my plate, and it tasted so good I finished it before trying anything else on my plate!  This is a great way to jazz up corn, and you can really taste all the flavors.  Bravo!

I simplified this quite a bit because I had to work with what I had on hand.  This recipe was a nice inspiration though to jazz up corn on the cob, and was a big hit with my friends.  I melted butter, added lime juice, ground red pepper, and garlic powder and brushed it over the corn, then baked it in foil.  Very simple and went well with our fajitas.  When I get the chance I will try this with the cilantro and cumin to see what those will add to the flavor.

I liked this but didn't use the called for 3 tablespoons of fresh cilantro. One was plenty.

Left out the cilantro because I didn't have any tonight and cooked some frozen mini cobs in the microwave. Merely rubbed the seasoning all over. This was absolutely terrific! My husband said this has got to be one of the top five side dish recipes I have ever made from Allrecipes! I agree. Delicious flavor.

I love corn on the cob cooked on the grill, but sometimes if I am in a hurry I don't have time to do a receipe from scratch, so have tried mixing a few shakes of taco seasoning into the melted butter.  Not as good as the recipe, but a quick fix ifyou are in a hurry.

A little spicy, a little tangy, and really easy to fix this dish. I used butter and melted it down then mixed the seasoning in and drizzled it over the corn ears. It was alright but not my favorite and I probably won't fix this one again. I did enjoy trying out your recipe, thanks!

made this for my family by melting butter, stirring in the the ingredients, and brushing onto the corn as a marinade before grilling. WOW. it was delicious, the whole family enjoyed it. I would suggest more chili pepper for a bigger kick but that is personal preference. Great recipe.

Obviously, I'm not going to use the butter-flavored spray abomination (try real butter instead), and I almost never have cilantro in my house, but this is amazingly good without it!!

Update: I just tried this with frozen whole kernel corn, and it was great, but it was too salty with only a 16-oz bag of corn, so use more corn and/or less salt.

I really enjoyed this recipe, it's a great way to spice up boring corn on the cob. Just enough flavor!

Excellent!  I had everything on hand for this tonight except a fresh lime and butter spray. I substituted some lime juice.  I just eyeballed and taste tested it, so I don't really know how much I used.  As for the butter, I just melted a couple of tablespoons of butter to use instead.  Everyone loved this.  I can't wait to have it again.

Very, very tasty!  Didn't have any cilantro so I omitted that from my mix. I cut a lime into wedges and rubbed it over the cooked ears of corn, then sprinkled the mix overtop.   So it wasn't overpowering in any spots, I rubbed the lime wedge over the corn again to even out where the spice mix fell.   It was perfect. I'll likely not ever use butter on corn again!

Fantastic!  I will definitely grow more cilantro next year in anticipation, and will be buying lots from the market in the meantime.

I cut the recipe in half (only used 4 min cobs though) & I didn't have any butter spray so I added the spices to 1/4 c. of softened butter ( I had butter left over but it will keep in the fridge). I like to cut the kernels of the cob ( i cannot stand for it to get between my teeth!) & then I  add a spoonful of the seasoned butter to the corn. This was really good...every bit as tasty as parmesan butter (which I love!) on corn. Thanks  Helen!

husband said it was the best corn on the cob he has ever had in his life!
my variation: i just needed to make 1 corn on the cob, and i used 1/2 tsp of all of the ingredients.  the only substitution i had to make was using melted butter instead of butter-flavored spray. i tried using a brush to coat the corn, but the mix would not stick to it so i just used my hands.
thanks for a great recipe!!!
