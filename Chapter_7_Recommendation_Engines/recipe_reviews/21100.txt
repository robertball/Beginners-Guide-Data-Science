The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly.  It was good but a little bland.  The next time I made it, I changed things up a little.  Instead of crackers, I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs mixed with shredded 6-cheese (Italian blend) and garlic powder.  YUM!  What a difference.  This is the perfect thing to take to a potluck - it's different without being bizarre.  Very, very good.

Very good. I used italian breadcrumbs in place of saltines. It was good but next time I will add cheese also.

Made this last evening as someone had given me a head of cabbage.  If I make it again I will add shredded cheese.

I've been looking for another way to get cabbage into our dinners, and this recipe was just great.  It was easy and that's always a plus for me. I used Ritz crackers in place of the saltines, since that's all I had. It's flavor was both sweet and savory.  And the added bonus was the family liked it!  Thanks!

It wasnt horrible but i would never serve this to guests. You definitely do not want to pour in the eggs like directed. It turned into scrambled eggs no matter how much you stired. It was so unappealing to the eye. I didnt like the idea of mixing in saltine cracker so i just sprinkled the top with seasoned breadcrumbs. Sorry but i will not make this again. I will look for other ways to cook/eat cabbage.

Great side dish! As others stated, I changed it a little.  I used yellow snack crackers and since I didn't have milk, I use half and half.  I also put a handful of cheeder cheese in the mixture and then topped it off with the crackers, cheese and bacon pieces.

This was good, although I would likely make a couple of changes next time.  I would lightly salt the cabbage prior to adding the milk/cheese mixture and would also add more cheese (aged cheddar for stronger flavor).

This recipe needs no help-it is delicious the way it is!  Cabbage, onions, butter, salt and pepper (not to mention the yummy eggs, milk, and cracker crumbs!)-what's bland about that?  Cabbage alone has a strong taste!  This recipe is yummy and as most recipes suggest, add salt and pepper to taste! Don't be afraid to try this recipe as submitted without all the suggested tweeks.  Besides, the original recipe is a very budget-friendly dish-all the tweeks just make it more expensive AND more fattening!

Surprisingly good.  I was concerned with one raters comments on the eggs scrambling, so I tempered with a couple spoonfuls of the hot milk mixture.  Worked well.  Would kick it up next time by adding a sprinkling of parm cheese on top.  I subbed marg & olive oil for the butter and it still tasted great.

After reading reviews, I made the following changes:  I used Italian bread crumbs instead of crackers, used 1 tsp garlic salt instead of regular salt, used about 1 tbsp onion flakes instead of real onion and added 1/4 cup of parmesean cheese.  It wasn't bland at all and made for a very tasty dish.

I made this recipe as written with a couple of minor changes due to our diet, I used crushed cornflakes instead of bread crumbs as our family is gluten free, and used olive oil instead of butter, almond milk instead of regular milk due to we limit our dairy as well. I am a cabbage enthusiast so I loved it (I usually just eat it steamed with olive oil/salt/pepper), My husband whom doesn't care for it as much even enjoyed this recipe as did the kids who normally complain. I see that some have added cheese and whatnot but I feel if you truly love cabbage, these additions would just cover up the flavor of it. So if you are a cabbage lover, make it as is!!! Thank you for the great recipe GrammyRose! I will make this again, and again :)

This was FANTASTIC!!! My four young kids who usually HATE cabbage all love this recipe! 

The only changes I made to the recipe were to add all the cracker crumbs to the mixture and then a few minutes before it is done baking, I add a can of french fried onions to add some extra crunch on top. 

Great recipe that has become a staple in our household!

I made this low calorie (123 per serving) by only using 1 Tbsp butter, fat free milk, fat free crackers, and 3 egg whites plus 1 egg. I also added crushed red pepper, garlic powder, and Tony Chachere's seasoning. It was really good. My children even liked it. Thanks for sharing.

I needed to get rid of some leftover cabbage and use stuff I already had in the cupboard. This was perfect because the ingredients are common and the preparation simple. What's more, it lives up to it's 4-star rating: absolutely delicious!

YUM! I added kale, chopped uncured bacon, asiago cheese and used panko instead of the saltines and it was delicious. I've never really eaten cabbage aside from sauerkraut, but I will definitely make this again! Thanks, grammyrose, for sharing!

I've made this about 4 times now. Once just as written and the other times with a few variations. As written we found it to be a little bland. I now add chopped bacon, potatoes (to feed a bigger crowd), and I add a few cloves of garlic with the onions. Today I'm adding cheese to see how that goes. My changes definitely don't help in the calorie department, but sometimes - I just want to splurge!

Awesome! Thought it needed just a few more additions and followed reviewers suggestion of Italian seasoning and low fat cheese. Drizzled with EVOO instead of dotting with butter. Keeper!

Love it!  We make this for church potlucks - cheap, easy, and filling! I add about 1 1/2 c. cheddar/parmesan blend (or whatever) before putting it in the oven. Always a hit!

With summer here and so much cabbage it is always nice to have some other options in recipes.  This one is definitly a keeper.  We did use italian bread crumbs as suggested and also added French' fried onions...yum!!!

A little plain.  If I make this again, I would add some ham or salted meat to enhance the flavor.

Great way to use cabbage. Quick and easy....but....Definitely use Italian seasoned bread crumbs instead of the saltines. I also added garlic with the onion, more salt and pepper and 3/4 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese. Next time I make this I wouldn't even bother putting it into a casserole dish and baking. It tasted better with less bread crumbs and straight from the pan to the plate.

It's great, I hate cabbage but decided to cook it for my finace and thought I'd give it a try, and I actually liked it. I did add a little cheese, and probably would add some bacon next time. Thanks for the recipe!!

I really enjoyed this. I was afraid of it being bland, but I didn't have that problem at all.  I attempted to temper the eggs a bit, before mixing them in and also didn't have the scrambled egg problem.  My only change next time is to try and make it a bit healthier--nonfat milk, less butter, and maybe using breadcrumbs instead of crackers.

This cabbage had very little flavor and was too "eggy" almost like a souffle, which was not what I was looking for. I will stick with the wonderful "creamed Cooked Cabbage" recipe from this site.

This is a great recipe that compliments a glazed corn beef dinner very well.  I make it every year for St. Patrick's Day!  It is easy to prepare and has a good taste that does not overpower the rest of the meal.

This was delicous!! I love cabbage and I made this to go along with slow roasted pork tenderloin, we had a crowd to dinner and everyone raved about this dish! I used less onion though, and used Herbamere to season the cabbage and onion before adding the milk. I also added cayenne and more black pepper than called for. I used whole wheat soda crackers for the cracker crumbs and seasoned them with herbamere and black pepper to make extra crust on top. I shredded Montery Jack cheese and spread it over the cabbage under the cracker crumbs, delious, really delicous!!

Everyone at my table ate some of this dish (even the non-cabbage eaters). Some thought it was ok and some thought it made cabbage tasty. I will try it again using a smaller cabbage so that there is more cheese sauce. I liked it---but then I like cabbage! :0)

This was good and I added no cheese. I had a very small cabbage so the onion ratio was probably higher but I cut the milk to 1 cup and the eggs to 3 to compensate. I cooked the onions separately and carmelized them. I think the cracker crumbs may be making it bland for some because I didn’t use them and it was flavorful. Also added a little garlic powder and lemon pepper seasoning. If you’re going to add a crumb topping I’d try a half and half bread crumb and Parmesan cheese. I also don’t think Italian seasoning would compliment the cabbage.

Haven't tasted it yet, but from reading other posts it was bland, so I added an apple and frozen cranberries and a spice mix. I made bread crumbs instead of cracker crumbs and cheese. It won't let me post without rating, so I'll guess a 4.

I made this for the first time today, to go with meatloaf.  I used ritz crackers, and added a large can of corn, just because I like corn with meatloaf.  It's very good. Next time I will probably add more crumbs on top, but i will definately make again. Thanks for the recipe.

A tasty, easy, and inexpensive side dish. I added a little nutmeg and used Ritz crackers instead of saltines. Several reviewers mentioned that they added cheese, but I think that would make this way too rich.

I'm a veggie lover, and so I found this a great cabbage dish! My husband, who loves meat and various cheeses, wasn't too impressed. So, my recommendation to someone wanting to add more flavor is to try adding bacon, cheddar and parmesan cheese, and some spices like parsley, sage, and garlic powder. Also, I toasted ezekiel bread crumbs in the oven in place of the saltines for extra flavor.

This is a favorite of my family.  I've made this for 25 yrs or more. It's also a traditional dish served at our Christmas table.  Sometimes I add cheddar cheese, other times not.  It's an economical, savory dish that goes great with any meat. Try the recipe the way it's written, you'll love it!!

What a great side dish.  Thanks!  I took other reviewers advice, and added cheese on top.  Also, used breadcrumbs instead of Saltine Crackers.  I added some crispy fried bacon bits to create an interesting texture, and my husband asked me to make it again!  That is a success!!

Mine turned out a little dry but I could have used a cabbage that was too big.  Overall the flavor was good.  I also added cheese to the top.  Next time I might mix cheese into the caserole itself.  Will make again but will adjust to make it more moist.  It's worth another try.

I was a bit unsure about making this - the ingredients seemed such a weird combination. It was actually pretty good, perhaps a little bit on the dry side. I added lots of black pepper, and topped it with a cup of crushed saltines and panko breadcrumbs. Good recipe, Sharon!
