So easy, delicious & nutritious...we loved it!  I eyeballed the onion and sun-dried tomatoes, but they were wonderful in this.  I had to cook it about 15 minutes longer than recommended, but no big deal.  I was scared when I took this out of the oven because it rose unevenly; however, it leveled out quickly while cooling.  Great item to take to a brunch...loved it!!!

Really delicious.  This has no meat and very little cheese so I didn't have a lot of hope for the flavor. The sun dried tomatoes are what gives this the taste... so don't leave them out. Adding meat with this would work great, but I think I would leave the cheese level as it is
