Awesome.  I added cheddar cheese 1/4 cup and instead of peas and carrots i sauteed mushrooms, red green and yellow peppers, steamed cauliflower.  Was amazing

Great comfort food... I don't understand why more cooks don't use ham soup base (versus a chicken stock)... like "Better Than Bouillon" (although there are others). If you are making something with ham... why not?

Made in electric skillet and turned out really well.  Glad the recipe suggested "low sodium" chicken broth else I think it would've been too salty.  Had never heard of "fat free half & half" - didn't think that was possible with 1/2 cream but found it at Target (my regular grocery did not have).  My happy meal for the week.  Filling without feeling heavy.  Should work equally well with turkey.

I used up ham, pasta and peas! The peas came from frozen but were already cooked in package in microwave for earlier meal. I had just enough left to use them in this. Taste is great!

Delicious.  I'm not a big pasta aficionado, but I went back 2 times for more.  I substituted dried onion for the cooked onion because my son doesn't like the texture of cooked onion.  I also used fresh Parmesan cheese instead of the stuff in the green can.  It makes a difference.

I made this last Saturday and all devoured with in minutes as all four people returned for seconds so I had to make another the next day and share the recipe. The second one I added frozen broccoli florets and it still was gobbled up.

I made the recipe as-is and 4 out of the 5 people in my family liked it! It was a great way to use up leftover ham. Next time I'll go lighter on the spices as the kick was too much for one of my kids.

This was super good. Even my fourteen-year-old son who can be very picky said it was amazing! My only change was in using chicken bouillon mixed with water. That's all I had and it was not low sodium, so I made sure that I rinsed my pre-packaged chopped ham very well. It was not too salty. Will definitely be going into my rotation!

Very good, quick and easy. I used the mini farfalle pasta. Next time I will use only 1/2 the box (8 oz). The full box was way too much and made it dry. Had to add extra broth.

This was a quick and easy meal of Thanksgiving.  A great way to use the ham.  I used half and half because that is what I had and it made the dish very creamy.  I also added corn because I was out of carrots.  I will definitely make this again!

This came out great! I had to add a little extra chicken broth but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. I live alone so I will definitely have a bunch of left overs!

I made exactly as instructed and I was underwhelmed. It was easy and came together quickly, but why add red pepper flakes and black pepper? Too spicy for me. i suspect without the peppers it would be lacking flavor. I understand spicy-ness is subjective,  but it seemed totally out of place in this recipe.

This is a keeper. MY hubby doesnâ€™t care for onions, so I used onion powder, but made no other substitutions. Flavorful, filling and yummy.

1 change, had no carrots. I know, hard to believe. Used frozen corn. Sauteed onion an extra couple of minutes. Otherwise did nothing different.  This will be added to my " blackbook of recipes".

Would probably add more broth to the mix to make the sauce base lighter and juicier.  Mushrooms are a good add-in as well. Delish!

I used egg noodles because that is what I had. I halved the recipe to accommodate the number of people in my home.  The only thing I would change is to NOT add additional salt.  This was very enjoyable and made all in one pot.
