I have tried MANY other recipes and this is by far the best!!! High tea wouldn't be as enjoyable without them. Great spread with clotted cream or  Philadelphia Brand Cheesecake flavored cream cheese and your favorite fruit spread! Thank you for this delicious recipe,everyone who tries it loves it!!!!

Okay - but not very authentic.  I live in Yorkshire, England and we don't use instant vanilla pudding mix in any of our cakes.  The traditional cream tea consists of a cup of English breakfast tea with a scone split sideways across the middle with each half topped with strawberry jam (jelly) and then with either whipped heavy cream or Cornish clotted cream.  The recipe which nearest matches the best scones is J.P.'s Big Daddy Biscuits on this website.

I last reviewed this recipe in 2003 under JEBV. This is still by far the most popular treat with tea. I've since tried using coconut pudding and rum extract for a tropical flavor that is out of this world! This is a great recipe still. If anyone has trouble making these just try a little patience and tweek the recipe to your own taste.

The Cream Tea Cakes recipe (Lake District recipe for "Upland Biscuits") is absolutely divine! They are absolutely the most delicious and the most scrumptious tea biscuits that I have ever tasted! Thank you for sharing the recipe online with me and everybody else!!

My daughter and I made this recipe for a school project about her cultural heritage.  The cookies were delicious, but the batter is very, very soft.  I would suggest a little chilling before attempting to roll them out.

I agree with everyone that additional flour needs to be added. (1/4 c)  I added mine while kneading.  They remind me of a sugar cookie,but not as sweet.  I really like them and served them at an afternoon tea with clotted cream.  Eveyone loved them. Definitely not a tradtional cream tea cake though.

This was and is a wonderful recipe, I did try to roll out but found out that the dough is fragile, so for the sake of time I just spread them out on a cookie sheet and made bar cookies and it was big hit. I have had several request to make more.

Perhaps I should wait until tomorrow's wedding shower to rate these, however, it's been a long night!  Keep this in mind, I am a novice.  I have been trying recipes on this site for quite some time now but this is my first dessert of sorts.  The instructions make this recipe sound so easy and none of the reviews made it seem difficult but I think I've bitten off more than I can chew with this recipe!  It was so sticky and soft!!! I couldn't roll it out without adding a lot, I mean a lot of flour.  So when I baked them, because I had so much flour on the biscuits, they tasted on dry flour...I spread butter on them while they were still hot and now they seem fne.  I've finished the batch, my husband liked them but for the effort, I don't think it was worth 5 stars.  I'll try this recipe again if it goes over well at the wedding shower I'm hosting.

I just made these and they are sooo yummy! One suggestion I would make is adding more flour (about 1/4 cup more) as the dough was too soft and sticky. Also, I would reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup next time as the cakes are a bit too sweet for me. But otherwise they are scrumptious!

The first time I made these I experience the same as others: dough too delicate and frustrating to make. The second time, I cut the flour back to 1 cup and added 1/2 cup baking mix (bisquik or other). The entire dough was mixed using an electric mixer. Made a HUGE difference (though for the last 1/2 cup I had to use a dough hook so it wasn't as messy. Add plenty of flour to the board before you roll it (though I found a flexible plastic cutting board works better for this). It kneads just fine from t here. Rolled it, cut it, baked it. Turned out so yummy.

These cookies are very gooey, very subtle.  I used butterscotch pudding instead of vanilla for excitement, and came out amazing. The cookies needed more time though, felt like 22 min rather than 10 min.

Deliciously tender cookie, it is definitely a cross between a biscuit and a shortbread cookie,  otherwise known as a tea cake. I had no problems with the recipe however I did add a drop of almond extract, and a teaspoon of vanilla bean paste as I’m fond of the flavor. I also iced it with a strawberry glaze (powdered sugar, stewed strawberry jam, water and a touch of corn syrup to add smoothness) . Also I made it in my stand Mixer with a scraper beater.  Sugar and butter first then added in the custard powder, pinch of salt, egg, and almond/ vanilla. Topped in with the flour (+1/4 cup).  I dropped it onto waxed paper and pressed it into a square shape without directly touching, using just the wax to mold it into the shape. Refrigerated for about 30 mins, then rolled it out to about a 1/2” depth. Cut out 9 2” rounds, re-molded and froze the dough for 10 mins then cut out remaining 7.   Baked for exactly 10mins at 350.  They were perfect! I will definitely make these again.  Love that they are not so sweet, allows you to compliment a glaze or a nice topping more.  I’ll have to find some clotted cream or make my own because these will be great with a dollop of that and jam.
