I served this recently at a luncheon for my friends and their children.  It was very well received by everyone.  It presented very beautifully as well.

This salad is perfect on a hot summer night. The dressing did leave a little something to be desired though.

I only used about 1/3 cup olive oil as I thought 3/4 was way too much and I don't like olive oil as a dressing base anyway. Make sure you toss the avocados in some lemon juice so they don't discolor and a little salt and pepper for flavor. All the ingredients compliment each other very well.
