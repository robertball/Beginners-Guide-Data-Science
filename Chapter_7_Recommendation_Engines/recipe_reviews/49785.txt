I've been making spam musubi like this for years, except that I omit the oyster sauce, add a little ginger, bake the marinated spam at 350 deg F for 8-10 minutes, and sprinkle toasted black and white sesame seeds onto the molded rice. Here's a tip: use the spam can as a mold by CAREFULLY cutting the bottom out of it with an x-acto knife. Also, it helps if you use "pre-toasted" nori sheets. Untoasted nori can be tough. Another tip to keep the rice from sticking to your hands; have a bowl of water handy to wet your hands and the musubi mold.

growing up in hawaii, i ate spam musubi all the time.  i've always made it with a sugar and soy sauce marinade but when i saw this recipe with oyster sauce, i thought i'd give it a try.  i made two kinds to see if i could taste the difference and the one with the oyster sauce is the way to go.  it really adds that extra something that makes a great spam musubi.  i was shocked because i didn't think it would make that much of a difference, but it did.  note that using non toasted nori can be really chewy and therefore can be difficult to eat.  i use korean seaweed instead, which is usually toasted and seasoned with sesame oil and salt.  you can get it at a korean market.

Being an "Island Boy," I like to find recipes for 'local' food. It reminds me of home and is usually considered comfort food to me. I've been making musubi for years but have never made it with the marinade. Very good! Like others suggested, cook on low heat. That sugar will start to caramelize real quick and burn if your heat is too high. I put some furikake mix in with the rice just for some extra flavor. You can get furikake mix from many asian food stores. I usually get the basic 'nori komi' mix (great over steamed rice too). I make big batches and individually saran-wrap them. Perfect on the go snack. Regular steamed rice works fine. No need to soak for four hours. Just wash it and cook it like you would normally.

After going to Hawaii for the first time a few years ago, my fiance and I fell in love with spam musubi. I'm so glad that I found this recipe. BUT, I really don't like oyster sauce (I did a test batch of 2 spam slices marinated as directed in this recipe, and didn't like the way it came out) and after doing a bit more research for other musubi recipes online, I decided to substitute the oyster sauce with mirin (Japanese sweet cooking wine that you can find at any Asian grocery store/market). YUMMY YUM YUM!!! It was perfect, just like in Hawaii! My fiance couldn't get enough! (And neither could I!) TIPS: You don't have to use sushi rice, regular rice is just fine. When you cook the marinated spam slices, be sure to do it at a low heat, as the sugar in the marinade really does make the spam burn very easily. When I assembled my musubi, I kept a small bowl of water next to me to continually wet my fingers and the musubi maker (as well as using it to seal the seaweed strips). Speaking of the seaweed, before you cut it into strips, be sure to "toast" it - simply take each sheet and quickly make three-four passes over your stove burner and it will toast fine (don't let it linger over the burner or have the burner set too high or it will burn). I'll definitely keep this recipe as one of my favorites.

This is a great recipe. But it doesn't have to be that hard.  My family just uses calrose rice (fresh or day old), Spam, and nori. The only thing we do to the spam is fry it in brown sugar and shoyu. But, I'm sure this makes really great spam musubis.

I'm from Hawaii and I love making/eating spam musubi.  Recipe looks good, I would suggest buying a musubi maker from any Japanese market, it will make the end product a lot easier to make.  To add more flavor to the rice, I add 1 cup of rice vinegar with 1 cup sugar mixed into the hot rice just after it's finished cooking (for 3 cups of uncooked rice).  I would try to get 10-14 slices from 1 can of spam for best spam to rice ratio.

On our 7th trip to the Hawaiian Islands, we finally tried Spam Musubi!  It is "ono"!  I have to say I only used this recipe as a guideline.  I made a few changes.  I marinaded the spam in teriyaki,  and cut nori into 1 1/2 inch strips.  I also bought a musubi mold, which I got in Maui, but you can buy them online. Dip mold in water before molding each musubi, it will make removal much easier.  Also lay a piece of plastic wrap on flat surface, lay nori on top, center mold and fill with rice then spam and then rice again, press.  Remove mold, wrap seaweed around rice and wrap in plastic.  I gave my sister two musubi's to take home...one for her and for her husband...she ate both!  Mahalo!

Hubby and I had SPAM musubi everyday when we were in Hawaii. I couldn't figure out what's the "secret sauce" that made it so good. When I tried out this recipe, I was surprised that the "secret sauce" is a combination of something so commonly found in a Chinese kitchen. A few suggestions - 1. use low sodium SPAM and soy sauce. You can enjoy it even more without drinking tones of water afterward. 2. cook SPAM in low heat and watch carefully. With the sauces and sugar, it burns really fast. 3. If you aren't use to wrap sushi and molding cooked rice, scoop the rice into a piece of plastic wrap and press to form the rice. This will give you a nice a firm rice cake without the mess. 4. Adding a little bit of sesome seeds to the rice if you like. Love this recipe. Definitely a keeper!

I lived in Hawaii for many years and your recipe is spot on except for one thing.   I have no idea why you'd soak your rice at all, much less for 4 hours.   I put the rice into the rice cooker... add water and push the button.  Perfect rice in less than 30 minutes.    A fun way to shape the rice so it fits the spam slices just right,  is to pat the rice out on a sheet of parchment paper to the thickness you want.   Then use the spam can like a cookie cutter to cut the rice.   (Works best if you cut off both the top and bottom of the can)

The marinade was delicious. I didn't know it was the oyster sauce that was missing when I tried making this at home before. It's my favorite breakfast food. I used low sodium soy sauce and low sodium Spam and went easy on the sugar.  Turn on a fan and let it blow the vinegar off the rice for a lovely shine while you cook the meat.  Don't crank up the heat too much under the meat or the marinade will burn. If shaping by hand, wet your hands in water and squish the rice into shape.  I am used to rice sandwiching both sides of the meat. I also like the furikake or goma seasoning (black and white sesame seeds toasted with salt) sprinkled all over it for crunch. 

This is sacrilege, but I have used a thin sheet of egg omelette instead of nori for my seaweed fearing husband.

I grew up eating Spam and Spam Musubi. I always make Spam Musubi using a "basic sauce", Spam and nori. I cook rice first then set it aside to cool a bit while I assemble other ingredients. I bring Aloha soy sauce and brown sugar to a medium boil in a saucepan until sugar dissolves. I just eyeball the amount of soy sauce and brown sugar, to taste, never measuring. I omitted the oyster sauce (never used it). I don't fry the spam in vegetable oil. I just cut up the spam in thick slices and add it to the saucepan. I also roast the nori right before putting everything together. Using a musubi maker I place the nori inside, add rice and press it into the mold, add a slice of cooked spam, another layer of rice on top and press the top musubi maker onto everything together tightly. I then remove the mold and use a sharp knife to cut the musubi in half. Sometimes I make this for breakfast or lunch. While I do have "my own" way of making Spam Musubi sauce (without oyster sauce), others may find adding a little more seasoning to theirs, such as this recipe, more suitable. Thou Spam Musubi is easy to make, it is a filling and tasty snack. Some people add nori furikake and other ingredients to the Spam Musubi to jazz it up. You will find Spam Musubi anywhere here in Hawaii, even at the 7-Eleven stores. This can be served as an appetizer, part of an okazuya and a snack on-the-go! Very popular and Onolicious!!

it was good because it tasted like spam. Marinating spam in the mixture of soy sauce and oyster sauce just makes spam saltier.

These have become a regular feature in our family, but I personally don't find that the sauce is entirely necessary.  Everyone in my family likes them with something different anyway; my kids like to eat them with sweet & sour sauce, but I prefer them with soy & wasabi, & my husband just eats them plain (he'd eat them raw if I'd let him ;) My husband was stationed in HI for a long time, Spam musubi was his favorite snack - he was pretty floored when he came home to find that I had learned to make them for him.  He says these are great, but that his favorite in HI were from the gas stations & movie theaters, where the "Spam juices" soak into the rice after they'd sit under a heat lamp for a while.

The teriyaki sauce is just perfect! I will definitely reuse this for other meats. I simply followed the instructions for cooking Japanese rice from the instructions on the bag. I think it is much faster than soaking the rice.

This recipe was great! I was going to go with a teriyaki glaze for flavor but found this recipe for the spam sauce and from the rave reviews with the oyster sauce, I had to try this instead. It was delish! I had my Husband cut the bottom off the spam can to use for the mold, pressed the seasoned sushi rice (another recipe) in it, shook on some furikake then popped it out of the mold, added the cooked spam and nori. Good Hawaiian memories there.

I think the addition of the oyster sauce is pretty good...I always use aloha shoyu...you definitely do not have to soak your rice for 4 hours...the secret to getting a good sauce is to fry the spam and while it's hot dip it into the shoyu mixture onto steamed rice ...making sure to generously dip so that the sauce soaks a little into the rice while its wrapped and wrap quickly....the steam when the musubi is wrapped with saran wrap will soften the wrap to the correct consistency. You can purchase the correct sized wrap at the Asian store it comes in packs of 100 to make it easier...the above picture barely has anything...you can use other things but the spam, sauce, rice combo if done correctly should be all you will need...because there are alot of flavors already

So good! I loved the carmelizing on the Spam. I wrapped each musubi in its own piece of foil, and it made snacks for days! Great tips by other cooks--Use Spam can as a mold (wet it between making each one), and cook Spam on Low! Thanks for this recipe! xoxo =]

LOVE IT!  It doesn't have quite the same taste as the spam musubis in Hawaii, but it still tastes great.  Like the reviews below said, use low-sodium spam or even low-sodium shoyu to cut down on the salt content.  I poured all the marinade in with the spam to cook so there'd be some extra sauce in with the musubi.  Just be careful not to burn it because of the sugar.

a local favorite here in Hawaii.  Only thing is I don't use oyster sauce and it's not necessary to soak rice for 4 hours.  I love adding furukaki on the rice too.  If you don't like spam, try substituting bbq chicken or even salmon.  When putting salmon, I would suggest putting it in the middle of the rice instead of laying on top of it.

I thought these were delicious. They were a little bit of work to put together though! I didn't have a rice press, but I heard that by cutting the other end off the spam can, you can use THIS as a rice press. So I did. Stuffed the rice in the bottom, pressed with a spoon, then laid the spam piece on top of it and packed it on some more. After that, wrapped with my sushi nori and these little goodies were ready to go! The sauce was delicious on it, very sweet and gave the spam extra flavor. I'll make this again!

Nice little kick with the oyster sauce.   You can also try experimenting with other meats. i.e. Teriyaki grilled chicken, kalua pork, Teri/miso salmon, boneless Korean bbq beef.  Ono!

Make sure you really pan-sear the spam. Almost to a burnt crisp. Reduce liquid ingredients by half. Original portions makes too much marinade.

Unlike most reviewers here, I did NOT grow up eating this. (I grew up in Detroit, and never even had spam until this recipe.) When I first opened the can of spam, I have to admit, I was doubtful I could get over the ick-factor of it all. But I kept an open mind, followed all the directions (except I used brown rice instead of white, and I marinated overnight instead of for 5 minutes), and WOW! was I surprised.

This is honestly the most tasty thing I can imagine spam turning into. I would definitely make this again.

This would be especially good if you have young kids who like to help in the kitchen. They can help with the assembly. They'll have fun hand-molding the rice "loaves" and wrapping the nori ribbons around the little bundles.

I sliced the spam into 15 slices, and that was perfect for the amount of rice.

I made these & took them to a get together with friends.  Immediately our host perked up and was like "Is this Musubi?!?!?!" and started chowing down on them.  Afterwards he asked me if I had steamed it, and then let me know that many Hawaiian natives steam them to tighten the seaweed.  Will do next time, but he sat there all night telling stories about when he lived in Hawaii.  Must have been close & it tasted pretty awesome too.

One of my roommates @ college was from HI & when I was in the dorm's, I was the only one on the floor of twently girls NOT from HI -- they showed me how to roll sushi & we would make this for us all when we went tailgating or just when hangin around! Awesome tasting & if you haven't tried it before - DO ! ! It is a FAB snack, appetizer, meal!

I make this ALL the time.  I usually change it to 40 servings because everyone loves it and it goes fast!  I marinate the spam for several hours rather than just 5 minutes. When I increase the servings, I decrease the rice vinegar some, otherwise it's too strong.  The sugar can also be easily decreased if you like (oyster sauce is already sweet).  I also add Furikake rice reasoning to the rice.  I wrap each spam musubi in plastic wrap (after it's cooled).  If you put it in the fridge, the rice can get hard.  I leave it out for a max of 2 days & its still good, but it's usually gone long before that.

Deeee... LISH!
Adding the oyster sauce made a huge difference because it thickens the marinade and makes the sauce stick when frying. I did tweak the recipe a tad. I used less oyster sauce - probably 1/8 of a cup and used lower salt soy sauce. Didn't soak the rice, just made it normally with the rice cooker. I added half the amount of rice vinegar but really you don't need to. My musubi maker was very helpful - get one at your local asian goods store.

WAY too much marinade, you only use 1/5 of it and have to throw the rest away.

Rice & water ratio depends on the rice you bought--follow the package instructions rather than blindly following the 1 to 1 ratio here.

It was very good. Better than the Hawaiian fast food up the street.  I cut the vinegar in half because I was afraid of what the hubby would think.  I was still able to taste it fine.  I put ckicken instead of spam to try something different.  I already know what spam musubi is like.  Thanks, we all loved the formula.

Great recipie, very similar to the one I learned back when I lived in Mililani.

A great addition is to add 3 Tbsp of toasted sesame seeds to the rice before forming it for a nice flavor (thats the way Auntie Kaliha always made it).

Also, if you have a rice cooker (you can buy a 6 cup one at Wal*Mart for cheap), you can skip the soak for 4 hours step and have tasty musubi in about 35 minutes total!

I was sceptical to try this, but my stepson is a Spamaholic...saw it on the Food Networks "Best thing I ever ate" and thought I'd give it a try!  I was pleasantly surprised!  I did use "sticky" sushi rice, and cut the bottom of the spam can off to use for a mold!

It was alright, but a bit too sweet for my taste.  I usually use splenda and a bit of mirin instead to cut down on sugar.  On a side note, MUSUBI is not SUSHI.  Sushi actually means "vinegared rice". Musubi is also called Onigiri in Japan depending on the region.

Pretty good! My husband is from Hawaii and so my family loves spam musubi. I am a haoli, so I had to learn how to make it. :-) This one was pretty good. I was all out of oyster sauce, so I used shoyu & sugar, but I am sure the oyster sauce would have added some great flavor. We didn't like the amount of rice vinegar... I'll have to play with that one. All in all, it was good & we enjoyed it! Thanks!

Loved the recipe, but also took into consideration the recommedations made by others. I used my spam can for the mold but I didn't need to cut it because it slides out if you give it a little tap. Also added rice seasoning and it was delicious!! Everyone I make this for loves it!!

YUM!!  I havent had these in over 7 years since my last visit to Hawaii when I ate them every day.  I'm so excited I can make them myself now and they are so good!!!  I followed the recipe very closely with the exception of one minor addition.  I added equal parts of sugar and rice vinegar to my rice.  My family is already requesting the next batch.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is very good and authentic.  I cut down the ratio of soy sauce, oyster sauce, and sugar because you only use a tiny portion of that, and the rest goes to waste.

A Samoan friend made some for a get-together but didn't leave the recipe. My son and his friends asked me to make some for them and so I found this recipe. It is just as good if not better than the musubi she made!

I love this recipe, as did my husband, 6 year old and my bookgroup (save for the people who do not like spam).  I've used it as an appetiser and as a main meal (with seaweed salad as a side, mmmm!), and it was great for lunch the next day.  The only changes I made were to use the rice preparation recipe on the sushi rice I got rather than the one that comes with the Spam Musubi recipe.  Also note, my end result did not look nearly as pretty as the picture due to my troubles with the sticky rice, but I bet it tasted just as good!

Good recipe.  I skip the step with the rice vinegar, just plain rice is fine.  Frying your spam, then marinating and then frying again gets rid of a lot of the fat as well.  Low sodium spam works best.  I've also had some people prefer is as a sandwich - rice, seaweed, spam, rice.

After living in Hawaii for several years, I can say this is the first recipe I've found that truly captures the taste of "Ohana".  Great job!  I used to buy these every day at the local market on Kalihi St. on the way to work... mmmm. Makes for a great fast breakfast munchy while on the run.  :)  Try this with the Spicy Spam and it tastes even better!

I made it recently following this recipe, I bought everything and cooked everything(except letting the rice sit for 4 hours). I can’t eat this following the recipe. I was already concerned with the sodium content and ignored it. I ate two pieces as I felt like I wasn’t going to make it...the salt content makes it unbearable to eat anymore of it. I still have the salty taste in my mouth as I’m writing this review. 0/10 wouldn’t try this recipe again

I was born and raised in Hawaii (Oahu, house on Kaneohe Bay - such a rough upbringing...). And if you live in Hawaii, you either love spam, or you think it's gross. Most of us are the former, and love this Frankenstein'd meat.

Anyhow, just want to say I've been using this recipe for a while as it captures my preferred flavor of spam musubi. You can, of course, substitute chicken, bacon, pork, etc., but only in addition to also having dedicated spam musubi as well. Because if you make this without any spam, you are not worthy.

If you're in the mood to build further upon this recipe, then you can do what I dub as the Royal Hawaiian Spam Musubi. To do this, cook some bacon and scramble some eggs. When "assembling" your masterpiece, do the rice half-way, then add a bacon layer, topped by the egg, then add the spam layer. Wrap it up fully in seaweed (only flaw in this posted recipe is the thin band of seaweed - this baby needs to be fully wrapped in seaweed) and you have a nice variant of the base spam musubi.

That aside, even if you just do the spam musubi per the directions, it's great.

I made this for a luau and was skeptical since I'd never eaten or made anything like it but it was delicious! The spam tasted like teriyaki chicken and the rice was delicious with the vinegar. I borrowed my sisters musabi press and would definitely recommend using one as it sped up the process and they all came out uniform. I sprayed the press with cooking spray to keep the rice from sticking.

I love this recipe! I've made it multiple times and it's better than any Spam Musubi I've bought from a restaurant. Highly recommend!

To save time, I just cook the rice in rice cooker and add the vinegar to it while cooking. I also don't cut the nori in half and end up using two nori sheets per musubi.

Oh, and I use an asian sauce container, the small rectangular ones, as the perfect mold for the rice.

I've never tried true Hawaiian musubi so I wasn't sure what to expect. I followed the recipe ingredients exactly and flavor was good but a tad too salty. Will use low sodium soy sauce in the future. Molding the rice without a musubi maker was disastrous for me, so I ended up slicing the cooked  spam into strips and rolling it in the rice covered nori on a sushi rolling mat. Fun change of pace but not something I would crave.

Tried this tonight and really liked it! Had it with some maki. A bit salty so it's important to get the rice to spam ratio right!

This was suprisingly tasty!  We made it for a luau and it was gobbled up immediately.  Give yourself some time to put it together, it is well worth the time.

It was good, but I prefer my mom's marinade without the oyster sauce (I was born and raised in Hawaii and I guess I am used to her version).

Is this supposed to use seasoned rice vinegar? I didn't like it with just rice vinegar. Much better after I added seasoned rice vinegar to it. I had a horrible time with my sushi molds. One was just ridiculously large and the other was too small. So I ended up having to cut the spam to fit. It came out more appetizer size, which end the end was better. This is only a four for me when using the seasoned rice vinegar. After reading the reviews about too much marinade I cut the amount in half and it was perfect. My kids liked this one.

Soooo good!  Thanks so much, didn't realize the "secret" ingredient, the oyster sauce.  Gives it that savory something that you can't put your finger on!  Oh, and of course CRISPY spam is the absolute only way to go!

These are pretty good! My kids and I gobbled them up, but my husband was not impressed. We prefer the spam to be nice and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Mmmm, mmm good.

Thanks so much for this recipe. I made it for my hula class and everyone liked it. I think I'll put less rice vinegar next time, maybe 3-4 tablespoons as I found it a little strong, but that's entirely up to one's personal taste.

This tasted just like the ones I get at in Japantown!  Handling the rice was a bit tricky for me because it kept sticking to my hands, but it was worth it in the end.  I might try using my rice cooker to cook the rice next time because I think the rice may have turned out a too mushy.  The marinate for the Spam was delicious, but a lot of it dripped into my wok and burned as I was frying it.  Shaping the musubi was time consuming, but it was a great recipe overall.

It was very good and easy to make. The only issue I had was getting the rice together. I do not have a rice press, so I tried to make them by hand. The rice cakes came out looking like two different aliens made a very ugly baby. Presentation aside, I was happy with them. I may go with low sodium soy sauce as they were a bit salty, or half and half. Will definitely make again.

This tasted great!  The only thing is I didn’t marinate it as soy sauce and spam would be way too salty. I feel you like sauces sweet then this is a great recipe for you.  It was a little too sweet for me so plan on using less sugar next time.  Outside of that, this is fantastic!

I've been using this recipe for years. Like others noted, simply cooking calrose rice and no vinegar is just fine. I also use a long sushi press that covers the entire sheet and 2 1/3 spam slices. After wrapping the long roll, I cut into small bite size pieces. Great for parties and hungry coworkers.

We followed the recipe exactly as it said. And it turned out amazing! Just like the musubi back in Hawaii! The only thing we did differently is use less rice (didn’t want to get full too quick!) we were able to make like 6-10 musubi per container. My biggest tip is to try not to cook it when it’s soaked in the marinated sauce. Or else it’ll “burn” a little more than you want. Also, that rice vinegar is key!!!! Balances out the saltiness!!! We added scrambled eggs and avocado for taste.Enjoy!!!!

Just a suggestion, cut the bottom side of the spam can and you can use that as a “musubi” mold. Place that on top of nori, add rice, press down, add spam and press down to release mold then fold nori over. I don’t eat spam but my family does and we normally don’t use sushi rice but regular calories medium grain rice and fry the spam in shoyu and sugar. This recipe sounds interesting to make for my family. Thanks!

Excellent recipe. Used mirin instead of oyster sauce and added fresh ginger to the marinade, so searing it smelled like heaven. Sliced some Japanese pickled daikon (the bright yellow stuff) to go in. After forgetting to mix furikake into the rice we just dipped the finished musubi into it between bites. That's a win.

Most amazing spam musubi I’ve ever made. I substituted Aji-Mirin for Rice Vinegar since I didn’t have have any on hand. Like another reviewer, I also recommend using roasted/salted seaweed. I bought mine from a Japanese market.

I used about three cups of rice for my recipe and used thicker slices with two cans of spam instead of the one. I thought that the 6 tablespoons of rice vinegar was questionable so i halved it and it was definitely too much for my taste. It doesnt really fit in with the salty sweet taste of the spam after it was cooked. The amount of vinegar just took over the taste. Next time i’ll just use two tablespoons and try that out. Maybe even less.

I was throwing my sister a Luau party and was looking for easy  ideas. This receipt was easy to make and with a little tweak on the second try was perfect. 
I subestute regular spam with low sodium light spam. Just as tasty lower calories. It turned out fabulous. People that came that never eat spam nor would ever, ate this. The Nori was too chewy on the first try, but after it sat for a few minutes and was moist it was easier to eat. So the second time I made it, which was today. I ran the Nori gently through the water before setting on my prep mat and adding the rice and spam. Super easy.

I substituted mango habañero for the oyster sauce, and strawberry preserves for the sugar. Also I don't own a press but I made due with a couple of knives.

You can microwave the sugar and the vinegar mix as well to cut back on prep time. Then add this mixture to the rice and mix well.

So yummy! Wow what a treat. This was my first time making it for myself and my husband. Normally we just buy it but we bought our musubi mold and it worked great. I mainly used this recipe to get the marinade I was looking for. I didn't bother soaking the rice. I would definitely say follow the rule of only marinating the spam for 5 minutes because any longer and it gets very salty. I did not have any rice vinegar so I didn't use it but it tasted just like the musubi I normally buy.

Great recipe. My second time making spam musubi.  Brings me back to Hawaii! I used low sodium spam but should've used less soy sauce. It was a tad bit salty for me. Husband had it and really enjoyed it. I only used two sheets of nori and toasted it on the burner and cut into 1.5 inch strips with scissors. Like someone else mentioned, I used the spam container as my mold. Use Saran Wrap to line the mold then add rice. With a wet spoon, press down the rice. Pull the Saran Wrap out with the rice. Will definitely make again.

Yummy recipe! Tweaked the flavor up a bit by dipping the cooked spam into the marinate sauce and also adding a spoonful of the marinate sauce into the rice prior to putting the spam to the rice :)

Loved it. A friend made this dish for me a while ago, and I've been craving it since. Working with the sushi rice was a little tricky but honestly its an easy and tasty dish. I recommend this and hope to make it again.

ONO! Brought back memories of living in Hawaii 20 years ago. I did a few things different though. I left out the oyster sauce and used teriyaki sauce instead of shoyu. I also used turkey spam as I no longer eat pork. I've done a variation using tinned corned beef and that was delicious also.

This was great. I used medium-grain white rice, which worked fine. I also sprinkled some furikame in between the rice and the Spam for extra flavor. I liked it better when the nori was cut smaller, so I cut the nori by another half for the last half of the batch. As recommended by others, I lowered the heat to medium. Will make again.

I tried Spam Musubi at a local Hawaiian restaurant and loved it so I had to try and make it at home.  

I didn't have 4 hours to marinate the rice, so I used short grain rice, rinsed it 3x until it ran clear and then cooked in my rice cooker according to the package directions.  It came out fantastic and really shortened the recipe time.  

I also used the low sodium variety of spam.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out so good!  My friends commented that they would never have guessed it had spam in it.  Marinating and cooking the spam really changes the flavor and texture.  It's salty, but the rice is not so it creates a fantastic savory unctuous balance.

We didn't marinate it but glazed it in the pan while frying and it still turned out great!  I think next time I'll roll it instead of layering it to get more seaweed taste which really highlights and binds all the flavours together.

I like another style better, just regular rice and a teriyaki based sauce. The sushi rice is a little off tasting with the spam for me.

I love musubis and this recipe is great.  However, it calls for oil but doesn't include it in the steps.  I figured I was supposed to use it to fry the Spam so that's what I did.  I just took a tray of about 30 of them to my husband's work.  I used an Asian hot sauce for half of them.  I added it to half of the soy sauce mixture, and added a thin strip of Jalapeno, between the Nori strip and the Spam.  They are yummy!

My husband ate Musubi almost every day we were in Hawaii last year so he has been asking me to make them ever since we got home. I finally gave in and thought I'd try this recipe for his birthday. I followed the recipe for the first batch but the rice vinegar was overpowering and you couldn't taste the seared spam. I ended up remaking the rice and completely omitted the vinegar. MUCH better. (I used medium grain sushi rice and followed the directions on the package-didn't soak it first so it only took 20 min to make and worked great). I also doubled the soy sauce and omitted the oyster sauce (fishy smells or tastes make me gag). My husband said it tasted almost exactly like the ones he loved in Hawaii.

Made as directed, and wanted to like it..but found it just OK. Kids ate it, but the novelty of Nori wore off once they tasted it. Found the oyster sauce a bit overpowering at times. Again OK, and probably a taste you grow into.

I live part time in Hawaii with my dad and growing up there I love love love the food! I eat all kinds of local food. This is my all time favorite! My dad buys it for me all the time from the Minit Stop down the road. The recipe is delicious except when I make it I don't use the oyster sauce or the vinegar.

My son fell in love with this when visiting Hawaii.  Great for kids to participate in the kitchen.  Bad for those on low sodium diets.

i saw the recipe and made changes.  i'm pregnant so my tastebuds are pretty extreme.  I wanted less salty, more sweet, less sour and more of a fishy taste.  I bought SPAM Light, slices were cut thinner, i carmelized the spam in the oven in its marinade, 4 spoons of vinegar in rice instead of 6, and my musubis are fully covered in seaweed (choking hazard so take small bites).  I love it and will do this again

My hubby just adores Spam and sushi so I knew he would go wild over this. I cut the Spam to make it more of an appetizer size and all of our guests raved over what they referred to as an "ingenious, not to mention delicious little recipe". Who would have thought that you could take something so ordinary and turn it into quite an elegant and certainly company worthy appy. Thank you!

I never knew I'd like spam wrapped in rice and seaweed so much.  Great flavor, and a wonderful snack.

This tasted like the Spam Masubi you would buy in a restaurant! I cut the sugar in half and made 20 mini Spam Masubi's and it was great!! Thanks!!

This is a simple and very tasty recipe.  Toasting nori helps, and I cut down on the sugar by half - don't like my rice that sweet.
