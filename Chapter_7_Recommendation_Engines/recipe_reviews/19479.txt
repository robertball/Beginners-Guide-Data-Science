My boyfriend and I loved this fish and chips. He has been to London and New Zealand and found this to be one of the best recipes we have ever run across. We used seasoned breadcrumbs to add a little more flavor. Great recipe!!!

Super easy. Super fast. And YUMMY. I used Tilapia, since my local supermarket did not have red snapper. Will definitely be making this again soon! Thanks a bunch.

I tried this with flounder and it was very good. It really brings out the flavor of the fish. My 2-year-old did try one piece, which I consider a victory!

Very Good and Very Simple. I added seasoning salt and Italian spices to the bread crumbs for a little more flavor.

We weren't thrilled with this recipe.  I think we just prefer batter-fried fish with seasonings like garlic powder, seasoning salt, and cayenne.

This is a terrific recipe to "make your won"  add whatever spices you would like to suit your taste, and it turns out absolutely perfect.  Another example of less being more!  Hard to believe such an incredibly simple recipe could turn out such a great product.  Thanks for sharing a definite keeper.

Perfect, no spices needed. Just add tartar sauce, french fries and a salad.

Just great!  I used cod instead of snapper, which was yummy, too.  Very simple and easy and everyone gobbled it right up!  My hubby likes with malt vinegar.  Thanks!

much easier in my experience compared to the flour and vinegar etc recipes. whizzed up some bread in the blender and beat some egg. i added salt and pepper to the beaten egg. also i did an extra coating of the egg after breadcrumbs followed by more breadcrums to make sure it didnt fall apart. the cod came out nice and juicy with a crispy outside! in the pic its broken to check the inside was cooked. thank you!

Wonderful and simple.  Just a little note.  Taste your breadcrumbs before you begin dipping your fish.  The breadcrumbs, if not seasoned ones, may need a little bit of salt added.  My 4 yr-old, who doesn't normally eat fish, loved this fish and asked for more!  Imagine that...!

Great recipe for fried fish.  Bread crumbs made the crust crisp and did not overpower the fish.
We added some seasoning to the bread crumbs.
Excellent recipe!
