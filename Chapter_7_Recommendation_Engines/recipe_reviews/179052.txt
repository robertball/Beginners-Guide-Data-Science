WOW! This was so incredibly fantastic and creamy. The only change I had was instead of boiling the soup immediately after cooking the apples, onions, & squash in oil, I threw it in the crock pot overnight. SO DELICIOUS!

This was a GREAT recipe! I did make a few changes though...I added 4 chopped cloves of Garlic and just a few pinches of Nutmeg. I will make this again for sure!

I don't care for Swanson broths, not much flavor and the salt and/or msg just dosn't get it for us. Used 'Imagine' chicken broth 1st time and only 1/8 tsp cayenne, used a squeeze of dark honey instead of sugar and added  a bit of lemon juice at the end. 2nd time used 'Wolfgang Puck' chicken broth and used Jonagold apples instead of Granny Smith. WOW to both! Now I make it often and either way and just keep trying different spices and amounts.

Fantastic!  We had this at our Christmas dinner and everyone ate it, even the preschooler and toddler.  My husband didn't care for the sage butter, but since that's added to each bowl to taste he left it out in later bowls.  He also hates squash in general but liked this.  We served it again last week when we had dinner with friends and it was a huge hit.  It's now on regular rotation.  The only changes we made were because the pantry was low: boullion & water instead of broth; McIntosh apples and therefore slightly reduced sugar; and since I didn't have sage leaves I melted a bunch of butter in a skillet, put in a tablespoon of rubbed dry sage, simmered for a minute, and then strained the butter.

Wow! We served this recipe for company, never having made it before, and for someone we later found out, doesn't like squash soup. She really liked it and asked for the recipe. We also had extra and shared it with a nieghbour who absolutely raves about it and also asked for the recipe! Thank-you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe. We're going to serve it again for New Year's Eve supper. Yummm.

Amazing!!! I loved this soup. I added one sweet potato and it was great! I also put the Onion, apple, butternut squash and sweet potato in the oven to roast a bit for a nice taste. I will be making this a lot this fall. :D 
Also, I cooked the sage in the soup and chopped it up with the soup blender instead of putting it on top of soup at the end. I think I added 4-5 leaves. And sprinkling toasted pumpkins seeds on top is a nice touch

This was amazing. Only thing I did different was roast the butternut squash in the oven with olive oil, salt and pepper @ 475 for 35 min. Next time I may add some sage to that step. I also used one big fuji apple. I made a similar recipe from food and wine mag which used popcorn as a garnish, which was a big hit!

Update - I left some sage in the leftover soup, and the next day it was very sage-y!  I had to cover it up with agave nectar.  Even 2-3 sage leaves become very strong overnight.

Absolutely perfect!  I am kind of picky about my Butternut Squash soup - it always seems to be to bland and sweet or to spicy.  This recipe is awesome though.  And the sage butter/fried sage is pure genius!

This is a wonderful "special" soup for family and friends during the holidays. Unfortuantly not everyone likes Butternut Squash, but for those willing to give it a try, are "pleasantly surprised".  This is one of my favorite recipies and I followed it exactly as written.  You can't go wrong!!  Thanks Campbells Kitchen for sharing this terrific soup!

Honestly, this came out terrible for me.  I'm not sure if the 1 inch cubes should have been smaller.  I'm not sure if the cayenne pepper that dominated the taste was necessary.  I have no idea.  Only 1 person at my dinner liked it, and that person was not me. I hope this recipe comes better for anyone reading this, but I followed the recipe and it was not good. I'm sorry, I love cooking and most recipes I read on AllRecipes are good, but this one did not come out good at all.

It's wonderful - the butternut squash and granny smith apples go very well together. It was also pretty straightforward to make.

I really love this soup.  I have made it twice now...the first time I followed the recipe completely and it was good. The second time I changed a couple of things;  I added an extra onion, and a little less sugar, as I thought it was a little sweet.  Also, I omitted the coriander, and the cayenne pepper...instead I used about 1/2 tsp. of ground cumin and a healthy pinch of salt,  32 oz swansons chix broth, and 1/4 cup of half and half.  I served this soup up with some home made rolls, and my family loved it.  There was enough soup to freeze some for a later date.

I made the recipe as stated. At the end I added a 1/2 tsp of ginger and about a 1/2 tsp of salt. I felt that it was lacking in flavor. After adding some seasoning I would give it 4 stars. It was really good.

I doubled the recipe and it just didn't turn out. At a family dinner for 11, nobody liked it. The cayenne & coriander was overpowering and the whole thing was too tart. I won't be making this one again!

The base soup was decent for a "healthy" dish.  The cayenne was a "must".  I am currently on a no grain, no dairy, no added sugar, 30-day "whole food" detox program, so I left out the sugar and butter.  Husband and I thought it was good enough, but kids didn't like it at all. Didn't have the sage for the finish, so not sure if that "makes the dish" or not.  Enjoyed for one-time, but probably won't make again until after the kids grow up!

I did not like this soup.  If I make it again, I would reduce the apples to just one apple.  It tasted too apple-y.  I prefer a more butternut flavor.

Smooth and savory.  I used homemade broth to make it and that adds a bit because it is denser.  I added a bit more sugar.

This was really interesting.  Both me and my husband took our first taste and thought it was really good!  After 3 or 4 bites, I was still really impressed how it turned out, I really liked the Sage leave addition.  But after that, it just didn't taste as good and by the end of my small bowl, I felt like I was forcing myself to eat it.  It made a TON and we had lots of leftovers that neither of us wanted to eat.  I'm not sure what happened, I guess the squash ended up being too much for us.  From a recipe point of view, I didn't change anything, but I did have to cook the squash longer than 10 minutes for it to be tender.

Love this recipe!  Especially on a cold fall/winter day.  I save time by buying cut butternut squash at Costco.  The cayenne adds a nice warmth.

I have a large family so I doubled the recipe.  Used organic chicken stock instead of Swanson's broth.  I really enjoyed the flavor of this soup.  I think the apples added a nice touch of sweetness and loved the red pepper for that little bit of kick also.  I also really liked that this recipe didn't have cream in it since I have a milk intolerance.

This was tasty and perfect for a cold afternoon.  It took about 20 mins longer for me to get the squash soft, but maybe my pieces were too big.  I swapped out the sugar for a couple of splashes of apple juice.  Everyone loved it.

A bit labor intensive to make with cutting up the squash and apple. The soup has a bit of a bite - probably from the red pepper - but it's still pretty good.

I really like this soup. The sage infused butter is a must, I stir it in before serving to avoid the oil slick appearance of just floating it on top.

Tasty, easy and a wonderful soup to welcome fall as we did tonight. My husband and I enjoyed it as it but put some extra brown sugar in our daughters bowls and so the 3 year old ate it happily - 16 month didn't come around though - next year I bet.) The sage leaves and butter were a lovely flavoring and garish. I recommend this!

It looks so good!  I like the idea of sage in the soup.  I'll write back if I get around to making it! :)

I followed the recipe exactly and it actually turned out pretty good. I don't like butternut squash, but adding the apples and onions to it gave the soup such a great flavor.

A rich, creamy, excellent soup! I roasted the squash in the oven for 30 minutes or so (halved and seeded) before cubing it and adding to the other ingredients. I didn't have sage leaves or add any ground sage, but this was fabulous regardless. I had to have a second bowl!  I think the inclusion of the apples really helps put this at another level. This is a recipe I'd gladly make for guests and large gatherings.

Excellent soup for Fall!  Made with a veggie mock chicken broth, but other than that as written.  This was well-liked by everyone in my house.  I will make this again!

Very tasty, but I haven't figured out the correct way to cut the squash, so that part was a real pain and time-consuming.  I tried 3 different types of knives, and all of them were difficult to cut through.

It was AMAZING!  Loved the sage on top, just perfect.  Had Honey Crisp apples here and used them.  Truly one of the best recipes, ever.  Will now have guests over and serve to them.  Thanks, so much.  Glenda

We loved this. It was so creamy. I've made other butternut squash soup recipes, this is by far the easiest. I added a little apple cider, and cut back an equal amount on the broth. I also toasted some pecans along with the sage leaves and added them in. I will definitely make this again.

It's a weird soup.  I think that it's best described as hot apple sauce with a kick.  The apple overwhelms the squash.  I made it, and I was wondering about how two apples would be in this soup. Previously when I've made a soup with apple, I have used 1/2 an apple for this quantity of soup.

This recipe is a hit with my friends and family. I always get lots of compliments. One modification I do to cut fat and calories is completely delete the butter. Instead, I add 3 large fresh sage leaves to the soup mixture as it simmers in a crock pot on high for 2 hours. Then I just blend the soup at the end. The smell is therapeutic and the soup is incredibly creamy (without having to add fatty cream)... so you get the best of both worlds. :)

I used Acorn Squash with this recipe. It turned out "nice" but not great. I think I would rather have it strained through some cheese cloth or something as it was overly textured. I think I will also add some more chicken boullion next time. The presentation was awesome and after the few tweaks listed above, this will be a holiday regular!
