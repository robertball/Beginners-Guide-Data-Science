The cheesecake was great but as I did not have a springform pan, I made two servings of the crust and divided up the filling ,baked at 350 for 35 minutes and I got two cakes instead of one!

I loved this chocolate cheesecake!  It was really good, my husband(who doesn't really like chocolate that much), really loved it also.  Along with a few friends.  Only thing I changed was I used chocolate wafers for the bottom instead of graham crackers.  And I put homemade whipped cream on top.

Sooo yummy! This is an extremely rich dessert but very very good (esp. if you like dark chocolate). I made it for a dinner party and everyone complimented me. I thought it might need a little something extra, so after it cooled, I removed the cake from the springform pan and put sliced strawberries all over the top. I also made a chocolate ganache (also on here-- from Ingrid Vogel) and drizzeled it over the berries and down the sides of the cake, using about half of the ganache. It looked and tasted wonderful! Thanks for the recipe!

I made this cheesecake and used ghirardelli semi sweet baking chocolate and semi sweet chips and my parents were in heaven.  I loved it too but I couldn't believe the rave reviews or how easy this recipe was.  way to go on this one:)

This cheesecake was better than i expected. I only wish I had seen the cheesecake tips before I pulled it out of the oven. It didn't look too pretty but it tasted awesome. Next time I'll do the water bath correctly and maybe it wont crack in the middle so badly! Also the recipe is a bit confusing because it says to preheat the oven to 350 for the crust and then turn it Down to 350 for the cake!? I baked the crust at 375 and almost burnt it. I think 350 would work better the next time.

This is a great recipe for chocolate cheesecake.  It is not too rich or chocolaty.  But, you still get full chocolate flavor.  I made the crust with vanilla wafers because that was all I had available.  Next time, though, I will try the graham cracker crust.

Great chocolate taste, not too sweet.  I covered outside of pan with foil and baked it in a water bath. No cracks..Just wonderful. I liked that it only needed 2 packs of cream cheese, too.

I really liked this recipe because it only has 2 packages of Cream cheese but still has all the flavor of a cheesecake!  I use this recipe as a base and make changes like using mint chocolates instead or adding a caramel sauce to give it a different feel!  It is also easy to make!  Thanks for a great recipe~!^^

This came out really well and was very easy to make.  Warning: This is an extremely rich dessert!  Serve small slices!  I served average sized slices and no one could finish b/c it was too rich.  It was so sad to see that cake go into the trash!

I don't know if I did something wrong, as this was my first time trying this recipe, but I cooked this for 55 mins, and it almost seemed TOO done.  Also, the crust was chewy, not crunchy like I would've preferred...it was TOUGH to cut through.  However, the two men in the house LOVED IT and left nothing behind.

I thought this cheesecake was pretty good. I made half of the batch, and made a layered cheesecake. (Fudge Cake, Cheesecake, Homemade Whip Cream, Ganache.) I liked it quite a bit, but I wish there was a little something extra to take away from the strong cream cheese taste I noticed. (I like cheesecake, but not very strong cheesecake).

I made this recipe twice.  The first time I omitted the cream and the flavor was incredible.  Fudge like.
But I did not like the appearance of the cheesecake itself.  The second time I added the cream and felt the same way about the appearance (not pretty) and the flavor was not as good.
