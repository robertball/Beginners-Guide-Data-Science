Loved it!   The herbs flavor came through.  Very basic and easy.  Cooked at 350 for about 1-1/2 hours.  Took out at 130 degrees and let rest.  Inside was pink, outside well done and moist.

I had a 4 lb. beef tenderloin and 6 people for dinner. I didn't want a 2 step process(sear and roast). I mixed the olive oil and all the  ingredients togetherand spread like a paste. Added salt and peppe first. I cooked it  for 50 minutes.  It was fabulous. Medium rare from edge to edge  and very flavorful.

Headline: Simple and easy-does-it recipe leads to a flavorful dinner. I cooked this to rare, as we prefer it that way. Thank you for the recipe.

I only made a half tenderloin. I tried it twice. I recommend cooking at lower temp, 400 and for only 35 minutes with smaller size. I also sauteed mushrooms with butter on stovetop and added to tenderloin for the last 10minutes.
