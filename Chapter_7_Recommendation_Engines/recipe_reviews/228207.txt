left out the peppers (since I didn't have any) and switched the chives for Italian seasoning, used mushroom marinara for more veg....turned out really well.

This recipe was delicious!  I left the peppers out and used ground chicken. The family could not get enough. My fiance actually thought it was a stouffers frozen meal he couldn't believe I'd made it. I will definitely make it again.
