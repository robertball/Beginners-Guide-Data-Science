I really just used the sauce since I already love the way I fry my wings.  The sauce was great!  It tasted just like Bennigan's sauce.  My husband will never buy wings anymore.

I had to add a little more cayenne pepper to suit my taste, but it was exactly the recipe I was looking for; a fried spicy wing.

These were awesome!  I baked mine without the flour...just added the spices to the chicken and baked.  Then spiced up the hot sauce on the stove and poured it over the wings and baked them a little more the get them crispy.  EXCELLENT!

These were to die for!  Yummy!  Next time I will try it with boneless, skinless chicken breast.

Very tasty. However, for 24 wings (three segment wings) I had to double the batter recipe. Also, FYI, 4 cups of oil will only deep fry in a deep cooker that will allow only 4 wings at a time to cook and thus drives up the cooking time. Just plan accordingly or get more oil with a bigger pot.  I found one stick unsalted butter with table spoon of garlic and 4 tbls of ground parmesan cheese to be a good dipping sauce. Also for traditional buffalo sauce, one stick of butter with a cup of Frank's Red Hot Buffalo sauce a good combination.

The breading and the meat both tasted odd to me.

This is a great recipe for chicken wings!  I love the flavor of the wings and since they are not dipped in the sauce until after they are fried they were great for my family since I have little ones who don't like them hot.  I got my hot wings and they got fried chicken so everyone was happy!

So tasty. We coated these in a honey buffalo sauce mixture. It was crispy, spicy and sweet. Perfection!

This was just ok....Cayenne pepper was not enough to make it spicy and the dipping sauce was tasteless.

Not bad.  Perhaps next time I will bake this with the hot sauce on top to give it more of that hot wing flavor.
