Nice change of pace from the regular grill cheese sandwiches routinely served.  Used caramelized onions in place of the red onion as that's all I had and served with Roasted Red Pepper and Tomato Soup also from AR.  Easy, peasy dinner which everyone enjoyed!

Grilled cheese turned up to eleven! I think the only thing that I would change would be to saut√© the onions a little first, so that the sandwich isn't overwhelmed by the raw onion flavor.

The only thing I did differently was to use sourdough sandwich bread that is thinner than what the recipe called for.  I put the cheese next to the bread on both slices, and I used the same pan (wiped out) that I used for frying the bacon.  I'd recommend that if you also use thinner bread like this that your food all be at room temperature so the cheese will melt appropriately!  Thanks for a very yummy lunch!

This was the perfect answer to "I forgot to take something out for dinner."  Actually had all the ingredients on hand.

My husband and son loved this recipe, Me too! I used a panini maker instead of the skillet to fry the sandwiches-- I turned them 1/4 turn halfway through to make cross-wise marks on the sandwiches.  Very good

A good sandwich. Pepperjack is not our favorite cheese, so we may try this with another cheese next time.

I made these sandwiches exactly as the recipe directed, and they were awesome! For me, I could do without the bacon, but my husband insisted! Next time his will have bacon, and mine won't!

This was a very good sandwich!  I layered in this order:  bread, cheese, bacon, onion, avocado, cheese,  bread - so that the cheese would get good and melted!  The sourdough bread is a must!

this was an awesome sandwich. I agree with another reviewer and will sautee the onions next time.  My kids were reluctant to try avocado and now love it. I assembled the sandwich and used my counter top grill instead of a skillet.

I used veggie bacon and added tomato slices and mustard. Loved it! The sourdough is key.

I loved it!  I've had gourmet grilled cheese before, but I'll admit that this one was better.  I used two other cheeses (whatever I had available) instead of pepperjack and I found that olive oil worked better than butter.  I also did not use onions and regular bacon instead of thick.  I will DEFINITELY be making this again!  (I might even add jalapenos next time.)

Loved it, indeed! I had to use prosciutto crudo, ok, it's not bacon. It's all I had in the fridge. So, sue me. The creamy avocado and the spicy cheese just make a great couple. Thank you for the recipe.
