My mother in law has a banana cake receipe that she is guarding like the family gold but my husband craves the stuff like a pregnant woman.  So I came here looking for something that might tide him over till our next family outting and he actually said it was better than his mothers.  Score one for the wives.  Anyway.  I love this receipe.  I love that we throw sliced banans in.  I really think that makes a difference.  We eat it plain and frosted.  I always make it in a pampered chef stoneware bar pan and it comes out so nicely.

As I was saying to a friend, any recipe made by someone named Bertha HAS to be  made by me. It's GOT to be good. I did throw in a tsp. of baking powder and a half tsp. of salt. I didn't have quite enough chopped bananas, so I took what was left of a pound of organic strawberries, chopped them up and threw them in, too. This took about an hour to bake, give or take, and it came out moist and fluffy. I didn't have any with the family, but judging by their faces and lack of conversation at the table, they enjoyed this. I DID NOT make a glaze for this. This one's a keeper.

I'm a soft touch for recipes that have "Grandma's" in the title. Grandmas had the best recipes and they knew what the best was supposed to be because they all seemed to know what they were doing.  Sure enough, Gramma Bertha's cake did not disappoint me, although I took a little liberty with her recipe by adding 1 tsp. of vanilla and 1/2 tsp. salt.  When I cut into the cake I got concerned when I saw what looked like uncooked batter.  But not to worry!  I had never added sliced bananas to a batter rather than mashing them and what I was seeing (whew!) was the sliced bananas!  I have no criticism of this recipe whatsoever (although I'm glad for my small additions).  First, I love the texture of it - it's not as dense, as "wet" if you will, as banana breads (cakes) can sometimes be.  It does have a well-developed crumb, so in my view this really is a banana CAKE, not banana bread masquerading as one.  It's moist and just sweet enough â€“ remember,  the closer to mushy black your bananas are, the sweeter they'll be and so will the cake.  Mine were brown-speckled.  Because I baked it in a specialty Bundt pan with a lot of detail I didn't frost or glaze it, just sprinkled it with powdered sugar and I'm kind of glad for it - the cake stands on its own with no other frosting or glaze necessary, although a chocolate butter cream or cream cheese frosting would be nice, as would a vanilla or caramel glaze.  Gramma Bertha's cake, I'm sure, has pleased a lot of family and friends.

Note: With my changes I rate this recipe a 5 stars *****. With 10 bananas "past their prime" I was desperate to find a way to use them. This recipe fit the bill! This is definitely a cross between a cake and a bread, but who cares? It is delicious! I used 5 small bananas and omitted the sour cream; this was still plenty moist! I also added 1 tsp of ground cinnamon and 1 tsp of vanilla. I mashed my bananas, which wasn't hard to do considering their condition! Thanks for the post!

Wow Gramma Bertha - this is one heck of a banana cake!  This definitely IS a cake which is fabulous because sometimes banana cakes tend to taste more banana bread.  This recipe is so easy to put together and doesn't require a lot of ingredients - nothing fancy, just plain good!  I used 1 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar and like most others I smashed my bananas vs. slicing.  I also added 1 tsp. of vanilla and 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon along with a 1/2 tsp. of salt.  And to take an already delicious cake over the top I added a whole bag of mini-chocolate chips!  It was done in exactly one hour and turned out moist, tender and delicious!  No icing needed, just a dusting of confectioners' sugar over top once it cooled.  Thanks for sharing your Gramma's recipe LISAPAV!

I really like this recipe and urge you guys to try it, but I cut down the sugar by a little since I don't like my cakes to be too sweet.  Stick to the recipe closely and it will turn out fine.  I tried to make it a second time and used 4 bananas instead of 3 and a little too much sour cream.  It turned out really soft and wet, and it was just a pity!

This is a very good recipe for banana cake, my personal favorite...a handful of walnuts and chocolate chips will surely put you over the edge!  If you add the chips, remember to coat them in a little flour before you toss them in the batter!

Good stuff. Real good. I'm always faced with bananas that are not eaten because they turn brown too quickly (nice & sweet, just not as pretty on the outside), so when I see a recipe that calls for more than one banana, I check it out...
This one was a winner! Eleven people had some of mine (baked in a rectangular pan), and each person really liked it. I was the only one who thought it was a bit too sweet (I'll reduce the sugar by a 1/4 cup next time anyway). I live at an elavation of 6800 ft, so I used less leavening (baking powder instead of baking soda). Turned out great!  Getting 11 people to all like the same thing is not an easy task, so I'm quite impressed. This recipe is a keeper, thanks.

This was the best banana cake recipe I've ever made. It was super moist.  The second time I made it, I added a little vanilla and swirled in some frozen blueberries after putting it in the pan and named it Bertha's Blue-bana cake. In both cases, my company complimented how good it was and I had to pack some up for them to take home. I didn't have a bundt pan so I used an 8 x 11-1/2 glass pan.

Very good, and fairly quick.  I added a little vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter.  Watch the cooking time, I checked 10 minutes early and it could have come out 15 minutes early I'm sure.  Frosted it with cream cheese frosting.

I have made this cake several times and my family does love it. The first time I made it I had to substitute some pancake mix for regular flour. I have found than as little as half a cup of pancake mix produces a larger fluffier cake. I have also been using chocolate chips with the recipe which my family loves. This cake is usually polished off fast at my house. I have taught my daughter-in-law to make it because my son loves it so much. I give it four stars becuase I personally find it a bit flat without the pancake mix. However it is an easy recipe that is delicious.

I found this recipe to use up bananas. It is a rich cake. I like it with a cup of coffee. Next time I make it I make it i will add a few chocolate chips or nuts.

I really liked the cake - it was very moist and flavorful and I like just slicing the bananas in - I spent a day making three different types of cake to freeze and this was the first that we ran out of.  When making any banana cake, I always take about a third of the batter and add cocoa then swirl that into the batter in the pan like a marble cake - something I did years ago and now its the only kind of banana cake my family wants.  Anyways, it worked great with this recipe.  It's a keeper for me.
thanks,

Definitely five stars! I served at a bar-b-que (with cream cheese frosting) and everyone loved it! I doubled the recipe and also made muffins. I also added walnuts and baked at 325 degrees until done (that way it's a nice golden brown on outside and done in the middle without burning). Thank you for sharing your Gramma's recipe! Does she have any other special recipes to share??

With some changes this recipe is very good.  I use light sour cream to cut calories and also used only 1 cup plus a fourth for the sugar.  Next time I will cut it to one cup.  I used a teaspoon of vanilla so this makes up some for less sugar. My friends always enjoy my baking since I always figure out how to make it a little better choice.  PLEASE cut back the sugar it is not needed.  

Still wonndering why they posted a chocolate cake instead of a banana one?  i almost past on this recipe when I seen the photo.

Oh my goodness! I made this for my kids but I don't think I will share!!! I subbed Greek Yogurt for Sour Cream (you can do this with any recipe and you cannot tell the difference! Sooo much healthier) I also added walnuts and baked in 2 loaf pans for 1 hr. You have to try it!

Wow.  This cake is flavourful and moist.  I added four bananas, 1 t. brandy extract, 1 t. cinnamon and 1 t. ground flax.  (the flax is for added nutritional value not flavour)  This cake could be made with grated carrots, raisins, just about anything in addition to the banana.  I am making it again tonight for dinner guests and plan to serve it with brandy whip cream.  What a great way to use up those expired bananas!

I have tried a lot of different banana cake recipes that were not very good, but this one is a keeper.  I baked mine in a 13 X 9 cake pan for about 40 minutes then frosted it with cream cheese frosting.   The best banana cake ever!  So moist and tasty.  I love how the bananas are sliced not mashed.  This will forever be my go to banana cake recipe!!

I love this recipe because is so so simple and tasty.  Ingredients that you can find in your fridge or pantry on any given day. You can leave it stand alone or add vanilla, cinnamon or a glaze if you choose.  Thanks for the recipe!

It is hard to find a banana cake recipe that doesn't seem more like a bread, but this recipe certainly fits the bill.  I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon of salt to boost the flavor.  The cooking time seemed to be bang on and the toothpick clean when inserted into the middle.  But, like other reviewers I was concerned when cutting into the cake that it was not cooked properly and maybe mashing the bananas would alleviate this problem next time.  I drizzled a caramel glaze over the turned out cake and it was delicious.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, LISAPAV!!

This was delicious !  I added a teaspoon of vanilla as suggested by others.  Co-workers loved it.  I used a buttercream frosting and thought it was a great compliment to the banana taste.

What I love about this recipe is that it has banana flavor with little bits of banana throughout and no cinnamon or nuts.  This is a nice change from all the banana recipes with cinnamon. I added 1 tsp. vanilla.  Because I bake at high altitude, I usually have to cut back on fat and sugar to make a recipe work for me...so I only used 6 T. butter and 1 c. plus 1 T. sugar.  This cake was pretty sweet with the cutbacks.  Also, I thought it had more of a quick bread texture, and next time I might just bake it in loaf pans.

Very good cake...Moist and certainly Heavy in density. I gave it a 4 star rating, only because I added afew suggested changes. Walnuts, afew Choc. Chips and vanilla.  I think the best added suggestion was to add cocoa to 1/3 of the batter, and marble it into the banana batter.  It gave the cake a very interesting flavor, and not at all too sweet. I would not consider this to be a "bread" at all,,,more of a pound cake.  Well worth trying.

5 stars made with the following alterations: an extra banana, 2 mashed and 2 diced, 1 tsp of vanilla, 1/2 tsp baking powder (to lighten)  and 1 tsp cinnamon. The texture is dense and intensely moist. The sliced/diced bananas make for a nice burst of banana flavor, and set this cake apart from the norm. Be aware that this recipe does not rise very much. Essentially what you see when you turn the batter into your pan is what you'll get. But the flavor is satisfyingly homey and it will keep for at least 3 days. Be sure to cover with an inverted bowl to keep it airtight.

this is a great recipe, I modified it slightly by using only 3/4 cup sugar and 4 very ripe bananas.  I also added 1 tsp salt and 2 tsp vanilla.  The bundt pan works wonderfully for this recipe!  I would definitely make this recipe again.  Thanks for sharing this one!

What a treat!! This disappeared with lightning speed from my kitchen counter!
I used 4 medium bananas and threw in chopped walnuts....reminded me of a pound cake in texture. This is a piece of cake to make...thanks Lisa.

This recipe was excellent and so easy to make.  I used a 9 x 13 pan and iced it with cream cheese frosting and baked it at 350 degrees for 35 minutes.  I brought it to the office and cut in squares and it disappeared within an hour.

Delicious cake.  I used a Splenda/sugar blend and per other comments cut the quantity down to 1 cup.  I also mashed the bananas instead of slicing them.  I added in about 1tsp vanilla, 1tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and stirred about a half cup of chopped walnuts into the batter before pouring.  I cheated and used a Duncan Heinz microwavable glaze (which was very good) and topped with chopped walnuts.  Everyone in the house was in love with this cake...I will definitely make it again, especially knowing that a Splenda/sugar blend will cut calories/sugar without sacrificing taste or texture.

This is certainly a five star recipe. I didn't change it but it appeared to be too much for my bundt pan. Used a loaf pan instead. Was trying to wait for it to    cool but couldn't. It's not too sweet and real moist. Don't take my word, please try it for yourself!!!!

I, my husband and the people at my workplace absolutely loved this recipe. They could not believe how moist it was and wanted me to make more!! The ONLY change I made to this recipe was that, instead of using all white sugar, I used 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I WILL BE MAKING THIS AGAIN !

I live in Colorado and this comes out perfect here. I made it in Illinois for my parents and it came out similar to playdoh. ??? Where does this recipe originate geographically and has anyone else had a similar experience? Otherwise, this is drop-dead great.

This is an unbelievably good cake. I added vanilla and semi sweet chocolate chips (next time I think I'll add milk chocolate or peanut butter chips and an extra banana). I baked mine in a 9x13 pan and added a cream cheese frosting on top. I already had everything in my pantry except for sour cream. It was so much more moist the next day and all I can say is that it tasted amazing (everyone I gave it to at work agreed) and I loved how simple it was. Give this a try, you can spice up the recipe however you like, but be sure not to over-bake it or it will be too dry.

Cut the sugar to one cup and made cupcakes.  Trying to find recipes that make the fancy cupcakes.  This one was perfect.  Baked for 35 minutes. Frosted with cream cheese frosting.  Really special and turned out to be a "fancy cupcake."

Very good and as previously noted, a perfect texture somewhere between banana cake and banana bread.  I used 3 1/2 mashed bananas, 1 tsp. vanilla and will make a confectioners sugar/orange juice glaze.

Excellent recipe!  I made it with just 3 eggs and cut the sugar down by about 1/4 cup.  Very moist and easy to make.  I baked it in 9x13 pan for 38 minutes and topped with cream cheese frosting.

very very good cake...very moist and full of flavour. I put in less sugar because my dad is diabetic, and added vanilla essence. Also because my oven cannot be set to 175 degrees C, i set oven temperature at 180 and baked for about 50 mins. it came out wonderful! just make sure to watch the timing, because you may not need the full amount of time stated in this recipe to get that lovely golden brown colour on the cake. Advice when serving to cut away the crust around the sides because it tends to get real dry

This was an easy recipe, and overall really good.  However, it was more bread-like.  I wanted to try this as-is the first time, but now will try again with some suggesed add-ins from other reviews.  It's worth trying!

So - I made a measuring mistake and added 6 eggs (used egg beaters) instead of 4 but it still came out great! I frosted it with a whipped cream topping and sprinkled some walnuts on top. It was beautiful and delicious. Not too much like banana bread - had a nice cake texture. I'm going to try it again with splenda next time to see if I can make it even more low cal. Thanks for the recipe!

This was a really easy, "no fail" recipe. I barely had any butter left so I used what I had, and replaced the rest with oil and a little bit of milk. I didn't have sour cream, so I replaced that with yogurt. I added a tsp of vanilla and a teaspoon of nutmeg. I think the bananas I used were rather small, as this recipe could use a tiny bit more banana flavour. However, I am sure it is due to the small bananas I had on hand. I mashed the bananas instead as well. I cooked mine in a bundt pan for 60 minutes. This recipe is delicious! Absolutely perfect with a cup of coffee in the morning! Mmmm!

YUMMMMY!!! This is a really good cake. I like it better than my banana bread...my husband is loving it right now. I cooked mine for 45 minutes, as the toothpick came out clean then when I poked it, and I used a real bundt pan. the picture looks like you used something else. hence maybe the longer cooking time?

Excellent cake.  I used a cream cheese frosting.  Unlike some reviewer, I didn't find this cake heavy.  It is not a lite and fluffy cake but definitely not heavy.  Excellent taste.

Hmmm...it just came out of the oven and smells so good! can't wait to try it! I made the following adjustments. I scaled the cake down to 8 servings. Used 1 extra large banana instead of 1 1/2 banana. Subsituted margarine for butter. Subsituted 1/8 cup milk and 1/2 tsp lemon juice for 1/2 cup sour cream. I still baked it in a 10inch bundt pan, but baked it at 350F for only 20 minutes. It came out looking like a ring shaped cake. This recipe is really worth a try!

This cake did not come out dense at all - it was the perfect weight and it was so tasty we didn't even need frosting. However, please check the doneness before 1 hr - mine was done in 40 minutes.

This was a very easy,inexpensive, good and moist cake recipe that I will be making frequently.  It has a mild flavor that the children at my family reunion especially enjoyed, and it was easy for them to eat because I did not frost the cake.  I will add this to my favorites.  Thanks!

Think of a very sweet, soft banana bread.  I really don't know if you can call this a 'cake', but my husband really enjoyed it.  No frosting needed, it's very sweet on its own (too sweet for me).

This cake was delicious.. Not too sweet and yet moist and tasty.  I followed 
directions exactly. It did not rise far up my 10 inch bundt pan so next time I'll
use one of my smaller, different design bundt pans. I frosted this using a half
recipe of "Cream Cheese Frosting II" (Allrecipes) and added a half cup of chopped
pecans to the frosting - a real treat!!  Thanks for posting Lisa - this is a keeper!

I Made this exactly as shown, and it is hands down by far the BEST Banana Cake I've ever tried! I've now made it about 15 times, and I wouldn't change a thing! It actually cooks a bit faster, only about 50 minutes, but that is probably  just my oven. If you're making it for the first time, I recommend that you  watch it after 45 minutes and check to see if it's done when the top is golden brown and you start to really smell it cooking. And Don't worry if the top of the cake is cracked, remember bundt cake is served upside down! This cake even makes a great banana bread when it's not frosted, and I love that it makes a bundt pan sized cake - it's perfect for my large family with plenty of leftovers. This cake is so moist, and the crust is simply amazing - Firm but not tough!  Everyone I know who has tried this cake has liked it  so much that I even used this same recipe and converted  it into smaller loaves and gave them away as Christmas gifts! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, I'll be using it for years to come!

This has great taste and texture and it was very easy to make. I didn't have a bundt pan so I  baked it in a 9X13 and reduced the cooking time to 53 minutes. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I only put in 3/4 tsp baking soda due to high altitude. I think I might make cupcakes/muffins with this recipe next time.

This was SO delicious and fool-proof!  I only made a small substitution because I didn't have enough sour cream.  I had about 2/3 c. so I soured some milk (1/2 c milk w/ about 1T vinegar, sit 5 minutes) and poured that into my cup with sour cream to bring it to one cup and then threw in 1 T of room temp butter.  (Found that substitution online.)  Because I thought maybe I'd be a little too liquidy I tossed it maybe an extra Tablespoon or two of flour.  I also added a little vanilla because I love vanilla - I'm really doubtful it was necessary!  I'm not the greatest baker so I love recipes that are easy - I used a hand mixer for all steps (recipes that require specific handling are sometime out of my league, LOL).  I baked in a (large) convection toaster oven at 325 - 55 minutes later the toothpick was clean all around the cake.  I let it cool as instructed and worried when it didn't come out of the pan right away after the 10 minutes in the pan but after a couple of "knocks" it fell out, still in perfect shape.  I served it to company so I was glad it didn't fall to pieces!  (But still would have served it after tasting it - who cares how it looks - it was AMAZING!)  I didn't put any frosting or even powdered sugar on it as other reviewers said it didn't need anything and it was perfect.  SO, SO, SO good!

I'd give this 4 1/2 stars if I could.  Almost 5 because it is really easy, quick, and almost fool proof.  Not 5 stars because I had to make changes to my personal liking.  For one I took advice and only added 1c sugar (however I then understood why people said it was a bit bland) I added 1tea of vanilla.  Also one big thing I did wrong or changed by accident, I totally forgot to add the 1 c of plain yogurt I was putting in place of 1c of sour cream.  I used 4 pretty large bananas and the cake was pretty moist, in fact I don't know if it would have cooked well with the 4 bananas and the cup of yogurt. It was still vey good without it.  I added about 3/4cup of walnuts also.  I might try brown sugar or some honey in it next time.  I will definitely use this recipe as a base to use up my overripe bananas.  Thanks for the good easy recipe!

Made this in a bundt pan. As others said, you may not want to bake the full hour. I set timer at 40 min. and it was done. (I always set a timer shorter than time calls for then check).  Added salt and vanilla, also yogurt instead of sour cream. Turned out yummy, did not need frosting.
Thanks Gramma !

Very moist and tasty! I added nuts and vanilla, and topped it with "Basic Cream Cheese Frosting" from this site. It took a little less than 60 minutes to be done for me. More like 50-55.

Did as some others suggested and added 1 t baking powder and vanilla. Also added just a smidge of freshly ground nutmeg. I like the texture of this cake, not too dense or heavy, but still very moist. This will be my go to recipe for old bananas now. Thanks for sharing.

This recipe made a lovely, moist, bundt cake which did not require frosting.  I did, however, take some reviewers advice and I added a cup of mini chocolate chips and a cup of coarsley chopped walnuts coated with flour and I mashed the bananas.  I had an ounce or two of gold rum on hand and added that as well. It turned out fabulous and I will use this in the future to use up extra bananas. We loved it.

I made this twice, following the recipe the first time and adding a teaspoon of vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon of salt the second time. My family preferred the one with a little salt and vanilla. It's certainly a good recipe.

Incredibly moist and easy to make. Both my picky eater kiddos loved it! The only change I did was to mash the bananas. No icing needed, just a dusting of confectioners sugar.

This was perfect and fit what I was looking for. I made it mostly the same as the recipe except for 1 tsp of vanilla and I used cake flour instead of all-purpose.  Honestly I think next time I am making them into muffins. Its about the perfect muffin consistency. Add a strudel topping and these would be great.

Excellent.  So easy, moist, delicious as written.  Is usually finished cooking after 45 - 50 minutes in my electric oven.  I've made this several times, sometimes with substitutions, and have enjoyed consistently tasty results.  Would recommend to anyone.  Some of the substitutions I've tried are non-dairy (margarine and imitation sour cream) and low sugar (part sugar and part Brown Sugar Splenda).

This recipe turned out wonderful! I made it exactly as the recipe calls for but did add 1 1/2 cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips. Then I poured it into a silicone Bundt pan and baked it in the microwave for about 12 minutes. I let it cool a bit then turned it out onto my dish. I dusted it with Icing sugar immediately which cause a very light glaze. It was delicious and very easy! I will definitely make this again!

Very moist.  Used 4 bananas and didn't frost cake.  We liked it quite a bit.  Liked that it used the sliced bananas instead of typical mushed ones in recipe.  I do think next time I might add frosting, but it didn't need it.

This wonderfully scented hearty moist cake bread was gone before it was cool, I have used 3 or 4 bananas. I added a tablespoon of vanilla, a dash of cinnamon and a bit of ginger, I used 1 cup brown sugar so it isn't as sweet. I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream. I substituted a half cup of virgin coconut oil for the butter. I use 1 cup unbleached all purpose flour and 1 cup organic coconut flour. I have made this many times tweaking it as I go, I love nuts so I use either walnuts or pecans, either are wonderful. Can add 2 tbsp ground flax as part of the flour.
I bake it 45-50 minutes and check with a toothpick, It was perfect spread with soft butter as the "frosting" 

My family loves this recipe as muffins or 9 x 13 cake pan size. A holiday favorite for gift giving is mini loafs, I wrap up gift baskets with banana nut loaf, cranberry orange loaf, brownies and cookies to give as gifts along with a box of Celestial Seasonings teas.

I remember my mother had a friend named Bertha, and she used to make Banana Cake for us. My mom got her recipe, however, when my mom passed, the recipe went to my sisters, whom never would give it up to me. So, I thank you very much Gramma Berhta's granddaughter for putting it on here. You've answered my prayers. I will treasure it always. Love this comfort food. it brings back many good memories.

Not having ever liked bananas, I loved this cake. Like the other reviewers, I found it moist and delicious. I made no changes to the recipe itself, but added a small sprinkling of cinnamon. I didn't find the sugar too much at all. This is a very good recipe, worth keeping.

Absolutely excellent cake- definitely more like a bread or a pound cake though.  I got a lot of compliments even after I made the following substituions:  used light margarine instead of butter, 2 eggs + 1/2 cup egg beaters, 3/4 cup sugar + 3/4 cup Splenda, and fat-free sour cream.  The texture was a bit different but the tastes was amazing!  I also used the Creamy Frosting recipe from this site to drizzle on top.  Would make again.

This was just what I expected, pretty much banana bread in a bundt pan.  I thought it was a great way to use up old bananas, nothing too special but very tasty.  Next time I would probably add some cinnamon and vanilla and some chopped nuts.

very moist cake.  Has a mild flavor to it, but might be good spiced up with some nutmeg and cinnamon.  I iced it with the Cream Cheese Frosting II from this website and it really was the perfect combination - not overly sweet and very good with a cold glass of milk.

Cake was moist and just average taste to me.  Not much different though from any standard banana bread recipe.  I topped with cream cheese frosting which really helped it out.

not much for bananas but this beats banana bread by far. I used less sugar in the recipe but did sprinkle the cake with powdered sugar. Nice texture and perfect consistency.

This is a great tasting cake but I wonder how people were able to cook it in a bundt form as shown on some posted pictures. Mine turned moist, soft and  fluffy, and fell out completely broken from the bundt. Husband ate cake pieces with a spoon thinking it was supposed to be some sort of crumble cake :) I decided to play along and claimed the best wife trophy once again. Next time I will use spring form and cake will be amazing. 

Listening to suggestions from other reviewers, I added baking soda and baking powder, vanilla extract, and  decorated with crushed walnuts. Thank you for this fantastic recipe!

Delicious! I added vanilla and salt because I love vanilla and salt in my cakes. And my bananas were too ripe to cut so they got lightly mashed. The best banana cake recipe Iâ€™ve ever made, especially with a carmel glaze.

I can't believe how easy it was. The only thing that I did different was to add vanilla.

I made as directed. It looks beautiful and easily popped out of the bundt pan. My notes to others, it is very sweet! Next time, I plan to cut back on the sugar for sure. I enjoy the taste of banana not so much sugar! This is a keeper though, just needs tweaking.

We were looking forward to eating a banana cake.  This tasted very much like a banana bread.  As a banana bread, it is quite delicious.  Although, it didn't taste like a cake at all.    If you are looking for a banana cake, we have baked the Surprise Banana Cake and that was light and fluffy.

Made this for Christmas Eve dessert to take to my daughter's house. My kids loved it and so did I. It was easy to make and came out beautifully. I made Chef John's Cream Cheese Frosting to go with it. Perfect combo. Needy only about 1/2 of the icing.

This is a fantastic cake.  Very easy to put together, and most of the ingredients are something you would have on hand. I was just looking for a banana bundt cake for a casual visit from friends, and found this. Everyone mentioned how good the cake was. I followed the directions exactly. The only thing I would do differently is use Crisco to grease the pan rather than the spray, because I had a little trouble getting it out of the pan, and I think that will help in the future.  It is basically a very fine-textured and delicious banana bread

I made it a couple of times, and as other suggested, I added chocolate chips and chopped walnuts. One time I forgot to put in my  vanilla yogurt (I sub for sour cream) and after ten minutes in the oven,  I quickly swirled in my yogurt.  It came out very moist and all my coworkers loved it.  From then on, I waited until ten minutes in the oven and swirled in the yogurt, yummy!  A good mistake lol

Very good, fluffy banana cake. I did use half cup of pancake mix as suggested by another reviewer. It was my first cake in my new bundt pan. It stuck a bit, I think where there were chunks of banana...I sliced one and mashed the other two. Next time I'll mash them all, and add some cinnamon. I also see chocolate chips in the future.

Delicious banana cake recipe. I used three super ripe bananas (brown). I added a teaspoon of vanilla and 1/2 cup of mini-chocolate chips. The recipe didn't need the addition of the chocolate chips, I simply love chocolate with bananas. Easy cake to prepare. Baked for 60 minutes and cooled in pan for 10 minutes. Great recipe!

I made this today it is great.  I swapped out 1/2 cup of white sugar with brown sugar, added chopped walnuts, salt , vanilla, and baking powder.  Sprinkled crystal sugar  at the bottom of a greased bundt pan.  My oven is hot next time I will take it out a few minutes sooner.

This makes such an interesting cake:  it is soooooooo moist. I love it!  The banana flavor is amazing, rendering any spices unnecessary. I used plain nonfat yogurt instead of sour cream, and it was delicious.

I added 1 tsp. Vanilla, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and a pinch of salt. This cake was so darn good I will make it again I love the sliced bananas. Next time I think I will decrease the sugar by 1/2 cup. My husband loved this cake and thought the sweetness was just fine. The cake is moist and full of flavor. The cake took only 45 minutes to bake @ 350 degrees. My cake taster came out nice and clean, so check at this time so it does not dry out.

SO INCREDIBLY DELICIOUS!! I put 4 bananas and subbed the sour cream for Greek yogurt and added 1 tsp of vanilla. Baked for the full 60 min. very dense and moist from the chunks of bananas. Disappeared in a few hours and am making another one!! No icing or sugar necessary, but I did try it with powdered sugar on top and it was delicious.

It was super good. I did add two extra bananas because the were just laying around and about half an orange's zest. I did put a glaze on it. This will be a recipe I will use again.

This was a very moist banana cake. I had a bunch of bananas so I decided to use them up. This recipe lacks salt. I added some but will definitely add more next time ( maybe about 1 to 1 1/2 teaspoons) over all it was pretty good and with a few changes it could be very good.

I thought it was delicious and so did my co-workers. Slicing the bananas instead of mashing them makes a big difference. Mine was done in less than an hour though so keep an eye on it!

This cake is a keeper. Very forgiving.  I didn't have as much sour cream as I thought, so used vanilla yogurt to top up the quantity. (about half a cup) The butter was too cold and refused to be whipped into "light and fluffy." I mean, who wants to be light and fluffy on a day like today, I ask you? Plus I added the baking soda with the flour instead of with the sour cream. Cuz I'm a rebel. Took exactly the hour in the bundt pan.

I made this cake following the recipe exactly, except that I baked it in a 9 x 12 pan instead of a Bundt pan - it took probably 35-40 minutes to bake. I frosted it with a cream cheese icing (8 oz cream cheese, 1 stick butter, 1 pound powdered sugar, 2 T. milk, 1 tsp vanilla) and topped it with toasted pecans. It was a big hit at Book Club! I'll surely make this again, it's easy and delicious!

the best banana cake ever!
I did add a tsp of good vanilla just because I love vanilla
My picky husband has eaten nearly 1/2 the cake
Will definitely make this again and again and again
Will use  one cup of sugar v. One & a half cups... The bananas are sweet enough

Wow! This cake was super moist and delicious! I paired it with a peanut butter frosting recipe I found here as well. Perfect combination! Thanks so much, Gramma Bertha!

only changed from 1-1/2 cup to 1-1/4 cups sugar; added 1/4 t salt, 1 t vanilla, 1/2 cup chopped walnuts.
It's perfect without icing.
Thanks for the great recipe!

Cut recipe in half. Still made at least 6 servings. Added vanilla and salt and cut the sugar by a third of the amount called for. Topped with caramel frosting.  Baked in a 7X11 pan which was too big because it was too flat. May try a small bundt pan next time or bread pan. Topped with the icing while still warm - this may have contributed to the flatness. Will try icing it when cooled next time. Doesn't necessarily need icing. But caramel with banana cake is yummy! Very moist. At this point still searching for a more fluffy cake-like banana cake that is not as dense as banana bread.

This is a winner! Moist. Light and just plain awesome! This recipe is prob good as is but I can't leave well enough alone, so I made a few tweaks. In place of the sour cream I used plain Greek yogurt to save fat and calories. Added cinnamon and vanilla as well as 1/2 tsp baking powder. Next time I'll prob add chocolate chips (gotta replace that saved fat. lol!) Overall, great recipe and will prob be my new "go to."

This recipe did not work for me.  I followed the recipe exactly except I mashed the bananas ( my family doesn't care for eating whole bananas in baked goods).  The cake came out high and very spongy to the touch.  I came back in 5 minutes and the entire cake had sunken in.  It was raw-like on the inside and crunchy on the outside.

I've got to say, I was really looking forward to eating this cake. To say it is rich is a understatement because it is also very dense. This is more like a bread than cake. It was too sweet for most of us with icing (it was a birthday cake), but a few of us were able to eat a big piece of it. If you are looking for a moist, less dense (more cake-like) banana cake then this is not your recipe.

I thought yeah this is just another banana bread without the nuts, but wow I was wrong, it is  wonderful and not a bread but a moist sweet cake.  I didn't slice the bananas I diced them and left some nice big chucks, you knew you were eating a banana cake. I added a teaspoon of vanilla flavor gave it a kick.  I LOVE IT !!! p.s. Next time I may add walnuts :-)

This is a very true "cake" -- did not cross into banana bread territory at all. I had VERY ripe and sweet bananas, and I still used the full amount of sugar and I think that was a good call. The sweetness really makes it a proper cake. My bananas were also so ripe that they didn't really slice so much as mash themselves as I mixed the batter. As I was baking mine, we had a power outage, so it had a bit of a rough baking experience but still managed to come out perfectly done and still a bit fluffy. I'm sure baking it properly would result in an even fluffier cake, though, as I took about a minute after adding all the eggs to beat the mixture until it got really fluffy. I ended up using some leftover frosting from a layer cake on this, but I put the frosting (straight from the fridge) on the still-warm cake and once it softened a bit I spread it out more evenly. The heat from the cake make it drip down the sides and it looked very pretty; I added some rainbow sprinkles just before the icing started to harden up. I think this would be a good recipe to use for a layer cake as well -- will definitely try that next! Great recipe!

This cake is awesome. It is the best banana cake I have made. I needed to use up ripening bananas so,I made this recipe exactly as written and put in in the freezer. I served it to 10 people and received many compliments and several requested the recipe. I did not frost it but some enjoyed it with a scoop of ice cream. I will definitely make this again and again.

Ok, I did make a few changes to the basic recipe, a few tweaks as other reviewers mentioned, added; 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips, 1 teaspoon vanilla, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon baking powder.  I didn't have a cup of sour cream, so added what I had, maybe a 1/4 cup sour cream plus 3 extra over ripe bananas.  It came out MOIST, DELICIOUS, everyone in the family loved it, will keep this recipe for next time I have over ripe bananas. It was a mix between banana bread and a cake, leans more towards the cake side, don't be afraid to try this recipe, it's very, very good, enjoy.
Watch the cooking time closely, my cake was done at the 45 minute mark

Made this cake - had some bananas I needed to use and my Moms name was Bertha, she passed away last July 4.  Very moist, easy to make. My family loved it. I did not use any topping, was great with out it.  Would be great hot with butter pecan ice cream on it.  Will make again and keep as a family recipe in memory of my Mom.

I give it four stars with the following adjustments: I used more bananas and next time will bake it for less time.  After 55 minutes, it was overbaked and had formed a dark crust.  In the future, I'll check it at 45 minutes and keep an eye on it thereafter.  However, it IS a good recipe and we enjoyed it without frosting of any kind.

This scratch banana cake is a very good, basic starting-point recipe to leave as-is, or build upon for more intense flavor & texture w/additions: vanilla extract, nuts, cinnamon/spices, choc or cinnamon chips, streusel, etc. As another reviewer suggested, swapping sour cream w/yogurt & cutting back on sugar is healthier & undetectable w/this cake (I personally swapped & it was very good/moist!) My family enjoyed it; either way, it's good as-is, or opt to flexibly customize to one's personal preference. A truly good, withstanding recipe can deliciously adapt & welcome change, if desired. YUM & thanks again for the recipe to utilize always-browning-too-fast bananas!

I made this for Thanksgiving, because I wanted something different.  Very good.  Mine was done in a electric roaster, so it took longer than the one hour, but it was certainly worth the wait.  Cream cheese frosting worked great.  Absolutely will make this again.

I believe that this reciepe is superior because you DON'T MASH THE BANANAS....just slice and throw in the mixer.  I can't believe I haven't rated this recipe yet!!  It is a FABULOUS cake and I have made it over and over again, and given the recipe away many times.  I always ice it with CREAM CHEESE FROSTING II (by Janni....not JJ....there are two recipes with the same title) from this site.  Always a hit!

Delicious! Almost like a pound cake. I added a tsp. of vanilla and used 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1 cup white sugar, so it cut down on the sweetness a bit which is fine. I used real sour cream because I wanted to make sure this turned out really good! It was sinful, I drizzled the cooled cake with a homemade cream cheese glaze (4 oz. cream cheese, 2 tbsp. butter, 2 cups powdered sugar, half & half as needed to thin it out). I will be making this again for SURE! Absolutely tasty and comfort food-ish.

My bf really liked this.  I made it in two 9-inch rounds.  The centers didn't cook as well as i'd prefer, which is probaby why the recipe recommends a bundt pan.  I screwed up at first...I forgot to put flour in the batter!!  I cooked it for ten min before I realized it, scooped the batter back in a bowl, added flour and recooked it.  That also could have contributed to the soggy center.  =)  Fortunately, even with the huge mistake, my bf loved it.  lol

This was so go I had to send it to work with my husband as not to gain 5 pounds, I did healthy it up a bit. Cut sugar by 1/4 cup, used 1/2 cup unsweetened yogurt and 1/2 cup light sour cream instead of the 1 cup sour cream and substituted 1/4 cup of the flour as whole wheat flour.  It didnt have to back the full hour with these changes about 54 minutes.  topped it with a light cream cheese glaze. YUM

While the flavor of this is good, it too closely resembles a bread. My husband asked why I frosted the banana "bread". Will just stick to my old banana bread recipe.

This was just what I was looking for!  I did make some simple modifications based on suggestions from other readers and added some cinnamon and vanilla.  Since I wanted a strong banana flavor, I added 2 extra bananas that I cut into thicker slices and folded in.  Frosted with banana cream cheese frosting and it was a great birthday cake for a banana-bread loving husband!

Didn't have any sour cream, so I added 1/4 cup of heavy cream instead.  Thus, it's my fault that this came out more like a dense banana bread than a cake.  Will try again when I get some sour cream.  Made the whole house smell wonderful!

Excellent banana flavor!  I added an extra banana because I had it and didn't want to toss it out, but it was probably a mistake; cake was too heavy and dense.  Next time (and I will make this again because of the distinct banana flavor) I'll follow the directions!

I made this for my 1 year old's birthday party and everyone loved it!  I followed the recipe and added sour cream frosting.

Wow!!!  A great and EASY recipe from scratch!  I added a little bit of chocolate chips and it was yummy.  Next time, I think I'll try it with a little less sugar.  Thanks for sharing!!!!

Banana cake?  You mean 3 tonne cake; WOW was this dense.  Taste  is great and luckily I read other reviews before making it so I expected something heavy.  Not sure if it will be made again or not.  Maybe this will improve after it has aged.

Haven't decided if this should be classified cake or bread - but it is great!  I used 1/2 white flour and 1/2 whole wheat flour
