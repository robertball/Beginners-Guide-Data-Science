This is not a liqueur in any sense of the word, simply ginger and brandy flavored sweetener. I don't blend the ginger after slicing it, but put it in a jar with the brandy, orange juice, and vanilla. I steep it for a 3-4 weeks , then strain the solids out. Place back in the rinsed out jar. I then make a syrup with the water and sugar, cool it completely, and add to the jar. Stir, and age at least a month.
