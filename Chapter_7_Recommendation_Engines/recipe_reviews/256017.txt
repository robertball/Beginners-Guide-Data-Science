This was a delicious dish!!! The only thing I changed was I swapped out the cucumber for celery and zucchini-much better veggies for roasting. Regardless, we will be having this dish again!

We’ve eaten this the last 5 nights....by choice. I leave the Romaine out, and just do the sliced steak, and veggies in a flatbread topped with feta! Everybody I have made it for is crazy about it

I will make this again... it was great!  I followed the recipe at listed, but did use 2 small pickling cukes instead of English cucumbers.  The roasted vegetables were delicious and the season was just right.  My wife loved it.

You don't think it works, but then it works with the roasting of the odd ball veggies. I stayed true to the recipe and enjoyed a great warm salad.

I've made this several times with venison and have even made the cooked vegetables by themselves. Who knew you could cook cucumbers?

Used canned diced tomatoes with peppers and onions - easy for a wintertime preparation.  Made it rare 125 degrees and it was fabulous.   Served with ancient grains (Trader Joe's proprietary mix of couscous, orzo, garbanzo beans and red quinoa cooked in chicken stock sprinkled with fresh cut flat leaf parsley) instead of romaine.   Will definitely make again. Double yum!!

Kids loved it. I also roasted potatoes to stretch out a family of 6 appetite.

I made this with chicken breasts and added some parsnips and yellow squash to the mix. I also cooked the chicken on the stove while the veggies roasted, as I couldn’t quite bring myself to put raw chicken on the vegetables. It all turned out wonderfully with very little left over.

The marinade as written in the recipe made only one-half cup, so it was impossible to reserve 1/2 cup for the vegetables. I had to make the marinade again -- and double it this time to ensure enough for baking and dipping. The recipe really needs at least TRIPLE the amount of marinade called for and probably, as one reviewer noted, quadruple the amount. My flank steak is still marinating so I haven't made the recipe yet; I just wanted to note the problem with the marinade. I look forward to enjoying the meal with my partner. The five stars is for the recipe. OK: I made the flank steak and it was AWESOME! I marinated it overnight. My husband ate every bite and even loved the vegetables (a first. he's meat and potatoes guy). This is so full of flavor, and the vegetables on top of the romaine lettuce makes for such interesting textures. A truly wonderful recipe. Thank you! It's a keeper.

Hubbs and I really, really enjoyed this meal.  I stuck true to the recipe, except I doubled the marinade.  Next time, I'll quadruple it, because we served it with crusty french bread, and it would've been nice to have more juices to sop up!  Also, we used Basmati rice instead of romaine as the base.  I will say, the meal was absolutely delicious!  I prepped the veggies and marinade the night before, and threw the meat in with the marinade before heading to work.  It just worked out beautifully.  Hats off Molly ... this is a real winner!

Ok I must admit that I thought the cooked greek salad sounded weird but it was so tasty and heated up just fine as left overs.  Easy to make and clean up.

The verdict is my family didn't like hot meat/veggies/dressing on cold lettuce leaves. They liked it better as a salad the next day, when the leftovers were cold. This is definitely one to make again, but next time, I'll serve it hot over rice instead of over lettuce.

My fiancé and I loved this. This is the second time I've made this. This time, I used half thur meat, half the marinade, and the full amount of veggies. Perfect! I also skipped the romaine, and just served it up with the vegetables as is, with lots of parsley and feta on top. Delicious!

Excellent!  Will definitely make again.  Very flavorful.  Just did meat and veggies, no romaine salad.  I used a steak labelled "London Broil" because it was cheaper than the one labelled "flank steak".  I might make more marinade next time so the steak gets a little bit more.

Like a lot of previous reviewers, I was skeptical about this one. Like most of those people, I was pleasantly surprised. Based on everything in my experience, this shouldn’t work. But it does.
One thing I noticed as soon as I turned the veggies out on the sheet pan was that this makes a LOT of food, so good thing it turned out good.
We’ll be doing this again for sure, possibly with some variations, but it’s a keeper.

This is really good, but I would prefer to eat it not as a salad!

This is SO good, and easy to do.  The grilled veggies are amazing with the beef.  I served it as a beef/veggie dish (no lettuce), and added parmesan cheese rather than feta, since no one at our home likes feta.  It was a total hit.  I look forward to preparing this again!
