Wow!  These turned out very tender and delicious!  It's very close to what my daughter had a few weeks ago at our new favorite Mexican joint. This will definitely be in with our taco collection.  The only ingredient that I couldn't fully use was the cinnamon!  I only used half of it.  I also used a thin cut pork chop (with a little fat) so that way I don't have to do any cutting before throwing it in the marinade.  Slice or roughly dice it after grilling.

Tacos al pastor is one of my favorites so I used this pretty much just for the meat part of the recipe. I setup toppings for the tacos and we topped them to our own tastes. The pork was really delicious and very tender (I marinated it overnight). Even my two year old loved it; she does like things a little spicer than average though. I will absolutely make these again and I'm looking forward to the leftovers!

Didn't have chile peppers, so used some fresh jalapenos, and cooked it in a cast iron skillet on the stove with some chunks of pineapple.  Great recipe!

This was delicious. My husband loved it too and we're having leftovers tonight. I had to leave out cayenne for health reasons but that was the only change I made.

These were excellent! I couldn’t find the appropriate peppers so I did two fresh jalapeños. I took a bit of the marinade out before mixing with the raw pork and heat until bubbling to mix with the pork after cooked. My bbq isn’t out yet so I did  them in the oven on broil, turning once.

This is now my go-to recipe for al pastor. You can change it up by varying the types of dry chile pods. I like to add Ancho to mine. Be sure to cut the tops of the pods off and empty out seeds before soaking.

I was suprised how flavorless this was. Personally, I think it was in the method, not the ingredients. If I ever make this in the future, I'd use mush smaller pieces and saute vice using the grill.

I have never, to date, disliked anything Chef John puts out. This is the exception. I used New Mexico Hatch Chili Peppers, marinated this for two days, but the pork was entirely too  tough. The flavor was sadly lacking, I needed to add so many spices and flavors to make it edible that I may as well not have marinated it at all. Sorry, Chef John, but you're still my hero!
