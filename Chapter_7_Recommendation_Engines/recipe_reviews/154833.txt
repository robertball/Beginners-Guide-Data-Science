This just tastes like a great big ol' bowl of autumn.  So, so, so good.  I did make one change to the recipe in that I used ham base rather than chicken base, but other than that I followed to a T.  I'm not a big fan of allspice, but once the soup had a chance for all the flavors to meld, it was perfect.  

I served with little pieces of toasted french bread with parmesan cheese broiled on the toast.   Take a chance on a new recipe, I don't think you'll be disappointed with this one.

Made some changes, based on other reviews and a desire to combine this with other root vegetable soup recipes.  Roasted the parsnips and one large carrot along with four turnips, one onion and one celery root.  Sprinkled first with herbes de provence, along with the oil, salt and pepper.  Sauteed a carrot or two and about six cloves of garlic along with the onion and celery, and used half and half instead of the milk and cream.  Definitely took additional stock to thin it sufficiently.  Finally, seasoned with the ginger and nutmeg, and added some ground cumin and a few squeezes of lemon.  Left out the sugar and other spices.  Garnished with snipped chives.  Altogether, really complex and delicious, not at all bland.  You can really taste the vegetables.  Worth investing in all that produce!

Definitely my fave soup recipe of the season so far. I omit the brown sugar and the allspice, and I sometimes throw in some cubed leftover baked potatoes to the puree stage (just use my good old immersion stick blender.) So delicious! Thanks, Alan!

This was a nice, thick, hearty soup. I made this at Christmas time for some friends and it was just perfect! I will definitely be making this again.

EXCELLENT TASTE!  Way too thick, though.  I had to add almost 3 more cups of broth (I used half chicken broth, half vegetable stock) to get it to the consistency of a soup instead of a baby-foodish thickness.  But that's fine, now I know that and I'll be making this regularly from now on!  Bring on the CSA parsnips that I never knew what to do with until now!

Wow was this good! Easily as good as what you'd pay a lot for at a nice restaurant. I woke up at 3am and couldn't stop thinking about this in my fridge so I got up and had some. I followed the directions exactly - perfect.

I added halibut to this recipe and it turned out amazing.  My husband LOVED it but says he will only eat it Oct-Dec.  Go figure!  I did the following to it:  Cooked only 1/2-2/3 of the total veggies in the soup but used actually 5 cups chicken stock, 1-1.5 lb halibut cubed/deboned/skinned (my hubby caught it in Canada).  I took the entire spice mixture and put half-2/3 into the simmering veggies as the recipe says to, then the other half I sprinkled over the cubed fish, which I added last to prevent the fish from being too rubbery.  DELICIOUS!  Serve with buttered/garlic salted bagguette bread toasted in the over.

I made the recipe just as written.  It was so wonderful! I wouldn't change a thing. It is a great soup that reminds me of fall with the various spices in it.  Thanks!

An exceptional soup with unique flavors, and highly nutritious. Made no alterations whatsoever and the spice combination was perfect. The aroma and flavor brings memories of a Thanksgiving or Christmas meal but this soup is great anytime of the year. Alan, both of your published recipes are awesome.

this was my first round with the parsnip, which i learned is somewhere between a carrot and a potato -- success!  i actually almost decided to just eat the roasted ones off the pan.  but i made this almost exactly as written (used all 1% milk and no cadamom so substituted allspice) -- PERFECT for a cold day with a little kick.  didn't have to add any water like other reviewers said, but i have a pretty powerful pulverizing blender.  hope there are more parsnips in my future!

Nice creamy soup. I did add more broth & garlic as noted by other reviewers. One out of three kids liked it & the four adults loved it.
 I will make this again. Thanks.

This recipe is delicious! I am sick of roasted vegetables, as we keep getting more every other week from our farm share. This was a great way to use root veggies in a different way. I confess, the spices scared me a little. But really, this soup has a great flavor!

If you love Parsnips like I do you will really enjoy this soup. It is full of flavor and really creamy. it does have a bit of a kick which I love but if you prefer less heat I would only add 1/2 tsp ginger. Off for another bowl yummy :)

Yum! This took me a while but with fresh from my garden parsnips came out delicious. It was a bit thick for my liking so I added some extra milk & water to loosen it up a bit - but the taste was perfect!

4.5 stars.....really good! I wanted to try parsnips as I've never had them and this was a GREAT recipe to try.  Has a bit of a bite of heat at the end so you may want to add a drizzle of some heavy cream onto the top of each bowl before serving, it'll help tame the heat a bit. If all parsnips are this good, count me in!

Great recipe. I didn't have cream, and I realized this rather late into the game.  I just used 2% milk, and it was excellent.  I served it with some fresh bread and white wine.  I can't wait to make this for my British step-father. He loves parsnips!

While not the most attractive-looking soup, the flavor is phenomenal.  I have to agree with the others who mentioned it was a little bit too thick, but that is an easy fix with more stock.  Just as a personal preference, I increased the garlic and halved the cayenne.  Yum.

So rich and tasteful. I actually omitted the milk and cream and left it as is. The taste was super rich so next time I will probably make more veggies and use the same spices or cut back on the spices.

So happy I found this recipe! The soup is amazing. To me it's a definite comfort food. I added a bit more half and half, but other than that stuck to the recipe. This type of soup, as I've had it, is pretty thick. If you prefer thin broth based soup, this won't be for you. This is a meal in itself with some crispy french bread!

Wow! I'd never roasted veg before and it was so easy and tasty! What a great use for parsnips. And the spices are perfect! I didn't have cardamom or cream, but used the other spices and whole milk and it tastes great all the same. Also used roasted garlic scapes instead of regular garlic. Nice dark brown carmelization. Thanks!

This has made my house smell SOO good. The spices are so nice. It has just the right amount of kick from the cayenne. I used parsnips that I had blanched and frozen from garden and they worked out just fine roasting them. Mmmmmm! I highly recommend this very easy sophisticated soup!

Really satisfying, great depth of flavors and a wonderful creamy texture. I've made this twice now and in the second batch reduced the cayenne by half as I found the first batch too spicy (perhaps I was heavy handed!). I used purple carrots from my CSA on the second batch at it came out a wonderful plum color - gorgeous!

I did not have cardamom, allspice and cayenne. I also used fresh ginger instead of ground. I garnished with slivers of ginger. This soup smells amazing and tastes even better. A nice change.

Yummy, low calorie alternative to most creamy soups. Like most of the reviewers, I omitted the brown sugar.  I also added Gruyere cheese on top just before serving.  The tangy cheese was a nice complement to the hearty flavors!

Very flavourful soup. I used all the spices listed and really liked the blend. However I used about 9 cups of broth instead of 4. Otherwise it's way to thick. I will keep this in my soup rotation

I made this one and kept to the recipe with the exception of the steps. I'm on a quest to reduce cleanup so I roasted everything in olive oil and went right to the blender with good results. If I were to make this again I would reduce or cut out entirely the cardamom. I am a fan of the spice but in this case I found it overwhelming and I can't really taste the vegetables.

Very nice soup, can be a little too rich with the heavy cream so use that wisely. I had to make it vegan using soy milk and coconut cream (cans in the Asian foods section).  One important add was a dollop of sour cream as a garnish - goes a long way to cut down the richness

This is a wonderful root soup, very earthy and warm.  I was given some parsnips and was looking for something other than mashed form and found this. By the way, this was the first time I've had them.  I stuck right with the recipe like I always try to do the first time for a true rating.  I did have one small sub which I'll mention later.  The only reason I didn't give a 5 was because of the cayenne pepper. Due to the comments I only used about 3/4 of what it called for and even that I thought took away from the true flavor of the roots.  Next time I will cut to only using half of what is called for or even leave out.  I didn't have any cardamon so I subbed with what I found on the internet. 1/2 cinnamon and 1/2 nutmeg. I didn't want to bring out the blender so I just used my hand mixer right in the pan.  It all worked well.

I made this soup but I just baked the carrots, parsnip, and celery together. I added curry instead of cardamom and I only added 1/4 teaspoon if it. I also added chopped up ham and poured it over rice. AMAZING! My husband and I loved it ! We will so be making this again.

I didn't have enough parsnips - only about a pound, so I adjusted the spices and the amount of chicken broth, milk and cream.  

Next time I'll keep the same amount of cream.

amazing soup, great flavors - definitely a keeper.

I made a vegan version by using 1 cup of coconut milk instead of 1 cup milk + 1/2 cup cream... and vegetable stock instead of chicken!

I didn't know this but parsnips have a core in them that makes the soup bitter . So I made the soup as written and  it was really bad. I'll try again next month

Deliciously spicy (added a little extra cayenne) and sweet (from carrots, caramelized onions and brown sugar). I used what I had on hand... 1 1/2 lbs of parsnips (not 2 lbs). I compensated by adding an extra carrot. I left out allspice (not a fan), cardamom and heavy cream (never heard of cardamom and didn't have heavy cream). I ended up using 6 cups of chicken stock and 1 1/4 cups of milk. I added a dollop of sour cream to my bowl and it was delish! I could also see adding freshly grated sharp cheddar cheese! :) Enjoy you creation!!!

Variety of reviews from my family,  I made it exactly as the recipe was.  I personally really liked it.  My husband said it was ok except for the weird spice (probably the cardamom). My daughter said it was not her favourite but wouldn't want to eat it again, and my son, well let's not get into that!  But if you don't have fussy pants for family members I would recommend it.

Fresh ginger (thumb sized) instead of dried. Dice it in the food processor along with the garlic. Instead of milk and cream I used a cup of soaked raw cashews blended with the water I soaked them in. I like dairy but sometimes it's nice to mix it up. Delicious!
