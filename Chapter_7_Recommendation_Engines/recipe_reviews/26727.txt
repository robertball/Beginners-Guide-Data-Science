One thing I did is instead of 1 spoonful of mayonaise I substitute sour cream and found that alot less messy and for those who dont like the mayo it is much better. Other than that. Fantabulous!! Thanks

This is delicious!  Really good and I think the lemon juice and little bit of mayo added some nice subtle flavors.  Everyone loved it at Christmas.  I rolled it in some chopped up parsley, put it on a nice plate, and it was very pretty.

I took this to a party and everybody loved it! This recipe is delicious!! The only change I made to the recipe was I added some onion powder and I rolled my cheese ball in chopped pecans. If you like green olives then this is the cheese ball for you-- Super!!

I'm a huge olive lover but unfortunately, the friends I roll with aren't! To please the masses, I have taken to substituting the olives for half a 250ml jar of (chopped) Old El Paso pickled jalapenos and it's an absolute hit every time I make it! It's got quite the kick, but people REALLY love it. I've made this at least 25 times now and I have to say that using old or sharp cheddar is a MUST, as is serving with original Ritz crackers. Try this recipe and it WILL be requested by all who eat it - especially if they like it hot!

Be sure to give this cheese ball enough time in the fridge for the flavors to come together! The texture is a little chunky, as another reviewer mentioned, but I added extra ingredients, so I can't say for sure if the original recipe would be as chunky. I didn't have any fresh onion on hand, so I had to use onion powder, but I added in some diced sundried tomatoes in olive oil. I think this really brought some beautiful color, as well as an extra dimension of smooth/salty flavor to the recipe.

I make this often for church functions and it is always a hit.  I serve it as a spread rather than a "ball".  I love the recipe the way it is - but I had some freshly made horseraddish and decided to add 1 T.  Wow - it really kicked it up a notch!  (I also used dried chopped onions - 1 T - instead of the chopped onion.  They also worked well.)

Very good.  Not sure what 'lemon juice concentrate' is.  I used 1T RealLemon bottled lemon juice, but it's not a concentrate.  Thanks for the recipe!

If you like olives, you'll love this cheese ball.  When I described it to people, they were hesitant to try it, but ended up devouring it.  I didn't even have time to roll it in anything - I just molded it in a dome shape on a platter and surrounded it with crackers.  This recipe is a keeper!  Thanks!!

Everyone loved this cheese ball!  I made two changes, I used onion powder as suggested by others, and I replaced the green olives with approximately 6 slices of bacon chopped finely.  What doesn't taste better with bacon?

Good flavor and i took the suggestion from other reviewers to add sour cream instead of mayonaise.  I shredded the onions and added garlic powder.

I had this as an appetizer for Thanksgiving.  I substituted sour cream instead of mayo and rolled the cheeseball in crumbled bacon. The whole cheese ball was gobbled up. My sister said she'd rather eat it instead of dinner!

My cousin recently got me hooked on olive cheese dip so I wanted to find a recipe to make my own. OMG! I couldn't stay out of this.  It was that good! I shared it with her and it was a hit! If you like olives, you'll love this! It tastes best if refrigerated overnight to give the flavors time to meld. Even though my cream cheese was fully softened when I stirred it up it wasn't as smooth as I would have liked so I used my stick blender to get the consistency it needed before adding the remaining ingredients. Worked perfectly.  I only used about three tablespoons of the onion I chopped up very finely and thought it was going to be a bit much when I first tasted but once the flavors blended it was perfect. I finely shredded a block of sharp cheddar cheese instead of using prepackaged cheese and used fresh lemon. Delicious!

I followed this recipe exactly, except for the mayonnaise.  My husband doesn't like it, so I just left it out.  It was still a delicious cheese ball.  I rolled it in parsley and brought one to work and sent another to my husband's work.  Everyone loved them!

My cheese ball was clumpy.  It tastes ok, but when I think of cheese balls, I think the inside creamy, complex flavors, and crunchy outside.  This one just didn't impress me.  Hope I'm not becoming a snob.

This was a great recipe. I used green onions instead of regular, and left out the green olives. Excellent mild flavor!

This is very good and oh so easy.  I like to fine dice the olives.  I used green onion, and did add some real bacon bits, as well as a few dashes of Worseshire.  Don't skip the lemon juice, as it really brightens it up.    Rolled it i toasted walnuts for an extra crunch texture and taste.  Toasting the nuts first gives them a nice flavor.  I would suggest rinsing the olives first, as they are brined and the salt in the olives could be a bit much with the salt in the cheese.  Thanks for this super duper easy recipe with a nice taste!  Makes a good sized amount too.

I love salt and olives so it was fine for me but I felt it was a little too salty for my guests at a recent party.  Maybe cutting down the amount of olives would have been better.

Love this recipe, but I changed it up a little.  
I used chopped black olives, and thinly sliced red onions.  I also added chopped gherkin pickles and 1 teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce and I didn't skimp on the lemon juice either.

I love green olives so this was a no brainer for me, but rather than using mayonnaise, I used unsalted butter.  I also added 1 tsp white pepper to try to give it a little zip. and did roll it in toasted pecan pieces.  I took it to a party and it was a real hit.

Came out great!  I added a little dill and chives.  Could not stop eating it, and I'm not a big olive fan.

I took this to a Christmas party and was very nervous as I followed the recipe exactly and with the green olive thought for sure no one would like it.  Everyone loved it!

A real crowd pleaser, but take out of fridge about an hour ahead or it is too hard. And use strong crackers, because even with a knife people will try to shave off with the cracker. I put a holder in the top so people could hold on while they are serving themselves.  Will make again.

I use this recipe all the time! It's so easy and tasty! I use equal amounts of onion and olives but I love onions. Yummy five stars for sure!

I always make this cheeseball. Taste great. Sometimes I mix some pepper jack cheese for added kick. I also roll cheeseball in walnuts and serve with crackers

This was excellent.  I spread mine in a bowl and served it on garlic crackers.  It was the perfect combination and I'm thinking I may add half a teaspoon of garlic powder to the recipe.  I didn't think it was clumpy at all, but if you want it to be very smooth you could always put it into a food processor and then stir in the olives.

I have been making this cheese ball for years now....because the first time I made it....Everyone Raved! Even kids! Now I am asked to bring it to every event possible! I actually lost the recipe for a few months and panicked...but found it once again..on my favorite recipe site. Allrecipes.com. I should have known! This is a "no-fail" recipe. And very versatile as well! Thank You Cindy! What a fantastic recipe!

Delicious! I had to use black olives because that was all I had on hand, and it was a hit. I'm sure it's just as good with the green olives. Thank you!

I personally found this a little dry, although my boyfriend loved it. The flavor was good though.
