I moderated the proportions of ingredients somewhat but the combination of flavors is 5 star tasty!  First of all there seemed to be too much liquid in the recipe for a 2 quart casserole, and I found that 1 can of soup and 1/2 cup of chicken broth were perfect for us.  I also cut the shredded cheese to one cup and mixed half with the other ingredients and sprinkled the rest on top. Also, due to preference/laziness I cut the asparagus into bite size pieces and mixed the ingredients (except for the onions) rather than layered them.  Still, I want to emphasize that we loved the casserole, and will make regularly.   Thanks!

This was really good! A better version of green bean casserole. Next time I think I'm going to cut the asparagus spears to the same length of the green beans.

My husband and I liked it, the kids were uncertain, but ate it anyway.  I think that the crackers are not necessary really and I would chop the asparagus up a bit before steaming them, so the casserole is a little easier to serve and eat.  Overall, a yummy casserole and inventive.

I omitted the ham because I was using this as a side dish, & halved the soup & cheese, plus I mixed everything together, rather than layering(topped w/the fried onions). It was VERY good! It does remind me of green bean casserole, but has more of the asparagus flavor & texture.

This was easy and delicious. I would also recommend cutting up the asparagus before putting in bottom of dish.

I'm trying to cut some fat/calories from my diet, so I cut the soup/broth mixture by half and didn't add cheese. I also used crushed potato chips in place of the onions. It was really good!

Too soupy for my taste, but the flavors were great. Made as recipe states, so I would probably cut the chicken broth in half or reduce the soup.

This was great. Very nice combo. I think it would be wonderful as a pot pie in pie crust shells...just mix everything, pour into a crust and top with another crust. I'll try that next time.
