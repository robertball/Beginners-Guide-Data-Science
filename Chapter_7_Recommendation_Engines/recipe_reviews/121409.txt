This was amazing! I took it to a family gathering and everyone enjoyed it. I didn't peel the potatoes, I think the red skin adds a beautiful color. I just cubed them and then boiled them. For simplicity, while the potatoes were cooking I mixed the rest of the ingredients in one bowl, including most of the blue cheese. I tossed the potatoes with the mixture when they were still a little warm and then sprinkled with a little bit of blue cheese. I think adding the potatoes when they are still a little warm helps to bring out the flavors!

This was absolutely delicious and my family loved it. It was gone in no time! I too left the skin on the potatoes and cubed them before cooking, which worked out well. I then mixed all the ingredients together but the potatoes and a little bit of the blue cheese, then combined everything, and sprinkled the remaining blue cheee on the top. I thought it was a bit salty so I might reduce that next time, but overall this is a fabulous recipe!

If there were more stars, I would give it more! It's the best potato salad that I've ever had! The only thing that I did different is I mixed all the ingredients, except the potatoes, into the dressing. It was fabulous.

This was very good! I didn't bother peeling the potatoes. It makes it more colorful with the skins on.

This recipe got RAVES!!  My friend even asked if I'd make it for her as my "gift" when she had her baby. My husband's work also went crazy over it at a potluck.  I make the dressing while the potatoes are cooking, then peel them while still warm and mix the dressing with it at that time so the heat can draw the flavors into the potatoes better.  I've made this with gorganzola once and blue cheese the next time and both were super yummy.

I did a search for this recipe after trying some a friend had bought at a local deli. This recipe is possibly better. (I think its the sour cream.)I followed the recipe exactly except that I didn't peel the potatoes and I added about 5 slices of crumbled bacon. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!! I've already passed it along to a few of my friends.

Love this recipe! I don't use anything light, but that was all I changed in the ingredients.  I left the skins on the potatoes, cubed them, then cooked them until just BEFORE they turned fork tender then took them out, dried them and fried them in a little bacon grease until tender and they just had a little crust.  Everything else was the same.  My family LOVED this!!!!

This was the best potato salad Ive ever made. I kept the skin on like other reviewers mentioned and fried up 5 strips of bacon, crumbled it and added it to the salad as well. The bacon added a nice touch and blended well with the flavours.

Very tasty, exceptionally unique potato salad recipe.  The only reason for 4 stars is that the blue cheese is a bit overpowering.  I would recommend using about half of what the recipe calls for and will do that myself the next time I make it.  Definately worth trying if you like to change things up a bit!  Thanks so much for the post.

This was great!  I added in my celery and some red onion to go with the scallions to give it more crunch.  I also increased the vinegar to two tablespoons.  Next time, I will probably keep the skins on to give it more color.

This was a great alternative to a normal potato salad and even my 3 year old enjoyed it!

I didn't have red potatoes so I had to use white ones, I did peel them before cubing them and then cooking them and I used white balsamic vinegar rather than white whine vinegar and it still tasted awesome. 

Definitely a keeper!

Absolutely loved this salad.  Boiled my potatoes whole (to avoid overcooked, mushy potato cubes); used Gorgonzola. I mixed the salad while the potatoes were slightly warm and served it room temperature. Served it to company and it was "double-dipped" by everyone at the table. This will be a "special regular" for me.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this for the 4th of July.  It's fabulous !  I used red wine vinegar instead of the white wine vinegar.  Like others, I also left the skins on and cubed them before boiling.  I added more mayo than sour cream (since that's what I had) and it turned out really, really good !

Hubby and I love this recipe!  Made it with the exact ingredients but did combine everything but the potatoes first, then added in the potatoes and a little blue cheese on top to finish.  2 year old loved it as well!

I made this for Father's day and people ate it, but I don't think they loved it.  No one asked to take home any leftovers, sure sign in my family that it didn't go over well. I added bacon and just thought it was alright.

I tried a salad we bought from a Deli called "Red White and Blue" potato salad and it was so delicious that I had to try to make it myself!  I added cooked and crumbled bacon to it and a little dill.  Both my husband and I thought that the blue cheese was strong when we first tasted this salad, but after a couple days in the fridge all the flavors melded together and it tasted better!

Everyone loved this when I took it to a cook out.  I used regular white vinegar instead of white wine vinegar.  It is a good alternative to the potato salad with hard cooked eggs.

My son and I loved a potato salad I bought at a local grocery deli called "Red, White, and Blue" potato salad and wanted to make it.  I think this recipe came very close.  Added some cooked crumbled bacon like the one purchased. Like others, leave skin on and cube potatoes before cooking.

This is THE best potato salad I have EVER tried!!!  I would definitely give it 10 stars!!  Now, I don't like celery and since I was the one making it I omitted the celery & celery seed and LOVED it!!!  :o)  I also mixed everything together (except the warm potatoes and a little of the blue cheese crumbles) and THEN I added the warm potatoes.  I sprinkled the remaining blue cheese crumbles on the top so everyone know what was in it.  LOVE this recipe, it is a keeper!!!

I didn't know if everyone would like the idea of blue cheese in the salad so I made one with, and one without for a party.  Everyone loved the blue cheese, it all went.  I had to take the one without and add blue cheese to it, it really makes a great flavor.

I made this for my son's birthday party. I made it the night before and tested it immediately. It was wonderful, especially warm. When I took it out of the refrigerator the next day, it was very watery and just didn't have any flavor. No one ate it! I will try making this again but will serve it immediately. I just hate it that it won't be good as leftovers.

This is the best Potato Salad.  I made it today for a picnic and it was a HUGE hit!  I am a big Blue Cheese fan, so I added more than suggested.  I also added 3 Tablespoons of Spicy Mustard...just to give it a little bit more.  I also used Regular Sour Cream and Mayonaise, not low fat.  It was wonderful.  My only warning is to not judge the dressing before you add the blue cheese crumbles.  If you taste the dressing it seems like it needs SOMETHING...but then you add the crumbles and mix it together and it is just right!!

Thank god I found this before the summer barbecue season! Now I have my go-to recipe for potato salad! I think the red potatoes were a nice touch, it made it different from other white potato salads. I added a little bit more blue cheese too and mixed it all together. My only other tip would be to use regular sour cream versus fat free. I used fat free, and I think the dressing came out a little thin. With the regular, I think it might stick to the potatoes a little bit better. :)

Delicious!  Everyone went crazy over this potato salad when I took it to a recent cook-out.  I too, left the skins on. And instead of dicing, I quartered them. (keeps them from 'mushing' when mixing the dressing in) Also I mixed in the blue cheese instead of sprinkling on top.

My friend made a potato salad that my family loved, but she doesn't follow a recipe so I only had the ingredients she used. I gave this 5 stars because this recipe was the closest I could find and I followed it somewhat for measurements. I cubed the potatoes before boiling them, and I used vidalia onion instead of green onion. I only used mayo since I didn't have sour cream, and I eliminated the parsley and celery seed and used dill since that was what my friend used. I also added some Hormel real bacon bits. My 7 and 8-year olds can't seem to get enough of this when I make it, and my husband who "doesn't like bleu cheese" raves about it.

Served to around 20 people and all comments were "great potato salad, Kim!". It was a huge hit.  I served the blue cheese on the side, as not all especially young children do not like blue cheese.  It was great without it and with it!

I made this receipe exactly as written and I liked it a lot, but unfortunately I don't think it was a hit.  One person had two helpings, but I don't think anyone else really liked it.  My boyfriend said that it was good "for potato salad" which is a high compliment from him, considering that he doesn't like potato salad.  I usually go for mustard potato salads, and I think I liked this one because of the vinegar, but I probably won't make it again since no one in my family seemed to enjoy it.  It's hard to find a potato salad recipe that everyone likes since potato salads are so different and taste-specific...that's what I told myself anyway.  :)

Love this! Left out the celery and added black olives. Also left out the sour cream and just added a little milk so it wasn't so dry.

This recipe puts a different spin on the traditional potato salad.  I liked it because I like blue cheese.  I also enjoyed how creamy the dressing was too.

Fantastic!  Lighter than normal potato salad - more refreshing. I also added more blue cheese.  Make it awhile ahead so the flavors will meld.  It was a complete hit when I fixed it for our 4th of July party.

I took this to a family potluck. Everyone raved about it. Several people asked for the recipe. I didn't have low fat sour cream or mayo so used regular. I will make this again. Oh, I also left the skins on.

A nice twist on traditional potato salad.  I scaled recipe for 4 and used gorgonzola instead of blue cheese, regular onion for green and omitted celery as I did not have any.  Next time, I'll be sure to add that to provide a little more color and crunch.  You have to really be a fan of blue/gorgonzola to like this.  I only added salt to taste.  I think I might like it with more mayo, but I'll hold out 'til tomorrow after it's been completely chilled.  Thanks for letting me try!

Ok, I just didn't get it.  It just felt like it was missing something.  Several of our guests really enjoyed it.  But, overall I'm not sure if I would try this again.

You better really like blue cheese.  We followed this recipe exactly, and found the blue cheese to be very overpowering.  We personally would not bring this dish to a gathering because it most likely would not appeal to a wide range of taste palettes.

My husband is picky about his potato salad, but I made this for Christmas Day lunch and he asks me to make it all the time now. I skipped the celery seed and blue cheese and also added some crumbled bacon and mustard, and it came out awesome

I didn't use the low-fat ingredients, maybe that is what made it taste so bad.  My husband didn't even like it.
