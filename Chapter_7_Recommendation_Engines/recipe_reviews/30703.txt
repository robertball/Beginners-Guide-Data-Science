Awesome marinade.  I made with a london broil that we then grilled.  I don't know if it is the tequila or the worcheshire sauce, but this does make meat really tender.  The meat also had great flavor with no trace of the tequila.  My husband didn't even added steak sauce which would the the ultimate compliment.  I noticed we were both drinking a lot of water after dinner though as it is a little salty.  I won't bother to add the extra salt next time.
I will use again for sure.  However, next time I will cut the recipe in at least half.  This makes way too much for what we would need.

we really enjoyed this marinade.  I let the beef sit for 3 hours and it turned out great. Thanks!

This was an amazing marinade. It was just spicy enough and the tequila gave a great kick.  The smell when we were cooking it was mouthwatering!  I couldn't believe how tender and juicy it made our steaks taste, even the next day after being warmed in the microwave!  I will use this again and again.  Thanks Laurie.

This was good, but a overpowering for my tastes. I used this as a marinade for chicken kabobs (I let it marinade for just over 12 hours); I think it probably works better for larger cuts of meat, or for no more than 2-3 hours for kabobs.

This was definitely a tasty marinade but I wish I would have chosen a more tender cut of meat.  I used beef stew meat which is good in the slow cooker but only so-so on the grill.  Don't be scared off by the amount of tequila, it's not the dominant flavor.  Instead of the pepper, I used a can of chopped green chilies and let my beef marinate for 2 days.  Thanks for sharing.

I don't eat meat but other people in my family do so I thought I give this a try.   I added a few things of my own and made some substitutions because I didn't have all ingredients.  Since Cinco was just a few days ago, I had some limes lying around so I thought I add some lime juice (with Tequila, how could you not add lime)and I also added minced garlic.  I didn't have a jalepeno so I used dried red pepper flakes to give it some spice.  The family seemed to enjoy it, so I'll like make it again but next time with a jalepeno to see how it'll taste different.

Really good.  Make kabobs for a party using this marinade and everyone commented how wonderful they were.  Next time I will allow the meat to marinate a little longer.

I have to say we did not like this at all.  I used it on sirloin steaks and grilled them and the flavor was not at all what we expected.  The meat was tender though.

I was afraid to use tequila, but this was great! I used about half a cup of all the liquids and it was plenty for 2, big round steaks. I just combined the liquids and added some cayenne pepper and garlic, marinaded for 4 hours and it gave the meat a great flavor!

Did a London Broil in this, tastes great. Substituted one whole jalapeno pepper, just the right amount of spice.

I would put just slightly less tequila in it, but, overall, good.

pretty good. It was nice to try a different marinade on ribs but I think this marinade would work better on chicken or shrimp

I went out and bought some really nice steaks for dinner & thought this sounded good to marinate it in. I did it exactly as the recipe stated. Personally for me it was not that great, it tasted way to strong of tequila for me. My hubby thought it wasn't bad though. Not for me, I don't like a strong alchol taste in my food. I probably wont be making this again.

This was ok. I used it on Sirloin steaks and they were very tender and juicy but I think the taste could have been better. I love tequila in drinks but in a marinade I'm not sure. This was one of those recipes I liked ok, but I think I will explore some more to see if I can make it better. I'm not keen on teriyaki sauce so I may try something different next time.

Used for kabobs--meat was tough and flavor was almost non-existent.  Sorry.  Love tequila and really wanted this to be good.
