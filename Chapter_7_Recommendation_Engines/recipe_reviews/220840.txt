Only change I made was using Splenda for the sugar, otherwise, followed the recipe to the letter.  This is a really nice salad, low in calories (and even lower with a sugar substitute) and in fat.  Great for people watching their diet, but delicious for those who aren't, as well.  Nice crunch with just the right complement of sweet-sour.

Good salad.  I made the dressing as the recipe instructed - it is light and tasty.  I added coarsly sliced snow peas and sprinkled toasted seasame seeds on top of the cucumber/onion/pepper/carrot of the recipe. The salad is so colourful and lasts well.  I made it to serve with Easter Dinner and I will make this again.

This salad is amazing!!!! I just happened to have all ingredients on hand and decided to try this recipe. I am so glad I did. This a great change to the cucumber salad I make. Shredding the carrot was the only change(used one medium size carrot) I made. I only wish I would have found this recipe a lot sooner!!
Folks, go ahead and try it. You will love it.
Thank you very much.

So Yummy! If left to sit in the refrigerator overnight, all of the veggies soak up more flavor, however we had it this first time right when it was finished!!

I grated the carrot and replaced the vegetable oil with sesame oil and this was great. Will most certainly make it over and over.

Pretty good salad.  I sliced the cucumbers and carrots really thin in the food processor, and that had a nice effect.  The ginger and seasoned vinegar came through quite well.  A nice salad--a little different--for summer.  Don't know yet how it tasted the second day yet.  I doubled the recipe, and had some left over.  Will update.  Update:  The next day(s) it tasted very good still.  Still had a crunch and the flavors really developed a little more.  Will make again.

East and very pretty. Served with Marinated Wild Salmon also from this site and brown rice. I had to use cilantro as I was out of green onions. A nice sub or addition if you have any on hand. I liked the vinegar but definitely reduce the quantity if you are sensitive to its strength.

Two of us really liked the flavor and felt it was worth adjusting the recipe to tone down the vinegar. I think maybe half  vinegar and half apple juice and then reduce or eliminate the sugar. The fresh ginger really makes the recipe. I gave it three stars because the vegies are a great combo and the recipe has potential to adjust according to personal tastes.

Served this along side very spicy grilled chicken breasts and thank goodness I did!  The cucumbers and carrots were extremely helpful in cooling down the spice from the chicken. I think letting this salad sit a little longer might help to marry the flavors but it was still pretty good and will make it again. Very easy to assemble and this made exactly enough for two.

What a great summertime salad! Goes really well with chicken. I made the recipe without olive oil and used sesame oil instead.

This is a great side salad, definitely refreshing.  Next time I may boost the ginger to closer to a half teaspoon.  I served it with the Spicy Orange Bison Meatballs (over rice) from this site, and it made a wonderful complete meal.

If seasoned rice vinegar has salt/sugar in it, do I still add more? I just had the natural rice vinegar and upped the seasoning a bit. I love the color and crunch. I am going to let it marry a bit before we eat it. There are so many possibilities for this as far as adding other veggies. Will make it again.

I'm not a carrot person and I usually don't like carrot salad especially with raisins, but I ended up with lots of carrots that I didn't want to go to waste.  I made this for dinner and it was delicious.  I didn't change a thing about the original recipe.  Everyone loved it!

This was great and easy to make. I used apple cider vinegar instead of the other because I did not have any  and used ginger paste  instead of fresh ginger . Will probably do this again.

Added 1tsp more of sugar. Very refreshing salad. Grated the carrots as my husband doesn't care for the chunks/pieces. Will make again.

We added a reduced quantity of balsamic vinegar instead of rice vinegar and also added and few cubes of cooked chicken and tinned sweet corn. It tasted heavenly and we loved it. Will definitely make it again maybe with a small twist of ingredients

We liked it alot, added thinly sliced radishes instead of the peppers, just our taste choice.  Good dressing, and the salad keeps well.

Pretty good. Would be a good summer salad. I would probably make it again.
