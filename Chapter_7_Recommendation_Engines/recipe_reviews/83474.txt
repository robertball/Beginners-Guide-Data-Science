I used a bag of slaw mix, and thinly sliced the radishes instead of shredding. I wasn't too sure about the salsa but went with it anyway - I'm glad I did, as it added a nice little twang. Finally, I made the slaw last night, but stirred the chips in just before I went to eat it. This is good stuff. Thanks!

This is very good, and a nice twist on regular coleslaw.  I used a bag of coleslaw mix instead of shredding cabbage, and it's very quick and easy to make.

I made this not sure how it would turn out, and was pleasantly surprized. I left out the tortilla chips- didn't have any and couldn't find the name brand salad dressing so made my own with 1/2 cup mayo, 2 Tbls. white vinegar and sugar replacement to equal about 2 teaspoons. The second day it got soggy, but still tasted good!

I was looking for a recipe to use our extra radishes from our garden in.  Found this, and made it to serve with tacos. Ommitted the pepper, as we didn't have one on hand.  Still great. This is such a good recipe.  Thanks Marzetti.

Yummy and refreshing!  I sliced red and white radishes (instead of shredding them).  Also, I used peach salsa and the light version of slaw dressing.  Will make again...

This was truly a pleasent surprise! I made it with a 1/2 bag of pre-shredded slaw. If you think you will have left overs - I would recomend keeping the chips separated until you are ready to eat, because they don't do well over night in the fridge. I served this as a side with Turkey burgers and sweet potato fries. I piled the slaw right onto my turkey burger with cheese and guacamole! FANTASTIC, it really made the meal!

THis was ok.  I found it kinda bland.  Next time i will add some spices to make it more 'south of the border'
