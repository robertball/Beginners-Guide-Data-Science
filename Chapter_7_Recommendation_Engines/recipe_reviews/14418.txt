This dressing would make a rock taste good.  When you make it, be sure to include all the crispy black bits and the caramelized juices in the bottom of the onion roasting pan.  Instead of sherry and chicken broth, I used vegetable broth, a little bit of chevre, a dash of apple cider vinegar, and a dash of worcestershire sauce.  Dressing was to die for.

This is a good dressing, but there are improvements that could be made to this recipe. First, 2 "large" onions is kind of vague. I think I ended up using a lot more onion than was intended, making the dressing kind of thick. It would be better to use lbs or cups as a measurement. Second, some measurement of salt and pepper should be listed, to adjust to taste, because it is easy to overlook. The dressing was really bland the first time I served it.

The combination of the walnuts & red onion along with the dressing is quite a nice surprize.  With the added ease of packaged greens this recipe is very quick!

Amazing salad and very original dressing with a great strong flavor! Even though it takes more than an hour to prepare, I totally recommend it!

I made this for dinner with a roasted chicken this Saturday night and I really liked it.  I didn't toast the walnuts but it was great.  I halved the recipe and the dressing was a bit thick but otherwise impressive!

Not a winner. Like someone else said, the dressing is basically a chicken gravy, served over salad. On paper it looks like a good idea, but in practice it just didn't work. Sorry, Barrett! On the upside, I think the dressing would taste fabulous served warm over grilled chicken, and it was easy to make.

The roasted onion dressing has a thick consistency with a sweet tang. A welcome change from the creamy or vinegary dressings usually used on salads.  Everyone who has tried this recipe loves it.

I don't understand the rave reviews. This is the worst thing I've ever tasted - I say "tasted" because we couldn't eat it. One taste and we threw it out. I went over and over the recipe to see if perhaps I made a mistake in my preparation, but I didn't. This dressing was more like GRAVY on salad! It SOUNDS good but just didn't deliver on taste. It tasted like oily gravy. I'm so sorry Barrett. It's probably just us! All the other reviewers seemed to like it!

I served this salad and dressing at a recent dinner party.  Seems to have gone over well.  No one raved but there were several second-helpers.  I prefer to caramelize onions in a saute' pan, however, I followed the recipe exactly and used the oven.  Very nice dressing overall.  How can you lose with chicken stock and onions and olive oil?

a lot of trouble and time for dressing, I have tasted much better dressing from a bottle.  Maybe I did something wrong, but the dressing tasted burnt.  The oinion weren't burnt though, they were micely browned and carmelized, don't know what happened, but it was gross.

I used two large red onions and instead of sherry wine vinegar I used part red wine, rice wine and balsamic.  I also added dried cranberries, blue cheese and used candied instead of toasted walnuts.

This was a great alternative to a fruity dressing, which my husband hates.  However, I did add a 1/4 cup of sugar to it, and next time will decrease the vinegar.  But, I will make it again.  The carmelized onions have a strong, yet wonderful flavor.

I found this salad dressing very different in texture and flavor than the regular dressings I make often. I roasted the onion and as suggested by one of the reviewers I added all the bit dark parts and juice left on the baking sheet, but I wouldn't do this next time because it gave a very stronger flavor.

Not a dressing to keep in the refrig! Added crumbled blue cheese to salad and liked it. Husband didn't like.

Thought this was good. I didn't have sherry vinegar so I used half balsamic and half red wine vinegar. I added a few drops of liquid smoke just to give it a steak-ish flavored. I don't agree with other reviews that stated this is like gravy on salad. It won't be if the salad is tossed. It is then nice and light in texture. I also used splenda instead of sugar just for my sugar watching diet purposes. I though it was pretty decent and healthy and could be fitted in my diet. It beats the heck out of old plain olive oil and balsamic. Thanks for the recipe!

We keep making it over and over to go with other salads.
