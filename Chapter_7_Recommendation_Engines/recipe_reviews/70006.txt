several reviews have noted that this recipe doesn't rise or doesn't form pockets.  This is because it has you add salt in the first step with the water and yeast.  SALT KILLS YEAST  Instead, mix the salt with the flours before adding it to the water, yeast, and molasses.

Otherwise, a nice recipe the best whole wheat pita recipe I've come across.

Some changes need to be made in order to have success.  I have made this recipe twice with my changes and is foolproof.

1.  Instead of molasses I use 2T honey.
2.  Flour - 2c WW, 1c White
3.  DO NOT ADD SALT TO THE YEAST/WATER/HONEY.  SALT KILLS YEAST.  ADD WITH DRY INGREDIENTS.
4.  Roll your pita's really thin and they will puff up nicely.
5.  Only cover them with a damp towel for a few minutes.  Otherwise the pockets will seal themselves back up.
6.  I experienced best baking success while using only one cookie sheet at a time.  Two sheets seemed to suck up too much heat and prevent the pocket from forming.

This is a really tasty recipe!!!

I'm really not sure how to rate this recipe.  First of all, other reviewers are correct:  do NOT put the salt in with the yeast when you proof it!  That will immediately kill the yeast.  Experienced bread bakers would know this, but if you are new to yeast baking, you may not.  Therefore, that hinders this recipe.  However, if you make it past the yeast proofing stage, this is a nice pita bread.  I didn't have soy flour and I wanted a bread that would puff/rise a bit more, so I used 1 cup ww flour and 2 cups all purpose.  Next time I may use some wheat glutin with the recipe as written to see if that helps it rise.  Bakes up beautifully, and I did have pockets in some of my bread.  Does have a nice taste with the molasses and the wheat flour, but you could always sub honey or sugar instead.  Thanks!

These were fantastic! I used unbleached bread flour in place of the soy, otherwise followed recipe to the letter. Amazing! I'll definitely make these repeatedly. After making these, we filled them with pizza sauce, pepperoni, mushrooms and cheese and microwaved to make pizza pockets - even my 4 and 5 year olds loved them!

*note* update on 4/26/05 - I made these exactly according to the recipe this weekend and they were PERFECT. The soy flour smelled a little different while forming the pitas, but the taste and texture were wonderful! I made 8 pitas out of this recipe - even used a ruler to measure them as I rolled them out to make sure they were right.

I found this much too heavy and I didnt understand the purpose of the molasses. if it's to add sugar so the yeast will rise, I suggest using honey instead to avoid the undesirable flavour and colour that molasses gives. a note for the people whose bread didnt rise: I found that you have to roll them out to just the right thickness. the ones I rolled too thin didn't rise as well. also, do not add the salt to the mixture until after the yeast has dissolved. otherwise you will kill your yeast.

Very good! Easy to make and comes out perfectly - exactly like the pitas I get at the store. I used 2 cups wheat flour and 1 cup all-purpose. After first rise and before rolling out, I refrigerated overnight due to my schedule. Still came out perfectly. I may add a bit of honey next time just to give a touch of sweetness, but this recipe is awesome just as it is.

This is a really great and easy recipe.  I didn't think it was that time consuming, either.  (Compared to making tortillas!)  I thought I had soy flour on hand, then at the last minute discovered I didn't, so I substituted rye flour and they turned out really good.  I also made another batch alongside, substituting bread flour for the soy.  These puffed up really nicely, but didn't make a pocket inside, so I won't use bread flour again, but even the flops tasted better than the ones from the grocery store!!  Thanks for the easy recipe with simple ingredients!  I have another batch going right now, and I didn't even have to re-read the recipe.

I made a few changes, but they came out amazingly.  I didn't have soy flour so I used 2 cups stone ground whole wheat and 1 cup all-purpose flour.  I also added 1 T. honey to the beginning.  Delicious!

Excellent!  Quick and easy!
I couldn't find whole wheat pitas in the grocery store.  So, I came home and looked for a recipe.  I found this one.  I used honey instead of molasses and white instead of soy.  These turned out just the way I expected.  I love them.  My family loves them.  I will make these again and again.

Substituting white wheat flour for the soy, and honey for the molasses works well too.  Thanks for the great recipe, (dziekuje) Smucia!

Nice flavour to these, and very easy to make, I did not have soy flour and subbed AP flour...my only issue with these is that they were not as soft as I would like them...the texture is very dense and I think the WW flour is the culprit....will play with the flour amounts until I get it to where I want it.  Great recipe for home use, makes only 6 pitas so that is a boon when I am making them just for myself...once I perfect the flour amounts, I will update this review.

Flavour is excellent.  Some of mine rose nicely, some not so much.  I think perhaps I did not roll them thin enough.  They'll still all get eaten and I will try this again

I was very pleased with these.  Like so many others, changed to scant 2 cups ww and 1 heaping cup ap flour; also sub'd honey for molasses (but intend to try).  I came up with 8 pitas of about 75g each.  Baked @ 425 for 5 to 6 minutes (spritzed walls) and they puffed up beautifully!  Thank you so much for recipe.

Finally! I don't have to desperately search the stores for "clean" whole wheat pitas! I know exactly what is in them and they are fabulous! This recipe was very easy and delish. It didn't take as much time as I thought it might and I double the recipe so I could keep some in the freezer for a while. I did however, substitute whole wheat pastry flour for the soy since I didn't have any. I will be making these forever, unless a "clean" bakery opens up around here soon, but thats very unlikely.

This was fantastic pita bread! Just make sure not to put salt right into the yeast mixture. I only used whole wheat flour and it still turned out perfectly. They puffed right up into big nice pockets that we ate with tzatziki,

This worked just fine for me! I make the dough in my bread machine on the dough cycle, layering the ingredients as I normally would if I were to make bread, staring with the water, salt, sugar, flour and topping with the yeast. When it's finished doing its thing, I pat the dough out, let it rise for 20-30 mins. and bake it in the oven. Having my bread machine do the hard work makes these more fun, fast & easy to make! My substitutions: used white flour instead of soy flour, brown sugar instead of molasses, added 1 T. wheat berries. Letting the pitas cool a bit in moistened cloth is also a key step. Part of people's issues with this recipe seem to be a matter of personal taste. I personally prefer chewy/crusty over soft bread, so if you enjoy a more rustic texture, this is the recipe for you. And I could care less about the pockets - they never hold the filling in anyways, so I just use them like bread slices. But that's just me! ;)

Great and easy recipe! I didn't have soy flour handy so I used all purpose and it worked out beautifully. My harshest critc, my sister, ate about seven of the halves in a row.

I am giving this a 4 star because I love the freshness of the pitas.  I used honey instead of molasses.  Used 2 cups WW and 1 cup AP flour.  Not many of my pitas puffed up, but that is likely because I did not roll them flat enough.  

With the pitas that did not form pockets, I simply cut them in sections then slip them open.  Baked them with salt and olive oil in 375 degree oven until brown.  these were absolutely delicious and MUCH BETTER than the famous brands. 

I love knowing the ingredients, and knowing there are no preservatives.  Also, made for party and the pita chips got rave reviews!

I tried this recipe twice and both times this did not work at all.  I substituted all-purpose flour for the soy flour, and brown sugar for the honey (as I didn't have either of those ingredients handy).  The dough barely rose, and the pitas didn't rise at all.  I cooked them hoping for some magic, and ended up with barely edible frisbees.  Now I am not an experience bread baker so that may have been part of the problem, but these were still disappointing.

Fantastic!!  I followed the advice of others regarding adding the salt to the flour, and using honey instead of molasses.  I also used 2 cups whole wheat flour, and 1 cup white.  Putting them in a plastic bag while still fairly warm helped them to deflate.  My family thinks I'm pretty talented for having made pita bread, but it was really quite easy!  No more store bought pita bread for us!  Besides, this stuff is fluffier and fresher.

Man, this worked out great, even though I added the salt to the proofing yeast mixture. I was nervous when I saw all these reviews saying not to, but it ended up rising fine -- nice pockets, every one of them. The pitas were soft, chewy, delicious.  Used all-purpose flour instead of the soy flour.

I have to agree with the other person who actually followed the recipe and used SOY flour instead of substituting white. You get an unmanageable sticky dense dough that doesn't rise and doesn't roll well because it never seems to have enough flour to stop sticking to you and the countertop. Ended up being a waste of time, I'm sorry.

Great flavor! I used a little bit more water, 2 cups wheat 1 cup AP floor. I used honey. I made them half the size and cooked them at 500 for 3 minutes and they are PERFECT!

I've made this recipe twice now. I did not use soy flour because I didn't have any. I substituted white flour and only used one cup and two cups of whole wheat. I also used frutose for sweetener because it's easier on my husband's diabetes and still feeds the yeast. I cooked them on top of the stove in a hot cast iron skillet as suggested by another reader. That was much easier than in the oven. I think they turned out great. They don't puff up enough to make "pocket" pitas but they make great wraps or just butter them and eat.

Even though I didn't care for the smell of the soy flour, these taste great!  These burn quickly at the very high temperature!  This is the first time I''ve made pita bread, and I think it went well!

I made these with Joseph's Maltitol instead of molasses or honey--they are YUMMY and belly good!  (if you follow the belly fat cure program) 
Delicious as a base for a low carb pizza too!

I've been wanting to make whole wheat pita bread for awhile. This recipe is wonderful! Having never made pita bread, I was a little nervous, but they turned out perfectly! I did use 2 tbsp of honey instead of molasses and added salt later as other reviewers have said.

I made this exactly as the recipe said. Except that I added the salt into the yeast mixture with the flours after the yeast had dissolved, thanks to other reviewers tips!! It came out perfect. It was so easy to make and I will most definitely use this recipe again. Thanks!

I used honey instead of molasses and all purpose flour instead of soy flour.  I also proofed the yeast with the water and honey first (added the salt in with the dry ingredients).  They puffed up and formed pockets!! Turned out delicious!

Wonderful recipe!  This was my first attempt at making pita's and my whole family loved them!  I used baking flour instead of soy flour and 1 TBS of both molasses and honey.  Very simple to follow and tasted great!  Thank you for the money saving recipe!

i wasn't going to rate this because, like everyone else, I didn't follow the exact recipe. But I decided to anyway because 90% of recipes reviews I read start with something like, "I didn't follow the recipe exactly..." 

I don't like soy flour that much so I used WW (1 1/2 cups), AP (1 cup) and barley (1/2 cup) flours. And of course added the salt to the flour, not the yeast. It was easy to make and the bread came out great! Mine didn't puff up as much as the photo but still had pockets. I live at high altitude and didn't know what adjustments to make, if any.

I've made this quite a few times and they are always terrific!  I don't use soy anything so I subbed bread flour and they puffed up just fine.  I also use the molasses because it gives it a great, nutty flavor, like wheat bread (which also has molasses in it).  The only issue is the directions saying to add the salt with the yeast---that'll kill your yeast, I always add salt after the flour.

Wonderful! I followed others' suggestions and was quite pleased. I used all-purpose for the soy flour, and success! The are only 6 pitas, however, so next time I may double the recipe. Thanks so much for the recipe!

I really appreciated this recipe to utilize home-ground wheat flour. I didn't have soy, so used some unbleached, umbromated all-purpose white from a local miller instead. They turned out great, despite this being my first time making Pita bread. The pan that I heated with the oven before placing the dough upon it turned out the best Pita pockets.

I followed the recipe exactly and like other reviewers ended up with a sticky ball of dough that required about an extra cup of flour in order to knead it.  The result was edible, but not all that tasty.

I have to rate this low for a pita bread recipe, as it does not work as written for pitas. Most of the 5 star ratings have been using any other kind of flour but not soy flour. Soy flour has NO gluten and there isn't enough with just the wheat flour to let the yeast do it's job and make them rise. Substituting all purpose or rye does make the difference and adding honey or sugar instead of molasses makes a more ethenic flavor. Adding the salt mixed with the flour also works better. There are better recipes out there...

Very Good recipe.  I made these twice this week already.  Wow, everyone loved them!  I made changes though:  2 cups WW four, 1 cup AP flour, 1 tablespoon honey.  Instead of making pita bread however, I separated the dough into 9 balls and rolled into thin circles.  I then fried these in greased skillet till slightly browned on each side.  Then I covered them in a damp towel.  This made lovely wraps.  Thanks for the recipe, maybe I'll get to make pitas one day. :)

Wonderful tasting right out of the oven, but very easy to dry out. A little hard also to make a good pocket without it falling apart.

This was my first attempt at making pita bread, so I don't have anything to compare it to.  They are rather time consuming, but nice to have fresh from the oven.  I did find that they got a little tough, esp the ones that were leftover til the next day.  Good flavor, and my husband liked them because they tasted very "primitive" to him -- maybe cause you had to chew so hard to eat them.  Overall, not bad; i would make again to accompany certain meals (see Mediterranean Feast meal idea), but alot of work.

I made this recipe with the changes suggested by Julie and they taste great! But.... It seemed the the dough was very dry and the baked pockets a bit in the dry side as well. Thinking I will need to play with to play with the recipe a bit... Any suggestions?

In my opinion this recipe has many flaws.1. I tnhink the yeast is supposed to be proofed earlier than mixing with flour. 2.I think the salt is supposed to be added in the flour, not while proofing yeast.3.Even after proofing the yeast & then adding it correctly to the flour, the flour didn't rise much 1st rise(supposed to get double in size).4.it didnt form fluffy pockects.While baking there were very little pockects, ,but not like separate top &bottom.5.Could make only 4, each 7" round whereas recipe states 6.Also it took additional 10-15 min. to get fully baked.7 &that too using middle rack.the texture was on crisp side rather than soft. I don't know how can this recipe be listed here . taste wise it was fine.But definitely not a keeper.

I made this recipe today, incorporating the changes recommended by many reviewers (subst. honey for molasses, add salt with flour, use 2c WW and 1c AP). Even without really giving them time to rise properly, these turned out very well! I baked some on a cookie sheet and others on a pizza stone. The cookie sheet ones are permenant flatbreads, but the pizza stone ones puffed up perfectly! Can't wait to stuff them full of goodies! Thanks for this recipe!

A-mazing! 4 stars because of the salt- thankfully I took the advice of many reviewers and added the salt to the flour mixture instead of the yeast. I also used straight whole wheat flour. Then, FOLLOW DIRECTIONS EXACTLY! (with the exception of salt.) and these will puff up and be soft, yet strong enough for kids to fill themselves :) A total keeper!

I followed other reviews and used honey in place of mollases, 2cps ww flour and 1 cp white.  These turned out fabulous and I even screwed up the rising process :P!  I have not done much in the bread baking department but the suggestions of others to not mix the salt with the yeast and water was very helpful (I would have never known).  Also, I put my dough in the oven to rise (turned off); from what I have read, the yeast creates it's own heat and the oven holds that heat to ensure your dough is at the correct temp.  Well, I forgot it was in the oven and started to preheat it for cookies, LOL!  That was my goof but I still kept plugging away and I now have wonderful pita bread that even my children like and take for school sandwiches!  Thank you for the recipe and reviews!!!!

I used self rising flour instead of soy flour and 2 Tbs of honey instead of molasses. I also added 1 Tbs of organic cane sugar for a little more sweetness. They turned out great! Not too sweet at all. They're a little labor intensive so I'm not sure if I'll ever do them again, but I'm really enjoying them. BTW, they don't puff up and make their own pockets. You have to cut the pockets in them, but it's super easy to do.

I wasn't thrilled with this recipe, it was far too dry, I ended up adding a considerable amount of extra water.  I gave it four stars because the flavor was good, but not better than others I've made, I'll be going back to my original recipe.

awesome!! mine puffed in the oven, I'm not sure if that's what they do, or if they're supposed to puff before you put them in, but the came out perfect. I used 2 cups wheat, and 1 AP, and agave nectar because I didn't have molasses but the principle was the same and they came out awesome! Leftovers will be used tomorrow for pizza pockets!

I just started making my own bread and this turned out really well! I actually messed the order up in the directions and they still turned out awesome! It was so fun watching these puff up!!! I used agave necter instead of molasses and all purpose flour instead of soy flour. This is the first time I have ever rated a recipe and I wanted to rate this one cause it really was so much fun making these!

Tried this but substituted 2 1/2 teaspoons of instant dry yeast instead of the active dry yeast, and 1 1/2 cups all purpose flour instead of soy flour and it turned out just great! It was my first time making pita bread and I'm so happy with the results. Will definitely make it again!

The flavor of this pita bread was wonderful!  I didn't read other reviews until too late, but next time I will add the salt later since the bread didn't rise for me.  That was ok this time, though, as I was using it to dip with tzatziki.  I used the exact ingredients, and was surprised to find that soy flour had so much protein...so I will continue using it.  I also must have baked it too long because it was a little dry...but the taste was still very good!

These pitas tasted much better then any store bought ones I have ever had.  I made a dip and cut the pita into triangles.  They were a big hit, people didn't believe I had made them myself.  I will definitely be making these again.

Turned out great!  I was very pleased with it, and I haven't had a lot of success with yeast breads.  Very easy and delicious.

I use honey instead of molasses, add the salt to the flour and not the yeast while it is creaming, use 1 cup ww flour, 1 cup all-purpose, 1 cup soy flour

This was my first attempt at making pita and this recipe turned out great. As other people noted did not add the salt directly into the yeast, hot water, and molasses. It was added to the flour mixture.
They came out of the oven puffed up and very tasty. A great recipe!

The soy flour made the dough impossibly sticky.  I ended up adding about an extra cup of flour just so I could work with it, which made the bred quite dry and cakey.  It was filling with a good balance of proteins and carbs byt definitely not nearly as good as storebought.

I followed the recipe to the letter and found that it was tough and very flat.  I liked the flavor, though, and simply used it as a flatbread to accompany ragout.  Next time I will try adding a bit of white flour and a bit more yeast and see if that affects the tough/flatness.

I made this exactly as recipe stated.  Maybe I'm not used to soy flour, but I think it gave the pitas a funny taste.  The texture was ok though.

I don't know what I did wrong, but mine barely puffed up, then flattened.  I just like my pita more fluffy, bread like.  It was edible but I won't make again.

My first try at Pitas! I did use unbleached white flour instead of the soy flour, I did add the salt to the flour instead of to the yeast mixture as many others have said. I think this is a good basic recipe that can be varied according to the type of flour you have on hand. Thank you for the recipe!

I made this in my food processor and kneaded it by hand.   I couldn't find soy flour,  so i subbed with white.   Also used agave instead of molasses or honey,  just because i had it available.   They turned out great!   Really good flavor,  easy to make.   Made them into pita chips and ate them with spinach artichoke dip.

Hey, this makes delicious bread, especially still warm from oven. I used tips from others provided. Used 2 cups bread flour and 1 c whole wheat, and molasses.  I let it rise for 30min 2nd rising since 1st rising was in too cool a place.  The flour could have been cut by about 1/4 c. Easy to roll out.

HINT: I used a tortilla press and they came out smaller but made more and every single one puffed  and one is the PERFECT size for a sandwich as the larger ones are just too much...(for me anyway).... as for the "molasses" check out the nutritional benefits and you'll see why she uses it and not honey or sugar.... :)

These are so soft and yummy! Definitely worth the effort. I heeded  the warning of other reviewers not to mix the salt with the yeast. I didn’t have any soy flour so I used all purpose. Also I buy my yeast 4oz at a time and had to look up the amount of an envelope; 2 1/4 tsp worked perfect. Thanks for the recipe!

I'm not an experienced baker so I put the salt in with the yeast and liquids but it foamed up right away and everything rose, beautifully.  They are just going in the oven so I don't know about the pockets issue but they smell great, texture is perfect and yeas, the dough tastes amazing!  ;)  wha?!  I had to taste it, to make sure it wasn't going to be too blah!  Haha!

This recipe turned out great. As mentioned in previous reviews, do not put the salt in with the yeast . salt should be mixed with the flour. The family loved them . We used them for cheeseburger pitas. And the leftovers for hummus dip.

It separated into small balls and didn't stick together like a traditional dough.  I am trying again after reading the reviews. This time I used less water 7/8th cup and used 2 1/4 c ww flour and 3/4 c soy flour.  Same problem.  I tried adding more water, not better.  Now I am trying to add more whole wheat flour.

Great recipe! Loved the addition of molasses; gives the pitas great flavor.  Did not have soy flour so I used 1/2 c flax meal and 1 c all purpose flour.  Will try soy next time though. Thanks for posting!

I also did some slight modification and used 1 c vital wheat gluten + 1 / 2 c soy flour. In addition to whole wheat Atta (Indian) + agave syrup. The pitas came out perfect with huge pockets every time, and a much healthier alternative to store-bought.

Just getting into baking breads and such from scratch vs buying at store. Trying to make healthier choices for the family. Tried these this evening and they turned out pretty good. Used honey instead of molasses and 2c wheat flour and 1c all purpose since thats what I had on hand. Will be making again and will try other whole grain flours.

I have always just adored pita bread, and this is a healthier, delicious version! I love the taste that the molasses gives. If you're not a fan of molasses, you can leave it out and substitute honey. Thanks so much,  "Charlotte's Mom"!

This was very good. I took all the suggestions about not adding salt directly to the yeast and did 2 cups whole wheat and 1 cup all purpose flour. They were delicious and really simple. My biggest problem was being so impatient. I might add some canola oil next time to keep the dough more uniform because it flaked a little.

I used all whole wheat flour and whole wheat pastry flour (Indian atta). Trick to make perfect puffed up pitas is keep the oven rack in the second notch from top. Heat the broiler and place the rolled pita right under the broiler. Check in about 1-2 minutes. Turn over. Check again in 1 minute. Perfectly puffed up flatbread. Make sure to keep checking regularly. Can burn very quickly.

I gave this 4 stars only because it seemed too time consuming.  Although the pitas did come out good and are very healthy, I think  it's easier to just buy them. If you live at a location where pitas aren't a common find, then this is a great recipe.

This was my first time making pita bread and they were very easy to make.  They had wonderful flavor but I did not get pockets.  I added the salt to the flour to avoid killing the yeast.

I used all purpose flour instead of the soy flour and white sugar instead of the molasses. I also added about 3 tablespoons of olive oil and a bit more water to make the dough more workable. I fried these in a non-stick pan on top of the stove and they turned out nice and fluffy. A very good recipe, with some minor adjustments.
