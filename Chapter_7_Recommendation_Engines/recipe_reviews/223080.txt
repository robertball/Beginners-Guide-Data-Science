I made these because I found some beautiful beets with lovely greens at the market. I will make it again if I can find nice beets with good greens again.

This was a fantastic dish!  We received beets in our CSA and I had no idea what to do with the leaves and stems.  I added shrimp at the end.

Honestly I am not a fan of beets but this is great. I usually make this in conjunction with some chicken and it’s  super tasty and light.

This makes a tasty, quick and easy dinner.  I used spaghetti noodles and had to omit the fish sauce because I forgot to pick up a new bottle, so I just threw in a little extra soy sauce to make up for it.  Very good!  Don't omit the ginger - that is key!

Very yummy! Used different pasta cuz I didn't gave spaghetti. Dropped the fish sauce, but did use the wine. It is delicious and would be good with chicken or shrimp if you wanted more substance. I want to try it again with fresh ginger. Just didn't have any!

This was very good. Of course I omitted the fish sauce. I used the white wine. I used coconut oil insted of sesame oil and I also added a tbls of butter. I know I didn't exactly go by the recipe,  but it was a great base to work off of. It definitely tasted better than I anticipated.

This was good.  Usually I find the flavor of beet greens too strong, but this combination of ingredients was really good!
