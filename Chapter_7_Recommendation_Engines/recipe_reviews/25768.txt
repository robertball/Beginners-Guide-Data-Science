I was intrigued by this recipe as you don't often see a biscotti recipe calling for yeast. They are fabulous though- I think the yeast lends a more tender texture to the biscotti which is wonderful. I did not have ricotta on hand, so I drained cottage cheese and used that. I also used the dough hook on my stand mixer instead of a bread machine. The dough came out smooth and flexible, much like bread dough and formed beautiful loaves. I had to bake the sliced cookies in the oven longer than what the recipe called for... I would recommend turning down the oven temp on the second bake and keeping them in there longer to dry out more. The ganache recipe to dip them in is great- wonderful flavor and it lends a nice "biteable" covering for the cookie! I took these to a scrapbooking party and they were a HUGE hit! I will certainly make again!

As I sit munching on my freshly baked biscotti....what can I say....It's fabulous!!  I made it a more healthy choice...I used white whole wheat flour! One batch I used walnuts and the other cherry extract.  They turned out so nice and crisp. Also if the batter is a little sticky to work with just put a small amount of oil on your hands and pat it out.  Works perfectly.  Did you notice...? no butter!  Had it of called for butter though, I would have used canola or olive oil anyway.  It is a much healthy choice and is just as good.  I make lots of biscotti and am always playing with the recipes.  This one is GREAT!  Try it!!

This biscotti is to other biscotti as baguettes are to biscuits. The yeast adds a certain texture that the baking powder biscottis don't have. Personally, I like the baking powder style much more. Even my teen-age son wouldn't eat them.

Biscotti came out great but I used chocolate chips for the semisweet chocolate melted in the cream and it wouldn't harden or set up on the cookie. Just stayed "wet" or not set or glazed on cookie. I assumed since the recipe called for choc. chips in it, the same would work for the choc dip! Apparently I was wrong and should of used a semi sweet choc bar?
