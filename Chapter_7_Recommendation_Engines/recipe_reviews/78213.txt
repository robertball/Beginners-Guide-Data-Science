Pretty good. I think there was a typo when this was entered, because two TEAspoons of chili powder was perfect. I read the other reviews, and they served as a good warning. I started with one teaspoon, checked after simmering for a while, added another half, then ended up sprinkling on some more. I also added a couple pinches of cumin toward the end. It came out delicious, although my boyfriend requested chicken in it next time. It made for some good tacos along with some canned salsa verde sauce.

This is a good base recipe with plenty of room for modifications. Here is how I prepared it: I fried 2 cups white rice in 3 tablespoons olive oil, added 3 tablespoons sofrito instead of the cumin, 1 package sazon seasoning, 1 cup tomato sauce & 3 cups chicken broth. Then I added 2 cups pigeon peas. After I made it, I asked my neighbor who is from Puerto Rico what she thought and she was impressed! It was delicious!

I don't know if i did something wrong but 2 tablespoons of chili powder was way to much for this.  I couldn't even eat it.  My husband who's Mexican tried to eat, but it was not tastey at all. We just ended up throwing it away. Sorry :(

This turned out pretty good for me, but the chili powder flavor was overwhelming.  I did double the recipe though, and sometimes that can throw things off, so I might give this another try.

I thought this was a great mexican or spanish rice recipe. I did cheat and use instant white rice so not sure about their cooking method with the long grain rice. Here's what I did to make it with instant rice. I cooked two cups of instant rice per package directions. I cooked the onion in peanut oil until tender then added the seasonings (garlic powder too) and the tomato sauce - left out the tomatoes because I didn't have any fresh left! Cooked about 5 min. then added my insant rice which I only ended up using a little more than a cup. Heated through and served with green onion on top!

I paired this recipe with sour cream enchiladas...and it was marvelous.  It was nice and tomato-y, a nice contrast of flavors with the enchiladas.  I doubled the recipe and only used 1 tsp of the chili powder, and upon discovery I only had ONE can of tomato sauce I ended up using tomato soup as a substitute!  It turned out awesome, and my kiddos really liked it...and that's saying something, seeing as how they're all ages between 5 and 9! :)

Too much chili powder and really not much taste to the rice.

This is the closest recipe I've come across to legit spanish rice/ arroz rojo the way my family has made it for generations. The only difference is we never added any spice. If you notice, the recipe says to brown the rice first then add the onion and garlic which is the right way to do it. Or else you get burnt onion and garlic while the rice is browning.

We have been looking for a restaurant style Mexican rice recipe that didnâ€™t end up either too wet or dry and had a good flavor and this worked out perfectly. The only changes I made were to double it because it was never going to be enough for our gang and I rinsed the rice really well before starting so it wouldn't be sticky.
It turned out fluffy but not dry and the amount of chili powder was on point. My husband is super picky when it comes to a good Mexican rice and was very pleased with this one. Will be making it again!

I made it. I like the base of garlic, onions, salt, pork fat but combining the broth and tomato sauce left the rice soupy even after adding the additional 5 minutes of cook time. I cooked it another 10 minutes to get everything absorbed but then the rice was of course over done.

Really good and easy. I thought the rice was sticking to the bottom of the pan, but by the end it has all loosened. This dish might be a little bland for someone looking for a punch of flavor. I served it as a side with fairly spicy tacos. It was just right for that.
