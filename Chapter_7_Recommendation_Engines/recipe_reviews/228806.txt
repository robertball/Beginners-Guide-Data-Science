Super easy and super delicious with some tweeks. After browning and draining the meat with the pepper and onion (I used all of the tops of the peppers minus the stems and a whole small vidalia onion), here's what I added to the mixture:
3/4 cup rice
3/4 cup water (depending how much rice you like you can add or remove just make sure the ratio is 1:1 water:rice)
1 can tom paste
1.5 Tbls Worchestershire
Salt and pepper to taste
2 cloves garlic
1 Tbls italian seasoning
Simmer the above together for a half hour. Microwave the peppers for 3 minute. Fill the pepper half way with meat mixture, put and layer of cheese, fill the remainder, top with cheese and 1 can tomato sauce. Bake for 45 min.

This was easy & came out really good.  Usually I make the rice separate & then add it to the ground beef. I like that everything was made in one pan.  i did add a tiny bit extra water as the mixture was simmering.

These were FABULOUS!  I would recommend seasoning to your taste...what kind of recipe like this doesn't call for garlic?  I added an easy 2 tbsp minced to the cooked meat, along with 1/2 tsp of Italian spices.  I enjoyed the fact that they were not coated in sauce, though they were a little dry, IMHO.  I think maybe 1/2 of a tomato juice would easily remedy that....or, add that extra cup of shredded cheese in the 2 cup bag.  I heaped and packed my peppers full--there was more than enough to go around, which made the non pepper liking people very happy.  All in all, this definitely goes in my keeper box, and after 15 years of marriage, and begging on behalf of my hubby to make this...I will concede and say this is the recipe that fits our bill!

This is the way I always make my stuffed peppers, except I don't cook the rice. I just add the raw rice and 1/2 tsp. salt to the cooked beef mixture along with the remaining ingredients. I omit the water and cheese out of preference. I then cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake for an hour. ***Tonight, I subbed Johnsonville Mild Italian Sausage for the beef and a can of Italian tomatoes for the regular. I added 1/2 tsp. Italian Seasoning and 1/4 tsp. salt. Again, I omitted the water and cheese. I filled the peppers, covered the dish with aluminum foil, and baked for an hour. A very delicious variation on stuffed peppers!

I have never made stuffed peppers before, so this was a bit of a disappointing recipe. In my opinion, it was quite bland and that was after adding a bit more Worcestershire and salt...thinking it definitely needs some added spices, maybe some garlic...and, I would not sure tomato soup again as it is far too sweet.

We enjoyed the flavor of this recipe.  It was also easy to make.  I would suggest adding more salt to taste, and I even added an extra teaspoon of Worcestershire.

Wife likes Stuffed Green Peppers for reasons I've never fully understood, so thought I'd give it a try.  Opted to make a few changes to the basic recipe but kept to the general idea. Used 6 red bell peppers rather than green, ground round beef combined with chopped-up left-over vegi-burgers (about half & half) , 1.5  cup red onion, 1 cup beef stock, 1 can Rotel diced tomatoes, white rice left over from a few days ago, 1/2 lb shreaded mozzarella cheese (only marginally past the ex-date) and 1 tea salt, 1 table Italian spice and some left over soy sauce from last week's Chinese take-out. Worked well, they ate it, and I got the frige cleaned out at the same time. (Wife took the left-over one for lunch the next day - and never picked up on the vegi-burger.)

I am partial to recipes that give the basics, while leaving room for cooks to add whatever, if they want. This one fits that bill. I made approximately a double portion, because someone had given me five HUGE bell peppers. I added more onions, proportionally speaking, and used garlic salt instead of plain salt. The next time I make these I will likely double the cheese, too. Oh, and I used more Worcestershire, because I love Worcestershire. My changes weren't so much in the ingredients, though, as in the manner of preparation. Owing to health related limitations, I can spend only short amounts of time cooking. So I browned the ground beef one day, cooked the rice two mornings later, and that afternoon put the chopped onions and pepper in the microwave. All the ingredients went into the iron skillet and I let them heat up for about ten minutes, giving some time for the flavours to blend. Then I stuffed the peppers and baked them for 15 minutes longer than suggested, since these stuffed peppers were so big. They turned out so good that I doubt my method of preparation detracted at all from the outcome. I'm going to be making these on a fairly regular basis.

I loved how quick and easy this recipe was! I made a few changes because I saw others note it didn't have enough flavor. I had 3 green bell peppers and 1 orange. I hollowed them out and I blanched them. (Preserves color and texture). I minced up 2 cloves of garlic and half of a white onion. I sautéed that in olive oil until translucent and then added my 1lb ground beef with some butter. When brown, I drained the mixture and put it back In the pan. I didnt have worsurire  sauce unfortunately. But I added in salt, pepper, garlic, basil, Italian seasoning, hot sauce(to flavor). For the tomatoes I used fire roasted canned tomatoes. I then cooked everything as directed and it came out fantastic! Thanks for the recipe.

I added a little garlic seasoning and a little more cheese atop the peppers. I used Organic long grain Brown Rice~maybe this may have been the problem I incurred.
 I added the rice at the correct time to ingredients. Rice was not tender at all. I should have precooked the rice a bit or I should have used white rice.
These were tasty and easy to prepare.

Very good recipe. The only change I made was to use orange, yellow, and red peppers instead of green as I like the flavor better. Otherwise easy to make. My husband asked me to keep this recipe and make it again.

Only change I made was to put a slice of sharp cheese over top of pepper while cooking. Otherwise a great recipe !! Froze half of ground beef for another time and it was perfect when I used it.

I followed the recipe as written except that I added tomato sauce to cover the peppers before baking.  The filling was moist and tasty.  I will definitely make this again.

This was an inspirational recipe for me. We have always prepared these Italian style with NO precooked ingredients, diced tomatoes in top and the juice in bottom of dish. So, my only change was adding garlic, onion, Italian herbs and Parmesan for the cheese! Fabulous and can be made ahead, refrigerated then baked! Thank you!

Great recipe and super easy. I microwaved my peppers 5 min instead of 3. Last time they were not as soft as I liked. Also, I made my rice separately in a rice cooker.

I like this recipe because prior to this I always made the rice separately so this made things much easier.  It was a little bland though,  I would suggest adding more seasoning.  I added some garlic and McCormick Burger seasoning as well as using "zesty" diced tomatoes.

Very good. I replaced the diced tomatoes with can of Rotel Diced Tomatoes w/green chilies (with juice) and also used red peppers along with green peppers and topped with more cheese. My husband loved the red pepper ones.  Definitely not bland at all with the Rotel.  The only thing is  I think the peppers could steam a little longer in the microwave before filling as they were still a little too firm after baking.

Awesome Baked Stuffed Peppers!!!  My Mom made stuffed peppers as I was growing up and I didn't like them.  Now that I am a grown woman and I decided to give another try.  I am glad I used your recipe and this recipe is a keeper.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  BTW, I would add little bit of Hunt's tomato sauce to this.

This is a good basic recipe.  I always add a lot more spices than other peoples recipes call for.  This time I threw in basil, hot sauce, chili powder, garlic powder, and onion powder..  One thing I can't tolerate is a blah stuffed pepper, or for that matter a blah anything else!  I also preemptively upped the oven temp to 375, and cooking time to 40 minutes.  They came out good!  Thank you for taking the time to post the recipe.

Couldn't have been easier, and was SO tasty!! Use of Worcestershire sauce and cheese really jazzed up the plain recipe I'd been using. Only added some watered down tomato paste on top before baking, but that's just a personal preference. Terrific recipe.

I changed the cheddar cheese to mozzarella.. and pulled from another recipe w little change! But cut the caps up, cooked w the meat and onion then placed them on top of the peppers while 5 minutes left and added sprinkles of finely shredded mozzarella... amazing!!!! We have eaten this 3 times now, in 7 days time!

Not hard to make and fun to get back into comfort food! I used an extra half cup cheese. Next time I’ll double or triple the Worcestershire sauce, and a bit more salt too. I cooked them an extra 10 minutes but my green peppers were quite huge!! I also added extra rice and water so I’d have the extra pan of stuffing for hungry eaters!

I made this recipe, which is similar to my family recipe, but without green peppers. Substitute red, yellow or orange peppers which are sweeter and tastier, and also look pretty for company.  These stuffed peppers  freeze nicely for future meals.

Very nice recipe. I substituted italian sausage for beef, and grilled them while camping. Came out WONDERFUL. If grilling, would recommend foil on grill as the peppers tend to slouch between the tines and spill.

One of the easiest and tastiest main dishes I have ever made. Ate half and put half in the freezer. Next time I might play around and use salsa instead of tomatoes and/or add taco seasoning to give it a Mexican slant. Delicious as is however.

My husband and I thought the stuffed peppers were really  good. I used 3/4 lb ground turkey and 1/4 lbs ground pork instead of the beef.  I used fire roasted diced canned tomatoes and pre-made brown rice.   I adjusted the amount of liquid and the cooking time.  I added more seasoning, too

Loved it! but I did add a couple of things to it. 
I added 1/8 TSP Garlic Powder 
1 TSP Dried Basil 
2 Ribs Celery Diced 
I used 1 Cup Texmex shredded cheese instead of the Cheddar 
It was a big hit! My company wanted the recipe.

Prep time took me longer than their estimate.
The next time, I will use petite diced tomatoes.

Out of 4 recipes I viewed this one was the best for ingredients on hand.  The mixture came out a bit dry after browning, added a small amount of ketchup which was really good in flavor! Added cheese to the tops not in the mixture. Next time I make this recipe I plan to add the small can of tomato sauce to the tops then add cheese.
Oh and I added a pinch of Garlic & Italian to the mix while browning.

I think this was a great template recipe. I substitued the ground beef for morning star chipotle black bean meatless crumbles, used rotel diced tomatos with chilliesand added a bit of cajun seasoning and used organic brown basmati rice. Overall it turned out very delicious

I gave the 4th star for the easy prep. As far as taste it was okay, a basic stuffed pepper. I did add about a 1/3 pound of Italian sweet sausage I needed to use up  otherwise I used the ingredients listed.

We really loved this recipe. I didn't add the chopped tops of the green pepper to the beef as it seemed a bit of overkill. Instead, I added twice the Worcestershire sauce and 1/2 tsp. of minced garlic.

I used ground chicken or ground turkey, as my husband has a digestive problem with beef.  I used red peppers.  They are sweeter than green peppers.  I kept the rest of the recipe  the same.  Fantastic for a quick dinner with dinner rolls!

Made these for dinner tonight. I added garlic powder and vegetable broth instead of water. They were delicious.

Was kind of bland even after extra garlic, italian spice & worcester. What I didn't like was that it took a lot more work & extra cooking than other recipes.

This was easy and yummy. I was out of Worcestershire, so i substituted soy sauce. Omitted the salt for a salt free substitute I used Penzey's Spices; Arizona Dream. Brown rice not long grain white rice... This was a delicious recipe and is a keeper in my book=)
