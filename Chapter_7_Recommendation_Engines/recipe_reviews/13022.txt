This soup was so good, and very easy to make.  I used a rotisserie chicken (the whole thing, which was a bit much, next time I will add another can of tomatoes to thin soup a little)  I also didn't have canned tomatoes with chilis in them ( impossible to find Rotel in Toronto) so I just used regular canned diced tomatoes and add a bunch of jalopenos from a can. I went light on the cayenne (1/4 tsp) because I was making it for my parents and didn't want it to be too spicy for them.  I also took a flour tortilla, sprinkled some chili powder on it, cut it into thin strips, and baked it for a few minutes.  I topped the soup with aged cheddar, sour cream, sliced avocado, cilantro and a couple of the the tortillas strips arranged artfully on top.  It looked like soup at a fancy restaurant and the taste was awesome. I had it three times last week and have been craving it ever since.  You won't be disappointed.  Thanks!

I did not start out to make this particular recipe, but found I didn't have the ingredients needed for my other one.  This was really, really good.  Tortilla soup is one of those things that is hard to get right, especially if you're from San Antonio; it needs to be spicy, yet flavorful and above all, authentic.  I can't believe Ro-Tel and canned chilis can be this perfect...I may never try that other recipe with fresh tomatoes and jalapenos.  I served it over tortilla chips instead of frying the tortillas.

Followed the recipe as it is, and it turned out great! Not for the faint of heart, as it is very spicy...luckily we like a little extra kick. Next time I might try adding some corn or avocado.

Wow, this was really good.  I made the following modifications: I used only 2 chicken breasts and then added one can each of black beans and corn.  I also doubled the amount of broth.  I excluded the cayenne pepper and I'm glad I did because it had the perfect amount of heat for our tastes.  It would have been much too hot for us with the cayenne.  I used blue corn chips rather than cooking my own tortillas and added extra chopped cilantro as a garnish.  Delish!

Delicious! Baking the tortillas is a healthier alternative to frying them. Try avocado, sharp cheddar cheese & add more cayenne pepper!

This has become a fall and winter staple in our household with a few twists. I use vegetable broth instead of chicken broth - a can of peeled plum tomatos and I throw in a avocado in the last stages of simmering. Serve it with the basil, roasted pepper, monterey jack cornbread from breadrecipe,com and you have a great meal.

Very good, but better the next day. I garnished the soup with blue corn tortilla chips & cheddar cheese, because I prefer my tortilla soups that way.

I Love this recipe.  I always add frozen corn for the last 15 minutes, which I think works really well in this recipe.

This was fantastic!  I made this for Father's Day this year, and everyone loved it!  I  cooked the chicken breasts in chicken broth, and I served it with some sour cream in addition to the cheese and tortilla strips.  It was even better the next day!  Goes great with corn muffins.

This recipe is excellent!!! I only used two chicken breasts instead of four, I also added salt to taste. This made enough for my husband and myself for two meals. The flour tortillas are a nice change from the normal corn. My husband likes the flour ones but not the corn, so this is just perfect. This would be really great with black olive slices added at the last minute also. I did add extra lime juice, just a personal preference. This is a great recipe. It is very spicy with the cumin and cayenne pepper. If children will be eating you might want to half the amounts on these two. Thank you for the fabulous recipe Sheila!!!

Fantastic taste, nice and spicy without being hot.  Next time I will use chicken thighs instead of breasts--they were really dry.

Great recipe!  I used a can of Rotel and added black beans and corn.  Instead of the flour tortillas I crushed tortilla chips into the bowl when serving.  I upped the cilantro to 1/2 of a small bunch.

Excellent.  I couldn't get diced tomatoes with green chile peppers (I'm in England), so I just used a canplain chopped tomatoes, and half a jar of Discovery brand jalapeno slices in brine.  I also did not have lime juice so used lemon juice instead.  I also cut the cumin down to .25 tsp because I usually find cumin overpowers the other flavors.  The soup came out absolutely delicious.  My husband loved it and I am going to serve the leftovers with rice tonight.

This is really good! Instead of flour tortillas, I used corn tortillas. I made the soup following the recipe. And then I had diced avacado, fried strips of corn tortillas, chopped cilantro, shredded cheese and sour cream in bowls so everyone could customize their soup bowl. Double or triple 
the recipe, it's delicious.

Good stuff! As suggested by several reviews, I started with leftover rotisserie chicken, added a 14.5 oz can of rinsed black beans and a cup of frozen corn. I loved the result. It was easy and fully flavored! Nice and spicy! Thanks Sheila.

This was awesome!  I did read all reviews before making it, and they were very helpful.  I doubled the broth, I added corn and canned black beans (drained and rinsed).  I used garlic powder along with fresh, and added about 1/2 tsp. salt. I did not have chicken on hand so I used pork stew meat. YUM!!!

Awesome!  I am a big cilantro fan, so I doubled the amout, and I doubled the lime.  Too save time I used 3 cans Tyson's (12.5 oz) breast meat.  Huge hit!  It fit the weather for the day.. mid 30's

This is THE BEST tortilla soup recipe I have ever tried!! 

Some alterations or additions I have made:

Once I used canned chicken to save time--Just as good!

Garnish: cilantro, monterrey jack cheese, chopped avacado, green onion, sour cream, tortilla chips (instead of frying my own!)

Also, I have added corn to this recipe which makes it really good!

I know that most of you won't agree with me, but I did not care for this recipe at all.  I just returned from Los Cabos, Mexico last night and was so excited to make tortilla soup.  This recipe sounded good, but it tasted nothing like the soup I loved in Mexico.

Vary good and most of all, simple and quick.  I used canned chicken, because I had quite a few cans that I wanted to get rid of.  Also, I simply crushed tortilla chips for the topping, so I wouldn't have to fry anything.  Thanks Sheila!

This soup was delicious! I agree with a previous reviewer about sauteing the onion with corn tortillas and then adding it to the soup. I used 4 small corn tortillas and added them to the pan as I sauteed the onions. They added an awesome flavor to the soup, although did fall apart as it cooked. It wasn't clear and brothy but had lots of depth in flavor. If I was serving to company, I would probably only serve the tortillas on top and not cook them in (to make it look better). Corn tortillas are the way to go with this soup. I used the breasts from a rotisserie chicken.

Delicious!  Followed the recipe exactly except that I multiplied it by 4!  It turned out great!  I added corn as well as suggested by some others on here.  Very flavorful.  The tortilla strips on top really seal the deal!

Since I retired a couple of years ago I have had to "re-learn" to cook and this soup certainly helped!  Husband loved it...one secret he doesn't know - I used a tbsp of plain yogurt on the top of the soup rather than the usualy sour cream and he said the "sour cream" was really good "this time".  It was all I could do to laugh - I haven't been able to get him to eat plain yogurt - thank you!  I did add some black beans and a little corn.
It was delicious!

My husband raved about this soup!!  Very easy and cheap too. I added 1 cup frozen corn, used 2 chicken breasts and 1 can rinsed and drained black beans to up the protein and fiber. It was VERY spicy though, and I like spicy, but next time I will add 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper.

This soup was DELICIOUS!!!  I rarely like anything I cook and I have picky kids but this soup was gone!  I did add carrots, celery and a can of tomato soup and omitted the cayenne.  I also  squeezed 2 large limes into it and it gave it a great flavor.  Thank you Shelia, I will be making this again!

This soup was a big hit at my house!  Best served with sour cream of course. When I feel too lazy I don't bother cooking the tortillas or I use corn chips instead. Also good with a can of beans added. I have started making this based on what I have around and I am trying to keep all the ingredients in stock!

This was SO good!! I just made the dish for lunch and I had to get on! I appreciated the warm feeling the soup gives you...I made a few changes tho',I cubed the chicken into bite size pieces instead of shredding them,I only put in one tablespoon of cilantro or it would have overpowered it in my opion and I put in a bit more liquid than called for but it came out really fine! Go ahead, make it! You'll be glad!

Great soup!  I modify everything -- added can of hominy and chopped jalapenos.  I don't fry my tortillas - I use corn tortillas and cut into strips, put on sheet pan then spray with olive oil and bake - 12 min or so at 350. shake pan 1/2 way thru.  Great with sliced or chunked avocado added in!

I've made this so many times I don't even need to look at the recipe!  Whenever family comes to visit us in San Diego I have this soup and a pitcher of margaritas waiting for them after a long flight.  I don't add the tomato soup as suggested, but I do add a little more chicken broth than the recipe calls for.  It's definitely worth the effort to make your own fried tortilla strips.  I sprinkle them with a little cumin and salt while they're still hot.  I serve this with chopped cilantro, extra lime, chopped avocado and grated jack cheese.  So easy and amazingly good.

Great recipe so far I've made it three times and it's always a hit!!  My husband loves Applebee's chicken tortilla soup, so I wanted to make one similar to theirs....and this soup is very close...I added a little more lime juice and did not add the cayenne pepper the last two times b/c it was too much spice for my children...but it still came out great!!

I loved this! I added a can of tomatoe paste, and 1/2 cup of rice about 30 min towards the end. When I added the rice, I found it needed more chicken broth. This does wonderfully in a crock pot.

This soup was really good. I did double the amount of chicken broth and added some corn and black beans.  I used about 3/4 of a rotisserie chicken.  We topped our soup off with sour cream and cheddar cheese. I live in Texas and this is a good "Tex-Mex" tortilla soup!

My fiance and I loved this! I am a vegetarian so I used fake chicken (the best use of fake chicken I have found thus far) for my portion and the real thing for his.  I substituted vegetable broth for the chicken broth and also added some corn, zucchini, yellow squash and a can of fire roasted tomatoes.  Great recipe!

This was good but I had problems with the stock/meat ratio. I had boiled it uncovered so there was a lot of reduction. I ended up adding 2 more cans of broth to have enough but we like a good amt of broth and not just chunky soup. I will make again, good taste and heat.

Very good with good flavor.  I added a few dashes of hot sauce to our tastes, and used corn tortillas that I baked in the oven--we prefer the corn over the flour.  Our son came home from the fire dept and finished it off with compliments.

I have been looking for a tortilla soup to rival the Mexican restaurants and this is it! I added 1/4 cup lime juice to give it some kick and served with jalapenos. Also, freezes very well. Thanks, Sheila!

I love this recipe so much I make at least once a week. 
I make it low fat by baking tortillas or using fat free chips, and skipping the cheese which is not really necessary. 
Try it with avocado slices.
MUCH better the next day!

This is a staple soup in our family.  It's easy to make and delicious! If I want to add a twist I will add black beans and homoney. I always skip the corn. Adding avocados is a must! It makes a very hardy yummy addition. To save time I use a rotisserie chicken.

I followed the recipe exactly. The soup is good (too spicy for my child), but it either calls for too much chicken or too little soup juice. The suggestion to add a 10 oz can of tomato soup seems weird. Wouldn't that change the flavor?? Either way it should have been added to the original recipe. I will try it next time.

I would give this soup 10 stars if I could.  The flavor is wonderful, especially if you like cilantro.  I added a can of corn with red and green bell peppers.  It shows corn in the pic but not on the recipe!

Great soup, I made a few modifications. This time I used leftover chicken (from whole roast chicken), the first time i used 2 cans of canned chicken.  I also added frozen corn the last 15 minutes, and subbed corn tortillas for the wheat ones.  Garnished with shredded pepper-jack cheese and sour cream.

This is a good recipe. I was a bit disappointed after reading the reviews that it was spicy even without the cayenne, which was not the case in my opinion. Next time I will definitely be using the cayenne for that spicy kick that tortilla soup is known for. Otherwise, it was still a yummy recipe.

This was a hit with my family. I've been making a chicken tortilla soup for my family that was given to me a couple years ago. All of it was made from cans. Sure it;s quick and easy but fresh is always better. I really like the kick this soup gives you as you keep eating it. Great recipe!

We loved this soup!  I threw everything into a crockpot and let it cook all day.  I had no pans to clean because I used frozen shredded chicken I pulled from a rotisserie a couple of weeks ago.  I added corn and black beans. I didn't have a small can of green chilis so I just used the ones in the tomatoes.  I doubled the recipe but not the cilantro and lime.  I saved the rest as garnish if someone wanted more of that flavor. We used tortilla chips instead of shells because we were in a hurry.

This was really, really, really good! We hd been wanting something mexicanish, but didn't want tacos, enchilladas or anything like that and this really hit the spot!  It was a little too spicy for us and i think it had a little too much chicken and not enough broth but that could be easily fixed. 

Good job!

Hubby and I really enjoyed this soup.What great flavor. I added more garlic,(6 cloves),1 tsp of Cumin,one can of white beans,2 qts of chix broth, Rotisserrie Chix,the Rotel(diced tomatoes with green chile peppers), the 4oz of Green Chilies chopped,1 6oz can of Tomatoe Paste, 3 tbls of jarred Lime Juice ( my limes are still not ready to be picked),leftover Mexican Restaurant Tortilla Chips, and a touch of Cilantro as I forgot to buy that, omitted the Cayenne and the Rotel was plenty spicy for us. Topped it with Sour Cream and Cheddar Cheese. Next time I will add the Cilantro and Fresh Limes. I did pick some fresh Basil leaves and tossed in a handful of that the last 10 min before serving to  get them to go limp. Delicious recipe, and for us a Keeper. Thank you for sharing this great tasting quick to make hearty soup. And I have leftovers to freeze. It was 103 degrees today, but this soup was worth cooking. It will be a body warmer in the winter.

This recipe has become a major staple in my home. I make it in the slow cooker, I use low-sodium organic vegetable or chicken broth, and I add lots of veggies (carrots, celery, etc.). I broil corn tortilla strips for added crunch on top. Very healthy, very easy, and everyone loves it!

Very good recipe!  I loved the flour tortillas.  I will probably double the recipe next time.  It JUST fed our family of 4.  It was a touch spicy for the kids.  Make sure to season with a little salt and pepper too.  I would not load up with the tortilla strips.  They get soggy fast.  While they have a good flavor, even after soaking, I would recommend that you put a few on the soup and then have a bowl on the table to resupply as needed.  Thanks for the great recipe!

very good and easy to make. I did make a few changes. I used a store bought rotisserie chicken because it's quicker. added: extra can of diced tomatoes, 1 can of jalapeno's, corn, black beans, black olives. Deleted: cilantro (don't like it), cayenne pepper. I also used store bought tortillas because it was quicker but I'm sure home made ones are fantastic with this.

Love love love this soup!  To save a few grams of fat and calories, I bake the tortilla garnish (with no oil) instead of frying it.

Great simple recipe, tastes great, I normally add a bag of frozen corn along with everything else to add a little more texture to the soup - I also suggest a dollop of sour cream and a slice of avocado when serving to really add some great dimension and contrast to the taste.

This was a HIT with my family. For color we added corn, black beans and for additional flavor we add hominy. Because we were not sure is the added ingredients would make the soup less souper, we added an additional can of chicken broth. Note: we did not increase the spices.

Make a double batch, you are going to need it!  As recommended by others, I added one can of both black beans and corn.  I also omitted the chilies and it was still spicy enough for my family - the cayenne pepper is powerful and the tomatoes already have the chiles.  Topped it with sour creme, monterary jack cheese and the tortilla chips.  The fresh cilantro and fresh lemon juice really make this dish seem authentic and take it to the next level.  Thank you!

This recipe is amazing!  No need to cook your own chips though if time is an issue.  Store bought tortilla chips will do just as well (but the homemade ones do taste better).

Wow. It has been quite a while since I gave a recipe 5 stars but this one is definitely deserving! Really, really good with a nice flavor but it may be a little warm if you have children - my nose was running. There were several tortilla soup recipes on this site I was wanting to try, but this is so good I will probably just stick this one. Why mess with a good thing???

I made this recipe, but made a few changes.  First, I boiled whole bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts and then removed them from the bone and shredded them.  I used the chicken stock from boiling them and added 4 bouillon cubes.  Also, instead of frying the tortillas, I just warmed them up and served them on the side.  My husband and I found this soup to be a bit spicy, so next time I'll try cutting the red pepper down to 1/4 tsp.  It's a very good and hardy soup.

This is a keeper!  It was just the right amount of "heat".

I did make some modifications:
Added a can of black beans (rinsed), a can of black olives, a can of corn (no jiuce), and a small can of tomato sauce.  I added an extra can of chicken broth and extra cumin.

I also added cornstarch to thicken it up.  For garnishes, I used low fat sour cream, cubed avocado, fresh cilantro (also put in the soup while on the stove), and grated cheese.  

This was so good!

I have made this with my Home Ec kids three times now and it comes out just as good each time.  The faculty are always after me for the recipe!  It's a bit on the spicy side, so if you don't like too much heat, go easy (or even without) the cayenne.

This soup is a little trouble but well worth it. Everyone loves this soup and I get request every couple months. To make it a bit easier you can use canned chicken as it is already sort of shredded.It is fairly low in fat too if you use fat free tortillas which you can't tell flavor and low fat sour cream . Thanks!

Wonderful - I chose this recipe over the others because it is so much healthier. It is excellent! We love spicy food so I considered adding a little extra, but it was perfect as stated in the recipe. I added in some tortilla to the broth while cooking, gave it a little more substance and tasted great. I baked the tortilla strips as others suggested -- my husband has now claimed that they are his new favorite snack. Thanks for the great recipe!

I love this tortilla soup, at first I thought that I could substitute the can of green chiles with a few fresh serrano chiles, but I was mistaken and it was too hot. I made it again and it was perfect.

This is now one of my staples!  I made it for a party around xmas time and my friends loved it.  Cook the chicken like you would for tacos or fajitas and it adds some zesty flavor to the broth.  Be prepared to add some stock to the mix for those who like to slurp their soup.

This soup is fantastic as is.  It has just enough spice and a great flavor.  It was also very easy to make.

My husband and I thought this was absolutely delicious.  We used grilled chicken from the night before instead of shredded and I accidentally added lemon juice instead of lime, but it turned out great anyway.  Since I was going to feed it to my one year old, I omitted the cayenne pepper.  After it was all done, I decided not to feed it to her after all because of the kick it had.  We loved it, though!  My husband said it may be the best tortilla soup he's ever had!  Oh, and I love it because it's so easy!

Very easy to prepare and a great way to get rid of some leftover chicken breasts. I simmered a lot longer thus making the soup too think. Ended up adding some more chicken broth. Made the tortilla strips thinner. The kids really liked those. Topped with sour cream also.

This is fantastic recipe!  It's great as leftovers too.  I followed the advice of adding the tomato paste and am glad that I did.  It turned out perfect!

I have been making this recipe for three years now and I love it! The cayenne pepper it calls for is too much for me, but I'm a wimp. However, my friends love it any way I make it. It is so easy, and never lasts long! It has become the dish my best friend requests when I get the opportunity to cook! I always add the tomato paste, otherwise it is very runny, like a broth.
Try it!

This is an excellent recipe - even my picky son ate it!!  I only had raw chicken, no cooked and did not want to cook the chicken first so I just added the raw chicken breasts/thighs at the beginning with the broth, tomatoes, etc. By the end of the 30 minute cooking time the chicken was done.  I took the chicken out and shredded it then returned it to the soup along with the lime juice, cilantro, cumin and cayenne.  I also added some frozen roasted corn (from Trader Joe's) during the last 15 minutes.  Wonderful and so easy!

Very good.  Not too spicy, but it has a nice kick to it.  I had made chicken tacos and used the leftover chicken in this, so there was a hint of taco seasoning there.  This type of soup is going to be better the next day, after the flavors blend a bit.  I'm looking forward to bringing this to work tomorrow!  I anticipate this will be one of my cold weather staples (and darn good for clearing out your sinuses when you're sick!)  Thanks, Sheila!

We loved it!  I didn't add the extra spice at the end, it had quite a kick w/ just the green chiles and the onions.  I added a can of corn for extra ingredients.

My family and I loved it.  I made it the night before so the seasonings could sit in, and I thought it was going to be too spicy for the children with the green chili's.  But it was not the next day.  I added corn and rice to it.  We will make it again, because my 10 year old is asking for it again.

After making a few changes to this wonderful soup recipe, I think this is the best ever!! I used Tyson Whole roasted chicken (no skin or bones).I only used 1/2 the onion. I omitted the lime juice& cilantro. I used corn tortillas, not flour. I added fresh corn, fresh zucchini, & carrots. I fried corn tortilla strips in vegetable oil with a dash of chili pepper until crisp and used for topping along with cheese on top with a slice of avacado.

Only change I made was I added a can of drained whole corn I cut up an avocado to go on top with the cheese. We served a cheese crisp (graded cheese on a tortilla) baked in the oven on the side. Delicious!

Turned out great!! Everyone loved it. I didn’t have the green chili’s, so I added chopped jalapeños. It was just the right amount of heat and flavor. Have added this to the “must make again” list.

I just started  with sauteed onions and then the chicken. This recipe  was so easy to make! The outcome  was a phenomenal soup that tasted so good it seemed like it should have been a huge effort to make. I did add a dollop of sour cream before topping with tortilla chips. Excellent meal on a cold night!

I found this recipe by using the ingredients search. I used left-over chicken from a rotisserie chicken I cooked. I also added an extra can of diced tomatoes just because it looked like it needed more liquid. I'm a heat wimp, so I used only half the cayenne pepper. Turned out very good. I would make this again.

This soup is amazing! It is a light, but filling, option with an excellent flavor profile. I will most definitely be making this in larger quantities to freeze for later, as it does take a while to make.

This is a medium on the spicy scale, so keep that in mind if you have people who only eat mild foods. 

I personally would not make any changes. I like the liquid consistency, but could see where some may wish to thicken the sauce to some degree.

Bottom Line: You cannot go wrong with this recipe!

I made this soup and served it at a party before ever trying it.  Risky, I know.  It was a huge hit.  Easy to make using rotisserie chicken from the store.  I also added about 2 TBS cilantro paste to broth and offered fresh cilantro garnish with pepper jack cheese.  Will make this one again!

This is fabulous.  I like a mix of light and dark meat so I just boiled a chicken and picked it off. I added a tad of salt and a can of southwest style corn that has a few black beans it it but all in all it would be great without them so it def gets 5 stars! Topped with a Mexican cheese blend, the tortilla strips and a dab of sour cream! I was worried it would be too spicy but it is awesome!

Good recipe! I did substitute a few items, I used 1 can of Rotel Mexican style diced tomatoes with lime and cilantro, I added about 3 sliced carrots, I added avocado slices, I added 3 cans of chicken broth,  and I used corn tortillas. It was easy and very tasty!!

This soup is AMAZING! So easy to throw together, and everyone loved it. The only criticism I will give is that four chicken breasts is WAY too much for this recipe. I made it with two large breasts and it was a ton of chicken. I can't imagine this with four. Otherwise, it was excellent!!

I've made this a couple times now with only slight differences. I sauteed the onions and garlic first in some butter, added a can of drained black beans and a package of frozen corn, and this time around I omitted the cumin because I didn't have any. Everyone loved it! Almost the entire pot of soup was gone! There are a lot of recipes for this type of soup on here, but this one is my go-to.

Very tasty, restaurant quality soup. Husband said you could sell this stuff!  I added about 1 cup of frozen corn for the last 15 minutes.  Next time I'll double the recipe since its doesn't make a lot.

Very good and easy recipe. I was out of diced tomatoes so I used a little tomato paste and prepared salsa in the broth. Added a can of corn and avocado, sour cream and shredded cheese for garnish. I like to make my own strips by cutting up corn tortillas and frying about 2 minutes in the deep fryer.

Wow, this was really good. I made the following modifications: I used 4 chicken breasts and then added one can each of black beans and corn. I also doubled the amount of broth. I excluded the cayenne pepper and I'm glad I did because it had the perfect amount of heat for our tastes. It would have been much too hot for us with the cayenne. I baked some of the tortillas and added extra chopped cilantro as a garnish. Delish!

Delicious! I threw everything in the crockpot for a few hours and it turned out great. I also added black beans and used NM green chilies for extra kick. Next time I'll remember to add corn. I also toasted tortillas and sliced them to put on top along with the cheese and lime. Will definitely make again!

This is fantastic! I made this for a group of 30 or so people, and it was a hit! Instead of frying the tortillas, I cut them up and put them in the soup.  It added a nice consistancy. The fresh cilantro makes this soup so amazing.  I'll definitely make this again for myself!

This was a wonderful soup! I changed it up a little bit to suit our tastes, but the thing that really makes this soup great is sprinkling tortilla chips over the top. I will make this again!

This soup is very good! I added a can of drained and rinsed black beans. It made the soup very colorful, and a tad more filling. Very good!! Definitely will pass this one on!

Good recipe and gets extra stars for being so easy!  I used a rotisserie chicken for this recipe, and like previous users, found it to be a little too much (I thought it'd be ok since it was on the smaller side).  I needed a little more broth to compensate but was out so used a little Dos Equis lager for extra liquid and it turned out great!  I also added a can of drained white and yellow corn and upped the cilantro to 2/3-1/2 of a small bunch.  Will definitely make this again!

I read reviews for this recipe but in all honesty it really lacked flavor. I would have roasted the chicken on the grill first. Did add corn and garden chilis for zip.

This soup is absolutely amazing.  It is so much better than what I get from a local mexican restaurant. It is very spicy so you might want to adjust to yout taste.  I added chopped potatoes, carrots and celery and added more broth. Must try this receipe.  Thanks Shelia for sharing.

This is a really great recipe, I definitely read the reviews and appreciated the advice!  I just buy tortilla chips, saves time there.  And I loved the recommendations to garnish with avacado, cheese, cilantro, radishes and little soup cream, it's a wonderful meal on a chilly evening!   PS I have also used extra chicken from the freezer and just started with water and chicken instead of using the canned broth, it was just as good if not better! enjoy! :)

My husband loved this soup.  It was so spicy that we didn't put in the cayenne pepper - only the cumin.  We added some chopped jalepenos which is why it was so spicy.  We'll probably make this again.

Very easy and a nice thick soup with great flavor.  I tweaked a little, added a can of corn (in photo but not recipe), more diced tomatoes and sliced up some flour tortillas small like noodles and added in beginning of recipe.  This thickened soup and added another texture.  All together a great recipe.  I didn't have cumin and it still had great flavor.

This was very delicious.  I added corn and black beans to my soup and used some roasted green chile I had in the freezer instead of the canned chiles.  It was spicy, but not so hot that my mouth was on fire and I could enjoy the other flavors.

This one is a little bland for me. I tried adding some salt, but it is missing the traditional Mexican flavors you expect in a Tortilla soup. Very healthy and low in fat, but also a little low on flavor. 

I think that other recipes with more ingredients would get better results, but would take longer to make. 

One more point - this recipe does not allow for the cooking time of the chicken. You have to boil and shred it before adding it to the broth, so allow 15-20 mins for that.

I made this soup yesterday for the first time, and followed some of the previous suggestions.  One can of corn, one can of black beans, and I didn't add the cayenne pepper due to personal preference.  I did add the juice of an entire lime, and didn't add cilantro to the soup, but used it as an optional garnish.   My husband and I agreed that this was by far the best tortilla soup either of us had ever had.  I cooked it in the crock pot on low all afternoon, and our whole house smelled amazing.  Next time, I will definitely make a double batch!

This was sooo tasty.  I doubled the amount of broth and added a can each of black beans and corn.  I also halved the cayenne and added a total of 3 tbsp lime to it.  The lime really makes this recipe, IMO.

I used this as a base for my soup and it was very good. I added about a cup of beer and some black beans and corn and a few dashes of mexican seasoning. I think with out these changes it would have been a bit bland for my taste.

It's delicious when you mix in white corn and tomato juice as a base! Also try substituting veggie "chicken" in chunks. Yum!

This is definitely a keeper!  I took the advice of several others and added a can of drained corn.  I also cut back just a bit on the pepper.  I took the time to crisp up the flour tortillas in olive oil.  Easy and well worth the time.  This is fantastic and I'm sure will be made many many times over the years by our family.   Oh, next time I think I'll double it.  I'd hoped for leftovers for lunch tomorrow, nope!  They loved it!

LOVE IT!!!! I maded it for my bunco group and all love it.  People kept going back for more untill it was gone. Only wish I had made more of it.  I did change only one thing, for time, I used crushed tortilla chips instead of the fried tortillas.

I travel often to Mexico and this is a very traditional dish. I really loved the thin consistancy. Very Simple. Very Delicious. I added a little cream of chicken soup (about a tablespoon) and it was fantastic!

Turned out better than a lot of mexican restaurant tortilla soups I've had!  I used 1 diced jalapeno in the beginning instead of cayenne and home-made chicken stock.

This was great! I did use the suggestions of using tomato paste and rice which made it a little thicker so I added the drippings from my chicken. I used bone in chicken breast and baked it in white wine, stock, butter and thyme. You got to try this soup.

Delicious and easy!  Instead of the diced tomatoes with green chilies, I substituted a 14.5 oz. can of tomatoes with jalepenos and omited the cayenne peppeer.  I just topped with crushed tortilla chips.  Definitely a keeper.

As good as any tortilla soup I've ever had in a restaurant.  Sour cream and avocado adds a nice touch.

I added one can of tomato paste to give it a richer color and thicken it up a bit.  I only added half the green chiles and about half the cayenne pepper, and it was PLENTY hot for my husband and me.  I'm also not a fan of shredded meat (any kind), so I added small chunks of cooked chicken breast instead, and it turned out fine.  The sliced tortillas were a perfect topping.  It's a definite keeper.

Excellent! I used Italian Style tomatoes and spiced it up a bit more adding extra Cayenne Pepper. I also sliced up 3 ten inch flour tortillas inot 1/4" by 1-1/2" stripps and threw them in as noodles. I will be making this soup again soon......

WOW!  I made this for my husband, who loves Mexican food, and he ate almost the whole pot himself!  (It's his new favorite)  We made it exactly like the recipe, except used less chicken.  DELICIOUS!  Wonderful! WOW!

This was the best soup! I made my own homemade chicken stock and served it with baked corn tortilla stips, avocado, cheese and salsa. Yummy! I will make it again and again!!!

Quite good; I added yellow corn.  With this recipe you're really cooking, instead of just heating up some cans.  BUT, if you like to just heat up cans of soup for a quick & yummy tortilla soup, check out the Easy Tortilla Soup submitted by Pat.

A wonderful soup for a fall/winter day.  I added some fresh chiles for a little bite, and served with avacado, monterey jack, and bought tortillas.  My entire family loved it.

This was a little spicy for my child, but my husband and I enjoyed it so very much.  It is also excellent the next day if you put the sauted tortillas in a container and use them for individual usage.
