This is very similar to another recipe on this site that I have been making for years only in the oven.  I never use the butter, and it turns out fine.  I usually use about 1 tablespoon of flour, but I think it would be fine without it, or you could use cornstarch.

This was a good and easy recipe.  I did not have time to use the slow cooker so I baked it in the over for one hour at 350F.  Came out great!

This burned even before 6 hours. I’d change a few things before I made it again. Definitely didn’t do well in the slow cooker. It was tasty though!

Sorry, I know everyone else gave it five stars but I did not like this at all.  I love all the ingredients that were used but not this recipe. Waste of good money and ingredients for me.

This dish came out light and fluffy and very tasty. However, I am not sure crock pots are the best way for me to make egg casseroles. When eggs cook too long, they water out and that is exactly what happened to mine. When I got home and checked the temperature of the center, it was 190 degrees. When I bake egg casseroles in the oven, I take them out when they reach 165 and never have trouble with watered out casseroles. Had I been home and caught this dish at the right temperature, I feel confident there would have been no watering out. Now, I must say I did not add the flour, and I am "guessing" that may keep this recipe from getting watery in a crock pot. I just wasn't willing to put flour in my egg casserole. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and was very happy with the taste and texture of the dish. It was a winner recipe. Next time I will add some roasted red peppers to just give it added color. I do disagree with the 15 minute prep time. I assumed the contributor of the recipe meant for you to chop the spinach, even though it was not mentioned. If you do that, there is no way I can prepare this dish in 15 minutes. Plus I grate my own cheese since I do not like the ingredients that are added to pre-grated cheese to keep it from sticking together.  I will continue to make this recipe, but will prepare it in the oven. It was truly an amazing dish and I just loved the taste.  It will make a great brunch recipe for company. If you don't mind using flour, and the flour

I made changes that didn't work well. The  casserole itself was good without my substitutions. I used a 6 qt. crock pot. Six hours is just right on this casserole. I had to get up early to turn It off.  Don't let it cook to long or it will brown too much. I used fresh spinach I chopped up. I substituted gluten free flour for wheat flour. Also I had two extra eggs so I tossed them in also.  I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese and added turkey bacon and jimmy dean turkey sausage. That was my mistake. I will use Hillshire turkey kielbasa sausage next time. I don't think the ricotta made a difference.

Very tasty and simple. It was on the moist side going by the book with 8 oz baby spinach and 8 hours in an Instant Pot on the low slow cooker cycle. I used the non-stick insert.

Update, for a 6 quart Instant Pot: set for medium saute, add half the butter and the onions, add the mushrooms after a few minutes, no need to fully cook, just take the edge off the onions. Turn off the pot and add remaining butter and let the spinach wilt in the pot as it cools down. This makes everything fit in the pot easier. Prepare other ingredients, (I used 8 eggs and added 1/4 tsp cayenne), mix in sauteed veggies and their liquid. Pour back into Instant Pot. Slow-cook on low for 7-9 hours using the standard lid or a glass one.

I made this as part of a food train for a friend in need.  No changes made and the reviews were great; "I ate this for breakfast and dinner, really tasty."  Going to make it for myself today using fresh eggs from my backyard chickens.

Delicious.  I made it to take to work and actually doubled the recipe and it fit perfectly in my Crock Pot.  Lots of compliments and requests for the recipe.  The one change I did make was to cut the amount of spinach in half.  I was having such a hard time stirring it all in, so I halved the spinach.

I have a question. Would this dish work if I omitted the flour?
