This was delicious but I couldn't handle more than a couple of glasses - too sweet and sickly. I upped the amount of rum, of course. Nice for a change. Thanks!

Had some coconut milk and a banana to use up, so I thought I'd give this a try.  Couldn't taste the banana at all and there was just a hint of the coconut milk, but the rum flavor  dominated too much for me.  If I were to make again, I'd put two bananas in.  It makes a lot, too.  If you like sweet drinks, this may work for you.
