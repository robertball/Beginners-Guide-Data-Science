This is actually called a "Rachel". I worked at a deli for years and a Reuben is made with corn beef, a Rachel with pastrami. But this is the traditional way to make it!

i've avoided reubens for one main reason -- sauerkraut. we thought we'd try this recipe out, despite my reservations! this sandwich is really good and extremely quick. i tasted the sauerkraut first, alone, and it was horrible -- but, all the ingredients are together for a reason, and make a tasty combination. try this recipe, even if you're a little afraid! we'll be making this one again.

I had all the ingredients ready when my husband got home from work and let him make these since he is the griddle & grill master--he did an amazing job, and the sandwiches were excellent. He heats the sauerkraut and meat separately on the griddle, then piles both on the bread, tops with the cheese, and grills the whole thing. Used Sauerkraut Rye bread, from this website.

Quick to make and not the same old same old corned beef flavor.  I did however bake it and not fry it because my family likes the cheese really melted.  I toasted via the oven all the bread slices for about 4 minutes and than after assembly popped the sandwiches back in the oven for 12-15 minutes, flipping at about the half way mark.  Perfect!

I prefer using sauerkraut from the bag rather than the can. I also like to cook my kraut first, adding chopped onion, caraway seeds and crispy fried bacon. Once that was done I proceeded with the recipe. My husband loved this and it made a great Saturday night dinner, just for him! Thank you!

An excellent sandwich.  As other reviewers have reported, it's quick and easy to put together.  My family loved these.  Three thoughts:  1) In trying to figure out what might have been different from those reubens that restaurants make--it was the meat.  Restaurants usually provide more meat, making for a much thicker, more substantial sandwich, and 2) "medium-high" seems a little too hot.  The sandwiches seem to brown too quickly, nearly burning--before the cheese is melted.  I know this is not rocket science for you experienced cooks, but I'm still learning, and 3) It would be nice if these held together better, but I think the rulebook requires that Reubens be messy.  I cut the sandwiches in half, and even in quarters for my mother-in-law, who has dementia, and they were much easier to handle.  Five stars, baby.

Thanks for a quick, easy and delicious recipe. I used thinly sliced smoked turkey breast instead of pastrami, and low fat thousand island to make it a little lighter, and it was fantastic!

Actually a "Rachel" is typically made with turkey breast - not pastrami. In fact, you can use this same recipe with many different types of meat - all with their own unique flavors. It's a nice variation from corned beef. However, I must say that a lean (typically much more expensive at the deli - but worth it) corned beef is my absolute favorite. And, I use marbled rye instead of just plain old rye bread. Yes - recipe is intended to be messy - but if you have the right mix of sauerkraut and thousand island, it almost acts as a "glue" in holding the sandwiches together.  I find that the easiest way to make these is on a lightly greased griddle rather than a frying pan. Wide, flat surface area makes it easy to flip and gives the bread a more even doneness.

Delicious sandwich!  I had to use American cheese because I was out of Swiss, and it was still tasty.  Even my pickiest eater in the household ate it!  I like Granny Loohoo's tip about heating the meat and the sauerkraut separately.  You definitely need a griddle instead of a pan, because these sanwiches require two hands to flip and to eat!

This is a great basic Reuben (pastrami better then corned beef). Keep it simple. Don't forget a good hairy mustard.

This is a great recipe and actually the one my office cafeteria uses. They grill the bread seperate on a bread grill, and the meat on the griddle, folding/layering the cheese between the slices of pastrami. They slice it in half and add potatoe chips (sour cream and onion for this) and this is the lunch I eat once a week at least!

I made my own rye bread which made it turn out fantastic. I only gave 4 stars because I put the sauerkraut in a pan and browned it a bit and then put the sandwich together. It was the best.

I have been making this wonderful sandwich for years. I rarely buy sauerkraut, so I use coleslaw instead. Try it, you'll be amazed at how satisfying it is, particularly for those persons who do not like sauerkrat.

Very good recipe.  I made these for a group and the true "Reuben" lovers just loved these.  I don't eat red meat so I made mine with sliced Boar's head turkey from the deli and Yum!

This was awesome, although I did as some other reviewers and heated my saurkraut in the microwave before grilling the assembled sandwich.  I did not have any rye bread on hand, so I used a whole grain bread.

Great recipe! Thank you! I did cook down the sauerkraut with sugar, while that was heating I pulled all the meat apart and mixed it up in a frying pan on medium heat. My husband said that sometimes the Reuben is hard to eat because the meat slips out when trying to bite it, but since I broke all the meat up he didn't have a problem with the three that he did eat! This was a hit with my children as well! I served it with cole slaw! Thanks again for the wonderful recipe!

This is one of my favorite sandwiches. Use corned beef or pastrami depending on your preference and make sure the sauerkraut is well drained. I like to spread a small amount of Miracle Whip on the outside of the bread before frying.  I find it results in a beautifully browned sandwich.

Very good.  Easy to make.  I made them for some friends for lunch.  I got the compliment of "best reuben I've ever had!"   I used the cheap packaged corned beef (surprise!) instead of pastrami and SEEDLESS rye bread.   Will definitely make again.

As jB points out, a "pastrami Reuben" is usually called a "Rachel" (although in Baltimore, a "Rachel" is more likely to be made with coleslaw rather than sauerkraut). Either way, we find it easier to spread margarine or butter on the top of the assembled sandwich, then melt butter/margarine in the pan and grill the un-buttered side first, then turn and grill the other side.

Awesome !!! Hadn't had one in 20+ years
The only thing I would change is that they got a little soggy, so next time I will sandwich the kraut between the pastrami.Definite keeper. Thanks

I used a George Foreman grill...toasting outside of the rye bread slices, before filling.  Spread dressing and cheese etc,on toasted sides, make a sandwich, and replace in grill.  Easy and quick

I liked it, I liked all ingredients but the kraut, or maybe because it was the supermarket brand canned stuff.  I am 37 years old and never had sauerkraut, my hubby had and likes "Rachels" so I tried it....he said it was just ok, he thought it was the type of kraut too.  But all other ingredients were good, I ate the other 1/2 of mine without the kraut and liked it.  Maybe its just me, is there a brand of kraut I should use instead of the other stuff?

A basic recipe for a "rachel".  It is what it is.  Everything turned out wonderfully.  I used Boar's Head brand deli pastrami, kraut, and Swiss cheese (thicker sliced, one slice/sandwich) and lite 1,000 Island dressing (no sacrifice in flavor).  Since I controlled the amount of dressing and kraut, the sandwiches did not fall apart like in a restaurant.

Five, because I love Reubens and anyway you grill it is great.  SUGGESTIONS for variety.  I've found that thin sliced honey ham tastes wonderful.  Also, you can use cole slaw instead of sourkrout if you hate the krout.  AND, if you use the slaw and thousand island sauce with a slice of swiss on a hamburger, it is very good -my favorite burger.

A good alternative dinner for hot summers.  I had to substitute mustard instead of Thousand Island and I used canned corned beef since that's what I had on the shelf and this is good too. I put the cheese on a slice of rye, then the sauerkraut (well drained) a squirt of mustard, then topped with the corned beef and the second slice of rye,(this helps keep the bread from becoming soggy) butter the outsides with margarine and pan grill. When I get to town I am going to get the Thousand Island and some Pastrami to try next time! Yummy and so easy with a big dill pickle and potato salad or even a tossed salad.

This is a wonderful sandwich! I had a craving for a Reuben, and bought the pastrami, so I guess it's a "Rachel". I didn't see marbled rye at our local market, so I bought a wonderful Idaho sour dough (yes, Apicella makes a really good sourdough bread). REALLY GOOD GOOD GOOD!

I agree with JB.  A proper Reuben is made with corned beef.  Also very important in making a Reuben that does not fall apart in your hands while eating it:  squeeze, not drain, all possible liquid from the kraut before building the sandwich.  The best kraut I have found is the Clausson brand, sold in jars in the refrigerator case next to their also excellent pickles.

Made this for the bf--I tried a small bite, but wasn't impressed.  Then again, I don't like the meat in this or sauerkraut, so it's not surprising.  Bf liked the sandwich.  I used American cheese and pastrami for this one.  thanks.

The method of cooking this sandwich is right on, but a true Reuben is made with Corned beef, and not pastrami.  For those who don't like the tang of sauerkraut, you might want to drain it well, then saute it for a few minutes in a little butter or oil (maybe like a teaspoon of oil) just until it starts to get a little brown.  Let the kraut cool a bit then assemble the sandwiches. Reubens are wonderful! I've also made these with turkey, and roast beef. Haven't tried ham yet, but that would probably work too.

I love to use pastrami instead of corned beef.  I make them in the toaster oven so it's really fast.  Serve with fries or coleslaw.

I prefer corned beef.  I microwave the sauerkraut to get it hot so cheese melts faster.  I fry the corned beef to get some colour on it and also hot meat helps cheese melt faster.  One of my favourite sandwiches!!

Great taste and easy to make. The only problem I encountered...I only made one sandwich: should have made at least two! Oh, I added a small amount of mustard to accent the kraut.

God bless all you reviewers.  I love Rubens, but wanted to try pastrami this time.  Last restaurant version I tried used Russian dressing instead of 1000Island.  I did not notice anyone commenting on that so will try Russian next time.  I love the cole slaw instead of kraut on the Rachael.  I love the idea of "assemble your own".  I prefer kraut with caraway seed, but none of the family does. I also plan to try the turkey another reviewer suggested. If you don't like kraut, try red cabbage in the jar - not sure of brand name. I agree with one reviewer who recommended Classen brand kraut.  I too cook the kraut, season with a bit of crumbled bacon (not bacon bits) or bacon drippings and diced white onion. I don't care how you fix it, it is mouthwatering delicious.  For me, no sides.  For company, baked beans, German style potato salad, variety of pickles, rings of red onion, brown mustard.

Made this on my panini maker - OUTSTANDING!! I used corned beef and make sure the sauerkraut is drained, otherwise the sandwich will get soggy.  Don't change a thing.  Thanks for the recipe.

It turned out good! I made two different kinds. I was making food for my parents and me, my mom's lotos-intolent, so I made hers with hot mustard,and just a little chese. I made the others with more chese, i picked gouda, which turned out delious with the sandwhich. I also used apple sauerkaaynt, with garlic yogurt dressing, instead of thousand island, because I didn't have any. I used both corn beef and pastrami, three slics each, and sliced them in half ,in triangles. AAfter using on a skill, I baked in the oven. What I'd change next time less gouda, less sauerkraunt, maybe I'd still use apple, but use yogurt sauce with no garlic. Well, other than that, it was perfect! Thanks!

a Rachel is a Rueben with Turkey Pastrami. Not beef pastrami :O)))

A Rueben is with corned beef = less fat...or pastrami = more fat = more flavor...

if you want to add a little zing, put grey poupon on one half and thousand island on the other half.

Simply Delish! This is my favorite sandwich. I'm not sure how DH will react to his reuben being pastrami instead of corned beef though. I think they are fantastic as written, I didn't change a thing. Mmmmm...

Absolutely love this sandwich!  I did make my own thousand island dressing, just using ketchup, mayo, mustard, salt and pepper.  Made it for my friends visiting from France, and they requested it 2 days in a row. So yummy!!

This is the traditional way to do it!  I do make some changes now..I heat the meat and the sauerkraut in the microwave, covered , for a minute or so on high so it will heat the filling and start the cheese melting before it's grilled.  I place the cheese between the meat and the kraut.  I also only put the Thousand Island dressing on the kraut side of the bread and use mustard on the meat side of the bread.. Once ready to cook the sandwich I sometimes use the broiler so I can toast several sandwiches at a time when I need to.  Turning is tricky, I use 2 spatulas so it supports the wide bread better.  I wish they made tongs with wide flat surfaces.!

I made this recipe two times,
 Once in a frying pan and once in my panini press. Both ways yielded perfect results, and took about the same amount of time. I recommend using sliced swiss cheese, and not shredded.  The first time I only had shredded.  It works but is messy and harder to flip. I also recommend putting a slice of cheese on the top and the bottom because the sandwich sticks together better.  We loved this, and I'll make it many times in the future!

I used 3 small slices of rue, they were about half of the size of a regular slice of bread. On 1st slice I put the pastrami on top of the thousand island dressing with sauerkraut on top. On the 2nd sli i put saurkraut. I'm the 3rd slice I placed the Swiss cheese folded in half. Once they are crispy and golden brown take them off of the heat and later them, 1st on bottom, 2nd in the middle and 3rd on top.

Delicious!  We love pastrami and usually just have it on a sub roll with cheese & mustard. We also love a corned beef reuben sandwich. This was the best of both worlds in one. I will definitely make these again!  Thank you for sharing this delicious recipe!

Never had it with pastrami, just corned beef or turkey.  JB-  In my deli experience a Rachel is turkey & cole slaw and is excellent. Michelle H. - cole slaw might be better for people who don't like sauerkraut. You might want to try Bavarian style sauerkraut (my preference), It's a little sweet & less of that vinegar tang. It's sold in jars right next to the regular sauerkraut, around here the brand is "Silver Floss".

I plan to make this again!  Surprisingly easy to make and very good flavor.  The sauerkraut is balanced by the Thousand Island dressing.  *On a short vacation, I had two very good Reuben at different restaurants.  I decided to try and make this at home.   Bought some thinly sliced pastrami and baby swiss at a local Harris Teeter and a cheap can of sauerkraut.  Made on the stove top.

Very Very good Reuben will make it agean. I recommend heating sauerkraut and ham also make sure the kraut is well drained. Dressing put on the side for dipping so each person can control the amount.

Always a great sandwich, and made like this is great. I upgrade mine a tiny bit with a thin slice of sweet onion. Great either way.

I love this sandwich, although, as another reviewer has noted, the pastrami makes it a "Rachel" not a reuben. A reuben is made with corned beef. I think the reuben came first.  The names probably came from the old-time song (which my dear departed grandmother used to sing to me): "Reuben, Reuben."

This was the first time I ever had a reuben sandwich so I can't compare it with others but I'd say this is a very delicious sandwich that packs a lot of flavor.  It takes very few ingredients and is affordable and quick which those on a time and money budget will appreciate.

Yummy.  This was a simple, tasty lunch.  My husband was very skeptical (having never tried a Reuben); he loved it!

I have eaten Reubens in Jewish delis from one end of this country to the other...and this resembles none of them.  I bought the ingredients and made the sandwiches exactly by the recipe instructions and not one of us could make it through half on one sandwich.

This was great! My husband loved it.  I've never had a Reuben before so I had nothing to compare it to, but I would definitely make this again.  Very quick and easy.  I scaled back on the kraut on my sandwich because I'm not a real kraut girl (which is very bad since I'm from Wisconsin!)

My husband loves reubens and he really liked this one.  I never have really cared for them,  but this was good.
