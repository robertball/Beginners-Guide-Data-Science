Very tasty coffee cake, but I made a few changes to the topping in the recipe. I used 1/2 C. of packed brown sugar instead of white sugar, and added 2 Tbsp. melted butter. I found this went better with the cake than a white sugar topping.

This cake was moist and tender, and everyone in the house liked it. It stayed pretty moist the next day, too.  Instead of white sugar I used brown sugar for the streusel and it added just enough sweetness without overpowering the cake. Thanks for a good recipe!

When mixing a cake like this, it's critical to follow the recipe's instructions to "stir" the wet and dry ingredients together, not use the mixer.  Over mixing is a common error with these kinds of cakes (quick breads and muffins, too), and that leads to a tough and therefore dry cake (bread, muffin).  That may be the reason some of the other reviewers' cakes were not as moist. Hope this helps.

Absolutely delicious!!! I made this 3 time's now and it was the best I've ever made. 
Very moist and raised really nice.. 
The first time I made it I made it exactly the way it was posted. (wonderful)
Then the last two time's I added 2 med. size banana's... It was so good that way.. Everyone was asking for the recipe..

One time I made it I didn't have any sour cream so I added sour milk.. It still worked out perfect... 

Give it a try. I'm sure you will love it.

I have tried some coffe cake's and they seem to be a little dry.. This one is not...

Thank you for sharing your recipe with us.....

This is the second time that I have made this and it is FABULOUS!  My husband had been bugging me to make a "koogan" as his family calls it.  I searched for a recipe similar to that of his mother's.  This is the closest according to him.  His Mom used to make hers with Bisquick.  I like this better as is has more of a cake texture and that hint of sweet.  I used brown sugar and pecans for my "swirl" mix and it is sooooo good. 

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS RECIPE! Thanks Allison!

P.S.  Just made this AGAIN with walnuts, this is so delicious.  I can't rave enough about it!

Now I know why I choose allrecipe.com recipes that are rated with 5 stars.  This coffee cake is over the top!  I was in a pinch and needed to make a breakfast treat with ingredients that I had in the frig and pantry.  This coffee cake is moist, tasty, sweet, crispy on the top side and rises to a beautiful height.  It tops my mother-in-law's coffee cake by a mile but we will keep that to ourselves.  Just yesterday I made a third one (in 2 months) and added a tbsp more of sour cream.  Wow is this a moist cake. I cooked it only 50 minutes and its even more moist than the last 2!  My husband is swimming one mile four times a week just to enjoy a slice (or two) each day.  My four year old daughter finally loves walnuts thanks to this recipe.  Now we are going to try it again but add chocolate chips!  Make this recipe and you'll keep those who love you loving you!

I substituted yogurt and vinegar for the sour cream and the cake came out great.  I liked the addition of the walnuts, althought if I was to make this recipe again I'd add the walnuts to a more traditional struesel topping because the top was a bit dry for my taste.

This cake was just O.K. for me. I used brown sugar instead of white for the filling as suggested by other reviewers and it was not sweet enough for me. I also found that it was over-baked after 50 minutes - the outside crust was quite hard. I may try this again though, with a few changes - I will bake it for 40-45 minutes at 300 degrees and add a glaze over top.

Okay, so i've been given the asignment of making the coffee cake for Christmas morning with my boyfriend's family. I saw this recipe and decided to do a trial run. I baked it in a in a 9x13" pan since I didn't have the bundt pan and didn't layer it. I made the batter as directed but made a slight change to the topping. I added a little more walnuts than called for and about 3T of flour. I then added very thin slices of butter sprinkled over the topping. I took half of the cake with us to his parents house this weekend and my boyfriend and his dad each had 3 slices! Neither of them have major sweet tooths so I took that as a good sign. The only other change i'll make next time is to add more cinnamon. Thanks for the GREAT recipe!

This was an excellent tasting recipe! The only reason i didn't give it 5 stars was because it was a very crumbly. I will make it again though. the taste is awesome.

It was amazing, very moist and delicious. I used half of the recommended sugar to make it less sweet.

I made this recipe for the first time today and was very very disappointed. The batter looked like frosting and I had a hard time pouring it into the pan. Once cooked and cooled, the cake fell into pieces when I sliced it. I didn't like the taste of it either. Definitely not a keeper, sorry.

Quite good.  I halved the recipe, put it in a bread pan, and cooked it between 35 and 40 minutes, checking it with a toothpick as it cooked.  Turned out nice and moist on the inside while crunchy on the sides - yummy.

The cake came out great.  I'd say more than 12 servings though.  The a brown sugar crumble type topping might be better, the white sugar didn't really melt in and just sort of fell off when it came out.  I'd double the nut/cinnamon/sugar mixture next time.

I made this for after church coffee  time.  Was very good.  I used brown sugar instead of white for the nut mixture.  I didn't have sour cream and used plain Greek yogurt instead. Next time I might put some nut and sugar mixture in bottom of pan, so when I remove cake from pan it will have some crunchies on top.  Will certainly make this again it's very nice not to sweet coffee cake.

It was delicious! But I made a double recipe for the brown sugar and cinnamon and I made two layers of it in the cake. Just used less batter for in between so I'd have some batter for top. When I cut it,it was swirled in the middle so nice. Positively a cake for any cinnamon lover!

My 10 yr old daughter loves to bake and this was a great recipe for her.  We decided to sprinkle all of the walnut mixture between batter layers instead of half for the bottom. So moist and the perfect accompaniment to a cup of coffee to start the day.  Will make this again!

I think the bake time is too long. The cake seemed too dry on the bottom. The top with streusel was still moist and that part was good. If I make it again, I will cut down the bake time. But, honestly, I doubt I will try this recipe again.

What a simple and Sooo Delicious coffee cake! Very moist I did use buttermilk instead of sourcream and used walnuts just what I had on hand! Yummyyyy! Oh and for the nut mixture I used all brown sugar just my own personal preference! I will use this recipe again...

This is a very delicious cake!  My family loves it when they wake up and find this in the kitchen.  I had never experienced moist coffee cake until I stumbled upon this recipe.  The only bad thing about this cake is I can't keep it in the house!

I couldn't keep the compliments from coming! Everyone raved about it! I used a half c. white sugar and a half c. brown sugar. I also doubled the struesal and layered three times in addition to more nuts- once on the bottom of the bunt, once in the middle, and lastly on the top of the bunt. I also used a whole tub of sour cream, maybe 1.5 cups. Very moist, very flavorful, perfect. I was told it tasted like something from our local famous german bakery! 

For my struesal- melt about a half stick of butter, maybe a cup of brown sugar, two tbs flour, and chopped nuts. Mix well, should be fairly dry, but clumps well to the touch.
