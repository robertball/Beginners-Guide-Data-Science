Didn't have puff pastry so I used a crescent roll sheet and made half the recipe using blackberry all fruit spread. Only baked for 25 minutes. Everyone loved it. Very easy and quick.

The whole point of the strudel is the phyllo dough. This is not a French recipe. Strudel is light and airy;  butter rich dough destroys the end product.

This was a very quick and tasty recipe. I cut the recipe in half, which was easy. I did chop up the cherries rather than use them whole. I was concerned about the amount of walnuts, but found that the end result was a nice blend of all of the ingredients and that the walnuts helped cut down on sweetness. I would make it again.

Since my puff pastry had gone bad, I used pie dough and made a galette. It was a big hit at the dinner where I served it.
