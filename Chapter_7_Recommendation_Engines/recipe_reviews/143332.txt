This salsa was very tasty! The roasted peppers made it extra good, and were quite easy to prepare. I used fresh tomato only, and used a whole onion.

Good Flavor.  I will tweek it a little next time to accomodate my own personal tastes.  Less cilantro, a little less beer (gets runny) and a little more salt and lime juice.  I used a variety of peppers and it was pretty HOT. Make sure the peppers are charred so the skin comes off easily.  Addictive.

I really like this salsa. I just finished making it...I haven't added the beer. I bought Tecate and I don't like it at all, so I don't want to ruin the salsa. I used fire roasted canned tomatoes along with fresh tomatoes. Recommend reading how to roast peppers on this site. I didn't and I had a hard time getting the skins off. I also didn't blend the ingredients since I like chunky salsa.

I had to cut down on some peppers for the sake of the kids.  Otherwise we're super pleased.

I would have preferred less a bit less cilantro and a bit more lime juice, but hey, it's great as written!  If anyone is spice shy, be prepared...fabulous for those who like spice, those with milder tendencies might want to omit some of the peppers.
