This is THE gingerbread recipe.  I substituted molasses like others said and it turned out great.  I worked with about a quarter of the dough at a time and rolled it out between two sheets of wax paper; some of the dough I rolled out three times and it was still just as good as the first.  This cookie was very forgiving and I will be making it every Christmas.  I have been looking for a good gingerbread recipe and I have found it!  One note: my mom didn't like the orange flavor (though the rest of us did).  If you want a very traditional recipe substitute molasses for the corn syrup and omit the orange zest.

Pretty, and much lighter in color than my usual gingerbread recipe.  Very tasty, the orange flavor is surprisingly strong but pleasant.  Cookies were fairly easy to roll out, even without chilling.  (I always roll dough between two sheets of wax paper.  I hate scraping.)
NOTE:  For the folks who are having problems with cookies spreading too much, you may be using eggs that are too large.  I bake constantly and I only use large--never extra large.  And with cut-out cookies, sometimes I discard just a little bit of the eggwhite, so that the dough is a little bit drier and easier to roll out.  Hope this helps, because this really is a terrific gingerbread recipe.

Melt in your mouth good! I made some substitutions: molasses for dark corn syrup and lemon zest for orange, and I added a little more ginger.  I read previous reveiws re: the difficulty stirring in the flour so I cut the dry ingredients in with a pastry blender, kneaded it into a ball and it was a breeze.  The kids helped decorate and we shared with neighbours. These cookies will become a Christmas tradition.

Really like the orange zest, subtle and special!    I found that if the dough was rolled to 1/4", I got the aforementioned puffy and delightfully chewy gingerbread boys.  We love cookies moist, so hooray for that!  Then I experimented and rolled the dough thinner, to about 1/8".  These cutouts stayed more true to size, and produced a crispy cookie, suitable for hanging (remember to poke out a hole w/ a straw before baking).         Other notes:  paddle attachment on the Kitchen Aid had no problem mixing everything together.   After only 6 hours chilling in a bowl covered tight with plastic wrap, the dough was rather stiff coming out of the fridge, but that was solved by breaking off chunks, then kneading till pliable.         My first time rolling dough between wax paper... how smart is that (thanks SUGARPLUMSCOOKIES)!  The fourth reroll is good as the first!   Our family doesn't care for icing, but melted white chocolate pipes well for decorating! MMMmmmm... Enjoy!

These were great.  I cut the sugar down to 1 cup of brown sugar. The cookies were plenty sweet so I will probably cut more out next time.  I also subbed in molasses for corn syrup.  Those of you with spreading cookie problems - make sure the dough is cold before you pop them in the oven.  That means once you take the dough out of the fridge - work fast and get them in the oven pronto.

I am not that fond of gingerbread cookies but my son insisted that we make some.  I searched for a good recipe and thought this one sounded good, so we tried it.  It was wonderful!!  I could have just eaten the dough.  But...I did bake them up and every night my two kids decorate one to eat.  However, I prefer my cookies a little chewy so I baked them for only 8 minutes (for a 3"x4" man).  Give it a try. You'll love the orange zest in them!

While the taste of these cookies are execellent (really, they taste great), I had to give the recipe 3 stars. I'm not sure how people can be complaining about this recipe needing less flour as it is completely unusable for cut-outs as is. I ended up adding atleast 1 c. extra flour to keep the cookies from spreading due to the break down of the fat in the recipe (like other reviewers have mentioned). I made enough dough to make a hundred gingerbread men only to find that they spread in the oven into a terrible greasy mess. I then had to add flour to each batch individually to make them usuable. After doing so, the cookies baked beatifully and tasted great. I really hope that this recipe will be updated so that it's great taste wont be overshadowed by it's poor flour ratio. For those looking to still use this recipe for cut-out cookies, continue to add flour(1 cup +) to the dough until it pulls away from the sides of the bowl and it can be handled without sticking to your hands.

I thought I'd try something different this year, since not everyone is crazy about gingerbread men and I feel compelled to make them each Christmas. This recipe was fantastic! The dough worked up as easy or easier than regular gingerbread, they baked light and crispy/chewy, had a beautiful color and a wonderfully light orange taste.  Everyone who tried them loved them. I highly recommend them to anyone who marginally likes gingerbread men!

EXCELLENT gingerbread cookies!  My whole family, from 5 yr old to my teenager, to my husband LOVED them!  I did find chilling them for 2 hrs was NOT enough, as the dough was too soft and they fell apart during transfer to cookie sheet.  I also discovered, through trial and error, that 1/4 inch thick was the best thickness for keeping their shape before baking and still looking like gingerbread boys after baking.  I think rolling them in wax paper is great, but it took me a few times to get the hand of knowing the thickness of the dough while it was between the wax paper.  I'm used to the old flour/rolling pin method and it was a little hard to judge thickness at first, but I do like the wax paper much better.

I found rolling it out THEN refridgerating made the cookie cutter process go much smoother.

All in all, I will HANG ON to this recipe to make again...and again...and again!

These were great! Per others' suggestions, I replaced the corn syrup with 3 Tbsp. molasses for a bit stronger taste. Delicious! I also used melted white chips to frost, rather than royal icing -- much easier and tastier! This is a great recipe for GOOD TASTING gingerbread. So many out there focus on the way they look. These look good, too, but they taste GREAT. Thanks for posting this recipe!

NO SPREAD, PERFECT SHAPE, MIXING, BAKING AND NO-STICK COOKIE CUTTER TIPS. AWESOME!

1)use less butter: 1/2 c butter, melted  for no spread

2)1 1/2 c brown sugar-better color/taste

3) 2 tbsp frozen orange juice concentrate 
- will use 4 tbsp next time.

4) 1/4 c molasses - better color/taste

5) 2 tsp ginger  - for more bite   

6) Stir then hand knead the dough. Knead until smooth. This IS possible. 

7) Divide dough into 3 portions. Use only 1 at a time. Leave others in fridge.   

8) Knead dough until it is no longer cool. When dough becomes the slightest bit tacky, flour hands lightly and continue. When dough is just beyond cool, roll dough immediately.  

9) Roll dough between 2 sheets of wax paper.  Roll dough to 1/8" thickness.  Cookies will bake to 1/4" thick.  

10) Dip cookie cutter in flour to prevent dough sticking to cutter.  Dip spatula in flour when transferring cookies to pan.  

11)Cool baking sheets completely.  outside?  freezer?  eliminates spreading
12) there is not too much flour.  there is too much butter and no mention of hand kneading or using cooled baking sheets

So yummy, very light and tasty with great orange flavor.  I did add some orange juice (about 1/4- 1/2 cup) to the dough during mixing, since it was a little dry for me.. this punched up the orange flavor more than the original recipe.  I also substituted maple syrup for the corn syrup.  These guys did spread out a lot during baking, but the result was a cute, chubby gingerbread man the kids loved decorating.  Too soft to hang on the tree.. just right for eating!  Fine by me!

I really liked this recipe. Im an inexperienced cook and this was one of the first recipes i've tried. I wanted to have an old fashioned christmas so I dedided to make popcorn garland and gingerbread men so this recipe was perfect. I think it was extremely hard to stir in the last 3 cups of flour though, its a lot easier if you mix the ingrediants in a fairly large bowl and knead in the flour.

I did this without the zest and exchanging the syrup for molasses as others have suggested.  I was using smaller shapes than a traditional gingerbread children so I reduced the time to 8 min. I made the recipe twice: once so I could grind it in a processor for a crust/parfait layer and once as cookies to decorate the top of the parfaits.  My husband who normally could care less about gingerbread kept coming into the kitchen to steal the warm ones. Let me just say the extras that didn't go on the parfaits FLEW off the plate when I brought them to work and everyone was raving about them afterwards (Nice and crisp but still easy to munch on and not mushy)

I made this recipe exactly as written and like many others, encountered the problem of crumbling dough because the flour ratio is wrong. 

I didn't know how to fix it and I didn't want to just throw everything away so I took a chance and added an extra egg for more moisture. It did the trick!  My Gingerbread Boys came out absolutely perfect: crisp on the outside/chewy on the inside.

Instead of cookie cutters, I used NorPro's gingerbread men cookie pan. Immediately after making the dough mixture, I pressed it into each individual mold of the pan.  And then, I refrigerated the pans for 30 minutes.  That's all it took.

The trick to this seems to be putting COLD dough and a COLD pan into a hot/pre-heated oven.  I baked for 11 minutes and the cookies were perfect.  

For decorations I used white and red icings, white for the eyes and smile ... and red for the three buttons.  They were so darn cute.  Everyone loved them.  

They were also very tasty!  My husband who doesn't even like gingerbread  LOVED these cookies!  It's the orange peel that makes the difference -- and the fact that the ginger is not too overwhelming.

I will definitely make these again!

12.12.13 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/11165/gingerbread-boys/ ... I changed the spices some - 1 1/2t ginger, 1 1/2t cinnamon, 1/8t cloves - & I didn't "do" the orange bit; but I'm still gonna rate it.  Using the spices as I did, it was a very light gingerbread taste.  I don't see how using more cinnamon than ginger would give it a more gingerbread taste (enough to call it gingerbread even).  'Think these are more of a spice cookie.  The cookies are fine, but not exactly a great choice for cutouts - as someone else said.  They aren't bad, but details blur.  Just okay.  I didn't have a problem rolling after refrigerating then letting warm up some.  I subbed honey for dark corn syrup.  If you like the light taste (& color btw), maybe just "log" it & slice.  :) A few days later:  Just told by the 14yr old boy, I'd have to make 'em again.  :?  Really?!?  Guess I'll be the one using the log & roll tip!  :D  (Oh, used a simple vanilla glaze with 'em - tasted like the cinnamon roll frosting from Pillsbury)  To sum it up, three stars from me; but up to four since the kids actually had a positive comment.  :D  Big news - well, kind of - there's no need to grease the pan.  The flour will keep them from sticking.  Greasing the pan will make them spread more. Note4Me:  NINJAbread boys - :)  By scent, predominant ginger. Can't tell cinnamon really. no molasses, but dark corn syrup

These are difficult to roll out. The flavor is really good but it needs more ginger and at least 3 Tbsp real molasses instead of 2 Tbsp corn syrup to make it more like gingerbread. 
Overall I wouldn't throw the recipe away because it tastes great. But I would use a different recipe if you want to use cookie cutters.

Loved love loved the flavor! But they spread and you coudn't tell what the shape was supposed to be. Maybe they got too warm prior to baking I don't know, but I ended up just making them into circles after the first batch because they spread so much they looked like ginger bread mutants or aliens not boys! I still recommend the recipe though because of the great flavor, not so overpowering like a lot of gingerbread recipes.

Amazing cookies! You will probably need a lot of flour for your counter top. When I only "lightly" floured my counter, the dough stuck something awful. I had to scrape it off with a spatula and re-knead it. It worked well with lots of flour which I brushed off the cookies before I put them on the tray. These would be good with more ginger, especially if you like your cookies spicy. I subbed applesauce for half the butter and everything worked fine! As other reviewers suggested, I used molasses instead of the corn syrup, which I believe is essential to a good gingerbread cookie. Thanks for a great recipe!

As someone who isn't a big fan of gingerbread, this recipe completely won me over. I substituted molasses for corn syrup and didn't have any ground cloves, but it was still delicious! Roll the dough thin or thick depending on how chewy/crispy you want them. Mmm. The whole house smelled like Christmas :)

This was a very good tasty recipe. It isn't the best in the world for making gingerbread houses though and I was far less delighted in how much the cookies swelled and cracked. But if you know how to handle dough and when and when not to work in extra flour it is good for a pinch. Check out my gingerbread house to get an idea.

Great flavor!  Beware of rolling them too thin!  Err on the side of too thick because too thin is way to crispy; as I learned the hard way.  Even though mine came out too crispy, the flavor was on point.

This is a truly excellent recipe.  The amount of orange zest is just perfect for a hint of citrus along with the spice.  I rolled out and baked on parchment paper - easy peasy - and decorated with Sugar Cookie Icing from this site.

I often shy away from Gingerbread because they are typically very hard cookies. The flavors are often a bit bold for the kids in my family. That being said, this recipe is the exception; very easy to make and they comes out chewy rather than hard. We now make these every Christmas season!

These cookies were good. I substituted half of the flour with whole wheat pastry flour, half the butter for margarine (for softer cookies), molasses for corn syrup (all out) and used lemon zest instead of orange (didn't have any). The texture was a little crumbly, but the cookies rolled out okay. The flavor is nice and spicy -- probably more so than the original recipe due to the molasses. The biggest problem I had was that the temperature written in the recipe was too hot at 375 degrees and the time was too long at 13 minutes. My first batch was burnt -- not a pleasant smell, let me tell you. I baked the second batch at 350 for 11 minutes and they came out crispy around the edges and a little soft in the middle. The cookies do spread a lot so you want to leave space between the cookies (In the burnt batch there were plenty of little gingerbread heads fused to gingerbread crotches -- funny, but not exactly Christmas-y). I will continue my search for the perfect gingerbread recipe.

I love that the dough popped right out of the cookie cutter and I didn't have to reshape deformed cookies on the sheet!  The  dough holds up great, is very managable and sturdy.  I subbed molasses for corn syrup and will next time add an extra Tbsp, as there wasn't quite enough bite for me.  Decorated with Royal Icing I.

These cookies are fantastic!!  The orange zest really adds flavor and depth.  The only change I did was to substitute molasses for the cornsyrup.  MMMM!!!

I thought that these cookies tasted good, I like the hint of orange and the fact that they don't need to be frosted.  The dough was especially hard to work with as it wanted break up when I tried to roll it out.  If I attempted them again I would start with a little less flour.

I've been making Gingerbread Men for over 30 years.I thought I'd try something new this year.I followed everything to the letter.My little niece & I brought the dough out of the fridge one Saturday morning to begin. All I can say is that these are awful !!! They spread all over the pan & make a total mess.They don't taste that great either.I'll never make them again.

This recipe rocks.  I'd never made gingerbread before, and not only was this really easy, but the results were delicious  - a new favourite, and appeals to both traditional gingerbread fans and those who like cookies but not necessarily traditional gingerbread!  Light texture, beautifully spiced, easy to work with and roll out, and the orange peel is a wonderful touch. I substituted brown Demerara sugar for the white sugar and it worked out really well.  To answer some earlier comments:  a) to roll out after chilling, I found I had to cut the dough into quarters then the small pieces were easier to roll out (while still chilled); b) I had to watch not to roll these too thin (not less than 1/4 in.), and to watch the time and not bake longer than 10 min., or they would singe or get too "crispy" (overdone); c) also by rolling out and using the cookie cutters on only a quarter of the dough at a time, it mostly avoided the problem of the dough getting too warm and soft to roll out/cut since you were always working with dough that was still a bit chilled up until the last few cuts.

THE BEST 4 STARS GINGERBREAD COOKIE RECIPE EVER ! I must of read/reviewed and tasted over 100s of these GB recipes from friends and family over a couple of years and I almost gave up trying out my own. I give this first batch 4 stars only because it was abit bland for me and my husband but perfect for my toddlers.

A holiday must in my house! We make these each year, no matter where we are staying (I've even brought the supplies when we've gone vacationing in a cabin or condo over Christmas break!) I send some to family out of state because everyone likes them so much! I sub molasses and cut down the sugar as others have suggested. My favorite way to enjoy is without any decorations, early in the morning with a hot cup of coffee. Preferably with carols playing in the background.

Delicious.  These cookies turned out great.  Omitted the orange zest and used half brown sugar and half white sugar.  Nice and subtle spice flavour that seemed to get more intense as they sat.  My brother who does not like gingerbread devoured four of these in one sitting.

This was my first time making gingerbread anything, so I wasn't sure what to expect.  I ended up refrigerating the dough close to 24 hours simply because I had a lot of cookies to bake over the weekend.  
The cookies turned out delicious, not too crispy and just plain wonderful!  All the reviews that complained about them spreading out?!  I didn't have any issue with that AT ALL.  They stayed true to form and the only thing I will do differently is roll the dough out a little thicker.  But even thin, they taste wonderful!
GREAT RECIPE!

My daughter informed me at the last minute that she wanted to take gingerbread men to school for her Christmas party...and I "hate" gingerbread nearly as much as I hate trying to roll out cookie dough.  NEVER FEAR!!  These cookies mix and roll out like a dream!  And the bit of orange zest really adds another dimension to the flavor.  I can't wait to eat one of these babies with a cup of tea.  I followed the recipe as written with 3 small exceptions:  used light corn syrup instead of dark, chilled dough in fridge for only 3 hours, and baked for only .  They did spread a bit while baking, but the taste was good enough to overlook that!  Used Janice's Sugar Cookie Icing on this site with geat success too! Thanks Janice! Edited 1/12/06 to say that although these cookies are delicious, I have decided that they just spread way too much for cut-out cookies.  I make them into logs and chill the dough, then "slice & bake" for a nice treat.

This is the best gingerbread recipe I have ever tasted or baked.  Prior to this receipe, I had not been a fan of gingerbread but baked it for my youngest child.  This year when I volunteered to make 9" cookies for decorating in school I decided it was time for a new recipe. This one mixed up wonderfully and everyone, I mean everyone loved the flavor.  I found by slightly melting the butter (rather than just softening it) I didn't have a problem mixing in all the flour. I and 26 kids thank you!

A good recipe for people who don't like gingerbread. I live in Hong Kong and 
this is the only gingerbread cookie recipe I've found that many family and 
friends actually like - not too spicy for local tastes but just spicy enough for a 
gingerbread cookie lover. The orange peel is the trick, I think...

This is my first experience making gingerbread cookies and I was pleasantly surprised. I was dubious while preparing the dough, because it seemed so light in color, so I made a test cookie before chilling. At 9 minutes I had a wonderful lite cookie that was golden around the edges and slightly chewy in the middle. Yum! ...I don't have kids to test on, but I think they would like this recipe.

I loved the flavor of these boys.  However they were really flat, too crisp, and didn't hold the shape very well.  I think next time I'll bake them at a little lower temperature.  Any other advice to solve this problem?

Fantastic gingerbread taste (I, too, substituted molasses for corn syrup).  Light and perfect.  For chewy cookies, roll 1/4" at least, for crisp, roll thinner.  I found they were perfect at 8 minutes.  I'm throwing away all my other gingerbread recipes.  This will be my go-to recipe from now on for the taste alone!

Great recipe! I substituted 3 Tbs. molasses for the corn syrup, as others suggested. They didn't plump up as much as some cookies do, so you have to roll the dough a little thicker if you want a thicker cookie. Also, they spread out quite a bit, so you have to allow extra space between the cookies when you place them on the pan. This will be my go-to gingerbread cookie recipe from now on. Thank you!

This is the first time I have ever made ginger bread men. This dough is very easy to make but is rock hard as soon as it comes out of the fridge also, when it becomes soft its simply too fragile!!! You'll need to roll the dough out between two sheets of baking paper to make your life easy. Next time I make this I will add in a little less sugar and a little less bi-carb cause I could slightly taste the bitterness from the bi-carb when they came out of the oven. Other than all this the cookies were wonderful... crispy just the way I like them. Made a heart shaped one for our anniversary, my boyfriend liked it!!!

So delicious. It really helps to only have the dough out right before rolling and cutting and to keep it in the fridge for as long as possible in between. It really helps to keep the dough moldable and keep its structure while baking.

Really yummy! I used black strap molasses instead of the corn syrup and it definitely helped the flavor. Skipped the orange because we don't like that.

This is the best gingerbread cookie recipe I have ever made.  I subsituted molasses for the dark corn syrup like other reviews suggested and they turned out great. I didn't have any orange but I added extra cloves and they had a nice spicy flavor.  They were the only thing that ran out at my parent's Christmas party... people couldn't stop grabbing them!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Wow!  We made these more just because of Christmas, Santa, etc... but my husband and I tasted them and decided they were the best Gingerbread Man cookies we have ever had.  The only modification we made was 1 T molasses in lieu of 1 T of corn syrup.  The dough worked very nicely.  These will definitely not go to waste!

I have a delicious gingerman recipe that I have used year after year, but after reading these glowing reviews, I had to try this one.    Hmmm...not sure what the fuss is about.  The taste is very good, but I half'd the recipe and am baking them now.  The taste is OK, but they spread so much that they lose their shape in baking.  The dough becomes too soft to work with very quickly, so I am constantly putting it back into the fridge and having to wait to roll out more than 2 pans of 6.  I have also had to cut the oven temp and time way back.  The original recipe says 190 C, but I cut it back to 180 when the first pan came out almost burned.  I also cut the time back to 6-8 minutes.  To be fair, I'll try this again with the measurements as listed, but am not convinced that I will see different results.

Review by Owen 6 years old "These are awesome cookies" with a little wiggly dance that goes with the awesome rating.     Having never made shape cookies before i found it a little tricky but they are tasty.

I actually altered this recipe to make for a vegan friend.  I replaced the butter for dairy free spread and used no-egg egg replacer.  They turned out  perfect and many vegan/vegetarian friends didn't believe they were vegan.  Four pointers: 1. If using egg replacer, because this is a very soft dough I would recommend minimising the water you use to mix with the powder.  2. Also I refrigerated the dough overnight, but still kept portions in the freezer as I was rolling them to ensure they were ultra chilled and as firm as they could be.  3. Don't be put off by soft dough, they are perfect and worth the difficult handling, if you add too much extra flour...THEY WILL BE FLOURY! 4. Finally, I am impatient and clumsy so instead of using a rolling pin, I used a tortilla press and two sheets of baking paper to 'roll' the dough.

Made a double batch for a cookie exchange and got rave reviews. Modified the recipe as follows: used half brown sugar, half white sugar, didn't have an orange so used orange juice instead of orange zest, used fancy molasses instead of corn syrup, and decreased the cloves by 1/4 tsp, increased cinnamon by 1/4 tsp. The consistency of this dough is great for rolling out - very easy to work with.  A double batch will fit fine in a Kitchenaid mixer. Use the flat beater on speed 2 or 3. Made me 88 medium sized gingerbread men. These are some of the best tasting gingerbread I've ever had.

Yes, these are the best gingerbread cookies I've ever eaten as well.  I needed a recipe without molasses and with all the ingredients already in my cupboard.  I substituted honey for the corn syrup, and substituted allspice for the cloves.  Fantastic scent filled the house as they were baking.  You can stop the baking anywhere between 4-6 minutes, with 4 minutes being a light coloured softer cookie which still keeps its shape, and 6 minutes being quite a dark gingerbread shade of brown and stiffer, but still chewy.  They didn't keep their shape very well, despite chilling overnight and putting in the oven still cold, but they puffed out--hope that wasn't because of the honey.  Rolled the dough between two sheets of wax paper and baked on parchment paper.  After a few days of refrigeration, the dough was quite hard and crumbly, but I eventually was able to roll it out as it warmed up.  Was worried it had dried up, but that wasn't the case.  Was just as delicious.  For icing sugar, used the recipe in the video on gingerbread cookies and it was the best icing I ever used, better than Royal Icing on this website.  I refrigerated the leftover icing and it heated up well with body warmth.  Put the icing in sandwich baggies and squeezed out a tiny corner hole.  Easy for the kids to use.

Exactly what I wanted.  Nice soft cookies if you roll them thicker or nice crispy cookies if you roll them thinner.  Dough does NEED to be chilled.

The children and I made these for Christmas 08 after my DD10 kept asking to make gingerbread. Having no recipe from scratch, I turned to here. These were great! The only thing we omitted was the ground cloves because I didn't have any - other than that, and the fact that I left the dough in the fridge for 2 days instead of a few hours to chill, they were not much variation from the original. They were sweet but not over-powering, and nice and crispy. Word to the wise - the "boys" spread out while baking, so leave plenty of room on the pan between boys or they will blend into one another, take it from me, LOL.

Got rave reviews from my Grandma, and she's extremely picky!  Though they did spread a bit much, so I'm going to reduce the egg a lil bit as another reviewer had suggested.

Great!  For our own preference, I used half King Arthur white/whole wheat flour, and half King Arthur unbleached all-purpose.  I used 1 cup organic white sugar, and 1/2 cup regular golden brown sugar.  Grandma's molasses instead of dark corn syrup.  And I divided the batch into 3, made into disks, wrapped in plastic wrap and chilled for 2 hours.  Easy to roll, perfect soft texture, mild flavor.  I would prefer them spicier, but they're good as is too.

Very tasty, and so easy to make!  Rolled out like a charm, no cracks or anything, which for me is a great accomplishment!  The orange zest definitely gives them wonderful flavor.  Perfect amount of spices too.  Delicious and fool proof.

My kids were eating these cookies as fast as I was making them!  I did leave out the orange zest due to allergies, and I substituted molasses for the corn syrup.  I used half butter and half vegetable shortening, and I used liquid egg substitute instead of the regular egg.  The result was the best gingerbread cookies I have ever made!  Absolutely fabulous!

While the taste and consistency were terrific, I had such a difficult time rolling the dough because it was so sticky.  Also, the cutouts spread a little bit so they weren't as cute as another recipe.  I really want to make these again and I'm hoping that someone can tell me what I can do to make the dough more cooperative.  I would've added more flour, but the previous reviews kept complaining that they were having a hard time working in so much flour.

These were good but need more spice flavor. I even added nutmeg and cardamon and doubled the molasses ( instead of corn syrup). I loved the dough. It was very easy to work with. They just didn't taste like a GINGERbread cookie. I'll keep looking for the perfect one for me. Sorry.

I made ninjabread cookies (using ninja cookie cutters) with this recipe, and they were cute AND tasty! I doubled the recipe, used lemon zest instead of orange, molasses instead of corn syrup, used less cinnamon as I ran out, and added a good amount of freshly grated nutmeg. For the simple decorations, I used meringue powder mixed with a bit of water and used a small Ziploc bag for piping. Super easy and fast!

I made this with xylitol and agave nectar instead of sugar and corn syrup. It turned out great. Quite delicious. The batter was a little dry but I haven't tried the recipe "as is" yet to compare, to see if the substitution was the culprit. Will be using this recipe for Christmas gifts so hopefully will be able to compare soon.

Got a lot of rave reviews, lots of people asked to take them home.  Made for our Oktoberfest party in heart shapes.  Put them out undecorated and left icing with them and kids had a great time decorating the cookies themselves...kept them busy!  Like others, I left out the orange zest and corn syrup, but added 3 tablespoons molasses.

They were ok for me.  I found the orange flavor a little overpowering and somewhat unexpected in a ginger bread cookie.  Texture was good although I should have minced my zest more as sometimes I found it obvious in the batter.   I have an orange oil from WilliamsSonoma that I would use instead next time or half the amount of zest.   Still a good cookie.

This was, ok. I wasn't a fan of the orange flavor, I felt that it overpowered the ginger I wanted to taste. Others that tried it liked it though.  The baking temp and time was off and the dough spread during baking so it lost it's shape. I had to adjust the temp to 250°F and baked for 8-10 minutes, otherwise it came out slightly burnt.

"a hint of orange."   Actually the orange is totally overwhelming. It kids cereal. I wanted to make gingerbread cookies, instead I made orange flavored cookies..  the orange zest should be greatly lessened or optional.... also not enough dark syrup or spice in this recipe. I do not understand why this recipe got such high ratings unless its by people who dont like real gingerbread cookies. My husband liked them anyways, although I wasnt really in the mood for orange flavored cookies :(

These cookies turned out perfect.  The dough was a little crumbly, but it rolled out fine.  The cookies are light and full of flavor, but not too spicy.  Highly recommend this recipe exactly as it is written.

I usually don't care for gingerbread men, but the orange flavor really sets it off. I used 1/4 tsp orange extract (since I didn't have an orange on hand) and it was just the right amount of flavor, light and complimentary. I added 1 tsp vanilla extract, and 1/2 tsp Frangelica (hazelnut-flavored liquer). I used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup homemade brown sugar, used molasses instead of corn syrup, and used whole wheat flour as I find it tends to have a bit of a sweeter taste. I will make these every Christmas from now on.

This is the gingerbread recipe my Mother first started using in the early 1960's!  Since then, we have made them every year at Christmas.  They do spread somewhat when cooked, but I'd take taste over looks any day!

i used 1 c white sugar, and .5 c brown sugar (b/c i ran out of white). seems fine. i subbed molasses for dark corn syrup. i also left out cloves. i might have rolled out too thin, b/c they were done after 8 mins. when i made them thicker, and let the dough warm up, the men bloated.

Gingerbread fail. I followed the directions exactly. Actually used less orange zest, and it still completely overpowered the taste. Also, it was way to dry. I actually had to butter my hands and roll it to be halfway decent. Sorry.

These are great! The only thing is mine cracked on top. Not smooth like everyone else. I didn't refridgerate dough first. I also use granulated sugar. Maybe I should use cane sugar.

This was my first time making gingerbread and I found this recipe to be a good starting point. I wanted a more traditional taste, so I used 2tbs molasses and no orange zest and also omitted the cloves because I didn't have any. It might be my oven, but I baked my first batch for 9 minutes at 375 and the burnt BAD...so I did the rest fr about 6 minutes and they turned out firm but still a little chewy. Good spicy (spice-y?) flavor, not terribly strong so I may add more ginger and cinnamon next time. Or maybe just go buy the cloves lol...This recipe made 36 large star shaped cookies so I'm not convinced it would make SIXTY men unless they were very tiny...but overall this is a great starter recipe.

Great tasting recipe. Like others, I used molasses instead of corn syrup (because that's all I had). I also cut down the recipe to only make 20 cookies and that worked out well. I really like the "light" taste. They remind me of a gingersnap cookie. My whole family enjoyed them. Thank you!

Trying this new recipe as my old gingerbread men recipe leaves me disappointed. This was very nice; my substitutions were brown sugar for the white, molasses for the corn syrup, and omitted the orange. Next time I will cut the sugar - still very sweet. But 5 stars nonetheless. Thanks!!

My 7 year old is going to review for me. The gingerbread boys were good and we only chilled in freezer for 20 minutes.They were the best gingerbread I ever had!!  I can't wait to make and review more cookies.

I too substituted molasses for the corn syrup and left out the orange zest (just didn't have any).   These cookies are yummy but if you want them to keep their shape then roll them quite thin.

This was my first attempt at making gingerbread cookies. I was alittle worried about the dough it was so sticky and soft. i wrapped my dough in plastic wrap that was sprayed with pam and let sit over night. I found you need to have your cutting board really well floured as to stop the dough from sticking. I divided the dough into pieces and kept what I was not using in the freezer. These turned out great and I got about 4 dozen. My boyfriend enjoyed them and so did his co-workers. will def. use this easy recipe again

Soft and chewy...couldn't eat eat them fast enough! I substituted molasses for corn syrup, and made one batch with orange zest and one batch without.  Big difference in taste! I liked both, but feel omitting the orange zest leaves you with a more traditional gingerbread flavor.  Rolling the dough out was a pain even with wax paper.  I found it easier to flatten the dough with my hands after dividing into about 4 parts. My daughter loved helping decorate them. Thanks!!

This was an absolutely fantastic gingerbread cookie recipe.  I did use the molasses instead of the corn syrup, eliminated the orange zest, and added a little more ginger, but it turned out fabulous.  My cooks (ie. the kids) kept wanting to eat them when they came out.  Other recipes I have tried the cookies broke or were bland.  This one, they all stayed together and tasted great!

This recipe is awesome!!! Highly recommended it! I made them for the first time on 12/17, for my daughters class to decorate the next day.  Rave reviews from all of the kids, and adults too!  I followed the recommendation, doubled the recipe, and used orange juice instead of orange zest, half dark brown sugar and half white sugar, didn't have dark corn syrup and stores were out, so used half light corn syrup and half mild molasses.  I also added half a tablespoon of vanilla (kids love it).  The dough came out perfect to work with.  Wouldn't chill it overnight though, maybe just two hours.  Rolling it to 1/4" thick worked perfect for cookies sturdy enough to decorate and soft enough to eat. Thanks for the recommendations!!! We are making another batch this evening, will try adding mini chocolate chips - kids want to know what gingerbread chocolate chip cookies will taste like... :)  Happy Holidays!

Great recipe. I thought it wasn't going to turn out b/c the dough was very crumbly after being chilled.  But you have to be patient and let the dough warm up, then knead it to get it back into shape.

I didn't follow this recipe to the T, but the cookies turned out really well. What I did want to comment on was that I used the frozen drum of my ice cream maker to re-chill the dough scraps and keep the dough I wasn't using cold. It saved a lot of time, re-chilled everything quickly, and I didn't have to open my freezer 50 times.  What did I change: 1 1/2 dark brown sugar instead of white, and added 1 tsp of cardamom.

Delicious! I did omit the orange zest and substituted 3T of molasses, as some reviews suggested. I had no trouble rolling these out w/ my non-stick rolling pin and at 8-9 minutes in the oven, they came out chewy and delicious. I find that using parchment paper works perfectly. I might add some extra clove or perhaps some black pepper next time, just to amp up the spice factor, but this is a great standard recipe that I have made multiple times already!

Excellent recipe - first time making Gingerbread and I was very nervous but it was very easy.  My 3 and 5 year olds were able to help!  Do recommend the two changes everyone else has mentioned: substitute 3T molasses for dark corn syrup, and definitely recommend waxed paper vs. flour for rolling out. Really enjoyed these cookies!  Thank you!

We had fun with these Gingerbread Boys!  We personalized all the cookies when we decorated them and became attached to them, which made us hesitant to eat them.  But, as you can guess, we overcame that obstacle rather quickly--they were delicious, may they rest in peace.

These are fantastic.  Was making memories for my little ones baking, not expecting much from the end result.  But these are amazing. They are the perfect balance of sweet and spicy.  They are chewy and just great.  I used only half the orange, didnt taste it at all. Used a little extra ginger.  Baked 6 minutes.  Frosted with gingerbread frosting on this site with the cloves, etc.  These are some of the best cookies we have ever made!

In general I'm not a fan of gingerbread cookies so I thought I'd be safe with these. Make no mistake, I caught myself sneaking bites of the dough and even caught myself nibbling on a gingerbread man's leg at one point. They're just that addicting! This isn't your regular Gingerbread cookie recipe, it's so much better. 

Some pointers - The recipe yields 60 cookies, I got about about 40 using cookie cutters that were a little on the bigger side. I ended up using less orange zest than called for as only had one orange - if you want the full 1-1/2 tbsp you'll need to use at least 2 regular sized oranges. I found it was a tad bit difficult to mix and thought I added too much flour at first, but in the end it all worked out.

The good part: the flavor of these cookies is AWESOME! Even my husband who doesn't like gingerbread liked these cookies. I made some changes as suggested by other posters. I used less butter (1/2 cup melted at first), molasses instead of corn syrup and more ginger than called for in the recipe. I did use the orange zest (bought a bottle) and would suggest NOT leaving it out. The orange flavor probably is what makes these cookies taste so special. I frosted them with a basic vanilla/butter cream frosting and then decorated.... very YUMMY and a HIT at a Christmas party this morning! The bad part: DO NOT refrigerate this dough for longer than an hour. I refrigerated it overnight as called for and it was HARD as a ROCK the next day. I had to wait an hour at room temp to roll the dough out. The dough was WAYYYY too sticky and CRUMBLY. It was almost unusable until I added some more melted butter (1/2 cup more). Maybe if I had used the whole cup of butter at first (and maybe with corn syrup and not molasses) the dough wouldn't be so crumbly, I don't know. The dough rolled out and baked very UGLY. There were cracks all through the cookies. I was going to frost them before decorating so it didn't bother me but it would be a problem if I wasn't going to cover them with frosting. I don't think the intention was to have ugly, cracked looking cookies so I'm not sure what happened here. Bottom Line: The flavor was so addictive and good that I wouldn't throw this recipe out just yet. I woul

These were delicious and so crisp. I did substituted molasses in for the corn syrup. The orange zest adds just enough zip to the cookies. Wonderful recipe.

I really liked these and changed them just a little.  I, too used molasses instead of corn syrup.  I don't recommend omitting the orange zest, but I only used about 1 1/2 teaspoons.  It does come through and tastes great!  Also, I made the frosting from the "Sugar Cookie Frosting" recipe and used orange juice instead of all milk in the recipe.  My husband/I both thought these were fabulous!

After I got these cookies to work, they became one of my favorites. However, it took three batches before they were enjoyable. This recipe is absolutely unusable with it's current flour content and cooking time; I ended up having to use another whole cup of flour, and decreased baking time to about eight minutes. The flavor of the dough, however, is incomparable. The combination of light orange flavor and spices were a delicious combination, and I didn't miss the molasses at all.

Great recipe. I followed the directions exactly. The only thing I would change is rolling them out a little thinner. They rise a lot. Also they were done in about 8 mins. But I loved the flavor and the hint of orange.

This recipe is awesome. I made the dough with my kids this morning and let it sit in the fridge for about 2 hours. It rolls out beautifully and  does not spread when baking.  The flavor is mild and all of my kids liked the dough and the cookies.  I did add a splash of vanilla and used nutmeg instead of cloves. Thanks for the new recipe we will use for years to come!!!

The taste of these is delicious, but alas, as was the case with many reviewers, mine puffed up and spread out, making gingerbread blobs rather than boys.  I followed the advice to use smaller eggs, I refrigerated, and still was left disappointed.  As I said, they taste great, but failed to hold cookie shapes true to form.

Yes, I have to agree that this recipe is a good one. I made some substitutions: used orange juice instead of the zest, and molasses instead of dark corn syrup. You couldn't really taste the orange flavor, but they turned out well anyway. I'd like to remind future users to not roll the dough too thin, as this makes the cookies too crisp and easy to burn. Good luck!

Thinking I knew better, I didn't space the cookies enough. SPACE THEM!
Other than that, they're great. Israel's supermarkets do not offer corn syrup, so I used honey instead. Thought the orange peel really added something extra. V. good recipe.

I made this recipe as is and it was way too dry. The taste was delicious and I actually ate the dough uncooked-yum!
I was able to piece together several gingerbread men but they were not as many as I needed for my daughter's kinder class. Next time, I will reduce the amount of flour and I'm sure they'll be fine. The few that did come out were delicious. Definitely will be making again with adjustments.

The absolutely best ever gingerbread cookies!  The addition of orange zest is culinary genius, it really does set the cookie apart.  I also substituted molasses for the corn syrup. The only other thing I did differently was to cut the butter in half and add one more egg.  I thought that might help the spreading problem other reviewers had written about.  It didn't.  They do spread, be warned and pick a very simple cookie cutter design and space them out well on the cookie sheet.  Or roll them into little balls and moosh them flat a little- they make beautiful gingersnaps that way.

I used this recipe to make gingerbread men with my 5 year old grandson so he could take them to school. I found the recipe fairly easy to make, however, on the second batch I decreased the flour to 2 2/3 cups to make it easier to work with.  I also baked them for about 6-8 minutes to make a chewy cookie.  Both batches were delicious.  My grandson loved helping.

It tasted good, but after I made it the dough was very crumbly. I refrigerated it overnight, and it became too sticky to handle. I put some flour in it and kneaded it until it was greatly combined. It still wasn’t enough. I decided to refrigerate it for 2 hours and it then became too crumbly again. I retraced my steps to make sure I didn’t miss anything and I was sure I had everything. I just decided to lightly moisten the dough and cook it. And it seemed to work better. :)

Oh my goodness, these are a-maze-ing! I'm not a huge cookie fan, but these are yummy. The touch of orange makes them addicting. I used brown sugar instead of white and added more ginger (another tsp), and did everything else the same. Put in the freezer for about 30 mins and cut in quarters, taking one out at a time. Rolled between waxed paper (genius!!) about 1/4" thick. They're sweet enough that they don't need frosting.

This recipe is really great. I have made both with and without the orange zest, and have found that the zest really adds a nice touch and flavor. I made these a few Christmases ago, and then again for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day. He loved them!

This has been my go to recipe for the past 5 years.  I love the crisp gingerbread cookies and the orange zest adds an extra something.  I make exactly as written and have always had good results.  The kids are making some now to frost later for Santa.

Excellent! The best Gingerbread I have tasted, since it not very gingerbready, instead it is sweeter. My kids loved them.

Wow, these are wonderful, crisp and chewy at the same time. The orange peel adds so much to the spices.  I too made a few changes, mainly using dark molassas and about 1/4 tsp. more of cinnamon. I used a pumpkin cookie cutter and made them for my grandkids for haloween.  I will use this again at Christmas for cut out cookies.  Oh I added about 1 tablespoon more molasses and rolled on floured partchment paper.  No problems.

AMAZING flavour and crispy - just how I like it. I rated 4 because it is humid here in Singapore and it is just impossible to cut out the gingerbread men as the dough became sticky fast. So i worked in batches, just enough dough taken out from the fridge to fit one baking tray. 

I rolled out the dough on lightly floured baking paper, pressed down the cookie cutter and before I removed the cookie cutter, I peeled away the extra dough around it. I was left with the gingerbread man and then I transferred that to the baking tray. It's time-consuming but I wouldn't trade the recipe for anything else.

These cookies turn out very tasty, but I recommend 7-8 minutes instead of 10-12.

I love all the reviews! Some hints to make it easier: Roll directly onto a Silpat on your cookie sheet. Use waxed paper to keep it from sticking to your rolling pin. I bought dowels in various diameters and cut them down to the size of my cookie sheet/pastry cloth. I place them on each side, then use them as guides to roll the dough to the proper thickness. 

Cut the cookies out on the Silpat, giving enough space in between for spreading. Pull up excess dough between cookies and reroll again. This way you're not distorting the shape.

For the puffing problem, try using a little less baking soda. I'll have to experiment on how much to reduce it, but I like fat gingerbread men! Hope this helps!

These taste great, but they puffed up so large that it made all the cooke cutting we did worthless. I'll have to find another recipe for cooke cutters!

I am not a huge fan of gingerbread cookies, but I found this recipe to be very delicious and followed it to the letter. I did however find I had  a very difficult time making decent cutouts.  I would definitely make these again.

these are great!  I am not a gingerbread cookie fan but my husband loves them so I decided to make them this year for christmas.   I tried them and they are fantastic, great dipped in a cup of milk or by themselves.  I did however use the molasses as recommended by other reviews.

Thanks so much for the great recipe!  Made them today and substituted molasses for the dark corn syrup.  I didn't have time to grate for the orange zest but they were delicious without.  A big hit with the adults and children at my Holiday baking party.

My changes- standard high altitude adjustments and I left out the orange zest.

I liked the flavor- some spice but not over powering like some recipes I have tried. I did not have any trouble incorporating or working the dough, but as others have mentioned, these spread a lot. I tried several different layouts on the sheet and sizes of cutters, but could not get it to hold a good shape.

I think these are delicious! I used molassas instead of corn syrup and doubled all the spices. I mixed the dry ingredients together in a separate bowl and then added to the wet. I found them a little hard to roll out, but just have to work it slowly! I brought them to a party and everyone loved them. I did not add the orange because I don't like orange. I will make them again and try to make sheets and make a house!

Best gingerbread cookies ever.  I've made Martha's, Jeff Smith's, and many others. This is my favorite.  I doubled the spices and used the zest of a whole orange. I also replaced the dark corn syrup with molasses.  The end result tastes like those Biscoff cookies you used to get on airplanes.  Perfect with coffee or tea!

Absolutely fantastic! There was a hint of orange, the only thing that I would change is to substitute the dark corn syrup for molases making it just a bit sweeter.  "Visual Impact" also made it easier for me to continue to eat these goodies seeing as I'm getting a little bit sweet myself.  Check out this url and I assure you eating these treats will be easier too http://66284myp-cjepx7hngmkr5iect.hop.clickbank.net/

Very good recipe!!! I'm from sunny Singapore, so the heat n humidity meant I had to chill dough for at least 4-5hrs.   Rolled dough in waxed paper like someone suggested. Then chilled, cut, and chilled again before baking so they won't spread too much.  Used treacle instead of corn syrup (store was out of molasses). Omitted e orange coz husband didn't care for orange.. Will try next time!   Tripled the recipe, made them big, n they were amazing!! Party guests loved them n got heaps of praises!

Will not make again. They tasted good, but did not hold their shape. Used about a 3" cutter that only made 20 cookies.

We mixed up the dough first, since we had a long list of cookies/candy to make.  Then I divided up into several balls, 3 or 4 and wrapped in plastic wrap and chilled them off in the frig.  That allowed me to work with small amounts at a time so they rest of the dough could stay chilled.  My cutter was on the small side so I was afraid of them being too thick and becoming gingerbread blobs, so the cut-out cookie was on the thin side.  By the end, I had my timing right, more like 5 or 6 minutes.  So some were pretty crunchy, and I thought by this morning I might just have to toss them out and try again, but decided to go ahead and put a piece of bread in the container last night, since my sister went to all the trouble to decorate them.  So I had one with my coffee this morning, and it was PERFECT.  I little bit of crispness at the edge but for the most part they were tender but not too overly soft, it was the perfect combination.  The only thing I did different besides the thickness, was less orange zest.  I was afraid my grater wasnt going to zest it small enough, so I didnt put as much in.  Oh, and we used molasses instead of syrup.  Oh, and also we used half white and half brown sugar.  Thank you for a great recipe.

I loved this! It was the perfect amount of spice - not too overwhelming! I substituted molasses for corn syrup and omitted orange, used 1 C brown sugar instead of white. I would only recommend rolling to 1/4 inch. Otherwise, I found the cutouts would tear too easily. Yum!

The cookies were pretty good, but the dough was dry when we had finished mixing it, so we added milk to it. We made homemade frosting to put on the gingerbread cookies which were good.

I thought they turned out very well. We couldn't make them into gingerbread boys but they still turned out good. The flavoring was good and the only thing was that they got really hard after a while.

This needed no changes to be amazing and wonderful!! If you do want darker color, 1/2 the dark syrup for molasses but for flavor and crunch and chewy center bliss.... it really is perfect just like it is. Everyone we've made these for have told us they are awesome.

These cookies turned out pretty well! The only thing is, they didn't really turn out to be gingerbread. They tasted like orange cookies with a hint of cinnamon. I think they need a stronger "gingerbread" flavor. As a cookie they taste great, however this isn't a gingerbread cookie.

I don't bake much, so the hassle in making these was kind of painful. But I loved them. The love having something unexpected like orange zest. I made them a little thick the first time I rolled them and it turned out really well as a soft cookie. I preferred it soft than when I rolled it down to thin. It's the original hard cookie, but didn't take as yummy to me.

I didn't care for the orange in the recipe.  It completely overwhelmed the ginger and I even added more than called for.   And I only added half  the amount of zest called for.  I thought they tasted exactly like Anna's Swedish thin crispy orange flavored cookies or the equilalent.  Which I've never cared for.  I won't be making these again.

The orange zest adds a really great zing to it. I tweaked the recipe a little, but they turned out very good. Even people that don't normally eat gingerbread, ate these.

These are great. Everyone loved them. Didn't have the orange zest or oj the first time I made them, and the flavor was so good I did not add it the next time. Followed others suggestions and rolled thin and baked on parchment paper. Perfect.

These tasted wonderful, however the dough was very dry. After chilling, all it wanted to do was crumble into pieces. I had to warm it up for a couple minutes in my hands to be able to roll it out right.

I used this cookie recipe last year and it was very good.  Its a good dough to work with.  I substituted molasses as some suggested.  The orange can be a bit overpowering so the easy solution is to cut back on it and see how you like it.  I'll be making it again.

My family came over here on the Mayflower and brought their gingerbread recipe with them.  Except for the lack of molasses and the addition of the orange zest it's pretty much the same as this one. Our original recipe (before alterations) had 1 heaping C. lard, 2 C New Orleans molasses, 1 Tbl ginger, 1 Tbl Soda, 1 tsp alum, 24 Tbl boiling water and enough flour to make them stiff enough to roll.  Let stand overnight before rolling.  Best tasting when dunked in a tin cup of milk in the dark. (Great-Great Grandma's little joke)

Fantastic recipe (and I've tried quite a few gingerbread cookie recipes).  I increased the spices just by a tad, but kept everything else the same.  I love the hint of orange in these cookies.  10 mins was perfect in my oven, the cookies cooled nice and soft.  I left a batch in for 11 mins (just to try it out) and even those were delicious (light and crispy, not rock hard).  Two thumbs up, thanks for the recipe.

This was by far one of the yummiest cookies I have ever eaten!!  We loved the orange zest and they were perfectly seasoned. One substitution I made was using 'rice syrup', I am currently in Germany and we could not find corn syrup or molasses anywhere. lol. But I am glad we used it b/c the cookies turned out amazing!! I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a light gingerbread flavor!  I just finished making the dough for a second batch, everyone in the family is getting some decorated gingerbread men this year :)

These cookies turned out great. They were nice and soft with a more subdued spiciness. I substituted the syrup for molasses and the white sugar for one cup of brown. I also omitted the orange zest because of personal tastes. Next year I will be making 2 batches, one having a little more snap in the spice.

WoW! Was looking for a recipe that didn't need molasses and this one was perfect! Only chilled 1 hour and was perfect to roll and cut. Baked 8 min like previously suggested and the cookies are perfect. Back looking for an ising recipe. Thank you!

I used molassas instead of the corn syrup and I don't know if that is why I had all of the problems I had.  Five stars is for the taste of the dough and me not following the exact recipe.  I refridg. overnight and had a hard ball the next day.  After 2 hours it was still hard.  I defrosted in the microwave 30 secs and added more butter.  Things just got worse. Rather crumbly and dry. I should have followed the recipe - my fault.

I'm not sure what I did wrong but this "dough" never really came together. It was just fine crumbles - sort of pie crust texture. I gathered it together with my hands and made it into a ball and chilled over night as suggested. When the dough finally got warm enough it just fell into big crumbly hunks. There was no way to roll it out and no way to correct it. All those good ingredients went into the trash. I did taste the dough though and that's why I gave it 2 stars - the flavor was wonderful but I don't think I'd take a chance on this recipe again.

These cookies are wonderful!  The orange zest adds such lovely flavor and they smell incredible while they're baking.  Heeding the advice of others, I used part brown sugar, swapped molasses for the corn syrup, and doubled the ginger.  Through trial and error, I found that rolling (on parchment and covered with plastic wrap) to 1/8th inch thick worked best for me with the small 2-inch cutters I used, and they baked nicely in just 5 minutes.  Rerolled cookies were just as good as the first ones since I didn't need to add any flour when rolling them out.  And it was very easy to work with this dough.  This is the gingerbread recipe I'm using from now on.

I am used to German gingerbread cookies, these don't even come close! Followed the recipe but the cookies are too sweet and spread out further than expected while baking. The baked cookies were not soft as I expected them to be. I might try them again sometime but use less sugar!

These cookies brought back sweet childhood  memories, they are PERFECT. I had no bother with these at all,whenever they got sticky while rolling,i just floured the rolling pin,,simple.You HAVE  to try these,,,very simple,if you like chewy ones,  dont bake them till their fully browned,,if you like crunchy, bake them until their brown and let cool. oh yeah one thing i DID change was,,,i used 2TBS of honey,  cos  i couldnt find molasses or corn syrup. just as good. THANKS THANKS THANKS

Great texture- wonderfully crisp-chewy. I switched out the corn syrup for molasses to get the traditional deep gingerbread flavour, but I added a scant tbsp of corn syrup in addition to that- it's the key to getting that texture I described. I also swapped out 2/3 of the white sugar for brown. One note: if you like a spciy gingerbread cookie, DEFINITELY add in extra spices! These lacked spice flavour for me. The orange is really wonderful- but more cinnamon, more cloves, more ginger!!

oh.my.goodness.
The orange really wakes the flavors up (makes you really taste the spices without being too spicy). The only thing I might do the next time is play with the amount of sugar-a tad too sweet.

I followed other suggestions and made a double batch: left out the orange zest, subbed in 2 tsp dark molasses for corn syrup, and baked for 8 minutes. As soon as the "puff" comes down, the cookies are ready to come out of the oven!  My kids and I thought the mild flavor was very nice and the texture was fab: crisp edges and slightly chewy middle (best of both worlds!). I forgot that the dough needed to chill, so I placed the batch in a gallon-sized baggie, flattened it and tossed it in the freezer for 30 minutes - perfect! I cut the bag off, and rolled it out. I then rolled out the scraps between parchment paper and placed back in the freezer for a few minutes while the cookies baked. The dough would then be in great shape to roll out and cut. I also found that spraying the cookie cutters with cooking spray really helped with releasing the cookies. Will use the recipe again - maybe with an extra tsp. of molasses for more chewyness.

Perfect roll out cookies.  I am horrible at roll out cookies and these came out perfectly.  My kids were able to help and not get frustrated and liked the mild taste. I used 1 T corn syrup and 1 T molasses and shortened the cooking time to 9 minutes. I did not need to add more flour as others have stated. Definitely a keeper.

I love this recipe I didn't have molasses so I used golden syrup and they turned out lovely! My son added choc chips for eyes and some had three eyes because they were ALIENS! I will definitely make these again!

I really like this recipe.  I chose it because I really don't like molasses, and I like how this recipe uses dark corn syrup instead.  Upon reading the reviews that the dough was dry and hard to work with, I added 2 extra "squirts" of the corn syrup.  I chilled it for a couple hours, but let it soften on the counter for a while before rolling it- it was rock hard when it came out of the fridge!  It rolled fine, wasn't too dry or too sticky, like some people mentioned.  The cookies did puff up a lot in the oven, but flattened once they cooled.  I used a cup of whole wheat pastry flour.  My kids and I decorated these last night with a buttercream icing.  My one-year old sat in his highchair, watching us, and munched on mini gingerbread boys and girls.  We all had a blast with these!

I made a huge mistake and didn't read all the reviews before I wasted ingredients. I substituted Crisco for butter and otherwise followed the recipe to the letter.

My Kitchen Aid with a dough hook was hard pressed to get all the flour incorporated. In the end, my "dough" was useless with the crumbly consistency of brown sugar. Impossible to roll.

I made these cookies for the first time for a party - everyone loved them, and someone even asked for the recipe!

I liked the dough, but not the hard cookies - I'm not a fan of hard gingerbread. I dropped the oven temperature down to about 275 and kept the cookies in for about 10 minutes. I also froze the cut-out dough for about 3-5 minuted before putting it in the oven to help it hold its shape. Whereas my first batch were really hard, these were gooey and soft. The softer version of these cookies tastes much more like the dough. Once I figured out how to make them softer, I couldn't get enough of them!

P.S. These cookies are great with or without frosting.

I have never been crazy about gingerbread, but my 5 year old really wanted to make gingerbread men, so I gave this one a shot.  They are fabulous!  I think the orange gives them a great flavor, and they nice and soft without falling apart.  Thanks!

This recipe is consistently the best gingerbread cookie recipe around. I'm not a huge fan of the orange flavour, so I don't put in quite as much and use a little extra cinnamon, cloves, ginger, etc. instead. These look lovely with a bit of white royal icing piped on top in elegant designs...very cute!

A great recipe. I keep it in the frige for more than three hours, and the dough is pretty easy to handle. And the shape just stay as the way you cut it.But I wont say its moisture though, turns out pretty crispy and crunch, which is nice as well but not as much as a gingerbread cookie is supposed to be. I substitute the 1/2cup white sugar with brown sugar. Workds out perfectly. My family and friends love them. And I add in one more Teaspoon of dark corn syrup, yammy

This gingerbread recipe is DELICIOUS!!!!! The orange zest is what does it. Not a super-strong flavor... just right. Be sure not to make 'em too thin though; they get very crisp. This is what I did differently... Because I didn't have any corn syrup on hand I used maple syrup, I also did not refridgerate dough overnight; a couple hours did well enough for me. These are so good, I actually have some dough in the fridge right now waiting to be baked for a cookie exchange tonight!!!

Fantastic flavor!  The orange peel really compliments the ginger.  The dough is very crumbly, but just knead it in your hands and it comes together!  These do spread out, but they are called gingerbread boys.

I have been making this recipe for many years and my Gingerbread Boys come out perfectly every time.  

I use Norpro's gingerbread cookie pan. I press the dough into the cookie molds and then, I put the tray in the fridge for 10-15 minutes so that the dough & the tray are cold when they go into the oven.  I follow the recipe as is, except that I add two eggs instead of one for a crispy texture on the outside and a cake-like texture in the inside. Everyone raves about these cookies!  I especially like the orange zest flavoring.  

Be sure to use fresh spices.  I never use spices from the previous year.

This recipe produces a very flavorful dough that pleases everyone during the holidays. However, I had a lot of trouble with my cookies spreading. To combat this, I added another 1/2 cup flour, baked on parchment paper instead of a greased cookie sheet, and rolled my cookies ultra thin, about 1/8 of an inch. I also only baked my cookies about 6-8 minutes, as my early attempts burned on the edges. These tricks dramatically decreased the spreading of my cookies. Hope this helps!

These are the best gingerbread cookies in the world! They’re chewy yet they hold their shape. They’re my most requested cookie at Christmas but there’s one problem, I can barely get them decorated before they’re gobbled up.

Excellent recipe! I don't even like cookies but I couldn't stop eating these. Per other reviewers, I omitted the orange zest and substituted molasses for the corn syrup - delicious!

Oh, my goodness - these are SO delicious with the zesty orange flavour!!  My little grandson and I had a wonderful time making gingerbread men, stars and mittens then decorating them!  I used molasses, as suggested by other reviewers, and the dough is perfect for rolling and cutting.  This is my new “go to” recipe.  Loved it!

I baked this according to other reviewers and used molasses instead of corn syrup (otherwise the same) and I still didn’t like them. I DEFINITELY had to add flour. The dough was gooey even after being refrigerated all night. Yikes! Also, they weren’t gingerbread’y. They were graham cracker’y. Not enough flavor. :-/
thanks anyway!

These cookies were great! I’ve never had homemade gingerbread and the store bought kind are always either cakey or unpleasantly hard and crunchy so I though that was kind of the thing with gingerbread. Like fruitcake, no one really likes it, but it’s traditional. I’m a beginner at all things baking and this is the first time I’ve ever made a rolled cookie recipe. It turned out perfect! The cookies were soft and chewy and perfectly seasoned. Not bland and not too spicy. I did substitute the corn syrup with molasses because that’s what I had on hand. For all other beginner bakers here’s a tip that really helped me: because the amount of flour can vary significantly when measured by volume, add the flour a little at a time. Not enough time flour and you will end up with greasy and flat cookies. Too much flour and you end up with a crumbly dough and/or a bland cookie. I like to mix it with my hands once I’ve got everything combined and judge from there. The dough shouldn’t stick all over you’re hands (or spoon) and should be nice and pliable, kind of like play dough. I will definitely be making these cookies for Christmas this year! Thank you for the delicious recipe!

These gingerbread cookies were a sad cookie that kind of resembled gingerbread. You guys are missing out on a delicious spicy gingerbread cookie if this is your go to recipe. Too sweet, not enough spice and flavor. How can you make gingerbread without molasses?! Stick with Betty Crocker’s recipe. It is WAY better.

This will be my new "go-to" for gingerbread cookies! Like others suggested, I used molasses in place of the corn syrup. Although I think that the orange zest would be delicious, I didn't have any oranges in the house so it was omitted.  I did have a lot of difficulty rolling out the dough after it had been chilled, but once I finally did, the results were great. My oven tends to run a little hot, so I baked at 350 F instead and they were perfect at 11 minutes. I decorated and gave as gifts to rave reviews. Thanks!

I made these exactly like the recipe, including chilling before rolling.  I found the dough rather stiff to work with even though i only used half of the dough at a time.  We LOVED the flavor.  More orange and spice than the heavy molasses taste usually associated with gingerbread.  Unfortunately they were very crunchy and my gingerbread fans prefer a softer cookie.  I guess the search goes on for the perfect recipe

Best gingerbread cookie recipe I have ever tasted!  The orange essence was wonderful!  Like others, I substituted molasses for the dark corn syrup.  I added fresh ginger too, since I had in on hand and it enhanced the flavor beautifully.   I had never used wax paper to roll out cut out cookies before but I took another reviewer's advice and was glad I did.   Since I did not have to keep adding flour to prevent the batter from sticking to the rolling pin, I am convinced it prevented the cookies from getting stiff and tasteless.   Will make this every year!

I followed the recipe.  They did expand, but nothing disastrous as described in other posts.  I chilled overnight.  It was hard to roll out, but kneading it for a few minutes helps.  Cute and yummy!

Skipped the orange as I’m old fashioned. Otherwise followed recipe exactly and wow! these were way better than any I’ve had previously. Rolled out on parchment with waxed paper on top and put in freezer before removing scraps.  Don’t get your ‘boys’ too close or they’ll merge during the bake.

Taste like snickerdoodles and ginger bread combined. No molasses, which makes it simpler. Very easy to make. No need to refridgerate, still turned out great.

Highly recommend this recipe. I wanted a gingerbread cookie recipe that had good flavor, not too sweet and would be soft. These were perfect. I loved the ginger and orange flavors. Will be making these one of our holiday favorites. Chilled the dough overnight and after bringing closer to room temp we were able to dust with some flour and sugar and rolled and cut out fine.  Also, I halved the recipe.

These are great with a milder gingerbread taste. I don't love gingerbread but my husband does so I thought this would be a good compromise. They dough was very hard after refrigerating and we had to let it sit for a little bit but in the end it all rolled out great and were some of the easiest cutout cookies I've made.

Fantastic taste. Like others, I used molasses. It was a bit crumbly at first but became more playable as it warmed a bit. A Christmas staple for sure!

These cookies are delicious and I love the orange flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  I refrigerated the dough overnight.  It was a little hard to roll out at first but got easier as the dough warmed up a little.  I used a large cookie cutter for the first pan and the cookies spread too much.  For the rest, I made the cookies thicker and  I switched to a smaller cookie cutter with the attached outline print (inexpensive and purchased at Walmart).  The smaller cookies with the imprint didn't spread as much and are as cute as can be.

Pros: makes a beautiful dough thats easy to handle after refrigeration overnight.  Tastes amazing (I used 1/2 fresh orange rind for zest - also traded molasses for corn syrup).
Con: Dough spreads so does not keep sharp edges when using cookie cutters (my snowflakes looked like daisies).
Maybe less baking powder next time?

I used molasses instead of corn syrup. For sturdy crispy walls I baked for 10 min. For a slightly chewier cookie I took them out after 8. Baked beautifully on my silpat. Oh and the flour amount was just right as is

My dough came out fairly dry and crumbly, which made it impossible to roll out. I ended up trying to make a log and slicing them; they didn't look pretty but they tasted good all the same.

I love this recipe.  The dough is elastic and a real pleasure to work with, partly due to the amazing aroma that comes off of it while you work. The cookies baked up like a dream, and tasted great.  I doubled the ginger, like many other reviewers, and added a dash of nutmeg.  I also used maple syrup instead of corn syrup or molasses. I'll be turning to this recipe time and again in future!

I put in molasses like others said and left out the zest, and used fresh ginger. It was a very loose batter which needed quite a bit of extra flour for rolling. It cooked well but didn't have a strong ginger flavour, I would use more if I repeat it.

Very good recipe with some change:  I used half butter and 2 eggs and double the ginger. Knead the dough with your hands and better to chill it for more than 3 hours. I didn't  have wax paper so I just used the Saran Wrap which I used to wrap the dough.

Great recipe!! As a substitute  for corn syrup, I used 2-3 tbsp of Golden Syrup and 1 Tsp of molasses, but these were lovely! I also baked for 12 minutes, and while they did spread  a bit, they stayed whole and the end consistency was exactly how I like: cruncy on the outide but not completely brittle inside. Best I've made to date, definitely saving the recipe for next Christmas! I would say do make sure to allow sufficient space around them on the baking tray  to avoid spreading into each other, but I found the flour ration was just fine.

I really like this recipe - but have quite a few alterations so I'm giving it 4-stars, but these are tweaks, this is my go-to gingerbread recipe every year.
My changes: half white sugar/half brown sugar, molasses instead of corn syrup, double the ginger and double the cloves (we like ours with a kick!).

This dough rolls like a dream. Just don't try to roll the whole thing at once! When you take the dough from the mixer (a stand mixer really is best here - my Kitchen-Aid has no problem with it), portion the dough, wrap in Saran Wrap & pop in the frig. One trick I like when rolling dough is to use a 50/50 mix of flour and confectioner's sugar. The dough doesn't get as tough when you re-roll it.

I like to brush the cookies before baking with a bit of water and sprinkle with coarse sparkling sugar. I cut them a little thicker, so they are softer and a bit chewy. Yum!

These are the best gingerbread cookies ever!  Flavorful but not overly spiced. I substituted molasses for dark corn syrup because that is what I had.  The orange zest is a wonderful flavor enhancer and takes the cookies a notch up!  I could not keep the kids from eating them while we were trying to frost them. The adults could not resist either.  Half the cookies were eaten without frosting and the other half eaten right after being frosted!

Just made a batch and as others said, the shapes spread out quite a bit while baking. They don't look like their cut outs at all. And after tasting one they really don't taste much like I was expecting. I will be looking for another recipe.

I liked this recipe but had to make several adjustments. First, I added 1-2 cups of flour, doubled the ginger, and left out the orange. The cooky had a  nice texture, but next time ill double all the spices-we like our cookys spicey!!!The fun thing was my husband frosted/decorated them and he had never done that before-he even added the gumdrops!

Excellent. I left out the orange zest and substituted molasses for corn syrup. Put it in the fridge for 1.5 hours and they turned out just great. They taste like they came from an upscale bakery!

Very good and easy to work with.  Not a traditional gingerbread as it doesn't seem so strong, so I actually liked the taste better.

I quite enjoyed this recipe. I substituted the corn syrup for molasses but still didn't find the taste to be as 'gingerbread-y' as I would have liked but orange flavor is nice and fresh. Left my dough in overnight and didn't have too much problems rolling it out. My first batch I baked for 8 minutes and they came out harder than I wanted so I baked  my second batch for 6 minutes and found they were perfect. They harden up as they stand. Id make this again for sure but maybe add just a touch more molasses

This recipe has become a tradition in our home.  I find it needs less flour so I add it slowly until it forms a nice dough.  I substitute molasses instead of corn syrup and go heavy on the orange zest.  It is delicious!

I made these gingerbread cookies with my first grade class and they turned out perfectly!  I substituted the corn syrup for molasses and rolled the dough between 2 sheets of waxed paper, as others recommended.  I was a bit worried because the dough seemed dry and crumbly at first and I only had 3 hours to refrigerate it, but it rolled out perfectly.  The best part?  The kids all loved it!  Will I make these again next year?  YES!

I loved the taste of this recipe, but my gingerbread turned out kind of crumby. I made it work. My sons actually needed it for a school project and modeled it into their letters of their name and initials. Maybe I did something wrong, but mine did not roll out well. Like I said, I made it work. Anyone else have a similar problem. Was the dough supposed to be like that?

Just like some of the previous reviewers mentioned, this cookie does taste great. It's moist and orange zest is great. However, it is quite greasy and it does spread out and puff out a lot. It is also very difficult to keep from breaking if you have any cutouts with smaller, thinner parts. I've tried this 3 times and although we enjoy the taste, I will look for other recipes, because it's such a pain to work with even after refrigerating overnight and using small batches while the rest waits in the fridge. You could use another cup of flour if you have the same issue.

OH MY GOODNESS!! I was craving gingerbread cookies, but had no recipe for them. I tried a recipe on another site, with no sucess, until I found this!!! I did not have any dark corn syrup so I substituted for blackstrap molasses. I hate the taste of molasses, but these cookies were perfectly balanced and delicious. Even my hubby, who isn't a gingerbread fan, loves them!! I found I had to add a little water to the chilled dough as mine was a little crumbly, but otherwise they were perfect!!! Will definitely be baking again!

This was my first time making gingerbread so I was a bit apprehensive. Very easy recipe to follow- I kept the dough in the fridge for about 5 hrs before forming, I also added fancy molasses as suggested. I did not orange as I did not have any but did add more ginger. I forgot to buy cookie cutters so mine were just round- like ginger snap cookies. They tasted great and were good for dipping in coffee...they didn't fall apart :) I'll make these again.

I fancy myself a baker, cookies in particular.  I am constantly baking them and my family loves them all.  I say this because my husband has declared these cookies his very favorite!  That is HUGE praise from a cookie connoisseur! I did make some minor changes to the original recipe:  used 2 tbs of orange zest, replaced corn syrup with honey, and decreased the baking time to 7 minutes.  This creates a very soft, chewy cookie.  I am not a fan of gingerbread cookies, but this will be a holiday tradition going forward for sure!

I doubled this added molasses, used 1 cup ww pastery flour, refridgerated over night, rolled them out baked them and they were flat as crepes, and mushy, so I put them back in the oven and they came out crispy, now I must frost them.

Very good gingerbread - nice flavor.  I decided to make 1/2 the recipe as it said it made "five dozen".  I used a 3"x5" gingerbread man cookie cutter and 1/2 the recipe ONLY made 13 gingerbread men !!!  The pictured gingerbread boys must be VERY little ???

I loved orange tangy taste.  I made some adjustments for the second batch as i prefer my gingerbead man darker but have ran out of molasses in the house so i added abt 3 tsp of chocolate powder and increase the spices..    It turned out even better..  :)  Would definitely use this recipe over and over again..

Gingerbread cookies made by scratch are always best. But I found out that when in a pinch that using a gingerbread cake mix and adding extra flour to the dough to make stiff,  works well.

The flavor is wonderful, but I used reconstituted "dry" orange zest, and I couldn't really taste the orange flavor. I followed other reviewers who used molasses instead of dark corn syrup. I used mild molasses , but it probably was enough to overpower the orange.  All in all, I chilled the dough several hours, I used ALOT of flour to roll them out because the dough was very soft. My first few batches puffed up--a little too much, but when I rolled them thin they held their shape better.  Thin/crispy--thick/chewy  Delish!

My cookies came out crispy even after just 10 min. I may have cut them too thin.. so I've got gingersnaps!... they are wonderful though!! The flavor of the orange really comes out... I used clementines and did not even use the full amount and could notice it in there.. Very nice addition.. It would have been even nicer if I wouldn't have been so lazy and zested a little more! ;) Very nice flavor.. try 'em! Oh.. and I, like others, subbed molasses for the corn syrup.. I just had to have molasses!! ;)

I loved the flavor of these cookies!  I think I cooked them a little longer than I should because they were pretty crispy but they still tasted great.  This is my new "official" Christmas gingerbread cookie recipe.

5 stars isn't enough! They need way more. These cookies tasted amazing and with diligence with the colloing of the dough and baking sheets they were the perfect little gentlemen. People who don't even like gingerbread coookies my MIL included were fighting over them and then demanding the recipe. These were a new cookie for me this year and I guess I will have to make these forever. Used the "decorator frosting" from here and they had a nice flavour combo, but with the orange in the cookie you don't really need icing. I've been toying on whether to just make them as regular cookies just so I can have more now.

The dough was surprisingly easy to work with after being chilled overnight, but it spreads a lot, so my star and people cut-outs were unrecognizable. The flavor is nice, but a little too buttery.

After I read reviews of how great this recipe is I was pretty disappointed. 

I don't like citrus, so I didn't do the orange zest; I did the molasses sub; did some brown sugar.

As others have said, the cookies spread out a LOT, much more than I expected. They puffed up and then flattened out after I left them on the cookie sheet for a while. They're great out of the oven but I didn't like baked ones two days later as much. Mine were also greasy after coming out of the oven (dab-a-napkin-on-the-cookie greasy), which were completely unappealing. I don't like how they're so flat and expand so much. I wouldn't bake these again.

I like the taste of these cookies. They aren't traditional-tasting, but I think they are better-suited for kids and those of us who might not be in love with gingerbread. I can't give this recipe 5 stars, though, because I think the proportions are really whacky. I followed the recipe exactly, and chilled the dough overnight, but it was still too sticky to work with. I ended up adding another half a cup of flour, which of course affects the taste. They were still good enough to give away, but if the proportions were better I think this would have been a much better cookie. Maybe use only the egg white to cut down on the liquid...?

I followed the recipe exactly, and they turned out great.  If the rolled dough is too thick, the boys turn out too blobby.  But when we roll it thin, they turn out perfect.  Not too crispy, either.  Very tasty!

great recipe! I found that when i rolled it out just out of the fridge, and baked them right away, they spread out a lot, but the more flour that i worked into them as i kept rolling, they kept their shape a lot better! so i don't know if it would be better to add more flour to the mix or to just knead it a bit with flour afterwards, but they taste great!

I made these per special request from my boyfriend.  I've never done gingerbread cookies before and was a little nervous about it.  These are the tweaks that I used...1. I used brown sugar in place of regular.  2. I omitted the orange zest, I wanted the cookies to taste like gingerbread cookies.  3. I used three TBS of molassas instead of the dark corn syrup.  4. I used only 2 cups of flour, that was more of an accident, but they still turned out ok despite that.  5. Instead of ground cloves I used allspice, it's just what I had in my cupboard.  6. I put most of it in the fridge over night before rolling out, I tried the wax paper thing but my dough was too sticky (probably from the missing cup of flour) I used a bunch of flour on the wax paper and while rolling it out and it helped a lot.  I had to roll the cookies really thin to keep their shape in the over and decreased the cook time to 7 minutes because they were so thin.  They are still more of a crunchy cookie, but taste great still.  I'm not much of a gingerbread fan so I melted down white chocolate chips and decorated with that, which makes the taste fantanstic.

well, i have to say i am slightly disappointed with this recipe, despite all the rave reviews.  for starters, the taste was WONDERFUL.  could not have tasted better!  but they were way too hard and crunchy.  i prefer a softer gingerbread.  did anyone else's come out crunchy and hard?  i'm not sure if there is any way i could modify it...

5* for flavor.  My only problem was that they spread really bad.  The dough was quite chilled and the right thickness--still spread.  Taste was great.

These are the best gingerbead cookies my family has tried, hands down.soft, but made nice little gingerbead boys.  I followed bakers suggestion to use only large eggs, my dough rolled easily after flowering the board and rolling pin.  
I did use Molassis instead of dark corn syrup.
We had our first gingerbread cookie party with our little grandsons today, we had fun making the cookies and smelling them bake.  It made the Christmas season very special for all of us!

I love this recipe! I made these gingerbread boys for last Christmas and "Summer Cookies" a couple of weeks ago when the kids started their summer vacation: I decorated them with royal icing and mm's and they came out gorgeous - no to mention delicious. I added a bit more orange zest than the recipe suggest because I love the flavor. Thank you for the great recipe!

I loved this one- especially that little hint of orange. Personally, I used molasses and liberally added cinnamon. I cooked them around 10 minutes, which gave them a nice crispiness.

Excellent recipe, mild but tasty. I also used molasses as that is what I had and the cookies were very good, spread just a little. The batter was stiff, but I didn't have any problem with it.  I refrigerated overnight for convenience. Will definitely make again!

Great recipe!! My daughter and I made them for Christmas. The dough seemed to be a perfect consistency. I concur with the others that the orange peel added a wonderful flavor. Next time, I'll roll out the dough to 1/4" before putting in the fridge so all I have to do is cut out the shapes. The dough gets sticky fast. I may even try replacing the corn syrup with molasses or even honey next time just to be healthier. Definitely a keeper!!

Great recipe. Perfect amount of spice for my taste, plus the zest added something different, but still complementary. 

The first thing that my mom commented on when she walked in the kitchen was how great they smelled! Definetly will make again next Christmas! Thanks for a yummy recipe!

The recipe was easy to mix and roll out and cut, but the cookies flattened out and became shapeless after baking.  I think the recipe needs 1/2 cup extra flour to make the cookies keep their shape.  Disappointing results.

Really tasty receipe.  However, the flour ratio is wrong.  Had to add more corn syrup to get it to blend right.  And, less orange zest.  Will probably cut down zest by 1/2 next time.  Family loved them....it's a keeper.

Love love love this recipe!  Although I didn't have corn syrup on hand, so I ended up just substituting molasses.  Came out great!  I actually took these to a cookie party.  I used a moose cookie cutter and store-bought cream cheese frosting to decorate.  Won first place! Will definitely make again.

These cookies are fantastic!  I can't stop eating them.  My only complaint is that they spread a little more than I would like as they bake, so the boys and girls didn't look very sharp.  But with a little icing, I was able to make them look like boys and girls again.  Next time I will roll them a little thinner and bake for a little less time, while spreading the cookies out a little more.  They rolled out beautifully and have a wonderful texture.  I will be making these boys every December from now on!

My only change to the recipe was molasses instead of dark corn syrup, partly because I don't have dark corn syrup and also because I prefer to not use corn syrup when possible.

I have been searching for a gingerbread cookie recipe that is nicely spiced and still soft and chewy after baking. This is it! The orange zest is a wonderful addition. I did substitute molasses for the dark corn syrup as that is what I had on hand. The gingerbread haters in my family even loved these. I have a batch chilling now to bake for a co-worker who has been ill and not able to bake this season. I know she will love them.

The best, crispest ginger cookie I have ever tasted!  My dough was a little crumbly so I used smaller and simple cutouts.  These would be fine simply cut in squares!

I am not a huge fan of gingerbread - but wow...these cookies were wonderful.  My 3 year old mixed while I added the ingriedents - they turned out great - tasted even better.  Has quickly become a Christmas favorite in our house.

Did not like this recipe.  Dough was very hard to work with, dry and crumbly.  Didn't taste good either.

This is one of 3 gingerbread recipes we made up over the weekend, still haven't found one we like.

Ive made these cookies twice my whole family loves them. The only beef i have about them is you have to chill overnight. But well worth the wait. Thanks for sharing.

The BEST gingerbread cookies I've ever had and made! I never cared for gingerbread cookies until I made these! My family and I gobbled this up! I didn't add the orange (don't want it in my gingerbread cookies), and ALWAYS sub molasses for the corn syrup - a MUST. The cookies tasted soooo good and came out perfect---chewy and melt-in-your-mouth good!

My daughter and I made these for Christmas, which was fun for her but they didn't turn out to well.  I followed the recipe exactly and they tasted great but they spread out way too big.  They ended up looking like monster blobs.  I would suggest rolling your dough thinner and making them small.  Mine were rising as they were baking and as soon as I took them out of the oven they flatened.  I made my usual sugar cookies the same night and never had any trouble with them. Same concept, different taste.

This is the second year I've made these.
I don't remember them loosing thier shape as badly last year.

These are the most delicious cookies.
They are addictive. The smaller cookie cutters work better than the large.  

I substituted corn syrup for molasses and tried increasing the baking soda on my second batch.  I had to throw out the first batch they looked so bad.  I rolled them out thicker and it was better but still didn't hold shape very well.

Wish someone could tell me how to correct this because they are the only gingerbread cookies my kids like.
I'm not a very good cook but would baking powder help?

Outstanding cookie, very nice flavor.  Dough does need to warm up to work though, like sugar cookie dough.  Santa will be happy this year.  Thanks!

These cookies were so good. Light and flavorful.  They do spread out quite a bit during baking.

First time ever to do cookies... this was a easy to follow recipe... The orange gives it a really good taste to the cookies. :)

Yes, it was hard to get all of the flour in but, these turned out great and tasted great for at least a week. It had a wonderful mild gingersnap flavor that my kids just loved. I will permanently add this recipe to my recipe box.
