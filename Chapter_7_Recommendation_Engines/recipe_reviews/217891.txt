I'm the author of this recipe and wanted to make a couple notes....
For the chicken, I do not simply boil the chicken as the recipe states. You need to add something to help flavor the chicken to the water...salt, pepper,celery,onion etc. A good recipe to try/look at for guidance is AR's for Boiled Chicken...just add salt.
The amount of pepper in the recipe should not be a pinch but it should be, fresh ground pepper, to taste. Some people like a lot (my dad) and others (my husband) not so much,lol
I am also picky about the brand of Ranch Dressing I use as well, personally not all dressing's taste the same..we like Hidden Valley.
It's also good with a bit of shredded cheese mixed in too;)
Enjoy!

This was very good and quick to make.  I wanted chicken salad for lunch but didn't have any celery to provide the crunch.  The ranch dressing gives it a zing that's missing in regular chicken salad.  I will definitely make it again!

Good recipe. Although, like most people, I changed a few things. Instead of boiling the chicken, I roasted it in the oven. I added some crumbled bacon and used roasted garlic instead of fresh garlic. Also, I cut down the ranch a bit and added some honey mustard. I would make this again.

We liked this, and don't normally like chicken salad. Tried this because we DO like Ranch dressing. I was pleased with the result, but wished I had used Hidden Valley as suggested, Kraft Light (which was all I had) didn't have quite enough oomph in this case. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Simply Delicious Ranch Chicken Salad Haiku: "It's simple to make. Not quite simply delicious. Still tasted okay." I had some chicken that I'd shredded and frozen in portioned bags, so after thawing one, I followed this recipe, but it was only so-so. Definitely needed some salt and more than a pinch of pepper. Still, when crammed into a pita w/ lettuce, tomatoes, pepperoncinis, it was fairly tasty - just not a chicken salad that I'd scoop up and eat by itself.

I guess I didn't use a good dressing as the flavor was really flat.  I would use celery instead of the cucumber as well as chopped almonds to add more crunch.

I used a can of chicken, and cut the ranch down to 1/2 a cup. Love it! I live overseas and cannot get good celery at all so this is a great alternative to traditional chicken salad.

Mmmm this was good! Hubby and I were really hungry and were making chicken salad when we realized we didn't have mayo!!! So we gave this a try. We added lettuce, Swiss cheese, and ate it on toasted spouted wheat bread. We used lots of pepper!
