This is fairly simple to change to a low carb, low sugar drink.  I substituted non-fat half and half for the milk, and splenda for the table sugar.  I used 1 packet of splenda, since I find it to be very sweet.  I also used baking cocoa, rather thank chocolate drink mix, and it was yummy.  You do have to blend this very well with these changes, but if you're on a low carb, low sugar diet, this is fabulous.

I was looking for a milkshake that didn't have ice cream in it as we were out of it =)
Very tasty, very airy and light milkshake. Good taste. I didn't use straight strawberries, but blueberries and cranberries as well - I had a mixed packet =) Came out gorgeous! 
I also added more banana and chocolate. The way it is right now, is (as author said) a bit less sweet than most milkshakes =)

My family really enjoyed this milkshake. It is filling enough to satisfy the kids after a day at the pool, or as an afterschool snack. I use ovaltine mix as it was what I usually have on hand.

This recipe was great.  I didn't use the banana so it had more of a strawberry flavor, but it was very good.

It was good but not that great.  I added more strawberries and more vanilla extract for more taste.

This was good- not great, but I would probably make again. I used pure baking cocoa so maybe next time when I have hot cocoa powder it will taste a little better???

I woke up this morning craving a banana smoothie but didn't have ice or yogurt - went on allrecipes on my phone, found this recipe - had all the ingredients (used chocolate carnation instant breakfast powder for the chocolate) and threw them in my magic bullet and it was amaaazing!! My two toddlers and I sucked it down so fast I had to make 2 more servings!

Simple, on-hand ingredients, easy to make, and easy to modify for your tastes.  I used a whole banana and fresh strawberries and supplemented with a few ice cubes with great results. This one will become a mainstay for us.

I used Carnation rich hot chocolate powder mix and frozen strawberries that were already sweetened and pureed so I left out the additional sugar. This was pretty good, but I didn't care for the vanilla in there, it just didn't seem to go with the rest of the flavors.

I used both frozen strawberries AND frozen banana. I also omitted the sugar, as it ended up being sweet on it's own.  My kids and I really liked it.

I made this smoothie precisely according to the recipe given (except for the strawberries being frozen), and it was just delicious !  I wouldn't add or take out anything, it was so smooth how all of the flavors blended together, without the drink becoming too sweet or tart.  Great recipe, I recommend it all the way.

Pretty good!  The flavor was unlike any smoothie I've had before!I didn't have frozen strawberries so I just used non-frozen ones and added about a cup of ice. i also didn't have chocolate mix drink so I just subbed in a tbsp of cocoa powder and a tbsp of sugar. I also used whole milk instead of low fat which made it creamier. Thanks for a great recipe and I can't wait to try it with frozen strawberries!

This was a decent tasting smoothie. I love anything chocolate, and bananas and strawberries are some of my favorites, so this was a nice combination of flavors for me. I used chocolate soy milk instead of the chocolate drink mix and milk, and it still turned out pretty good.

I really enjoyed this recipe...but I would have to say that the chocolate mix was a bit powery for my liking.  Next time I may have to use the syrup.

Excellent and low fat/low calorie drink!  I substituted the low fat milk for non fat milk and switched the two tablespoons of sugar for 3 packets of Splenda.  Yummy!

Yummy!  My little changes... I added more strawberries (1 Cup total), increased the vanilla to 1 tsp and went a little light on the sugar and ovaltine.  Not too sweet and pretty healthy - great recipe!  My toddler loves this drink too.

I left this recipe just the way it is, but when it was done I added chocolate whipped cream on top, which I think finished the product.

Not Bad. easy to make and fulfilling sugar was a bit too little for my taste so i added an additional 2 tsps. Its not heavy just the right consistency.

To make one serving, I used 1/2 c milk, 1/2 c frozen strawberries, 1/2 frozen banana, 1 T cocoa powder, 1/2 t vanilla extract, and 2 t Splenda. It was so good! Be sure to cut up the fruit (peel and cut banana before freezing) if you don't like it chunky.

Excellent!  My boyfriend always looks forward to this milkshake!  I made modifications though ... (1) Added an entire banana instead of a half (2) used unsweetened cocoa powder (didn't have any chocolate drink mix on hand) (3) halved the sugar (1 teaspoon instead of two) (4) added 1/6 tsp of stevia to sweeten without adding calories.  This is not a super sweet milkshake (which I like) and satifies me whenever I am in the mood for chocolate.

I made this with a chocolate powdered protein mix sold at Curves, and Splenda--good!  Had it for breakfast on a busy day.

This was good. I was looking for a smoothie recipe that didn't require yogurt, since I was out. I hate using only 1/2 a banana...what do you do with the other half?? So I used 1 banana, 1 cup of mixed frozen berries, the same amounts of milk and vanilla, and 2 Tbsp cocoa powder instead of drink mix. I didn't add any sugar and it was fine-I made it to be healthy, not unhealthy ;) It had a good, thick texture and a nice taste.

Very yummy, but had to add a couple handfuls of ice to really get a smoothie consistency.  Also used Chocolate Slimfast powder and turned it into a breakfast smoothie.

Wonderful!  And easy :-)  I used 3/4 cup plain yogurt + 1 cup of milk.  

The chocolate I used was Penzey's Hot Chocolate mix.  Delicious!!

I would give it another star if you added more chocolate. So just add more sugar and chocolate. other wise it was GREAT. It stays in your mouth. DELICIOUS!!!

This was great - a terrific combination of flavors. I threw in a few ice cubes to make it colder.

This was great! I used a sugar free chocolate drink mix, skim milk & Splenda. It was wonderful. The only downer was that I felt like this made enough for about one serving & it says it's a two serving recipe. But no matter-still a delicious recipe!

This drink was very good and I didn't even add the vanilla or sugar. I didn't have chocolate drink mix so I just used chocolate milk and it worked fine. This ones a keeper

This recipe was great. I changed it just a little. I used 1 cup of Lactaid Chocolate milk and added honey instead of the sugar with everything else I did as the recipe called for. The end result was amazing. Will definitely be making this a few times a week. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this recipe into a healthy post-workout drink.  Subbed almond milk for regular milk, used a scoop and a half of chocolate protein powder and did NOT use vanilla or sugar...it was fantastic and PLENTY sweet!

I followed the recipe except I did omit the sugar. I used skim milk and Nestle Nesquik No Sugar Added chocolate drink powder. A great way to get a low cal chocolate fix.
