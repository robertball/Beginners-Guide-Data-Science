OMG! This was a huge hit at our Thanksgiving gathering.  Everyone loved it! You definitely need to add the 2 Tbsp. of white sugar to decrease the tartness, but other than that this recipe is spot on in terms of flavor. I used toasted walnuts instead of almonds (personal preference), a mixture of romaine lettuce and spring mix along with the red onion, added some thin sliced Granny Smith apples that I soaked in a bit of lemon juice and water to prevent them from browning, craisins, and feta cheese.  That mixture proved to be the right combination of sweet and tart and needless to say it was very pretty! It was also a great way to use up leftover turkey, the next day I diced some of it and put it over top - YUM!

I can't speak for the salad, but I made the dressing and bottled it for Christmas gifts. It was just beautiful, and smelled heavenly! Because of the dressing's rich pink color, it looks very festive in small cork-topped bottles (I found mine at Michaels for 99 cents). For giving, I put each bottle in a cellophane bag and tied it with raffia and a twist of red star-spangled wire, and included the recipe for both salad and dressing.

Have been making this salad past 4 years and just now finally rating it! The vinaigrette is a masterpiece in it's own and is wonderful on pork, chicken and turkey. When using in the salad, I also add a bit of sugar to calm the tartness. Toasted almonds add a wonderful crunch. I also use crasins as they are available year round and  a reliable quality product. Any extra craisins  I toss in the salad.  Romaine lettuce is my favorite as it is crisp and light.  I add a bit more olive oil when using in a salad.  Better consistancy. A fantastic recipe that can also be fiddled with for your families taste preferences. Not an ordinary " fruity " dressing!

I keep meaning to write a review and after I have had people ask to take leftovers home and being asked to bring to our family's Christmas Eve dinner the time has come! Here is what I did to change the recipe up: I added 2 TBS of sugar to the dressing, substituted Feta for the blue cheese, added 1/2 cup of Craisins to the salad greens. I prefer it with toasted almonds, hubby prefers it with pecans. The last time I made this we had 9 eating and this still made plenty. This tastes like something you would get out at a nice restaurant. The color of the dressing is a very pretty pink and it is especially lovely during Thanksgiving, Christmas and Valentine's dinners. **Update. My store was out of cranberries so I subbed raspberries and had to add a bit more sugar but was still yummy! Thanks.

Very tasty - I added crumbled Gorgonzola cheese & a few "Craisins" with sliced chicken strips on top for a twist.

I made this for our Thanksgiving feast, and made it exactly as written, then tasted.  Besides being far too tart (which, after reading reviews, I was prepared to add sugar, but I gave the written recipe a fighting chance as written), but also, even with such bold, flavorful ingredients, I found it rather "flat" or "lacking".  I started the "tweaking" with a tablespoon of sugar and additional pinch of salt.  Better, but not there.  It just had no depth.  So another tablespoon of sugar went in, followed by more dijon and eventually about 3 times the garlic.  A volunteer taster agreed that it just seemed really one dimensional, so finally with the addition of 1/2 tsp thyme and three green onions it was really a lovely dressing, but by then, it was not this recipe at all, thus the three stars.  This all surprised me because I took that first bite expecting to love it.  I just found it lacking, but a nice base for additional flavor.

This salad is a winner!  The dressing is easy to make and the cheese gives  it a great flavor.  I substituted Gorgonzola for the blue cheese and also added a little sugar to the dressing to cut down on the tartness. Wonderful!  Walnuts can also be used instead of almonds. (Just don't brown them as you would the almonds.)

I made this on Christmas eve and there was not a scrap left!  When was the last time a green salad on a buffet table was eaten in its entirety?  Even my father who claims salad is "rabbit food" came back for seconds!  Will make again for sure with some grilled chicken for a scrumtious meal.

Good salad, great dressing! I felt it was pretty tangy so I, too, added a teaspoon of sugar to cut the bite. Thanks for sharing Nancy. The flavors mingle nicely and with red onion rings, the presentation is wonderful.

Made this as written but found the dressing very tart and bitter. Definitely needs less dijon mustard and/or the addition of sugar. I think if I follow some of the recommended modifications I'll have a wonderful salad.

The dressing was a little too tangy.  Maybe less vinegar?  However, I like the combination of almonds and bleu cheese.

This was my second try at a cranberry vinaigrette and I was much more satisfied with this.  My nephew proclaimed it "Good enough to eat!".  The salad was good.  I used Feta cheese and added a diced red pear to it as well.  There wasn't much left over.

This is the most delicious salad!  I made it for Christmas Eve dinner and it was probably my favorite part of the meal (and when comparing to turkey and mashed potatoes that is saying something).  I used dried cranberries instead of fresh and although I believe fresh would have been better, it worked well.  I also added some lemon juice to the dressing and that added great flavor!  Will definitely have this again!

Excellent dressing, the Almonds add a nice crunch.  A little clumpy if refrigerated.  We loved it!

Loved this! YUMMY!!!!

If me and my husband could give this more stars we would!! My husband has deemed this his new favorite salad!

I made some adjustments. I used craisins per the advice of other reviewers. I also added 2 tsp. of sugar as the vinegar in the dressing was a bit too strong. I think next time I will scale it down a bit. I also added a tsp more of water and a little more olive oil as it was a bit thick. The dressing is os much better after it has chilled a bit.

I took the advice of others and cut up some green apples. I used blue cheese because we are both blue cheese freaks! 

This was easy and delicious! My husband is already asking when I will make it again. He usually doesn't like what he calls "foo-foo" salads but he devoured this and had seconds!

Thanks for a great recipe! This will be a keeper in our household!

I experienced this wonderful salad at my church's women's Christmas tea and it was fabulous! The only difference was they did add Craisins to the salad. I had to have this recipe for myself and was so excited to find it on All Recipes! I made it for this past Easter dinner. I always read other's reviews and many times apply one or more suggestions in making a recipe, which I did with this one. I used 1/2 the amount of mustard, blanched the onions, toasted the almonds, added Craisins to the salad, used Craisins vs fresh cranberries for the dressing (I rinsed them quickly in a small sieve to give a bit moisture to them and aid in the pureeing process), & added 3 T sugar to the dressing. I made the dressing two different ways with the only differences being I used regular red wine vinegar in one batch and an aged raspberry red wine vinegar (Presidents Choice brand from Jewel)in the other. I did let them chill in frig for 24 hours before tasting,this does allow the flavors to develop and blend, as well as allowing the dressing to thicken a bit. Just shake  or whisk really well before using. The raspberry red wine dressing won for flavor hands down! I did eat the salad with bleu cheese at the tea, but I am not a huge fan of it so I did sub feta in mine. Great, great recipe! I will definitely be using this one many times over! Thank you so much for sharing it!

Looking for something different practially every day, I wanted a green salad to go with a steak (which is different too) I found this recipe and had frozen cranberries which I buy in the winter and freeze for the year.

I must agree that this dressing needed sugar so I added some splenda and wow it was great ! Im giving it 5 stars because it deserves it .Peoples taste buds defer. Its great and I will use it next time I have a dinner party. Thanks Nancy !

This is one of the simpliest and the bestest salad dressings and so gourmet.  I cut the vinegar to 2 T and added 1 T of honey.  I also used feta cheese instead of blue but the recipe is so very easy to store and use as needed.  i put the greens in a big tupperware bowl and then just added the rest of the ingredients to individual salads.  My grown daughters loved it and went home with the recipe!  Its the best!!!!!
Thanks so much for sharing it.

So wonderful! I would highly recommend CANDIED almonds (Put your sliced almonds in a skillet with 1/4 cup sugar and a dash of salt, then stir over medium heat until sugar melts and almonds are toasted and coated (8-10 min.?) I also sprinkled the salad with dried cranberries. The next day I added some Fuji apple slices and it was even better! I do agree that a teaspoon or two of sugar can be a good addition, to reduce the "bite" if the dressing seems too potent, as it did the next day. It is also prettiest to drizzle the lovely dressing atop, instead of tossing, as in my photo. YUM.

This was a very yummy salad!  I had to modify the recipe a bit, but not too much. Served wtih pork chop, apple & stuffing casserole, herbed crescent rolls and pumpkin pie for dessert (a very nice "fall" dinner).  I changed just a couple of things.  One reason for the change was due to the fact that I couldn't find fresh cranberries at the store (not available).  I substituted dried cranberries (i.e. Craisins) instead, added a chopped (unpeeled) red delicious apple & purchased a European blend salad mix (the dark, leafy colors looked really nice against the deep red cranberries & apple).  I also added a tad bit of Splenda (to taste) to the dressing per other's suggestions as it was too tart without it.  My mother's  suggestion to serve a cranberry salad with dinner was brilliant!  Thanks!

This was a good dressing.  I added 2 tbsp of sugar it was far to tart for my liking.  Also I thought the dressing was better when I put it though a sive.  I didn't end up with large pieces of cranberry.

My sister made this salad for a family dinner last night and Wow, did everyone love it!  She added a tsp. of white sugar to the dressing ingredients to cut the tartness of the dressing, as previous reviewers mentioned to do.  And she omitted the minced garlic - - she's not a huge garlic fan.  The combination of almonds, blue cheese, and berries is wonderful.  I'll be making this salad myself very soon!

This dressing is amazing.  I added a teaspoon of sugar to take some tanginess off.  Everyone was drawn in by the great pink color.  This was a huge hit.  It's a great way to make a salad 'wintery'.

I loved how easy this salad was to prepare- no slicing except for the red onion. The dressing was ready in just seconds and initially tasted great however after sitting for awhile I thought it was REALLY tart. I think next time I will add extra oil and some  honey or sugar  to cut the tartness but otherwise a delicious and super easy salad!

Served this at our New Years Eve party last night and it was devoured! Instead of cranberries, I used whole berry cranberry sauce and decided on Feta cheese in place of the blue. I opted to use a Sugar Coated Pecan recipe by Carolyn on this site in lieu of the plain almonds. Another addition I made was adding canned mandarin oranges. Between the different textures, the slightly sweet from the nuts and the orange segments and the tang from the dressing itself, this proved to be one of the most loved salads I've ever made. Thank you so very much Nancy!!

I made this dressing 3 times over the Christmas weekend and it was a hit every time.  I had tons of requests for the recipe.  This dressing not only tastes good, but makes a very colorful salad.  In addition to the almonds, red onion and blue cheese, I add celery and mandarin oranges.  It is fantastic!!

The salad was good, but, like others, I thought the dressing needed to be a little sweeter. It also needed more cranberry flavor! I chopped another half cup or so of cranberries and cooked them for a few minutes with a little water and sugar. The cooked cranberries, added to the dressing, gave it a much richer, more complex flavor.

I made the vinaigrette only for a salad I put together with ingredients I had on hand.  The vinaigrette itself was good, but really needed something to counter the tartness.  I added about a teaspoon of honey and that did the trick.  It was well liked by guests and it was a beautiful addition to our Christmans dinner.  Thanks Nancy W.!

Added 1 tsp sugar, an extra 1/4 cup of fresh cranberries, and  2 Tbsp of apple juice concentrate since I found it a bit garlicky and I love garlic but found it a tad overwhelming.  Very good and everyone liked it!  Will make again.

This was good, but I did have to add sweetener to it, otherwise it would have been way to tart for us.  I used fresh cranberries as directed so maybe next time I will try it with Craisins hoping that will make it a bit sweeter.

Good but I made it better by adding a few of things.  I added a tablespoon of balsamic, another 1/2 teaspoon of minced garlic, and a handful of more cranberries.  That made the dressing less oily.

After reading the reviews for this dressing, I expected a little more.  I could barely taste the cranberry and the mustard was much too strong.  Once I played with the amounts on ingredients, it did end up being an excellent dressing with recipe requests from friends.  Here's what I did different for better results: Add an extra table spoon of red wine vinegar, half the dijon mustard (1/2 tablespoon), added an extra 1/2 cup of fresh cranberries, and a couple of tablespoons of sugar.  This really was amazingly good with a few modifications.

I made the dressing both ways...with fresh cranberries  and with Craisins (dried craberries). Very  tart with the fresh berries; delicious with the dried.  Served it with the Craisin version. Made the rest of the salad exactly as written. Got LOTS of complements!!!!

I really loved the cranberry vinaigrette recipe - I used it for a field greens salad with walnuts, goat cheese and pomegranate seeds.  A hint - to cut down on the overpowering onion flavor, slice the onion before dicing, place in a strainer, and pour boiling water over the onions.  The quick blanching will cut down that "raw" onion taste and helps to balance the flavors.

Wonderful salad.  I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 because I did follow the tips of others and used Craisins instead of fresh cranberries and also added 2 T. sugar to the dressing.  I tasted it before adding the sugar and it had a strong vinegar taste.  I cannot imagine using fresh cranberries, for it would have to be very sour.  For the salad, I used mixed baby greens, red onion, toasted pecans, a chopped red apple, more craisins, and feta cheese.  Several people asked for the recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

This was great!  The tangy blue cheese and the cranberry dressing were a tasty compliment to each other.  I chopped dried cranberries in the food processor with the dressing, added 2 Tbsp. of sugar to sweeten it up a bit.  I also sugared the almonds.  I will definitely make this again and again!

Great combination of flavours! I can't understand earlier reviewers who were putting SUGAR, of all things, into the dressing - there is absolutely no need; it's perfectly tangy as it is. Dried cranberries or "craisins" work well when sprinkled in the salad itself.

Wow!  I served this to company and it was a hit!  I did double the dijon mustard and cranberries in the dressing as I thought it was a bit too vinegary.  I also threw in some dried cranberries in the salad to make it a bit more colorful.  Very good!

This salad was fantastic!  I omitted the onion, added a pinch of sugar and used honey dijon mustard. Like others I went with crumbled Feta cheese. The dressing was on the thick side so I added a bit of half-and-half. To the salad greens I added a good handful of craisins. Both the salad greens and the dressing went into the freezer to chill while I finished putting dinner together . I added the dressing and tossed table-side. This was a hit at my dinner party and my adult daughter even packed up the remainder to take home with her.

Awesome flavor!  Fresh cranberries weren't in season yet, so I used dried cranberries instead.  Still awesome!  I cut the oil down to 1/4 cup, and left off the onion and blue cheese (don't care for either of them).  Per other suggestions, I added sugar to the dressing (I thought 1 1/2 Tbl. was perfect!).  I also added about 1/2 cup of dried cranberries to the salad itself.  "Sugar Coated Pecans" from this site is a FANTASTIC addition to the salad.  Will definitely make this again at Thanksgiving time, when cranberries are in season.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

This is awesome!  Like others I add some sugar to cut down on the tang. Also, some cran raisens, yummy!!!  If blue cheese is too strong for you, try feta cheese. I like the blue cheese, but my family all votes for feta!  Either way it is a hit!

I've always loved the restaurant version of this, and I'm glad to be able to make it at home.  I find the dressing good on any sweeter style salad, just like my favorite raspberry one.  I sometimes add a bit more sugar to taste.

Excellent! Got rave reviews from my book club. I took others suggestions and added a little sugar to the dressing.

Delightfully tangy. The dressing was phenominal. I'm only giving this 4 stars because I wasn't particularly fond of the blue cheese, thought it was much better without. Also, my almonds were burnt to a crisp after 5 minutes; don't make the same mistake I did, watch them like a hawk!

Very good recipe. I will make this good. I made a few changes such as adding two tablespoons of sugard to the dressing. I used pecans instead of almonds and added 1/3 cup dried cranberries. I got rave reviews.

This salad turned out great.  I followed the advice and added white sugar to the vinaigrette because it was really tart without the sugar.  Everyone liked it and a few has asked for the recipe.

The salad was great and the vinaigrette was even better.  Received many compliments on this.   I soaked the sliced onions in very cold water for five minutes to make the tast more mild.  It was easy enough to make for any night, but would be perfect for a special occasion dinner too.

I've made this several times since finding it over 5 years ago.  It is a wonderful vinaigrette with just the right amount of everything.  I have also substituted rasberry preserves when I can't find cranberries and it's wonderful!

I made this salad on Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  I read other reviews that added sugar to the dressing which I planned on doing.  Well, I was running short on time and so instead of the whole cranberries and sugar I just threw in some of the Cranberry sauce that I made(also from this site) into the blender with the rest of the dressing ingredients.  It was SO GOOD!!!!  I rarely eat a salad the next day but this salad never lost its wonderful flavor and I didn't even notice that the lettuce was wilted. I used crumbled gorgonzola(instead of bleu) and I did add craisins--which blended perfectly with the toasted almonds and red onion. 
Thanks so much!

Love this salad.  It is very refreshing, especially with how heavy the rest of Thanksgiving Dinner is.  Instead of Blue Cheese I used Crumbled Goat Cheese and I also added Jicima to the salad which added a little sweetness.  Didn't change a thing about the dressing, it is fabulous.

This was really different for a change. I needed to add a couple teaspoons of sugar as it was very tart. I used goganzolla instead of blue cheese. I will cut back on dijon mustard next time, I made one batch with half the dijon and it was more to our liking. Thanks!

This was a great hit at a recent potluck!  I too found the dressing to be a bit too tart so added seedless Raspberry jam to give it balance.  Thanks!  Many asked for the recipe and my family is ready to have this again soon!

i tried the vinegrette on my own salad creation. It was very tastey! I made it for a bridesmaids lunchion (loved that it was pink!) and it was a great balance of sweet and tangy. I can't wait to try it when cranberries are in season: it's summer, so i used a handful of craisins (dried cranberries) and a splash of water instead.

I had a new years eve dinner party and I served this salad as my second course.  I followed the advise of another respondent and added 1 tsp of sugar and substituted feta cheese for the blue cheese.  It tasted like a salad from an expensive restaurant.  I could not believe I made it (I am not a great cook).  All of my guests just loved it with the crunch of the almonds. I will definately use this recipe again and again.

Great recipe.  I added about 1 Tbsp honey to the dressing and it was perfect.  I used feta cheese, and also added some craisins, pears & granny smith apple along with the red onion and almonds.  I also used spinach for half of the greens.  I'll surely be making this one again!

I wanted to use up some blue cheese, so I selected this recipe.  I made the dressing using my emersion blender, which made this a snap to put together.  I did find the dressing to be quite tart, so I added sugar until I felt I had the right balance.  I used the ingredients listed, but also added some dried cranberries.  This was very good and the dressing is a beautiful dark pink color.

I have been including this recipe in our Christmas dinner for years.  I always wanted to write a review and never got around to it until now.  This is a great salad and dressing!  All our family and friends really enjoy it.  I highly recommend it!  I do add a little sugar to the dressing.  I like the sweetened twist on the taste.

This dressing is amazing! I used the fresh cranberry relish I bought (cranberries, apples, mandarin oranges, but I avoided using the oranges) for the cranberries. Super easy and totally gourmet. I served it over a salad of mixed baby greens, dried cranberries, goat cheese and candied pecans. Will definitely make again, and will be making more to use up my relish.

Delicious and pretty! I used dried cranberries (Craisins) instead of fresh and it worked just fine. We also put it on spinach instead of mixed greens - still good!

I am definately giving this one 5 stars! I agree with everyone about this dressing. It is so excellent. Even my husband raved about how good the dressing was. He said it really "made" the salad. I took the advice of others and did add a little sweetener to the recipe. I added some sugarfree equal one at a time to test the taste for the sweetness. I used 5 of them since the equal seems to be a bit more sweeter than regular sugar. I also used Garlic flavored red wine vinegar. I thought that this would be overkill but it turned out GREAT! I didn't have regular garlic so I used a bit of garlic powder. All in all it was a wonderful salad. I took it to a holiday party and didn't take any home with me. I will have to make this again just for me! Thanks for a great recipe. I will keep this one in my files for sure!

Made this for Christmas and my family raved over it.  So I made it again for Valentine's Day. Not only is it pretty with all the colors but the flavor is great too.

Review based on orig recipe-add sugar and it becomes 5-star!  I served this to 300 ppl for madrigal dinner.  Salad had mixed greens, diced apple and pear, sugared almonds, feta and this dressing-it was awesome... with sugar!

I made this salad exactly following the recipe, except I used thawed frozen whole cranberries. It was WONDERFUL! My husband keeps requesting it!  I've made it twice this week for him and have had leftovers in between.  Thanks!

This salad is just spectacular!  I've made it on several occasions now and have been asked for the recipe each time!  i've altered the original by the following:  reduced evoo to 1/4 c, added 2 TBSP sugar to dressing,roasted garlic (2 cloves),  used a grainy mustard, 1/2 c. craisins to salad, and poured the boiling water over onion as one review suggested.  This salad is just addicting!   and so pretty!!!!

This was a great dressing!  It grabbed my attention because I had all the ingredients on hand, although I only had dried cranberries..it came out great!  I did reduce the amount of oil just based on my personal taste. So good that there wasn't enough for everyone at Christmas dinner.

The concept for the salad is great but the dressing was a bit less than be desired to my tastes, so I bought a bottle of Kraft Olive Oil Raspberry Vinaigrette to serve along with this salad.  I used Craisins and also added Red Pears and Green Apples for Christmas Colours.

I've been making this salad for a few years now, and it's the best.

Modifications I made... I use whole seed dijon mustard, 1/4 c. olive oil instead of 1/3, and I'll use whatever berries are in season (blueberries, raspberries, blackberries all work wonderfully in place of the cranberries).

For a full meal, I'll make this and top it with grilled steak, shrimp, or chicken.  It's wonderful and filling.  This is always the side dish I bring to pot lucks or when I entertain at home, and we never have any leftovers.

This is great and would get a 5-star rating if not for the slight alterations I felt I had to make.  First, the water amount is just way too much and I cut that down to about 1/4 of what the recipe calls for.  Second, it's just a little on the tart side, so I add 1/2 tsp of white sugar.  And finally, make sure to let this sit in the fridge for at least an hour if not longer.  Other than that, it's a new favorite and even my boyfriend, who despises vegetables, can tolerate a salad with this dressing.

Excited to try a new salad/dressing, I made the cranberry vinaigrette exactly as written.  Cranberries did not completely smooth in the food processor and my family did not like the taste of the vinaigrette.  One person said the dressing looked like red horseradish on the salad.

I am a personal chef for 4 college football players. I was told one of them did not care much for salads. They love this one. He went back for 2nds. They loved the combination of blue cheese, walnuts, cranberries with the tartness of the vinegar and mustard...Definetly a keeper...thanks

Loved this salad! After reading everyone's suggestions, I too added sugar (about 1 heaping tsp) and used feta instead of the bleu cheese. I served it with a pork loin which I basted with some extra vinaigrette I had. It turned out fabulous! This would be a great salad in the summer. I think I will try this recipe with raspberries when they are in season!

This is a great salad dressing.  As I usually do, I toasted the almonds on the stovetop in a dry hot (carefully tended!) skillet, rather than in the oven; after they were warmed throughout, I sugared them by adding a teaspoon or two of sugar stirring constantly until it stuck to the almond slices.  Used frozen cranberries & added 1.5T sugar to the dressing or it would have been very sour with those fresh cranberries!  Thanks, Nancy!

Wow!  What a fantastic salad.  This got rave reviews at a Christmas party.  I added 1/4 splenda to sweeten the dressing as others suggested and it was delicious.  I also added some mandarin oranges to the salad.  So good!

The first time I made this I had to use sweetened and dried cranberries - it was good and sweet and we loved it. This last time I used fresh cranberries and it was really tart. We loved it the first time so much that I added sugar to the fresh cranberry dressing.

The color of the dressing was not as vibrant as I thought it would be.  I cooked the cranberries (gently simmered) in the water while I assembled the dressing and the color was beautiful.  Overall, however, I feel there are commercial dressings on the market that would be just as good and a lot less work.  The almonds, blue cheese, and onion were nice - but a sweet rasberry or cranberry vinagrette would be just as good, if not better

I followed others' advice and added sugar and substituted feta for the blue cheese.  In addition, I added dried cranberries and mistakenly used the cherry flavored Craisins.  The good news is that the sweet dried cranberries were a bit hit.  I did not use all of the dressing or it would have been overpowering.  Everyone loved it at Thanksgiving and I am planning to take it to a dinner party again this weekend.

I myself would give this a 5 star rating, but my husband did not care for it.  He was expecting it to taste sweeter.  My guests all finished what they put on their plates, but no one took seconds or commented on it at all.  Bummer.  I guess I'll probably not make this again, but I feel it is a really good recipe and this is just a matter of personal taste.

I was disappointed - this was a very mediocre salad.  Cranberries made the dressing a little too tart and bitter.  There are far too many better salad recipes out there...don't waste your time with this one.  (unless you make major modifications to the original recipe)

Very tasty recipe. I used feta but I personally like bleu cheese better and think it would have been a wiser choice.  I had to add like one cup more of sugar- otherwise it was way too sour!  It was a hit with my my guest-she even took some home!

Excellent recipe. I like the exact details on amounts of ingredients.  I have now been making salads with fresh dressings - it's so much better, and not as difficult as I had thought.

I made this for my family and parents and they all liked it but I didn't.  I don't know, I guess I expected it to be sweeter or something.

My husband likes blue cheese and we found this to be a refreshing recipe with a new taste - and a great use for some of the 5 lbs of fresh cranberries we had bought on our trip to upper Wisconsin.

Very good but as a previous person said you will definitely want to add some sugar, otherwise it is very tart.

This is good, but definitely add sugar or honey to dressing, as it needs to be sweeter. I freeze bags of cranberries when in season, so I always have a ready supply.  I added dried  cherries, cranberries and pear slices to salad.yum!

I took this salad to a Christmas Ornament Exchange party.  It was very pretty and tasted great.  I used Feta instead of Blue Cheese and bought candy coated walnuts instead of making my own.  It was very festive.

I was asked to bring a green salad to Thanksgiving dinner and used this recipe.  Very glad I did, what a hit!  Added agave nectar to the dressing to cut down on the vinegar taste, and added craisins to the salad.  Very good, thanks!

This is an absolutely delicious dressing that now has a place in my permanent recipe file. I made half of the recipe with the following modifications: apple cider vinegar (made a fall salad with apples), 1/4 cup homemade cranberry sauce instead of the berries, only added 2 TBS of oil. This made for a very healthy and delicious dressing!

I was in charge of side dishes and vegetables for Christmas last year and came across this salad. It is absolutely wonderful! The dressing and the almond slices really made this quite the salad. I have everyone wanting the recipe or wanting me to make it for them. Make sure you use a good deal of lettuce because if you don't the dressing will overwhelm you.

I thought this was too tart so I added a little bit of orange juice.  Maybe this is what caused the unappetizing color that it turned out to be.

EXCELLENT!!! With spring in the air...this was a wonder change!  I changed the recipe a little by adding pecan pie glazed pecans, feta cheese.  I also added a little sugar to the vinaigrette based on previous comments. I also found the vinaigrette a little thick to my liking, so I added extra water. Brought this to a BBQ and was held hostage until I gave the recipe out!

I tried the dressing with baby arugula, and the dish totally reminded me of the arugula salad from Audrey Claire's, one of the most celebrated restaurants in Philadelphia.  For color, I also add a can of mandarin oranges.  Never knew a beginner chef like myself can whip up such an amazing salad!  Loved it!

*only made the dressing* Used frozen cranberries (thawed) and it was good but VERY tart; I added some Splenda to it to cut the bite. Great flavor and pretty color; I will try it with different fruits and maybe Craisins next time.

I have modified this slightly by omitting the cranberries and water from the dressing and adding Craisins instead. My husband asks me to make this salad every week and it's a hit at dinner parties.

This was AWESOME!  My 13 year-old was not a fan but I loved it.  My cousin made this over the weekend and I just had to have it again.  I will definitely be keeping this easy meal handy.  Especially on the days I don't feel like eat meat.  Thanks!

This was a very nice dressing/salad.  I gave it 4 stars because of the tinkering I had to do with the dressing.  I used 1/2 fresh cranberries and 1/2 craisins and it was very tart.  I tried adding 1/2 tsp. of white sugar but that really didn't cut the tartness.  After I added about 1 tsp of corn syrup the dressing was very good.  I will definitely make this again with the above changes.

Excellent!!  Tripled it for 26 people at Thanksgiving and it was all gone even with all the other yummy Thanksgiving food.  I followed other reviews and used Dried Cranberries instead of fresh b/c I didn't want it to be too tart.  Also added a little corn syrup to sweeten it up.  Somehow the dressing was very thick though and I kept adding water to thin it out, especially after taking it out of the fridge the next day.  Tossed salad with the almonds, more dried cranberries, red onion, and Feta cheese since not a blue cheese fan.  Be sure not to overdue it on the onion!

Review of dressing only... Great dressing! It does taste extremely tart on its own, but tones down a lot when paired with the right salad.  No additional sugar necessary!  I made a baby green salad with gorgonzola, craisins, walnuts, red onion, and chicken.  On a side note, this does thicken considerably in the fridge - use within a few hours of making, or add some water to thin.

This salad is the most requested salad at my house. I used pecans instead of almonds and feta instead of blue cheese. These are just personal preferences of mine. I also made parmesan baskets and filled the salad in the baskets. Not only is it great for presentation but you could eat the basket along with the salad. It was delicious!

The best salad ever!!!  Based on other reviews, I used Craisins and added 2 tsp sugar. My husband wants me to make this at least once a week.  Every time we go out to eat and order a salad, we are reminded that nothing compares to this dressing.

Made this to take to my inlaws for Thanksgiving!  It must have been a hit because there was none left!  

I took the advice of others and added 1 1/2 Tbsp. of sugar to the dressing.  Also, I used Craisins instead of the fresh cranberries in the dressing.  I also tossed some Craisins with the lettuce, cheese & almonds.

Thanks for the great recipe!  I'll definitely make again!

Excellent.  I served it with spinach instead of lettuce.  I am not a big fan of fruity vinaigretes, but this is the exception to the rule.  Thank you for having it as a suggestion for Christmas.  Easy to make and pretty on the table.

I used rasberries instead of cranberries because I couldn't find fresh cranberries.  It still had a great flavor though.  I can't wait until cranberries are in season so I can try the recipe again.

I made it with raspberries instead of cranberries and a bit of honey to even out the tartness. Works great with feta and pomegranate seeds in the mix!

This recipe is so good.  The only changes I made was adding dried cranberries to the salad as well.  I also added a little sugar to the cranberry vinaigrette dressing.  I thought it was a little to acidic without it.  I doubled the dressing ingredients to make extra, which we needed.  I made this to bring over to a dinner party and we all loved it.  My husband says its the best salad he ever had.

A winner!  I (guiltely) used a bag of butter lettuces and a bag of mixed lettuces with frisée, radicchio and escarole.  I wish that I had doubled the dressing (or 1 and 1/2 times) because it seemed skimpy.

This salad was over the top delicious and I would make it again. I added 1 T of Chef John's mango cranberry sauce because I had made it, used 2 t red wine vinegar and 1 t of raspberry balsamic, and used part craisons  and cranberries, toasted pecans instead of almonds, craisons, and soaked the red onion. I did not add any sugar because the craisons have added sugar and so did the cranberry sauce.

I changed it up a little bit.  I used only half the sugar and oil that was called for in the dressing.  It was still a bit too much, so next time I will cut it down some more.  But it was a wonderful salad otherwise.

The easiest way to get it across to all of you is to say that there were four salads on the buffet table.  This was the only one that was completely GONE! Who has time to roast almonds, so out came the walnuts and I used Craisins, and as others suggested, some sugar....trust me, you'll LOVE it!

This recipe is very good. To the salad I switched to raspberries and black berries or even canned mandarins and it all tasted delicious and looked fabulous on the table. If blue cheese is not your thing, use feta.

Took this to a holiday party and it disappeared!  I waited to put the dressing on until we got there.  Also, I mixed kale, spinach, and mixed greens together and subbed pecans for the almonds as this is what I had on hand.

Five stars for such a delightfully fresh dressing. I do agree to add some sugar to cut down on the tartness of the cranberries. I read the reviews and someone suggested adding in apple slices, which I just happened to have some nice apples...a great addition. I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it received great praises, especially the dressing. Topped with imported blue cheese and toasted pecans.

I demo'd this before Thanksgiving using what I had on hand--real cranberries, course deli mustard and sherry vinegar.  Too sour and mustardy and had to dirty the blender :).  Adjusted for Thanksgiving using a Cabernet vinegar, Dijon (as called for), and a one inch slice of canned jellied  cranberry sauce (did not add extra sugar).  It was excellent. The cranberry sauce blends beautifully, leaving no lumps, using a simple whisk.

This is one of my favorite salad dressings--I have been making this since last Christmas.  I even stocked up on additional cranberries when they were in season so I could keep making it.    I usually substitute apple cider vinegar for the red wine vinegar, and I add about a tablespoon of honey.  I often use pecans instead of almonds, or goat cheese instead of blue cheese, depending on who I'm cooking for.    Thanks for the great recipe!  Everyone I have made this for loves it.

Awesome salad--everyone loved it.  I used craisins instead of cranberries and threw in the remainder  of the bag into the salad.  Delish!

This was a good, yummy Christmas Salad.  The problem is that it is too busy. Take out the Almonds and Blue Cheese. If you do this, you will taste the Cranberries even more.   The salad was good, and the family enjoyed it.

This is the perfect tangy vinaigrette, served for Christmas dinner with Ham and got rave reviews.  I made it and served it exactly as written.

this was different, i didn't need so much mustard. i think if you toss it like a caesar salad with all the ingredients it would be much better.

I love this and have had twice.  First time the group of people could not get enough. The second time picker eaters didn't like the pink dressing.  This salad is beautifully presented on a platter instead of a bowl.

Every adult at our Christmas dinner raved about this salad.  What can I say?  Delicious!  I used dried cranberries but next time am going to try it with fresh. You might particularly appreciate the pretty pink dressing.

This salad was a big  hit at the family Christmas party.  Cranberries were expensive at the store so I subbed raspberries.  I think this actually serves more as well, we had 13 adults and some was leftover.

This is one of our favorite salads.  Great company salad.  We love blue cheese on salads so this was a big hit in our family.  We make this once or twice a week.  Thank you NancyW.

This recipe had far too much mustard for my tastes.  I used Craisins instead of fresh cranberries, and I think the extra sugar in the Craisins made the dressing better.  It probably would have been good with even more sugar.  But the main problem was just that the mustard flavor overwhelmed everything.  I think that this recipe might have potential with some tinkering, but it wasn't good enough for me to plan to make it again to try to improve it.

This was really good...I needed a new salad to make because I was sick of the same old thing.  I served it at dinner when we were entertaining friends.  I used feta instead of blue cheese and craisins instead of cranberries.  Delish!  I am making it again tonight.  It went great with steak and a potato dish.  YUM!

This is an excellent salad, but more importantly, the dressing is amazing and will work with so many other ingredients. I usually keep cranberries in my freezer so it's easy to throw all ingredients in a cup and use my hand blender to mix everything up. Goat cheese tastes great with the dressing and spinach as well. I usually use a little less oil and splenda to sweeten.

Easy and good! My husband really liked it and I did too, but I think with a touch of sugar it would be a 5 star dressing. This is great and will be added to my repertoire.

I took this recipe to my office Christmas Party and the dressing was a big hit.  I substituted the bleu cheese for gorgonzola and added a bit more cranberries to the dressing.  I don't like me dressing too tart, so I also added 4 tablespoons of sugar and it sweetend right up.

This is a major winner! I made a smaller batch and thought that the conversion on All Recipies added a little too much vinigar. You might want to cut it down just a tad. One of the best salad recipies I've made.

This dressing is delicious. I did not use the almonds or the blue cheese. I added an additional tablespoon of water and added one tablespoon of sugar. I used craisins as well. This recipe is a keeper!

This cranberry vinaigrette is out-of-this-world!  I sometimes add a little sugar.

This was so delicious!  I added sugar to the dressing as was suggested by others and used the dried craisins instead of fresh cranberries; also tossed some extra craisins in the salad for added colour.  Everyone wanted seconds - and so pretty at Christmas time.

This was tasty, but not my favorite dish.  My guests seemed to enjoy it, but it wasn't inhaled.  I think I would like it better with Feta.  I also added Craisins for a little extra sweetness.  ;o)

This recipe comes out a little bitter - so I add about 1 tablespoon of white sugar. This is SUCH a good salad - and I'm not usually a big salad person. Great blend of flavors with the blue cheese and vinaigrette.

I love the combo in the salad, however this is second time I've made this and the dressing....I don't like it again. Tried extra sugar still no. I like the store bottled better. I put a honey mustard dressing from another recipe on it and then we loved it.

This was a big hit for my Christmas get-together this year. One thing is the fresh cranberries aren’t as flavorful as I wanted so I added some whole cranberry sauce for a flavor boost. I also used more garlic than the recipe which really kicked it up a notch!

This is definitely a fabulous salad.  The bowl was empty and I always make the salad for our extended family dinner and it's never empty.  I made it for Christmas but tweaked it a great deal based on others' comments and the fact that I tried to buy fresh cranberries on Christmas Eve.  DO NOT DO THAT!  If you're going to make it, get the cranberries 4 days in advance.  So here are my tweaks"  For the dressing, I subbed 1/4 c raspberries thru the sieve plus 1 1/2 slices green apple, 2T honey, 4 T water, 2T vinegar, 1/2t dijon.  I think either 1/4 of a medium red onion would be enough or sub 4 green onions, added 1/4c dried cranberries, 1/2 c fresh pomegranate seeds, used feta cheese.  Really good.

I made the dressing exactly as written and I found it inedible. Thinking my red wine vinegar might be too old I bought new and made the dressing again, still inedible.

This recipe has become a stand-by for me when thinking about making a salad or bringing a salad to an event any time of year! When I originally made the recipe I accidentally used DRIED cranberries (sweetened) and so that's what I used to make the dressing (same amount as recipe calls for). It was fantastic!! I have no problems with it, everyone loves it this  way so I just keep doing the same thing, no need to add granulated sugar!! I use my magic bullet to blend it, and sometimes use goat cheese instead of bleu cheese. Sometimes I omit the onions. I always use a spring mix-type salad.

I used a half can of jellied cranberry sauce instead of fresh cranberries.  Added just a bit of sweetness to it.  One of my favorite salads to make.  It is a pretty salad as well.

I have been making this dressing for years!  I love the tartness of it and only made a few minor tweaks- I use Craisins and add a little extra water or vinegar so it will pour more easily.

Everyone loved the salad. For the greens I used a combination of sweet butter lettuce and baby spinach. I couldn't find fresh cranberries so I substituted canned "cranberry sauce with whole cranberries." Then I added a small bag of dried cranberries to the greens and used feta instead of bleu cheese. It was excellent!

The salad itself is good but I found the dressing NOT so good.  It definitely needed sugar so I added 1 tbsp but it still needed a bit more. I also added more garlic.

This was a really great addition to Thanksgiving Dinner this year.  It was a big hit with everyone. The only thing I changed was substituting Feta cheese for the blue cheese. However, if you think you will have any leftover, then it would be best to add the dressing to individual portion sizes, as the lettuce is not very appetizing to look at the next day.

I made this for my family for Christmas and EVERYONE loved it, even the young picky eaters.  The only changes I made were walnuts, craisens, feta and stevia blend. Both my sister-in-law and new bride niece took home copies of the recipe; that’s a nice gift.  Thanks Nancy and all those who gave us reviews, and substitution ideas... I doubt I would have gotten them to try it with blue cheese and now they are nearly there without knowing it...

The dressing was a bit tart I saw some people added sugar.  I doubled everything(16 people) and added 1tbsp of honey and it made a great difference.  Also used feta and added some baby spinach.  a+++ yummmm

OMG..!  This is soooo good.  Thank you so much for posting it.  I agree that some sugar makes this better, but I only added 1 Tbsp.

Delish!  I made it exactly as written, then added some marinated, grilled chicken for a nice light lunch for company.  The marinade was McCormick's season packet labeled "zesty herb marinade".   I will say that it made barely just enough for 4 as an entree...probably would have been fine for 8 as a side.  I would have increased it by half again if I wanted a fairly substantial meal.

As others said, I took this to Thanksgiving dinner and every bite was gone.  Everyone loved it and I will now make it again when we go to the Inlaws for another dinner.  wonderful flavor to the dressing, but definitely add some sugar.

This is a great dressing! I used a little less garlic than called for, because I made a large batch and didn't want the garlic flavor to get too intense after a couple of days.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was heavenly.  The vinaigrette is delicious and would work well with many different salads.  This one I will use over and over.

I really liked this recipe. I always make recipes exactly as they are on the website first and then adjust them as necessary, so as not to skew my vote. After I made the dressing I found the flavour of dijon so overpowering that I ended up adding more oil, water and vinegar. I also tossed in some sugar and that seemed to make it better. I loved all the flavours together in the salad. The only thing I changed was goat cheese for the blue cheese since I don't care for blue. Thanks for the recipe!

I loved this salad (my husband would have only given it a 3 or 4, but he likes VERY strong flavors!)  I used dried cranberries instead of fresh since that was what I had on hand and put extra on top before serving it; also, used gorgonzola instead of blue cheese (what I had).  Very tasty and not too strong.

I made this recipe for 40 ladies today.  We didn't like the dressing.  We used Paul Newman bottled dressing instead.  I also switched the cheese to shredded provolone.  It was delicious.

This salad was so good.  Like some of the other reviewers I used gorgonzola cheese on top and added dried cranberries to it as well.  I made it for Christmas and was a bit nervous since we didn't try it before having everyone over.  Everyone loved it and the dressing was great.  Thanks!

Good, but I didn't have a way to measure the greens and I put way too much dressing on.  Next time, I'll put a little on at a time till I have it right.  Also, I won't use quite as much vinigar.

It was difficult to get the cranberries to "smooth".  After all that work, my family did not care for it. Store bought vinegarette is better.

Nine out of ten the recipes found are right on.  This vinaigrette is thick to start and extremely salty.  I thought perhaps it'd be different on the salad and thank goodness I didn't toss it but kept it on the side.  I'd 1/2 the mustard amount, I lessened the vinegar and the salt and it still came out a bit too salty in my opinion.  Salad ingredients were great.

I made this salad for Christmas dinner and it turned out wonderfully!  The cranberry dressing is so easy!  I couldn't find fresh cranberries so I used frozen organic that had been thawed a bit and it still turned out great!  Thanks!

Yum. Made this to take to Christmas dinner. I was a little worried at first because the dressing tasted strongly of dijon mustard. I added more oil and some sugar and after letting it set and the flavors mend for a few hours it turned out great. Used crasians instead of fresh, sure fresh would be great too!

This recipe is so simple to make.  I always use dried cranberries (have a hard time finding fresh) and it always gets rave reviews.  Infact, people ask me for the recipe every time they try this!
