This was by far the best fried cauliflower i ever had. Granted it is a lot of steps but all the beat things are. This is the only recipe i make for battered veggies i even use it for zucchini, broccoli, carrots and mushrooms. I want to try it in fish too! Thank you so much for sharing!!!

This batter is a lot of work and it just didn't work. Getting it to stick to the cauliflower even before we fried it was difficult and my cauliflower was completely dry.  It was too runny and greasy. Almost all the batter came off in the fryer. We tried putting the battered cauliflower in the fridge and double dipping and that only helped a little. We added more flour but that made it worse. Finally, we did the simple recipe we have been doing for years and that worked great.

Great recipe!  My parents owned a supper club in the mid-west for many years and french fried cauliflower was one of their signature dishes and extremely popular.  They always served it with a side of blue cheese crumbled dressing for dipping--a wonderful treat.  Thanks for sharing.

Best beer batter recipe that I have tried. Great flavor and adhered well to the cauliflower. Followed recipe exactly. Will definitely make again.

Positively love this recipe. Worked very well with the cauliflower, but I'll be using this beer batter technique on a lot of foods. It's more work, but it's worth it.
