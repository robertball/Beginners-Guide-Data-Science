Absolutely wonderful! I made three small changes; I used double-strength coffee instead of water and after I stirred the eggs in, I used extra dark chocolate chips and omitted the nuts only because I'm quite broke right now and cannot afford them. I also noticed that after I got the brownie batter ready, all of it would not have fit in a 9x9 pan. I used a rectangular pan, I think the 9x13. These turned out dense and fudgy and just AWESOME. Hugely loved by my husband (he ate half the pan in twenty minutes!) though I think if he had been my boyfriend, these would have warranted a proposal. Thanks, Debra, for our new brownie recipe! NOTE: To save you scrambled eggs in your batter mixture, make sure you cool your sugar/water/chocolate mixture a bit before beating in your eggs or temper the eggs (add a little of the hot mixture into the egg to warm it slightly) with a bit of the sugar/water/chocolate mixture. Once you cook your egg accidentally, it's all over. Be sure you bake this in a larger pan. Bake it in a smaller pan and you'll end up with less favorable results.

If you are a true fudge-a-holic and love your brownies the same way, then you'll love these.  They're fudgy and gooey all right, but for me, just a little too much so.  I ate one and now I feel like a kid who overdid it on the sweet stuff and gave him/herself a tummy-ache.  I love frosted brownies, but wouldn't EVEN consider it on these, even if I eliminated the chocolate chips in the batter! (Allrecipes editors, please seriously consider revising the pan size in this recipe to 13x9 inch.  Previous reviewers who gave that heads up in their reviews to future bakers looking to make these saved them from disappointment. I made HALF the recipe in an 8x8" pan and could have easily gotten by with a 9x9" pan as well. The full recipe does NOT work for a 9x9" pan!)

Everything was delicious! Except when i finished preparing everything i realized there was no way it would be able to fit in a 9x9 pan.  Instead i used a regular 13x9 pan and it filled perfectly.  By the time it was done the brownies were still nice and thick in the pan and were amazing.

This is the first recipe I ever tried baking on my own, and it was absolutely delicious and so easy to make! I tried another brownie recipe after this, and this one was far superior. My search for the perfect brownie ended on my first try! (Except, definitely use a 9x13 pan, not a 9x9)

These are hands down the BEST brownies I have ever made! I omitted the walnuts simply because I don't like them. The brownies are so moist and chewy! Perfect for all brownie fans. Thanks so much for the great recipe! I will make this again and again!

I followed the directions exactly, and used a 9x9 pan as directed.  The whole thing rose about an inch over the pan and a crust formed.  The brownie mix underneath never cooked through even though I cooked it for an extra half hour.  So I had a burned crust over a bunch of goo.  Unfortunately I let it cool, and it was such a mess!

This is the exact recipe for brownies that I have been using for years.  What can I say except that it's the best!  For a variation I often fold in a bag of Reeses peanut butter chips in place of the chocolate chips and leave the nuts out.  Fabulous!!

These were rich and heavenly, I didn't have walnuts so I used pecans.  These were just great!

I have been making these for years now and everyone is still in love with them, when I am watching my weight  and my kids want brownies I make sure to make boxed brownies because I know they can't compare to these and I won't eat them.

These brownies are delicious!  They are very chocolatey, which is why I loved them.  I tempered the egg, just like the other reviews said, and it worked out beautifully.  The brownies are very thick, but still very moist. I am definitely making these again!

WOW!!! The only change I made was to use milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet and I baked in a 9x13 pan! These are the best brownies I think I have ever had! I'll never by box mix again! This is it!!!

I work for the Air Force, in an office of cooks and it seems we are always eating something. YEA! I decided to have a little fun with our folks with this recipe; so instead of me rating this recipe I made up a rating sheet for all that wanted to have one of the treats; I wanted them to think about what they were eating and to let me know what they thought. I made the recipe as written with only  two changes: I added 1 tsp of instand coffee granuals to the batter and I used pecans roasted in the oven with butter and a little Kosher salt instead of walnuts.   My folks loved this idea and took it very seriously. So we collectively gave this 4-1/4 stars.  Over all they loved the brownies, but thought we should keep looking, after all I am on a quest to find the best brownie recipe in the world.  Thanks for giving us an opportunity to try a really good recipe and have a little fun in the process.

Fabulous brownies!  Everyone in my family loves them.  I used a 9 X 13 pan instead of the 9X9.  They rise up and the bigger pan works better.  You can't beat the taste of these brownies!

These brownies are amazing.  I didn't have walnuts so I used pecans with great results.  They were a bit overwhelming right out of the oven but once they were cooled the flavor was perfect.  My roommates and coworkers were impressed.

This was an awesome recipe! I only made one change...the pan! I used a 9x13 pan because even as I mixed the batter I could tell it was too much for the 9x9 pan. The batter was just enough for the bigger pan. I also made the recipe in one pan. I mixed the chocolate, eggs, and vanilla as well as the dry ingredients in the same pan as the sugar, water and butter to cut down on cleanup and it worked just fine. This brownie is moist, flavorful and very chocolaty and I did not find it overbearing on sweetness in the least. I used semi sweet Nestle chips. The only other recommendation I would make is for those of us who use a glass baking dish. I would add just a little flour to the bottom of the pan to help aide in keeping the brownie non-stick because I used Pam Butter flavored cooking spray and it did not necessarily work as I got a little sticking action on the pan. I will be making this again for sure!

Read reviews and baked in 13x9 pan.  These still were pretty thick brownies.  I baked for 35 minutes and they were perfect!  My new fave brownies!

The recipe itself is great, but Do Not - i repeat - DO NOT use a 9x9" pan!!! This needs to be in a much bigger baking dish. The brownie recipe is awesome though. I altered it a little and used 1 bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1 bag of white chocolate chips and replaced the water with coffee.

I've made these twice and have been disappointed each time.  Will try one last time using 13 x 9 pan.  Previous attempts have been dry AND gooey, although oven temp and cooking times were carefully watched.  So far, there's a boxed mix which is much better.

I found this recipe and it sounded like it would make great brownies. It took some adjustments to make them come out right. 1.) A 9x9 is not big enough for this recipe, you will need at least a 9x13 or two smaller pans. This is a cake like brownie and they rise quite a bit. 2.) When adding your eggs you need to let the melted chocolate mixture cool first otherwise you will end up with scrambled eggs in your batter. Also this will help keep your second bag of chips from melting into the batter. And last, just a suggestion try mint or peanut butter chips for the second bag instead.

Fudgetastic. Out of the oven quite moist, gooey, make you want to chug a glass a milk. +1 on 13x9 pan. I can't imagine these really fitting in a 9x9. If you love fudgey brownies this is an excellent recipe. Very very sweet. One cup of sugar is probably enough for this recipe. Fudgey after they cool as well, but not as overwhelmingly thick as fresh out of oven. 

My recipe alterations: 1/2 tsp baking powder. Instead of adding another bag of chips at the end to fold in, I added about 1/2-2/3 a cup of chips. I also chopped a Crunch Bar into the batter. That didn't work as I'd hoped. No crispies survived. 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. Added 3 TBSP of unsweetened cocoa powder in flour mixture.Instead of 1.5 cups of white sugar I used 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. Next time I'll probably cut down the sugar to 1 cup. I also omitted nuts.

Oh how I wish I'd read the reviews before making these!  I used a 9X9 pan and it overflowed as it baked.....the sides were done but the center was gooey and undercooked.  The outer edges were delicious and I'll try these again - but in a 13X9 pan.  Too bad - alot of ingredients went to waste when I made as directed.

absolutely fantastic.  have been on a best brownie hunt for a few years now and this might just take the cake.  Fudgey yet chewy, perfect crinkle top.  really doesnt get much better!  substituted white chocolate chips for the 2nd addition step just to mix things up.

These are absolutely delicious!  My reason for the 4-star rating is because 1) if you make in a 9x9 pan as stated, you will likely be disappointed and have a mess in your oven (need a 9x13 pan as others recommended) and 2) the brownies fall quite a bit in the center.  But make in a 9x13 pan and you will have delicious brownies.  This may be a good candidate for one of those special brownie pans to reduce the falling during cooling.  Also thanks to those who offered advice on tempering the eggs.  I have been baking for years and never heard of this very useful technique that I will not be applying to some other recipes as well.  I omitted walnuts as I don't love them in my brownies and used white chocolate chips mixed in because that's what I had.  I also have been experimenting with using more brown sugar and wheat flour in recipes.  Split the sugar 1/2 white and 1/2 brown.  Used 1/2 cup King Arthur's White Whole Wheat flour and the remainder all-purpose flour.  Will be making many times and will likely change around the mixed in chips to fit my preference for the day.

Truly best brownies ever!  Followed the directions except followed reviewer # 17's suggestion of using one bowl, which made the job so much easier and less clean up.  Used a special brownies, picture attached, hopefully.  DON't USE A9 X 9 PAN, USE 9 X 13!!!

It's a good recipe but has major errors...first of all, this needs to be in a jelly roll pan (cookie sheet) not a 9x9 dish, or else you will end up with a house full of smoke and a week worth of scrubbing your oven. Second, only bake for 25-30 minutes or else you will have rock hard, crumbly brownies. If you follow those few changes, you will have some amazing brownies.

Yum, Yum, Yum. This recipe should get 10 stars. I did follow another reviewers advice and used the bigger baking pan. Good thing. I did make one change to the recipe though. I used amaretto instead of water. I have never had a brownie this good. Definitely a keeper. Thank you for sharing.

9 X 13 PAN IS DEFINITELY NEEDED for this OH SO YUMMY brownie recipe.
The author made a huge mistake when she listed the pan size as 9x9
I've mixed in peanut butter chips for a change up and also made with a combination of semi sweet and white chocolate.
I've found that 42 minutes at 325 degrees is perfect

I, too, baked these in a 13x9 pan.  I think the writer must have made a typo!  I'm sure she meant for these to be baked in a 13x9 pan.  Anyway, they are very good brownies, I made them exactly as written except I tempered the eggs with the hot chocolate mixture from the saucepan before adding the mixture to the eggs.  I will make these again!

I made these last night for dessert and oh my...they are fantastic!!! Followed some of the advise others had suggested. Used the 9 x 13 pan and tempered the eggs. I was out of flour, so I used "soft as silk" cake flour (follow the box for substituting for regular flour). Put 1/2 bag of semi sweet chips, 1/2 bag of dark chocolate chips and walnuts in the mixture. Again...YUM!!! Thanks for sharing.

Oh my goodness!!!!! Best brownies EVER!!!! I have done quite a few variations. Dark chocolate chips, milk chocolate chips, and Reeses peanut butter chips. All have been really great!! I usually use coffee instead of water but either way it taste good. Like the others reviewers said use a 9~13 pan!! You will not be sorry you tried this recipe!!

The 9x13 pan rule should be the change in this recipe, but other than that, I am getting nothing but compliments! An EX-boyfriend even stole some more to take home, after he'd enjoyed one warm with vanilla ice cream. Even if it technically isn't a "one-bowl" recipe, to get this texture I will continue to use this recipe. I had unsweetened chocolate in my house so I increased the sugar by 1/2 cup; this makes a dark chocolatey brownie that I think will take frostings and caramel a lot better and not crack your sweet tooth. It took the ice cream perfectly! Love love love it.

This is the BEST Brownie recipe. Used a 13X9 pan as others suggested and didn't add the walnuts or the second bag of chocolate chips (although next time I will most likely add in a bag of mint chocolate chips). These are moist, fudgey and produce a nice shiny top just like a box mix would. My new go to brownie recipe!

started cooking over the 9x9 pan after 20 minutes!  I should  have followed my gut and used a bigger pan!!  Also, came out very cakey.  Not very sweet either.

I used ghiradelli chocolate which gave it wonderful flavor - semisweet (60% cacao) in the batter and milk and white chocolate in the mix.  I also only used 1 cup sugar as others recommended and as it turns out, I was running out of white sugar so ended up using 2/3 white and 1/3 light brown.  What I did wrong:  My eggs were jumbo and even as I was adding them I thought 4 was too many...but so many people said they followed the recipe exactly and it was "fudgy"- it came out more like a cake than brownies but the flavor is good.  I will call this a snack cake instead of brownies.  I will try this recipe again using only 3 eggs.  maybe only 2 of these jumbo eggs (from a farm store).

Excellent recipe. For the second bag of chips that you pour in but don't melt, I used mini chocolate chips. I liked them better than the regular size to bite into in the brownie. I don't see how this could fit into a 9" square pan without overflowing, I used a 9x13 and it filled it nicely.

These brownies were amazing!! I used 2, 3.5 oz lindt 85% coco bars and 2, 3.5 oz lindt 90% coco bars. I did not add in the chocolate chips but did stir in the walnuts. I baked these in a 9 x 13 pyrex casserole at 325 for 35 minutes. Thanks for this magical recipe!

These brownies were AMAZING!!! I brought them to a cookout, and they were a big hit. You definitely need to use a 9 x 13 inch pan though. I left the walnuts out simply because of nut allergys, they still tasted gr8!!!!! I totally recommend these brownies

I used this recipe to bake brownies for my husband to take to work. THANK YOU. These were a huge hit. I believe I heard "heavenly" and "best brownies ever" used to describe them. They are very sweet (too sweet for me, but I don't have much of a sweet tooth), but his coworkers loved them.
I made a few changes. First, I only used 1 12-oz. package of chocolate chips, half with the vanilla and half later, just before baking, since I planned to dip these in chocolate and was worried about them being too sweet. (That didn't work out so well ... dipped brownies take a lot of melted chocolate! But my husband's coworkers liked both the dipped and undipped brownies.) I added a tablespoon of unsweetened cocoa powder along with the first half of the chocolate chips. I used 1/8 cup water and 18 cup whole milk in lieu of the 1/4 cup water for a slightly creamier texture. And I left out the nuts because I don't like nuts and I was worried about allergies.
I cut my brownies into approx. 1.5" cubes, and this batch made 48 cubes of that size. One warning: these brownies rose a lot while baking. I baked these in a 9x13 pan that was about 1.5-2" deep, and the brownies rose up to (and slightly above in some places) the rim of the pan.

It is a great tasting recipe.  I've been making this same recipe (just half of what is listed here) for about 30 years.  Well worth the effort and even better with chcolate icing if you're a real chocolate lover.

These are delicious! I had planned but forgot to swap the water for the coffee as other reviews mentioned (will do next time!). I did add the walnuts and they are a delicious addition!

Only thing - I baked them for 50 minutes and the crust hardened and they pulled from the pan but the inside was a little soft and could have used a bit more time in the oven to solidify. Still delicious (just eating them with a fork/spoon instead!) and cooling in the fridge has helped. However, the consistency is not "cut into squares" for me.

Will definitely make these again but will bake them a little longer next time.

I did not add all of the second bag of chocolate chips to the batter, probably about half and I used darker chocolate chips for the second bag.  These are amazing brownies, and they stay moist if you keep them in an airtight container for 3 to 4 days after you bake them.

Im giving this 4 stars because they taste good and were easy to make. This was my first time making brownies from scratch and I was pleased with the results. I used a 9 x 13 pain, they were still very thick, any pan smaller would not work well for the amount mixed with this recipe. I will research how to make brownies more dense, this kinda melt in you mouth and were pretty light.

The brownies rose too high in a 9x9 pan and did not cook evenly (undercooked on the bottom/dry on the top) - all the effort, it was disappointing.  May try again in a 9x13.

Outstanding Brownie recipe - I've tried several different recipes over the years, but none of them come close to this one for the perfect balance of chocolaty, chewy goodness.

I made this recipe, and my husband says they are the best brownies he has ever had!  I put it in a 13 x 9 cakepan and they were thicker than I expected. Can't imagine making it in a smaller pan.  They are very rich, so cut them small.

You MUST try these! I went by the recipe exactly with no changes except for the larger pan as recommended by other bakers.  Yes use a larger pan (9 x 12) These make a good size amount.  These are chocolatey, dense and yummy.  This is my new go to brownie recipe!

OMG YUM! It completely filled a 9x13 pan and was puffing over the top. I like my brownies flat and chewy so I thumped it down on the stove top a couple of times to make it fall. The smell was killing us so we cut into it before it had totally cooled - oowey gooey goodness topped with vanilla ice cream. The middle seemed a little under cooked so I popped it back into the oven for another 10 minutes and it did fine. Soft and dense the next day, not overly sweet but VERY rich.
 Next time I would make half the recipe and still put it in a 9x13, and add the instant coffee granules as mentioned in another review to add some depth. A DEFINITE KEEPER!

I found this recipe about 3 months ago. I follow the directions with only a few mandatory changes. You MUST use the 9x13 pan or cut the recipe in half in you only want a 9x9 recipe. I also cut back the amount of added chocolate chips at the end. These are plenty rich enough with 1 cup added chips not a whole additional bag. Everyone loves these. I make them bout every two weeks

This is the only brownie recipe I use anymore.   I have made these brownies DOZENS of times and my family loves them so much.   I never add nuts (preference) and always use a 9x13 pan.   They stay yummy for days and freeze beautifully.   My thanks to the original chef!!!!

Amending my previous post. I would use. 9x13 pan. It took too long to cook in a 9x9 and dried out. My boyfriend says the title should be "Death by Chocolate". Haha! Which isn't a bad thing. Ya gotta love chocolate for this recipe !!

These brownies definitely satisfied my chocolate craving. Would have been a solid 5 star had the pan size been correct.  Glad I read the reviews for the heads up that a 9 x 13 pan is required.

I love love LOVE these brownies! They are super chocolaty and delicious, and I always make these whenever I feel like brownies! The only thing that kind of frustrated me was that the crust on the top sunk in the middle, but was thick on the outside. But otherwise, delicious!

Every review, all 52 at the time I looked at this recipe, warned that the mix would rise over the top of a 9x9 pan, so I used a 13x9. Seemed as though there was not enough batter to reach all corners. While baking it did rise evenly, not too high, and after 30 minutes at 325 it started to pull away from the sides, so I removed it from the oven and sprinkled chopped pecans mixed with the second portion of semi-sweet chips to allow them to melt and stick together as a topping since I didn't add them in to the batter. We like frosted brownies so rather than a chocolate and sugar overdose I tried a different approach. Also, some reviews mentioned using different chips for peanut butter flavor so I used 2/3 cup crunchy peanut instead of butter. I also added a teaspoon of instant coffee to the water. One last touch was a sprinkle of sea salt on top of the melting topping based on the salted brownies recipe we love.

Wonderful! I've made these a few times to send to my USAF boyfriend in care packages (they don't dry out or go stale too quickly, like some do) and now all the military wives and girlfriends want the recipe! Highly recommend! (But do make in a bigger pan...mine bubbled over the first time.)

Made these for Superbowl Sunday. Quite easy to make, but I forgot to add the second 12 ounces of chocolate chips. Seriously didn't miss them. These were just ok for us.  Very dense and cake like. I baked them for 45 minutes and they were definitely done. May want to set your timer to 40 minutes and check them then. I wonder if I over baked them....

I made these for MY boyfriend, and he said they were some of the best brownies ever (and he can be picky sometimes)! When I tried them later, I decided that these ARE the BEST brownies I have ever had: absolutely delicious! :)
~I did take into consideration, the change in pans, and used dark chocolate chips instead of walnuts (to save money like another reviewer), but these were really the only changes I made.

Oops forgot to add in the second batch of 12 oz chocolate chips. The result? A bit more of a cake-y brownie. The brownies also weren't too sweet, which I like! Like the others, I used a 9x13 pan. Definitely filled the pan. 

Can't wait to try this recipe again, this time with ALL the ingredients :)

OMG this was so good!!!!! I mean, EVERYBODY felt in love with my brownies and I had to share the recipe with 3 persons. Now the 9x9 pan is a big mistake. even 9x13 makes really tick brownies, but it worked for me. Next time I will probable bake it in 2 pans. Or maybe cut in half the recipe, because to be honest, there was so much brownies that I had to force feed my friends so that none of it went to waste :)

Ummm...what else can i say but perfection!  I wouldn't change the recipe at all except for the size of pan. I definitely think it was a typo.  I used a 9 x 13 pan and once baked, rose right up to the top.  Still kept the same baking time and they're delish!

If you try to make these in a 9 x 9 pan, you will have to clean your oven!  I put them in a 9 x 13 pan and they rose over 1/2 inch over the top.  They deflated as they cooled.  A good dense brownie, but not the best I have ever had.  I made them exactly as written, except for the pan size change.
