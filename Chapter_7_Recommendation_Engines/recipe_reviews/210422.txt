Had leftover Ghirardelli powder from a choc cake experiment so decided to use this recipe. Not bad. I recommend using the choc chips--might've been a 4star if I did use it. We don't like things too sweet but without the chips it wasn't sweet enough. Tastes more chocolately than sweet.Smelled heavenly while baking. And although I didn't whip my egg whites (I hate doing it, just laziness) it still came out fluffy inside and crispy outside. Not sure if i will make again but will keep the recipe on file.

These turned out very bitter.  We could not even eat them.  Now, maybe it was because we didn't use ghirardelli chocolate, I don't know.  But it was a well known brand of cocoa.  We ended up adding 1/3 c. sugar and a bit more flour to make them edible. I don't think we will make this again.
