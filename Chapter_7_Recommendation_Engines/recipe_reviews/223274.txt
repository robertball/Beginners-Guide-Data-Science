I knew when I set out to make these that these chops were waaay too big, and I already had intentions of heating the leftovers for lunch tomorrow.  That is, until I started eating it.  So good I cleaned every bite and I confess without shame to picking it up with my fingers and gnawing on the bone to get every bit of it.  Soooo tender, so flavorful, and I don't think the little bit of Montreal Steak Seasoning I seasoned them with or the chicken broth I substituted for the water were make or break additions.  I'm confident that with bacon, garlic and white wine in the ingredients list I would have been happy with this just as is.  I would just say watch the cooking time - I had relatively thick chops and simmering them for just several minutes, not 20 as indicated, kept them moist and tender and still cooked through.  There are so many side dishes that would complement this (the gravy is excellent so buttered noodles immediately comes to mind) but I served this tonight with two other AR recipes, Spinach and Rice Alfredo, and Mushroom and Bacon Green Beans.

I really don't get the comments about it not being flavorful but maybe that's because I altered the process a little. It's pretty automatic for me to caramelize my onions for a dish like this so that's what I did first after cooking the bacon. Next I browned the pork chops on one side. I added the garlic when I turned them. Now I made this with some thin pork chops that I happened to have on hand so by that time they were done and I pulled them. the only other change I made was using two pieces of bacon because 1 piece of the bacon I had did not make two tablespoons of grease. If you do something similar you should find it flavorful unless you find anything less flavorful than say buffalo wings bland. My only complaint (which I have often with recipes like this) is that I would've liked it to make a little more sauce. Not everyone likes things as saucy as I I'm sure. No problem next time I will double all the sauce ingredients! Thanks for sharing this we really enjoyed it. FYI it goes great with a beer.

Not as flavorful as I would have hoped.  Some changes I would make is to use a hearty red wine for the reduction,a little more bacon (2-3 slices chopped) and add some coarse ground pepper to taste in the sauce.

I thought this would be a 10-star entree looking at the ingredients, but it just didn't have enough flavor.  I followed the instructions to the letter, but would cook this differently if I were to make it again.  First, I'd saute the onions and garlic.  And instead of adding the wine to the pan and then putting the lid on it, I'd let the wine cook down to get some flavor from it.  It was looking pretty anemic, so I added a little bit of Kitchen Bouquet which gave it some eye appeal, but the flavor still was lacking.  Sorry, won't be making this again, it was a disappointment for us.

This recipe was really good, but my pork chops were WAY overcooked.  I didn't have a meat thermometer, so I followed the times in the recipe.  You can definitely go WAY shorter on the time you cook the pork in the white wine/onions/bacon.   Also, the sauce was a little thin for me, so I had to add more than the recommended amount of cornstarch.  The flavor was GREAT though!

Outstanding!  I highly recommend this recipe.  I am a novice if it is not red meat on the grill and I think I over cooked the chops but the sauce compensated for that.  This recipe is a must try.

These were ok, but I have to agree with others that said that these lacked flavor. For all the prominent components in the dish, it still felt that something was missing. The family ate them, but I most likely will not be making these again, tho I was glad to try something new. Thanks for sharing. :)

Good stuff. Chopped bacon and saut√©ed in pan with onions. Left in pan while adding the chops. Only removed chops to make sauce, but added back to smoother.

I have made this recipe several times and the only thing I changed was adding more bacon.
I used 6 slices instead of one. I have never been fond of pork chops until I made these pub chops! Absolutely amazing and delicious.
A family favorite!!!

I loved this recipe and it's always been a hit with the family when I prepare it. This time I didn't have any bacon on hand, but I did have spicy sausage in the fridge. So I subed one pork product for another. Other than that, everything was the same. We love it and serve it over wild rice. Very good!

I made this last night and it turned out beautifully. The pork chops I used were quite thick so the cooking times were perfect. The meat was tender and juicy. I used red wine instead of white because that's what I had on hand. Next time I'm adding mushrooms.

the ingredients looked like this would be a easy flavorful dish. I only cooked the chops 5min on each side (recipe called for 10min on each side) and they were extremely overdone. The meat had virtually no flavor and the sauce, though tasty, was unappealing to the eye.
