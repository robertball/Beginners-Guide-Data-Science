Winner, winner, chicken dinner!  This was really good.  I was skeptical about the Ragu sauce....but it was yummy.  Fast, easy dinner.  Served over angel hair noodles (mixed with a small portion of the sauce), with a salad.

I made this for my sister and her boyfriend last night, they both really enjoyed it. The tomatoes on top really add to the flavor. It's a nice twist on the traditional chicken parmesan and quite simple to make. Unfortunately I wasn't able to use the panko breadcrumbs because my grocery doesn't carry them, but I recommend using them because I  had them before and they are delicious.

I made this for dinner on our anniversary & it's a keeper! We loved it! I used a different kind of alfredo sauce. For the sides I made pasta w/ alfredo sauce, steamed veggies & toast. I will be adding this to our dinner rotation.

Excellent!  My entire family Loved this recipe.  I did take the advice to use Panko crumbs.  Superb!  I have a very picky 5 year old, and cut the chicken into strips.  Perfect, Perfect, Perfect!

Wonderful! But i made homemade alfredo sauce instead of using the jar kind. Also i used chicken tenders instead of the breast. The chicken was so moist and so yummy. Great recipe. Also you must use the panko crumbs, you wont be dissappointed!

Totally Excellent! I didn't have seasoned bread crumbs so I used Plain Bread Crumbs and added a tablespoon of onion powder. I have to say this is fast and easy to prepare. Gourmet eating on a budget. I highly recommend this to anyone that loves food as much as I do.

I love Ragu's creamy sauces so I knew I would love this one and it was as delicious as I expected it to be. I was skeptical about the tomato but after reading a review about how it really added to the flavor, I went with it and I don't regret it! The only change I made was using Ragu's Roasted Garlic Parmesan sauce, which personally I like more than the plain Alfredo one.. and it only added more to the recipe. Really really delicious! I reccomend trying it!

The chicken was DELICIOUS; however the sauce was absolutely bad.  I do appreciate the recipe, but will definitely try a different type of sauce next time.

very very good. I used sundried tomatoe alfredo instead, which gave it the "orange-ish" tint, and a sweeter taste

Great recipe that I will use again and again. I used my own homemade alfredo sauce but besides that followed the recipe exactly. I did feel it needed a little extra something so I will be experimenting but it was still great. Very easy to prepare and worth making!

I've made it twice now and both times it has come out perfect.  I used the Ragu light parm alfredo.  I didn't have mozzerella the second time, but it was still delicious-a new family favorite.  I LOVE simple recipes that are almost impossible to mess up!

This is a very good basic recipe. Here's what I do: sprinkle breadcrumbs over dipped chicken to reduce carbs, use any shredded Italian cheese I have - tonight it was parm but asiago, mozzarella will do, use a good quality Alfredo with minimal ingredients (no strange sounding additives or preservatives), and use excellent quality chicken (Bell and Evans). Tonight I also added a thin layer of pesto sauce before adding the Alfredo. This was excellent. Husband raved.

Loved it.  Simple.  I took the liberty of sprinkling the mozzarella cheese on tope of the Alfredo sauce in stead of measuring it.  Very good!

This is an incredibly tasty dish.  The extra crunchy bread crumbs adds an extra crunch not to be missed. We added fresh tomatoes as a topping along w/ the cheese and sauce.

I really enjoyed this. Couldn't really taste the alfredo, but I only spooned just enough to cover the top of the chicken because I was afraid it would make the breading too soggy, but it wasn't at all. Very good.. I didn't have a tomato so I just left that off the top. Will make again!

I follow directions carefully. The only variation I did was that I used the original ragu sauce, but that was not the problem. The meet turned out tough and very bland. I was so disappointed.
