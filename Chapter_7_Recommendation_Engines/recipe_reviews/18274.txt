I thought these turned out delicious. However, due to previous reviews, I decided to add only 1/2 tsp of sugar to the mix, then added a few dashes of cumin and pepper. I agree that 2 Tb would be a bit much for the recipe. The cumin and pepper, and lowered sugar made this recipe a five star!

very good!   I added 1 cup of frozen tiny pearl onions and used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream
I also added a teaspoon of onion and garlic powder

This is definitely a favourite of mine. Ironically, this is the ONLY thing I make that the husband admittedly hates and refuses to eat. Peas? No problem. Creamed peas? Yeah right.

Anyway, I make mine with canned peas instead. And, if I don't have cream, I just use 2%.  They're delicious! Thanks for the recipe!

I've been searching for a great cream pea recipe and this is it!  It has just the right amount of sweetness and creamy texture, I'm making it again tonight.  Thank you very much!

A tad too sweet and lacking in flavor, so back to the drawing board I went.  Halved the sugar, added minced onion and garlic and subbed chicken broth for the water.  The changes were minimal, but the finished product was much more appetizing.  Thank you Stephndon for the recipe.

This wasn't exactly what I was looking for.  It was very sweet, and not the gravy-like consistancy I wanted, but if you like a sweet cream flavor this is it.  I just wanted more of a country gravy flavor.

Somewhat disappointed with this one.  It lacked flavor.  I may try it again but use canned peas next time and perhaps add some lemon pepper.

tasted really good. Mine had a bit too much sweetness to it, but that's because I heaped the sugar. But still a good dish

My 2-year old seemed to be on a hunger strike until she tried these peas!!! She loved them so much that I used mixed veggies the next night in the recipe and she gobbled them up too.  The rest of the family enjoyed them as well! Thanks

First recipe I have ever made that my husband loves.  He used to buy the frozen cream peas but hasn't been able to find them for years.  Requested these 4 meals in a row.

I made this recipe for Christmas Day and it was wonderful - so easy to make! I made it about 2 hours before dinner and then reheated it on the stove with a couple of tablespoons extra cream mixed in. I also added 1/2 tsp. onion powder and it really gave the sauce a pleasant zing. This recipe was a nice compliment to our holiday ham.

I grew up with peas this way, minus the sugar.  They are one of my comfort foods. They were the only food I would eat for 2 weeks after my tonsillectomy when I was 7.

These are good, they even got approval from my picky Arica ;)  I do think that they lacked something, and I added garlic & onion powders (just sprinkles of each).  But for as easy as this was, I'll make em' again.  Thanks Steph!

This was OKAY. A little bland. My mom liked it but didn't rave about it or anything. For the fat and calories it wasn't worth it.

I too found the recipe too sweet. I read the other reviews about it being overly sweet, but since I have a sweet tooth I thought I'd try it the way recipe says. But I couldn't swallow it.

Very good, just the way my mother used to make them, after I added the pearl onions.  I used 2% milk to cut the fat content and added garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper.  I reduced the sugar to 1 tsp. per other's suggestions.  Will make again.

Clever recipe!  Something I do to add more flavor is that I add a pinch of nutmeg and dried thyme leaf.  I also make this with diced white onion.  Pretty yummy!

Very good, very easy. The only thing I changed the 2nd time I made this was to add more salt. I also tried making it with milk instead of cream and that was fine too. Good way to get rid of those extra calories in the cream.

Terrific texture to the cream sauce.  Would prefer less sweet - perhaps omit the sugar?

Super.  So quick and easy to make that I have no advice regarding it.  Didn't change anything within this recipe and it came out great.  I don't think there is anything anyone could do to screw up this easy recipe so be brave and try it and you'll look like a professional chef.

THIS RECIPE IS SOOOO GOOD!  I LOVE PEAS - MY HUSBAND DOESN'T - ESPECIALLY CREAMED.  I MADE THIS WITH THE "MAPLE SALMON" RECIPE, AND MY HUSBAND RAVED ABOUT THE MEAL ALL EVENING.  I FOUND THAT THIS MAKES QUITE A BIT OF THE SAUCE, SO NEXT TIME, I'LL USE 3 CUPS OF PEAS.  ALSO, I USED SPLENDA SWEETENER INSTEAD OF THE SUGAR.
THANKS FOR THIS DELICIOUS RECIPE, STEPHANIE!

This was super-easy, and was a big hit on our Thanksgiving table. I thought it would be too sweet, but it wasn't. I blanched the peas first because I finished this as a casserole in the oven with french fried onions on top.  Good that way too.

A great and tasty side dish. This is soo easy, I will make it often. The only thing I will change is to use half the flour, the sauce was just a bit too thick-otherwise a real keeper! Thanks for sharing this recipe.

One of my favorite go to recipes for peas. Only changes I make is using 2% milk and Splenda instead of sugar since we have 2 diabetics in the house..one Type 1 and one Type 2. This is a great way to get kids to eat peas too. The sweetness can trick them into liking them! This is always requested in my house if peas are being served. Thank you for the wonderful recipe. Having these tonight (6/3) with meatloaf and mashed potatoes.

This is a great way to spruce up plain old peas.  I like to add a couple of teaspoons of dried mint and a bit of black pepper, and I usually substitute soy milk for the cream.  So simple and delicious - especially with salmon!

Absolutely delicious. I didn't have any cream so I just used whole milk. Thickened up so fast I had to take it off the stove -- only took about 30 seconds! Thanks for sharing!

Add new potatoes and drop the sugar (peas are naturally sweet enough) and you have my all time favorite vegetable meal.  In fact, I think I'll make this (without the sugar) for Christmas dinner!

I got a little carried away when i added the salt to the dish. I'm giving it 5 stars because regardless of how salty the dish was i still wanted to keep eating it. I will make this again, but with less salt next time!

Very good but I found that 2 tablespoons of flour was too much. 1 tablespoon is plenty. The only other change I made was to substitue Splenda for sugar and reduced that amount to 1 tablespoon. This turned out very creamy and very yummy!! I brought this dish to my in-laws to serve with my pasta dish and they loved it!

Wow, this brings back memories! We always ate "cream peas on toast". It was a real sweet treat for us as kids. We loved it. I actually don't like peas except for this way. I know it sounds weird, but you HAVE to try it. You'll be surprised!!!

I've never had cream peas and I don't know what I was expecting... But the end result was not it. It's basically peas in a white sauce. I omitted the sugar after reading so many reviews that said it was too sweet. I don't think the sugar would have helped my review. It was bland and pretty tasteless. Maybe adding cheese or something would have helped.. My daughter wouldn't touch them, my husband ate them (albeit with complaints and a 'what the HECK are you feeding me?' expression), and I added enough salt and pepper to make mine edible... Then I chucked the leftovers. The recipe truly is fine if you like your peas in white sauce. Now that I've tried, I know I don't. Thanks anyway, Stephanie. :)

I liked this recipe but my husband can't tolerate a lot of cream sauces. This is definately creamy. My 1 year old liked it, but my other two kids, forget it!  There was a lot left over and it seemed that I was the only one eating them.

2.17.14 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/18274/cream-peas/ ... I liked these cream peas.  I didn't have cream so subbed one percent milk (& reduced sugar to 1t).  The sauce was good, but I would've liked more peas in the sauce, maybe 2 1/2c with the same amount of sauce.  I think this would be a great introduction to peas for kids.  Oh, I didn't thaw the peas, just cooked them for a couple minutes & went ahead with the recipe.  'Glad I tried it.  :)

I reduced servings to three and made with canned baby peas along with 2% milk. My husband ate them all.  Will definitely make again...soon.

I used fresh peas, and 1% milk cause that's what I had on hand. I boiled the peas for 5 min. in 2/3c. milk, then stirred in the butter and the other ingredients, substituting the 1% milk for the cream. I reduced sugar to 1 tsp. and added a hint of nutmeg. It thickened right away and was delicious. No need to use the higher fat cream called for in the recipe, unless you want it really rich in calories and fat:)

I doubled the recipe and had to substitute canned peas.  I followed the advice of a couple of reviewers and added some pepper as well as a teaspoon each of onion powder, garlic powder, and cumin.  They were fantastic.  We will add this to our list of regular dishes. We happened to have heavy cream on hand this time, but I will use regular milk next time.

This is an excellent side dish for any potluck, or just your regular dinner! And I am an oddball, because I like the amount of sugar that the recipes calls for.

a different twist on regular boiled peas. Easy to make, did not take very long. I would definitely cut back on the amount of sugar to 1 tsp instead of 1 T because it was too sweet and sugary for me.

Made these for Thanksgiving and they were "ok" but nothing special.  Got thicker and thicker as they sat.  Need to cook the peas longer before adding the rest of the ingredients.  We don't like crunchy peas.  :)

Creamy sauce on peas that pop when you bite down. If that excites you then try this wonderful recipe. Season as you see fit but this recipe is the bomb.

I haven't had cream peas in so long, so when I ran across this recipe I figured I'd give it a try.  I don't remember cream peas tasting THIS good!  Didn't change a thing.  We gobbled this up & fought over the last scoop!  Thanks for the recipe!  :)

I did make changes mentioned by other folks, such as 1 tablespoon flour and 1 teaspoon sugar. I'm sure the sauce would have been too thick and WAY too sweet if I had followed the original. The peas and sauce turned out great with the changes!

I had forgotten about making this until reading today , when i was young we made the white sauce, added the frozen peas or canned. We put all this on top of toast, it was a fun meal. My husband will not eat it. One night my older sister put asparagus instead of peas, that was a no go to us siblings.

Absolutely loved this recipe! Comfort foods are my favorite to both make and eat, and these cream peas are an excellent addition to my collection! I prepared these exactly as the recipe specified, and was very pleased with the results...no modifications necessary for my taste. Awesome recipe!

Made this for Easter, everyone liked it.  Just a hint of sweetness.  I followed the recipe to a tee, they aren't to thick or to runny, just right. Will keep this one.

Though my roommates loved them, I thought they were just "ok".  Next time I will punch up the spices.  If it weren't for the sugar, these would have had no taste.  Too floury, in my opinion.  Maybe onion powder next time??

Pretty close to what my grandmother makes. I used canned evaporated milk for the heavy cream, and they turned out wonderfully. I also added a pinch of nutmeg. Thanks for the great recipe!

Excellent peas. I used frozen petite peas, did not thaw first and just boiled for about 3 min before adding the cream mixture. My son wouldn't even try them, so it won't make a pea hater like peas, but I thought they were fantastic. A fancy little side dish and it was quick to fix too. Thanks!

This was a great recipe.  My husband rated it a five star.  I gave it four, but only because I think the heavy cream is too much.  I will definitely make this again, with milk instead of the cream.

I didn't believe this recipe because it sounded too good to be true,so I went back and read the reviews.  OK, I'm a believer. It was the creamiest, best tasting cream pea recipe I have ever tasted.  Kudos Steph and Don!!!

This was REALLY GOOD!  Won't ever buy peas in cream sauce or creamed peas again at the store.  I didn't have heavy cream, so used half and half, I think you could use milk and get away with it just fine.  Didn't use any sugar as hubby is diabetic.

This was delish!! I used evaporated milk because I had no 1/2 & 1/2 or heavy cream and it was still excellent. I imagine if I had used the cream it would have been spectacular. About as good a recipe for peas as you will ever find. Nice complement to any meal practically.

Not a personal favorite for me, but my kids LOVE them, and beg for them whenever I ask which vegetable they want!  I have used canned peas as I usually have them on hand, so maybe that affects the flavor.  Very easy, and quick, great side dish for a busy evening!  THANKS!

These are the best! I love creamed peas and white sauce just never tasted right, but these filled the bill.  I did substitute evaporated milk for the cream since I didn't have any.

This is the cream peas recipe I have been looking for! Tastes just like grandma used to make. I used canned peas instead of frozen, but otherwise followed the recipe and they came out great (even my kids ate them). Thanks!

Exactly what I wanted!  Thanks for such a simple and comforting recipe.  I followed the directions exactly, didn't find it too bland or too sweet.

Great recipe! Reminds me of what my grandma made to serve with holiday dinners! ( cream peas seem to go well with turkey dinners!) So far this recipe comes out fine whether I've used regular cream, heavy cream or half and half. Both my husband and toddler like it too! Thank you for a consistently good recipe---it has turned out well every time!

My mom used to make cream peas every once in a while when I was a kid and I always liked them. This recipe is not how I remember my mom's peas. I didn't have any heavy cream so I used milk (I know my mom wouldn't have used heavy cream anyway). My husband and I thought this was ok but I don't think I will make it again. I didn't use all of the sugar called for and we still thought it was too sweet.

Loved this!  I used just a tad less butter and sugar than the recipe called for.  I also forgot to thaw my peas beforehand, but that wasn't a big deal . . . I just boiled them a little longer.

This is an easy elegant recipe. Changes I made are: used half and half instead of cream, cut way back on sugar to 1 tsp. (plenty!), and crumbled bacon on top.I doubled the recipe for Easter, and nothing was left over. Nice change from the standard green bean casserole I normally made for holidays.

I Hate creamed peas. My husband Hates creamed peas. Watery, Bland, Yuk! Came upon this recipe, while looking for something "new" for last night's side..... Followed recipe exactly, along with adding a pinch of cumin & cracked peppercorns, suggested by one reviewer. My husband dug in and said: "Wow! What did you do to these peas?! They are Incredible"!  Yup! We'll Definately Be Serving These Again!

I found this to be a bit bland and pasty tasing.  Rest of the family (husband, FIL, and MIL) liked it though. Personally, I'd prefer plain peas next time though.

Just like mom used to make.  I'm gluten and simple sugar free, but this is easy to make GF and SS free, with just a few adjustments.  1 Tb. of cornstarch will replace the flour, and 1/2 t. of Xylitol or other granulated sugar alternative can replace the sugar.  I made this a whole meal, adding chopped up polish sausage and frozen chopped potatoes that were thawed.  If you do this, you need to increase the water to about a cup, or add a 1/3 c of cream.  You'll need to use 2 Tb. of cornstarch in this case also.

Wow! When I saw the title of this recipe, I thought "ewwww, creamed peas???" But they were a HUGE hit with my husband and I really liked them as well! I did use canned LeSeur peas and added some sauteed onion, but other than that, I fixed them just like the recipe said. I'll definitely cook these again!

I love peas, and I love this recipe! Tried it tonight for the first time, and we all gobbled it up. I think next time I will use a tish more cream, and we enjoyed adding a little more salt after serving. Overall we easily rate it a 5; even our daughter ate all her peas, and that's not her favorite veggie (go figure, right?) Will make this repeatedly as a yummy side dish. Thanks for sharing!

I didn't have any heavy cream so I used just a tad bit less of water and milk instead of cream and the extra to make up for the less water.

I'm vegan so I use soy milk and it works great.   However I notice there are no recipes posted for Creamed Peas on Toast, but that is how I grew up eating it.   Simply pour the cream peas over 2 pieces of buttered toast, season with salt n pepper, and eat with a knife and a fork.  YUMMIES!

This is so simple. I have made it twice, once for a pot luck and another for Thanksgiving. Both times, everyone was like, "wow" these peas are so delicious." I mean I like peas, most people do, but peas are not something that would typically bring comments forth the way these did.  One thing I changed - I added extra peas until the consistancy was to my liking.

Overall good but too sweet, creamy and thick. Shouldve used a little less flour, sugar and cream.

I browned some garlic in bacon grease and used that for the roux base instead of butter.  Served over Salmon Patties for a traditional southern dish and it was excellent.  Based on earlier reviews, I left out the sugar and used whole milk instead of heavy cream.  What better than vegetables in gravy!  Nom!

YUM!  These were so easy to make and so delicious!  My husband absolutely LOVES peas so I knew I'd have to give this a try!  The only thing I didn't have was the cream and used milk instead but they turned out delicious!  After reading others reviews, I sprinkled fresh ground black pepper and some cumin on top and the effect was mouthwatering!  I'll be making this again and again!

A great recipe that pleased every member of my family... especially my small children. I cut back on the sugar and it was still very sweet for me. We will be making this recipe many times in the future. So easy and goes along with many main dishes.

Fabulous!  I added about a tsp each of garlic powder and onion powder because they were a teensy bit bland initially.  They come together beautifully after you add the "roux".

I would use less sugar next time. My husband and 4 yr old loved it. I thought I could trick my 1 yr old into liking peas. She ate about 3 bites before spitting them out.

This was nice, but not the best. I added more milk to mine as the sauce was too thick. Interesting way to make a roux. I did like how easy it was to make.

I always try a recipe as is before I rate it and or tweak it. This was good although not great.  Needs more flavor. would add a bit of cayenne and more salt. 
Thanks anyway

This very quick and easy to make and my husband who does not usually like peas enjoyed it.  I thought it was too sweet. After eating an entire serving, my huband agreed we should try it again without the added sugar.

These are just like the recipe I have made for years. The only reason I looked it up, is because my daughter, age 11, is putting herself together a cookbook for when she is older, and wanted to know measurments. The whole family loves these. Even the ones that are not too fond of just plain peas. I alot of times will sub 2% milk, same great taste!

I was scared because I have never made creamed peas and I have never made a white sauce like this...I almost didn't follow the directions.  But I did and it turned out so great!!  Thanks for a easy recipe I love it.

Good recipe, my fiance loved it.  It was too thick for me at the end so I did as another reviewer suggested and added a little more water and butter.  Also I do not like "sweets" so omitted the sugar and added pepper.

These were excellent, though I added a tad more water and a tbsp more butter in the end of the cooking. Just seemed a little too thick to me.  Reminds me of my grandma's, which are my absolute favorite thing to eat! Awesome recipe! Will definately make again!

Absolutely easy and tasted wonderful - I used 1 can of peas (since that's all I had) and just used the water in the can.  I added some frozen pearl onions while they were boiling.  Omitted the sugar and added a bit more salt.  Used 2% (again, all I had) and it thickened up nicely.  Thank you for a great recipe that I can play around with - since I can't leave well enough alone. :)

I thought these were awesome!  Even my husband who hates peas tried them and thought they were alright.  The only change I made to the recipe was that I used skim milk instead of heavy cream.  They still turned out great and I saved a few calories!

I made this for Easter dinner, since my husband was raised on creamed peas and carrots. I just added carrots and everyone, including his mother, was asking me for the recipe. I actually was able to make this before everyone got there then reheat it before serving.

Excellent. I used white pearl onions and boiled them until done and then used the onion water for my peas. I used 1/2 the sugar since I was making the onion version. The amt of liquid, cream and flour was perfect. Thanks for a wonderful addition to our Easter meal!

Absolutely fabulous!  My family loved this recipe!  We eat peas often because some god convinced our 2 year old that peas are candy but we've become bored with the same plain peas.  I did have to make a few minor alterations.  First, there was not enough liquid!  I cooked my peas then added the butter and flour for about a minute.  Then I added in the half and half (sub for cream) and it was gone in a second.  I had to scramble to add more.  All in all I think I added about 1 1/4 cup of half and half.  I kept everything else the same.  The amount of sauce is perfect so I wouldn't reduce the flour, just up the liquid.  They are so tasty as is but I'm thinking of adding onion next time, it can't hurt!  FYI- My husband says they are the same as the cream corn we get at our fave bbq restaurant.  I agree and using corn is a great sub!

Great! Tastes just like mom's though I made some small changes.  I doubled the cream, flour, salt, and sugar to make more white sauce and I added pepper at the end.  It was great comfort food over mashed potatoes.

This recipe was pretty bland,however I did use half and half instead of the heavy cream.  It did not seem to thicken that much either. I have not decided if I will make it again.

Although I found this to be a little too sweet, my guests RAVED about it, and ate every last pea! Very easy and quick to make. Will definitely continute to make this a regular menu item, with a bit less sugar and/or a bit more salt and pepper.

I've never had creamed peas before, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I made the mistake of throwing in the entire tbsp of sugar - this was way too much. I found the whole thing sweet, cloying, and entirely not worth the calories. Thanks anyway.

I just wanted something different to do with peas and just happened to have some heavy cream left over from the holidays.  I was sure we wouldn't even eat half of these.  Surprise!  There's not a single pea in the pan!  (No thanks to our super-finicky six-yr-old.)  The only change I made was to omit the sugar and add pepper & a pinch of cumin since we prefer savory peas.  Yummy!

These were excellent.  I cooked slightly longer than the recipie called for just because my husband likes peas a little softer.  Would have been fine either way.

I caught a great sale on frozen peas that i usually use just in soups and thought I would try this for something different-oh baby-I don't remember creamed peas ever being so good.A great way to get kids and adults to eat them more often...yummy-thanks.

I was so excited to try this recipe since so many people liked it, but I will not be making it again.  It was just alright.  I think I would rather just have the peas w/ salt and butter...and it would be less work and fat.

I am a huge fan of peas and cream sauce and have relied on the frozen food kind (which is difficult to find in my area)...so I was thrilled when I found this recipe, gave it a try and was delighted in how good it was. I followed the recipe with no additions or subtractions and was treated to an easy and delicious dish. A keeper in my book. Thanks.

This was wonderful!!  I was trying to replicate my Grandmother's recipe, and this seemed like the one.  I used Half & Half in place of the cream, and it was perfect.  I served this as a side for Thanksgiving.  It got rave reviews!

This recipe was just like my momma used to make.  I did cut back the sugar, only used 1 tsp. because of diabetes.  Will definitely be making them again and again.  Thanks for such a great recipe.  Oh, after they were on my plate I did add some more salt and pepper to taste.

I agree they were a tad too sweet for our taste but they were good nonetheless. I will give this recipe a thumbs up every time, if you want a more traditional gravy flavor make homemade white gravy Add peasto it with salt and pepper and onion of choice  and it would be great
The possibilities are endless to make these as great as you would like them to be,  so don’t be afraid to go out there and try your own gravy or mix it up and put your own flair to it enjoy

No sugar, 1%mike because that’s what we use. Simple rue, milk season to taste. Yummy for those who like peas. We also used canned peas because my daughter just can’t get enough peas. Sometimes we use frozen

Great recipe. It is very good as is, but I do agree with other comments, it’s a little plain so I added a little more salt (I used unsalted butter) and some pepper, garlic sea salt and onion salt to taste.

Excellent recipe for a creamy base. Easy and fast! I do not let my peas sit plain in sauce though, adding a half cottage ham cubed, salt, pepper and stuffing into a pita makes for a whole meal.  I made  one batch and next time I will triple recipe....its that good!

Made this as written, and got rave reviews, a 90 year old friend commented, "he hadn't had peas like this since he was a child and his mom made them.  My wife even likes this dish, and doesn't  really like peas.  We'll be having this again for sure.

I followed the recipe without making any changes. It is perfect the way it is.
I loved the way the peas were firm and fresh. 
The cream sauce was awesome! I am going to use this recipe for the sauce with other vegetables, I am dying to make it with sliced potato's. 
I have made this recipe twice at two different holidays. 
My mom used to make a recipe that taste just like this, I loved her "pea's in cream sauce with pearled onions", but I never got her recipe for it while she was alive. 
Great recipe!

This was a good base recipe that was easy to modify. I cut the sugar in half, as recommended by other reviewers. I also added some chopped onion, pepper and cumin. With the modifications, it was perfect.

Cream peas and Creamed peas are two different things. Theses are creamed peas. Cream peas are specific kind of pea like a black eye or a purple hull.

Very very good, more like the recipe I was looking for.  Next time I will reduce the sugar, and add more flavour like everyone else suggested, ie. use broth instead of water, lemon pepper was a good option too.

I made this according to the instructions given. For my taste, I agree with most other reviewers about cutting a bit of the sugar out. However, since I made dish for my parents, my mother and father both loved it and my dad asked for the recipe so I printed it out for him.

If you are not a pea lover (and I am not), this is a good way to enjoy peas! I did not have heavy cream so substituted with half-and-half. Reduced sugar just slightly. Added a hit of cayenne pepper for some heat. Turned out great. Will make again. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I'm a laaaazy cook so I loved the idea not making a seperate cream sauce. I used a slight pinch of sugar added a tsp of salt and a tsp of pepper and some food processor shredded onion. Loved it with those changes.

After reading the reviews I decided, like others to only put in half the sugar. I also tried adding cumin as suggested. I did NOT like the cumin. Neither did anyone else in my family. So I will make this again, but omit the cumin.

Brings me back to my childhood and I loved it.I would have given 5 stars but I slightly modified it.Omit the sugar and use canned sweet peas(they are sweet enough)or fresh steamed from the garden.Using cream is fine but for health use 2% milk.If you like add a pinch of nutmeg and watch guests try and figure what gives it that extra comforting feel while eating it with the maon dish.Thank you for reminding me of this childhood comfort food.

This was very good but I may have used to much flour. It was very thick and I only used whole milk instead of heavy cream. I doubled the recipe for a larger side for more people.

This is works really well for the frozen peas.  If you like it sweet, leave the sugar and add a few pinches of nutmeg.  If something less sweet is what you are after, use less sugar (or none) and add some pearl onions and a little bit of garlic!!  Great both ways.

I am not a fan of peas, but decided to try this recipe because my husband loves peas.  I remember my mother making creamed peas when I was a young child and I would never eat them because I thought they looked gross!  Lol. Oh my!  These are sooooooo good!  I just couldn't believe how tasty these were!  I will definitely be eating all my peas now, but only using this recipe!!

I made it as is.  So far, I've made it twice.  The 2nd time around was much better, simply because I think I had the pan too hot the first time.  Had one kid who loved it!  Will make again!!

I chopped up a half a cup of  onion and added that to the peas along with the butter. I added a teaspoon of garlic powder and a teaspoon of onion powder as per another reviewer. It was enjoyed by all! I plan to make it again!

I made this exactly as directed except I used chicken broth instead of water and it turned out great.  Everyone loved it.  I might cut back a smidge on the sugar next time but only a small amount as it turned out so well the first time.

Used chicken bouillon cube added to milk, used 1 c milk instead of water and cream and cornstarch instead of flour for thickening since that was what I had. Used only1 tsp of sugar. Added dash of cumin. Yummy. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Very good, and easy to make, but peas are naturally sweet, so adding so much sugar to the cream sauce was a bit much.  Next time, cut the sugar in half.

Very good and simple to make. I always struggle with the milk to flour ratio for creamed peas and this took the quess work out for me. I didn't have any crean so I used regular milk. It still tasted great but I may try it with cream next time just to give it a richer taste.

good recipe if frozen sweet peas are used no need for sugar. I tried this needs a dash of ceyanne pepper. Overall peas with a gravy is so much better with a simple rue. Growing up this was a regular over mashed potatoes with pork chops. YUM!

Oh my goodness. I have been enjoying creamed vegetables all my life. My grandmother on the farm, creamed everything. Of course, it was all home canned. When it was fresh from the garden, we just enjoyed everything plain or with butter. Thanks for sharing this with folks new to creaming veggies.

This is a perfect recipe in my opinion. Add me to the list of reviewers who thinks that these taste JUST LIKE GRANDMA'S creamed peas! The only thing I did differently is bring the peas to boiling from frozen state, which worked just fine. Nummy!

Yum! My neighbor actually suggested that I try this recipe. Since I'm always on the lookout for new additions to my meal rotation, I decided to heed her advice. Not only was this SUPER easy to prepare (it literally only takes 5 minutes from start to finish), it complemented my Italian-style meatloaf dinner quite nicely. My only criticism is that this was not sweet enough for my liking. While others thought this was too sweet, I thought just the opposite. This could use at least another half tablespoon of sugar if not a full tablespoon's worth. I will definitely make this adjustment next time. Thanks SO much for sharing your easy and delicious recipe, STEPHNDON! I'll be adding this to my "keeper" file for sure! :-)

It was just OK to me. My husband and sons all took one bite and that was it. And I thought the sauce was way too thick as well. I ended up adding an extra cup of water to thin it some.

Tasty recipe, but I'll have to tinker with spices a bit (as I do plan on adding this to my dinner rotation). That is simply because I changed a few things to cut calories and fat, and I'll have to find a way to make up for the flavour. Even still, the way I made it was still quite good, but will require something else added to the ingredient list. What I changed was to swap the heavy cream out for fat free half and half, margarine for butter, and used a teaspoon of splenda rather than a tablespoon of sugar. It was plenty sweet, what with the natural sweetness of the peas themselves. I also threw in a dash of fresh cracked pepper and a teaspoon of garlic powder, but will probably double both next time. I'm thinking another savory herb will do the job, like chilli powder or cayenne. We'll see! Either way, great recipe with room for tinkering. (I'm also thinking sauteed mushrooms might be fun!)

Reminds me of the way my grandma made them. I  cooked onions and mushrooms together and added it to canned peas, as that was what I had on hand. Served them with ham, corn muffins and baked beans. Husband loved them. Thanks for an easy recipe.

SO SO GOOD!  My hubby was very skeptical when I told him I was making this, but loved it and requested it a week later :).  He added a little S & P after, but I thought they were perfect as is.  We serve it on top of toast.  Could easily add shredded chicken or something for protein...but it's a great budget-friendly food when you don't have the time/money to go to the grocery store...Cream Peas over toast! :)

Yes this had the sweet cream flavor other reviewers commented on....I actually like the sweetness.  We added a can of tuna and served on top of toast.  I couldn't imagine not serving this on toast, it MADE the dish!!  So easy & good we could eat this all the time.

I have made this a number of times now. It is so good and a snap to make. My BF askes for it all the time. I make the recipe exactly how it states, except I do not let my peas thaw. I like them a little crunchy. Easy peasy!

Fantastic!!! Only thing I did differently was that I used only 1.5 teaspoons of sugar instead of the 1 tablespoon, and they were plenty sweet for me! :) Thanks for sharing, great and super super easy recipe!

I was tasked with bringing the vegetables to our Christmas dinner. I ended up being in a bind for time, and I only had a few packages of frozen peas to work with. I found this recipe and decided to give it a try since I had the cream on hand for the holidays. All I can say is that my finicky, anti-veggie family went crazy over these peas, and I had NO leftovers to bring home. I used the full amount of sugar, but I also added pepper (about 3/4 tsp for 8 servings), which adds flavor depth and cuts the sweetness. I like crisp peas, so I would not use canned peas, unless you like it mushy. Easy, quick and delicious recipe!

these were pretty good.  The only reason I gave it 4* is that they were a little on the sweet side.  I followed the recipe to a T.  I will make again but with much less sugar and add some spices as they were a little bland.

These peas were super easy to make, had a great consistency, and this is a terrific base recipe.  We needed to add a bit of salt to make it perfect and, to be honest, I'm not entirely certain I added the salt called for in the recipe, but once we added a little at the table, it was perfect!

This was a nice, easy side dish. I only used 1 teaspoon sugar. Also added some freshly ground pepper at the end. It was good although a bit pasty for my taste, I will probably reduce the flour a bit if I make it again.

This was a big hit! My kids ate twice their usual portion. I used half the sugar and doubled the salt, and used FF half 'n half, but it was great. I may try this with other vegetables. Thanks!

I had never made creamed peas before - these were delicious!  My kids even asked if I'd make them again.

Great side dish!  I only used 1/2 the sugar called for after reading the other reviews.  It's good as is, but also good with other spices thrown in such as onion and garlic powder.  You could doctor this up however you like.

A few of my picky veggie kids (who like frozen peas and corn above any cooked) actually ate this--and went back for seconds. My husband who isn't fond of peas at all took seconds, but that could be because he was still hungry after small meat portions. I made this using half and half instead of heavy cream, used a tad less butter, and it gave a perfect creamy consistency. I also used canned peas because I figured it was the only way they'd be eaten. (I was right.) So I omitted the salt and water because what was in the can already provided it and figured if it needed more salt, I could add it on my plate, which I did, though others didn't. I found the recipe a bit bland for my palate and will probably add a little onion next time and/or garlic next time, but this is a very good cream pea side dish that I will surely make again.

this is a fairly good recipe for cream peas. Could be enhanced with a dash of hot sauce. As a child, my mother made cream peas. I thought the holiday song Silent Night said sleep in heavcenly peas, instead of heavenly peace. I thought how odd that Baby Jesus had to sleep in cream peas! Merry Christmas, all.

I've made these twice, once with frozen green peas and once with fresh actual cream peas from the farmer's market (similar to black eyed peas but creamy yellow in color). The first time with the green peas I found the cream sauce to be  too sweet. The second time I cut the sugar to 1 teaspoon and added a pinch of salt and garlic powder. That tasted much better to us! I took the advice of another reviewer and added a few small pearl onions to the water while boiling (thanks Carisa!). Overall this is a great recipe and one we will definitely be using again! Thank you!

Only giving 4 stars because I thought the ratio of peas to sauce was not right.  They were too runny/had way too much sauce in my opinion.  That being said the sauce was tasty.  After Cooking I thought they needed more salt, sugar and some added pepper.  After my tweaking I was hooked and couldn't stop tasting them.  Next time I will reduce the water amount at the beginning.  (didn't have the $ for heavy cream so used the whole milk that I already had on hand)

I love this recipe!  I follow it exactly.  I've substituted corn, green beans and esparagus.  I definitely eat more vegetables!

I've been looking for a recipe for creamed peas and this won rave reviews from the family. My mother-in-law said they reminded her of the kind her mother used to make! Will definitely make these again...maybe with canned peas next time.

I decided to try this last week with some grilled pork chops.  They didn't go over with the fam so great but we agreed I will try again adding about a teaspoon of 'Better Than Bouillon' chicken flavor to the water, omit the salt, and just a pinch of sugar.  I think the bouillon will add a bit more flavor and just the pinch of sugar will more than likely suit our taste better than a tablespoon full.

I'm not a fan of creamed peas, but my husband is. He liked the recipe. Although he didn't go crazy for it. I would make this again... for him.

I thought these were really good.  I like peas and so having them creamed was yummy to me.  I didn't have heavy cream so I used half and half and it was just fine.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was very good. I only made four changes to reduce fat and salt: 1) reduced 2/3 cup water to 1/3, 2)reduced 1/3 cup heavy cream to zero and added 2/3 cup 1% milk, 3), used imitation salt and 4) used splenda for sugar. It still turned out good.

I never had creamed peas before but I wanted to try something new as a vegetable for dinner and I came upon this recipe.  Very simple to make and I just subsituted evaporated milk for the whipping cream (as I do not have that normally in my fridge).  I did add some pepper too just because our family likes pepper.  The kids and husband enjoyed them but I was not fond of them.  I'm not sure if I will make again.

I made a roux of flour and butter and added a cup of milk to make the "cream" sauce.  I also used a can of peas, as that is all I had.  No one said they liked it especially, although they all ate it.  I liked it and I will make it again.  Next time I'll leave out the sugar, as I didn't like it sweet.

My husband asked me to find a recipe for sweet cream peas "just like his grandmother used to make."  I decided to try this recipe and he LOVED it!  He's requested that I make it several times already.  It had just the right amount of sweetness for us!
