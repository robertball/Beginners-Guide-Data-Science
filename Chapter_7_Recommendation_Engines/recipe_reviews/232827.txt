This was pretty and pretty darn good! I made several changes. (The 5 stars are reflective of my changes.) We dislike mayo and all its varients, so my version was made with greek yogurt and sour cream. I made my sauce up separately and found it a bit bland, so I also added dijon mustard and regular, a touch of balsmic vinegar, a bit of brown sugar (1/4 cup or so), and paprika. I also used more bacon than this called for (because who doesn't like bacon?). It was excellent. I sliced extra egg on top, and sprinked it with paprika, extra bacon and peas. It was very pretty. Wish I'd taken a picture! I served it to 6 adults and 6 kids. Even the two who "hate" potato salads loved it.  It made enough to feed everyone as a side to burgers (with extra helpings) and we had enough leftover to feed my family of 4 as a side with lunch the next day.

I questioned the addition of peas in a potato salad but you what?  It is really good.  I didn't chill it and it was great warm.  Save some bacon and a few peas for the garnish.  Really tasty.  Thanks soupy!

Looking for a potato salad recipe that Hubs would like, I had a couple of criteria that had to be there – it had to have mayonnaise, it had to have (yellow) mustard and it had to have celery (which I added to this recipe because in his mind it isn’t potato salad without it). This recipe met that criteria and with the addition of bacon, which as the saying goes makes everything better, I believed I had it nailed. Not.  I liked it – I liked it a lot. I didn’t know why Hubs wasn’t fond of it.  His reason never would have occurred to me.  Potato salad of this type shouldn’t have skin on it.  I won’t make this again, not because it wasn’t good, but because Hubs didn’t like it and I’m not a huge fan of potato salad in general.  The bottom line? If you like skin-on potato salad, this is a solid performer. If you don’t like it, peel the darn things.

This is delicious! Though I forgot the peas. Easily remedied. I think I wound up with potatoes quite a bit larger than in the recipe, even though they're red. I cubed them, rather than quartering. I might suggest a change in wording on the recipe, though. 2 tablespoons of PREPARED mustard. I picture some poor soul dumping that much dry mustard in there. You wouldn't do that twice! Think I'll add some paprika for color. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Simple salad to make, the only modifications I did was use half sour cream and half mayo to  make it a bit more fresh, and used scallions instead of minced onion.

Wow - this is a good potato salad and the entire family loved it!  I mixed this up in the morning using half the bacon to allow the flavors to marry.  Before serving I added a sprinkle of bacon on the top.  I realized after we had eaten the entire bowl that I forgot to add the peas! My extended family all asked for this recipe.  I served this with 'Basil Burgers' from AR.  Thanks soupy for sharing, it is a winner in our house!

I made this for my son's graduation and received a lot of compliments.  I knew we had picky eaters so I left out the peas but next time I make it for our family we'll add them back in.

This potato salad is perfect just as written! The whole family loved it. It would be so much easier to find good recipes, based on reviews, if people would review the recipe as written not based on changes they make that ruin the original recipe. ??

I didn't use peas but celery & added 1 cup of non-fat yogurt, 1/2 cup sour cream.  (we like it moist & creamy:-) ) I also used spicy brown mustard instead of regular mustard & added some parsley.   I left out the onion & used onion powder instead.  Very good!

I just made this for supper and it was awesome. I left out the peas because I didn't have any on hand. I also added paprika on top. I found that I cut the potatoes a bit big so next time I will have to cut them into smaller pieces. This is the first time I have made potato salad and I will defiantly make this again.

I made this to take to a bbq at a friends house.  I doubled the recipe and left out the eggs because my son is allergic to them.  It was a little bland for my taste so I added roughly 2 teaspoons of garlic powder and 1 tablespoon of cider vinegar.  Tasted great after the changes I made.

2.2.19  This is pretty much the way I always make mayo-based potato salad with the exception of the peas.  Yes, that was new, I liked it, and I also liked that little pop of color that they added  I used the potatoes that I had on hand (Yukon Gold), peeled them, and did add a bit of chopped red bell pepper that was in the fridge.  This is a solid recipe for basic potato salad with all of my requirements for homemade potato salad:  mayo, mustard, bacon, hard boiled eggs, and now petite peas!

This recipe is yummy - perfectly basic and very easy. I omitted the peas and onion, instead adding a tbsp of sweet relish. It gets better with time in the fridge and reminded me of Mom's!

This recipe as is is very good. I will make it again. EDIT: I forgot not to peel the potatoes. My bad. However, this salad tasted very close to the Latin American style of white potato salad just without carrot and celery. Honestly, this salad is very good especially if chilled and eaten in a hot day. I struggle to find potato salad recipes that won't use sugar and all sorts of things that make the end result runny and sweet (ew!). The peas won't make it excessively sweet. Don't be afraid of them just adjust the amount of peas to your taste. I also forgot to mention that my only adjustment that was the amount of mayo. I made half the recipe and used 6 tbsp or mayo. It was just enough. Lately, with salads that show ingredients belonging to the dressing, I separate those and whip them together (in this case the onion,mayo,mustard, salt, and pepper). Then, I chill the mixture while I cook the other ingredients that require so (in this case the potatoes, bacon, and eggs). This helps to develop the flavor making your salad taste better instantly the moment you mix everything together! I no longer have to let the potatoes "soak in" the dressing for a bit. The bacon just makes this salad even tastier!

This was a great potato salad! I didn't add the peas because I didn't have any and I added more bacon.  People kept coming back for more.  I will definitely be making this again!

Delicious and fun to make! I tweaked the recipe several different times first off no one really cared for the peas so after the first time I stopped putting them in then I used 1.5 cups of Hellmans light mayo and I added 3 more eggs and three more piece of bacon. The first time I made this I used 2 tbsp of mustard and my mom and I agreed it was too much but 1 tbsp the second time was perfect! I also added in about 1/2 cup of celery upon request and it turned out delicious! This last time I used miracle whip and no bacon and my dad said it tasted exactly how his mom used to make it :) This is a dish your whole family will love and is easily tweaked to your preferences.

It was okay. The peas made it a little too sweet for us.
