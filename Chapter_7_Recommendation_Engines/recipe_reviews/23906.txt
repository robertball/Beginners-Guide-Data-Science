I have been looking for a good sticky bun reci-pe and I found it... the trick to the sticky i found was a temp and really watch the time. If you over bake they get dry. My kids and hubby loved them.

If your looking for a BASIC recipe for cinnamon rolls, this is it.I followed this recipe exactly. It was easy to make and mix by hand. These rolls were good, but not fantastic or anything to rave about. This recipe is about like a biscuit with cinnamon and sugar. Maybe if you add your own things such as walnuts or whatever, it'll make it more interesting.

This is a great recipe! This is the first time I've made cinnamon rolls and I feel they were a great success.  My kids loved them!!!  These cinnamon rolls would be a great addition to the breakfast table or with afternoon tea or a cup of coffee at break time.  I would definitely recomend trying this recipe.

My family loved!! this recipe.  I had never made cinnamon rolls before and this was easy...I even added nuts to half the batch and made powdered sugar icing. Also was able to do this all without a mixer.
YUM.

this recipe is easy to make but the dough tastes like there is something missing, i believe it is the shortening, it throws the taste off

Lots of steps but worth the work. Made tasty rolls that are not really sticky but were very good. My tasters actually appreciated that they were not overly sticky or gooey.

Perhaps it is because I live at altitude, the rolls where more of a heavy biscuit than a light roll.   I usually have good luck following recipies, but not this time.

The rolls do not turn out to be very presentable or real fancy looking as far as cinnamon rolls go. But they really took less time than I thought. This recipe was so true to the name! And Yes they can be a very moist- non biscuit like recipe. I added my own frosting and lots more sugar and cinnamon. They were a hit!

This were very tasty, but not sticky at all. More like dough, with cinnamon sugar dustings. I will be making this again, but am still searching for a good sticky bun recipe.

in your instructions, do not mention the amount of the ingredient. if people wish to change the amount of rolls they make, then simply state "add sugar" not "add 3 cups of sugar...". maybe the rolls were good, my family was confused with this recipe at first

these were pretty good, they didn't rise very well after I rolled out the dough but that was probably my fault not the recipe, I made them into actual rolls and not knots, I also used brown sugar and cinnamon for the middle, still tasted delicious, also made a creamcheese frosting to top them.

Recipe was very easy to follow.  Would be great for a few bored kids.  And the rolls came out delicious.

My son's French class  was doing an "Iron Chef" project. They had to find a recipe using an ingredient that the teacher specified and make a video of themselves preparing the recipe all while only speaking French. He and his project partner chose this recipe. Two thirteen year old boys (mine has very little baking experience) and they did really well. I pre-prepped a batch of the dough so that they didn't have to sit around for 45 minutes waiting for dough to rise. They prepared the recipe and switched the freshly mixed dough with the risen dough when they time came.  The recipe doesn't specify to let the yeast proof, nor does it tell you to place the dough into a greased bowl to rise. Maybe due to the shortening it isn't necessary but I did it anyways just because that's what I've always done with yeast dough. I didn't measure out the butter. I just cut a slice off the block and put it into a bowl to melt. It was probably between three and four tablespoons and I had to melt a little more near the end of the dipping and rolling process. Maybe if you rolled all the dough into cylinders first and then brushed them with melted butter you could get away with using only two tablespoons.   The first batch of dough was divided into 18 pieces and the second batch was divided into 24. I didn't try the first batch. The boys cut one in half and ate it on their video. It seemed to be a crusty exterior. Then my son's project partner had to go home so he took that batch for his family. Bec
