I made a huge batch of this and shared it with friends who all raved about it.  I did make a few modifications.  I used oil not lard and added canned/drained pinto beans and a can of rotelle (not drained).  I lived in New Mexico for 9 years and this stew is very authentic.

I make this when I have company, everyone loves it.  I leave out the japalenos and add fresh poblano peppers instead.  This results in a much milder version (usually, sometimes poblanos can surprise you) that my husband prefers.

Excellent.  Leave it on the stove over night and the meat becomes extra tender.

Originally I gave this recipe 3 stars but my husband and son said it was definatly a 4 though I wasn't as wild about it as they were.  I halved the recipe and omitted the jalapeno's just because I'm not a fan of spicy, the queso fresco was delish on top.  Anyhoo, since these are not ingredients I usually keep in my pantry I don't know if I would go through the trouble of making this again but on the otherhand I'm sure it is a fabulous recipe with some practice.

This stew was absolutely delicious! We halved the recipe and used a fresh jalapeño and two roasted Hatch green chilies.

I cut the recipe in half and added 1.5 cartons of mushrooms and it still made about 15+ servings. Very hearty, I served it with sliced avocado and a blob of sour cream in top.

Perfectly balanced—distinctive Mexican flavor in a hearty stew.  I made a kosher version by skipping the pork and lard and using shredded chicken instead.

This is delicious!  I added sweet potatoes instead of white and used fresh tomatillos. Very flavorful, and my guests really liked it!
