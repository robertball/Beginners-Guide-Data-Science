Great recipe! I cut it in half, used 4 cups hash browns instead of bread, added green pepper and jalapenos.

This recipe turned out so good!  I made it ahead of time, froze it, then let it thaw in the fridge before baking it.  I used a whole dozen eggs, 2 cups milk, and 1 cup half and half.  I served it for a brunch and my guests loved it!  They ate all of it up, there were no leftovers at all.  It was a huge hit.  This is such a great recipe to make ahead of time if you are having guests and need a good dish to fill all of them up!

I always make this the night before and it is always wonderful. I think the people that are having trouble with the amount of liquid / cook time my not be measuring the bread crumbs. 6 cups is not 6 slices, it is 10 or more depending on your bread. You should not have to adjust the eggs or milk or the cook time. Don't be afraid of this one it is the best egg    bake I have ever tried.

12/26/07 update:  we make this every year for Christmas morning.  This year tried to freeze it on 12/23 due work schedule.  It did not come out quite as well after freezing.  It also added quite a bit of time to cooking, even after thawed, due to added fluid. Still awesome!
First review in 2005:



This was wonderful.  I assembled a full 24 hours ahead of time and then baked and served on Christmas morning.  I used a smaller pan, the oval Corning dish, as suggested by another reviewer.  It was wonderful that way.  I also put in oneless egg, per everyone's recommendations.

this was not a hit at my house. It's Chritmas morning, and I think I should have made eggs and sausage seperately. Too much bread, had to cook an extra half an hour and it's still soggy inside...the kids sort of like it, my husband and I choked it down since we waited so long to eat. Next time...if I ever make it again I will use hash browns, or tater tots instead of the bread, I would also add more cheese and less milk (although I did already cut it down by half a cup). recipe isn't "terrible" but definately needs a little help.

I made this for a brunch baby shower and it was a hit. It’s much better than the traditional Christmas breakfast casserole I’ve made before. A couple of changes: I used maple-flavored sausage, cubed and toasted an entire French loaf of bread, upped the eggs to 15 and milk to 4 1/2 cups and omitted the tomatoes and replaced with red bell peppers. (I had quite a few to serve.) My casserole took a bit longer than the 60 minutes – just watch yours carefully, but it was hearty and scrumptious!

A big hit at our beach breakfast!  I did have to cook it for an additional 30 minutes for the eggs to set in the middle.  I used mushrooms, red pepper and green pepper for the 'optional' veggies and sauteed some chopped onion with the sausage.  Will definitely make again!

I cut all ingredients in half and put into a 9" square pan. I did add the green onions, and used sage flavored Jimmy Dean sausage. Still baked for a little over an hour. Very Good!!!

Excellent recipe when serving a group. Don't worry about removing seeds from tomatoes. The dish is excellent especially when you add a small can of chopped green chilis to the top. Serve with salsa and sour cream on the side. This one gets a WOW every time I serve it.

Reading the reviews of this recipe made me paranoid.  I was nervous that it wouldn't taste good or cook completely.  So, I made some of the suggested alterations - less milk, more sausage and I added tomato and green onion.  It was awesome.  I had so many compliments. And, it only took 60 minutes to cook. I think that preparing it the night before and refrigerating it may increase the cook time.  Anyway, I will be making this dish often.  It was delicious.

Pretty tasty! A little too much bread for my liking though. I like a little more egg texture and less bread. All in all though, a good casserole, was definitely eaten quick!

Good! I halved the recipe in an 8x8 pan and it still took an extra 15 minutes to cook through. I used shredded hashbrowns instead of the bread.  Good!!

This recipe was GREAT!!!  BUT, I had to cook it for about an hour and a half as opposed to the 55-60 minutes that the recipe called for.  So if you're in a time crunch, keep that in mind.  Otherwise, wonderful casserole that was very simple to make.

so I took reviews  advice and I used tator tots instead of bread, I did half the recipe because there is aonly two of us, I added onions and green bell pepers, with maple sausage, and used cherry tomatoes. It was so runny, cooking at 350 for 45 minutes. I ended up pouring off most of the liquid, and I just put it back in for another 30 minutes on 400. I personally think, from working in a bed and breakfast, that the egg and milk mixture just is too much... Next time I make this I'll cute the milk, 5 eggs and 1/2 cup of milk. Too much liquid. Although all the ingrediants are our favorite, I can't wait to try it once it's completely set up!!! No Stars till I actually can eat it!!!

I made this for my husband's potluck breakfast at work today.  He said it was FABULOUS and not to change a thing. I read other reviews, used one less egg and substituted half of the milk for half and half.  I read somewhere else to use the JD Maple sausage in breakfast casseroles, so I did.  I was already asked to make this again.  : )

It's not Christmas morning at our house without this... I've made it for years. I normally will make it spicy, by using Jimmy Dean's spicy sausage. If I make 2 or double it, then I use one spicy and one regular and it's perfect; I think so anyway.  We get the Franks out too for anyone who might like it even spicier.  My family loves this.

Really good (Jimmey Dean sausage was a bit too sagey. Tasted a little stuffing like). It was nice to have a hot breakfast with no mess to clean up while in the cabin on vacation. I made it and decreased the liquid by a cup and froze it before baking. Cooked it about an hour and it was great.

I will certainly be trying this recipe again.  It did take about an extra 30 minutes to cook, but it was worth it. The cheese melted on the top, and it became a perfect crispy crust. I used green chile cheese bagels in place of bread and that turned out wonderfully.  I come from the southwest, so I added some green chile, and it made the meal! GREAT! THANKS!

I've been making this for years and found it originally on the Jimmy Dean website.  I use the optional ingredients, as well to great reviews every time.  Not sure what the people are doing that are getting bad results.  Use BREAD not crumbs is first comment!  Any kind will work!  It is a great holiday entree since it can be made the night before and baked in the morning which is what I do all of the time.  Depending on type of bread can need extra baking time.  Great as main entree or part of a brunch.

Everyone loved this recipe.I made it for a friends wedding morning. I did not have dry mustard so I used 2tsp of a spicy browm mustard and did not use any of the optional ingredients. It was very flavorful even better than the dry mustard in my opinion. I also used turkey sausage and only 5 of the yolks to help make it a bit healthier. Hashbrowns work well too if you do not like all the bread. This willbe my Thanks giving breakfast as I can make it the night before and it is only one dish to bake and clean while I am  cooking the "FEAST".

HUGE hit. When my grocery consuming nephews visit they ask their aunt to make it.

I use a bag of Southwestern Style Hasbrowns instead of bread, and there is no need to add anything other than the sausage (I use hot), eggs, milk and cheese.  Wonderful dish!

Absolutely perfect!  I made it 2 ways, one for a work function and one for us to eat (low fat).  They both were fantastic.  For my low fat version I used Egg Beaters and skim milk, 2% cheese.  For the one I took to work this morning I used the full fat versions.  It was a HIT with my team!  I'll definitely be making this again.

We have been making this same exact casserole for Christmas breakfast for 17 years now and the whole family loves it!!! It is really good with bacon added and I serve syrup on the side because it is used a lot! You must put it together the night before for it to turn out properly when baked and make sure you use enough bread! That is the key.......

loved this recipe....i did make a few simple easy changes...I used leftover tater tots (more of a hashbrown) instead of bread and put them in a muffin tin in the same order. Turned out great and are quick and easy for school mornings.

Instead of regular bread, I use Pepridge Farm Bread, and instead of milk, I use carnation evaporated milk. It comes out creamy almost and thick and fluffy...

My dad made this every Xmas. Everyone loved so now I make it every year but not the same. Something missing. All say it's good but it's missing something.  I know he didn't put tomatoes in but i used all other ingredients.  It gets too dried out waiting for the middle to not be runny. I've tented  it like it suggest when  it looks like it's starting to dry out. I've tried adding more sausage because I believe his recipe had more sausage in it than the recipe calls for.  And my father has passed away so I can't ask him any suggestions or comments on whether this is the original recipe in the original amounts.

This dish was REALLY good.  Followed with ingredients, didn't add anything.  It was perfect.  Our elevation was perfect.  Cooked for total of 55 minutes and I have breakfast in the morning for work. It was filling enough for my son to have seconds, but only half of a whole piece LOL.  And he's a big eater!  Thank you for another great recipe!!!  I included my picture.  We will definatly be making this dish again...******Note: to those who's dish hasn't come out the way it should or come out soggy.  Be sure the check your elevation..  UT's is 6100 Feet.

Made 1/2 recipe but used 6 eggs and leftover buns for the bread.  Also used leftover roast beef instead of sausage and whatever veggies we had in the house. Good way to use up leftovers. Will make again.

I had several left over rolls that were hardened through and through.  I was determined to use them instead of throwing out and came upon this recipe.  It worked great and was delicious for a New Years breakfast.  There were several other improvisions to accomodate what I had on hand.  I used 2 packages (10 links each) breakfast sausage links, heated and sliced; 5 slices swiss cheese, shredded pepper jack cheese and grated Parmesean cheese instead of cheddar cheese; added fresh diced mushrooms, green pepper, and onion; the bread amount was slightly more than 6 cups, so I threw in an exta egg but left milk amount alone; used 1-1/2 cup milk and 1-1/2 cup half-and-half.  After cooking full 60 minutes in stoneware the consistency was perfect.  Maybe using very dry bread helped soak up the liquid.

This is very good! I made this recipe for Easter brunch with a few modifications. I did't have the dry mustard so I used a dash of the liquid kind. I added green chili's to the cooked sausage for best taste and spreads better throughout the casserole. I added 1/2 vidalia onion & 1/2 green pepper also. In the egg & milk mixture I added approx. 1 tsp of cinnamon. This was a big hit!

My family loved this when I made it for them for Christmas morning! The kids are not big on eggs but they certainly gobbled it up. I've made it for Sunday morning breadkfast a couple of times thereafter. Once I substituted with regular bread, toasted with garlic and butter-it was great. Then another time I substituted with garlic herb croutons-super! Now I'm going to make it for a faculty breakfast and this time it'll be with Texas Garlic Toast. Any way you make this basic recipe, it'll be wonderful!

I used the reduced fat sausage and all of the optional ingredients.  I don't like cheddar cheese, so I used Monterrey Jack (it melts nicer).  I had about 10 people for brunch, and everyone liked it - there was none left!

I have searched for this recipe since I lost it after making it for Thanksgiving and Christmas morning last year...it is that good! I have tried maple sausage in it and that works great. I have always skipped the tomatoes and have used a red onion instead of green onions and have put a tsp or so of hot pepper sauce in instead of the dried nustard. This is a great recipe to add personal touches to, it is very flexible. The kids and the adults love it!

Family has loved this as written for years.  We always use turkey breakfast sausage as personal preference. Today I did not have any mushrooms so I omitted. Eggs seemed small today so I added 1/3 cup egg whites. Baked at 350 for 10. 325 for 40. Turned out amazing.

I made this recipe for my Book Club.  I did forget to put in the tomatoes and put in about a teaspoon or two of Marjoram.  THEY LOVED IT! I made it the day before and refrigerated it and then popped it in the oven for about 45 minutes.  I'm making it again this weekend for my daughter's baby shower!

Just made this for dinner tonight. It tasted great but it was a little soggie. I used sausage links because that was all i had, i also added 1 tsp onion powder and 1 tsp garlic powder, i also did not put in the veggies as i didn't want to make another trip to the store, next time i make this i think that i will use potatoes instead of the bread, and deffinetly wont forget the veggies.

Delicious.  I had my own four children and my son's triplet friends over for dinner and we polished off the whole dish.

The first time I made this I used the instructions and it was okay. I made some changes and I used shredded hashbrowns instead of bread and I added mushrooms, green chiles and half pund of bacon. You can also add some salsa and tortillas. YUM!

It was okay.  It needed more spice or something.  The next time I make it I'll try using croutons instead of bread.  It's easier if you're using bread to just lay the slice of bread instead of cubing it.  I made it the night before.  Good starter recipe though.

I used 12 eggs, half 1% milk and half soymilk, and only 3 cups bread as other reviewers suggested.  I added a cut up portobello mushroom, yellow bell pepper, red onion instead of green and celery for some crunch (and to get as many veggies as possible in there).  It took 1.5 hours to bake in a 325 degree oven in my large 9X13 dish.  I took it to a women's group and everyone seemed to like it.  Next time I will also add tomato (I forgot!).

This was great, but I made some changes. I used  1 1/2 tsp Adobo instead of the salt, and 1/2 tsp black pepper instead of 1/4 tsp, 3 cups of cubed bread instead of 6 (thanks to all the other reviewrs' suggestions), 32 oz of sausage instead of 16 oz, and 12 instead of 10 eggs. I also added 1/4 tsp cumin, 2 tbsp minced garlic, and 1 chopped yellow pepper. I stir fried the garlic with the saussage, dry mixed all the spices separetly and then layered and mixed everything in the dish. Make sure the cheese is well mixed in the dish. It came out very moist and rich. I may use a bit less milk next time, though. Try it, it is wonderful!

Delicious - traditional breakfast casserole. I doubled it for a housefull of family - and it got rave reviews... nothing left in either pan! Served this with cheesy Rotel grits and fresh fruit salad. Awesome.

Fantastic! I scaled it back to feed 4 people and used maple sausage patties that I cooked, cubed, and set aside.  I then sauteed 1/2 red pepper, chopped with 1/2 Vidalia onion, chopped.  Removed from pan and sauteed some sliced mushrooms.  I used my homemade Portuguese Sweet Bread from AllRecipes.com.  The only major change I made was that instead of dry mustard, I used cumin, chili powder, and some Mrs. Dash Garlic and Herb seasoning and I used 1/2 soy milk and 1/2 regular milk --- no one noticed!  This is a great easy recipe that you can make ahead.  I served half and the other half I put in individual containers for breakfast the next day before work and school.  Say goodbye to frozen waffles and cold cereal!

Absolutely delicious!  My husband's family met Christmas Eve morning for breadfast and this was my contribution to the meal.  Everyone loved it.  I omitted the mushrooms because my husband doesn't like them.  I also used Sage recipe sausage instead of regular because we all prefer that.  This makes a 9 X 13 dish completely full, so it's a generous amount.  I will definitely make it again.

This was fantastic!  I made mostly minor changes because of available ingredients.  I used low fat Jimmy Dean sausage, cooked with chopped red peppers and onions.  I also sauteed the mushrooms and combined with sausage mixture.  Super easy to combine the night before and pop in oven in the morning.  I put in a deep oval casserole dish so it was a lot thicker and actually served about 8 people.  Adding this one to my recipe box!

I made this as a last minute quick brunch when visitors announced they were in town, and would stop by.  It came out great - even without being able to allow any time for the egg-milk mixture to really soak into the bread before baking!  I used extra cheese to top it, but did wait to top it off with the cheese until the last 15 minutes of bake time.  The cheese topping was still nice and gooey that way - not in any way overcooked and rubbery.  I will definitely serve this delicious brunch casserole again!

I've been making this for several years.  The reason for refrigerating overnight is to give the egg-milk mixture a chance to soak the bread... it seems to meld it.  I sometimes make it in 2 pans and freeze one (already baked).  Let it warm enough to cut into servings (or freeze in servings) and nuke it for about a minute.  Salsa or sliced tomatoes make a nice side.  I find 12 eggs and another 1/2 cup of half and half work well when dividing into 2 pans.  Be careful with the salt if you're using sharp cheddar.

SOOO delicious and comforting.  I've made it without any veggies, and it's still really good. Make sure you're using the right amount of bread-- if you only use a few slices you'll have wet mess.  I've made other breakfast casseroles that use cubed potatoes, but this is far better.

This was delicious! I add a package of bacon to the recipe because my husband and I love bacon. Instead of cutting a loaf of bread I used half a bag of potato bread cubes (meant for stuffing, but the cubes are soft). I pulled out my phone to take a pictures and before I could open the camera half the casserole was gone. My family loved it!

I thought this was ok. My biggest issue was the 6 cups of bread.  Maybe weight would be better.  I had far to much bread in it so maybe i packed it to much in measuring cups .  It was barely an egg dish.  Next time less bread or maybe I'll try a different recipe.  It didn't have a lot of flavour.  Again, maybe due to all that bread.

I was out of milk so used half and half. Spicy Italian sausage instead of Jimmy Dean. I forwent the tomatoes and mushrooms but added more green onions to the top. I used Hawaiian rolls for the bread. The house smells divine!

I love this recipe! With the key ingredients, I like to add a few vegetables (broccoli, kale, etc.) & even cubed apples & cranberries, which the kids really love; and since I always manage to have left over pieces of Asiago, garlic or other bread types that I keep in the freezer, I use that for the cubed bread. Yummy! I found it easier to bake it in a muffin tray instead & being that they freeze very well, it makes breakfast a breeze when in a hurry!

I substituted shredded bagels for the bread, red & green bell peppers for the mushrooms & tomatoes and added a generous portion of Creole seasoning to liven this recipe up. The bagels seem to hold up better to the egg mixture and don't get too soggy. (PS - don't forget to drain the sausage after you cook it or it'll add too much moisture!) 

Its now become a staple in our house whenever we have house-guests, a long weekend or a holiday. (I substitute the meat for chopped ham for Easter, Turkey sausage for Thanksgiving, andouille sausage for Mardy Gras, etc)  I love it with vanilla yogurt on side, but Hubby prefers it with hot sauce.

I love this recipe, I tried another breakfast casserole at the same time from this site,  since we had a big crowd. And the flavor from the sausage knocked it out of the park for this casserole.  I seeded cherry tomatoes and put them, and the green onions on top, cuz come on it was Christmas.  Everyone asked me for the recipe.  Sooooooooooooooo easy!!!   Same time next year ;)

I made this with hash browns like others had suggested. The first time I didn't cook them first and it was a little soggy. I cooked them the next time, and it turned out much better. Everyone liked the crispy texture it added. I also reduced the amount of milk by maybe 1/2 to 3/4 of a cup. With a couple tweeks this is a great recipe.

without including the 'optional' mushrooms, tomatoes, & green onions, this is a pretty standard breakfast casserole  (although with 10eggs & 3cups of milk & 6cups torn bread, it will BARELY fit in a 9x13x2 dish -- set your dish on a cookie sheet in case it 'runs over' in your oven, as mine did!!)

I made this for breakfast on Christmas and halved the recipe since it's just 2 of us.  It was okay.  We ate it as well as the leftovers, but it won't be a repeat.  The egg mixture so thoroughly soaked the bread that my husband didn't even realize there was any bread in it!  The casserole did not taste soggy per se and it wasn't wet, it was just softer than we prefer and almost mushy.  This recipe is worth repeating though with less milk (for a full recipe I would cut the milk down to 2 cups) and maybe cooked, diced potatoes instead of the bread.  That sounds yummy!  I'll bet the suggested additions of mushrooms, tomato, and green onion would be really good, especially if you saute the mushrooms first.

i thought this was great!!  made it exactly as written, just halved.  didn't add any of the 'optional' ingredients.  i made this about 16 hours before i baked it- i was worried that the bread would get soggy sitting in the fridge with all that liquid (and looked through reviews to see if anyone had addressed this), but it didn't!  definitely measure the bread, i "eyeballed" it at first, thought better of it and measured it out- i didn't have nearly enough before.

We loved this casserole.  I used 3 pepper and cheese bagels for the cubed bread and used the hot sausage instead of the regular.  Perfect!

This was a huge hit and I will make it again.  Very easy.  I toasted the bread and added scallions.  I think it would be great with some salsa on top or on the side.  I would love to try with hash browns.  Was not runny or soggy and cooked perfectly.  Try this recipe if you have overnight guests or need to bring a dish to  brunch or breakfast.

Although this recipe has the potential to be excellent, I was a little disappointed in my results. Maybe it's because I made it and refrigerated it the night before and cooked it the next morning. I had it in the oven for 1 hour 20 minutes and it was still runny in the middle. The outside edges were really good and very tasty, but I couldn't serve it runny like it was and ran out of time to bake. I used the White Bread II recipe from allrecipes which I made in my bread machine for the bread cubes, the bread was perfect. Next time I will use less eggs as other reviewers have suggested.

Extremely sloppy!! You will need to cook it far longer than recommended.  I cooked at 350 (higher temp than recommended) for 70 minutes and it was still wet, slimy, and the pieces would not hold together.  I made recipe EXACTLY as written.

Such an easy casserole to get together! I made it the evening before Father's Day, and it was a delicious treat to serve the 'Dad of Honor'.  I actually used turkey sausage in lieu of pork sausage, and it came out just as good - even the picky kids could not resist the combination of cheese, eggs, sausage, and bread (I used multigrain) rolled into one.  If I get very daring, I may try it with Egg Beaters and some vegetables (I did add tomatoes, but wanted to keep it basic for the first time).  Enjoy!!!

My family loves this meal.  And I love that I can prepare it the night before.  I don't make it too often bc of all the calories and we're more of a cereal-for-breakfast family, but anytime I *do* want to make a big breakfast, this is what I make.

This recipe is FANTASTIC, especially with the optional extra fixings. Seeded roma tomatoes worked very well and didn't make the casserole soggy. It's also just as good with shredded co-jack. The last time I made it, my dad called me three days later to compliment me on it again.

Easy, straightforward recipe. It really comes down to if you want a breakfast casserole filled with bread or potatoes. I added the optional mushrooms to the sausage while it was still in the skillet, so they cooked a bit before going into the casserole dish. Plenty of flavor thanks to the sausage, but I recommend keeping a good hot sauce handy to add some kick after serving up.

Removed the onions and peppers because it made it too watery. Replaced bread with tater tots. Reduced milk from 3 cups to 2 cups and added two more eggs.  Family favorite every time we have guests.

I made mine the night before which was so nice and easy for in the morning. I had too much liquid but maybe it was the fact that I used skim milk.  It could use a little more flavor but overall it was good and pretty easy.

I make this with a package of frozen O’Brien potatoes instead of bread. I assemble the night before and bake off in the morning. Takes 15 minutes more because it is cold.  I take it to work often. They love it.

Make several of these for a houseboat vacation with the guys. Altered each with adding jalapeños  for a spicy flavor, one by the recipe and, one added bacon and  maple flavored breakfast sausage. Everyone totally enjoyed. An easy meal to feed a group of people. No leftovers.

It turned out great! I just added tomatoes, onion powder, and a little paprika.

I added onion rather than peppers and shredded hash browns. I also mixed it all up and cooked it with foil then browned the top afterwards. Also no mustard or tomatoes. It was great!

Loved it! So moist. Not dry like others I've had. Will definitely make this again.  May add some of the optional ingredients next time just to try.  : )

The whole kitchen smells delicious and we can’t wait to dig in. I lessened the milk by half a cup and added the same quantity of ricotta cheese. I think it’s creamier and even more delicious, if that’s even possible!

Made this for friends Christmas brunch. I adjusted only a little because I didn’t think it was enough sausage. I had some cubed ham so I added that. Everyone loved it. It did take about 1 1/2 hours to bake but I planned ahead after reading the reviews.

This is my go to dish whenever I host a brunch at my house. I love it because you can prepare it the night before, put in the fridge uncooked, and bake it the next door an hour before your guests arrive. I make a few changes to make this amazing. I use 11 eggs, 1 16oz package of regular sausage and an 8 oz package of hot sausage. I add 1 can of diced green chiles, and 1 medium seeded tomoatoe. Super easy and delicious. Just make sure to make extra copies of the recipe because you will be asked for it after your guests taste this dish. P.S. It makes amazing leftovers too. I am eating a piece as I type this. :)

The recipe was simple and the taste was delicious.  Next time I would probably add some diced and de-seeded jalapeños just spice it up slightly.

Made it as-is, not a fan. However, sort of made it again. Used a bag of Jimmy Dean Skillets, poured that (still frozen) into a greased, glass casserole dish, 8x11. Covered with 5 beaten eggs and 1 cup milk. Baked 350 until done which happened to be 40 mins. Even easier.

I made this exactly as directed (I used tomatoes that I seeded and drained well on paper towels, green peppers and green onions)and stuck in the refrigerator overnight. I raised the oven temperature to 340 for the first 30-35 minutes then cut it back to 325 because a lot of people said it didn't set up right. This was very good-BUT it does need more sausage and cheese. Just my preference.  I will make this again

This was really good. I made it the night before with the maple sausage and used the cut bread. It is light and not heavy like some of the breakfast casseroles tend to be.

Just made this and I really like it.  I made it exactly as written (except I left out the optional veggies) and I will make this again.  The flavor was really good and it was pretty easy to put together.  If you're not much of a meat lover, I would suggest using half the amount of sausage. :)

Make sure you don't put in too many veggies as additional veggies will make the cooking time extend quite a lot. Overall great recipe!

Recipe turned out pretty good.  I halved the recipe to make a smaller casserole in a 9x9 dish.  I cooked the Jimmy Dean maple sausage for this dish.  It added a nice flavor. I added green bell peppers to the optional veggie list and kept out the mushrooms.  As far as the bread, I cubed a braided loaf of brioche bread.  My husband and toddler loved this dish and it’s been added to the keeper list.

I made this recipe twice over the holidays, for two separate, large get-together (one for work, one for family)—it was a hit at both parties! Notes: I substituted 6-8 cups frozen hash browns (thawed) for the bread; I used a dozen eggs (instead of ten); I substituted 1/2 cup half-and-half for 1/2 cup milk (next time, I’ll substitute 1 cup for 1 cup). I also froze one casserole, while I made the other the night before. The frozen casserole was more watery, but I drained it off before serving and it did not seem to significantly effect the flavor. I served with cinnamon rolls and banana bread. Delicious!

Prepared this casserole when I had all the family home for a visit.  I added sliced zucchini which is always good with egg.  Everyone loved it!   It is my new favorite breakfast recipe.  I was glad it did not require overnight in the refrigerator since there was no extra space in there.  
There was some leftover, so the following day, I reheated it in the oven, and it tasted even better!  Delicious recipe!!

It turned out a bit soggy. Next time I will try using 2 cups of milk. I added 1/2 cup sliced mushrooms, 1 diced red pepper and more cheddar cheese.

Family loved it. I used Texas toast bread and omitted the tsp of salt. I ended up cooking it 15 mins more than indicated, but the extra time was not a big deal. Will make again!

I had some leftovers from a party and wanted to use them and found this casserole was a great way to use some buns and chopped broccoli. I'm glad I didn't read reviews and prepared the recipe as is. It turned out perfect. I did not refrigerate ahead of time so I have to wonder if that impacts the reviews of those saying it was too wet. I baked for 55 min using 10 eggs and 3 cups whole milk, but no tomatoes or peppers. I used the broccoli instead. The family loved it. The only minor change was that I finished up a bag of cheese which added about 1/2 cup. Saving to favorites and will be made again. Thanks!

03.12.17 ~ I needed to make a breakfast casserole with ingredients I had on hand.  This fit the bill, and it is delicious.  I especially like that it is the type of casserole you can make the night before.  I opted to use the diced tomatoes, and yellow onion, but skipped the mushrooms.  It bake up and served beautifully.   We are a Sunday brunch casserole family - and this is a great one.

This makes the best breakfast casserole I've ever had. However, four cups of bread is plenty of bread for a perfect combination.

I used 12 slices of cubed bread with crusts removed, cut the milk to 2 cups and added about 1/2 cup of sour cream. It turned out great.

I reduced the recipe for 6 and added frozen potatoes o'brien to the ingredients. I also added  Fox Point seasoning by Penzeys Spices, plus chopped fresh chives.  My guests had second helpings; therefore, there weren't any leftovers! I will definitely make this recipe again. Very easy recipe and great flavor!

Made this with left over roasted vegetables, and a chopped tomato as extras, and cut the cheese amount in half.  Choose the bread carefully, because it will make a difference in the flavor of your casserole.  I used what I always have in the house, which is sprouted bread.   This is a keeper in our home.

Thanks for posting.

I cut the recipe in half - there's only two of us and there was still enough left over for 2 more servings.  It was wonderful. Cut back a little on the milk - used 1.25 cups instead of 1.5 since others said theirs was soggy and sautéed red bell pepper and onion with the sausage.  Baked for 50 minutes - not soggy at all. We are nearly at sea level though so that might have had an effect.  My husband didn't think he was going to like it so I was surprised when he said "yeah, you can make this again, I'll eat it"  From him, that was a big compliment - he's pickier than a five year old when it comes to what he'll eat.

I don't eat pork so I used chicken sausage instead. I did add the mushrooms and green onions. I prepared it the afternoon before and left it in the fridge so all I had to do was pop it in the oven the next morning.  It was delicious.

I made this for the first time this morning and it wasn't a breeze.  Took me about 45 minutes to get it in the oven - I made it exactly as the recipe says and it took an hour to cook (could have cooked for another 15 minutes easily.  It tasted a bit bland.  My husband liked it but he covers it in tabasco so he thought it had lots of flavor.  If I ever do this again I will add more onions, green peppers, cayenne, more salt and I'll use Jimmy Dean Hot sausage.

I love this recipe. I have made it for colleagues and they continually ask me for the recipe. I always add small amounts of 'various' optional additions to this recipe. 

It has become a 'special' occasion brunch recipe for me.

I've been making this casserole for about 12 years for Christmas morning. Most of the time I half the recipe since the portions are huge and we only have three people. I switch the sausage for ham and I usually end up cooking it 1.5 to 2 hours since it seems to be runny still if I cook it for the time stated in the recipe. All in all it's a great recipe that my family keeps coming back to year after year

I followed this recipe very closely, with the exception of cooking one small onion and a red bell pepper in with the sausage and adding some ground black pepper to the egg mixture.  

In my opinion this was just an okay dish. It did set up and was not soggy but it was very bland.

I made no changes. I didn't add the optional ingredients. I happened to have english muffin bread onhand. Almost any bread would work well I think. It cooked perfectly . Very good. My company loved it! I served it with fruit. It reminds me of a strata.  I will make this again. It would make a great base too. Next time I want to use Diced ham, green peppers and onions, like a Denver omelette .

I have made this for years and it is a pretty foolproof recipe and always tastes great .  The person who taught me this recipe years ago also spread a layer of Campbells condensed cream of  mushroom soup (right out the can) on the top of the last layer before sprinkling with cheese.   Sounds a little wierd but adds moisture and a little depth to the flavor.  This seems to be a good substitute for people who do not like whole sliced mushrooms which some reecipes call for.

Added fresh green onion, sweet peppers and sweet onion. Forgot pepper but those ingredients alone made the taste superb. My husband didn't like the bread and truthful neither did I. I cooked it for an hour and the middle was still soggy like. Not sure if I used to many eggs and milk but this recipe is something I won't be running to try again. I will stick to my own breakfast casserole as potatoes work better in my opinion.

Perfect for breakfast and even better for leftovers! I ended up buying the maple flavor of jimmy dean sausage and it adds such a good flavor! I also decreased the milk by a cup since it seemed like it was too much. I also bought hashbrowns frozen and there are options with onions and red and green peppers and I have opted for that for more flavor! Thank you for sharing this recipe and I will be making this time and time again!!

I've tried many breakfast casseroles and this was the first one that didn't shrink to half it's size when I removed it from the oven.  It "fell" a little, but still stayed nice and fluffy.  I didn't add any of the optional ingredients since I have picky eaters, but everyone loved it.  I think the secret is the layering.  This is my "go to" morning casserole now for sure!

I made this for a brunch potluck and it was a hit!  I got so many compliments about how tasty it was.  I made some modifications:

I used 12 eggs, 2 pillsbury crescent rolls, 4 slices of bread cubed, green onions, and 1 can of mushroom pieces.   Everything else was the same.  I layered the bottom with one crescent roll tube followed by half the ingredients.  Then I repeated the layer with the second crescent roll followed by the cubed bread.  If I were to do it again, I would probably put the cubed bread beneath the second layer of crescent rolls so that they don't stick out as much.  The very top layer was cheese.

I made this overnight and left in the fridge.  Then, I baked it the next morning and it was fine!  I didn't have to pre-bake the crescent rolls either.  Will definitely be making this again!

Enjoyed the recipe but will make slight modifications next time as it's a little soggy.  Less egg & milk.  Possibly use tater tots or hash browns.

Well my daughter's 8th grade class loved the casserole and they are picky teenagers.  I followed the recipe according to a teenager's requirements: eggs, cheddar cheese, sausage, bread and a little spice.  However, I used cubed Sourdough and Italian bread combined.  The sourdough was day old, very day old actually.  I did not experience the soggy center as some reviewers did but did cook it for 60 to 70 minutes.  There were NO leftovers.  I did make it the night before.

I made this for Easter Brunch.  I doubled the recipe and cooked it in a large aluminum pan (11x17x4).  I added a bag a hashbrowns and frozen French green beans.  It took a little over 2.5 hours to cook due to the increased volume but I kept cooking it until the center was firm.  I also put aluminum foil over the pan after about an hour so that it wouldn't burn/brown too much.  It was not too soggy or dry, it was just right.  Even my in-laws liked it :D  I got 20 servings out of it.  Great recipe.

Awesome dish, very easy to prepare, I replaced the mushroom with diced potatoes, and didn't add the powder mustard because I didn't have any at the time, but it turned out delicious...Will definitely prepare this dish again!!

Good recipe but it was slightly bland. I would recommend replacing the tomatoes with mild salsa to achieve 5 Stars.

I have made this recipe (the original with 8 eggs) for 15+years. I travel a lot and this is perfect for my husband to reheat a portion each day while I am away. He loves it and tends to eat it for breakfast and dinner!

I love this as a base recipie. I add garlic and a lot of veggies, but it always works well. I add mushrooms, peppers, tomatoes, and spinach. Always turns out great. My roommate will eat the whole 13x9 pan in a day or two!

This is so good! I've made something similar before but that recipe required it to refrigerate  overnight before baking, which produced a very thin casserole.  I think this recipe is much fluffier.  I made it, cut it into individual portions, and froze it.  Now I can take out one at a time...it thaws by the time I get to work and I can reheat there- money saver - no more buying breakfast!

I used 5 slices of bread and 9 eggs. I like less bread, so maybe next time we'll do an entire dozen eggs and 4 slices of bread and add in some hash browns. We like green peppers, so I added those in when I cooked the sausage. I didn't have dry mustard, but it still had good flavor.

Used 4 cups of shredded potatoes (cooked in the skillet with olive oil and salt) instead of bread, and used bacon instead of sausage. We will def make this in the future!

Yummy! Followed the recipe pretty close - added a few extra eggs for extra mouths to feed. Used the mushrooms and some cherry tomatoes, and the Jimmy Dean Sage Sausage. My only problem was that the center wasn't getting done, even after 55 minutes, so I ended up having to microwave it for a few minutes. The center puffed up nicely and solidified, and it tasted delicious, so the microwaving didn't do any harm in the last few minutes.

I made this recipe and brought into work this morning.  The entire pan is gone.  I've been asked to bring it again next week.  I followed the directions and took the advise of other users and swapped the bread for hashbrowns.  I used the ones with onions and peppers to add flavor without the extra work.  I made it up the night before and baked it this morning and it turned out beautifully.  Will definitely be adding to the recipe box.

Tried this recipe this morning! Delish! I had to talk myself out of having thirds!!! I had only hot and spicy breakfast sausage on hand, so decided to make it a spicey version. I added green onion and diced jalapeño to it, and the flavor combo was awesome. Would be amazing with mushrooms but I didn't have any on hand. I think the dried mustard adds some serious flavor to the egg mixture! Don't forget it! I will be making this casserole in the future for sure - I want to try different optional ingredients too: bacon, tomato, potatoes, etc. It makes a good amount, so it would be great for a family get together :)

This was so much fun for me to put together! We do not eat red meats so we seasoned some group turkey and cooked up some turkey bacon, diced some tomatoes, put some fresh spinach and started layering it up! We loved it! Was even good for leftovers!

Really, such a good flavor. But only 4 stars because it seemed to have so much moisture, it was hard to tell if it was cooked through or not. Maybe it was the mushrooms, or grease from sausage and cheese? I had to pour off the moisture when I took it out! But other than that, it was so flavorful. 
P.S. I also substituted potatoes for the bread.

This was a fabulous recipe!! I cut it in half & made it in an 8x8 dish was the only changes I made! This is my second time making this & it was better 2nd time because I prepared it the night before & let it put it in fridge! For some reason I believe it turned out better preparing it & letting it sit! Everyone who ate it enjoyed! Thanks! ??

Got a ho-hum response from the kids but a hearty 5 stars from the hubby!  Will make again.  Used 8 eggs and 2 cups of milk; more might not have fit in my pan.  And we had plenty including leftovers.

Made this for my family tonight and it tasted amazing! I baked mine exactly how the recipe said but I think next time I will use more egg and less milk. The center of the casserole was very gooey so I had to throw it back in the oven for another 15-20min. Aside from that it looked and tasted great! I will definitely be making this again!

Christmas Morning!  Changed a few things...

No Mushrooms for JP, used Half & Half in place of milk, Bottom layer oat-nut bread, top layer sourdough, Added Bacon, Added top layer of cheese with about 10 left to cook.

Everyone loved it and the bread did not get too much like stuffing which happens in some of the breakfast casseroles

I made it the night before and cooked it in the morning.  It was great.  Everyone loved it.  We all thought of some tweeks we could do, as suggested, onion, pepers, salsa, etc. but it was very good as is.  Will make again.

This was really good and easy to throw together.  I used the precooked sausage crumbles, but since I didn't have the required amount, I also added bacon and onion.  I just used the mushrooms and it turned out great!

I made this with thinly sliced mango sausage from Aidell's, sautéed with diced onions, and topped with a spicy seasoning blend. The only bread on hand was Hawaiian bread. I didn't have cheddar so I substituted mozzarella and Parmesan and it tasted fantastic! I loved that this didn't have to sit overnight before baking.

Great recipe to use for overnight guests.  I used hash browns instead of potato and added a bit of bacon to the sausage.  Also added cracked red pepper for a touch of spice.

This is excellent!  The tomatoes really gave it a nice flavor.  I will definitely make it up on Christmas Eve to pop in the oven the next morning while we're opening gifts.

I made this for my husband's office and they loved it!!!  I expanded the recipe for 20 people and it turned out great.  I hand to cook about 20 minutes longer, but tasty!!
