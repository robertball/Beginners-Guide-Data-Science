This recipe is very similar to my mother's for Thanksgiving and Christmas which I have been making for years! Great way to introduce this vegetable to picky eaters, however, we prefer not to have the topping, as it is not necessary for this great dish.

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was a huge hit! A new twist on traditional turnip thatâ€™s sure to please old and young. Will certainly be making again
