I did make some changes based more on what I had available.  I used raspberry yogurt instead of plain and coconut water instead of the oj.  I use a nutri bullet vs a blender so my quantities were 2/3 cup berries and upped to 2/3 cup spinach and probably more like 8 strawberries.  Initially I did the 1/2 cup of the coconut water but I added more later along with protein powder for extra goodness.  Nice recipe for covering the spinach for kiddos.  Nice simple recipe for on the go as well!

Cut it back to 2 servings. Pretty good. Kinda tart. My first fruit smoothie attempt. I’d make this one again.

This is a great healthy recipe... loved by the kids too. You can easily swap out berries for whatever berries you have on hand. 
Your kids won’t taste the spinach. I made it with 1.25 cups of spinach because I love it. I recommend pureeing the spinach first with the OJ. 
 I used Greek yogurt and added vanilla extract and a tough of honey to add a little sweetness. 
Fabulous! Thank you for sharing!

This smoothie came out good. The taste of the orange juice threw my taste buds off though. To make it great next time I will take out the orange juice and add coconut milk instead. Also I added more spinach due to it being my favorite vegetable.

Love it and my young daughter doesn't suspect the spinach being in it.  I did add a banana and a little bit of ice.  Very tasty.

My 9 year old just slurped this one down without even taking the straw out of his mouth!  I added a little more OJ because it was getting stuck in my Vita-mix, but it turned out delicious and a beautiful color too.
