Other than setting the ADT smoke alarm off as I was grilling these in a cast iron grill pan, these hamburgers made for a delicious and delightful dinner! (At least the grill marks looked really cool...)  Hubs was less than enthusiastic about these when he learned there were sun-dried tomatoes in them. I, on the other hand, was excited to try this interesting and mouth-watering combination of ingredients. After setting off the alarm, then hurrying to take a picture of them before they got cold, I had all but lost interest in them and just wanted to get supper over with.  We sat down to eat and our first response was of raised eyebrows, and a "Wow, these are really good!"  Hubs ended up not finishing the soup we had with these just so that he could have a second burger and I was glad I only made three so I couldn't have a second one myself.  What a delicious, unique, kind of unusual, hard to describe but wonderful flavor these had!  And don't think for a minute that these are little mini-meatloaves, what with the breadcrumbs and egg - there isn't enough of either to make that error.  While these just as easily could be served on regular hamburger rolls or ciabatta bread, there was something special about the toasted and buttered English muffins.  A little tomato and lettuce was all that was needed to complete this wonderful burger.  Really pleased with your recipe Chester! As hubs put it, this took the simple burger to the next level!

Excellent burger! I love sun-dried tomatoes and the addition of these inside the burger meat was fabulous! I used Italian-style bread crumbs and choppd the green bell pepper very fine (using about half the amount) as I didn't want to have any unwanted "crunch" in my burger. The addition of the Tabasco gave it a really nice kick! I got four nice sized patties out this and chose to grill these as burgers fried in a pan tend to be "greasy" and don't have the same flavor that comes from being cooked on a grill - personal preference I suppose. I was lucky enough to find the "sandwich-sized" English muffins at my grocery store and toasted them which was a nice change from regular hamburger rolls - maybe it was due to those famous "nooks and crannies". These were excellent topped with Cheddar cheese, lettuce and tomato - YUM!

This recipe was absolutely wonderful! I made the recipe as directed the only thing I added was a little bit of liquid smoke, and grilled them. The flavor was amazing  :) I also bought some buns from the deli instead of english muffins.

These burgers were GREAT!  Used pretzel rolls instead of english muffins, topped w/blue cheese, bacon and spinach.  This is probably our favorite burger.  Thanks for the recipe.

Wonderful! Reminiscent of my "meatloaf burgers" but the addition of the sun dried tomatoes and dash of Tabasco takes it over the top! Thanks, Chester!

We loved these.  I grated the garlic as its easier to me than chopping/mincing.  Everything else I followed just as written.  I had never worked with sun-dried toms so that was new but found I enjoyed them.  Excellent mu husband wants them again soon!  Thank you.

We’ve made these twice now and really enjoyed them.  They are not your typical burger, but yummy just the same.  Both times, we’ve used these to make what we call a “burger salad.”  I followed the recipe for the burgers, but then I marinated them in a little sun-dried tomato vinaigrette before grilling.  We serve them on mixed greens, with green onions and diced tomatoes – all drizzled with a little more vinaigrette.  Saves the calories and carbs you’d get eating it on the English muffin or a bun!  We love this!

Absolutely yummy!  I was looking for a recipe to use up some sun dried tomatoes and I'm glad I gave these a chance!  I will probably use this recipe as my go-to hamburger recipe from now on.  I shaped them into 6 patties, rather than 8, and cooked in a skillet as directed, but from now on we will use the grill because I hate dealing with all the grease.  We served them on regular sesame seed hamburger buns with lettuce, pickle, mayo and mustard.  Can't imagine how they would be on toasted English muffins.... I'm sure it's good, but we'll stick with traditional hamburger buns.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made these burgers last night and they were absolutely delicious. Very flavorful!! The only problem I came across was that the burgers wouldn't stick together. Could the reason be that I omitted the egg ingredient from the recipe or maybe I added to much Worcestershire sauce....I really want to make this recipe again but I don't know where I went wrong and why my burgers fell apart. Any advice??

My daughter said immediately after taking a bite “wow, this is really good.  This is restaurant quality.”  I made the recipe as stated with the exception of omitting the green peppers because we don’t care for them and using French rolls.  I admit I’m not a fan of hamburgers but this recipe may convert me.

These were so good.  I didn't even need ketchup or anything. I made enough to eat the next day and they were better than the day before, even cold.

I made this recipe exactly as instructed and the unique combination of flavors came alive on my taste buds.  The best burger I ever had!  I will definitely be making it again.  Though I will probably just make 4 large ones and making 8 yields a rather small burger.      But awesome recipe!  A hit with my whole household.

These burgers were delicious.  I too used toasted bakery buns. (I didn't have english muffins) The condiment I used was one called Hooleys, a recipe which I found here at allrecipes a few years ago. Search for it and it will become a condiment you will keep in your fridge all grilling season and on. :)

Finally!  After many years living in USA ...a popular and good tasting hamburger where the meat has flavor added.  Canada has had similar tastes for a long time but we were accused of making meatloaf sandwiches, not hamburgers.  Add some liquid smoke to this recipe for a real awesome tast.  Long may you run!

A very flavorful and juicy hamburger. I did not add the Tabasco or the green pepper, since we do not like either. I did add 1 heaping TBSP. of A-1 sauce and grated the onion and put the garlic through a garlic press. I added 1 TBSP of water and indented the center of the burger for added moisture and basting. I think my burgers could have used a bit more salt, but that was my fault since the recipe does not give specific amounts. Very tasty on a grilled bun and the roasted onion mayo from this site. We added dill pickles, cheese, onion, and lettuce. Yum.

My husband, six year old, and I loved these burgers. My two year old was less than thrilled, but he could easily be a vegetarian so his vote doesn't count in this one. The flavors of the sun-dried tomatoes, green pepper, and green onion gives an ordinary hamburger a big flavor boost. A lot of times we will have trouble getting hamburgers to stick together, especially when they have a lot of veggies added in, but these stayed together wonderfully, and were juicy and moist. I don't think I would change a thing about this recipe. Thank you for sharing, Chester!

Thank-you for this delicious recipe.  Very tasty, juicy burger.  I cooked mine in a fry pan and finished off in the broiler with cheese.  Next time, we are going to try making them on the grill.

I grilled these on the bbq and used a regular hamburger bun.  I added chopped jalapenos to half the burgers before cooking for those who like some spice.  I had 9 family members eating that day.  Every one of them said this was the best burger they ever had!  Great recipe!

Very tasty! Good flavor.  I used ground chicken breast, and I love these recipes that call for adding chopped veggies to the meat because A) it provides a little extra nutrition  B) it stretches out the meat so you get more burgers for cheaper and for less saturated fat - win-win!  and C) it keeps the meat nice and moist while it cooks, making it less easy to dry out the meat if you tend to overcook meats like I do. :)  Thanks for the recipe!

I mixed 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 ground turkey and they were so juicy.  I didn't have sun-dried tomatoes so I just sliced fresh tomatoes to top the finished burgers off.

A quick and flavorful burger.  I had a little bit of an issue keeping the burgers together in the skillet, but suspect the cause to be that the sun dried tomatoes I used had been marinated in olive oil. English muffins for buns was a nice change to traditional bun.  This was a family pleaser. Thanks for posting.

I really like this and will make again.  The only thing I would use is a bagette bread instead of an english muffin.

My family loved these. The sun dried tomatoes add a zing. I altered the recipe in that I put the meat mix in  muffin tin. Put 2 meat muffins on each piece of garlic bread. Made mccormick brown gravy mix and topped with gravy.  It was a rave!!  Great meat mix.

We loved these burgers. The whole family devoured them like it was their last supper!! I think next time I’ll flatten them more to be able to stack other fillings better. We had some on Turkish toast the second night and equally yum. We added beetroot, cheese slices, cucumber, tomato, baby spinach, mayo & our fave sauce.

We loved this burger!  I did not have green peppers so I substituted Jalapeños and loved the flavor!  We had our burger wrapped in a huge piece of lettuce trying to avoid carbs with some deli mustard and a pickle. Yum yum yum!
