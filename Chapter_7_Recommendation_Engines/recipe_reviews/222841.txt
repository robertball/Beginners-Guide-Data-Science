I often make strawberry rhubarb pie and wanted to try something new.  Dolloped with cream cheese frosting, sliced strawberries and pecans.   Everyone at the party loved it.  Thank you for sharing Grandma Moyer's recipe!

I thought this would be much tangier than it is. If I make it again, I will replace the strawberries with more rhubarb - and, I will lessen the sugar. Otherwise, a VERY moist cake. A dollop or two of whipped cream helped, by the way.

I was skeptical at first because the recipe didn't call for any butter or oil, but it really didn't need any! After reading other reviews, I added 1 T. of lemon juice to the fruit before folding it into the batter, and that gave it a subtle brightness. Next time I might try substituting pineapple and mandarin oranges for strawberries & rhubarb, perhaps with coconut on top. This is a good basic recipe, thank you for posting it!

Made no changes at all.  It was very moist and the cake was not too sweet.  My only issue was that the rhubarb was not quite as tart as I like it to be.  Could it have been because the rhubarb had been picked 7 days prior?  Made half without strawberries and both sides were just as delicious.  Will definitely make again.

Thank you Grandma Moyer!!! This is the best coffee cake our family has ever eaten! Due to the moisture content of the strawberries, I roasted them on a cookie sheet in the oven at 350 degrees for 20-25 minutes. This removes some of the excess water making the coffee cake not as "soggy" in the middle. Absolutely a delish dessert! I've already made 3 cakes!!!

This was a little gooey-er than I was expecting, but still delicious. I only had 2 cups of rhubarb left in my garden, so I added a cup of chopped apples. I'm sure cherries or peaches would also have worked, but I liked the apples because they were right in between the rhubarb and the strawberries on the tart-to-sweet spectrum. I also mixed the fruit with lemon juice before folding it into the batter, as another reviewer suggested, and it worked quite well.

I made one big change.  I used plums as ours are very bitter like rhubarb.  It came out perfect.  It is really a cake rather than a coffee cake

I didn't realize that there was no added fat in this cake until I had already started making it.  It was pretty good for fat-free, which is why I'm giving it 3 stars (if you're looking for very low fat and/or dairy free), but compared to most coffee cakes, I'd give it 1 star.

I used frozen rhubarb, fresh strawberries and cut the white sugar by about 1/4 cup.  I also used half whole wheat flower, which gave it a nice depth of flavor and heavier density. Baking time was about 10 extra minutes. This recipe is great because it's not too sweet and the rhubarb really shines.

It was great! 
My husband promised me there were strawberries in the refrigerator but when I went to make this, there were none. So I substituted with peaches. To make skinning the peaches easier, I boil a pot of water, throw them in for 30seconds - 1 minute. Remove them and put them in a container of ice water. Skin falls off. I did bake the peaches for 10 minutes on 350 to "dry" them out a little but I don't know if this is necessary. 
I used about 2 peaches and a heaping of rhubarb. I thought I had way too much fruit. The final cake was really moist and delicious but I could barely taste the rhubarb. The peaches were great in it. Don't be shy with putting a lot of fruit in!

All the best

Very good!  I skipped the berries,  and used whipped cream on top.   I forgot the brown sugar and pecans,  but it's still fabulous!  A hit at home
