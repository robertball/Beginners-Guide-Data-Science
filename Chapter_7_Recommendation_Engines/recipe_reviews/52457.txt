This was excellent! It was incredibly easy to make and it was tasty. I would suggest lessening the lemon juice just a tad as it was quite tangy (although I liked that!) and stirring as it freezes as some of the juices sunk to the bottom.

I was trying to find a quick and easy dessert to serve after a heavy meal and this fit the bill perfectly. It's super easy and quick to make and when you're done you have a wonderful tangy sherbet.

Wonderful recipe and so easy to make! I didn't have orange juice, so I used the lemon juice and the rest all pineapple. This made a juicy, tangy pineapple sherbet. I've also made it with heavy cream instead of milk and it comes out richer and creamier. The recipe actually makes about six servings and the amount was perfect for my 1 1/2 quart ice cream maker.

I cannot say enough good things about this recipe! I used fresh squeezed juices straight from the juicer, 1% milk and reduced the sugar to 1 cup to try to make it a little more healthy and it was absolutely delicious!! I will be trying new combinations of juices in the future, but this was awesome as is. Thanks so much for sharing!

REFRESHING!  A cool refreshing treat for a hot summer day.  My only changes were to use 2% milk and freeze in my ice cream maker.  The flavor has a nice balance between sweet and tart, and the texture was smooth and slightly creamy.  This is a recipe I would be proud to serve to company!  Thank you Mary Ann Benzon for sharing such a REFRESHING treat!!

This satisfied a craving for something cold & tart. Extremely easy to make. This reminded me of the 1950's in Florida when a pop-up frozen desert - Lily Dily- was sold at grade school for a nickel. From a timing perspective, a little tricky getting the frozen consistency just right {2 hrs. in freezer, a liquid mush; 3-1/4 hrs. about right around the edges; next morning, rock hard}. Next time, I might add 2-3 tablespoons of alcohol like vodka (neutral w/o modifying flavor) or cointreau (orange liqueur, flavored with the peel of sour and sweet oranges from Curacao and Spain) since alcohol doesn't freeze. Thank you Mary Ann for sharing this oldie, but goodie!

Easy and refreshing – what could be better on a hot summer’s day?  I loved the tartness of the lemon and the sweetness of the pineapple. I used my 1 1/2 quart  ice cream maker which gave the sherbet a wonderfully smooth texture.   I may try it the next time without the pineapple juice just to see if I could get more of a lemon sherbet.  It will be a fun recipe to play with.

I just found this recipe on here yesterday and I am making already today for a cookout this weekend!  It is still "whirring" away in my ice cream maker and I can't keep the spoon out of it--it is THAT good!  I made it exactly as the recipe shows and it is a little tangy but so refreshingly good.  This is a definite keeper and I am sure I will be making this a lot from now on.  God bless that woman from the 30s who came up with this and had to keep a frugal kitchen like today's woman too!

Excellent as written, easily modified.  I used a combo of fat free half and half and skim milk.  Use whatever juice combinations you prefer that end up at 2 1/2 cups.  Also, reduced the sugar to 1 cup.  Mix everything up, store in fridge for an hour or two then used my electric ice cream maker.  A splash of vodka kept it from freezing hard.  Very light and refreshing.  Scoop it into hollowed out oranges, peaches, etc then freeze and it's presentable for company.

Yummy! I was so anxious to make this last night even though I didn't have the orange or pineapple juices & it still was great. I had some over ripe peaches & juiced them making a 1/2 cup & added the lemon juice. I only used 1 cup of sugar. It is very tangy & refreshing. I'm looking forward to trying different juice combinations.

WOW...
Best sherbet I've every had. My friends were impressed with it too.

SO SO easy to make and all ingredients are already in the fridge or cheap to buy.

Great base for modifying the flavour also.  You can use the flavours in your drinking/juice boxes that you buy.

The only thing I did different was add crushed ice to the mixture before putting it the freezer.  Looked just like ice cream when it was done.

I followed the recipe as written and found that while it tasted sweet and good, it took more than 4 hours to set. I checked it at the 4 hour mark and found it seperated and not set, mushy. So I mixed it again and put it back in the freezer to set overnight. The next day it was set and I was able to serve it. I believe it would be great for use in one of those sherbet punches with ginger ale.

I made it as written and it was very refreshing and delicious.  My husband asked me to make it taste more "orangey" so I used the juice of 4 oranges , one lemon and 3 limes.  Loved it.  I used my ice cream maker too.  Worked great.  Thanks for sharing the recipe Mary Ann!

Very good recipe, I followed it exactly except I used my Kitchen Aid ice cream maker.

The only thing I would change is that I will use just one cup of sugar the next time to let the fruit flavors shine a bit more.

I needed an easy dessert to serve today.  I did not have lemon juice, so used equal parts of orange and pineapple juice.  Also reduced the sugar as some reviewers suggested.  This was perfect after 6 hours in the freezer; I did stir it about every two hours.  There were no leftovers.  I think this would be very good to add in a punch of some sort instead of ice cubes.  Thanks for sharing.

Excellent flavor and so easy to make.  I like the tartness, unlike some of the other reviewers.  The tartness balances the sweetness well.

It was extremely easy to make and delicious! I made it as it's written. I would suggest to only do 2/3 of the lemon juice instead of 1 cup because it was really tart! A lot of the comments were saying that it only took two hours for it to freeze to the right time, but I left mine four hours and it still wasn't done, so I waited overnight, and the next morning it was perfect! This was a deliciously yummy snack.

Lovely and light.  I thought the lemon might be too much so I decreased it by have and increased both the other 2 juices b y 1/4 C.  Used my Ice cream maker and It was very good.  I think im going to try making It cream, I think It would be even better!!

Easy and delicious.  I didn't have quite enough sugar so I didn't use as much lemon juice.  This recipe is tweakable to personal tastes so I will keep it in my dessert collection.  Thank you.

The 1c of lemon juice was a little too much lemon for me.  I couldn't taste the orange or pineapple.  Otherwise it was really good.  I also decreased the sugar.

Made recipe as written except for adding some zest from the limes and lemons. My dad was in love with it.  It is a very light and refreshing summer dessert.

Great recipe, very easy and full of flavor! I gave it four stars only because It was a bit too flavorful for me, the lemon juice gave it a bite. froze very well, though!
