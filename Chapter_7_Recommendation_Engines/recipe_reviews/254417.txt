Spaghetti squash can be very difficult to cut in half so I poked it with a few pricks of a fork and microwaved it for five minutes and then just let it sit for about 10 to 15 minutes and it was super easy to cut in half afterwards. This recipe is super easy and you can add other ingredients as you like! I substituted lean ground turkey for beef, added some chopped mushrooms, and for variety red, purple, and green diced bell peppers! Yummy and very filling! Thx for this easy delicious healthy meal!

Very good! Loved it.  Made a few changes.  Used more onion, bell pepper and garlic.  Added one container baby bella mushrooms.  Sauteed onions & garlic then added shrooms and bell pepper w/a tiny bit of balsamic vinegar.  Removed from pan then browned beef.  Used more basil, oregano and added some italian seasoning.  Added a bit of red pepper flakes and cayenne.  Didn't use the squash shells.  Cooked in cast iron deep skillet, so put that in the oven - saved using a casserole dish. Used 2% milk mozerella instead of cheddar.

To tell the truth, I was hesitant to try this because I had memories of boiled, mushy squash from childhood. My wife convinced me to try spaghetti squash... love won out and I made the dish as portrayed. Very pleased to report, it turned out great! The squash was NOT mushy and the whole dish was very flavorful... this dish will definitely be on our menu again!

I just harvested 30 spaghetti squash out of my garden before the 1st freeze.  I managed to give away 8 of them, but now I need to try new recipes.  This was very good, but I added chili powder, and cayenne pepper.  Hint:  When cutting spaghetti or any other winter squash, get a heavy chef's knife started, then use a rubber mallet to hammer the knife through the tough squash.

Fantastic! This comes together so easily and effortlessly. The instructions are easy to follow and fool-proof. I added some zucchini and carrots to the meat mixture and used Parmigiano Reggiano because I was out of cheddar. I also added some hot chili powder, and still loved it. Thank you for sharing the recipe with us.

I am not vegetarian but I made this meatless and it  came out absolutely fantastic! I added more onion and more peppers actually almost a little more of everything to take up the space of the missing meat. To me the beautiful flavor of of a spaghetti squash is overwhelmed when you use meat in it.

This was a hit at our house! I tried the recipe exactly as written although I opted to use a casserole dish instead of the squash shells. Next time I will try doubling the garlic, peppers & onions and add chopped mushrooms as suggested by other reviews. Thanks for this fresh, healthy & easy to make dish.

This is a PERFECT recipe! It isn’t too heavy, and the combination is absolutely delectable. Mixing in the scooped out squash is key. Squash absolutely makes this dish. The ground beef only compliments it, with the seasonings. This is not just healthy, but hearty! It is a great full meal in itself. I make this constantly in my dinner rotation! Probably one of my favorites. If you need a little kick- add some diced jalapeño. If you want a more rich dish: add in some sour cream or cream cheese prior to baking. This one is so easily versatile, but seriously doesn’t need editing!

I like spaghetti squash but usually just serve it with salt, pepper and butter. This was very good. The only change I made was to add some leftover portabello mushrooms that needed to be used up. This is definitely going in the make again file.

This is a very tasty recipe. I'd drain the tomatoes before adding them next time.  Maybe add red pepper flakes to the seasonings.

This was such a great recipe as written!  Like some other reviewers, I added a little more onion and garlic.  I also added some chopped mushrooms just because I love them.  Then before putting it back in the oven, I added about 1 1/2 cups of marinara sauce just to make it more saucy as my husbands request.  This is such a healthy, solid recipe for the fall!  Thanks so much for sharing! ;)

Very bland. I think it needed twice the spices and perhaps some tomato paste.

I used turkey sausage and Parmesan cheese.  I also cut the onion and bell pepper into bigger chunks other than that, I followed directions .  I love spaghetti squash and this was a fun way to cook it.  The presentation was also great!  I'll be making it again!

I was looking for a spaghetti squash recipe that didn't use spaghetti sauce, but would still be a main course dinner and this fit the bill perfectly!  I used spicy sausage in place of ground beef, and added 1 shredded carrot.  I will try the recipe again, using regular ground beef.  The spaghetti squash flavor was lost, and I'm thinking it was because of the spicy sausage.  I cooked my spaghetti squash in the microwave in the morning, and this made prep time at dinner time much quicker.

First time I  made spaghetti squash! This was better and easier than I expected. I did put my squash in microwave for a few mins before baking just for ease of cutting it. Used a mixture of chedder and mozz cheese.

Thought it was a little bland. Used elk meat and added extra garlic and onion but it still needs something more. Will make again but with more seasonings.

I made this and it turned out great! I did substitute ground elk meat instead of beef, because that is what we had. Very lean and yummy! (We live in the mountains.) Usually we just have the spaghetti squash by itself for dinner, so this was a nice change. And using the shell for the dish saved cleaning up after!

I doubled the garlic, onion, bell pepper which I sauteed separately/first, and for herbs I used 1t Italian seasonings and 1t dried basil. Used a casserole dish instead of the shells. Really good, even without cheese!

This might not be as aesthetically pleasing, but instead of putting the whole enchilada back into the shells, I put the enchilada in a baking pan.  Awesome!

I thought 1 squash wasn't going to be enough for two, but I was wrong! This had a terrific flavor, but I'd suggest adding more tomatoes or a tomato sauce rather than one can of stewed tomatoes. I wasn't a fan of cheddar cheese because it had such an Italian flavor, but I think parmesan, romano, or asiago would be delicious. We will make this again.

I used spaghetti sauce instead of tomatoes because hubby doesn’t like chunks of tomatoes.  I think it came out great, hubby liked it & I will make it again.

I'm eating this right now & it's delish!  I had made my own spaghetti sauce with meatballs & sausage so I mixed the squash in, covered it with swiss cheese and voila.

I only gave it 4 stars because it's pretty time consuming.

I put the squash in the bottom of a casserole dish and put ground beef mixture on top and then spread cheese  on the very top to make it more like spaghetti.  Over all a very easy recipe and very delicious.

Of, course as any good cook would do. I tweaked it with my own rendition of tomato sauce. Filled the shells with the squash mixture, added mozzarella. This was so much better than pasta.   Magnifico!!!

Amazing recipe. I use Yves Veggie Ground Round instead of beef because I’m a vegetarian and it turns out amazing. Serving in the shell with bubbling cheese on top always excites anyone I cook this for and they love it!

I doubled it. I didn't have spaghetti squash on hand, but did have 4 cups of frozen shredded zucchini from my garden last year. I put that (semi-thawed) in a large glass dish 11x15 & cooked it for 20 min. on 375. The rest I did the same, but added twice as much garlic (we love garlic) & 2 tsp. salt. I then added the zucchini to the meat mixture, cooked it down a bit & put everything back in the 11x15 pan & topped it with mexican mix cheese. It was a hit and was cleaned up by our family of 6!

It was very good when I tasted the filling, but I like a bit more zip, so added a few shakes of hot sauce and a tiny dash of cayenne as it was cooking.   This will definitely be a regular menu item in my home!

Yes, I made changes. I used Italian sausage in lieu of ground beef (only 1/2 lb) and mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar. 

It would have been helpful if the author had specified a weight on the squash since sizes can vary. Mine was about 2.5 lbs, which is why  I only used a 1/2 lb. of sausage (I was concerned that everything wouldn't fit back into the shells). 

Like many others, I pierced the squash and microwaved it in order to make cutting it easier. I also brushed it with olive oil, salt & pepper and roasted it face down on a foil-lined pan. I browned the sausage separately from the peppers and onions, but added it back in once I added the tomatoes and spices. Overall I thought this was very good and that it can function as main dish.  I like that is is also fairly low carb. I would definitely make this recipe again, but would make sure  the squash is at least 3 lbs.

Fantastic! I used all the ingredients but microwaved the squash, prepared the meat sauce and ladled it on to the shredded squash topped with the cheddar cheese, spaghetti-style. We thoroughly enjoyed! Thank you!

Thanks for this simple, healthy, delicious recipe! Another option for cooking the squash is: cut it in half, scoop out the loose strands, sprinkle a little salt and pepper inside, and spread a thin layer of cooking oil on a baking sheet where the squash will touch. Cook the halves cut-side down at 400° for 30 minutes. This will give your squash a lovely roasted flavor.

I added tomatoe sauce but next time I will double the spices and add tomatoe paste instead.  It was a hit and cute presentation in the shell. I also toasted the seeds for 15 min. At 350 with a bit of olive oil and Himalayan salt.

Loved it. We live in CA so I had to add a little “Southwestern flair” in the form of a couple of shakes of chili pepper flakes and by substituting fire roasted tomatoes for regular canned tomatoes. Also, used bison as the meat. Excellent!!

The only change I made to the recipe was to substitute an Anaheim pepper for the bell pepper, which we do not like. This was a quick, easy, tasty recipe. I'm only giving it 4 stars because we thought it was a little bland. I will make this again & add more spices to up the flavor. Thank you for the recipe.

Loved the fact that you can incorporate veggies into meat mixture for a super flavorful meal. I only had hot bulk sausage on hand, so I used it and cut out all the other spices. Only had provolone cheese so I used instead of cheddar. I followed rest of cooking/baking instructions and it came out tasty! Gonna make this again!

This is so good! I only had 1/4 pound ground turkey, Anaheim peppers, zucchini and fresh tomatoes. I also added chili pepper, cayenne pepper and a little cumin. Other than that followed the recipe. Next time I make this(there will definitely be a next time) I’ll mix some parmesan cheese into the mixture also and top with mozzarella. Probably would be better with mushrooms instead of zucchini, bell pepper and no chili pepper or cumin. Pretty easy and delicious, we’ve been trying to have more veggie dinners and this was perfect. My boyfriend loved it too(usually is a little picky with veggies) said to add it to our saved recipes, really versatile too which is nice!

This has become a staple meal at our house! Sometimes we make double to freeze and have the second part on a busy night. The second time around it is mushy, but the flavor is still incredible. One child adamantly hates squash, but she loves this dish (even on leftover night!). We especially love it with ground sausage, although other meats are good too. To make it go faster, we’ve occasionally cheated with bottled spaghetti sauce. This recipe is worth your time!

I LOVE this dish. It's very flavorful, filling, and healthy. I use ground turkey instead of ground beef to reduce the amount of calories. I've made these in the spaghetti squash shell, and also in a baking dish as a casserole. I prefer to make it as a casserole, that way I can toss out the rinds and not have to worry about them breaking.

The spaghetti squash was really hard to cut open and I should probably have let cook a little longer, but was basically a really good recipe.  Will definitely make again with a few changes.

Did this up with spicy sausage and mushrooms.. Also did ground turkey and both were really good and fun.  I did not try with hamburger because I don't like it . Oh and drain the sausage before adding everything else. I did micro the squash for 4 min so cutting was a lot easier so thanks for that tip !!

This recipe was easy and very good. I added some mushrooms and yellow, orange, green, and red bell peppers. It was so filling and was a great idea to trick my son into eating more vegetables.

My husband is a meat and potatoes guy. He will eat vegetables if mandatory. I made this meal, and knowing him as I do, I scraped all of the squash from the shells and discarded them. I mixed the spaghetti sauce thoroughly with the squash and baked in a 91/2 by 13" pan for 15minutes, added the cheese topping (I used mozzarella) and back in for another 5 minutes. Huge hit. Thank you JBaudreau!

I prepared the squash the night before.  I did not have a bell pepper, but I had a sweet yellow pepper, so I used that instead.  Since the squash was prepared the night before, I just baked it in a casserole dish. All my kids enjoyed this meal. Next time serve with crescent rolls.

I thought recipe was pretty good overall.  I used Italian sausage instead of beef.  My only issue was the squash I bought wasn’t ripe enough and the shells were a bit soggy after cooking.  I think next time I’d roast the squash with some olive oil and salt and pepper.

This is the fifth time making this dish and it never disappoints. I use two pounds of ground beef/pork mix, added carrots, celery and extra spices. Any leftover I put in a casserole dish and bake with the shells. AMAZING!

I cut the spaghetti squash widthwise in 1 inch sections. The squash cooks faster this way. Since I did not have the shell to put the mixture in, I  put the mixture into a baking dish for the final baking. My dad was very skeptical of it, but he really liked it!

Very easy to make and tasty too. I cut back on the tomatoes so it was more meat instead of spaghetti sauce style. I had extra filling left over after mixing everything together. I will definitely make this again.

I can't give this a five star rating as I made some changes.  First, I cooked the squash in the microwave - saves time and is quicker.  I used ground chicken instead of beef, used homemade stewed tomatoes (undrained), about two tablespoons of tomato paste (had about a half cans worth leftover from a previous recipe), used a little extra garlic, put everything into a casserole dish instead of the shell as they split.  Otherwise, we really enjoyed this dish and enjoyed it as leftovers as well.  Thanks.

This  is not difficult to make but does take time for the different steps. It is well worth it though. I did not make any changes to the recipe.  Delicious !!

I've made this a couple of times now and I absolutely love it! It is really easy to make even though it takes a bit of time for the squash to cook but it's sooo worth it! And it looks amazing in the shells!

I was looking for a new way to use spaghetti squash and I really liked this. I did add zucchini and mushrooms because I had them to use up and another can of tomatoes, because I love tomatoes.  This created a better balance of meat to veg. I did put the mixture back into the shell, but just for my husband and I, I would just put it in a casserole dish. Will make again and again.

Was great!  I tried making it ahead of time and cooking at the end, but I think the filling was too cold to cook well. Next time I'll bake it right out of the frying pan stage to ensure it's nice and hot.  Loved the recipe though!!

Since I made some changes i can only rate the recipe i made. I used a package of taco seasoning in place of the spices and put cheese on top. Served over lettuce and tomatoes with salsa and sour cream.  Great Mexican spaghetti squash.

I loved the recipe without any changes. I baked the squash the night before, so made for a quick meal when I made the sauce. This is a great base recipe that can be customized easily. Definitely will be keeping this in my meal plan favs.

We really like this recipe.  I made it using lean ground turkey and poblano pepper.  Next time I will make the same substitutions, and will also kick up the spices and add half a jar of pasta sauce.  It was a bit dry as is.

This was really good!  Used as a light main entree and served with salad. I didn’t have onions so I doubled up on the green peppers and added olives. Also used Parmesan cheese, which lightened it up a bit. Served to a friend staying with me and we are both very happy!  Will make again.

I followed this recipe exactly and was very disappointed. It was not very flavorful and not worth the time, effort and ingredients.  Maybe my expectations were too high after reading the glowing reviews. I checked and double checked to make sure I had followed directions. And I was so excited to try a spaghetti squash recipe

I used ground turkey and it was delicious. Preparation took longer than normal but it was nourishing and filling, so will likely make it again. I would have used cheddar cheese to top it but my boyfriend hates cheese (crazy, right?).

My family LOVED this dish. I didn't cook the squash as instructed in this recipe though. I cut it in half lengthwise, scraped out the seeds, oiled the cut side with olive oil and placed it cut side down on a lined (foil or parchment) baking sheet. I also didn't measure my pepper, onion or garlic. I just chopped a whole pepper, a large onion and 3 or 4 cloves of garlic.  I will make this again.

This is a winner.  Adjustments I made, I used 2 squash and baked/roasted  in oven face down on cookie sheet about 50 minutes. I used 2 onions, 1 jalopeno pepper diced (I sauteed this with the onion), increased  garlic (I used jarred garlic) 4 tblsp, increased tomatoes to 2 cans of fireroasted diced tomatoes, ground turkey instead of beef and 1 cup cooked lentils. Sprinkled with the cheddar cheese however I served grated parmesan at the table.  EVERY ONE LOVED IT!!

The squash was amazing!  I served it with a salad and called it a complete dinner.  My husband and I split one and will have the other later this week.  I doubled the batch of hamburger, etc... and will use that to make meat sauce for dinner tonight :-)

Delicious. My husband likes more seasoning in it, but I feel that you can always add that, if you like more. I did add more garlic than called for, since we LOVE garlic.

If you have a hard time cutting the spaghetti squash, another way is to poke holes in it, all around, and boil for 45 minutes and let cool in the water .

That is one of many ways that I do it.

This was very good; I added some additional pasta sauce as it was somewhat dry with just the tomatoes.  Very healthy way to have a spaghetti dinner!  Will make again.

I love spaghetti squash and this was very good. I’m diabetic and this fits perfectly into my low-carb diet it’s one of those meals that you would eat just because it’s so darn good are use Parmesan cheese and mine and assortment of sweet and mild peppers along with all the other ingredients a big thumbs up

I felt like this needed a little more broth to soak down into the squash.  Next time I will pour a little beef broth into the squash before adding the meat.  I can't eat tomatoes, so I left those out.  I added 1/4 lb. Sausage to make it a little more savory.

Very good!  The only change I would make is to add more salt - it seemed a little bland without it, but I will definitely make it again!

My whole family loved this, even my picky eater! I sauteed the onion, red pepper and garlic in some bacon fat and set aside, then cooked the ground beef in the same pan, drained and added back in the onion and pepper. I also roasted the squash on a pan with some butter (no water needed). Once cooled I put the cooked squash in a kitchen towel and wrung out excess water. I also added some corn, but you could really add any vegetable you wanted - whole or chopped fine to hide from picky eaters! Just cooked it in a casserole dish and the whole thing was devoured by a family of four! Yummy!

Never had spaghetti squash before. Was afraid it would be tasteless. But in this recipe it was very yummy. The whole dish was very yummy. Only change I made was to use more garlic.  Will definitely be making this again!  I also used another reviewer's suggestion to microwave it first. Make cutting easy.

This is easily upped to a 5 star recipe with more seasoning and cheese.  I also tried to under cook the squash and then add filling without scooping.  This allowed juices to seep down into the squash and the biggie...it's a nice presentation and less to clean up.

Wow been missing such a great food and fantastic recipe that was incredibly easy to make.  I've had other squashes but never a spaghetti one.  Made with ground pork this round and will definitely make again.  I also used a Glengarry cave Aged Clothbound Cheddar, most excellent

I used stew meat that I sliced thin before browning it.  Could be put into a casserole dish then baked.  Also think I'll add mushrooms next time.

I was a little leery of trying this recipe with about spaghetti sauce! It was amazing as always! Was my first time making, very pleased with the turnout. I can’t say I measured everything out except for the can Of tomatoes and used a medium size squash. Thank you for the recipe!

I will definitely be making this again.  Made two small changes that I think were beneficial.  I added clove of garlic and some black pepper to beef while cooking and also added approx. 1/3 cup of chives and 1/4 cup of goat cheese crumbles with the cheddar cheese topping.

Made this according to the directions except I didn't have any bell peppers.  My son thought it was two huge baked potato's, which it kind of does look like that after the melted cheese.  It was so delicious I will certainly make again.  Have a good crop of spaghetti squash in the garden this year.

Excellent recipe- I used Rotel instead of regular tomatoes and I think this could be pretty great with chorizo next time too.  It did need additional salt.

I baked this all together in a 13×9 inch casserole dish instead of the spaghetti squash shells (same temperature and time), and used grated parmesan and sliced garlic and herb provolone for the topping. All the housemates loved it!

This dish is awesome. I only gave it 4 stars because I added a lot more onions and peppers than the recipe called for and I also added mushrooms and garlic salt. My husband and I both loved it!

Bought a Spaghetti Squash and found this recipe and hoped it would be special but it was just okay.   Followed the recipe as written  and it needed "something",  maybe more spices,  more garlic, more cheese or maybe some Worchestershire sauce to give it a kick.   It is a shame my hubby and I find "healthy" recipes boring.

This was VERY GOOD! i used ground turkey instead of ground beef. my squash was very small, so i only used half of the meat mixture. the rest is in the freezer for next time, cuz there definitely will be a next time!

Used this as a base recipe but made several modifications for personal preference .  Roasted the spaghetti squash halted with olive oil, salt, pepper.  I used one package of Italian sausage meat, red pepper (because of preference), about 2 tablespoons of tomato paste, and Deluccas pizza spice.   Once squash was done, I put it in a baking dish with the meat sauce  and mozzarella cheese on top and baked it for an additional 15 minutes.  Loved it.  Also baked it in the shell another time with sauce on top.

This is such a fun dish, that presents well. Overall very tasty . I did have to up the flavors though.. I like a lot of flavor. Doubled all spices and garlic. My can of tomatoes also included Italian seasonings. I browned the beef first then drained the fat and set aside. Did a quick sauté on the vegetables (I added mushrooms) then returned beef back to skillet. Topped mine with a low fat mozzarella cheese. I ate this as a main dish with a side of sautéed Zucchini. Will definitely make this again, next time using ground turkey. Tons of variations are possible.. Love it!

Absolutely delicious! I was looking for a recipe to use some smoked meat and my spaghetti squash. So we used some leftover pulled pork instead of ground beef. I added about a cup of chopped carrots while sautéing the onions/pepper and used fresh basil. The entire family loved it! Will add to the rotation!! Thanks!

I used Feta and Goat Cheese along with some cheddar. It gives it a nice richness I loved.

It was ok. I was not a fan of squash to begin with but this recipe did make it better for me. I made it exactly as the recipe describes. However, I layered the cheese bottom, middle, and top to get the cheesiness all the way through. I am not sure what anyone else's idea of quick is but this recipe is definitely not quick. Easy yeah just a lot of waiting involved.
