Yummy soup.. I had roasted peppers so I used those, left out the canned soup and pureed most of it with my immersion blender

I have a garden and in early sept. I have a ton of zucchini and omg tomatoes. So I was happy to see it took 8 cups of these two I items. The only thing I did different was I added garlic which I love.

Wow this has too much black pepper!  Even my husband who dumps black pepper on everything thought it was too much.  I halved the recipe but used the whole can of tomato soup.  The soup was good except for the pepper issue.  I quartered the zucchini slices because I thought whole slices would be awkward to eat.  At first I thought the extra sugar was unnecessary but added some after tasting it initially.  I also added some dried basil just for my own preference.  I'm not a real fan of vegetable soup but trying to eat healthy and I will make this again.  Thanks!
