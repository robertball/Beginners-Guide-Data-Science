This recipe sounded so interesting and unique for a Cinco de Mayo party. I tested it before the party. I added the 2 tsp (T?) of baking powder and it did raise it up a lot. I made it in a skillet pan, so it looked very festive. However, it's not as sweet as I thought it was going to be, so I didn't use it for a dessert at the party. I suppose I could have drizzled a Mexican chocolate sauce over it or some sweetened condensed milk. It certainly would have been a unique addition to the party, but it heavy and dense. Maybe better for a winter party? I actually would probably make this again; however, I went with a lime-avocado cheesecake instead. It felt more festive for the occasion.
