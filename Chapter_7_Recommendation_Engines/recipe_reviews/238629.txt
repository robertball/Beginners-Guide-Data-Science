I thought this was tasty. This was my first time trying Stevia and it does have a bit of a different taste that wasnt my favorite .. Next time I make this I will try it with agave as a suggested alternative. The protein powder taste for me was good, but if you dont like the texture or taste of protein powder , you may not like this.  It isnt the same texture as a traditional chocolate pudding so dont expect that

I liked it, but I had to use sugar instead of the stevia, because I can't handle the taste. The flavor of the hazelnuts was nice.
