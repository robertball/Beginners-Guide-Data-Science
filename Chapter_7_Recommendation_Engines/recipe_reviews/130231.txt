Easy to make, satisfying.  I served this on egg noodles with good family reviews.  When I make it again, (and I will make it again!) I would use 1 1/2 tablespons chili powder instead of 2, decrease the amount of milk to 1/2 cup.

This was excellent! I have never made stroanoff and didn't realize I should put this over noodles or rice or something - so we just ate it as it was...it was fantastic.  Mine turned out soupy but I think I didn't let it simmer long enough to thicken.  Otherwise, very very tasty.  I loved it!

This is a hit at our house! We tweet the recipe a little by adding saut√©ed mushrooms, use seasoned ground beef, linguine noodles, and replace the american with cheddar cheese. The result is always amazing!

Very good! Except I reduced the amount of garlic in it, added an extra tbsp of flour and 1/4 cup more milk. Big hit in my house!

This was different but not horrible. I think I will use this and try to tweak it to better fit my households taste buds... But all in all it was satisfying

Pretty much followed the recipe except for skipping the milk.  Even without it, I thickened with an additional 2T flour.  For the record, 8 ounces egg noodles (uncooked) is too much for 4 servings (which this recipe is for as well).  This was home-y, comfort food tasting; somewhat velveeta-ish even with real cheese (blaming the canned soup).  It's an inexpensive & pretty easy dish to make, but I don't think I'll make it again.  More notes: Cook the pork with the onions till almost done, then add the garlic.  No need to take 20 minutes for that part.  The boiling & reboiling isn't necessasary either - just boil after adding the flour so it cooks.  The taco seasoning flavor doesn't come through well until leftovers so probably need to simmer this 15 minutes before adding the cheese.

This was really good and easy to make.  I made a few alterations based on what I had on-hand.  I only used half of the taco seasoning since I was essentially out and used 1 can condensed beef consume with the remainder of 2 cups made up of water instead of beef broth.  I omitted the milk since I wanted the sauce to stay nice and thick.  Very flavorful.  Even my kids liked it!

This was very good and easy to make. I served over store bought egg noodles and was just what we were looking for.
