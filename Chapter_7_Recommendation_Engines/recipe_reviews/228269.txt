This sounded interesting so gave it a try. It really is a wonderful surprise of flavors! Go easy on the cilantro or you'll lose/over power the subtle flavor of the olive oil. I found a bit of fresh ground pepper to really bring out the flavors and preferred it over the cilantro. Yet, to each their own. Thanks Bis4Bethany for sharing!

I added a little basil, and only 1/2 onion, but it turned out beautifully.  Very lite and refreshing summer salad

This  salsa is addictive!  I used frozen corn right from the package and red onion because that was what I had in the larder.  I added cilantro because the fam likes it.  I served most of it with tortilla chips....and ate the rest of it straight out of the bowl.  Don't judge until you make it!

This was very watery. Maybe cut the watermelon smaller? I added garlic to mine.

When I first read this recipe, I thought it was so similar to my corn salsa recipe, there really wasn't much point in making it. But I had some  watermelon to use, so I threw it together while grilling chicken. The melon takes a nice salad and makes it outstanding. The only change I made this time was to add feta before serving. It goes so well with watermelon. We'll definitely be making this one again.

First off the recipe is missing the jalapeño but the video shows it which might cause some confusion. Anyway I made this, and while it was refreshing it was fairly bland. Next time I will include the jalapeño seeds to give it some kick.
