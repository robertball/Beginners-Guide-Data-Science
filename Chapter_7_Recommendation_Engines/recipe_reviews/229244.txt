Nice recipe. A nutritional powerhouse! but...Why would you not massage the kale? Massaged kale salads are everywhere. After cutting into ribbons, add 1tsp. sea salt. Massage for 2 min. It will become silky, shiny and very pliable. It's delicious!

I bought the huge Costco bag of baby kale and was looking for something to do with it.  Just tried this recipe and it is super easy and delicious.  I added the quinoa while it was a little warm and wilted the kale just slightly, really good.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I needed a quick Sunday lunch, and this was perfect! I've never enjoyed kale in a salad because it can be so crunchy, but the quinoa and dressing really helped soften the kale perfectly! I didn't have pecans or currants, so I chopped up some of the orange bell pepper I had left and tossed in some unsalted peanuts. It was still wonderful!! Definitely want to try this more often!

This was a great salad!  Made it for a group of 16, and they all asked for the recipe and gobbled it up.  I did take one reviewers advice and put the quinoa with the kale while it was hot to help wilt the kale a bit, which I liked.  The kale isn't so chewy that way.  I also used raisins instead of currants, but followed the recipe other than that.  Fabulous!  Will make this again!

This was so wonderful and quick! I used bagged organic kale from Trader Joes (one bag was a perfect amount). I made the dressing and then massaged it into the kale for a minute and then added the quinoa while it was warm which further softened the kale. Once cool, the cheese, raisins and nuts went in. I make a different kale salad all the time, but this has just become my favorite. With the addition of quinoa, it is a nutrition powerhouse!

This was a great salad the next day. I cooked the quinoa in chicken stock, left out the mustard and used raisins instead of currants and pine nuts instead of the pecans. Poured the hot quinoa over the kale to wilt some. Same day it was good but not great. That evening I took the leftovers and added about 3 T. red wine vinegar and 1 T. seasoned rice vinegar and tossed good to coat. Had it just now for lunch the day after and it was really, really good. Will definately make again!

Love it! Followed the recipe to the letter. A healthy tasty way to make kale, and a nice refreshing "different" salad to take to an event. From the reviews, I would also echo the need to shred the kale really tiny or its too chewy. I also rubbed the dressing in with my hands after I warmed it up a little to help wilt the kale. If I were to make it for myself and not for a group, I would significantly reduce the quinoa (just adds extra carbs I don't need and it makes it more of a quinoa base not a kale base. I prefer to get my protein from a meat source, not a grain), add more garlic, and skip the currants/raisins as its my preference. However, since I hate it when people rate the recipe and then list all the ways they changed it...I still give it a 5 according to its original instructions!

I really loved this recipe as I've been wanting to cook more with kale and quinoa for better health. :) I happened to have some frozen quinoa, so I just microwaved that, and added the kale to that to help it wilt. I had to make some substitutions with what I had on hand: I used parmesan reggiano, walnuts, and dried cranberries. This will be a go-to recipe for a super-quick, filling, tasty and healthy meal!

This is so funny. I just made Quinoa for the first time and I made it almost identical to this one. I didn't think about the currants but I have some in my freezer so I will throw them in. I used pine nuts instead of pecans. Goat cheeses instead of feta. I love it!

I steamed the kale (trader joes organic in a bag) in 1/4 C of chicken broth for 1 min. and used leftover quinoa. This salad was so good. I Did not have any cheese, probably would not have added it even if I did- ruins the nutritional benefit for my diet, and we did not miss it. Both DH and Teen Son declared it a winner and so the 5 stars. Thanks kicius!

This dish was amazing - sweet, slightly bitter, crunchy and creamy.  Not to mention so good for you.  The quinoa pops in your mouth.  LOVED IT.  Ate it for breakfast the next AM.

We loved this recipe. I have made it a couple of times now. We had to use bulgar wheat because I was out of quinoa. I also added it in warm. It helps with lessening the chewiness of the kale. One time we threw in dried cranberries instead of the currants and no feta  because we were trying to cut a few after Christmas calories. All versions were delicious. The dressing is key to the great flavor.

This was much better than I even expected!  I did modify it, but only a bit.  I did not add nuts because I do not like them.  Also, I didn't add the oil because I was out and it turned out not to need it!  I only added about half the amount of dried cranberries (all I had) and chopped the kale to throw in with everything else. Also added some finely chopped red onion and diced avocado. It was WONDERFUL!  Tasted even better the next day.  I like to keep it in the fridge for lunch and it stays good for about 5-6 days.  Healthy and yummy.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

One of my favourite recipes. Tastes even better the second day. Be sure to add pecans, currents and feta cheese just before eating so they don't get soggy

This is now my default salad, when I have guests coming, or when I am heading to a potluck.  Here's my shortcut version: Kale, quinoa, feta, and bottled Greek salad dressing.

Since I was low on time, I added the quinoa to the kale while still hot.  I actually liked it better slightly wilted rather than totally raw.  I also used roasted pumpkin seeds in place of nuts and a mixture of craisins and dates.  The craisins were better but I was out.  This is an excellent recipe for getting in more dark leafy greens and good protein.

Very good!  Great, light, healthy salad.  The feta is perfect in this dish.  Also love the dressing - I've started using this in other salad recipes also.  Only weird thing is the currants.  Texture compliments the salad, but the flavor of currants are a little weird to me.  Tried subbing with raisins but not quite right either.  I think craisins would overpower it though.  Didnt get a lot out of the pecans.  Could make without them and wouldn't miss much.

This salad is amazing! I followed the recipe to the letter, except I cooked the quinoa in chicken bouillon. I removed the rib from the kale and cut the kale into thin ribbons. I mixed the dressing exactly, then tossed the kale, dressing and quinoa together while the quinoa was still hot, in order to wilt the kale. Amazing!
After it cooled I added dried cranberries and salted sunflower seeds, and feta cheese. This is so good! My daughter, who wanted me to set aside some cooked quinoa for her to make a different dish, took one taste and asked me to add the extra quinoa to more kale (essentially making another salad exactly the same) so we would have it for a few days! Sooo good, and good for you too!

Really really good.  We didn't have lemon juice so we just added a little more olive oil and mustard.  Mixed in the quinoa while it was still a little warm, but waited to put the dressing on until just before we ate it.....the only problem was trying to not eat the whole bowl!

Really nice when the quinoa is added while hot so that the kale wilts a little...this also makes it easier for little teeth (my one-year old gobbled it up!). I would recommend doubling the dressing to serve a little on the side.  Will definitely make this again!

This salad was fantastic! Everyone loved it.  I did use dried pomagranates because I could not find currants but I would not change a thing.

This is a GREAT base recipe.  The dressing is light so for those who want a heavy dressing - perhaps you'll want to spice it up but our family prefers the "touch" of flavor.  Do salt and pepper to taste as I found the salt to be a bit much but taste it by dipping a leaf or two of kale; off the spoon it's VERY salty but with the kale it goes perfectly.  I preferred about 1/2 the amount the salt and 1/4 the amount of pepper as the dijon is already peppery.  The garlic was way too overpowering for me.  1/4 the amount as well, if at all.  I actually preferred it with garlic powder.

My husband gave this one star. I liked it enough to say 3.5 after adding more dressing.  Knowing how healthy it is I will make & eat again.

I had some nice organic kale and went to make this salad when lo and behold! I was out of quinoa! I searched my shelves and decided to make it with Thai purple rice instead and an extra garlic clove- FABULOUS and gorgeous at the same time. I'm sure it's also divine with quinoa - it's a keeper!

This was my first time using Kale.  I have fixed quinoa before but my family didn't like it.  Last night; they loved it!  I bought the Kale from BJ's and it was already cleaned, cut and the spine removed. I wilted the Kale in a steamer basket, cooled it, and then added the dressing and the quinoa.  I didn't let the quinoa cool, which really melted the kale.  I know that the kale was not supposed to be that wilted, but it was delicious.  I used walnuts as I didn't have pecans, and it was great.  Had the leftovers for lunch the next day!

I cut the quinoa down to 1/4 cup dry, and cut the oil down by half and left all the other ingredient's the same.  Also substituted dried cherries for the currants.  I thought it was okay, but did get tired of eating it pretty quick.  Raw kale is so healthy so this is good for that :)

Really, really enjoyed this one.  The flavors are addictive.  Light and yummy.  Even the leftovers were awesome the next day!  I forgot to buy feta and subbed mozzarella because I didn't have anything even close to feta on hand at the last minute.  Also used dried cranberries rather than currants.

Delicious!  Thanks for this wonderful recipe.  I significantly decreased the amount of nuts and raisins and topped with bit of feta cheese.  Tried it before with parmesean and was even better.

Great recipe and easy to substitute with Craisins, etc.  Used a little apple cider vinegar as well in the dressing.  Delicious!

Delicious. I toasted the pecans and broke them into bits so every bite has that sweetness. I used raisins since I didn't have currants. I didn't have time to wait for the quinoa to cool, so just mixed it up warm and still tasted great-probably cut 25 mins off total time for recipe. Pinning this one to make again.

This salad is AMAZING. Before adding the dressing, I massaged the kale with a little olive oil and salt. I was trying to use what I had on hand, so I subbed craisins for the currants, stilton for the feta, and almonds for the pecans. One of the best salads I've ever had!

Cut kale in small pieces, steamed it for 1 min.  Added 2 Tbsp honey to dressing. Next time I will try substituting  1/2 of the lemon juice with Red Wine Vinegar.  Added only enough quinoa to taste, probably not all that was called for. Used Craisins instead of currants.

Slivered almond and dried cranberries instead plus shredded carrot and added honey to the dressing. Yum! Oh, and no feta. I guess I basically made a different recipe.

I used fresh kale from the garden, however, next time I will use more kale than what is listed on this recipe. The salad was more quinoa than kale, and I would prefer it with more kale than quinoa. The salad dressing was not the greatest. I added some white balsamic vinegar and that seemed to make it taste better. I liked the Best Greek Quinoa Salad, Quinoa & Black Bean, and Mediterranean Quinoa Salad recipes on this website better than this one. TIPS: From what I read on the other recipes, it's best to rinse water over the quinoa before cooking. I also set aside the stalks and ribs of the kale for my morning green drink and only use the leafy tender part in salads.

So delish! I used cous cous instead of quinoa bc that's what I had. Also I used baby kale and massaged it to make it easier to eat. Finally, I used parmesan instead of feta because I wanted something less sharp.

Tastes even better the next day! I thought it was a lot of pepper to put in but it gives a nice kick to the salad. I also swapped the pecans for toasted walnuts and half the currants for freshly cut apple pieces. So so so good!

This is very good.  I put some salt in the kale and massage it until silky.  Mixed in the quinoa, and dressed with a balsamic vinaigrette (because that is what I had in the kitchen).  Really flavorful.

Love this recipe just as listed. I did make a few variations: lightly steamed to wilt the kale as I don't prefer it raw; prepared horseradish in place of garlic; 1 stem of Thai basil torn into 1/2" pieces; fresh bean sprouts; sauteed zucchini; no nuts or currants, so more of a warm dish than salad. Still extremely delicious.

Fantastic recipe!! This salad is healthy, delicious and adaptable.  I added half of an avocado and used dried cranberries instead of currants, because it is what I had on hand and the salad looked beautiful and tasted great - even on day 2!  This will definitely become a regular at our house!

I really enjoyed this recipe, but I edited it a little bit. I cut out the pepper, salt, garlic, pecans and currants. Instead of those ingredients I used blueberries, raspberries and strawberries. Then, I substituted the regular Dijon mustard for honey Dijon. Mixed it all up and viola! The perfect, healthy summertime salad!

I gave this 4 stars because I subbed some of the ingredients for what I had on hand. Dried cranberries instead of currants, walnuts instead of pecans and shredded parmesan cause I don't like feta. I did massage the dressing into the kale and added quinoa while it was still warm. Also added a splash of rice wine vinegar. I liked it so much that I ate it every day for 5 days. Even had it for breakfast a couple of times.

What a tasty healthy salad!  It seems the trick with kale is to cut it in thin ribbons, remove the woody white stalk first by just pulling the green leafy part off.  I loved the idea of massaging it with sea salt, it turns it a lovely shiny green colour and softens it.  The odour is a little off putting, a bit like alfalfa or mowed grass ( a nice enough smell...but to eat???).  Anyway after the massage I put the dressing on and let it marinade for a bit then added the quinoa while it was still warm.  I left off the feta as a matter of preference and used pumpkin and sunflower seeds (toasted in a frying pan first) instead of pecans.  I think fresh fruit such as peach, orange or apple could be used instead of currants.  A great recipe that I will use often!!

Mmm, mmm.  This is one of those recipes that sounds like it's good, then surprises you by being awesome.  The mix of flavors and textures is wonderful, and it is very filling so makes a good meal in itself.  I followed reviewers advice and massaged the dressing into the kale, and added the quinoa while it was still warm.  Then let it chill before adding toasted pecans, golden raisins, and feta.  Oh, and I used dragon kale sliced into ribbons.  I think one could easily double the kale and keep the rest of the ingredients the same...there are enough "toppings" to go around.  

I will definitely be making this one again.  Thanks Kicius for a  healthy, delish, new favorite!

What a delicious powerhouse of nutrition salad! Wonderful combination of ingredients and flavors. The Dijon mustard and lemon makes the dressing 'pop' with bright flavor, the saltiness from the Feta, the surprise bite of sweet from a plump moist raisin (I used raisins instead of currants as I find currants to be dry), the nutty tones from the Pecan and Quinoa ... Not a thing needs to be changed. I used baby Kale greens and used my judgment regarding the quantity of individual ingredients used for an individual size salad and fell in love; will be eating it a lot. It's important to use quality Kale as old and bigger leafed Kale can be bitter and tough.

great! Steamed my kale in microwave for 3 min then put everything together. Used currants and raisins that I soaked in hot water then drained.

Wow, yummy!  I read some reviews before I made it, and decided to "massage" the kale, and put it together with warm quinoa. I didn't think I'd like raw kale, so the idea of wilting it somewhat sounded appealing. So I massaged the dressing into the kale, then poured the warm quinoa over it and mixed it up, adding the other ingredients as well. I had dried cherries so that's what I used instead of currants.  It turned out amazing, and I bet the leftovers will be even better after it sits in the fridge a while.

I was really surprised with this salad.  This was my first Kale salad and I really enjoyed it.  I added red wine vinegar and substituted the pecans with walnuts.

My husband hasn't really cared for kale or quinoa, but loved this recipe, as did the rest of the family. Served with halibut and provided a very nice, complimentary flavor. Very good!

Delicious and nutritious! Washed and ready baby kale is now available, making this recipe very easy. I substituted golden raisins for the currants and grated fresh Parmesan cheese for the feta. The lemony dressing and the pecans are perfect.

Wow! Made this for dinner tonight and it is a winner! This was first time I have fixed kale, other than making kale chips. I was rather unsure how it would taste, it smelled really strong when I was tearing it into pieces.  The reviews were so good I had to try. I'm so glad I did.. Only thing I changed was I put in dried tart cherries (didn't have currants).  

This is a keeper and best of all leftovers for our lunches.  YUM!

so good!  i also cooked the quinoa in chicken stock, wilted the kale in the quinoa right after turning off the heat, and used a bell pepper instead of currants (mainly because i can never remember to buy currants but always seem to have a lonely bell pepper in the veggie drawer). 
it's yummy and i feel so healthy eating it!

No Flavor. Followed recipe to the letter.  Recipes should be able to stand on their own.  Couldn't even tweak it, because no one wanted to bother with it after the first few tries.  We ended up ordering a pizza.   I would give it less than one star if I could.

I've made this recipe twice, and my family loved it.  Even my husband who claims he won't eat kale didn't complain.  I add what I have on hand, so I substituted walnuts and dried cranberries.  I also wilted the kale with the hot quinoa, as others have suggested.  Kale is a super food and I eat it as much as possible.

I skipped the currants b/c I don't like fruit in my salad and I substituted pine nuts for pecans and garlic vinegar for balsamic.  I took it to a pot luck and it was a big hit.

This was fabulous!  Like others, I added the quinoa while still warm - just barely wilts the kale a bit, which I prefer.  I toasted the pecans, added one chopped scallion and used raisins instead of currants.  I also probably doubled the lemon juice - I just kind of winged the dressing a bit.  Great recipe!  Flavors contrast each other perfectly - sweet, salty, tart, nutty.  Very healthy and delicious! Can't wait to experiment by using different nuts or seeds and other dried fruits.

Very versatile dish! I used dried cranberries for color and walnuts to give a little kick. I've also used chopped chicken when I didn't have nuts. I agree with the reviewer who used the warm quinoa to wilt the kale a little. It's a better texture.

This salad is delicious! I have never made a salad with kale before and it turned out great. I thought it would be a little bland so I added red pepper flakes, cayenne pepper and cumin to taste to the quinoa after cooking. I used horseradish mustard instead of Dijon. And I added a chopped up cucumber and jalapeno that I mixed up in a bit of extra dressing before adding. I used almonds instead of pecans because that is what I had on hand. Super delicious to have for lunch the next day. Will definitely make again!

The kale is a bit chewy/tough. Could it be quickly blanched and cooled down before eating? This is good and I love the dressing!

Terrific way to use kale! I made this for a party of 24 and it was a huge hit! Everyone loved it. Didn't need to put hot quinoa on it - the kale was tender and everything was perfect. Although there is no need to change anything as it is already perfect, I also made it with tomatoes and avocado, and craisins, just to see how it changed it, and it also was great. The dressing is perfect when you need a "lighter weight" dressing.

Delicious and healthy! Great side dish for summer.  I used lacinato kale and it kept well for a few days since kale doesn't get wilty or soggy.

We love this recipe. I like it better if you make it ahead and don't eat it immediately after making it.  It gives the flavors time to mingle.

Needs half as much pepper, no garlic, and a nut that's less expensive than pecans. Raisins (chopped) should be OK instead of currants. Not sure whether the salt is useful, given the feta. The "prep time" of 5 minutes is ridiculously wrong.

Absolutely delicious. I took the advice of another reviewer and massaged the kale with a teaspoon of sea salt. Great advice. It made the kale much more palatable. Also, we didn't have currents, so I substituted dried Michigan cherries. I'll be making this again. Healthy and delectable!

Very versatile...  made 1 and1/2 dressing; replaced currants with dried cranberries.  Sprinkled with sliced green onions.  Added pinch of cayenne to dressing because that's what we do to most savory  dishes.  This will be a summer staple.  Maybe with smoked salmon or chicken for complete meal.

I've used pumpkin seeds instead of pecans and dried cranberries instead of currants. I also follow the advice of the previous cook to put the quinoa on the kale when it's warm to steam the kale just a little bit. This recipe has become a family favourite.

I do massage the kale as per cookie's advice in the reviews.  I use dried cranberries instead of currants because I don't have currants sitting around.  In fact, I don't think I've ever even tasted a currant.  Otherwise, I do follow the recipe and it is always delicious.

This was delicious. I wasn't sure how much kale to use, since I used baby kale, so I just used what looked right to me. I didn't have any currents, so I used raisins. They added a nice sweet flavor to the salad. I will definitely be making this again.

My first time using Kale in anything  and I'm a vegetable lover. Instead of currents I used Craisins and instead of pecans I used slivered almonds.  I liked it and people that are salad and vegetable lovers liked it but not sure some of the guys were over the moon about it.  It's not something that I would serve or eat weekly but occasionally having kale is not bad.

Loved it and would definitely make it again! I halfed the recipe since I only cook for 2. Even then, I used about half the quinoa recommended and it was delicious. I used golden raisins over currents since it was all I had. Goat cheese over Feta. It was perfect and made a lot of salad. Luckily, kale keeps well overnight and I had the remaining salad the next day. Couldn't tell the difference.

The recipe was reduced to 2 servings and dried cranberries was used in place of the currants.  The sweetness from the dried cranberries and saltiness of the feta was a perfect combination.  I plan on making this one again.  Thank you for sharing.

Make sure to pre-soak the quinoa a few hours, and rinse really well to wash off the saponins that will give a bitter taste, before cooking. Don't overcook. Great salad recipe - really versatile! Massaging kale does work.

I made this recipe to go with a low-calorie honey mustard chicken breast dish I found on another website.  I loved this recipe SO much that I had it for breakfast the next day!  I didn't have any dried berries so I used candied almonds I had on hand instead to add sweetness.   I also added dried onion to the dressing to amp up the savory spice.  I will definitely add this too my side dish rotation (and breakfast rotation!) my kids even devoured it!  All hail kale recipes I don't have to bribe my kids and hubby to eat!

Love this salad.  I have made it for guests and they ask for the recipe.

The only thing I have changed is increase the feta and currants portions.

So delicious!  I made this to take to a salad luncheon and I used fresh kale from my garden.  I opted to use dried cranberries instead of the currents because that's what I had on hand.  I also left off the feta cheese even though I love good feta I didn't want the other flavors to be overwhelmed by the feta.  It was SO GOOD!  The dressing and the other ingredients had just the right flavor and texture blend.  The people at the luncheon complimented me on it and when my brother tried it he said (by way of a compliment) "This doesn't even TASTE like kale."  I'll take that as a pretty good compliment because I'm always trying to get my parents and family to eat more kale and sometimes they are reluctant.  But both my parents as well as my brother and sister ate this and seemed to enjoy it.

I "massaged" the kale and it turned out beautifully. I did, however, add a dash of sugar to the dressing portion and I left out the pecans since we have nut allergies. Everyone at dinner raved and fortunately there's enough left over for my lunch today!

Very flavorful salad. A very filling, hearty meal in itself. Great balance of flavors. I did omit 2 of the 3 Tablespoons of olive oil as I didn't find the extra fat and calories necessary. By request, I'm making it again for a potluck today. The kale holds up pretty well overnight in the fridge, so leftovers still taste good the next day.

The dressing was delicious! This will be a go-to kale recipe for me. Also this was the first time I made quinoa and I'm officially a fan. What a simple yet tasty combination of flavors.

Awesome salad! Only change I made was I used raisins instead of currents, and didn't add any mustard in the dressing. I was blown away how tasty this was. Will be making this more often :)

Awesome and versatile recipe.   First time I made it I used walnuts instead of pecans and blue cheese instead of feta.  If you add the quinoa hot off the stove, it melts the blue cheese and is just...just great.  

I've also added a can of drained black beans to this recipe as well as a sliced chicken breast for additional protein.

Great in a wrap as a meal to go.

I am so addicted to this salad.  The dressing is fabulous.  The only change I make is to cut back a little on the Quinoa.  I only use half the amount the recipe calls for, and I use chopped dried cherries instead of currants.

This recipe is terrific -- it's healthy, filling, a great mix of salty and sweet. I had eaten a similar salad at Moss Beach Distillery in Half Moon Bay, CA and was looking for one similar to it.  I replaced the currants with dried cranberries, and replaced the pecans with macadamia nuts.  The salad was a huge hit with my daughters too. Will definitely make again!

This is a total party pleaser and healthy! I never have left overs! Love it! 

I add more mustard and add more kale to make an extra half a batch.

I really like this recipe. Added too much kale once so it was a bit dry, used Italian bottled dressing in addition & it was loved by all. I use craisins instead of currants,  regular mustard & regular salt & pepper as I cannot get the more gourmet ingredients. I do massage the kale with the dressing & add the quinoa warm then refrigerate before adding the feta. This is a great salad for the holidays, a step above "normal"!!

This recipe has great bones. This isn't a kapow! dish, but any issue with bland flavours might be due to too little salt or olive oil. I took the other reviewers' comments and made a few alterations to make sure it was flavourful. I massaged the kale with salt and good olive oil which made it amazing and soft. I also cooked the quinoa in vegetable stock. For the dressing, I put the garlic, salt, mustard, olive oil and lemon juice in a mortar and pestle and ground to a purée and added some dried herbs. Then it sat for the 15 minutes it took the quinoa to cook which helps the garlic flavour get into the dressing. I prefer walnuts, so toasted them in the stove before adding. I ate the salad warmed from the quinoa, which was amazing. In the future I will add some cherry tomatoes. Delicious.

This was fabulous, although I was in too much of a rush to make the dressing from scratch and instead poured over a fig-balsamic-vinaigrette from the fridge. Outstanding! And I recommend adding the quinoa warm: it was fabulous warm.

First of all, if you massage the kale in sea salt, don't add any additional salt in the dressing or to the quinoa. With the feta it made it too salty. Next time I would massage the kale with the salad dressing and salt at the end to taste. I added chopped red onions, a splash of white balsamic and even my "I hate kale" husband liked it! I will be making this again! Great for wheat free diets too.

Very good. I used a pouch of quinoa and brown rice that took 90 seconds to heat so this was almost fast food. I used dried cranberries, no currants.

Loved it! I made it and served for 2, instead of 6. I used 1TBSP less oil, fig instead of currant. Tossing roasted chicken breast was also good idea.

Wow, this is by far the best salad I've ever made! Kale and quinoa are two daunting ingredients and although both are thoroughly nutritious, I've steered clear of them due to not having the confidence to prepare them well. This was my first stab at using both kale and quinoa and the salad turned out amazingly well, and healthy to boot! I followed the recipe almost exactly, except that I couldn't find dried currants at the local grocery store. Instead, I used Mariani dried tart cherries (they add sugar to them). One tip for prepping the kale: cut out the middle stalk on each leaf and discard before shredding the lettuce. The stalk is pretty tough and doesn't go well in a salad.

I discovered this recipe last summer and get rave reviews whenever I make it.  I do double the dressing because it didn't seem to have much flavor before I did that.  I also put the hot quinoa on the kale to wilt it a little as others have suggested.  This is just so good!  Thank you for sharing the recipe.

Yum! I did make a couple substitutions, due to what was on hand: red wine vinegar as I was out of lemons, some raisins in lieu of currants, and I'm not a pecan fan so I used pistachios. One thing I will try next time (and there will be a next time!) is adding a little honey to the dressing, as I think it could use a little more sweetness to counter the salty feta. All around, a solid base recipe!

Really like this recipe, particularly since I have been making lifestyle changes and ate quinoa for the first time with nothing on it. Hated it. I dared to order the quinoa and kale salad at Zupas but their dressing was high on vinegar. I've since ordered it again and it was perfect so it was just that batch. So I wanted to duplicate it. This comes very close. I've added my own twists to it but it's great just the way it is. For a slightly different taste, I added baby sweet corn, a couple of sweet small, sweet peppers, and a sweeter vinegarette. You might see the pattern here. Have a sweet tooth. Also added cilantro. So, it's great the way it is. But it's also great with a little sweeter taste.

Wow!  I loved this - pretty much made as is, with kale from the garden, massaging the kale a little with dressing prior to adding other ingredients.  Light, good flavors & feels like such a healthy thing to eat.  Wonderful!

Fantastic base recipe. I love to alter the 'extras'. You can change the lemon juice out for vinegars and then add whatever you'd like! Today's stars asparagus and red peppers, but you can basically put anything in it!

One of my new go to recipes. The store was out of currents so I used dried blue berries instead, which I actually preferred. I massaged the kale as one other member suggested. That was a great tip! As for it being "blah", feel free to adjust the mustard and lemon to your liking, and cook the quinoa using vegetable or chicken stock.

I can't believe how good this is!! I left out nuts and used chickpeas and left out the feta and sprinkled some in parm. Massaged the dressing into the kale and added the quinoa (cooked with onions and garlic) when it was hot. I could eat this salad all night!

This is the greatest way to eat Kale!  I steam my kale just a tad, and I add reduced fat feta, reduced sugar craisins and pine nuts to help with the calorie content of this.  It even tastes good as a left over the next day!

OMG. I've made this twice already this week. What a great recipe! I followed the advice of other reviewers and massaged the kale w bit of salt for a few minutes. I used pine nuts and hazelnuts, because I didn't have pecans. Also substituted dried cherries for the currants and parmesan for the feta because it's what I had on-hand. Added quinoa a few minutes after it finished cooking to wilt the kale. Very flexible recipe for adjustments.

Yum! I was a little skeptical at first but by the time I finished my bowl I couldn't get enough. After reading the reviews I decided to massage the kale before assembling, also I didn't have currents so I chopped up some raisins. Going to make this again.

Brought this to a potluck and it was a huge hit. Made sure to massage the kale first. Didn't have currants and it was still delicious.

I added the quinoa while still warm to wilt the kale somewhat. I also used vinegar instead of the lemon juice because I didn't have any on hand. I added crushed walnuts and Mediterranean feta. Super nutritious and delicious!

Delicious! Best kale salad I've tried. I did massage the kale, I always do. It really makes a difference. And I used raisins, didn't have currants. Will use this dressing on other salads, it was that good.

Looking for something to make with fresh kale,  I saw this recipe and said "I have most of that stuff."  However once I got started, I realized I had no pecans, no currents, and no feta cheese. I hate it when that happens! But necessity is the mother of invention and sometimes magic happens. I prepared the quinoa, dressing and kale as directed then used avocado, fresh strawberries and grated Swiss cheese as the replacements. It was amazing!

This is my first review after several years of using Allrecipes.  I had to review because I just love this salad.  It's a great way to use raw kale other than smoothies.  I've made this recipe several times with the only changes are using toasted almonds and dried cranberries- because that's what I had on hand.  The dressing is amazing, it taste light and refreshing.  And I followed advice of other reviews and tossed the salad well in the dressing, using my hands to toss and make sure everything is coated well and then putting the cooked quinoa over and toss again to wilt it just a bit.  I could eat the whole thing myself!  Thanks Kicius!

So delish!  Love how the freshly squeezed lemon juice brings out the lemony flavor of kale. Well balanced sour, sweet, salt with the neutral quinoa.  Happened to have all the ingredients on hand from the farmers market the 1st time, including Bulgarian feta.  The 2nd time I intended to supplement with feta from the grocery store.  For those who don't like feta & have only tried plastic tub packaged Wisconsin feta, I can understand your distaste.  It was like powder coated rubber erasers.  I was shocked at the difference in texture & flavor.  I will make a special trip to the cheese store tomorrow to buy fresh Bulgarian feta.  It was 1/3 the cost of Greek or Italian feta.  Quality ingredients make ALLLL the difference.

Also, I chopped the kale really finely, first in ribbons then cut across the other way (like dicing).  I found the stems are even tasty chopped finely & provide extra crunch. Didn't experience chewiness or bitterness at all.

Thank you for this recipe! It is simply delicious ! I didn't have currants ,so I substituted with dried cranberries. I will make it with currants next time. Although I'm sure it would be good with any dried fruit! What a nice ,healthy mix of ingredients. It is very difficult to get my husband to eat anything green but he liked this very much!  Great salad!

I absolutely love this recipe. If you're wanting a great salad for a meal and a great way to eat more kale, this is for you!  I have substituted toasted pine nuts for the pecans and cranberries for the currants.

Very enjoyable superfood salad. Great flavours and texture. Like other reviewers, I added the hot quinoa to the kale to wilt it slightly. I used almonds slivers and cranberries instead of pecans and currants, and threw in some diced avocado. Creative and tasty dish.

Just made this salad and I LOVED it, the flavours were amazing together. I did not have currants and I don't think I would use them anyways.  It will be my new potluck favourite.

I loved this recipe. I made as written and it made a lot so I had leftovers for two days. It remained crisp until we cleaned it up. I served with the pesto spinach chicken from this site and it made a great meal. I will be making this recipe again and again.

I've made this three times.  Loved it more each time.  I have found for my house (boys) I put the fruit and cheese on the side and let them add those to their liking.  Definately message the dressing into the oil.  I have a 12 year old boy (carnivore) that will eat this by the big bowlfulls.  I always make twice the recipe.  Also, any good nut/fruit will do.  We are fond of walnuts and craisins.

I wanted to make this Salad but did not all the ingredients so I substituted Cashews for the Pecans, Craisins for the Currants, Gorgonzola for the Feta and a Whole Grain Garlic Mustard for the Dijon Mustard and it was Awesome!

This recipe is absolutely delicious.  I chopped the kale in small pieces using a food processor.  My family does not like feta cheese, so I omitted it.  Also, I substituted the currants for dried pitted tart montmorency cherries from Trader Joe's. I'll make this again!

I took the advice to massage the kale. Also changed recipe by making vinagarette as part of the 2 cups of liquid to cook quinoa. Quinoa absorbs flavors very well but can be bland when cooked with no seasonings. Also added a whole head of kale and made another batch of the vinagarette for that. My 6 year old loved this salad and so did I!

I liked but didn't love this recipe. Not sure why it didn't end up as a "love" recipe as it has lots of my favorite ingredients - kale, quinoa, feta. I massaged the kale with salt to soften it (then rinsed kale to wash off the salt). 

Still a good and healthy salad.

Kale was a bit bitter, may try lightly sauteing next go around. That being said, it was heavenly. We used dried cranberries as we already had those in the pantry. Absolutely delicious!

Made some changes based on what I had on hand. Used spinach, fresh mozzarella and parmesan instead of feta, raisins instead of currants, walnuts for pecans, and whole seed mustard plus dry mustard in the dressing. I also tossed the quinoa in the salad warm to wilt the leaves a bit. Small substitutions, but every bit was eaten, plus seconds, including by my 5, 3, and 1 year olds. Will definitely make again and again for a nutritious summer meal.

I love, love, love this salad, it was very filling. This salad would be great for a lunch or dinner meal.   I made a few changes to the original recipe, based on some of the reviews. I cooked the quinoa in chicken broth, used spicy brown mustard and added balsamic vinegar, salt and pepper to taste to the dressing. I also let the salad chill for a few hours. Thank you Kicius for posting :)

This is a delicious salad! I made it with spinach, and added the warm quinoa to wilt the spinach a bit. Rather than currents, I added craisins.

I did not have currants or pecans so I used walnuts and cranberries. It turned out great and is very tangy. Would be good as a side dish next to red meat (well any meats).
