Tastes good but I agree with the other reviewer that is more like a brownie than a cake. Also stuck in the pans horribly so we ended up crumbling it up and serving more like a dessert with the glaze over it.

Amazing flavor!!!!  You definitely need to double the recipe so you don't get that brownie-feel.  I used a spring form pan and it stuck pretty bad, no matter what I did.  This recipes negative are mainly structure related and have nothing to do with the actual taste...you won't be disappointed there!

This came out a little bit more like a brownie than a cake, but it was quite good nonetheless. 

Looks intimidating, but well worth the steps!

Decadent cake. More brownie like. I couldn't get butterscotch bits so used resses peanut butter bits. Very tasty. You don't need a big portion as it is very rich. Serve with cream. Yum. It didn't stick in the pans for me.
