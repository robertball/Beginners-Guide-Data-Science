I used only part of the recipe - the seasoning and cooking of the chicken, the mushrooms and marsala wine (although thrilled to note I could use beef broth).  Chicken was tender and melting.   Excellent.  I chose not to use frozen anything, but accompanied my dish with pasta and fresh asparagus (which I steamed separately).  The combinations were just lovely.  I live in NZ and we don't have Can't Believe It's Not Butter - we have REAL butter, which is what I used.  I gave a 3 star rating simply because of the frozen ingredients and prepared packaged ingredients suggested.  Other than that, easy and tasty.
