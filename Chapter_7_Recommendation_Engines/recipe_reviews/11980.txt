Very nicely flavored, easy to work with dough.  I rolled the doug very thinly, and with this recipe was able to cut out about eighty 3" pierogi.  Use plenty of flour when rolling out this dough.  Served them to my potato-lovin' hubby & kids for dinner (there went about 30-40+).  Made some for the kids' lunch the next day (18-20 more) and then made enough for another dinner (another 30+) and a few miscellaneous for another lunch -- they froze & reheated well after being boiled. The sour cream adds a delicious note to the dumpling dough and pairs well with the mashed potato/onion/cheddar cheese filling I used & just a simple brown butter sauce drizzled on top. With 3" wrappers, I used about teaspoon (little less) of filling.  They sealed very easily with a fork but take note -- if you don't keep the rounds covered and the edges dry out even a teensy bit it will be difficult to seal them.  Dough was toothsome and just the right texture.  One of the best pierogi recipe I've tried & definately a keeper for our family -- thanks bunches!

I'll just make a mention to folks that there really is no exact science to how much liquid your flour is going to take.. it can vary by the day, depending on the temperature and humidity!! I would suggest adding it slowly and working it in, adding more as necessary..

Wow, these were great.  I divided the dough into about 6 small sections, wrapping each section in waxed paper.  THe more the dough is worked with, the longer it is exposed to air causing it to become dry.  As it dries, it becomes increasinly tough and difficult to work with.  I think I used about 1 1/2 cups of water in the dough.  This makes a huge batch!  I only made half of the cheese-potato filling and I still have some leftover.  It took me about 3 hours to roll out, stuff, and seal these guys.  Oh, but it was worth it.  I've got a freezer full of pierogis, a quick and delicious meal any night!  I served them with caramelized onions and some sour cream.

These are good.....I find freezing them on a parment paper lined baking sheet first is better than the butter method.  After a couple of hours just put into a freezer bag.

Yum!  Made these tonight, very good.  I ended up freezing most of them, have a lot of pierogies in my freezer right now!  As far as how much warm water to use-I ended up using a little over a cup, kneading this dough is definitely a great work-out for the upper body.  I rolled the dough through my pasta maker on number 2, this helped me keep all of the pierogies uniform in shape.  This recipe is definitely time consuming-between the dough and making the filling,(we used the potato/cheese), but the time spent is worth it with the final results. The few that I did cook up tonight were delicious-I boiled them and then pan-fried them and then served them with carmelized onions and sour cream.  Yum, yum, yum!  I am looking forward to eating these again soon.

They're also great if you add a little caramelized onion to the potato and cheese filling and serve them up with sour cream and sauteed onions and bacon.  Also, they're great pan fried.

My husbands grandmother always made Pierogi's on Christmas Eve. I had never this dish but wanted to give him a gift from his childhood. From the first time I made these they turned out great!!I use the potato filling and add a little grilled onion and cheddar cheese. Everyone in the family can now enjoy a dish that my husband has such fond memories of.  Thanks!

These turned out well!  The dough became soft and difficult to work with as it warmed up. As the process is time consuming, you might want to put half the dough in the fridge while you shape the other half.  We filled them with spiced up mashed potatoes, and served them with a ketchup/sour cream mixture (sounds weird, but tastes good).  Our friends really liked them.

I have been looking for just the right pierogi dough for years... and this is pretty close to my Polish grandmas recipe! ( and the best I have found on this site) It was difficult to get mixed initially, but I finally just  added water, divided it in 1/3's, and kneaded flour back in till it was smooth and easy to work with.  A few suggestions for those of us who are pierogi-challenged: I squeeze or roll the fillings into lots of  aprox 1 Tbsp balls, which moves things along quickly once you get rolling- just grab a ball of filling and wrap the dough around it. ( neater too ) Secondly- rather than cut out circles, I set a ball of filling about an inch from an edge, fold the dough over it, then use the glass to cut a half-moon, and pinch the edges together.  I boil them and let them drain/dry on a cooling rack, then transfer them to wax paper. Less problem with the underside getting soggy.  I use my own fillings- but the recipe for the dough is great! Not a leak in the batchh!

Would've been nice to have an exact measure of water - my dough didn't turn out correctly initially.  It tasted pretty good, though.

I ate pierogis all my life. My grandparents were immagrants from Poland. This was a Christmas Eve treat. My dough is different having potato in it. We had cheese pierogis with farmers cheese or extra dry cottage cheese. we also made cabbage pierogi. We would make 300 of each kind because we always had a community party. They freeze very well. We never wanted the dough to dry and crack so flour was put on them and after freezing taken off as much as possible. After we boiled the pierogis they were put into a serving dish and onions fried in a lot of butter or margarine was put on top to keep from sticking. We liked to put mustard on our pierogis before eating.

First, one thing that I absolutely hate about this recipe is the fact that the submitter gives you no idea at all about how much water to use.  Sorry, but I just have to say it.  If you've never made pierogis before, you really have no point of reference on what "...dough feels like velvet" means.   I did mine in the KA, and they ended up being a little tough and chewy (did not over knead the dough).  So either less flour or more liquid the next time.  I filled 12 with the sauerkraut filling, and the remaining 12 with the potato cheese filling...we preferred the potato cheese.  Boiled them, then browned them in a skillet with some butter, sliced onions and mushrooms.  This has the potential to be great once the ingredients are quantified a little better, and I definitely will try this again.  Thanks Jill for sharing your recipe.

This recipe does take a long time (longer than 1 hour) from making the filling to rolling and cutting the dough, but it's well worth it. Because I didn't have 8 cups of AP flour, I used half AP flour and half whole wheat. I didn't mix the flours, I just made two separate doughs. In hindsight, I should have just mixed them because the whole wheat flour made the dough too dense and it overpowered the flavor of the filling. So mixing the two would have worked out better. I did add caramelized onions to the filling and that was fantastic. It takes about 5 minutes to boil them (7-8 minutes for the whole wheat), and then I fried them in 2 TS of butter over medium heat. Served with sour cream and fresh ground pepper, these were a crowd pleaser, and there's plenty more in the freezer. All in all, a great recipe that my polish grandfather would be proud of.

If you have never made dough before (I hadn't), this recipe is terrible.  I had no idea how much water to add & ruined the first batch accordingly.  I had to search for other recipes to get an idea about the amount of water for my second batch.  Start with less than a cup and add very slowly from there.

These were great.  This was the best pasta recipe I've ever used for a "dumpling".  My husband said the pasta was "killer." I just used leftover garlic mashed potatoes and I cut the serving size down to 3, but that easily made enough for 2 of us to have 6 a piece, and I am freezing 18 pierogis. 

I will keep this dough recipe for raviolis as well! The possibilities are endless.

I don't know if this one was user error or the recipe...but I had so much trouble with the dough that I gave up after getting about half done.  Perhaps it's just being a novice at pierogi making, so, honestly, I may try again sometime (should I forget the massive headache it gave me the first time around).   I prefer not failing at recipes so there is a good chance this one will get another looksee!

I used to make my own dough for years until I decided to try this one. It was the BEST pierogi I have ever had! Not only does this taste way better, but it is so much easier to work with. It doesn't stick as bad as other dough does, and it was very easy to roll and stretch out.

Made them for a pre-Super Bowl party to represent the Steelers, as Pierogi are popular in Pittts. Dough turned out good, but elastic. Made it hard to work with and had to keep pressing it out after cutting the circles. Not knowing at least a recommendation of how much water to add would be helpful. That said everyone loved them!! So lots of work, but great flavor.  BTW I used both filling. Only alteration was carmelized onion and goat's cheese were added to potato filling.

My polish husband hated this dough recipe. It was more like pasta than what his family makes. I think the ratio of flour to eggs and sour cream is too high. There is a different recipe on here that we will use. We won't be using this again!

These were so good.  I used the potato/cheese mixture when I made them and they were wonderful.  I used my kitchen aid mixer for the dough which made the mixing very easy.  We tried boiling only, boiling then frying in butter, and boiling then frying in butter with onions and frying with chopped onion was our favorite.  Served with a dollop of sour cream.  I halved the recipe and it still made 36 three inch pierogies.(I didn't have a 3 1/2 in. cutter or glass)

Haven't tried this recipe yet and I prefer a potato dough but I'm willing to try it, sounds easier than the old fashioned way!

Just wanted to add one more thing.. my favorite is the meat mixture which uses browned salted and peppered ground beef to which I've thrown in some sauteed onions, mushrooms and a bit of sauerkraut!

I used the sauerkraut filling following this pierogi dough recipe but found it to be very heavy and way too chewy.  Kinda ruined the whole experience but overall the flavour was good.  I ended up using at least 1 1/2 cups of water.  Perhaps baking powder was needed or less flour?  I did boil them, then pan-fried them in an onion and bacon mixture to serve, but the dough was pretty dissapointing for my first attempt.

Being of Polish ancestry, I've had one or two pierogis in my time. I haven't made them in years, and decided on this recipe after looking at many. I halved it and got about 18.  I used a small tart press that my father gave me many years ago with the intention of using it for pierogis. The dough dries out quickly, so I initially refrigerated it for 10 min. I then worked in small batches at a time, returning the remainder to the fridge. That worked well.  I used both a sauerkraut filling and a cheese filling. It's challenging to get the dough to the correct thickness; too thick = gummy, too thin = filling comes out. Both happened to me. I boiled the finished product for 10 min, the rinsed gently under cold water. I then pan-fried with butter and a little water. I'm going to try freezing some of them. I think you need to make these a few times before you get the right formula down.

These were AWESOME!!! I love sauerkraut and just had to try these. 1/4 of the pierogis I boiled then fried and 1/4 of them I just fried. Hubby liked the boiled one but I liked just fried. I used a sour cream, lemon juice, garlic powder, onion powder, and dill weed dipping sauce. I can't wait to use the other 1/2 of the dough for the potato filling.

This is simply the easiest and best tasting pierogi recipe. My parents make pierogi many years ago and would never try again because their pierogis fell apart when boiling. I gave them this recipe and it did not fail them!

This is the easiest and best dough recipe i ever made. I usually cut it in half.  When i make the whole recipe i use the other half to make raviolli, as it is great for both.

Delicious, soft dough recipe.
My only recommendation to those having water difficulty- it is always easier to add more flour to your dough than water , I usually approximate the 3:1 ratio

This dough recipe for pierogi is absolutely the easiest I've ever worked with. I used 2/3 cup of water and felt it was perfect for my batch. I also aerated my flour before measuring which may have made a difference with the need for less water than others have talked about. I used my pasta machine to get the  dough sheets even (#4 was the highest I went) and worked in small batches using flour to coat the dough as needed. I have a pierogi mould I inherited from my mother-in-law and it worked great. I also par-cooked the pierogi and then flash froze them. On Easter, I'll let them thaw and pan fry them with butter and onions. The batch made 100 pierogi.

I liked this recipients very much. I Do think though that 6 1/2-7 cups of flour are plenty.  I also used the cheese potato filling but added some slightly sauteed thinly sliced green onions, with half contains and half sharp cheddar cheeses.  They turned out very nice with a smooth flavorful filling. I recommend anyone to try this dish, it is time consuming but everyone will think your a genius.

They were perfect and easy to make! You can also mix it up with your fillings for the center. I made several from this recipe so I froze the  extra and they turned out fine from the freezer. I like to cook mine in a skillet with butter and onion.

It's delicios! All the family enjoyed them. But they are pierozhki, not pierogi. Pierog is a big thing - like a cake. You make just one and you use the whole dish or pan for it. There are meat pierogi, vegetable pierogi and sweet ones. I just wanted you to know. It's a common mistake for non-Russian cookers to confuse these terms. Pierog is big like a cake, pierozhki are little and you make a lot of them.

This was my first attempt at making pirogi. I liked how the dough came together, although it took more water than I thought it would. I would definitely make again but I would make certain I made the filling the day before, as it took awhile to cool and I was anxious to finish the pirogi!

I'm Polish and grew up with Pierogi but my parents never wrote down their recipes.  Anyway, I made this with the sauerkraut filling and thought it was PERFECT.  I didn't add the mushrooms because I don't like them and my parents never had them either.  These taste GREAT.  Thanks for sharing

I made this last night for my family and it was good. However I must have not rolled the dough thin enough because they were very thick.Also I would advise cutting the potato filling down to half a batch because it made far to much.
