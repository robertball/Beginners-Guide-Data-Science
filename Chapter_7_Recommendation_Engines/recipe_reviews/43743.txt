I give thumbs up for this recipe. My fianc√©e and I like it very much. I made six skewers for dinner and served it with boiled asparagus and potato salad. Yes... it's kind of west met the east dinner. I made some changes to the marinade, I used lemon juice instead of vinegar, and added some lemon zests.

This is fantastic!  Simple to make and wonderfully tasty.  I found the recipe a few months ago and have already made it 5-6 times!  It's almost like candied salmon - but not that sweet.

I did have difficulty getting 12 skewers out of a pound of salmon but it really doesn't matter how many you have as long as they're all about the same size so they cook evenly.  On the one occasion we had a few skewers left over, I stripped off the salmon, mixed it up with a little mayo and had a great salmon spread for crackers as well!

Thank you, thank you, thank you!

These were pretty good.  I used the same marinade on chicken skewers as well and they tasted great.  May not make with the salmon too often as that can be expensive, but will definitely use the marinade on chicken again.

I tested this recipe last night and it was a hit!  I'll definately be serving this at our Luau party next week. It's a fairly mild marinade that doesn't overwhelm the salmon.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I did Salmon Fillets for this.  They were awesome!  I also ended up using the indoor grill that goes on my range top.  They turned out delicious!!  I was plesantly surprised!  My husband really, really loved them too!

Yummy!!! The salmon was delish! I substituted lemon juice for the vinegar, and ground ginger for the fresh ginger, as other reviewers suggested. Thank you for this recipe - I'll definetely be making it again!

Well it's day 4 of salmon for supper and this was by far the best (yes we gorge on salmon during the short sockeye season). In fact I want to go back and rate the others as 4 because they are no where near as good as this one. No overbearing tastes, the salmon really comes through. We served it as the main course with rice and grilled peppers.

These were really, really tasty! I added some seasme oil to the marinade along with cayeene pepper, and seasoning salt. After I brushed on the salmon, I dusted some ginger right on the salmon, and let it sit there for like 20. Great finger food!

We really liked these.  Very simple to prepare and the squeeze of the lemon wedge after cooking is a must.  We will make these again.

Great recipe! The marinade was very tasty. I changed it up a bit by alternating the salmon chunks with pineapple and asparagus on the skewer. Instead of grilling it, I broiled it in the oven at 400 degrees. Came out perfect!

This recipe is awesome just the way it is! I did change one thing but it would not change the flavor...I substituted agave syrup for the honey (same flavor just a change for health reasons). It was wonderful, not too sweet, not too salty. The only issue I had was the salmon had a tendency to fall off the skewers. I did put it on tin foil sprayed with oil. This helped a bit. My sons (1 yr and 7 yrs LOVED it...went back for seconds, and they do not usually care for fish). My hubby loved it too. We will be making this again and again, thanks!

I made this exactly as printed as a main dish and the whole family loved it. It was easy and quick and I already had all the ingredients on hand. Don't overcook the fish on the grill or it may start to fall apart. Thanks for the recipe!

Great grilling experience! I read through all of the reviews and created my own recipe. I added sesame seeds and a little wasabi paste to the marinade. I also used lemon juice instead of vinegar, extra fresh garlic, and dried ginger. On the skewers I alternated salmon, fresh pineapple, and water chestnuts. I had lemon wedges on each end. I marinated the kebobs for 30 minutes or so and then brushed sesame oil on each side to prevent sticking to the grill. I continued to baste them throughout the grilling process. I served this with sticky rice topped with the remaining marinade(after boiling it to kill bacteria)and grilled bok choy. WHAT A MEAL!

I use this sauce every time I make salmon. I bake a salmon filet in the oven after marinading for a short. while, it is always delicious. My sister, a very picky eater, loves it.

This is a wonderful marinade for salmon. When we assembled the skewers, we alternated chunks of salmon with chunks of pineapple. Turned out AMAZING! A must try variation.

Everyone said that they enjoyed these, but I wasn't sure if they were just trying to be nice! I didn't think there was enough marinade, so I would let them sit in the marinade over night. Also, I would probably cook them in tin foil over the bbq next time and cook it in the sauce. It just wasn't flavorful enough!

This was good - a bit sweet for me. I guess I just don't like sweet salmon. I'll stick to blackened salmon.

Very good.  Squeezing the lemon at the end of the skewer before eating adds a nice touch.  I tried this with both salmon and tuna, and both worked great!

This was awesome, melts in your mouth.  The lemon wedge on the end is a nice touch...you squeeze it before pushing the salmon off the stick, and it gives it a nice lemony kick.

This was a wonderful and easy recipe. Instead of grilling the salmon on the grill, I grilled them on the stove. Once done, I placed them onto of some romaine lettuce and poured the hot marinade over the salmon and salad. The sauce was perfect and not at all overpowering.

Pretty tasty, although a bit sweet for our tastes. I think I will tweak the marinade a bit next time and I'm sure it will be five star then :) Also, we marinated and baked filets of salmon instead of grilling as it is like 105 degrees out right now.

This is awesome. I did not do skewers, just marinaded two pieces of salmon for 4 hours and then grill it. I used lemon juice only on the plate according everybodys preference. Soo good.

THESE WERE AMAZING!! I have officially fallen in love with these salmon skewers. I didn't have rice vinegar, so I used basalmic vinegar. Also, I didn't have fresh ginger root, so I used the powedered kind instead, like someone said before. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly... they came out so light and soft.. it felt AND tasted great! I will definetly be making this when we have guests over. Thank you so much!

One last thing -- I didn't have lemon wedges, so the salmon was by itself on the skewers. However, you MUST add droplets of juice from the lemon before you start to eat it, don't eat it without doing that!!

Loved this turned out great. The only changes I made was the ginger, I didn't have fresh, so I used powdered and only little a couple pinches since I don't like when it overpowers the flavor of things. Also I did not have rice vinegar so I used cider vinegar. We loved it and will definitely make it again. Thanks     for the great recipe.

I served it at a bbq, using wild sockeye salmon. It was popular with the salmon enthusiasts, but I thought it was salty. Next time I'll use the low-sodium soy sauce, and a little more honey.

This is the best salmon recipe I've ever made.  The fish on the skewers is a little tricky on the grill but the flavor is so worth it! I added a little cornstarch to the marinade while cooking it on the stove.  Then basted the skewers again while grilling.  It came out like a teryaki bbq sauce...nice and thick.   My family loves it.

Great tasting for all age groups. Used aluminum foil to braise.
Almost like ahi tuna, but less expensive.

Made this exactly as written.  The butcher at the grocery store skined the fillet for me which made it much easier.  These were one of four meat skewers served and none were left while all the others had some or most uneaten.

Made exactly as written, forgot the lemon though.  I marinated for around two hours.  Only thing is it did stick to grill even with the oil.  I may try to grill on foil or get one of the fish grilled

This was just ok for me. I probably won't make it again. I prefer my usual salmon marinade of soy sauce, butter, garlic, and Italian seasoning.

It was pretty good and easy. We are not bigged into fish so I made pork chops on the grill just in case. We chose the fish over the pork. Becareful on the thin pices, may fall off the skew.
