Great egg casserole.  My Husband and I had it for dinner one evening and it was a great change from the norm.  Next time I think I'll try the diced chili's instead so we won't even need a knife at all.  Will definitely have this again.

I have had this recipe for years.  I use swiss Cheese instead of chedder.  Another way I have used it was as an appetizer(cut into small bite-size pieces).

Made this for bruch as soon as it was sent to me.  Very simple, very quick...but warning--very hot.  We liked it but it needed the French bread and tropical fruit salad I served with it to mellow the taste.

I used this as a dinner side dish for something different.  I used chopped chiles and added a layer of Swiss cheese on top of the chedder cheese.  Then I sprinkled crumbled bacon on the mixture before I put it in the oven.  The bacon added a nice crunch and texture to it.  Very delicious

I adapted this recipe slightly as follows and it was delicious. 
7 oz can diced chilis
1 C shredded cheddar
1 C shredded mozzarella cheese
5 eggs
1/2 cup milk
Salt and pepper to taste

Combine the chili and cheeses in a bowl then add to greased baking dish. 
Beat eggs and milk then pour over chili cheese mixture. 
Add salt and pepper to taste. 
Bake as directed. 
Simple and so tasty!

We enjoyed this dish very much.  However, it can't possibly provide eight servings.  To serve four, I used 2 4oz. cans of whole chilis but kept everything else the same.  Will definitely prepare it again.

This was soooo good! It reminded me of a chili relleno. I doubled the recipe, added a couple of extra eggs, extra cheese, a scant 1/2tsp. salt, 1/4tsp. pepper and 1/4 tsp. garlic pepper. Yummy with hot sauce and sour cream.

I used one 7 oz. can & one small can of chili peppers as I thought two 7 oz. cans seemed like a lot for 4 eggs.  Anyway, the chile pepper taste was still overwhelming for us.  Different strokes for different folks.  Maybe we would have liked it better if the recipe had only one 7 oz. can or even just one small can, which would still have given it a litle zip.

I love this recipe.  I also add thin slices of ham into the mix with each layer of green chiles.  It turnes out great and is a low carb keeper.

To de-spice your chillis open them and use a spoon to scrape out all the veins,seeds, and lighter colored parts that hold the seeds.  This will make the recipe less spicy for you.  FYI- sugar, soaking in lemon juice or vinigar, and cooking also eliminate spice while giving flavor of chillis to your recipe.  I used to think spice was the only thing chillis couild contribute as far as flavor.  I was OH SO WRONG!  Even the most tender palate can enjoy chill peppers!

Pretty good, but I agree with the other review that said there is no way this could feed 8. At least not for my family. The three of us polished this off in one sitting, so double the recipe if you need to feed more than 4.

We topped this with a green chili sauce and it was wonderful! I also added a bit of garlic powder to the green chilies for extra flavor. We did have to cook it for about 15-25 minutes longer than recipe states.

This was good but thought it could use an addition cheese so when it was pretty much set I removed it from the oven and added 1/2 cup of Monterey Jack, (shredded), top with a drained can of Rotel tomatoes then another 1/2 cup of Monterey Jack, popped back into the oven for 15 minutes, was great!

Have used this, or similar recipe, for many years but I add browned ground beef to the layers.  Makes it more of a meal! A very huge hit with the family and friends!  We look forward to September when the fresh Hatch chilies appear in the stores, roast them on the grill, then this recipe is a must!

I use this recipe for holiday brunches, in addition to the cheddar cheese I add some cream cheese which makes it light and fluffy.

I've been making this for at least 30 yrs and still love it!
The only changes I make are the following:
I use diced canned chiles. Much easier to eat and you don't need a fork. We live in olive country and therefore incorporate them it to many recipes. I take a can of olives and chop them up while in the can. Layering them with the chilies and finally putting them on top of the last of the cheese.  Of which I use a lot more cheese than this recipe calls for. Varies according to taste. Just make sure you use REAL cheese . The pre-grated inexpensive cheese will ruin this casserole.

Most of al---enjoy!

This is really more of a tortada, but I liked it. 4 Eggs didn't seem like nearly enough for a 12x8 dish, so I actually used 11 and it turned out perfect. Next time I would probably use diced chilis, but that's just a personal preference.

I love this recipe and have been making it for over a year now.  I put flour tortillas in the layers.  They absorb some of the moisture and make for a more filling meal.  I find it a little sloppy without the tortillas.  I just read through other reviews and I'm going to have to try it with bacon.  Sounds delish!

We really Loved this dish. We had it for dinner with a side salad of avocado, tomatoes and red onion. The next morning we had it for breakfast with a side of bacon and toast. The only thing I added besides more cheese was corn tortillas in all the layers. I also used heavy cream instead of milk and one 4oz can of hot chiles and 3 cans of mild. Excellent! Can't wait to make it again.

This was very good.  I think green chili peppers are under rated, we just love them.  I added about 1/2 cup extra cheese of the monterey jack and colby mix.  I also added half a can of green sauce before I added the egg.  It gave it more of a chili flavor that we love.  I cooked about 5 minutes longer and let it sit covered for 10 minutes before serving.  We did use a smaller, taller dish so I had to improvise my cooking time without burning. This is a definate do over for dinner or breakfast.  We ate leftovers this morning.  Very good and easy! This is also healthy with few calories and high in protein, excellent for the health conscious person.

A fine basic brunch recipe that we served over toast with hot sauce. We used the smaller cans of chilies, and found the amount perfect. Next time we may attempt to transform this into a "tater tot" casserole type dish. It's so easy to throw together on a Sunday morning, we'll definitely be making it again!

Really good casserole. Very good for breakfast with toast. We put green taco sauce and sour cream on the side to dress it up. I made it with six eggs and had to cook it for 45 minutes instead of 25-35.

I am so happy to find this recipe. I had this about 35 years ago in La Jolla, Ca. the lady that made it used slightly hot large green chilis layered like this recipe. It just fantastic! You could always put this in a pie crust for a quiche!

If you don’t really love green chilies, I wouldn’t recommend this recipe, because that’s all you taste.  I wish I had added some ham or bacon like other reviewers suggested.  I probably won’t try this one again.

I did make a few changes because I had a ton of eggs, so I used 7 eggs in a 9x13" pan along with 11 or 12 peppers from a box of fresh roasted when we were in Reno last August (I froze these about 10-13 per quart size bag).  I used some of my Costco - Kirkland 4 cheese blend in the blue package and added some fresh grated Cheddar and Monterey Jack.  I used about as much as she suggested.  When using the eggs, I separated and whipped the whites to a slightly stiff peak and folded it into the egg yolk and milk mixture.  Because I used more eggs I went to 1/2 cup of milk and added about 1 to 2 teaspoons of cornstarch keeping it gluten free and to thicken it a little bit.  Those of you who do not have to worry about gluten can use flour.  Same bake time for me.  My husband loved it too.

I have made this several times, once using ham and a couple of times using breafast sausage. I also chop a seeded jalapeno and red onion to add some heat as the green chilis are very mild. I raise chickens and this is an awesome way to use eggs, it is really much better the next day, too!

We had this last night for dinner & loved it!  Followed the recipe, except I did not measure the cheese.  I just grated a bunch and layered. There was only enough (mild) chilies for 2 layers, or I layered them too close together? I also had to let this cook for an additional 10 minutes, 40 minutes total.  It set perfect, not messy or soggy at all. As others have claimed, if you don't LOVE green chilies, you may not care for this. Using the whole chilies, you did get some big bites of them.  I paired this with a fruit salad and sourdough loaf with a garlic cheese spread.  I will definitely make this again & may use the suggestions of other reviewers by adding sausage or a side of avocado and sour cream. YUMMY!

I make something very similar but I use fat-free half and half instead of milk.  In place of sprinkling shredded cheese, I use string cheese, preferably the cheddar/mozzarella blend, and stuff each chile with a cheese stick or part of one, depending upon the length of the pepper.  We have this for brunch served with salsa and sliced avocado.  Very yummy and fast; great for a crowd or as the poster notes, it can be sized up or down.

I enjoyed this recipe for breakfast today. I scaled it down to a single serving, but I think this could have fed two people. I gobbled this all up. I used 2 eggs, 2 tsp half and half, pepper jack cheese (I didn't have cheddar), 3 mild whole green chili peppers split in half lengthwise, salt and pepper. I layered in an individual size casserole dish and baked for 20 min at 400 degrees in a toaster oven. It was perfect. I wish I hadn't eaten the entire portion but it was so very tasty. Thanks so much for sharing. I will definitely make again.

Made this for work potluck breakfast (x3).  Not a bit left - would add salsa on side next time to spice it up for those that like spicy. Very good and was perfect for potluck breakfast.

If you like green chili, you will love this...my family all ate this for dinner and even though it is a typical breakfast/brunch meal, it's a good way to change it up here and there and it's sooo good.

This was a very nice, moist egg dish.  I made it in an 8x8" dish.  We roasted two Hatch chilis for it as this batch was particularly hot even for our tastes.  I used 1/8 t. salt and pepper, 1/2 t. garlic powder, 1/8 c. Hormel real bacon bits and doubled the cheese.  I baked it for 30 min. and it was done perfectly to our liking.  Thanks!

I needed to make a brunch dish to serve 25 people.  I chose this recipe and made 4 quiche using premade pie crusts.  I didn't use bacon.  They turned out great and were easy to make.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I used two 4 ounce cans of green chilies and one 4 ounce can of diced jalapeños (I like it hot)!  I also used six eggs instead of four, along with extra cheese.  SO good!!

I remember it not being enough so this time I doubled the eggs and the milk.  I used a large can 27 oz of green chilis.  Not sure how one would get two layers with anything less.

This was fantastic!  Being that time of year, I was able to use freshly roasted green chilis.  I also added half of a tomato for color (and because I had one in the fridge).  Since I eat lower carb, I also changed out the milk for half and half.

Delicious low carb dish!  Helped with my Mexican cravings.  I have a hard time finding whole green chilies here so I used 3 cans chopped and spread them out over the bottom of the pan.  I also added a little Tabasco and garlic powder to the egg mixture.  Yum!

I love this dish!  I make it for every brunch/breakfast occassion and it always gets rave reviews!  I do make 2 small changes.  First, I use just one can of the whole green chili and then add 7 oz of the frozen green chili. (hot!)  This spices it up a bit.  I then poor it all into a ready to bake pie crust, serve it with salsa & sour cream.  Voila!  Green chili & egg pie!

I added some bacon crumbles and some fresh, seeded dice jalapenos to give it a little kick. And I used more cheese than it called for but it was awesome.
Take it out of oven before its super firm, so its nice and moist.

A great casserole-have made it as a side dish as is-served with other Tex-Mex dishes!  My favorite is to add cooked chicken in the middle of 2 layers-yum. Also good reheated the next day for lunch!

This was soso easy & soso delish!!! I could only find diced chilies, but other than that, I made a portion of the recipe exactly. I made about 2/3 of the casserole adding a few of my favorite omelet ingredients, chopped thinly and already sautéed: onion, bell pepper and mushroom, and also some browned ham (I just heat it up in a saucepan to brown it a bit). I added all of the "omelet ingredients" in 1/3, just some ham in the middle, and left the other 1/3 just as is, as already noted. I put the “toppings” in before covering the entire casserole w/ the egg mixture, baked it for 20 mins., and WOWZA! It was SO tasty. I liked ALL three versions, and having the variety was great! Thanks so much for the recipe! Definitely a keeper! Also, I used cooking spray to avoid stick (not sure if it was really needed or not). And I'm not sure what one of the reviewers is talking about. My best friend hates spicy, and she's the one who introduced me to canned chili peppers. They are really, really mild. They have a lot of flavor and are great in trillions of recipes, even for those of us who don't like too much heat. Maybe they bought jalapeño peppers accidently? Now those are spicy!

So simple and absolutely delicious!!!  I of course had to add my own twist.....  I added  shredded chicken Breast from a store bought  roasted chicken  and scallions to the layers.  Instead of four eggs, I  doubled the eggs and milk. Before putting in the oven, I added a handful of black olives distributed evenly over the top.  Cooking time was extended til the middle came out clean with a tooth pick.  It wasn't only beautiful, but delicious!!!  A must try!!!

People need to pay more attention when writing recipes. Says serves 8? HA!! 8 toddlers maybe. Was barely enough for 4 adults. Also cook time was off took out of oven after 30 mins and was still runny inside had to cook it for another 10 mins which helped but still was a bit damp. I think maybe because of the chilis. The recipe needs to specify to drain the chilis. Easily could be a 5 star recipe as the flavour was all there. Just double the recipe cook longer and drain the chilis and youre golden.

Sooo yummy!! I make mine with organic ground beef and freshly diced red onion (I put them on top of the cheese in each layer), I also add 2 eggs and a dash more milk to make more. It'll be kind of watery when you first pull it out of the oven, but don't be alarmed, it sets pretty quickly! :)

Did not like the casserole by itself. I used one can 7 oz. can of chilies, overpowered with chile flavor, needed more other flavors. I fried some bacon and used squares of the casserole in English muffins with strips of bacon. Gave the muffins a Mexican inspired twist!

I loved this!  The roasted whole green chilis added so much to this dish.  I have always made egg dishes with diced but these are superior in my opinion.   This goes into the rotation for sure!  Thanks for sharing!

Have made this several times now and like it just as much as the first time I made it. My husband doesn't like eggs much but he really likes this combo. Sometimes I add ground beef or turkey to the layers and would like to try crumbled bacon some time. I like to try different spices too. A few times a month works for us.

Good stuff! I added ham and onions to it as well as Jack cheese. I also used more green chilies and 6 eggs. I did bake it longer, closer to an hour so it wasn't soupy. I didn't use near as much milk for that reason. I added garlic powder to the eggs when I put in the salt and pepper.

A recipe I have always loved but lost track of. Gluten free!  Tonight I had some corn tortillas and cooked ground beef to use up, so I added those to the layers.  I had to double the egg/milk mixture. I think my old recipe had more milk with the eggs.

I made this for breakfast today. It is a perfect canvas to add your own preferred ingredients. I added ground cumin, garlic powder and crushed chilies (de Arbol) to the egg mixture. I used egg substitute and non-fat milk to reduce the fat/cholesterol levels. I served it with sliced avocado and fresh pico de gallo.

This was Great! I added a can of corn, I tend to go over board with the cheese but Man who doesn't Love a blanket of warm gooey Cheese?? This goes well with just about any protein and makes a lovely light lunch when you add a tossed salad. Thank You KGNEP This is a keeper!

My go-to for an easy breakfast. You can alter it in so many ways- we've tried adding sausage, chicken, extra veggies.... very versatile. It's still good as a stand-alone recipe too.

A simple, yet tasty recipe.  I used roasted Hatch green chilis and it made for a spicy and delicious casserole.
