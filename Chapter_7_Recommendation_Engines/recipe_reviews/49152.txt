I used 6oz (most of a tub) veggie cream cheese in place of the expensive boursin cheese and the recipe worked out great! It really tasted like something I would get at a restaurant, ant the leftovers were perfect, hot or cold. I will definately make this again!

We LOVED this dish! It's delicious.
I sauteed the asparagus with the mushrooms, and added 2 cloves of minced garlic.  I also used the garlic & herb boursin cheese.  I had read the reviews which said the sauce was thin, so I dissolved 1 tsp of cornstarch in 1/3 cup of white wine and that thickened it up quite nicely.  I was out of shells so I used angel hair pasta instead.  
This meal was yummy, super-satisfying, looked great and my kids ate it.  What else can I ask for?

Oh my! This is excellent! It was a bad shopping day - my grocery store was out of asparagus and did not have the pepper Boursin cheese, so I sub'ed in Garlic & Herb Boursin and broccoli. A great meal!

Mmmm, this is delicious! I used light Garlic and Herb Boursin cheese (I tried the pepper variety last Christmas, and REALLY didn't like it) and also added a couple of minced garlic cloves. This is super easy, quick and very elegant! Thanks so much, Jasmine!

I loved this.  I added some diced ham because my husband wants MEAT on his plate in some form.  Didn't have shells, so I used penne.  As others did, I cup up the asparagus and sauted it with the mushrooms.  I used crimini mushrooms (which are really just small portobellos) because Trader Joe's sells them cheap!  Also used garlic & herb boursin (also from TJs) because I couldn't find the pepper flavored kind.  Will definately make again and I'll be on the look-out for the pepper cheese.  The cheese was not expensive at all.  Very good recipe.

This was a big hit at our Friday night family dinner. Because we have to serve 8, I used 1 1/2 pounds of mushrooms, a pound of pasta shells, one can of vegetable broth and 2 bags of select asparagus spears. I also used 2 containers (4.4 oz) of the light garlic & herb boursin cheese. The result was wonderful. It tasted very much like a rich mushroom stroganoff. It is not terribly attractive--it looks pretty much like the picture shown. But everyone liked it & requested that we add it to our regular rotation. While I was making it, the sauce looked very thin but once it was added to the pasta, it was great--just the right amount and not thin at all. I will make this again--by popular demand.

Wow, this was DELICIOUS!! I can't wait to make this for friends, they'll think I'm the gourmet cook that I wish I was! I chopped up the asparagus and that was great because you could get a bit with every bite. Next time I'm making double the recipe because it was sooo good for lunch the next day but there wasn't enough!

My husband & mother both 'raved' about this!  They said it was just like eating in a fancy restaurant!  I used Garlic & Herb Bourisn cheese, could not find the Pepper.  Would definitely make this again.  Fantastic!  I would add more asparagus, just because I love it!

Wow, very nice...even with the few modifications I made. Mixed a quarter pound white shrooms with 12 oz Portabella, added some Parmesan cheese plus about 1 cup of diced cooked chicken and 1 cup of prawns. Asparagus wasn't on sale, so I used one of the "Top Ten Healthy Foods" from this site....broccoli.  I used about a cup of diced red and white onion also.  It was superb!!!!!!  Next time I only added garlic and onion, plus using Rondele as well as Boursin Lite with a whole can of garlic broth (wanted more sauce).  It's sooooooooo good.

This was a very simple and delicious recipe! I added garlic to the mushrooms and cooked together with the asparagus, and created my own Boursin cheese by using low-fat cream cheese and adding dashes of tyme, basil and oregano to the sauce. Yummy!!!

I've seen Boursin cheese in my local grocery store for $6.99 so I can see why people say it's pricey. If you have one near you I recommend going to Trader Joe's. Their Boursin is only around $3 and they usually have some reasonably priced portobellos and asparagus to go with it.

Pretty bland. Yes an easy recipe, but defintly not gourmet or resturant quiality. I added chopped asparagus with the mushrooms and two cloves of chopped garlic. After cooking i defintly needed to add a few scoops of cornstarch to thicken. Even after adding the garlic and some parmesean cheese i still found this quite bland.... it would be good if you enjoy generic alfredo type pastas. I'll save my boursin for something better!

Delicious! Super easy to make and tastes like something you'd order in a restaurant. It's a perfect quick and easy tasty dinner if you don't mind the cost (the Boursin is almost $7 in my supermarket and asparagus and portabellos are never cheap).

I was looking for something to do with asparagus, mushrooms, and pasta and this came up.  I didn't have boursin so I used 4 triangles of Laughing Cow Creamy Swiss and a few Tbls of cream cheese because that is what I had.  I let the sauce come to a boil and it thickened right up.  I added garlic powder and a little parm. for flavor since I wasn't using red pepper boursin.  Everyone was happy.  Oh I served it with chicken breasts that I seasoned with "Essence"  sauteed in a pan with butter and olive oil.

I REALLY enjoyed this! We even had seconds, which is a rarity in my house. The flavors that the Boursin cheese adds to the dish is just wonderful. When I made the dish I had just run out of mushrooms - if I enjoy it so much without the mushrooms, I can only imagine how much better it would be with the addition of the mushrooms. Thanks for sharing this recipe, I would have never thought to use Boursin in a cream sauce.

This was good, average.  The sauce was indeed very light, and I even cut down on the broth.  I would recommend reducing the broth more before adding the cheese.  The cheese melts quickly and becomes very thin when mixed with the broth.  I made mine with chicken as well.

This was absolutely delicious! My husband, a regular meat and potato guy, keeps asking me to make it again! I followed the recipe to the "T" and can't think of any way to improve it except to make the sauce a little thicker by not adding so much broth. Yum!

This was pretty good.  Seemed to be missing something though.  I used the garlic & herb Boursin and also added some cream cheese to try and make it a bit creamier.  I'll try it again for sure but probably doctor it up a little.

I had high expectations for this  based on the reviews but was let down. My sauce turned out too thin, even after I added cornstarch. Was the broth supposed to be added to the mushrooms early so that they would suck up the juice and the broth would reduce? It wasn't clear in the recipe, so I added the broth at the same time that I added the cheese, so maybe that was the problem. I also added garlic to the sauce, and used the Boursin Red Pepper cheese, but I still found it a little bland. If I make this again, I'll try the Boursin garlic and herb and maybe a larger less expensive version, and less broth or reduced broth.

This recipe is simple, perhaps one of the quickest on this site (and I have made quite a few) and delicious.  As it is written, I believe it's a tad high in fat, so I made it twice - once as written and once reducing the fat content.  Both tasted phenomenal.  As written, I would still give it a 5, but for my continual use,  and lower fat content, I eliminated the butter, added a bit more olive oil and the mushrooms browned fine.  I also agree that "lite" boursin is fine, but I DID like the cracked pepper version, WITH the addition of some fresh herbs and of course garlic.  Using the full fat strength boursin is quite high in fat. Very good, very easy and any version of pasta is acceptable.  We are gluten free and I used the penne I had in the closet.  Thanks for a keeper of a recipe.

this was super easy and didn't take long at all.  i did make a few alterations to make it more to my taste.  i sauteed a chopped onion with some garlic before adding the mushrooms (onion + garlic always equals delicious).  I added one additional large mushroom cap and used one container of 6.5 ounce alouette garlic and herb cheese because i couldn't find the boursin cheese in the size requested in the recipe.  The sauce did seem a bit thin, but after i mixed in the pasta it thickened nicely and was delicious!!  

Everyone love it and this recipe is definitely a keeper.

I quick recipe that seems like you spent a long time. I don't like asparagus, so I used broccoli.  Also, I always scrape the gills out of Portobello mushrooms since I find they discolour what they're cooked with.

This was a great, easy recipe!  The only things that I changed were the pasta shells to Rotini shells (that is what I had on hand), and I sliced the cleaned asparagus into 1 inch pieces. The sauce was thin at first, but after it was mixed with the hot pasta, it was either absorbed or thickened. No problem with the coloring either.  I would suggest the portobello mushrooms be cooked through and even browned a bit before adding the cheese and chicken stock.  The cracked pepper boursin is peppery (hence the name), but the pepper suits this dish.

This is a keeper.  I used the Herb & Garlic boursin cheese and thickened the sauce a bit and also added a touch of wine for extra flavor.  I also cut the asparagus into bite size pieces. I used this as a side dish and it was a huge hit.  I will definately make it again for our next family gathering.....I can hardly wait to have it again.

While it makes me crazy when people rate these recipes 5 stars and then go through all the changes they made to get to five stars, I must admit I made a couple changes to this recipe....and it was fantastic! SO, here goes: instead of mushrooms (because my kids really don't care for them), I sauteed chicken in the butter and olive oil. I used a full pound of pasta, 2 cups of broth and two bricks of garlic herb Boursin (because we love it!). Here's a tip for those who think Boursin is too expensive - - Costco sells it for $5.88 for two boxes, which is less than what most grocery stores sell just one box for.

Great recipe!!

With every bite my husband had a comment -- "this is good -- this is really good -- this is excellent"!  I asked if he would like me to put this recipe with my favorites and he said "absolutely"!! I agree with him 100%!!  Will definitely serve again and again.  This dish would also be suitable for company -- it would score a big hit! Easy to prepare as well.  Thank you Jasmine for sharing this fine recipe!

I am a harsh critic but I have to say (with a few adjustments) this recipe is a huge hit! Adjustments are as follows:
1:Get the "herb & garlic" Boursin cheese
2: Use a little cornstarch and water to thicken the sauce before you mix in your pasta.
It is so hearty yet so light at the same time. The flavour is full but not strong. This one is a five star keeper!

I really love pretty much anything with mushrooms, so I was excited to find this recipe. I just made it for supper tonight and it was delicious. I followed the recipe exactly except for substituting the garlic and herb Boursin cheese. I also added some garlic to the mushrooms while they were cooking. 

My only complaint about the whole thing is that I wish the sauce was a bit thicker. Will cut down on the chicken broth next time and maybe add some more cheese of sometime. Will definitely make again.

We followed this recipe to a T and we did not care for it. I make homemade alfredo and was expecting this to be creamy and saucy, but it was bland and dry. What a waste of boursin cheese.

I thought it was really good but could use a little more spice.  I sauteed asparagus and really enjoyed the flavor and texture. I used Veg broth instead of chicken.  I did add more garlic. Next time, I will add more garlic and maybe some sun dried tomatoes.  Great recipe to work with. Makes alot and we did enjoy very much.

This is delicious.  Prepared as directed except that I sauteed minced garlic with the mushrooms.  Asparagus has the perfect amount of crispness when prepared as directed.  Even my husband, who generally dislikes creamy sauces, loved it.

Sooooo good!  Instead of making it with the pasta and asparagus, I made the sauce, using 1/2 the amount of chicken broth and 3/4 of the package of boursin cheese to make it a little thicker.  Then I seasoned and baked chicken breasts and put the mushroom boursin sauce on top.  I also made some mashed potatoes and grilled the asparagus.  AMAZING!  My husband is an executive chef and he said it put him in a "food buzz"!  Definitely a gourmet recipe!

This was very good. I made mine using vegetable broth, (vegetarian daughter) and used tortellini. Cannot get enough cheese. I buy the 3 pk of Boursin @ Costo for about $7 and use it all of the time. I threw in some fresh spinach leaves at the end. A hearty crusty bread and salad rounded this out nicely. I can see adding some grilled chicken or thin sliced left over sirloin to satisfy the meat eaters.

Yum! This is like a super quick mac n cheese. I made this to clear out the fridge and so subbed quartered cherry tomatoes (cooked with the mushrooms) for the asparagus. Also added one green onion, one clove of garlic, and a little crushed red pepper. Turned out great!

This dish needs something but I can't put my finger on what. My sauce turned out very, very thin even after I tossed the pasta; I drained some of the excess liquid but this did compromise the intensity of the flavour. This is still tasty, but a little boring.

Yum! This was delicious! I love how easily adaptable it is. You can use more or less of the mushrooms and aspargus to fit your taste and use whatever flavor of Boursin cheese that strikes you. I also think it would make a great sauce for steak and/or chicken -- eliminate the aspargus and pasta and reduce the chicken stock (to 1/2 cup maybe?) and you have an awesome (and easy) portobello mushroom sauce. Great recipe!

This recipe is pretty good. I used vegetable broth and did not add the salt until the end because I did not know how savoury the broth and Boursin cheese would already be. The sauce may seem too watery at first but it will thicken after you remove it from the heat.

I used the light boursin and low sodium chicken broth (about 1/4cup less than what it called for, but I wish I had only put in about 1/2cup altogether) w/ baby portobello mushrooms, and whole wheat penne pasta. Even my mushroom hating daughter liked this dish.

Wow, this was an awesome side dish!  We love anything with mushrooms, so I am always trying to come up with new ways to use them.  I followed a lot of other reviewers advice and sauteed the chopped asparagus with sliced baby portabella mushrooms, along with 2 cloves of garlic.  I used the garlic and herb Boursin cheese, and thickened the sauce with some white wine and cornstarch.  I topped the dish with fresh grated Parmesan cheese and crushed red pepper flakes...it was sooooo good!

Because we like thicker sauces, I added 1T of flour to the sauce while it as cooking. I wont add so much next time- too thick, and the coloring was not attractive. Any ideas how to make it look as good as it taste?

This was excellent - the sauce looked a little thin, so I heated the pasta in it for about 5 minutes, which helped absorb some of the sauce and flavored the pasta - will definitely make again!  Thank you!

Very yummy in an understated way.  The boursin flavor is not very strong, but the resulting dish is still delicious.  Like some other reviewers, I used the garlic and herb boursin as I don't like the cracked pepper boursin.  However, after tasting the sauce, I did add some cracked pepper.  I cut the asparagus into pieces and mixed it with the sauce.  Other reviewers complained the sauce was thin so I added a teaspoon of flour as I was sauteeing the mushrooms.  The sauce still was a bit thin, but if you let it sit for about 5 minutes after mixing in the pasta, it thickens right up.  We served this as a main dish, and found the taste a little too mild but both my husband and I agreed this would be a really phenomenal side dish.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very easy and extremely delicious! Instead of serving the asparagus separately, after I blanched it, I chopped it up and added it to the dish. Also, don't think that the sauce will be too thin....it thickens when you add the pasta.

Very flavorful recipe, however, the color of the meal really turned my family off.  I encouraged them to have at least have one bite and they liked it.  I think that if I make it again I would you regular old button mushrooms because the portabellas colored the sauce an unappealing grayish/brown color.

Overall this recipe had very nice flavor.  I agree with some of the other comments that the sauce was too thin.  I was lucky enough to have found fresh wild Morel Mushroom where I live, so I added those along with Cremini Mushrooms ( baby Portobello's) to the dish.  Also cut asparagus into smaller pieces.  I made my own Boursin cheese ( MUCH CHEAPER and just as good) which consisted of 8 oz. cream cheese, 8 oz. cottage cheese, 2 Tbsp. butter, 1/2 tsp. Dillweed,Garlic Powder,onion powder, oregano,thyme and 1/4 tsp. salt and black pepper.  I added afew fresh herbs form my garden and alittle fresh garlic for kick.  Process in food processor til light and the consistancy of Ricotta.  refrig. 8 hrs. for the flavors to blend.
This Boursin recipe makes more than enough to try this recipe with plenty leftover.
Worth trying again with afew minor adjustments.

This was great!  I made it just as the recipe reads, except I used white button mushrooms because I didn't have any portabello mushrooms around, and I will certainly make it again.  Delicious.  It is quite peppery, which I love, but if pepper isn't your thing, this recipe may not be quite what you're looking for :)

Boursin cheese was on sale at my local grocery and i remembered seeing this recipe. Alas i forgot the asparagus, but i had shrooms. I did tweak the sauce is why i only gave it 4 stars. I added dried shallots and a couple of spoonfuls of sour cream. I also let the broth reduce by about half. My hubby and i both enjoyed it. Warning, if you don't like pepper, use another flavor of Boursin b/c it is peppery!

This was good, but needed something... garlic?, salt?, white wine?.  Would make again, but would play with the recipe.  ALso, for so few ingredients, this recipe is pricey.

I neglected to check to make sure that I had all the ingredients before cooking. Despite the lack of correct ingredients, I produced a delicious meal by modifying it slightly. First, instead of asparagus, i used broccoli. Second, i discovered we had no chicken stock so i substituted veggie broth. Third, we are not really big fans of cheese so I substituted a 1/2 can of cream of mushroom soup to help the sauce thicken and maybe 1/2 tsp of corn starch. Everything else remained the same. Very please with the finished product. Very tasty. I added some fresh ground pepper to give it a kick. I look forward to using this recipe again when I have the proper ingredients.

This is one of our new favorite dishes!  I did make some subs based on other reviews, but it really is amazing and really easy to make.  I use an 8ounce tub of veggie cream cheese (extra sauce is always good, right!) and have done with and without broccoli instead of asparagus.  I add some parsley, red pepper flakes, minced garlic, and garlic powder to the sauce once it starts simmering plus about a teaspoon or 2 of cornstarch to thicken it up.  My husband asks for this about once a week now!

I changed the Boursin to Herb and Garlic (instead of Pepper) like others and changed to vegetable broth, because I'm vegetarian. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly and it was fantastic! My non-vegetarian friends, husband and daughter (toddler!) liked it as well.

Delicious, but I will cut the asparagus spears next time, they were very unwieldy.  We also used 3 tbsp butter instead of the oil, and deglazed the mushrooms with 1/4 cup of Burgundy.

It was pretty bland, maybe could have used a thicker sauce, but it was very good! We'll make it again - maybe adding some extra cream cheese, which we used instead of boursin cheese (lots of herbs added, of course)

This is a delicious recipe, except that I used an 8 oz block of creach cheese instead of the boursin, melting it into the mushrooms, also adding a clove of garlic and some fresh parsley to add a bit more flavor.  Absolutely delicious!

This was very good and I will likely make it again, with the following adjustments . . . I used a garlic-herb cheese spread in lieu of the Boursin, I sautéed the asparagus (1.25 lbs) with the mushrooms, I added a generous amount of ground black pepper and a bit of crushed red pepper, I cut the broth to 1 cup, and I added a few ounces of diced ham. YUM!

I couldn't find the "pepper" Boursin cheese but they had one with garlic and herbs which tasted great.  At first I thought the sauce was too thin, but the pasta really soaks it up.  I saved the rest of the chicken broth and added that to leftovers the next day to moisten.  I used presliced baby portobello mushrooms because they were on sale and that turned out great too.  This is a definite keeper.   Great flavor especially for a meatless dish.  We sprinkled with grated parmesan.  I think  you could use the Laughing Cow cheese wedges too for this if you can't fine the Boursin cheese.

Very good and I will now use this for other vegetables too. I added the broth until it was a consistency I liked, but did not use all of it. The mushrooms gave off a lot of water while cooking.

Added the chopped garlic.  Made with low fat veggie cream cheese instead of boursin.  Served with Viogier.  Added the asparagus for 3 minutes instead of 5 minutes.  Fresh parmesan on top of pasta dish.  Excellent company food.

Well, this was a fabulous success OR as Tim Gunn would say, "Major WOW factor." I cooked this easy feasty for my folks who ranted and raved about it. What a fast, simple recipe, no mess, no fuss recipe -- what more can you ask for? If you like tasting your food, you'll like tasting this. My dad said he could taste every ingredient shining in radiant deliciousness ... well, not in those words exactly...

This was just okay.  I followed the recipe exactly and thought it lacked flavor.  If I were to make it again I would saute the mushrooms in garlic and oil and add more salt and a tbsp of black pepper.  Better yet, I would just stick with a beef stroganoff and add some asparagus to it.

Not too bad. The mushrooms didnt taste like much though. Just had an olive oil flavor. Next time I'll saute them with garlic.

What I love about this is that it holds up GREAT for left overs. I ate this 3 days in a row and it was just as good the third day as it was when it was fresh off the stove top! An essential quality when you are cooking for one! I put a sprinkle of parmesan on top.

Quick and easy. I have made this 3 times now, and actually prefer making it with the Herb and Garlic Boursin, not the pepper Boursin, but both are quite tasty. I made it almost exactly as the recipe states, with the only adjustment being the Herb and Garlic boursin, and I use less portobello mushrooms, because they can be expensive.

This was really good! I tried to make the sauce while the pasta water was heating up. It was runny so i reduced it and added a little cornstarch. Really good!  I used light  boursin because that is what i had. I think the sauce would go great on chicken :)

I have been making this recipe for years. I use the lite boursin and substitute broccoli when asparagus isn't in season. I usually add some sliced grilled chicken just before serving as well. I also add some cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  This is the only way I can get the hubby to eat asparagus.

I sooo want to give this recipe 5 stars because the flavor is that good... but the sauce is too thin.  Delicious, but too thin.  I'd use less broth or thicken with cornstarch the next time.  I sauteed the asparagus pieces with the mushrooms (used baby bellas) and garlic.  Whoever recommended getting the cheese at Trader Joe's was smart - it's half the price!

This recipe was good, but I expected much more from the rave reviews. Several times I read the words "restaurant quality" but I don't think this dish even comes close to that. It is quick and tasty to be sure, but 5 stars it is not. Still, I'll probably make it again when I need something fast.  Thanks for sharing!

This was very bland tasting to me. Normally I don't boil vegetables because it pulls all of the vitamins and flavors out of the veggie. Next time (if) I make this I will sautee the asparagus as other reviewers mentioned.

This was very good and I'll be making it again. I almost gave it 4 stars, because the sauce was soupy at first, but it was easy to fix. I added a little bit of Wondra Quick Mix flour and it thickened nicely. I used the shallot & chives flavor of Boursin.

This was really wonderful and so quick to make!  I agree that it is something I would be very satisfied ordering in a restaurant.  I had three leftover chicken breasts to use so I cut them up and added to this recipe.  I used Philadelphia Cracker Spreads Parmesan with Garlic and Herbs.  It added a rich taste and a great texture when melting with the broth.  I added canned chunky Portabllo mushrooms because I did not have any fresh and it didn't matter, they tasted wonderful (just drained and sauteed with a little butter to start the recipe off).  I added a dash of garlic salt to season the sauce and poured it over angel hair pasta.  Everyone loved this and I literally spent only ten minutes in preparation.

Very good, I also added green unopened orange day lily's very nice.  They taste like a cross between asparagus and green-beans.  Was kinda fun since they are growing everywhere.

Thisi was very good!  I used regular boursin, not the pepper as I don't like it.  Boursin was a good price at Trader Joe's and I really think it has a much better flavor than cream cheese, so I'd definitely stick with it!  I subbed broccoli for the asparagus but I can't wait to try it with the asparagus when it's in season!  I will definitely make this again!  My only complaint was I wished there was more sauce; probably my fault though-based on other reviews, I cut the broth to 3/4 cup and then let it simmer down for awhile with the mushrooms before I added the cheese.  The mushrooms gave the broth great flavor but maybe next time I'll start with the listed amount of broth so that there is more left after it reduces.

Delish!! Easy to make, too!  I did like some other reviewers, and minced 3 cloves of garlic (I really like garlic!) to saute with the mushrooms, and I subbed veggie cream cheese for the Boursin ($2 for cream cheese on sale versus $6.99 for Boursin... hmmm?).  Also, I have a combination pasta pot/steamer, so I was able to steam the asparagus rather than boil it.  And the husband and I loved it!!  I've also made it with the Boursin, and while it's still yummy, the cream cheese is just as good, and less expensive.

Ehh...Tasted like many other mushroom-based pasta sauces.  I agree with the other comments stating that this was a waste of boursin.  If I ever make it again, I'll just use veggie cream cheese.

I made this dish tonight and was quite satisfied with it. I wouldn't call it a fancy dish at all, but something you could serve any night of the week. However, I did make quite a few modifications to the recipe. I used two tablespoons of margarine instead of butter (had none), left out the salt, used button mushrooms and brocoli instead of asparagus and portobello mushrooms, skipped out on the boursin (i personally find it a waste for $7) and used a combination of cheez whiz, sour cream, a few vegetable spreadable triangles, and garlic butter to make the sauce. The sauce came out quite light/thin, but I think it'll thicken/taste better when I serve the leftovers for lunch tomorrow. I would definitely make this again, and try it without the modifications!

Even after doubling the sauce, there was way too much pasta in this dish.  It has potential, but as is, it's not outstanding.

I wanted to get a main dish out of this so I opted to add some cooked, chopped chicken.  The result was very good although if using a full package of dry pasta (I chose to use penne) I would recommend doubling the sauce.  Boursin cheese is quite pricey so this makes for a pretty expensive main course.  For this reason it is probably best as a side.  I liked the idea of some of the other reviewers of thickening up the sauce a bit.  I used some dry sherry and about 1 Tbsp. cornstarch just to give it a little body.  Great flavor.

I made this using a garlic & herb boursin. I also added some spinach and black pepper. I replaced the chicken broth for vegetable broth. I noticed that the sauce was not thick and very watery from the broth. I was able to make it a perfect consistency by adding 1 tablespoon of corn starch (pre-mixed in a little bit of cold water so it wouldn't clump up). This was amazing and my boyfriend finished his entire plate... I didn't... it's a heavy dish!! We loved it though! Great recipe!

This recipe was a little bland for us.  Also the sauce was pretty watery...  Needs less chicken broth.  My 2-year-old loved the noodles and sauce, though.

YUM!  I used garlic Boursin cheese, regular white mushrooms with the stems removed and thin asparagus.  I also used bowtie pasta.  This is so flavorful, the cheese really makes the dish.  I'm not sure where everyone is buying their cheese for it to be so pricey but I got mine at a large chain organic market with a big cheese section and it was only $3.29.  Thanks for the great recipe!

It was delicious, very peppery. The only thing I didn't like is that the sauce was too watery, I like the sause when it sticks on the food.

This was yummy.  I used 1 1/2 containers of the Boursin herb cheese with a little extra broth.  I threw in a little extra asparagus and a package of pre-cooked chicken strips.  Very good!  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this last night and thought something was missing.  I think 1 cup of dry white wine will add a bit more sweetness rather than just the chicken broth and maybe add some prosciutto to punctuate the dish.  It wasn't that expensive for me because portobello mushroom and Boursin were on sale @ HEB; just have to  look out for sales.

This recipe was not as good as I was expecting it to be based on the reviews.  I love boursin cheese but was not wild about it's combination with pasta.  A few changes I made were to chop the asparagus and saute it with the mushrooms and I used champaigne mushrooms and garlic and herb boursin.  I think if I made this again, I would try to find something to thicken the sauce a bit.  The leftovers the next day seemed to have lost their cheesy flavor.

Great recipe! I added 2 cloves of minced garlic, one red pepper, diced, and changed the boursin to the garlic-herb one. I will also make this with a bit of chicken when we don't want a vegetarian entree. Delicious!

I also used the garlic boursin cheese and broccoli ......I thought it was so easy to make and it was really tasty.  I made it and let it rest in a covered pan. The starch from the pasta helped to make the sauce thicker.  No need to add anything to make the sauce thicker. I think it would be easy to substitute any vegetables that you like.  I would serve this as a side dish for company as an alternative for potatoes. Very easy, inexpensive, and delicious.

Pretty good. I think I needed more cheese. I added some sour cream at the end and also some shrimp. I didn't have asparagus but broccoli was perfect. Very creamy and filling.

I made this with some changes. I added shredded, boneless/skinless chicken thighs, extra garlic and garlic salt, baby spinach and baby bella mushrooms. I used the garlic and herb Boursin cheese (2 packages), and I used rotini pasta. I didn't do asparagus because the store didn't have any good looking stock. It turned out delicious.

I did use a recipe for a substitute for the boursin with cream cheese (would have had the same seasoning as the herb flavored one).  I also used a whole pound of shells.  I can't imagine it being as good with the pepper flavored boursin, however.  We all loved this dish!  My husband asked me to make this often and my 7-year-old son was pretty happy about getting seconds!

So, second time making this, I used the boursin cheese (herb flavored one) and it wasn't nearly as good as using the substitute recipe I had found. When I used the substitute, there ended up being a lot more herbs in the dish than with the boursin and that made a huge difference.  I will still say this is a 5-star though.

Served this at a dinner party as a side dish with grilled lamb chops and it was a big hit.  I substituted the shells with Campanella and chopped the asparagus and added it to the pasta.  Delish!

This was easy and delicious.  I used cream cheese as I didn't boursin cheese, added garlic, onions, leftover diced chicken breast and a lot more mushrooms, I use a little milk and flour to thicken it too.  Yum, yum, quick and easy!

My family loved this dish!  Ridiculously easy to make!  I served it with sliced chicken tenderloin.  Sauce was a little on the thin side - may boil down a bit more next time and/or add a bit of constarch.  The mushrooms make the dish.  Last thing: consder cutting up the asparagus and saute with mushrooms.  WINNER DISH!

i intended on using the garlic & herb boursin, but i could only find the pepper. however, i was very pleased with the outcome! i doubled the amount of pasta to ensure enough servings, and i had more than enough. the sauce was there, but not overbearing. i also cut the asparagus into bite-size pieces and threw it in with the pasta (boiled without asparagus for 8 minutes) for 3 minutes, and everything was the perfect texture. the pepper cheese was not too peppery, but overall the recipe needed some salt. and my last tweak, i used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth (vegetarian!) a very good recipe overall.

This dish is wonderful. 

We made two simple and probably insignificant changes. We only had 3/4 pound of asparagus; I chose the recipe to use the rest of a bundle of asparagus from a previous dinner. And we keep kosher, so we used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth.

We plan to make two changes to our execution of the recipe next time we use it: a full pound of asparagus, since we'll buy it specifically for this dish, and a little less broth, I'm not sure how much.

Thanks to Jasmine for posting her friend Taneem's recipe!

This is an amazing dish! I didn't add the salt and it still turned out really well.  I cook the asparagus in a Ziploc Steamer bag in the microwave for about a minute and a half, then just stir it into the sauce & pasta (I prefer my asparagus really crunchy).  This is absolutely delicious.

I'm glad I tried making this dish, but it wasn't quite as good as I was hoping. It was tasty, but lacked that wow factor that everyone else seems to be raving about. All in all, not bad, but not something I'd go out of my way to make again.

Delicious! I got lots of compliments on it, easy recipe to follow and make-  just had to be a little extra and added shiitake mushrooms as well, we had it with steak- as if meaty mushrooms were not enough lol

Yummy and easy!  Love that it doesn't dirty many dishes b/c you cook the asparagus and pasta in the same pot.  I used cream cheese and it turned out fine!

Only thing I changed was Chicken instead of Asparagus.  Not bad but everyone in my family only said 3 stars which I agreed with...next time instead of following the submitted recipe, I'll try the notes that other members posted (like using herb Boursin instead of peppercorn).

I think it needs a bit more sauce to enhance the texture and flavor but it was definitely a hit with me. I love the mushrooms and I had never cooked with Boursin cheese before. Delicious!

Pretty good quick dinner!  i've had this one saved in my recipe box since August 2005 so I figured it's about time I give it a try.  I suggest cutting back on the broth because the sauce was just too watery.  I ended up doubling up on the Boursin to make the sauce creamer which didn't make it too salty.  Pretty good, but makes a ton, so I have lunch for 2 or 3 days next week!

This is a great option for a "creamy" pasta dish that is still light. I used the light garlic and herb boursin cheese b/c it is significantly lower in fat than the pepper cheese and it was wonderful - I just added plenty of my own fresh ground pepper. I also added a pound of diced chicken, 1/2 cup chopped onions, and 2 cloves of garlic prior to sauteeing the mushrooms. I threw in about 1/3 cup of white wine too. I cut up the asparagus into bite size pieces and threw them into the boiling water w/the pasta. Before serving I also added some red pepper flakes for an added kick - delicious! I'm definitely adding this to my rotation - it's a great meal that you would never guess is relatively guilt free (as long as you use the light boursin of course).

It5 just do happened that I had bought 3 packages of Boursin that I neded to use. I ended up usng two and a half for this dish! It was very good but to make it more flavourful you really need more boursin than stated.

The dish was tasty and easy to cook! I don't think it needs more garlic if you use the Garlic Boursin cheese.

The sauce was very thin which is not what I expected. The recipe was bland. If I try it again I will probably add garlic and reduce the chicken broth to 3/4 cup.

My BF and I liked this as a base recipe.  We made a few changes to suit our tastes.  Firstly we didn't use Boursin cheese.  Instead we used JL Kraft Specialty Gourmet Spreadable cheese, Parmesan, Asiago and Romano with Garlic and Herbs flavor.  After we got the sauce together (I only used 1 cup of broth) it was still a little bit too liquidy so I added a Tbs of cornstarch to 1/8 c. of chicken broth, whisked it together and worked it into the sauce.  We also added about a half pound of shrimp and two slices of Jalapeno Cheese for added flavor.  It was really good.  I don't know if it's because we didn't use Boursin but it lacked enough flavor for us without the Jalapeno cheese.  I know it sounds super weird but I swear it tasted good.  :)

Such a wonderful recipe!!  Very easy to make.  I also used Garlic & Herb boursin b/c it blends so much better with the vegetables.  The only sub I have made is that after the first time making this dish I have started cooking the portobello's seperately as they tend to turn the entire sauce a "dirty brown." shade

This is a yummy yummy yummy and simple recipe.  I too used the garlic herb Boursin as I could not find the other.  Although the combo of asparagus and shroom is aweseom, you could add just about anything and I think this would be awesome.  Thanks for the super simple and yumilicious recipe!

I sauted the asparagus with the mushrooms and added pepper and garlic to taste. I also used garlic and herb Boursin cheese. There was definately more pasta then needed so I plated the pasta and added the sauce to each plate. The flavor was there but I wish the sauce was thicker. May add cornstarch next time. We all cleared our plates!

Other than doubling the sauce, I stuck to the recipe. It was pretty boring. To eat it I had to keep squirting it with my no cal. buttery spray and sprinkling it with parm. cheese. Now I have a huge batch left over with no takers.

I and my boyfriend (a chief) thought this was great!  I used the less expensive garlic and herb spreadable cheese.  I also cut the asparagus up into pieces and tossed it in the mix.  A great meal, and a perfect side dish to chicken or steak!

This was ridiculously delicious, and also really easy. If i can make it, it's easy, trust me. I also bought the garlic boursin instead of the pepper, and it worked great.

This was a pretty tasty recipe and I imagine it would be even better if made according to "specs". I'm vegetarian so I used Not Chikn Broth. And because my Kroger didn't have Boursin cheese, I used chive and herb cream cheese. Very good dish....lends itsself well to adaptation.

This was SO GOOD!  And a huge hit with some of the other kids in the dorms here.  I did use cream cheese and some extra black pepper instead of Boursin cheese, only because the commissary here doesn't have Boursin.  Also used bowties instead of shells, and cut the asparagus into 1 inch pieces instead of leaving it long.  I was eating this for lunch at the gates for 2 days- the leftovers were just as good as when I first made it!

This was a great vegetarian meal!  I also used the Garlic and Herbs flavor of the Bourin cheese.  Next time I might substitute a little of the broth for some white wine.  

Also, I used Quinoa pasta which is very healthy.  It is very tasty pasta and worked well in this dish.  Husband and I both loved this recipe.  Will defnitely keep this in my book!

This was a wonderful and simple dish. I changed the recipe a bit and used 4 oz of pepper jack cheese instead (that is what I aleady had on hand) and only half a batch since it was just for two people.

SO GOOD!!  I used cream cheese rather than the Boursin, and could taste it, but it was still amazing!!  I used whole wheat pasta to get some fiber.  Will make it again as an indulging meal!

This was great with some shaved parmesan on top.  I also have the same complaint as others, the sauce was too watery.  It's definitely worth making again though, we'll just try thickening the sauce next time.

A good recipe that is very easy to make.  I used garlic and herb boursin cheese based on other reviewers' recommendations.  I also added some minced garlic to the skillet.  But, to be honest, the cheese sauce was still a bit bland.  My husband didn't detect any garlic flavor at all when I told him what was in the sauce.  I had to add flour to the sauce to make it thicker - it was pretty runny.

I enjoyed this recipe, but I don't think I will make it again.  It was o.k. as a side dish, but it was a bit overpowering with the mushroom taste.  It is a costly recipe, and perhaps not worth it.  I must mention that I am not the ultimate pasta fan, so please take that into consideration.  It cost almost $6.00 for the mushrooms and another $5.00+ just for the Boursin cheese.  The pepper cheese just gave it a nice spiciness.  I love pepper!  Perhaps a little garlic would give it a little more oomph...

It is an easy recipe though but not the nicest looking pasta dish to serve.  Everything takes on the mushroom color.

I couldn't find the boursin cheese so added a different type of cheese and I wouldn't recommend it.  Somehow we salvaged the meal and it was very good.

This was a great quick recipe! My husband loved it. I used pepper jack cheese instead.
