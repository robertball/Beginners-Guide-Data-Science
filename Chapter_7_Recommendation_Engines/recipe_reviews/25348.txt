I made this recipe in my Kitchen Aid mixer. I proofed the yeast in my mixer bowl with the warm water and sugar for ten minutes, then added the remaining ingredients. I used whole wheat white flour and I did not add the full amount of salt, a heaping teaspoon was plenty for me. I kneaded the dough with the dough hook for five minutes (this dough did need a little more flour than what was called for to get the dough to form a solid ball and stop sticking to the bottom of the mixer bowl), then set it to rise for an hour in a greased, covered bowl. After it doubled, I formed rolls using my 1/3 cup measuring cup and plopped them into greased muffin tins, covered it with saran wrap and let them double again. Baked at 400*, these were done in just under 14 minutes. I brushed them with oil straight out of the oven. GINORMOUS rolls. Really. They were huge. The flavor was very nice and the rolls were not too sweet but also fluffy and chewy.

I always wanted to try my hand at making rolls.  This recipie intrigued me.  I tried it and in all the 25 years of cooking for my wife and me, I came up with a great result on the first attempt.  Tasty, light, satisfying either with a meal or with cheese and wine, they are a hlt.  The best part is that it is healthy.  Looking forward to more or these recipies.  Thank you.

I adapted this for my bread machine and made it with all whole wheatflour, and it was pretty good.  Here is what I did, for anyone who is interested. First, I had to halve the recipe so it would fit in my machine. I used a little over a cup of warm water instead of using the boiling water. I used all whole wheat flour instead whole wheat and bread flour.  Then I just adding everything in the order suggested by my bread machine instructions, set it to the "dough" cycle, and then followed steps 4 and 5 from the recipe. The rolls turned out really tasty, light, and fluffy. :)

This is an amazing recipe.  I halved the recipe, used all whole wheat flour and made 6 larger sized sandwich buns.  I let them rise for almost two hours and they turned out great!  This is the only recipe I will ever use from now on for all my rolls and buns.  Will even try making loaves with it.  So light and full of flavor.  Thanks so much for sharing :)

I love the subtle flavor the olive oil adds to these light and tender wheat rolls.  I made the recipe exactly as stated using a high quality, first cold press olive oil, but I did halve the recipe.  The dough is sticky so expect to add about Â¼ cup of flour during the kneading process.

Fantastic! Very soft and fluffy. I really like that they are made with olive oil.  To make them even more nutritious, I did an even mix of whole wheat and white flour (i.e. 3cup/3cup); next time I will do 4c whole wheat and 2c white to see if that works.  Wonderful rolls!!!  My new favorite recipe.
UPDATE: I've had great results making these using 4c whole wheat / 2c white! Still very light and yummy.

This is a fabulous recipe. I halved the recipe, then made 6 large sandwich-size rolls instead of 12 dinner rolls. They were a touch dense, but nothing a little extra rising time for larger rolls wouldn't cure. My mistake. Anyway, the rolls were SO tasty all on their own, but with some pulled chicken and barbeque sauce, they were DIVINE! This is going in my recipe box.

Loved the flavor of these. The olive oil really stands out. I followed the recipe closely, only using all purpose for the bread flour. Nice texture and hearty. Perfect as soup/sandwich rolls. I made some as bread sticks as well, brushed with an egg wash and sprinkled with garlic salt and cornmeal. Those were the best. Thank you!

These are great! and healthy. Usually my family refuses to eat whole wheat, but they loved these rolls! However, when I covered the rolls with a damp cloth and set the timer, 40 minutes later they were only 3/4 of their previous size! I don't know what I did wrong- perhaps my house is too cold! So I preheated the oven to 400 for 1 minute, then turned it off. I put the rolls in the oven to continue rising for 20 minutes. After that they were perfect. We froze half for another time and ate the rest!

The rolls turned out ok, a little dense but the dough was very sticky and hard to work with, I will try to do this again but i would reduce the amount of olive oil.

Made these rolls 2 days in a row! My family loved them! There are just a couple of things I changed, I tried putting the damp towel over the rolls like the recipe suggests but the towel stuck to the rolls during the rising time. When I made them the second time I greased plastic wrap with olive oil and it worked perfectly! When I dissolved the yeast I made the water about a 115 degrees instead of the 110 the recipe calls for and the rolls raised up much better. These are just things that work better for me. I will definitely making these rolls many times for my family.

These were the softest, fluffiest wheat rolls ever!  I let them rise way longer than doubled in an oiled bowl first.  I formed the rolls by tucking them around and under to stretch the tops a little and put them in 9x5 glass casseroles, six rolls to each.  I let them rise for over an hour again.

Sugarmagnolia, if you didn't get them to rise it may have been that your water/olive oil mixture wasn't cool enough yet.  Too hot and it will kill the yeast.  I do encourage you to try this again. :)

I cut this in half because there is only the two of us.  This was very good.  I had to add a little more flour but this was so easy to make.  We really enjoyed them with the Italian sausage amd Tortellini soup from this sight.  I will diffently be making these for the Holidays.

I followed the recipe exact (except I added egg wash on the top). These buns were great. I was worried because the dough was very soft and sticky, even after adding about 2/3 cup flour during the kneading process. They turned out great though, except they didn't look perfectly round because they were hard to form due to the sticky dough. So four stars it is!

I made these for the first time the day before yesterday, for a memorial service for my mother in law. Not only was this the first time making this recipe, but my first time making rolls ever. My sister in law told me she had people asking if I cater and everywhere I turned people were raving about these. The first batch left me saying "ok, so it worked, but I don't know if I can do enough for the party. The second batch was easier and went much quicker and I was off on a mission. We bought two sets of back up/extra (1 dozen total) from a local store that makes fresh but never needed them, we had plenty with what I had made. People thought they had been professionally and purchased. 

My mother and my mother in law would have both been thrilled, and I can highly recommend this recipe!

These are good! I like that there are no dairy ingredients in this recipe. I do think the rolls are bit big, though. Next time I'll split this into 36 rolls.

These rolls came out awesome!! I used 3 cups whole wheat and 3 cups unbleached flour to start, but it was a little sticky, so I added more whole wheat flour (probably 3/4 - 1 cup.) I used my stand mixer to mix and knead.  I made 8 large sandwich (sub) rolls. I baked them for approximately 20 mins @ 350. I will make all of my own sub rolls from now on, and will use this for dinner rolls, too. I might try to leave out one eggs, as it tasted a little "eggy" to me.  Great recipe! Very easy!

Delicious! Very soft and tender. Didn't have quite enough olive oil, so used about 1/2 canola oil.

This was an exceptional easy recipe to prepare. My novice daughter made them and they were delicious...better than store bought! We even made some with just white bread flour and they, too, were delicious! We, both, will make them again and again!!!

I wasn't crazy about this recipe.  My husband liked them - he loves rolls.  I'd say this recipe is worth a try, but I don't know that I will make them again.

I love this recipe! We use for both dinner rolls and sandwich rolls. I only gave it four starts though, because as written, it is too bitter for my taste. I really think it needs just a tad more sugar. I half the recipe and use my kitchenaid to mix and knead. I use the full amount of sugar though, and it turns out great!

I halved this recipe and it still made 12 nice large buns for hamburgers or sandwiches.  I needed to add quite a bit more flour when kneading but the end result was still tender and soft.  I think they would be good formed into hotdog/sausage buns as well.  If I was making dinner rolls, they might be a bit large so make 48 from a full recipe instead of 24 (or 24 from a half recipe)
Its very easy because there is only one rise and I form them and rise them right on a silpat lined sheet, then just pop into the oven.  They bake quick too.

Beautiful rolls, these were light and airy, had an amazing flavor and disappeared in two days!  I love the single rise of this recipe so they're actually fairly quick to make!

I used them as dinner rolls and also as mini vegetarian/dessert calzone wrappers as well.  So good!

Love this -- relatively quick for yeast breads because there's only one rise.  I followed the recipe with the exception of adding vital wheat gluten -- about 2 tbsp.  It really helps get whole wheat flour to rise!  The rolls are quite large -- next time I will make half a recipe and still make 24 rolls. Delicious!  Thanks.

I also let my bread machine do the work. I did add in 1/2 tsp. minced fresh rosemary.

These were great! Rising time was almost double what was said (and I had them in a warm area) but other than that, they were a hit!

I cut the recipe to just 6 servings size and made 8 wonderful rolls.  I followed the recipe for the reduced size, but did use the 1/2 egg + 1 t. milk to make an egg wash to gently brush on each roll before baking and sprinkled on Traders Joe's Everything but the Bagel Sesame Seasoning Blend. I really love how these turned out , although I think I needed a bit more flour than suggested as the dough was very sticky. I could see making the rolls larger for use as Hamburger or Sandwich rolls.

I made this using half bread flour and half whole wheat and mixed it on the bread machine dough cycle. These taste wonderful fresh from the oven. They make a large enough roll to serve as sandwich buns. This is definitely going into the keeper file. Thanks!

Used Sarah Jos kitchen aid method . halved the recipe used 3 cups of whole wheat flour. If you use all whole wheat flour you don't need extra. perfect.

Came out well. Used all purpose flour instead of bread four. Mixed by hand. Made 18 large rolls instead of 24 smaller ones. Washed some egg on half and cracked salt over them, which was great. Will serve with olive oil and cracked pepper. Easy recipe, tasty rolls!

Not impressed with taste.  Agree with other reviews, too much liquid in recipe in comparison with flour.

Halved the recipe and used my Kitchen Aid mixer.  Needed another 1/2 cup or so of flour to get the dough to come together. I didn't have bread flour so I used regular all purpose flour.  Rose well, and roll was soft and fluffy but without any "pull" when torn -- almost like a super light biscuit.  It didn't brown easily and I wasn't crazy about the olive oil flavor.

They turned out well.  This recipe is a bit too large to be my daily choice. I used grape seed oil.  The dough was very sticky, added a little flour.  I had to wait too long for the water to cool enough for the yeast.  If i make this again I will start with nice warm water to dissolve the sugar and yeast, then add the other ingredients all in one bowl.  Not the MOST scrumptious rolls I've made, but very tasty.

I used bread machine to make the dough, using a half recipe only. The dough was pretty wet when it finished the dough cycle. I used more whole wheat flour on a board to knead into it to make it firm enough for me to shape it into balls. I baked them in silicone muffin tins at the time and temperature noted in the recipe. Overall we are happy with the result. Next time I will probably use an egg wash glaze prior to baking. The surface of today's batch seemed a bit grainy probably due to the extra flour I needed to get the dough into a shapeable consistency.

Delicious! I halved the recipe, used only 1 tsp salt, and used 1.5 cups whole wheat flour and 1.5 cups bread flour. I also added oatmeal grains to the tops of each rolls. This recipe is a keeper. :)

Followed recipe exactly until adding more flour to keep from getting too sticky - maybe a cup more total. Be prepared to raise in a very warm spot for an hour. I was too impatient to wait for it to double, but still got 12 very generous (burger sized) rolls out of this recipe that are hearty and won't fall apart when sliced. Excellent taste.

I followed as written and added maybe a half cup of flour while kneading in my mixer. These came out light and flavorful and excellent for sandwiches.

Ha!  These make the best 100% whole wheat tortilla like wraps ever!  Yes, we had a communication error, and managed to mix this up without getting the yeast in, so we had to turn these into more of a tortilla/wrap.  Fabulous!  Best accident this year!  Will try these rolls as per recipe ASAP.  Loved the flavor of these bread rounds.  Served with Onion Dijon Crusted Catfish from this site - making the sauce ahead of time, which turned the sauce into more of a pickled relish - which was perfect for these wraps.  Meant to have dinner rolls with the fish, but, since salad was served, and the wraps were accidently right there, magic happened, and the wraps were loved by all.  Thanks CloudsSunRain.  Sorry for our oops, but these were fabulous anyway!

I made them exactly as the recipe is written. These rolls are O.K. I don't know that I would make them again.
