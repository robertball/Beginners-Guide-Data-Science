This recipe is amazing! I chose not to peel the apples in order to retain the nutrients. In the end, I suspect the filling would have been softer had I peeled them; however, I did not care for its extra effort. The next time I make this, I will add 3/4 t. ground nutmeg when adding the cinnamon for flavor. 

Do yourself a favor and make the buttercrust pie dough used in Chef John's video for a mouth-watering, super-flaky crust. For that recipe, go to foodwishes.com and type 'buttercrust pastry dough' in the search box. Click on the first link. Voila!

I decided to give this recipe a try after seeing it in the June/July 2014 Allrecipes magazine. I thought using the star shaped cookie cutters was a really clever idea. I used one box of the Pillsbury refrigerated pie crusts, which made about 11 pies, using a 3 inch star shaped cookie cutter. I was able to cut out 8 stars on each sheet, then balled up the dough and rolled it out again. The filling is absolutely delicious! The little hand pies turned out great and were super easy to make. My kids loved them and I like how using the cookie cutters makes a nice dessert portion size. Definitely would make again!

This was great! My parents loved it. I messed up at first and put the mixture in a little hot, warning let it completely cool down! The dough will rip and the liquid will seep out. I also didn't pinch the edges good enough. Then I made more and they came out great. I also added blueberries into the second batch with the apples which was really nice too.

Used puff pastry sheets, filling was A++. My brother raved they were the best turnovers he ever had. Used a simple confectionary sugar/milk/vanilla glaze. Awesome!

Very easy and delicious. I made my apple filling the night before and left it in the fridge so the flavor could really seep into the apples. I also popped my turnovers back in the fridge on the baking sheet after assembling to chill the dough to get more fluff.

Thank you so much for this recipe! I had some store-bought pie dough that I had to use up as we had no electricity for a day due to an earthquake. The only fruit I had in the house was one nectarine, but I remembered that green tomatoes could be used when you don't have enough apples, so I used one large nectarine and two small green tomatoes for the filling. The only other thing I changed was to substitute vanilla for some of the cinnamon. My gas oven runs a little hot so they turned out a little brown, but so delicious! I will definitely be making this again!

Delicious! I used macintosh apples instead (5 small/medium size) and made 8 turnovers with double the patry dough.

I know people will hate me for this, so my apologies in advance, but I wanted to make cherry turnovers (without frying) and had no idea how to do it.  I used a prepackaged crust I had to get rid of and canned cherries (blech, I know), but for the record baking method was spot on.  Cut dough into quarters, rolled out, and finished as directed for above pies.  Husband loved.  Can't wait to try it with fresh apples.

These are wonderful!  I used 8 small freshly picked apples which yielded 3 cups of diced apples.  I doubled all the other ingredients.  I was able to make 4 hand pies each having 1/3 cup of cooked apples.  I used Kroger brand 'unroll and bake pie dough' in the fridge section to save time!  My kids made these and loved them.  My kids used my 8.5" round cookie cutter to cut out dough.  My husband keeps asking me to make them again!  Very good!  Great fall dessert!

Wonderful recipe made as stated. However I have changed the recipe to Fuji apples NO sugar or water added. The apples cook down making its own juice. But don't cook them thoroughly. This recipe is great made into a regular Apple pie. Apple's can be substituted with firm pears.

Whoa! So much cinnamon! So much sugar! It was way too sweet and I couldn't even taste the apples, so I tossed it and started again so as not to waste the pie crust. I'm going to go with half the white sugar and a quarter teaspoon of cinnamon, which is 1/6 what the recipe calls for.

Great recipe. Delicious. I more or less doubled this recipe and it turned out great. I don't make a lot of pies so the video made me a lot more comfortable giving this a try. Not only are they yummy but they're tantalizingly  beautiful as well. Now I'm ready to expand to other fruits. Go for it. But make plenty as they will be gone in no time.

I loved this recipe.  Not only was it so easy it was really yummy.  I went apple picking at a farm and make some to give away to friends.  They were really cute wrapped up in parchment paper with a little ribbon tie!

I made this using honey crisp and golden delicious.Stayed true to the recipe but I added 1/8 teaspoon of nutmeg.
 The honey crisp stayed firm during the cooking and the golden broke down a little more which I thought was perfect.
  I used puff pastry sheets which cut into 4 and was able to make 16 pies with enough for a small bowl of filling on the dinner table.
I baked at 400 degrees for 25 minutes and the results were awesome.
 No more store bought pies for lunch, this is it.
 Thanks....

I received this recipe today and decided to make these hand pies as I had some pastry that needed to be used up.  I found this recipe was easy to follow.  I used 3 Granny Smith apples as mine were not large.  Still got 4 hand pies.  I loved the ratio of tarty and sweet with this recipe.  I kept to the recipe with the exception that I also added 1/2 tsp nutmeg and a few shakes of cardamom...I love that spice!  I found I did not need to add any water as there was enough juice in the apples.  I prefer to keep the apples chunky so did not cook them down too much.  We all enjoyed these scrumptious little hand pies.  In fact I may just double or triple this recipe for apple filling for my pies too!  I will definitely try Chef John's butter crust recipe next time!

Wonderful!! I made the suggested pie crust in the video and it phenomenal! I used three rather small apples. Next time, if I use small apples, I will add one more small apple to my pie filling.  My only suggestion is to not make too many because you will be tempted to eat all of them. Definitely a keeper!

These are always a hit and make for a really easy dessert especially if you make the filling well ahead of time. I never worry about the type of apples and just use what we have on hand but usually will use at least 3 apples. I use the premodern pie dough and simple cut the roll in half, then put the filling on one half and fold over the other...no need to make a dough ball and worry about rolling out, etc.

It took a while longer for the apples to get soft than what was in the instructions and the pies browned more quickly 10-15 minutes was more than enough. Aside from cooking times this recipe was the best I've ever had (don't tell my mother). Made it this morning for a shop full of mechanics (man can they eat) and was asked if they could be adopted.... id say thats a pretty good sign. In fact I have already added it as a permanent addition to my cookbook. Fantastic recipe.  Will definitely use again.

What a simple yet delicious apple pie filling! I used 2 JonaGold apples, and used only 4 TBS of brown sugar. Also, I removed the apples after 5 mins (I like a bit of texture in my apple pies) and reduced the leftover syrup, which I then returned to the apples. I only had Crescent Roll dough, so I made turnovers with those - I added some walnuts as well. Everybody loved them! I really appreciate how you can adjust the sweetness with this recipe so the apples come out perfect - not too tart, not too sweet. This might be my go-to apple pie recipe from now on :)

Liked the fact that the amount of filling was perfect for me. Flavor was really good, for me it was a little too sweet next time I will cut the white sugar in half. Definitely a recipe I will use again! Thanks for the recipe.

i just tried this recipe tonight and these are so delicious! even though mine turned out ugly, they are still super yummy :) i used a package of Jiffy pie crust instead of prepared pie dough, because that's what i had, and cut my apples too big for their pockets i think. i made 8 instead of 4 since i don't have a big enough work space to roll out dough on.

Excellent!  Cooking the apples is a great idea and speeds up the cooking time.  Plus I was able to adjust the sugar and spices as the apples was cooking in the skillet.

Super simple and delicious. Did not need all the sugar, though - I used one teaspoon of brown sugar and sweeter apples and it was phenomenal. I have a son with IBS where sugar is a trigger and he was able to eat with no ill effects!

I was all set to make the pies when the Pillsbury dough sheet I was going to use was not any good and I was left with the cooked apples. So, I made individual apple cobblers with pecans and using the one cup ingredient method. My family loved it.

It needs flavor. With just sugars and cinnamon is missing the different flavors that highlight the apples.

Delicious recipe and by far better than anything at a restaurant. I’ve made it twice now. I will say that I will personally use 3 apples instead of two so I can enjoy a thicker filling. I just like mine more fruity and less fruit syrup. There is so much room for experimentation in this recipe. The first time I made it as-is, and my husband raved about them. This second time I added some almond extract and nutmeg to the apple mix. Also delicious! I think I’ll try some pecans mixed in at some point or some apricots or maybe some raisins. It’s just too fun to not experiment with this recipe! I give the original recipe 5 stars because it’s great, but I also give it 5 stars because it’s simple enough of a recipe to modify for fun.

My grandchildren absolutely LOVED these hand pies ! I did make them a little smaller than the recipe suggested because my little ones don't need them so big. But when there were only a few left over they began to try and compromise with each other as to who was going to have the last ones.
I am making them again and hiding some for myself !!

A great recipe when you are looking for something simple and easy. I did cut back a bit on the cinnamon and sugar, but that was a personal choice as I like my apple pie a little on the tart side.

I use the pastry dough I normally make for my pies... my husbands grandmother's recipe! I also already had some pie filling made up and just used the instructions, which turned out wonderfully!! :) My husband asked me to make some hand pies... so this is what I came up with and he was super happy! :)

Had some apples and pie dough I needed to get rid of and have had good experience with several of Chef John’s recipes, so decided to try. I used pre-made Pillsbury pie crusts and some slightly soft green apples that wouldn’t be eaten. Only change I made was to use lemon juice rather than water to deglaze, I just like the tartness it adds. I went a little firmer with my apples in the cook, and they were a big hit with the husband and kids, so will make again sometime! Thanks for the recipe and the video was super helpful for getting a nice tight seal on the pies, virtually no seepage!

This filling was delicious, thank you for sharing. I would have posted a picture but, the pie crust and I had a brawl and I lost. They were still very much edible, however.

These were AMAZING!!! I used boxed pie crust because I'm lazy. BUT the filling was soooooo good. When I took them out of the oven, I let them cool for about 15 minutes and then dipped them in a glaze and let that drip off while on a rack to cool. I took some to my parents and they loved them!!!

I had no apples so I used pears and added a dash of nutmeg to compliment them.

Very good pies indeed!  I have made these several times now, and I've used all kinds of different apples.  I like the Honeycrisp and Jonathan apples the best, but I've also liked the Pink Lady Apple version very much.  Even McIntosh apples, which I always seem to have on hand for eating raw, make a fine pie. You just need to adjust for the amount of liquid the various apple types exude while cooking.  Add a little tapioca to firm up the filling if necessary.

Excellent recipe and very easy to make a wonderful dessert! I made little changes: substituted brown sugar for the white and omitted the 2 Tsps brown sugar it calls for.  Also I didn't sprinkle sugar on top of the egg wash.  These are a definite keeper, thank you Chef John!

I have made the several times. I love them. I use the recipe as is on my first try and they were really good. Most of the time I just throw together my own apple pie mixture and use it in the hand pies. The crust that ChefJohn uses for this is amazing. I love it so much and I'll never use anything else.. 
One thing different I do is make eight  smaller pies because that's a lot of pie for us to eat. They are still great. And I like it that we can still have apple pie for dessert every once in a while without making an entire pie and wondering what to do with the rest of it.

This recipe was completed in less time than it takes me to make a pie the traditional way. I ended up with perfect little hand pies, which did not last long. I'll be making them again this weekend!  Thanks Chef John!

Really easy and delicious! I didn't have Granny Smith apples, but I had a load of gala apples that were going to go bad so I used them instead.  No complaints from anyone here so don't think this made a big difference but I will try using the Granny Smith next time to compare.

Thanks, chef John!,

I pretty much followed this recipe how it was written, with the exception that I added more apples and therefore had to add a little more of the sugar, butter and cinnamon to taste.  I also used the trader joes pie crust, yummy!  I will definitely be making this again as it was a big hit with my family.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Yum!  Very nice recipe and tasty.  I shared with friends and they love it as well as my husband and  myself.  I am working on making it again and not sharing this time.  I will freeze some for later (if we (me) don't eat it all first).  Vanilla ice cream goes wonderful with it, but not needed.  Just and extra treat.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!  Making it again tomorrow.  I did cheat and used a big can of apple pie filling.  Worked out great! Thank you for posting this recipe.

Love these little pies. My first try I didn't put enough filling, but once I began really stuffing the pies they were perfect. I make them in different sizes... Small round ones for lunch boxes. See picture on my cover.

I made it exactly as the recipe called for and it's amazing. My pastry recipe makes enough for 5 instead of 4 pies. I probably will add one more apple next time as depending on the size of apple you use its almost not enough filling.

OMG. Followed this recipe to the letter, and if you haven't already, you have to try Chef John's butter crust recipe.  My wife couldn't stop eating them.   Added fresh blueberries, floured to help prevent bursting, which helped to thicken the juices.  Will try adding pecans to the butter crust next time.

I absolutely love this recipe.  I dont like granny smith apples so I used 1 gala and 1 fuji.  This combination was perfect for me.
The rest of this recipe was followed to the letter.  My crust was a scratch recipe from Betty Crocker.  This will be my only recipe for apple pies. Thanks chef john.

I usually make apple pie, today it was time for something different.  The whole family loved the turnovers.
