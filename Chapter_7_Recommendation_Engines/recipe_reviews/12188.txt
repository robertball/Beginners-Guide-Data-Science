This was a strange consistency!  Very thin marshmallow mixture and just a cup of whipped cream, which didn't fluff it up hardly at all.  The taste was good, but it wasn't very pretty.  I did like the way the marsmallows conglomerated with the crust.  Tasty, but should be tweaked with a little.

I am so glad I don't count calories!  I made this for my Mom and we polished it off with milk.  Will make again soon.

My mom submitted this recipe, and I want to respond to Syrielle... if you used regular whipped cream instead of whipped topping (ie. Cool Whip), that's what went wrong for you.  Regular whipped cream is too thin.  Made as written, it turns out fluffy and delicious!
