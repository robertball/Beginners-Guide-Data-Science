Sounds like the right idea! I always add a small amount of minced celery as well and a 1/2 tsp of ground mustard when I saute the onion and celery. I find it provides a more rounded taste. It is one of my family's favorite holiday dishes.

This was not a combination that my family enjoyed at all. My kids took one bite and said no way! Although my daughter did pick the cheese and eat it. I didn't even eat much more than a bite or 2. Cheese and Carrots just didn't do it for our family.

Family took one bit said no way. My feelings were a little hurt until I tasted it. A waste of money to prepare...no doubt.

I thought that this was a pretty good recipe. I liked the cheese and carrots idea. I thought that the onion might have been a little off setting though. But overall I really enjoyed it and might make again.

This was a big hit with my family! The only thing I would do differently would be to add an extra 1/2 cup of processed cheese as I like just a tad more cheese. Otherwise thanks for an awesome recipe! I'm stuffed!

I made a cheese sauce with a chopped onion in it to pour over top. I also added a chopped zucchini to the cooked carrots when I put it in the oven.  I crushed up saltine crackers instead of bread crumbs and dotted with butter.  Then baked it uncovered at 350* until it was bubbly.
