really great when done right.  The only word of caution i have is don't let the beer reduce too much in the pan because it can get a VERY unpleasant bitter taste that pretty much ruins the stew.  The first time i made this it was so good, but the second time i made this mistake and it was not very good at all.

Absolutely loved this stew and hubby raved and pronounced it a "10!".  I stuck to the recipe with a few minor preparation tweeks.  I added small, quartered redskin potatoes to the bottm of the crock, sauted the bacon to about half cooked, then just added the beef and browned with the bacon, tossed bacon and beef over potatoes, and added my carrot and onions.  I used a 12 oz Guiness, and also added about a cup of beef broth.  I cooked 3 hours high, 4 hours low.  This stew was tender, flavorful, and delicious.  A fun St. Patricks Day dinner with plenty of leftovers.  Thanks for a great recipe!  Additional comments:  I've made this about 5 times since my review, I coat the beef with montreal seasoning, and use St. Peter's Cream Stout, has almost a sherry quality to it.

I've gone thru quite a few Irish beef recipes now, with this being my first in the slow cooker.  Can I just say "WOW!" - this was a fantastic recipe!  Having gone thru so many now and recognizing our personal tastes, I did make a few adjustments right off the bat.  I went overboard on the garlic (it was pre-minced), the rosemary and marjoram.  Added a fair amount of dried thyme leaves (about 2-3 teaspoons worth), and went up to 1 1/2 teaspoons of allspice.  Also cut up a large celery stalk, and added 4 decent sized yukon gold potatoes (skin left on) when I added everything else.  Left it on high for 6 hours - and it was just bursting with flavor!   With this recipe being so easy - it can't be beat :)  A keeper!!!!

This was really good. The only thing I changed was to add a bit of beef stock to my crock pot for a bit more flavor, and added celery and potatoes to the mix. I then thickened the gravy with a bit of corn starch. The beef was very tender, and the beer (I used Guinness) gave it an excellent flavor without being overpowering. I will make this one again.

My husband told me this was the best thing he's ever tasted. I have never had a more delicious crock pot meal. The meat was tender and the sauce was incredible.

This was good, although I found the sweet taste from the allspice to be a bit odd.  I added potatoes and celery and also a can of beef broth so it was more like a stew.  Otherwise there's hardly any liquid.  A bit of work to get it going, but I'd say it's worth it.  I cooked on low for about 8 hours.

Delicious stew! Made it for St. Patrick's with the Amazingly Easy Irish Soda Bread recipe from this site. I love anything in the slow cooker - the beer was tasty and the perfect seasoning.

I cooked this for the guys at the Fire Hall and they enjoyed it. As for some adjustments I used 1/2 of the beef stock to get the brownings and poured the beer along with the rest of the stock into the crock pot. The allspice was a bit much so I'll cut that back to a 1/2 to 3/4 tsp. I used 4 garlic cloves, a 3 bay leaves and 2 celery sticks. I used golden nugget potatoes on the bottom and they turned a little tart, next time I'll try Yukon Gold. A good tip from some reviewers. The sauce could be a little thicker but that's a personnel choice. All in all a good recipe to keep which I'll do.

Good and full of flavor. I added some red wine to add of bit of depth to my dish while it was cooking in the crockpot. Teh bacon really enhanced the flavor. Yum

Looks like we're the only ones who didn't like this. We used Guiness Extra Stout and it didn't turn out at all. Maybe a milder beer? And less onions unless you're a huge fan of them. As is, it's like onion stew with an overpowering bitter beer base.

My husband and I are trying to watch our intake of saturated fats, so I left out the bacon and added a few drops of liquid smoke. It doesn't *really* replace the bacon flavor, but at least we can still get that yummy smokiness!

Cooked bacon with meat. Would add potatoes to make it more complete. Added the beer directly into slowcooker rather than cooking it in the skillet first.

Very good recipe.  I didn't think the allspice tasted odd at all, as a previous reviewer did.  I substituted frozen pearl onions for the chopped onion. I also baked the stew in the oven for 4 hours at 250 degrees only because I was home for the day.  I would make it in the crock pot if I was working or going to be out for the day.  I'll have to remember this recipe for a cold winter day.

Excellent! I didn't have any Guinness, so I just used 3 cups or so of beef broth.  I also added two large potatoes, peeled and chopped. Smelled SO wonderful in my crockpot all day. Thanks so much for this recipe.

I really liked this idea but I changed a couple things... Instead of 4 large onions, I did 2, added 3 lg potatoes, and 6 stalks celery. I used a pint of Guinness, and 12 oz of (whatever beer I had in the fridge ((blue moon spring)). I also added 2 sm cans of cream of mushroom soup to make it less watery. I threw in about 2 tablespoons of flour to thicken it all up a bit. I really liked the way it turned out, as did those I served it to for St. Patrick's Day!

oh, my! absolutely delicious. better than pot roast, because there's no chuck roast-type fat running through it and getting in the way of pure meat deliciousness. the stew meat, which i bought already cut in chunks from whole foods, was falling apart tender. only changes i made were adding some yukon gold potatoes and celery, and also, didn't have guinness on hand so i used a bottle of corona, and used dried parsley too. everyone loved it, even my 6-year-old who won't eat pot roast because of the fat that you encounter. i know some folks mentioned the allspice, but i found it wasn't a factor at all. it blended with the meat seamlessly and deliciously.

I love using the slow cooker although, obviously, I prefer fewer dishes. I may try and find a way to make this without browning everything first. Any suggestions? Or is the browning really necessary for the delicious-factor? Also thinking of doing liquid smoke instead of the bacon and vegan "crumbles" for the beef.

quite good. i did not add the allspice (it sounded weird), the marjoram (don't keep it around), and i used guiness "black lager". rather than try to squeeze cubed potatoes into my stockpot, i served the stew over mashed potatoes, which the family seemed to enjoy!

Wonderful, rich stew.  I believe the allspice enhanced the flavor.  Proud to be Irish with this one!!! :)  Served with Champ and Penguin Lady's Irish Soda Bread on this website.  Alterations to recipe:  Used only 2 pounds of meat and made with 2 cups whole baby carrots.  I also altered cooking method.  Sauteed the onion and garlic with meat in dutch oven.  Added remaining ingredients and simmered for 2 hours, stirring occasionally.  Beef was melt-in-your mouth tender!!  Recommend adding bacon "to taste" because the gravy was already rich and flavorful enough.  I will also try adding potatoes to stew instead of the serving champ on the side just to "change up".

Add a some potatoes and thicken up the sauce and you have yourself a real Irish stew.  With these modifications it was absolutely excellent.

Thank you pollock1231! We absolutely loved this recipe. The only modification I made was switching parsley for basil (only because I forgot to buy the parsley). I think this will be a St. Patty's tradition.

Great flavor easy to make - I'm not a beef eater typically and this was tolerable, not to "beefy" the Guinness really shines.

We made this for a St. Patricks day dinner. I don't usually like beef stews but this was AMAZING espically served with horse radish mashed potatoes.   Here is what I changed: Used ZANTS instead of raisens (they are dried currents and are alot smaller than raisens). Added celery and did not use rutabegers or potatoes. Added the mashed potatoes to the soup when served.   Rave reviews all around!

This was fantastic, my whole family loved it!  Next time I will take it easy on the allspice, it was maybe a little too much.  Made a Guinness chocolate cake for dessert - a perfect St. Patty's Day meal!

I found this very fatty and I didn't really enjoy the flavour. Maybe if it was tweaked it would be better? If i make it again i will not use all the bacon drippings, half the amount of beer and instead try to make a gravy. THe texture of this is just liquid fat.

The spices in this stew are amazing.  I doubled the recipe, invited friends over and when we were done, it looked like they had licked the pan clean.  For the Irish ale, I used Guinness Extra Stout. I did alter the recipe a wee bit...and I think this was for the better. First, I added Klondike Baby potatoes as I can't imagine a true Irish Stew not having potatoes.  Second, I added one large box of Swanson's Beef Broth and lastly, I cut the onions up very small instead of cutting them in eighths.  I liked this recipe so much, I may cook it again today!

This was perfect!  It definately is becoming a family favourite.  10 points from DH who says this is now his favourite dish!  Thanks so much.

Tweaks i made was to add some diced potates and zuchinni slices.  Plus i used fresh rosemary instead of dried.  2 cups of beef stock and 2tbspn of tomato paste along with the beer.  Plus i served it up with steamed rice.

This stew fit the bill perfectly for a gathering of my Irish Jewish family. Since it had no potatoes, I decided to make tiny potato latkes (the kind from a bag), brown them in the oven until they were very crispy and serve them around the perimeter of the stew bowls as a garnish/starchy side. It was a huge hit! Great recipe.

This "Beer-Baked Irish Beef" was good. If I were to make it again, I would chop the onions in small pieces and caramelize them for aesthetics (not cut in eighths and add raw - not sure about authenticity) before adding to the slow cooker, although I just noticed that Saveur's photo shows a way to cut the onions such that they appear attractive (unlike mine). I would also use baby carrots and add some fingerling potatoes and Worcestershire sauce as another variation. This recipe was very flavorful "as is," but a soup bone might be a nice addition if I were serving guests (although not necessary). I served mine with colcannon for St. Patrick's Day. It is a nice easy recipe to make on a busy day. Thank you pollock1231 for sharing your recipe.

I have made this recipe many times, and it always turns out great. Tonight I made it with Diane's Colcannon recipe, they are great together. I usually save these recipes for St. Patrick's day, but had all the veggies for these in my CSA box this week. I cooked it on high for 2.5 hours today, but have also done it on low for 6-8 hours, both always turn out great.

A great hearty recipe!  I added some red potatoes in exchange for some of the meat.  I also added a whole can of beef broth, as other users suggested, in order to make it more of a stew.  Worchester sauce next time?

I did most of this recipe, except I only used 3 onions. I used Guinness and as someone else suggested I added Bovril diluted down as a broth. I also added small white potatoes cut in half. I used a Trio gravy mix to thicken up the fluid it turned out well to dunk bread in.
But one thing I did, I did it at 12 midnight, and let it cook till 4:30 the following day. As my friend says...Deilcious! The meat was very tender.

I will make this again but no allspice next time; Also, I must have used an unusal brand of beer because it was overpowering.  I had to all Worcestershire, sugar and some white wine to cut it.  Next time I'll use Bud.
Recipe made excellent gravy and I served over mashed potatoes.

I have been making a similar recipe for years using a roast that I cut into chunks, flour and brown, then place into crockpot. I add baby carrots and chunks of onion and a bit of sea salt and ground black pepper. I add one envelope of dried onion soup and cover completely with Michelob AMBERBOCK beer. The meat falls apart, it is so tender. Cook on low for 6-8 hours. Serve with mashed potatoes and use liquid as gravy. It smells heavenly! Might need a bit of spicing up for some of you, but we love it.

I don't usually change the recipes the 1st time I try them, but my crockpot is small.  I mostly halved the recipe except I used just one onion, a couple handfuls of baby carrots, some extra garlic and Pearl Street Nut Brown (Wisconsin).  Very good on top of some mashed potatoes with rolls!

I think the allspice adds a weird flavor to this. I did happen to leave out the marjoram - so maybe that would have counteracted the allspice a bit. But anyway, I'd go easy on the allspice if you're into a more traditional stew flavor.

Flavoring was okay, but was super greasy. I think it is because so much of the cooking is done in bacon grease.  It was so greasy I could get multiple spoonfuls of grease off the top of my bowl. I would cut the bacon grease next time.

The only thing I added was some cubed potatoes and cut back on the onion a bit because of personal tastes. I was disappointed with it, I found it a bit bland. Other stews here on site using beer were better in our opinion.

Absolutely fantastic stew! I switched out pork bacon for beef, lot more drippings to use to cook the cubed beef in plus NOT dicing the bacon and dropping it whole into the slow cooker after frying it up added just the perfect amount of salt into the stew.

It was just okay. I followed the recipe to a "T". It was kind of bland. It really could have used some potatoes, or possibly mushrooms. I might make it again, but I WILL be making some changes to it.

I thought it was pretty under seasoned. I added more garlic, Italian seasoning, and basically whatever else I had that looked good in my spice cabinet. The Guinness beer actually had a pretty bitter taste, so I added a can of Campbell's french onion soup. And lastly I added potatoes. I peeled and chopped 3 medium size yellow potatoes. After these additions, the stew was fabulous!
