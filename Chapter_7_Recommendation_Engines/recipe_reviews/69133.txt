Most of the hazelnut flavor in this cupcake comes from the NutellaÂ® frosting.  It is good, but I was disappointed that the cake itself did not have a stronger hazelnut presence.  If you were to add more Frangelico liqueur the cake would be too sweet.  I did place a small amount of batter in the tins before adding the candies. Next time I would simply fill the tins and push the candies into the batter.  Thanks for sharing!

I used Hershey's Special Dark cocoa and frozen Ferrer Rocher candies (no special reason for freezing, just what I had). I need more practice making pretty cupcakes, but I'll eat tasty and ugly ones any day!

Very dry and flat.  I used unsalted butter so I'm thinking it needed salt.

I followed the steps and my cupcakes didn't taste like chocolate or rise in the middle. Not sure what went wrong.
