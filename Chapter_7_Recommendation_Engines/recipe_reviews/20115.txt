I didn't add the sugar to the whites right away. You'll get a better rise  out of your whites (& won't have to whip it as long) if you whip the whites to a soft peak first, then gradually add the sugar.  I cooked mine on an aluminum baking sheet so I added 10 minutes to the cook time. I let it cool in the oven for two hours & it was still too gooey in the center.  I was barely able to grab a pic before the pile of cherries I put on top, caved in the pavlova. :o( There's another recipe, on this site, that calls for the pavlova to be baked @ 300 degrees for an hour...that one worked much better for me. I'll use it again next time but thanks anyway Christina!

Great recipe!  I followed the recipe exactly, except instead of making one large cake I made 5 small ones so everyone can have an individual desert.  I made this for my friends and they LOVED IT.  I will definately make this again, but I will probably use less sugar next time, as this was a bit too sweet for my taste.

A friend made this for me years ago, and called it a Shaum Torte, but the Shaum Torte recipes at this site looked more like traditional merengues.  This was what I was looking for.  Whipped up some fresh heavy cream, and served it with strawberries.  Great summer dessert.  There's nothing like that soft, creamy, marshmallow-like center.  I love it.    If you've never had it--give it a try.  Unique and delicious.

I've not had much luck with Pavlova in the past, but this came out great!!  I made 6 individual Pavlova's and cut the baking time.  My guests were impressed with their individual desserts.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Great pavlova recipe. Crunchy outside soft inside. Only thing - I'd add less sugar next time.

Excellent recipe! I decorated the cake with chocolate flakes and chocolate sauce and served with tinned fruit on the side. Everybody loved it and I will definately do it again! Thank you, Christina.

Maybe I was doing something wrong but this was terribly hard to make! It also tasted too much like egg and it wouldn't shape properly. I found that the outside burned and the inside was undercooked. Despite the other good reviews, I found this recipe frustrating.

I made this topped with whipped cream and strawberries for a Mother's Day dessert and the plate was scraped clean! It is a perfect light dessert. I've never had Pavlova before, only the crisp-all the-way-through type of meringue, so I'm only guessing that it turned out correctly. It was crisply dry on the outside with a marshmallowy soft center. I made some temperature adjustments for my convection oven and once the Pavlova was done, I just turned the oven off and left it in the oven until completely cool. I followed a comment on another Pavlova recipe by that said to only slightly sweeten the whipped cream for topping the dessert. The sweet of the meringue and the tart of the fruit and the barely sweetened cream are in balance that way. (PS- I asked a Kiwi friend about how it is supposed to come out and he said that soft but not runny in the middle is correct and that they almost always cave in on top when you put the fruit on it.)

This was a standard growing up in New-Zealand, and definitly a very easy and yummy desert for anyone to make. Don't open the oven until it's cooked though.

Although the one my mum made had no cornstarch and use malt vinegar, but you'll find lots of different recipes they all end up being delicious ;)

This is wonderful!  Easy and delicious and company thinks I slaved all day to make it!  Make sure you leave it in the oven for at least an hour to dry, or it'll be like sticky cotton candy.  I added 4 tsps. grated lemon peel and it's delicious!

YUM! Out here in West Texas we rarely have to worry about humid days and this whipped up (pun intended) beautifully! I followed the recipe only deviating at the last minute by making 5 individual "nests" instead of just one. I still baked it as stated in the recipe and the five little "nests" turned out beautifully!

Fabulous.  One important note about pavlova - do not try to make if weather is very humid other wise it is just gummy and chewy enough to pull out the fillings in your mouth. The cornstarch and vinegar help to stablize this, but still best made on a dry day.

Tried this for the first time this last weekend, dividing it into 6 small circles instead of one large.  It came out ok but it was way too sweet and it wasn't moist on the inside. Probably will reduce the sugar next time as well as the baking time. Otherwise, it was simple to make and presents beautifully!

Turned out beautiful. If you want to use a 9" cake tin for shape, remember to cover the bottom of the tin with baking parchment, and also the sides of the tin. Otherwise it will stick. If you do this it will slide out nicely. Another tip is to cut 2 lengths of parchment to cross over below the tin-coating parchment, with the four ends sticking out all sides. That way, you can lift the pavlova neatly out of the tin without breaking the delicate meringue.

I made with splenda and it was definitely too sweet.  Next time I would only use 1/2 cup of splenda and I thought it was good plain.  Used fat free cool whip and mixed berries (frozen then thawed) so the tart of the berries helped offset the sweet.  Interesting consistency though.  Will try it again, not a lost cause for me.

Before attempting to whip egg whites, the egg yolks must first be completely separated from the egg whites as the yolk contains fat which prevents the whites from foaming and whipping. If even a tiny speck of egg yolk is left behind the whites may not foam and whip properly. The bowl and beaters you are using to beat the egg whites must be clean and free of any grease or dirt; wash the beaters and bowl in hot water just before using to ensure everything is squeaky clean.

 Meringue is sensitive to the outside weather and you will have more success in making meringue on a cool dry day.  Meringue absorbs moisture from the air, therefore in damp or humid weather meringues often need to bake longer than the specified time. Humidity may also cause meringues to collapse and become sticky. Adding 1 to 2 tablespoons, or even up to 1 cup of confectioners’ (powdered) sugar will help meringue hold-up in humid weather.

Old egg whites whip better than fresh ones. Allow farm-fresh eggs to sit 3 to 4 days so the whites will start to thin; egg whites begin to thin and become clearer, making them easier to whip if they are a few days old. Most eggs purchased in a grocery store can be used immediately as they are likely to be at least a week old.

This was fantastic!  Make sure that you do have the parchment paper before you make it though, I made the mistake of not using parchment paper underneath, and couldn't get it off the pan without it cracking and crumbling.  I would also agree with the other reviews, I cut back to a cup of sugar and it still was very sweet.  I will definately make it again!
