I loved this recipe!  I tried to cut back on the canned milk because of other reviews and it was a bit strong.  I only made three changes to the recipe . . . I added 1-2 tsp lemon juice and 1 tsp vanilla.  To get a smooth flavor more like fruity ice cream place the pre-canned milk mix in your freezer in a tubbaware bowl and stir it about every 45 minutes.  When it seems a bit more firm (about 2 hrs) add the canned milk (only 4-5oz!) and let set overnight.  Break it up in the morning and mix in a blender or stand mixer till smooth (the more air you get into the mix the lighter the end product will be)  Then place back in the freezer to firm up again.  Note:  You can use strained watermelon, mango, grapes, or any fruit or mix to create your own favorites with this recipe.

Tastes more like creamsicle than orange sherbet.  I put all ingredients in my ice cream freezer, and it came out like thick soft serve.  Not a lot of orange flavor, doesn't taste like the store bought stuff at all.

We could taste more of the evaporated milk flavor than the orange flavor.  Not very good at all.

Easy recipe.  Pretty good, but would for myself add more orange juice and less condensed milk.

Very simple to make and my children really enjoyed it.  I found it took longer to make than the recipe said and it tastes more like an orange popsicle with vanilla ice cream inside.  Still, a keeper for it's simple ingredients and ease.

Yes!  After reading the other reviews I did make two small changes. To give it a stronger orange flavor I reduced 1&1/2 cups of orange juice with 1 tsp. of marshmallow fluff stirred in to 5 oz. with to replace the condensed milk in the original recipe. I loved and followed APPYFROGGIE's suggested steps and this came out great.

I agree that there's too much evaporated milk and too little orange flavor.  While I had the original orange part out of the freezer beating it, I took a taste of that and it was pretty good, so I had high hopes.  I was disappointed with how the evaporated milk changed it so much.  I will try experimenting and see if I can work this into something more orangy and less creamy.  It was pretty easy, and I love orange, so there's at least a good basis here.  UPDATE:  A long time later and I decided to do something with this.  I didn't want to get too drastic at first, so I increased the orange juice to 1 cup and then added 1 T of concentrate to give it more orange flavor.  I had 3 oz. evaporated milk left over from something else, so I just tried the 3 oz.  It was definitely much better and closer to sherbet.  But it could still use a bit more orange.  There's still something off about the consistency and I'm not sure how to fix that.  With these changes I might call this a 4.  (However, the *recipe* is still a 2.)

This became an instant hit with my husband.  My daughter had fun making it with me, but didn't like having to wait so long...it took most of the day to get done.  The taste was great but my daughter was disappointed that it wasn't very orange in color.  I will definately be making this again and maybe I will try some of the changes that other made to experiment a bit.

The milk flavor was overwhelming.  It didn't taste like sherbet at all. I followed the directions exactly.
