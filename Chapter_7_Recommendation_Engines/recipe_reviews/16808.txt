Simple and good. Needed the full container (1.5 quarts) of ice cream. Used the recipe for 'Graham Cracker Crust I'.  Fun to decorate with melted chocolate chips.

We used a granola crust instead of graham and topped it with chocolate syrup which really added to the flavor.  This recipe is extremely easy.  My children are still talking about it the next day it was so good.
