WAY too salty!  The salt overpowers the chicken and celery.  I also had a problem with the bundles sticking and burning to the pan.  I had no trouble with the dough.  I did not find this recipe time consuming either.  I actually made two seperate batches after I decided each of my sons and husband would like at least two a piece.  I gave my 3 star rating only with recipe as is which I followed.  Now if the salt were cut at least in half and the gravy was doubled, I think it would have potential for 4 or even 5 stars.  Thank you for the recipe!

I really enjoyed this recipe and so did my 10 year old son.  He couldn't get enough.  I put the chicken, along with some fresh spinach, in a food processor.  The mixture fit nicely in the dough after it was processed.  I had to use a little more shortening than the recipe called so that the dough was crumbly.  I also had to cook it a bit longer than 20 minutes in order for it to flake.  I also doubled the recipe and used one can of cream of chicken and one can of cream of celery.  Great flavor.

Surprisingly yum! Just like everyone else I had to add more shortening and considering I have never seen a dumpling before I had to play with the dough to make to work.  But also I make all my recipes on Sunday it worked out really well I made the dumplings while I made everything else (20min) and latter in the week I plopped it in the gravy and cooked.  Great recipe for a make ahead.

I have to start by saying that I didn't have time to make this recipe the way it calls for.  I didn't make the dough.  Instead, I mixed all the other ingriedients together and added them to prepared macaroni noodles.  This was very delicious.  The flavor of the chicken and cream of chicken soup kicked it up.  I also added a drained can of carrots just for some color but it added flavor too.

Flavors were good, especially the gravy, but execution was awful.  I had to add more shortening to resemble "coarse crumbs", and after rolling the dough to 1/8" thickness, most of the bundles broke.  Maybe if you've been making these for 40 years you can prep in 20 minutes, but if you're attempting this for the first time, allow more time.  Also, I cooked the bundles for well over 30 minutes, and the pastry never really flaked.  The full recipe was too much of a hassle to make again, sorry.

I had to add more shortening to get the dough to the correct texture.  My family really liked this!

Very good! I added a little shredded cheddar in with the chicken mixture and it was great! Will make again.

This is kinda tough to make but is far better than most of the chicken and dumplings recipes on this site.

My whole family, including my picky 1 & 5 year olds, loved this recipe.  Kind of a variation on chicken & dumplings.  I made a few modifications to suit our taste which came out very well. For the dough, I used half all-purpose and half whole wheat flour, and added about 2 T. of Italian seasoning to it.  The dough never really "flaked" for me as stated in the recipe, but after simmering for about 20 minutes it was done.

this was extremely time consuming. it took me an hour and half to prep. now i know a big part of that was that i'm a novice but it was a heck of a lot of work.

Not bad, but too much work for what it is.  I found it is a little on the salty side.

my whole fam loved this! even though i botched it up a bit, it was still great.
i doubled the recipe and used cream of mushroom, b/c i doidn't have cream of chick. I added some chicken boullion to the soup in an attempt to mask the mushroom-ness.  I made it a bit too salty though. I really enjoyed the ease of this recipe.  Thank you so much! :-)
