Just a note for the cooks on the American side of the border.  White distilled vinegar sold in canada is NOT the same as white distilled vinegar sold in the states. Even the same brand such as Heinz tastes different.  Canadian Vinegar is sweeter and it makes a big difference when it is the main ingredient.

Hey Brenda, I live in Ottawa and I find mine are better. These were pretty good but it missed something, maybe some dill weed. Thanks anyway, enjoyed it a lot

these are great thanks! the longer they are left, the softer the eggs become - as long as the jars are sealed that is!

They were ok but more less tasted like vinegary eggs. Made it just as recipe  called for. Probably will try another recipe when these are gone. Thank you though.
