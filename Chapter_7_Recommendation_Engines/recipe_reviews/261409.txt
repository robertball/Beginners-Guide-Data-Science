Delicious dressing! I had it with baby spinach dried cranberries candied pecans and gorgonzola cheese. I cut back a little on the maple syrup. Sometimes you have to change things a little to suit your own taste preference. Thanks Barbara. I'll surely make this again!

This is exceptionally good! I made a big batch and am very pleased with it. It's mild and compliments the salad without overpowering it. It's a keeper!

Tripled the recipe as I made a large salad for a group. Although I held back a third helping of maple syrup as this was the first time using this recipe and wasn t sure if the sweetness would be acceptable to all.
