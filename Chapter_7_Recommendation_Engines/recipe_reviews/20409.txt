This. Is. AWESOME. My husband and I absolutely adored this drink. I used my own homemade irish cream liqueur and I think that really took it over the top. Incredible nightcap drink. Very decadent. NOTE: Math is not my strong suit but if you cut this in half and use one medium sized scoop of ice cream instead of one full pint of ice cream, you'll get two perfect servings. I don't know if something got lost in translation when the recipe was added to this site, but the way I did it worked for us.

I'm not a coffee drinker so this wasn't my favorite - I had to give it 5 stars though because my husband is and he loved it.  Will make it for him again.  Thank you

This works well with just about any liqueur.
YUMMY with Kahl√πa or Frangelico.
Bailey's is NOT one of my favorites. 

To this day, anything that lists 'Irish Cream' has to be skipped ...

Yummy!!!I made this the other night-just for myself(hubby doesn't drink coffee!!) and it was sooo good.Put one small scoop of ice cream in my mug and poured a small amount of cream rum on top and then poured coffee in.Can't wait to try Kahlua or Baileys(need to make a run to the liquor store to stock up first though)!Really great idea Kim!

Very interesting, but not as good as you would think.  We used Kahlua, which doesn't seem to taste very good when heated.  The ice cream made the drink turn lukewarm; it was neither a hot drink nor a cold one.  I don't know.  Maybe with your own adjustments you'll love it.  It has potential.

Very appropriate for this fall, cool weather we've been having here.  My mom and I served this as an after-dinner drink at a recent Sunday dinner with family. Very chic but fun and tasty. Thanks Kim!

Very good! My ice cream was not lightly coated, it was swimming in Irish Cream, and it still tasted delicious--creamy, and the liquer was not overpowering. Instant coffee was used. Even with these improvisations, it turned out well. I'd definitely make it again.

Mmmmmm, a delicious variation of the Italian "affogato" - a scoop of vanilla gelato with a shot of freshly brewed espresso poured over. Adding the Bailey's was creative and gave this a sweeter, more multi-dimensional flavor. Loved it - it was the perfect after dinner drink.

Well, I think if there is a 'next time', I will do what another reviewer had suggested by adding whipped cream instead of ice cream.  The mixture of hot coffee and ice cream made the drink lukewarm.  I believe my own saliva was a bit cooler than the drink itself.  Other than that, it did have a nice flavor, although I was quite disappointed in wasting a good bottle of Bailey's the first time around.

Well this was a good idea... the taste was good but it was alomost like drinking coffee that has been sitting around and got cold...not sure if I liked it or not or what to do to make it better...I did heat it in the microwave but that seemed to make it worse....

This is a delicious drink, but I found it would be more delicious, if you blend or shake the ingredients and top the beverage with whipped cream.

This recipe is so simple and delicious...my new favorite dessert!!!  I made these for my St. Patrick's Day party, and they were thoroughly enjoyed by all.  I used GIANT scoops of ice cream, medium roast coffee brewed in my Senseo (which I sweetened with a good amount of sugar), and a very generous amount of Bailey's.  The result was smooth, creamy, lukewarm Irish coffee with French vanilla ice cream floating throughout.  I liked the contrast of temperature between the slighty warm coffee and the cold ice cream.  The sweetness was just right.  A perfect way to end a hearty Irish meal, or any meal for that matter.  Love it!

Excellent!  This is so delicious and creamy....its going to be hard not to want to make these in the mornings!  I did sweetin my coffee up a tad bit before pouring over the ice cream.  If your wanting the drink to stay hot, definately boil the water.  The ice cream really cools it off.  I used folgers carmel drizzle coffee and baileys for the irish cream. YUM!

I make something similar to this but use whipped cream on top instead of the ice cream - it didn't taste all that different. The only thing was that the ice cream cooled the coffee to almost room temperature. I didn't mind that though. It was very good and I would make it again.

This is really good!  Perfect for a warm, cozy evening by the fireplace.  As with all coffee, the amount of cream and sugar varies from one individual to the next.  I like plain Irish coffee (black coffee with Irish whiskey), so I found the recommended mix to be perfect, but I can see where others may want to double the amount of ice cream or even add additional sugar.

I changed this to 2 servings with the calculate button, but would like to know what kind of cup can hold 2 cups of coffee, ice cream, and the Irish cream? I ended up only being able to fit 1 cup of coffee per cup. The amount of cups of coffee should equal the amount of servings. I wanted it in a nice glass, not a 7-11 big gulp. The full recipe should make 12 servings and not 6. The only change I made was using 1/2 fat ice cream and decaf coffee. However, in my honest opinion, consider this a "sundae." With the amount of sugar in Irish cream and vanilla ice cream, it really is a melted dessert. However, it does have a nice flavor.

My fiance and I had to add extra sugar and Bailey's to sweeten ours up, but overall, very good.  Soothing after a long day.

I loved the flavor of this, but found myself not fond of it being lukewarm. I had to heat it in the microwave to finish, but then there was no point of the ice cream. I think this would be much better with cold coffee.

Delicious! The ice cream goes perfect with the coffee. Don't even need to add sugar.
