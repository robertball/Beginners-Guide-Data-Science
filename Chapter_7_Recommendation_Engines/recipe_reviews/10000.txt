I had a specific idea in mind for the cake I wanted to bake today so I had to scout around to find a recipe for the cake as well as the filling.  Since I was making a chocolate layer cake with no frosting, I was after a moist, dark chocolate cake with a rich, billowy cream filling.  I chose “Breakstone’s Triple Chocolate Bliss Cake” and this filling, which proved to be exactly what I was after.  (I did NOT make the cookie part of this recipe)  While I have purchased countless jars of Marshmallow Creme over the years, I shamefully admit they’ve always been tossed before I could use them. I buy another and the same thing happens, over and over again. So this was the first time I have ever tasted or used Marshmallow Creme.  I beat the butter, powdered sugar, milk and vanilla until good and fluffy, then added the sticky, gooey Marshmallow Creme, which I just beat in until combined.  I didn’t have to add a thing; the consistency was perfect.  On its own, it tasted a little too buttery but I needn’t have been concerned because it was perfect once paired with the cake.  The contrast of the dark chocolate cake with this fluffy, cloud-like frosting was stunning.  And eye-rolling delicious. Now that I’ve finally opened up a jar of this stuff after all these years of wanting to, I know I won’t be a stranger to it any longer.  I could see frosting an entire cake with this filling, pouring a rich chocolate ganache over it, or using it as a filling for cupcakes or “Twinkie-like” cakes.

these should be under whoopie pies because that is what they are more similar to. BUT, the taste of the cookie (but NOT the texture) part is very similar to oreos. I dropped them out by the heaping tablespoon and got about a 2 3/4" cookie and ended up w/ about 28 finished sandwiches. The filling is really yummy. I used exactly 1 cup of marshmallow filling since I had the big jar and wasn't sure how to measure out 7oz's. I didn't think the filling was sticky or messy at all. They went together and stayed together just fine. A note to all who are going to try this recipe: the cookies do spread a little but they puff up into a dome shape and hold that shape and the texture is like cake. So, if you're expecting them to look and feel like oreos - this is not the recipe for you. If you like whoopie pies and want an easy and good recipe for them - this is for you!

I'm not sure what happened with these but they came out awful. No one liked the flavor and the cookies spread like crazy. I've made whoopie pies for years using my mothers' recipe but I couldn't find it so I thought I'd try this one. I think I'll keep  searching for my other one. Thanks though!

They were like whoopie pies, but the cookie part itself didn't have a very sweet flavor.

I thought these were too rich...maybe I did something wrong...who knows.  But, the frosting was absolutely delicious!  I will definately use the recipe for the frosting even without the cookie.

The cookies were very fast to make. But they didn't spread very well and the marshmellow ran out of the sandwiches and made a sticky mess! I won't be making these again.

I only made the filling as I had some leftover marshmallow creme to use up.  The frosting is not very good.  I had to add in more sugar as its consistentcy wasn't right.  You're better off making a shortening based frosting.

I'm giving the Filling 5 stars... I didnt use  the cookie recipe because a lot of the reviews said It was more of a cakey cookie and I'm trying to imitate Christies FudgeeOs cookie for my hubby.  I ended up using the "chocolate mint sandwich cookied" recipe from this site. The filling was AMAZING..... Delicious.. I liked the marshmellow cream thats what led me to use this recipe. It was the only recipe that called for it. I added cocoa powder to it because my hubby is a chocolate fan ... and again I'm makeing fudgeeo's. THanks again  this is a versitle filling recipe also.. can try many things with it. so thanks again.

This rating is based solely on the frosting portion of the recipe. I love this frosting! I used it to frost my Christmas cookies as well as for filling for my oatmeal cream pies. It is exceptional! I can't wait to make a cake and use it there,too. Outstanding. My family LOVES it.

I thought these cookies were just so-so but my family seemed to like them.  I thought the cookies were a little bland and were more cake-like than cookie-like.  They puffed up instead of spreading and made a very large cookie.  The cream filling was overly sweet and didn't firm up well.  I have a different sandwich cookie recipe that has an excellent filling.  It calls for 3/4 cup shortening, instead of the butter, and no vanilla.  It has a firmer texture and isn't overly sweet.  I've sometimes used soy milk in place of the regular milk and it gives it a nice flavor.

I was really excited when I found this recipe!  I have  a friend who makes amazing Whoopie pies!  It took me 5 hours to make these by scratch alone.  Made 37 whoopie pies various sizes.  Rounded teaspoons on the cookie sheet makes very small cookies.  I used heaping teaspoons, and a rounded cereal spoon.  I made 3 big cookies...almost 2 cereal spoons worth of batter.  I managed to only eat one while making them!  I am  disappointed with the chocolate cookies.  I thought they would be more moist and chocolately.  They were on the dryer side and there wasn't enough chocolate flavor. :(  The cream filling was AMAZING!  Definitely will use the cream filling again! :)  Overall this recipe is good.

Fabulous!  The filling was a little runny, so I popped them in the freezer for a bit.  It also made more filling than I needed, so I'm planning to top some hot choclate on our cold winter mornings!

This cookies were just blehhhh.  Not the brownie-type batter I was expecting.  I followed the recipe exactly, too.  I think they might be better with margarine or butter instead of the shortening.

i love baking things from scratch so i loved this recipe, but i think using a not so sweet cocoa made it worst. i recommend using a good brand cocoa to get the best out of this recipe. i have also used raspberry extract instead of vanilla and it was pretty good!

I actually didn't make the cookies... I made the filling recipe.It is a wonderful icing/filling. Very light and sweet with a nice buttery taste. Great on my chocolate cake! Something different rather than a boring plain icing. Thanks for this recipe.

Was like Whoopie pies, but not as good as I had hoped. The cookie was bland and tasteless. Since I already had chocolate frosting I didn't make the frosting that went this recipe. Won't make again. Thanks anyway.

The cookies came out way too puffy and making them into a sandwich was kind of awkward, so I added more powdered sugar to the filling which made frosting and put a teaspoonful on top of each cookie like icing and they looked just lovely.  The cookie is bland tasting, but it complements the very sweet taste of the filling.  I liked em!

We followed the recipe carefully, and the cookie portion turned out okay, if a little bland.  However, the filling came out as more of a sticky liquid than fluffy and also tasted too strongly of butter.  Perhaps less butter should be used to make it thicker, or perhaps using straight marshmallow creme would make for a better filling.  This filling version squirts out the opposite end from one's bite, and the top sandwich cookie slides around, making for a mess on top of the odd flavor.  We might try the freezing idea just in the hopes of the filling getting harder and losing some of the butter tang.

I made these and sent them to work with my husband. They have gotten rave reviews from everyone. The filling is some of the best I have ever tasted, and the cookies come out most and round. I am not a fand of cookie sandwiches or whoopie pies myself, but I must say these are fantastic!

I was so disappointed by these cookies :o(  They were easy to make, came off the cookie sheets without a problem, looked nice, and had a good texture (soft but not so soft that they fell apart), but I didn't like the taste one bit!  And in the end, flavor definitely beats out over how easy they are to make.  I enjoyed the filling and may use it between different cookies.  Also, this recipe made about 50 sandwich cookies!!!  I'd recommend scaling it down the first time you make them so you can tell if you like them or not.

I haven't tried the cookie part of this recipe yet (Sorry!), but I have used the filling recipe several times.  It is absolutely amazing-I love to make sandwich cookies, this filling is my favorite to use!  It is easy to make up and keeps well-but most importantly, it tastes fabulous.  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

Wow! SUPER yum-o!!! These are simply fantastic and obviously a hidden gem on here.... With only 37 reviews and a 4 star rating, these have not received the justice they deserve. This is a pretty fool-proof recipe, however, attention to detail is a MUST if presentation is of concern to you. To ensure a perfect looking cookie, drop heaping teaspoonfuls of batter onto your baking sheet and smooth with the back of a spoon. Keep in mind that these cookies WILL spread, so be sure to account for that (I used medium-sized baking sheets and fit 8 cookies onto each one). One final observation. It is ABSOLUTELY necessary to lightly grease your cookie sheets (my first batch was a little tricky to remove and MUCH easier after my baking sheets were greased). With this being the ONLY exception, If you carefully follow Lisa's instructions, you'll be pleasantly surprised. Lisa's 7-8 minute baking timeframe was SPOT on (my cookies were done in 7 minutes). NOTE: If you are expecting a sweet cookie, this is not the recipe for you. The cookie itself is only mildly sweet. The filling is the crowning (sweet) touch. For a fun twist, I topped each "sandwich" with a small dollop of cream filling and topped that with a maraschino cherry. Too cute! Thanks for sharing your recipe, Lisa. These will be added to my holiday cookie tray for sure! :-)

The cookies were a bit bland, which would have been fine since the frosting was so rich, but they didn't spread out into lovely little round cake shapes. I dropped rounded teaspoons with plenty of room, but they didn't spread at all, they just cooked in little lumps. I tried to flatten them out pre-baking, which was hard because the dough was so gooey, and they were bigger and rounder, but still not what I was looking for. They were better dipped in the frosting than sandwiched.

Tasty!  Love the frosting.  But I didn't like how soft the cookies were -- they fell apart far too easily.

I added semisweets to the cookie batter and green food coloring to the filling, and they came out great!

Not what I was looking for.  As mentioned before, they did not spread, they puffed up.  Perhaps the baking powder should have been baking soda???  The filling sounds great but will use it another time.

I made these cookies for my office christmas potluck and everyone loved them.  I went with the written suggestions and used peppermint extract and crushed peppermint candy.  I only came across one problem.  The recipe lists the quantity as 2 dozen - but I ended up with around 6 dozen.  I don't think I did anything wrong - but who knows.  They all still got eaten, so it all worked out!

These are nice soft cookies.  The cookie itself has a flavor and texture similar to a brownie.  Tasty and easy to make. =)

4 stars because the cookie part almost burned and the cookies weren't very sweet. i turned down the oven heat to 360 and it was better. also, the cookies stick to the pan, so i sprayed them then had no problems...

When frozen, these taste a lot like an ice cream sandwich.  They can be a bit messy when putting them together, but are worth it!
