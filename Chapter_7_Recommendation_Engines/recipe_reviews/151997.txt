Yummy!  It does have a bit of a kick (equivilant of say, a 3 star), so I'd suggest backing down on the cayenne a tad if you can't tolerate the heat.  This is the first indian dish I haven't bombed thus far.... so I definately count this as an easy meal!  Relatively cheap, too.  If you already have all of the spices on hand, the rest of the ingredients add up to about $10.  ***updated***  I previously forgot to mention that I omit the garam masala (it changes the flavor and I like it better without).  Additionally, cutting the cayenne pepper by about half allows one to be able to taste the wonderful flavors instead of mostly just feeling the heat.  Hope this helps!

This was a good recipe. The next time I make it, I will not add the garam masala. As the dish cooked, it smelled great, just like traditional Aloo Gobi, up until I added the garam masala. The masala overtook the rest of the flavors and altered the dish. I also used only half the required cayenne and still found it way too spicy. Otherwise, a tasty dish.

I used about half of the cayenne that the recipe called for and it was the perfect heat for me. I served it over quinoa. Even though I diced my potatoes small, it took almost an hour for them to cook through.

This is GOOD.  It would be 5 stars, but it was too spicy!  I halved the amount of cayenne, and should have reduced it even more.  I knew better, but what can I say, I'm just an idiot.  I didn't use an entire can of coconut milk either, as I wanted to see if it needed all those extra calories.  It didn't; it was plenty creamy and saucy with just half the can.  I will definitely make this again, but reduce the cayenne even more.  Great recipe!

I loved this!My family and I enjoyed this a lot! It didn't have the heat I was expecting though, which surprised me with the ingredient list. But for my first time making this particular dish I was very pleased! Thanks for the great recipe! : ) ***update*** made this again and it had much more heat..maybe used old cayenne last time, not sure... but thought I'd mention it... so yummy one of my favs from this site! : )

A very good vegetarian curry, especially if your feeding a big (or very hungry!) family. I made a few adaptions, i used half/half natural yoghurt and vegetable stock instead of coconut milk,  left out the cinnamon, and added the garam masala at stage two. I will make again, next time with lots of chopped fresh coriander for extra oomph.

This was really good . . . like Alicia I love a saucy curry and though Aloo Gobi is meant to be a dry curry, I liked this wetter version a lot.  I can't put my finger on it but there was something missing from this recipe.  It was really good and I will make it again and play with the spices a bit (definitely cut back the garam masala and the cayenne too if you don't want it too hot!).  I think I may saute the spices next time with the onions and garlic, maybe that will bring out their flavor more?  The heat of the cayenne seems to overpower the other flavors here.  I also agree that the full can of coconut milk is a bit much, it probably does only need half unless you like it really wet/saucy.  Overall, we really enjoyed this!  And it made A LOT of food~have frozen half to see how well it keeps for a future meal!  And there's still plenty left for lunch today.  So great as this was a very inexpensive meal to make.  Served with basmati rice and naan, great dinner!  Thanks!!

Excellent with a ton of flavour! As many others commented, I scaled the cayenne WAY back, used only 1 teaspoon - I can't imagine what a full tablespoon would taste like, pretty sure it would completely overwhelm this recipe!  I also used ground cumin as I didn't have any seeds and then only used about two thirds of the can of coconut milk and about one tablespoon of the garam masala at the end (also as other reviewers noted).  Very yummy and great for leftovers :)

When I was reading the recipe, I said to myself; "A TBSP of salt? Really?" But yes, a TBSP of salt. Really. It's all that salt that really opens up your taste buds and then ALL that cayenne makes you want to cry from the fire-hot sensation coated across your tongue. To be clear, I didn't mind this dish, but I agree that there is something not quite right about the spices. The salt should be cut at least half and that a TBSP of cayenne is waaay too much. Honestly, I'd probably only add a TSP since all you can taste is heat past the first bite. Garam Masala is pretty much just an exact repeat of the spices that are already in this dish, but it also has some clove and nutmeg. I didn't mind it, but it's not a necessity for this dish. UPDATE: Okay... I was totally dreading the leftovers, but I enjoyed this WAY more after it had been sitting in the fridge for a couple of days. The flavours worked a lot better, but it was still too salty and too hot. I decided to try this dish again. Given how saucy the dish is, it is perfectly adaptable to the slowcooker. Follw step 1,  then everything into the slowcooker. Frozen cauliflower and potatoes slightly smaller than 1" cubes on high for 5 hrs cooked everything to the point that some was stuck on the the sides. Could have cut cook time to 4 hrs and been fine. Used about 1 tsp salt and about 1 tsp cayenne and used the garam masala. Much preferred the heat, but had to add salt after cooking. Great to be able to do this in the slowcooker :)

How can potato and cauliflower taste so delicious!!!  Made this as part of an Indian dinner last night, for me it was the star attraction.  I followed the recipe without making any changes, the only difference was I did not add the Garam Masala.  I wanted too, even had it out of the spice cupboard and just simply forgot.  All I can say is that I got so excited by the smell that I was trying to get it served too quickly.

I've tried all different Aloo Gobi recipes off of the internet, this one's my favorite.  I didn't have cumin seeds so I just used ground cumin.  Used only 1T of garam masala.  Threw in the spices after I sauted the garlic for a minute to toast the spices.  I used sweet potatoes, cut into small cubes to speed up cooking time.  I cooked those first for about 30 min. before I threw in the cauliflower.  I didn't have a whole head of cauliflower so I supplemented with broccoli.   I am an Indian food lover, and this recipe is a keeper.

This was very good. As others have suggested, I omitted the garam masala and cinnamon, cut the salt in half and added only a teaspoon of cayenne pepper as well as half a teaspoon of crushed red pepper. I then sprinkled a generous amount of paprika on top of the cauliflower and potatoes then simply baked them at 400°F for about 45 minutes (or until a fork nicely pierces through a potato), stirring once. For a lighter coconut milk, I purchased Mae Ploy coconut milk from the Thai supermarket(which was quite cheap) and used about 2/3 cup mixed with a cup of unsweetened almond milk which added the right amount of creaminess. Light coconut milk is really JUST full fat coconut milk dilluted with water. Lastly, I served this with quinoa and naan bread that was lightly toasted with minced garlic and topped with fresh chopped parsley. So delicious and so easy!

Thank you for this recipe Alicia.  This was very easy and had some good flavor.  I used fresh ginger because I had it on hand, and suggest definitely using all of the cayenne...I didn't think it had enough heat so I even added some more at the end.  I added some frozen peas a couple of minutes before the dish was done which added some nice color.  I was nervous that there wouldn't be enough liquid because my veggies and potatoes came right up to the top of the liquid in the pan, but it came out great.  Make sure you cut your potato cubes all the same size, and I suggest not draining the canned tomatoes.  Will definitely make again, thanks!

Liked this one! Fun to cook and even more fun to eat. We modified it by using far less salt (a dash rather than a tablespoon) as well as a lot less oil. It's slightly too spicy -- I'd turn down the heat the next time. But was definitely well received around here!

This was pretty good, but I'm not too sure on the amount of servings.  I think it's way more than 4 servings, in fact, I couldn't use all the cauliflower and potatoes that I had cut up (it wouldn't all fit!)  I also just used curry powder to taste instead of all the individual spices.  Used light coconut milk to cut down on fat/calories.  Not my favorite Indian dish, but we enjoyed it.  Thanks!

Yum! If you love spicy food like my family does, don't alter the amount of cayenne pepper. It was perfect. My fiance and I are vegans, and we have several vegetarians in our family. I brought this to Christmas dinner as the vegetarian entree and received rave reviews. I will definitely make this again.

This is a great Indian recipe for the timid cook! Very easy directions, and pretty cheap ingredients, apart from the coriander and garam masala, which I omitted. I added a little curry powder, increased the cumin to 2 tsp (ground), used tiny red potatoes to make it cook faster, and used broccoli instead of cauliflower.

Followed the recipe for the most part, but added some almond milk rather than coconut milk to cut the calories. By the end of the simmering period, the sauce had thickened up considerably so I think any dairy or cream-like substance could easily be substituted. I also forgot the cauliflower and used 15 oz of re-hydrated garbanzos. Per many a reviewer, also left out the garam masala and halved the cayenne. Still had a nice kick, but could taste the depth of flavor well. Also, only used a little bit of salt as I am not a fan of really salty tomato-based dishes. Fairly quick, easy and could be made in a larger batch for more people.

I don't think adding Garam Masala at the end should alter the flavor very much at all. This recipe already has a ton of Garam Masala spices in it, as Garam Masala is typically made of cinnamon, cumin, coriandor, nutmeg, and  cardamom (and sometimes other spices). That being said, I felt like I put more spices in this dish that I have ever put in any dish in my whole life! But they tasted great.

I made this for dinner last night alongside Chicken Tikka Masala (also from this site), basmati rice and grilled naan, we really enjoyed the end result. I used ground cumin in place of the cumin seeds because that's what I had on hand, I omitted the turmeric because our local grocery store didn't have any, I reduced the amount of cayenne to about 3/4 tsp (kids don't like things spicy). I also omitted the beans and the garam masala (based on other reviews) and the end result was really good! The only change I will make next time is to stew everything together and only add the cauliflower for the last 30 minutes or so (I should note that I stewed mine for about 90 minutes).

I would give this recipe five stars except that the cooking time is very, very, very wrong.  At 5pm, I reduced heat to low (step 3) and covered it.  At 6pm, I went to check to see if the potatoes were done.  They were completely raw.  I turned up the heat to a 3 (medium-low) and covered it again.  At 7:30pm, my husband and I ate it but without our son.  We had to put him to bed after an instant Mac 'N Cheese dinner.  Even after it cooked for two and a half hours (most of which was done on a higher temp than the recipe called for), my husband said it would have been better if it was cooked longer.  

The flavors were great, but it's upsetting to have to wait hours to eat dinner when you're not expecting it.  I'll make this again because it was delicious, but I'll cook it on medium-low for 2-3 hours next time (instead of low for the first hour).  

I should add that I followed the recipe exactly except that I only put in a dash of salt, and I skipped the cayenne pepper because I just didn't see it in the recipe list.  I did use the masala.  The flavors were great.

Delicious! Very spicy, which I like, but next time will try significantly reducing the Cayenne pepper in an effort to make it kid friendly.

Hailing from an Indian family, we grew up eating the more traditional (dry) version of this sabji (in Gujarati, it's called bataaka-phulaaver nu shaak).  I was hesitant to depart from tradition but, the end product, with the coconut milk (we used light!) and tomato sauce was delicious!  Once you've added the cauliflower/potatoes/chickpeas, don't worry if it seems like there isn't enough liquid for everything to cook--it WILL cook and the liquids will sufficiently cook/absorb all the raw veggies.  I'll definitely make this again!

The spicing in this dish was lovely! I decreased the turmeric by half, and used fresh ginger. The heat is definitely not for the faint of heart! I had to decrease it for my family members(though I am slowly building up their tolerance to capsaicin, heh heh). Next time I will omit the coconut milk.  I find that its delicate fresh flavour is lost in the assertive seasoning in this recipe. I will be making this again! Thank you for sharing, Alicia!

This was yum!  I'm not really big into Indian food, but was searching for recipes with a lot of turmeric.  It's supposed to help prevent alzheimer's, which runs in my family.  Anyhow, the only changes I made was to cut the cayenne in half, left out cardamom because I didn't have any, and left out garam masala, because it seemed perfect!  It was spicy for me, so I added a dollop of sour cream (like someone else mentioned) and it was SO good over rice.  Thanks!

This is a great recipe!  My fiancee and I loved it!  I didn't deviate very much from what was described.  However, I didn't have coriander, so I added a little extra cumin and some caraway seeds.  I also only had whole cardamom seeds, so I shelled them and ground them down a little bit before adding to the recipe.  This meant that there were little chunks of cardamom floating around - since I really really like cardamom, I was fine with that, but if you don't like it make sure to use ground cardamom as the recipe states.  Heat is neat, so I used a lot of cayenne, but as others have mentioned, be careful.  No cauliflower on hand, so used some broccoli and some peas (mutter!).  It's important to let this recipe simmer for a long time in order to get the right consistency; it should be thick and easily scoopable, not runny at all.  When it's simmering, make sure to stir frequently and scrape the bottom of the pan.  Otherwise you will end up with pasty or burned food underneath a layer of soup.  The only change I would potentially advocate would be adding maybe 1tbsp of honey; we both felt that it could have benefited from a touch of sweetness.  Delicious, fairly easy, and highly recommended.

I doubled the recipe but only had one can of diced tomatoes and it still worked well.  I personally thought it was too spicy, but the others of my family thought it was just right spice wise.  Served it with the Slow Cooker Butter Chicken recipe on this site, and also the Basmatti Rice recipe also from this site.  Over all the Indian themed meal was a huge success!

Can you see the smoke coming out of my mouth? This recipe is very hot. I love spices, but when something is so hot that burning is all you experience. This is said with cutting the cayenne down to 1 tsp from 1 tbsp., adding 1/2 cup of whipping cream and  tice the amount of diced tomato and a tbsp. of honey! I could eat it if I topped it with a lot of plain yogurt and I could taste the lovely spices underneath the hot, but most of it will be in the trash, unfortunately. I would do this again but with  only half  a teaspoon of cayenne. You can always add more spice, but you can't take it away.

Just realized that I mis-read the salt content.  I used 1 tsp instead of 1 tbsp...you will need the 1 tbsp. for it to taste right. A teaspoon is not enough. Otherwise, my previous rating still stands.

loved it. didn't add garam masala b/c didn't have any and it didn't matter: this was awesome. i liked the cayenne kick. next time, i will try what others suggested and use less coconut milk (perhaps try yogurt instead) to see what a less wet consistency is like. thanks for the awesome meal! :) i have a lot left over so i will experiment with freezing as well.

Hmmm.... This was just "OK" for me. To my surprise, my cauliflower-hating husband liked this quite a bit. For me, this was very one dimensional. The spiciness of the cayenne (which I halved, btw) was all I could taste. This is not at all what I expected, especially given all of the wonderful spices called for. I also didn't find this "wet" at all.... Actually, I had quite the opposite experience. After simmering on low for 45 minutes, my curry was very dry (much like traditional aloo gobi). This had absolutely no bearing on my rating, but I do want to point out that my curry didn't turn out at all as I thought it would. Served over jeera / cumin rice (MEDHALEE) with a side of naan, this was an allright meal. If for nothing else, I at least convinced my hubs that cauliflower isn't SO bad after all. :-) Thanks anyways, Alicia.

Wonderful, easy recipe.  I only used 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper, but otherwise followed the recipe.  After reading other reviews, I tasted it before adding the garam masala at the end, and chose to add it.  It is even better a couple days later.

This was my first attempt at cooking Indian food. Thank you Alicia!  My husband said that if all vegetables tasted like this (i.e., the cauliflower), he would eat them more often!  Now, on to an Indian eggplant recipe....

I reduced the salt and oil, but everything else was perfect. Servers more like 8 - goes perfectly with naan. Thanks!

The only knock is that it is TOO spicy for me.  I put the whole tablespoon in because I like to follow the original recipe.  The garam masala was added at the end as well and I thought it was fine.  The sauce would be perfect without all of that pepper.  Chick peas, potatoes and cauliflower are three of my favorite curry vegetables.

An all time favorite.  I haven't found anyone who doesn't love it! I double the spices.  Half the salt.  Add a generous portion of raisins and blanched almonds.  You can also use sweet potato if you don't have regular potatoes.  I also used frozen cauliflower with no issues.  Freezes well and so yummy with naan bread.

Made exactly. Bit bland for our tastes, and we do not usually eat anything salty, so I'm not sure what happened there. Heat was good, but not our favorite curry out there. Thanks!

Wow!  We absolutely loved this dish!    I used only a shy teaspoon of cayenne and that gave it some heat without being overpowering.   Also cut back a little on the cinnamon, a lot on the salt (one tablespoon of salt would have made this way too salty, I think) and cut back on the cardamom only because I had none ground and got tired of picking out the seeds for grinding my own.   I probably used 1-1/2 tablespoons of minced garlic.  The flavors seemed just right before adding the garam masala, so I didn't use any.   And because the teenager turns his nose up at a main dish without meat, I chopped up a previously cooked chicken breast and tossed it in to warm up at the end.   Still, one chicken breast for five good-sized servings is quite economical and was plenty.  If I were making this without the chicken, I might want to add an extra can of garbanzo beans.  Or maybe not.  It was pretty darn perfect just the way it was.

This made way more than I expected and I didn’t even like it very much. For the leftovers I’m going to make rice to try to lessen the strong taste. It’s too strong this way.

I LOVE this. I have another Aloo Gobi recipe that I've made before and really loved, but I didn't have all the ingredients for it, so I dug up another. THIS IS GREAT. 

Some notes: 
I didn't have any garbanzos/chickpeas. So I added about a cup of raw cashews I had lying around instead. Highly recommend! Cashews cook really nicely in slow cookers. 

I added more potatoes than it called for, and used russets. I just basically like to make sure the slow cooker is pretty full when I use it, so I just added as many potatoes as it took. 

I didn't have any coriander somehow, so I just omitted. It was still great!

I only added maybe a teaspoon of cayenne. I like a bit of heat, but a tablespoon is an awful lot

I've made this many times and it's always a hit.  If I'm watching carbs, I'll omit the potatoes and I've also made it with eggplant.  It's a great meal if you have guests that are vegetarian and you can dial down the spice if necessary.  No changes needed...great recipe!

As per previous feedback, less cayenne (1 tsp) halved the garam masala, omitted the coconut milk and used a 28 oz can of tomatoes as my liquid. My husband is not into vegetarianism but loved this recipe. Will definitely make it again. Potatoes, even cut small will not cook in one hours. I simmered it all afternoon and the potatoes were nicely done. Nice filling warm meal for a cold Canadian winter!

First time making anything like this.  I followed suggestions and cut the cayenne way back. Very yummy and flavorful and I will cut the cayenne even further next time to maybe 1/2 tsp!  I too left out the garam masala just because I didn't like it one other time in a hot tea drink I made.  This was delicious and I will definitely make it again.  My 15 year old daughter loved it and is putting some in her lunch tomorrow with brown rice. Thanks!

I made it and it seemed to be missing something -- so close!  So, I just added a tsp. of sugar to the sauce and it's perfect!  I always use Penzey's spices, which I think make the difference.

This was really easy and yummy.  The only reason I gave it 4-stars is because 1 Tbsp of Cayenne would have been way too much for us.  I used 1 tsp and it was just right, and still had a little kick.  I will definitely be making again. The hubby and the 6 y.o. were happy too.

So good! I halved the cayenne pepper and garam masala as other reviewers suggested and also took it easy on the salt, and it tasted great to me. Besides that, I followed the recipe. Will definitely make again!

Followed the recipe with the exception of lowering the salt.  I regretted it, this is a huge dish and it needs the salt.  I wish I had added the cauliflower 20 minutes or so after the potatoes.  Ensuring the potatoes were cooked made the cauliflower overdone.  Oh and I only used half teaspoon of cayenne so my kids would eat it (they did!)

Great recipe! I also add carrots and frozen peas and cut the cayenne down to about 1/4 tablespoon simply because I can't take the heat called for in the recipe. This is also a great freezer meal. I have used it twice now for camping meals as well - just put frozen portions on ice in the cooler and heat up over the camp stove - YUM! Perfect to warm the bones. Also, really great with a good dry hard cider.

I'm normally pretty skeptic about making vegetarian dishes because the often end up relatively bland, but this one is awesome. I made this and a chicken tikka masala for a dinner party, and I ate a ton more of this than the chicken one. And it makes a lot of food. I only put in maybe a half of what they suggested for the cayenne pepper though, just to make sure I didn't overpower it. Super delicious.

Do to other reviews I used only half of the Garam Masala and used very little Cayene pepper. It turned out great.I served it over rice with Spinach Paner and Nam bread. A great meal.

Watch out fellow weaklings! I usually ask for a level 3 when we go out to our favorite Indian restaurant so I cut the Cayenne pepper to 1 tsp and used only 1 tbsp of garam masala.  My husband loves it and says it is equivalent to a level 7 (with the adjustments I made).  My mouth is on fire.....wishing we weren't a vegan household at the moment and I had some milk in the fridge!

Loved this, it was easy to make and quite flavorful, however it was a little too hot. I love spicy food, but next time I will tone it dow a little. Can't wait to eat the leftovers. I'm sure it will taste even better today!

Used Penzeys "The Now Curry" for easier/quick prep as it contains a mixture of the spices listed and is heavier on the cumin that other preps led curry mixtures.  Also substituted purple cauliflower for a pop of color and added carrots.  Family enjoyed.  Will definitely make this again.

This was okay.  Based on other reviews I cut the garam masala back to half at the end but it was still too much. It gave the dish a bit of a funk.

I followed the recipe except replaced the coconut milk with yogurt, and I did not use the cardamon.   Also, I used canola oil instead of olive oil since I usually associate olive oil with Italian cooking and not Indian cooking.  I did think the recipe is potato heavy so I would use two or one potatoes in the future.  My cauliflower did not maintain its form and turned into mush.  I am wondering if the cauliflower should be cooked separately and added to the dish when it is almost done.  The potatoes should be cut on the smaller side.  On the plus side, it was flavorful.

This recipe turned out wonderful!  Strange how we are all different because the cooking time stated in this recipe was sufficient.  I added all the spices except the garam masala and I really enjoyed the taste of this creamy vegetarian dish.  Keep in mind to just adjust all the spices and salt to what you think you'd like, you can always add more salt and cayenne so start out with a little and go from there.  The rest of the spices, I went to town on because they're so good for you anyway.  This recipe is so flexible, I felt like a real cook after making and enjoying it!  Thanks so much Alicia, great job.

Thank you! This recipe totally nails it.  I used crushed green cardamom pods as I didn't have any ground and it was so fragrant! Added poppy seeds to thicken as I saw another recipe with them.

Wow, this was fantastic. I did drop the red pepper to about half, which gave it the kick I needed (more would have been too much for me). On accident, I added two cans on garbanzo beans (don't ask how), but it was still wonderful. I loved this so much I kept complimenting the chef (me) as we ate. LOL!

Followed this recipe to the T except I used fresh tomatoes and added peas. It was delish! And even better 2 days later. Don't skimp on the salt! I was also iffy about the full tbsp of salt. Tasted much too salty at first but once it had time to simmer it was perfect.  And do add the masala garam at the end. It tastes so unfinished without it! This will not disappoint.

Love it!  Turned out just as good as the Indian restaurant we go to.  It IS very spicy/hot, so I would recommend using half as much cayenne.  But if you like it super hot, then go ahead.

Loved this dish!  Made it twice so far.  The first time I made this dish, I made it just as written, except cutting the cayenne down to 1/2 tsp.  I was making this for my family, which include a 2 and 4 year old, and a Tbsp of cayenne would have been way too spicy!  We loved it!  The only problem was how long it took to cook down the potatoes (about 1 hr 20 mins for 1 in cubed potatoes).  The second time I made it, I made it I cut the potatoes much smaller (about 1/2 in cubed), which cut down the cooking time, and added peas about 20 mins in (for color).  To garnish, we used fresh bean sprouts for texture, and fresh cilantro.  Love the cilantro with these flavors.  I know a lot of people substituted the coconut milk because of the fat, but I feel like it added a lot to the flavors of the dish.  You can always skim off the fat of a sitting can of coconut milk, or buy the "lite" version, but I suggest using it! :)

I love this dish and have made it several times now.  I found the first time that my cauliflower would overcook before the potatoes would finish, so I now microwave the cut up potatoes for four minutes or so before tossing them in the pot and everything comes out at the same time.   Great base  dish, you can add pretty much anything.  I like to add cut up mushrooms and peas.

This is a pretty good recipe, but a bit too salty. I cut way down on the cayenne; though I like some heat, my husband does not and I ended up using about 1/3 tsp, which was warm enough for him. I had Aloo Gobi at a fabulous Indian restaurant, and it was rich and creamy and flavorful. This recipe seems to be missing something to me. Perhaps the chick peas should be mashed to thicken the liquid? I'll likely make it again, but I will modify the recipe.

So good and authentic tasting! I didn't have canned tomatoes or coconut milk so I just used a fresh tomato, salt, and just enough regular milk and water to steam the cauliflower. I also left out the cinnamon, cardamom and ginger and it still tastes amazing! My husband and son thought it tasted like an Indian restaurant we love. Definitely a keeper! I also didn't use potato and used peas instead of chickpeas.

Delicious served over jasmine rice.  I subbed an extra potato or two in place of the garbanzo beans, and I cooked mine in a slow cooker on high for 4 hours.  It still had a faint over-spiced, powdery taste/texture which could be due to the method of cooking not quite having the same effect as a stovetop.  Still, it was delicious and my meatatarian husband was a fan.  Plus, it filled our house with a wonderful curry aroma that made our mouths water.  I will make this again!  Edited to add: I put the coconut milk in with everything else and had no issues with separating, so no worries!

This is quite tasty. I didn't make it exactly as indicated (left out the coconut milk, used water instead) and had planned to use yogurt in addition but it didn't need it. Used half the salt and only a pinch of cayenne and it was great!

I'm so happy I found this recipe, I've made it so many times! The spice level is perfect (1 tablespoon cayenne - yes!) as is everything else about the recipe. I wouldn't change it a bit. Everyone I've made it for, including myself, has a hard time eating aloo ghobi anywhere else because this version of it is so good. As a tip, I pick up these spices in bulk from my local middle eastern market, which saves on costs compared to buying from local grocery stores.

We thought this was great!  We used sweet potatoes and omitted the last 2 T of garam masala as suggested by some reviewers but thought it could have used that extra kick of spice.  The sweet potatoes were excellent, though!

Although it wasn't what I had expected, this version of aloo gobi was quite good. Once past the too hot spice of the full tablespoon of cayenne pepper, all of the flavors come together and make a smooth, enjoyable curry-like dish. The aloo gobi I've had before didn't use coconut milk I don't think, so it was without a sauce - and I knew the coconut milk would make it saucy but the recipe was so highly rated I really wanted to try it. I'll make it again for sure, with a little less cayenne.

HOLY SODIUM BOMB BATMAN, this was yummy, and about an hour after eating I was chugging water.  It never occurred to me that a TABLESPOON of salt was a lot for four servings.  So, yum, but watch out for the sodium, it comes in at OVER 2000 mg per serving - a double Quarter Pounder with Cheese from McDonalds only has 1280.  Does anyone else wonder, upon closer scrutiny, if the salt and cayenne are typos?  For me, the second time out I used a little over a teaspoon of salt, and a teaspoon of cayenne and it was spicy, but not incendiary, and I used ground cumin (all of my curries start with toasting seeds and then grinding) which added a great depth. Those who hadn't tried the first round licked their plates, I put salt out, no one reached for it.  Don't get me wrong, it's really excellent, but I'm watching the sodium, so always looking for subs.  Love the coconut milk!

2 adults and 1 child loved it. 10 year old wasn't as thrilled. I cut the cayenne in 1/2, but was told it should be hotter. I think this will be even more awesome tomorrow after the flavors marinate. Thank you! Served over brown rice.

Sheesh our mouths were burning, next time will half the cayenne! But wonderful authentic flavor. Also I used a coconut, chia almond milk combo milk to cut down the fat and you couldn't tell.  Used ginger powder and ground cumin as didn't have those others on hand.  Wonderful and thank you for posting this!!!

My husband is Indian and I cook a lot of Indian food and I did not like this recipe.  The spices are really heavy and not in the right proportions.  A Tbs of Tumeric and cayanne is way too much.  As is the  2 tbs of Garam Masala at the end.  Actually, all the spices are too much except for the cumin and coriander.  I do like the idea of a wet coconut based masala and will try that with a more traditional aloo gobi recipe next time.

I've made this twice now, with positive comments both times! In a crowd that has a meat-free eater, a dairy-free one, and a gluten-free one, this recipe satisfies them all. I haven't yet worked up to the full amount of cayenne, but am working on it!

Warning:   This is super HOT!  I decreased the cayenne to one teaspoon and it's still very hot.  I will try again with even less cayenne next time.  Other than that adjustment, it is very nice.  The texture and variety of spices are great.

My first time making curry, after loving it in restaurants for years--GREAT recipe to follow and tweak as you like, which I think is the fun of it!

I needed to use a yellow squash, so I did that instead of potatoes. To start, I mostly followed the recipe (although I just did the salt and cayenne to taste throughout the cooking process). I added all of the spices (except masala) a step sooner than the liquids to get the flavors going. Once I added all the veggies (my cauliflower was HUGE), one can of coconut milk did not seem like enough liquid for me. I added about 10 oz of water; then I covered it and let things cook.

My stove is not so nuanced when it comes to heat (and I was impatient to eat!), so I had it simmering on medium heat rather than low as the recipe says. After finding another can of coconut milk, I added about 6 oz more of that. 

Once the cauliflower was al dente, I tasted things and went to work with adjustments because things were pretty bland. I ended up adding the same amount of spices all over again (except not as much cinnamon)--at this point simmering with the lid off. I used only half of the masala as I quite liked the flavors by the end.

A few other tweaks: about 2 tsp of yellow curry powder, a good two handfuls of cilantro leaves (just before serving), and--bear with me--about 1/2 cup of dried (sweetened) coconut flakes. I agreed with one reviewer that it needed a little sweetness, plus I LOVE coconut in Indian dishes. We loved the end product!

Delightfully spicy with only 1 teaspoon of cayenne.  Will probably take the salt down to 1 teaspoon next time too.  I found it to be a bit too salty when I used 1 tablespoon of salt.  Taste testing while it was cooking and liked it more before the garam marsala was added; I will probably delete the garam marsala from the recipe next time.  But there will be a next time!  Thanks for sharing!

I found it odd that this does not call for curry powder so I added 2 TBSP of yellow curry powder.  I also cut the cayenne in half and added some diced chicken.  loved it!!!!

This was really good!  On recommendation of some other reviewers, I also left out the garam masala and it turned out just right.  The chickpeas become so creamy!  Will definitely make this again.

I read a lot of reviews before making this, so I cut the cayenne in half and skipped the garam masala alotgether, since almost every ingredient in garam masala is already in the recipe.   I didn't have cumin seeds, so I used 1/4 tsp ground cumin and I didn't have turmeric so I skipped that, too.  We ate it over basmati rice and it was yummy!!  Still a little spicy but not overpowering.  I considered a dollop of plain yogurt, but it didn't need it.

Great flavour! Very tasty and hard to stop at just one serving. Since it was our first time, I decided to reduce the cayenne pepper to 1 tbsp and I am happy I did. It had just the right amount of heat. The full amount would make this equivalent to a Vindaloo in heat. Next time I will hold back the cauliflower for 10 minutes so that it doesn't crumble quite as much, but this is a definite keeper in our house.

Sooo, I just finished my SECOND bowl.  Holy moly do I ever enjoy this!  The ONLY reason I couldn't give it a full 5 stars is that I had everything prepped when I realised that I didn't have coconut milk.  I ended up using twice the tomatoes with an extra cup of water...and it is still delicious.  I will definitely make this again and if happen to be missing the milk again I will be ok with it.

This is awesome - super tasty, perfectly seasoned and very satisfying. Because I didn't have any I left out the garam masala and cumin seeds (but replaced with a bit of ground cumin powder). Also decreased the amount of salt per other suggestions. Otherwise followed this pretty closely. I will definitely make again!

It was pretty tasty. Not sure if I'd make again but very good and cheap dinner. Looking at the recipe, I'm not sure how people got the potatoes and cauliflower to get tender without adding the entire can of coconut milk. I ended up having to add chicken stock to cook my potatoes. I did find out that the "missing ingredient" was lemon juice. Add a little at the end and it cuts through the heaviness of the dish. Served with basmati.

Cooked this tonight for the first time for hubby and college age daughter. We LOVED it! We have a sister-in-law who is from India and she used to always make Aloo Gobi for Christmas dinner and my family said this was just as good as hers! Per reviewers suggestions I used 1 tsp cayenne pepper, skipped garam masala, steamed cauliflower ahead of time and added towards the end. Will definitely make again!!!

This is amazing!  To make it healthier I completely left out the olive oil & coconut milk. In place of the liquid (coconut milk) to give the ingredients a place to boil, I just added water. I used regular potatoes, which worked fine. I steamed the cauliflower separately and throw it in at the end to ensure it wouldn't overcook (I have struggled with this in the past). I also added chopped carrots & a can of drained peas. Per the recommendations of others, I left out the garam masala.  It was perfect!  I also recommend cooking this recipe a few days before eating it and just keeping it in the fridge - that allows for the spices to settle in much better.  Growing up on my aunts' Indian food, this recipe is PERFECT!!!

This was very good!  I just had Aloo Gobi for the first time at a local Indian restaurant and decided I had to try it at home.  This was very similar to the restaurant recipe.  I did leave out the garam masala based on another review.  Also, I only used about 1/2 the can of coconut milk and 1/2 the cayenne pepper.  This was perfect for us -- very spicy without being overpowering.  However, for authenticity, I'd use the full amount of cayenne called for in this recipe.  The restaurant Aloo Gobi we had was much spicier than this version was using half the cayenne, so 1 Tbsp. is probably just about right for real Aloo Gobi.

This was very tasty but it was knock-your-socks-off spicy!  I like flavorful but this was really hot.  When I make it again, I will leave out the cayenne pepper.  I used cream instead of coconut milk so maybe that made it spicier.

Left out the salt and cinnamon. Used a tsp instead of a tbsp of cayenne. I figured that those who like more spice can always add more later. Used one tbsp of garam masala. I think it was too smokey though and I'd cut it down to 2 tsp next time. Also, I added half a bell pepper for more color.

This wasn't great for us. Based on other reviews I reduced the salt, and left out the garam masala. I also halved the cayenne as my family don't like their food too hot. Although it had some heat to it because of the cayenne, otherwise it was very bland. Not sure where I went wrong.

**UPDATE: made this several times and loved it. But as a working mom of 3 little kids, this could never make the weeknight rotation...Until I found out that I could make it in the CROCK POT. I threw all the ingredients into the crock pot and just let it cook- it turned out fantastic!. I cooked it on low for about an hour but it didn't seem to be cooking fast enough so I turned it to high for 3 more hours and it was perfect. If I had to put it on first thing in the morning I would put it on low and let it cook all day- I think that would work out fine.** Delicious! I followed other reviewers suggestions and skipped the garam masala- I tasted when it was almost ready and we liked it as is. I cut my potatoes rather small, so this cooked up in about 45 minutes. I also followed the reviewer tip to go to an Indian grocer to buy the spices- that was a great way to save $ on the ingredients! Not to mention that the recipe made 3 large servings plus enough for 3 lunches. We served with basmati rice and naan- this is a keeper.

Wonderful! This was delicious. I steamed my potatoes for 10 min prior to putting them into the pan..this way it cooks a little faster.

easy to make and simply delicious.  My husband and I couldn't stop talking about how great this tastes.  We love Indian food, and this has all the lovely flavors and textures of our favorite Indian restaurant.  We love spicy and it's quite spicy.  I didn't have cardamom so I didn't add it and only added half of garam masala.  a little goes a long way.

Excellent, flavorful and a huge hit with the hubby. :)  Be advised, this recipe is incredibly spicy, so those of us with more "Americanized" palates might like to halve or even use a third of the cayenne called for in the recipe.  The rest of the spices can be found cheaply at your local Indian Market.  Finally, I added some chopped cilantro as garnish and served with naan.

I'd give this 5, but the salt level was way too high.  Another reviewer said to cut in half, and I'd agree.  It turned out I didn't have any cumin seeds, but I did have coriander leaf which makes an attractive addition at service.  This is an excellent dish and I highly recommend to those who want a very authentic taste.

it was a delicious dish, yet too spicy for my taste. Instead of a can of coconut milk, i will use coconut creme mixed with water, as it has a more coconuty flavor and mellow down the heat a bit. you can find coconut cream in a yellow box in the international section of your health food store.

This was delicious. I substituted cream of coconut mixed with hot water for coconut milk, and canned crushed tomatoes instead of diced.  It was definitely pretty hot but everybody loved it.

Great recipe. This was my first time making aloo gobi, and it came out wonderfully and kept well. I didn't have garam masala, but I looked up the ingredients online and it turned out I had all the spices listed except saffron (i.e. cumin, coriander, cardamom, peppercorn, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg) so I just added teaspoons of all of them until it tasted like I wanted it to. I omitted the salt because the canned tomatoes and chick peas both come pre-salted, and I don't like a lot of salt.

I didn't have any yukon potatoes on hand, so substituted 2 medium size yams and a handful of fingerlings, cubed to small pieces to the recipe. It was really good. Went great with Roti. My husband said this recipe could compete with the restaurants. Thanks for a great recipe. So easy to make.

I made this dish for an Indian-themed birthday dinner for my husband.  We had 2 vegetarians attending the party and this was a wonderful vegetarian option for our guests.  The first time I made it to test it out before the party I left out some of the salt, but then ended up adding it back in the second time because I thought it needed all the recipe called for.  Also, I added about half the cayenne because we like it more medium than super hot.  Oh, and I didn't have garam masala so I didn't add that, but it tasted great without it!

This was excellent, but I only used about a third of the cayenne pepper that it called for and it was still really spicy - so I would cut back on that unless you like your food REALLY spicy! I served it with basmati rice and naan bread.  I also made sour cream cucumbers as a side dish and the sour cream from that kind of got on this and was really good; so in the future I will probably serve this with either sour cream or make the sour cream cucumbers again.

Spicy, flavorful, and wonderful.  Followed the recipe exactly except for using fresh ginger and omitting the garam masala (at the suggestion of previous reviewers and because it smelled and tasted fabulous without it).  Will be making again soon.

This is good. And SPICY! I cut way back on the pepper, but there's still so much other spice that it'll slap you in the face! I added a little extra garlic, some curry powder, and used fingerling potatoes since I couldn't find Yukon gold for some reason. I served it with coconut basmati rice and chai. Thanks for the keeper! I didn't even realize it was vegan. =)

Holy cow!!! This had a serious spice factor! I am obviously not well accustomed to spicy curries, because this really blew my socks off and I had to down a whole glass of milk. However, everyone loved it (even my meat-n-potatoes parents)! The only thing I didn't add was the garam masala because the store had none. I served it over the Indian Style Basmati Rice from this site and it was yummy. But next time, I'll cut the spices in half and slowly work up to the amount in the recipe.

I found this dish to be delicious.  I didn't have any cardamom on hand, but since there is some in the garam masala, I figured the flavors would still be in the dish.  I cut back on the salt and cayenne a little, but other than that I followed the recipe.  My picky 9 year old said this was tasty.  I will definitely make this again.

I made this dish with a few changes- I opted for vanilla yogurt rather than the coconut milk to lower the fat content, and I added some asparagus. It was a bit spicy, but still fabulous. I served it with some quinoa.

Although it calls for a lot of spices, this recipe is fairly simple to make.  It is a spicy dish so be aware it does have a little kick.  I will definitely make this dish again the taste was unexpected.  Another plus is that its vegetarian.

Great a simple dish. It seemed a bit daunting when i was looking at the recipe but once i got started it flowed together and was a hit. Truly tasted like something from an Indian kitchen.

I didn't like this at all - way too much cardamom and salt.
