I have made this a lot, and it always seems to take longer to me.  I almost have to increase the cooking time by 20 minutes.  I think it might be the frozen vegetables in the covered dish keeping things cool in the oven for a while.  I always test the fish, and the veggies to makes sure it is all good to go.  Basically, I have found when the veggies are hot, the fish is done too!
