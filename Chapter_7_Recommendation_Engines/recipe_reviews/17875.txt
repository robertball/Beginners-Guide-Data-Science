We enjoyed this bread quite a bit.  After reading the other reviews, I added more like 1/2 cup sunflower seeds, and in my machine, this was just right.  It tends to chew up add-ins, and I had planned on adding another 1/4 cup or so during the last 5 minutes of kneading, but fouled up my timer and missed the whole thing!  By adding the extra at the start, I didn't need the last-minute add.  I added 1/2 tsp. salt, and found it to be just a little flat -- a problem that could be solved by sprinkling a little salt on the slice while eating it.  Next batch will have a full tsp. salt.  Loved this one -- thanks for submitting it!
Update: I don't agree with those who thought this was not good the next day.  I'm eating it for breakfast, and it's great!

One of my favorites!  Love the texture.  For a variation, I sometimes add ground flax seeds.

It was interesting. I wasn't sure about the molassas aftertaste at first, but I got used to it. Definitely better as a sandwich bread than served alone. 
The only variation that I used was a cup of whole wheat flour as well. Next time, I might add more sunflower seeds since I felt that they got lost.

Very nice bread, and very hearty!  I like the crunch from the sunflower seeds, and the heartiness from the seeds and the wheat bran.  I didn't change the recipe other than baking in the oven at 375 for 35 mins.  Thanks for the recipe!
