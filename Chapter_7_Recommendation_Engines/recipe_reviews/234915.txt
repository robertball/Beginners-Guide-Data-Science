Tender and moist and just falling off the bone garlic heaven!!! To the person who knocked off points because of the fat- you knew how much fat was in it before you made it! Go look up a diet meal if you are watching your figure.

OMG John! This was Garlic Heaven! We really go through garlic in this house with almost anything we cook; you just made us go through garlic a whole lot faster. We used chicken breasts and followed the recipe exactly. The result was a very moist and savory dish we will make again and again. Thanks Chef John; let the good food times continue to roll! PS.. Fresh Italian Parsley does work to counter that garlic but, if everyone is eating the same dish, who needs it!

I have made this recipe for almost 20 years and I just insert the garlic cloves into the chicken pieces. Then I brown and braise the chicken with a sauce covered in the oven. When the dish is finished I use a stick blender to create the garlic sauce, It is much easier. I usually put pearl onions and baby carrots in the pan while the chicken is braising.

I don't understand why this recipe has such a high fat content when you look at the nutrition guidelines.  I realize that the recipe calls for 2/3 cup of olive oil, but it's a marinade, not all of that oil is going to be consumed.  I've rated this recipe a 3 because of the high fat content, but if the fat content is actually lower, I'd give this a 5.

I have not yet tried this, but can "taste" it in my head.  Wondering two things:  
1) Can I substitute minced garlic from a jar, and
2) Considering using a Ziploc bag to marinate the chicken overnight.  Do you see any problem with that?
Can't wait to try it - off to the grocery store tomorrow for Saturday night's dinner.  
Hooray for garlic!

I made this chicken dish. OMG!!!! My landlady wants me to make it more often because she loves the smell it gives the house. LOL!!! I followed the recipe exactly as shown, except that I forgot to season the chicken with salt and pepper. It is truly a wonderful recipe and I will definitely make it again. For the taste as well as the scent!

I don't know what I did wrong but this recipe did not live up to mine or my husband's expectations.   It had flavour but not worth having to clean my oven after cooking it.   The entire oven had splatters from all the grease.   Certainly do not need to grease the foil with more olive oil - there was plenty of grease/juice from the marinade, in fact too much.  Also 40 - 45 minutes was way too much - should be more like 25-30 minutes.   Will definitely not make this recipe again.

Sadly, I didn't get to try it for myself, but all the guest at my son's birthday party let me know how good it was when 3 whole chickens were gone within an hour.  They didn't eat they chicken; they inhaled!  Made this with the classic rice pilaf (which was gone in 60 seconds as well).

Chicken was moist and tasty. I made extra and froze them. I hope they will turn out as good as fresh ones. Putting just 4 out of 5 stars because there seems to be something missing, I don't know what...

Made it lastnight, but after about 15 minutes of cooking, my apt started smelling smokey, like it was cooking too high. I ended up turning down to 375 & cooking for a little longer. It was good, but very greasy. I am going to try it with boneless/skinless next time. I LOVED the marinade, it smelled amazing! But maybe next time try w/a little less oil.

Oh yea baby! We loved it and it is so easy. I forgot the parsley but added it when we ate the leftovers. The parsley adds even more flavor so I won't forget it when I make this again!

It was easy and very good. I will use the marinade again. I used skinless, boneless breasts. My mistake, but 40 minutes was too long in the oven. The chicken was a little tough, but I will definitely make again.

WOW! This was super flavorful, juicy and the skin was nice and crispy.  I used chicken quarters and didn't have any parsley, but they still tasted great served over steamed white rice.

I was looking for something that would be good for a True Blood-watching party. Lots of garlic seemed like a good match. The only change I made was that I used about 1/8 of a cup of apple cider vinegar in place of the red wine vinegar because it was available.  I used less that the amount called for because I don't like vinegar and usually leave it completely out. I did not let it marinate long enough to bring out all of the garlic goodness, but it was still really good. Next time I will marinate the chicken longer. It was a big hit.

I love garlic but this was way to much. It still had a very raw garlic taste.   Maybe next time I will cook the garlic cloves before hand.

This recipe was OK, not really as garlicky as I thought it would be. Next time, I'll be putting more garlic to the recipe. Would be perfect recipe for someone who likes garlic but does not want to overpower the meal. Thanks for the recipe.

When I first made this, I thought there was way too much oil left in the pan after cooking, and though it was good, it had a "different" taste that I wanted to change somehow.  You might think that 20 cloves is garlicky, but actually I was craving more garlic. So the next time I made it, I halved the oil and the the vinegar, didn't put in the rosemary (b/c I think it made it have a "different" taste the first time) , and instead of 20 cloves  I put in around 30-35 cloves. Really good!

I like garlic but this was gross. The garlic did not mellow, it was sharp and over powering. Threw it out.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I used skin on bone in breasts and marinated overnight. Also used 1/3 cup of olive oil in the marinade instead of 2/3 and it tasted great that way. If you love  garlic you will really enjoy this chicken.

Turned out moist, flavorful and not too strong on the garlic scale.  I did add salt and pepper to the marinade, but that's the only change.

oh wow - this was amazing! i chose this recipe today several hours before i would be making dinner so of course i didn't have the chance to marinate this overnight. it didn't matter. in the couple of hours that it did marinate, it made the chicken so flavorful! the skin was slightly crispy and the chicken was so juicy. 
the changes i made were - i used only thighs (preference) and instead of the different herbs listed, i used herbs de provence.  
thanks chef john for a great dish!!

The chicken was moist, and the skin crunchy.  (I used bone-in chicken thighs.)  It did not have as much garlic  flavor as I hoped, even though I marinated it for 24 hours.  The recipe is extremely easy so I will try it again.  I want to add more garlic, less oil, and a little less vinegar - which I think is obscuring some of the garlic taste.  I may try cooking it in the marinade.

I followed this recipe exactly as it states. The only thing I did different was to add a very thinly sliced lemon to the marinade which I baked along with the chicken. The recipe fills your home with a wonderful garlic, chicken aroma and the addition of the lemon add a touch of elegance as well as flavor.

It wasn't bad, but no where near the flavor I expected. Followed recipe as written, and even let the chicken merinade a bit longer.  I was so looking forward to this being a great recipe, because I really like garlic, but it fell a little flat in my opinion.

It was bland, and quite frankly the flavor was just odd.  We absolutely love garlic in our household as well, but this just tasted funny.  I hate it, but I won't be making this again.  It did make the house smell delicious, and it looked beautiful.  But that's it.

I just made this recipe today and am sorry to say I was disapointed.  There was no garlic flavor in the chicken at all.  It was just plain old chicken.  The marinade smelled great while I made it but the chicken did not have the flavor at all.  Maybe if the marinade was cooked on the stove top and then used as a sauce over the cooked chicken you would get more flavor.

Agree with other reviews. It needed something. Not very flavorful considering all the spices and garlic. I only baked 1/2 the chicken that was marinated. I froze the rest for later use. Next time I will brown in pan and finish off in oven with a nice tomatoe sauce. Perhaps add some sautéed onion and peppers.

This is by far the best chicken recipe I have ever tried. It was so tender juicy and of course garlicky. Really easy to prepare and I added a side of Linguine which was a nice compliment to the chicken. If you love garlic as I do you'll love this recipe. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe. *****

This is DELISH!  Funny thing my blender broke so I used my Nutri Bullet which created a smooth marinade!   I sparingly added Badia Complete seasoning to skinless chicken breasts before adding the marinade and before baking.  The results was  super moist chicken with garlicky goodness... MMMMM!

It was okay.  I'm not sure if the vinegar threw off the flavour but was not as good as I thought it would be and I love garlic.

I have this marinating at home.  Since the marinade is so thick, do I need to remove some of it before I cook the chicken?
