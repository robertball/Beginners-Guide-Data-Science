Heather - thank you for your recipe.  My Mother in Law would be proud of me - I FRIED CHICKEN!  And it was really good.....even though I kind of screwed up - I added 1 Tablespoon chicken seasoning to the buttermilk instead of a teaspoon and I added a teaspoon of seasoning to the flour.  Seems, this was an excellent mistake.  I took  a picture of your recipe - the lighting isn't great, I will try to get another picture tomorrow in the day light....if I don't eat all the chicken first!

This is a pretty good fried chicken recipe for dark meat as written.  Next time I am going to try with breast and see how it goes as I prefer white meat.   I assume it should taste about the same since you are in a sense putting the chicken in a brine over night so it shouldn't dry out during the frying

Decided to make this chicken dinner for some friends and family, we had been talking about dinners from our childhoods and how what we eat now and what we ate then was so different.  When someone pointed out that you can still eat the foods from the past just do so on special occaison and in moderation.

Just finished dinner and this chicken was wonderful.

Simple and excellent.  Best fried chicken I ever made.  Crispy skin.  I had rather large chicken drumsticks and had to fry them low and slow(

I learned to do chicken this way as a young girl, and it's nice to know fried chicken "still" lives on!  However, you might want to put the "dry" mixture in a ziplock bag, and shake it.  We used paper lunch bags way back when, but I still hope the shaking " kills" those calories !

I'm not a big fan of fried anything, but hubs had a hankering for some good homemade fried chicken.  This recipe caught my eye because it employs a simple brining process, followed by a soak in buttermilk. Braving the hot oil, I dredged and cooked the pieces until they were a nice golden brown.  We both enjoyed this very much, and are looking forward to the rest for lunch. The mess was well worth it!

I love this recipe.  It must be keeping the chicken so cold that gives such great results.  It was the first time, after years of trying, that my chicken was cooked through, juicy, and keep the batter on.  I wasn't as excited about the spice mix and, even with 1/2 the salt, it would have been too much.  I'll work on that part.  The method listed here is perfect.  Thanks.

Not bad for my first time frying! Easy step-by-step directions. I did brine the meat for 2 hours in a salt and lemon herb bath before cooking. (suggestion made by others) Will definitely make this again.:)

Followed recipe exactly-ish. Instead of the chicken seasoning I used Old Bay. Really great fried chicken. All the neighbors and family loved it. Thanks Heather!

I really like the method that this recipe uses. However I found the spice ratios to be pretty wacky. Also I like my fried chicken a little spicy so I added cayenne. Otherwise really great fried chicken.

I created an account here just so I could say how great this recipe is. It was perfect just what I was looking for. My only issue wasn't caused by anything in the recipe but lack of experience. I didn't know what place to put my oven knob so I could get the oil heated to 375 degrees. But Google is an amazing search engine and I figured that out as well. Great tasting chicken! Thank you so much for sharing Heather!

I had the chicken in the brine for almost two days (chaotic week) and I think the brining buttermilk is excellent. Only issue I had the spice mix wasn't to my liking. I added a little cayenne pepper but it wasn't enough - it still needed something. So prep method and cooking the chicken is great but will have to tinker with the spices next time.

I tried a version of this today just made mine simpler to do. Dipped chicken thighs in egg and battered in plain flour. Let sit covered with napkins for maybe 15 minutes. Deep fried at 375 degrees for 25 minutes. I added the salt pepper and paprika last.

I pulled my chicken out to thaw in anticipation of this recipe. I didn't plan well I guess because I forgot all about the brining part of this recipe until about two hours before dinner. I just skipped that part and followed the rest of the recipe. I made my own buttermilk with whole milk and white vinegar. I think I may need to reduce my temperature next time because it turned out a little darker than I would have liked but it was tender and juicy. I rarely fry chicken but next time I will plan better and try the brining step. Thanks for a good one!

Loved it! The perfect fried chicken. I made a few changes. To the water bath I added lemon juice mint and cilantro. To the seasoning mix I cut down on the salt and added Montreal Steak Seasoning. Yes I said steak seasoning. That is secret my ingredient when I make chicken. The whole family loved it.

This was awesome! I never knew making fried chicken could be so easy. I followed the recipe except for paprika which i didn't have and it still tasted amazing. I also had some chicken breasts that i cut into strips to batter and fry. They turned out great as well! Homemade chicken tenders! I fried those for about 8 min. I will make this again for sure!

I used Boneless skinless thighs and breast cut into large chicken tenders. I did the cold brine overnight and the buttermilk for a couple hours. I lightened up the salt in the chicken seasoning. Cooked in small batches and they came out beautiful. Try to batter and fry as close together in timing. I had a big batch and the later ones got a bit gummy from waiting so I just tossed with a little more flour before frying them they were fine. Lots of steps bit of a mess but it is great fried chicken.

This recipe reminded me of the fried chicken my mother made us as kids. After finding it I set out to locate a Wearever Chicken Bucket deep pressure fryer. They haven't made them for about 25 years but thanks to Ebay they can be located. The only change I made to the recipe was to double dip the milk and coating. I made it this past weekend for my wife. It was even better than I remembered. If I could give this recipe more than 5 stars I would.

This was ok but the seasoning wasn't what I'd hoped it would be.
