This is not Coq Au Vin!  It's chicken and wine but does not come close to capturing the depth of flavor and sophiscation of the classic French dish.  The chicken was tough and dry, the sauce lacked the depth of flavor that makes this dish famous.  If you are going to make Coq Au Vin, take the time to do it right and don't try to take a shortcut.  You are cheating yourself of the real deal.

This dish made Julia Child famous.  It is a mix of complex ingredients coming from simple foods -- use only the freshest ingredients for this dish.  If you do not have a very large skillet, reduce the onions to 8 and the mushrooms to 8 as well.  The bacon flavor is essential to this dish so I recommend frying a few pieces of bacon in place of the bacon bits.  Use only a dry red wine that you would drink (and enjoy)-- I recommend a Pinot Noir for this dish.

Although I cook a lot, I've only made Coq au Vin twice and I was really looking forward to the taste. Sadly, it was a disappointment. It was too winey and the sauce had no depth. I would try adding a teaspoon or 2 of tomato paste if I tried this again. I probably won't because Emeril Lagasse's recipe is sooo much better, it's worth the extra few minutes of prep work! Thanks anyway, Kelly!

Based on what I've eaten in restaurants I prepared this a bit differently, however this was a very good base. First of all, I fried up fresh bacon, removed it and then browned the chicken (which I seasoned with salt, pepper, onion and garlic powders) in the bacon fat. I then removed the chicken, drained most of the fat, added flour, then sauteed the vegetables including garlic cloves. Once browned I added chicken broth, tomato paste and the seasonings and let it simmer for about a minute. I replaced the chicken the transfered it to my oven for about ninety minutes. Delicious dish Kelly and I thank you for a terrific start!

Fabulous flavour and took all of 20 minutes to prepare. Looks impressive and smells divine. Works great with sherry and a bit of worchestershire as well.

I used a whole 4.5 pound chicken and put everything in my slow cooker on low for 8 hours. The chicken came out incredibly moist and flavorful!  I highly reccomend the slow cooker method for anyone who doesn't have the time to make this on the stovetop and wants an easy meal.  I made the sauce with some of the liquid from the slow cooker and just eyeballed how much flour and water to use to thicken the sauce.  The flavor was incredible!!  I served biscuits and salad with the dish and my family really liked everything.  With the leftover chicken, my husband made risotto the next night.

This was a very tasty dish. My family enjoyed it, but then they all love burgundy wine. I, on the other hand, don't enjoy red wine, and was a little put off by the color of this dish. I suppose one should expect the chicken breasts to turn purple in this sauce.In spite of the disappointment in the color, this was a delicious dish.I probably won't make this again, but that is certainly no reflection on this recipe.Thanks Kelly.

I was told by a professional chef to put a handful of raisins into this dish for flavor.  Also you might use a combination of white wine and port if you want something a little sweeter and grape-ier.

I have to disagree with Vorcha...this is coq au vin, which is exactly that...chicken in wine. While it may not be Julia Child's Coq Au Vin recipe, any recipe that has chicken stewing in a wine broth is coq au vin. It is a translation, not a brand name.

With regards to this recipe, while it is not Julia Child's recipe, for someone on a budget with a short amount of time who wants to give their family a developed taste for cuisine, this is more than adequate. I added celery to my recipe, and used a white zinfindel, but otherwise, the seasoning creates a very good flavor.

This was disappointing.  The only thing I changed was to use crumbled real bacon instead of bacon bits, and skinned leg quarters instead of boneless breasts.  Certainly not what I expected from eating this dish in the past.

I substituted fresh veggies for the frozen/canned ones and it turned out fabulous! I made it for my roommate and my friend and they loved it! It's very rich, so I put it over pasta.

This recipe got rave reviews and second and third helpings.  I made some changes per the other cook's suggestions and a little tweaking of my own.  I used Pinot Noir wine, which was a divine accompaniment.  I cooked an entire package of bacon instead of using bacon bits, and did the initial skillet-sautéing of the chicken in the bacon rendering.  I used a combination of chicken breasts and thighs and was able to simmer longer, so that the chicken was exceptionally moist.  I did not use the parsley, herbs or bouillon below b/c I was out and forgot to buy at the grocery.  I did sprinkle some "Mrs. Dash", though.  I did not do the roux (flour/water mix).  The chicken meat was falling off the thigh bones.  The flavor was incredible and I felt so sophisticated making Julia Child's famous dish!  I did not serve on top of rice or noodles, which I think is better for this dish.  I served a side of sweet potato soufflé and served Banana Caramel Fluff for dessert.

This was surprisingly bland!  I even added more boullion than called for, and it still needed a LOT of salt.  The veggies were the tastiest part, the chicken & sauce were blah.  I guess if you make it using real bacon it would improve the salt level & taste better.  Apparently there is no good shortcut for Coq au Vin.

I used leg/thigh combo in the slow cooker.  I also used regular chopped onions for pearl onions.  My kids thought it was weird because of the color, but it had a very nice taste.  Served over white rice. Very easy to make.  I will make this again.

This is the first time I have made Coq au vin. I took the suggestion of others here and cooked up some bacon and browned the chicken in the renderings. I have to say I was a bit disapointed in the results of this recipe. The sauce didn't have much depth and while the chicken was tender it was not very flavorful. I think I will try this again sometime but not use this recipe.

I followed the recipe to a "T" and that was probably my mistake. The chicken breasts came out looking purple. Everything was off in this meal. I've tried several recipes from this site and so far this was my only bomb.

This was terrible. I purchased a pricey bottle of wine to try this recipe and didn't like it at all. It was very bland. My hubby wouldn't even eat it. Waste of ingredients, will not make again!

Easy and delicious.  Instead of using non-stick spray I cooked the bacon in my iron skillet and drained most the grease and used a little to fry the chicken in.  Not the most lowfat way to cook, but I think the extra calories were worth the taste :)

No, I haven't and won't Coq Au Vin done in 1.5 hours? 

1 you put your cut up chicken and veggies in a GOOD French red wine or burgundy over night or longer.  Yes, your chicken looks OMG purple. 2. you need 2 pans, bacon, fry your purple chicken in the bacon fat with 1 tbl olive oil about 8 mins per side. Strain veggies from wine. Take chicken out add the wine veggies brown , whisk 2 tbl flour to veggies, add chicken broth, herbs, chicken again soft boil 30 mins. In another pan do your pearl onions and mushrooms.  etc etc etc. Purple chicken, how funny.  Making my Coq Au Vin now, I'll upload a photo.  coq au vin is not done in 1.5 hrs, if you do right

This has just the perfect balance of flavors and spices.  We added some potatoes and served with fresh bakery bread.  I can't remember the last time my own cooking tasted so gourmet!

I made a rendition of this tonight. I looked it up to see what herbs went in. I browned white chicken tenders in butter/oliver oil.  I coated them with  herbs, parsley, rosemary,thyme all dried.  I took them out after browning & put 1 carton of sliced mushrooms in & browned them.  I took them out & added more herbs, a little butter,some garlic and 1 cup red wine. I let that simmer,added thickner. (flour & water) & added the cooked mushrooms The finally added the cooked chicken. It was awesome  ( no veggies)

This turned out fabulous! It was relatively easy to prepare. I made it for my book club and it was a hit! I did use thigh meat. My mom said thighs would stay moist better then breasts, and I now agree.

Instead of bacon bits, use real bacon. Fry it up and then brown the chicken in the bacon grease. Remove the chicken and leave only about a tablespoon of grease in the pan. Add the mushrooms, onions and other seasonings. Increase the bouillon to a full teaspoon. Pour in the wine and deglaze the pan then add the water. Thicken with cornstarch instead of flour.

I made this for a girls night in the other night and got rave reviews! Served with buttered herbed redskinned mashed potatoes and it put it over the top. One suggestion that I have is when it comes time for the flour rue, use a 1/4-1/2 cup of versus the 1/8c it calls for. It does not take away from the red wine "twang" at all and makes for a wonerful sauce.

Used thighs instead of breasts, browned 3 pieces real bacon in butter and olive oil (1 TBSP each) instead of bacon bits, omitted parsley - I just don't like it - but otherwise followed recipe. A good quick dish when served with homemade fresh pasta and a nice glass of matching wine.
