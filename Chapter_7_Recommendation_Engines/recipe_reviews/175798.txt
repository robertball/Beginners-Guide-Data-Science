These are very good, the only change I would make is to cook onions and take out of skillet until the bacon is cooked, then add the onions and the brown sugar.  If you do it as the recipe says, your onions will start to burn before you bacon is done.

MMMMmmm this was good! super duper rich tho! Use less bbq sauce, just a thin layer is all you need. Use brown sugar bbq sauce vs adding brown sugar. After onions are soft remove from pan until bacon is almost cooked. Don't skip the cilantro this adds a nice balance of flavor!

This was super yummy!  I had some left over BBQ pulled pork to use up and wasn't in the mood for just pulled pork sandwiches.  Someone from AR recommended this to me and I'm so glad they did!  I used the BBQ pork in place of just the BBQ sauce.  I also added some black beans and served with roasted salsa on the side.  It's so nice to have something fun and different to do with leftovers!  Will be making these again!

I made this last night for a halloween party.  It was the first thing to go.  Everyone loved it.  I left out the cilantro because 1) I don't like it and 2) I didn't have it on hand.  But it was a huge hit.  Will definitely make it again.

Used homemade bbq sauce (Ball Blue Book) and vidalia onions.  Served with French Onion sour cream on top and sweet slaw on the side.  Only change I'll make next time is use a couple more slices of bacon, but I will definitely be making this many times in the future, wonderful taste and easy to make!

Great recipe!  Cooked as per the directions but just used the BBQ sauce to taste. Going to try these again with some different fillings but the cilantro and BBQ is an awesome combo.

I made these with shredded ham to use up the leftovers and they were fantastic!  The only other change I made was to use less bbq sauce on each tortilla.  I'll be using this recipe every time I have leftover ham.  The whole family loved them!

This was very tasty. I cooked the bacon first, chopped it, then added it to the cooking onions. I made the recipe quantity for the "stuffing" but served only to two people. A thin layer of barbecue sauce was needed. Another go-to quick meal!
