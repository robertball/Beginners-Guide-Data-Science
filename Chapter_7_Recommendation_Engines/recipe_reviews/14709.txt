This is absolutely Puerto Rican. I am not sure why doing a variation with the Worcestershire instead of the vinegar etc would make it less authentic, but this is what we know as Carne Mechada but this one is made with Pork. It should have been a boneless pork roast but you can do the same with Beef. This is a Pork Roast too not to be confused with the so called Pernil Asado. Some people put pepperonis,some ham etc. This is why there are recipes. Everyone would make them a bit different. I marinade the meat with oregano, olive oil etc, and then stuff it. Really good and flavorful.

This recipe is wonderful.

Don't be so quick to say that this is not 'truly puertorrican'.  I remember my uncle more than 35 years ago putting olives and 'salchichón' inside of his pork roasts. Salchichón is very similar to pepperoni (and he sometimes used mortadella too). He also used olives as well. The worcestershire sauce may seem odd, but people have been using it for a while (but we call it salsa inglesa).

Anyway, this recipe is a twist from the traditional 'criollo' cooking, but it is GOOD!

This is by far the BEST recipe we have found for a pork roast! It is great cold, as well as hot. We use La. Hot Sauce, and it does not make the meat "torched" with heat! Just a wonderful taste. Makes a nice presentation when sliced and placed on a platter to be served. This is now one of our favorites. Worked just as well with 2" boneless pork chops.

I read the reviews and regardless if this is authentic or not, it was very good and we enjoyed it. I Googled their flag and it had similarities to ours and so keeping with the theme of things, I used a star cookie cutter on some bread along with some food coloring, buttered it, and stuck it under the broiler for fun pork sandwiches. I followed this recipe to a T except that I did it in my slow cooker. This was very simple, good, full of flavor and a nice change to our everyday pork roast. Thanks!

This was good.  I couldn't give it a 5 star rating because this IS NOT A true PUERTO RICAN DISH!!  We DON'T use pepperoni, hot pepper sauce or worcestershire sauce in our dishes.  If you want a true Puerto Rican pork roast, try the recipe before this one--submitted by Kenny.

I pride myself being Puerto Rican...and I have to agree with Rosa, this recipe is not authentic Puerto Rican style. I learned to cook from my mother and grandmother, and they said the same thing

Very good. A very tasty roast, that made the house smell wondeful as it cooked. This is a nice change to just your plain old roast, give it a try!

I made this for guests and they loved it. I did not put in the olives and used a whole clove of garlic in each cut. I also used a pork tenderloin instead of a pork roast. Very good flavor!

I had been waiting to try this recipe for a while, and I'm glad I finally got around to it! Whether it is authentic or not, it is so tasty and so unique! I used a boneless pork roast and it came out fantastic. Great taste! So original!

Both my husband (picky eater) and I (don't care for pork) really enjoyed this one. It certainly won't take long for this wonderful dish to disappear.

My husband and son loved it!  So did I!  Enough for my husband to invite friends over to show off "his wife's cooking."  I was happy he was so proud.  Thank you, Donald.  Please submit more Puerto Rican Recipes.

Whether this is true Puerto Rican or not, it was delicious! I enjoyed stuffing this roast full of garlic, pepperoni and the olives. My husband was skeptical of the olives, but then it was everyone's favorite part! I threw everything together in the crock pot, didn't really measure anything. Do yourself a favor and make gravy, delicious!
