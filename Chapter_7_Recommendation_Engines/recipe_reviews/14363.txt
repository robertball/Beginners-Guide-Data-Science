Great recipe, but I did not use the sugar, and I mixed half balsamic vinegar, half raspberry vinegar. I simply forgot the sugar, but it was not missed. I liked this so much, and we still have strawberries and spinach left over, so I will be trying it, again, tonight, with half the sugar called for added in.

This is a delicious salad!  I first tasted it at a gourmet grocer in my neighborhood, where (naturally) it was terribly expensive.  Therefore, I decided to try it at home, and this was the recipe closest to what I used.  I substituted Splenda (to taste) for the sugar (about 2 packets) and only used the Balsamic and Vege oil and Paprika.  Also, added feta and chopped walnuts.  A TOTAL HIT!!

This salad was great! It not only tasted great but it looked so pretty! Great for a Christmas dinner.  I didn't have dried onions so I thinly sliced some sweet onions and sprinkled the rings in the salad.  I also eliminated the poppy seeds and it was fine. The only thing I would change next time is to lessen the amount of sugar by a few tablespoons.  The balsamic vinegar is already so sweet.  But the sugar makes it thick and clingy so take out too much.

I have been making this salad for over a year. It is very simple to make. And everyone enjoys it. We use it all year round. And every time we make it for people we are asked for the recipe. I can't believe that no one else has rated it yet!! Definately five stars!!!!

This is excellent (even my Mom asked me for the recipe!). I made the dressing exactly as written except I didn't have poppy seeds. I love the sweet/sour/sesame oil combination, it's perfect, I wouldn't adjust anything about it. I used a package and a half of pre-washed baby spinach, putting only about 2/3 of the dressing on the salad. I'll be making lunch out of the leftover dressing and greens tomorrow. I can't wait to make this salad again when local strawberries are available!

I've been looking to replicate an asian style salad dressing for a long time.  I finally found it!!!  This works great with any vegetable salad even if you only have the vinegar, oils, and sugar.

This salad was quick and delicious. The dressing was very flavorful although I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I dumped all of the dressing on the salad to toss it and it was a little heavy even for me. Next time I'll pay more attention and not use it all. Perfect salad for something different!

Great! I added feta to it to give it a little salty kick, very tasty! Also I used shallots instead of regular onion. Worked well.

This is one of the BEST spinach salads I have ever made.  Everyone loves it at pot lucks.  I also add a tbs of pine nuts.  Do not use all on one salad.  The dressing makes enough for 2 to 3 batches of salad.  Therefore it gets used on ordinary salads around here just to spice them up!  Only ingredients I substitute are HONEY for sugar and  grape seed oil and no sesame oil.

Dressing way to sweet and I even decreased the sugar by 1/8 of a cup. If I ever make again will omit the sugar or only use 2 tbsp. also used a blueberry vinegar instead of balsamic maybe that made it sweeter

i luv this recipe. i normally cut down a little bit of the sugar. the amount of the sugar that i cut out it depends on the sweetness of strawberry. V always got really nice sweet strawberries from friends home grown. so i would suggest taste the strawberries u got first b4 u cut /double the amount of sugar. ' cz u can put more sugar later if it's not sweet enough. i hope it help ! :-)

I love this recipe!  Everytime I have served it, I have people calling and asking for the recipe.  I have tried this salad using white wine vinegar in place of the balsamic, as some of the other strawberry spinach salads suggest.  I like the flavor so much better with the balsamic vinegar.  This is a go to recipe when I am entertaining.

This is Excellent!  The only change I made was to omit the poppy seeds b/c I didnt have any. I used fresh picked strawberries that my daughter had just pick from the garden. I will be making this again! Thanks for the great salad!

Made this for dinner for my inlaws last night - big hit! I would definitely make it again!  My husband is a diabetic so I replaced the sugar with Splenda.  I did not have poppyseeds, so I skipped those.  I did add gorgonzola.  Next time I think I might add some candied pecans as well.  I used ~ 2/3 bag of fresh spinach.  I made 1/2 the dressing and probably only used 1/2 of what I made.

I was looking for something different and made this salad to go with our Easter meal and it was a big big hit.  All ages loved it.  And so easy to prepare.  I'm thinking of bringing a small serving to my moms for Mother's Day.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I forgot the paprika, and it was still great.

Loved the flavor combination of the balsamic, spinach and strawberries. After reading reviews I decided to taste the dressing before adding sugar and thought it was great without any sugar. I also increased the proportion of sesame oil since that is a flavor we love.

EXCELLENT!  And another great tip - put all ingredients (including poppy seeds) in a blender and blend.  You can then keep this dressing in the fridge and it doesn't seperate - it gets very thick and yummy.  Perfect on grilled salmon as well :)

This was a great salad.  I added some goat cheese for another flavor. Be sure not to 'dress' it until right before serving or the spinach will wilt too much.

This is simple and tasty! I love the addition of the sesame oil. I had one comment that is was a bit too sweet so I will cut down on the sugar next time. I also added slivered almonds..perhaps I will toast them in sesame oil. I might add some feta as well. But really the salad is great as is!

I really enjoyed this salad.  We had a similar salad over the weekend at a cookout.  I substituted Cider for Balsamic, white sugar with Xylitol (natural sugar substitute)  and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  My daughter is on a special diet for medical reasons, so this worked out to be wonderful.

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this recipe.  I've made this several times now and I love it.  The first several times I made it I didn't have balsamic vinegar or sesame oil.  I omitted the sesame oil and used whatever vinegar I had on hand.    My husband prefers it with any vinegar and not the balsamic and he prefers it with out the sesame oil as well.  I however like it best as the recipe is written.

I love the addition of sesame oil in this version. I'm diabetic so I used 1/4 cup of agave nectar instead of the 1/2 cup of white surgar. Very good! My husband gave it a triple "Wow!" when he tasted it.

Yum!.. The dressing was awesome; I used pomegranite balslamic vinegar and added a tiny dash of dry mustard mixing it in well with the other ingredients.  I find all spinach to be too soft for my taste so I cut up some Romaine as well.  Toasted and sugared the pecans in a pan and they added a little more sweetness since my strawberries were a bit tart.   I served this as a main-course so I added grilled chicken!  I could eat this all the time it was wonderful!.. :)

This gets raves every time. I cut way down on the sugar (1/4 c at the most), and use minced red onion or shallots instead of dried. I also throw in cooked white asparagus cut in 1-inch pieces, which makes the salad really pretty.

Great salad, only one change, though. Instead of sugar (which doesn't seem to disolve well in this dressing)honey is much better. Other than that, a very refreshing salad and ingredients meld very well together

I heard about this recipe from a Sorority Chef who made it and let me sample it...it was AMAZING...I even made it with both Sugar and Splenda instead and both were awesome....I shared it with my mom, now counts this as her most absolutely favorite salad or all time...me too.  You won't be sorry you made this recipe.

Everyone liked it.  It was a little vinegary for my tastes, but I'll try again with more sugar maybe.  A more aged vinegar may be mellower too.  Good recipe.  Thanks for sharing :)

This recipe is fantastic just on it's own as is.  I have made it several times and did add slivered almonds once and walnuts once to add some texture.  It was beautiful both ways.  Thanks for sharing!

This salad has become a family classic. I do adjust the sugar based on the sweetness of the strawberries, but use all the other ingredients - I buy poppy seeds just to make this salad. It's a must-have at our summer picnics.

Delicious! I used apple cider vinegar instead of balsamic. It gives it just a little bit more of a fruity flavor with a kick.  But I've enjoyed the dish with balsamic as well.  Absolutely divine!  I can't say enough good things about this recipe.  Try it with shaved, fresh parmesan cheese and grilled chicken.  It is heavenly.  My only recommendation would be not to add the dressing until just before serving.

The combination of spinach and strawberries... mmm very tasty. The homemade vinaigrette... not tasty. I did this recipe twice and did not like the dressing at all. The Sesame oil is quite expensive and pungent. I ended up just purchasing a raspberry vinaigrette spritzer and that's when the salad was tasty. Will not trying this again. Sorry!!

Yummy! Made just as written and everybody loved it. Had enough dressing to keep in fridge. Hubby made the salad  the next day but we had no strawberries. He added Craisins and walnuts and it was awesome.

This was a wonderfully refreshing salad! I went with the advice of other reviews and cut the sugar - using 5 packets of spenda instead. I omitted poppy seed oil and poppy seeds as I didn't have any. I added a small amount of chopped red onion in place of the dried onions. I put cucumbers, sliced almonds, and the dressing on the side for people to choose. Mmmm it was so yummy - a great way to eat salad.

I love this type of salad but like to make it my own.  I add slivers of red onion to the spinach and strawberry mixture.  The dressing I like a little bit tangier than sweet so I take 1/2 c veg oil, 1/4 sugar, 1/2 balsamic vinegar, 1tsp onion powder, 1/2tbsp lemon juice, and dash of salt and pepper.  Stir it up and drizzle on salad  Delicious!

This dressing is perfect for spinach-strawberry salad.  I didn't have poppy seeds, so left them out.  The sesame oil is what "makes" it, IMO.  Sugar could probably be cut back a bit.  I added cubed Korean pear, toasted walnuts, and feta cheese to the salad.  It was the favorite dish at a recent dinner party.

The best I've had with compliments galore! Definately half the sugar and it's still plenty sweet. I always add toasted slivered almonds, and instead of onions in the dressing, I either throw shallots or red onion into the salad. Depending on what I have around, I've also added feta or goat cheese, sliced kiwi, mandarin oranges, toasted pine nuts...the basic recipe is very good, and that's just the beginning!

This salad was wonderful.  The dressing was wonderful, the sesame seed really help make the salad along with the strawberry’s.   This is a great salad to go along with any main course.  It really looks great on the table.  I recommend this salad to anyone!

I highly recommend this recipe, replacing the veggie oil with olive oil - it's much healthier.  I also added walnuts and used a combo of red wine and rice vinegars instead of balsamic.  Thanks!

Perfecto! Holy Tamole this is exactly what I was looking for. I had a similar salad at a favorite eatery and hoped to duplicate it. I think this one was more exciting. I didnt have any of the seeds and I'm sure they would be fun but they arent needed. Somehow the sugar doesnt really dissolve (or maybe it was just mine) but it gives this crystalized texture to the salad that I really enjoyed. I used pre-cut strawberries (with a couple blue berries) from the deli. I tossed them in some sugar-water at room temperature while making dinner and they were pefect by serving time. I didnt combine the leaves(bagged), berries, almonds and dressing until the last minute. Wonderful.

Makes ALOT of dressing! Be careful not to drown it! Absolutely delicious, but I had a little bit of an issue with all the poppy/sesame seeds in it sticking in my teeth.

This is my absolute favorite variation of the many "Spinach & Strawberries" salads on this site...absolutely delicious, light and flexible!  I never mix the dressing in with the salad, but leave it on the side in a serving dish (prevents salad from getting soggy).  My favorite variations include: 1) adding toasted almond slices to the greens ( based on personal preference, but at least a 1/4 cup) 2) subbing water for half the oil 3) mix sesame seeds in food processor with oil, water, vinegar, paprika, sugar, sesame oil & minced onions 3) sub Splenda for sugar 4) mixing Poppy seeds with greens instead of in the dressing 5) subbing Spring mix greens for half of the Spinach 6) add thin slivers of onion to salad greens/ strawberry/ toasted almond/ poppy seed mix.   The sesame oil adds a wonderful layer of flavor to this dish...it is one of the best salads I have had in a long time...thank you PEGW!!!

This recipe is delicious!!  I have yet to try it with the paprika, but I have tried it with a few variations.  The first time I just added sliced almonds to the salad, and it really just amped up the flavor.  The second time instead of using strawberries, I used half the amount, and used raspberries for the remaning amount.  I have to say the raspberries were an amazing addition!  Today I had it without the fruit at all (I had a ton of spinach left over, but no berries) and it was still quite amazing.  I also used fresh sliced red onions today instead of powder.

Like others, I added sliced almonds because I did not have sesame seeds, poppy seeds, or sesame oil, and wanted to give the salad a nutty flavor. It was delicious but next time I will use less sugar because I am so wired right now!

Great Recipe.  I sliced the strawberries instead. I also omitted the sesame seeds and used regular veg oil instead.  I also added about a cup of chopped pecans for a bit of crunch...excellent

Fabulous!  I used a little bit of red onion in place of the dried, and used EVOO instead of veg. oil.  You MUST use the sesame oil, it's expensive but really gives this a special bite!

I used balsamic vinegar instead of white vinegar on the advice of my neighbor. This salad is absolutely delicious! It is a new favorite at my girls dinners and I have had SO many requests for the recipe!

Excellent dressing.  Bf liked the dressing  but told me it was "weird" to have strawberries and spinach.  I liked the combo, but there was way too much dressing, so I'd halve the dressing if I make it again.  I have leftover dressing bc I only drizzled about half on, and it was plenty.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a fantastic salad as well as a beautiful one.  I made it as written except I didn't have any sesame seeds. The blend of tastes and textures is wonderful.  By adding other things such as chicken, nuts or cheese it can be made into an entree salad.  Great stuff, and I can't wait to serve it to guests.

I had to use up some leftover salad and roasted chicken.  I had just bought some strawberries, and the avocado was calling for me...one salad later.... viola!   It was delicious, I will probably make some more tomorrow for my DH.

This is the salad to make for people who don't eat salads!  It looks so good that everyone will try it and then they are hooked.  I made it exactly according to the recipe.  Everyone loved it.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Well, I thought this was one heck of a good salad!  I didn't have any of the seeds on hand nor did I use ANY sugar and still thought it was excellent.  I think the addition of almonds or pecans would make this superb!  Thanks for sharing - great combination of flavors.

Fantastic salad. Sweet yet balanced and nutritious. The amount of sugar on recipe is way too much! I used just two teaspoons and no onions.

Great recipe. I'm not a fan of really sweet dressings so I used white balsamic vinegar and omitted the sugar altogether. Very happy with the result.

My kids and hubby made this salad at my request for mothers day and I did like the spinach and dressing. I think a substitute for the strawberries are maybe sometimes called for. I will try with mandarin oranges next time as another review suggested. But the dressing was a big hit with me. I say sub on the strawberries because I like mine sweet and sometimes with those it's hit or miss. But good salad overall.

I took this salad to a church pot luck and everyone loved it.  One person said she always orders this salad when it is available on menus at restaurants.  She told me it was better than anything she has ever ordered.  I made it as directed, except that I didn't use all of the dressing.  There is waaaay too much in my opinion.  Next time, I will half the ingredients for the dressing.  Great recipe, though!

Way too much dressing for a proper salad.  The star of the show should be the fresh spinach and the strawberries, instead it was balsamic and sesame/poppy seed. Cut the dressing in half at least
