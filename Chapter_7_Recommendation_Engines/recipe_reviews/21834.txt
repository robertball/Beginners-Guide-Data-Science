This marinade is delicious and I used it with a nice pork chop.  I didn't have long to marinate this so I just baked it in the oven and let the sauce reduce and thicken.  I substituted real ginger for the powder and honey for the molasses.  I added some red pepper flakes for some heat.  YUMMM!!! and quick and easy.

We used this marinade on a pork tenderloin this evening and we just loved it!  I usually don't care for marinades that are heavy on the soy sauce, but I was impressed how well it turned out.  We used low sodium soy sauce and a lighter shiraz, which helped and the molasses flavor is subtle and really, really good.  Brown sugar would have been great here too.  Just that little bit of sweetness from the molasses added a nice crust from the grill on the outside of the meat and it was tender and perfect on the inside.  We also did another tenderloin with straight bbq sauce just in case we didn't like this marinade, and there was a ton of the bbq tenderloin left over and none of this one!!!  A sign of a great recipe!

I doubled the amount of red wine and added less soy and half the sugar and they are awesome!

I changed the recipe a little bit based on what I had in the house.  I only had a soy sauce marinade, which is really just soy sauce and sugar.  So I used 3/4 cups of the marinade instead of 1/2 cup and I used 1 1/2 tbsp of sugar instead of 3 tbsp.  I also used brown sugar instead of molasses.  The wine I used was a shiraz.  The marinade was delicious, and I'm sure it would be even better if I followed the ingredients more precisely!

I used this on chicken kabobs which I marinated for about 4 hours before grilling. The resulting chicken was tender and moist with a mildly sweet flavor. Very tasty!

This is a regular in our house. The only change I made was to flip the soy sauce and wine measurements.

This was great! I marinated fresh pork in this overnight, and it was delicious! I added extra garlic (probably double), and a bit extra ginger to give it a little more kick. I will definitely use this again. :)

I really liked this marinade. It gave my pork chops LOTS of flavor. I used splenda instead of real sugar and I used Merlot for the wine. I put slightly less molasses because it's so strong. Very good recipe and I would think it would be safe for children because the alcohol cooks out of it but still adds some flavor. :-)

Apparently I dont like soy sauce. I've never used it before, and I think I let the pork sit too long in the marinade. But once I cooked it, ALL I could taste is the soy sauce. I think if maybe I used the teriyaki (which I KNOW I like) instead, it would be great. It really added a lot of flavor to the meat, "The Mr." noticed and commented on it, and liked it, but I just couldnt get past the soy sauce.

We had this tonight, marinated for only 1 1/2 hours with Costco's pork brisket grillers (really a nice cut).  It was kind of a last minute idea, but it was really worth the try.  I made the marinade exactly as stated, and I grilled the pork for only about 15 minutes on indirect heat.  We'll do this one again.

I used this on pork chops and neither the husband nor I liked it at all.  Maybe it was my wine choice--I used red cooking wine as I didn't have any regular red wine. ??

This is a really easy and tasty marinade.  Couldn't taste the wine so much so the second time I made it I switched the amounts of wine and soy sauce.  Will definitely use this marinade again.

Super yummy!!! Didn't have any ginger, but did add just a pinch or two of red pepper flakes.  Marinated pork chops for about 24 hrs, then grilled. Soooo amazing!  The chops were tender, and the flavors were perfectly balanced. Keeper!

I used equal parts soy sauce (lite) and old Shiraz.  This is a tasty way to used wine that is past it's drinking prime.

This was a very good recipe!  My husband and I were extremely pleased!  We just recently were married, so we only were able to use our dinky foreman grill in our apartment, but I think on the grill this would be fabulous!  I don't think I would change anything, except maybe use low sodium soy because I'm a health nut... but then again I'd probably add more wine (in my glass!), so many I'm not that healthy!  LOL

Perfect as is!  Made the best kabobs.  Chopped 2+ pounds of nice sirloin, red/green peppers, onions, and marinated overnight.  Then I skewered it all with some baby portabellas and put them on the grill.  Great served with some rice and red wine!

An OK marinade.  Couldn't really taste the flavors much after grilling.  Maybe I should have marinated longer than the 8 hours I did.  Probably won't do this one again.

Tasted too much like soy sauce to me, I even added more garlic and ginger and yet still the soy sauce was overpowering. Also I have found that marinades that use oil in their recipes tend to make for a juicer chicken. I almost added oil but wanted to see what it was like without it.

I just tried this marinade, as is, on chicken tenders and it was really delicious. I was thoroughly surprised at how good it was. My mom is very picky and even she loved it. I will most definitely be using this more often.

This was very good but thought it was salty from the soy sauce. Next time I'll use 50% salt reduced broth. I changed white sugar to brown and eliminated the extra calories of the molasses. I'd give it a four star also.

SO good! I made as directed and marinated the chicken in it all day prior to grilling. I basted it onto the chicken as I was grilling it and this chicken turned out so very flavorful! Delicious!

Marinaded some pork chops and the whole family raved over these and said that this was how I needed to do pork chops from now on!  Thanks so much for the easy, quick, and delicious recipe

Delicious! Though I took the advice of some other reviews and swapped the amounts of wine and soy sauce. I like lots of garlic so I used more  and I didn't have molasses so I used honey instead. I used pork chops and while the marinade would probably be good on beef I don't know if the flavors would really work well on chicken.

Our family loved it. We had boneless pork tenderloin which we cooked in the marinade for half the time (since we didn't have time to marinate before cooking). The finished result tasted similar to teriyaki pork. So good!

Great for pork , chicken and shrimp.  I used 1/2 C Sweet red wine (that's all I had), so I omitted the sugar and I added a heaping tablespoon if minced garlic...I could not get the molasses to combine so I heated the marinade in the microwave for about 25 seconds...that fixed it.  Simple and fantastic.  Thanks for sharing.

Marinated a pork loin for about 3 hours before grilling.  We all agreed that the soy sauce overpowered all of the other ingredients.  I was hoping they would blend a little better.  It wasn't bad...if you like soy sauce.

Marinated pork chops in this for about 45 minutes, then grilled over charcoal.  Really, really, really good!  My boyfriend doesn't like wine or molasses, yet he said the pork was amazing.  Thanks!

I finally found a marinade for pork that we absolutely love!  I used center cut pork loin chops (3/4" thick) and marinaded them for about 2 hours, then grilled them.  They were delicious and so juicy.  The flavors totally complimented the pork and did not overpower it.

Since our renewed passion for grilling began last year, we have tried many, many marinades. This is one of the best. I marinaded some pork chops for four or five hours and they turned out excellent. This one tastes like it was designed by someone who knew exactly what they were doing. For the leftovers, I used the chops for sandwiches, topped with steak sauce and hot horseradish. Spectacular.

I used this on pork chops. They marinated overnight and part of the next day.  Very yummy and tender, but I don't know how kid friendly they'd be.  This recipe is definitely a keeper, and I'll try this with steak next!
