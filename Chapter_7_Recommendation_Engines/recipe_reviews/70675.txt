My husband and I loved this! It's not too filling but very satisfying. I added some vegetables (zucchini and carrots) and cooked them with the  onions and beans. I also added pieces of fresh mozzarella and it turned out great.

This was wonderful!  I cut the basil amount in half, and added a little liquid into the simmering beans.  The overall mixture of flavour and texture was hearty and enjoyable!!!  Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

Hearty!  I added veggie stock to the cheese mix to keep it from the dryness others had stated.  Roasted some brussel sprouts since I had the oven on to go with it.  Whole wheat pasta and lower fat cheese made it healthier.

Amazing but only four stars because it needed some help.  I used 1 tomato and 1 can of beans but added a zucchini and a can of olives for more variety.  I also used mozzarella on top instead of bread crumbs to top it off as other suggested.   I also added more olive oil to the basil to keep it moist.

We found this recipe to be dry and bland despite having added extra balsamic and shredded mozzarella.

I really liked the combination of flavours in this recipe.  I didn't have any fresh basil so I did use some dried.  I'm sure it is 10 times better fresh.  My only complaint is that the ricotta made the dish rather dry. It did not melt at all.  I will make this again.  However, next time I will replace the ricotta with a Bechamel sauce(white sauce) and bix the bread crumbs with some mozzarella cheese.  Thanks for introducing a tasty dish that includes beans!

In order to help the dryness that other reviewers have noted, I added a beaten egg to the ricotta mixture first. Also, I used dried herbs as I didn't have fresh available. Oh, and I didn't have balsamic vineagar, so I used a splash of red wine and a splash of white wine vineagar. I did have to add a bit of salt and pepper to give it a little more "ooomph", too. I served it with fresh green beans and Italian bread. My husband loved it and was very impressed, but my toddler didn't like the ricotta. Also, I found that the timing worked out better if I put the pasta to boil in one pot and then sauted/simmered the onion/bean mixture at the same time. That way they were done simmering when the pasta was finished cooking, shaving 20 minutes off the recipe time. It wasn't worth it to me to save not having to wash one extra pan.

I followed all the suggestions - adding some chili zip, the egg, the zucchini. My sister really loved the results, and it was really healthy; however, I had difficulty getting excited about this one. It seemed like it was a conglomeration of several different recipes all mixed together.

We felt this was WAY too dry.  If I were to try this again, I think I would add spinach, egg and shredded mozzarella to the beans and pasta to give it some more flavor, color and moistness.  The ricotta/parm/garlic was a lovely flavor combo, especially with the crispy bread crumb topping.

This was a great meal! My husband and my 10-month old really enjoyed it. I used Mozz. cheese in place of Parm because I was out. Using whole wheat pasta and low fat Ricotta it turned out to be a very healthy meal. It came out to 7 points (when made into 10 servings) on weight watchers. I served with french bread and sald. Will definately make again.

This did look a little dry coming out of the oven, but it must have been pretty good because my husband (normally a hater of dry things) liked it so much that he didn't even leave any for me!

I used prepared pesto instead of basil & parmesan. You can puree the beans for picky eaters (like my husband). Yummy and nutritous. Thank you!

Surprisingly tasty and well balanced flavours. I used chickpeas instead of white beans and it turned out very well.

I made it as written but doubled the parmesan.  I also didn't cook it in the oven.  I didn't see the need to dirty another dish.

Being a vegetarian I was looking forward to trying this recipe.  I must admit that I was rather disappointed.  I found it to be too dry and bland.  I used a lowfat ricotta, but I can't imagine regular  ricotta would have given more flavour.  If I made it again, I would use mozzarella instead of parmesan to make it a bit more cheesy.

This was fabulous!  Easy to make, and so tasty.   Even better as leftovers, or cold.  Good as a side dish or a whole meal.

I am relatively new to cooking "veggy", and I really liked using the fresh herbs and tomatoes.  I wasn't really sure how to mince fresh basil so I ended up just chopping it with a knife.  The thyme also gave me some trouble so I just put it in whole and took it out after cooking.  Maybe right, maybe wrong?!  Either way, it had a really good flavor and was very filling.  I think if I make this dish again I will use a little less basil and learn how to use fresh herbs BEFORE I start preparation.
