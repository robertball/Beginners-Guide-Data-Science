Some folks in my office made this -- and it's nothing short of amazing (and delicious). I am huge salty snack fan -- so this appetizer spread was a dream come true for me. This takes a bit of time to make, but we divided up the task of making the spreads and sandwiches among a number of folks (potluck style), so it came together (and disappeared...) pretty quickly. You can find containers to hold the chips and Ritz crackers at any office supply store.

Super-fun! I have seen many different versions/variations of this type of recipe, including the Pillsbury products edition, and I love this one because you can also refer to the Allrecipes video on making it. My friends & family thought this was so clever, and we had a blast "demolishing" it bite by bite! To make things a little easier, I simply surrounded the stadium with stacked plastic cups for guests' snack-filling, instead of making tons of sandwiches. =)

Looks amazing! I'm wondering if I can make something smaller than that. I mean if I made the same size shown there'll be a lot left over.
