Carol thank you for posting this recipe. It got the AR Collective talking about what does and doesn’t work. I made this recipe this evening and based on the current reviews, made the following modifications. For my liquid, I used 3/4 cup water, 1/4 cup lemon juice, and 2T liquid aminos (use soy sauce if preferred). I put the frozen filets in the IP on the steamer rack, then poured the liquid over the fish. I seasoned my salmon with salt and pepper, because it will stick to the wet fish! I cooked it on high pressure for 4 minutes, did natural release for 2 minutes and finished with quick release. I think I could have just done a quick release and been done. The salmon was flavored well and cooked. I served it with the Back Burner Ratatouille from this site and quinoa. Picture uploaded.

The cook time for the salmon was fine (used manual pressure), but we didn't care for this salmon in the Instant Pot. It was not over or under cooked. I added garlic, onion, and paprika too, but the flavors didn't come through at all. This just tasted like plain salmon with no seasoning for us.

If you are looking for a quick and simple  way to make salmon, this is it.  If you are looking for fancy with lots of flavor, this probably isn't your best choice.  I love my Instant Pot and use it all the time.  I love that I can put frozen salmon in, pressure it for 5 minutes and it's perfect.  I seasoned mine with just salt and pepper, but sprinkled it on before cooking.  I served the salmon with tarter sauce, seasoned green beans and short grained brown rice---easy peasy!

Well, I had to microwave the salmon when it came out and then it was good, but the time is way off in this recipe.

I wonder if you could accomplish the same thing (albeit a little longer time involved) and pour some water in an oven-safe pan with a rack set down in it.  Then place the frozen salmon on the rack and cover the pan with foil and bake til done.

I used an Instant Pot and set it to Manual high pressure for 4 minutes. This was for a fully frozen Kirkland brand salmon fillet. I would recommend adding an extra minute.

Salmon doesn’t get much easier than this! This turned out so moist and I like how it can be seasoned to individual preference.

I was afraid to try this after reading the outcome was a major miss for some people. In my case, it came out really well! We cooked 4 pieces and I added a little extra seasoning in the water/lemon juice. Not sure if that helped at all but the fish was juicy and I just needed a little salt/pepper to taste. My 13 year old son approved as well! I used frozen salmon filets from Aldi

Meh. I halved the recipe and cooked one filet. it was undercooked and since I already released the steam, I microwaved it the rest of the way. and it was bland. I'd rather take the time to defrost it and cook it in the oven.

Whole family really loved it, (even young children).  Cooked for 4 minutes but didn't release steam until 3 minutes after cooking it.  Used extra lemon juice to flavor it.  It was a hit.

This salmon was so delicious! I could taste the lemon and it was so tender and flaky. The whole family ate it up.

Oh how I wanted to love this recipe!  What's not to love about the simplicity of just a few ingredients, frozen fish and 3-4 minutes cook time in my IP?  It's such a great idea!
I followed this recipe exactly, keeping in mind the cook time but when I removed them from the pot, they were overcooked and dry.  Not what you want from 2 beautiful sockeye salmon filets.  Since it's not often that we can get it here and the price is really high, it's a real treat when I make it.
Neither I nor my husband could eat it.  So,  I looked around for a recipe I could make with overcooked fish.
I now have a big bowl of salmon spread made from an AR recipe.
Looks like I'm gonna need some bagels!

I made this as written. Steamed in instant pot and it came out perfect and tasty.
