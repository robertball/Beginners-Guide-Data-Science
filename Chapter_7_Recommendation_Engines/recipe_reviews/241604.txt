Amazing! Great flavor! This came out a bit spicy, so if you want to tone down the spice, keep that in mind. I served mine with feta and it was a huge hit! Great recipe! Thank you!

Followed some of the others recommendations, added a can of kidney beans and used green chili salsa in place of green chilis, I added a cup of water so I could dissolve the chicken bouillon, it's not too liquidy but I think next time I will try not adding water, I added 2 cans of tomatoes and only one 8 oz can of tomato sauce.
I was intrigued by the addition of refried beans which makes it thicker, but you could just use pinto beans too.
I'm going to eat it with fritos scoops.
Thank you for posting this.

We used white onion instead of red and left out the coco powder. I added a jalepeno, more beans, and more crushed tomato. Went great with corn bread and was very filling as stated!
