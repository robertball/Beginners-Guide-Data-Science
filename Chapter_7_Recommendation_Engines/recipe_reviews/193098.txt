Pretty good and Pretty to look at. A very light and refreshing meal for hot weather. Served with whole grain baguette for a healthy meal. Thanks!

Fine salad for individual styling.  My variation: use watercress for greens, add a sliced hardboiled egg, toasted sliced almonds (or whole) and use only manadarin orange sections.  Omit avocado.

I made this for dinner last night, it was fantastic!!!! The chicken and the greens with the fruit was such a great combination, and the dressing was OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!   I will make this again for a ladies lunch next week.

I really really enjoyed this. I didn't have any green onions so I omitted those and swapped black berries for the raspberries (as they were about $2.00 a pint cheaper) and it still tasted really great.

I added a 4 chopped hard boiled eggs.  Used Del Monte mandarins and grapefruit from jars in produce section.  Served with fresh baked multigrain bread on the side, and a glass of Prosecco with whole raspberry dropped in.  Outstanding!

Loved it!  I didn't have Grapefruit because I can't stand it.  But this salad did fine without it.  Yum Yum!!

I added some fresh mint to the greens, which really enhanced the flavor.

I LOVE this salad! It is so delicious, and not an ounce of guilt comes along with it. I just throw all of the ingredients in a bowl and mix it up. You could use less dressing, it is rather swimming in it. We try to eat all of the greens the first time we have it, then if there are leftovers, we just eat them the next day for lunch, and you don't have any soggy greens. Sometimes I will add some more chopped boiled chicken at lunch time since we usually eat all  of the chicken too! I will start grilling more chicken-I don't think the recipe calls for enough to go with all the other ingredients. We eat this as a whole meal, so we like lots of chicken. Awesome summertime salad.

Good, but next time I'll use dark chocolate.  The marshmallows and the whipping cream made it sweet, but not deeply rich.  I added dulce de leche, a caramel-type sauce, for a turtle pie-like taste.
