Holy Cow, is this chocolatey!  I made this gluten-free, substituting corn starch for flour, and extra strong coffee (4x) for the chocolate liqueur. It got raves, but you can only eat a small amount.  Next time I will grease and flour the bottom of my pan.  [Note: walnuts have a lot of oil in them, and there is a fine line between ground walnuts and walnut butter.  You may want to add the flour to the nuts as you grind them.]

Made this for a dinner party... everyone loved it.  Just the right amount of chocolate flavor without being way over the top.  My only complaint was that it didn't taste cofee-y at all.... just chocolately.  Might need to add instant coffee.  Did use the tip with putting the flour in with the walnuts... worked great.

Wow, this is definitely a keeper!! Simple and fast- very chocolately, very decadent!  Wonderful for company.  As with the previous reviewer, I found it helpful to add flour when grinding the walnuts.  Looks and tastes even better when served with fresh raspberries (and a raspberry coulis if you have time).

Very rich and decadent. Comes together quickly. I too recommend lightly geasing and gflouring the bottom and sides.  Raspberries on top were a nice touch.

THIS IS A BROWNIE. It's a perfectly fine dessert, but I get the exact same texture and flavor from the one-bowl brownie recipe on the back of Baker's unsweetened chocolate, which is far easier to make.

The baking time didn't work for me, but I'm attributing that to my oven. My cake was not quite done after 45 minutes. This being said, the flavour of this cake was fantastic! It was so chocolatey and rich. I used extra strong coffee instead of the liquor. As another reviewer noted, this cake is more like brownies than traditional chocolate cake in my opinion. I will certainly make this again and again.

I made this recipe a few days ago and i had to convert some of the measurements to grams so I guesstimated for the chocolate and the cake came out beautifully. Everyone who tasted it asked for another piece it's addictive. Even my grandfather who is a picky eater liked it and my grandmother said it was "delightful". It's very hard to mess this cake up! ENJOY!

just awesome!!  I have made this cake twice.. i never get more than one piece- and it never lasts more than two hours in my house.  both times i haven't had any coffee liqueur in my cupboards, so the first time i subbed instant coffee and some rum, and the most recent time i made my own coffee liqueur of vodka, espresso, vanilla and sugar.  both times it was just exceptional. a truly decadent cake, but keep it in a safe place while it cools or you might not get a chance to taste any!

What a wonderful chocolate cake recipe!  I made this a couple of days ago cause I wanted to try something different for dessert.  I accidentally used unsweetened baking chocolate instead of semisweet, but added a little sugar while it was melting...turned out fine.  Also I didin't have any coffee liquor so used freshly brewed coffee instead..not a strong coffee flavor, but the cake was still a big hit with my husband who loves all things chocolate!

I just recently made this cake- it was very good. I used almonds instead of walnuts, and instant espresso instead of coffee liqueur. Add a few teaspoons of almond extract, and it was great! I highly recommend using high quality chocolate as well.

This is a great dessert to make for company. The texture was great, almost like a brownie, and I loved the addition of the ground walnuts. I would definitely make it again, and perhaps try it with some plain brewed coffee instead of the liquor. I did find the measurements for the glaze too high. I would use about half the chocolate, and skip the liquor.
