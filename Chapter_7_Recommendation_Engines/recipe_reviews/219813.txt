Consider yourself warned.  This cake is really rich and should be served in small amounts - with just a little bit of barely sweetened whipped cream.  I did use yellow cake from scratch as I am not too fond of mixes.  My partner who loves all things pineapple, banana, coconut and macadamia nut was in heaven.  Luckily, I had the brilliant idea of baking this up in two pans so that he could take one to work with him as we would never be able to eat it all ourselves.  Apparently, it disappeared during the morning coffee break.  I will likely be making this again.

Made it for a party last night and it was wonderful. 
I used up all the pineapple rings from the can and followed the recipe on the yellow cake mix box. The recipe called for 3 eggs, 1/2 cup water and 1/2 stick butter. No oil. I replaced the water from the pineapple juice from the can and the cake also had the pineapple flavor 
Thx for submitting

My wife just started a new job in Hawaii and it was my time to bring a treat in to work, so something Hawaiian seemed like a natural choice. I've never tried this recipe before so I didn't want to stray too much, but I did buy a "fresh" pineapple and coconut (we live in Kentucky, how fresh could they be?). Anyway it worked pretty well but was way too sweet. I would still use "fresh" coconut and pineapple but leave out 1/3 - 1/2 the brown sugar and substitute more of the "fresh coconut milk for the pineapple juice. BTW, we couldn't taste much bannana, so add 2-3 instead of 1.

I made this yesterday and my family loved it. I served it semi-warm with a scoop of coconut ice-cream. They all had seconds! I only made half recipe. I used a 9 inch round cake pan and cooked for 40 mins. We didn’t have leftovers.  Thanks for posting. 

That being said I have a few extra comments:  The ingredients list said white cake but the narrative said yellow (I used white). Also note that the cake mix size said 18.25 oz but that was slightly larger than the boxes at my market.  Finally I would have liked the author to specific sweetened or unsweetened coconut as it is an ingredient I don’t use a lot and questioned it. Given it didn’t specifically say sweetened I assumed un-sweetened which I couldn’t find it at my local market and too lazy to go to a second store so I used sweetened coconut.   The cake was sweet but not overly sweet as the other reviewer thought.   Finally I personally didn’t prefer the taste of the banana in the recipe but after my family was done they said they didn’t notice.

I   made this for our church luau party and it was a big hit.  I’ve already been asked to make it again.  I substituted chopped pecans for the  macadamia nuts.  This is a keeper!

Wonderful! Looking forward to making a couple of tweaks... perhaps a dash of rum into the topping.

Amazing recipe!  I tend to be a"from scratch" snob, so I was hesitant to make a recipe with boxed cake mix as an ingredient, but you truly cannot tell with this recipe.  I substituted oil for butter, pecans for macadamias.  I also used maraschino cherry juice instead of coconut water.  It turned out great and although pretty, the pineapple rings were hard to cut through while eating.  Second time, I substituted rings for crushed pineapple and was just as good. The ripe banana and flaked coconut are also great additions.  Will definitely be making this many times!

Wow!  I made it in a cast iron skillet because I didn't have a big enough platter to turn out a 9"x 13" cake on and it was a tight fit, but it only made a little mess in the oven.  It was soooo good!  I've decided the nuts are optional since my husband isn't a fan of them.  I'll be making this many times again!

Some unfortunate sticking at the end - specifically the macadamia nuts! But I stuck ‘em back on easy enough. Devilishly sweet! Made some fresh whipped cream for the top. Yummy!

Wonderful! The only thing I would change is far less brown sugar on the bottom. I also substituted applesauce for the oil. 

I do wonder how many people have a large enough platter to turn out a 9 x 13 cake onto? I know I didn't so I made two 9x9s instead and still had to turn them out onto cookie sheets.

I was looking for a last minute cake recipe using what I had on hand. I had chunked pineapple and no cherries, but the cake still turned out fabulous. I used my cast iron baking skillet. This is a keeper. Thanks for sharing.
