I took advice from other reviewers and made some changes.  I used a quart of half & half (instead of milk).  I added a tsp of ground mustard & tsp of worchesh sauce.  I also added some onion.  I kept with other ingredients (as well).  I used extra sharp cheddar & peppercorn jack.  I did not use the mozerella.  I lightly brushed top with bread crumbs.  Drizzled a little butter and topped with a little extra shredded cheddar.  It was an amazing texture.  Looked so & smelled so yummy!  Unfortunately, it was ruined when I followed baking instructions.  I thought 45 mins to an hour sounded a bit much, but followed instructions.  What a mistake!  I think it baked out the flavor along with the creamy texture.  20 min baking time, more realistic.  If you want crunchy on top, broil for about 3 mins after 20 mins of baking.  I might try making this again with major baking changes.  Oh yeah, after cooking noodles to al dente (about 7 mins) make sure you rinse in luke warm/cold water to prevent further cooking of pasta.  That's the secret to all pasta based casseroles!

I LOVE this recipe!  I remember making mac n cheese from scratch when I was a lot younger and was looking for a recipe that would give me that great taste.  This is it!!!  I left out the ham, used 12 oz macaroni since there is a lot of sauce, and added a teaspoon each of ground mustard and worcestershire sauce for extra flavor.  I also added some melted butter to bread crumbs and crumbled over the top for a nice crispiness.  It was sooo GOOD!!!  Thanx Allie!!!!

This was terrific macaroni and cheese!  Per RUBENETTE'S suggestion, I also left out the ham, used 12 oz macaroni, and added a teaspoon each of ground mustard and worcestershire sauce. I also added some bread crumbs over the top for a nice crispiness. I have now made it twice, once with shredded cheese, and once with cubed cheese, and I like the shredded cheese much better.

EXCELLENT!  I didn't make the recipe verbatim though.  I read a few reviews and made a few changes and it was wonderful.  Instead of using cubes of the three different kinds of cheeses, I used 4 cups of Kraft Classic Melts Four Cheese (American, Wisconsin Sharp Cheddar, Vermont White Cheddar and Monterey Jack).  It is shredded and didn't take long at all to melt.  Also, I didn't let the roux cook for 1-2 minutes.  As soon as the roux started to bubble, I slowly added the milk.  Instead of cayenne, I added 1/3 tsp. of chili powder.  And I only cooked it for 35 minutes - I noticed that if I had let it cook any longer, it would have dried out the top part.  Thanks Alyson for a great recipe!

Wonderful!!  I thought this was the best mac n' cheese I've ever made.  Even my husband who does not eat usually eat mac and cheese asked when I was going to make it again.  I made a few changes in the recipe however.  I also uses 12 oz not 8 of noodles.  I did not use mozzarella at all but used 7.5 oz of both the Cheddar and Jack (shredded not cubed).  I also used milk and 1/2 & 1/2 not just milk, and I added more cayenne pepper.  Thank you again Alyson for this wonderful recipe!  It's become one of our favorites.  ENJOY!!

I made this once on a whim, and have made it several times since.  It's one of our household favorites.  I try to make it at least once a month; if I don't, I am sure to be reminded and asked!
I omit the ham because I don't eat red meat.  Once in while I will add crispy turkey bacon for that meaty flavour.  
The three cheeses are a nice combination, but I find it tastes excellent with just sharp cheddar and jack cheeses.
Depending on my mood, sometimes I alternate chili powder for cayenne.  They both work well.
Sometimes I dare to use half cream (or half & half) and half milk.  Eight bites makes this a meal!  Especially excellent in winter.  
Excellent recipe, Allie!  A definite keeper, and permanant addition to my "usuals."

I loved this recipe!I didn't use the ham,though. And whoever said to add a smoked gouda cheese to this recipe..was wrong! If you are using this recipe for the first time, do not listen to that person! that cheese will overpower everyother cheese in the recipe(and ruin it!)I added 8-oz. instead of 5,because I like mine a lil' cheesy. And make sure to WARM up the milk! if you don't, it will ruin the sauce(i did this and wondered why it came out so bad).I microwaved it until I could see the milk "skin"..this recipe taste better than my dad's!

I made this last night and followed the directions perfectly and was disappointed.  I am a cheese lover so I thought the amount of cheese it called for was fine, but upon tasting it, the dish had way too much mozz cheese, after eating a few bites I felt 500lbs.  My daughter who is 3 tried it and passed on it.

YUM!  I doubled the amount of ham and used shredded cheeses so they would melt easier.  It is really important that the milk be warm in order for the sauce to come together properly too.  I just microwaved the milk for a couple minutes to avoid scalding it.  This was really great and it made a lot, so we had leftovers.

My family loved it. My daughter who is very PICKY in what she eats, ate it all up. She said it was the best mac and cheese she had. I would make it again. I thought it had too much of a flour taste and not enough cheesy taste. I think next time not so much flour.

VERY GOOD! This one should be the highst rated one on here as I have tried most of them. By far, this is my fav and I like that it does not have processed cheese in it. Per other suggestions I substituted cheddar cheese for the mozz, and added tsp mustard powder and Worcestershire sauce. PERFECT! I am making this for company tonight.

***This is Allie who submitted this recipe. Please
be advised that I am a cook who learned the old
fashiond way and does not measure!!! I submitted
this recipe trying to duplicate in my mind what I
actually put in the pot and failed. I realized that I do NOT use a full pound of pasta, but only a 1/2 lb.  I do use a full quart of milk
though.  It sounds like alot, but if you cook the
macaroni aldente, then when you add the sauce and
bake, the macaroni will soak up the extra sauce.
Please make sure you let the finished dish rest
10-15 mins. before serving so it will set up. But
that will take care of the few comments about being not as creamy as it sounded.  I'm very sorry
about the mishap, and THANKS to all of you for the
great reviews!!!!   Alyson Pray

Made with the modifications (w. sauce, mustard) and added garlic salt and seasoned salt - still pretty bland. Next time would make wth american/velveeta or more cheddar, less of the white cheese. I skipped the ham because we didn't have any, but I think that would have helped. Maybe add some green peas or broccoli? Anyway, this recipe needs work.

This is a classic.  For my family, I used ground beef instead of ham, and ziti pasta which was all I had, and all shredded cheddar cheese, with breadcrumbs on top.  Baked only 25 minutes. The next day, for lunch, it cuts easily ino pretty squares. Great recipe!

This is a great, simple recipe. My niece declared it the "best dinner ever".  I added peas because it's the most kid-friendly vegetable I could think of.

Very good.  My 16 year old only likes mac and cheese from the blue box but he liked this.  I used a mix of brie, string, American and sharp cheddar cheeses (cleaning out the fridge) and it was very creamy.  Topped it with sliced American cheese and Fresh Gourmet Crispy Onions.  Leftovers heated up well.

CHEESY MAC & BEEF!  Yummy!  Instead of the ham, I added 1 pound of extra lean ground beef that I cooked with 1/2 white onion. I used whole wheat rotini pasta and 7 ounces of shredded cheddar and 7 ounces of shredded monterey jack. After I mixed in the ground beef/onion mix, I put it in a 9x13 casserole dish and topped with a little bit more shredded cheese, bread crumbs and sprinkled w/paprika.  Next time maybe I will add some mustard.  All in all a great meal!  Thanks!

Great base recipe.  I added some cajun seasoning and sprinkled the top with bread crumbs and a little sugar.  The sugar idea was from an Italian friend.  My 10 year old son thought it was the best!  Use whatever cheeses you have on hand.

This is my new mac and cheese recipe. Yes, I made substitutions, but that was only out of necessity (I didn't have ham, I had chicken, I ran out of milk and substituted half-and-half). If I'd had the actual ingredients, it would have needed 6 stars. Both my kids loved it (unusual), and it was so nice to hear my SO say "It smells soooo good in here" when he came home from work.

Really good!  My 9 year old didn't like it and macaroni is his favorite.  The rest of us loved it!  I think I'll use less mozzarella and more cheddar for my son next time, but I'm definitely making it again!

Extremely delicious and easy to make.  I did add a few things to it, however... instead of ham, I added about 10 slices of bacon and about half a bag of frozen peas.  I also added a little garlic powder to the sauce mixture.  My dad even loved it and he's always hated mac n cheese.  Will definitely keep this recipe!  THANKS!  ^_^

Great mac n' cheese! I followed the top reviewer's advice and added a teaspoon each of ground mustard and worchestershire to the sauce. I also added one chicken boullion and a dash (to taste) of dried onion flake into the sauce, and added panko bread crumbs with a little drizzle of butter on top and baked for 25 minutes. YUM!!

I vegify it and add a 1/2 cup frozen, drained spinach and puree it with the milk and also add 1/4 cup very fine chop carrot and sometimes 1/4 cup fine chop cauliflower.  It's a great way to sneak in veggies for the kids! Good recipe which doesn't need half and half or any more fat than it's got already.  It's creamy and cheesy in a nice balance.

This was OK.  The flavor was very bland, but I do like the basic recipe.  I will make again, but I will replace the mozzarella with more cheddar for more flavor.  I also took others suggestions and topped with butter sauteed panko.  It gave it a good crusty top.

The only changes that I made to this recipe, was to use different amounts of each cheese and to top it with the Panko bread crumbs toasted in butter, as someone had suggested.  It turned out wonderful and what little was left over heated up great, not drying out or anything.

8oz mac = 2 cups uncooked/4 cups cooked 15oz cheese = 2 cups.  I used 2 1/2 cups because it didn't look orange enough. added 1/2 cup cooked squash. Next time, try less milk and don't bake.  It was nice and creamy before it went in the oven but the cheese separated during baking.  2 cups milk, microwaved for 2 minutes worked.  This time I used one yam, pureed for the entire recipe.

Terrific recipe!!!  Everything is well balanced to start so it is a fun recipe to play with.  IMO, use more ham if you want a meal out of it.  I used a thick cut hamsteak and the amount of ham was perfect for our liking.  I omitted the salt since i used a lot more ham.  Also, added buttered panko bread crumb topping.  Served with steamed broccoli as a side.  Great meal on a freezing cold WI night!!!  Thanks.

Out of all of the Mac & Cheese recipes on this site, this is my favorite.  I like my mac & cheese simple, flavorful and creamy.  A couple of pointers: It's really important that when making the roux you cook it properly.  If you don't, you'll end up with a grainy uncooked flour textured sauce.  You want to achieve a blonde roux, and if you're not sure how to do that, Allrecipes has a great article on it here: 
http://allrecipes.com/HowTo/Making-Roux-Step-by-Step/Detail.aspx

You'll end up with a beautiful creamy sauce before you've even added any cheese.  
Omissions/Additions: I did made some changes, but they're based on personal taste/preference:  1) Omitted the ham - because I don't like it. 2) Increased the amount of macaroni to 12 oz.  However, do not increase to an entire 16 oz. box.  I made that mistake once and ended up with way too much pasta and not enough of the sauce. 3) Added 1 tsp of dry mustard and 1 tsp of Worcestershire sauce  4) Omitted cayenne pepper - I don't like it. 5) Use 15 oz. total of any combination cheese you like!  I used 5 oz of cheddar, 5 oz. of Monterey Jack, 5 oz. of Velveeta.  6)  I don't like my mac & cheese to have a crispy top layer, so I baked for 20 - 30 min.  Everything is cooked already, so you only want the mac & cheese to "set".  That's it!  The beauty of this recipe is the roux and the amount of cheese.  You can modify the types of cheeses you use per your preference.  I've used this recipe religiously since I discovered it in 2002!

This turned out great, with a few changes based on other reviews. I omitted the ham, used 12oz of macaroni, and added a bit of ground mustard and worcestershire. I topped it with a little leftover shredded mozz which browned up nicely; only baked it about 30-35 min and it was perfect.

Was good.  The whole family enjoyed it.  I was hoping the sauce would be creamier, but it was kind of pasty and chunky.  Did the recipe exactly as described.

Amazing!  I loved this mac and cheese! The sauce turned out perfectly.  It was just cheesy enough.  I used medium cheddar, old white cheddar and jack cheeses because I find mozzarella too bland.  I also didn't use ham.

OK, so hubby informs me yesterday morning that a pre-Thanksgiving meal is to take place at his office today and that he is expected to bring something.  With too many desserts already on the list, he is convinced a side dish is in order.  After making several suggestions (none of which he liked) I finally asked, "What about homemade Mac & Cheese"?  Now, I should mention at this point that I have always been known as someone who cooks everything fast and on HIGH...not to mention the fact that the only Macaroni and cheese I had EVER made came in a blue box.  BUT...I figured,  "How hard can it be"?  

Well...thankfully, I found this site and this recipe!!!  I had purchased everything we needed and was ready to cook when hubby got home from work last night...and, for what its worth, we actually had a blast!  Who knew cooking could be so much fun??  

AND...here's the real kicker!   Hubby called today after the dinner had ended; two different people told him it was the best mac & cheese they had ever eaten!!!  So...he comes home tonight, bringing what was left...approximately the equivalent of 2 large serving spoons full and THAT WAS IT!!!  (Oh, and did I mention we TRIPLED the recipe??)

Anyway...absolutely amazing!! I will definitely make it again!  I did take the advice of a couple of people who posted reviews and we, too, left out the ham.  Also, we used shredded cheese, rather than cubed and half & half rather than milk.  

No more blue box for me!!!  I'm a convert!

This wasn't too bad as far as homemade mac and cheese goes.  I did not add the mozzarella, because I knew that if I did it would end up *very* grainy in texture - instead I used a package of yellow cheddar, a package of extra-sharp white cheddar, and M. Jack.  The dish seems to do fine without the mozzarella, so I'll probably keep the change.  The taste was very good - if you're looking for "creamy" mac and cheese, though, you'll be sorely disappointed.  I happen to prefer mac and cheese a little firm, so this recipe worked out well for me.  My partner, however, *devoured* this dish.    And I do mean DEVOURED it.  He's been snacking on it all week!!!

this was kinda tricky for me. was confused by us customary system. haven't noticed that switch on the page. Anyways, i used less milk and i got rather paste than sauce. I noticed the difference while baking it, so i put it out and add the rest of the milk. then i place it back for some 15 minutes and was fine. At least i think, never tried Mac n Cheese before. It's not common in our country...anyway, thanks for the recipe, was awesome:)

I thought the recipe was pretty dang good.  only thing I done to change 'er was instead of baking heres what I did:  I cooked the noodles the same way was pretty good. But then I just put em on a plate and popped em in the microwave with 4 or 5 kraft singles on em after i took em out of their package. for about 45 seconds.  THEN Dig in!!!

Turned out great!  Best mac and cheese I've ever had, really.  I increased the cheese ratio with good results, and also replaced ham with very good kielbasa.

So easy and AMAZING.  Here's my twist.  I make as specified, but use spiral noodles.  Instead of ham, I use small sauted chicken chunks in oilve oil, garlic and cayenne.  Otherwise, the same.  Cuts into squares but is creamy and loved by everyone, even my kids!  I make the roux and throw the sauteed chicken into it the night before then the next day, heat up and add the cheese, boil the pasta and bake for dinner.  One of my favorite recipes...make several times already.

Good recipe to use as a basic guideline. I omitted the mozzarella and ham. I substituted 1 cup of heavy cream for the milk and increased the pasta to 12 oz (penne). I also cut the baking time to 20 minutes and broil for 1 minute. I definitely used a good 4 shakes of cayenne.   It comes out very buttery and you can cut and eat it with a knife and fork. Not all sloppy and spoony and bland. The cheese incorporated nicely, but it will clump together if you turn the heat off before mixing with the pasta, so I'd just leave it on low while mixing. A little more cream might make it incorporate more easily. I also highly advise using fresh-ground black pepper. I might add pulverized garlic next time.

This was so, so very good! Oh my goodness. Its like heaven in a spoon. As RUBENETTE suggested, I also left out the ham, used 12 oz macaroni, and added a teaspoon each of ground mustard and worcestershire sauce. I also added some bread crumbs over the top and it made it even more yummy and crispy.  Will make again and again. Wish there was some left over to eat right now!

This is gooood eatin'.  I added another 1/4 lb. ham (I love ham) and used jalapeno Jack (gives it a nice little bite).  Adding 8 oz. mixed frozen veggies gives it a little more color and texture.

We used half & half instead of milk to make it richer, and didn't use mozzerella at all since so many reviews said that it made it too stringy and didn't add flavor. We did use extra sharp cheddar and a garlic jack cheese - yum! Sprinkle some breadcrumbs on top and you're good to go.

I love this recipe. I tripled the sauce and used 2 lbs of pasta and served it to a large crowd (25-30). The use of warm milk to make the cheese sauce sped up the process greatly. I'm going to remember to use that trick again. I also added mini hot dogs and crushed buttery, round crackers on top. People couldn't stop eating it. I've rarely served anything that received such rave reviews. A hit with all ages. Thanks!

This is my go-to meal when I bring dinners to new moms or families in need.  Everyone loves it--and it is kid-friendly!  My only changes are I tend to use a bit more cheese and I use Sharp Cheddar, Swiss and Mozzarella as the cheeses, and I put panko bread crumbs on top for some crunch.

I LOVED this macaroni and cheese! Such a nice change from the typical boxed stuff and the three cheeses go together so nicely. I did make some changes - left out the ham, cayenne pepper, and used margarine instead of butter, but it was delicious none the less. The only thing that stinks is the heaviness of this dish. You always want to eat more but it leaves you feeling VERY full very quickly. But it's safe to say I will definitely be making this meal again.

So good and super easy to make.  I did use 16 oz of macaroni and there was plenty of sauce for that.  I loved that it contained no processed cheese.  I also added onion powder and garlic powder for a little flavor.  Came out delicious.  Will definitely make again.

OMG! this was my first time making macaroni n cheese, it was really great. My family loved it, I used half in half in stead of milk that what I had and also only used 4 tablespoons of flour and butter. I will make this again soon.

I made two trays of this for my son's 17th birthday party and him and his friends went crazy for it!!  I didnt have cayenne pepper, so I substituted with a few drops of Franks Red Hot Sauce.  I also followed Rubenette's suggestion and added the Worcheshire Sauce.  I topped it off with a handful of bread crumbs and melted butter and it really came out terrific!!  GREAT RECIPE!!

I make this yummy dish every Thanksgiving and the only reason there is ever leftovers is because now I purposely make two trays, one to serve at dinner and the other for people to take home as leftovers. The great thing about this dish is that it's very versatile, you can swap out any of the cheeses listed for another type of cheese to suit your tastes, also you can add other things like bacon, a can of diced tomatoes, turkey, jalapeños, whatever!   Also for a creamier sauce you can add a can of evaporated milk (just reduce the amount of milk accordingly)  The dish is very high calorie but it’s perfect for special occasions.

I've been looking for a good mac and cheese recipe for awhile, and this is the best one I've found.  I left the ham out, to make it vegetarian.  I took some other reviewers suggestions, and used 16 oz of macaroni instead of 8.  I think it would have been much too soupy otherwise.  I also sauteed some panko breadcrumbs in 2 tbsp of melted butter, and then added some shredded parmesan cheese and sprinkled it on top before baking.

this is a good base to start with.  before you start this recipe, saute some garlic, bacon and onions and then put them aside and add to the mix after all the milk is in. i just use cheddar and jack cheese. it is also good to add some white truffle oil to the onions and bacon.  this recipe needs to 2-3x the amount of pasta or it will be a soupy mix

While I found this recipe tough (not being too much of a "cooker"), the result was worth the messy kitchen and the time spent.  This mac and cheese rivals that of my grandmother, and my husband said it was the best he'd ever had! Will definately be making it again.

(For those of you who have problems with measurements, like me, I used 3 cups of milk, which appeared to be perfect!)

As a single dad of two small kids it's hard to find a one pot dish to please all of us.  My son doesn't like red sauce, but we all love cheese.  I like hot and spicy, but the kids like it bland.

I took some of ally's cheese recipe and mixed in half the pasta.  Then I added some hot pepper and spices to the rest of the cheese sauce and mixed that with the rest of the pasta.  I put both portions on opposite sides of the baking dish and "voile!"  

This dish went over like a box of twinkies at a fat farm.  I now have a one pot dish that has everyone coming back for more.  

Thanks Ally!

I thought this recipe was great!!! I have to admit that I don't like it when people say the recipe was great and then proceed to make all kinds of changes..so I will start by saying that this recipe is great by itself but for my taste preferences I just used sharp cheese cause I like a strong cheese flavor and I also used a few drops of hot sauce like Franks and some grated nutmeg.

awesome as written BUT you HAVE to follow others' suggestion and WARM the milk or it causes the flour to clump and is not an easy fix, can ruin the smooth base you're after!  Delicious recipe, thanks for sharing!

Ok, this turned out horribly for me, I don't think it's the recipe per say, I think it's just me, I can never ever ever get mac and cheese right, it always tastes like nothingt, no flavor, such a waste of cheese....this one came out dry!

I made this with a few modifications because of what I had on hand. I increased the pasta to 12oz as others have suggested, and used mozz. and cheddar cheeses. I also doubled the ham to use up the Easter leftovers (1/4 pound isn't much for a 9x13 pan anyway, IMO). Added 1tsp powdered mustard and Worcestershire. DH gave it 5 stars, I gave it 3 because it was way too thick and creamy for my tastes, so overall, this received 4 stars.

This was great! I've made several mac n' cheese recipes, and I think what makes this one so good is the quart of milk. Many recipes only use a couple of cups of milk, turning out dry. It turned out very creamy, even reheated. Perfect! I used Louisiana hot sauce instead of cayenne. YUM

This didn't turn out well for me.  I followed the directions; however, it has a very floury taste and the cheese flavor was missing something.  Because I didn't want to throw it away, I added a large block of cubed Velveeta before I added the ham and macaroni, put the lid on the saucepan, and let the Velveeta melt.  This definately helped the flavor.  I think I'll keep looking for the perfect recipe.

Wow - this was super easy AND delicious. What I loved about this recipe is that it can be made as is and served as a creamy style mac n cheese, or can also be baked and be more set. We loved it both ways. I also threw in some crumbled bacon and it took it to a new level of yummy complexity. I really think the mustard is key - it seems to amplify all of the flavors. Make this!!

This is my go to recipe for mac and cheese. I love mac and cheese, and I make this recipe during the cooler months of Fall and Winter, since I think it is a heavy type of dish. I have also added imitation crabmeat in place of using ham and that tasted yummy as well.

I used to make a macaroni and cheese recipe from my father that has been known as "Michael's Mac & Cheese". After trying this recipe and making some small changes over the years of using this recipe, it is definitely the best Mac & Cheese recipe around. I have been in search of the best Mac & Cheese and I haven't found one anywhere. The reason why this recipe is so good is because of the roux. Take the time it's worth it. I have also added 12 strips of bacon cooked in the oven and coarsely chopped in the food processor.

I made this for a quick dinner Friday night mostly out of desperation and looking for a comfort food for all involved.

I used a combination of extra sharp white cheddar and the monterey jack, as I was all out of mozzerella. Really gave the cheese sauce a nice bite. I also used turkey ham, which I've always found
to be cheaper and a little healthier.

I found that this really only took me
20 minutes to pull together and stick in the oven and my family was thrilled with it that we never really are with the boxed bullhonky. This dish disappeared 
quickly and we all were satisfied.

I think that if I make this next time, I'll add some steamed broccoli cut into
chunks instead of eating them on the side.

Ugh, I made this for Christmas dinner and that will teach me to stray from my grandma's recipe. My grandmother's recipe is 100x better and 100x easier. It did not taste as cheesy as it should have and it was just bland and even cooking the smell didn't please me. Sorry, but I would rather have the stuff in the box than this.

Very good dish.  The "only" thing I think I might do different next time is not add quite as much montery jack and instead just increase the amount of cheddar.  I find that I'm more of a cheddar cheese person.

This was nice and cheesy, and so rich!  I could barely finish my first helping before I was done.  I will definitely make this a house staple.

I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS RECIPE!  This was the first time I made mac n' cheese, and it was a hit. I altered the recipe a bit.  I didn't add the ham and cayenne pepper.  I made it with 4 cheeses.  I topped it off with shredded sharp cheese the last 15 minutes.  My boyfriend at the whole thing in two days!!!

This was DELICIOUS!  I made a few minor changes and it is definitely a keeper.  I left out the ham and monterey jack cheese (didn't have any at the time), just added more of the cheddar & mozzarella.  Then before baking I topped it with italian seasoned bread crumbs.  SO YUMMY!  Thanks Alyson for sharing a wonderful recipe.

I nixed the ham, used 12oz of macaroni, used only sharp cheddar cheese, and for the milk I used about 1/3 heavy cream.  Smoked chipotle tobasco sauce also made an excellent addition - this was great!  I sprinkled a little extra cheese on top for the last 5 minutes of baking.  I'll definitely be serving this to the future in-laws.

I made this for Thanksgiving and thought I had made too much.  I didn't bring any of it home!  It was such a hit!  I am now in charge of this dish every year.

It doesn't seem like you could screw up mac and cheese, but somehow I did.  Granted this is my first time making mac with real cheese; I normally make Velveeta style.  This came out very grainy.  The flavor was pretty good, but I just couldn't get over the texture.  Is it supposed to be like this??  The description does say creamy.  Regardless, I am still searching the the ultimate mac and cheese.

I truly enjoyed the Macaroni and cheese for this recipe.  Of course, it wasn't as good as good ol' southern Mac & Cheese, but darn near close.  I will definitely make this again.......

Very good.  I added a top layer of Italian Bread Crumbs 30 minutes before removing it from the oven and it really made it.

This is really good, but I always use 2% evaporated milk in recipes for cream sauce & it worked great in this.  I didn't have ham, but mixed in some broccoli & red pepper flakes, used Mexican blend cheese in place of the mozzarella so it would be less stringy, & crumbled crispy bacon & buttered crumbs on top.  It was wonderful & I'm sure I'll make it again!

I usually prefer mac n cheese recipes with cheddar cheese but this one changed my mind. I know cheddar was in the recipe, but omit it and it'll taste so much better!

I just so happened to have mozzarella and monterey jack cheese in the fridge so I thought I'd make some mac n cheese. I normally don't used roux's but thought I could manage this one time. 

For the milk, I would suggest eyeballing until the roux gets to your satisfaction. If it gets too thin, add more flour.

Also try eyeballing the cheese to your satisfaction. I noticed that Lucerne & Kraft cheeses (with cream-cheese added to it) works best. 

To the cayenne pepper, I added a ton of red pepper flakes and about 1 tablespoon of cayenne (pepper doesn't bother my family) as well as some freshly ground black pepper.

To the cheese mix, I also added sour cream for extra creaminess.

Oh and add parmesan! It gives a nice extra kick of flavor. 

I will definitely double this recipe next time, it was finished within the day.

Great job, Allison. Wonderful recipe! I used a special blend of cheeses since I couldn't find monterey Jack in Spain. I used the mozzarella

 and cheddar though. The only thing I did differently was I omitted the ham. My fiancé asked me to add the ham in next time. I made this dish for my fiancé and his parents and they loved it. Thank you for sharing this great recipe. I love the consistency of milk and flour - nice creamy taste.

Very tasty and perfectly creamy.  I loved the ham in there.  I took note of other reviewers and used some half and half and the rest was milk.  Also, I baked for 20min and broiled for a few more.  The texture was perfect.

This was pretty good, but slightly bland.  I even omitted the mozzarella and used equal parts sharp cheddar and Monterey Jack. I also added 1 tsp ground mustard and 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce.  I might try it again and play around with increasing the cayenne or adding other spices. It's a good base recipe.

Very good Mac & Cheese ! Almost as good as my mother made :) I used 8 oz Sharp orange cheddar and 8 oz mild white cheddar. My wife had never had real baked mac & cheese, she heated Kraft Velveeta and poured it over cooked mac so she loves this !

I had never made a roux before so I wasn't sure how it would turn out.  I doubled the recipe and added two handfuls of extra macaroni as well as two cups of chopped broccoli instead of ham.  Used mostly sharp cheddar, cheddar jack and covered the top with ~ cup of mozzarella and it turned out great.

I love this one... I made it the way it says the first time minus the ham around Thanksgiving and my family loved it. I then made it again for Chirstmas , but I left out the hame again and switch the cheeses to 15 oz of Velveeta. It is so much creamer this way. I am not required to make this version for every family gathering now.

This was a very good twist on an old favorite.  I think the roux must be the key to its abundant flavor.  And like it says, if all ingredients are lined up on the counter, making this dish is about the easiest thing you'll do all week.  My whole family really enjoyed this dish.

Nirvana. As others have done, I used a whole 16oz of macaroni. I omitted the ham. For the cheeses, I used Cabot cheddar, jack, and some Chihuahua (Mexican white melting cheese). I couldn't have asked for better mac and cheese.

i didn't follow the recipe exactly, only used cheddar and jack.  used a pint of half and half and about half a cup more 2% milk.  didn't use ham.  added some shredded cheddar in with the macaroni before the sauce was added to hold together a bit. so good. my fiancee was very impressed and i will be definitely making this again.  thank you for the recipe.  oh, and a pound of macaroni is totally doable, there is plenty of cheese sauce.

This is very good, great for potlucks!  I made some adjustments: I used 1 lb. of noodles, 1 lb. velveeta cheese with cheddar and monterey jack, no ham and added 2 tsp. dry mustard and 1 tsp. worsestershire as suggested by another reviewer. I also mixed 1/2 c. panko bread crumbs, 1/2 c. grated parmesan, and 3-4 T. melted marg. for a topping. I found that I needed to add a little more milk (1 cup?) to thin the cheese sauce so it didn't get too thick when it baked.

Because of the amount of sauce this makes, I used a full one pound box of noodles so it wasn't too soupy.  I added breadcrumbs to the top when baking and it turned out great!  Everyone wanted seconds.  This is the mac and cheese recipe I will use from now on.

This recipe is good, however I add a few of my own personal touches in order to make it better.  First, I don't add nearly as much milk as stated in the recipe... this makes it more creamy and less soupy.  Next I like to use 8 ounces of velveeta cheese and 8 ounces of sharp cheddar cheese instead so it gives the macaroni a little kick.  Also, A great idea is to mix breadcrumbs with butter and spread them over the top of the macaroni and cheese before it goes in the oven to bake!

Really didnt care for this.  Maybe I am not a homemade mac n cheese lover.  Did not care for the consistency at all.  Nobody in our house cared for it.

This was really good.  Just watch the baking time- 60 minutes would be way too long.  I did 25 and it was perfect.  I used about 12 oz. of wagon wheel pasta, havarti instead of mozz, extra sharp white cheddar, and pepper jack instead of montery jack.  It was really good- I had to make myself stop taking more and more.  It was a big hit with my husband, and 5-year old and one year old.  My baby just kept eating it long after everyone else was done!  Lol.  My only complaint is that it took a long time to prepare, and dirtied more pots than the usual mac and cheese, what with the heating up of the milk (I didn't have a clean microwave safe bowl that was big enough though.)  I did use the ham and really enjoyed that.  Served this with green beans.

I love this recipe, I was looking for a good mac & cheese recipe some time ago, and found this one. The problem is that my fiance HATES anything that didn't come out of a box, a product of his upbringing. I was looking desperately for something creamy, and that would please him. This was it! I added dry mustard and pepperjack though, and didn't use the "hot" spices, because he's not a big fan of those. I substituted pepperjack and dry mustard which gave it a really  nice flavor too. I also want to stress that your sauce will not turn out if you scald the milk, you have to make sure it's warm, otherwise the cheeses won't blend correctly. Thanks so much!

This was great macaroni! :)  I overcooked the sauce, so the texture wasn't what it should've been, but that's my fault.  The taste is great! I topped with italian style bread crumbs then sprinkled the paprika.  I will make this again.

This macaroni recipe is a great combination of a traditional baked macaroni and the more modern creamy kind. Has aspects and flavors of both. The jack cheese gives it a nice kick but some younger children may be skeptical (mine had to be forced to try it, and then loved it). Made with "The Best Meatloaf" (also from this site). The flavors compliment and they cook at the same temperature. I made a double batch of this recipe and froze a portion. Ate it 2 weeks later and it was just as good. Allie - thanks for a great mac & cheese recipe to add to my collection.

Not bad. I would suggest not using as much mozza and using strong cheese to add flavor.  The key to making good nac and cheese is the cheese.

I've been meaning to write in but keep forgetting. This is the BEST mac & cheese recipe ever! I made it again last night per a special request from my boyfriend. The only thing I do differently is omit the ham (non-pork eater) and I add a little bit of montery pepper jack cheese to give it a little kick. Love it!!!

I made this recipe for  pasta night for my daughters track team. I needed something quick and easy to have ready when 19 girls arrived!  I followed the recipe to the letter.  There wasn't a bite left when they were done (I did double the recipe) and they have all requested that it be sent for tonights pasta night at somebody elses house!

Attention all Veggies!

Instead of 1/4 pound ham I used 3/4 cup chopped brocoli and 1/3 cup diced zuchini. To get that "hammy" taste I used smoked gouda instead of cheddar.

This recipe still sorely needed a cheesy crust. Next time I would add shredded cheddar and breadcrumbs on top.

After reading all the recipes I didn't quite understand what they meant by the texture.  It is indeed different.  It's not creamy.  It's more like noodles with cheese sections.  Although it is like a recipe of my grandmothers in consistency, I prefer a more creamier texture.  I used only shredded sharp and mild cheese(a little more than the recipe called for), no ham, or cayenne pepper.  Be careful when adding milk to roux, it can burn very quickly before boiling.

Oh my GOD! That's all I can say when I bite into this dish! It is SOOOOO good. Also, I have added Pepperjack cheese to the recipe and it will have you in tears. Cheesy, delicious, and a hint of spicy. You can't go wrong with this recipe.

Fantastic!  I have made this recipe a few times and LOVE it.  In fact, my whole family loves this.  I omit the ham out of personal choice and think it turns out great.  I do use extra chedar cheese (extra sharp) and cut back on the mozzarella.  The other thing that I add are sauted oninons to the sauce.  Over all this is one of my favorites and definitely a keeper!

This is a good recipe. I only used sharp cheddar cheese and since we don't eat ham at our house i did not include it. I also used 12oz box of macaroni after reading other reviews. I think next time i'll add bread crumbs on top to make it crispier.

I made this dish for my 4-year old niece's birthday party and it was a big hit among both kids and adults.  The second time I made it, I used extra sharp cheddar and substituted half the milk with cream for a creamier texture.  The whole family loves it.

This was fun to make, though definitely being one of the "cooking-challenged" I think I used too much milk, so the whole thing was kind of bland.  Going to try less milk and more seasoning and see what happens.  The ham was the best part!

I made this for my teenage daughter and her friends, and it was a huge hit! I think next time I would double the pasta. It was too much sauce and not enough pasta, although I substituted mezzo penne for the elbow macaroni, so I don't know if that would make a difference?  I think you could use any cheese combination you liked for this recipe, so it would be fun to experiment. I can't imagine using half & half, though, because it was already so thick and rich. I used 2% milk. I also added a panko crumb topping (panko mixed with butter) for the last 15 minutes of bake time, because my daughter loves a topping on her mac & cheese. I will definitely be making this again!

This is a very good recipe and I like it.  However my favorite mac and cheese recipe of all time is Giada DeLaurentiis' mac and cheese.

My son loved it; it was great to say that I made homemade macaroni!  I would recommend using diced ham and not cubed.  A ham loving child will pick out the cubes, diced would allow the ham to penetrate more of the mix, we will use diced next time.

This was a really good recipe.  I didn't have any ham so I used hotdogs instead.  Also, I used a 16oz package of macaroni instead of 8oz.

One word...EXCELLENT!  Thanks for posting this delicious recipe!  I'm generally not a fan of homemade mac & cheese. It always seems too dry to me, but this was sooooo good. Creamy and perfectly cheesy.

Thank you Allie.  This was delicious. I did make one change due to a milk-sensitive hubbie - I used chicken broth instead of milk. Perfectly creamy, cheesy...a delight!

Yummo! This was really really good. We made it as the recipe stated just throwing some breadcrumbs and parmesan cheese on the top before baking for good measure and it was perfect. Not perfectly good for you but perfect as far as comforting mac and cheese goes. I will be retrying this recipe with different variations of cheese in the future.

Yumm... the ultimate in comfort food! I made this to go with The Best Meatloaf (so I ommitted the ham) and it was sooo good!  My kids loved it!!!  I used 5 oz. of jack/cheddar mix shredded, 5 oz. of mozz shredded, and 5 oz of kraft American Cheese slices that I wanted to get rid of.  I then topped with about 1/2 cup of panko bread crumbs mixed with about 2 TB melted butter.  Cooked for about 40 minutes--broiled for the last couple mins to brown the bread crumbs.  Oh, used 2 cups skim and 2 cups 2% (warmed in micro for a min) and it was plenty creamy!!  A definite keeper!

This is the best mac n’ cheese I ever tasted. I been using this recipe for years now and finally decided to write a review.  People beg me to make this, that's how great it is. Its the truest form of comfort food and has become a regular at my Thanksgiving table as well as BBQ's. I leave out the ham but I follow the recipe to the tee and its always, always a hit. I have even prepared it a day ahead and throw it in the oven an hour before we sit down to eat! GREAT RECIPE!

I love this! So I changed the recipe around a little bit, I didn't use ham and I used Velveeta cheese for my cheddar and added several other cheeses to it, I also used half and half to make it creamier. I've used 2% milk and came out a little grainy, but whole milks works nicely too. I kept all the spices and added garlic and onion powder to the sauce and the topping. I baked it for 20 mins and then broiled it for about 1 min 30 sec to get the "crunchy" topping. Everyone loves it!

This recipe is great.  I make it all of the time.  The only thing I do differently is not add the meat and use it for a side dish.  My sister-in-law calls me for it constantly too.  Now she makes it out of all organic ingredients and they all love it.

Very good!  I just used one small ham steak and wasn't sure if it would be enough but it was plenty.  Make sure you leave enough time for it to set the 20 minutes!

Awesome. I made this last night and boy it beats the box kind ten fold and that's skipping the HAM. I added 5 ounces of Dubliner cheese and gave it a little kick. I mixed the sauce in just enough to coat the macaroni and spooned some on top (I have about 1 1/4 cup leftover, good for fondue). Baked for 45 minutes or so. The top was nice and chewy, the inside was perfectly cooked. I suggest that you keep it at about 1.5 to 2 inches thick, so it cooks evenly and less time. This will now be a staple recipe for get togethers.

Delicious is the right word here!!! We had a  huge ham for Easter which meant lots of leftovers to use up, this recipe  was perfect!  My few moderations are: I used a whole box of elbow macaroni (1 lb) and crushed up some french fried onions for the top, baked 30 minutes .  I never made a white sauce before so I was worried it would be horrible but with these easy to follow directions it came out great, Thanks!!!

This basic recipe is a staple in our house. I make this often and its actually easy and quick once you do it a few times. DO use more pasta than is required. You really can use close to a 1lb of pasta with this amount of sauce. Make sure your roux is thick before you add the cheese. I sometimes replace a 1/2 to one cup of heavy cream in place of same amount of milk - makes it so creamy but does make it much richer. Also- pasta needs to be JUST al dente and not overcooked when you bake it. I use whatever cheese and macaroni I have on hand. My favorite is to use sharp cheddar and I sometimes add some Emeril's Essence in it for a kick when bringing to a party. For kids its great just as is. Good with cheddar cheese and bread crumbs on top as well. I made this with leftover Easter ham and my kids devoured it.

I'm on the fence with this one.  Half the family liked it and half didn't. The consistency was great, but the taste was kind of bland (ended up putting on grated parmesan before eating it).  I added ground mustard (1TSP) and a little more cheese (I used all shredded).  I didn't add the ham.  I made a topping out of shredded cheddar and panko bread crumbs and that was the best part! I will make this again, but I think it needs 2 stronger cheeses instead of 2 mild ones.  I think maybe I'll try gorgonzola or Vermont Cheddar or even Velveeta in place of the Monterey Jack or Mozzerella.

I followed the recipe but went along with previous users' suggestions and added worscenstershire sauce and mustard powder.  I used the cheeses I had on hand.  I added more cheese than the recipe called for and still it wasn't cheesy enough.  This came out more like a macaroni casserol than a mac and cheese.  I won't be making this recipe again.

I am extremely disappointed at having wasted all my time (and my cheese!) making this recipe... and I am really puzzled by all the rave reviews. The baking instructions are way off- this was a congealed mess after just 30 minutes of in the oven (never mind the 45 mins the recipe calls for).  I followed all the directions and had a delicious, creamy cheese sauce (I had added 1/2 tsp of ground mustard & onion powder).  I should have just mixed the sauce and the pasta and ate it like that, as the oven baked out ALL the flavor and texture.

This is a great start, but I like some heat in all of my food. Here are my modifications: Boil pasta for 5 minutes only. Do not shock with cold water. Use 12oz. macaroni rather than 8oz. Use a full teaspoon each of cayenne and salt rather than a pinch. Add one teaspoon of mustard seed. Add a tablespoon of worcestershire sauce to the milk before reducing. Use equal parts of shredded extra sharp cheddar, monterey jack, and a hot pepper cheese (habanero is perfect), small cubes or shredded. Bake for 25 minutes only, no need to bake further. Delicious!

I usually have good luck selecting recipes to try, but this one barely gets one star! It may have been something I did, but I read another entry that shared my same complaints...the smell while cooking, blandness, and consistancy where something I have never tasted with mac n' cheese. I ended up making the old tried and true.

I omitted the ham and hot spices and this was very bland.  Knowing I would omit the ham, I used very flavorful cheeses but it was still tasteless.  I made this for 12 kids and none liked it.  Until my son is older and can tolerate the hot spice and eats ham, I won't remake this.

Very nice! I personally prefer it without the ham and I added parmesan which tasted VERY NICE. But if you're going to try it with  parmesan, don't use too much. I personally used a lot, but it does tend to overpower the flavours of the other cheeses though.

My partner loved this recipe, as did I, and we're bound to cook it again.

This was good and hearty but I prefer my macaroni and cheese to have more seasoning. I liked it overall and my 16 month old loved it! But I had to salt mine quite a bit to be pleased with it. Sure it does take a bit of effort and time to make this but even with it needing a bit more salt it is still worthwhile to make. I will be making it again since my toddler loved it so much. It makes so much I had leftovers enough to fill more than 2 meals for 2 adults and a toddler. 

It does have a good homemade hearty taste, much better than boxed stuff.

Excellent....used a different shaped pasta, mozzarella,cheddar, and hot pepperjack cheeses, and added dry mustard to the cheese sauce. Creamy and delicious. Also added buttered bread crumbs to the top. Will make again!

We really enjoyed this meal. I did change it up a bit... I used wheat pasta, wheat flour, non-fat milk, and turkey ham. I sauteed the turk/ham in garlic and sweet onions to liven up the taste. I also did not have any cayenne pepper so I used crushed red peppers. Overall, it was fabulous.

Very cheesy and saucy! If you wanted to add one or two more ounces of pasta to this recipe,it would still work. And just enough kick to make it interesting! Delic...

This recipe was pretty good but not the best I've tasted. I didn't care for the texture and prefer mac and cheese to be more creamy.

The only reason I rated it 4 and not 5 stars is I thought it was a bit lackign in "cheesy" flavor; I followed the recipe generally adding dry mustard and worchesterchire as suggested in a review and bread crumbs & cheese on top and broiling it at the end. Next time, I'll add a larger proportion of sharp cheddar for my personal taste but it was definitely a keeper. It needs the topping, though as a foil for the mushiness of the casserole.

For the amonut of cheese sauce this makes I believe you need at least 12 ounces of pasta--maybe even the 16 ounces would work.  Makes a large dish thats for certain.  I don't like the stringyness that mozzarella tends to give cheese sauce so I used pepper Jack and cheddar.  The pepper jack really gave it a great flavor.  The ritz crackers on top, suggested in a previous review was a great addition.  Reheats nicely, and tastes good, and creamy!  Thanks for the great way to use my leftover ham.

I don't make this A LOT, b/c it is a high calorie dish. But it is just like the kind of mac&cheese that I grew up with (my mom didn't make the box kind) SO this is what I call a "comfort food" :). We always use hot dogs not ham just our family preference.  I recently made this for another family that we were staying with, and she only had colby/jack cheese. It turned out great even with just one kind of cheese. Both families loved it.  Make sure you follow the directions and make the roux right. Keep in mind that it does make a lot, but it reheats wonderfully as leftovers, and even freezes/reheats well if you like to make meals in advance.

Made this on a lazy Sunday afternoon and it was a hit with my husband!  He is a Mac&Cheese addict/self proclaimed expert and he loved it so much he is willing to make it next time. I made a topping of about a cup or so of crushed Ritz crackers and about 2-3 tsps. Parmesan cheese and a handful of grated cheddar and added it in the last 30 minutes.  The Ritz crackers got very buttery and crunchy.  It was definately a keeper!

This was really good.  The best I've tried.  It turned out creamy and yummy and my daughter made me set some aside for her lunch tomorrow.  The only thing I did different was to add a little chopped onion.  What a terrific way to use up left-over ham.  I also liked that it had 3 different kinds of cheese.

This recipe is awesome. It's my first time making mac and cheese in years and it was delicious! Instead of the cheeses mentioned, I just asked the delicatessen for cheese ends (that's what my mom has always done for hers because they're cheap and you get a variety) and it came out great! I'm sure the other cheeses together would be lovely though.

My husband loved this. Wants me to make it again! I took a few of the reviewers recommendations and used a quart of half & half, worcestershire and mustard.  On top I added garlic & herb bread crumbs and sprinkled with smoked paprika.  Thanks Allie for a great recipe for me to play with.  It was my first time making my new husband's favorite dish!

This was pretty good. It is definitely different than "the blue box" - to be expected from homemade. Other than burning the bottom of my pot (my fault - roux sauce got away from me), it wasn't bad. Not as flavorful as I was hoping so if I make it again, I'll increase the spices.

Made this for Thanksgiving and I got soooo many compliments.  It was absolutely delicious. I did alter the recipe just a lil bit.  I used 8 oz of cheese rather than 5oz.  I used 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper rather than a pinch and I skipped the paprika.  I will absolutely by making this again.

My two very NON-picky kids wouldn't touch it.  I took a bite and it was spongy and not nearly cheesy enough.  I followed the recipe exactly except I sprinkled extra cheese on top (that was the best part)  It's just not for us at all!

Thia recipe was fantastic and everyone who tried it, loved it.  I also added the mustard and bread crumbs etc.  It was delicious.  The reason it gets a 4 instead of 5 rating is because it definitely takes about 45 mintues to prepare and only needs about 25 minutes to cook and 3 mintues to broil and make the breadcrumbs crispy.

This was a delicious mac and cheese.  I used shells. I didn't add the ham, and I used the cheeses I had on hand, cheddar, colby and montery jack, and muenster and it turned out great.  I think it's really in the cheese sauce.  I thought a quart of milk was a bit much and I was half a cup short, but it turned out great.  I cooked it for 30 minutes and it was perfect for us.

When I asked my boyfriend what his favorite food was, his answer was "mac and cheese" - I, who has never encountered anything but the blue box variety, was astonished. My reaction when he told me his mom made it from SCRATCH was "HuH? How does she make the cheese powder!??!" Nevertheless I decided to make his favorite dish and followed this recipe exactly. WE LOVED IT!!! I'll never settle for the instant stuff ever again! THe only problem I had was with the flour clumping. Next time I will try corn starch instead.

This was awful.  The sauce took forever to make (it took nearly 20 minutes for the liquid to boil) and then when I added the cheese it seemed to deteriorate.  By the time i added the noodles to the mixture it had turned pasty and soupy.  In the end I threw it away as I would have been embarassed to serve it to my family.

Tried it today with different cheese.
What I didn't like was  it was no where as creamy as I expect mac and cheese should be.  I was a bit disappointed.

I thought this was good. I used sausage in place of the ham. I thought it was a bit "chalky" in texture and not as creamy as I would have liked. A good recipe though.

If you would put the ham in with the macaroni and let it boil with it, you would be surprised the flavor the ham gives the macaroni. great recipe. caprice

I made this dish tonight as a side dish.  Though the preparation was a bit involved, it turned out beautiful and was very tasty!  I used sprinkled the top with cheddar cheese and bread crumbs before baking.  My boyfriend LOVED the dish and I'm sure I will be making it again.

Taking others' suggestions, I jazzed it up a little by adding ground mustard, worchestershire sauce, and chopped onion. If I hadn't gotten carried away with the spices it would have been better. Next time, I'll only use the onion. The sauce does thicken upon standing. Very good overall.

MMMM! This was a great recipe!  I decided to try this one because it was described as creamy.  The only thing I did different is I used 1 C buttermilk, 3 C milk, and I didn't have jack cheese so I used more of the mozzarella and cheddar!  Delicious!

Fabulous Mac & Cheese!!  I am a novice cook and this recipe got rave reviews from my family and coworkers.  It is very filling and works well as a main dish.  I think my wife said it best, "Make sure you save that recipe."

this was excellent! I decided to only stir in the cheddar (probably more than was called for) then layer the white cheeses seperatly like a lasagna with the macaroni. I will definatly make this again one day.

This was the BEST macaroni and cheese I've ever made. My daughter who is 5 is a fussy eater and she had second helpings, now if thats not saying how good it is then I don't know. I did omit a couple of ingredients, like cayenne pepper, ham, paprika and added provolone cheese to kick it up a notch otherwise I followed everything to a T. It was so good I couldn't believe I made it. I give this recipe 5 stars, it was that delicious.

I just want to say, this is the "BEST MAC -n- CHEESE Recipie that I ever made and ate.  The only thing I don't do is put the ham in it.  I have now made it many times within the past year and EVERYONE loves it.  Actually, my girlfriend and I are addicted to it.  To vary the cheeses, I change and put in different ones and it always comes out delicious.  I can even eat it cold..... Thanks for the best mac and cheese recipie that I ever tasted..... :)  Chris McGary, Harrisburg, PA

My hubby gobbled this one up! I used all american cheese and it was very creamy!

-also I sprinkled some instant stuffing on top and baked it at 200º for 90 min (shift change from me leaving the house to my hubby getting in)

- also used diced cheese franks vs ham and our 4 yr old was so excited to find them in there- thanks for spicing up the ol Mac n Cheese drone on...

This was so good!!  I added some worchestershire sauce and some dry mustard, and like someone had suggested, I used the grated Kraft 'melt' cheese.  Very good!

Better than KD!
This is the first recipe I have followed from allrecipies.com, and it turned out very well.
I used 7tbsp of flour instead of 10, and 2/3 the milk.  Next time I make this, I'll try the recommendation of others to use sharp cheddar.

Thanks for the great recipe.

This is a great recipe.  Like all other cooks, I made some modifications for our own personal taste - but - the basic recipe is the same.  Perhaps different cheese or two instead of three cheeses and everyone still wanted more.

I used 16 ounces of ham and left out the mozzarella cheese and added a teaspoon of cayenne pepper into the roux. My family loved it.  I will certainly cook this one again.

Good Mac & Cheese recipe. My husband liked it-that's always a good thing. It needs extra salt and pepper and maybe a little onion powder or something. I made mine without the ham. Will make again

I made this tonight for dinner and it was delicious. I did, however, substitute pepperjack cheese for the monterey jack. I had some on hand that I needed to use and I liked the extra spice. Might add a little more next time. Will definately make again!!! (in the near future) I will say, though, that it is not a low fat food. :) I guess it's okay to splurge now and then.

I’m torn. I prepped the recipe just as stated except I baked for less time and added ground mustard and Worcestershire. I’m torn because that was a lot of work for Mac n cheese. I usually cook the macaroni, layer it with shredded cheese and glop butter and eyeball some milk.  It’s in the oven and done in 25 minutes. It’s less creamy that way versus this recipe, but I get a nice crunch. This is a good recipe and may make again, but only if I’m in the mood for cooking.

People think I make the best Mac & cheese thanks to this recipe. I've never put in the ham & usually use a variety of cheeses including sharp cheddar & white cheddar. I broil it for a few minutes at the end to give it a nice crispy brown top crust. Delicious!!

Made it twice to get it right; first time grainy, second perfect! Must take time to make roux. Milk must be hot, but not scalded or dish is ruined. Here is what I did for a large serving: 16 oz shell pasta, 8 tbl butter/flour, 2 qts milk, 16 oz jack/cheddar, 8 oz 5 cheese parmisian moz combo, 4 oz velveeta NO ham, Bake only 20 minutes. Roux must be made per directions, slowly, constant stir and slow add very warm/hot milk. Let thicken and then add cheese. I used Tone's cajun spice mix, 3 tsp, and 1tsp salt. It had a slight bite, but very creamy and delicious.

Ok this was alright. I think I messed something up though. Next time I will leave out the ham and use much less flour. I am not sure if it was my fault or if it was the recipe (probably me though);) . And it wasn't terrible. Was kind of bland though. I will give this an honest try again and report back! Oh and my two year old son loved it!!

Took other reviewers advice, omitted ham, added dry mustard and worcestershire, increased amount of macaroni.  The result was disappointing still - a lot of work and SO bland!  If I decide to try again I'd use stronger cheeses only, like sharp cheddar.  But I will probably look elsewhere for another recipe.

I really wanted to like this recipe.  It was the first "from scratch" mac & cheese I've attempted.  It was a lot of work to get the milk boiled just right, etc, while chasing 2 small children.  But it turned out to taste just like Piccadilly's.  My little boy didn't like it - preferred Kraft from a box.

Definitely baked too long and I think too much milk, since it came out soupy.  We may use more pasta next time and see if that helps with the milk problem.

Okay it looked great when I first took it out of the oven.  The longer it sat, the drier it got.  It was bland.  I made it as a side dish for a recent BBQ and literally threw away almost 1/2 of it.  My daughter didn't finish it. I didn't add the ham.  It definitely needs more tweaking or perhaps use only 3/4 lb. of pasta for it to come out creamier.  I will try it again, adding a sharper cheese.  It might be because the some of the cheese used is very delicate in flavor.

First mac and cheese I've made. I had my doubts when it came out of oven, but it tasted great and was gone immediately at the cookout.

This was a great foundation recipe. However, I omitted the ham and added a tsp of mustard powder and onion powder for taste. Otherwise, I think it may have been too bland.

This macaroni was decent. I followed the recipe nearly exactly - I only cut out the use of ham. It was sort of bland, so next time I'll definitely add some mustard and seasonings to kick it up a notch.

my whole family prefers homemade to kraft when it comes to mac n cheese I love fact that this recipe uses so many different cheeses I omitted the ham but think adding pepperoni might make a nice addition

I'm really surprised to see negative reviews of this recipe--especially for being "bland".  It says that you should add spices "to taste," so, if it's too bland, you didn't follow the directions.  I do add some dry mustard, use 4 oz of cream cheese as part of my 15 oz of cheese.   I also substitute bacon for the ham and top it with a mixture of bread crumbs and butter. What I love about it is the ratio of creamy cheese sauce to pasta--it's really creamy. I always get compliments on this recipe.

I've tried other mac and cheese recipes from site was very disappointed with them.  However, this was exactly the one I was looking for!  It turned out great!  I was thinking one quart of milk was a lot for the amount of pasta, so I just doubled it....turned out wonderful!

I'm a student living in Tibet and just made this recipe for a belated Thanksgiving dinner. It was super easy and so delicious! It turned out exactly as I hoped and there were no leftovers. If I can make this recipe in a foreign country, using a wok, anyone can make it!

This was really good.  I made an absolute mess when boiling the milk mixture and 1/4 of it spilled on the stove/cabinets/floor (lol) but I did save the rest and tried the recipe like that.  Still great! I didn't use the ham or monterey jack cheese, but I did use an Italian blend of cheese in place of the MJ.  Good stuff.  The paprikia makes a great presentation when baked on.

Will definately do this again and again--my family raved about it. Things I did different/changed: I added sauted red pepper, onion and garlic and I did not have cubed cheeses, so I used an 8oz bag of shredded cheedar and about 6oz of an 8oz bag of an Italian cheese blend.

i substituted the ham for broccoli and sprinkled some ground mustard seed on top.  my boyfriend liked it but said it was just a bit too "floury" tasting. perhaps a stronger cheese is in order. the taste of the recommended cheeses was perhaps too subtle.

I could not find our favorite macaroni and cheese recipe, so I had to find a replacement.  This one was excellent.  I would give it about 4 1/2 stars.  I added onions to the butter and sauteed them before I added the flour, and I also added about a cup of sour cream with the cheese at the end.  For those who want it creamier, you could probably add a can of cream of chicken or cream of mushroom as well.  Thanks for the great recipe!  My family loved it.

this was ok. even after adding the worchestershire sauce and dry mustard like others have suggested, it was still a little bit bland.
the sauce wasn't really creamy either, at least not what i would consider creamy.
i left out the ham as well and upped the amount of macaroni, which i might not do next time as i would have preferred more of the cheese sauce on it. i think i'll also try sharp cheddar next time instead of the medium cheddar i had. and maybe add in some peas and mushrooms and more spices as well as maybe some onion. and i'll bake it for less time, 45 minutes was too long.

I made it for thanksgiving it was a hit, everyone loved it. The only change made was I took several of tips from other reviews, I used 7.5 ounces of cheese for each instead of 5, combine half & half & milk, 1 Tsp. of dry mustard and more than a pinch of cayenne and no ham. Great recipe thank's Allie.............

I love cheese and this is one of the cheesiest.  I think next time I might just use abou 16 oz of Sharp Chedder, about 2/3 of the milk and maybe a bit more macaroni then see what I come out with. Thats the fun of cooking: Messing up, trying again and getting full of your mistakes!

It does have a different texture as other reviewers have noted... and I couldn't bring myself to put mozzarella in macaroni. But I made it for a friend, and her kids who had stopped eating macaroni altogether loved it. She asked me for the recipe but decided it was too much work. It's very good but I am still looking for a better, creamier, and perhaps easier to make macaroni. When I don't feel like trying anything new, I will default to this recipe.

I have been making this mac and cheese for about a year now and all I get are rave reviews.  The three cheeses are great together.  I do not add any ham to it

To me the texture wasn't very creamy. But it was cheesy.  If I make it again and will use velvetta in place of one of the cheeses and add more cayenne pepper, because you couldn't tell I had put any in. I would rate it a 3+.  It was a good way to use the left over ham. Before I use the bone for beans.   :o)

used different cheeses (old cheddar and mozzerella) and it turned out really good. A nice recipe to freeze and take for lunch another day.

Tasted great!  Did not add the ham or the paprika.  Did substitute Monteray Jack cheese for one that had habenero peppers in it (we are South Asian and love spicy stuff).  Also let the mac and cheese cool for a bit, topped with bread crumbs and put back in oven for a nice crispy crust.

I love this recipe and I'm not a fan of boxed mac and cheese.  I always use 16 oz. of macaroni, and have never put the ham in it.  I do try to use the sharpest cheese that I can find.

I have made this recipe many times for my family, and it always turns out great.  My husband and son were both fans of "boxed" macaroni and cheese, and were reluctant to try this, but they loved it.  I find myself buying a ham at least once a month now - not so much for the ham dinner as for this recipe, which I make using the left over ham!

I tried this recipe for the first time this weekend and it was hit... my boyfriend said it too 'slimey', but I thought it was just fine... I used mild cheddar as I don't like sharp, but perhaps I'll try it with sharp cheese just to see how I like it... I also omitted the ham... this is a keeper..

This recipe is great!  I left out the ham and cayenne pepper though. I'm sure that any kind of meat would work.  I served kielbasa sausage on the side.

I made this recipe as a side dish last evening to serve to guests.  I was a bit nervous due to the fact that I am not the worlds best cook.  I have to say that it was a big hit & there was not a leftover to be found!  I definately will be making this recipe in the near future.

Huge hit with my family!  Even my husband who normally dislikes homemade mac and cheese enjoyed!  I live in Colorado, and the high altitude really affected the prep time (40 min. for the white sauce to thicken).  It was still worth it.  Next time I think I'll add a can of green chilies for added flavor.  Thanks for a yummy dinner!

I have made this recipe twice.  The first time was for my brother's birthday last year.  Then again (for my brother and me).  This year I'm making it as a side dish to ham for Xmas.  Only suggestion I have is use the sharpest cheddar you can find.  Once I did, and once I didn't and I noticed the difference.  Enjoy this comfort food.

I loved it, but my husband thought it needed to be "more cheesy."  But he's cheesy enough.  I melted some butter and poured it over some cut up pieces of bread and sprinkled that on top.  It made a nice crust.  Totally yummy!

My husband loves this dish and has me make it every week.  I don't like the texture of the mac and cheese though.  I'm not sure what it is- baked milk maybe.  I have tried pepper jack and monterrey jack and my husband prefers the pepper jack.  I also put some hot sauce in the cheese sauce before I mix everything together.

all the adults really enjoyed this recipe -- with no changes.  however, my picky 3yr old didn't like it.  he seems to like powdered cheese to the real deal.  go figure.  i will make this again.  when he is older, he'll like it, too.

This was a pretty good recipe. My son did not care for it too much, although all my coworkers loved it. I made a topping out of crumbled cornflakes, parmesian cheese and melted butter for some extra texture and taste.

This really reminds me of the Macaroni and Cheese my mom use to make from scratch!!  I was very pleased with how it came out.  My husband, who has really only had Kraft Mac & Cheese,  couldn't believe how good homemade could be!

Thanks for sharing this with us!  I would definately make this again!

The final product was good,but not as creamy as i had hoped for.I used Sea Shells instead of elbows,that was the only variation.
