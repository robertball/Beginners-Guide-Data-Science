Kid friendly and a decent "quickie dinner" recipe. Tastes a lot like hamburger helper without those nasty chemicals!

I like this one and have made it a few times with the following changes.  My three recommendations are to double the meat to 1 lb.; cut the cheese down to 6 oz. (that's equal to 8 slices of American cheese singles - add more if you like); and add a tablespoon of dehydrated onion.  The onion is just like you find on fast-food hamburgers and makes it taste just like a cheeseburger!

Don't even bother with this. Not worth the effort. Too salty and too cheesy.

Discovered this one six years ago when I suddenly found myself on bedrest during the pregnancy of my second child...It was about the only palatable thing my husband could make!

Now, all three kids love it.  We eat it because of the nostalgia...   It can be made tastier than the original if you use real cheddar cheese (or a blend), and add a dash of worcestershire to cut the sweetness of the ketchup.  Great one-pan meal when your in a real hurry, and want that Fast Food taste :) NOT for health nuts!

I thought this had too much cheese.  The next day I toned it down with some cream of mushroom soup and milk and then it was much better.

This is a very quick & easy meal that the kids enjoyed quite a bit. With the catsup and mustard it really is like a cheeseburger, what kid doesn't love cheeseburgers?? I had a serving, but added Frank's Red Hot Sauce to mine, and even I loved this recipe :) Great quick dinner!

I thought it was a pretty good recipe that the whole family enjoyed. The only thing I would change about the recipe is to add 2 1/2 cup water. There was a little too much cheese, but the extra water should change that. I will make this recipe again!

My children love the Hamburger Helper version, but I decided to be a good mom & try the "scratch" version.  Sorry, but it was a flop.

just as the others, i made a few changes to this and it was pretty good.  i used tomato sauce instead of ketchup and added some seasoning to the ground beef.  also, i cooked the noodles separately and used less cheese.

I figured a recipe like this existed here. I got this recipe from my sister-in-law, and it's pretty much this exact same recipe, with just a minor change. Just buy a regular box of 'Kraft Dinner', use the noodles from that, use the cheese from that. Cook the beef, and cook the noodles seperately. Add the noodles and beef, and then add your ketchup, mustard, and packet of kraft dinner cheese. I also typically add about two teaspoons of onion powder. With that small change, I love this meal.

I thought the recipe was good, but it wasn't my favorite.  I would probably try it again.  But Hamburger Helper would be faster.

This recipe was really good in flavor, but the cheese was a little sticky.  I may add some milk next time at the end to loosen it up a bit.  -Allison

Yuck!  Think queso dip with macaroni in it.  Way too much Velveeta!  My 4 yr old loved it, but nobody else did.  It was fast and easy, but tasted aweful.

We make this now and then when my husband requests it.  Its quick and easy and pretty darn  tasty, too.
I have made the following tweaks:
Increase the yellow mustard to 1 tablespoon;  Add 1 tablespoon of pickle relish, plus 2 teaspoons of dried onion flakes to the water.  Instead of using  chunks of Velveeta, I just turn the heat off once it's  done and place 5 American singles right on top until melted, then stir well.  
The added ingredients make it really resemble the taste of a cheeseburger.  My husband is crazy about this simple - but flavorful - dish!

I added a can of Rotel Diced Tomatoes with Green Chiles to give it an extra zip.  I would put less cheese also...maybe only 1/2 pound or less.  It was good though.

I didn't find this tasty at all.  My 15 month old and 3 year old refused to eat it, and they will eat about anything!  It was VERY salty and tasted like hamburger helper gone bad.  I would not recomend using your time on this.

This was a really good, quick dish that my family really liked. I took the advise of others and used 1lb of meat and 1/2 the amount of cheese. It was plenty cheesy!  I also added 1/2 teaspoon of onion powder.  It was good for a change, not something I would want every week but its a keeper.

I like the flavor except the amount of cheese. I can barely taste the beef, so I would cut the 12 oz down to about 6 or even less. I was really cheesy! Overall quick, and easy.

This was very easy to prepare and smelled excellent. 12 ounces of cheese is a lot. The only thing I could taste was salty cheese. It would be best to cut back on the amount of cheese you use.

Its easy to make and has a better flavor than the box variety.  My kids and my husband love it.  I love it too.

It was good, but I would add a 1/4 C of Ketchup instead of the 1/2 C and maybe add the optional mustard.

This recipe took 1 hr to make, not a fast one like I had hoped but my 5 yr old gobbled it up.
