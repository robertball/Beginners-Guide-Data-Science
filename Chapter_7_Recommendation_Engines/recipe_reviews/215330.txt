I actually used frozen blackberries from last summer (I'm trying to work my way through my deep freeze.....) and Stacy's organic nonfat vanilla yogurt. I used honey instead of sugar. I didn't have an ice pop mold but I did have dixie cups and popsicle sticks so I used those. Pretty good. I'll increase the blackberries just a little next time.

Delicious and easy to prepare!  I couldn't find any ice pop molds at WalMart or Target (??) so I just made straight up ice cream.  I didn't fully incorporate the blackberry puree because I wanted the contrast between the white frozen yogurt and dark fruit.  I will definitely try this again, maybe with raspberries and some dark chocolate chips :)

Mmmmm... made them for our friends' little kids to keep them occupied, but everybody ended up having some and they were universally loved!

I double strained the seeds and used 6 oz blackberries and 6 oz raspberries.  I also used raspberry frozen yogurt, as that is what was on hand.  The flavor was great!  I had a problem with the pops not sticking to the molds.  Thanks for the easy, tasty and healthy recipe, platypusofdeath!
