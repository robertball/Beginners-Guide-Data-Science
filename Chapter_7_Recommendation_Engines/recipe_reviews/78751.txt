EXCELLENT recipe!  Tom & Jerrys are a family tradition so this year I wanted to try and make it instead of buy it.  We add half brandy and half rum with ours and it is very good.

As a Wisconsin native, warm winter drinks are a must. We have a local bakery that makes their own mix, they have been the mix of choice. I made this recipe for the first time today, and it is fantastic! Only note I'll make is that the directions mention adding rum, but the ingredients don't list any rum. I make my Tom & Jerry with 1/2 to 1 ounce each brandy and rum, about 2 1/2 tablespoons mix and about one cup of near boiling water. Mmmmmm. Sure to warn you up from the inside out!

This exactly the quintessential Tom n Jerry Batter of my childhood and young adulthood! I grew in S.D.where there were family owned grocers used to sell their own version of this delicious Holiday beverage mix. So warm and spicy and comforting on cold Winter nights. Share this recipe with your Loved Ones this year and keep the Tradition going!

My dad made homemade Tom & Jerry mix every Christmas.  Sorry dad, but this outshines your mix.  It is delicious.  I would omit the Cloves and Mace as I am not a fan of those spices.  If anything, I would add some cinnamon.

Tom and Jerry's have always been a winter treat since I was a young girl (of course back then it was always served sans liquor). My husband and I decided to try this recipe and we will never go back to store-bought again! It just doesn't compare to this. We had couldn't find the ground mace at the store we were at, so we grounded our own from whole nutmeg. Delicious!

This could be a 5 star rated drink mix, but, by increasing the spice from 1/4 teaspoon to 1/2 teaspoon each makes all the difference and brings it too a 5 star recipe.

The mix is great! The alcohol is a shame, recipe for this (20) adults 1c each dark rum, lite rum, brandy and lemon hart 151rum.  Add to empty booze bottle, Shake and pour 1.5 oz per 8oz drink.

I made this recipe exactly as given and it was excellent. The only thing I changed was that I used brandy and more like 2-3 tbsp of mix for added thickness and flavor. The perfect warmer upper in the chilly days of winter.
