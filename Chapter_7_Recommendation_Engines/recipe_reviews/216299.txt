This was a yummy and hearty stew.  Few changes: 1. instead of French Onion Soup I used onion soup mix, 2 c. water, & 1 can of cream of chicken soup; 2. Carrots instead of parsnips.; 3. Calabaza squash instead of Butternut.  (Just cause I had it on hand). It was a little greasy, but that comes with pork! I would also add the squash and apples towards the end so they aren't so mushy!  I thought the apples might be weird with this, but they were a nice addition, just need to be added later!

I'm giving this a provisional 5 stars.  It tasted wonderful made as per the recipe.  I did add double the thyme and some salt and pepper.  I will agree that the apples melted away into the sauce, but that's what made it taste so delicious.  Next time I will peel the apples, though, just for appearance sake.  Then it will be a true 5 stars.  Try this, you won't be disappointed.

I adjusted just a few things - trimmed fat off pork, added a 1/2 can of beef broth, ground pepper to taste and some Lawry's seasoned salt.  I didn't think just Thyme would be enough flavor for me. 3 stars for the apples. My husband and I were both gone all day so it did cook the full 8 hrs.  Flavors were decent/good if not slightly bland, liked the pork (a BIT dry, so could have probably stopped cooking in 7 hrs), squash and parsnips.  But the apples were complete mush.  I didn't stir them in with the rest of the stew, either - I had them on top worried they'd get to mushy in the liquid to early.  The texture was too off for me to eat them, even though the flavor wasn't bad.  so ate around them and wasted 3 perfectly good apples. Will make again, but will either leave the apples out all together and serve along side or wait to put them in for just the last part of cooking.

Not a hit with my family, perhaps I cooked it to long.

It was OK. Would I make again? No. It was bland, and although the ingredients sounded like they would blend well, it just didn't personally work for me. I would have enjoyed it more if I made everything separate.

The finished product is relentlessly boring.  I did like what the apples did in the stew, but the whole thing was just too bland.  It might not be bad if you experiment with spices in it.

I've made this twice now and it's definitely now a staple in my family.  This isn't an explosion of flavor, just warm, homey, and comforting and gets better as the flavors meld on the second and third day.  The apples do disintegrate, but makes for a thicker texture in the sauce.  

I do recommend cutting the pork into slightly smaller pieces and cutting the vegetables into 1" cubes, not 2" and the parsnip a bit under 1".  You might feel the need for a pinch of salt to individual servings the first night, but shouldn't need it the second or third.  My second time making this I substituted a potato for one of the apples and added some whole mustard seed and cumin for a bit of earthiness.

This is very good! Used all beef broth. I didn't have parsnip so I used rutabega. I loved it...not a kid pleaser though.

I loved it. It was simple and easy to make. I didn't have parsnips, but it didn't matter.  The squash & apple combination gave it a great flavor.
