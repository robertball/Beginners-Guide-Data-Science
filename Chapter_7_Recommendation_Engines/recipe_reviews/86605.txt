this soup was just delicious. I made some changes I omitted the leeks and also added a can of navy beans to make it a thicker soup. I chopped up grilled andouille sausage and added a lil thickening of flour and water to make it thick. The soup was fantastic. I will definetly make again.

Excellent flavour and very quick to prepare. Next time I think I'll reserve half of the black beans and add them to the soup whole just to add a little more texture to the soup. My husband (a very obviously NON-vegetarian) thought there should have been meat in it but I don't think it needed it.

My Sweetheart has been going more and more vegetarian on me so I tried this recipe. I hate to make changes but it really was a tiny one. I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. She loves the beans so this worked out perfectly. I like a little more meat or chicken or fish with my meals so I add in some sauteed shrimp to my bowl right before serving. Three little words: Won-der-ful!

I actually LOST the recipe after I bought the supplies and before I made the soup so I sort of guessed at what I was supposed to do when and totally wound up skipping the "blend" part. For the chicken broth I used a ramen noodle seasoning packet (I'm trying to be more thrifty). I added a ton of hot pepper and it wound up being too hot so to balance and give a little more flavor I added a little brown sugar. It was DELICIOUS!

Even better than I expected. I did change a little though. I did not add the corn until the end because I did not want it chopped and I used 1/2 can beans in the blender and another 1/2 at the end so it would be whole. I topped it with a dollop of sour cream and fresh chopped cilantro and chives. My husband said his only complaint was I didn't give him enough.

I had high hopes for this soup but it just fell flat for me. I followed the recipe but reversed the steps so I would only need to use 1 pot (sauteed onions/garlic first the added the broth et al to boil reserving 1/2 of the beans/corn/peppers until after I immersion blended the soup). It just had very little flavor other than HOT (not too hot just hot). I'm not sure what makes this "cajun" but I think I would have preferred it w/a cajun spice blend. THANKS for the recipe JWHICKER!

This was very easy to make and the ingredients are all things I have on hand regularly (except the leek which I left out.) With that said I'm still very surprised at the GREAT reviews this soup has. It's thin and almost more broth than anything. We like a thick soup so this one is kind of boring. I only blended half of the black beans as one review suggested. I added noodles. It helped some but I don't think this will be added to my family's favorite soups.

I really wanted to like this. I thought it was just ok. I only did the second puree using my immersion blender. If I made it again I would use more black beans and I would add the corn after the puree. The taste of "corn skins" is not pleasant. Also I preferred this with some cheese and sour cream.

Delicious even though I didn't do all the blending steps since I lack a blender.

I used this as a base for a "clean out the fridge/freezer" soup. I used onion instead of the leek added chicken used a frozen blend of corn black beans and peppers and left out the tomatoes. It seemed like it was missing something so I added a teaspoon of creole seasoning. It turned out great!

AWESOME SOUP! I made only a few changes. I substituted water and vegetable Better Than Boullion for the chicken stock to make it vegetarian and left out the garlic salt. I used fresh garlic and prefer low-salt foods. Also I added all the ingredients and cooked through before blending so I only had to blend it once. Less messy. Seriously one of the best soups I've tried in awhile. I'll definitely be making it again.

Very good soup but I think it needs more in the spice department. Better to use an excellent cajun spice blend for this recipe. I also didn't bother blending it at any point and I think it turned out just fine. Thanks for sharing!

Tried as is it was okay in the summer this soup would be made with fresh vegetables and the addition of pork chicken or beef makes the soup. I wonder why anyone cooks from can goods. If you don't have a freezer use frozen veggies from the store or cook your own dried beans try to avoid can food....too much salt and additives. I'm from Houma that's south of New Orleans I know my Cajun food and cook it almost every day. Shrimp stock or fish stock works great too.

This was easy and very good. I had to substitute vegetable broth instead of chicken due to diet restrictions but this was delicious. I like a smooth broth so I put everything in the blender exept the corn and black beans. Picky eaters would never know there was onion bell peppers and tomoates in the soup this way.
