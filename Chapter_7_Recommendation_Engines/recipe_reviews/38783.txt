Gorgeous muffins!  Tender, not too sweet, even with sweetened flaked coconut.  I subbed coconut oil for the olive oil.  Coconut oil is solid at room temp, so I just nuked it for about 20 seconds.  It added just the right amount of extra coconut flavor.  I love the orange zest and the little crunch from the almonds and chew from the coconut.  I topped the muffins with sliced almonds and then flaked coconut about half-way through baking time so it wouldn't get too brown.

These were AMAZING.. but with a few alterations. I know this is technically a different recipe then, but i always enjoy pointers in the review section. First, i added 1 cup coconut milk and no orange juice, and substituted lemon zest for orange. Make sure to add the sugar to the milk mixture so that it is fully mixed through. Also, with the advice of another review, i added 1/2 tsp cardamom and a generous dash of ginger. I also did a teaspoon of coconut extract, 1/2 tsp of almond extract and a dash of vanilla. DO toast the coconut and almonds, it makes all the difference. And, for my healthier preferences, i substituted one cup of whole wheat pastry flour for one cup of the all purpose flour and 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce for the olive oil... i felt the olive oil made the texture extremely heavy. Mix to BARELY moist, and these are absolutely delectable. The best part is that they are Vegan-friendly for my friends.

This recipe has potential but needs help.  First, double the salt and the vanilla.  Then add 1/2t. cardamom and 1T fresh minced ginger to the mix.  Finally make sure you toast the almonds and the coconut.  This is just plain essential.

Tasty and moist but needs either some spices or coconut extract for a more intense coconut flavor.

Not that great. I thought the flavors sounded interesting, but it ended up tasting kinda dried out. Should there be an egg or something in the batter?

Great tasting muffins that are simple to make! I baked them in a *mini* muffin pan, and ended up with 24. Will definitely make these again. I used the sweetened baker's coconut--which I didn't bother toasting. Turned out fine, but I'll try toasting the next time around to see if it makes much of a difference or not. Didn't bother to toast the almonds either... Also used nonaluminum baking powder (Rumford's), and extra LIGHT virgin olive oil. The muffins don't have a "complex" flavor, but were well received by the family, nonetheless. (Including my children!) :o)

Loved these!  My kids and I enjoyed making them this morning too.  We used sweetened coconut milk instead, substituted apple sauce for the oil and nixed the orange zest.  They were very easy.  We will be making them again!  However, next time we will double the recipe, lol 12 muffins didn't last very long in my house:)

I loved these muffins!!!  However, I did change the recipe so that I loved them even more the next time.  Less orange zest or omit altogether and added a bit more coconut extract...DELISH!

To improve the flavor, I used more coconut milk (instead of orange juice),more shredded coconut and put an almond on the top of each muffin.

I used fresh coconut instead of the packaged (shredded) kind, as well as adding fresh ginger and doubling the salt and vanilla as another reviewer had recommended.  These came out moist and delicious! The fresh coconut required cooking them a bit longer (about 5 minutes) but that also might just have been my oven.  Just test with a toothpick to make sure they are properly done.

Tasty! I didn't have olive oil so I just used canola oil.  Other than that, I followed the recipe and they turned out moist and flavorful!

I thought this would b4e a good way to use up some extra coconut milk from another recipe. but, I was wrong.  The taste was nice, but they were very thick and not muffin or cake like at all. Although, they gave me an idea....next time I have leftover cocnut milk I'll  make pancakes substuting the "milk" for "coconut milk" and add some fresh shredded coconut! Maybe top with some chopped mango soaked in cuantro!

This is a wonderful recipe, but a bit sweet for my taste.  I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup and substitute almond extract for vanilla.  I have used this recipe as a starting point for many different vegan muffins.  Thanks so much!

These were quite tasty; I followed the advice of other reviewers and made some alterations.  I used lemon zest instead of orange, and only coconut milk.  I also added coconut extract in addition to the vanilla, and substituted whole wheat flour for the all-purpose.  I also used Splenda rather than sugar, and unsweetened applesauce rather than olive oil.  I managed to lower the calories per muffin to jusst over 100, which is really great.  Lemon and coconut flavours were great with the toasted almonds!!!

These muffins are good. I added ginger as someone suggested and drizzled melted butter & brown sugar on them topped with an almond slice. Will be making them again soon.

really delicious muffins.  the only problem was that i made them a little too big (only 10), so that when i pulled them (gently) from the pan, the tops came off. next time i'll make them smaller so i come out with 12 and they are easier to remove.

I thought these were pretty good!  I substitubed lemon juice and lemon zest for the orange juice and orange zest.  I also used chopped pecans instead of the almonds and canola oil instead of the olive oil.  Mine needed an extra 5 minutes to cook but came out moist, tender and flavorful.  Next time, I might add a spice or two like some of the other reviewers, but really, I thought they were just fine as is.  The coconut milk I used is the thick kind that comes in a can.  I'm wondering if some of the reviewers who thought these didn't have enough coconut flavor used the kind that comes box and is meant to be a beverage.  

I was looking for a good vegan breakfast bread to take to an event where no one else is vegan.  I'll definitely be taking these muffins!

Wonderfull taste, I didn't have coconut milk, so put shreded coconut in hot boiling water, they came a little "liquid" before baking, but then they were fine. And of course, my extra-virgin olive oil (i'm from italy) added some flavor.

I opted to make the mini muffins, it made 28 mini muffins. I baked at the same temp for 13 minutes. 
Used sweetened coconut, because I did not realize I was out of unsweetened.  It worked out just fine!  Not too sweet at all.  Don't forget to toast the almonds and coconut.  I reserved a little bit to top the muffins before putting in the oven.
Really nice orange zest and orange juice flavor.  Fresh squeezed orange juice from the orange used for zest.  Made for a birthday treat to my mother-in-law.  Wait until I tell her they're vegan, she will freak out.  :)

This was a great base recipe, but a made a few changes. I did not use orange rind. I used white whole wheat flour. Substituted sugar with Sugar in the Raw. Pan toasted sliced almonds in coconut oil. Used 3/4 cup blueberry applesauce instead of oil. Added 1/2 tsp more vanilla.  Fresh blueberries would have been a great touch.

Yummy! Denser than the usual muffin but great. Few changes to make it healthier. I subbed oil w apple sauce,  orange juice with maple syrup, used half whole wheat flour instead of all white, added half cup raisins, omit entirely  sugars as maple syrup is enuf, omit the orange zest, replaced almonds w pecans and topped with coconut & chopped pecans. I will mak again for sure!

Oh my gosh, these are SO good!  At first I thought it was odd that the recipe didn't call for any eggs, but I didn't miss them in the finished product.  I did make a few changes: I didn't have orange juice, so I used extra coconut milk, as some other reviewers suggested.  I left out the orange zest since I didn't have that either, and I used some mashed fresh mango instead of most of the oil.  (I can't really taste the mango in the finished product, but at least I know the muffins are healthier!)  I made sure to toast both the almonds and grated coconut, and I also used about 3/4 cup almond flour and a few Tbsp. ground flax seed in place of some of the all-purpose flour.  These are some of the best muffins I've ever had - the recipe is a definite keeper!

This is a good muffin recipe.  The flavor is a little more subtle than other muffins but they are very good in the morning.  Because I didn't have extra light olive oil, I substituted canola and they came out great.
