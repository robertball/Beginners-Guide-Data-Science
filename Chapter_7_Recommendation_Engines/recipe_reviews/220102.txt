I cut the recipe in half and cooked it in the oven at 350 for 20 minutes.  I didn't marinate it, I just threw all the ingredients in the casserole dish (I lessened the wine a little for this reason).  Next time I will add tomatoes and green onions.  This is a great base recipe and it's easy to throw together with ingredients you have on hand.  It can be used on any fish, not just Mahi Mahi, even shrimp.  I also did not find it bland as other people did.   Thanks for the recipe.

Great marinade for mahi-mahi.  I used chardonnay and it worked just fine.  For the "not enough flavor" comment, you want a subtle marinade for a lighter fish like mahi-mahi.  Most fish marinades beat you over the head with the flavors, whereas this one delicately compliments the fish nicely.  A nice caper butter can help for those needing more kick.

This was a GREAT marinade for the Mahi Mahi. It only took a few minutes to put together and even my VERY picky 4 and 2 yr. olds liked it. This will be a staple recipe for us now.

Extremely flavorful!! My first time cooking Mahi Mahi and it will not be my last. This had to be the best gourmet dish I have ever made. My 24 year old daughter said how she could taste the garlic and it was not overpowering. I did cook the fish in a skillet with olive oil and the fish had an awesome caramelization on both sides. I served it with fresh green beans that were boiled for about 5 minutes. 4 tbsp. butter in skillet and saute pecans. Add green beans and 4 tsp. zest of lemon and some fresh italian parsley. It was awesome!!  You will definitely not be disappointed with this recipe and it doesn't take a lot of time either. Bon Appetit.

VERY quick, easy, and delicious! I cooked this in a pan, on medium heat, with two tablespoons of sesame oil. (I kept all other ingredients the same.) The fish caramelized beautifully on both sides and the flavor was fantastic.  Only substitution I recommend: FRESH-ground black pepper (12 turns directly into the marinade from a pepper mill). I will be making this again and again -- one of the best fish dishes I've ever had.

This turned out very well with me using a sweet white wine since that is all I had. I sprinkled each filet with salt and pepper instead of measuring it out, and I baked it in the oven with the marinade --about 20 minutes at 400. The fish had a very nice flavor.

Adding this to my recipe book...it’s quick, easy, healthy, and moist with a wonderfully light flavor! I baked the dish in the marinade at 350 degrees for 20 minutes (10 minutes each side). And I served it along side steamed asparagus with hollandaise sauce and steamed cauliflower. My family loved it!

Fish was very moist. Just needed a little something extra (reason for 4 stars). Next time, adding some lemon pepper seasoning.

This marinade gave a really nice flavor to the mahi mahi. I served it with a mango salsa and it tasted even better.

There is not overwhelming the flavor of the fish and there is not adding any flavor to the fish. This recipe fell into the latter category. It was just too bland. You could kind of taste the lemon. 

I would not make again.

Grilled a full side of mahi-mahi on the grill, and it came out perfect!! I added a lilikoi in the marinade and grilled it topped with slices of lilikoi and lemon and glazed it with lemon juice as it was grilling. It came out moist and flavorful. Simple and fresh recipe!

I only rated two stars, because maybe I need to marinate it longer or something.  Because it came out dry.  But, I will try again. Thanks

This was a great recipe. A nice light and tasteful marinade for fish. I did not use lemon juice. Since I was using fresh garlic I used the lemon zest of a large lemon and it turned out fantastic. I also added some grape tomatoes and baked it in the oven.

I'm giving this a four because all of my kids ate it!  They like bland food, so this was great for them.  My husband and I would give it a 3.  We couldn't grill because of the weather, so I cooked it on the stove.  I also used moscato because we didn't have white Zinfandel.  Good for a quick meal, but nothing spectacular.

This was tasty and easy. I served it with some spicy, fresh pico and avocado to give it a bit more flavor. Overall, it was good and I'll make it again, but it won't be a weekly favorite.

Quick and easy, but I didn't have lemon juice and substituted Lemon Pepper.  I also added about a teaspoon of olive oil to the marinade.  The mahi turned out perfect. Yum!
