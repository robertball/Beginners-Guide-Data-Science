I have made this sauce a dozen times.  The procedures MUST be followed exactly.  Add the ingredients in the wrong order, and it will not be as good or be grainy.  Before you begin adding the milk, it should look like puffed pastry dough. Then slowly add the milk making sure to whisk well to make it smooth and creamy. It will almost become a dough before you've added enough milk to turn it to a sauce. Keep whisking and adding milk.  I use 1/2 cup of Heavy Cream and Real Shredded Parmesan.  When it's in it's "batter" form, that's where you will whisk it smooth.

it's a roux with milk and garlic added. Too grainy due to the amount of flour to sauce ratio.

Well, the kids gobbled it up and asked for more, so that's a big win for Mom!  Also, it was very easy and quick to throw together--I had all the ingredients on-hand, added some chicken and carrots and voilá!  Thanks for a good dinner in a pinch!

delicious! although you definitely have to add the milk slowly or the roux will seize up on you! I added extra garlic & some garlic salt! also added fresh Parmesano regiano because I had a block on hand :) and some extra milk because mine got very thick very fast, overall very good!

Please be sure to add the flower slowly as directed! It will seize up if you don't. Add more garlic than the recipe calls for, as well as more milk. The garlic for extra flavor, and the milk to stop it from getting super thick. Overall great recipe that is fast and easy! Winner in my book!

Simple, quick and easily made with on hand ingredients, this works well for a quick supper.  For our tastes, I would have preferred a little more garlic and freshly grated parmesan cheese, so I would increase the amounts in the future.

My boyfriend and I love this sauce. I took out chicken and he asked if we had alfredo sauce, of course, we didn't. I figured I'd look up a simple recipe that doesn't use heavy cream and BAM! This was perfect! I added salt and pepper to taste and put a bit more cheese in it after the sauce was finished. Don't add anything while it's still watery, it WILL thicken! Delicious!

I wanted to make an easy alfredo since I had never made one before, but realized halfway through that I only had 1 cup of milk. I decided to be resourceful and added about a half cup of ranch dressing. Made it thick just how I like it, and added a bit of ranch flavor. Delicious!

We enjoyed this simple sauce served over tri-colored gnocchi and 'Southwestern Corned Beef Quesadillas!' from AR.  I made the sauce up in the morning, as directed.  After cooling it and refrigerating for the afternoon, it thickened, as I knew it would.  I just reheated on low and added additional milk, slowly, until it had the consistency I was looking for.  A really nice recipe that I will be using again.

This was bland and basically gravy flavored with garlic and a hint of cheese.  I will never make this again and wouldn't suggest this recipe.

This was absolutely horrible! I would never make it again. I made it exactly as the directions stated so there were no modifications.  Read the previous reviews before making- they are helpful to know consistency wise if you're making the sauce correctly. The sauce was not creamy enough in texture for our family. The kids didn't like it either. We'll be sticking with our Olive Garden knockoff recipe. The only reason I tried something new is because I didn't have heavy cream. Save yourself the heartbreak--- don't try this sauce!

This was awful. Not in a "Not crazy about the taste" way, but in a "throw it out and make something else" way. Gritty slop is how I would describe it. Save your time and move on to another alfredo recipe.

This Creamy Alfredo Sauce is absolutely delicious!  We added cooked shrimp to the sauce and ladled it over angel hair pasta.  Really yummy and very easy.

It took too long to thicken.  I'll give it another chance in the future.  Hopefully it was user error!  It was very tasty.

Pretty good considering it's without the heavy cream.  I used Kerrygold butter, a heaping 1/4 tsp of oregano, rosemary, basil, and marjoram (I didn't have Italian seasoning), 1% milk, and I accidentally went a little heavy on the salt but it still turned out great!  Make sure you heat the milk addition slowly so you don't scorch it.

I made this exactly to the recipe— no changes needed and it was so good! Quick and easy! Made with 2% milk, fresh cracked pepper and salt mill. Let flour/butter mixture bubble up for a minute or so then add next ingredients! Pour milk it as you stir—very important so you don’t get lumps!  My kids and hubby loved it! We had it with little shrimp, but can’t wait to have it with grilled chicken! It was that good! Just follow the recipe as stated and it will work!

This cook got two thumbs up from her picky grandkids who are 8,10, and 12-year old Alfredo critics. I used only 1 teaspoon of Italian seasoning, and added 2-3 tablespoons of cream cheese at the end to compensate for my low fat milk. Added cubed poached chicken breast and shell pasta.

This turned out very well. I added an extra TBsp parmesan cheese, used minced garlic and a 1/4 tsp garlic powder. I also added 1/2 tsp ground sage. I did not use Italian seasonings. I served it with chicken and butternut squash "noodles". I will make it again. I love that it doesn't use heavy cream, which I rarely have. My husband loved it!

Didn't use any Italian seasoning, and I had no cloves of garlic available. However, if you sauté garlic powder like they suggest for the cloves and use a half teaspoon of powder per clove, and a pinch of onion powder too, it really boosts the flavor. (I am a big fan of garlicy food though). Also using the powders instead of real garlic allows for the recipe to be followed in any order. I usually either sauté the powder or just dump everything in at once. Just DON'T STOP STIRRING!

Super simple to make. Adding a dash of nutmeg at the end makes it perfect! I also used garlic salt and omitted the salt and fresh garlic. Yum!

I doubled the amount of butter and parmesan cheese. I also added sauteed spinach and mushrooms and put it on small shells. Sooooo good and so simple to make. Love this and HIGHLY recommend!

Very creamy and delicious. I usually let it sit for a few minutes instead of stirring and it still thickens up nicely

Okay so here's the thing.... make SURE you have all of your ingredients measured out BEFORE you start cooking anything. (Unless you have someone to help you). The first time I made this, I had to restart the sauce three times because everything burned immediately, and I was cooking on the lowest setting on my stove. The last time I made it, I had everything measured ahead of time, and it ended up just fine. If putting this sauce on top of noodles, I highly highly suggest adding broccoli on top of the final dish, that ended up tasting really good.

This was great for a beginner. I added 2 tbsp of cream cheese to the butter mixture and extra parmesan cheese. Loved that it used every day ingredients. Kids loved it. Canned Alfredo will be a re enter my house again!

The sauce was so easy to make. The only change I made was that I added 1 more tablespoon of Parmesan cheese. I used the sauce over zucchini noodles. Will definitely make again.

This sauce is amazing! The seasonings are perfect and go really well together. If you follow the instructions, it leaves you with a creamy, smooth, and delicious Alfredo!!

This is to die for!! The people that are complaining that the sauce is too grainy is because they aren’t following the directions. Add the flour, cheese, & milk SLOWLY! It’s absolutely perfect and my family loves it so much that I’ve had to make it twice this week!!

Awesome fast recipe.  Quantity is enough for two large servings.  You can also substitute Kodiak Protein Pancake Powder for the flour called for in the recipe.

I've made this a few times and my family absolutely loves it! I added a little more cheese and garlic but that's more for our taste. I definitely recommend trying it, it's easy and quick to make. Tip: save a mug of your pasta water to thin out the sauce once you add it to the pasta. Just pour a little bit at a time to get your desired consistency.

omg YES!!!! so i was dead broke. i mean $3 to payday broke. had enough money for a gallon of milk.  I had left over breaded chops I made the other day and  I wanted to use them up. but wanted Alfredo with Pasta with it.. put in my search for Alfredo sauce and this was the first recipe that came up. seen the ingredients and passed it up a few times but came back to it as it seemed easy and it all i had on hand.  Come to my  surprise it was really good! i did have to add  some Olive oil infused with basil,  a little bit of cooking white wine and a little pinch of cayenne. It was a HIT. and plus my kids loved it. added frozen peas for sneak veggie. what i really like about recipes like this is you can ad, increase or decrease ingredients! thanks

It was amazing. I made it for homemade chicken broccoli alfredo... The flour didn't mix so well, but I don't mind having some dumplings in my dish. Best recipe to use if you are avoiding heavy cream!

Made this after reading all the reviews. You definitely have to add the milk slowly but other than that this was pretty simple and straightforward AND delicious !!! You can add extra cheese but i got a little too excited and added a bit much. It was still great . What i love about this recipe is that it has no heavy whipping cream. Just make sure it looks like a ball of dough and start adding the milk slowly!

I love eating pasta with a creamy sauce with it. I also like alfredo sauce. I normally make alfredo sauce with cream, but everytime I make it it's not creamy enough. I am too lucky to find this amazingly creamy and easy sauce. I serve it over fettucini. Its  absolutely delicious. I higly recommend doing this. You won't regret it

You better have your ingredients at hand, because this recipe waits for no man. I didn't get up to medium high heat and I still burnt everything. I think it happened when I turned around to grab my garlic.

Liked making a sauce without cream.  I served it over pasta with peas, sauteed mushrooms, onions and peppers.
