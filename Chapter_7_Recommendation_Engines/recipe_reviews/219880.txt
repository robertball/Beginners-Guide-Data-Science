When I first saw this recipe I didn't have much expectations for it.  If anything I thought it would be severely lacking in flavour. I was pleasantly surprised that something SO simple could be SO good!  I only made a subtle change and that was to use boneless, skinless chicken breasts that I pre-boiled.  I will absolutely make this again!!!  THANKS FOR THE SHARE!

This chili is awesome and tastes really good. I used more chicken, though, and it could probably do with a bit less cheese.

I love that this is so easy to throw together!  I did use fresh skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, so I cooked on high instead for the 4-5 hrs to cook the chicken.  Then we shredded the chicken and added it back into the crock pot.  Great with a dollop of sour cream on top.

I'd give this 4 1/2 stars if I could - 5 stars are reserved for really awesome gourmet type stuff.
We are camping in a motorhome and I was looking for a recipe using canned chicken that wasn't chicken salad.  I had "most" of the ingredients onhand so here's what I used:
1 each 15 1/2 oz cans great northern beans and black beans, about 10 oz. of salsa (what was left in the jar in the fridge), 10 oz. can of chicken, about 1 1/2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese - and I threw in a 4 oz. can of mild, diced green chili's.  I put it all in a saucepan and heated it over medium heat till the cheese melted.  It was delish!  I'm amazed that this simple recipe was sooooo good.  I'm usually a "from scratch" cook but this was so good I'm going to be making it often.  Thanks, Nblanzy for a winner!

Great, easy recipe.  I changed it slightly because I didn't have all of what the recipe originally called for.  I used 1 16oz can of chili beans, 1 16oz can kidney beans and 1 16 oz can of the white kidney "cannellini" beans.  Also used half pound of mexican shredded cheese instead of pepperjack.  DELICIOUS!

Love how easy this recipe is!  I used 2 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves instead of a can of chicken.  I put them in the crock pot raw, then after 2 hours shredded them and added the meat back in for the remaining time.  When there was about an hour left to go, I did a taste test and though the initial flavor was great, but then became pretty bland.  So I added 1 Tbsp of oregano, 1/4 tsp cumin, 1/8 tsp chili powder, 1/8 tsp red pepper flakes.  The end result was delicious!  A huge hit for my guests. Everyone wanted the recipe!

Yum yum! Didn't use a crockpot, just zapped in the microwave. Smaller portions, of course. I love how quick and easy this was! I'm sure it would be better with fresh chicken, but it was 11pm, we were tired, I was not about to simmer some chicken for what could be a 5 minute recipe. I used a reduced fat mexican cheese blend, and we ate with tortilla strips and fat free sour cream. I do feel like this needed more chicken, though. Even with a serving size of 2, and a 5 oz. can of chicken, I felt this needed more chicken. Only 8 oz. of chicken in 72 oz. of everything else.. It just doesn't seem nearly enough. I'll make this as a quick dinner or lunch often and will try the slow cooker method soon too, to see if the flavors are more prominent.

We really enjoyed this!  I too used BLSL chicken breasts - maybe about 1 pound - and I used 2 15.5 oz cans of small white beans as that is what I had on hand.  I'm thinking next time I will try it with more salsa.  Very tasty as is though for something so easy!

Used a pound package of dried great northern white beans instead of canned.  Cooked two frozen boneless chicken breast halves with the beans on the stove and cut them up after cooking.  Added salsa, pepper jack cheese and salt to taste.  Very good and simple to make in about half the time of using a slow cooker.

It's kind of hard to believe how easy this is. I was happy to find a recipe that would allow me to use up the bag of dried great northern beans my grandma sent home with me on my last visit. This recipe uses about 1/2 a bag of dried northern beans. I bought a 24 oz. jar of salsa. I just went ahead and used the entire thing since there was so little left over. I bought 12.5 oz. can of chicken breast and used it all, including the water it was packed in. It was a long process, making the beans from a bag - rinsing them off, soaking them for 8 hours, quick rinse again, and then boiling them for one hour. The entire process beginning to end using dry beans is 13 1/2-14 hours. Whether you use the jar or dried beans though, it's all mostly hands-off prep,  which is great for busy people. I like to smash some of the beans before putting them in the crock pot too. Thickens the texture a bit. This was my second time making it. The first time making it, I cooked some chicken breast I had. I say save your chicken for a chicken main dish and just buy the canned stuff. Tastes the same and saves work. Now that I've used up Grandma's dry beans, I will try the jar beans and make it even easier.

This is a great basic recipe. I’m a vegetarian, so we make it using TVP (textured vegetable protein) or meatless chicken. It’s so easy and gets a lot of flavor from the salsa. I add some Tabasco to turn up the heat a little. Delicious with corn chips as well! I’ve gotten many compliments.

Delicious soup.  I make this recipe, but my version does not have the pepperjack cheese added.  I made a half batch of this using the cheese and the half without the cheese.  Adding the cheese made this version a lot thicker and added more calories.  But, once in a while, that is ok.  This is a delicious recipe and we thoroughly enjoyed it.  I served this with 'Winter Fruit Salad with Lemon Poppyseed Dressing' from AR.

You can't beat the simplicity of this recipe! A lot of flavor in just 4 ingredients. Quick,easy and delicious! I, as some other reviewers, used BLSL chicken breast and just cooked the whole thing in a pot on my stove after baking the chicken. Can't wait to make this again!

I decided to make this for a potluck at work in a few weeks but had some chicken in the fridge I needed to cook so I thought I'd make a test batch to see if I would need to add anything and I have to say this recipe is great as is!!! I used 3 15oz cans of beans, 1 undrained, 1 half drained and 1 completely drained and a jar of salsa verde. The recipe came out fantastic and I can't wait to hear every one at work rave about this!

Easy and delicious.  I thought the recipe called for a tad too much cheese so I used 1/4 pound and it was still fantastic!

Used 1 can great northern beans, 1 can corn, 8oz pepper jack, can of chicken, and most of a jar of mango peach salsa. Let sit in the crock pot all afternoon on low and it was DELICIOUS! Great with tortilla chips or just some torn up tortillas. The mango peach salsa made it sweet but still had a little kick

For how easy it is, should be 6 stars.  Use fresh boiled and shredded chicken instead.  Canned chicken is always pretty gross, no matter the recipe.  Hubby loves it!
