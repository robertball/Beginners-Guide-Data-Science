My mother in law also made this frosting, the tips she told me to having it turn out good were to always use whole milk and to have patience. It takes about 10-15 minutes of beating (easier in a stand mixer). My personal preference is to use this frosting on a cake that is kept in the fridge. Jello cake is excellent much better then the standard cool whip. Also I learned the first time I ever made this not to taste it til it was completely done, IT WILL TASTE AWFUL before its mixed til fluffy, it sets up to a firm frosting on a fridge cake. I also stick it in the fridge for a few minutes before I frost my cake.

This was good and easy to make.  I used 1 cup of butter instead of shortening and margarine.  You definitely have to add the milk slowly and mix it for a bit til it's a nice texture.  Turned out great.

Needed some frosting in a pinch, and this worked out great. It was pretty basic, but i suppose it's supposed to be. I flavoured mine with vanilla. The flavor of the frosting was pretty decent, a little lacking in complexity (all my mouth was thinking was 'Sugar and butter') Aslo, i would strongly recommend adding the hot milk, very little by little. I accidentally put too much in at once and it melted all of my butter and shortning, and i was left with a runny liquid. 
I tried to put it in an ice bath, but it never thickened up the way i was hoping it would. Ended up using it still drippy
Will probably try this recipe again when i have the need- I like how simple it is to make. Good recipe to know, incase you ever have a frosting emergency.

I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and used unsalted butter instead of shortening and margarine; I also added a teaspoon of vanilla and combined half-and-half with 1% milk.  I used my KitchenAid stand mixer to whip the frosting and it turned out fluffy, light and not too sweet.  I will definitely use this recipe again!

i made this recipe because i didn't have enough confectioners sugar to make the icing i usually make. this was definitely easy to make, and it ended up with a nice consistency- very light and fluffy and easily spreadable. it was mostly bland with a strong aftertaste of shortening, and not at all sweet. i ended up dumping the rest of my confectioners sugar in it to sweeten it up a little and that didn't improve it much.

Well, it is easy - i'll give it that. However, I really do not care for this frosting at all. I did listen to the advice to let it blend for 15 minutes first, but it still tastes aweful and I'm pretty sure that I did everything correctly - it would be hard not to. I just abhor the taste of shortening and this tastes like crisco mixed with sugar. Sorry, but no thanks. 

I looked at some other recipes in an effort to fix this. I added one egg white and another 1/2 cup butter. It tastes a lot better and the butter seems to have gotten rid of the shortening taste. it will do.

If I could give this no stars I would. I followed the recipe to a tee and all I got was slop. looked like soup in the bowl. I was very upset that I had wasted my ingredients on this. DO NOT MAKE!! For those that had no problem I'd like to know your secret. Very dissapointed.

I used butter instead of margarine and shortening and this frosting tasted sooo good and was wonderfully fluffy.  I will be using this recipe for the rest of my life!

mine did not turn out good at all, but I had no choice so I had to frost my cake with it.  Maybe I didn't beat it long enough (probably mixed it for about 10 minutes) but the sugar didn't dissolve and so it was grainy and very greasy from the shortening I assume.  I added a bit of vanilla but that didn't help much.  I should just stick with the powdered sugar version I have next time.

This worked great for me.  I used the 1 cup of butter in place of the Shortening and the Margarine and it turned out wonderful.  I also used some Strawberry flavoring and put it on a chocolate Birthday cake.  Everyone was happy with the outcome.  I will use it again.

I flavoured this with a bit of table syrup and thought it was lovely. My family were convinced it was Cool Whip, and I had to work to convince them otherwise. This made more than enough icing to frost a double layer eight inch cake. Thanks alot!

Like some others that have posted, I did not care for this recipe much.  It turned out very greasy tasting.  I prefer frostings that call for confectioners sugar, I suppose.  Thanks for the recipe, it just didn't work for me.

I attempted this recipe.  I added vanilla to aid with flavor.  I bear it for a long time and it never fluffed up.  It was oily and separated.  The taste was overpowered by shortening

I made frosting for the first time ever tonight and I used this recipe.  I loved it.  I used the suggestion about the full cup of butter. I also added the vanilla and I am really happy with it.

It tasted awful, like gross milk honestly. Maybe I did something wrong? I followed ALL directions, I don't want to make this again. :-(

Must have screwed something up-- it tasted awful... should have read other reviews first to figure it out. I was going for quick easy frosting and ended up with something not quite frosting.

I love the ease of making this, I love that it's "normal" ingredients that are always on hand, and I love the taste!!  I agree with another who warns not to try it until it's done, but when it's done, wow!
