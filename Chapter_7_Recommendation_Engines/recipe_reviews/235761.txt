This is a keeper; the only ingredient I changed was to use Golden Mushroom Soup instead of Cream of Mushroom. The Golden Mushroom creates a much richer sauce with chunks of mushrooms.
I trimmed the roast of fat and cut it up into serving size chunks (Not too small).
I was thoroughly impressed with the flavor of the gravy and served it with garlic mashed potatoes and steamed veg’s. Everyone loved it.
Thanks for sharing great recipe.

Haven't even eaten the meal yet, and just tasting the gravy, it will become a staple in my kitchen and a real favorite.  Won my wife over with this meal as well!  Only thing I did different is I had seared the chuck roast before placing it into the crock pot.  This was a great Sunday football type meal!

Made this last night, um, YUM!  The gravy is so delicious and sweet just like we love. I added carrots 1 hour and a half before 6 hours was up, next time going to add potatoes.  Made a baked potatoe and poured gravy over it, you definitely DO NOT NEED FLOUR.

Hi - this is a recipe I submitted a long time ago.  I would suggest you cook this on low for 8 hours or high for 4-5 hours.  Also, a sear on the roast before placing into slow cooker does add more flavor, but not necessary.  I do that when I have time.

I made this yesterday. Pretty much stuck to the recipe. Added some onions and mushrooms and lots of garlic.

This was a great roast! The only changes I made was to add a double shot of Jameson's Irish Whiskey to it.
It turned out great.

Good flavor and the fam loved it.  I added some red bliss potatoes with 2 hours left.  They took on too much of the beef flavor so I would make them separately next time.

Only thing I did different was I threw mini potatoes and baby carrots all in the bottom of the crockpot. I put the roast on top of the veggies and then I mixed all other ingredients together and poured in. Turned out awesome!

This was the best roast I’ve had in a long, long time!! I didn’t have a can of gravy, so I used a packaged gravy and used a can of water, I used half the amount of sugar and I added 2 small onions and 4 small garlic cloves to the mix. The gravy was amazing! An absolute keeper!

My family loved this!  I followed the hints of others and halved the brown sugar and added carrots 1 1/2 hr before serving.  Didn't have the beef gravy so substituted beef broth.  I will definitely be fixing this again and have bragged so much about it my sisters want the recipe.

Great combination of flavors! My husband is partial to salt and I'm partial to sweet, so I halved the sugar as a compromise and it was still plenty sweet. I also added 1/2 cup water to thin out the gravy. everyone loved it! My brother is a huge pot roast lover, and he said it was one of the best he's ever had.

This roast is delicious, tender and sweet. For a complete meal, add potatoes and carrots (or other veggies). A great recipe that we have made several times.
