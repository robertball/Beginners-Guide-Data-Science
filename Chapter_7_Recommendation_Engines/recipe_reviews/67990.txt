Despite switching out the cheddar for deep fried onions, I give this recipe a perfect rating!  The taste, the presentation, the ease and make-ahead ability deserve nothing less!  I've been ill and it was the first dish I've made in months for the big Easter dinner (45+ people) and it was more than a hit! I loved the mushroom sauce so much before adding the green beans I turned around and made it a second time as chunky soup! The family devoured it!  I've since made it again with whole & powdered garlic, regular mushroom soup and plain mushrooms... again a hit with everyone, even added left over rice for a twist the next day!  Thanx a million for sharing!

I have been looking for a variation of the usual cream of mushroom/green bean casserole dish for the Passover holiday, and after reading the reviews on this recipe I tried it. It was an incredible hit. My family loved it and couldn't stop raving about it. You can make it the night before and just add the cheese the next day after warming. The only change I made to the recipe was to use turkey bacon in lieu of real bacon for kosher reasons. I will definitely make this one again.

I made this for Thanksgiving, except I added fried onions on top.  I also mixed the cheese in with the rest of the ingredients and let it melt before putting it in the oven instead of topping the casserole with cheese.  It was very good!!

YUM - it goes really well with the traditional Thanksgiving meal.  I made the recipe for Thanksgiving and it disappeared so fast that I had to make a second double batch so we could have more leftovers!  Everyone liked the crunchy texture that the almonds gave.  I substituted frozen cut green beans and used regular cream of mushroom soup adding a little extra chopped garlic.  
The second time I didn't have baby portabello mushrooms so I used button mushrooms; it wasn't as good with the button mushrooms.  Next time I'll try french cut green beans (probably frozen) and definitely use baby portabellos/crimini mushrooms.

The second time I made this I could not get baby portobello mushrooms, so I used the big adult ones in their place.  I took off the stem and cut the cap into half inch dice - thought it was even better.  Due to time restrictions, I made the dish and after putting in the casserole dish I out in the refrigerator over night.  The next day I left it in the oven an extra five minutes before adding the cheese.  Came out great - gave away copies of the recipe.

This recipe really just gave my old fresh green beans a kick.  I didn't add the cream of mush or the cheese because I like neither.  I used fresh green beans and cooked them in a bit of water with the bacon, garlic, onion, and pepper on the bottom of the pan until right before the green beans were edible.  I then added the mushrooms.  By the time the mushrooms were done the beans were, too.  It cut down on the fat and salt intake.

I made this for Eatser and it was a hit with the family.  I used 1 1/2 lbs of fresh green beans, cooked and cut in half (fresh is so much better than canned green beans). Used a can of cream of muchroom soup (that's what I had on hand). Did not use all of the 1/4 cup of oil it called for.  I toasted the almonds in a non stick pan until they were light brown in color (not burned) and used fried onions(in the can) for the top, not the cheese.  Very tasety, would make again.

The first thing you should know is that my husband absolutely loathes the traditional Green Bean Casserole. We NEVER, EVER have it on any holiday. This was an experiment for us. I used only 6 ounces of baby bellas in this recipe and used the plain fat-free cream of mushroom soup, and pressed in one or two cloves of fresh garlic. I also used frozen beans (a one-pound sack, and I cooked them before adding them) instead of the canned. What we ended up with was a crunchy, flavorful, colorful, interesting and delicious dish WHICH, by the way, my husband had SECONDS of! The leftovers were even tastier the next day.

Excellent recipe!!!  
What a great change from the same old(but still great)green bean casserole. I hestitated trying a new and different-sounding recipe (especially with company for Thanksgiving dinner!)  But I'm glad I did, it was a great success with everyone.  I did as suggested by another reviewer and substituted the canned french-fried onions in place of the cheese.  I'd definitely recommend trying this yummy recipe!!!

I followed some other reviews and used frenchs fried onions in this also, but it was so yummy! I am not a fan of mushrooms and was very skeptical about trying the recipe, but so happy I did! Will make again!

Great recipe!
I've made it 3 times already and every time I bring it to a potluck someone asks "who made this" and then compliments me :)
Due to religious dietary restrictions, I make it with turkey bacon and it tastes great! 
A good, sharp cheddar is a must.

Very Good with a few changes.  I omitted the oil and fried the bacon and onion together  then added the mushrooms and garlic let it simmer for about 5 minutes.  I also put cheese and french fried onions into the green bean mixture as well as on top.  I know the recipe doesn't call for the french fried onions but they're too good to leave out.  Everyone loved this recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is easy and outstanding.  I have made this several times and it always comes out perfectly.  Baby bell mushrooms work if you don't have the large ones. Every time I bring it to an event, there is none leftover.  The only change I make is omitting the cheddar cheese and topping with French fried onions.

Finally used this version after printing it last year.  Very yummy!  Stirred in the cheddar cheese just before baking and topped with the fried onions.  Everyone loved this.  I'll make it again!

Honestly, we didn't think this tasted much different than traditional green bean casserole, which was kind of a let down after all of the extra work & ingredients. It's also an ugly brown color(from the soup). I left out the almonds. Did NOT like the bacon in this & I'm a bacon LOVER. Just didn't mesh for me. I don't understand the submitters "spicier" reference? Altho it was good, nothing over the top.

Excellent! I used regular (on sale) mushrooms, and omitted the almonds. I substituted the cheddar cheese for french fried onions also, and I didn't have any seasoned salt so I used celery salt, onion powder, garlic powder, crushed thyme and dried parsley flakes. So good!

Sorry, this is not for me. I followed the recipe exactly and was quite disappointed. Since the recipe had many good reviews I decided to give it a whirl for a potluck we were attending. Everybody there had the same re-action, not bad, but.... we don't think we would make it again. I agree.

I used fresh green beans instead of canned, which makes a huge difference. I topped the casserole with cheddar flavored fried onions to get the best of both worlds. I think was a little much. Next time I would just use the plain onions.

Got mixed reviews on this. We made it for Thanksgiving dinner and half of my table requested we not make it again.  Those of us that did liked it loved it.  Warning though, this is not your standard green bean casserole, it's more like a bake or a quiche than the traditional casserole.

This vaguely resembled the traditional Thanksgiving dish, but was so different. The poster is correct - crazy mix of textures and flavors abound this casserole. I used less mushrooms, premade bacon (just had to heat it up), and regular cream of mushroom. It was so flavorful and filling. Don't be afraid to try this when it's not the holiday season as this would be a fab side for any heavy meat dish. (We had it with Amazing Slow Cooker Pork Tenderloin.)

Loved this recipe....Didn't know if I was supposed to drain the bacon juice or not so I kept half of it, it made it a bit greasy but flavorfull. I added fried onions which was a big hit. Next time I will add more green beans, the mushrooms were a bit overpowering and I'm a BIG mushroom fan. My boyfriend and I are also big cheese lovers so i added an extra cup of cheese which made it heavenly. Will definatly use this again!

This is the best green bean casserole I've had! I'm surprised it doesn't have five stars. I love the addition of the almonds, which gives it a great texture. I'm a vegetarian, so I don't add the bacon, but when I made it for my dad and I, I crumbled 3-4 cooked pieces into just his bowl and he kept "mmm"ing and saying how "bacony" it was. I've never added the cheese on top, because I like it so much without it, and I usually just use regular canned mushrooms, not Portobello. I also just use regular pepper. My tips: I buy almonds in the bulk section at my local store and dry roast them in a pan on low-medium, stirring semi-frequently, and they taste great in the casserole, as do the sugary, salted slivered ones you buy for snacking (Sunkist?). Also, get all of the water out of your green beans and mushrooms! I grab a small handful - less than half a can - and squeeze it as hard as I can, move it around in my hand, and repeat for about a full minute, letting the juice leave through my fingers. Otherwise the casserole, like any other, can get runny. Second, the kind of almonds and cream of mushroom soup you use seems to make the most difference in the taste (more than the green beans and mushrooms). I don't normally like Campbell's soup, and I hate to use brand names in my review, but so far I've found theirs to be the best. I don't find the amount to be 10 servings. I normally double it for just my dad and I to eat and have a good amount of leftovers with.

This is super yummy.  I didn't even know about the cream of mushroom with roasted garlic until this recipe.  I consider this a must have!!!! It has a much richer flavor than the regular.  For those who aren't crazy about mushrooms I would cut the amt in half. (it's pretty mushroomy!!) The texture from all the goodies was wonderful.  I will use this again!

I usually never rate a recipe that I've altered, but since I'm giving it 5 stars, I will.  It drives me crazy when someone will give a recipe a low rating and then go on to say they changed the recipe umpteen different ways--sheesh!  Anyway, the only changes I made to this one was to use steamed fresh green beans, lightly toasted pecans instead of almonds and skip the last step (baking and cheese).  It came out really "gourmet-y" and was very pretty because the beans were so bright.  I also didn't use the garlic cream of mushroom soup because they were sold out so I just doubled up on the fresh garlic.  This is a great recipe I will use again soon!

This is an awesome substitute to the classic green bean casserole. My family absolutely loved it and asked me to make it every year!! I've made this dish a few times and found we like it better without the can of soup.

I'd give it 3 1/2 stars if I could.  It wasn't that I didn't like this dish - I did.  I guess it just wasn't suited to my taste.  I love all of the ingredients that was in it, so I thought I'd love the dish as well.  I liked it ok, but not enough to make it again.  (Well, it's highly doubtful.)  I prepared it exactly according to the directions with one exception - I couldn't find baby portobello mushrooms in my grocery store, so I used regular portobellos and just chopped them up smaller. My boyfriend also said it was "Ok", but that he preferred the traditional green bean casserole.  I think I agree.  But, I wanted to try something different, and this definately was!

I made this for Easter as an alternative to the traditional Green Been Casserole, and the entire family (all 19 of them) loved it. Everyone wants the recipe. 

A seasoned cheif may only take fifteen minutes of prep time for this recipe, but as an amature, it took me an hour of prep before I could put the casserole in the oven.

I was looking for a recipe for a from scratch green bean casserole. I found this with the added extra ingredients and really liked it. It still has the characteristic green brean casserole flavor, but seems a little more special with the additions. I realized I bought only 8oz of mushrooms instead of the 1 lb, so I also cut the amount of almonds in half to. For the bacon I just used pre-cooked thick cut bacon and heated it in the pan. The added garlic flavor and toppings blended together well. The only downside it is a kind of salty, but what casserole or dish with canned soup isn't. I will be adding it to my personal recipe box for another holiday side dish. Thank you

Last minute choice so I only had white button mushrooms handy. Took out cheese and went with reviewer substitute of French fried onions. Used turkey bacon in place of regular for lower fat content. Did not add seasoned salt since canned soup had plenty of salt in it. Dinner guests went for seconds with compliments to the chef.

Very flavorful! Was a bit salty but that was probably because I subbed french onions for the cheese.  Will make again, perhaps without the seasoned salt. Thanks for a great recipe though!

Racing home from church on Easter Sunday, we had to "heat and run" to get to Grandma's house for dinner--thus had to modify this recipe--5+ stars nonetheless.  Having forgotten fresh mushrooms, used canned; used real bacon bits instead of frying; and mixed cheese in with the rest instead of using as topping at the end (battle for oven time).  Next time I'll try frozen or fresh green beans (hate mushy veggies) but regardless, the combination of the nutty crunch and the spices brought this recipe rave reviews, from fussy uncles to testy teens...

Fantastic version of an old standby.  I too used only half the mushrooms called for in the recipe, and omitted the nuts, but it was full of flavor.

Very, very yummy! The only thing I changed was, I look out the almonds and put in small, potato slices. I tried it with the almonds the first time I made it, but it was too crunchy. Other than that, the most wonderful green bean casserole ever!

Try making your own cream sauce with   finely chopped mushrooms added to avoid the MSG in the canned soup. I have done it this way and it tastes just as good!

The "Seasoned Salt with no MSG" that is called for sounds great, but every canned Cream of Mushroom soup I've seen has MSG/flavor enhancer in its ingredients so it's still there ... that's the only reason I didn't give 5 stars.  Anyone know something to substitute for the canned soup that doesn't have MSG?

Too much garlic for me.  I am going to try this again with cream of mushroom soup instead of roasted garlic and maybe only 1 clove of garlic.  I think with these changes it will be 5 star since we arn't garlic fans!

This was a totally awesome recipe!  I made it with Christmas dinner and everyone loved it.  Lots of ingredients, but they tasted great together.  Just for experimentation purposes, I put french fried onions on half of it and it turned out well.  I've already given out this recipe 4 times.

This is an awesome take on classic (sometimes bland) green bean casserole! Just Amazing! It could be a little garlic-y for some. If you don't love garlic, use traditional cream of mushroom soup, and maybe cut down to two cloves of garlic. The almonds aren't a must.. its just as great without them. This is so easy, I make it often, not just on holidays.

Thought it was very good. I used turkey bacon, and did take the suggestion of mixing in the shredded cheddar the mixture and then adding french fried onions on top. I added a spoonful of sour cream b/c the cheese thickened it up a bit.  The bacon and portobellos gave depth to the plain ole green bean casserole recipe. The pan was empty and I was told this needs to be my official Christmas vegetable, so I think its a keeper!

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was a huge hit. I used fresh green beans rather than canned. I cut them and boiled them for about 10 minutes before preparing the rest. I followed the recipe exactly how it was written other than that. Thanks for this great twist on my husband's favorite holiday dish. We will certainly make this again!

I tried this out for Thanksgiving since I was very burnt out on regular green bean casserole. This turned out really well. I left out the almonds (not a fan) and used regular cream of mushroom soup instead of the soup with roasted garlic. That was a mistake on my part, though and I'll use the correct soup next time.

Got lots of compliments on this at tonight's Thanksgiving dinner. It was easy to prepare, although start in a large stock pot so that you don't waste extra dishes in the long run. I did without the olive oil as there was plenty of bacon grease left to work with. My mushroom soup also didn't have garlic in it, but no one was the wiser. :) I have been requested to make this again for future events, so you should try it too!

Too much garlic flavor - too many mushrooms - the almonds did nothing for this. I'm sorry to be so critical, but I just didn't like it, nor did anyone else.

We were out of mushrooms, but had the mushroom soup that was jus enough mushroom to keep the flavor.  The little crunch was the conversation piece.  It went fast. I'm making more for the homeless christmas dinner next week. Fabulous!

Excellent recipe!  I made this for Thanksgiving and it was fabulous.  The garlic gives it a kick and the almonds give it a great, and needed, texture.  Yum!!!!

This is one of two go-to green bean casserole recipes that I've been using and loving for years.  I'm such a mushroom fanatic there's just no way I wouldn't love an extra pound of mushrooms added to an old favorite.

I used way more bacon (about 10 slices, maybe more) and I put cheese on top until I was satisfied it was enough. This was the most amazing green bean casserole I have ever eaten. I've made it for a couple of family gatherings and it has always been a big hit. We love it.

I agree - only use a little olive oil. I sauteed the onions and mushrooms in the olive oil, then added them to par-cooked FRESH green beans.  Used two cans of cream of mushroom soup so I could add cooked rice an make an entire meal in a pan.  We loved the result.

I am giving this 3 stars because as written, I would not rate it highly. Having said that, with some changes it can be a great twist on the traditional green bean casserole. First, I will only use fresh green beans. They are abundant and so much better. Just trim and plunge in boiling water for 5-7 minutes and then drain and set aside. I also dislike pre seasoned spices. Use fresh garlic, onions, salt, pepper and oregano. I love the use of portobello mushrooms. I also used smoked tempeh instead of bacon because I have vegetarians in my family. With those substitutions it was a very satisfying dish.

Wow, I had my doubts but this is probably one of the best green bean casseroles I've ever had. Was going to omit the almonds but am glad I didn't, it gave it some interesting texture. Will make again!

The portobello mushrooms came in a 14 oz package containing 3 large mushrooms.  I used one of them...the rest of them would have been TOO much mushroom.  Good recipe....but didn't "wow" me.  Probably won't make it again but it was nice for Thanksgiving meal==something a little different.

I took the advise of others and cut the amount of mushrooms; One pound is really too much.  I also made with regular cream of mushroom soup and one less clove of garlic.  Everyone ate it up.

I would give this a 3, but I didn't follow it exactly. I made my own cream of mushroom soup, which normally helps a recipe, and I used romano instead of cheddar b/c I was out. It was OK, it just wasn't exciting at all...kind of bland, yet the soup tsted great on its own.

I felt it had just a little to much Garlic with the Mushroom Soup with Garlic,  so the next time I make it I will just use 2 cloves of Garlic.   But I will make it again!

A nice change from the usual.  I used canned green beans, and used only 1'2 the baby bellos..was perfect and the almonds gave a nice crunch.  I made it the night before, set it out for an hour then baked as usual.  I also used regular cream of mushroom, not wanting the strong garlic flavor.  Would make again!

I mixed in the cheese like the other reviewer and topped at the end of cooking with both almonds and canned fried onions.  I used sliced almonds, not slivered. Also only had pancetta and used it instead of bacon. Great.  Made this for Thanksgiving -- where I don't really think garlic should be with all of those other milder flavors, so I omitted all of the garlic.  Kids had friends over later and ate this first.

I made this for Thanksgiving diner and it was a HIT!  I promised to make it again for Christmas!  Everyone loved it!  The slivered almonds and the bacon gave this a nice crunch along with the french fried onions!

All the ingredients sounded SO yummy, and I LOVE green bean casserole, so I'm not sure what I did wrong with this.  I made it for Thanksgiving dinner and everyone politely ate it, but it didn't go over too well as a whole. I had to leave out the almonds (everyone vetoed them), so maybe that makes a difference? I hate being negative, but I was just really disappointed with this one :(. I loved the mushrooms and onions in it though, so I think I may try it again using regular Cream of Mushroom soup instead.

First made this last Thanksgiving at a pot luck dinner I went to and it was a raving success!  Everyone wanted the recipe!  Very rich and tasty.

Thank you ! We were tired of the same old green bean casserole too. Made this for thanksgiving, it was a huge hit, I'll cut the recipe in half and use it often- it's that good.

I made it yesterday using fresh green beans. I did not like it.
