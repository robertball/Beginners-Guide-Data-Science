My mother and I have used this recipe for years.The only difference is that we soak the ham in Coca-Cola for 15 min. first and we like the tang of regular yellow mustard better.I have never had a ham that I liked better.

One of the most basic glazes I've tried and, as is so often the case, one of the best. Simple, on hand ingredients is a definite plus.  One thing I found helpful is to move the hame onto a foil lined pan when it's time to glaze otherwise the cleanup can be a bit of a pain.

We really like our ham with plain prepared mustard & black pepper, so I compromised. First, I scored the ham and rubbed on my original mustard & black pepper mix. 30 minutes before taking it out, I basted it with the Dijon & brown sugar. We all enjoyed it, and I think I will do this from now on. Also, the best store-bought ham I've ever had is Tavern Ham. I find it most often at Wal-Mart. It's a bit pricier, but well worth it.

An easy, tasty recipe for ham...but I'm not sure about  the directions. It says that the ham should bake for 2 hours before the glaze is put on...my ham was fully cooked already, and took only half an hour to heat up completely. After the half hour, I put on the glaze and baked it for another half hour. It came out delicious. I can't imagine what it would have been like had I baked it for 2 hours! Also, there is a bit too much sugar in the glaze...I cut it down to 1 cup, and if I make this again, I'll probably cut it down a bit more. Altogether, this is very tasty. I might make it again...Thanks for sharing!

I don't usually give out five stars, but this was great and sooo simple.  Just made this for Easter and everyone raved about how great the ham was.  It was probably the best ham I've ever tasted.  I did soak the ham in a can of coca cola for about 15 inutes prior to cooking.  Awesome and easy, definately recommend.

I used regular brown sugar and 1 c. not 1 1/4c. It was weird to spread on b/c its real thick. Maybe it was the mustard(Inglehoffer). It bubbled up alot during cooking. Im glad I lined my baking pan with foil. Came out pretty tasty. :) My family ate it up! and they're picky!

My husband and I BOTH HATED this recipe, it tasted like Mustard over ham. The steaks were gooey and just really tasted like mustard and sugar, I'll never use this recipe again, EVER!

This was really very good.  I'm not usually a fan of glazes on ham, but I decided to try this one because of the mustard.  It was delicious - very sweet, but with a bit of tang.  I will not try another recipe, this is now "my" ham glaze!  Enjoy!

Mmmmm this was so good!... I used to always make a pinapple topped ham but this is so much better imo!  I halfed the recipe for my small ham;I used regular mustard and added 1 tsp. of maple syrup in the brown sugar glaze.  My ham was so juicy and delicious!.. I will use this recipe again!

This was wonderful!  I didn't have dark brown sugar, so I substituted the last quarter cup of sugar for molasses.  Fabulous!

This is a great and easy glaze.  I added pure maple syrup to mine and everyone that I had over for dinner raved about how wonderful the ham was.  I will continue to do it that way.  Also used Jack Daniels mustard....it's the best!

really really really good. Made a nice crunchy layer on the ham. I used fresh squeezed orange juice in the pan, along with some nutmeg and garlic powder. It was INCREDIBLE!

Another wonderful ham recipe from this site!  I loved the fact that the glaze only used 2 ingredients (and not fancy-schmancy ones you have to buy just for this recipe either).  My family loved the ham.  Period.  Tons of compliments.

This sweet and tangy flavor was the perfect topping for the ham.  I used golden brown sugar and don't think it gave it quite as much "presence" as it demanded.  I will try this again with the dark brown sugar next time.

Exceptional. It's better than the traditional cloves, brown sugar & pineapple coating, which we love & grew up on. Definitely 100 times easier...just mix & pour atop...takes about 10 seconds..and with 2 ingredients that are always on hand, it cannot be beat. THANKS SO MUCH!

Super tastey and super simple for a working mom of two. I was looking for the most simple glaze I could find w/ the ingredients I had in the house. Used regular mustard instead and really love this glaze.

I made this glaze for the Easter ham and can't tell you how simple, fast, and tasty this recipe was. I used to spend a long time preparing my marinade, no longer. I will be using this glaze again and again!!
Thanks!

Great ham recipe. I made it for Easter dinner and everyone liked it even better than the usual ham with pineapple. The sauce is thick which keeps it on the ham instead of dripping into the pan. It was so simple too.

Yum! I NEVER eat the rind on ham, but this recipe changed that. So simple, and so good.

Everyone loved this. We used real dijon mustard and the bite was fantastic.

This was awesome.  I used a bone in ham so was very tender and juicy.  The outside pieces were the favorites with everyone at Christmas!  Will definitely make again!

One of the best glazes that I have ever made! I make it for every ham that I make now. Not too sweet and not too tangy, just right!

I have tried other Brown Sugar and mustard glaze but the Dujon mustard made a big difference. I served this at Thanksgiving Dinner.  Everyone thought it was great.
