Way to many potatos. I'd put in half as much at most.

I absolutely loved the taste. The peas gave it a nice, sweet quality. But in the eyes of my 5 year old, it was "green stuff," so she really struggled to even touch it. It's not the most visually pleasing, but it tastes great!

My 3 year old ate it.  My husband said it was missing ham hock and asked if it was split pea soup.  I thought it was okay.  Pretty decent recipe could use some tweaking but I doubt I will be making it again.  I made it only to get rid of some leeks I had in the fridge and used fresh peas from my garden instead of frozen.  Didn't have tarragon so substituted oregano instead.
