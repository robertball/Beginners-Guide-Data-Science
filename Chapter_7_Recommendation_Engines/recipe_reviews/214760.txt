I used whole wheat flour, I cut the sugar back to a half cup (my bananas were REALLY ripe so I really didn't need that much sugar) and used free-range eggs. She wasn't kidding about the coconut extract really being the money flavor in these muffins. Holy frijoles, was that GOOD! And I'll tell you, using whole wheat flour and cutting back on the sugar didn't affect the flavor AT ALL. NOTE: I got 12 medium-large muffins out of this recipe. 350* for 20 minutes was just right for muffins. If you want to avoid a rubbery loaf/muffin, I suggest you wisk together the dry ingredients in one bowl, then wisk together all the wet and lightly fold the wet ingredients into the dry. This way, you don't overwork your ingredients and don't end up with a "rubbery" muffin.

I made this exactly as stated and it was terrific.  It was so moist.  I did make it as a large loaf instead of the mini loaves and I had to cover it to keep from browning too much while it finished baking.

VERY good banana bread.  I doubled the ingredients and it made 7 mini loaves (6 x 3 1/2).  I made as directed with the exception of light butter, only had regular.  Baked 3 without nuts (for son) and 4 with the toasted nuts.  Delicious - will be making this one again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This recipe was delicious! I made a 9 inch round cake and my floor mates devoured the whole thing within 15 minutes! I took the advice of others and avoided overbeating the batter, and ended up with a perfectly moist and soft cake. I will definitely be recommending this recipe to other baking enthusiasts.

The loaves had a nice taste, but the texture was not right. They were definitely rubbery.

My sisters loved this and requested for more! Used the mini loaves pan, added 3/4 c of sweetened coconut flakes and reduced sugar to 1/2 c.

Didn't toast the pecans but it was just as good.  I have an 8 mini loaf pan and used a medium size ice cream scooper to fill my pan.  I used 3 scoops for each loaf.  My son loves this recipe
Thanks

I made these in large muffin tins and baked for 18 to 20 minutes!  They were fabulous! It was my first time having "roasted" pecans! I am SO hooked!

I make this recipe all the time and I will need to disagree with the reviewer who claimed these were rubbery. The recipe clearly states to mix your dry ingredients separately and then stir them into the wet mix. STIR, don't beat. I get asked all the time to make this recipe.

3.19.19  My mini loaf pans are 3-1/2”x 6”, I baked for 35 minutes at 350ºF, and ended up with three mini loaves of banana bread.  There were some different ingredients in this recipe not typically found in banana bread, and that piqued my curiosity.  I followed this recipe to the letter except for using unsalted butter instead of light butter.  The loaves baked up pretty much flat on the top rather than a slight dome that you find on most banana bread, but that’s not a negative, just different.  You taste the hint of coconut flavor (I loved that), it’s pleasantly sweet, super moist, and almost more like a cake than a quick/sweet bread.  So you can call it cake or you can call it bread, but to me, all that really matters is how it tastes, and that is lip-smacking GOOD!!

I did not alter the ingredients, whisked together the wet and dry ingredients as suggested.  I made one loaf (9 x 5) and baked it at 350 deg for 1-hour.  It is the best banana bread I have ever eaten.

I didn't have any coconut extract or pecans on hand, so I left them out, but the bread still came out great! It was really moist, and neither too heavy/dense (which tends to be the case with a lot of other recipes I've tried), nor too "light." And the crust on top of the bread was perfect, with a slightly crispy bite to it. I don't like to use a lot of butter/oil in my baking, so I found it a bit too oily for my liking - perhaps next time I'll try replacing some of the butter with applesauce. Other than that though, a great recipe I plan to use again.

This is one of the oddest recipes I've ever created, as far as the mechanics but Oh My it is AMAZINGLY delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I doubled it.  I ended up with one normal size loaf and 5 minis.  Everyone is asking for the recipe.  I'll definitely make this again!

Sitting here munching on it with a cup of tea!! Absolute delicious, I made one loaf in a 9x5 tin and baked for about 45 mins covering the last part so it didn’t brown too much. I used candied pecans instead. I’ll definitely make this again.

Wow. With only 19 reviews when I made this I was a bit unsure. I followed the directions exactly. I used mini round pans and baked 27 minutes. I did accidentally use the mixer for the wet/dry musing but beat on low. It still turned out amazingly moist and fluffy. This is a keeper!

My daughter and I experiment with this recipe, adapting it to our way of eating, and really like it.  We use rice flour, 1 cup of agave for sweetener, coconut oil and sometimes ghee, no coconut extract.  Our family loves it!

I’ve made this over and over for my family and they love it!!!  It is so incredibly moist and flavorful. I only added more walnuts. It’s no better satisfaction than to see your family eating the bread right out of the pan with a fork. If I go too long without making it I hear about it...lol

Yes! I toasted wal-nuts 1/4 cup with the pecans. I used almond extract in place of the coconut extract. I used orange juice squeezed fresh( in place of the lemon juice). I also added 1/ 2 tsp cinnamon. It was the most flavorful Banana Nut Bread I have ever had!!

It was simple and easy. I altered the recipe and used shredded coconut about 1/4 cup as a substitute for the coconut extract that I didn't have.  Along with substituting butter with margarine. Omitted the pecans and used a muffin instead of a loaf pan.  Baking now today 12/15/2019. Waiting on results.  For now, the star rating is 4 until the baking is done.

Update on the 12/15/19 post.  As of 12/16/2019, everything is done and I am able to add some pictures.  Lest I not forget the rating goes to 5.

Forgot to include that I used unbleached flour and organic sugar. I will do this recipe and try some other flours and sugars.

Nice texture.  I didn't have any extracts the first time I made it and only used 1/2 cup sugar (on purpose).  Next time, get the  extracts and try 2/3 cup of sugar.

I made this according to directions.  The first batch I had to add about 1/4c more flour.  The second batch was just right.  I attribute this to the first batch bananas were very OVER  ripe, second batch were just very ripe.   Newbies should know that the batter will be very lumpy when you incorporate the flour, not smooth like a cake batter (smooth batter means you have over beaten instead of mixed, and your bread will be rubber.  I also reduced the sugar in the second batch, removing a scant 1/4c because they were too sweet.  Equal amounts of flower and sugar usually is.

After 30 minutes at 300 degrees F, the bread was rising but still in clear color and was not cook. I added 30 minutes more at 350 degrees F, seems cooked but still "wet" and sticky.
We shall see the taste.

This recipe/dish was fantastic and went very quickly!!!  Everyone (family and/or friends) enjoyed this dessert – the only complaint was that no one could get seconds.   I allow for seconds after I have cooked the dish for a first time.  That being said there will definitely be a next time as this dessert dish is going into the family’s meal rotation.

These have a fantastic flavor that pops!  I found that my pecans toasted in about 20 minutes, and the only change I made in the recipe was to use 1 egg and 1 egg white instead of 2 whole eggs.  I had extra batter after filling my 2 mini pans, so I additionally made 3 jumbo sized muffins.  I will make this version again!

I didn't have coconut extract, so I used half a can of coconut milk instead, and I substituted coconut oil for the butter. (Next time I'll cut back on that, as it seemed a little oily.) I reduced the sugar to 1 3/4 cups (for a double recipe) and toasted the pecans on the stovetop.  The result was delicious! It took a long time to cook, though. I baked it in muffin form, and when the muffins were still gooey inside after about 1/2 an hour in the oven, I turned up the heat to 350. It still took another 10-15 minutes before they were done. Next time I'll just use the higher temperature from the beginning.

This bread is delicious. However the 2 mini loaf pans were a little more than 3/4 full and during baking they spilled over and burned in my oven andI followed the directions with the exception of cutting the sugar down a bit  by using  1/3 cup brown sugar and 1/3 cup white sugar. It was still a little too sweet, probably because my bananas were very ripe.

I scaled down to 8 servings as we're a family of 2. I still used less sugar and less butter yet was still moist and tasty.  I added a cream cheese filling in the middle and it was to die for!  It was my first time making this.
