Wonderful light salad.  I was struggling to find a small side for a creamy (and rich) chestnut pasta dish.   This salad provided the perfect balance of fresh tartness withthe heavy cream sauce in the pasta.

I've got to say that I rarely review anything but this is a great use of summer cucumbers and what's more it's fresh and delicious. Love it!

I've been making this recipe that I got from my mother, for years and I'm 68. The only thing that she, and I do differently is I don't add the green peppers, and I slice my cucumbers and sweet onion into rounds.  Yes they did have bottled Italian dressing back then, (chuckle) Delicious.

Crunchy and light. Loved it but recommend 1 teaspoon or less of salt or non at all.

I left out the green pepper, salt and pepper. Used 1 cup seeded cucumber slices, 1 cup sliced  celery  ribs, 1 cup sliced mushrooms, 1 cup sliced tomatoes without the tomato jelly , and 1 cup sliced red onion. I also used Ken's lite Northern Italian dressing. It kept for 4 days in three refrigerator. I served it alone as a side, and over chopped Roman lettuce as a salad with a crumbled blue cheese topping. Very versital.

Followed exactly as written. I used a new italian dressing that I hadnt tried before and didnt care for it. Very tasty and easy to make. Paired well with the best lasagna (on AR). Will make again.

All I can say is yummy in my tummy! the only thing I did different was put celery salt in it, instead of celery.  my 4yr old son and husband absolutely loved it. Will most definitely be making again. Thank you for sharing your recipe??

Delicious!  I used a homemade Italian dressing and omitted most of the salt and pepper.  I made it a second time and added pasta, chunks of mozzarella cheese, and crushed red pepper.  It was the best pasta salad.  What a great recipe.

This was so easy and so good. I omitted the celery and added tomatoes to mine and it worked out great. It will be a great summer salad to go with pasta or burgers.

Both my spouse and I thought it was good, but needed something more.  Next time I will use less green pepper and add radishes.  May add some mushrooms and tomatoes also.  You can actually add any vegetable you want.  Great salad for dieters that are tired of lettuce.

I don't eat cucumbers but I made this for my family. They liked it and it was certainly easy to put together. Great way to use up cucumbers from the garden.

Very good.  My husband, who generally avoids cukes, especially loved this.  Will make again.
