I haven't made this version yet because I use my own family's recipe, but this is truly a great bread.  The braided shape is quite pretty and I've always gotten compliments when I've shared loaves with others.  I wouldn't reduce the size of the recipe either.  It takes a good amount of time, you'll be happy to have made two loaves.

it took a long time to make this bread.  No joke when they say an all day affair, but it was worth EVERY minute.  Not only was it amazingly delicious, it was beautiful!  Of course I adjusted the spices to suit my family's tastes, but other than that...PERFECT!!!

This is delicious! My husband, who does not care for cakes without cream at all, annihilated half of it. This cake would be one of my regular festive (and non-festive as well) cakes.

It was brilliant. I braided mine and took it to our company Christmas party. People liked it because of how the crumb was and it's not to sweet, but just sweet enough with a bit of butter. I'll make another one for myself tonight :-)

A delicious bread. I had to substitute nutmeg for the mace because I could not find it at the time I was making the bread. I will definitely make again this coming Christmas.
