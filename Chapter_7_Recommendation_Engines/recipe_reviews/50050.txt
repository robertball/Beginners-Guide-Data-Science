What a superbly easy and tasty recipe. We've made it over and over. One hint if you're using a blender instead of a food processor add half the cream to the blender first and then drop in the frozen berries while the blender is running. Add the remaining cream and sugar as called for. I don't have a f.p. and when I tried it the first time in my blender the berries kept getting stuck and the cream froze onto the berries. But I learned and I love the custardy ice cream. :)

This is so easy to make and so delicious and creamy. My mom, a dedicated chocoholic, thought it was wonderful. I used mixed berries (no frozen strawberries left by the time I went shopping) and it was delicious, if seeds bother you try another fruit. Am going to try with frozen peaches next time. If you don't have an ice cream maker and want to try home made ice cream, you have to try this. Two thumbs ups!

Holy cow! Is this GOOD! I doubled it, knowing that other reviewers had said that it makes such a small amount. We LOVE ice cream in this house and this is better than anything I've bought in the last ten years. Really creamy and rich tasting. I've made strawberry this time, but I plan on experimenting with fresh nectarines and peaches next. 

EDITED 06/12/08: I've made this with mandarin oranges AND bananas. Not quite as good as the strawberry. The mandarin oranges were drained really well, but still made this ice cream more "ice-crystal-ly." The banana was a more subtle flavor, and you really didn't need a whole lot of sugar with the bananas. I think I might try fresh nectarines next, then move back to berries. The whole family is still raving about the strawberry. 

EDITED 06/21/08: I made a triple batch of this today with blackberry, blueberry and strawberry. Delicious! 

EDITED YET AGAIN: I have now made this with FF half-n-half and half the amount of sweetener only using Splenda and still have it come out great. Good dessert for someone who is either diabetic and has to watch their sugars OR someone who's trying to lose weight but still have something sweet every once and a while.

Wow!  I love stawberry Ice Cream and this is wonderful!!!  Sooo easy to make.  One note...I reversed the order of ingredients that you put in the blender..I put part of the heavy cream first which made it much easier to blend the frozen strawberries.  This ice cream is very tatsy and it's made it into my family recipie book!

Pamela is a true GENIUS!  This recipe is amazing and so satisfying.  I used unsweetened frozen mixed berries for that is what I had on hand (I had to adjust the amount of sugar because the other berries in the mix tend to be a bit tart).  I also added around 1/4 tsp. of vanilla to give it that berries and cream taste ~ Heavenly.  A definite keeper in my recipe box.  Thank you for sharing this with us :-D

WOW!!! This is my new favorite recipe right now coming upon summer!!  I don't own an ice cream maker and saw a question posted on the AR exchange for this recipe.  It really only takes 5 MINUTES to make this!  I made two different flavors...strawberry and peach.  I have a mini 3 cup kitchen aid food processor and was concerned it might not work, but it did!  I had recently froze large fresh picked strawberries in the last 2 weeks.  My machine did chop the fruit fairly well...and the taste was soooo goood!  Some of my fruit was a bit icy.  You may want to blend longer if you want a smoother fruit texture.  It has a very cold, thick pudding-like consistency once blended..  After reading some other reviewers suggestions, I also froze for 30 minutes and even liked the texture of the ice cream more than after first blended.  NEXT time I will cut back on the sugar when I use really sweet strawberries.  My kids were fighting over the last bites!!

This is heavenly.  I used blueberries, but can't wait to try peaches.  Reminded me of old-fashioned ice cream shop creamy custard.   Word of caution: Don't make this when you are the only one home.  
Thank you Pamela.

Great recipe....who knew how easy this would be and tasty. I used a bag of frozen mixed berries, cut the sugar in half and used fat free half and half as suggested by Lorie. Results were perfect. My daughter really enjoyed this quick dessert. I really enjoyed the fact that is was semi-healthy unlike the real deal. Will make again and try different fruits! Thanks!

I'm on a low fat, low carb diet, so I had to change the ingedients. I thought this would be helpful to others.  This recipe is so adaptable.  I just made it in a Ninja with skim milk and Splenda.  It's OUTSTANDING!  I used over a cup of whoe frozen strawberries, 2/3 cup milk and 1/2 cup Splenda.  It came out the consistency of soft serve ice cream, which is how I like it.  (Because my Ninja has 2 levels of blades, I was able to put all the ingredients in at one time and everyghing blended together quickly.)

If I could give this recipe 10 stars I WOULD! So thankful I found this, I never knew ice cream could be so easy.  I have made this 3 times today, and 5 over the past week. Some flavors you should try: Mixed Fruit mint...pinapple, mango, strawberries peaches mix, and a handfullfresh mint with light cream and sugar fantastic! Blueberry peach mint frozen yogurt... 1.5 cup vanilla low fat yogurt and a frozen bag of each fruit, 1/8cup light cream and 1/2cup sugar so tasty Pear- 1 1lb jar of pears in light syrup drained and frozen, 1/4cup sugar and light cream...so refreshing!  Thanks again!

This was not what I was expecting at all. I thought I was making ice cream.  Turns out we made a smoothie that was way way to sweet and rich.  My husband makes "smoothies" all of the time.  He uses a small bag of frozen berries, 1 med to large frozen banana- 1% milk and splenda to taste.  Alot less calories and alot better for you.

This is a great recipe, but, I needed a less fattening version so this is what I did.  I used 10 of frozen blueberries, 1/2 c. splenda and 2/3 cup fat free half and half.  I put the fat free half and half in the measuring cup in the freezer for about 20 or 30 minutes until it starts to crystallize around the edges. Do this before you start the berries.  This comes out to about 76 calories per serving.

My husband LOVES this ice cream, he closes his eyes and says mmmm....the whole time eating it! I have become quite the 5 minute ice cream "expert"! Caribbean fruits can be very sweet so I cut down the sugar a lot. I just add to taste. I don't put the exact amount of cream, I may add more or less, depends on the amount of fruit I am using. I add slowly until it turns into a ball. Some fruits are more watery so sometimes that doesn't work but after a while you get the hang of it and can just eyeball the amount of cream you will use. I used heavy cream the first few times but it tasted too buttery so I switched to half and half as someone from the recipe exchange suggested. So far I have made mango, guava, papaya, cantaloupe and pina colada. I can't wait to try other fruits! Try it!
*UPDATE* Made it into a healthier version by omitting sugar and using KAL brand powder stevia instead. Also used half and half cream that had no hormones or antibiotics. It was equally delicious as before!

Holy  is this good! I didn't want to throw away the heavy cream that was about to go bad in my fridge and at the same time, I was having a sweets attack. This was wonderful and amazingly easy.  Probably not the most healthy, but without an ice cream maker and the need for some sweets, this was perfect! Thanks!

This is one of my favorite recipes!  It reminds me of the scoop of homemade ice cream I used to get from my favorite cafe back when I lived in Chicago.  Ever since I found this recipe I've been trying different flavors.  So far peach and apple are my favorites (if you try apple you need to up the cream or it will be grainy).  Some people mentioned that it doesn't freeze very well but I've also noticed that these are the same people that are substituting other dairy products for the cream.  Don't!  Cream freezes differently and anything other than cream will give you those ice crystals.  If you want it creamier just add more cream.  I usually add 3/4 to 1 cup cream per 10 ounces frozen fruit. (you have to use frozen fruit for this to work!) Different fruits will give different consistencies so it's all about experimenting.  Also, I can't see this working with a blender as it would take too long to get everything to mix and ruin the texture.  If you get a milkshake or smoothie consistency you've done something wrong.  I always freeze this several hours before eating as it is more like soft serve right out of the food processor.

I'd give this a 10 if I could. My husband didn't believe I made this. It was soooo good! I only used 1/4 c sugar with raspberries. It was delicious. He was still talking about it this morning!

Oh Happy Day!  This is wonderful!  I placed  it in the freezer and had a hard time waiting for it to firm up, since I kept taking a taste here, a taste there.  Gotta make sure it's good before I offer it up to guests, right?!  I wanted to share that I used nonfat plain yogurt in place of the heavy cream (and also added a splash of vanilla)and saved a lot of calories as a result.  Think I'll reduce the amount of sugar next time to see how that comes out. Wonderful recipe; thank you so much for posting it!

This was very good!  I read a lot of the reviews.  People were talking about the consistency being like a smoothie which mine was too.  I then had that important "A-Ha" moment...it is ice cream therefore it needs to freeze!  So, take your smoothie-like concoction and put it in the freezer.  Once it is frozen, you will not be disappointed!

Loved it! I used a bag of mixed berries since that is what I had on hand. This is only the 2nd time I have made ice cream and I will say that I much prefer this method. I borrowed my neighbors ice cream maker last week just to see what it was like to make ice cream. I found the process very long and told the kids that we were NOT buying an ice cream maker. After finding this recipe, I have no doubts that the decision was the right one. I can't wait to try different flavors with this method.

This was quick, easy, and it tasted great! My boyfriend and I made a ton of this for his aunt's baby shower and it was loved. He now tries to get me to make it ALL the time (then complains that I'm making him fat!). We tried it using the powder sugar that someone suggested and I found that it didn't taste as good. We also tried it with fresh strawberries and it froze a little funny and was very tart (even with the full amount of sugar - we added extra and it still didn't taste right). I say stick with this recipe AS IS!

This involved less effort than making a smoothie and was fun to make. I used some frozen mango along with the strawberries and it was excellent. Didn't want a partial carton of cream leftover so I used it all and adjusted the fruit and sugar accordingly.

I replaced half the cream with unsweetened greek yogurt.  I also cut the sugar in half.   This was a great recipe that has me thinking of freezing a different fruit every night this week!!!!

I'm giving this recipe a 5 star, it worked just like it said it would. And you can interchange the frozen fruit for others. I used raspberries. And even though it was decent, it was rather tart. My mistake and not the recipe. I also did it with Splenda, and it didn't sweeten it the way I thought, will use sugar next time, but however it is an excellent recipe and I am working on other frozen fruits to use. I very much like this recipe.

I have a 2 yr old son who LOVES fruit I always have several bags of frozen fruit on hand for snacks and various baking recipes. I used the rest of my bag of mixed berries ( alot of it was just little broken pieces) it had strawberries, black berries, blue berries, and raspberries. I already had the whipping cream and sugar on hand. I used my blender as I couldnt find the top to my food processor. I eye balled the measurements as I didnt know how much fruit I had. My son looved it and hubby did too I let it freeze for a few hours, and we had it for dessert. I thought it tasted like one of those cartoon head shaped bars from the icecream man. Hubby says it tasted like sherbert I wasnt crazy about the seeds but hubby and son didnt mind them. 
I cut up some canned peaches and froze them on a tray yesterday so this morning I tried peach soo smooth and creamy in comparison to the berry one ( couldnt get the berries smooth no matter how hard i tried!) my son has had 3 little one scoop bowls already! I snuck some raw baby spinach into the berry one for an added vitamin boost and no one could tell !!! I will be using this for an icecream cake next i think. 
Make boxed cake ( any flavor) according to package, cool completely then chill in the fridge overnight, prepare 2 batches of icecream and spread over cake in a pan then freeze top with coolwhip and cut fruit then freeze again untill just before serving...

This was easy and tasted great. I used fat free half & half, just to take most of the guilt out of eating it, and nobody noticed.

This is the tastiest ice cream ever. Better than any brand name. We used whole frozen strawberries because we didn't have sliced ones. We didn't have any heavy cream so used Half and Half with a couple tablespoons of plain yogurt. Y roommate hates yogurt and still found it heavenly! It was  prepared, in bowls, and in the freezer in 5 minutes. The only bad thing I can say is that it only makes 2 small bowls. You'll definitely want  more! Thanks for the recipe! I'll never have to buy the chemical-filled junk from the store again.

Love, love, love this! I made two batches, one with strawberries, and one with mangoes. They were both deliciously creamy; I can't choose which one I liked better! Both frozen fruits came in a 12oz size so I just used it all. I also only added a slightly rounded 1/4 c sugar for each batch and felt they were both plenty sweet so I will continue to use the less sugar amount. **UPDATE** I have made this many times now, mostly with mangoes. I now use plain nonfat yogurt, and only about 2 TBS of sugar. Still very delicious. I use the cream version for a special treat! Also, I only make it in my food processor; there is NO WAY my blender would be able to get it to the right consistency without it being to soft.

Such an innovative recipe. :) I froze 2 vanilla pudding cups (the single-serving 'Snack Pack' type) and used those instead of fruit to make vanilla ice cream...also I used 1/3 c. cream. Very simple. Thanks! :)

this deserve 5 star just for how simple it seems and how yummy it sounds.  I haven't tried it but I'm definitely going to write it on my shopping list. 
***Update***
I've made this ice cream and it's official: I will never buy ice cream from the store ever again.  I made this with frozen raspberries and I only have one word say, WOW! I've also made it with frozen peaches and coconut milk and my husband said the same thing I said, never buy store bought ice cream again, just make this.

This was very good. I made it with fat free half'n half. I only used 1/2 the sugar and it was sweet enough. I used fresh picked red raspberries. I agree with the other reviewers who said it was more like a sorbet than an ice cream. Still very good. I think I'll use more half'n half next time to make it more creamy. I will definitely make this again so I can try other flavors. UPDATE: I made this again and used almost 1 cup of fat free half'n half. This made it a little creamier. I also used frozen canned peaches and 1/2 the sugar. It was perfect, but I still had to freeze it to get it to the consistency of ice cream. Now I give it 5 stars!

5 stars for a SUPER EASY recipe.  However, based on flavor I would say a 4.  Made the recipe twice - first with the blender - second with the food processor.  I STRONGLY RECOMMEND USING THE FOOD PROCESSOR.  The strawberries get stuck in the blender - and you the results aren't as good as the food processor (blender created a smoothie like consistency).  If you want strawberry pieces in your ice cream just combine the sugar and strawberries in the processor while it is off... start slowly pouring the cream - THEN turn on the processor.  Otherwise the consistency will be very smooth.  Made 6 servings instead of 4 - so I used 1 pound whole frozen unsweetened strawberries that I roughly chopped (recipe called for sliced) - 1 generous cup cream and 2/3 cup sugar.  It was very very sweet - next time I will cut back the sugar a little.  Otherwise, it was a great quick fix recipe my family enjoyed!  **UPDATE 06/29**  I've made this a couple times and everyone seems to love it!  I use less sugar when making strawberry though.  I tried this with fresh very ripe mangoes (cut up and freeze before making).  My husband devoured it!  So this recipe is very easy to adapt to other fruits, as desired.

This simple ice cream recipe was fabulous!  I wanted to get rid of my ever-growing collection of over-ripe bananas in my freezer, and this did well!  I ended up using two frozen bananas in place of the strawberries, but I recommend weighing out your appropriate amount with a kitchen scale.  The bananas don't need as much sugar as the strawberries since they are a sweeter fruit.  I cut the sugar in half but I could have done with less -- it was Very rich.  Delicious recipe!

Incredibly tasty but a bit grainy from the sugar.  Might try heating the sugar in the cream to get it to dissolve and then adding to the fruit and freezing.  I know it'll change the name from 5 minute to 2 hour ice cream but the taste was great so I'm willing to give it a try.  Thanks Pamela

YUM!  This was probably the best strawberry ice cream I have ever tasted!  One word of caution - I used a blender to make this and it took forever to properly chop the strawberries.  Maybe I just have a stinky blender, but I think a food processor is probably a lot easier to use...just wish I had one!

I cut the sugar down to less than 1/4 a cup because I was using my own frozen berries and I already knew they were quite sweet. I used amaretto flavored creamer as that was all I had on hand, and it turned out wonderful. The amaretto creamer really gave it a more complex flavor. Very easy recipe - will definitely make this again!

This is a great recipe, but I used my Vita Mix instead of a blender. Usually when I make a new recipe  I make it exactly as is called for. But the second time I made it, I put the cream and sugar in first and blended it well before I added the frozen fruit.  This made a huge difference, proving once again there is nothing better than homemade ice cream!

There are very few OMG recipes, and this is one of them.  I did this recipe three ways 1)with cream just as the recipe calls for, 2) with milk instead of cream, and 3) only with the berries partially melted.  All three were fabulous, and we may have liked the one with only the berries and the one with milk the best.  It actually tastes more like sorbet.  I was also surprised how well it scooped after being stored in the freezer.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

I thought this was AMAZING & I'm not usually a fan of strawberry ice cream.  I had an extra lb of fresh strawberries so I sliced them, added 1/3 c. sugar & let them juice for a while before I put them in the freezer overnight.  It still needed 2 tbsp of sugar when I tasted it at soft serve consistency. (probably because of the fresh berries)  If you stir it during freezing, about every 45 min or so, it won't crystalize on you & I liked the flavor better when it was firmer.  I'm trying frozen bananas & choc. chunks next time!  Thanks for an amazing & quick dessert, much easier than my ice cream maker :o)

This was a very good recipe. I liked it better right after it was made, but after freezing for later it was a little icy. Tasty, though. Edit - 6/11/12 - I made this again yesterday to accompany a strawberry cake and it was just so good.  This is absolutely one of the quickest, simplest  recipes you'll ever come across. It's also a great way to use those garden berries. I can't wait to make this again soon.

EXCELLENT! I think the problems people are having with this recipe relate to the amount of berries they are using. Use a 16 oz bag of strawberries/berries. Also, it needs to be made in a powerful food processor - NOT a blender. I got excellent results on the first try! I've even brought the ingredients and my food processor to a friends' dinner party to make it as dessert. It's quick, easy, and SUPER tasty! FIVE STARS!

The taste is nice, but if you freeze the ice cream, the texture becomes rough because of ice crystals.

Quick and easy - I made this along with a plain cheese cake and it was wonderful. I added a little Amaretto liquor the second time around and it was wonderful. A quick and easy way to satisfy your sweet tooth. Thumbs Up !

This was so easy!  I just have a small food processor but made the full recipe.  Enough for me and my husband.  Taste Great and I used the Splenda.  Have given out the recipe to friends already and I just made it yesterday.  Thanks for a quick, easy and delisious recipe.  Can't wait to try frozen peaches.

OH MY GOSH!!!!  I made this for Memorial Day; couldn't find any frozen strawberries at the store so I used frozen peaches.  It tasted just like a name-brand peach ice cream.  It was awesome!  I will definitely be making this again.  It was so easy!!!  I can't wait to try other fruits in it and see how it turns out.  This will become a new favorite at my house!

This is great. I'm allergic to gums in normal ice cream. So now I can have ice cream again.  I also have a daughter with a milk allergy and used non-dairy creamer? made of nuts and it worked pretty well also.  Thank you for this recipe soooo much!

Okay - I saw this on AR as the recipe of the day today.  I never knew I could make ice cream without an ice cream maker!  This took about 5 minutes to make . . . and it is WONDERFUL.  I used raspberries.  Followed the directions to a "t", and it was like pure raspberry soft serve heaven.  I had to stop myself from eating the whole batch. Popped the rest in the freezer for later.  Can't wait to try this with other flavors.  THANK YOU!

In taste I would probably give this a 5.  Who doesn't like strawberries, sugar, and heavy cream? But, the texture was liquidy and more of a milkshake and not ice-cream.  It did to take the same amount of time as making a smoothie, which is just good but a lot healthier.  I did however, put it in the freezer and after 24hrs it did freeze up.  After freezing, it was like an icy strawberry & cream ice cream.

This is SO delicious and so easy!  So far I have made peach, blueberry, watermelon, and banana.  Can't wait to try more flavors!  I've tried both the blender and food processor and DEFINITELY use a food processor if you have one, it turns out a much better consistency.

MMMMMMMM! So yummy. This was simple to make and turned out super good. It reminded me of strawberry and cream flavored candy. Mine was more like a milk shake so I stuck it in the freezer for an hour..... Perfect! Another great tip, if you have a magic bullet mixer you can make everyone a different flavor in a snap! We did peach, strawberry, and blueberry in less than 15 minutes!

This is unbelievable!  I am amazed that something so good can come from these three ordinary ingredients and a food processor in five minutes... but it's true!  We loved this.  I didn't use all the sugar and used evaporated milk, just because that is what I had on hand.  I will probably make this again & again (& again & again...).  Thanks for the recipe!

Made this tonight with frozen banana's, chocolate chips, and chopped walnuts and it tasted exactly like Ben and Jerry's Chunky Monkey!!  Like other reviewers, I think 1/2 c. of sugar is too much.  I only used 1/3 c. and it was still a bit too sweet.  Maybe next time I'll only use 1/4 c.  Anyway, I will definitely be making this again!!

I'm giving this a 2 for now simply because I didn't use strawberries I used blueberries. I'm giving this a 2 because it was WAY to sweet. I read many reviews and saw that alot of people were having issues with the gridyness from the sugar so I disolved the sugar in the milk before adding together. I also put a little blueberries and milk in the blender to help it blend better. I came out nice but liquidy so I froze it for a few hours then it was fine. Not very griddy at all so not sure if putting the sugar in the milk first helped. My 4yr old LOVES blueberries and would only eat them if I let her, she didn't want the ice cream said it was too sweet. I will try again though with strawberries next time and melt the sugar again. I think maybe its just the type of fruit added that the sugar needs to be adjusted accordingly. Oh after freezing over night it still wasn't rock hard so thats nice, I hate nothing more then rock hard ice cream. Thanks for sharing. :)

Wow! Thankfully I just happened to have some cream and a bag of old 'not too pretty' strawberries in the freezer. I used Splenda instead of sugar and it was still good! Looking forward to transforming those old bananas I have waiting in the freezer.

I wouldn't call it ice cream...  It was really good though.  I wasn't sure my blender would live through it.  Will make again.  Update - I have since (a month or so since my initial post) purchased a food processor and I must say it has enhanced this recipe tremendously!!  I do add a lot more cream to make it more like ice cream.  I make a lot at a time and keep it in the freezer.

I'm writing this review as I eat this. I used low fat strawberry yogurt in place of the cream to make this a healthier frozen yogurt version, and added less thana half cup of sugar. Thanks for the great recipe!

I hate to be one of those that rates recipes based on changes, as I did change 2/3 of the ingredients.  I'm sure the original is awesome and do plan to make it that way - but I think this deserves 5 stars for the brilliance and ease of the recipe.  Never thought making ice cream could be so easy.  I replaced the cream with vanilla yogurt and left out the sugar completely, as I used sweetened sliced strawberries. So, thanks for the recipe idea!  I doubled the recipe and used my blender.  It was a little difficult at first to get it to blend, but I mushed the stuff around and it eventually caught on and blended nicely.

Couldn't believe how well this worked and how fabulous it tasted!  I used Splenda and it came out perfect.  I made the strawberry and even my kids (who don't like strawberry ice cream) gobbled it up.

Just made this recipe with red raspberries and it was delish! Next time will probably cut back on the sugar a bit. Ate some right out of the food processor and put the rest in the freezer. I'm hoping that, with a bit of time in the freezer, some of the grittyness from the sugar will disappear

It was so nice to have an ice cream recipe that I could make without an ice cream maker.  I also love how versatile it is. I am in the process of trying this recipe over and over again with different fruits. So far I changed the recipe to use peaches, I subbed brown sugar instead of white sugar and after it was blended I spooned in chopped pecans. WONDERFUL! I normally don’t like to rate recipes when I make lots of edits but I am giving this recipe 5 stars because not many recipes get me this excited to try it over and over again for the variations.

OHHHH MYYYYY GOODNESS!! This is absolutely delicious! I used a 16 oz bag of frozen unsweetened peaches, subbed Splenda for the sugar and fat free half & half for the cream! I froze it for 90 mins., I think the half & half made it a little softer than the heavy cream would have. These alterations make it a very low cal/fat recipe with wonderful rich results. My sons were amazed & asked me to make it again tomorrow. Thank you soooo much!!!

I though whole milk was cream, and forgot to freeze the strawberrys, so when I used it, the whole thing became a smoothie, so I froze it. It became a frozen strawberry ice block, but it was still delisious. I'm going to try again tomorrow with rasberrys!

Simple and delicious. I love that it's only 3 ingredients. I made it in my new food processor and put it in a container to put in the freezer to firm up a bit. I actually have an ice cream maker, but this is the best way to make strawberry ice cream.

I was extremely pleased with how easy this ice cream was to make and how delicious it turned out! I have been using this site for quite some time, and finally decided that this recipe deserves my first review, because after making it I felt like I just had to share how great it is. I halved the recipe as I have a small food processor and it was just enough for myself and my boyfriend. I did let it freeze for a while as it looked runny at first and then used an ice cream scoop for nicer presentation. It was a much better texture after freezing, and the little pieces of strawberry made it feel like old-fashioned homestyle ice cream! We have been trying to eat a little healthier but my boyfriend is a die-hard ice cream fan, so I look forward to adapting this recipe with non-sugar sweeteners, different types of fruit, etc. for a healthier but still fantastically creamy and flavorful dessert. Thanks so much for sharing!

I changed the sugar to splenda and change the cream to almond milk, and used unsweetened strawberries.  I didn't need an entire 1/2 cup of sugar.  Start with 1/4 and taste and add as needed.  I think I will try frozen bananas with the strawberries next time.

Amazing. From all the positive reviews I knew this would work, but wow it's got an amazing creamy texture that's out of this world. I subbed unsweetened frozen raspberries, delicious. I think the listed proportions of ingredients are ideal, I added vanilla extract for preference but that's really not needed. I think there are closer to two, maybe three servings. This seems like an awesome recipe to make with kids. I will absolutely make this again, thanks so much for sharing!

It tasted really well, but the consistancy fell apart very fast. It went from being awesome, smooth and creamy to almost entirely melted in very short order. I will probably still make it again, though. Very tastey.

Outstanding recipe fast and easy . I made the exact recipe and it is great! Freezes nicely. I cut the recipe down to make just single servings using my bullet. I have also used the food processor it works great. Haven't tried the blender. So far I have chopped and frozen mangos, peaches, raspberries, blackberries, huckleberries, and made this recipe and they were all delish!  As Rachel would say - Yum-O. When I make the recipe using peaches I add a little pure vanilla extract now. I even tried plain vanilla and it was pretty good.

Great idea. I will have to mess with it a bit because mine didn't come out like ice cream, more like thick smoothie. I think I know where I went wrong but it was still difficult.

We are calling this Miracle Ice Cream in my house! It was ready, not in five, but 2 minutes. We can't wait to try it with other frozen fruit as well.  I used 1/3 cup of sugar and that seemed to do the trick.  This recipe will become our go-to ice cream recipe.  Thanks so much for posting it.

I made this recipe and followed the directions exactly as written and it worked beautifully and tasted delicious! After tasting it I made another recipe of it as I knew I would be needing more!  I used my food processor and I would recommend you make only one recipe at a time.   This is a genius recipe and a definite winner!

WOW!!! after reading all the reviews I couldn't wait to try this. I used frozen pinapple,strawberry,peach&mango as that was what I had on hand. I didn't have any heavy cream so I used regular 2% milk and a little less sugar. The consistancy was perfect. I made it in my 3 cup food proccessor. Can't wait to make this with my grandaughter! I will make this again and again....THE BEST EVER

This is really yummy! I knew not to expect creamy, store bought ice cream texture, but honestly, this wasn't bad! I guessed on the amount of fruit- the 10 ounces, because I had a GIANT bag of frozen fruit. I used a mix of frozen strawberries, blueberries, raspberries and blackberries. The seeds dont bother me, and kindof give it a rustic, natural, authentic element. My ratios were off though measurement wise, because it was very difficult to blend. However, I added a touch of milk to smooth it out and get it all to blend. I will say, the sugar is way too much for me personally. It makes the ice cream overly sweet, when the fruit I had was already really sweet. I will cut it in half next time probably. However, for a quick 5-minute ice cream I can make with my 3 year old, this was a winner! I froze a good amount of it, and am looking forward to seeing how it tightens up once it's frozen. It was pretty soft upon making it. Great, thanks for sharing. I am sure I will use this over and over again with my kids!

Super simple.  I had heavy cream left over from making a soup, and I had the frozen strawberries and sugar on hand.  My family loved it.  As I read in the last rating, I also could've used a tad more sugar.

I was looking for a way to use up over-ripe strawberries and came across this recipe. This was quick and easy and turned out great.  I had buttermilk and half & half on hand so I used those in place of the heavy cream and cut the sugar in half.  I could have put in a bit more sugar, but my kids loved it as is!

great quick dessert, creamy and flavoursome. I used caster sugar, as frozen berries can be a little tart. I also tried 1/2frozen cherries, 1/2 frozen raspberries, and this was a most delicious combination! Thank you for this wonderful recipe..

This was really delicious!  I used blueberries and half & half.  Next time, I think I might try a little less sugar because I just don't think it needs quite as much as is called for.  The blueberries were nice and small, so the blender handled them with no problem.  I did need to add a few extra to make the ice cream thick, but that only made it better.  My husband and 2 girls loved this too.  We're always glad to find healthful desserts that we all enjoy.  Thank you!

Definitely giving this a five because my husband and I were amazed that three ingredients can make delicious ice cream so quickly! Next time I would reduce the sugar, however, as it's a tad overly sweet.  I made it in my blender, and I had to freeze it several hours to get it firm, but that's okay... even if it is hard to wait! Cant wait to try this with other fruits and flavorings.  Thanks so much for the great recipe! UPDATE: Loved this so much that I've tried it again within a week, but this time we used frozen pineapple. Great flavor (reminds me of Dole Whip from Disney World), though it's a more pulpy fruit so you get bits of it in the ice cream.  Really good and refreshing, anyway!

I've made this twice now, both times w/ 1/2 and 1/2.  I can't wait to try the yogurt/lower fat versions.  It was a great last minute new dessert for supper but really only one of my children will get it out of the freezer to eat the leftovers.  Second time I didn't food process the fruit long enough and there were chunks which was not as appealing.  The fruit was also more frozen the second time (since it hadn't just come from the trip out of the grocery store) and the ice cream was thicker because of it.  fast, fun recipe

This is an amazing recipe! Why? It is SO quick, easy, and delicious. Also, the main ingredient is strawberries, which makes me feel better about its healthiness. This was a hit tonight. We topped with a little whipped cream and chopped pecans. I never got it to firm up like in the picture even though I kept adding more and more strawberries. Next time I'll probably leave in the freezer for a little while before serving.

GREAT for a last minute cold dessert!  I didn't have heavy cream so I used some of my french vanilla half and half.  Worked nicely... throw in a dark chocolate hershey's bar at the end! YUMMMM!

This as written is very simple and easy to make, but it also has a very simple taste. I does taste a lot like coolwhip, not icecream. Perhaps I should have used a better vanilla. My son loves icecream, so he ate it. But I and my hubby did not enjoy it. I may try to make it again with the Ovaltine as mentioned by another user.

I've been using this recipe for years.  I first learned to use bananas that were sliced and frozen.  You can even add chocolate syrup when you add the cream.  We often make milkshakes with this recipe using plain 2% milk.

Excellent recipe. Hubby said it tasted like the DQ strawberry and vanilla oreo blizzard (without the oreos). I'm going to explore other options, including other types of milk and less sugar. Per other reviews, I did freeze it for an hour. May try longer next time.

Brilliant, and so easy!!  I only spotted this recipe a couple of days ago and already I have tried several variations - replacing part of the cream with milk or all of it with buttermilk for a lower-fat version (which I actually preferred).  Great recipe!

OMG - fantastic!  Best dessert I have made in a while and probably some of the best ice cream I have ever eaten - and believe me I have eaten a lot.  Only change I made was to sub Splenda for Sugar.  Got rave reviews.  I will make this again with other fruits.  Hubby wanted a second batch last night!

Mmmmmm - Awesome!!!  I used a bag of frozen blackberries, and this ice cream was beyond delicious.  The longer it sits in the freezer, the thicker it becomes.  I had a hard time blending the berries in the blender, so I dug out my mini food processer.  Doing a handful of berries at a time worked well.  Then blend the rest of the ingredients together in the blender.  I can't imagine any fruit not tasting great with this recipe.

Awesome! I just whipped this up in less than 5 minutes.  Now it is time to get creative with different flavors!  The only change I made was adding only about 1/3 cup.  It was still sweet, but next time I will use agave nectar.

Very good. Soft but good! I cut down on the sugar and used 12 oz. organic strawberries (whole, but it still worked), a half-pint of organic cream, and a small bit of vanilla. I love the ideas using half-and-half ~ I will try that next, and try last summer's frozen peaches!

I wish I would have found and tried this recipe BEFORE I bought an 80$ icecream maker. THIS recipe is great! We've made strawberry, blueberry, and peach icecream... each time it's great! And the best part is: we use Splenda instead of sugar and it's GREAT!!!

Can't beat this idea for fast and easy.

Today I used :

1-12oz. bag of mixed berries

1-8 oz.  "fit&active" brand CHERRIES JUBILEE YOUGURT (non-fat) 

1/2 bowl of Strawberry Cool Whip

Yum! Loved the consistency and the flavor!

Thanks for a great idea!

I made a fig version. I cut fresh figs into chunks and froze them overnight. I used honey for the sweetener and added vanilla extract. It turned out heavenly! I will make it with milk instead of cream next time. It is very, very rich. This is a great recipe for someone who doesn't have the space for an ice cream maker.

Wow.  We loved this recipe.  I doubled the recipe and upped the strawberries (had to guess at the amount since my strawberries were in a 5 lb bag from Sam's!).  I used around 7 cups of stawberries, about a cup of vanilla sugar, and about 2 cups of cream.  Processed all for a few minutes and then froze for a a couple of hours.  It was perfect for us and definitely a keeper.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very nice. I used fresh strawberries that I froze instead of packaged frozen strawberries. Kind of reminded me of the strawberry smoothie from Dairy Queen. I think I will try it with frozen peaches next.

I don't have an ice-cream maker, so I never thought I could make homemade ice-cream.  This was similar to a softserve.  My husband who only likes chocolate ice-cream even enjoyed this.

This turned out differently than expected, but I'm sure it was something I did. It was really thin, so we just drank it. It tasted great, though, so I'll just keep tinkering with it until I get it right. Great, easy recipe!

THIS WAS SO GOOD AND SO EASY!  I used mixed berries, and I did need to add a little cream while chopping them.  It turns out more like a really soft custard than ice cream, and freezes like a rock, but the taste is just exquisite.  Pamela, YOU'RE AWESOME!!!!

So simple. So fresh. Works with all kinds of frozen fruit. You can sub honey or Splenda for the sugar, too.  I'm going to try a version with coconut milk instead of cream for my vegan sister this summer.

Just made up a batch of this ice cream for the first time, with no variance on the ingredients - wow, was it delicious and SOOO easy. The only reservation is that it is a little too sweet due to the amount of sugar called for - next time, I'll cut it down, perhaps in half. Otherwise, fabulous - this is going to be a keeper in my household!

Easy Ice Cream YUM! This recipe is so easy with an excellent outcome. I used fresh pitted cherries and scraped the specks out of a vanilla bean for Cherry Vanilla Ice Cream. We had chocolate sauce on it as well. Super! Thanks Pamela

I actually feel terrible rating this recipe so low however it was not good at all..I was thinking it's only three ingredients, how can you mess it up? I made it exact and it was a wierd texture and a milkshake-i also put it in the freezer for about an hour and it froze solid-almost everyone who rated it rated it fantastic so maybe we will try again...maybe not.

Seriously worth the 5 minutes.  I made strawberry-basil ice cream.  I thawed out fresh frozen strawberries, added 5 leaves of fresh basil, 1/2 lemon juiced and blended it all in a BULLET with cream.  Made 2 batches and put it all in the freezer for later.  Did it once before and it turned out GREAT.

I had 16oz pkg frozen strawberries, used low fat vanilla yogurt and added 1/2 c (for extra strawberries), 1/2 c splenda, added 2 bananas (one frozen) came out VERY creamy and yummy and healthy!!!  If you really like strawberry flavor only use 1 banana, hubby liked both ways.  Looking forward to having on a hot summer night!!! Thank you for great idea.

This is quick and yummy, without all the additives in most commercial ice creams.  I added a touch of vanilla.  I will adapt this recipe for other flavors and fruits.

It was delicious and creamy...everyone loved it. It was also really easy. But I think either you forgot or you make it differently but it needs about 10 minutes of freezing. Just remember to do that after you make it. Other than that it was great. Thank you!

I guess I'm in the minority here, but this gets a thumbs-down from me. :( To be fair, I did substitute frozen, sliced peaches for strawberries. My grocer only had frozen whole strawberries available (or sweetened sliced ones) and I was afraid my blender wouldn't be able to break them up without damaging the appliance. Perhaps the amount of sugar called for would have been perfect for strawberries, but it was WAAAY overkill for peaches. To boot, my ice cream was grainy (due to the sugar) and VERY soft set straight out of the blender. After freezing for an hour or so, it was much better but even so, it was still too sweet for my liking. I was very surprised to find that this was not creamy like true ice cream should be nor was it scoopable today (after a day in the fridge, my ice cream was ROCK hard - I nearly broke my ice cream scoop trying to dish it up!). I may attempt this again when my grocer has sliced strawberries in stock, but am in no hurry to do so in the foreseeable future. Thanks anyways, Pamela. :-)

I used frozen blackberries instead of strawberries and it was really good. Could use just about any type of frozen fruit. So easy too!

Yummy!!  My whole family loved it.  This would be very versatile with other fruits or to add other fruits to it as well.  I think next time I will cut back on the sugar.

I don't have a food processor, so I made these with a blender.  I found that I needed to freeze the mixture for about 2 hrs and stir every 30min to get the right consistency, but it was sooooooo good!

This is a very versatile and delicious recipe with what seems like unlimited possibilities in the fruit you can use. The only change I make is to use  sugar substitute (one that measure cup for cup like sugar) instead of sugar. I don't have to watch my sugar for any other reason than that I am losing weight and sugar is my enemy...of course there is the cream...but some things are just not negotiable! Excellent recipe.

I wish I'd read Jasinski's review earlier! I definitely had issues with my berries getting stuck in the blender. I had to use some milk to get them unstuck, and so my final product was more of a milkshake. Tasted great, though. ;)

This is so simple and delicious! I can't believe it only requires 3 ingredients and 5 minutes! It definitely tastes more natural than strawberry ice cream. I will be trying this a lot more often with different frozen fruits. I kept it in the freezer overnight because my husband loves hard ice cream. I could've eaten it right away though.

wow what a great recipe! I've made this 4 times already. I haven't tried the strawberry like it asked for, but I have tried other variations. I made raspberry, mixed berry, peach, and raspberry-peach. My favorite so far is the mixed berry. I would love to try mango and cherry next(:

Pretty good for a super easy dessert! I used vanilla flavored soy milk instead of cream.  Used blueberries since that's what I had but will definitely try it again with other fruits.

Not bad for being so easy!! I played with the recipe a little and took suggestions here and there. It does turn out soft, but it is fine if you freeze it longer. I'd try it again with different fruits when it gets hot again!

The flavor is great, the texture is not as great.  I would say that buying ice cream is cheaper already made, although a little less novell...  it would be worth it if I had frozen fruit from my own fruit trees and a cow that produced cream.  by the way, I used a tropical bag of fruit with mangos and strawberries.

This was very yummy and a huge hit with my informal dinner party. Our guests asked for the recipe so she could make it at home and my (often picky) husband loved it.  I rated it at five stars because it was easy to make, we loved it, and I think most people who try it would enjoy it as well. However, I do have a couple things to note. First of all, I found the finished product was MUCH too runny to serve immediately. I used a not super powerful blender which contributed, I'm sure, as well as using strawberries that weren't 100% frozen since I they had been frozen whole and I had to take the time to slice them. My finished product was a runny milkshake consistency and didn't even resemble a solid. After sitting in a deep freezer for about 3 hours, it was sufficiently frozen around the edges but still somewhat runny in the center. Still delicious, though!  Secondly, the finished product was sweeter and creamier than I liked. Next time I think I would try 1/3 cup sugar and maybe 1/2 cup cream (I used whipping cream, 33% MF) with milk topping up to 2/3 cup. I anticipate that will still be sweeter and creamier than needed, but I would rather slowly step it down than make a flop.  Also, I added 1/4 tsp vanilla as a previous reviewer recommended and I'm glad I did.  Overall, we really enjoyed this recipe and I will definitely be trying it again. I look forward to experimenting with different flavours!

Definitely take the advice of the reviewer Janinski if you are using a blender. I was skeptical if this would even work without going in the ice cream freezer, but it did. It was creamy and yummy...the perfect treat we were looking for! UPDATE: I used yogurt, like one reviewer suggested, and it was just as creamy and delish. I also added milk for an awesome (healthy!) smoothie for my 1 year old. He couldn't get enough of it! He doesn't usually like yogurt, but loves strawberries, so there ya go.

I thought I was so creative and ingenious to come up with this idea and then I found this recipe today!  Ha ha!!  I didn't even know there was a recipe for this.  I have been doing this sort of "quick" ice cream for years!  I love to make ice cream like this!!  You can use all sorts of combinations...peaches, other types of berries, bananas, and the list goes on....Sometimes if I don't have whipping cream, I use cool whip.  Very good with sugar free cool whip for those who have diabetes!!  I made it for my diabetic sis all the time when she lived by me!!  YUM!!!

This was great.  I had reservations... How can this be that good when it seems like people labor over making icecream... I have to say, I made it using the regular recipe which was good... Then I tried this - same amt of frozen strawberries and sugar and then I added a six oz container of Chobani 0% fat strawberry yogurt and just enough heavy cream to make it smooth (about 1/4 C).  I LOVED this.  You can even cut back on the sugar a little.  I am not sure if you even need heavy cream... maybe some soy or 1% milk would work, b/c the amt is negligable.  It was delicious.

This was a delicious recipe. Very easy and tastes just like ice cream. The consistancy is between a shake and soft serve. I also used soy milk because I have a milk allergy and you wouldn't be able to tell the difference.  Cream maybe would have made it thicker, but I'll try using soy cream next time to see.  Try this and enjoy!!!

AMAZING!  I've made this with frozen packaged fruit and fresh fruit I froze myself.  I've also substituted half-and-half or whole milk for the cream.  Any way you make it - it's unbeliveably good!  Just make sure if you freeze the fruit yourself you dice it, or you'll overtax your blender!

We made this with no fat vanilla yogurt, about 1/2 c of whey low sugar and frozen strawaberries.  The berries were whole and not chopping easy in the food processor so microwaved then for 30 seconds.  Worked fine.  This made a really good and healthy frozen yogurt.

This was heavenly! Who knew it was that easy to make ice cream. It is so soft and creamy. I burnt out my smoothie maker while making a quadruple batch. I will use my food processor next time. I added everything together at the same time and it tasted wonderful. I sliced and froze my fresh strawberries. Now I have to go picking again to freeze more!

This was surprisingly good.  I was skeptical because there were so few ingredients, I didn't think it would taste remotely like ice cream.  Boy, was I wrong!  Very creamy, almost like gelato.  I tripled the recipe and used frozen blueberries.  Rave reviews!

Amazing!  I used fresh strawberries that were hand-picked at a farm.  We had so many I had to find recipes to use them all.  This recipe was easy and it really did take only a few minutes to prepare.  My family and I loved it!

Wow, just saw this recommended on the Recipe Exchange so I went out in the kitchen and made it.  I used Splenda and skim milk and it's very, very tasty.  I had frozen bulk unsweetened strawberries (from Sam's Club) and used a little over 1 cup of berries to the other ingredients.  I don't think I'll buy ice-cream again since I've found this recipe.  Thank you so much.  I can see freezing peaches and making this too, and triple-berry, etc.  Great little recipe.  Thanks again.  *** UPDATE 8/12/10 ****  I just made this with fresh peaches that I froze.  It tastes better than any kind of icecream I can think of!  I use the Splenda and skim milk and it's just perfect!!

I made this a few days ago using strawberries and after reading the reviews about being too sweet I cut back on the sugar,that's a mistake,next time I will use the amount called for in the recipe.This does make a fantastic dessert,will make it more in the warmer weather and try different fruit.

I made this for the kids and call it "Fruitliscious Breakfast Ice Cream" but completely omitted the sugar and used 2/3 c. fat free milk and it was perfect for us, without the fat and extra sugar.  I froze the leftover ice cream in small individual containers and thawed slightly the next day and they were excited again to have ice cream at breakfast in their own containers! Excellent, easy and now healthy!  I too made it in a blender, which is a bit difficult, but doable.

If you have a good heavy duty blender, use a few ice cubes to upp the volume. You can all sorts of quick "ice creams" use frozen banana slices (slice and freeze openly in your freezer) and omitt the cream. Add a cup of fresh spinach to get some vitamins too, you won't taste it but makes it go green! I also like to sweeten with agave or honey or maple syrup.  If you want it to be VERY thick add some xantham gum (1/2tsp when doing 4 servings) it will thicken your ice smoothie a lot!  You can experiment with any frozen fruit and add whatever you like, vanilla is always good!

This is pretty great. I used up my leftover half and half and frozen strawberries - even added a little vanilla coffee creamer b/c I did not have quite enough half and half. I used less than half the sugar and it is PERFECT. This is dangerous! I can't wait to try other combos.

What a great and easy recipe. I used frozen peaches and it was so good. I needed to use some cream that I had and then had to go buy more to make more ice cream.  It is that good. It is yummy with frozen or semi-frozen bananas too. They make it a yucky color but tastes great.  It stores very well.  I double the recipe for 6 people in my family.  Thanks so much for the submission!

WOW!  This was SO good!  I didn't have any heavy cream on hand, so I used half and half and it still came out nice and creamy.  I put it in the freezer for about 45 minutes after blending, but then couldn't stand waiting any longer, so I went ahead and ate it custard style instead of hard-frozen.  It was a little sweeter than I prefer, so next time I'll probably reduce the sugar a bit.  Otherwise, YUM!  I can't wait to try it with other kinds of frozen fruit!

Fabulous! I cut down on the sugar just a bit and use whole milk in place of cream. I like frozen mixed berries best.  I have a fancy ice cream maker that does not require ice, but this is faster for fruity ice cream.  Love it.

Delicious! We used part plain yogurt and part milk in place of the cream (it was what we had on hand). This made it a little too sweet. Will use same ingredients, but less sugar next time. (maybe half as much).

LOVE this!!  I love the simple ingredients and lack of preservatives, corn syrup, etc.  A great way to get some antioxidants, too.  We used blueberries.  My kids will be eating this for an after-school snack often!!

The flavor was really good and it was extremely easy to make but the recipe calls for so much sugar that it is gritty. I would cut way down on the sugar next time and I had to put it in the freezer to set completely because it was too thin for my liking. All in all it tasted very good and I will make it again with some modifications.

VERY good recipe

I started out by making this recipe using some frozen strawberries.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, and then at the end I froze the ice cream for a few hours before serving. IT WAS YUMMMMMMY!

I also tried bannana.  It was also very good, but not quite as ful-of-flavor as the strawberry.  Then, I tried to make apricot frozen yougert, substituting the strawberries for apricots and the cream for yougert.  Also very good.  It cut out a lot of fat and calories, but just not the same as this delisious ice cream.

Overall, try this recipe.  It litterally only takes about five minutes, and it tastes just as goodd as what you buy at the store!!!

I look forward to experimenting with other fruits.

This is super easy and very good,  I did not expect it to come out so well...I was thinking it wouldn't taste like homemade ice cream...but it was so creamy and so good you could use any kind of frozen fruit and even mix and match...what a great way to make ice cream at home.  5 stars all the way.

This is a wonderful recipe as written. No need to change anything although I agree with others that it would be "Fun" to try other things or types of fruit for variation.  I think that for anyone who does not have an ice cream maker or time it will be just terrific!  Thank you Pamela for sharing it.

I made it "lighter"  by using fat-free half & half and 1/4 cup of the sugar-splenda blend.  It was still very sweet which I liked, but you could easily use less than 1/4 cup and it be plenty sweet enough! I used some fresh strawberries that I had frozen.  I found it easier to mix this in the blender if I added half of the cream in with the strawberries and use the "crush ice" button to chop the berries.  This helped keep them from freezing and sticking to the blade.  Then after chopping I added the rest of the cream and sugar-splenda and blended until thickened.  I easily doubled this recipe in my blender.  Wonderful recipe! Thanks for sharing!

My children would like to review this recipe: "It was totally awesome!"
-Bethany, age 13
"Two thumbs up"-Paul, age 9. Now my review: A very easy base recipe. We did not have strawberries so substituted frozen bananas and a Hershey bar. Wow, was it tasty. Can't wait to try it with other frozen fruit. Thanks for sharing.

Followed the recipe, but doubled the proportions.  Good flavor and super easy, but the sugar makes it a little bit gritty.  The grit was less noticeable after freezing for a couple of hours.  Next time I may omit the sugar (strawberries are sweet enough) or try a liquid sweetener.

This came out great! I admit I was skeptical at first, because of how simple this recipe is but it came out great. For best results, I would suggest putting this in the freezer for at least 30 minutes just to let it get a little more solid. Thanks for a great recipe! I plan on trying some peaches next.

This recipes is FABULOUS!!! In a agreement with other viewers the frozen straberries are hard to blend, I let mine thaw enough to chop up into smaller pieces and then went on from there, even if thaw too much you can stick it in the freezer for about 30 mins- an hour and it will just right.  Just be warned- You may as well double the recipe b/c once you taste it..... WOW!

This recipe is really versatile! I had fresh blackberries that I had to do something with so I put 10 oz through a food mill to get rid of the seeds.  I mixed the blackberry liquid with the cream and sugar in a Vitamix and put in a freezer container.  I did this in the morning. That evening we had perfect ice cream.  It seemed more like a sorbet but it was really delicious! I was happy to find this recipe!

I recommend this recipe wholeheartedly to anyone with a sweet tooth.  I use a Vitamix blender which makes this technique very easy.  You can use any frozen berry, and adjust the cream and sugar to taste.  This also works well with frozen bananas.  Definitely reduce the amount of sugar and cream if you try this with bananas, because frozen pureed bananas already have a very creamy texture and sweet flavor.

My family loved this recipe! I used berries that we had frozen this summer after picking. I also made a batch with raspberries and one with blueberries. All were terrific. My husband and kids expect to see these again!

Amazing!!! Made it for my friends and it was gone in the blink of an eye. The perfect treat for a hot summers day! It was so quick and easy to make and perfect if you don't have and ice cream maker. It was pretty sweet so I might use less sugar next time and I want to try using different berries to see what it tastes like.

This stuff is magic. It was served at a party I attended and couldn't believe how great it tasted.  It has an intense strawberry taste. I fixed it just as described, used a high speed blender and froze it for two hours and it came out perfect. It's so nice to have a frozen treat that's chemical free. Have you ever read the side of an ice cream container? Most have tons of chemicals.

Great and super easy recipe to be done with all sorts of frozen berries. My batch had an overpowering strawberry flavor, so next time I will try a little less berries and/or more cream, but I will DEFINITELY be making it in the future.

Wonderful!  Thank you!  Never would have thought of using the food processor but it works fine.  Easier than scraping it out of a blender. Great for special diets--just adjust the ingredients to your needs.

Excellent!! I made it in the blender with 1 1/2 quarts of frozen strawberries, 1/2 cup sugar, and 1 1/3 cups heavy cream.   It made 5-6 servings.   After blending I put it in the freezer for about 2 hrs (until after dinner) and it was the perfect consistency.  I could scoop it easily but it held its shape.  Everyone loved it.

"Wonderful, Creamy, and Smooth... Mmmmm" says my husband.  We just had it for dessert after dinner.  This is a total winner!  We will be having it again and I think I may bring the ingredients to our neighbors house next time we do dinner there and whip it up.  I just got the Ninja Ultima blender and it came out GREAT!  I changed the serving size to 2 - followed the recipe.  I think there will be many variations of this recipe to come.  I love how easy it is!  Thank you Pamela!

Wow, this was so good!  I decided to make this because I had some cream about to go bad.  Then, I forgot to make it before the cream actually did go bad, so I ended up using skim milk instead, which was all I had on hand.  I can't even imagine how much better it would be with cream, because it was awesome just with the milk!  I froze some fresh strawberries and used the full pound container, 1/3 c. of sugar, and 2/3 c. milk, then ended up having to add a little extra milk.  Just a tip if you use fresh strawberries, don't forget to cut off the tops before you freeze them!  That would have made it a lot easier...

I liked this recipe. I put a bit of a twist though. I put a few scoops of ice cream , almond milk and about an 1/8 cup more heavy cream and froze. I have just put it in the freezer and waiting for it to be more ice cream like (because of added ingredients).

My first homemade ice cream! It tasted very fresh n delicious. However, recipe forgot to mention... Freeze it before serving then it will look exactly like a sherbet (as I used frozen raspberries).

Awesome and addictive. I used a blender and had to add the strawberries little by little. I too followed the suggestion to add some cream first before adding strawberries. After it was all blended, I placed in a big bowl and left it in the freezer until dinner time. Got rave reviews!!! :)

I made this Ice cream this afternoon, and am eating it as I am typing this.  It is delicious and so easy to make.  Next time will double it and maybe cut the sugar a bit.

Great dessert. Used 16 oz. carton of frozen sweetend strawberries and 1 cup of heavy cream. No extra sugar was added.
It was harder to break up in my blender but everyone loved it without it being frozen.
Thanks.

No woñder this recipe has top ratings! I do not own a blender or food processor but I do have a juicer. I added less creme in a batch I made and more strawberries. TIP: freeze for 1-4 hours for GREAT ice cream. Thx for the recipe!

I don't normally review, but this recipe deserved some feedback! I was hankering for fruit ice cream, found this recipe, and decided to go out on a limb and try it. I used 10 oz. of frozen blueberries, 2/3 c. half + half, & a 1/2 tsp. of stevia instead of the 1/2 c. sugar.The only things I did differently than the recipe stated were 1) I put the stevia and half and half in first and 2) I put the ice cream in the fridge for ten min. This ice cream, made in the blender, was amazing! I feel like one heck of a chef, and in all but fifteen minutes. Thanks Pamela!

I used about 2 cups of UNSWEETENED, frozen Strawberries (bought a big bag and I don't have a food scale), 1/2 cup POWDERED sugar, and 2/3 cup heavy cream.  It was a thick, smoothie consitency out of the food processor but 2 hours in the freezer made it soft serve.  Next time I will double the amount of strawberries and sugar while keeping the cream the same.  Very tasty and easy.  Thank you.

Super yummy and super easy!  I made 2 batches, put it all in a big plastic container and stuck it in the freezer.  I've been slowly eating the ice cream for over a month.  So so good!

WOW.  I had no idea that ice cream was actually so easy to make!  I used a mixed berry concoction that I had in my freezer, and it worked like a charm.  The Boy likes chocolate chips, so we added mini ones after blending.  Like others, I put this in the freezer for a bit and the texture was near perfect.  Oh, how to describe something so... so... delicious???  With one word.  DULISHUSSSS.  I could think of more but I don't want to waste my energy thinking up words when I could be wasting my energy eating this ice cream!  Yum

This is a fantastic recipe.  The blender was useless, but the food processor blended it nicely and instantly.  I poured it into muffin tins.  It fills 10 muffin cups.  Then I served it on strawberry shortcakes on top of the fresh strawberries.  It is memorable.  :)

I made this three times, each with a different fruit. The first time I made the recipe to exact measurements with cherries. Turned out watery and froze it overnight, turned more into a sorbet and too sugary. I made it two more times, once with strawberries and once with blueberries, reducing the sugar to three cereal spoons worth of sugar and it was just right. I would think this would be a great recipe to use with kids, just keep out the sugar, use a healthy milk alternative and have it for dessert! :) I would make this again.

I made raspberry, blueberry and Strawberry. I think the strawberry is the best...I used 12oz of fruit on the rasp and blueberry and it was stiffer then the 10 oz of strawberry that I used.

Delicious!  I made mine half frozen strawberry and half frozen peach (5 ounces of each).  I used my blender, an appliance which I have never felt mastery over.  It doesn't seem to like really chopping up big chunky frozen things (like ice, or fruit in this case) and although I added half the amount of the cream at the bottom of the blender before trying to blend the fruit, it still didn't really work perfectly.  I had to leave the blade running probably a lot longer than I should have, which melted the ice crystals more and gave me an "ice cream soup" texture, rather than firm scoopable ice cream as shown in the picture.  REGARDLESS, this was an excellent, creamy refresher.  My kids went gaga over it.  I should mention that I started with adding only half of the sugar (1/4 cup) and found that was plenty sweet for us.  Your mileage may vary!  :)  Thanks for a delicious recipe!

Made this tonight, had to use 2% milk instead of cream, still tasted awesome, but more sherbety than ice cream. Also it didn't set up as well as the picture shows. Next time will use the cream. I can't wait to try it. This is a great recipe as I made it, and I am sure the orignal is better. Update, had to make another batch, kiddos came back for more. Love it!

My family just finished this dessert and they told me to review the yummy recipe!  Followed instructions and it was great!!  Some things we'll play around with: trying splenda instead of sugar (ours was a tad bit grainy), frozen mangos with or instead of strawberries, thin mints instead of strawberries with greek yogurt.  This was so yummy as is, and seems to have many possibilities!!!

I used a blender to make this, and it turned out being more of a strawberry smoothie. It was still pretty good though! I was a little disappointed that it looked nothing like the pictures posted.

I can't believe how easy and wonderful this is.  I made mine with frozen raspberries for the hubby and he is loving it.  I couldn't wait to try it while it was in the freezer hardening.  It's delicious and very easy.  By the way, I used half and half instead of cream and it was fine.

This was great and so easy! Very creamy and delicious after a couple hours in the freezer. We used frozen mangoes and can't wait to try other fruits next time!

Fantastic, easy recipe!  I generally use a small ice cream maker for creating homemade ice cream but, even after placing this in the freezer, the result was much smoother than using the machine.  I'll be making all my ice creams this way from now on!

I made this recipe for our book club. Rave reviews from everyone. The only thing I had any problem with is that the recipe states to serve immediately, but the consistency of my ice crem was creamy and more soup like than ice cream. I put the  mix in a large flat pan and then in my freezer. Yummy

Maybe it's the hot/humid weather we've been having, but Hubby and I have both been craving ice cream lately.  So as a special treat I made this and it totally hit the spot!!  Cold, creamy, sweet and wonderful!  I used fresh strawberries and did freeze it to firm it up.  I would suggest letting it sit at room temperature for 10-15 minutes for easier scooping.  There are two servings leftover and I know they'll be polished off tonight!!!  Thank you for this quick, easy and tasty treat!

Very tasty (personally I think anything with heavy whipping cream and sugar is great), BUT I ended up with a smoothy like liquid instead of a solid ice cream.  I used a blender and added half of the cream first.  I had to freeze it before serving it.  Any suggestions on how to get ice cream the first go round?

I think this is a neat idea! However, I think it is a must that it be frozen first and not served immediately unless you are serving it as a milk shake. The taste was really good, but the sugar did not dissolve so it had some crunch to it, which I did not entirely enjoy.

WOW! I followed the recipe using a food processor and a tad bit less sugar.  Today I'm going to freeze other fresh fruits just to see how far this recipe will go. This was extremly easy to make.  I may try to use half and half or some other lower in fat milk product.

I hate rating this because I changed all 3 of the ingredients but it doesn't let me leave a comment without a rating.  I used a 3 berry blend, subbed splenda for the sugar and fat-free plain yogurt for the heavy cream.  I have it setting in the freezer right now but the flavor is really good.  The only thing I didn't like was the little seeds that are left over from the 3 berry blend.  If this "healthy" version tastes so good, I can only imagine how wonderful the original is with the heavy cream & real sugar!  I can't wait to try another fruit!

This was really good, even though I didn't make it correctly. I added cream, but not enough and I couldn't blend it all the way because my blender gave out. I think the frozen strawberries were too much for it. It was smoking pretty good. The ice cream that I did manage to make was pretty good though. I'll be using a food processor from now on and definitely adding more cream.

Have made this twice now. The first time I followed the recipe exactly and although it was really very good, I didn't like the texture; something about the crunchiness of the sugar in the ice cream just didn't seem right to me. I made it again a second time and substituted about a tablespoon of honey for the sugar, and the texture was much nicer IMO.  The honey taste did come through somewhat, but it wasn't unpleasant. I think I will keep trying different variations, all in the name of science, of course.  Thanks for the recipe!

This Ice Cream is great,I used strawberries. I added a little extra heavy cream about 1 cup total. Next time I will reduce the sugar some I think that 1/2 cup was a little to much. My 2 1/2 yr old son loves it. Can't wait to make it again with different fruit.

Love this!  I didn't have enough strawberries, so I added some frozen banana.  I used fat free half & half and will probably decrease the sugar next time, depending on the sweetness of the fruit.  I'm looking forward to trying other flavors.

I made this in a blender. It took a while for the strawberries to incorporate, but it was worth the wait. A little too sweet - I will try only 1/3 c sugar next time. Straight from the blender it had a more milkshake consistency. I froze it for about 2 hours, stirring every 30 minutes, and it was perfect. It was slightly grainy before it was frozen, then I found the graininess to fade as it froze.

I have mixed feelings about this. On one hand, it was easy and the flavor was pretty good but on the other hand, it didn’t really taste like ice cream. It tasted more like what it is: just plain old strawberries and cream but with some ice mixed in. The texture isn’t right for what I would call ice cream but the flavor was still pretty good.

Yea well you really need a processor for this recipe. Buy one, borrow one, but dont use a blender. You need a certain amount of liquid to pulverize the strawberries. If i would have done it with a processor it would have been AWESOME. Thanks for sharing!

Going to an ice cream shop or even store bought is much better tasting. The sugar makes it grainy and and it gets icey in the freezer.

I used frozen raspberries that I was looking to use up.  Really good, but next time I would probably cut back on the sugar a little.  I made this several months ago during the summer and having been meaning to review!

This is SO easy and SO good...
I've tried it with strawberries and then again with banana....yummyyyy
I just wonder if there is a waay of using somthing other than whipping cream...maybe substituting half of the whipping cream for yogert, to make it healthier....I'll have to try that sometime.

This was so good and so easy! My kids helped me make this and were so surprised at how fast I made ice cream! I made two flavors - raspberry and peach and topped it off with some raspberries. I used 1/2 the amount of sugar in each ice cream flavor and it was sweet enough. It was very good! I will make it again!

This was fantastic, but gave me quite a hard time. I am sure this is worth 5 stars given a perfect preparation, but mine was quite problematic. Since I don't have a food processor, I used my blender. Apparently my blender totally sucks, b/c it didn't blend or chop a thing. I ended up having to use my stand mixer (only thing that would work!) and even though it worked, it took soo long that it was a soupy, lumpy mess by the time it was done. I am sure the ice cream consitency has to do with the quick blending process while the fruit is still frozen, but mine took so long it had to be frozen for over an hour to get it firm, and even then it was not what I would consider firm enough to be called ice cream. I uses peaches and it was very tasty, just definately not 5 minutes for me. I will have to try again once I blow coin on a nice blender or food processor.

My husband and I LOVE this recipe. I came across this only a month ago, and have made it three times a week since then. I have made it with just frozen strawberries, then with only frozen mangos. Our Favorite would have to be a combination of 5 oz frozen strawberries and 5 oz of frozen papaya, mango, and strawberries combination that I found at my local supermarket. I use a blender, so I blend the cream and the sugar first, then add the frozen fruit. We tried eating it straight from the blender--our favorite, then we ate it after it had been frozen--but that made the texture very icy. It's all about trying what works for you, but do yourself a favor and TRY THIS! I wish all desserts could be prepare in 5 minutes and taste this good!

I gave this four stars because it tastes great but it really was to soft to serve immediately.  Next time I will make it a day ahead of time and it will be perfect!

It really only took five minutes to make this, but it's too soft right out of the blender.  Let it harden for about 3 to 4 hours and it's perfect for dishing out.

So delicious and easy.  2 slight problems:
1.  Consistency - Not really ice cream unless you freeze 1st - More like very thick milkshake (still delicious)
2.  Too much sugar - I am a total sweet tooth, but it was even too much sugar for me and I didn't even use 1/2 a cup!
     Even w/ these small issues I still gave 5 stars b/c it was DELICIOUS!!  I even made one batch w/ 2c frozen strawberries, sugar, few dollops of peanut butter, and 6oz. strawberry soy yogurt (for my son that has milk allergy).  It was amazing, like PBJ ice cream (and I usually can't stand the soy yogurt).  
     I will definitely make again.  Will try w/ less sugar or Splenda and maybe yogurt or ff 1/2 & 1/2.  Has potential to be wonderful and healthy!

My family goes to a small cafe where they make all their icecream by hand. Its kind of exspensive to go there, but the ice cream is worth the price. This icecream tasted exactly as the exspensive stuff at the Cafe! It was soooo good. I put in a little more cream than I was supposed to, it still turned out fine. I also didnt add any sugar at all because I found some strawberies that had been frozen in a syrup so that was all the sweetening it needed. Trust me, strawberry icecream does NOT need much sweetening. I like the idea of vanilla pudding instead, I'll have to try that sometime. Thanks for the recipe its AWESOME.

This is a fantastic and quick. It reminds me a lot of soft serve frozen yogurt. I did only give this recipe 4 stars though because I found it way to sweet. Next time we make this (and I know I will make this for years) I will use probably only about 1/4 cup of sugar. I love being able to mix up some homemade "ice cream" and know exactly what went in it.

This was just ok.  It really did only take 5 minutes or less to make but I had to let it set in the freezer for at least 2-3 hours (I prefer hard, frozen ice cream).  Also, the sugar made the ice cream grainy.

WOW!  I was very skeptical about this, I don't eat much ice cream but when I do, I like the good stuff.  This exceeded my expectations by far.  I made strawberry and peach, used 1 c. whipping cream for each, and cut back on the sugar.  Also added 1/2 t. almond extract to the peach, it was heavenly!!!  Thank you for a super easy, super good recipe!

OMG! Delish! I used 10 oz. frozen raspberries from the garden as that was what was on hand. Instead of granulated sugar, I used powdered sugar (to attempt to limit the graininess some mentioned). I weighed out 3 oz.(reducing the sugar per reviews) and dissolved it in the heavy cream. It was the perfect sweetness for me when eaten immediately after making, but will see how the sweetness level holds up to the balance that's tucked away in the freezer. I also added 1/4 tsp. vanilla extract, just because. I felt this batch needed an additional splash of heavy cream in the final seconds of processing. Can't wait to try it with some strawberries! Thanks so much!
7/21/08- Great raspberry taste now that it's cured for a couple of days.Odd texture when frozen, but that could be because of the length of time I had the raspberries frozen and/or the amount of ground up seeds in the mixture. Nicely paired, though, with a batch of homemade vanilla custard ice cream.

We usually make our smoothies with frozen fruit and some fruit juice so this was an easy switch - just use cream instead of the fruit juce.  Not quite as healthy but it surrrre is tasty!

I made this tonight for dessert.   Bf thinks it's a smoothie, so we're going to try freezing it and see what he thinks.  He mentioned that he'd prefer it with Splenda to cut down on some of the sugar, so I'll try it that way next time.  Very quick, very easy. Thanks for the recipe!

Love this recipe! Followed it exact, keeps well for a couple days in the freezer. Wonderfully creamy taste, much richer than store bought ice cream. Quick and easy, you'd never know it only took 5 minutes.

Wow!  I usually hate strawberry ice cream, because I don't like fake strawberry flavoring.  This was easy and extremely tasty.  Don't keep it in your freezer too long, though, because ice crystals will form and ruin the texture.

I cannot believe I found this recipe 10 minute ago and am already eating homemade ice cream! So yummy. I used half fat free milk and half fat free half and half, frozen blackberries from Trader Joes instead. Served immediately, more sorbet than ice cream - but still great!

I used frozen mixed fruit and it was very yummy.  After one taste my husband says, 'you should make this again.'  I think I will try to make it a minty chocolate chip somehow.

this didn't turn out as ice cream for me. we were all hungry, and the "ice cream" was looking more like a smoothie so we just ate it like that. still very good though!

this was really good! i used my old blender for this one. I used half-and-half instead of milk and instead of heavy cream.  But i also added about a fourth of a cup of milk mixed with about a tablespoon of condensed milk in too.  It looked like a smoothie at first but when we froze it for a couple hours, it was great!

I have made it 3 times.  We prefer about 1 cup cream as the original recipe is a little to "icy" for us.  Otherwise, excellent.

It was as hard as a rock to get out of the container even in the icecream door in my freezer. The second time I made it I added a little vodka and it was a better consistency and easier to get out of the container.

Made this several times as strawberries are I need season. Love that there are only 3 ingredients and that I can adjust the sugar to my tastes. I find a table spoon of sugar sufficient as the strawberries are also sweet. I add on teaspoon of vanilla when mixing. This disappears quickly and I have shared the recipe with friends.

I used a blender... and when I tasted it: 1. It wasn’t the consistency that I wanted it. 2. I felt like I was literally eating the sugar. So i added a little bit of half and half, still wasn’t the consistency that i wanted. so i froze it. I’m still waiting. It hasn’t been a week yet.

I love this recipe and already thinking what I can make next.  This was my first time trying it.  I bought some fresh cherries and used my pitting machine to take out pits, then put in freezer.  I had some left over dark chocolate chips.  I used the blender, put some cream in bottom, added 1/4 of sugar, handful of chips and 1 3/4 cup of cherries.  Using spatula to move everything around till blended.  Added rest of cream.  It was soft serve good, then put in freezer for a few hours to set and was even better.

Really good! I used half and half cream cause that’s what I had on hand but it was still Delicious I put it in the freezer to thicken it up a little bit and after it was so good! I’ve mad it about 3 times and right now for the 4rth time it’s sitting in the freezer and I’m actually using 3 % milk for this time and I used it last time and turns out fine

I used organic sugar that I even tried grinding before putting the frozen strawberries in the food processor, but it still came out really gritty. I think next time I will grind the sugar in a herb grinder for finer better results. Otherwise it had really good flavor. I also used organic strawberries which makes a huge difference.

Made it with tropical fruit and then with cherries. Both were good and the sugar can be reduced if your fruit is on the sweeter side.

Amazing. Just delicious. One tip don't use a vitamix to make it! It's much too powerful. I had to freeze it for hours to get my ice cream. I'll use my ninja the next time as suggested by someone on here. So glad I have this recipe.

I made this for my family. It was sooooo good, lol. I used about 10 medium fresh strawberries and 30 fresh blueberries frozen. I only used 1/4 cup of sugar and 1 cup of heavy whipping cream. It turned out perfectly creamy, although my fruit was rather sweet so I think I could have used a little less sugar still.It made quite a bit, enough to serve 6 people. Sorry no picture. It disappeared too fast. I'm going to try it with frozen fresh cherries next time. I'll update with a picture.

I used 5 oz each of mango and strawberry and 1/3 cup of a mix of milk and plain Greek yogurt. I liked the consistency, but it was waaaay too sweet. I'll try again with half the sugar and a drop of vanilla.

Could do with less sugar, depending on your tastes. The secret to keeping this from becoming a smoothie, as soon as it turns a creamy colour instead of looking like chunks of fruit, it is done!

Very tasty! I made Huckleberry ice cream and also a mint Choco one (used chocomint girl guide cookies and vanilla). Don't whip whipping cream too long or it will be runny. I put it in the freezer right away to chill and make more solid and it was great.

Ok, I dont have a blender at this moment so I used frozen juice and the added the heavy whipping cream, and a tad bit of sugar. I tasted it before I froze it, tasted pretty good. When I do get a blender I will definitely use frozen fruits of fresh fruit to make ice cream

This is a pretty good, quick and easy recipe. I cut the recipe in half so I should have used a 1/4 cup sugar but that seemed like a lot to me so I used a little less than that. It is still pretty sweet so next time I make it I will try it with maybe half the sugar that the recipe calls for. 
I also put my ice cream in the freezer to harden up a bit before eating it.

This was a great recipe. If I made it again (which I probably will) I would tone down the sugar just a bit. I froze mine for a couple hours after making it and it helped a lot. I would love to try different flavors as well as this. I garnished this with mint and basil. A great summer recipe!

This was so easy and such a treat. I used a combo of strawberries, peaches and pineapple and used the blender, adding half the cream to the bottom first and then slowly adding the rest of the fruit. Next time I'll try substitution cream with vanilla yogurt. Excellent thanks!

It tasted wonderful, but it was a lot less thick than I like. More like a thick smoothie. I would recommend using less cream or more fruit (I used more anyway, because I found it a little too sweet for my taste as well). Also, do not go on the assumption that 1 cup = 8 oz. It will not turn out well for you! XD

I made this today while we were snowed in. It was delish. I don't have a food processor, only a blender, and the thicker the ice cream got, the less the blender moved. I also had to keep stopping the blender to push the strawberries closer to the blades so that they could be chopped. I'm now eager to get an ice cream maker. Anyway, everyone in my family loved this ice cream. I am going to try it with other types of berries or pineapple next.

Excellent recipe!I have made this recipe many times and it goes FAST every time.  I used my home-frozen strawberries with some sugar already added so I cut the sugar a bit.  Definitely use heavy whipping cream and not half and half or milk unless you'd rather have a smoothie! I've also used peaches and red raspberries.  This is a winner!

This is a really good and very simple recipe.  If you've got lots of fresh, ripe fruit, this is a great way to use it up. For those that said it's too sweet, you need to adjust the sugar amount if the fruit is super ripe. Start with 1/4 cup sugar, taste, and add more it you think it's not sweet enough. I also suggest not making more ice cream than you eat that same day, as it forms little ice crystals after being in the freezer overnight and the texture is completely changed.  I learned after my first batch of "gritty" ice cream, that I had to grind the sugar first.  Once I did that, I mixed the ground sugar with the heavy cream to dissolve it, then added the berries.  Outstanding taste and flavor.  I've also used this recipe with blueberries and we loved that too!

GREAT!  My only complaint was that I could taste granules of sugar in the finished product.  Still we devoured.  I'll probably cut down on the sugar next time, esp with sweet fruit, but all in all SO quick and SO easy :)  Thanks so much for recipe!

I liked the idea of five minute ice cream. I really do, but I like to eat healthy so instead of putting in heavy whipping cream in.... I put light whipping cream in the ice cream and it still was delicious! Quite Yummy! \

At first I didn't think this would work without an ice cream machine and because the recipe was too simple. I'm glad I was wrong. I stuck to the recipe and it came out great. My family thoroughly enjoyed this.

Good start - but we cut the sugar at least by half.  Can also use Splenda and skim milk or fat free half and half works well.  Key is the berries (or other fruit) have to be very frozen!  Don't let them thaw at all.  We've made it several times and my kids love it.  And it makes just enough for all 4 of us to have a serving.

Super-easy & comes out great.  My only recommendation is to taste it before adding all of the sugar; you may not need as much, or might need more, etc.  I've made it with 1/2 Splenda & with 1% milk and it comes out great.

I know I will be making this throughout the summer - thank you!

go, make this for your children. I used 10 oz of blueberries, 1/4 C sugar and I used full fat coconut milk (from a can), which I eyeballed. I wanted it to be spoonable out of the food processer. I am eating it with a spoon now, but it is much softer than soft serve. My picky 7 year old has refused it until it is hard.  Even after going through the FP, there are little tiny nuggets of frozen coconut milk/fat that melt on your tongue. yummy.

Flavor was good - but unless you ate it as soon as you made it, it was an absolute brick!!

Oh My! This stuff is addicting and so quick and easy to make too. Was a little sweet for our tastes, so I reduced the sweetener to 1/3 cup and instead of sugar used stevia. I made this 3 times in less than a week. YUM!!

I've wanted an ice cream maker for a long time, but now I don't need one! What a great (and simple) way to make homemade ice cream! We tried it last night with strawberries and chocolate chips, yum! I have a couple recipes for some Italian ice that I want to try, so I'll be using this method! Does anyone have any suggestions of how to make plain vanilla using this method?

Flavor was great however no amount of time in the food processor got rid of the ice crystals leaving much to be desired with the texture.

I made this with my grand-daughter exactly as the recipe said and it was wonderful. It was all I could do to save some to put in the freezer as she just wanted to eat it all right then. Only took five minutes as stated. Well maybe a couple of minutes more with a six year old as she wanted to put the strawberries in one by one :)

I had picked up plastic things to make your own push up pops and put some in there and she loved it the next day. Much healthier alternative to what you can buy at the store.

This is simple and delicious! It comes out like a thick smoothie, so to get a harder texture, you need to freeze it a bit first. I added some blueberries, yum!

This is really good and really easy to make. Not sure I'd call it "Ice Cream" but it's a great treat. Will try with other frozen fruits too.

It was a hit!  The easiest ice cream I've made.  Instead of heavy cream, I used yogurt and some frozen whipped cream and topped it with chocolate chips. We will definitely try this with other frozen fruits.

I'm trying this recipe for the second time, since it turned out so well the first time. I prefer adding less sugar, but otherwise the ingredients work wonderfully- I love how simple it is! 
The only thing though, it is definitely NOT the texture of ice cream when it first comes out on the blender. I had to put it in the freezer, take it out before it fully hardens and blend it again (repeating this step one or 2 more times) before it was the right consistency.

I know this recipe does not need any more rave reviews than it already has :). This was outstanding!! My husband and son actually prefer this over the store bought icecream. In summer I make this with variety of different berries (trust me, just done try blackberries..lol). thank you for a great recipe.

While I have to agree, the taste is absolutely amazing with this! My grief, however, is that it was definitely a smoothie as the recipe stands. After firming it up in the freezer for a while it is great! This makes a great treat in the summer, or any time. I would definitely recommend it, just be sure to firm it up in the freezer.

You are AWSOME I wanted an ice cream maker but money and have no storage space made me keep putting it off. I used powdered sugar because thats what I had, I love making smoothies so I always have fruit in the freezer, now I'm gonna have tons of ice cream in there. I can't wait to try kinds of flavors.

Feeling desperate for ice cream as an evening snack, this filled the bill. I also made a batch with a whole fresh mango but made the mistake of adding an extra 1/4 cup sugar, which turned out delicious even though a bit too sweet. Don't expect this to be as creamy as a long churned or higher fat version, but for instant it is amazing and makes me very happy!

i just made this for my kids because it's dessert night (wednesday) and i forgot to buy ice cream today. i had frozen strawberries, sugar and half and half (not heavy cream) and it worked great. it wasn't as frozen as the kids would like so they used a straw instead of a spoon but that was just fine. they raved about it! they asked me to make it again next wednesday. i'll probably make it ahead so i can freeze it. of course, i tried it and it is super yummy. i could see doing this with any kind of berry in addition to bananas, pineapple or oranges...anything sweet that can be frozen. this goes into the regular rotation, for sure.

Fantastic - an incredibly intense strawberry flavor.  Didn't have heavy cream so used half 2% greek yogurt and half 2% milk (would love to try the heavy cream though).  Big hit with four of the five kids and dh said it was pretty good.  Yum.  I look forward to trying other combinations.

My daughter had a friend spend the night last night and I made this ice cream for them.  They loved it & so did my husband and I!  It makes four small dishes.  It was a bit gritty (sugar) but oh so good!  I think the next time I might try reducing the sugar a bit.

WOW!  I had a big bag of frozen mixed fruit (strawberries, peaches,mango, pineapple) from Costco - great way to use it up!  I used 2/3 cup half and half, 3 tbl Splenda and a tsp of vanilla.  THIS IS SO GOOD!  My son started eating it right out of the food processor.

I was skeptical of this method, but it really works.  Will definitely make again, although with less sugar--I didn't even use a full half cup and it was a bit sweet for me.

I subbed cultured buttermilk for the cream -- since you can't get the real kind anymore the stuff is basically liquid yogurt. I use it in smoothies and stuff all the time. Similar texture, tangy flavor, and naturally much lower in fat and calories than the heavy cream. Yay!

Not the best. Extremely rich from the cream. Wonder if it could be lightened with milk somehow. Also didn't think the sugar dissolved well into the mixture and you would actually chew on sugar granules.

This was very easy and very appreciated by friends. I usually use the two plastic bag method with salt and ice, but this is faster and just as cool and refreshing!

I made this with frozen mangoes. It was lovely. I did combine the sugar and cream before adding to the processor though. Otherwise made as written.  YUM!  Thank you!

Smooth! Creamy! This is absolutely delicious! I bought whole frozen strawberries and sliced them into quarters before mixing. I added a handful of berries to the blender, all the sugar and I blended them for about 5 seconds, just to combine. Then I added some of the heavy cream and continued alternately adding the berries and cream. Since it was a little runny, I froze it for about 45 minutes and it was wonderful! Thanks for the great recipe!

This was awesome...so creamy...I made 1 batch with stawberry's and 1 batch with mixed fruit they both were delish! I did add a splash of vanilla to both batches. I have used a ice cream machine for MANY years and this is just as creamy I couldn't believe it. My family loved it..thought I had spent alot of time making it. Thanks soooo much for such a easy & wonderful dessert! The first place I go to is Allrecipe & it's member's when I need something wonderful to wow all my guest's. I would give more star's if I could!

O.M.G. Awesome!!  I did the first batch with mixed berries, but didn't like all the seeds.  Second batch was strawberry and it was divine! I used proportions as directed, but think I'll use less sugar next time.

I loved this so much!  I added about 1/2 cup more cream to get the instant consistensy I wanted, and that's all I changed.  It also hardens nicely in the freezer, if you can hold back from eating it right away!  Delicious.

This was good, BUT... it was very icy. I used fresh strawberries, vanilla yogurt, and half and half, cocoa, and little bit more sugar. The flavor was good, but I was kinda hoping for a creamier consistancy. Maybe if you add a banana it would be creamier??

This was pretty good.  I don't know that I would call it ice cream though.  When using a blender, it is very difficult to mix without adding additional cream.  I will try different fruit and hope for a better outcome.

I made two batches, both using whole milk. The first was rhubarb with the full 1/2 c. sugar. The other was blueberry, with half the sugar and 1 tsp. vanilla. I tasted both right after making them, and they were great. However, after I froze them, they were not as good. The flavor was still good, but the texture was icy and not at all creamy. I still devoured it, though! Next time I will try to eat most of it before freezing and sometime I will try using light cream. I will definitely make this recipe often in the future! P.S. I stirred the sugar into the milk before adding it to the food processor and I didn't have any problems with grittiness.

It gets a little tricky when the cream freezes to the fruit but if you keep blending, it turns out soooooo yummy!  I really liked it with frozen mixed berries.

This recipe turned out more like sherbet than ice cream.  It's grainy but tastes good.  For ice cream, you can't beat the prep time.

I made this ice cream last night and it was soooo good.  I substituded Splenda for the sugar.  My husband, who is pretty picking about his ice cream, said it was perfect.  I would recommend using a food processor.  I tried it both ways and just couldn't get it to come out right in the blender but in the food processor it came out a perfect ice cream consistancy.

Taste good and easy to make.  You need a really good blender or food processor, though. I had a hard time with the frozen strawberries so had to add cream before they were reasonably chopped to help with the blending. I used splenda instead of sugar.

This is great! So wonderfully creamy! I used frozen mixed berries since that's what we happened to have on hand and it was delicious. I stuck it in the freezer for 30 minutes and it was firmer, but still fairly smushy. I liked it better this way but still ate the rest after it was more like traditional ice cream.
I tried frozen mangos today and it was smoother than the berries (since they have seeds on them) but the taste is kinda weird.

I honestly though this recipe was too easy and too good to be true, but now Im a believer.  I made it with frozen blueberries, 1/4 c sugar, and heavy cream, and it came out the perfect flavor, sweetness and texture.

REally Good! I made raspberry-peach because that's what I had in the freezer. More of a sherbet than ice cream, awesome!

I loved it - tried it with mangos too and it was delish.  I used 1/2 - 3/4 c of sugar and it was still sweet and yummy! date night special

This was good and easy.  Like other reviewers, I agree that there is way too much sugar as it was gritty.  I will cut that back next time.  I also agree to make is a couple of hours ahead of time and freeze it for better ice cream texture.  The other thing is that I think the heavy cream was too much-a bit overpowering.  Next time, I'll use half and half or cut back the amount.  Thanks for a great technique and wonderful use of frozen fruit!

Awesome, we loved this!!  Used stawberries and half & half.  I'm making again tonight.  We plan to try yogurt and sugar free creamer instead of the real stuff, to see if it's as good with less calories.

This is so good!  I did half a batch in 3 different flavors so far.  I am still going to do a few more.  I did strawberry, blueberry, and chocolate (it is taking a lot longer to freeze because it wasn't made with frozen fruit.  Instead I crushed a few icecubes with the sugar and a tablespoon of choc. syrup)  I will be making raspberry, vanilla (same way as chocolate), and chocolate chip.

Mmmmmm. I've even made this with vanilla yogurt and a few packets of splenda for the ultra health conscious visitors, but the original recipe is out of this world. Thanks!!!!

This was very good and VERY easy.  It really did only take five minutes!  I substituted fresh peaches (chopped and frozen) for the strawberries.  Great way to keep from wasting good fruit.

I'll be making this one again! My kids loved it and it can't get easier than this. I thought it was maybe a little too sweet, so I might use a little less sugar next time. I made it as is, but will definitely try other fruits. Thanks!

Good stuff!  I stuck it in a blender and used a wooden spoon to push down the fruit so it all got blended.  Once blended, I put it in the freezer for about an hour and the consistency was good.

I really like this recipe, but my ice cream turns out really chunky.  I have to keep adding more liquid until its the right consistency so beware blender users!! Next time I will have to try the food processor.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I finally made this! It was so fast and yummy! I used mango and I halved the recipe because I was only making it for me plus I was using my tiny food processor. It was so good, I know I'm going to be making this all the time now. I cant wait to do the strawberry!

When I saw this recipe, I had to try it even though I did not have the exact ingredients.  This is a three-ingredient recipe and I did have none of the ingredients at hand ;)  I used raspberries, half and half, and powdered sugar (a little less than ½ cup).  The result was very creamy sorbet with a beautiful color and a delicious flavor.

Good and easy.  I used strawberries that I had sliced, sweetened and froze.  I had to thaw out the strawberries some, I thought my processor was going break!

Wow, very yummy!  I used frozen peaches and it was delicious!  It was more of a smoothie texture, next time I will try freezing it for 30 min at least :)  I blended the peaches in my blender, took a little work but was well worth it and pretty fast!

This is incredible, and I can't say that i resent the fact that is doesn't freeze well because I can just make it again in 5 minutes, so there's no point in making extra to save.
