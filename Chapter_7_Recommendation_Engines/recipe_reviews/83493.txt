This was very easy to make and tasted pretty good.  I think however one could cut down on the amount of water as the rice was a trifle soggy.  Overall, this was a tasty dish.

Excellent.  Used chicken broth instead of water and it was good old comfort food.

Combined elements of this recipe and Creamy Chicken Bog with a Kick. Used leftover rice and browned sausage. Will need to try with correct ingredients and amounts.
