I have used this exact recipe using a pork loin roast and on another occasion, a whole, boneless turkey breast. Both were delicious, moist, and provided hearty, filling meals for my family. Precisely following the recipe is essential. Do not use quick-cooking rice. It will alter the texture of the final product. Maybe that accounts for the "mussy" rice in another review. Dried cranberries, as specified in the recipe, absorb some of the cooking liquid but remain intact adding delicious, tart dimension to the dish. Canned or fresh cranberries probably break apart and add excess liquid so are not good substitutes. Pears instead of apples? I'm not sure that's a reasonable substitute either. Additional cooking liquid (broth) certainly won't enhance the recipe and could explain the reviewer's "unedible" rice mixture.

After reading the first review, I decided to cook the rice separately and instead of adding dried cranberries, I used a can of whole berry cranberry sauce. The roast was very moist and made a nice sauce to put over the rice.

OK so the flavors were really good but the rice got very mussy and the roast a little dry. Not the best cook in the world so i followed the recipe to the letter and that's what i got. If anyone can tell me how to correct these things the next time i try this recipe i would greatly appreciate it.

This came out so yummy.  I did make a few changes to the recipe though.  I seasoned the pork loin with salt & pepper, and then browned it on all sides,(5 minutes per side), in Olive Oil over medium high heat.  While the meat was browning,I combined the apples,  (skin on), onions, craisins, salt, & pepper in the bottom of the crock pot.  When the pork finished browning, I squished the apple, cranberry, onion mixture to the sides of the crock pot, and laid the pork loin in the middle so it was touching the bottom of the crock pot.  I was worried about it being to dry, so I added a cup of chicken stock.  I sprinkled the Herbs de Provence over everything and let it cook on high for 6 hours.  I made the rice separately in my rice cooker, and when the pork was finished cooking, I used a slotted spoon to get the apple, cranberry, onion mixture out.  I mixed that in with the cooked rice.  It came out wonderful!  I will definitely make it again.

When I made this I used fresh cranberries instead of craisins (I also added sugar to balance the tartness of fresh cranberries) and I used pear instead of apples since that is what I had on hand.  I also added in chicken broth along with uncooked rice, in hopes that it wouldn't be so mushy like the other review said.  The pork came out awesome!  Super tender and juicy, but the rest of the stuff was unedible.  I ended up dumping out the rest.  I gave this 2 stars because of the tender pork, otherwise it would have been 1 star since we couldn't eat the rest.

Agree with other reviewer that rice was okay but roast was dry. Not sure how to make this any different.

This has become my families favorite pork dish. Easy and yummy. And make sure you use the herbs de Provence. Makes it all the better.

We made this for dinner tonight, it turned out GREAT!  We made a couple of changes - we didn't have herbes de Provence so we used garlic salt and all spice and added one of those snack pack sized things of applesauce.  Also, we made the rice separate and did not combine it. Totally yum!

This turned out soooo tasty! My husband loved it.  As suggested by a few others, I cooked rice separately in rice cooker, and added a cup of chicken stock to the crock pot mix.

M-m-m-m  Very moist!  Son loved it and he's a fairly picky eater.  I followed several changes suggested by others.   I seasoned the pork loin with salt & pepper, and then browned it on all sides,(5 minutes per side), in Olive Oil over medium high heat. While the meat was browning,I combined the apples, (skin on), onions, whole sauce cranberry, and 1 cup chicken stock, and couple of tbs herbs de provence and added all to the pork roast in the crockpot.  I cooked rice separate & then added the sauce from the roast to the rice (squishing the skins).

The meat was excellent, but no one in my house liked the rice. It wasn't mushy, but it left a brown mess stuck to the sides of my crockpot.
