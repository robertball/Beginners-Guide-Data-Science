These sandwiches are very tasty.  I suggest chicken tenders for simplicity and convenience.  I also feel from this experience that the sauce and flour mixture ought to be completed BEFORE frying the chicken and baking the biscuits.

I loved it. It was rich with flavor. I soaked my chicken in the buttermilk and seasonings overnight,  It smelled so good after frying the chicken.

It was a hit at my house, but my kids were not of fan of the sweetness of the sauce.  I thought it was good but I ended up just mixing melted butter and sriracha and drizzling it on top instead.  Next time I will try it with the honey hot sauce.

I used Tobasco sauce instead of Siracha and Old Bay's for the seasoning in the flour dredge. Still had some kick and lots of flavor. I also used my favorite biscuit recipe rather than the canned ones. My husband enjoyed them a lot. Definitely will be making these again.

Way too much salt! But very yummy other than that!
