My family loved this recipe!!  It was one of those times where I wasnt going to be home for dinner, and they forgot to make a sandwich out of it and ate it as it was and raved about it.  I followed exactly except used turkey italian sausage and it was not greasy, it was awesome, thank you!!  We will use this again and again....

This was very tasty.  I added one can of tomato sauce, because it seemed a little dry.  My family really enjoyed it, and it made plenty!

Oh my goodness, this was so good I made it the again the very next day and froze it.     The flavors of the peppers blended so well with the 2 different kinds of meats.  You could serve this so many ways.  I saw one reviewer said, her family ate it as is with no bread.  Well, it is just that good.  You can serve it with unlimited toppings and a marinara dip if you like.  This recipe is as versatile as it is good.  I didn't change a thing.  (either time)  :-)  Enjoy All.  Elaine, thank you so much for sharing this one.  This one is a keeper.  I can't wait to take it to the next pot luck!

These were pretty good, however, for me, a little goes a long way.  They seemed almost too rich for me, if that makes any sense.  I was only able to eat a half sub (which was plenty) due to the richness.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Elaine!

Super! I added a few mushrooms and ~9fo of beer (had to make sure the beer was good for consumption first;)).
I reduced veggies to 1 instead of 2 and skipped out on adding the cheese. Will definitely make again.

Very good. I used ground turkey instead of beef. Also, I didn't have green bell peppers, so I used red and yellow. This is a winner.

I added a tablespoon of garlic powder for the 4 person ingredients, was still a little dry so I also added 1 cup beef bullion.  It turned out excellently.

I found this recipe years ago on here and have been making it ever since. In the fall I prep this the night before and keep it in the fridge until the next morning, turn on the crock pot before we leave to go wood cutting and when we come home we are so hungry and the taste of these sandwiches is amazing!!!

I love this,, made for a party and it was a big hit! Made according to the recipe exactly the first time, but it is good no matter how many peppers or onions are in it.  The trick is to keep the sausage and hamburger ratio the same. Thanks for the idea!

Great filling dinner for hungry teens!! It is a little dry but I solved that by sauteing fresh garlic in some olive oil and adding it to the mix before putting on the hoagie rolls...will make again!

These were pretty good.  I would give it around a 3 star and my husband around a 5 star, so we are going middle ground with 4.  The only reason I would give it 3, is because I'm not a huge fan of Italian sausage to being with.  I made this with ground turkey and ground turkey hot Italian sausage and it wasn't greasy at all.  I also added some marinara sauce to the sandwiches before serving and that was really good.  Next time I make them, maybe I'll use more ground turkey and less sausage (just because of my personal preference).

Yum! I am not a huge fan of Italian sausage so I added in hot breakfast sausage in its place.  I added about 2Tbs of tomato paste, sprinkled in some Italian seasoning, and stirred in some garlic.  After it had been simmering for a couple of hours my husband and I felt it might be a little dry so we added in a little beer.  This recipe will definitely be a keeper!

This recipe was very tasty. Added some garlic, but other than that followed the recipe exactly. The meat was very tender...

I added olive and fresh tomato to my sandwich.  I melted cheese in and on top of it and served it on a toasted onion bun.  Even if it was authentic, I didn't love the sausage, I would probably just do ground beef by itself .  My husband liked the sandwich quite a bit, and both of our plates were empty.

This is the very first thing I ever cooked in my Crock Pot. Setup was very simple, and it turned out extremely well. I made this with spicy sausage, and felt that it didn't need any additional seasoning.

I made this for my husband last week and he loved it. I thought it looked a little greasy but he said it was delicious. I topped it with Provolone cheese and served it on toasted wheat rolls. I will definitely make these again.
