I was worried that these might be dry, so I used almost a full cup of yogurt and doubled the milk. I also added 1 tsp. of cinnamon powder to the dry ingredients. I used only 1 tsp. of almond extract. Because I added more wet ingredients, the batter was very sticky, so I dropped the batter onto the cookie sheet in 12 equal portions and topped it with cinnamon sugar and chopped walnuts (didn't have any almonds).They were perfect! Light, moist and flavorful! Just what I wanted! Great recipe!

I followed this recipe to the "T" -- it was okay, but I won't make it again.  In my opinion, it didn't show off the apples to their best.  If you do make it, these scones are best eaten warm -- you'll find their flavor greatly improved by a few seconds in the microwave.

True to the nature of scones, these scones were dense and a bit dry after the first day. I found they could use a bit more flavor, and plan to use more vanilla sugar and cinnamon next time. I also grated the apples into the batter.

My boss mmade these scones and brought them to work; they were wonderful, even at room temperature.  She said she had one warm from the oven the night before with a cup of Chai, and it was fantastic.  These were very tender and moist.

I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using half whole wheat flour. These scones tasted great for breakfast and were a perfect way to use the bounty of apples we have from our small orchard.

I substituted some of the ingredients with ingredients that I had on hand such as table spread instead of shortening, apricot yogurt instead of plain, soy milk for milk, vanilla extract for almond and used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1cup of normal all purpose flour.  Turned out great anyway! Definitely a favorite at my hostel!

Excellent! I added a bit more yogurt and 1 peach and a handful of fresh saskatoons in addition to the 2 apples. They turned out light and fluffy. Delicious

I have no idea what happened with these.  First time attempting scones and the finished product was good, but not at all what I expected.  The dough was sticky and more like a batter than a dough. Sticky, messy and a pain to try to knead.  I know the kneading is supposed to be minimal, but because of the stickiness I had to keep adding flour. I noticed others reviews stated numerous substitutions they made and the finished product turned out well.  I kept to the recipe and made no substitutions. Won't use this recipe again.  I'm going to try another AR recipe tomorrow and hope I have better luck.

These turned out very well for me. I took the advice of another review and used a little more yogurt. My family was very pleased with the outcome!

These were good!  I used butter instead of shortening and three small Gravenstein apples.  I didn't have plain yogurt so I used vanilla yogurt, which I increased to 3/4 cup.  I also didn't have sliced almonds for the topping.  They turned out well even with the changes.

I love the creamy taste of these.  I did substitiute vanilla yogurt for the plain as it is what I had on hand.  Next time I make them I think I may put some slivered almonds on top too.

Taste of apple was weak. Used extra butter and more cinnamon and used toasted almonds.

I am quite the rookie baker, but these turned out GREAT. i took the advice to add more yogurt, so about a cup instead of half. little bit more milk.  2 fairly large apples, the more the better for me anyways. and i didnt have almond extract so i used vanilla extract, but still used crushed almonds for the topping. Also added some cinnamon powder to the dry mix. They turned out very moist and sooo good. even my picky little 2 year old loves them! Thank you for the recipe and advice!!

they just came out of the oven.  I added an extra tsp of vanilla, 1 tsp of cinnammon and greek yogurt with a little half and half and used butter instead of shortening -- then sprinkled with cinnamon sugar before baking.  I ommited the almonds except for the extract. It came out okay and the apples with the almond extract and cinnamon is a nice combination. They do not really look very attractive but the taste is fine.  I made them as drop scones.  Next time I may add more flour and make them into biscuits, but drop scones have more moisture which is nice.  I would recommend the recipe when you are in the mood to make something sweet.

I added applesauce and cinnamon to the recipe which made it really good. However if you follow this recipe to a T you will have a dry scone
