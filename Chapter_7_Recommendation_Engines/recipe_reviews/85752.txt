Friends said this was the best chili they had ever eaten. I did make some changes, I browned the meats together then drained and added other ingrediants. I added alot more cumin and chili powder. I didn't add the beer or tequila as that's just not something I have readily available in my cupboard but I think I will try to have on hand next time.

This needed work.  As is; it's basically a tomato based soup. Very sweet. Had to triple (or more)the chili powder and cumin to get it to taste like "chili". I am from Texas and having a few Chili cook-offs under my belt, this is nothing like the chili's that are indicative of the region.  I did like the beer in it and will probably work that into my favorite Chili recipe, but I won't make this one again.

excellent chili. the great smells in the kitchen made everyone hungry. i added a little extreme-hot-sauce and it was a total success. i served with some rolls and some thinly grated chedder.  i'm going to make this on more than one football weekend this fall/winter.

This was a good chili, but you definitely have to add more chili powder and cumin . . . I also added some tobasco and extra chilis - there was virtually no heat.  Also, it probably only needs about 2 - 2.5 hours of simmering with the lid on . . . I simmered mine for 3 hours and it lost most of the juice.  I can't imagine how dry it would be after 5 hours!  Not bad though.

Very good recipe. I have a wonderful recipe already but wanted to try something new. Was a nice change of pace! I did alter a little thou... I added a decent amount of Franks Red Hot. Also added 1 Habenero 1 Red Chili in addition to the current pepper order. WIth the meats I also did seperatly. My sausage weight was around 2.5lbs and 2lbs of beef. sausage i removed the skin and pan fried then ran through the food processor for a more even texture. I boiled the beef and ran through the food processor as well. Only other thing was more chili pepper was needed in my opinion but the recipe is a good starting area :) like any recipe season to taste. Hope you all enjoy this recipe as well

Fantastic, made this for the first time about a month ago. It went over so well It will be the center of attention for my super bowl party. I will go a little easy on the heat, If you like it real hot you can always add later. The only thing I did different was brown the meats in a seperate sauce pan drain off then add to veggies.

Amazing chili!! I used turkey sausage instead of pork and cut the serrranos down because I was serving this to kids as well as adults. Everyone including my fellow Texans thought it was superb. Will be making again soon.

The chili was good but not great. Definitely needs a little more working on. The heat and spice needs to be upped a notch along with flavor

Even a half recipe makes a lot! Used chipotle peppers in adobo instead of the peppers in the recipe. Also added some Mexican Oregano and a bit of salt

Absolutely delicious!  I followed this except for changes based on what I had or didn't have on hand... I used fire roasted diced tomatoes and I didn't have serrano peppers and I scaled the recipe back (we are a family of 3) and used only beef (which was funny because my freezer was mostly full of beef and pork meatloaf mix but I had pulled out only beef this morning to make chili).  My daughter who only likes my usual version of chili (which uses tomato juice) loved it even with all the veggies she doesn't normally eat.  I did add a bit more cumin (can't get enough of it!) The lime juice, tequila and beer (luckily I had a Corona on hand) really gave it nice flavor! Thanks for a great recipe I'll use from now on!

Very good chili.  Had an ample amount of veggies but they didn't overwhelm the meat.  The Serrano peppers I used were incredibly hot so I halved the quantity of Serrano peppers when I put them in.  I wonder if the reviewers who say this isn't spicy used jalapeno peppers because Serrano peppers are hotter.  That was the only change I made to this recipe.
