In my opinion this was kind of bland as is but after some doctoring up, this turned out to be a delicious side dish.  I used half wild rice and half white and added some sauteed carrots, onions and celery that I cooked until tender in equal amounts of butter and olive oil.  I also added a package of "fruitlings" which are chopped up bits of dried fruit and a handful of slivered almonds and tossed the mixture well.  This was much more flavorful and even though I didn't follow the recipe, I ended up creating a family favorite.  Thanks for the staring poing Brandi.

After reading all the rave reviews I can't believe how blah this dish is. I think my mistake was using a suggested 1/3 white rice and 3/4 wild rice. The white rice turned to mush. I cooked the rice in beef broth. When done, I added onion, garlic, and celery cooked tender in a little olive oil along with the peas, cranberries, and toasted walnuts. Nothing saved it. It's still mush. I think with fluffy wild rice it would have been very good, just don't use white rice.

This is a very good start for a delicious side dish. I cooked rice mixture in chicken broth, added toasted slivered almonds, minced green onion and garlic. Yummy!

I like this dish.  Wild rice needs some help and this does it.  I didn't have peas so I saut√©ed a stalk of celery and three cloves of garlic instead as one reviewer suggested and put a beef bullion cube in with the rice.  The cranberries really give this dimension.  I'll try it with peas next time but keep the celery and garlic.

I took the suggestion of other reviewers and used half white rice and half wild rice.  I cooked in chicken broth for extra flavor and added about 4 chopped green onions at the end.  Very flavorful and nice texture between the chewy dried cranberries and fresh crunch of the green onions I added.

blah and boring. I first tried and tasted nothing so then I  added onions, garlic, some herbs, nuts, etc.... then it was finally okay.  But by then it was my own new recipe.

I took Josie's advice and added a bit of white rice (1/4 white to 3/4 wild). Also added the carrots, etc. she suggested. We loved the recipe and it was actually better the second day!

This had good flavor....I think the cranberries should be in smaller pieces.  They were a turn off.
