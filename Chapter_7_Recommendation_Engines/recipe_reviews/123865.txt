I chose this recipe over the others because it was 2/3 C brown sugar (instead of 1 C) and 2 C semi-sweet chips (instead of 1 C or milk chocolate).  My only suggestion is that these bars be baked at 350 (not 325) like the other recipes like this one suggest.  I baked mine at 325 for 35 minutes and they were still a bit raw in the center and they are hard to "test" for doneness due to the gooeyness of the marshmallows.  Very yummy though!  Will be making again.

After reading a number of reviews it became clear that those who really like these brownies are those, like Hubs, who like their desserts rich, gooey and intensely sweet.  And chocolate doesn’t hurt either.  Me, not so much – because these are rich, gooey and intensely sweet.  I lined my pan with foil for ease in removing them from the pan and cutting.  Baking them at 350 degrees for 25 minutes was perfect.  I  threw these together last night in the time it took Hubs to fall asleep in front of the TV – now that’s fast!  They turned out perfectly and this morning they were all ready to cut and package.  At Hubs' request I did leave out the nuts but in this case I actually think these would have been better with the nuts to balance out the sweetness.  An easy, quick solution to satisfy a huge sweet tooth.

Loved these!! The only thing I did differently was I left out the nuts. They are hard to tell when they are done because of the marshmallows - I took them out and looked at the bottom. Will definatley make these again!!

Amazing brownies, made these for an anniversary present for my husband. Made exactly as written except for adding almost 1/2C of cocoa powder so they wouldn't be blond brownies. DELICIOUS! I'd like to add that I baked mine at 325 for 25 minutes and they were perfect, maybe it was because I used a glass dish?

HOLY SMOKES BATMAN!  These are amazing!!!  I have never had such a yummy, ooeey, gooeey, tasty treat!  These are perfect if made as written.  I am going to try and only use a 1/2 cup brown sugar next time because they were plenty sweet.  It may not work but it's worth a try.  Also, I agree with baking them at 350, I had to bake an extra 10 minutes at 325.  YUMM-O!

I was trying to use up some mini marshmallows and this recipe fit the bill.  However by following the recipe they are a sloppy mess.  I cooked them for 25 min at 325.  They definitely need a longer higher temp.  I may try them again tomorrow.  As they are they are only usable as ice cream topping.  they are also way too sweet!...And I love sugar.

This recipe is fantastic!!  I made this for a dessert potluck for work and everyone kept oohing and aahing about how yummy and gooey it was!  When I first brought it out of the oven I thought it was undercooked but when you give it a day to cool, the result is perfect!

Awesome brownies.  It is hard to tell if they are done due to the gooeyness of the marshmallow and chocolate, so pay attention to them cuz I could see it being easy to burn.  If you like a rich dessert, then go for it.  These brownies are worth it

Ok, I was actually looking for a chocolate brownie with gooey marshmallows in them.  This really should not be called a brownie.  It's more like those "magic cookie bars" except without the coconut. It was tasty but not what the title states.  More like a blondie not a brownie.

I made these all summer for various events/occassions and they are always a big hit - everyone loves them!.  I think they are more of a bar cookie than a brownie though.  Followed recipe exactly except I cooked 350 degrees for 25 minutes.  They need to set up so don't get alarmed if they don't look done when you take them out.

These are more like a blondie or a butterscotch bar than a brownie but they are very good. After reading the reviews i was reluctant because i always tend to undercook bars and brownies so what i did was to cook them at 325 for 40 minutes.(i resisted the temptation to check them or stick a toothpick in them which was not easy for me) Lol. I just took them out after 40 min. and let them cool.  They were perfectly done(I did it)! A little difficult to cut but with a wet knife, it wasn't too bad. I would definately make these again.

Not a fan at all, I thought at least my husband or my brother would eat them, not the case.  The marshmallows gave it a weird texture.  They looked great, they just didn't suit our taste.  I couldn't find anyone to eat them, so I ended up throwing them away.
