As fantastic as this recipe is as written I've found it to be versatile as well. I had some left over roasted chicken and decide I wanted to make a quick chicken salad out of. I reduced the menu for 4 servings and used: 1/2 tsp of McCormick Garlic and Herb seasoning in place of Fresh Rosemary. 1/2 Cup of chopped almonds instead of walnuts. 1/4 cup of Feta instead of Blue Cheese. I didn't add any salt because of the saltiness of the Feta but did use fresh cracked black pepper. What a fantastic recipe! It would work great as an appetizer or a dip and the only thing that I might seriously consider adding to it would be a tbsp or a 1/4 cup of raisuns to it. Toasted wheat bread or crescent rolls with lettuce and tomato for a great sandwhich. I highly recommend this recipe both "as is " or to experiment with!

This was very good. Reviewers who found the rosemary to be overwhelming may not have been using fresh rosemary -- if you are going to use dried rosemary you need to reduce the amount to one teaspoon. My husband doesn't like nuts so I left them out of his portion. He tried one bite with walnuts in it; he agreed that the walnuts are needed to balance the intensity of the blue cheese taste but thought perhaps raisins might do the same thing. I might add some halved grapes or some raisins next time.

This was delicious! I didn't have the walnuts so I added chopped cashews instead which worked quite well for me. I also added a single serving sized tin of drained fruit cocktail for added taste. I will definitely be making it again and may just add toasted sesame seeds as well. I took the accompanying photo and that is tomato aspic on the side. (Recipe for that is under review!)

I liked this a lot but I think the rosemary was a bit out of place. Other than the rosemary I think this was a real hit!

I was a little disappointed with this recipe. I thought I would love the combination of ingredients but it was way too nutty. I couldn't finish it because all I could taste were the walnuts. If they were decreased to maybe 1/2 cup this would have been good.

Very very good! I used pre-cooked chicken strips (Oscar Meyer) because I didn't have fresh chicken on hand and added the lemon juice and zest to the chicken anyway. My fiance said it was the best chicken salad that he ever had! We'll be buying more chicken and plan on making more for lunches next week. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is not something I usually make. I followed the recipe exactly. I is very good but has too much of a mustard taste for me. Hubby loved it and made a sandwich for dinner last night of it. Next time I think I will cut down the mustard to just a tiny bit. Overall very good and will make again.

I made a few personal tweaks but used this recipe as the basis for my chicken salad and LOVED it. I didn't include the bleu cheese or the celery and added some additional herbs for seasoning. It was AWESOME. I typically add relish to chicken salads but this was so savory and perfect I decided not to. Tip: I used the leftover chicken broth to make a gravy by adding Worcestershire sauce soy sauce and flour (for thickening). This recipe makes an awesome base for gravy - highly recommended!
