This works pretty well. I found that by waiting for the fondant to cool down a bit before pouring help with consistency.

I use this recipe for petit fours and it works really well to coat the sides. The first time I made it I was careful with the temperature but now I just stir it until it gets to be the right consistency. It works just fine if you overheat it by a little bit but it won't dry with the same shine. Great recipe!

I'm actually wavering between three and four stars for this recipe.  I used a candy thermometer and was shocked at how far over 92 degrees I had to heat this fondant up.  Eventually though, it seemed ready and I used it to pour over my son's cake.  It looked fine until I noticed that a lot of it was clear with fine granules of chocolate in it, which gave the appearance, at first glance, of opacity.  Ultimately, I figured nobody was going to be examining the fondant that closely, so I didn't toss out the fondant or my cake.  The consistency and pourability was just great.  When I tasted it, though, I felt that there may have been some undissolved granules... I can't be sure, though, since I used some colored sugars on the cake also.  I'm not the most skilled at recipes like this, so the shortcomings in my success may be my own fault.

I made this recipe the first time and it came out ok.  I thought about it and read the other reviews and made it again with a couple of changes and it came out PERFECT!
I cooked the sugar/water/corn syrup mixture over low like it says, I stirred it CONSTANTLY until it reached 110 degrees. 
The second change I made was I melted my chocolate BEFORE I added it to the sugar  mixture and I reduced the almond extract to 3/4 tsp.
I then stirred the mixture until it cooled slightly to the consistancy I wanted to pour.
These changes gave me a smooth and shiny finished product that went over my tiny cakes beautifully.
When I use it on things bigger than petits fours I will first give my cakes a crumb coating of buttercream frosting.  This gives the fondant a smoother and prettier finish.

Worked well the first time and served my purpose as a coating for some chocolate dessert bars. I didn't use a thermometer, but heated the mixture just barely enough to melt the chocolate and keep it pourable.

This fondant was not what I was expecting. Maybe I didn't get it to the right temp, but it was thick, and didn't pour. It also ended up crystalizing very quickly, and I had to throw the batch away! Maybe I need a new candy thermometer?

I love this recipe if you make sure to not overcook the chocolate, or it loses the shine a bit.  Overall though, if you just get it to a pourable consistency it works out just fine.  Can be a little hard to spread evenly though so try to pour over flat even surfaces and lay down a layer of frosting first to help even out the fondant and help it stick.

I found this to be a great recipe for covering a cake maybe, but for petit fours, I had to add some milk to it to thin it out a bit. I didn't find it thin enough to pour over petit fours.

the chocolate doesn't ever melt so that it's uniformly brown, but rather white with brown speckles.  Tastes fine, but I won't use this again.

This is a great chocolate frosting - very easy and nice to pour over a double-layer cake.  It's very sweet, but also very delicious.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Did not taste like chocolate and was not smooth but chalky texture. I used a instant read thermometer with an alarm so I know the moment it got it to temp. Will be deleted from my my list. Used a chocolate mirror glaze perfect!
