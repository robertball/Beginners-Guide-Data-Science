Tasted great! This is a good recipe to use up all of the leftover ingredients  from Thanksgiving. I never use all of the potatoes, carrots, and celery that I buy. I added fresh rosemary, sage, and thyme to the soup since I still had herbs left over from Thanksgiving, too.

I like this simple day after Thanksgiving soup. It's a great way of using left over vegetables and herbs. I can relax as I stir my soup ! No fuss.

I made this vary similar but added baby spinach and fresh parsley at the end and turned thee heat off. I set aside some to freeze and then added 1/2 cup broken whole wheat linguini to the rest of the soup and boiled for around 10 minutes.  Very wholesome.

I made it with red potatoes with skin on. Seems to me the photo shows potatoes with skin, but recipe said to peel potatoes.  I used about 1/3 beef broth and 2/3 chicken broth.  Got the beef broth idea from another allrecipes recipe.  I also added some corn starch at end of cooking to thicken it.  Soup was delicious.

Very flavorful and filling. I reduced the cooking time to about an hour, just until the vegetables are tender.

A great blend of flavors especially with the potatoes. I added the celery to the hot bowl of soup for a little crunch.
