I just finished decorating these and they are fabulous! I decorated them all different ways following a video I saw at joyofbaking after googling rum balls. I liked the ease of this recipe better than that one. So I decorated some with powdered sugar and some with unsweetened cocoa powder (both best sifted) And then I melted some chocolate chips in the microwave and (after the rum balls had been in the fridge for a while) rolled some in that. Of the chocolate ones I (immediately!) sprinkled crushed nuts on some of them. And the others, after putting back in the fridge to set, I melted white chocolate and did a small design on the top. The presentation is amazing even with my lack of decorating talent.

This was really good and really easy! I've never made rum balls before so I didn't realize there are so many different recipes out there. These are nice and rich, exactly what I was looking for.
They've now been in my fridge for 2 days and I'll be bringing them to a party tomorrow night. 
I didn't put them on wax paper or in a bag with icing sugar, I just rolled them up and then dipped half in coconut and half in cocoa (next time I'll coat a third in icing sugar to give people even more variety.)
No fuss, no mess, no baking and you only use the stove for 5 minutes. Thanks a lot for this recipe!

Delicious! I did chicken out and use a little less rum, which I thought made them perfect, but hubby said he would like me to add more rum next time...go figure, lol. I do believe these will get stronger the loner that they sit though, so I think he'll be happier in the end. I didn't shake them in the bag w/ powdered sugar, I just rolled them in the powdered sugar on a plate, and that worked well. I will def be making these again...they were very easy and yummy! Thanks for sharing. :)

Very simple recipe. Let them sit in the fridge for a few hours before you sample them. The flavor keeps getting better with each passing day. I used 2 cups of powdered sugar and I also used dark chocolate chips. This will work with a variety of other spirits. I intend to try this with Rumple Minze, Cointreau, etc. Update 11/26/17--I have also made these with orange liqueur (Paula's Texas Orange) and raspberry liqueur (Drillaud). These have been very well received every year I've made them. I have always used the 3/4 cup of booze that the recipe uses.

this was something new for me to make for the holidays but I remembered how good they were.  While in Tech school in the Air Force (years ago) a buddy's grandmother had sent them to him and I was lucky enough to be able to try them, all  remember was Wow there's some rum in those!  After trying a few other recipes without coming close to what I remembered I saw this recipe and thought,  Hmmm this one has 3 times the rum of the other recipes.  I didn't have Meyers dark rum but I had Captain Morgan and tried it.  These are what I remember having years earlier, very good. I received compliments from everyone that had them.  I do think next year I use just a little more rum and make it Sailor Jerry since it's 92 proof to boost them up a little bit.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

Best recipe ive tasted.  And very easy to do in a hurry.  
I did find that refrigerating between doing up and rolling 
Into balls was not necessary. At the party i had to make
another double batch while everyone watched and
waited for more.  Good stuff, Maynard!

There are so many different rum ball recipes out there, I wasn't sure which to try!  I opted for this recipe because it didn't include nuts, and uses chocolate instead of just cocoa powder. I think these rum balls are more fudge-like and less gritty than others I've tried.

A couple of things that might be helpful to others who try the recipe:

My box of Nilla wafers was only 11oz, so I ended up adding two graham crackers (the equivalent of 1oz) to give me the full 12oz of cookie crumbs.  I don't know if that was necessary, but if you get a couple extra rum balls out of it, it doesn't hurt, right?  

Chocolate can be easy to scorch, so I would recommend melting your chocolate in a double-boiler.  An easy way to fake a double boiler is to put a couple of inches of water into a sauce pan and then set a similarly sized Pyrex bowl on top of it, so that your bowl is resting on the top rim of your pan. The boiling water in the pot gently heats your bowl, allowing your chocolate to melt without risk of burning it.  

For booze, I used a combination of Captain Morgan's Spiced Rum and Tuaca.

As a personal preference, I used honey instead of corn syrup and added a couple of dashes of cinnamon. I think they added complexity to the flavor.

I rolled the rum balls in granulated sugar because I like the look of it better, and it's less messy to eat.

P.S.  I highly recommend wearing food-safe gloves when rolling out your rum balls.  No one wants to eat your skin cells in their dessert.

This was my first time making rum balls and I must say that this recipe was great!  Not too sure why there aren't more reviews...I am definitely making these again for my guests over Christmas.  Give 'em a try, you won't be disappointed!  Hope this helps!  :)

Made these for an office cookie exchange and they were a huge hit.  They are like alcoholic truffles.  Warning, there is definitely a strong rum flavor to these so I recommend either making them smaller, say a half-inch, or limiting yourself to only eating one.  Also, I used plain white rum.  Next time I will use a more flavorful rum like the recommended Myer's Dark since the rum flavor comes through so strongly.

This rum ball is a delicious treat, and I love that it does not include nuts!  Besides making this treat as written, I also have substituted white chocolate chips for the semisweet.  These have become a holiday tradition at my home. :-)

These were very fun to make. Although my husband absolutely loved them I think there was a teeny bit too much rum. Next time I make them I will probably half the rum.

These are a cross between fudge and a rum ball. Very yummy. I found the fudge was still way too sticky to form good balls after a half hour. I waited closer to an hour. My husband and I agree these are stellar!

These have waaaayyy more than "a kick"!!! I'm a drinker from Milwaukee and they were too much even for me!  I think it was likely the strong, off-putting rum I used??? Use somthing you would drink and do NOT use Bacardi Black.  At the store I'm thinking "why is this so much cheaper than Bacardi Silver and Gold?" It's gross, that's why. I did have some people gobble them up, all of whom are fairly heavy drinkers. I joked that these are my nitroglycerin balls..... I will try this again because I like that they are nut free and I DO want a kick.  But next time I will reach for Meyer's rum like recommended.  Also, the dough may seem very sticky like you need more cookie crumbs, but it firms up after chilling for 15 min or so. I put rum soaked cherries in the center of them too. Well no wonder they were strong.....duh!!

This is a great and easy recipe.  I used Kahlua instead of regular rum and they still came out great. Being a middle child this got my mom's attention, and even she was pleased. Now I'm her #1.

I made these for our holiday party at work and they were very good.  I reduced the rum to 1/2 cup so that they weren't too strong.  I rolled some in powdered sugar, some in unsweetened cocoa powder, and some in regular sugar.  The ones rolled in regular sugar seemed to be the favorite.

I made these over the holidays as gifts for friends and they were a huge hit!  I used Meyer's rum as specified and they were absolutely delicious.  The rum smell was a bit overpowering the first day so I was worried they'd be too strong, but they definitely mellowed out over the next couple of days.  These are also great at room temperature or cold if you choose to refrigerate them - basically it was like having an indulgent truffle with a little kick from the rum.  I will definitely be making these again!

The Vanilla Wafers I could get were only 11 oz instead of 12 which I think reflected the amount of time it took to make the dough solid enough to form.  I did use 60% cocoa chips instead and they came out really good! Thanks for a good recipe.

I made these  just now and made them  according to the directions given   The batter turn out to be a consistency  of Brownie Mix.    I put the batter into the frig like it said for 15 minutes.  I took it out of the frig and and the batter was very thick like brownie mix.  I used a cookie scoop to roll into balls and I simply could not roll them.  I just use the cookie scoop and scooped them out of the pot and put on a dusty sheet of parchment paper which sat on top of a plate(like the directions tell you.)  I put them in the frig to get hard and they are still very gooey and not that firm. UPDATE: after letting the batter cool in the frig for a day, i was able to roll the batter much better into balls and put them on  a paper plate and dusted them with powdered sugar.  My wife loved them and I tried one also and they turned out great.  I would use 1/2 cup of rum next time instead of the 3/4 the recipe called for.

Excellent easy rum balls! The rum balls turned out really well. I added more Nilla wafers than were called for because my dough was too sticky. Once I added enough crumbs, they firmed up well in the fridge. I put red and green sugar on the outside for Christmas.

Easy, excellent rum balls. I substituted bittersweet chocolate for semisweet. Also added tablespoon of sea salt.

I used 5 oz of Kraken rum and 1oz of St. Germain liqueur. Quite delightful.

I used Bacardi dark rum.. figured like a wine, use what you would drink.  These are amazing for the rum lover or secrete rum lover!  I even dusted some with cocoa powder and powdered sugar.  Would highly recommend

i am now making my 3rd batch. Great rum kick. I did add ground up nuts but the recipe would be just as good without them. I ended up using a little more confectioners sugar to soak up some of the stickiness and also left the concoction in the refrigerator for about 4 hours before shaping into balls. The challenge will be not to eat any before giving them as Christmas presents.

Boozy sugar bombs, these were just not for us.  It tasted more like rum fudge than anything.  Nostalgia made me make this, but I recall more of a cake texture than this.  Just not my thing.

Made it?  I made it twice!  This was an awesomely easy recipe.  I had so many compliments.  It's an 'easy travel' thing to bring to  a party.   Stores in a ziplock..... :)

I used Cruzan Black Cherry rum which gave them the flavour of a cherry blossom. I also rolled them in shredded coconut vs icing sugar.

Melted chocolate in the microwave in a pyrex measuring cup with the corn syrup.  Used dark chocolate chips.  Added walnuts which had been chopped fine in food processor.  Great recipe.

These are awesome! I usually use Myers Dark Rum. But to change it up, try using another alcohol (Amaretto or whiskey) if you're not a big rum fan, or use Malibu Rum for a milder flavor, then roll in coconut flakes (instead of sugar). And I roll the balls in granulated sugar as opposed to powdered sugar.

Made these for a cold night tailgate.  They were perfect. Great flavor, excellent rum kick.  Nearly everyone asked for the recipe.
Will be a staple in my tailgate and pot luck repertoire.

I'm all about easy. And these were about as easy as they come! Made these today for a rum tasting party on Tuesday. It was suggested that they be made a few days ahead of time to let the flavor really come thru. Couldn't resist eating one while bagging them up. OMG! I will be making these again. Thanks Matt for sharing your recipe.

I'm now required to make these every Christmas season by everyone at work!  I tried other recipes, this is by far the best - and the most "rummy"!

We usually use an overproof rum, but reduce the amount to 1/2 cup. They are very boozy, and a huge hit. I have a list of people requesting them every Christmas!

I started to make these but couldn't bring myself to add corn syrup and a full cup of confectioner's sugar to an already very sweet mixture. So I added 1/4 cup melted butter instead of all that sugar and cut down the rum to 1/2 cup. Overall they came out pretty good but not great.

Despite loving alcoholic desserts even with the rum reduced to 1/2 cup, everyone who tried them thought the smell/taste of alcohol was very pronounced..
