These brownies are kick-you-in-the-rear delicious!  After brushing the kahlua on top, let them sit overnight.  The alcohol will evaporate an all the flavors soak in.  They are SO GOOD!  I took the recipe to an annual bake-day with some friends.  None of the brownies even made it out the door!  Kudos to the chef!

I must say, since white russians are my drink of choice, I couldn't wait to try this recipe.  I'm sorry to say that I think it's awful.  I used an 8X8 pan instead of a 9X9, and I barely had enough chocolate to cover the bottom of the pan, let alone to split in half.  And the cream cheese layer was HUGE, entirely too much.  Perhaps if the taste were more balanced, but you really need more chocolate to be able to call this a brownie, it consists mostly of the cream cheese. It is very sticky and gooey and stuck to the pan, despite greasing and flouring.  I'll never make this again.

Mmmm...Great moist brownies. I halfed the cream cheese like recommended by others but next time may make the full amount as I thought that was the best part of the recipe. The only problem was the cooking time. Like others have said before, after the recommended cooking time, the outside was cooked while the middle was gooey. I made  a "ring" of foil (like when cooking pie crusts in the oven to prevent the edges from burning) and covered the cooked outside portion (exposing the uncooked portions) and put back in the oven, checking continuously until cooked. Although it was a pain, the results were fantastic. The taste of the chocolate and cream cheese was similar to black-bottomed cupcakes my mom always used to make.

Made these today for my wife and I.  Only had 8oz of cream cheese, so I halved that layer and did not brush with coffee liquor after cooking.  Turned out great!  Used an 8X8 pan, so they were nice and thick.  Cooked for 35 minutes and were done perfectly.  May use slightly less vodka next time.  Overall very good!!!

FANTASTIC after I followed the suggestions of halving the cream cheese filling.  I even baked this in a 8x12 cake pan and it turned out great after 35 minutes in the oven.  Even though it was hard to spread, I felt that it was truly a brownie's thickness when done that way.  I was very satisfied.  The only different thing I did the second time I made these was increase the amount of vodka in the chocolate mixture by about 3 Tablespoons, since I felt that it was a little weak in the alcoholic taste.   Finally, I heavily recommend oiling the pan well.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I hated it and my husband liked it so I refrained from rating it. After using half the bowls in my kitchen, I found the recipe to have too little chocolate mixture and too much cream cheese mixture. It overcooked the outsides while the the inside remained gooey. And the taste wasn't worth raving about in the least. I was terribly dissapointed. My husband said it was like eating cheesecake inside a cookie sandwich, so he liked it.

WOW!!! If the finished product tastes anything like the batter, this stuff is awesome! I only used one 8 oz package of cream cheese instead of two.

Tips: Bake at 350 for 40 minutes and the brownies will be perfectly done. Ease up on the vodca in the cream cheese. Once you have the layers in place use a knife to swirl all three together, then detail the top with a toothpick.

i liked the idea of these, but i didn't like the result. WAY too much cheese mixture in the middle and it didn't get solid for me -- even after putting them in the oven a second time!
cut the cream cheese down to 1 brick, DON'T soak the top with liquor, DO swirl or slightly mix the top two layers. good luck...

Very good-I sprinkled swirled chocolate chips on top...a little too much cream cheese...Definitely cook for longer than it says, though!! I had to throw it back in after taking it out. Could be a little more chocolate-y, too. Overall a big crown pleaser!!!

For some reason I tend to produce disastrous brownies time after time. These were quite good though - the bits I cut from the edges I mean, as I baked for 35 minutes and it wasn't enough at all. I decreased the cream cheese layer by half and just added all the coffee liqueur to the batter - very nice flavour!

Used 1/2 regular & 1/2 fat-free cream cheese, Kahlua for the coffee liqueur, and a regular 9x13 pan. Brownie was very thick and hard to stir/pour. I forgot to brush additional Kahlua on top afterwards but it still tasted good...even better when heated and served with vanilla ice cream! I thought the brownie layer looked thinner than the cream cheese layer so I'll perhaps double up on the brownie next time. Remember to wait until the brownie cools to cut. Wiping the knife with a damp cloth after each cut will prevent brownie from sticking to the knife and making a mess. Brownies became softer and more flavorful after storing in an airtight container overnight.

I actually enjoyed this brownie. However, I am a health nut and felt uncomfortable serving a dessert with almost 500 calories per serving. So instead of sugar, I substituted Splenda. I also used fat free cream cheese instead of full fat cream cheese. I also used only 1/2 pound of cream cheese and cut the amount of vodka in half. Very delicious and a much healthier version!!

I used the full 16 oz of cream cheese, but subbed milk for the vodka. The cream cheese layer was just okay, but the brownie layer really was lacking in flavor. Brushing the top with the kahlua helped a these a lot, but 4 of 5 in my household gave these brownies 
a thumbs down.

I made these for my study group and got mixed reviews.  They either really liked them or they did not like them at all.  They did not fully cook in the middle, prehaps adding foil would have allowed them to finish cooking without burning.  I did not brush with Kahlua in the end.  I thought that they were a bit to alcohol tasting, next time I would use less vodka.

Came out great. Just the right amout of booze. I did only have half the cream cheese available but that was just right. It was a rich 'brownie' after all. I also reduced the sugar to about 3/4 of the recipe as I don't like things too sweet.

Tasted great - not a traditional brownie for sure. The second time I made these I was out of coffee flavored liqueur, so I subbed in some Brendan's Irish Cream. Still good.

This is a rich and flavorful brownie.  It can be made more family friendly by not soaking it in Khalua - though this is a brilliant touch. Easy awesome, company-worthy!

These have to be the best brownies I've ever tasted. They were phenomenal! I baked 'em for a Christmas party and they were wolfed down! The only major problem I had was dealing with the cream cheese, but once I added the liquid, it was a lot easier.  I'm definitely going to make these again! Thanks for the recipe!
