As written I agree with others that this recipe for "mock mashed potatoes" would be mediocre at best. Whether you steam, boil, or microwave the cauliflower doesn't matter -- what's important is that it be cooked until VERY tender and that it be VERY dry before mixing in the other ingredients. Canola oil would be nasty in my opinion, and non-fat milk is not a good option either.  Mix in just enough softened cream cheese (maybe 2 ozs.) and a very little butter, heavy cream and/or sour cream and puree in food processor (or blender, or hand mixer). Be light-handed with the cream as very little, if any, is needed.  Too much and believe me, you'll end up with soup! Nice additions would be chives or roasted garlic, but that isn't even necessary. If you don't serve this immediately, place in a buttered, shallow casserole and bake at 375 degrees for about 15-20 minutes. This is a wonderful way to make cauliflower if prepared properly.

steaming as opposed to boiling is VERY important. I also use butter, a little cream cheese and cheddar cheese in the processor. It takes this over the top. I do not use oil or add milk, it makes it too thin. But I have to tell you, I did not like cauliflower  at all before tasting "whipped cauliflower".

I microwaved the cauliflower in a saran wrap covered bowl for 12 minutes, then put it in the blender with Tony Chachere's, margarine, and sour cream (didn't have any milk).  I added shredded cheese and microwaved to let that melt, and some bacon bits to it when it was done.

Well, cauliflower requires an accustomed taste, but know that cauliflower is one of the top shelf cancer-fighters so it remains a staple for its anti-oxidant properties.  This dish is easily doctored for any taste albeit the "Five ingredient goal".  Sauteed onion and garlic definitely adds essential flavor.  Cheese gives it a good kick.  Chive or toher herbs or wasabi or a sprinkling of sugar may also be added.  I think that those who do not like this are tricked by eye: palate.  If you're looking for potatoes, make potatoes already.

Roasting method is much better.  Chop cauliflower coarsely. Using 2 sheets of foil, spray the bottom sheet, lay chopped cauliflower on that, then cover w/other sheet of foil.  Seal sides making a package.  Roast for 20 min @ 450, then carefully remove top sheet of foil and back into the oven for another 15 minutes, or until tender.  Season and continue with food processor.

I added a little sour cream for flavor and used my potato masher instead of a food proccessor. They tasted great but were slightly lumpy.

It would also taste better with heavy cream and butter. I like to add a bit of sour cream and gruyere cheese, too.

Eh, this was ok. I had to doctor it up so it had some flavor.  The cauliflower itself is a little bit sweeter than i was looking for... so I roasted some garlic cloves and sauted some onions w/ some fresh rosemary and added everything to the whipped cauliflower.

I love cauliflower so I was surprised at how terrible this dish tasted, it didn't even smell good. I ate a few bites, but no one else would.  I thought it was a waste of a good cauliflower head and the water needed to clean the dishes!

I used butter instead of canola, liberal splashes of garlic & onion powder. Regular pepper instead of white. Put it in a 300 degree oven with a bit of cheddar cheese on top. Yum, it was stinky, but actually pretty good. Next time I'm going to make some regular potatoes & mix. I think I can fool the kids this way.

I have made this out of the South Beach Diet before and love this recipe.  DH has asked for this several times.  I am only giving it 4 stars because I would never put canola oil in it, there would be danger of turning this dish into soup.  I have used margarine instead.  I have also added a little dried garlic, chives, onion, and greek seasoning.  This can be altered to fit whatever you usually make your mashed potatoes with.

This was a winner!  My VERY fussy husband ate these and liked them (not knowing what they were!) He walked in the door and thought he smelled broccoli,but I told him no broccoli tonight!  I followed the reviewers tips and added garlic powder to cauliflower as it steamed, little butter, cream cheese (tablespoon of each) spoon of sour cream and 1/4 cup cheddar cheese all while processing.  Then I baked it as shepherd's pie.  CAME OUT GREAT!  My equally fussy 8 year old ate it up without question!  TRY THIS!

I'm dairy free so I used soy milk instead of the fat free milk and I did not care for it. It may be the soy milk taste, but this was not a suitable substitution for mashed potatoes in my opinion

After all my changes, it's not really the same thing, but it was great!

I cooked the cauliflower the same way, but used margerine instead of canola oil and sour cream instead of milk; I added about 1/4c grated parmesan and used a potato masher.  I think it's a  great substitute for mashed potatoes/

Pretty good. I used a combination cauliflower and broccoli, while opting to steam instead of boil. did my best to remove as much moisture as I could before adding to my blender (my food processor is too small). I switched out the oil for garlic butter in an equal amount (perfect to finish my little container!) and under a quarter cup of heavy cream. Had trouble blending, and only have salmon-flavoured cream cheese, I said let's just do it. I used under 2oz. of it and it was just enough to help blend. You don't taste any salmon flavour at all in the end product (phew!) and it was just the right texture you'd expect from 'mashed' veggies. Went well as side to a beef roast.

These turned out fabulously and tasted great! I sprinkled them with garlic powder while steaming, transferred them to my food processor, added a bit (too much, in hind sight) of milk, butter, more garlic powder and cracked pepper (makes them look more like mashed potatoes).

I thought this was great.  The only change I made was in adding 1 oz of butter spray in addition to the milk.  It really did taste like mashed potatoes!

This dish was ok, very bland and it really needs something.
