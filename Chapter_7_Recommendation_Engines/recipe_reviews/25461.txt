This was a nice change from the usual soy based marinades for steak.  I used minced garlic vs. garlic powder and since I didn't have fines herbs I used a blend of parsley, tarragon, and marjoram.  I used this on a sirloin steak and let it marinate for 10 hours. It had a nice flavor and the wine didn't overpower it.  It also had a nice sweetness that came through.  Overall, very good.

Delicious, I used a pre-packaged mix of sea salt and spices.  I also substituted clover honey for regular honey. Delicious!

This marinade is very flavorful.  I followed the recipe, but used a suggestion from a previous reviewer to not use honey.  The mixture of red wine, teriyaki, and mustard was the perfect mix without any standing out too strong.  It was sweet enough, so I think eliminating the honey was a good move.  I used Soy Vay as my teriyaki sauce.  I would definitely make this again.

Good marinade.  I used fresh onion and garlic.  Also, The only Teriyaki sauce I had on hand was already sweetened.  I did not take that into consideration before adding the honey.  Next time I will use unsweetened Teriyaki or cut the honey considerably.  All in all a good recipe.  Cooks error with the sweetness.  Thanks

I marindaded the meat for 10 hours....not bad, but could have used a little more wine.  I also used Dijon mustard since I didn't have any spice brown which made a good substitute.
