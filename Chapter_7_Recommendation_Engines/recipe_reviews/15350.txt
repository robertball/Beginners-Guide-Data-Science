This recipe is a flop.  It is not like  rice crispy treats.  The proportions are wrong.  The butter marshmallow mixture is runny and deflates the popcorn into an unchewable mess.

Very good! Kids loved em too! My littlest one even wanted to take them to school when it was her day to take treats. 8 or so cups of popped corn is what I used. I think 2 is a typo.

This turned out great!  I ended up using six cups of popcorn instead of two. Very easy to make. It reminds me of the chocolate covered popcorn that I bought from the boy scouts.

Just made this! Adding red food coloring for holiday fun & I used holiday M&M's and they looked adorable. Pulled out my old air popper for the first time in ages, not sure how much poped popcorn I had, about 6-8 cups (1/2 cup unpopped)it was perfect. I had no problem with the balls keeping shape, I just used lots of butter on my hands and took from the top of the pan (cooler) shaped in to palm sized balls and set on wax paper to set up. Thanks! I think I will make a green batch to go with it for neighbor treats!!

There should be more than two cups of popcorn in this recipe. Mine came out too marshmallow-y. They just need more popcorn.

I just made a bunch of these just now for my sons birthday party tomorrow I didn't use the chocolate bits though, I used sour candies. They taste GREAT! They stuck together very well, I added a bit more marshmallows though, just because we like them chewy. But all around a good recipe.

We made these popcorn balls as an activity in the group home I work in.  After following other suggestions of using less mashmallow (we used half a bag), chewy caramel bites and 3 bags of microwave popcorn we decided these were a hit.  Such a hit in fact that I'm making them for nieces and nephews for Halloween!

We didn't have any candy coated chocolate pieces, but had a taste for candy popcorn, so made this without them. We did add a dash of nutmeg. It was pretty good and we'll make again with the candy pieces.

I made these "snowballs" for a Cub Scout meeting and they turned out great. I added more popcorn to the mix to make it less marshmallow-y and to make the batch go further.

Definitely increase the popcorn to 6-8 popped cups!  I added candy corn to mine instead of chocolate.  It was YUMMY!

these were sooo good. we added green dye to the melted marshmallow mixture to make them even more fun. i was able to spray my 5 and 4 yr olds hands with pam and had them shape them into balls for a fun summer activity! these were so good!!! i was able to make about 20 bigger than my hand balls but i used about 4-5 cups popped popcorn and the same amounts of butter and marshmallows. this is a new family favorite!

We just tried this recipe after looking for things to do with an abundance of marshmallows in the pantry.  My son suggested trying CHOCOLATE marshmallow.  I ended up using a whole (10 oz.) bag of chocolate and 1/2 bag of regular large marshmallows (or approx. 6 oz.).
I probably ended up using at least 10 cups of popcorn (microwave) and cannot imagine the recipe with only two.  I must say that these are surprisingly pretty good.  They ain't pretty and I would suggest a very large pot and a strong arm!!!  The kids will love them and we will try without chocolate marshmallows one day.

I had such high hopes for this recipe.  I thought to myself when reading the other poor reviews, "nah, won't happen to me, my popcorn balls will be fabulous."  But alas, I was wrong, very wrong.  I used 8 cups of popped popcorn based on other reviews (and yes, 2 cups would not have worked).  The popcorn balls were very unattractive, though that I could have dealt with, but the taste - the popcorn became chewy/soggy the way popcorn gets when it gets wet and no amount of marshmallow or butter or choclate pieces could cover that up.  =(  I so wanted this to work!

Perfect! I made a batch of these for my daycare and let them make their own. Just let them cool enough for a lil ones hands & I floured their hands and let em'at it! It was the best idea! And in the end it's not a horrible treat either!   If you see that's it's too marshmallow'y just add more popcorn if you don't have any more popcorn any dry cereal will do. It's supposed to be fun and any extra color will make it more festive.

These were not my favourite. The chocolate candies melted and made them look very unappealing. Others loved them though.

I added a bit of chocolate, and maybe that's what ruined 'em...  They just weren't firm enough to shape into balls.

I grew up making this and love it. We always used one package of mini marshmallows (400g) and 20 cups of popcorn (with 1/2 cup margarine). It's too sticky if you use less. You can press it into a 9X11 greased pan and pat it down using wax paper (or your margarine square wrapper). Adding food coloring to the melted marshmallows can be fun. We always cut up jube jubes and add to the popcorn or on top at the end.

I just made this and sampled some, really really good. I made some changes, I added more marshmallows due to the butter being way to much.also added Reese chocolate chips and mini m&ms. Next time I will cut the butter to 1/4 cup. Thanks for a great recipe.

Better than rice crispies. I used green food coloring and red sprinkles. Looked very festive and a huge hit at the Christmas party.

I didn't have any luck with this recipe. I made two batches, changing the proportions the second time, but it still turned out to be one big marshmallow blob.

I made this in cooking class and it was great. We used 2 bags of microwave popcorn. For the people who ruined theirs u probally forgot to take the pot off the stove before u put the popcorn and candies in so try it that way and it will come out better and prettier.

These were GREAT!!!  If you overcook the marshmellows a tad til they brown, it hardens when cooled like carmel.  My kids loved these.

I made 100 popcorn balls for a fund raiser at the "Mitford Days" country fair in Blowing Rock, NC - they were a big hit!  So sweet and yummy.  So easy.  My children ask for them weekly now.  I did not put the candy in.  I made them for Halloween with orange food coloring too.

I did this recipe with my modern-day Home- Ec class. It listed a 16 oz bag of large marshmallows, I could only find 10 oz bag. I agree with previous reviews proportions are wrong maybe they meant 10 oz. Anyway was fine when you added more popcorn.
