I did this just a bit differently. I used everything except the processed cheese and instead of putting the egg into the grits, I poached one and put it on top. I'm a huge grits fan and this made a great lunch for me today. Thanks!

If this is the same recipe that I tried at Jenn's brunch I rate it great! I have never eaten grits before and I'm pretty sure I wouldn't enjoy the plain variety but this dish had just the right amount of flavor to make a wonderful side dish that's different at a brunch. Go for it!

I had never eaten grits before and I have now made this recipe 4 times! I don't buy velveeta so I just used all cheddar and it's absolutely delicious!

Cut the recipe in half and substituted cheddar cheese for parmesan. No need for the Velveeta.

I used a Mexican blend of cheese only to give it a more Mexican taste. Cut the recipe in half as it was only for me but kept the two eggs. Its a great keeper for a person who enjoys their green chilis for that extra kick in the morning. Its even good reheated in the microwave.

I doubled the recipe for a big crowd at Easter, but I did not double the butter! (I used real butter). It just seemed like too much butter! Everyone loved it!

Only change I made was to add pork sausage links, otherwise followed exactly. Delicious

A bit salty for my liking, next time I'd use maybe half. I also used all cheddar cheese instead of cheese product, and put in tomato, onion, and green pepper instead of canned chile (since I didn't have any). Overall really delicious, will definitely make again with less salt.

One of those versatile recipes that can take lots of tweaks. I made it as is and just added more green chiles. Cheesy and comforting.

I love grits casseroles including this one. I made this exactly by the recipe except for cutting it in half. I don't normally have Velveeta, so next time I'd like to try it with all cheddar. I like the southwestern flair the green chiles and hot pepper sauce give to this casserole. I made this for dinner with eggs, sausage, and biscuits. A really good casserole I will fix again.

Wonderful concept, tweaked it a bit by using fresh jalapenos, added parmesan cheese and topped with onion slices. Real stick-to-the-ribs dish, and a pleasant morning wake up.
