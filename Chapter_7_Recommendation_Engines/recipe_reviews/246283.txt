We really enjoyed this method of cooking our root veggies. We did not have the precise set of root veggies called for in the recipe but that is OK! We used golden beets, onions, rainbow carrots, yellow potatoes & sunchokes in our version. I will be saving this recipe as a standard jumping-off point and remaking this in many ways, many times to come. Thank you!

Nice fall vegetable dish. Easy to make and flavorable. Recipe is missing the number of parsnips so I used two. Three might have been better. Three tablespoons of dried rosemary seemed like a lot so I used a little bit less, even though I love rosemary. It was my first time making celery root. It was more expensive than I expected but it was also very large.
