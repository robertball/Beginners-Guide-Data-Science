I made these muffins and based on some of the reviews, I made some modifications. I used 1/2 cup of sugar instead of 1/3 cup. I added 1 Tablespoon of lemon juice. To the Streusel topping I added 1 cup of chopped pecans, 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg and 1/4 teaspoon of mace (the spice NOT what you use to defend yourself ;o) ). I also used brown sugar for the topping instead of white sugar. The muffins with these few changes came out awsome!

I have tried over and over again to find the perfect blueberry muffin recipe.  This is it!!  I added a little lemon, and more blueberries to accommodate my taste.  WOW, I love these muffins.  In fact, I think I'm going to have another.

I made these muffins for a late-night snack/breakfast the following morning.  They are REALLY simple, don't require a lot of ingredients, pretty looking, and REALLY good.    Some people have said they're not super sweet.  While they aren't really sugary, they ARE still sweet.  It's nice to have something a little toned down since nearly everything you buy from the store tends to be loaded with extra sugar.  The streusel topping is also really tasty.  I highly recommend these muffins!

I coated my fresh blueberries with sugar and powdered sugar after rinsing and let them candy a bit before folding into the batter. The kids LOVED the streusel topping. Some nuts in the streusel would be great too.

I found these to be very good.  I increased the sugar to 1/2 cup as suggested and I'm glad I did.  The muffins were still not very sweet even with the extra sugar.  The only real flavor comes from the topping and the berries themselves, but that was okay!

This is a great recipe.  I had been craving blueberry muffins for about two weeks and this recipe solved my craving. I've made it twice.  For the second batch I used smaller muffin tins that yielded 16 muffins and also I used 1-1/3 cups of all-purpose flour and 1 cup of cake flour that I sifted along with the salt and baking powder. They baked in 25 minutes and were moister and lighter than the batch made with just all-purpose flour.

These were just OK. Not as sweet as I like my muffins. I even used a triple berry mix instead of just blueberries. Actually the only sweetness to them was the topping, which by the way, didn't "crumble" but instead formed sort of a butter dough that I broke up over the muffin batter. Although they did turn out, and looked very pretty, these muffins are definately lacking something in the flavor dept.

This was my first time making blueberry muffins from scratch, and it turned out pretty well!  I used half wheat flour, half regular, and I think the streusel topping adds a lot, when using wheat flour.

We all really enjoyed these! I made the following changes: Stevia instead of sugar (and increased to 1/2 cup) in the mix, added 1 TBS lemon juice and a splash extra milk because my batter was very thick and also used 2 cups blueberries. Used brown sugar instead of white for the topping. With those changes I really think these could be called blueberry coffee cake muffins - they were tender and moist and full of yummy blueberries and the streusel on top gave a great crunch and sweetness!

Wouldn't change a thing!  I even used Rice milk instead of the normal, and they came out delicious.  (Rice milk usually dries breads out.)

I'm only giving this 3 stars because mine turned out quite dry (in the spots where there are no blueberries). And I had even added an extra 1/8 cup of milk to the batter because it was so thick (I was worried it wouldn't go into the muffin cups easily because the batter was so incredibly thick, and it was frustrating filling the cups, but the muffins still plumped up nice and evenly while baking). The blueberries I used were quite sweet, so I only used the 1/3 cup of sugar rather than increasing to 1/2 cup as so many reviews have suggested. And I thought the taste was fine. But one huge mistake that I made was to bake the muffins for 10 minutes before adding the streusel topping. This was a mistake because the muffins had already formed domes in that 10 minutes, and so when I put the topping on, it didn't lay well or evenly and most of it just fell off onto the pan. But I strongly suggest that anyone who makes these uses the very lowest rack in their oven because the topping does easily burn when baked the entire 25 or 30 minutes.

GREAT muffins!  I did alter it slightly after reading other reviews I upped the sugar to 1/2 cup and used a mixture of cake flour and all purpose flour.  Also used a mixture of crisp topping I had in the freezer already from Alton Brown.  Will definitely make again!

I made these again yesterday and still give 3 stars but for somewhat different reasons
I have to agree with those who said they are biscuit like. They really are. I don't know what I did last time but the actual muffin part was pretty bland this time. And ugh, the streusel! Are those giving 5 star reviews serving these immediately? You must be. They do not keep well at ALL. Not even for 12 hours. The streusel turns to nasty mush and they are just not good at all. I can't recommend this recipe. And I followed it exactly. 

My first review:

I love the actual muffin part, although I had to add at least 1/4 cup more milk. Before I did so the batter was way too thick. The only change I made was to use half whole wheat flour and the muffins taste delicious even with that change. However, I did not care for the topping. Yes, it tasted good for the first day, but the second day it turned to mush. Worse, it soaked the muffin liners with butter so there was no way I could serve these to people. I will stick with the recipe for the muffin but look for a new streusel recipe. Oh, and the recipe makes more than 12 muffins. I got about 18 out of it but could have made them a tad smaller and made even more.

The flour for me was the problem. Anytime I bake with flour, I always pack it. This was way to much. I even added more milk because I could tell by the smell and consistency of the batter. Barely edible, so I will have to adjust that the next time.

Wonderful!  Wonderfully moist!  Not super sugary like the ones you buy at the store.  I used brown sugar instead of white sugar for the streusel, but I'm sure it'd be wonderful w/ white too.

I did not care for this recipe.I am so disappointed. I followed the recipe but I did add a little bit of lemon juice (less than 1 tbsp) as suggested by another reviewer. These still came out with a horrible texture/consistency (thick, like mud in your mouth) and lacking flavor. I'm not big on sweets by any means, yet these were not sweet enough. On top of it, you couldn't taste anything past the flour. I don't think adding sugar or other flavorings would help. The Streussal was also different from other struessal I've had, but it was the only part of the muffin that was edible. I was able to eat about half of a muffin and my husband couldn't even swallow one bite. :( 
^^According to my friend I over mixed the batter. Oops. Do NOT use a hand mixer! Apparently that's a bad thing. Also, my oven runs hotter than it says, so I should have adjusted for that. Bah.

I used 1/2 cup of sugar & I still think they could've used more. The tanginess from the blueberries really overpowered the sweetness of the muffin. The streusel was GREAT but I think it might be better added halfway through the baking instead of at the beginning.

I made these as written...was looking for a way to use up a container of fresh blueberries. They rose beautiful with full mushroom caps on top.  The streusel was just right and very tasty.  They cooked perfectly browned in 25 mn in my electric oven. Next time I will add a bit more sugar to the batter.  This recipe is a keeper. Thank you for sharing

Great recipe!  I made these this morning for breakfast because I had some fresh blueberries.  My husband and my four-year-old loved them!  The only change I made was with the flour because I try to use more whole grains.  I used one cup of whole wheat flour and 1 1/3 cups of all-purpose flour.  They turned out wonderful!  The streusel topping was perfect!

This is a great recipe for blueberry muffins.  The only thing I would do different is to make more muffins out of the recipe.  I thought that the 12 muffins were filled too full and they sort of spread out over the muffin tin.  I went ahead and followed the recipe this time but will make a few more next time.

I don't know if it is just that i REALLY messed up the recipe, but these muffins came out really bad, with no taste whatsoever. As someone else said, the non-berry parts are tasting very bland, even with the addition of some lemon juice.

These were amazing. I followed the recipe almost exactly. I had to ad 1/4 cup more milk because the batter was more like a dough with just 1 cup. I did use part brown and part white sugar in the topping. Though the recipe states to  fill the muffin cups 2/3 full, mine were nearly filled to the top. I didn't use all of the topping because they were so full, but they still had plenty of streusel. These muffins baked up very high and light. The only change I would make would be to add more blueberries.

It should actually call for baking SODA NOT baking POWDER!!  So the original poster did catch her mistake, but only wrote about it in the reviews and didn't change the recipe.  Sure wish I'd known...I made a double batch!

My muffins turned out very pretty, but very tasteless.  Not sweet enough by far.  I think I will just stick to the boxed mix and try topping them with this streusel topping because it was quite good.  Duncan Hines made a streusel-topped muffin a few years ago that we've been trying to replicate.  Sadly, this recipe is not it.

Really yummy as long as you eat them the same day you make them. They dried out fast after sitting a day.

I've made these three times now and every time they've turned out perfectly! just make sure the butter is cold when making the streusel or it will not turn out as well.

I followed the recipe to the T.  The batter had the consistency of cookie dough.  It was so hard to fold in the blueberries and many of them broke while I was doing that.  So strange to me.  They tasted good, just hard to work with the batter and would prefer a lighter muffin that would come with a thinner batter.

Amazing muffins. I used 1/2 cup sugar, as recommended and they were perfect. I had run out of vanilla so used about 2 teaspoons of orange juice. You couldn't taste it in the end so maybe I could have just left it out. I also used frozen blueberries and I don't think it changed the outcome. It was all I had 

I used a cupcake pan and it made 19 delicous muffins. Were a hit!!!! The streusal topping was not as I expected but still delicous. I had a lot leftover, probably because of the small surface area of the top.

DO NOT use LEMON JUICE as a reviewer stated. It reacts with the baking powder and will ruin this recipe. (I tried it.) When made exactly true to recipe...Yum! Made with white whole wheat flour and it was just as good as well.

Very easy - not too sweet.  If you want blueberry, you won't go wrong with this one.  Topping is a bit of an extra hassle but a lot of people like the strudel.  If you want to avoid the hassle, just add more sweet to the ingredients and leave it off!
I added a banana because I love them and it was great - mostly adds some moisture.

What did I do wrong?  Sure, I didn't do the streusel top (not a fan of the stuff) but the blue marvels that came out of the oven were HILARIOUS!  They looked like blue smurf hats.  One actually looked like a little blue elephant seal. HAHAHAHAHAHA. As for taste, I agree with other, it needs more sugar.  I was looking for a low sugar muffin as I need a carb treat without a sugar crash.  Taste just like pancakes! Would I make again.... hmmmmmmmmm... sure.  They weren't that bad overall.  Best was seeing what they looked like, wonder what the next batch will be.... made me giggle

This is probably the best muffin recipe I have tried.  And with 6 kids, I am always trying new recipes.  I have used this recipe many times, with other fruit options.  Tonight, I am trying it with apples and cinnamon.  Can't wait!!

I made these as "Un-muffins" as I call them. I didn't feel like dealing with muffins so I put the batter in a round pan and sprinkled the topping over it and it didn't even last an hour. It was amazing!

i dhould have read the reviews first and used a tad more sugar and a tad less four (too floury-tasting)... but it was good enough to try again another time with modifications. FYI i used blackberries instead of blueberries and it worked fine.

I used this recipe before and it was one of my favorites, but when using it at a high elevation (5,000 feet +) I simply had to change it.

The original recipe was amazing, when I added two more tbsp of milk it lost a bit of its sweetness and I will have to remember that in the future, so if you're cooking at a high elevation - Add more milk + sugar.

Great recipe, and easy.

Wish I would have read the reviews before I made these.  They are not sweet at all and tasted more like a biscuit than a muffin.  I did give one star for the streusel topping which was pretty good.

INCREDIBLE!!!! I used frozen blueberries and their juice sort of "smeared" into the batter as I folded them in- infusing the flavor throughout.  I made the recipe as is and these are possibly the BEST muffins I have ever had...homemade or bakery fresh. YUM!! Thank you!!

My hubby loves blueberry muffins and these looked easy to make and I had everything on hand.  I do love to read previous reviewers and I was glad I did.  I ended up adding the juice of 1 lemon to the batter as well as more sugar (2/3 c. total).  I also added a little brown sugar to the streusel topping.  These were hands down the MOST AMAZING blueberry muffins I have ever had!  My husband actually got mad that I ate the last one! lol  This will definitely go in the recipe book.

This is an easy and fast resipe. Low in sugar (I use brown sugar), Option to use crumbs or not. Option in what you use for flour but the streusel topping really adds to the muffins. I also used mixed berries instead of blueberry....I give it a 3 thumbs up......GuRu-Me

I added a 1/2 cup of sugar instead of 1/3 cup like some others suggested. I also made a mistake and doubled the butter. Still very delicious. Definitely the best blueberry muffins I have ever made.  This recipe makes way more than a dozen muffins.

I used fresh ground spelt flour instead of white flour, used sucanat instead of white sugar and increased the sucanat to 1/2 c.  I also increased the baking powder by 1/2 tsp as spelt is a slightly "heavier" flour.  
Muffins were delish!

These are the best blueberry muffins I have ever made. I made them exactly as is with one change: as recommended by other readers, I upped the sugar to 1/2 cup (instead of 1/3). I used fresh blueberries. My boyfriend loved them so much he ate 4 of them.
I just made these again, but was out of milk. I used buttermilk, and left the sugar at 1/3 cup. Better than ever! Husband said they were the best muffins he ever had!

These were very good! I used a few more than 1 1/2 cups of berries and a little less than 1/3 cup of sugar. I also added about 1/8 cup of milk extra because the batter was a bit to stiff. These are "just" sweet enough!

Loved these muffins! I secretly substituted 1/2 cup of white flour with whole wheat.  Didn't at all change the texture of the muffin, still very light and fluffy.  My teens ate them up!

I LOVE these blueberry muffins!  I have taken them to several brunches and always get compliments.  I read a few of the reviews that said they had trouble with the struesel topping.  The trick is to use cold butter and it's a lot of work!

I used 1/2 cup sugar like one reviewer suggested and it needed even more than that.  Another person put pwd sugar on the blueberries beforehand and I think I will do that next time IF I make these again.  I thought they took a long time to make...they were not so scrumptuous that I just HAVE to make them again.

I have been known to seriously mess up recipes.  And with this one I panicked because I added a whole stick of butter instead of 1/4 cup.  ...But it only made them better!  I also made them a second time with a little more sugar for added sweetness.  They look beautiful when they come out, couldn't believe I baked them!

This is a great recipe.  Very quick and simple to make, and the results were wonderful.  The muffins were very light and had great texture and taste.  The only change I made to the recipe was to use brown sugar in the streusel topping instead of white.  If you don't use paper liners (I didn't), be sure to grease the muffin tins very well.  I had some problems with my first batch sticking a bit, but after that I greased generously and they were fine.

These were absolutely delicious!  I ended up getting 18 out of the recipe.  I only needed 12 for the muffin swap I'm going to so I had 6 extra.  The extras only lasted like five minutes!  I did increase the sugar to 1/2 cup as mentioned in a few other reviews.  I didn't have any suggested lemon juice so I used lime juice.  I did add a little extra milk as it was hard to stir.  I made these with my 2 1/2 year old and it made for a lovely afternoon.  My only problem was taking the wrappers off....the wrappers totally stuck to the muffins!  Next time, I'll spray first.  :)  And there will be a next time!  The hubby already asked when I was making more.  :)

These are excellent muffins with minimal fuss. I did make a couple changes based on what I like:  I used 1/2 C. Sugar as recommended. I also added a heaping tsp of cinnamon and grated in some fresh nutmeg (cause I love it). As suggested by another review I coated my frozen berries in sugar and let them sit for a while while I mixed the batter. For the streusel I used packed brown sugar instead of white and added nutmeg (of course!). I heaped the streusel on top and they are delicious! Thanks for the recipe!!

I veganized this recipe by using Ener G egg replacer in place of the egg, soymilk and vegan margarine.    I also cut the fat by using 1/4 C applesauce in place of the margarine in the batter.      All modifications worked well and resulted in moist and gooey muffins.    I would suggest decreasing the crumb topping by 1/2 or a 1/3 as I had plenty left over after covering each of the 12 muffin tops.

Wow, these are good.  I did increase the sugar as recommended to a little more than a 1/2 cup and used brown sugar in struesel.  However, I would not recommend putting water in the extra muffin cups as the struesel spread all over the place... but it still tasted great. Big hit with the sleepover.

these are amazing!  i made them exactly as the recipe said, only i used brown sugar instead of white.  they came out wonderfully!  my husband and son said they were the best they ever tasted.  it does only make about a dozen, so next time i'll probably double it, especially if i'm making them for a potluck or when family comes over.  they were also fairly easy for my 10 year old to make, a good project to keep him busy on a rainy summer day!

I chose this recipe to make because it was the only one that I had all of the ingredients for.  The muffins came out moist and delicious!!!  And the time to make them was very short.  Next time I will add lemon zest to the recipe!

Wow! These were amazingly good. The flavor was great, and the toppping turns out well. I only had one problem, and that was that the recipe did not call for enough milk. My original batter was goopy and thick (too thick for muffins), but I added an eight cup of milk and they turned out great! I will definitely make this again :)

Quick & easy recipe but the muffins came out pretty bland.  I used whole wheat flour instead of white.  For the 2nd batch I added an extra 1/4 cup of sugar and 2 full cups of berries.  Husband still said they were not too flavorful.  Although moist, I think that for the next batch I'll add some walnuts or pecans for added flavor.  Will definitely make them again only with my own tweaking!

This was my 1st time making muffins from scratch... and these are so tasty! Even my fiance, who doesn't care much for blueberries, loves them! I used fresh blueberries, and after reading other reviews, I decided to use more sugar- I added 1/2 cup. They aren't meant to be overly sweet, and mine turned out just right! Give these a try!

They were okay... A little too sweet for me. All the sugar overpowered the bluebarry flavor. I think next time I make these, it will be without the streusel.

These were ok; followed the recipe exactly.  But they didn't have much flavor besides the topping, of which I had a ton leftover.  Don't think we'll make these again.

10 star muffin! Rose perfectly, tastes wonderful, looks fantastic, fluffy and moist! AS suggested: used 1/2 cup sugar in mix,  brown sugar and 1/4 cup nuts in the streusel. Used the larger muffin cup size and got 6 big ones and 4 regular/cup cake size. I tried the "To Die For" on this site and they never rose. I will be using THIS recipe often...Thanks!

Absolutely Delicious!  Based on others reviews, I modified:  1/2 C sugar, 1 C whole wheat flour to replace 1 C white, 2 C blueberries, 2 T lemon into milk, Streusel: 1/4 C white sugar, 1/4 C brown sugar & 2 T oatmeal.  
Moist, love the fresh blueberries bubbling over.  Made 24 muffins with just a splash of streusel to make it them special!

So I have never written a review before, but I had to on these. They are perfect with the few tweaks others suggested. I added lemon and cinnamon to the recipe. About 2 tbs. of each. I also did 1/2 thw flour with whole wheat. No one in my family noticed! Also, I had a thought, and tried it, and loved it. I added coconut to the topping. It adds great texture and looks beautiful baked. So if you area a coconut fan, try it! 
Others commented about not being sweet enough, I think that's what makes this recipe so good, you actually taste the blueberries. So I suggest following the recipe on this point. Any sweeter and you are essentially making blueberry cake.

Superb!  I read the reviews first.  I added 2 TBS lemon juice to the milk, which brings out the blueberry flavor.  For the topping, I added 2 TBS oatmeal to make more crunch.

Awesome muffins! I took other people's advice and used brown sugar instead of white and used 1/2 cup sugar instead of 1/3 cup. I also added a dash of lemon juice. My mom loved them and that made them worth it

While they taste fine, they had an almost biscuit-like quality that I didn't like.  I wouldn't make this recipe again.

The muffins were ok. A little too dry for my taste. I put them in for the time shown, but they never got any brown to them. I also soaked the blueberries in water, & and then let them sit in sugar for about 20 minutes before folding them into the batter. Made the blueberries very sweet for those saying it had no sweetness.

Loved this recipe! I gavd it 4 stars because the streusel topping wasnt crumbly. I added more flour, sugar, and brown sugar and it came out great. I also followed the advice of one of the other ladies and coated my blueberries in sugar too.

Good recipe, but Im still looking for the good old "Jordan Marsh" blueberry muffin recipe.  Be sure to spray the muffin pan with nonstick spray as the overflow struesel is tough to get off the pan.

wow these muffins were the business! the only criticism would be that the streusel topping had far too much sugar in it any ideas anybody out there to do a streusel topping this recipe I feel had too much it bubbled over the muffins which whilst taste wise wouldn't make a difference just didn't feel right that's why four stars but the muffins were light fluffy and moist great stuff.

I made Mini Muffins, Awesome, light and fluffy, I made the mistake of melting my butter for the Streusel topping so there were no crumbles. But I did just drizzle the topping over the muffins before baking  and they turned out great.

I made these exactly as indicated in the original recipe except I doubled the Cinnamon in the topping, since we are BIG fans of Cinnamon at our house. They were good, pretty easy. They were not a fluffy muffin like I expected. They are thicker/heavier muffin. And they were an absolute disaster to look at. I tried to make the batter equal 12 muffins, but there was just too much batter, I probably should have made it into 15-16 regular sized muffins and may have been better, they boiled out all over, and will require some serious scrubbing to get my muffin pan clean.  These were ugly, but good! Not overly sweet and great with a Smear of Butter on them. :)

I used more blueberries than it said and also substituted half the flour for wheat flour. It made a dozen muffins and 6 mini muffins. I left the mini muffins streusel free so my infant son could chow down too, since he loves blueberries!

These were delicious, I just made them for Mother's Day and my parents/brothers loved them they were gone in less than 5 minutes. I only made one variation which was I put 1/2 cup sugar instead of 1/3. These were amazing and easy to make.

I did the same ans added 1/2 cup sugar instead, and also 2 cups frozen blueberries. this was my 1st time making muffins and the taste was excellent! however i used foil and paper cupcake holders and both kinds stuck to the finished product. I dont think i will use a liner next time and just greese the muffin pan.

Go into your pantry and throw away all your boxed muffin mixes! This recipe is nothing short of fantastic! I used the recipe in the exact proportions. But being a guy, I didnt pay close enough attention to the directions. After beating together the butter (never use margarine) and sugar enough to mix it, I added the egg. Then I just tossed the dry ingredients right into the same bowl with it, mixed it a little then added the milk and vanilla. THEN I read the instructions about adding the milk alternately with the dry ingredients. The muffins came out fantastic anyway! Thanks Mary Anne!!

At first, I was a bit worried by how thick the batter was. I used 1/2 cup sugar, and ended up with a little over 2 cups of blueberries (thanks to my 3 y/o helper) but they turned out decent. The streusel is perfect. The muffin part isn't as "dessert sweet" as say, the Costco blueberry muffins; but I think that makes them more suitable for breakfast.

this tasted really good,but getting them out of the pans was murder!next time i make theses,i will be sure to put the streusel only in the middle of the muffin so when it rises it does not stick to the pan and make it hard to get out.tastes good though!

I used agave syrup instead of sugar and it seemed to solve the "not sweet enough" problem. I also did as suggested and waited until they were partially baked to add the streusel topping.  MISTAKE!  And you can't bake these as long as suggested.

Overbaked and too brown at 25 minutes!  Maybe it was because I used half pastry flour and half all purpose.  I also added 1 Tbsp of lemon juice, but didn't add it to the batter until the very end because I forgot about it, and I think it reacted badly with the baking soda because the muffins had a really weird sour lemon aftertaste...so if you're going to add lemon juice, do it in the beginning (and maybe use less)!  1/2 cup of sugar in the batter was also better than 1/3, and I think the butter in the streusel needs to be at room temperature and not melted, so it's more crumbly.

This is not a sweet muffin so I modified it a bit.  I added more sugar and more milk. Otherwise the recipe came out really good.

I made these for my boyfriend at his house....he didn't have a muffin pan so I just made it in a 8" x 8" baking dish, went out of town and when I came home he said these were the BEST muffins he had ever had.  He loved the topping.

Loved the recipe but am wondering if you can keep batter in refrigerator a couple of days and bake as needed.  The warm muffins are always best.

This recipe is great! I altered it a bit by increasing the sugar to 1/2 cup and i added 1 tsp flax seed, 1 tsp wheat germ and did half whole wheat flour and half white flour. :-) Turned out amazing! For the topping i used half white and half brown sugar which made a awesome difference! Definitely will be using this recipe again and again!

I always have a hard time getting Blueberry Streusel Muffins 2 to "look" like the beautiful tall muffins in the pictures.  Using a counter top mixer, these came out looking picture perfect.  Don't be afraid to be generous when topping with the streusel.

These were good.  I did use 1/2 cup sugar and still I thought they were not very sweet, even dry. (Maybe I over cooked.)  The mixture was very creamy before I cooked it!  I didn't use the streusel topping, I just sprinkled cinnamon/sugar on top.

i liked these alot. i think i would have liked them better if i had followed the recipe and not taken the suggestion i saw many reviewers make to add more sugar.  i thought it was much too sweet coupled with the super sweet topping.  i wanted muffins not cupcakes.  i had frozen blueberries that i had picked ripe myself so maybe everyone else had the small sour ones you get in the grocery store and that's why they needed more sugar.  really though they were too sweet the blueberries and streusel were enough without the extra sugar. i gave it four stars just because i liked more of a multi-grain feel to my muffins so i think i'll play around with this. a little less flour and maybe add red-mills multigrain high fiber hot cereal mix, maybe some plain apple sauce to add moistness without adding more fat.  thanks for the recipe.

Despite not being very sweet, it was a really good muffin. I added a little bit more blueberries, because I like my muffins overflowing with 'em, and it made it a bit sweeter. The streusel was a little too wet, didn't crumble, but that might have been my fault.

Took these to work for a birthday instead of a cake...RAVE REVIEWS!  These muffins are awesome and make for a beautiful presentation.  If you like a sweeter muffin, use a bit more sugar.  I made as is and my co-workers actually commented on how they liked that the muffins weren't so sweet and overpowering the blueberries.   HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!

These muffins were great! I didn't put the streusel on top because I didn't have time to make it, but I'm sure it would have been even better! It was weird because I doubled the recipe so I used two different bowls to seperate the batter, but one of them was a lot thicker and more elasticy so it made it really hard to put into the cups. I don't why that happend but they all turned out the same. Anyway thanks for the recipe it was great!

This recipe was super easy and overall tasty.  As some reviewers have said, its really not that sweet. the first batch i made following the recipe, and the second batch I placed a half layer of muffin batter in and added an inner layer or streusel and then topped it off with more batter and more streusel on top. i think it helped make them sweeter.  i'll probably add more sugar next time i made them.

The were so good.  The only thing I did differently was to squeeze the juice from half a lemon into the batter and zest a little of the peel into it as well.  I also added enough splenda to the sugar to make 1/2 cup which probably wasn't even necessary.  I plan to try without the added sweetener next time.  Make these muffins!

Very good. The muffin itself wasn't very sweet but the streusel topping is amazing. I found that if you add a little splenda to the mix it will turn out with a slight sweeter flavor without having to add more sugar.
