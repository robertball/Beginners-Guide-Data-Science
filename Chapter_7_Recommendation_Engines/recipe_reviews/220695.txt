I was shocked at how much I loved this salad.  The ingredients are an odd combination but they go together really well.  Both savory and sweet, fresh and flavorful.  I was able to use all the greens from my garden.  Though I did make a couple minor substitutions - I used beet greens instead of chard because that's what I had growing.  And I used a regular orange instead of a clementine, omitting the orange juice in the dressing.  Finally, I used celery salt instead of celery seed and salt separately.  The biggest surprise was how great the olives interacted with the rest of the ingredients.  Fabulous!

Each of the four servings this makes is pretty large.  Add a hunk of meat, fish or a bean patty and you have a great summer meal.

This salad was amazing!!!  It was perfect just the way it was written and I wouldn't change a thing.  The dressing was the perfect compliment to it.  Thanks for sharing...:)

This was one of the best salads I've ever had. I made it exactly as written and it was perfect. The flavors are so unique!

Well I've had this recipe saved for some time & finally decided to make it for dinner tonight. I followed the recipe as is but after reading the reviews I too found the dressing rather sharp & thought perhaps a pinch of sugar would help. Well, everyone including my 3 young children gobbled it all up! What an odd yet beautiful blend of flavours. This is going into my black book of recipes. Many thanks. Evie

We felt this salad was okay but really needed the balance from the smoked sausage I served with it.    We don't eat fennel much, so maybe that was it.  My husband said it wasn't too horrifying to eat.

I made the salad according to the directions, but my husband and I just could not finish it.  We are more of a spinach salad with blue cheese and candied pecans type of family, and unfortunately this was just too far out of our comfort zone.

I had to make this because the ingredient list was so crazy and the reviews so good. I thought it must be one of those recipes that don't seem like they can possibly work but do.  It works okay but for me, it is as weird as the ingredient list seems like it would be.

This salad is OUTSTANDING!!! Made it for Thanksgiving dinner and everyone raved, made another batch tonight to accompany fish, again empty bowl and happy palates. Take a chance on the unusual combo of ingredients-this tastes like something from a Michelin restaurant! Fresh, crunchy, sweet and savory. This will convert any chard avoiders out there. I did make one tiny addition of 1/4 teaspoon brown sugar in the dressing to offset my lemon and will continue this-but really just perfect! So glad I tried this-a go to now for regular meals and a sure winner when serving guests! Thanks for sharing.

Made this as written, except didn’t have fresh basil, which would have likely simply improved it.  I often avoid recipes with so many ingredients, but this didn’t take particularly long to make.  We will eat it again for certain.

Really terrific!  We  used this for Christmas dinner, it was perfect--complex flavors, but light and refreshing.   I didn't have swiss chard, so used kale and followed the suggestion to dress the kale 30 minutes or so ahead of time.

Since oranges are just too time consuming to segment, I used ripe mango. Our grocery store didn’t have chard either so I used kale and let the salad sit dressed for 15 mins before serving. Really yummy and fresh and light. Perfect for summer!

What an explosion of flavours this salad has.  It was so tasty and the combination of flavours from the olives to the licorice taste of the fennel and the orange and apple was incredible.  I used a Granny Smith apple for it's crunchiness.  Could not find a clementine orange so I substituted with a Cara Cara which was great.  I spooned the dressing over the salad and did not use all of it.  There is just the right amount of everything.  Will add to my salad repertoire and will share with everyone.

Made as written and the family liked it.  I thought the dressing was a little too sharp with the lemon juice and the olives did not compliment the salad.  Next time I will make the following changes.  Use only orange juice - no lemon and omit olives.
