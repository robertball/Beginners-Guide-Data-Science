One of my most favorite "church" salads. I sometimes make this fluffy by folding in a small container of Cool Whip.

This has always been a favorite salad of mine.  I made as written, but only added coconut to three-fourths of the salad and left the other fourth without for my coconut disliking guys.  This recipe does make a very large bowl and it was good without getting watery for about 3 days.  Just make sure you drain your fruit really well.  I saved the juice from the fruit and used it to make gelatin.  A delicious salad that will grace my table again.

LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS SALAD!!  It's best served ICE cold.  I add 1 cup of shredded coconut instead of 3/4 cup.  I also use fat free sour cream and the canned fruits are in their own juices.

Love ambrosia salad! So delicious. This recipe was good. I substituted half the sour cream with cool whip (8oz sour cream and 8 oz cool whip), and it turned out perfectly to our tastes. Have made several times. Thanks!

I've made this many times through the years, with different variations depending on who was coming over to eat. Sometimes I have had to add more ingredients for some in a separate bowl. My daughter-in-laws like it with plumped raisons and apple chunks added, the grandkids like it best when I use cool whip instead of sour cream, my brother -in-law likes it with a yogurt  instead of sour cream...I personally like it with halved green grapes, banana slices and pecan pieces. One of my sisters uses vanilla pudding (straight out the box) instead of cool whip, yogurt or sour cream. Best when refrigerated at least 24 hours.

Excellent. Made mostly as listed, I used flavored mini marshmallows (orange, strawberry, lemon & lime) and you definitely need to let chill 2+ hours or more so flavors blend. Will definitely make again!

Different than the Ambrosia salads I'm used to. Less sweet, and I could only find crushed pineapple, not tidbits, so mine was more watery. I added chopped pecans, and that was a MUST DO! Enjoyed this, even though it's not what I'm used to.

Made this salad and everyone loved it. Drained pineapples, and oranges so the salad won't be runny. Taste better if you make it night before instead of 2 hours prior to event...

Delicious! I was told it was the best Ambrosia salad one of my friends had ever had. I drained the fruit overnight and added a container of Cool Whip in addition to thesour cream. I used the number of cans indicated even though Canadian sizes are different.

It was excellent and I made it exactly as per instructions. It keeps for several days but the juices do start coming out, not a problem I just added a couple more marshmallows the last day of eating. I would highly recommended this recipe.

This recipe calls for more ingredients than the cream can hold.  With some common sense adjustments to the number of cans I opened, it was fine.

This has become my signature "pot luck" contribution.  I use equal parts cool whip and sour cream.  One preparation change I made is after draining, I leave the fruit in the colander placed in a larger bowl.  I let this drain overnight in the fridge.  This step removes at least another cup and a half of liquid.  The salad then is less runny.

Does any one know if the salad will firm up a bit after chilling? Mine became real soupy looking the more and more I tossed it. I have it in fridge now I am just trying to figure out if I should add pudding to it to thicken it up a bit or something?

I’ve made this many times. It’s a big hit at pot lucks on the beach or a friend’s boat. We cruise full time and availability of ingredients can be a challenge. I’ve used the large marshmallows and quartered them, and I’ve also used plain yogurt if I don’t have enough sour cream (although it’s easy to make your own with milk and/or lemon juice or white vinegar, in a pinch). Delicious!  I was looking for a recipe similar to the one my mom used to make, and this is it!  Sometimes I add grated coconut as well.

Mine was a little watery (probably didn’t drain fruit well enough) so I added a small package of vanilla pudding mix.  It worked perfectly to soak up the extra juice and gave an extra vanilla flavor.

I added a small jar of maraschino cherries, cut in half.  I also reduced the sour cream to 8 ozs., added an 8-oz. container of whipped topping, and toasted the coconut beforehand.  Everyone really like it.

Excellent: easy and tasty.  I like it with sour cream ( I think the frozen Redi-whip makes it too sweet). I do drain the fruit overnight so it isn't watery and include pecans for texture. Also now add strawberries instead of maraschino cherries because I can't seem to avoid getting the ambrosia pink otherwise.  My Book Club loves it.

I made this for a baby shower today and it was a big hit! It was gone within minutes! Sooooo easy to make too. It's not only tasty but appealing to the eye with the mandarin orange and pastel colored marshmallows. I'll definitely be making this often for social gatherings.

Really yummy! We use Greek yogurt instead of sour cream - I used about 10 ounces of plain Greek yogurt plus a 10 oz container of thawed cool whip. Gave a great fluffy texture. I'd made this recipe before and it was a bit soupy, so I made sure to drain the fruit really well. The natural juices that are released when the salad is stirred will add juicy sweetness. We have a couple of non-coconut, so I left it out this time. Still turned out great, but I think the coconut would've helped soak up some of the liquid. I think the cool whip did the job this time around, adding the fluffy texture without too much extra flavor or sweetness. I used pineapple chunks, they were too big. Gotta hunt down the tidbits...

Love Allrecipes!! Always read the critiques.  Now all of sudden when I click "more" to read the entire rating of an individual, it will not open up.  I always was able to do this until lately.   Any suggestions what is wrong?

I made this for our church luncheon. Everyone loved it and it makes a LOT!! Make sure your drain the canned fruit several times. The only thing I did different was to add 8oz of sour cream and 8 oz of cool whip instead of 16oz of sour cream. Next time I will add one cup of coconut~ it is delicious!!
