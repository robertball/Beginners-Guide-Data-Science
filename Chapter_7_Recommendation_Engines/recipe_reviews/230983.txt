Thank you for a delicious recipe, Anne.  I used a bit less honey, about 1/3 cup, the green onions were very nice.

This recipe is fresh and heathy. I used less honey cause my family doesn't like real sweet. I changed the bacon to Morningstar meatless bacon to make it vegetarian. Excellent recipe.

Trying to figure out how to edit this, when I can I'll make these changes:
Decrease honey to 1/3 cup
Add 1/2 tsp salt.
Thanks, everyone!
Anne

Way too sweet for my taste!  I cut back on the honey, and wish I had also cut the Craisins in half. In addition, even though I chopped the largest head of broccoli I could find into florets, it wasn't enough - they were totally overwhelmed by the bacon and the Craisins, so I had to add more florets.  I doubt I will make this again - sorry, Anne!

I've made this a couple of times and it is always a hit!  Someone always asks for the recipe.  I used red onion instead of green. Using  honey instead of sugar makes it taste better.

I only did a half recipe and then I still halved the half of mayo (1/4 c)! Delicious!

I love it.  I just finished making it and because I am the cook, I get to try it.  It is yummy even before I put it in the fridge to let it marry!  I love the fact you use honey instead of sugar!  I have switched  almost completely to honey.  This was so fast to make up as well.  It took me all of 10 minutes including the thick cut bacon.  Oh, I cut the bacon down to 5 slices because it is thick cut bacon.  Otherwise, I would have used all 12 slices.
