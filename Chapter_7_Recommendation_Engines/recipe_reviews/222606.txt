I had a half pound of chorizo sausage to use, I used that instead of plain pork sausage. I also did not have ricotta, I used "trim" cottage cheese instead. This was great--using corn tortillas as the crust is brilliant. It was a little greasy from the cheeses, though. I bet I could get away with using half the amount next time and it still would be just as good.

This is so simple and absolutely delicious! I was panicked b/c I didn't have heavy whipping cream but found an emergency substitute online (3/4 cup milk + 1/3 cup melted butter = 1 cup heavy cream) My family ate every last bite!

Very good recipe.  I'm wheat free, and I liked the corn tortilla crust.  The tortillas need a spray of oil or brush of butter for the exposed pieces though.  I subbed chorizo for the pork and only used about half the cheese and four eggs. Did not use the green chilies this time, but will sauté some peppers and onions next time and add an egg, assuming enough room in the pie pan.  Definitely good enough for a next time!

I doubled the recipe and used an emu egg In lieu of 12 chicken eggs.  The doubled recipe fit nicely in a 9x13 baking dish.  I used 9 corn tortillas to line the dish and doubled the ingredients.  Baked about 20 minutes longer than original recipe.  We eat all our emu eggs during laying season and this recipe is the best tasting and easiest to prepare of ALL the recipes we have experimented with.  Freezes nicely too!

I also used chorizo and reduced each cheese by 1/2. I wouldn't say it was delicious, but it was good.

I loved the flavour of this quiche! I added sliced sausages, but I should have chopped them smaller. They ruined the overall texture of the dish. My fault entirely, as it seems like sausage crumble is what the recipe calls for. I added green onion and banana peppers instead of jalapeño. These were great! I accidentally added the cilantro before cooking, but it still tasted lovely. My favourite part was the corn pie crust, but was also why I gave this recipe 4 stars instead of 5. The crust on the bottom and sides was really good, but on the edges it was hard and inedible. Next time I'm cutting off the edges, and I'm going to make it with bacon or without meat at all.

Very tasty!  Instead of the cilantro, chili powder and green chilis, I used 1/2 jar of sala and cut up small yellow, orange and red peppers.  I also substituted parmesan cheese over the top, but did use the ricotta.  I also only used 4 eggs.  In short, I used what was in my fridge.

Easy to prepare and tasty. Used a fresh jalapeño rather than canned chilies.

I was looking for a recipe to use up my corn tortillas, and this is it!  Although I did make quite a few changes, I basically followed the general recipe.  I used ground beef, mozzarella cheese, cheddar and jack cheese, soy milk and butter in place of the sour cream, cottage cheese instead of the ricotta and four eggs instead of six (otherwise it would have run over the pie plate which it did anyway a bit).  This is one of the more delicious recipes I have made!

This is not a bad quiche.  It's about the same as any other quiche I've had but the tortilla crust does make it easier than making a pie crust.  I shall use this recipe again.

I will make again everyone loved it.  the change i made was out of necessity.  I  could not find ricotta at store ( all sold out).  I substituted sour cream, grated parmesan cheese (in the container) and shredded mozzarella cheese to make 1 cup.  It was a big hit.

Used 4 full eggs plus 3 egg whites so it wasn't as "eggy."  Delish and super easy to make. Will definitely make again.

I made this recipe and of course had a few changes.  I used half-n-half instead of whipping cream. I chopped one fresh Jalapeno pepper and added that to the sausage after cooking and draining the sausage and then cooked the sausage and Jalapeno pepper together for several minutes.  I also used flour tortillas instead of corn.  I was worried the flour tortillas would get soggy but they didn't.  I sprayed Pam into the pie dish and then wiped that with a paper towel before laying the tortillas into it.

Like another reviewer, I wanted to avoid a trip to the store so I used what I had on hand. Didn't have a can of green chilies so I subbed 1 T finely chopped canned jalapenos (threw that in with the sausage layer.) Also cut the amount of cheese to 1 cup "Fiesta Blend." Didn't have corn tortillas so I searched for a recipe for a tortilla chip crust. Wasn't great, but the filling more than made up for it! Delicious!! Can't wait to try this again with the corn tortilla crust. Thank you Corinne, I had to give my very first review because I thought this was so good.
