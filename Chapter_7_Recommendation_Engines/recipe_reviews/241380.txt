The oil needs to be on high.  The crust was a little mushy because the oil wasn’t hot enough

this is our go to buffalo shrimp recipe...no egg needed..and i use franks red hot with  just enough butter to add flavor..i use canola oil after just coating the shrimp lightly in cornstarch..done!! we eat this once a week..we are low carb lifers now..this is pretty low carb..aside from the oil and butter its not a bad meal...use less butter if you want and if you fry quick there is little oil absorbed..dry them off on a paper towel..perfect!
