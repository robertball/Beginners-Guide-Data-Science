Fabulous, easy, quick.  I didn't bother with the balls and the squishing with greased parchment.  I just rolled the whole mess between two sheets of greased parchment and scored it with a pizza cutter (also greased).  

Will make again with different combinations of ingredients!!

These are great!  I had added them to my favorites a couple of months ago as I love Mary's Gone Crackers and was looking for a less expensive alternative.  I completely forgot to make them until I was scrolling through my favorites last night and came across them again.  I followed the recipe exactly except I added a tablespoon or two of pepitas (raw pumpkin seeds) in addition to the rest of the seeds.  This is so versatile, I want to make several different flavors!  I did make the mistake of trying to use grease foil instead of parchment because I did not have any parchment.  They stuck pretty badly, but I was able to peel them off anyway.  I used wax paper trickled with water to squish down the balls.  Originally had planned on making a full sheet and cutting them with a pizza cutter, glad I didn't because it would have been impossible.  Lesson learned: if you don't have parchment, best to stick them straight to the cookie sheet.  Mine did not come out super crispy even in the second go around in the oven, but they are still so good.

This recipe is awesome! 
I recommend making a quarter batch so you don't overwhelm your food processor because the dough is VERY sticky! 

I have started to experiment with different spice flavoring combinations like Rosemary and Garlic, adding nutritional yeast, and even a little goat cheddar. Every batch comes out better than the last.

I loved these. Similar to another reviewer, I rolled these out rather than dropping them in balls. I also added extra soy sauce. I am about to make another batch trying some new flavors. This is definitely a keeper!

wow - these turned out good!  a little salty, but that was my fault.  i should have tasted before baking.  i used some trader joe's everything bagel seasoning, somehow i had 3 bottles of it .
i think they came out better than the boxed crackers.  easy peasy to make too.  i will make again for sure.

Easy, delicious, flexible!!! Yay! I just put everything in the processor at once and it worked great. I cooked 10 min, flipped with the greased parchment, cut into crackers with pizza cutter, and cooked 10 more minutes. I didn't roll it out very evenly so some cooked more quickly than others. Just took those out, started devouring them, and put the rest back in for a few.  Thanks for this recipe!!!!

I just finished tasting my first batch--FANTASTIC! I used lite soy sauce and did roll the dough out between oiled layers of parchment, then cut it with a pizza wheel before baking, as suggested by some of the other reviewers here. They're nutty, they have a nice crunch, and will go great with a nice bowl of soup.

Crackers taste great. I will add more seasonings next time. For my oven I had to cook at 400 degrees for 25-30 minutes.  Next time I will try to make a roll and slice and bake. Making little balls is tedious. Otherwise, great recipe.

Great recipe! It's nice and simple and turned out great! I ended up just baking mine for 20 minutes, rotating halfway and they turned out nice and crispy. I personally found the flax to be annoying to work with so I'd likely reduce the amount next time.
