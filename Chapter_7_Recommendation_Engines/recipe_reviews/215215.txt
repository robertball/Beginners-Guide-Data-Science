Sorry, but this didn't work out for us. The nectarines brought out the tanginess. Maybe if used splenda/sugar for the nectarines, it wouldve been a bit sweeter. Don't get offended with my review; the temperature and time were right on, plums were good and it was easy. So overall, it was average for us.
