EXCELLENT!! I cut the sugar down to 1 cup as recommended by most of the previous raters and in fact next time I'll probably use 3/4 cup. Anyway it tasted a lot like an egg custard pie which is one of my favorites and my husband our next door neighbors and I all loved it! A more specific baking time instead of "bake until set" would've been helpful but I found that about 25 minutes did the job.

This turned out great. I didn't have any evaporated milk so I used one can of sweeted cond. milk (14oz) and skipped the sugar. It was firm and delish. My husband swore he would hate it and I made him taste it. He said it was great! WOw!

Would have been better if it hadn't been SO SWEET!!  I love pies and sweets but whoa momma...it's zucchini-hinted diabetes!  If I ever make again I will definately be cutting the sugar in half.  I was also worried it wouldn't set (just kept boiling in the oven), but after it cooled it set up quite nicely.  Thanks!

This is great as a custard also. Just omit the pie crust. I decreased the sugar to 3/4 cups and found it to be sweet enough. Great way to use that leftover zucchini.

I was pleasantly surprised as to how good & sweet this pie tasted. I used peeled & shredded zucchini. I skipped the boiling part. The pie resembled pecan pie filling and was very sweet. I would maybe decrease the sugar to 1 1/2 cups but it was great anyway!!!!

Don't tell the kids the "secret" ingredient. Mine finished it suspiciously. I personally prefer zucchini bread over this pie but maybe because it was so sweet. I will cut the sugar at least by half next time. It also took over an hour to "set." Smells wonderful while baking!

I give this 5 stars because my family really likes it. It's a great way to use up some of the extra zucchini from my garden but it's VERY sweet. I recommend cutting back on the sugar.

We loved this pie! We have a lot of zucchini from our garden so I wanted to find some zucchini recipe dessert I was not sure if this pie would work but It did perfect!. I didn't use evaporated milk because I didn't have any but I use milk I only add 1 cup of sugar because we don't eat much sweet stuff. It turn amazing!! it taste a little bit like pumping pie. I have been made it 3 time so far:)

This was a super great tasting pie. Smooth and creamy- I even used fat free evaporated because the recipe didn't say what to use. I also altered my recipe by using sugar substitute (like Splenda for baking) instead of the white sugar and i would NOT say that it's too sweet. I also made my own crust with soy/whole wheat flour combination it has a little salt in it so the combination of salt and sweet is nice. The baking time was 40 min.

This is an incredible pie!!! My children loved it and it's so easy to make. I love simple desserts that help use up the excess zucchini from the garden! It's a WIN-WIN deal!! Will make this over and over again. Also freezes very well. Thanks!

I used a can of sweetened condensed milk instead of sugar and evaporated milk and it came out perfect! I can't believe how good this turned out. I've made it several times already and even once as a custard.

I reduced the sugar as others stated and adjusted it for 10 servings because I wanted a thicker pie. I have no idea how others removed seeds from a zucchini - there are hundreds. I skipped seeding unless one looked hard. No one could tell when eating it - smooth as could be. I wish the recipe gave a guideline for how long to cook it. I baked it for at least an hour. A knife never came out clean for me but I thought it had to be getting done because the crust and top were starting to brown (slightly). After it cooled it did set up solid. Everyone liked it.

This pie is seriously amazing! The only thing I changed was the amount of sugar...I don't like things too sweet so I only used 3/4 cup sugar. Still very sweet (for my taste) so next time I will try 1/2 cup sugar. I think I will make another pie tomorrow and give it my mom just to see if she can guess what is in it (you really can't tell it is zucchini)! It is really really good!

I loved this. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I'd like it to be a little more set. I made it twice the second time baking it for around an hour and it still seems too runny. I'll probably try upping the flour to 5 tbsp next time. This was sooooo tasty! I'm continually amazed by the versatility of zucchini.

Very Good recipe. My Mom loved it and asked for the recipe. I made the NO ROLL PIE CRUST I by Karin Christian from this site for the first time too. Both were great and will definitely make again. The only change in this recipe was that I followed another raters comment and substituted the evaporated milk and sugar for a can of sweetened condensed milk. It worked out perfectly and just the right sweetness. The pie turned out solid and beautiful. I baked it at 425 degrees for 5 minutes and then reduced heat to 325 degrees as directed. It took 50 minutes at 325 degrees in my oven. Definitely worth a try with your summer bounty of zucchini. Thanks for submitting this recipe.

I MADE THIS PIE BUT I HADN'T PICKED MY ZUCCHINI YET THAT DAY BUT I HAD SOME YELLOW SQUASH SO I USED THAT AND IT WAS AMAZING. I ONLY USED 1 CUP OF SUGAR AND NEXT TIME I MAKE IT I WILL ONLY USE 3/4 CUP. I HAVE HAD LOTS OF ZUCCHINI AND YELLOW SQUASH THIS SUMMER AND IT IS AMAZING TO ME HOW VERY VERSITAL THESE SQUASH ARE. I HAVE HAD FUN LOOKING FOR DIFFERENT RECIPES AND MAKING LOTS OF THEM. MY HUSBAND WILL ASK WHAT IS FOR SUPPER AND I TELL HIM "DO YOU THINK IT IS GOING TO BE ANYTHING WITHOUT SQUASH IN IT." I THINK HE IS TIRED OF IT BUT IT NEVER TASTES THE SAME WHEN YOU MAKE DIFFERENT RECIPES WITH IT. NEXT PIE WILL BE WITH ZUCCHINI. PHYL32 I MADE THIS AGAIN FOR XMAS DINNER AND DECIDED TO SEE IF IT COULD BE MADE AN IMPOSSIBLE PIE SO I ADDED 1/2 CUP OF BISCUIT MIX AND LEFT OUT THE FLOUR. I ALSO ONLY USED 1 C SUGAR. IT TURNED OUT GREAT. I CANNED 28 QT OF YELLOW SQUASH THIS SUMMER SO I USE THAT FOR THIS RECIPE.

This pie is awesome. Was a little sweet the first time I made it. I used half the amount of sugar the second time I made it and liked it much better. My guests request the recipe after one taste of this pie.

WOW was this fantastic!! And totally by accident did I find out that you really only need 1/2 cup of sugar for each pie. I started making the pie and I was putting stuff in the blender while I was doing the zucchini. Since I had double the zucchini I decided to make 2 pies. I doubled everything but realized too alte that I forgot to double the sugar and the result was just FANTASTIC! We did put a little whipped cream on top and the guests raved over what a good vanilla custard pie it is. Then I revealed it is zucchini. They couldn't believe it!

Wish I could rate this higher it is a fantastic pie! I read all reviews and finally decided to cut the sugar down to 1 1/4 cups as everyone seemed to agree the pie was very sweet. I agree it could even be cut down more but oh my this was delicious. I added the cinnamon and nutmeg to the mix and sprinkled pumpkin pie spice over the pie. My pie took almost an hour baking to almost set it completely but when it cooled it was perfect. I never told anyone what the "secret" ingredient was and nobody guessed but everyone raved about how delicious it was. I will be doing this again soon LOL. I froze some of the pieces to share with others and it froze well.

This pie is excellent. I changed the sugar to 1 and 1/4 cups instead of the 2 cups due to other reviewers saying it was too sweet. I made 2 pies and first one was gone in a day. Perfect and easy recipe. Thank You

Yummy way to use up zucchini. I did reduce the sugar to one cup per other reviews. I added the cinnamon and nutmeg with the other ingredients in the blender. I sprinkled additional cinnamon and nutmeg on top of the pie before baking. My husband and daughters thought this pie tasted like a pumpkin pie.

This was amazing! I had a 10lb zucchini and had to get creative in using it. I found this recipe and was skeptical...but true to it's reviews it was fantastic! I will definately be making this again. Perfect for the holidays. I too only used 1C sugar and I used ginger instead of nutmeg (because I was out...still very good).

WOW!!! this is something like my granmother made on the farm...soooo good. I didn't think it was too wet..It does take a little longer to cook than a regular pie. I just let it set and when it cooled it was fine...I'm making this for easter and my mother is going to go nuts over it. The only change I made was I did a gluten free crust.

I took this to a family dinner and called it "surprise pie". Everyone loved it and they were shocked when I revealed that it was zucchini. It tastes alot like rice pudding in a pie crust. I used the no roll pie crust from this site which was very good and easy. Only negative is that it is very sweet. I only used 1 cup of sugar but will use less next time.

So why is there zucchini in this?? Tastes like a caramelly pecan pie to me- maybe you could use peaches or something instead. So yummy!! A great recipe to use up zucchini when you're sick of zucchini- you'll never know its there.

It is definitely too sweet for my taste but tastes great otherwise. I lowered the amount of sugar by 1/4 cup will use less next time. Used regular milk since I was out of evaporated. It would not set even after cooling. Next time I will use evaporated milk as called for in the recipe add a couple more tablespoons of flour bake it longer and see if that helps.

Really great recipe. I like many others cut the sugar in half and still thought it was a little too sweet. I used a graham cracker crust since that was all I had on hand. Great way to use zucchini and unique pie. My super picky family loved it. Thanks for the recipe!

Everyone I told about this pie was sceptical but it turned out to be a BIG hit! I like the other just used 3/4 cup of sugar and it was perfect. I actually think it's best a day or even two later.

This is very good and a great way to use up zucchini (one can only bake so many loaves of zucchini bread). I'm only giving 4 stars because the amount of sugar called for is WAY too much. I started with 1 cup tasted it and decided not to add any more. Also the baking instructions are vague. I baked mine for an additional hour.

This is very sweet but my family likes it sweet. I have made this recipe several times. I have used 3 cups of shredded unpeeled zucchini out of the freeze. Comes out great just has green specks in it. I have also added pecans to the recipe. If you do this just use a bigger pie pan or it will bubble over. My cook time is 75 minutes at 350 using a ceramic deep dish 10 inch pie plate.

I made this as a custard because I wanted it to be gluten free. I reduced the sugar to less than a cup and subbed some dark brown sugar for some of the white sugar. I also added a tablespoon of coconut flour instead of using regular flour in the mix. It is not quite a vanilla custard but it's not quite pumpkiny. You can't put your finger on what's different about it but it's delicious!

Very good flavor but a little on the "wet" side for a pie. Think a lot of the texture depends on the moisture content of your zucchini. Well worth a try but may skip the crust next time and go for a custard.

This is a delicious way to use zucchini. Hard to believe there is any zucchini in it at all.

I had never made zucchini pie before and I looked up this recipe. My family really enjoyed it - my oldest son stated that he liked it better than pumpkin pie. I cut the sugar down to 3/4 cups and it is just perfect. I didn't have any evaporated milk so I used half and half. I also mixed the cinnamon and nutmeg in with the rest of the ingredients instead of putting it on top. I use an oil crust for all of my pies. Thanks for the recipe - I think I will be making it more frequently!

What a happy accident to discover this recipe as I needed to use up leftover zucchini. I was completely shocked by how delicious this was! I served it at a dinner party and asked guests to guess the secret "unusual" ingredient. My changes: I used butter instead of margarine cut the sugar to 1 cup (with a mix of cane and coconut) mixed the cinnamon and nutmeg into the batter in addition to sprinkling a bit on top didn't use a blender to incorporate my shredded zucchini. Baked for 5 minutes at 425 and 45 minutes at 325. It finished setting as it cooled on the stove top. I sampled it warm but opted to chill before serving.

I followed recommendations to reduce sugar--I used 3/4 c. and could have easily used less.  I found it almost cloyingly sweet at THIS quantity (I cannot even imagine it being edible with 2 c. of sugar).  So feel free to do 3/4 cup or reduce to 1/2 cup, as I will next time.  That said, we all devoured this warm (I called it pudding :)) and raved!   It was quite thin, maybe only an inch tall, and as such I would double next time.  I didn't use a crust, just a buttered glass pie pan.  I microwaved the zucchini three minutes, let it cool a bit, then put everything in the Cuisinart, including the spices.  It cooked roughly 30 minutes following the temps in the recipe.  So easy.  So good.

I use to make this recipe back in the 80's when my kids were little. At the time my son was 8 and I knew if I told him it had zucchini in it he wouldn't eat it... so I told him it was a "vanilla" pie. It wasn't until he was in the middle of his 2nd piece that I finally told him what was really in it. Fast forward to 2015 --- I lost my original recipe and come looking for an alternate and found this one that was very close (if not the same) to the one I use to have. Living in Costa Rica I had to make some substitutions but it still came out awesome and just like I remembered!!!! My changes were: 1 1/4 cup sugar instead of 2 cups Ayote Squash instead of Zucchini Whipping cream instead of Evaporated milk Added a bit more flour

I cut down the sugar to 2/3 cup and added a little more zucchini (about 2 cups). It was delicious. I will definitely make this again. I had to bake it for about 40-50 minutes to get it to set.

Awesome pie! I will be making this over and over again. I used 1 1/2 cups of sugar in mine and it was not over the top sweet. You would never know there was zucchini in this pie. And so easy to make. I wasn't sure how long to bake because I've never made a custard type pie before. I baked or for an hour and it turned out just fine.

this recipeis excellent very delicious. It was a little too sweet for us so next time I will cut down the amount of sugar.
