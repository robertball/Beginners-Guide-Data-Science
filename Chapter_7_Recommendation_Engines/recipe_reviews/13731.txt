This is one of the easiest things I have ever made.  Only thing I did differently (because I forgot to add shortening to my grocery list) was used wax paper to line the cooking sheet rather than greasing it.  Once it's cool enough to be handled, flip it out onto your powdered towel and gently pull the wax paper off then roll.  Moist, moist, moist.  I've made it several times and prefer wax paper (with all cakes, actually) to greasing the pans.

I have been making this for over 25 years. I give it to our customers for our company instead of alchol. I was offered $300.00 for the recipe. But it was a friends family recipe I promised NOT to give out. This is easy and awsome. Everyone will be in aw over it. Simple recipe but so you know roll needs to cool at LEAST two hours in the fridge to firm up. It can also cool overnight just so you know. Wrap it in tin foil and it keeps in the freezer for up to 3 months and it is still just as yummy as it was fresh. I ship to my brother in New Jersey from California EVERY YEAR!

This is the easiest pumpkin roll recipe I've ever made. It's delicious as well. Two hints to help it turn out every time: 1) Spray the pan with cooking oil spray, then line with parchment paper to make the cake turn out flawlessly, and 2) Be sure to sprinkle powdered sugar all over the cotton towel before rolling the cake the first time. Thanks for a keeper, Jackie!

If I can bake this anyone can! This was so easy and everybody cleaned it off the plate. I made two for a women's brunch and it was the first and only thing to completely clear off the table. I did take the advice of the woman who said she used the allspice frosting filling. I thought the frosting recipe looked like it would be too sweet, so I just added a 1 tsp of allspice to the cream cheese filling from this recipe and it made the perfect addition. Yum!

I was a little afraid to try this recipe because of the whole rolling up a cake thing.  However, it turned out very, very nice and not too hard at all.  Thank you!

FANTASTIC! Great recipe! Absolute favorite all the way around. First dessert that was gone. Suggestion: Use the Allspice cream cheese frosting recipe from allrecipes.com. Makes it that much better!
Happy Fall!!

I made this using a 17 1/4 x 11 1/2 jelly roll pan.  The roll was a little smaller and longer.  Very moist and very tasty.

I made this tonight and it turned out great.  The sponge cake part needs some flavoring; added 1/4 tsp of ground allspice and a 1/4 tsp of salt.  Otherwise, no other changes were made to the ingredients.  The cake needs to be baked in a 15"x10" jelly roll pan so that it can be rolled thinly and with minimal cracking.  Used cooking spray to coat the pan then added parchment paper and coated it with shortening and flour.  Baked it for 15 min. until the toothpick came out clean.  Use a lot of confectioners sugar!  Sprinkle the towel liberally with the sugar before inverting the cake onto the towel and sprinkle the cake, too before rolling it.  Roll the towel into the cake and let it sit on a wire rack for 30 min. When it's time to add  the cream cheese mixture, it  won't melt since it'll be cool enough.  Wrap the roll in foil when you're done rolling it again and place it in the refrigerator for a few hours so that it can set up.  Delicious!  Thanks.

This is the best pumpkin roll.  I've tried other similar recipes and they don't turn out as good.  This is a holiday keeper.

I have previously reviewed this but wanted to share a couple things for people that seem to have a hard time with this recipe. It is very very easy. First of all I bake this in a non-stick 10x15 cookie sheet. I not only spray the pan with baking spray but I also rub a thin layer of butter on the bottom of the sheet and on the sides. This is so important bc you do not want that cake sticking to the pan!! My cake is finished within 10-12 minutes. The recipe says 15-25. If mine stayed in for 15-25 minutes, it would be fried! I take the cake out of the cookie sheet and place it on the tea towel while it is still hot. Cool enough for me to touch, but still hot! I always bake this dessert the night before I actually need it. I roll it up in clear wrap and leave it in the refrigerator overnight and don't cut it until the following day. This will allow the cake to become much more moist and be much more flavorful. Hope this helps!

Everyone who had a piece of this raved about how delicious it was. I have to admit though, I actually messed the ingredients up a little bit. I mistakenly put 3/4 c. of pumpkin puree in instead of 2/3 c. Since I accidentally did that, I added about an extra tablespoon of flour into the mixture. It still turned out fine. Also, some of the comments for all of the pumpkin rolls on this site talked about how bland the actual cake part turns out in comparison to the cream cheese frosting. I decided to use 3/4 t. cinnamon and 1/4 t. pumpkin spice to give it some extra flavor. In doing that, I don't think 1/2 t. would have given it enough spice to it. I think next time I may even do a whole t. of cinnamon and a 1/2 t. of pumpkin spice. It could have used even more flavor. For the frosting, I substituted Neufchatel cheese for the cream cheese and there was no difference at all. I would also recommend sifting the powdered sugar before mixing it for the frosting. My powdered sugar got a little lumpy, although you couldn't tell at all when it was rolled up into the cake. My method of greasing the pan was to use a cooking spray, heavily spray the pan, and then flour it after. I let the cake cool on the pan for a few minutes and then I took a small and narrow plastic flipper and slid it around all under the cake to loosen it. I quickly flipped it onto the towel, and it was perfect.

I don't know why I waited so many years to try this- it's so easy, especially using the technique recommended by other reviewers (spray pan with cooking spray and then line pan with parchment paper).  Great traditional recipe that looks like so much more work than it requires!

I made this roll this morning, when I took it out of the oven I could smell the Baking Soda...are you sure this shouldn't be Baking Powder...Now I'm wondering what my dessert will taste like...But it was very quick and easy to make...I used parchment paper in my jelly roll pan...flipped the baked cake onto another piece of parchment paper removed the first parchment paper and rolled the cake up using the new parchment paper...I rolled the parchment paper right into the cake..when it was time to put in the filling the cake unrolled beautifully...

I have been making this for awhile, but never got around to rating it! My family...and my in laws love this! People make orders in advance so that I can bring them to their parties! I feel a little guilty, cause it is SO easy to make! I also found that if you wrap the roll in foil when your done, and refridgerate it for an hour or so, it stays colder for a longer time! Thanks!!

My rating would of been 5 stars if the recipe added 1/4 tsp. cloves and 1/4 tsp. nutmeg which I included. I only cooked for 13 min and it came out beautifully! No cracks and the cream cheese portion was the perfect amount for us. I usually double the recipe and just throw in the entire can of pumpkin puree. Keep one for ourselves and take the other to the party!

Like other users here, I used parchment paper instead of a tea towel. Other than this, I followed the recipe exactly as written. This pumpkin roll is delicious every time!

I don't know. I did not find this easy to make at all. Except for mixing and baking; rolling was a disaster. Actually I thought it was going to be ok...rolled in the towel, added confectioners'  sugar on the towel per suggestions and a friend who made one. Seemed to roll fine. Let cool completely after rolling. Spread filling on it and then attempted to roll. Totally cracked. So bummed. Haven't tasted yet, but I am sure it tastes good, the filling was yum, and how could you go wrong with a cup of sugar. Presentation terrible. :( Not sure if I will attempt again; lot of work for a big disappointment, but maybe its just me, and these are my 2 cents.  Thanks anyways.

This is a huge hit with my whole family. I couldn't find the tea cloth so I used wax paper and it worked fine. I did have to let it cool longer before I rolled it up.

I have been making pumpkin rolls for years, and my sisters recipe that i use is in storage. this is almost the same recipe!! Except she added lemon juice to hers (not sure why) but I followed this one.. Some tricks I learned by reading other comments..Use tea towels,(cotton) also I used more conf suger then normal when rolling, and I let sit on counter and then put in fridge and they didn't crack!!! thanks for the great recipe and all the comments..Oh I also greased pan, lined it with wax paper and greased that as well....came out perfect!!!

Wonderful recipe. I did a few things different, i lined my jelly-roll pan with parchment paper, which made it easy to remove, and i dusted a tea towel with confectioner's sugar, on bothsides for easy roll up, and unrolling. I also used Libby's Pumpkin pie filling, not pumpkin puree. This recipe was the best, so yummy!

Hesitant on whether to rate this a four or five; until I experiment with other recipes, a five will do. Is it just me or does flour not mix well with pumpkin? It was like an off-white marble affect that could look cool, but to me, the baker, it's aggravating. I'm not sure I love the the texture of the cake either..but maybe that's because it's a sponge cake? Maybe..I'll keep trying; they're fun!! thanks for making it so easy an anti-climatic ;)

This was my first roll I have ever made. I followed the directions exactly. The only part that made me nervous was, when I started rolling it up in the towel It seemed like it was falling apart, but I didnt mess with it. Just let it cool and continued on with the directions. After I rolled the cream cheese in it and wrapped it in plastic wrap (which seemed to be the most crucial part) and let it chill in the fridge. OMG this was absolutely AMAZING!!! This was simple, inexpensive, and fun to make. I WILL make this again and again.

I put way too much icing on this which just squeezed out the side as I rolled it, but still pretty darn tasty

This was a hit at Thanksgiving.  I used the whole can of puree because I did not want to waste and cooked additional five minutes, still came out great.  Will make again!

Great comments on Thanksgiving!  It broke in half when I unrolled it to add the filling, but it tastes the same, of course.

The trick to this recipe is line baking sheet with parchment paper, and then lightly spray paper and sides of pan.  You should have no trouble getting the cake out of the pan and rolled up.  I drizzle wtih caramel ice cream topping right before serving.

I've made this for years - given to me by a friend.  One alternative that we like better than pumpkin:  omit the pumpkin and spice and replace with ripened bananas...my family actually prefers this combination over the pumpkin.  Super easy - only downside is it makes a little bit of a mess but well worth it!

First time making a cake roll of any sort and this was relatively easy.  The only thing I would recommend is to make sure to put the confectionary sugar immediately before serving - otherwise it melts into the super moist cake.  Really yummy!

Easy and great tasting recipe.  I added finely chopped walnuts on top of the batter when I baked the cake portion for an extra touch.

I saved about 2 tablespoons of filling and after I was done frosting and rolling I piped it on the edges to make it look pretty.

Everyone loved it! It was my first roll of any kind so it took 2 tries to get the cake roll part right, but the second time worked.
I used a silicon mat on the jelly roll pan and this made it very easy to remove.  Also just used paper towels instead of a cloth towel - this also worked just fine.
I would recomend this and make again.

I am so proud of myself! I did this and it turned out GREAT! It was really easy, I did line the pan with parchment paper, makes it soo easy just to flip over onto a towel. I am not a great baker, in fact I rate myself as extremely amature! But took this to work, and it was gone by noon. Because I love the ratio of this recipe, I am going to try and substitute other ingredients, like pureed cranberry...and make a whip cream frosting, I'm not sure if it will turn out, but it seems like you can mix and match stuff. But anyways, Love this recipe!

I thought the recipe could use more information.  Greasing the pan is not enough for success in unmolding the cake; I line it with parchment paper and grease again. I also sprinkle granulated sugar on the tea towel before inverting the still warm cake.  The batter could also use a good pinch of salt to make the flavours come alive.  The icing does not work for me in this cake. It's too soft and can't taste the cake over all that cream cheese. Will probably make the cake again, but not with this filling.

I liked the pumpkin cake part on this. I had bought a can of organic pumpkin and it was very much like homemade pumpkin puree. The cake part was soft, spongy, and not too sweet. However, the filling I did not care much for, I thought it was too soft, sweet, and tasted way too much like cream cheese! I did use light cream cheese, so that may have been the problem with the goey like texture of the filling? However, it still was 8oz of cream cheese to only 2 Tblsp of butter which contributed to the flavor, I believe. It may just be personal opinion. I lined the jelly roll pan with parchment and sprayed it with pan spray. I had no problems with it sticking or rolling. I also dusted the towel with powdered sugar before rolling, it in it, which may have also helped. It did present well. I put it in the freezer and thought it did taste better very cold. I just wish both aspects of the pumpkin roll would have worked well for me. I was really hoping for a go to holiday recipe with this one.

Terrific! Very easy to make and absolutely delicious. As one reader suggested, I dusted the cotton towel with confectioner sugar before flipping the slightly cooled baked dough onto it, rolled the towel/dough and let chill in fridge for a few hours to cool completely. Also as suggested, added 1 Tsp of allspice to the frosting mixture.

Delicious. Actually made the bread spices 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp allspice, and 1 tsp ginger.  Also, I have pets so rolling anything in a towel that could land fur on the roll made me nervous.  I placed parchment paper over the towel, and on the other side of the bread (so the towel shaped it but didn't touch it).

Turned out great--very easy to make.  And more importantly, it tasted great and I wouldn't change anything.  I took one reviewer's advice and cooled it in the refrigerator for two hours.  (It probably would have taken forever otherwise.)  The cream filling also held up very well.  I did find, as with most cakes, that it tasted even better the next day.

I have been making these for at least 20 years, they are wonderful.  I use a mexican vanilla and saigon cinnamon that gives it an extra special taste.  Try putting a little cinnamon in the filling as well, I get raves when I do this.

What a wonderful recipe!!! I did a few changes though. I added some nutmeg and allspice to the batter and it enhanced the taste even more. I used less sugar in frosting as well. I rolled the roll in parchment paper without confectioners sugar, so easy and does not stick either. Second time I made this recipe, I added chopped walnuts and raisins to the batter and baked them together. Due to nuts the roll might be difficult to roll without breaking, so I cut cake in 4 squares (when flat) and put them on top of one another with frosting in between as a traditional cake, what a tasty treat! You can dress it with some holiday inspired items, or decorative garnish!

Excellent, easy, and delicious recipe, the cake doesn't break when rolling it up. I even let it cool overnight in the towel and added the filling the next morning and it was still perfect.

Added about 1.5 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice and a little nutmeg to the cake.  I have been making pumpkin rolls for years and this is the first recipe that did not crack - it looked beautiful and tasted wonderful.

Amazing! My first time making any type of jelly roll. I was worried about the bread not rolling up right and it mot being moist, BUT IT WAS PERFECT! I used wax paper and sprayed it with a little Pam.

I made this to bring to Thanksgiving as a dessert and I think my grandma and grandpa ate the whole thing and took the rest home. :) I liked it a lot. I had to bake it quite a bit longer (5 minutes) than instructed because it wasn't enough for my first try. And, be sure not to use any cloth that even resembles terry cloth. Again, my second try turned out better. The creamy filling is the best part. The confectioners sugar gives the perfect sweetness. Great recipe! I will save it for another event.

Well, holy heck this is freaking fantastic!  Moist, moist, moist!  A little difficulty finding the proper 'pan' as I didn't have a jelly roll pan.  Did roll it onto waxed paper and the thinner the roll; the easier to handle.. freaking AWESOME!  Will make all year round; not just at Thanksgiving!

This was really nice.  My BF doesn't like cream cheese so I used whipped cream instead.  Was messy because of the cream, but tasted really nice.  Very moist and for someone who isn't a "baker", it was really easy to make!  Thank-you for an alternative to pumpkin pie!

This was a very tasty and easy recipe.  It looked impressive as well.  I took the advice of several others and added some allspice to the cream cheese mixture.  Next time I will add some pecans to the cake.  Thanks for a great dessert!!

I always bump up my spices in any recipe I do; I replaced the cinnamon with a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice and added approx. a 1/2 teaspoon cardamom. As for the roll itself, it rolled beautifully! No cracks, beautiful spiral, it's a great recipe. A lot of times since I'm at a higher altitude roulades and jelly rolls don't work very well, so it was nice it turned out the first time. I would, of course, recommend leaving a little parchment along the length of the pan to make removing it easy and rolling it almost immediately, that's the difference between a cracked roll & a fully intact one.

I make tons of cake rolls and while this is  a good basic recipe, it's lacking spices. It is far too bland as written. I add 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger, 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg and 1/8 teaspoon ground cloves along with 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract. These additions make all the difference in taste. As for baking the cake, I spray my jelly roll pan with cooking spray, place parchment over that and then spray the parchment. Then I add the batter and bake. Do not overbake. Mine only takes 9-10 minutes in the oven and it's perfect. I don't bother with the towel thing. I simply dust the cake (right in the pan) with powdered sugar, then roll it up in the parchment. (Firmly, but not tightly.) I place my rolled up cake on a cooling rack and give it an hour to cool. As for the filling, I up the butter to 4 tablespoons.  Any less and all you taste is cream cheese without that creamy goodness from the butter. I also add a sprinkling of spices (cinnamon and nutmeg) to my filling just for a bit more interest and to kick up the taste a bit. With these few changes, this is a huge hit everywhere I take it.

Very easy to make. I do think that the batter needs a bit of salt and maybe some nutmeg, which I will add the next time I make it. Overall a very good recipe.

While I mentioned I'm going to make it, neither my husbandor my son were interested. After it's done, they each had two slice right away :). Will make more in a few days, here is the notes:
1. Lay tin foil and oil spray before pour the cake mix 
2. 1/2 cup of sugar instead of 1 cup for cake mix, 
3. 1/3 cup of confectioner's  sugar instead of 1 cup for cream mix
4. Spread powder sugar on the towel before lay the cake to avoid cake stick on the towel

This recipe was amazing!  Best pumpkin roll that I have ever had and the first that I have ever made!  Way easier than I thought.  The only thing I that I did different was add half a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice to the batter.  So very tasty!

Make extra filling, it's barely enough. Also definitely use parchment paper, otherwise sticks to pan some.

I've made this 3 times and each time was a HUGE hit!  I disagree about using a tea towel -  a thicker towel works better and be sure to COAT it with powdered sugar before dropping the baked cake onto it, otherwise the cake will stick to the towel and start to break apart as you peel the towel off at the end.  I also used a full tsp of cinnamon and added 1 tsp nutmeg to give the cake more flavor and was perfect!

I have to keep an eye on my roll when it's baking so it doesn't over cook. 12 minutes is usually about right. I use a broiler pan lined with waxed or parchment paper since I do not have a jelly roll pan.  Using the paper, I sprinkle the powdered sugar on top when the roll is done and then I roll up the pumpkin roll as is. The paper works great and comes right off after unrolling.

I made this last week after seeing it featured on AllRecipes.  I had everything, but a cotton towel or a jelly pan.  I sprayed a cookie sheet with  PAM and then lined the cookie sheet with parchment paper.  I actually used a pillow case instead of a towel and did not coat it with confectionary sugar.  It got rave reviews and came out perfectly.  I just made two more for tomorrow.  Again I used pillowcases and they both came out perfect.  Love this recipe!!

Good, and everyone seemed to like it fine. I cooked it on parchment paper and had zero problems with the assembly. The icing was delicious. The cake (baked for 10 min and it was done perfectly) was a bit bland and overpowered by the icing's flavor, and it was maybe a little chewier than expected, although probably that's why it didn't break when I rolled it. I would definitely add more spices next time, but other than that, I enjoyed it.

Although we haven't actually eaten the cake yet, I wanted to say that this cake is ridiculously EASY TO MAKE. I'm a very novice baker, and have only recently made the move from cookies to cakes, and I was so excited to try this since it looked so simple. I was worried about the rolling-up party, convinced that I would somehow screw it up (so convinced I bought a back-up dessert just in case) and sure enough it came out PERFECT!

If you're new to baking, cake prep, or just clumsy in the kitchen (like me) you'll love how easy-to-make this cake it...it's beautiful and I'm sure it will be just as tasty!

THANKS!

I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could. I made it for this past Thanksgiving as an extra dessert to make things a little different this year. It turned out sooooo goood! everybody loved it, I wish I had made 3 of them, as it didn't last long at all. I made it that same morning and kept it in the fridge wrapped in plastic until ready to serve. I followed someone else's suggestion to put powdered sugar on the towel before turning it, and it did crack a little but didn't break and it didn't look bad either. Thanks for sharing. I'll be making this again very soon for a Christmas party :)

I made this for my family on Thanksgiving 2011, it was a hit! My family loved it we had no left overs! I followed this recipe, but since the rolling part seemed a little difficult for me, I looked it up on youtube, and guided myself by the youtube video! Thank god for youtube! I'll definitely be doing this again soon!

Comes out tasty, but I disagree that it is "easy" to make, unless you have all the proper gear.  Mine kept falling apart when I went to roll it, I didn't have a "jelly roll pan" but used a cookie sheet and I didn't have the tea towel but tried with aluminum foil.  I wish the recipe had more detail.  That being said I thought it was a bit of work to make, and presentation didn't come out as nice looking for me, but I made up for that by cutting it into pieces.

This is delicious!  The only thing I found that didn't work for me is that you HAVE to use wax paper.  I buttered my pan, and it stuck like crazy!  Good thing I iced that side so you couldn't see it.  Next time, the only thing I would change is use wax paper!

This was my first pumpkin roll.  I really liked the cream cheese filling but the pumpkin cake itself was very bland.  I will try adding pumpkin pie spice next time.  Other than that it was easy to follow, I rolled mine in a damp dish towel and didn't experience any sticking.

Incredible recipe, and very easy to make. I give these pumpkin rolls as gifts. I actually use parchment paper or wax paper to roll the cake part, rather than a dish towel. It works just as well, saves on the messy dish towels.

I have to give this 5 stars because if I had made it with dairy, it would have been sensational!  However, my son is allergic, so I made this with soy butter and soy cream cheese.  AND it is still super duper yummy!  The cake is so moist.  Very easy to handle (putting it in the tea towel to roll).  I used a 9x13 pan.  The cake is probably thicker than it should be, but I don't care ~ it was still delicious.  My son said, "mmmmmmm, cup-key" after trying a bite.  He's 2 :)

This could not be easier to make. My 9 yr. old helped with everything! I didn't find out til it was too late  that I was out of all purpose flour, so I used bread flour and it worked great. Also out of vanilla extract but with only 1/4 tsp. called for, I don't think anyone will miss it. I used real butter to grease the jelly roll pan. It baked in 15 minutes, not a minute longer. The filling was pretty sweet and the pumpkin flavor was mild. Nice presentation when you slice it up!! Thanks for this recipe. It will get a workout next Christmas, that is for sure.

This turned out to be a yummy cake.  It didn't taste like pumpkin at all though.  We thought that it was just like a good carrot cake.  The recipe was fairly easy and the results were impressive.

Good but when all is said and done the cake was kinda bland, and the filling was wonderful, will deff make again but next time add more seasonings, I made three and in one I used just cinnimon and the other two I used pumpkin pie spice, and that made it taste so much better!!!!

Excellent recipe.  Very moist cake and not too sweet.  I made it this afternoon and served it this evening. Everyone enjoyed it very much.  Very easy to make.  Cooked it on parchment paper, turned the cooked cake out onto a tea towel sprinkled with powdered sugar.  I did add more spices: doubled the cinnamon, plus added 1 tsp each allspice and ginger; and added allspice and cinnamon to the filling as well.  I will be making this roll again this weekend.

I make these every year, in fact I made 2 last weekend (gave one away, and my family revolted, so I made another!) They're yummy and easy, and for some reason people are impressed my them. I agree the cake could use a little more spice, but that's just a matter of personal taste! I bake it on parchement paper so it turns out easily, and my recipe calls for more butter and vanilla in the filling. Good stuff!

I made this recipe and it was wonderful! My family and friends were impressed and that's hard to do. The cake was moist and delicious and the filling was great. I probably put more filling in it than what was called for because it was so yummy.

I made this on my lunch break so didn't have time to let it cool completely before adding the filling but it still came out GREAT. I also added a little bit of allspice to the filling per other reviews...amazing!!!!

This recipe is both easy and great!! The only reason I had any troubles was because I don't actually have a Jelly Roll pan. I found that it worked best to divide the batter into two 8x13 pans rather than to attempt to do it all in one pan, which came out really thick. Thanks for the recipe!

I did it...I made a Pumpkin Roll!!!  I followed the recipe exactly, but only had a 9x13 jelly roll pan.  It turned out BEAUTIFULLY!  I'm so excited!  I rated it 4 stars because of the lack of spice.  Both my husband and I agreed that it needed something else like ginger, cloves, and/or nutmeg in addition to the cinnamon.

I didn't have the correct size pan, but the batter was thick enough that it stayed on one half of my jelly roll pan. This was fun to make. My family enjoyed it.

I cannot tell you how good this is.  I made it once for the hell of it and loved it.  I have since made it for 3 Holiday parties, one for my neighbor and one for a co-worker.  EVERYONE wants the recipe.  The only addition I made was 1/2 tsp of allspice to the filling and it is fantastic.

Love This! My sister is the baker in the family so I gave her this recipe and asked her to make it. She has made three of them the last couple months and they are sooo... good. The first one she made we ate a couple hours later at a party and it was very good, but I took the leftovers home and I liked it much better the second day. It was more flavorful. I asked her to make them a day in advance next time. I also found that it tastes better at room temperature rather than cold.

I can't believe it has taken me so long to rate this recipe.  I have used it about 15 times.  It is the BEST Pumpkin Roll recipe!  It never cracks or breaks, which has been my experience with other recipes.  Use plenty of powdered sugar on your towel before you roll it and it won't stick at all! Oh, and it is delicious!

All I can say is WOW!  I was apprehensive making this, thinking that for sure for me this would not come out of the pan nicely and I would have a big mess on my hands...Not at all true!  I sprayed the pan well, and after baking it came right out!  My husband was very delighted with this, it looks like you spent hours when actually just takes minutes.  Great recipe!

Simple and Delicious!  Wonderful served with coffee!  Next time I make this, however, I will try adding the allspice to the cream cheese frosting for a little added touch as suggested by another reviewer.  Thanks Jackie! :)

This turned out OK - I was very happy that rolling up the cake was as easy as it was but I thought the cake had a very strange consistency.  It was really chewy.  Also, I couldn't get the roll as tight as I've seen in the bakery - that part takes some practice I guess.  The filling was good - used the allspice other reviewers had suggested.  I'll keep trying some other recipes until I find one I really like.

Delicious and sponge-y. My tip for rolling is roll it immediately out of the oven with parchment paper—Hot to touch, but makes a big difference when trying to avoid cracking.

Made it as is in the recipe and got rave reviews from our Christmas guests. The next day, my husband asked where that pumpkin roll went and there were no leftovers to be found. Will definitely be making this again soon!

Made this with minor seasoning alterations. Served at Thanksgiving and was a huge hit. Everyone enjoyed it so much there was nothing left.

Love this! I made two separate batches of this. The first cream cheese mixture had bumps in it. So, the second cheese mixture I mixed the butter, cream cheese, and vanilla first then added the powdered sugar in 3rds mixing till smooth.

It did crack a little when I was rerolling it but very easy to make. I've frozen it to serve on Thanksgiving so hopefully it will taste as good as it looks.

OKAY so I’m a horrible baker but baking makes me happy so I decided to try this and guys it WORKED!! I was so nervous bc anytime I’ve ever tried rolling anything it falls apart but this stayed together and rolled beautifully. I used parchment paper to line the pan and glued down the sides with some of the batter to help it stay down and baked it for 15 minutes. Used an old thin cotton baby blanket doused in powdered sugar to roll it in. The icing was THICK so I had to thin it with a little heavy whipping cream. If I can make this literally anyone can! I’m so glad I tried something new and seemingly challenging and it turned out perfect!

This is the first time I've ever attempted a roll and it turned out amazing!  Excellent flavor (I rolled in chopped pecans) and used  Mexican vanilla (the best!)  which has its own unique flavor, this is my "secret ingredient".   I cut one slice to taste prior to refrigerating and I noticed when I sliced it the following morning it sliced much better.  I also froze a couple of slices to see how this would turn out and I feel it is safe to say these freeze well. I had cut all the slices, put them into muffin cups, into a plastic container (put the lid on) and took one out after work today to let thaw.  I seemed to be even more moist, held its shape and was just as good as it was when it came out of the oven yesterday.

I make these every year using the exact recipe. Only thing I do that isn't listed is when mixing the eggs, sugar etc, I mix on high for several minutes. Makes the cake turn out better in my opinion!

My first try at this recipe turned out perfect!  My family loves it. Since then I have made over 3 dozen for friends and family.  So far the only change I made was increase the amount of cinnamon to 1 tsp. full.  I think on the next one I will add a 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and 1/4 tsp cloves instead and see how that turns out.  For those who have trouble getting it to roll...make sure you beat the egg yolks with sugar well and also make sure the egg whites have stiff peaks before gently blending in with the flour.  I use a rubber spatula to blend my yolks and flour, then add my egg whites and only mix them as much as I absolutely have to.  Also, I only bake it for 12 min.  The first ones I baked for 15 min. and they were too dry.

If I could this a 5+ I would.  I served for a dinner party last night and there were only 4 of us and the whole roll was almost eaten! Now that is saying something.  Absolutely decadent, would not change a thing.  Happy Baking everyone.

I made 2, one a few hours later and chose to bake the second a little longer (20 min) and I like the texture with this addition. Also, as suggested, I added spices to the filling and it was delicious! Nutmeg, pumpkin pie spice, ginger. A bit of vanilla too. Considering it was a first attempt at a roll, it went really well!

So easy!  Instead of using the towel I lined my pan with parchment and sprayed the pan and paper with coconut cooking spray before adding batter. I rolled the first time with the  parchment and after it was cooled, unrolled and spread with filling, I rolled it back up- peeling the parchment off as I did. Worked great! Next time I will add some orange zest to the filling.

This was very easy to make and tasted great.  My only issue is that it cracked when I re-rolled it.  I, like others, sprayed the bottom of the pan and then lined with parchment.

I’ve made this twice. I use greased parchment paper for baking , makes it far easier for me to roll it. I agree with others, it definitely needs pumpkin spice in it. Once that’s added it becomes a 5 star recipe. I’ll definitely use this for my go

First time I made this I used parchment paper for baking and rolling and it worked great.  Second time I used my silicon baking mat.  It did not work as well. It might work if you spray it first.  But without spraying it, for me, it stuck to the cake.

Also, I use way more icing sugar that the recipe calls for.  Almost double, but not quite.

I’ve made this recipe four times as directions written. Don’t change anything.  I did find out that if I cooked the mix too thick it would crack when I rolled it.

I've made other pumpkin rolls before that have come out great but this one I wasn't very fond of. I found that the cake was very dry but that could have been from my oven  it's an old electric. The cake was also tasteless even though I added some extra flavoring such as nutmeg and vanilla. I think that adding pumpkin pie spice to it could help. The cream cheese filling was great and I even made some cream cheese icing to drizzle over the top which made it more appealing to the eye. Just a few minor changes to the recipe could make it a delicious one!

This is the 1st time I've made this, I'm not a whiz in the kitchen nor do I bake, the 1st one of 3 tasted great but the bread broke coming off the pan, which I take complete responsibility for.... the 2nd one was perfect and my 3rd is rolled up and cooling waiting on me to add the icing, I had my two kids help and it was also a hit at Thanksgiving. The recipe was easy to follow which is good for me......thank you, I've found my new thing to bring to the table....

This is a good recipe.  As easy to make as pumpkin rolls can be.  Only modification I make is add a tablespoon of cinnamon instead.  It gives a deeper color and also adds more flavor.  Great recipe.

I liked it, overall. The cake was pretty chewy, but maybe that's how a pumpkin roll is supposed to be? The cream cheese filling is delicious, but very sweet and rich. The cake has a mild flavor, not very strong on the pumpkin. Next time around I might try reducing the sugar in the filling and adding some spices to the cake.

Living at 5200 feet, this was delicious with minor modification. I did use a tsp of pumpkin pie spice in the sponge instead of cinnamon and added some to the frosting as well. It needed to come out of the oven at about 13 minutes, but everyone's loved it and it's the first swiss roll I've done that hasn't cracked

375 degrees was cooked (burnt) in 10 minuets I was able to salvage it. I had a recipe like this but could not find it and for me it was missing more spice like nutmeg and ground cloves. But still tasty and everyone loved it.

Mine fell all apart when I took it out of the pan.  I had greased and floured.  Next time I'll line with parchment paper.  Should have read reviews first.  Also, recipe should specify which way to roll.  I rolled so that it is long...assuming this is correct.

My first time making one of these and it turned out great! I laid down parchment paper to bake per another review and it came out of the pan so easily. I also added a little extra cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice per other reviews about blandness and it was delicious! I also added about a cup of powder sugar to the cream cheese frosting and did a full teaspoon of vanilla because the icing was a little bland too. My family loved it and it was so easy!

Great, easy recipe. I would double the frosting next time, since my roll wasn't filled as much as the picture. Definitely will make again!

Surprisingly easy. The last time I tried making a roll, it was a disaster (fell apart while rolling). The cake in this recipe is spongy enough to stay intact even while making a tighter roll. I had to cut off the two edges of the final cake to make it look more presentable since the icing didn't spread all the way to the edges.

Also, the icing is a bit too sweet for me, next time I'd probably reduce the powdered sugar by 25%. Besides that, perfect!

Good recipe. I tasted the batter before baking and seemed a little bland so I added 1/8 tsp clove 1/8 tsp nutmeg 1/8 tsp ginger and 1 tea vanilla extract. It was really good and although I don't like too spicy, I felt like the batter was too bland, so I made adjustments and it tasted great. Thank you for sharing. Little tip, use the tea towel better then parchment paper, bc I feel the tea absorbs most of the moister and you won't have a soggy roll.

delicious and simpler than I expected.  I had a little difficulty getting it out of the pan.  I may try the wax paper next time or grease and flour.  I used olive oil spray :(  The next issue was that I let it cool a little too long and I ended up with a couple small cracks, but it was still very tasty

I've made this several times and everyone loves it. I add a 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract in the pumpkin mixture and 1/2 tsp. in the filling as well. As long as you have a good jelly roll or cookie pan (non stick) , it's very simple.

Awesome and easy recipe.  I made it twice.  The first time I made it I found the cake to be dense & there wasn't enough filling.  So I added 2 beaten egg whites to the cake mix and an extra 6 oz of cream cheese to the filling.  Turned out perfect.

LOVE THIS RECIPIE! Super simple and easy! Works fine with self rising flour (just don't add the baking soda) and if your like me and have not quite mastered rolling it don't despair! You can just bake it like a regular cake, loaf, or cupcake and ice the tops with the yummy cream cheese topping. I use fresh pumpkin much better than the canned variety. I also recently tried a "healthy" breakfast version. I simply added shredded carrots, rasins, and chocolate chips (I know, there is a reason I put the word healthy in quotes). Just stir in the carrots then sprinkle the heavier ingerdients (chocolate chips, rasins, nuts, etc.) on top after you pour the mix in the pan. Otherwise the heavier ingredients will just sink to the bottom (Which is fine unless your planning on doing muffins or cupcakes).

Am in the process of making one of these for the 5th time.   A very simple recipe with much fewer ingredients than other recipes for the same thing.   This has been a hit over and over, I have even been commissioned to make some for my coworkers to take to their family holiday meals!   Patience is key to this recipe.  Give ample time to cool before trying to add the filling.  I use wax paper, lightly greased with butter, and dashed with some flower so it doesn't stick to my pan and I can bake a second cake with almost no clean up between rolls.

Very good!  First time I made it the cake was a little bland, so I took another reviewer's advice and upped the cinnamon to 1 teaspoon and added 1 teaspoon allspice.  It was just right.  Used the icing recipe as written.  Also lined the pan with parchment and sprinkled comfectioner's sugar on the tea towel.  Worked like a charm!

THANKSGIVING DESSERT 2011 - I don't think pumpkin roll can go wrong for Thanksgiving. This recipe was great. I made 2 rolls. 1 for my family and 1 for my husband's co-worker. When I sent the roll with my husband the day before T-day, he came back with the pumpkin roll! Sadly, his co-worker's wife was diagnosed the previous day with diabetes. I think I'll try to freeze the other roll for Christmas.

Superb - hard to stop eating this one :) The cake is so moist it's incredible. I'm not as much as a sweet tooth as others, so I might find a way to cut down the icing, but it's still very very good.

This is delicious!!  I found this recipe and decided to try it.  My mother hates pumpkin pie and my father loves it.   I wanted to find something that everyone would want to eat.  I made this and not only did everyone love it, but it was very much like a recipe my Grandmother used to make.  This is a great new addition to our holiday treats.  We'll make this from now on.  I didn't have to change a thing.

This was a hit!! I made this for a work party and I doubled the recipe hoping to have leftovers to take home. But it was all gone. Very easy to make so I had to make another one for my family to enjoy. They loved it too.

Made this for Thanksgiving, turned out great, everybody loved it.  I used a soy based non-dairy cream cheese due to a family member's dairy allergy, no one would have known had I not told them.  I will definitely be making this again!

This was a HUGE success. It took me 2 tries but once I got it down, let me just say that it went down with everyone else Very nicely! I made 2 per party I have attended. One with walnuts, one without. Thank you so much for such a tasty treat! I am making copies of the recipe for friends now. I am still learning but it is VERY important to use a JELLY ROLL PAN to get the look you have. YUM!!! Also my husband wants this more. My family was actually fighting for the last few pieces at Thanksgiving.

So easy, pretty, and popular with guests. I used half the recommended sugar in the frosting and found it to be plenty sweet and a nice contrast to the sweetness of the pumpkin bread.  I also threw in a pinch of cardamom in the batter to add another level of subtle flavor.

Easy recipe, yes.  The taste was disappointing.  I have another pumpkin recipe that has almost same ingredients, but with equal parts of pumpkin, flour, sugar and oil.  I will not make this one again.

This is an amazing recipe!! Will be a family fav! Only thing i did different was roll it in a cheesecloth instead of a tea towel less cracking.  Next time i may only use half of icing in roll a little too sweet - Thanks Jackie

I was amazed at how easy this was.  My husband just loved it.  I put a little powdered sugar on the towel before placing and rolling up the cake in it.  I will use this again for sure.  It will impress at family get togethers.  They will think I am a pro.  Thank you for this recipe.

This is one of the hardest recipes I have ever made. I tried the wax paper trick as stated in another review and it made matters worse for me. The pie stuck to the wax paper and it cracked every time I tried to roll it. I may try again w/out the wax paper. However it did taste great.

Mixed reviews here. My husband loved it and I did not. It was a bit too sweet for me (Which is odd since I love my sweets) and it did not keep well...the next day it was soggy and heavy. The pumkin flavor was good and my husband loved it in the morning with his coffee.

Very good.  I don't think I used the right length of pan, so my roll was short and it cracked, but I blame that on my cooking skill.  The taste was very good!

Ok, so I rarely cook or bake, but I absolutely love pumpkin bread and I thought I would give this a try.  Guess what?  It turned out perfectly!  Wonderful recipe!

This is so easy to make and delicious to eat!  I make this quite frequently and have had only one time where I didn't quite let the loaf bake enough.  Wonderful recipe!!
