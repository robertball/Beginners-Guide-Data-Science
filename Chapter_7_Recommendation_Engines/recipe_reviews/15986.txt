They are easy and do look impressive and are very tasty.   The dough is super sticky.  I sprayed my hands with oil before rolling it into walnut sized balls. I came out with 4 dozen cookies.   Thanks Connie!

I was looking for something easy to do on a lazy Sunday afternoon, and this recipe was exactly what I was looking for. It tastes just like a snickerdoodle and is so easy to make.

Yummy!!  These are great and very easy.  I just rubbed my hands with butter before rolling into balls and they turned out lovely.

These cookies sounded good, but didn't turn out that way!  First of all they are so sticky that you can't roll them into balls; they wouldn't bake (after 18 minutes the middles were still doughy) and they stuck to the pan.  I threw all of them away... what a waste!

This is a decent cookie for being so low in fat, but I had high hopes for this and I did not really care for the way they turned out. Way, way too sweet and I didn't even use the powedered sugar.  I think I will try a cake box cookie again in a different flavor, maybe use butter or oil instead of cool whip.  Thanks though.

They are sticky, I took the suggestion to spray hands with oil before rolling.  Used powdered sugar for some.  Don't over cook, they will get too brown on the bottom.  Let them cool 5 min on the pan, then put them on a rack.  Mine did not stick to the pan.  It was not too sweet.  It is a chewy low fat cookie, just ok in my household--but they were all eaten up.

Super tasty cookie! Although I had some trouble with the consistency and baking them.  Also, the cookies stuck to the pan, so I wish you luck.  They are easy, yummy and different!

These are fine soft vanilla cookies.  I have made lemon cookies with cake mix and frozen whipped topping, and I have made chocolate cookies with cake mix and frozen whipped topping.  They are always very messy and always very very good--!

The dough is so sticky after making I have found that  freezing it for a bit before rolling into balls and baking makes it easier to work with

Good for a quick cookie, but the cool whip creates a more cake like texture, and not a chewy cookie. I read others had issues with the dough being sticky so I used a spring hinged cookie scoop and sprinkled the cinnamon sugar mixture over the top.
