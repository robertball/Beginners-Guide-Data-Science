These are fantastic! The frosting is awesome, but make sure to decorate cupcakes one at a time or the sprinkles won't stick. I was expecting the cream cheese filling to be more of a cream filling, but it is actually more like a marbled cupcake. Still very good though!! And they look so pretty!!

These cupcakes are light and airy.  If your looking for a dense chocolatey cupcake, don't choose this recipe.   I wouldn't bother with the "cheesecake" center.  It dropped to the bottom of the silicone cups, was barely visible, and didn't add anything to the taste.

Really good cupcake frosting, add sprinkles/toppings immediately though because after it cools completely, they won't stick.
