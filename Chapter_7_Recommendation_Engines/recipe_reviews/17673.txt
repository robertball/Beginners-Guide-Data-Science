Today I made this for the second time. I added 1/4 cup brown sugar and doubled the cinnamon. Very yummy. Mine turned out to be a quick bread texture and flavor. I baked it for exactly 60 minutes. Thanks Pam.PS It seemed to have more flavor the second time around. I believe a teaspoon of vanilla or 1/2t of orange extract would really bring out the flavor in this wonderfully textured bread.

Very good. I substituted 1/2 the oil with apple sauce and toasted pecans for the walnuts. I did not have any cherries. For anyone that does not have a scale 3.5 oz of coconut is aprox. 1 1/2 cups. I made it in my bread machine and topped it with orange cream cheese frosting (from this site). Yummy!

very good as muffins (bake for 15-20 min at 350) topped with homemade cream cheese frosting. Next time I would add more carrots and 1 1/2 c coconut and more cinnamon

I doubled this recipe because it sounded so good and I am glad I did. It looks attractive and the taste is wonderful. I am guessing it gets better after sitting a day but that won't happen around here!

I baked this bread after my pediatrician suggested making these types of breads (zucchini carrot) for breakfast to try and sneak some veggies into my toddler's diet. The whole family loved it! I substituted 1 1/4 cups whole wheat flour for 1 1/4 cups of the all purpose flour cut down the coconut to only 1 cup (many people said 1 1/2 cups was way too much) and left out the cherries and it tasted great. I made sure to use my food processor to basically MINCE the carrot coconut walnuts and raisins because I knew if I left them as instructed (shredded/chopped) my toddler would refuse to eat it with so many conflicting textures. It was a great call - seemed to meld the flavors even better and he gobbled it up. I HIGHLY recommend this bread to any Mom trying to be "deceptively delicious" and sneak veggies into their kids diet:)

This was a great recipe. I substituted 3/4 cup of the all-purpose flour for whole wheat flour and used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar. I didn't have applesauce so I used the full amount of oil. I also added a tsp of vanilla. Turned out super moist and delicious! I served it with the Cream Cheese Frosting II (recipe on this site). Got rave reviews!

Just baked a double batch of this and to sum up a majority of the tweaks, here's what you need to modify: drop to 1/2c. white sugar and add 1/2c. brown sugar, 2 generous tsp cinnamon; drop to 1/4c. veg oil and add 1/4c. apple sauce; add 1 tsp vanilla.  Like others, I omitted the cherries, just because this is carrot bread, not fruit bread and the addition of coconut, raisins, and walnuts was sufficient.  I was also skeptical on overfilling the pan - it just seemed like a lot so I cut back and filled 2/3 pan and baked for 50 mins and really, I should have just put it all in one pan (well, two since I made a double batch).  I agree with topping it with cream cheese frosting.  Hope this helps!

I took someones suggestion and added vanilla. Very tasty recipe. I made muffins instead of a bread and froze the extras. This recipe freezes very well. I will make this again.

This was good I thought but not great. I followed the suggesion of another reviewer and whirled the coconut in the food processor and thought that was a good idea - I also would not have liked the long strands of coconut. Also left out the cherries. Also used half applesauce and half oil. Perhaps it will taste better today as these breads often do the day after baking.

I chose this bread primarily b/c I have a toddler who refuses to eat veggies so I decided to try this one given the ample amount of carrot in it.Well baby doesn't care for it so much but my hubby and I love it.I substituted applesauce for most of the oil and didn't add walnut or cherries...delish! the one thing I'll do next time is to pulse the coconut before adding I find that I am not too crazy about the long strands of coconut in this bread and I like a smooth texture better. Great (and very healthy ) recipe.Thanks for sharing it.

Yummy! I made this bread exactly following the directions. There was a slightly oily taste. Next Time I will substitute some of the oil for applesauce

The smell was heavenly as it was baking but when it was time to eat we thought the coconut overpowered the rest of the bread. I think the cherries and carrots got lost with all the coconut. I guess I will keep looking. Sorry

Made this carrot bread twice. I was estimating 3oz so I ended up putting in 1 cup of coconut which was good but I'll be sure to try 1 1/2 cups (as suggested by a reviewer) next time. The second time I replaced a cup of flour with whole wheat and it was unnoticable. I have a dark blue glass 9x5 loaf pan and each time it took about 90 minutes to cook but it came out moist with a nice crispy crust. Thanks!

I brought this to my small office of 8 people this morning and it was gone in less than 5 hours. Everybody who tried it loved it. I opted not to add the cherries (that kind of freaked me out a little). I was also out of walnuts (which it needed) and used golden raisins and applesauce. EXCELLENT! Thanks for the new recipe!

Great recipe and I didn't change anything. But it seemed like way too much batter for one 9x5 loaf pan so maybe I'll try putting it in two pans next time or making muffins. Thanks!:-)

This is a good recipe! I substituted cherries for pinnapple and 30 grams less coconut and used 30 gr oats in its place! Keeping it just a wee bit healthier! Will use this recipe as a rough draft again!

Absolutely wonderful. Did not have any maraschino cherries so I left those out but it was still delicious without them. Will definitely make this again.

OMG! I didn't have the coconut cherries or raisins so I omitted them but did have fresh from the orchard walnuts so they were chopped and added. Rather than grating carrots... I juice so I used the pulp from my juicing that morning... carrots celery granny smith apples. The batter it was level with the bread pan when it went into the oven but puffed up oh so nice... you can see the pan level where the sides meet the top. As with any bread I bake once out of the oven the top gets covered with butter right out of the frig.

Used high altitude flour. Didn't have milk too lazy to go to the store used 1/2 and 1/2. It's still cooling but it certainly looks pretty! Next time I make it (and there will be more next times) I'll use mini loaf pans so that I can share the wealth.

I made it vegan so I used almond milk and a 12oz package of soft tofu instead of eggs which also allows to skip the oil. It was delicious

This was a good recipe. I did make some changes, I didn't add cherries, nuts or raisins, instead I added chocolate chips and nutmeg. Still very good! I also subbed Duck eggs instead of chicken. The duck eggs must have added a whole lot of extra puff because it says it only makes one loaf but I was able to make two out of a batch.

This was good. I left out the coconut and cherries because I didn't have them. I had doubled the cinnamon and we loved it. My only complaint was that it was a bit dry. Not sure quite why. I think next time I will add a little extra applesauce to it. If that doesn't work I will try adding another egg.

Everyone loved it. My boss said "This is the first time you made it?" I brown sugar; substituted cherries for dried cranberries; used almond milk.
